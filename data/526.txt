DEATH OF JUSTICE BLACKMUN
Supreme Court of the United States

MONDAY, MARCH 8, 1999

Present: Chief Justice Rehnquist, Justice O'Connor,
Justice Kennedy, Justice Souter, Justice Thomas,
Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer.

The Chief Justice said:
As we open this morning, I announce with sadness that
our friend and colleague Harry A. Blackmun, a former Justice of this Court, died on Thursday morning, March 4, 1999,
at Arlington Hospital, in Arlington, Virginia.

Justice Blackmun was born in Nashville, Illinois, in 1908,
and grew up in St. Paul, Minnesota. He received a scholarship to Harvard where he majored in mathematics and graduated summa cum laude. He received his law degree from
Harvard Law School in 1932.

Justice Blackmun began his legal career serving as a law
clerk to Judge John Sanborn on the United States Court of
Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. After his clerkship, he
spent 16 years in private practice, specializing in taxation,
litigation, wills, and estate planning. He then became the
first resident counsel at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, where he combined his love for law and medicine. In
1959, President Eisenhower nominated him to serve on the
United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, filling
the vacant seat of Judge Sanborn for whom he had clerked
26 years earlier. After serving nine years on the Eighth
Circuit, he was appointed by President Nixon to a seat on
the Supreme Court in June 1970.

vi DEATH OF JUSTICE BLACKMUN

Justice Blackmun was the 98th Justice to serve on theCourt and served for nearly a quarter of a century. He

spoke for the Court in more than 350 opinions. The pub-licity that the Roe v. Wade opinion received may have obscured many other important decisions he authored. Thoseinclude Mistretta v. United States, in which the Sentencing
Guidelines were held to be constitutional; Daubert v. Merrell
Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., concerning the admissibility ofscientific evidence in federal courts; and Virginia State

Board of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council,Inc., which opened new horizons on First Amendment protection of commercial speech, to name just three. He was aworthy successor to the predecessors in the seat which he
occupied--Joseph Story, Oliver Wendell Holmes, BenjaminCardozo, and Felix Frankfurter. He will be missed by his
friends throughout the judiciary and the country.I speak for the members of this Court in expressing our
profound sympathy to Mrs. Blackmun, and his daughtersNancy, Sally, and Susan, and to his grandchildren. The
recess this Court takes today will be in his memory. At anappropriate time, the traditional memorial observance of

the Court and the Bar of the Court will be held in thisCourtroom.

PROCEEDINGS IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THEUNITED STATES IN MEMORY OF

JUSTICE POWELL*

TUESDAY, MAY 18, 1999

Present: Chief Justice Rehnquist, Justice Stevens,
Justice O'Connor, Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy,
Justice Souter, Justice Thomas, and Justice Ginsburg.

The Chief Justice said:
The Court is in special session this afternoon to receivethe Resolutions of the Bar of the Supreme Court in tribute to

our former colleague and friend, Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.The Court recognizes the Solicitor General.

The Solicitor General addressed the Court as follows:
Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
At a meeting today of the Bar of this Court, Resolutionsmemorializing our deep respect and affection for Justice

Powell were unanimously adopted. With the Court's leave,I shall summarize the Resolutions and ask that they be set
forth in their entirety in the records of the Court.

Lewis Franklin Powell, Jr., served on the Supreme Courtfrom January 7, 1972, until June 26, 1987. Born on September 19, 1907, in Suffolk, Virginia, Powell lived most of his life

*Justice Powell, who retired from the Court effective June 26, 1987 (483
U. S. vii), died in Richmond, Virginia, on August 25, 1998 (525 U. S. v).

in Richmond. His father was a successful businessman,with sufficient resources to send his son to a private boys'

school in Richmond, then to six years at Washington and LeeUniversity, where Lewis, Jr., earned both undergraduate and
law degrees, and finally to one year at Harvard Law School.At Washington and Lee, he was the proverbial "big man on
campus." He was elected president of the student body,tapped for a succession of exclusive clubs, and chosen to represent the school at the National Student Federation.

In 1931, Powell graduated first in his law school class atWashington and Lee, then went to Harvard. There the

competition was entirely different. Powell took a seminarin Administrative Law taught by Felix Frankfurter, who
would later succeed Benjamin Cardozo on the SupremeCourt. Seated around the seminar table with the two future
Justices were Harold Stephens, who would later serve on theD. C. Circuit Court of Appeals; Louis Jaffe, who had a brilliant career on the Harvard law faculty as a specialist in administrative law; and Paul Freund, who became a celebratedteacher of constitutional law and twice was seriously considered by President Kennedy for appointment to the SupremeCourt. In this company, the graduate student from Virginia
did not stand out. He sat at the far end of the table fromthe voluble professor, took copious notes, and said as little
as possible.

Lewis Powell left Harvard at the depth of the Great De-pression. He turned down an offer from John W. Davis to

work at Davis, Polk, and Wardwell for the munificent salaryof $150 per month and took a job in Richmond for one-third
that rate. He was to practice law in Richmond for nearly40 years, eventually becoming the city's leading lawyer and
one of its foremost citizens. Much of that time Powell spentbuilding a corporate practice at the great law firm that would
one day bear his name (Hunton, Williams, Gay, Powell & Gibson), but to an astonishing degree he also devoted himself
to public service. In the history of private practice, there
is no better example of the lawyer as public citizen than
Lewis Powell.

ixJUSTICE POWELL
In the early years, Powell's public role was strictly local.He volunteered at the Legal Aid Society of Richmond, involved himself in a host of other civic activities, and becameactive in the local bar. For Powell, as for so many members
of his generation, service on a broader scale began in theaftermath of Pearl Harbor. Too old to be drafted, Powell
had good reasons not to volunteer. In 1936, he had marriedJosephine Pierce Rucker, a woman of striking beauty, vivacious temperament, and an immense capacity for supporting
her husband. By 1941, they had two daughters. Powell'slaw partners urged him to stay home, saying that he might

leave a wife and two small children with no means of liveli-hood, but, as Lewis told Jo, "I could never have looked my
children in the face if I had ducked this responsibility."It was not in Lewis Powell's nature to duck any responsibility. In 1942, he joined the intelligence branch of theArmy Air Forces and in September of that year, found himself one of 16 officers crammed into a double berth on the
Queen Mary, as the fast ship sped to Europe with a preciouscargo of 17,000 American servicemen. Powell's unit spent

six weeks in England, then shipped to North Africa. Theair campaign was hard on the 319th Bombardment Group,
and losses of men and airplanes mounted. When the unitwas pulled from combat in February 1943 for rest and refitting, Powell transferred to the intelligence staff at the North
African headquarters for Anglo-American air forces, wherehe helped plan the bombing campaign for the invasion of

Sicily.In August 1943, Powell was beginning to work on the
planned invasion of the Italian mainland, when suddenly andmysteriously he was ordered back to the States. At first, it
seemed that he had been brought home only to update Armymanuals, but it soon became clear that he was in fact being
interviewed for the most elite and unusual of all military
intelligence services--the so-called Special Branch. The
Special Branch was the organizational home of 28 American
officers recruited to advise senior Allied commanders on the
use of "Ultra" intelligence. That name referred to radio

526BV$ Unit: UVII [12-08-00 17:15:17] PGT: FRT
x JUSTICE POWELL
intercepts encoded on the German enciphering machine"Enigma" and deciphered by the British through painstaking

analysis at a secret installation outside London. Since theGermans used the Enigma machine for high-level radio traffic, the ability to decrypt Enigma intercepts gave the Britishaccess to the most secret of Germany's wartime communications. The challenge was to put this information to gooduse without revealing its source, for once the Germans suspected that the Enigma encoding mechanism had been broken, the intelligence would end.Powell's job, and that of the other 27 Ultra representatives, was to receive Ultra decrypts, interpret them in lightof other intelligence, present the findings to senior commanders, and make sure that no action taken on the basis of thisinformation would reveal its source. For this purpose, Powell was assigned to the United States Strategic Air Force,where he eventually became head of the Operational Intelligence Division, comprising about 40 officers and as many enlisted personnel. In that capacity, Powell often representedhis superiors at General Eisenhower's daily briefing, held

originally in London and subsequently in the Petit Trianonat Versailles. Operational intelligence rewarded a lawyer's
skills. Powell analyzed evidence, organized it coherently,and presented it to his superiors, all the while balancing loyalty to their aims and objectives with the independence of
judgment necessary to a good counselor. From this experi-ence, Powell gained a firm sense of his own competence and

fitness to command.At the end of the war, Powell returned home with the rank
of full colonel, a chest full of decorations, and a set of long-stemmed champagne glasses that he had "liberated" from
the basement of Hitler's retreat at Berchtesgaden. Powellalso came home a patriot. Although his love of country was
not of the sloganeering, flag-waving variety, Powell never
doubted the broad alignment of national self-interest with
world peace and freedom. For Powell, American mistakes
were aberrational, not symptomatic. He had an ardent faith
in his country's essential rightness, a faith powerfully rein526BV$ Unit: UVII [12-08-00 17:15:17] PGT: FRT

xiJUSTICE POWELL
forced by his service in World War II. In a long life of dis-tinguished achievement, there was no part of his career of

which Powell was more proud.Back in Richmond, Powell renewed the process of building
a law practice. Somehow, he also found time to do pro bonowork for a variety of local organizations, including the Red
Cross, the Virginia Home for Incurables, the Retreat for theSick Hospital, the Family Service Society of Richmond, and
even the Garden Club of Virginia. He became known as the
leading "free" lawyer in Richmond, a reputation, he latersaid, that was "not given the highest rating by partners concerned with cash flow."By far the most important--and the most controversial--
of Powell's local activities was his stewardship of the Rich-mond public schools during the early years of desegregation.
Powell was appointed to the Richmond School Board in 1950and elected its chairman two years later. In 1954, the Supreme Court announced the beginning of the end of the Old
South in Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954),and one year later ordered desegregation to begin "with all

deliberate speed." Brown v. Board of Education, 349 U. S.294, 301 (1955). Today,

Brown is universally admired as
both right and necessary. Indeed, no other decision in thiscentury is so secure in moral standing or public esteem. It

therefore requires an act of imagination to reconstruct the
South's original response. In 1956, Senator Harry FloodByrd, acknowledged leader of Virginia politics, called for

"massive resistance" to the Supreme Court order. TheByrd organization's successful candidate for governor echoed
that call: "Let there be no misunderstanding, no weaselwords, on this point: We dedicate our every capacity to preserve segregation in the schools." To back up that bluster,the state prepared to shut down public schools altogether
rather than allow black and white to sit together. This policy was shameful in origin, unlawful in operation, and disastrous in consequence. Public schools were closed in several
Virginia cities and later in Prince Edward County, and for
nearly a decade Virginia fought desegregation to a standstill.

xii JUSTICE POWELL

It was Lewis Powell's fate to confront the hysteria of mas-sive resistance in the capital of the old Confederacy. Publicly, he said nothing. Even when the Richmond City Coun-cil, which appointed School Board members, demanded to
know Powell's position on desegregation, he refused to elabo-rate on a press release of deliberate vagueness. For the
eight years in which Powell was chairman of the RichmondSchool Board, neither he nor that body took any public position on "massive resistance." Behind the scenes, however,
Powell fought hard against it. He made a futile effort todissuade Senator Byrd from this perilous course and

staunchly supported Virginia moderates. In particular,Powell did battle with "interposition," the purported theoretical justification for massive resistance. Interposition ad-vocates claimed for each state the right to defy and disregard
Supreme Court decisions that they believed to have de-parted from the Constitution. In a letter to the governor, in
a memorable debate before an influential group of the state's
leading lawyers and businessmen, and in innumerable pri-vate conversations, Powell assailed this pernicious doctrine.

It was, he argued, "no less than a proposal of insurrection"against the national government, reflecting an "attitude of
lawlessness" which would not be tolerated in an individualand which would bring discredit on the state. Eventually,
interposition and massive resistance ran their course.
When Powell stepped down from the Richmond SchoolBoard, integration had begun, albeit just barely. Critics

could and did complain about the pace of progress, but theschools had been kept open.

In 1964, Powell moved onto the national scene as Presidentof the American Bar Association. In his inaugural speech
in August of that year, Powell outlined three initiatives.First, he called for comprehensive reform of legal ethics.
This project, which began under Powell's leadership, replaced the 1908 canons of ethics with a new Code of Professional Responsibility, adopted by the ABA in 1969. Second,
Powell announced a massive project on standards for the
administration of criminal justice. Chief Judge Edward J.

xiiiJUSTICE POWELL
Lumbard of the Second Circuit chaired this effort. Partici-pants included academics, lawyers, and judges, including four

future Justices of the Supreme Court--Powell himself; War-ren Burger, who eventually succeeded Lumbard as overall
head of the project; Abe Fortas, who served on a committeeon the conflict between free press and fair trial; and Harry
Blackmun, who sat on a committee on the role of the trialjudge. Third, Powell called for a dramatic expansion of
legal services for the poor. This proposal led to Powell's
most notable accomplishment as President of the ABA--thebirth of the Legal Services Program.

The Family Service Society of Richmond, where Powellhad worked, was representative of traditional legal aid societies. Led by establishment lawyers, staffed largely by vol-unteers, and allied with the local bar, their goal was not to
attack poverty as such but to provide adequate legal repre-sentation for those who happened to be poor. Lyndon Johnson's "War on Poverty" spawned a radically different approach. In November 1964, Sargent Shriver, director of anewly created federal agency called the Office of Economic

Opportunity, called for a federal program of legal aid for thepoor. His proposal raised fears that lawyers' traditional
freedom to represent their clients as they thought bestwould be subordinated to the dictates of bureaucrats and
social workers. Moreover, Shriver spoke of training lay
persons to act as "legal advocates for the poor," handlingtasks that historically had required lawyers. Private practitioners foresaw publicly funded competition for the strug-gling neighborhood lawyer. Complaints poured into ABA
headquarters, demanding that the organization mobilizeagainst the federal proposal, but Powell refused. Instead,
he placed his personal prestige on the line to forge an alli-ance between the federal anti-poverty activists and the
establishment lawyers of the ABA. Through delicate negotiations and personal leadership, Powell worked out a
compromise. The ABA agreed to support the federal program, and the OEO agreed to allow existing legal aid societies to participate in federal funding. The federal program

526BV$ Unit: UVII [12-08-00 17:15:17] PGT: FRT
xiv JUSTICE POWELL
was redesigned to protect the traditional independence of
lawyers and to make certain other concessions, and the energies committed to existing legal aid societies were now harnessed in the federal program. To everyone's astonishment,
Powell secured unanimous ABA endorsement of this arrangement and staged a "symbolic handshake" in which
Shriver announced a National Advisory Committee on which
Powell and other ABA leaders agreed to serve.

Years later, when Powell's nomination to the Supreme
Court came before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary,
Jean Camper Cahn, who had originally proposed the Legal
Services Program to Sargent Shriver, wrote an extraordinary 18-page letter recounting Powell's role in these tortuous
negotiations. She recounted how he had worked closely
with the all-black National Bar Association and how he had
invited her to become the first African-American lawyer,
male or female, to address a plenary session of the ABA, and
predicted that Powell would "go down in history as one of
the great statesmen of our profession."

In the late 1960's, Powell became increasingly prominent
as a conservative voice on crime. He used the ABA presidency as a bully pulpit, insisting on the rule of law, criticizing
civil disobedience on both the left and the right, and reminding everyone that the first duty of government is "to protect
citizens in their persons and property from criminal conduct--whatever its source or cause." In 1965, Lyndon Johnson named Powell to the President's Commission on Law Enforcement and the Administration of Justice. When its final
report, The Challenge of Crime in a Free Society, was published in 1967, Powell issued a "Supplemental Statement" (he
was careful not to call it a dissent), asking whether Miranda
v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966), had gone too far and suggesting the possibility of a constitutional amendment. Powell's speeches and his participation on the crime commission
established him as a critic of the Warren Court--a responsible and respectful, but unmistakably conservative, critic of
the Warren Court's work in criminal procedure.

xvJUSTICE POWELL
It was this reputation, coupled with Powell's long list ofaccomplishments and distinctions, that attracted the attention of President Richard Nixon. In 1969, when the Senaterejected the nomination of Clement Haynsworth of South
Carolina, Powell made the "short list" for appointment to theSupreme Court but withdrew from consideration. At 62,
he thought himself too old and, as he wrote the AttorneyGeneral, feared "that the nomination of another southern
lawyer with a business-oriented background would invite--
if not assure--organized and perhaps prolonged opposition."After the disastrous nomination of G. Harrold Carswell, the

President turned to Harry A. Blackmun of Minnesota, whowas confirmed without controversy in June 1970.

Barely a year later, the retirements of Justices Hugo Blackand John Marshall Harlan created two new vacancies, and
again attention turned to Powell. Twice the Attorney Gen-eral urged Powell to take the job, and twice Powell declined.
Finally, the President himself called, spoke of Powell's responsibility to the country, and insisted that it was Powell's
duty to accept appointment to the Supreme Court. When
this approach proved successful, President Nixon announcedthe nominations of Lewis F. Powell, Jr., of Virginia and William H. Rehnquist of Arizona to the Supreme Court. OnJanuary 7, 1972, they took their seats as the 99th and 100th
Justices of the Supreme Court.

Justice Powell served from that date until he retired, afew months short of his 80th birthday, in 1987. In those

years, neither liberals nor conservatives dominated the Su-preme Court. With left and right in ideological balance, the
Court embarked on a pragmatic search for justice, order, anddecency in a changing world. Surprisingly, Justice Powell,
whose pronouncements on criminal procedure had made himseem reliably conservative, found himself at the political center of a divided Court. Often, his was the decisive voice.
The record he compiled is not that of a dependable champion
of left or right but that of a thoughtful moderate, steadfast
in firm convictions but respectful of compromise, a judge
mindful of context and distrustful of sweeping generaliza526BV$ Unit: UVII [12-08-00 17:15:17] PGT: FRT
xvi JUSTICE POWELL
tion, and committed above all to the institution and the coun-try that he served.

Consideration of three areas will reveal Justice Powell'sexceptional impact on the development of American constitutional law. Abortion, affirmative action, and capital punish-ment were--and are--intensely controversial. In each of
these areas, Justice Powell confronted explosive constitu-tional questions which he had had little occasion to consider
before coming to the Court. In each of these areas, he
sought to bring his understanding of constitutional principlesand precedents to bear on deeply difficult questions that continue to divide both the Court and the country. In eacharea, his decisions reveal both this constancy in support of
strong convictions and his instinct for a middle course. Ineach area, his views had an uncommon impact on the course
of constitutional law.Justice Powell was in the majority in

Roe v. Wade, 410
U. S. 113 (1973), and in every other abortion decision during
his tenure. On the one hand, he steadfastly supported Roeagainst challenges and limitations, including attempts to require a parent or husband's consent. See Bellotti v. Baird,443 U. S. 622 (1979) (parental consent);

Planned Parenthood
v. Danforth, 428 U. S. 52 (1976) (spousal consent). On theother hand, he upheld laws directing an unmarried minor to

notify her parents before having an abortion (but not giving
them the power to veto her decision), H. L. v. Matheson, 450U. S. 398 (1981), and he consistently refused to require public

funding for abortion. See, e. g., Beal v. Doe, 432 U. S. 438(1977);

Harris v. McRae, 448 U. S. 297 (1980). More than
those of any other member of the Court, Justice Powell'svotes determined the content and scope of the constitutional

right to abortion.So it was also with affirmative action. In the famous
Bakke decision, Justice Powell made a "majority of one" to
tolerate racial preferences in higher education, but only as a
temporary and contested deviation from the ideal of colorblindness. Regents of the University of California v.
Bakke, 438 U. S. 265 (1978). Four Justices were prepared to

526BV$ Unit: UVII [12-08-00 17:15:17] PGT: FRT

xviiJUSTICE POWELL
allow minority preferences more or less without limitation,and four others interpreted a federal statute to disallow minority preferences more or less without exception. JusticePowell cast the deciding vote in both directions. On the one
hand, he thought it necessary that affirmative steps be per-mitted to overcome America's long history of racial oppression. On the other hand, he feared the entrenchment of aracial and ethnic spoils system that would prove permanently durable and socially divisive. Faced with these conflicting concerns, Justice Powell characteristically sought amiddle course. He tried to permit racial preferences without conceding their future, to authorize such preferenceswhile preserving the grounds of objection to them. In
short, Justice Powell sought both to allow and to curtailracial preferences.

The middle ground that Justice Powell staked out in Bakkewas filled in by thirteen additional affirmative action decisions during his tenure. In all of them, Justice Powell was
in the majority. In all of them, he struck a delicate balancebetween the necessity, as he saw it, of allowing some racial

preferences and the fear that racial quotas, once allowed,would become entrenched and permanent. Given the nearly
even division of opinion elsewhere, Justice Powell's approachproved decisive. Perhaps in no other area of constitutional
law have the individual views of a single Justice left such a
large mark. His legacy lies not in a resolute commitment toeither position but in the enduring ambivalence of the law's

reaction to racial preferences. Under the regime of JusticePowell's views, affirmative action has been widespread, familiar, and significantly successful. It has also been con-tested, resented, and increasingly curtailed. Both sides owe
something to the lonely wisdom of Lewis Powell.One question on which Justice Powell did have a clear view
on coming to the Court was the constitutionality of capital
punishment. The question was argued only ten days after
Justice Powell took his seat. He quickly concluded that the
Constitution's repeated references to capital punishment, its
long history of acceptance in this country, and the absence of

526BV$ Unit: UVII [12-08-00 17:15:17] PGT: FRT
xviii JUSTICE POWELL
contrary precedent dictated that the death penalty be up-held. He said so, forcefully and at length, in his dissent from

Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238, 414 (1972). That a major-ity of the Justices nevertheless determined to strike down
all existing laws might have been expected to end capitalpunishment, but public opinion turned the other way.
Thirty-five states promptly enacted new laws, and seventeenof them (in an effort to answer

Furman's concern with arbitrariness of administration) made death the mandatory penalty for certain broad classes of homicide. The Justices nowfaced a vast expansion of capital punishment for which they

themselves were directly responsible.In 1976, the Court heard five companion cases dealing with
a representative sample of the new statutes. Four Justicesvoted to uphold all the statutes; two others voted to strike
them all. The balance of power rested with Justices Stew-art, Powell, and Stevens, who issued a joint opinion approving the statutes that attempted to structure and guide sentencing discretion in capital cases but invalidating those thatmade the death penalty mandatory.

regime that has continued until today. Under this approach,
the Court respects the widespread legislative endorsementof capital punishment but insists on case-by-case scrutiny of

the fairness of its administration. Here too Justice Powell'sviews proved durably influential.

Abortion, affirmative action, and capital punishment re-main deeply divisive and controversial. Perhaps there will
be few who unreservedly endorse Justice Powell's positionon all three questions, yet we are united in our respect and
admiration for the man who produced them. In these and
other areas of constitutional adjudication, Lewis Powell
showed himself a careful, caring, and supremely thoughtful
jurist. In the words of his former clerk, J. Harvie Wilkinson, III, now Chief Judge of the United States Court of Ap526BV$ Unit: UVII [12-08-00 17:15:17] PGT: FRT

peals for the Fourth Circuit, Justice Powell will have his crit-ics: "Some of his votes are not easy to reconcile. Some of

his theory is not seamlessly consistent. . . . For those whoseek a comprehensive vision of constitutional law, Justice
Powell will not have provided it." But, Wilkinson added,"For those who seek a perspective grounded in realism and
leavened by decency, conscientious in detail and magnani-mous in spirit, solicitous of personal dignity and protective
of the public trust, there will never be a better Justice."Wilkinson,

A Tribute to Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr., 101Harv. L. Rev. 417, 420 (1987).

Wherefore, it is accordingly
RESOLVED that we, as representative members of theBar of the Supreme Court of the United States, express our

admiration and respect for Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr., oursadness at his death, and our condolences to his family; and
it is further

RESOLVED that the Solicitor General be asked to pre-sent these Resolutions to the Court and that the Attorney

General be asked to move that they be inscribed on theCourt's permanent records.

The Chief Justice said:
The Court recognizes the Attorney General of the UnitedStates.

Attorney General Reno addressed the Court as follows:
Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
Although his courtly manners and quiet confidence wouldlead others to think of him as a patrician, Lewis Powell was

not born to wealth. His father worked hard as a managerin a series of businesses when he was a child, and provided
opportunities to Lewis, Jr., that he himself had not had. As

xx JUSTICE POWELL
a schoolboy, Lewis Powell received an award for personalintegrity, an honor that would repeatedly be re-won in respect others had for him throughout his life.The Solicitor General has already described portions of the
Bar Resolution that detail Lewis Powell's splendid reputa-tion at the Bar and his tireless efforts in public service of all
kinds--including his chairmanship of the Richmond SchoolBoard during a time of unparalled challenge; his lasting initiatives as President of the American Bar Association; and
his exceptional service to this country in World War II.Each of these voluntary efforts would be reason enough for

the country to extol the memory of Lewis Powell.It is also fitting, I think, to mention that he also held the
highest offices of the American Bar Association and theAmerican College of Trial Lawyers. He served, as the Solicitor General has noted, as a member of President Johnson'sCommission on Law Enforcement and the Administration of
Justice, President Nixon's Blue Ribbon Defense Panel, the
National Advisory Committee on Legal Services to the Poor,the Virginia Constitutional Revision Commission, the Board

of Trustees of Washington and Lee University, and the Colo-nial Williamsburg Foundation.

It is fair to say that Lewis Powell, the Supreme CourtJustice drew deeply from the experience of Lewis Powell,
the attorney. He brought a cautious and highly sophisticated pragmatism to the Court, and a distrust of doctrinaire
prescriptions for complex problems. He characteristically
focused on the facts of the case before the Court, striving to
do justice in that case as well as fashion rules of general
applicability to govern other, similar circumstances. When
occasionally the effort to achieve a just result on the given
facts implied creation of a new rule of uncertain consequences, Justice Powell strove to do justice in the case while
endeavoring to limit the breadth of the Court's decision.
The informed `balancing' of competing interests became his
hallmark as a Justice. Particularly on the great issues that
tended to divide the country, Justice Powell's capacity to find

xxiJUSTICE POWELL
important elements of truth and justice on each side of thecontroversy became a powerful source of reconciliation and

healing.From the time he joined the Court in January of 1972 until
his retirement in June 1987, Justice Powell wrote more than600 opinions, approximately half of them for the Court.
Within a short time after his appointment, Justice Powellwas writing some of the Court's most important opinions.
In his very first Term, he wrote the Court's opinion in Kastigar v. United States, which established the ground rulesfor the modern application of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination in the context of immunizedtestimony.

Also within months of his appointment, Justice Powelldemonstrated his independence from the President who had
appointed him by writing for the Court in United States v.
United States District Court. In that case the Court rejected the government's assertion of an executive power to
wiretap persons without judicial supervision in cases involv-ing national security. But as his opinion for the Court in

Dalia v. United States would later demonstrate, the use of awarrantless entry to install eavesdropping equipment would
not in and of itself give rise to a Fourth Amendment viola-tion so long as the officers had received the approval of a
judge for the wiretapping itself.

Another decision from his early years on the Court,
Almeida-Sanchez v. United States would later develop into a
series of Fourth Amendment decisions prescribing carefully
nuanced rules to govern searches and seizures at the Nation's borders. Those decisions included United States v.
Brignoni-Ponce, United States v. Ortiz, and United States
v. Martinez-Fuerte. A similarly balanced approach can be
found in Justice Powell's opinions in a series of cases dealing
with the scope of the exclusionary rule.

Justice Powell was an especially authoritative voice in
cases involving public education. In his second Term, he
wrote the Court's decision in San Antonio Independent

526BV$ Unit: UVII [12-08-00 17:15:17] PGT: FRT
xxii JUSTICE POWELL
School District v. Rodriguez, holding that a publicly-fundededucation is not a fundamental right triggering strict scrutiny of the financial disparities that may exist between richand poor school districts. Yet the deference in

Rodriguez
to local control of public education was counterbalanced adecade later by the Court's holding that a state law prohibiting the children of undocumented aliens from attending pub-lic school violated the Constitution. Justice Powell wrote in
his concurring opinion in Plyler v. Doe, `The classification
at issue deprives a group of children of the opportunity foreducation afforded all other children simply because they

have been assigned a legal status due to a violation of lawby their parents. These children, thus, have been singled
out for a lifelong penalty and stigma. A legislative classifi-cation that threatens the creation of an underclass of future
citizens and residents cannot be reconciled with one of thefundamental purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment.'

Similarly, in a series of opinions under the Equal Protection Clause involving gender discrimination, Justice Powellapplied mid-level scrutiny with telling effect--resulting in

the Court's invalidation of gender-based discrimination inthe military, the ability of pregnant teachers to work, the
dissemination of social security benefits, the sale of 3.2 beer,and the rules requiring consent for adoption by an unwed
mother but not an unwed father.

Justice Powell will, of course, long be remembered for his
eloquent opinion in the Bakke case, which struck down racial
quotas but upheld the use of race as a factor in determining
who will be admitted to a state professional school. His
opinion, although not joined in its entirety by any other Justice, controlled the outcome of the case and serves to this
day as a beacon for all who would seek to find constructive
common ground on issues of profound divisiviness.

In many other areas of the law, Justice Powell's opinions
for the Court have left an enduring legacy. He was a leading voice in the Court's modern antitrust jurisprudence.
His opinion in Batson v. Kentucky struck down the use of

526BV$ Unit: UVII [12-08-00 17:15:17] PGT: FRT

xxiiiJUSTICE POWELL
peremptory challenges to jurors on the basis of race. His
opinion in Mathews v. Eldridge established the essential
rules of procedural due process that continue to determine
the constitutionality of governmental restrictions on a person's rights to liberty or property. His opinion in Village
of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development
Corporation made clear that while discriminatory impact
alone is insufficient to establish a constitutional violation, an
intent to discriminate is susceptible of proof in practical
ways. And in Central Hudson Gas & Electric Company v.
Public Service Commission, Justice Powell's opinion articulated the essential criteria for evaluating the validity of governmental restrictions on commercial speech.

There are many other areas in which Justice Powell's
views helped to shape this Court's jurisprudence. For example, in 44 cases involving the Religion Clauses of the First
Amendment, Justice Powell was in the majority 93 percent
of the time--by far the highest percentage of any Justice
with whom he served. As the Solicitor General has noted,
in the abortion cases decided during his tenure, he was in the
majority 100 percent of the time, from Roe v. Wade through
Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, even as the contentious issues of consent, public
funding, and state restrictions commanded different majorities on the Court.

Lewis Powell recognized, in his many areas of endeavor,
that individuals can make a significant difference in this
world. The attributes that marked his life journey are ones
everyone can admire: his determination in finding solutions
to human problems, his unfailing courtesy to others, and his
dedication to achieving results that helped diverse factions
find common ground.

Mr. Chief Justice, on behalf of the lawyers of this Nation and particularly the Bar of this Court, I respectfully
request that the Resolutions presented to you be accepted
by this Court, and that they, together with the chronicle of

526BV$ Unit: UVII [12-08-00 17:15:17] PGT: FRT
xxiv JUSTICE POWELL
these proceedings, be ordered kept for all time in the records
of this Court.

The Chief Justice said:
Thank you, Attorney General Reno, thank you General
Waxman for your presentation today in memory of our late
friend and colleague, Lewis Powell.

We also extend to Chairman John Jeffries and the members of the Committee on Resolutions, Chairman William
Kelly and the members of the Arrangements Committee, and
Assistant Attorney General Joel Klein, Chairman of today's
meeting of the Supreme Court Bar, our appreciation for the
Resolutions you have provided today. Your motion that
they be made part of the permanent record of the Court is
hereby granted.

Lewis Powell was nominated to be an Associate Justice of
this Court at age 64 in October 1971. It is fair to say he
did not seek office--public office sought him. As the Bar
Resolutions and the Attorney General have noted, Lewis
Powell had a firmly established reputation as a leader of the
Bar of his native Richmond, of his native State of Virginia,
and of the United States.

Of 16 Justices, with whom I have served in more than 27
years on the Court, I think that only 2 would be long remembered in the annals of legal history had they not been appointed to the Supreme Court. Thurgood Marshall was one,
and Lewis Powell was the other. Thurgood Marshall would
have been remembered for the prominent up-front role he
played in litigating landmark civil rights cases in the 1940's
and 1950's. Lewis Powell would have been remembered for
his building of Hunton & Williams into a national firm in a
city the size of Richmond, Virginia, as president of the American Bar Association, president of the American College of
Trial Lawyers, and a member of several blue-ribbon commissions. Byron White would have been remembered for his
athletic accomplishments, but as for the rest of us; had we

526BV$ Unit: UVII [12-08-00 17:15:17] PGT: FRT

xxvJUSTICE POWELL
not been appointed to the Supreme Court, we would havebeen perhaps more affluent, but certainly less well known.

Lewis Powell was a bear for work. During his 15 yeartenure, he wrote over 600 opinions. The Bar Resolutions,
the Solicitor General, and the Attorney General have pointedout the major contributions that Justice Powell made to the
body of decisional law during his 15 year tenure on thisCourt. Virtually all of the opinions thus mentioned decide
questions of constitutional law, and it is understandable that
this should be so. I want to point out one opinion whichLewis Powell wrote that did not involve a constitutional

question, but which is probably the most frequently citedopinion in briefs today of any opinion from the Court.

That case is Harlow v. Fitzgerald, which was decided in1982. There we held in an opinion by Justice Powell that
high ranking officials of the Executive Branch--and thatholding has since been extended to most public officials exercising discretionary authority--are entitled to qualified
immunity against suits for damages. More importantly, thequalified immunity is to be based on the objective reasonableness of the actions of the officials. Before Harlow, therewas a subjective element involved which as a practical matter prevented summary judgment before discovery in justabout every case.

As the Bar Resolutions have pointed out, but I none the
less would like to emphasize, the Supreme Court appoint-ment was not the first call to duty heeded by Lewis Powell.

In 1941, at the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, he was34 years old, 7 years out of law school, and a partner at Hunton and Williams. He had two children at the time, andwould have been excluded from the draft, but he nonetheless
volunteered and was commissioned a First Lieutenant in theU. S. Army Air Force. He rose in rank to Colonel, he won
the Legion of Merit and the Bronze Star, serving overseas
with distinction as an Intelligence Officer in the Air Force
for four years during World War II and its aftermath.

He served here at the Court with equal distinction. He
brought a rare combination of ability, fair-mindedness, and

xxvi JUSTICE POWELL
grace to the Court. He had the consummate judicial tem-perament. His capacity and willingness to see both sides of

an issue, and his manner in persuading others to his ownviews resulted in his extraordinary influence during his
tenure here.Those of us who served with him during his 15 years on
the Court cherished his intellect and gentlemanly charm.He managed to present his views in Conference forcefully
without departing from his naturally gracious manner, par-ticularly towards colleagues who expressed opposing views.
Those of us who served with him continue to miss him. OurNation is the better for his having served it in the many
ways that he did.

CASES ADJUDGED

IN THE

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

AT
OCTOBER TERM, 1998

HOLLOWAY aka ALI v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe second circuit

No. 97-7164. Argued November 9, 1998--Decided March 2, 1999
Petitioner was charged with federal offenses including carjacking, which

18 U. S. C. $ 2119 defines as "tak[ing] a motor vehicle . . . from . . .
another by force and violence or by intimidation" "with the intent to
cause death or serious bodily harm." Petitioner's accomplice testified
that their plan was to steal cars without harming the drivers, but that
he would have used his gun if any of the victims had given him a "hard
time." The District Judge instructed the jury, inter alia, that the intent requisite under $ 2119 may be conditional, and that the Government
satisfies this element of the offense when it proves that the defendant
intended to cause death or serious bodily harm if the alleged victims
refused to turn over their cars. The jury found petitioner guilty, and
the Second Circuit affirmed, declaring, among other things, that the inclusion of a conditional intent to harm within $ 2119 comported with a
reasonable interpretation of the legislative purpose. Petitioner's alternative interpretation, which would cover only those carjackings in which
defendant's sole and unconditional purpose at the time of the offense
was to kill or maim the victim, was clearly at odds with Congress' intent, concluded the court.

Held: Section 2119's "with the intent to cause death or serious bodily

harm" phrase does not require the Government to prove that the defendant had an unconditional intent to kill or harm in all events, but
merely requires proof of an intent to kill or harm if necessary to effect
a carjacking. This mens rea component of $ 2119 directs the factfinder's

Syllabus
attention to the defendant's state of mind at the precise moment he
demanded or took control over the car "by force and violence or by
intimidation." If the defendant has the proscribed state of mind at that
moment, the statute's scienter element is satisfied. Petitioner's reading--that the defendant must possess a specific and unconditional intent to kill or harm in order to complete the prescribed offense--would
improperly transform the mens rea element from a modifier into an
additional actus reus component of the carjacking statute; it would
alter the statute into one that focuses on attempting to harm or kill a
person in the course of the robbery of a motor vehicle. Given that

$ 2119 does not mention either conditional or unconditional intent separately--and thus does not expressly exclude either--its text is most
naturally read to encompass the mens rea of both species of intent,
and not to limit its reach to crimes involving the additional actus reus
of an attempt to kill or harm. Two considerations strongly support
the Court's conclusion. First, petitioner's interpretation would exclude
from the coverage of the statute most of the conduct that Congress
obviously intended to prohibit. Second, it is reasonable to presume
that Congress was familiar with the leading cases and the scholarly
writing recognizing that the specific intent to commit a wrongful act
may be conditional. The Court's interpretation does not, as petitioner
suggests, render superfluous the statute's "by force and violence or
by intimidation" element. While an empty threat, or intimidating
bluff, would be sufficient to satisfy that element, such conduct, standing on its own, is not enough to satisfy $ 2119's specific intent element.

Opinion of the Court
Deputy Solicitor General Dreeben, Edward C. DuMont, andDeborah Watson.*

Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court.
Carjacking "with the intent to cause death or seriousbodily harm" is a federal crime.

1 The question presented in

this case is whether that phrase requires the Government toprove that the defendant had an unconditional intent to kill

or harm in all events, or whether it merely requires proof ofan intent to kill or harm if necessary to effect a carjacking.
Most of the judges who have considered the question haveconcluded, as do we, that Congress intended to criminalize
the more typical carjacking carried out by means of a de-liberate threat of violence, rather than just the rare case in
which the defendant has an unconditional intent to use vio-lence regardless of how the driver responds to his threat.

Opinion of the Court
cars.2 In each of the carjackings, petitioner and an armedaccomplice identified a car that they wanted and followed it

until it was parked. The accomplice then approached thedriver, produced a gun, and threatened to shoot unless the
driver handed over the car keys.3 The accomplice testifiedthat the plan was to steal the cars without harming the victims, but that he would have used his gun if any of the driv-ers had given him a "hard time." App. 52. When one victim hesitated, petitioner punched him in the face, but therewas no other actual violence.

The District Judge instructed the jury that the Govern-ment was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that
the taking of a motor vehicle was committed with the intent"to cause death or serious bodily harm to the person from
whom the car was taken." Id., at 29. After explaining thatmerely using a gun to frighten a victim was not sufficient to
prove such intent, he added the following statement overpetitioner's objection:

"In some cases, intent is conditional. That is, a defend-ant may intend to engage in certain conduct only if a
certain event occurs."In this case, the government contends that the defendant intended to cause death or serious bodily harmif the alleged victims had refused to turn over their cars.
If you find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendanthad such an intent, the government has satisfied this
element of the offense. . . ." Id., at 30.
In his postverdict motion for a new trial, petitioner con-tended that this instruction was inconsistent with the text

2 He was also charged with conspiring to operate a "chop shop" in violation of 18 U. S. C. $ 371, operating a chop shop in violation of $ 2322, and
using and carrying a firearm in violation of $ 924(c).

3 One victim testified that the accomplice produced his gun and threatened, " `Get out of the car or I'll shoot.' " App. 51. Another testified that
he said, " `Give me your keys or I will shoot you right now.' " Id., at 52.

Opinion of the Court
of the statute. The District Judge denied the motion, stating that there "is no question that the conduct at issue in
this case is precisely what Congress and the general public
would describe as carjacking, and that Congress intended to
prohibit it in $ 2119." 921 F. Supp. 155, 156 (EDNY 1996).
He noted that the statute as originally enacted in 1992 contained no intent element but covered all carjackings committed by a person "possessing a firearm." A 1994 amendment had omitted the firearm limitation, thus broadening
the coverage of the statute to encompass the use of other
weapons, and also had inserted the intent requirement at
issue in this case. The judge thought that an "odd result"
would flow from a construction of the amendment that
"would no longer prohibit the very crime it was enacted to
address except in those unusual circumstances when carjackers also intended to commit another crime--murder or
a serious assault." Id., at 159. Moreover, the judge determined that even though the issue of conditional intent
has not been discussed very often, at least in the federal
courts, it was a concept that scholars and state courts had
long recognized.

Over a dissent that accused the majority of "a clear judicial usurpation of congressional authority," United States v.
Arnold, 126 F. 3d 82, 92 (CA2 1997) (opinion of Miner, J.),
the Court of Appeals affirmed. The majority was satisfied
that "the inclusion of a conditional intent to harm within the
definition of specific intent to harm" was not only "a wellestablished principle of criminal common law," but also, and
"most importantly," comported "with a reasonable interpretation of the legislative purpose of the statute." Id., at 88.
The alternative interpretation, which would cover "only
those carjackings in which the carjacker's sole and unconditional purpose at the time he committed the carjacking was
to kill or maim the victim," the court concluded, was clearly
at odds with the intent of the statute's drafters. Ibid.

6 HOLLOWAY v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
To resolve an apparent conflict with a decision of the NinthCircuit, United States v. Randolph, 93 F. 3d 656 (1996),

4 we

granted certiorari. 523 U. S. 1093 (1998).

II
Writing for the Court in United States v. Turkette, 452U. S. 576, 593 (1981), Justice White reminded us that the language of the statutes that Congress enacts provides "themost reliable evidence of its intent." For that reason, we
typically begin the task of statutory construction by focusingon the words that the drafters have chosen. In interpreting
the statute at issue, "[w]e consider not only the bare mean-ing" of the critical word or phrase "but also its placement
and purpose in the statutory scheme." Bailey v. United
States, 516 U. S. 137, 145 (1995).The specific issue in this case is what sort of evil motive

Congress intended to describe when it used the words "withthe intent to cause death or serious bodily harm" in the 1994
amendment to the carjacking statute. More precisely, thequestion is whether a person who points a gun at a driver,
having decided to pull the trigger if the driver does not com-ply with a demand for the car keys, possesses the intent, at
that moment, to seriously harm the driver. In our view, the

4 The Ninth Circuit held that neither a person's mere threat to the driver
that " `she would be okay if she [did] what was told of her' " nor "the
brandishing of a weapon, without more" constituted an intent to cause
death or serious bodily harm under the amended version of $ 2119. 93 F.
3d, at 664-665. The court therefore reversed the defendant's carjacking
conviction on the ground of insufficient evidence. In the course of its
opinion, the Ninth Circuit also stated more broadly that "[t]he mere conditional intent to harm a victim if she resists is simply not enough to
satisfy $ 2119's new specific intent requirement." Id., at 665. It is this
proposition with which other courts have disagreed. See United States
v. Williams, 136 F. 3d 547, 550-551 (CA8 1998), cert. pending, No. 97-9553;

Opinion of the Court
answer to that question does not depend on whether thedriver immediately hands over the keys or what the offender

decides to do after he gains control over the car. At therelevant moment, the offender plainly does have the forbidden intent.

The opinions that have addressed this issue accuratelypoint out that a carjacker's intent to harm his victim may

be either "conditional" or "unconditional." 5 The statutoryphrase at issue theoretically might describe (1) the former,
(2) the latter, or (3) both species of intent. Petitioner arguesthat the "plain text" of the statute "unequivocally" describes
only the latter: that the defendant must possess a specificand unconditional intent to kill or harm in order to complete
the proscribed offense. To that end, he insists that Con-gress would have had to insert the words "if necessary" into
the disputed text in order to include the conditional species
of intent within the scope of the statute. See Reply Brief
for Petitioner 2. Because Congress did not include those
words, petitioner contends that we must assume that Congress meant to provide a federal penalty for only those carjackings in which the offender actually attempted to harm
or kill the driver (or at least intended to do so whether or
not the driver resisted).

We believe, however, that a commonsense reading of the
carjacking statute counsels that Congress intended to criminalize a broader scope of conduct than attempts to assault
or kill in the course of automobile robberies. As we have
repeatedly stated, " `the meaning of statutory language, plain
or not, depends on context.' " Brown v. Gardner, 513 U. S.
115, 118 (1994) (quoting King v. St. Vincent's Hospital, 502
U. S. 215, 221 (1991)). When petitioner's argument is considered in the context of the statute, it becomes apparent
that his proffered construction of the intent element overlooks the significance of the placement of that element in

8 HOLLOWAY v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
the statute. The carjacking statute essentially is aimedat providing a federal penalty for a particular type of robbery. The statute's mens rea component thus modifies theact of "tak[ing]" the motor vehicle. It directs the factfinder's attention to the defendant's state of mind at the pre-cise moment he demanded or took control over the car "by
force and violence or by intimidation." If the defendant hasthe proscribed state of mind at that moment, the statute's
scienter element is satisfied.Petitioner's reading of the intent element, in contrast,
would improperly transform the mens rea element from amodifier into an additional

actus reus component of thecarjacking statute; it would alter the statute into one that

focuses on attempting to harm or kill a person in the courseof the robbery of a motor vehicle.

6 Indeed, if we accepted

petitioner's view of the statute's intent element, even Con-gress' insertion of the qualifying words "if necessary," by

themselves, would not have solved the deficiency that hebelieves exists in the statute. The inclusion of those words
after the intent phrase would have excluded the uncondi-tional species of intent--the intent to harm or kill even if
not necessary to complete a carjacking. Accordingly, if Con-gress had used words such as "if necessary" to describe the
conditional species of intent, it would also have needed toadd something like "or even if not necessary" in order to
cover both species of intent to harm. Given the fact thatthe actual text does not mention either species separately--
and thus does not expressly exclude either--that text is mostnaturally read to encompass the mens rea of both conditional
and unconditional intent, and not to limit the statute's reachto crimes involving the additional actus reus of an attempt
to kill or harm.

6 Although subsections (2) and (3) of the carjacking statute envision
harm or death resulting from the crime, subsection (1), under petitioner's
reading, would have to cover attempts to harm or kill when no serious
bodily harm resulted.

Opinion of the Court
Two considerations strongly support the conclusion that anatural reading of the text is fully consistent with a congressional decision to cover both species of intent. First, thestatute as a whole reflects an intent to authorize federal
prosecutions as a significant deterrent to a type of criminal
activity that was a matter of national concern.7 Becausethat purpose is better served by construing the statute to

cover both the conditional and the unconditional species ofwrongful intent, the entire statute is consistent with a normal interpretation of the specific language that Congresschose. See

John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Harris Trust
and Sav. Bank, 510 U. S. 86, 94-95 (1993) (statutory languageshould be interpreted consonant with "the provisions of the

whole law, and . . . its object and policy" (internal quotationmarks omitted)). Indeed, petitioner's interpretation would
exclude from the coverage of the statute most of the conduct
that Congress obviously intended to prohibit.

Second, it is reasonable to presume that Congress was
familiar with the cases and the scholarly writing that have
recognized that the "specific intent" to commit a wrongful
act may be conditional. See Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U. S. 677, 696-698 (1979). The facts of the leading
case on the point are strikingly similar to the facts of this
case. In People v. Connors, 253 Ill. 266, 97 N. E. 643 (1912),

7 Although the legislative history relating to the carjacking amendment
is sparse, those members of Congress who recorded comments made statements reflecting the statute's broad deterrent purpose. See 139 Cong.
Rec. 27867 (1993) (statement of Sen. Lieberman) ("Th[e 1994] amendment
will broaden and strengthen th[e] [carjacking] law so our U. S. attorneys
will have every possible tool available to them to attack the problem");
140 Cong. Rec. E858 (May 5, 1994) (extension of remarks by Rep. Franks)
("We must send a message to [carjackers] that committing a violent crime
will carry a severe penalty"). There is nothing in the 1994 amendment's
legislative history to suggest that Congress meant to create a federal
crime for only the unique and unusual subset of carjackings in which the
offender intends to harm or kill the driver regardless of whether the
driver accedes to the offender's threat of violence.

10 HOLLOWAY v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
the Illinois Supreme Court affirmed the conviction of a union
organizer who had pointed a gun at a worker and threatened
to kill him forthwith if he did not take off his overalls and
quit work. The court held that the jury had been properly
instructed that the "specific intent to kill" could be found
even though that intent was "coupled with a condition" that
the defendant would not fire if the victim complied with his
demand.8 That holding has been repeatedly cited with
approval by other courts 9 and by scholars.10 Moreover, it
reflects the views endorsed by the authors of the Model

8 The trial judge had given this instruction to the jury:
" `The court instructs you as to the intent to kill alleged in the indictment
that though you must find that there was a specific intent to kill the prosecuting witness, Morgan H. Bell, still, if you believe from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the intention of the defendants was only in
the alternative--that is, if the defendants, or any of them, acting for and
with the others, then and there pointed a revolver at the said Bell with
the intention of compelling him to take off his overalls and quit work, or
to kill him if he did not--and if that specific intent was formed in the
minds of the defendants and the shooting of the said Bell with intent to
kill was only prevented by the happening of the alternative--that is, the
compliance of the said Bell with the demand that he take off his overalls
and quit work--then the requirement of the law as to the specific intent
is met.' " 253 Ill., at 272-273, 97 N. E., at 645.

Opinion of the Court
Criminal Code.11 The core principle that emerges fromthese sources is that a defendant may not negate a proscribed intent by requiring the victim to comply with a con-dition the defendant has no right to impose; "[a]n intent to
kill, in the alternative, is nevertheless an intent to kill." 12This interpretation of the statute's specific intent element
does not, as petitioner suggests, render superfluous the stat-ute's "by force and violence or by intimidation" element.
While an empty threat, or intimidating bluff, would be suf-ficient to satisfy the latter element, such conduct, standing
on its own, is not enough to satisfy $ 2119's specific intentelement.

13 In a carjacking case in which the driver surrendered or otherwise lost control over his car without thedefendant attempting to inflict, or actually inflicting, serious

bodily harm, Congress' inclusion of the intent element re11 Section 2.02(6) of the Model Penal Code provides:
"Requirement of Purpose Satisfied if Purpose is Conditional.
"When a particular purpose is an element of an offense, the element is
established although such purpose is conditional, unless the condition
negatives the harm or evil sought to be prevented by the law defining the
offense." American Law Institute, Model Penal Code (1985).

Of course, in this case the condition that the driver surrender the car
was the precise evil that Congress wanted to prevent.

12 Perkins & Boyce, Criminal Law, at 647.

13 In somewhat different contexts, courts have held that a threat to harm

does not in itself constitute intent to harm or kill. In Hairston v. State,
54 Miss. 689 (1877), for example, the defendant in an angry and profane
manner threatened to shoot a person if that person stopped the defendant's mules. The court affirmed the defendant's conviction for assault,
but reversed a conviction of assault with intent to commit murder, explaining that "we have found no case of a conviction of assault with intent to
kill or murder, upon proof only of the levelling of a gun or pistol." Id., at
694. See also Myers v. Clearman, 125 Iowa 461, 464, 101 N. W. 193, 194
(1904) (in determining whether defendant acted with intent to commit
great bodily harm the issue for the jury was "whether the accused, in
aiming his revolver at [the victim], intended to inflict great bodily harm,
or some more serious offense, or did this merely with the purpose of
frightening her").

12 HOLLOWAY v. UNITED STATES

Scalia, J., dissenting
quires the Government to prove beyond a reasonable doubtthat the defendant would have at least attempted to seriously harm or kill the driver if that action had been neces-sary to complete the taking of the car.

In short, we disagree with petitioner's reading of the textof the Act and think it unreasonable to assume that Congress
intended to enact such a truncated version of an importantcriminal statute.

14 The intent requirement of $ 2119 is satisfied when the Government proves that at the moment thedefendant demanded or took control over the driver's automobile the defendant possessed the intent to seriously harmor kill the driver if necessary to steal the car (or, alternatively, if unnecessary to steal the car). Accordingly, weaffirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

It is so ordered.
Justice Scalia, dissenting.
The issue in this case is the meaning of the phrase, in 18U. S. C. $ 2119, "with the intent to cause death or serious

bodily harm." (For convenience' sake, I shall refer to itin this opinion as simply intent to kill.) As recounted by
the Court, petitioner's accomplice, Vernon Lennon, "testi-fied that the plan was to steal the cars without harming
the victims, but that he would have used his gun if any ofthe drivers had given him a `hard time.' "

Ante, at 4. TheDistrict Court instructed the jury that the intent element

would be satisfied if petitioner possessed this "conditional"

14 We also reject petitioner's argument that the rule of lenity should
apply in this case. We have repeatedly stated that " `[t]he rule of lenity
applies only if, after seizing everything from which aid can be derived, . . .
we can make no more than a guess as to what Congress intended.' " Muscarello v. United States, 524 U. S. 125, 138 (1998) (quoting United States
v. Wells, 519 U. S. 482, 499 (1997)) (additional quotations and citations omitted). Accord, Ladner v. United States, 358 U. S. 169, 178 (1958). The
result of our preceding analysis requires us to make no such guess in
this case.

I dissent from that holding because I disagree with thefollowing, utterly central, passage of the opinion:

remote in the speaker's estimation as to be effectively non-existent--and it

never connotes a purpose that is subject
to a condition which the speaker hopes will not occur. (It is
this last sort of "conditional intent" that is at issue in thiscase, and that I refer to in my subsequent use of the term.)

"Intent" is "[a] state of mind in which a person seeks to ac-complish a given result through a course of action." Black's
Law Dictionary 810 (6th ed. 1990). One can hardly "seek toaccomplish" a result he hopes will not ensue.

The Court's division of intent into two categories, con-ditional and unconditional, makes the unreasonable seem
logical. But Aristotelian classification says nothing about
linguistic usage. Instead of identifying two categories, theCourt might just as readily have identified

three: unconditional intent, conditional intent, and feigned intent. But thesecond category, like the third, is simply not conveyed by the

word "intent" alone. There is intent, conditional intent, and
feigned intent, just as there is agreement, conditional agreement, and feigned agreement--but to say that in either case
the noun alone, without qualification, "theoretically might
describe" all three phenomena is simply false. Conditional
intent is no more embraced by the unmodified word "intent"
than a sea lion is embraced by the unmodified word "lion."

14 HOLLOWAY v. UNITED STATES

Scalia, J., dissenting
If I have made a categorical determination to go to Louisi-ana for the Christmas holidays, it is accurate for me to say

that I "intend" to go to Louisiana. And that is so eventhough I realize that there are some remote and unlikely
contingencies--"acts of God," for example--that might prevent me. (The fact that these remote contingencies arealways implicit in the expression of intent accounts for the

humorousness of spelling them out in such expressions as"if I should live so long," or "the Good Lord willing and
the creek don't rise.") It is less precise, though tolerableusage, to say that I "intend" to go if my purpose is conditional upon an event which, though not virtually certain to
happen (such as my continuing to live), is reasonably likely
to happen, and which I hope will happen. I might, for example, say that I "intend" to go even if my plans depend
upon receipt of my usual and hoped-for end-of-year bonus.

But it is not common usage--indeed, it is an unheard-of
usage--to speak of my having an "intent" to do something,
when my plans are contingent upon an event that is not virtually certain, and that I hope will not occur. When a friend
is seriously ill, for example, I would not say that "I intend
to go to his funeral next week." I would have to make it
clear that the intent is a conditional one: "I intend to go to his
funeral next week if he dies." The carjacker who intends to
kill if he is met with resistance is in the same position: He
has an "intent to kill if resisted"; he does not have an "intent
to kill." No amount of rationalization can change the reality
of this normal (and as far as I know exclusive) English usage.
The word in the statute simply will not bear the meaning
that the Court assigns.

The Government makes two contextual arguments to
which I should respond. First, it points out that the statute
criminalizes not only carjackings accomplished by "force and
violence" but also those accomplished by mere "intimidation." Requiring an unconditional intent, it asserts, would
make the number of covered carjackings accomplished by in526US1 Unit: $U26 [12-08-00 19:03:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Scalia, J., dissenting
timidation "implausibly small." Brief for United States 22.That seems to me not so. It is surely not an unusual carjacking in which the criminal jumps into the passenger seatand forces the person behind the wheel to drive off at gunpoint. A carjacker who intends to kill may well use this
modus operandi, planning to kill the driver in a moresecluded location. Second, the Government asserts that it

would be hard to imagine an unconditional-intent-to-kill casein which the first penalty provision of $ 2119 would apply,
i. e., the provision governing cases in which no death orbodily harm has occurred.

Id., at 23. That is rather like
saying that the crime of attempted murder should not exist,
because someone who intends to kill always succeeds.

Notwithstanding the clear ordinary meaning of the word
"intent," it would be possible, though of course quite unusual, for the word to have acquired a different meaning
in the criminal law. The Court does not claim--and falls far
short of establishing--such "term-of-art" status. It cites
five state cases (representing the majority view among the
minority of jurisdictions that have addressed the question)
saying that conditional intent satisfies an intent requirement; but it acknowledges that there are cases in other jurisdictions to the contrary. See ante, at 10, n. 9 (citing State
v. Irwin, 55 N. C. App. 305, 285 S. E. 2d 345 (1982); State v.
Kinnemore, 34 Ohio App. 2d 39, 295 N. E. 2d 680 (1972));
see also Craddock v. State, 204 Miss. 606, 37 So. 2d 778 (1948);
McArdle v. State, 372 So. 2d 897 (Ala. Crim. App.), writ denied, 372 So. 2d 902 (Ala. 1979). As I understand the Court's
position, it is not that the former cases are right and the
latter wrong, so that "intent" in criminal statutes, a term of
art in that context, includes conditional intent; but rather
that "intent" in criminal statutes may include conditional intent, depending upon the statute in question. That seems
to me not an available option. It is so utterly clear in normal usage that "intent" does not include conditional intent,
that only an accepted convention in the criminal law could

Scalia, J., dissenting
give the word a different meaning. And an accepted con-vention is not established by the fact that some courts have

thought so some times. One must decide, I think, which lineof cases is correct, and in my judgment it is that which rejects the conditional-intent rule.

There are of course innumerable federal criminal statutescontaining an intent requirement, ranging from intent to

steal, see 18 U. S. C. $ 2113, to intent to defeat the provi-sions of the Bankruptcy Code, see $ 152(5), to intent that a
vessel be used in hostilities against a friendly nation, see$ 962, to intent to obstruct the lawful exercise of parental
rights, see $ 1204. Consider, for example, 21 U. S. C. $ 841,
which makes it a crime to possess certain drugs with intent
to distribute them. Possession alone is also a crime, but a

lesser one, see $ 844. Suppose that a person acquires and
possesses a small quantity of cocaine for his own use, and
that he in fact consumes it entirely himself. But assume
further that, at the time he acquired the drug, he told his
wife not to worry about the expense because, if they had
an emergency need for money, he could always resell it. If
conditional intent suffices, this person, who has never sold
drugs and has never "intended" to sell drugs in any normal
sense, has been guilty of possession with intent to distribute.
Or consider 18 U. S. C. $ 2390, which makes it a crime to
enlist within the United States "with intent to serve in
armed hostility against the United States." Suppose a Canadian enlists in the Canadian army in the United States,
intending, of course, to fight all of Canada's wars, including
(though he neither expects nor hopes for it) a war against
the United States. He would be criminally liable. These
examples make it clear, I think, that the doctrine of conditional intent cannot reasonably be applied across-the-board
to the criminal code. I am unaware that any equivalent absurdities result from reading "intent" to mean what it says--
a conclusion strongly supported by the fact that the Government has cited only a single case involving another federal

statute, from over two centuries of federal criminal jurisprudence, applying the conditional-intent doctrine (and that in
circumstances where it would not at all have been absurd to
require real intent).1 The course selected by the Court, of
course--"intent" is sometimes conditional and sometimes
not--would require us to sift through these many statutes

1 The one case the Government has come up with is Shaffer v. United
States, 308 F. 2d 654 (CA5 1962), cert. denied, 373 U. S. 939 (1963), which
upheld a conviction of assault "with intent to do bodily harm" where the
defendant had said that if any persons tried to leave the building within
five minutes after his departure "he would shoot their heads off," 308
F. 2d, at 655. In my view, and in normal parlance, the defendant did not
"intend" to do bodily harm, and there would have been nothing absurd
about holding to that effect.

The Government cites six other federal cases, Brief for United States
14-15, n. 5, but they are so inapposite that they succeed only in demonstrating the weakness of its assertion that conditional intent is the federal rule. Two of them, United States v. Richardson, 27 F. Cas. 798 (No.
16,155) (CCDC 1837), and United States v. Myers, 27 F. Cas. 43 (No. 15,845)
(CCDC 1806), involve convictions for simple assault with no specific intent,
and do not even contain any dictum bearing upon the present question.
A third, United States v. Arrellano, 812 F. 2d 1209, 1212, n. 2 (CA9 1987),
contains nothing but dictum, since the jury found no intent of any sort.
A fourth, United States v. Marks, 29 M. J. 1 (Ct. Mil. App. 1989), involved
a defendant who tried to set fire to material that he assertedly believed
was flame resistant. The crime he was convicted of, aggravated arson,
was, as the court specifically stated, "a general intent crime," id., at 3.
And the last two cases, United States v. Dworken, 855 F. 2d 12 (CA1 1988),
and United States v. Anello, 765 F. 2d 253 (CA1), cert. denied sub nom.
Wendolkowski v. United States, 474 U. S. 996 (1985), both involved conspiracy to possess drugs with intent to distribute. Defendants contended that
they could not be convicted because they did not intend to complete the
conspired-for transaction unless the quality of the drugs (and, in the case
of Dworken, the price as well) was satisfactory. Of course the intent necessary to conspire for a specific-intent crime is not the same as the intent
necessary for the crime itself, particularly insofar as antecedent conditions are concerned. And in any event, since it can hardly be thought
that the conspirators wanted the quality and price of the drugs to be inadequate, neither case involved the conditional intent that is the subject of
the present case.

one-by-one, making our decision on the basis of such ephem-eral indications of "congressional purpose" as the Court has

used in this case, to which I now turn.Ultimately, the Court rests its decision upon the fact that
the purpose of the statute--which it says is deterring carjacking--"is better served by construing the statute to coverboth the conditional and the unconditional species of wrongful intent." Ante, at 9. It supports this statement, bothpremise and conclusion, by two unusually uninformative
statements from the legislative history (to stand out in thatrespect in that realm is quite an accomplishment) that speak
generally about strengthening and broadening the carjacking statute and punishing carjackers severely. Ante, at 9,
n. 7. But every statute intends not only to achieve certain
policy objectives, but to achieve them by the means specified.
Limitations upon the means employed to achieve the policy
goal are no less a "purpose" of the statute than the policy
goal itself. See Director, Office of Workers' Compensation
Programs v. Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co.,
514 U. S. 122, 135-136 (1995). Under the Court's analysis,
any interpretation of the statute that would broaden its
reach would further the purpose the Court has found. Such
reasoning is limitless and illogical.

The Court confidently asserts that "petitioner's interpretation would exclude from the coverage of the statute most
of the conduct that Congress obviously intended to prohibit."
Ante, at 9. It seems to me that one can best judge what
Congress "obviously intended" not by intuition, but by the
words that Congress enacted, which in this case require intent (not conditional intent) to kill. Is it implausible that
Congress intended to define such a narrow federal crime?
Not at all. The era when this statute was passed contained
well publicized instances of not only carjackings, and not
only carjackings involving violence or the threat of violence
(as, of course, most of them do); but also of carjackings in
which the perpetrators senselessly harmed the car owners

when that was entirely unnecessary to the crime. I have afriend whose father was killed, and whose mother was nearly

killed, in just such an incident--after the car had alreadybeen handed over. It is not at all implausible that Congress
should direct its attention to this particularly savage sort of
carjacking--where killing the driver is part of the intendedcrime.

Indeed, it seems to me much more implausible that Con-gress would have focused upon the ineffable "conditional intent" that the Court reads into the statute, sending courtsand juries off to wander through "would-a, could-a, should-a"
land. It is difficult enough to determine a defendant's actualintent; it is infinitely more difficult to determine what the
defendant planned to do upon the happening of an event thatthe defendant hoped would not happen, and that he himself
may not have come to focus upon. There will not often be
the accomplice's convenient confirmation of conditional intent that exists in the present case. Presumably it will be
up to each jury whether to take the carjacker ("Your car or

2 Note that I am discussing what was a plausible congressional purpose
in enacting this language--not what I necessarily think was the real one.
I search for a plausible purpose because a text without one may represent
a "scrivener's error" that we may properly correct. See Green v. Bock
Laundry Machine Co., 490 U. S. 504, 528-529 (1989) (Scalia, J., concurring
in judgment); see also United States v. X-Citement Video, Inc., 513 U. S.
64, 82 (1994) (Scalia, J., dissenting). There is no need for such correction
here; the text as it reads, unamended by a meaning of "intent" that contradicts normal usage, makes total sense. If I were to speculate as to the
real reason the "intent" requirement was added by those who drafted it,
I think I would select neither the Court's attribution of purpose nor the
one I have hypothesized. Like the District Court, see 921 F. Supp. 155,
158 (EDNY 1996), and the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, see
United States v. Anderson, 108 F. 3d 478, 482-483 (1997), I suspect the
"intent" requirement was inadvertently expanded beyond the new subsection 2119(3), which imposed the death penalty--where it was thought
necessary to ensure the constitutionality of that provision. Of course the
actual intent of the draftsmen is irrelevant; we are governed by what
Congress enacted.

your life") at his word. Such a system of justice seems tome so arbitrary that it is difficult to believe Congress intended it. Had Congress meant to cast its carjacking netso broadly, it could have achieved that result--and eliminated the arbitrariness--by defining the crime as "carjack-ing under threat of death or serious bodily injury." Given
the language here, I find it much more plausible that Con-gress meant to reach--as it said--the carjacker who intended to kill.In sum, I find the statute entirely unambiguous as to
whether the carjacker who hopes to obtain the car with-out inflicting harm is covered. Even if ambiguity existed,
however, the rule of lenity would require it to be resolvedin the defendant's favor. See generally United States v.
Wiltberger, 5 Wheat. 76, 95 (1820). The Government's state-ment that the rule of lenity "has its primary application in
cases in which there is some doubt whether the legislatureintended to criminalize conduct that might otherwise appear
to be innocent," Brief for United States 31 (emphasis added),is carefully crafted to conceal the fact that we have repeatedly applied the rule to situations just like this. For ex-ample, in

Ladner v. United States, 358 U. S. 169 (1958), thestatute at issue made it a crime to assault a federal officer

with a deadly weapon. The defendant, who fired one shot-gun blast that wounded two federal officers, contended that
under this statute he was guilty of only one, and not two,assaults. The Court said, in an opinion joined by all eight
Justices who reached the merits of the case:

"This policy of lenity means that the Court will not in-terpret a federal criminal statute so as to increase the

penalty that it places on an individual when such an in-terpretation can be based on no more than a guess as to
what Congress intended. If Congress desires to createmultiple offenses from a single act affecting more than
one federal officer, Congress can make that meaningclear. We thus hold that the single discharge of a shot526US1 Unit: $U26 [12-08-00 19:03:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Scalia, J., dissenting
gun alleged by the petitioner in this case would consti-tute only a single violation of $ 254." Id., at 178.

In Bell v. United States, 349 U. S. 81 (1955), the issue wassimilar: whether transporting two women, for the purpose
of prostitution, in the same vehicle and on the same trip,constituted one or two violations of the Mann Act. In an
opinion authored by Justice Frankfurter, the Court said:

"When Congress leaves to the Judiciary the task of im-puting to Congress an undeclared will, the ambiguity

should be resolved in favor of lenity. And this is notout of any sentimental consideration, or for want of
sympathy with the purpose of Congress in proscribingevil or antisocial conduct. It may fairly be said to be a
presupposition of our law to resolve doubts in the en-forcement of a penal code against the imposition of a
harsher punishment." Id., at 83.
If that is no longer the presupposition of our law, the Courtshould say so, and reduce the rule of lenity to a historical

curiosity. But if it remains the presupposition, the rule hasundeniable application in the present case. If the statute is
not, as I think, clear in the defendant's favor, it is at the veryleast ambiguous and the defendant must be given the benefit
of the doubt. * * *

This seems to me not a difficult case. The issue beforeus is not whether the "intent" element of some commonlaw crime developed by the courts themselves--or even the"intent" element of a statute that replicates the commonlaw definition--includes, or should include, conditional in-tent. Rather, it is whether the English term "intent" used
in a statute defining a brand new crime bears a meaning thatcontradicts normal usage. Since it is quite impossible to
say that longstanding, agreed-upon legal usage has con-verted this word into a term of art, the answer has to
be no. And it would be no even if the question were doubt526US1 Unit: $U26 [12-08-00 19:03:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ful. I think it particularly inadvisable to introduce the newpossibility of "conditional-intent" prosecutions into a modern federal criminal-law system characterized by plea bar-gaining, where they will predictably be used for in terrorem
effect. I respectfully dissent.

Justice Thomas, dissenting.
I cannot accept the majority's interpretation of the term"intent" in 18 U. S. C. $ 2119 (1994 ed. and Supp. III) to include the concept of conditional intent. The central diffi-culty in this case is that the text is silent as to the meaning
of "intent"--the carjacking statute does not define that word,and Title 18 of the United States Code, unlike some state
codes, lacks a general section defining intent to include condi-tional intent. See,

e. g., Del. Code Ann., Tit. 11, $ 254 (1995);Haw. Rev. Stat. $ 702-209 (1993); 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. $ 302(f )

(1998). As the majority notes, ante, at 9-11, there is someauthority to support its view that the specific intent to commit an act may be conditional. In my view, that authoritydoes not demonstrate that such a usage was part of a wellestablished historical tradition. Absent a more settled tra-dition, it cannot be presumed that Congress was familiar
with this usage when it enacted the statute. For these rea-sons, I agree with J

ustice Scalia the statute cannot beread to include the concept of conditional intent and, therefore, respectfully dissent.

23OCTOBER TERM, 1998
Syllabus

PEGUERO v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe third circuit

No. 97-9217. Argued January 11, 1999--Decided March 2, 1999
After petitioner pleaded guilty to federal drug charges, the District Court

sentenced him to prison, but failed to inform him at the sentencing hearing of his right to appeal the sentence. In a later motion for habeas
relief, petitioner alleged that that failure violated the express terms of
Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(a)(2). The District Court rejected petitioner's claim that any Rule 32 violation, without regard to
prejudice, is enough to vacate a sentence, and held that petitioner was
not entitled to relief because he actually knew of his right to appeal
when he was sentenced. The Third Circuit affirmed, holding that the
Rule 32(a)(2) violation was subject to harmless-error review and that,
because petitioner was aware of his right to appeal, the Rule's purpose
had been served.

Held: A district court's failure to advise a defendant of his right to appeal

does not entitle him to habeas relief if he knew of his right and hence
suffered no prejudice from the omission. Because Rule 32(a)(2) requires a district court to advise a defendant of any right to appeal his
sentence, it is undisputed that the court's failure to give the required
advice was error in this case. However, as a general rule, a court's
failure to give a defendant advice required by the Federal Rules is a
sufficient basis for collateral relief only when the defendant is prejudiced by the error. See, e. g., United States v. Timmreck, 441 U. S. 780.
Because petitioner had full knowledge of his right to appeal, the fact
that the court violated the Rule, standing alone, does not entitle him
to collateral relief. The narrow holding in Rodriquez v. United States,
395 U. S. 327--that when counsel fails to file a requested appeal, a defendant is entitled to resentencing and an appeal without showing
that his appeal would likely have merit--is not implicated here because
the District Court found that petitioner did not request an appeal.

Roy W. McLeese III argued the cause for the UnitedStates. With him on the brief were Solicitor General Waxman, Assistant Attorney General Robinson, Deputy Solicitor General Dreeben, and Louis M. Fischer.*

Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.
We granted certiorari to resolve a Circuit conflict overwhether a district court's failure to advise a defendant of his

right to appeal as required by the Federal Rules of CriminalProcedure provides a basis for collateral relief even when
the defendant was aware of his right to appeal when the trialcourt omitted to give the advice. Compare, e. g., Thompson
v. United States, 111 F. 3d 109 (CA11 1997) (defendant enti-tled to relief even if he knew of his right to appeal through
other sources); United States v. Sanchez, 88 F. 3d 1243(CADC 1996) (same); Reid v. United States, 69 F. 3d 688
(CA2 1995) (per curiam) (same), with Tress v. United States,87 F. 3d 188 (CA7 1996) (defendant not entitled to relief if he
knew of his right to appeal); United States v. Drummond,903 F. 2d 1171 (CA8 1990) (same). We hold that a district
court's failure to advise the defendant of his right to appealdoes not entitle him to habeas relief if he knew of his right
and hence suffered no prejudice from the omission.Petitioner Manuel Peguero pleaded guilty to conspiracy
to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U. S. C. $ 846. Ata sentencing hearing held on April 22, 1992, the District

Court appointed new counsel, who filed an amended motion
adding a claim that at the sentencing proceeding the trialcourt violated Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(a)(2)

by failing to advise petitioner of his right to appeal his sen-tence. This last claim gives rise to the question before us.

The District Court held an evidentiary hearing. Peti-tioner testified that, upon being sentenced, he at once asked
his lawyer to file an appeal. App. 139. Consistent with
petitioner's testimony, the District Court found that, although the sentencing court had failed to advise petitioner
of his right to appeal the sentence, petitioner knew of his
right to appeal when the sentencing hearing occurred.
No. 1:CR-90-97-01 (MD Pa., July 1, 1997), App. 168, 184.
The court also credited the testimony of petitioner's trial
counsel that petitioner told counsel he did not want to take
an appeal because he hoped to cooperate with the Government and earn a sentence reduction. Id., at 180-181; cf. Fed.
Rule Crim. Proc. 35(b) ("The court, on motion of the Government made within one year after the imposition of the
sentence, may reduce a sentence to reflect a defendant's subsequent, substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense").

Relying on our holding in United States v. Timmreck,
441 U. S. 780 (1979), the District Court rejected petitioner's
claim that any violation of Rule 32, without regard to prejudice, is enough to vacate a sentence under $ 2255. The court
held that petitioner was not entitled to relief because he
was actually aware of his right to appeal at the time of
sentencing. No. 1:CR-90-97-01, App. 184. The court also
rejected petitioner's ineffective assistance of counsel claim
based on its finding that petitioner did not request an appeal.

Opinion of the Court
The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed theruling. It held that the Rule 32(a)(2) violation was subject

to harmless-error review and that, because petitioner wasaware of his right to appeal, the purpose of the Rule had
been served and petitioner was not entitled to relief. Judgt.

In 1992, when petitioner was sentenced, Federal Rule ofCriminal Procedure 32(a)(2) provided:

"Notification of Right To Appeal.--After imposing sentence in a case which has gone to trial on a plea of not
guilty, the court shall advise the defendant of the de-fendant's right to appeal, including any right to appeal

the sentence, and of the right of a person who is unableto pay the cost of an appeal to apply for leave to appeal
in forma pauperis. There shall be no duty on the courtto advise the defendant of any right of appeal after sentence is imposed following a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, except that the court shall advise the defendantof any right to appeal the sentence. If the defendant so

requests, the clerk of the court shall prepare and fileforthwith a notice of appeal on behalf of the defendant."

Current Rule 32(c)(5) likewise imposes on the district court
the duty to advise the defendant at sentencing of any right
to appeal.The requirement that the district court inform a defendant

of his right to appeal serves important functions. It willoften be the case that, as soon as sentence is imposed, the
defendant will be taken into custody and transported elsewhere, making it difficult for the defendant to maintain
contact with his attorney. The relationship between the
defendant and the attorney may also be strained after
sentencing, in any event, because of the defendant's disappointment over the outcome of the case or the terms of
the sentence. The attorney, moreover, concentrating on

Opinion of the Court
other matters, may fail to tell the defendant of the rightto appeal, though months later the attorney may think that

he in fact gave the advice because it was standard practiceto do so. In addition, if the defendant is advised of the
right by the judge who imposes sentence, the defendant will
realize that the appeal may be taken as of right and withoutaffront to the trial judge, who may later rule upon a motion

to modify or reduce the sentence. See Fed. Rule Crim.Proc. 35. Advising the defendant of his right at sentencing
also gives him a clear opportunity to announce his intentionto appeal and request the court clerk to file the notice of
appeal, well before the 10-day filing period runs. See Rule
32(c)(5) ("If the defendant so requests, the clerk of the court
must immediately prepare and file a notice of appeal on behalf of the defendant"); Fed. Rule App. Proc. 4(b) (establishing 10-day period for filing appeal, which may be extended
for 30 days by district court for "excusable neglect").

These considerations underscore the importance of the
advice which comes from the court itself. Trial judges must
be meticulous and precise in following each of the requirements of Rule 32 in every case. It is undisputed, then, that
the court's failure to give the required advice was error.

A violation of Rule 32(a)(2), however, does not entitle a
defendant to collateral relief in all circumstances. Our precedents establish, as a general rule, that a court's failure to
give a defendant advice required by the Federal Rules is a
sufficient basis for collateral relief only when the defendant
is prejudiced by the court's error. In Hill v. United States,
368 U. S. 424 (1962), for example, the District Court violated
the then-applicable version of Rule 32(a) by failing to make
explicit that the defendant had an opportunity to speak in
his own behalf. The defendant did not allege that he had
been "affirmatively denied an opportunity to speak," that the
District Judge had been deprived of any relevant information, or that the defendant "would have had anything at all
to say if he had been formally invited to speak." Id., at 429.

526US1 Unit: $U27 [10-02-99 17:33:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN
28 PEGUERO v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
The defendant established only "a failure to comply with the
formal requirements of the Rule," ibid., and alleged no prejudice; on these premises, the Court held the defendant was
not entitled to collateral relief, id., at 428-429.

So, also, in United States v. Timmreck, collateral relief was
unavailable to a defendant who alleged only that the District
Court " `fail[ed] to comply with the formal requirements' "
of Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure by
not advising him of a mandatory special parole term to
which he was subject. 441 U. S., at 785. The defendant
did not argue "that he was actually unaware of the special
parole term or that, if he had been properly advised by the
trial judge, he would not have pleaded guilty." Id., at 784.
Having alleged no prejudice, defendant's "only claim [was]
of a technical violation of the Rule" insufficient to justify
habeas relief. Ibid.

In this case, petitioner had full knowledge of his right to
appeal, hence the District Court's violation of Rule 32(a)(2)
by failing to inform him of that right did not prejudice him.
The fact of the violation, standing alone, Hill and Timmreck
instruct, does not entitle petitioner to collateral relief.

Our decision in Rodriquez v. United States, 395 U. S. 327
(1969), does not hold otherwise. In Rodriquez, the Court
held that when counsel fails to file a requested appeal, a
defendant is entitled to resentencing and to an appeal without showing that his appeal would likely have had merit.
Id., at 329-330. Without questioning the rule in Rodriquez,
we conclude its holding is not implicated here because of the
District Court's factual finding that petitioner did not request an appeal. While Rodriquez did note the sentencing
court's failure to advise the defendant of his right to appeal,
it did so only in the course of rejecting the Government's
belated argument that the case should be remanded for factfinding to determine the reason counsel had not filed the appeal. The court's failure to advise the defendant of his right

29Cite as: 526 U. S. 23 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
was simply one factor--in combination with the untimeliness
of the Government's request and the lengthy proceedings
and delay the defendant had already endured--that led the
Court to conclude that it was "just under the circumstances"
to accord the petitioner final relief at that time without further proceedings. Id., at 331-332. This limited and factspecific conclusion does not support a general rule that a
court's failure to advise a defendant of the right to appeal
automatically requires resentencing to allow an appeal.

Petitioner and his amicus would distinguish Timmreck
(and, presumably, Hill) on the ground that the defendant in
Timmreck had the opportunity to raise his claim on direct
appeal but failed to do so, whereas the absence of the "judicial warning [required by Rule 32(a)(2)] may effectively
undermine the defendant's ability to take a direct appeal."
Brief for Petitioner 20. This argument, however, provides
no basis for holding that a Rule 32(a)(2) oversight, though
nonprejudicial, automatically entitles the defendant to habeas relief. Even errors raised on direct appeal are subject
to harmless-error review. Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules
of Criminal Procedure prohibits federal courts from granting
relief based on errors that "d[o] not affect substantial rights."
See Rule 52(a) ("Any error, defect, irregularity or variance
which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded"); see also Bank of Nova Scotia v. United States, 487
U. S. 250, 254-255 (1988) ("[A] federal court may not invoke
supervisory power to circumvent the harmless-error inquiry
prescribed by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(a). . . .
Rule 52 is, in every pertinent respect, as binding as any statute duly enacted by Congress, and federal courts have no
more discretion to disregard the Rule's mandate than they
do to disregard constitutional or statutory provisions").

Accordingly, we hold that petitioner is not entitled to
habeas relief based on a Rule 32(a)(2) violation when he
had independent knowledge of the right to appeal and so

was not prejudiced by the trial court's omission. The judg-ment of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit is

Affirmed.
Justice O'Connor, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer join, concurring.

I join the opinion of the Court, and I write separately toexpress my views about the meaning of prejudice in this

context. When, as here, a district court fails to advise adefendant of his right to appeal, there are two ways in which
this error could be said not to have prejudiced the defendant.First, a defendant might not be prejudiced by the error because he already knew about his right to appeal. That isthe case here, and the Court properly concludes that under
these circumstances, the defendant has not shown that he isentitled to collateral relief.

Second, a defendant might not be prejudiced by the dis-trict court's failure to advise him of his right to appeal because he had no meritorious grounds for appeal in any event.In my opinion, there is no reason why a defendant should
have to demonstrate that he had meritorious grounds for anappeal when he is attempting to show that he was harmed
by the district court's error. To require defendants to spec-ify the grounds for their appeal and show that they have
some merit would impose a heavy burden on defendants whoare often proceeding

pro se in an initial 28 U. S. C. $ 2255motion. If the district judge had fulfilled his obligation to

advise the defendant of his right to appeal, and the defendanthad wanted to appeal, he would have had a lawyer to identify
and develop his arguments on appeal. The defendant shouldnot be penalized for failing to appeal in the first instance
when his failure to appeal is attributable to the errors of adistrict court judge. This result is consistent with our resolution of Rodriquez v. United States, 395 U. S. 327 (1969).In

Rodriquez, we held that when a defendant's failure to

appeal a conviction is attributable to an error by his lawyer,the defendant is entitled to collateral relief without requiring

him to show that his appeal would have had merit. In myview, there is no reason to adopt a different rule when the
failure to appeal results from a district judge's error.

ARIZONA DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE v. BLAZECONSTRUCTION CO., INC.

certiorari to the court of appeals of arizona
No. 97-1536. Argued December 8, 1998--Decided March 2, 1999
Over several years, the Bureau of Indian Affairs contracted with respondent Blaze Construction Company to build, repair, and improve roads
on several Indian reservations located in Arizona. At the end of the
contracting period, petitioner Arizona Department of Revenue (Department) issued a tax deficiency assessment against Blaze for its failure to
pay Arizona's transaction privilege tax on the proceeds from its contracts with the Bureau; that tax is levied on the gross receipts of companies doing business in the State. Blaze protested the assessment and
prevailed in administrative proceedings, but the Arizona Tax Court
granted the Department summary judgment. The Arizona Court of
Appeals reversed, rejecting the Department's argument that United
States v. New Mexico, 455 U. S. 720, controlled, and holding that federal
law pre-empted the tax's application to Blaze.

Held: A State generally may impose a nondiscriminatory tax upon a private company's proceeds from contracts with the Federal Government,
regardless of whether the federal contractor renders its services on an
Indian reservation. In New Mexico, supra, the Court announced a
clear rule that tax immunity is appropriate only when the levy falls on
the United States itself, or on its agency or closely connected instrumentality. Id., at 733. To expand that immunity beyond these narrow constitutional limits, Congress must expressly so provide. Id., at 737.
Thus, absent a constitutional immunity or congressional exemption, federal law does not shield Blaze from Arizona's transaction privilege tax.
The incidence of the tax falls on Blaze, not the Government; nor has
Congress exempted these contracts from taxation. Nevertheless, the
Arizona Court of Appeals employed a balancing test weighing state,
federal, and tribal interests, and held that a congressional intent to preempt the tax could be inferred from federal laws regulating Indian welfare. In cases involving taxation of on-reservation activity, this Court
has undertaken such a particularized examination where the tax's legal
incidence fell on a nontribal entity engaged in a transaction with tribes
or tribal members. See, e. g., Cotton Petroleum Corp. v. New Mexico,
490 U. S. 163. But the Court has never employed this balancing test
where a State seeks to tax a transaction between the Government and
a non-Indian private contractor, and declines to do so now. The need

to avoid litigation and to ensure efficient tax administration counsels in
favor of a bright-line standard for taxing federal contracts, regardless of
whether the contracted-for activity takes place on Indian reservations.
Moreover, the political process is uniquely adapted to accommodating
the interests implicated by state taxation of federal contractors. New

tax rests with Arizona and Congress, not this Court. Pp. 35-39.

34 ARIZONA DEPT. OF REVENUE v. BLAZE CONSTR. CO.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.
In United States v. New Mexico, 455 U. S. 720 (1982), we
held that a State generally may impose a nondiscriminatory
tax upon a private company's proceeds from contracts with
the Federal Government. This case asks us to determine
whether that same rule applies when the federal contractor
renders its services on an Indian reservation. We hold that
it does.

I

Under the Federal Lands Highways Program, 23 U. S. C.

$ 204, the Federal Government finances road construction
and improvement projects on federal public roads, including
Indian reservation roads. Various federal agencies oversee
the planning of particular projects and the allocation of funding to them. $$ 202(d), 204. The Commissioner of Indian
Affairs has the responsibility to "plan, survey, design and
construct" Indian reservation roads. 25 CFR $ 170.3 (1998).

Over a several-year period, the Bureau of Indian Affairs
contracted with Blaze Construction Company to build, repair, and improve roads on the Navajo, Hopi, Fort Apache,
Colorado River, Tohono O'Odham, and San Carlos Apache
Indian Reservations in Arizona. Blaze is incorporated
under the laws of the Blackfeet Tribe of Montana and is
owned by a member of that Tribe. But, as the company
concedes, Blaze is the equivalent of a non-Indian for purposes
of this case because none of its work occurred on the Blackfeet Reservation. Brief in Opposition 2, n. 1; see Washington v. Confederated Tribes of Colville Reservation, 447 U. S.
134, 160-161 (1980).

At the end of the contracting period, the Arizona Department of Revenue (Department) issued a tax deficiency assessment against Blaze for its failure to pay Arizona's transaction privilege tax on the proceeds from its contracts with
the Bureau; that tax is levied on the gross receipts of compa526US1 Unit: $U28 [09-18-99 19:56:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN

nies doing business in the State.1 See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann.$$ 42-1306, 42-1310.16 (1991). Blaze protested the assessment and prevailed at the end of administrative proceedings,but, on review, the Arizona Tax Court granted summary
judgment in the Department's favor. The Arizona Court ofAppeals reversed. 190 Ariz. 262, 947 P. 2d 836 (1997). It
rejected the Department's argument that our decision in
New Mexico, supra, controlled the case and held that federallaw pre-empted the application of Arizona's transaction privilege tax to Blaze. The Arizona Supreme Court denied theDepartment's petition for review, with one justice voting to
grant the petition. We granted certiorari, 523 U. S. 1117(1998), and now reverse.

II
In New Mexico, we considered whether a State could im-pose gross receipts and use taxes on the property, income,

and purchases of private federal contractors. To remedy"the confusing nature of our precedents" in this area, 455
U. S., at 733, we announced a clear rule:

"[T]ax immunity is appropriate in only one circum-stance: when the levy falls on the United States itself,

or on an agency or instrumentality so closely connectedto the Government that the two cannot realistically be
viewed as separate entities, at least insofar as the activ-ity being taxed is concerned."

Id., at 735.

We reasoned that this "narrow approach" to the scope of gov-ernmental tax immunity "accord[ed] with competing constitutional imperatives, by giving full range to each sovereign'staxing authority."

Id., at 735-736 (citing Graves v. New
York ex rel. O'Keefe, 306 U. S. 466, 483 (1939)). For thatimmunity to be expanded beyond these "narrow constitu1 The Department initially also sought to tax Blaze's proceeds from contracts with tribal housing authorities but eventually dropped its claim.
We therefore have no occasion to consider Blaze's tax liability with respect
to those contracts.

Opinion of the Court
tional limits," we explained that Congress must "take responsibility for the decision, by so expressly providing as
respects contracts in a particular form, or contracts under
particular programs." 455 U. S., at 737 (emphasis added);
see also Carson v. Roane-Anderson Co., 342 U. S. 232, 234
(1952). Applying those principles, we upheld each of the
taxes at issue in that case because the legal incidence of the
taxes fell on the contractors, not the Federal Government;
the contractors could not be considered agencies or instrumentalities of the Federal Government; and Congress had
not expressly exempted the contractors' activities from taxation but, rather, had expressly repealed a pre-existing statutory exemption. See New Mexico, 455 U. S., at 743-744.

These principles control the resolution of this case. Absent a constitutional immunity or congressional exemption,
federal law does not shield Blaze from Arizona's transaction
privilege tax. See id., at 737; James v. Dravo Contracting
Co., 302 U. S. 134, 161 (1937). The incidence of Arizona's
transaction privilege tax falls on Blaze, not the Federal Government. Blaze does not argue that it is an agency or instrumentality of the Federal Government, and New Mexico's
clear rule would have foreclosed any such argument under
these circumstances. Nor has Congress exempted these
contracts from taxation. Cf. Carson, supra, at 234.

Nevertheless, the Arizona Court of Appeals held (and
Blaze urges here) that the tax cannot be applied to activities
taking place on Indian reservations.2 After it employed a

2 Blaze also appears to argue that Arizona's tax infringes on the Tribes'
right to make their own decisions and be governed by them and that this
is sufficient, by itself, to preclude application of Arizona's tax. See Williams v. Lee, 358 U. S. 217, 220 (1959). Our decisions upholding state
taxes in a variety of on-reservation settings squarely foreclose that argument. See, e. g., Washington v. Confederated Tribes of Colville Reservation, 447 U. S. 134, 156 (1980); Moe v. Confederated Salish and Kootenai
Tribes of Flathead Reservation, 425 U. S. 463, 483 (1976).

balancing test "weighing the respective state, federal, and
tribal interests," Cotton Petroleum Corp. v. New Mexico, 490
U. S. 163, 177 (1989), the court below held that a congressional intent to pre-empt Arizona's tax could be inferred
from federal laws regulating the welfare of Indians. In
cases involving taxation of on-reservation activity, we have
undertaken this "particularized examination," Ramah Navajo School Bd., Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue of N. M., 458 U. S.
832, 838 (1982), where the legal incidence of the tax fell on a
nontribal entity engaged in a transaction with tribes or
tribal members. See, e. g., Cotton Petroleum Corp., supra,
at 176-187 (state severance tax imposed on non-Indian lessee's production of oil and gas); Ramah, supra, at 836-846
(state gross receipts tax imposed on private contractor's proceeds from contract with tribe for school construction); Central Machinery Co. v. Arizona Tax Comm'n, 448 U. S. 160,
165-166 (1980) (tax imposed on sale of farm machinery to
tribe); White Mountain Apache Tribe v. Bracker, 448 U. S.
136, 144-153 (1980) (motor carrier license and use fuel taxes
imposed on logging and hauling operations pursuant to contract with tribal enterprise). But we have never employed
this balancing test in a case such as this one where a State
seeks to tax a transaction between the Federal Government
and its non-Indian private contractor.

We decline to do so now. Interest balancing in this
setting would only cloud the clear rule established by our
decision in New Mexico. The need to avoid litigation and
to ensure efficient tax administration counsels in favor of a
bright-line standard for taxation of federal contracts, regardless of whether the contracted-for activity takes place on Indian reservations. Cf. Oklahoma Tax Comm'n v. Chickasaw Nation, 515 U. S. 450, 458-459 (1995); County of Yakima

Washington v. United States, 460 U. S.536, 546 (1983). Whether to exempt Blaze from Arizona's

transaction privilege tax is not our decision to make; thatdecision rests, instead, with the State of Arizona and with
Congress.Our conclusion in no way limits the Tribes' ample opportunity to advance their interests when they choose to do so.Under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, 88 Stat. 2203, 25 U. S. C. $ 450 et seq. (1994 ed. andSupp. III), a tribe may request the Secretary of Interior to
enter into a self-determination contract "to plan, conduct,and administer programs or portions thereof, including construction programs." $ 450f(a)(1). Where a tribe entersinto such a contract, it assumes greater responsibility over
the management of the federal funds and the operation ofcertain federal programs. See, e. g., 25 CFR $ 900.3(b)(4)
(1998). Here, the Tribes on whose reservations Blaze's workwas performed have not exercised this option, and the Federal Government has retained contracting responsibility.Because the Tribes in this case have not assumed this responsibility, we have no occasion to consider whether the In-dian pre-emption doctrine would apply when Tribes choose
to take a more direct and active role in administering the

imposition of a tax on the gross receipts of Blaze's federal contracts, the

AMERICAN MANUFACTURERS MUTUAL INSURANCE CO. et al. v. SULLIVAN et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe third circuit

No. 97-2000. Argued January 19, 1999--Decided March 3, 1999
Under Pennsylvania's Workers' Compensation Act, once an employer becomes liable for an employee's work-related injury--because liability
either is not contested or is no longer at issue--the employer or its
insurer must pay for all "reasonable" and "necessary" medical treatment. To assure that only medical expenses meeting these criteria are
paid, and in an attempt to control costs, Pennsylvania has amended its
workers' compensation system to provide that a self-insured employer
or private insurer (collectively insurer) may withhold payment for disputed treatment pending an independent "utilization review," as to
which, among other things, the insurer files a one-page request for review with the State Workers' Compensation Bureau (Bureau), the Bureau forwards the request to a "utilization review organization" (URO)
of private health care providers, and the URO determines whether the
treatment is reasonable or necessary. Respondents, employees and employee representatives, filed this suit under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 against
various Pennsylvania officials, a self-insured public school district, and
a number of private workers' compensation insurers, alleging, inter
alia, that in withholding benefits without predeprivation notice and an
opportunity to be heard, the state and private defendants, acting "under
color of state law," deprived respondents of property in violation of due
process. The District Court dismissed the private insurers from the
suit on the ground that they are not "state actors," and later dismissed
the state officials and school district on the ground that the Act does
not violate due process. The Third Circuit disagreed on both issues,
holding, among other rulings, that a private insurer's decision to suspend payment under the Act constitutes state action. The court also
noted the parties' assumption that employees have a protected property
interest in workers' compensation medical benefits, and held that due
process requires that payment of medical bills not be withheld until
employees have had an opportunity to submit their view in writing

to the URO as to the reasonableness and necessity of the disputed
treatment.

Held:

1. A private insurer's decision to withhold payment and seek utilization review of the reasonableness and necessity of particular medical
treatments is not fairly attributable to the State so as to subject the
insurer to the Fourteenth Amendment's constraints. State action requires both an alleged constitutional deprivation caused by acts taken
pursuant to state law and that the allegedly unconstitutional conduct
be fairly attributable to the State. E. g., Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co.,
457 U. S. 922, 937. Here, while it may fairly be said that the first requirement is satisfied, respondents have failed to satisfy the second.
The mere fact that a private business is subject to extensive state regulation does not by itself convert its action into that of the State. See,
e. g., Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U. S. 991, 1004. The private insurers cannot
be held to constitutional standards unless there is a sufficiently close
nexus between the State and the challenged action so that the latter
may be fairly treated as that of the State itself. Ibid. Whether such
a nexus exists depends on, among other things, whether the State has
provided such significant encouragement, either overt or covert, that
the choice must in law be deemed to be that of the State. E. g., ibid.
That the statutory scheme previously prohibited insurers from withholding payment for disputed medical services and no longer does so
merely shows that the State, in administering a many-faceted remedial
system, has shifted one facet from favoring the employees to favoring
the employer. This sort of decision occurs regularly in the legislative
process and cannot be said to "encourage" or "authorize" the insurer's
actions. Also rejected is respondents' assertion that the challenged
decisions are state action because insurers must obtain "authorization"
or "permission" from the Bureau before withholding payment. The
Bureau's participation is limited to requiring submission of a form and
related functions, which cannot render it responsible for the insurers'
actions. See id., at 1007. Respondents' twofold argument that state
action is present because the State has delegated to insurers powers
traditionally reserved to itself also lacks merit. First, the contention
as to delegation of the provision of state-mandated "public benefits" fails
because nothing in Pennsylvania's Constitution or statutory scheme obligates the State to provide either medical treatment or workers' compensation benefits to injured workers. See, e. g., Jackson v. Metropolitan
Edison Co., 419 U. S. 345, 352; West v. Atkins, 487 U. S. 42, 54-56, distinguished. Second, their argument as to delegation of the governmental
decision to suspend payment for disputed medical treatment is supported by neither historical practice nor the state statutory scheme.
That Pennsylvania originally recognized an insurer's traditionally pri526US1 Unit: $U29 [01-03-01 13:04:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN
42 AMERICAN MFRS. MUT. INS. CO. v. SULLIVAN

Syllabus
vate prerogative to withhold payment, then restricted it, and now
(in one limited respect) has restored it, cannot constitute the delegation
of an exclusive public function. See Flagg Bros., Inc. v. Brooks, 436
U. S. 149, 162, n. 12. Finally, respondents misplace their reliance on a
"joint participation" theory of state action. Privately owned enterprises providing services that the State would not necessarily provide, even though they are extensively regulated, do not fall within the
ambit of that theory. E. g., Blum, supra, at 1011; Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority, 365 U. S. 715, and Lugar, supra, distinguished.
Pp. 49-58.

2. The Pennsylvania regime does not deprive disabled employees of
"property" within the meaning of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Only after finding deprivation of a protected property interest does this Court look to see if the State's procedures comport with due process. Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319, 332. Here,
respondents contend that state law confers upon them such a protected
interest in workers' compensation medical benefits. However, under
Pennsylvania law, an employee is not entitled to payment for all medical
treatment once the employer's initial liability is established, as respondents' argument assumes. Instead, the law expressly limits an employee's entitlement to "reasonable" and "necessary" medical treatment, and
requires that disputes over the reasonableness and necessity of particular treatment be resolved before an employer's obligation to pay--and
an employee's entitlement to benefits--arise. Thus, for an employee's
property interest in the payment of medical benefits to attach under
state law, the employee must clear two hurdles: He must prove (1) that
an employer is liable for a work-related injury, and (2) that the particular medical treatment at issue is reasonable and necessary. While respondents have cleared the first hurdle, they have yet to satisfy the
second. Consequently, they do not have the property interest they
claim. Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U. S. 254, 261-263, and Mathews, supra,

Opinion of the Court
gime does not deprive disabled employees of property withinthe meaning of that Amendment.

I
Before the enactment of workers' compensation laws, em-ployees who suffered a work-related injury or occupational

disease could recover compensation from their employersonly by resort to traditional tort remedies available at common law. In the early 20th century, States began to replace
the common-law system, which often saddled employees withthe difficulty and expense of establishing negligence or proving damages, with a compulsory insurance system requiringemployers to compensate employees for work-related injuries without regard to fault. See generally 1 A. Larson & L.Larson, Larson's Workers' Compensation Law $$ 5.20-5.30,
pp. 2-15 to 2-25 (1996).Following this model, Pennsylvania's Workers' Compensation Act, Pa. Stat. Ann., Tit. 77, $ 1 et seq. (Purdon 1992
and Supp. 1998) (Act or 77 Pa. Stat. Ann.), first enacted in1915, creates a system of no-fault liability for work-related

injuries and makes employers' liability under this system"exclusive . . . of any and all other liability." $ 481(a). All
employers subject to the Act must (1) obtain workers' com-pensation insurance from a private insurer, (2) obtain such
insurance through the State Workmen's Insurance Fund(SWIF), or (3) seek permission from the State to self-insure.

$ 501(a). Once an employer becomes liable for an employee's
work-related injury--because liability either is not contestedor is no longer at issue--the employer or its insurer

1 must

pay for all "reasonable" and "necessary" medical treatment,
and must do so within 30 days of receiving a bill.$$ 531(1)(i), (5).

1 Self-insured employers and private insurers face identical obligations
under Pennsylvania's workers' compensation system, and we therefore
refer to them collectively as "insurers" or "private insurers."

Opinion of the Court
To assure that insurers pay only for medical care thatmeets these criteria, and in an attempt to control costs,

Pennsylvania amended its workers' compensation system in1993. 1993 Pa. Laws, No. 44, p. 190. Most important for
our purposes, the 1993 amendments created a "utilization
review" procedure under which the reasonableness and ne-cessity of an employee's past, ongoing, or prospective medical treatment could be reviewed before a medical bill mustbe paid. 77 Pa. Stat. Ann. $ 531(6) (Purdon Supp. 1998).

2

Under this system, if an insurer "disputes the reasonablenessor necessity of the treatment provided," $ 531(5), it may request utilization review (within the same 30-day period) byfiling a one-page form with the Workers' Compensation Bureau of the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry(Bureau). $ 531(6)(i); 34 Pa. Code $$ 127.404(b), 127.452(a)
(1998). The form identifies (among other things) the employee, the medical provider, the date of the employee's injury, and the medical treatment to be reviewed. Ibid.; App.
5. The Bureau makes no attempt, as the Court of Appeals
stated, to "address the legitimacy or lack thereof of the request," but merely determines whether the form is "properly
completed--i.e., that all information required by the form is
provided." Sullivan v. Barnett, 139 F. 3d 158, 163 (CA3
1998); see 34 Pa. Code $ 127.452(a). Upon the proper filing

2 Before Pennsylvania enacted the "utilization review" procedure, an insurer had no effective means of recouping payments for medical treatment
that was later determined to be unreasonable or unnecessary. State law
bars insurers from seeking reimbursement of excessive payments from
health care providers, see Moats v. Workmen's Compensation Appeal Bd.
(Emerald Mines Corp.), 588 A. 2d 116, 118 (Pa. Commw. 1991), and, although insurers are entitled to reimbursement from the Workmen's Compensation Supersedeas Fund for treatment later deemed to be unreasonable or unnecessary, 34 Pa. Code $ 127.208(g) (1998), the fund is financed
entirely from assessments levied on insurers and self-insured employers
themselves. 77 Pa. Stat. Ann. $ 999(b) (Purdon 1992). See generally
D. Ballantyne, Workers Compensation Research Institute, Revisiting
Workers' Compensation in Pennsylvania 36-37 (1997).

providers for the particular services being challenged. 77
Pa. Stat. Ann. $ 531(5) (Purdon Supp. 1998); 34 Pa. Code

$ 208(f).

The Bureau then notifies the parties that utilization review
has been requested and forwards the request to a randomly
selected "utilization review organization" (URO). $ 127.453.
URO's are private organizations consisting of health care
providers who are "licensed in the same profession and
hav[e] the same or similar specialty as that of the provider
of the treatment under review," 77 Pa. Stat. Ann. $ 531(6)(i)
(Purdon Supp. 1998); 34 Pa. Code $ 127.466. The purpose of
utilization review, and the sole authority conferred upon a
URO, is to determine "whether the treatment under review
is reasonable or necessary for the medical condition of the
employee" in light of "generally accepted treatment protocols." $$ 127.470(a), 127.467. Reviewers must examine the
treating provider's medical records, $$ 127.459, 127.460, and
must give the provider an opportunity to discuss the treatment under review, $ 127.469.3 Any doubt as to the reasonableness and necessity of a given procedure must be resolved
in favor of the employee. $ 127.471(b).

3 Although URO's may not request, and the parties may not submit,
any "reports of independent medical examinations," 34 Pa. Code $ 127.461,
employees are allowed to submit a "written personal statement" to the
URO regarding their view of the "reasonableness and/or necessity" of the
disputed treatment, App. 50. This latter aspect of the process differs
from the system in place at the time of the Court of Appeals' decision.
Under the law at that time, employees received notice that utilization review had been requested, but were not informed that their medical benefits could be suspended and were not permitted to submit materials to the
URO. The Bureau modified its procedures in response to the Court of
Appeals' decision, and now provides for more extensive notice and an
opportunity for employees to provide at least some input into the URO's
decision. Petitioners have not challenged the Court of Appeals' holding
with respect to these additional procedures.

phia (which self-insures), and a number of private insurancecompanies who provide workers' compensation coverage in

Pennsylvania. Respondents alleged that in withholdingworkers' compensation benefits without predeprivation notice and an opportunity to be heard, the state and privatedefendants, acting "under color of state law," deprived them
of property in violation of due process. Amended Com-plaint |||| 265-271, App. 43-44. They sought declaratory and
injunctive relief, as well as damages.The District Court dismissed the private insurers from the
lawsuit on the ground that they are not "state actors," Sullivan v. Barnett, 913 F. Supp. 895, 905 (ED Pa. 1996), and laterdismissed the state officials who remained as defendants, as

well as the school district, on the ground that the Act doesnot violate due process, App. to Pet. for Cert. 71a.

The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit disagreed onboth issues. 139 F. 3d 158 (1998). It held that a private
insurer's decision to suspend payment under the Act--whatthe court called a "supersedeas"--constitutes state action.
The court reasoned:

"In creating and executing this system of entitle-ments, the [State] has enacted a complex and interwoven regulatory web enlisting the Bureau, the em-ployers, and the insurance companies. The [State]
extensively regulates and controls the Workers' Com-pensation system. Although the insurance companies
are private entities, when they act under the constructof the Workers' Compensation system, they are providing public benefits which honor [s]tate entitlements.In effect, they become an arm of the State, fulfilling
a uniquely governmental obligation under an entirelystate-created, self-contained public benefit system. . . .

"The right to invoke the supersedeas, or to stop pay-ments, is a power that traditionally was held in the
hands of the State. When insurance companies invokethe supersedeas (i. e., suspension) of an employee's medi526US1 Unit: $U29 [01-03-01 13:04:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
cal benefits, they compromise an employee's [s]tate-created entitlements. The insurers have no power to

deprive or terminate such benefits without the permis-sion and participation of the [State]. More importantly,
however, the [State] is intimately involved in any deci-sion by an insurer to terminate an employee's constitutionally protected benefits because an insurer cannotsuspend medical payments without first obtaining authorization from the Bureau. However this authoriza-tion may be characterized, any deprivation that occurs
is predicated upon the State's involvement." Id., at 168.
On the due process issue, the Court of Appeals did notaddress whether respondents have a protected property interest in workers' compensation medical benefits, statingthat "[n]either party disputes" this point.

Id., at 171, n. 23.Thus focusing on what process is "due," the court held that

payment of bills may not be withheld until employees havehad an opportunity to submit their view in writing as to the
reasonableness and necessity of the disputed treatment tothe URO. The court then determined that the relevant
statutory language permitting the suspension of paymentduring utilization review was severable and struck it from
the statute. Id., at 173-174.We granted certiorari, 524 U. S. 981 (1998), to resolve a
conflict on the status of private insurers providing workers'compensation coverage under state laws,

7 and to review the

Court of Appeals' holding that due process prohibits insurersfrom withholding payment for disputed medical treatment

pending review. II

To state a claim for relief in an action brought under$ 1983, respondents must establish that they were deprived
of a right secured by the Constitution or laws of the UnitedStates, and that the alleged deprivation was committed

under color of state law. Like the state-action requirementof the Fourteenth Amendment, the under-color-of-state-law

element of $ 1983 excludes from its reach " `merely privateconduct, no matter how discriminatory or wrongful,' " Blum
v. Yaretsky, 457 U. S. 991, 1002 (1982) (quoting Shelley v.
Kraemer, 334 U. S. 1, 13 (1948)).8Perhaps hoping to avoid the traditional application of our

state-action cases, respondents attempt to characterize theirclaim as a "facial" or "direct" challenge to the utilization review procedures contained in the Act, in which case, the ar-gument goes, we need not concern ourselves with the "identity of the defendant" or the "act or decision by a privateactor or entity who is relying on the challenged law." Brief
for Respondents 16. This argument, however, ignores ourrepeated insistence that state action requires

both an allegedconstitutional deprivation "caused by the exercise of some

right or privilege created by the State or by a rule of conductimposed by the State or by a person for whom the State is
responsible," and that "the party charged with the depriva-tion must be a person who may fairly be said to be a state
actor." Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U. S. 922, 937(1982); see

Flagg Bros., Inc. v. Brooks, 436 U. S. 149, 156(1978). In this case, while it may fairly be said that private

insurers act " `with the knowledge of and pursuant to' " thestate statute, ibid. (quoting Adickes v. S. H. Kress & Co., 398
U. S. 144, 162, n. 23 (1970)), thus satisfying the first require-ment, respondents still must satisfy the second, whether the
allegedly unconstitutional conduct is fairly attributable tothe State.

8 Where, as here, deprivations of rights under the Fourteenth Amendment are alleged, these two requirements converge. See Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U. S. 922, 935, n. 18 (1982).

9 Respondents' reliance on Tulsa Professional Collection Services, Inc.

v. Pope, 485 U. S. 478 (1988), as support for their position is misplaced.
Nowhere in Tulsa did we characterize petitioner's claim as a "facial" or
"direct" challenge to the Oklahoma "nonclaim" statute at issue there. Instead, we analyzed petitioner's challenge under our traditional two-step
approach, requiring both action taken pursuant to state law and significant

51Cite as: 526 U. S. 40 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
Our approach to this latter question begins by identifying
"the specific conduct of which the plaintiff complains."
Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U. S., at 1004; see id., at 1003 ("Faithful adherence to the `state action' requirement . . . requires
careful attention to the gravamen of the plaintiff 's complaint"). Here, respondents named as defendants both public officials and a class of private insurers and self-insured
employers. Also named is the director of the SWIF and the
School District of Philadelphia, a municipal corporation.
The complaint alleged that the state and private defendants,
acting under color of state law and pursuant to the Act, deprived them of property in violation of due process by withholding payment for medical treatment without prior notice
and an opportunity to be heard. All agree that the public
officials responsible for administering the workers' compensation system and the director of SWIF are state actors.
See 139 F. 3d, at 167.10 Thus, the issue we address, in
accordance with our cases, is whether a private insurer's
decision to withhold payment for disputed medical treatment may be fairly attributable to the State so as to subject
insurers to the constraints of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Our answer to that question is "no."

state involvement. See id., at 486-487. While it may be true, as respondents argue, that the utilization review procedure here, like the nonclaim statute in Tulsa, is not "self-executing," that fact does not relieve
respondents of establishing both requisites of state action. Tulsa does
not suggest otherwise.

10 At the same time the District Court dismissed the private insurers, it

refused to grant the school district's motion to dismiss for lack of state
action (the school district argued that because it contracted out its responsibilities as a self-insurer to a private company, it was not a state actor),
leaving the question of the school district's status unresolved pending further discovery. Sullivan v. Barnett, 913 F. Supp. 895, 905 (ED Pa. 1996).
The District Court's later ruling on the due process question obviated any
need to decide whether the school district acted under color of state law,
nor did the Court of Appeals rule on that question. See 139 F. 3d, at 167,
and n. 16.

52 AMERICAN MFRS. MUT. INS. CO. v. SULLIVAN

Opinion of the Court
In cases involving extensive state regulation of private ac-tivity, we have consistently held that "[t]he mere fact that a

business is subject to state regulation does not by itself con-vert its action into that of the State for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment." Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co.,
419 U. S. 345, 350 (1974); see Blum, 457 U. S., at 1004.Faithful application of the state-action requirement in these

cases ensures that the prerogative of regulating privatebusiness remains with the States and the representative
branches, not the courts. Thus, the private insurers in thiscase will not be held to constitutional standards unless
"there is a sufficiently close nexus between the State and the
challenged action of the regulated entity so that the action
of the latter may be fairly treated as that of the State itself."
Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). Whether such a
"close nexus" exists, our cases state, depends on whether the
State "has exercised coercive power or has provided such
significant encouragement, either overt or covert, that the
choice must in law be deemed to be that of the State." Ibid.;
see Flagg Bros., supra, at 166; Jackson, supra, at 357; Moose
Lodge No. 107 v. Irvis, 407 U. S. 163, 173 (1972); Adickes v.
S. H. Kress & Co., supra, at 170. Action taken by private
entities with the mere approval or acquiescence of the State
is not state action. Blum, supra, at 1004-1005; Flagg Bros.,
supra, at 154-165; Jackson, supra, at 357.

Here, respondents do not assert that the decision to invoke
utilization review should be attributed to the State because
the State compels or is directly involved in that decision.
Obviously the State is not so involved. It authorizes, but
does not require, insurers to withhold payments for disputed
medical treatment. The decision to withhold payment, like
the decision to transfer Medicaid patients to a lower level of
care in Blum, is made by concededly private parties, and
"turns on . . . judgments made by private parties" without
"standards . . . established by the State." Blum, supra, at
1008.

53Cite as: 526 U. S. 40 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
Respondents do assert, however, that the decision to with-hold payment to providers may be fairly attributable to the

State because the State has "authorized" and "encouraged"it. Respondents' primary argument in this regard is that,
in amending the Act to provide for utilization review and to
grant insurers an option they previously did not have, theState purposely "encouraged" insurers to withhold payments

for disputed medical treatment. This argument reads toomuch into the State's reform, and in any event cannot be
squared with our cases.We do not doubt that the State's decision to provide insurers the option of deferring payment for unnecessary and unreasonable treatment pending review can in some sense be
seen as encouraging them to do just that. But, as petitioners note, this kind of subtle encouragement is no more significant than that which inheres in the State's creation or
modification of any legal remedy. We have never held that
the mere availability of a remedy for wrongful conduct, even
when the private use of that remedy serves important public
interests, so significantly encourages the private activity as
to make the State responsible for it. See Tulsa Professional Collection Services, Inc. v. Pope, 485 U. S. 478, 485
(1988) ("Private use of state-sanctioned private remedies or
procedures does not rise to the level of state action"); see
also Lugar, 457 U. S., at 937; Flagg Bros., 436 U. S., at 165-
166. It bears repeating that a finding of state action on this
basis would be contrary to the "essential dichotomy," Jackson, supra, at 349, between public and private acts that our
cases have consistently recognized.

The State's decision to allow insurers to withhold payments pending review can just as easily be seen as state
inaction, or more accurately, a legislative decision not to intervene in a dispute between an insurer and an employee
over whether a particular treatment is reasonable and necessary. See Flagg Bros., 436 U. S., at 164-165. Before the
1993 amendments, Pennsylvania restricted the ability of an

526US1 Unit: $U29 [01-03-01 13:04:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN
54 AMERICAN MFRS. MUT. INS. CO. v. SULLIVAN

Opinion of the Court
insurer (after liability had been established, of course) todefer workers' compensation medical benefits, including payment for unreasonable and unnecessary treatment, beyond30 days of receipt of the bill. The 1993 amendments, in
effect, restored to insurers the narrow option, historically
exercised by employers and insurers before the adoption ofPennsylvania's workers' compensation law, to defer payment

of a bill until it is substantiated. The most that can be saidof the statutory scheme, therefore, is that whereas it previously prohibited insurers from withholding payment fordisputed medical services, it no longer does so. Such permission of a private choice cannot support a finding of state
action. As we have said before, our cases will not tolerate
"the imposition of Fourteenth Amendment restraints on private action by the simple device of characterizing the State's
inaction as `authorization' or `encouragement.' " Ibid.

Nor does the State's role in creating, supervising, and setting standards for the URO process differ in any meaningful
sense from the creation and administration of any forum for
resolving disputes. While the decision of a URO, like that
of any judicial official, may properly be considered state action, a private party's mere use of the State's dispute resolution machinery, without the "overt, significant assistance of
state officials," Tulsa, supra, at 486, cannot.

The State, in the course of administering a many-faceted
remedial system, has shifted one facet from favoring the employees to favoring the employer. This sort of decision occurs regularly in legislative review of such systems. But it
cannot be said that such a change "encourages" or "authorizes" the insurer's actions as those terms are used in our
state-action jurisprudence.

We also reject the notion, relied upon by the Court of Appeals, that the challenged decisions are state action because
insurers must first obtain "authorization" or "permission"
from the Bureau before withholding payment. See 139
F. 3d, at 168. As described in our earlier summary of the

Opinion of the Court
statute and regulations, the Bureau's participation is limitedto requiring insurers to file "a form prescribed by the Bureau," 34 Pa. Code $ 127.452, processing the request for tech-nical compliance, and then forwarding the matter to a URO
and informing the parties that utilization review has been
requested. In Blum, we rejected the notion that the State,"by requiring completion of a form," 457 U. S., at 1007, is

responsible for the private party's decision. The additional"paper shuffling" performed by the Bureau here in response
to an insurers' request does not alter that conclusion.Respondents next contend that state action is present because the State has delegated to insurers "powers traditionally exclusively reserved to the State." Jackson, 419 U. S.,
at 352. Their argument here is twofold. Relying on West
v. Atkins, 487 U. S. 42 (1988), respondents first argue that
workers' compensation benefits are state-mandated "public
benefits," and that the State has delegated the provision of
these "public benefits" to private insurers. They also contend that the State has delegated to insurers the traditionally exclusive government function of determining whether
and under what circumstances an injured worker's medical
benefits may be suspended. The Court of Appeals apparently agreed on both points, stating that insurers "providing
public benefits which honor State entitlements . . . become
an arm of the State, fulfilling a uniquely governmental obligation," 139 F. 3d, at 168, and that "[t]he right to invoke the
supersedeas, or to stop payments, is a power that traditionally was held in the hands of the State," ibid.

We think neither argument has merit. West is readily distinguishable: There the State was constitutionally obligated
to provide medical treatment to injured inmates, and the delegation of that traditionally exclusive public function to a
private physician gave rise to a finding of state action. See
487 U. S., at 54-56. Here, on the other hand, nothing in
Pennsylvania's Constitution or statutory scheme obligates
the State to provide either medical treatment or work526US1 Unit: $U29 [01-03-01 13:04:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN
56 AMERICAN MFRS. MUT. INS. CO. v. SULLIVAN

Opinion of the Court
ers' compensation benefits to injured workers. See Blum,
supra, at 1011. Instead, the State's workers' compensation
law imposes that obligation on employers. This case is
therefore not unlike Jackson, supra, where we noted that
"while the Pennsylvania statute imposes an obligation to furnish service on regulated utilities, it imposes no such obligation on the State." Id., at 353; see also San Francisco
Arts & Athletics, Inc. v. United States Olympic Comm., 483
U. S. 522, 544 (1987) ("The fact `[t]hat a private entity performs a function which serves the public does not make its
acts [governmental] action' ") (quoting Rendell-Baker v.
Kohn, 457 U. S. 830, 842 (1982)).11

Nor is there any merit in respondents' argument that the
State has delegated to insurers the traditionally exclusive
governmental function of deciding whether to suspend payment for disputed medical treatment. Historical practice,
as well as the state statutory scheme, does not support respondents' characterization. It is no doubt true that before
the 1993 amendments an insurer who sought to withhold
payment for disputed medical treatment was required to petition the Bureau, and could withhold payment only upon a
favorable ruling by a workers' compensation judge, and then
only for prospective treatment.

But before Pennsylvania ever adopted its workers' compensation law, an insurer under contract with an employer
to pay for its workers' reasonable and necessary medical expenses could withhold payment, for any reason or no reason,
without any authorization or involvement of the State. The

11 The fact that the State has established a Workers' Compensation Security Fund to guarantee the payment of medical benefits in the event an
insurer becomes insolvent, see 77 Pa. Stat. Ann. $ 1053 (Purdon 1992), does
not mean, as respondents suggest, that the State has created a selfimposed obligation to provide benefits. The security fund is financed entirely through assessments on insurers and receives no financial assistance
from the State. $ 1055; see D. Ballantyne & C. Telles, Workers Compensation Research Institute, Workers' Compensation in Pennsylvania 15 (1991).

Opinion of the Court
insurer, of course, might become liable to the employer (orits workers) if the refusal to pay breached the contract or

constituted "bad faith," but the obligation to pay would onlyarise after the employer had initiated a claim and reduced it
to a judgment. That Pennsylvania first recognized an insurer's traditionally private prerogative to withhold payment,then restricted it, and now (in one limited respect) has restored it, cannot constitute the delegation of a traditionallyexclusive public function. Like New York in

Flagg Bros.,
Pennsylvania "has done nothing more than authorize (andindeed limit)--without participation by any public official--

what [private insurers] would tend to do, even in the absence
of such authorization," i. e., withhold payment for disputed
medical treatment pending a determination that the treatment is, in fact, reasonable and necessary. 436 U. S., at
162, n. 12.

The Court of Appeals, in response to the various arguments advanced by respondents, seems to have figuratively
thrown up its hands and fallen back on language in our decision in Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority, 365 U. S.
715 (1961). The Pennsylvania system, that court said, "inextricably entangles the insurance companies in a partnership
with the Commonwealth such that they become an integral
part of the state in administering the statutory scheme."
139 F. 3d, at 170. Relying on Burton, respondents urge us
to affirm the Court of Appeals' holding under a "joint participation" theory of state action.

Burton was one of our early cases dealing with "state action" under the Fourteenth Amendment, and later cases have
refined the vague "joint participation" test embodied in that
case. Blum and Jackson, in particular, have established
that "privately owned enterprises providing services that
the State would not necessarily provide, even though they
are extensively regulated, do not fall within the ambit of
Burton." Blum, 457 U. S., at 1011; see Jackson, supra, at
357-358. Here, workers' compensation insurers are at least

Opinion of the Court
as extensively regulated as the private nursing facilities inBlum and the private utility in Jackson. Like those cases,

though, the state statutory and regulatory scheme leaves thechallenged decisions to the judgment of insurers.

Respondents also rely on Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co.,457 U. S. 922 (1982), which contains general language about
"joint participation" as a test for state action. But, as the
Lugar opinion itself makes clear, its language must not betorn from the context out of which it arose:

"The Court of Appeals erred in holding that in this con-text `joint participation' required something more than
invoking the aid of state officials to take advantage ofstate-created attachment procedures. . . . Whatever may
be true in other contexts, this is sufficient when theState has created a system whereby state officials will
attach property on the ex parte application of one partyto a private dispute."

Id., at 942.

In the present case, of course, there is no effort by petition-ers to seize the property of respondents by an ex parte application to a state official.We conclude that an insurer's decision to withhold payment and seek utilization review of the reasonableness andnecessity of particular medical treatment is not fairly attributable to the State. Respondents have therefore failed tosatisfy an essential element of their $ 1983 claim.

III
Though our resolution of the state-action issue would besufficient by itself to reverse the judgment of the Court of

Appeals, we believe the court fundamentally misappre-hended the nature of respondents' property interest at stake
in this case, with ramifications not only for the state officialswho are concededly state actors, but also for the private insurers who (under our holding in Part II) are not. If theCourt of Appeals' ruling is left undisturbed, SWIF, which

Opinion of the Court
insures both public and private employers, will be requiredto pay for all medical treatment (reasonable and necessary

or not) within 30 days, while private insurers will be ableto defer payment for disputed treatment pending utilization
review.12 Although we denied the petitions for certiorarifiled by the school district, 525 U. S. 824 (1998), and the various state officials, 525 U. S. 824 (1998), we granted both ques-tions presented in the petition filed by the private insurance
companies. The second question therein states:

"Whether the Due Process Clause requires workers'compensation insurers to pay disputed medical bills

prior to a determination that the medical treatment wasreasonable and necessary." Pet. for Cert. (i).

This question has been briefed and argued, it is an importantone, and it is squarely presented for review. We thus proceed to address it.The first inquiry in every due process challenge is whether
the plaintiff has been deprived of a protected interest in"property" or "liberty." See U. S. Const., Amdt. 14 ("nor
shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or prop-erty, without due process of law"); Mathews v. Eldridge, 424
U. S. 319, 332 (1976). Only after finding the deprivation of aprotected interest do we look to see if the State's procedures
comport with due process. Ibid.Here, respondents contend that Pennsylvania's workers'
compensation law confers upon them a protected propertyinterest in workers' compensation medical benefits. Under
state law, respondents assert, once an employer's liability isestablished for a particular work-related injury, the em12 SWIF, like all insurers and self-insured employers, is entitled to reimbursement from the state supersedeas fund for treatment later determined to be unreasonable or unnecessary. See n. 2, supra. Because this
fund is maintained through assessments on all insurers, the Court of
Appeals' ruling, if left undisturbed, would likely cause distinct injury to
private insurers.

Opinion of the Court
ployer is obligated to pay for certain benefits, including par-tial wage replacement, compensation for permanent injury

or disability, and medical care. See 77 Pa. Stat. Ann. $$ 431,531 (Purdon Supp. 1998). It follows from this, the argument
goes, that medical benefits are a state-created entitlement,
and thus an insurer cannot withhold payment of medical ben-efits without affording an injured worker due process.

In Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U. S. 254 (1970), we held that anindividual receiving federal welfare assistance has a statutorily created property interest in the continued receipt ofthose benefits. Likewise, in

Mathews, supra, we recognized
that the same was true for an individual receiving SocialSecurity disability benefits. In both cases, an individual's

entitlement to benefits had been established, and the question presented was whether predeprivation notice and ahearing were required before the individual's interest in

continued payment of benefits could be terminated. See
Goldberg, supra, at 261-263; Mathews, supra, at 332.

Respondents' property interest in this case, however, isfundamentally different. Under Pennsylvania law, an employee is not entitled to payment for all medical treatmentonce the employer's initial liability is established, as respondents' argument assumes. Instead, the law expressly
limits an employee's entitlement to "reasonable" and "necessary" medical treatment, and requires that disputes over
the reasonableness and necessity of particular treatment
must be resolved before an employer's obligation to pay--
and an employee's entitlement to benefits--arise. See 77
Pa. Stat. Ann. $ 531(1)(i) (Purdon Supp. 1998) ("The employer shall provide payment . . . for reasonable surgical

and medical services" (emphasis added)); $ 531(5) ("All payments to providers for treatment . . . shall be made within
thirty (30) days of receipt of such bills and records unless
the employer or insurer disputes the reasonableness or necessity of the treatment" (emphasis added)). Thus, for an
employee's property interest in the payment of medical benefits to attach under state law, the employee must clear two

Opinion of Ginsburg, J.
hurdles: First, he must prove that an employer is liable fora work-related injury, and second, he must establish that

the particular medical treatment at issue is reasonable andnecessary. Only then does the employee's interest parallel
that of the beneficiary of welfare assistance in Goldberg andthe recipient of disability benefits in

Mathews.Respondents obviously have not cleared both of these hurdles. While they indeed have established their initial eligi-bility for medical treatment, they have yet to make good on
their claim that the particular medical treatment they re-ceived was reasonable and necessary. Consequently, they
do not have a property interest--under the logic of their ownargument--in having their providers paid for treatment that
has yet to be found reasonable and necessary. To state theargument is to refute it, for what respondents ask in this
case is that insurers be required to pay for patently unrea-sonable, unnecessary, and even fraudulent medical care without any right, under state law, to seek reimbursement fromproviders. Unsurprisingly, the Due Process Clause does not
require such a result.Having concluded that respondents' due process claim
falters for lack of a property interest in the payment of ben-efits, we need go no further.

mands for constant payment of each medical bill, within 30days of receipt, pending determination of the necessity or

reasonableness of the medical treatment. See ante, at 61,n. 13. I do not doubt, however, that due process requires
fair procedures for the adjudication of respondents' claimsfor workers' compensation benefits, including medical care.
See Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co., 455 U. S. 422, 428-431(1982);

to all insurers, the State Workmen's Insurance Fund as wellas the private insurers. I therefore do not join the Court's
extended endeavor, in Part II, to clean up and rein in our"state action" precedent. "It is a fundamental rule of judicial restraint . . . that this Court will not reach constitutionalquestions in advance of the necessity of deciding them."
Three Affiliated Tribes of Fort Berthold Reservation v.
Wold Engineering, P. C., 467 U. S. 138, 157 (1984); see also
Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 347 (1936) (Brandeis, J.,concurring). While this rule is ordinarily invoked to avoid

deciding a constitutional question in lieu of a less tall groundfor decision, its counsel of restraint is soundly applied to the
instant situation: When a case presents two constitutionalquestions, one of which disposes of the entire case and the
other of which does not, resolution of the case-dispositivequestion should suffice.

respondents "do not contend that they have a property interest in their claims for payment, as distinct from the
payments themselves." Ante, at 61, n. 13. I would add,
however, that there may be individual circumstances in
which the receipt of earlier payments leads an injured
person reasonably to expect their continuation, in which
case that person may well possess a constitutionally protected "property" interest. See, e. g., Board of Regents
of State Colleges v. Roth, 408 U. S. 564, 577 (1972) ("It is a
purpose of the ancient institution of property to protect
those claims upon which people rely in their daily lives, reliance that must not be arbitrarily undermined"); Perry v.
Sindermann, 408 U. S. 593, 601 (1972); Goldberg v. Kelly,

397 U. S. 254, 262, and n. 8 (1970); Mathews v. Eldridge,
424 U. S. 319, 332 (1976).

Justice Stevens, concurring in part and dissenting in
part.

Because the individual respondents suffered work-related
injuries, they are entitled to have their employers, or the
employers' insurers, pay for whatever "reasonable" and "necessary" treatment they may need. Pa. Stat. Ann., Tit. 77,

$$ 531(1)(i), (5) (Purdon Supp. 1998). That right--whether
described as a "claim" for payment or a "cause of action"--
is unquestionably a species of property protected by the Due
Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. See, e. g.,
Tulsa Professional Collection Services, Inc. v. Pope, 485
U. S. 478, 485 (1988). Disputes over the reasonableness or
necessity of particular treatments are resolved by decisionmakers who are state actors and who must follow procedures established by Pennsylvania law. Because the resolution of such disputes determines the scope of the claimants'
property interests, the Constitution requires that the procedure be fair. Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co., 455 U. S. 422

Opinion of Stevens, J.
(1982).* That is true whether the claim is asserted againsta private insurance carrier or against a public entity that

self-insures. It is equally clear that the State's duty to es-tablish and administer a fair procedure for resolving the dispute obtains whether the dispute is initiated by the filing ofa claim or by an insurer's decision to withhold payment until
the reasonableness issue is resolved.In my judgment, the significant questions raised by this
case are: (1) as in any case alleging that state statutory proc-esses violate the Fourteenth Amendment, whether Pennsylvania's procedure was fair when the case was commenced,and (2), if not, whether it was fair after the State modified
its rules in response to the Court of Appeals' decision. Seeante, at 46, n. 3. In my opinion, the Court of Appeals correctly concluded that the original procedure was deficientbecause it did not give employees either notice that a request
for utilization review would automatically suspend their ben-efits or an opportunity to provide relevant evidence and argument to the state actor vested with initial decisional au-thority. I would therefore affirm the judgment of the Court
of Appeals insofar as it mandated the change described inthe Court's n. 3,

ante, at 46. I do not, however, find anyconstitutional defect in the procedures that are now in place,

and therefore agree that the judgment should be reversed tothe extent that it requires any additional modifications. It
is not unfair, in and of itself, for a State to allow either aprivate or a publicly owned party to withhold payment of a
state-created entitlement pending resolution of a disputeover its amount.

Thus, although I agree with much of what the Court haswritten, I do not join its opinion for two reasons. First, I
think it incorrectly assumes that the question whether the

CEDAR RAPIDS COMMUNITY SCHOOL DISTRICT v.GARRET F.,

CHARLENE F.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eighth circuit

No. 96-1793. Argued November 4, 1998--Decided March 3, 1999
To help "assure that all children with disabilities have available to

them . . . a free appropriate public education which emphasizes special
education and related services designed to meet their unique needs,"
20 U. S. C. $ 1400(c), the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act
(IDEA) authorizes federal financial assistance to States that agree to
provide such children with special education and "related services," as
defined in $ 1401(a)(17). Respondent Garret F., a student in petitioner
school district (District), is wheelchair-bound and ventilator dependent;
he therefore requires, in part, a responsible individual nearby to attend
to certain physical needs during the schoolday. The District declined
to accept financial responsibility for the services Garret needs, believing
that it was not legally obligated to provide continuous one-on-one nursing care. At an Iowa Department of Education hearing, an Administrative Law Judge concluded that the IDEA required the District to bear
financial responsibility for all of the disputed services, finding that most
of them are already provided for some other students; that the District
did not contend that only a licensed physician could provide the services;
and that applicable federal regulations require the District to furnish
"school health services," which are provided by a "qualified school nurse
or other qualified person," but not "medical services," which are limited
to services provided by a physician. The Federal District Court agreed
and the Court of Appeals affirmed, concluding that Irving Independent School Dist. v. Tatro, 468 U. S. 883, provided a two-step analysis
of $ 1401(a)(17)'s "related services" definition that was satisfied here.
First, the requested services were "supportive services" because Garret
cannot attend school unless they are provided; and second, the services
were not excluded as "medical services" under Tatro's bright-line test:
Services provided by a physician (other than for diagnostic and evaluation purposes) are subject to the medical services exclusion, but services
that can be provided by a nurse or qualified layperson are not.

Held: The IDEA requires the District to provide Garret with the nursing

services he requires during school hours. The IDEA's "related services" definition, Tatro, and the overall statutory scheme support the

Syllabus
Court of Appeals' decision. The "related services" definition broadly
encompasses those supportive services that "may be required to assist
a child with a disability to benefit from special education," $ 1401(a)(17),
and the District does not challenge the Court of Appeals' conclusion
that the services at issue are "supportive services." Furthermore,

$ 1401(a)(17)'s general "related services" definition is illuminated by a
parenthetical phrase listing examples of services that are included
within the statute's coverage, including "medical services" if they are
"for diagnostic and evaluation purposes." Although the IDEA itself
does not define "medical services" more specifically, this Court in Tatro
concluded that the Secretary of Education had reasonably determined
that "medical services" referred to services that must be performed by
a physician, and not to school health services. 468 U. S., at 892-894.
The cost-based, multifactor test proposed by the District is supported
by neither the statute's text nor the regulations upheld in Tatro. Moreover, the District offers no explanation why characteristics such as cost
make one service any more "medical" than another. Absent an elaboration of the statutory terms plainly more convincing than that reviewed
in Tatro, there is no reason to depart from settled law. Although the
District may have legitimate concerns about the financial burden of providing the services Garret needs, accepting its cost-based standard as
the sole test for determining $ 1401(a)(17)'s scope would require the
Court to engage in judicial lawmaking without any guidance from Congress. It would also create tension with the IDEA's purposes, since
Congress intended to open the doors of public education to all qualified
children and required participating States to educate disabled children

Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court.
The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA),84 Stat. 175, as amended, was enacted, in part, "to assure

that all children with disabilities have available to them . . .a free appropriate public education which emphasizes special
education and related services designed to meet their uniqueneeds." 20 U. S. C. $ 1400(c). Consistent with this purpose,
the IDEA authorizes federal financial assistance to Statesthat agree to provide disabled children with special education and "related services." See $$ 1401(a)(18), 1412(1).The question presented in this case is whether the definition
of "related services" in $ 1401(a)(17) 1 requires a public school

1 "The term `related services' means transportation, and such developmental, corrective, and other supportive services (including speech pathology and audiology, psychological services, physical and occupational therapy, recreation, including therapeutic recreation, social work services,
counseling services, including rehabilitation counseling, and medical services, except that such medical services shall be for diagnostic and evaluation purposes only) as may be required to assist a child with a disability
to benefit from special education, and includes the early identification and
assessment of disabling conditions in children." 20 U. S. C. $ 1401(a)(17).

Originally, the statute was enacted without a definition of "related services." See Education of the Handicapped Act, 84 Stat. 175. In 1975,
Congress added the definition at issue in this case. Education for All
Handicapped Children Act of 1975, $ 4(a)(4), 89 Stat. 775. Aside from nonsubstantive changes and added examples of included services, see, e. g.,

Opinion of the Court
district in a participating State to provide a ventilator-dependent student with certain nursing services during

school hours. I

Respondent Garret F. is a friendly, creative, and intelligentyoung man. When Garret was four years old, his spinal
column was severed in a motorcycle accident. Thoughparalyzed from the neck down, his mental capacities were
unaffected. He is able to speak, to control his motorizedwheelchair through use of a puff and suck straw, and to operate a computer with a device that responds to head move-ments. Garret is currently a student in the Cedar Rapids
Community School District (District), he attends regularclasses in a typical school program, and his academic performance has been a success. Garret is, however, ventilatordependent,

2 and therefore requires a responsible individual

nearby to attend to certain physical needs while he is inschool.

Amendments of 1990, $ 101(c), 104 Stat. 1103, the relevant language in

$ 1401(a)(17) has not been amended since 1975. All references to the
IDEA herein are to the 1994 version as codified in Title 20 of the United
States Code--the version of the statute in effect when this dispute arose.

2 In his report in this case, the Administrative Law Judge explained:

"Being ventilator dependent means that [Garret] breathes only with external aids, usually an electric ventilator, and occasionally by someone else's
manual pumping of an air bag attached to his tracheotomy tube when
the ventilator is being maintained. This later procedure is called ambu
bagging." App. to Pet. for Cert. 19a.

3 "He needs assistance with urinary bladder catheterization once a day,

the suctioning of his tracheotomy tube as needed, but at least once every
six hours, with food and drink at lunchtime, in getting into a reclining
position for five minutes of each hour, and ambu bagging occasionally as
needed when the ventilator is checked for proper functioning. He also
needs assistance from someone familiar with his ventilator in the event
there is a malfunction or electrical problem, and someone who can perform
emergency procedures in the event he experiences autonomic hyperreflexia. Autonomic hyperreflexia is an uncontrolled visceral reaction to
anxiety or a full bladder. Blood pressure increases, heart rate increases,

70 CEDAR RAPIDS COMMUNITY SCHOOL DIST. v. GARRET F.

Opinion of the Court
During Garret's early years at school his family providedfor his physical care during the schoolday. When he was in

kindergarten, his 18-year-old aunt attended him; in the nextfour years, his family used settlement proceeds they received
after the accident, their insurance, and other resources toemploy a licensed practical nurse. In 1993, Garret's mother
requested the District to accept financial responsibility forthe health care services that Garret requires during the
schoolday. The District denied the request, believing thatit was not legally obligated to provide continuous one-on-one
nursing services.Relying on both the IDEA and Iowa law, Garret's mother
requested a hearing before the Iowa Department of Edu-cation. An Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) received
extensive evidence concerning Garret's special needs, theDistrict's treatment of other disabled students, and the
assistance provided to other ventilator-dependent children inother parts of the country. In his 47-page report, the ALJ
found that the District has about 17,500 students, of whomapproximately 2,200 need some form of special education or
special services. Although Garret is the only ventilator-dependent student in the District, most of the health care
services that he needs are already provided for some otherstudents.

4 "The primary difference between Garret's situation and that of other students is his dependency on his ven-tilator for life support." App. to Pet. for Cert. 28a. The

ALJ noted that the parties disagreed over the training or
and flushing and sweating may occur. Garret has not experienced autonomic hyperreflexia frequently in recent years, and it has usually been
alleviated by catheterization. He has not ever experienced autonomic
hyperreflexia at school. Garret is capable of communicating his needs
orally or in another fashion so long as he has not been rendered unable to
do so by an extended lack of oxygen." Id., at 20a.

4 "Included are such services as care for students who need urinary catheterization, food and drink, oxygen supplement positioning, and suctioning." Id., at 28a; see also id., at 53a.

Opinion of the Court
licensure required for the care and supervision of such stu-dents, and that those providing such care in other parts of

the country ranged from nonlicensed personnel to registerednurses. However, the District did not contend that only a
licensed physician could provide the services in question.The ALJ explained that federal law requires that children
with a variety of health impairments be provided with "spe-cial education and related services" when their disabilities
adversely affect their academic performance, and that suchchildren should be educated to the maximum extent appropriate with children who are not disabled. In addition, theALJ explained that applicable federal regulations distinguish between "school health services," which are providedby a "qualified school nurse or other qualified person," and
"medical services," which are provided by a licensed physi-cian. See 34 CFR $$ 300.16(a), (b)(4), (b)(11) (1998). The
District must provide the former, but need not provide thelatter (except, of course, those "medical services" that are for
diagnostic or evaluation purposes, 20 U. S. C. $ 1401(a)(17)).According to the ALJ, the distinction in the regulations does
not just depend on "the title of the person providing theservice"; instead, the "medical services" exclusion is limited
to services that are "in the special training, knowledge, andjudgment of a physician to carry out." App. to Pet. for Cert.
51a. The ALJ thus concluded that the IDEA required theDistrict to bear financial responsibility for all of the services
in dispute, including continuous nursing services.5

5 In addition, the ALJ's opinion contains a thorough discussion of "other
tests and criteria" pressed by the District, id., at 52a, including the burden
on the District and the cost of providing assistance to Garret. Although
the ALJ found no legal authority for establishing a cost-based test for
determining what related services are required by the statute, he went on
to reject the District's arguments on the merits. See id., at 42a-53a. We
do not reach the issue here, but the ALJ also found that Garret's in-school
needs must be met by the District under an Iowa statute as well as the
IDEA. Id., at 54a-55a.

72 CEDAR RAPIDS COMMUNITY SCHOOL DIST. v. GARRET F.

Opinion of the Court
The District challenged the ALJ's decision in Federal Dis-trict Court, but that court approved the ALJ's IDEA ruling

and granted summary judgment against the District. Id.,at 9a, 15a. The Court of Appeals affirmed. 106 F. 3d 822
(CA8 1997). It noted that, as a recipient of federal funds
under the IDEA, Iowa has a statutory duty to provide alldisabled children a "free appropriate public education,"

which includes "related services." See id., at 824. TheCourt of Appeals read our opinion in

Irving Independent
School Dist. v. Tatro, 468 U. S. 883 (1984), to provide atwo-step analysis of the "related services" definition in

$ 1401(a)(17)--asking first, whether the requested services
are included within the phrase "supportive services"; and
second, whether the services are excluded as "medical services." 106 F. 3d, at 824-825. The Court of Appeals succinctly answered both questions in Garret's favor. The
court found the first step plainly satisfied, since Garret cannot attend school unless the requested services are available
during the schoolday. Id., at 825. As to the second step, the
court reasoned that Tatro "established a bright-line test: the
services of a physician (other than for diagnostic and evaluation purposes) are subject to the medical services exclusion, but services that can be provided in the school setting
by a nurse or qualified layperson are not." 106 F. 3d, at 825.

In its petition for certiorari, the District challenged only
the second step of the Court of Appeals' analysis. The District pointed out that some federal courts have not asked
whether the requested health services must be delivered by
a physician, but instead have applied a multifactor test that
considers, generally speaking, the nature and extent of the
services at issue. See, e. g., Neely v. Rutherford County
School, 68 F. 3d 965, 972-973 (CA6 1995), cert. denied, 517
U. S. 1134 (1996); Detsel v. Board of Ed. of Auburn Enlarged
City School Dist., 820 F. 2d 587, 588 (CA2) (per curiam),
cert. denied, 484 U. S. 981 (1987). We granted the District's
petition to resolve this conflict. 523 U. S. 1117 (1998).

Opinion of the Court

II
The District contends that $ 1401(a)(17) does not require itto provide Garret with "continuous one-on-one nursing services" during the schoolday, even though Garret cannot re-main in school without such care. Brief for Petitioner 10.
However, the IDEA's definition of "related services," our de-cision in

Irving Independent School Dist. v. Tatro, 468 U. S.883 (1984), and the overall statutory scheme all support the

decision of the Court of Appeals.The text of the "related services" definition, see n. 1,
supra, broadly encompasses those supportive services that"may be required to assist a child with a disability to benefit
from special education." As we have already noted, the Dis-trict does not challenge the Court of Appeals' conclusion that
the in-school services at issue are within the covered cate-gory of "supportive services." As a general matter, services that enable a disabled child to remain in school duringthe day provide the student with "the meaningful access to
education that Congress envisioned." Tatro, 468 U. S., at891 (" `Congress sought primarily to make public education
available to handicapped children' and `to make such accessmeaningful' " (quoting Board of Ed. of Hendrick Hudson
Central School Dist., Westchester Cty. v. Rowley, 458 U. S.176, 192 (1982))).

This general definition of "related services" is illuminatedby a parenthetical phrase listing examples of particular
services that are included within the statute's coverage.$ 1401(a)(17). "[M]edical services" are enumerated in this
list, but such services are limited to those that are "for diag-nostic and evaluation purposes."

Ibid. The statute doesnot contain a more specific definition of the "medical services" that are excepted from the coverage of $ 1401(a)(17).The scope of the "medical services" exclusion is not a matter of first impression in this Court. In Tatro we concludedthat the Secretary of Education had reasonably determined
that the term "medical services" referred only to services

Opinion of the Court
that must be performed by a physician, and not to schoolhealth services. 468 U. S., at 892-894. Accordingly, we

held that a specific form of health care (clean intermittentcatheterization) that is often, though not always, performed
by a nurse is not an excluded medical service. We refer-enced the likely cost of the services and the competence of
school staff as justifications for drawing a line between phy-sician and other services,

ibid., but our endorsement of thatline was unmistakable.
6 It is thus settled that the phrase

6 "The regulations define `related services' for handicapped children to
include `school health services,' 34 CFR $ 300.13(a) (1983), which are defined in turn as `services provided by a qualified school nurse or other
qualified person,' $ 300.13(b)(10). `Medical services' are defined as `services provided by a licensed physician.' $ 300.13(b)(4). Thus, the Secretary has [reasonably] determined that the services of a school nurse otherwise qualifying as a `related service' are not subject to exclusion as a
`medical service,' but that the services of a physician are excludable as
such.. . . . .

". . . By limiting the `medical services' exclusion to the services of a
physician or hospital, both far more expensive, the Secretary has given
a permissible construction to the provision." 468 U. S., at 892-893 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted); see also id., at 894 ("[T]he regulations
state that school nursing services must be provided only if they can be
performed by a nurse or other qualified person, not if they must be performed by a physician").

Based on certain policy letters issued by the Department of Education,
it seems that the Secretary's post-Tatro view of the statute has not been
entirely clear. E. g., App. to Pet. for Cert. 64a. We may assume that the
Secretary has authority under the IDEA to adopt regulations that define
the "medical services" exclusion by more explicitly taking into account the
nature and extent of the requested services; and the Secretary surely has
the authority to enumerate the services that are, and are not, fairly included within the scope of $ 1407(a)(17). But the Secretary has done neither; and, in this Court, he advocates affirming the judgment of the Court
of Appeals. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 7-8, 30; see also
Auer v. Robbins, 519 U. S. 452, 462 (1997) (an agency's views as amicus
curiae may be entitled to deference). We obviously have no authority to
rewrite the regulations, and we see no sufficient reason to revise Tatro,
either.

Opinion of the Court
"medical services" in $ 1401(a)(17) does not embrace all formsof care that might loosely be described as "medical" in other

contexts, such as a claim for an income tax deduction. See26 U. S. C. $ 213(d)(1) (1994 ed. and Supp. II) (defining "medical care").

The District does not ask us to define the term so broadly.Indeed, the District does not argue that any of the items

of care that Garret needs, considered individually, could beexcluded from the scope of 20 U. S. C. $ 1401(a)(17).

7 It could

not make such an argument, considering that one of the serv-ices Garret needs (catheterization) was at issue in

Tatro, and
the others may be provided competently by a school nurseor other trained personnel. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 15a,

52a. As the ALJ concluded, most of the requested serv-ices are already provided by the District to other students,
and the in-school care necessitated by Garret's ventilator
dependency does not demand the training, knowledge, and
judgment of a licensed physician. Id., at 51a-52a. While
more extensive, the in-school services Garret needs are no
more "medical" than was the care sought in Tatro.

Instead, the District points to the combined and continuous character of the required care, and proposes a test under
which the outcome in any particular case would "depend
upon a series of factors, such as [1] whether the care is continuous or intermittent, [2] whether existing school health
personnel can provide the service, [3] the cost of the service,
and [4] the potential consequences if the service is not properly performed." Brief for Petitioner 11; see also id., at
34-35.

The District's multifactor test is not supported by any
recognized source of legal authority. The proposed factors
can be found in neither the text of the statute nor the regulations that we upheld in Tatro. Moreover, the District offers
no explanation why these characteristics make one service

Opinion of the Court
any more "medical" than another. The continuous character
of certain services associated with Garret's ventilator dependency has no apparent relationship to "medical" services,
much less a relationship of equivalence. Continuous services may be more costly and may require additional school
personnel, but they are not thereby more "medical." Whatever its imperfections, a rule that limits the medical services
exemption to physician services is unquestionably a reasonable and generally workable interpretation of the statute.
Absent an elaboration of the statutory terms plainly more
convincing than that which we reviewed in Tatro, there is no
good reason to depart from settled law.8

Finally, the District raises broader concerns about the financial burden that it must bear to provide the services that
Garret needs to stay in school. The problem for the District
in providing these services is not that its staff cannot be
trained to deliver them; the problem, the District contends,
is that the existing school health staff cannot meet all of their

8 At oral argument, the District suggested that we first consider the
nature of the requested service (either "medical" or not); then, if the service is "medical," apply the multifactor test to determine whether the service is an excluded physician service or an included school nursing service
under the Secretary of Education's regulations. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 7,
13-14. Not only does this approach provide no additional guidance for
identifying "medical" services, it is also disconnected from both the statutory text and the regulations we upheld in Irving Independent School
Dist. v. Tatro, 468 U. S. 883 (1984). "Medical" services are generally excluded from the statute, and the regulations elaborate on that statutory
term. No authority cited by the District requires an additional inquiry
if the requested service is both "related" and non-"medical." Even if

$ 1401(a)(17) demanded an additional step, the factors proposed by the District are hardly more useful in identifying "nursing" services than they
are in identifying "medical" services; and the District cannot limit educational access simply by pointing to the limitations of existing staff. As
we noted in Tatro, the IDEA requires schools to hire specially trained
personnel to meet disabled student needs. Id., at 893.

Opinion of the Court
responsibilities and provide for Garret at the same time.9Through its multifactor test, the District seeks to establish

a kind of undue-burden exemption primarily based on thecost of the requested services. The first two factors can be
seen as examples of cost-based distinctions: Intermittentcare is often less expensive than continuous care, and the
use of existing personnel is cheaper than hiring additionalemployees. The third factor--the cost of the service--
would then encompass the first two. The relevance of thefourth factor is likewise related to cost because extra care
may be necessary if potential consequences are especiallyserious.

The District may have legitimate financial concerns, butour role in this dispute is to interpret existing law. Defining
"related services" in a manner that accommodates the costconcerns Congress may have had, cf. Tatro, 468 U. S., at 892,
is altogether different from using cost itself as the definition.Given that $ 1401(a)(17) does not employ cost in its definition
of "related services" or excluded "medical services," accept-ing the District's cost-based standard as the sole test for
determining the scope of the provision would require us toengage in judicial lawmaking without any guidance from
Congress. It would also create some tension with the pur-poses of the IDEA. The statute may not require public
schools to maximize the potential of disabled students com9 See Tr. of Oral Arg. 4-5, 13; Brief for Petitioner 6-7, 9. The District,
however, will not necessarily need to hire an additional employee to meet
Garret's needs. The District already employs a one-on-one teacher associate (TA) who assists Garret during the schoolday. See App. to Pet. for
Cert. 26a-27a. At one time, Garret's TA was a licensed practical nurse
(LPN). In light of the state Board of Nursing's recent ruling that the
District's registered nurses may decide to delegate Garret's care to an
LPN, see Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 9-10 (filed Apr. 22,
1998), the dissent's future-cost estimate is speculative. See App. to Pet.
for Cert. 28a, 58a-60a (if the District could assign Garret's care to a TA
who is also an LPN, there would be "a minimum of additional expense").

mensurate with the opportunities provided to other children,
see Rowley, 458 U. S., at 200; and the potential financial burdens imposed on participating States may be relevant to arriving at a sensible construction of the IDEA, see Tatro, 468
U. S., at 892. But Congress intended "to open the door of
public education" to all qualified children and "require[d]
participating States to educate handicapped children with
nonhandicapped children whenever possible." Rowley, 458
U. S., at 192, 202; see id., at 179-181; see also Honig v. Doe,
484 U. S. 305, 310-311, 324 (1988); $$ 1412(1), (2)(C), (5)(B).10

10 The dissent's approach, which seems to be even broader than the District's, is unconvincing. The dissent's rejection of our unanimous decision
in Tatro comes 15 years too late, see Patterson v. McLean Credit Union,
491 U. S. 164, 172-173 (1989) (stare decisis has "special force" in statutory
interpretation), and it offers nothing constructive in its place. Aside from
rejecting a "provider-specific approach," the dissent cites unrelated statutes and offers a circular definition of "medical services." Post, at 81
(opinion of Thomas, J.) (" `services' that are `medical' in `nature' "). Moreover, the dissent's approach apparently would exclude most ordinary
school nursing services of the kind routinely provided to nondisabled children; that anomalous result is not easily attributable to congressional intent. See Tatro, 468 U. S., at 893.

In a later discussion the dissent does offer a specific proposal: that we
now interpret (or rewrite) the Secretary's regulations so that school districts need only provide disabled children with "health-related services
that school nurses can perform as part of their normal duties." Post,
at 85. The District does not dispute that its nurses "can perform" the
requested services, so the dissent's objection is that District nurses would
not be performing their "normal duties" if they met Garret's needs. That
is, the District would need an "additional employee." Ibid. This proposal is functionally similar to a proposed regulation--ultimately withdrawn--that would have replaced the "school health services" provision.
See 47 Fed. Reg. 33838, 33854 (1982) (the statute and regulations may not
be read to affect legal obligations to make available to handicapped children services, including school health services, made available to nonhandicapped children). The dissent's suggestion is unacceptable for several
reasons. Most important, such revisions of the regulations are better left
to the Secretary, and an additional staffing need is generally not a sufficient objection to the requirements of $ 1401(a)(17). See n. 8, supra.

Thomas, J., dissenting
This case is about whether meaningful access to the publicschools will be assured, not the level of education that a

school must finance once access is attained. It is undisputedthat the services at issue must be provided if Garret is to
remain in school. Under the statute, our precedent, and thepurposes of the IDEA, the District must fund such "related
services" in order to help guarantee that students like Garretare integrated into the public schools.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is accordingly

Affirmed.
Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Kennedy joins,dissenting.

The majority, relying heavily on our decision in Irving In-dependent School Dist. v. Tatro, 468 U. S. 883 (1984), concludes that the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act(IDEA), 20 U. S. C. $ 1400 et seq., requires a public school
district to fund continuous, one-on-one nursing care for dis-abled children. Because

Tatro cannot be squared with thetext of IDEA, the Court should not adhere to it in this case.

Even assuming that Tatro was correct in the first instance,the majority's extension of it is unwarranted and ignores the
constitutionally mandated rules of construction applicable tolegislation enacted pursuant to Congress' spending power.

I
As the majority recounts, ante, at 68, IDEA authorizes theprovision of federal financial assistance to States that agree

to provide, inter alia, "special education and related serv-ices" for disabled children. $ 1401(a)(18). In

Tatro, supra,we held that this provision of IDEA required a school district to provide clean intermittent catheterization to a dis-abled child several times a day. In so holding, we relied on
Department of Education regulations, which we concludedhad reasonably interpreted IDEA's definition of "related

services" 1 to require school districts in participating Statesto provide "school nursing services" (of which we assumed

catheterization was a subcategory) but not "services of aphysician." Id., at 892-893. This holding is contrary to the
plain text of IDEA, and its reliance on the Department ofEducation's regulations was misplaced.

A
Before we consider whether deference to an agency regu-lation is appropriate, "we first ask whether Congress has `directly spoken to the precise question at issue. If the intentof Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the
court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambig-uously expressed intent of Congress.' " National Credit
Union Admin. v. First Nat. Bank & Trust Co., 522 U. S. 479,499-500 (1998) (quoting Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842-843 (1984)).Unfortunately, the Court in Tatro failed to consider this
necessary antecedent question before turning to the Depart-ment of Education's regulations implementing IDEA's related services provision. The Court instead began "with theregulations of the Department of Education, which," it said,
"are entitled to deference." 468 U. S., at 891-892. TheCourt need not have looked beyond the text of IDEA, which
expressly indicates that school districts are not required toprovide medical services, except for diagnostic and evaluation purposes. 20 U. S. C. $ 1401(a)(17). The majority as-serts that Tatro precludes reading the term "medical serv1 IDEA currently defines "related services" as "transportation, and such

ices" to include "all forms of care that might loosely bedescribed as `medical.' " Ante, at 75. The majority does

not explain, however, why "services" that are "medical" innature are not "medical services." Not only is the definition
that the majority rejects consistent with other uses of theterm in federal law,

2 it also avoids the anomalous result of

holding that the services at issue in Tatro (as well as in thiscase), while not "medical services," would nonetheless qualify as medical care for federal income tax purposes. Ante,at 74-75.

The primary problem with Tatro, and the majority's reli-ance on it today, is that the Court focused on the provider of
the services rather than the services themselves. We do nottypically think that automotive services are limited to those
provided by a mechanic, for example. Rather, anythingdone to repair or service a car, no matter who does the work,
is thought to fall into that category. Similarly, the term"food service" is not generally thought to be limited to work
performed by a chef. The term "medical" similarly does notsupport Tatro's provider-specific approach, but encompasses
services that are "of, relating to, or concerned with physi-cians

or with the practice of medicine." See Webster'sThird New International Dictionary 1402 (1986) (emphasis

added); see also id., at 1551 (defining "nurse" as "a personskilled in caring for and waiting on the infirm, the injured,
or the sick; specif: one esp. trained to carry out such dutiesunder the supervision of a physician").

2 See, e. g., 38 U. S. C. $ 1701(6) ("The term `medical services' includes, in
addition to medical examination, treatment, and rehabilitative services--
. . . surgical services, dental services . . . , optometric and podiatric
services, . . . preventive health services, . . . [and] such consultation, professional counseling, training, and mental health services as are necessary in

IDEA's structure and purpose reinforce this textual inter-pretation. Congress enacted IDEA to increase the educational opportunities available to disabled children, not toprovide medical care for them. See 20 U. S. C. $ 1400(c) ("It
is the purpose of this chapter to assure that all children withdisabilities have . . . a free appropriate public education");
see also $ 1412 ("In order to qualify for assistance . . . a Stateshall demonstrate . . . [that it] has in effect a policy that
assures all children with disabilities the right to a free appro-priate public education");

Board of Ed. of Hendrick HudsonCentral School Dist., Westchester Cty. v. Rowley, 458 U. S.

176, 179 (1982) ("The Act represents an ambitious federaleffort to promote the education of handicapped children").
As such, where Congress decided to require a supportiveservice--including speech pathology, occupational therapy,
and audiology--that appears "medical" in nature, it took careto do so explicitly. See $ 1401(a)(17). Congress specified
these services precisely because it recognized that theywould otherwise fall under the broad "medical services" exclusion. Indeed, when it crafted the definition of relatedservices, Congress could have, but chose not to, include "nursing services" in this list. B

Tatro was wrongly decided even if the phrase "medicalservices" was subject to multiple constructions, and therefore, deference to any reasonable Department of Educationregulation was appropriate. The Department of Education
has never promulgated regulations defining the scope ofIDEA's "medical services" exclusion. One year before Tatro
was decided, the Secretary of Education issued proposedregulations that defined excluded medical services as "services relating to the practice of medicine." 47 Fed. Reg.33838 (1982). These regulations, which represent the Department's only attempt to define the disputed term, werenever adopted. Instead, "[t]he regulations actually define
only those `medical services' that are owed to handicapped

children," Tatro, 468 U. S., at 892, n. 10 (emphasis in origi-nal), not those that are not. Now, as when Tatro was decided, the regulations require districts to provide servicesperformed " `by a licensed physician to determine a child's
medically related handicapping condition which results in thechild's need for special education and related services.' "
Ibid. (quoting 34 CFR $ 300.13(b)(4) (1983), recodified andamended as 34 CFR $ 300.16(b)(4) (1998).

Extrapolating from this regulation, the Tatro Court pre-sumed that this meant that " `medical services' not owed
under the statute are those `services by a licensed physician'that serve other purposes."

Tatro, supra, at 892, n. 10 (em-phasis deleted). The Court, therefore, did not defer to the

regulation itself, but rather relied on an inference drawnfrom it to speculate about how a regulation might read if the
Department of Education promulgated one. Deference inthose circumstances is impermissible. We cannot defer to a
regulation that does not exist.3

II
Assuming that Tatro was correctly decided in the first in-stance, it does not control the outcome of this case. Because

IDEA was enacted pursuant to Congress' spending power,Rowley, supra, at 190, n. 11, our analysis of the statute in
this case is governed by special rules of construction. Wehave repeatedly emphasized that, when Congress places conditions on the receipt of federal funds, "it must do so unam-biguously." Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Hal3 Nor do I think that it is appropriate to defer to the Department of
Education's litigating position in this case. The agency has had ample
opportunity to address this problem but has failed to do so in a formal
regulation. Instead, it has maintained conflicting positions about whether
the services at issue in this case are required by IDEA. See ante, at 74,
n. 6. Under these circumstances, we should not assume that the litigating
position reflects the "agency's fair and considered judgment." Auer v.
Robbins, 519 U. S. 452, 462 (1997).

South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U. S. 203, 207 (1987);
New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144, 158 (1992). Thisis because a law that "condition[s] an offer of federal funding

on a promise by the recipient . . . amounts essentially to a
contract between the Government and the recipient offunds."

Gebser v. Lago Vista Independent School Dist., 524
U. S. 274, 286 (1998). As such, "[t]he legitimacy of Congress'power to legislate under the spending power . . . rests on

whether the State voluntarily and knowingly accepts theterms of the `contract.' There can, of course, be no knowing
acceptance if a State is unaware of the conditions or is unable
to ascertain what is expected of it." Pennhurst, supra, at
17 (citations omitted). It follows that we must interpret
Spending Clause legislation narrowly, in order to avoid saddling the States with obligations that they did not anticipate.

The majority's approach in this case turns this Spending
Clause presumption on its head. We have held that, in
enacting IDEA, Congress wished to require "States to
educate handicapped children with nonhandicapped children
whenever possible," Rowley, supra, at 202. Congress, however, also took steps to limit the fiscal burdens that States
must bear in attempting to achieve this laudable goal.
These steps include requiring States to provide an education
that is only "appropriate" rather than requiring them to
maximize the potential of disabled students, see 20 U. S. C.

$ 1400(c); Rowley, supra, at 200, recognizing that integration
into the public school environment is not always possible, see

$ 1412(5), and clarifying that, with a few exceptions, public
schools need not provide "medical services" for disabled
students, $$ 1401(a)(17) and (18).

For this reason, we have previously recognized that Congress did not intend to "impos[e] upon the States a burden
of unspecified proportions and weight" in enacting IDEA.
Rowley, supra, at 190, n. 11. These federalism concerns require us to interpret IDEA's related services provision, con526US1 Unit: $U30 [12-13-00 19:17:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN

sistent with Tatro, as follows: Department of Education reg-ulations require districts to provide disabled children with

health-related services that school nurses can perform aspart of their normal duties. This reading of Tatro, although
less broad than the majority's, is equally plausible andcertainly more consistent with our obligation to interpret
Spending Clause legislation narrowly. Before concludingthat the district was required to provide clean intermittent
catheterization for Amber Tatro, we observed that schoolnurses in the district were authorized to perform services
that were "difficult to distinguish from the provision of [cleanintermittent catheterization] to the handicapped."

Tatro,468 U. S., at 893. We concluded that "[i]t would be strange

indeed if Congress, in attempting to extend special servicesto handicapped children, were unwilling to guarantee them
services of a kind that are routinely provided to the nonhand-icapped."

Id., at 893-894.Unlike clean intermittent catheterization, however, a

school nurse cannot provide the services that respondentrequires, see

ante, at 69-70, n. 3, and continue to performher normal duties. To the contrary, because respondent

requires continuous, one-on-one care throughout the entireschoolday, all agree that the district must hire an additional
employee to attend solely to respondent. This will cost aminimum of $18,000 per year. Although the majority recognizes this fact, it nonetheless concludes that the "more exten-sive" nature of the services that respondent needs is irrelevant to the question whether those services fall under themedical services exclusion.

Ante, at 75. This approach dis-regards the constitutionally mandated principles of construction applicable to Spending Clause legislation and blindsidesunwary States with fiscal obligations that they could not
have anticipated. * * *

For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.

NATIONAL FEDERATION OF FEDERAL EMPLOYEES,

LOCAL 1309 v. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fourth circuit

No. 97-1184. Argued November 9, 1998--Decided March 3, 1999*
As relevant here, the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (Statute) requires federal agencies and their employees' unions to
"meet and negotiate in good faith for the purposes of arriving at a collective bargaining agreement," 5 U. S. C. $ 7114(a)(4); and creates the Federal Labor Relations Authority, giving it broad adjudicatory, policymaking, and rulemaking powers to implement the Statute, $$ 7104, 7105.
The Authority initially held that $ 7114(a)(4)'s good-faith-bargaining requirement does not extend to union-initiated proposals during the term
of the basic contract. The D. C. Circuit disagreed, and in response, the
Authority reversed its position. In this suit, a federal employees' union
proposed including in its basic contract with a subagency of the Department of the Interior (Agency) a provision obligating the Agency to negotiate, at the union's request, about midterm matters not in the original
contract. Relying on the Fourth Circuit's view that union-initiated
midterm bargaining is inconsistent with the Statute, the Agency refused
to accept, or bargain about, the proposed clause. However, the Authority ordered the Agency to bargain. The Fourth Circuit set aside that
order, holding that the Statute prohibits such a provision.

Held: The Statute delegates to the Authority the legal power to determine whether parties must engage in midterm bargaining or bargaining
about midterm bargaining. Pp. 91-101.

(a) The Statute itself does not resolve the midterm bargaining question. Section 7114(a)(4)'s language is sufficiently ambiguous or open on
the point as to require judicial deference to reasonable interpretation or
elaboration by the agency charged with the Statute's execution. Such
ambiguity is inconsistent both with the Fourth Circuit's absolute reading that the Statute prohibits midterm bargaining and with the D. C.
Circuit's similarly absolute, but opposite, reading. It is perfectly consistent, however, with the conclusion that Congress delegated to the

Authority the power to determine whether, when, where, and what sort
of midterm bargaining is required. This conclusion is supported by the
Statute's delegation of rulemaking, adjudicatory, and policymaking powers to the Authority and by precedent recognizing the similarity of the
Authority's public-sector and the National Labor Relations Board's
private-sector roles, see Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms v.
FLRA, 464 U. S. 89, 97. Pp. 91-99.

(b) For similar reasons, the Statute also grants the Authority leeway
in answering the question whether an agency must bargain endterm
about including in the basic labor contract a midterm bargaining clause.
The Authority's judgment that the parties must bargain over such a
provision was occasioned by the D. C. Circuit's holding that the Statute
imposes a duty to bargain midterm. Since the Statute does not resolve
the question of midterm bargaining, nor the related question of bargaining about midterm bargaining, the Authority should have the opportunity to consider these questions aware that the Statute permits, but
does not compel, the conclusions it reached. Pp. 99-101.

88 FEDERAL EMPLOYEES v. DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR

Opinion of the Court
Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.
The Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute
requires federal agencies and the unions that represent their
employees to "meet and negotiate in good faith for the purposes of arriving at a collective bargaining agreement." 5
U. S. C. $ 7114(a)(4). We here consider whether that duty to
bargain extends to a clause proposed by a union that would
bind the parties to bargain midterm--that is, while the basic
comprehensive labor contract is in effect--about subjects not
included in that basic contract. We vacate a lower court
holding that the statutory duty to bargain does not encompass midterm bargaining (or bargaining about midterm bargaining). We conclude that the Statute delegates to the
Federal Labor Relations Authority the legal power to determine whether the parties must engage in midterm bargaining (or bargaining about that matter). We remand these
cases so that the Authority may exercise that power.

I
Congress enacted the Federal Service Labor-Management
Relations Statute (Statute or FSLMRS) in 1978. See 5
U. S. C. $ 7101 et seq. Declaring that "labor organizations
and collective bargaining in the civil service are in the public interest," $ 7101(a), the Statute grants federal agency
employees the right to organize, provides for collective bargaining, and defines various unfair labor practices. See

$$ 7114(a)(1), 7116. It creates the Federal Labor Relations
Authority, which it makes responsible for implementing the
Statute through the exercise of broad adjudicatory, policymaking, and rulemaking powers. $$ 7104, 7105. And it establishes within the Authority a Federal Service Impasses
Panel, to which it grants the power to resolve negotiation
impasses through compulsory arbitration, $ 7119, hence without the strikes that the law forbids to federal employees,

$ 7116(b)(7).

Opinion of the Court
Of particular relevance here, the Statute requires a federal
agency employer to "meet" with the employees' collectivebargaining representative and to "negotiate in good faith for
the purposes of arriving at a collective bargaining agreement." $ 7114(a)(4). The Courts of Appeals disagree about
whether, or the extent to which, this good-faith-bargaining
requirement extends to midterm bargaining. Suppose, for
example, that the federal agency and the union negotiate a
basic 5-year contract. In the third year a matter arises that
the contract does not address. If the union seeks negotiations about the matter, does the Statute require the agency
to bargain then and there, or can the agency wait for basic
contract renewal negotiations? Does it matter whether the
basic contract itself contains a "zipper clause" expressly forbidding such bargaining? Does it matter whether the basic
contract itself contains a clause expressly permitting midterm bargaining? Can the parties insist upon bargaining
endterm (that is, during the negotiations over adopting or
renewing a basic labor contract) about whether to include
one or the other such clauses in the basic contract itself?

In 1985 the Authority began to answer some of these questions. It considered a union's effort to force midterm negotiations about a matter the basic labor contract did not address, and it held that the Statute did not require the agency
to bargain. Internal Revenue Service, 17 F. L. R. A. 731
(1985) (IRS I).

The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit,
however, set aside the Authority's ruling. The court held
that in light of the intent and purpose of the Statute, it must
be read to require midterm bargaining, inasmuch as it did
not create any distinction between bargaining at the end of
a labor contract's term and bargaining during that term.
National Treasury Employees Union v. FLRA, 810 F. 2d
295 (1987) (NTEU). On remand the Authority reversed its
earlier position. Internal Revenue Service, 29 F. L. R. A.

Opinion of the Court
162, 166 (1987) (IRS II). Accepting the D. C. Circuit's analy-sis, the Authority held:

"[T]he duty to bargain in good faith imposed by theStatute requires an agency to bargain during the term
of a collective bargaining agreement on negotiableunion-initiated proposals concerning matters which are
not addressed in the [basic] agreement and were notclearly and unmistakably waived by the union during
negotiation of the agreement." Id., at 167.
The Fourth Circuit has taken a different view of the mat-ter. It has held that "union-initiated midterm bargaining is

not required by the statute and would undermine the con-gressional policies underlying the statute." Social Security
Administration v. FLRA, 956 F. 2d 1280, 1281 (1992) (SSA).Nor, in its view, may the basic labor contract itself impose
a midterm bargaining duty upon the parties. Departmentof Energy v. FLRA, 106 F. 3d 1158, 1163 (1997) (holding unlawful a midterm bargaining clause that the Federal ServiceImpasses Panel had imposed upon the parties' basic labor
contract).In the present suit, the National Federation of Federal
Employees, Local 1309 (Union), representing employees ofthe United States Geological Survey, a subagency of the Department of the Interior (Agency), proposed including in thebasic labor contract a midterm bargaining provision that said:

"The Union may request and the Employer will beobliged to negotiate [midterm] on any negotiable matters
not covered by the provisions of this [basic] agreement."Department of Interior, 52 F. L. R. A. 475, 476 (1996).

The Agency, relying on the Fourth Circuit's view that theStatute prohibits such a provision, refused to accept, or to
bargain about, the proposed clause. The Authority, reiterat-ing its own (and the D. C. Circuit's) contrary view, held that
the Agency's refusal to bargain amounted to an unfair laborpractice. Id., at 479-481. The Statute itself, said the Au526US1 Unit: $U31 [12-08-00 20:11:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN

91Cite as: 526 U. S. 86 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
thority, imposes an obligation to engage in midterm bargain-ing--an obligation that the proposed clause only reiterates.

Id., at 479-480. And even if such an obligation did not existunder the Statute, the Authority added, a proposal to create
a contractual obligation to bargain midterm is a fit subjectfor endterm negotiation.

Id., at 480-481. Consequently,the Authority ordered the Agency to bargain over the proposed clause.The Fourth Circuit set aside the Authority's order. 132
F. 3d 157 (1997). The court reiterated its own view that theStatute itself does not impose any midterm bargaining duty.
Id., at 161-162. That being so, it concluded, the partiesshould not be required to bargain endterm about including a
clause that would require bargaining midterm. The courtreasoned that once bargaining over such a clause began, the
employer would have no choice but to accept the clause.Were the employer not to do so (by bargaining to impasse
over the proposed clause), the Federal Service ImpassesPanel would then inevitably insert the clause over the employer's objection, as the Impasses Panel (like the D. C. Cir-cuit) believes that a midterm bargaining clause would merely
reiterate the duty to bargain midterm that the Statute itselfimposes. Ibid.

We granted certiorari to consider the conflicting views ofthe Circuits.

II
We shall focus primarily upon the basic question that di-vided the Circuits: Does the Statute itself impose a duty to

bargain during the term of an existing labor contract? TheFourth Circuit thought that the Statute did not impose a
duty to bargain midterm and that the matter was sufficientlyclear to warrant judicial rejection of the contrary view of
the agency charged with the Statute's administration. SSA,supra, at 1284 (stating that " `Congress has directly spoken
to the precise question at issue,' " and quoting ChevronU. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,

Opinion of the Court
467 U. S. 837, 842 (1984)). We do not agree with the FourthCircuit, for we find the Statute's language sufficiently ambiguous or open on the point as to require judicial deferenceto reasonable interpretation or elaboration by the agency
charged with its execution. See id., at 842-845; Fort Stewart Schools v. FLRA, 495 U. S. 641, 644-645 (1990).The D. C. Circuit, the Fourth Circuit, and the Authority

all agree that the Statute itself does not expressly addressunion-initiated midterm bargaining. See

NTEU, supra, at
298; SSA, supra, at 1284; Brief for Petitioner FLRA inNo. 97-1243, p. 18. The Statute's relevant language simply

says that federal agency employer and union representative
"shall meet and negotiate in good faith for the purposes of
arriving at a collective bargaining agreement." 5 U. S. C.

$ 7114(a)(4). It defines the key term "collective bargaining
agreement" as an "agreement entered into as a result of collective bargaining." $ 7103(a)(8). And it goes on to define
"collective bargaining" as involving the meeting of employer
and employee representatives "at reasonable times" to "consult" and to "bargain in a good-faith effort to reach agreement with respect to the conditions of employment," incorporating "any collective bargaining agreement reached"
as a result of these negotiations in "a written document."

$ 7103(a)(12). This language, taken literally, may or may not
include a duty to bargain collectively midterm.

The Agency, here represented by the Solicitor General, argues that in context, this language must exclude midterm
bargaining. We shall explain why we do not agree with
each of the Agency's basic arguments.

First, the Agency makes a variety of linguistic arguments.
As an initial matter, it emphasizes the words "arriving at"
in the Statute's general statement that the parties must bargain "for the purposes of arriving at a collective bargaining
agreement." This statement tends to exclude midterm bargaining, the Agency contends, because parties engage in
midterm bargaining, not for the purpose of arriving at, but

526US1 Unit: $U31 [12-08-00 20:11:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN

93Cite as: 526 U. S. 86 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
for the purpose of supplementing, their basic, comprehen-sive labor contract. In other words, the basic collectivebargaining agreement is the only appropriate destination atwhich negotiations might "arriv[e]." The Agency adds that
"collective bargaining agreement" is a term of art, which
only and always refers to basic labor contracts, not to mid-term agreements.

Further, while the Agency acknowledges that there is aduty to bargain midterm in the private sector, see

NLRB v.
Jacobs Manufacturing Co., 196 F. 2d 680 (CA2 1952), it ar-gues that this private-sector duty is based upon language in

the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) that is different
in significant respects from the language in the Statute here.
The Agency explains that the NLRA defines private-sector
collective bargaining to include (1) negotiation "with respect
to wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment, or [(2)] the negotiation of an agreement, or any question arising thereunder." 29 U. S. C. $ 158(d) (emphasis
added). The "or," under this view, indicates that privatesector employers have a comprehensive duty to "bargain collectively" whether or not such bargaining is part of "the
negotiation of an agreement" leading to "written contract."

In our view, these linguistic arguments, while logical,
make too much of too little. One can easily read "arriving
at a collective bargaining agreement" as including an agreement reached at the conclusion of midterm bargaining, particularly because the Statute itself does no more than define
the relevant term "collective bargaining agreement" in a
circular way--as "an agreement entered into as a result of
collective bargaining." 5 U. S. C. $ 7103(a)(8). Nor have we
found any statute, judicial opinion, agency document, or treatise that says whether the words "collective bargaining
agreement" are words of art that must necessarily exclude
midterm agreements. Finally, the linguistic differences between the NLRA and the FSLMRS tell us little, particularly
given the fact that the two labor statutes, like collective bar526US1 Unit: $U31 [12-08-00 20:11:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN
94 FEDERAL EMPLOYEES v. DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR

Opinion of the Court
gaining itself, are not otherwise identical in the two sectors.
For all these reasons, we find in the relevant statutory language ambiguity, not certainty.

Second, the Agency--like the Fourth Circuit--contends
that the Statute's policies demand a reading of the statutory
language that would exclude midterm bargaining from its
definition of "collective bargaining." The availability of
midterm bargaining, the Agency argues, might lead unions
to withhold certain subjects from ordinary endterm negotiations and then to raise them during the term, under more
favorable bargaining conditions. A union might conclude,
for example, that it is more likely to get what it wants by
presenting a proposal during the term (when no other issues
are on the table and a compromise is less likely) and then
negotiating to impasse, thus leaving the matter for the Federal Service Impasses Panel to resolve. The Agency also
points out that public-sector and private-sector bargaining
differ in this respect. Private-sector unions enforce their
views through strikes, and because they hesitate to strike
midterm, they also have no particular incentive to bargain
midterm. But public-sector unions enforce their views
through compulsory arbitration, not strikes. Hence, the argument goes, public-sector unions have a unique incentive to
bargain midterm on a piecemeal basis, thereby threatening
to undermine the basic collective-bargaining process. See,
e. g., SSA, 956 F. 2d, at 1288-1289.

Other policy concerns, however, argue for a different reading of the Statute. Without midterm bargaining, for example, will it prove possible to find a collective solution to a
workplace problem, say, a health or safety hazard, that first
appeared midterm? The Statute's emphasis upon collective
bargaining as "contribut[ing] to the effective conduct of
public business," 5 U. S. C. $ 7101(a)(1)(B), suggests that it
would favor joint, not unilateral, solutions to such midterm
problems.

526US1 Unit: $U31 [12-08-00 20:11:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN

95Cite as: 526 U. S. 86 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
The Authority would seem better suited than a court to
make the workplace-related empirical judgments that would
help properly balance these, and other, policy-related considerations. The Statute does not indicate that Congress itself
decided to make these specific policy judgments. Hence the
Agency's policy arguments illustrate the need for the Authority's elaboration or refinement of the basic statutory
collective-bargaining obligation; they illustrate the appropriateness of judicial deference to considered Authority views
on the matter; and, most importantly, they do not narrow
the scope of a statutory provision the language of which is
consistent with a variety of interpretations.

Third, the Agency argues that the Statute's history and
prior administrative practice support its view that federal
agencies have no duty to bargain midterm. The Statute
grew out of an Executive Order that previously had governed federal-sector labor relations. See Exec. Order
No. 11491, 3 CFR 861 (1966-1970 Comp.), as amended by
Exec. Order Nos. 11616, 11636, and 11838, 3 CFR 605, 634,
957 (1971-1975 Comp.). In support, the Agency cites a case
in which an Assistant Secretary of Labor, applying that Executive Order, dismissed an unfair labor practice complaint
on the ground, among others, that a federal agency need not
bargain over midterm union proposals. Army and Air
Force Exchange Serv., Capital Exchange Region Headquarters, Case No. 22-6657(CA), 2 Rulings on Requests for Review of Assistant Secretary of Labor for Labor-Management
Relations 561-562 (1976) (not reviewed by the Federal Labor
Relations Council, predecessor to the Authority); see IRS I,
17 F. L. R. A., at 736-737, n. 7 (finding, based upon this decision, that there was no obligation to bargain over midterm
union proposals under the Executive Order). A single alternative ground, however--in a single, unreviewed decision
from before the Statute was enacted--does not demonstrate
the kind of historical practice that one might assume would

be reflected in the Statute, particularly when at least onetreatise suggested at the time that federal labor relations

practice was to the contrary. See H. Robinson, Negotiabil-ity in the Federal Sector 10-11, and n. 9 (1981) (stating that
under the Executive Order both unions and agencies had a
continuing duty to bargain through the term of a basiclabor contract).

The Agency also points to a Senate Report in support ofits interpretation of the Statute. That Report speaks of the
parties' "mutual duty to bargain" with respect to (1)"changes in established personnel policies proposed by management," and (2) "negotiable proposals initiated by either
the agency or [the union] . . . in the context of negotiations leading to a basic collective bargaining agreement."
S. Rep. No. 95-969, p. 104 (1978) (emphasis added). This
Report, however, concerns a bill that contains language similar to the language before us but was not enacted into law.
According to the D. C. Circuit, at least, any distinction between basic and midterm bargaining that is indicated by this
passage "did not survive the rejection by Congress of the
Senate's restrictive view of the rights of labor and the importance of collective bargaining." NTEU, 810 F. 2d, at 298.
In any event, the Report's list of possible occasions for collective bargaining does not purport to be an exclusive list; it
does not say that the Statute was understood to exclude midterm bargaining; and any such implication is simply too distant to control our reading of the Statute.

Fourth, the Agency and the Fourth Circuit contend that
the "management rights" provision of the Statute, 5 U. S. C.

$ 7106, does authorize limited midterm bargaining in respect
to certain matters (not here at issue), and that by negative
implication it denies permission to bargain midterm in respect to any others. See, e. g., SSA, supra, at 1284 ("The
inclusion of a specific duty of midterm effects bargaining
. . . suggests the inadvisability of reading a more general

duty into the statute"). Our examination of that provision,

97Cite as: 526 U. S. 86 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
however, finds little support for such a strong negativeimplication.

Subsection (a) of the management rights provision with-draws from collective bargaining certain subjects that it reserves exclusively for decision by management. It specifies,
for example, that federal agency "management official[s]"will retain their authority to hire, fire, promote, and assign

work, and also to determine the agency's "mission, budget,organization, number of employees, and internal security
practices." $ 7106(a).Subsection (b), however, permits a certain amount of
collective bargaining in respect to the very subjects thatsubsection (a) withdrew. Subsection (b) states:

"Nothing in this section shall preclude any agencyand any labor organization from negotiating--
"(1) at the election of the agency, on the numbers,types, and grades of employees or positions assigned to
any organizational subdivision, work project, or tour
of duty, or on the technology, methods, and means ofperforming work;

"(2) procedures which management officials . . . willobserve in exercising any authority under this section;
or"(3) appropriate arrangements for employees adversely affected by the exercise of any authority underthis section by such management officials." $ 7106(b)
(emphasis added).
The two subsections of the management rights provision,
taken together, do not help the Agency. While the provision
contemplates that bargaining over the impact and implementation of management changes may take place during the
term of the basic labor contract, subsection (b) need not be
read to actually impose a duty to bargain midterm. The
italicized clause, "[n]othing in this section shall preclude,"
indicates only that the delegation of certain rights to man526US1 Unit: $U31 [12-08-00 20:11:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN
98 FEDERAL EMPLOYEES v. DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR

Opinion of the Court
agement (e. g., promotions) shall not preclude negotiations
about certain related matters (e. g., promotion procedures).
By its terms, then, subsection (b) does nothing more than
create an exception to subsection (a), preserving the duty to
bargain with respect to certain matters otherwise committed
to the discretion of management. Because $ 7106(b) chiefly
addresses the subject matter of bargaining and not the timing, one could reasonably conclude that while that subsection
contemplates midterm bargaining in the circumstances there
specified, the duty to bargain midterm finds its source elsewhere in the Statute. Hence, the management rights provision seems to hurt, as much as to help, the Agency's basic
argument.

The upshot of this analysis is that where the Agency and
the Fourth Circuit find a clear statutory denial of any midterm bargaining obligation, we find ambiguity created by the
Statute's use of general language that might, or might not,
encompass various forms of midterm bargaining. That kind
of statutory ambiguity is inconsistent both with the Fourth
Circuit's absolute reading of the Statute and also with the
D. C. Circuit's similarly absolute, but opposite, reading.
Compare SSA, 956 F. 2d, at 1284, with NTEU, 810 F. 2d, at
301 (rejecting the Authority's position that there is no duty
to bargain midterm on the ground that it is "contrary to the
intent of the legislature and the guiding purpose of the statute"). Indeed, the D. C. Circuit's analysis implicitly concedes the need to make at least some midterm bargaining
distinctions, when it assumes that the midterm bargaining
obligation does not extend to matters that are covered by
the basic contract. See id., at 296.

The statutory ambiguity is perfectly consistent, however,
with the conclusion that Congress delegated to the Authority
the power to determine--within appropriate legal bounds,
see, e. g., 5 U. S. C. $ 706 (Administrative Procedure Act);
Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council,

Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984)--whether, when, where, and whatsort of midterm bargaining is required. The Statute's delegation of rulemaking, adjudicatory, and policymaking powersto the Authority supports this conclusion. See 5 U. S. C.

duty to bargain in good faith extends to a particular matter);accord,

American Federation of Govt. Employees, AFL-CIO, Council of Soc. Sec. Dist. Office Locals, San Francisco Region v.FLRA, 716 F. 2d 47, 50 (CADC 1983). This conclusion is

also supported by precedent recognizing the similarity of theAuthority's public-sector and the National Labor Relations
Board's private-sector roles. As we have recognized, theAuthority's function is "to develop specialized expertise in
its field of labor relations and to use that expertise to givecontent to the principles and goals set forth in the Act," and
it "is entitled to considerable deference when it exercises its`special function of applying the general provisions of the Act
to the complexities' of federal labor relations." Bureau of

We conclude that Congress "left" the matters of whether,when, and where midterm bargaining is required "to be resolved by the agency charged with the administration of thestatute in light of everyday realities."

Opinion of the Court
gaining. As is true of midterm bargaining itself, and for
similar reasons, the Statute grants the Authority leeway
(within ordinary legal limits) in answering that question as
well.

The Authority says that it has determined, as a matter of
its own judgment, that the parties must bargain over such a
provision. Our reading of its relevant administrative determinations, however, leads us to conclude that its judgment
on the matter was occasioned by the D. C. Circuit's holding
that the Statute must be read to impose on agencies a duty
to bargain midterm. See, e. g., Merit Systems Protection
Bd. Professional Assn., 30 F. L. R. A. 852, 859-860 (1988)
(midterm bargaining clause is negotiable because it "reiterates a right the Union has under the Statute"); 52 F. L. R. A.,
at 479 (in the instant suit, restating that same conclusion).
The Authority did indicate below that even if it agreed with
the Fourth Circuit's position that the Statute does not impose a duty to bargain midterm, the outcome in this litigation
would be no different, as the Authority " `has previously upheld the negotiability of proposals despite the absence of a
statutory right concerning the matter in question.' " Id., at
480 (quoting Department of Energy, 51 F. L. R. A. 124, 127
(1995), enf. denied, Department of Energy v. FLRA, 106
F. 3d 1158 (CA4 1997)). This explanation, however, seems
more an effort to respond to, and to distinguish, a contrary
judicial authority, rather than an independently reasoned
effort to develop complex labor policies. Regardless, the
Authority's conclusion would seem linked to the D. C. Circuit's basic understanding about the statutory requirements.

In light of our determination that the Statute does not
resolve the question of midterm bargaining, nor the related
question of bargaining about midterm bargaining, we believe
the Authority should have the opportunity to consider these
questions aware that the Statute permits, but does not compel, the conclusions it reached.

Justice O'Connor, with whom The Chief Justice joins,and with whom

Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas joinas to Part I, dissenting.

The Court today ignores the plain meaning of the Fed-eral Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (Federal
Labor Statute or Statute) and erroneously concludes thatwhen an agency responds to a judicial decision by abandoning its own interpretation of a statute and adopting that ofthe judicial forum this Court should defer to the agency's
revised position, rather than evaluate whether the revisedinterpretation renders, in fact, the most plausible reading of
the statute. I respectfully dissent.

I
The Federal Labor Statute plainly does not impose a gen-eral duty on agencies to bargain midterm. See

Social Secu-rity Administration v. FLRA, 956 F. 2d 1280, 1281 (CA4

1992). Whether the language of a statute is plain or am-biguous is determined "by reference to the language itself, the specific context in which that language is used, andthe broader context of the statute as a whole."

Robinson v.Shell Oil Co., 519 U. S. 337, 341 (1997).

Here, the language of the Federal Labor Statute, as wellas the specific and broader contexts in which that language
is used, demonstrates that the Statute is unambiguous. TheFederal Labor Statute specifies a few instances where midterm bargaining is required, see 5 U. S. C. $ 7106(b), but itcontains no provision that expressly or implicitly imposes a
general duty on agencies to bargain during the term of acollective bargaining agreement. Rather, Congress defined

102 FEDERAL EMPLOYEES v. DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR

O'Connor, J., dissenting
the general duty to bargain to include only a duty to "meetand negotiate in good faith for the purposes of

arriving
at a collective bargaining agreement," $ 7114(a)(4) (emphasisadded), and obligated agencies to negotiate "with a sincere resolve to reach a collective bargaining agreement,"

$ 7114(b)(1) (emphasis added); see also $ 7114(b)(5) (requiringparties "to take such steps as are necessary to implement

such agreement"). The term "arrive" is commonly under-stood to mean "to reach a destination" or "to gain or achieve
an end." See Webster's Third New International Diction-ary 121 (1976). Thus, by its terms, the Federal Labor Statute requires an agency to "meet and negotiate in good faith"
with unions only "for the purposes of " achieving an end: a
comprehensive collective bargaining agreement. See also

$ 7103(a)(8) (defining "collective bargaining agreement" as
"an agreement" reached through collective bargaining);

$ 7103(a)(12) (defining "collective bargaining," in part, as "to
reach [an] agreement with respect to the conditions of
employment").

The Court suggests that, because a midterm bargaining
agreement is an end agreement of negotiation, the duty to
bargain may encompass midterm agreements as well. See
ante, at 93. As the word "midterm" suggests, however, such
agreements are only a "midpoint" in the term of the underlying collective bargaining agreement. Because such agreements do not stand alone but relate back to the primary collective bargaining agreement, a midterm agreement is most
appropriately regarded as a modification of, or a supplement
to, the primary agreement reached pursuant to the Federal
Labor Statute. See, e. g., 29 U. S. C. $ 158(d) (describing
midterm bargaining agreements in private sector as "modification[s]" to the primary agreement). The Federal Labor
Statute expresses no general duty on the part of agencies
to negotiate modifications or supplements to an existing collective bargaining agreement. With respect to modifications and supplements, the Statute requires only that agen526US1 Unit: $U31 [12-08-00 20:11:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN

103Cite as: 526 U. S. 86 (1999)
O'Connor, J., dissenting
cies bargain over a few specified topics. See 5 U. S. C.$ 7106(b).

Section 7106(b) obligates an agency to bargain midtermover specified agency initiatives, such as the creation of "procedures which management officials of the agency will observe in exercising any authority" under the Federal LaborStatute. $ 7106(b)(2); see also $ 7106(b)(3) (providing for

bargaining over "appropriate arrangements for employeesadversely affected by the exercise of any authority under
this section by such management officials"); American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 2782 v.
FLRA, 702 F. 2d 1183, 1186-1187 (CADC 1983). Because
the Statute specifies a few, limited topics that are subject to
midterm bargaining, it cannot be construed to require midterm bargaining generally. Such a construction, indeed,
renders the specific and general obligations redundant. See,
e. g., United States v. Nordic Village, Inc., 503 U. S. 30, 36
(1992).

The Court reasons that $ 7106(b) does not define a limited
duty to bargain midterm because it merely defines exceptions to $ 7106(a), which, in turn, defines managerial rights
that are themselves exceptions to the duties outlined in the
Statute. Moreover, because the section's introductory language "indicates only that the delegation of certain rights to
management . . . shall not preclude negotiations about certain related matters," see ante, at 97-98, the Court suggests
that $ 7106(b) defines a permissive exception to an exception
rather than an obligation. It thus follows from the structure and text of $ 7106(b) that "the duty to bargain midterm
finds its source elsewhere in the Statute." Ante, at 98.

The Court's reliance on $ 7106(b)'s introductory language
is misplaced because the subparts of $ 7106(b) indicate that
this section defines an obligation, not a permissive exception.
Specifically, although $ 7106(b)(1) provides that an agency at
its election can initiate bargaining on working conditions,

$$ 7106(b)(2) and (b)(3) are mandatory, requiring that agen526US1 Unit: $U31 [12-08-00 20:11:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN
104 FEDERAL EMPLOYEES v. DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR

O'Connor, J., dissenting
cies bargain midterm over the matters specified. At thevery least, $$ 7106(b)(2) and (b)(3) demonstrate that Congress intended to impose only a limited duty on agencies tobargain midterm. Even assuming $ 7106(b) is permissive,
there is no basis for the Court's conclusion that this section
demonstrates that a generalized duty to bargain midtermemanates from another statutory source; indeed, there is no

other provision of the Statute from which such a duty couldemanate. See

ante, at 98. Accordingly, it is plain from its
language and structure that a general duty to engage in mid-term bargaining is not prescribed by the Federal Labor

Statute.

That the Federal Labor Statute contemplates a single end
agreement, and not supplementary agreements or modifications, is also demonstrated by a comparison of it to the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), the Statute's privatesector counterpart. The duty to bargain, as defined in the
NLRA, includes "the negotiation of an agreement, or any
question arising thereunder." 29 U. S. C. $ 158(d) (emphasis
added). This broad definition of the duty, which clearly contemplates negotiation of midterm agreements, stands in
stark contrast to the duty defined in the Federal Labor Statute, to "arriv[e] at a collective bargaining agreement." 5
U. S. C. $ 7114(a)(4). The NLRA also contains a proviso limiting this broad duty to negotiate when there is "in effect a
collective-bargaining contract covering employees in an industry" and a party desires to "modify" that contract. 29
U. S. C. $ 158(d). For example, there is no duty to engage in
midterm bargaining over matters already "contained in" the
existing collective bargaining agreement. Ibid. As noted
above, the Federal Labor Statute lacks any comparable language. Because, at the time it drafted the Statute, Congress knew that the NLRA defined a duty to bargain midterm, see NLRB v. Jacobs Mfg. Co., 196 F. 2d 680, 684 (CA2
1952), this omission indicates that Congress did not intend to
include a similar duty in the Federal Labor Statute.

O'Connor, J., dissenting
The Court concludes, nevertheless, that this omission isirrelevant because the Federal Labor Statute and the

NLRA, as well as collective bargaining in the public and pri-vate sectors, are different. See

ante, at 93; see also Fort
Stewart Schools v. FLRA, 495 U. S. 641, 648 (1990) (observing that the Federal Labor Statute and the NLRA shouldnot be read

in pari materia). To be sure, there are differences between the Acts, but that fact does not render a com-parison of them irrelevant. It is well established that "the

interpretation of a doubtful statute may be influenced by lan-guage of other statutes which are not specifically related,
but which apply to similar persons, things, or relationships."
2B N. Singer, Sutherland on Statutory Construction $ 53.03,
p. 233 (rev. 5th ed. 1992). Employing this principle, the
Court has previously compared nonanalogous statutes to aid
its interpretation of them. See Overstreet v. North Shore
Corp., 318 U. S. 125, 131-132 (1943) (using Federal Employers' Liability Act to aid interpretation of Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 even though the two Acts were not strictly
analogous). In light of these principles of construction, the
NLRA may be used to aid our interpretation of the Federal
Labor Statute. See also Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms v. FLRA, 464 U. S. 89, 92-93, 96-97 (1983) (analogizing the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) to the
National Labor Relations Board).

A comparison of the two statutes explains why a duty to
bargain midterm was included in the NLRA but omitted
from the Federal Labor Statute. Under the Statute, but not
the NLRA, the Government must subsidize union negotiators. See 5 U. S. C. $ 7131(a). Consequently, there is little
incentive for union negotiators to streamline their bargaining positions or to avoid extended midterm bargaining.
Given this incentive structure, it is difficult to imagine that
Congress would obligate Government agencies to bargain
midterm, for such an obligation would likely cause perpetual
collective bargaining. Continuous bargaining, however, is

526US1 Unit: $U31 [12-08-00 20:11:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN
106 FEDERAL EMPLOYEES v. DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR

O'Connor, J., dissenting
contrary to the goal of the FLRA: to promote "effective andefficient" Government, not Government stymied by perpetual bargaining. $ 7101(b). Indeed, it was this realizationthat initially motivated the FLRA to reject the contention
that the Federal Labor Statute contained a duty to bargain
midterm. See Internal Revenue Service, 17 F. L. R. A. 731,736-737 (1985) (observing that midterm bargaining would

cause continuous bargaining on an issue-by-issue basis).A duty to bargain midterm was also excluded from the
Statute because, in the context of the no-strike regime offederal labor relations, it would leave the agency-employer
at an unfair disadvantage. In the NLRA context, the union
that wants to obtain a midterm modification or supplement
from an employer who is dead set against it must pay the
price of a strike that is costly to it and its members. In the
context of the Federal Labor Statute, the union that wants
to obtain a midterm modification or supplement need only
bargain to an impasse and then hope that the Federal Service Impasses Panel will give it all (or at least some) of what
it has requested. Demanding unreciprocated additional
benefits is cost free. Thus, a midterm bargaining requirement might motivate a union to "hold [a] matter off until the
term agreement is done[,]. . . initiate the proposal as part of
a single-issue negotiation," and, if an impasse results, force
the agency to arbitrate. Ferris, Union-Initiated Mid-Term
Bargaining: A Catalyst in Reshaping Conflict Patterns, 5 Negotiation J. 407, 411-412 (Oct. 1989). Again, it is obvious
that this incentive structure does not promote "effective and
efficient" Government. $ 7101(b). Given the language and
structure of the Federal Labor Statute, the context in which
this language is used and the differences between the Statute and the NLRA, I would hold that the Federal Labor
Statute plainly, and justifiably, does not impose a general
duty to bargain midterm.

The FLRA argues, in the alternative, that even if the Federal Labor Statute does not impose a general obligation to

107Cite as: 526 U. S. 86 (1999)
O'Connor, J., dissenting
bargain midterm, agencies nevertheless must bargain over
union-initiated proposals to include in term agreements midterm bargaining provisions. In other words, unions may
propose that agency-employers agree to obligate themselves
contractually to bargain midterm. In the private sector, the
duty to bargain means only that the employer and the exclusive representative bargain over something in good faith.
In the public sector, however, the duty to bargain over a
proposal can have very different consequences: Unions may
force an agency into binding arbitration by bargaining to impasse. $ 7119(c)(5)(B)(iii). Therefore, by imposing a duty to
bargain over midterm bargaining clauses, the FLRA is, at
the very least, taking the choice of whether to bargain midterm out of a reluctant federal employer's hands, and placing
it into the hands of the Federal Service Impasses Panel, a
result that seems inconsistent with the Federal Labor Statute's goals of promoting "effective and efficient Government." $ 7101(b).

There is, moreover, no statutory source for a duty to bargain over contractual requirements to bargain midterm.
Section 7117(a)(1) directs an agency to bargain over "matters
which are the subject of any rule or regulation only if the
rule or regulation is not a Government-wide rule or regulation" but only "to the extent not inconsistent with any Federal law." The FLRA has interpreted this section to impose
a duty on agencies to bargain over only proposals relating to
conditions of employment. See Brief for Petitioner FLRA
in No. 97-1243, p. 37. It is not apparent, however, how bargaining over a contractual requirement to bargain midterm
is a "matte[r] . . . affecting working conditions." See 5
U. S. C. $ 7103(a)(14) (defining "conditions of employment").
More important, because Congress, through the Federal
Labor Statute, chose not to require agencies to bargain midterm, it is "inconsistent with . . . Federal law" for the FLRA
to require bargaining over a contractual requirement to bar526US1 Unit: $U31 [12-08-00 20:11:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN

gain midterm. As I read the Statute, Congress has clearlyrejected such a requirement.

II
Even if I agreed with the Court that the Federal LaborStatute is ambiguous with respect to the duty to bargain

midterm, I would not defer in this suit to the FLRA's inter-pretation of the Statute pursuant to

Chevron U. S. A. Inc.v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837,

842-843 (1984).We observed in Good Samaritan Hospital v. Shalala, 508
U. S. 402 (1993), that when an agency alters its interpretationof a statute, its revised interpretation may be entitled to less
deference than a position consistently held. We explained:

"The Secretary is not estopped from changing a viewshe believes to have been grounded upon a mistaken

legal interpretation. Indeed, an administrative agencyis not disqualified from changing its mind; and when it
does, the courts still sit in review of the administrativedecision and should not approach the statutory construction issue de novo and without regard to the administra-tive understanding of the statutes. On the other hand,
the consistency of an agency's position is a factor in as-sessing the weight that position is due. As we have
stated: `An agency interpretation of a relevant provisionwhich conflicts with the agency's earlier interpretation
is "entitled to considerably less deference" than a con-sistently held agency view.'

INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca,480 U. S. 421, 446, n. 30 (1987). How much weight

should be given to the agency's views in such a situation,and in particular where its shifts might have resulted
from intervening and possibly erroneous judicial deci-sions and its current position from one of our own rulings, will depend on the facts of individual cases." Id.,at 417 (some citations and internal quotation marks
omitted).

ground that interpretation was not consistent with congres-sional intent, and agency's interpretation was not entitled to

Here, the FLRA changed its position on the precise matter
that we have been asked to consider--whether agencies have
a duty to bargain midterm under the Federal Labor Statute--and did so in response to a judicial decision. Initially,
the FLRA determined that the Statute did not impose a
duty to bargain midterm, see Internal Revenue Service, 17
F. L. R. A. 731 (1985), but it came to the opposite conclusion
after the D. C. Circuit rejected this reading of the Statute,
see National Treasury Employees Union v. FLRA, 810
F. 2d 295 (1987) (holding the Statute required midterm bargaining); Internal Revenue Service, 29 F. L. R. A. 162, 166
(1987) (adopting D. C. Circuit's reading of the Statute). At
the time it reversed course, the FLRA offered only a scant
explanation for its sudden interpretive shift. It merely
stated that it agreed with the D. C. Circuit's holdings and
concluded, "based on the court's decision and in agreement
with the Administrative Law Judge," that the IRS had impermissibly refused to bargain over a midterm proposal.
Id., at 165-166, 168. The only apparent reason for the
agency's shift in interpretation was the D. C. Circuit's decision. In this circumstance, the agency's interpretation of

the Statute is entitled to less deference. See Good Samari-tan Hospital v. Shalala, supra, at 417. This lesser standard

of deference seems particularly appropriate here because wehave recognized some limits on the FLRA's interpretive
powers. See Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms v.
FLRA, 464 U. S., at 108. Accordingly, we should endeavorto find the most plausible construction of the Federal Labor

Statute and examine the Secretary's current interpretationin light of this construction.

The FLRA currently interprets the Federal Labor Statuteto impose a duty on federal agencies to negotiate midterm
those union-initiated proposals that are not covered in theterm agreement unless the union has clearly waived its right
to bargain midterm. See Brief for Petitioner FLRA inNo. 97-1243, at 18-20; see

Department of Navy, MarineCorps Logistics Base v. FLRA, 962 F. 2d 48, 56 (CADC 1992)

(outlining FLRA position). This is not, however, the mostplausible construction of the Statute. For the reasons previously discussed, there is no language in the Statute ex-pressing a general duty to bargain midterm. Moreover, to
the extent that the FLRA has codified exceptions to a gener-alized duty to bargain midterm, those exceptions are defined
out of whole cloth; there is nothing in the text of the FederalLabor Statute that suggests limits on a duty to bargain midterm. For these reasons, even if there were some ambiguityin the Federal Labor Statute, I would hold that the agency's
interpretation of the Federal Labor Statute is inferior to thenatural, and most plausible, reading of that Statute--that
there is no general duty to bargain midterm. See GoodSamaritan Hospital v. Shalala, supra, at 417; INS v.
Cardoza-Fonseca, supra, at 446-447, and n. 30. I respect-fully dissent and would affirm the decision of the Fourth
Circuit.

FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY et al.

v. UNITED STATES et al.

on application for temporary restraining order orpreliminary injunction and on motion for leave to

file a bill of complaint
No. 127, Orig. (A-736). Decided March 3, 1999
Plaintiffs moved for leave to file a bill of complaint and for a preliminary

injunction against the United States and the Governor of Arizona, both
raised under this Court's original jurisdiction, seeking, inter alia, enforcement of an ex parte order by the International Court of Justice,
which directed the United States to prevent Arizona's execution of a
German citizen. The action was filed within two hours of an execution
ordered in January, based upon a sentence imposed in 1984, about which
Germany learned in 1992.

Held: Given the tardiness of the pleas and the threshold barriers they

implicate, this Court declines to exercise its original jurisdiction. It
appears that the United States has not waived its sovereign immunity,
and it is doubtful that Art. III, $ 2, cl. 2, provides an anchor for an action
to prevent execution of a German citizen who is not an ambassador or
consul. Also, a foreign government's ability here to assert a claim
against a State is without evident support in the Vienna Convention
and in probable contravention of Eleventh Amendment principles. See
Breard v. Greene, 523 U. S. 371, 377.

barriers. First, it appears that the United States has notwaived its sovereign immunity. Second, it is doubtful that

Art. III, $ 2, cl. 2, provides an anchor for an action to preventexecution of a German citizen who is not an ambassador or

Breard v. Greene, 523 U. S. 371, 377 (1998) (per

States in the International Court of Justice (ICJ)--a case in
which Germany claims that Arizona's execution of LaGrand
violates the Vienna Convention. Germany also seeks a stay
of that execution "pending the Court's disposition of the motion for leave to file an original bill of complaint after a normal course of briefing and deliberation on that motion."
Motion for Leave to File a Bill of Complaint and for a Temporary Restraining Order or Preliminary Injunction 2 (Motion). The ICJ has issued an order "indicat[ing]" that the
"United States should take all measures at its disposal to
ensure that Walter LaGrand is not executed pending the
final decision in these [ICJ] proceedings." || 9, id., at 6-7.

The Solicitor General has filed a letter in which he opposes
any stay. In his view, the "Vienna Convention does not furnish a basis for this Court to grant a stay of execution,"
and "an order of the International Court of Justice indicating
provisional measures is not binding and does not furnish a
basis for judicial relief." The Solicitor General adds, however, that he has "not had time to read the materials thoroughly or to digest the contents." Letter from Solicitor
General Waxman filed Mar. 3, 1999, with Clerk of this Court.

Germany's filings come at what is literally the eleventh
hour. Nonetheless, Germany explains that it did not file its
case in the ICJ until it learned that the State of Arizona had
admitted that it was aware, when LaGrand was arrested,
that he was a German national. That admission came only
eight days ago, and the ICJ issued its preliminary ruling
only today. Regardless, in light of the fact that both the
ICJ and a sovereign nation have asked that we stay this
case, or "indicate[d]" that we should do so, Motion 6, I would
grant the preliminary stay that Germany requests. That
stay would give us time to consider, after briefing from all
interested parties, the jurisdictional and international legal
issues involved, including further views of the Solicitor General, after time for study and appropriate consultation.

The Court has made Germany's motion for a preliminarystay moot by denying its motion to file its complaint and

"declin[ing] to exercise" its original jurisdiction in light ofthe "tardiness of the pleas and the jurisdictional barriers
they implicate." Ante, at 112. It is at least arguable thatGermany's reasons for filing so late are valid, and the jurisdictional matters are arguable. Indeed, the Court says thatit is merely "

doubtful that Art. III, $ 2, cl. 2, provides ananchor" for the suit and that a foreign government's ability

to assert a claim against a State is "without evident supportin the Vienna Convention and in probable contravention of
Eleventh Amendment principles." Ante, at 112 (emphasisadded). The words "doubtful" and "probable," in my view,
suggest a need for fuller briefing.For these reasons I would grant a preliminary stay.

STEWART, DIRECTOR, ARIZONA DEPARTMENT OFCORRECTIONS,

et al. v. LaGRAND

on application to lift restraining order and petitionfor writ of certiorari to the united states court of

appeals for the ninth circuit
No. A-735 (98-1412). Decided March 3, 1999
After Walter LaGrand's conviction and sentence were affirmed by the Arizona Supreme Court and his first federal habeas petition was denied, he
filed this petition, challenging, inter alia, lethal gas as a cruel and unusual form of execution. The District Court denied the petition and a
certificate of appealability. The Ninth Circuit granted the certificate
and denied the stay of execution, but enjoined the State from executing
LaGrand by lethal gas.

Held: The Ninth Circuit's judgment is reversed and its injunctive order

vacated. LaGrand waived his claim that execution by lethal gas is unconstitutional by choosing lethal gas over lethal injection, an alternative
method of execution available in Arizona. To hold otherwise, and to
hold that Eighth Amendment protections cannot be waived in the capital context, would create and apply a new procedural rule in violation
of Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288. In addition, LaGrand's claims are
procedurally defaulted, and he has failed to show cause for his failure to
overcome this bar. At the time of his direct appeal, there was sufficient
debate about the constitutionality of lethal gas executions that he cannot show cause for his failure to raise this claim. He also specifically
waived an alternative claim that his trial counsel was ineffective by
representing to the District Court prior to filing his first federal habeas
petition that there was no basis for such a claim. That claim is also
procedurally defaulted. The Arizona court held that his ineffectiveassistance arguments were barred pursuant to a state procedural rule,
and he has not demonstrated cause or prejudice for his failure to raise
the claims on direct review.

Certiorari granted; judgment reversed and injunction vacated.

Per Curiam.
Walter LaGrand and Karl LaGrand were each convicted offirst-degree murder, attempted murder in the first degree,

attempted armed robbery, and two counts of kidnaping.The Arizona Supreme Court gave a detailed account of the

crime in Walter LaGrand's appeal. See State v. LaGrand,
153 Ariz. 21, 23-24, 734 P. 2d 563, 565-566 (1987). Following
a jury trial, both Karl LaGrand and Walter LaGrand were
convicted on all charges and sentenced to death. The Arizona Supreme Court affirmed the convictions and sentences.
State v. LaGrand, 152 Ariz. 483, 733 P. 2d 1066 (1987) (Karl
LaGrand); State v. LaGrand, supra (Walter LaGrand). Subsequently, we denied the LaGrands' petitions for certiorari.
See 484 U. S. 872 (1987).

The LaGrands then filed petitions for writs of habeas
corpus pursuant to 28 U. S. C. $ 2254. Until then, Walter
LaGrand had been represented by Bruce Burke, a Tucson
lawyer. Before appointing Burke as counsel in the habeas
proceeding, however, the District Court required Burke to
discuss all possible claims of ineffective assistance of counsel
with Walter LaGrand and to file a status report with the
court. See 133 F. 3d 1253, 1269 (CA9 1998). Walter LaGrand informed Burke that he did not desire a new attorney and requested that Burke continue to represent him.
Ibid. Nevertheless, after Burke learned that Karl LaGrand
was pursuing ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims, Burke
moved to withdraw as counsel. The District Court denied
this motion on the ground that "Walter LaGrand entered a
waiver of any potential claims of ineffective assistance of
counsel and Mr. Burke indicated to the Court that he believes no such grounds existed." LaGrand v. Lewis, 883
F. Supp. 451, 456, n. 3 (1995). The Ninth Circuit affirmed,
holding that "[w]hen Walter waived the offer of new counsel,
he was waiving the benefits of new representation, among
which would potentially have been the presentation of this
sort of [ineffective-assistance claim]." 133 F. 3d, at 1269.

Among the claims raised in Walter LaGrand's petition for
a writ of habeas corpus was the claim that execution by lethal gas constituted cruel and unusual punishment under the
Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The

526US1 Unit: $U33 [01-08-01 16:18:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Per Curiam
District Court found the claim to be procedurally defaulted
because Walter LaGrand had failed to raise it either on direct
appeal or in his petition for state postconviction relief, when
the sole method of execution was by way of lethal gas. On
appeal, the Ninth Circuit did not reach the issue of procedural default because it found the claim was not ripe until
and unless LaGrand chose gas as his method of execution.
Id., at 1264. The petition for writ of habeas corpus was denied. Id., at 1269.

In February 1999, Karl LaGrand filed a successive state
petition for postconviction relief raising the claim that execution by lethal gas constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The trial court found the claim moot and precluded
due to Karl LaGrand's failure to raise the claim in prior state
court proceedings, and the Arizona Supreme Court denied
review. Karl LaGrand again raised the claim in a second
federal habeas corpus petition. The District Court again
found the claim procedurally defaulted and concluded that
Karl LaGrand had failed to establish cause and prejudice or
a fundamental miscarriage of justice to excuse the default.
The District Court denied that petition, but the Court of
Appeals reversed.

The Ninth Circuit held that Karl LaGrand's lethal gas
claim was procedurally barred but found cause and prejudice to excuse the default. The court concluded that Karl
LaGrand's failure to raise the lethal gas claim was excused
because there was no legal or factual basis for the claim
when he pursued his direct appeal in state court. Prejudice was shown because he was now faced with execution by
a method the Ninth Circuit had previously found to be
unconstitutional.

The Ninth Circuit also addressed the State's argument
that Karl LaGrand's choice of execution method constituted
a waiver of his current claim. According to the Ninth Circuit, its precedent dictated that "Eighth Amendment protec526US1 Unit: $U33 [01-08-01 16:18:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tions may not be waived, at least in the area of capital pun-ishment." See

LaGrand v. Stewart, 173 F. 3d 1144, 1148
(1999). As part of its ultimate order, the Court of Appealsstayed Karl LaGrand's execution and enjoined Arizona "from

executing Karl Hinze LaGrand, or anyone similarly situated,
by means of lethal gas." Id., at 1149. The State filed anapplication to vacate the stay, which we granted. Subsequently, Karl LaGrand's lawyers moved to clarify our orderto determine whether the Ninth Circuit's injunction was still
in place. We denied this motion. 525 U. S. 1174 (1999). Atthe last moment, Karl LaGrand requested the use of lethal
injection, which the State allowed, and the validity of the
Ninth Circuit's injunction was not tested.

This case followed. Like Karl LaGrand, Walter LaGrand
filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus challenging lethal
gas as a cruel and unusual form of execution. The District
Court declined to follow the Ninth Circuit's previous opinion
in LaGrand v. Stewart, No. 99-99004 (Feb. 23, 1999), concluding that our lifting of the stay of execution necessarily
vacated the merits of the Ninth Circuit's decision. The District Court also denied a certificate of appealability, concluding that "the issue of procedural default of Petitioner's lethal
gas challenge is not debatable among jurists of reason."
Pet. for Cert. 5.

The Ninth Circuit panel granted a certificate of appealability and proceeded to the merits of the case. It concluded
that our order lifting the stay of execution in LaGrand v.
Stewart, No. 99-99004 (Feb. 23, 1999), did not pass upon the
merits of the panel's opinion and concluded that its reasoning
remained sound. It then denied the stay of execution but
restrained and enjoined the State of Arizona from executing
Walter LaGrand by means of lethal gas.

The State has filed a petition for writ of certiorari and an
application to lift the Court of Appeals' injunction. We now
grant the petition for certiorari, summarily reverse the judgment, and vacate the Court of Appeals' injunctive order.

I
Walter LaGrand, by his actions, has waived his claim thatexecution by lethal gas is unconstitutional. At the time

Walter LaGrand was sentenced to death, lethal gas was theonly method of execution available in Arizona, but the State
now provides inmates a choice of execution by lethal gas orlethal injection, see Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 13-704(B) (Supp.
1998) (creating a default rule of execution by lethal injec-tion). Walter LaGrand was afforded this choice and decided
to be executed by lethal gas. On March 1, 1999, GovernorHull of Arizona offered Walter LaGrand an opportunity to
rescind this decision and select lethal injection as his methodof execution. Walter LaGrand, again, insisted that he desired to be executed by lethal gas. By declaring his methodof execution, picking lethal gas over the State's default form
of execution--lethal injection--Walter LaGrand has waivedany objection he might have to it. See,

e. g., Johnson v.Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458, 464 (1938). To hold otherwise, and to

hold that Eighth Amendment protections cannot be waivedin the capital context, would create and apply a new procedural rule in violation of Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989).

II
In addition, Walter LaGrand's claims are procedurally de-faulted, and he has failed to show cause to overcome this bar.

See Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 750 (1991). At thetime of Walter LaGrand's direct appeal, there was sufficient
debate about the constitutionality of lethal gas executionsthat Walter LaGrand cannot show cause for his failure to
raise this claim. Arguments concerning the constitutional-ity of lethal gas have existed since its introduction as a
method of execution in Nevada in 1921. See H. Bedau, TheDeath Penalty in America 16 (3d ed. 1982). In the period
immediately prior to Walter LaGrand's direct appeal, a num-ber of States were reconsidering the use of execution by lethal gas, see Gray v. Lucas, 710 F. 2d 1048, 1059-1061 (CA5

Lucas, 463 U. S. 1237, 1240-1244(1983) (Marshall, J., joined by Brennan, J., dissenting from
denial of certiorari). In addition, lethal gas executions havebeen documented since 1937, when San Quentin introduced
it as an execution method, and studies of the effect of execu-tion by lethal gas date back to the 1950's. See Bedau,

supra,at 16.

III
Walter LaGrand's alternative argument, that hisineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim suffices as cause, also

fails. Walter LaGrand specifically waived the claim that histrial counsel was ineffective, representing to the District
Court prior to filing his first federal habeas petition thatthere was no basis for such claims. See LaGrand v. Lewis,
883 F. Supp., at 456, n. 3; 133 F. 3d, at 1269. In addition, theineffective-assistance claim is, itself, procedurally defaulted.
The Arizona court held that Walter LaGrand's ineffective-assistance arguments were barred pursuant to a state procedural rule, see State v. LaGrand, No. CR-07426, MinuteEntry (Pima County Super. Ct., Mar. 2, 1999), and Walter
LaGrand has failed to demonstrate cause or prejudice for hisfailure to raise these claims on direct review.

Accordingly, the judgment of the United States Court ofAppeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and its injunctive
order is vacated.

It is so ordered.

we limit our sanction accordingly. The order therefore willnot prevent Schwarz from petitioning to challenge criminal
sanctions which might be imposed on her. Similarly, be-cause Schwarz has not abused this Court's extraordinary

CENTRAL STATE UNIVERSITY v. AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS, CENTRAL

STATE UNIVERSITY CHAPTER

on petition for writ of certiorari to thesupreme court of ohio

No. 98-1071. Decided March 22, 1999
Pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. $ 3345.45, petitioner university adopted

standards for its professors' instructional workloads and notified respondent, the certified collective-bargaining agent for the professors,
that it would not bargain over the workload issue. Respondent then
filed a complaint in state court for declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that $ 3345.45 created a class of public employees not entitled to
bargain regarding their workload in violation of the Equal Protection
Clauses of the Ohio and United States Constitutions. The Ohio Supreme Court held that the collective-bargaining exemption bore no rational relationship to the State's interest in correcting the imbalance
between research and teaching at its public universities, and concluded
that the State had not shown any rational basis for singling out university professors as the only public employees precluded from bargaining
over their workload.

Held: The Ohio Supreme Court's holding cannot be reconciled with the

requirements of the Equal Protection Clause. This Court has repeatedly held that where a classification involves neither fundamental rights
nor suspect proceedings it cannot run afoul of the Clause if there is a
rational relationship between disparity of treatment and some legitimate governmental purpose. E. g., Heller v. Doe, 509 U. S. 312, 319-
321. The legislative classification here passes that test. Imposing a
workload policy not subject to collective bargaining was an entirely rational step to accomplish the statute's objective of increasing the time
faculty spent in the classroom. The fact that the record before the Ohio
courts did not show that collective bargaining had lead to the decline in
faculty classroom time does not detract from the legislative decision's
rationality.

Certiorari granted; 83 Ohio St. 3d 229, 699 N. E. 2d 463, reversed and

Petitioner Central State University challenges a ruling ofthe Ohio Supreme Court striking down on equal protection

grounds a state law requiring public universities to developstandards for professors' instructional workloads and exempting those standards from collective bargaining. Wegrant the petition and reverse the judgment of the Ohio
Supreme Court.In an effort to address the decline in the amount of time
that public university professors devoted to teaching as op-posed to researching, the State of Ohio enacted Ohio Rev.
Code Ann. $ 3345.45 (1997). This provision provides in rele-vant part:

"On or before January 1, 1994, the Ohio board of re-gents jointly with all state universities . . . shall develop
standards for instructional workloads for full-time andpart-time faculty in keeping with the universities' missions and with special emphasis on the undergraduatelearning experience. . . .

"On or before June 30, 1994, the board of trustees ofeach state university shall take formal action to adopt
a faculty workload policy consistent with the standardsdeveloped under this section. Notwithstanding [other
provisions making faculty workload at public universi-ties a proper subject for collective bargaining], the policies adopted under this section are not appropriate sub-jects for collective bargaining. Notwithstanding [these
collective-bargaining provisions], any policy adoptedunder this section by a board of trustees prevails over
any conflicting provisions of any collective bargainingagreement between an employees organization and that
board of trustees."*

Per Curiam

In 1994, petitioner Central State University adopted a work-load policy pursuant to $ 3345.45 and notified respondent, the

certified collective-bargaining agent for Central State's pro-fessors, that it would not bargain over the issue of faculty
workload. Respondent subsequently filed a complaint in
Ohio state court for declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that $ 3345.45 created a class of public employees not
entitled to bargain regarding their workload and that this
classification violated the Equal Protection Clauses of the
Ohio and United States Constitutions.

By a divided vote, the Ohio Supreme Court agreed with
respondent that $ 3345.45 deprived public university professors the equal protection of the laws. See 83 Ohio St. 3d
229, 699 N. E. 2d 463 (1998). The court acknowledged that
Ohio's purpose in enacting the statute was legitimate and
that all legislative enactments enjoy a strong presumption
of constitutionality. Id., at 234-235, 699 N. E. 2d, at 468-

State's interest in correcting the imbalance between research and teaching at its public universities. See id., at
236-239, 699 N. E. 2d, at 469-470. The State had argued
that achieving uniformity, consistency, and equity in faculty
workload was necessary to recapture the decline in teaching,
and that collective bargaining produced variation in workloads across universities in departments having the same academic mission. Id., at 236, 699 N. E. 2d, at 469. Reviewing evidence that the State had submitted in support of this

contention, the Ohio Supreme Court held that "there is not
a shred of evidence in the entire record which links collective
bargaining with the decline in teaching over the last decade,
or in any way purports to establish that collective bargaining
contributed in the slightest to the lost faculty time devoted
to undergraduate teaching." Ibid. Based on this determination, the court concluded that the State had failed to
show "any rational basis for singling out university faculty
members as the only public employees . . . precluded from
bargaining over their workload." Id., at 237, 699 N. E. 2d,
at 470.

The dissenting justices pointed out that the majority's
methodology and conclusion conflicted with this Court's
standards for rational-basis review of equal protection challenges. See id., at 238-241, 699 N. E. 2d, at 471-472. In
their view, "that collective bargaining has not caused the
decline in teaching proves nothing in assessing whether the
faculty workload standards imposed pursuant to R. C.
3345.45 legitimately relate to that statute's purpose of
restoring losses in undergraduate teaching activity." Id.,
at 238, 699 N. E. 2d, at 471 (emphasis in original). The majority's review of the State's evidence was therefore "inconsequential" to the only question in the case: whether the
challenged legislative action was arbitrary or irrational.
See id., at 239-242, 699 N. E. 2d, at 472-473. Answering
this question, the dissent concluded that imposing uniform
workload standards via the exemption "is not an irrational
means of effecting an increasing in teaching activity. In
fact, it was probably the most direct means of accomplishing
that objective available to the General Assembly." Id., at
241, 699 N. E. 2d, at 473.

We agree that the Ohio Supreme Court's holding cannot
be reconciled with the requirements of the Equal Protection
Clause. We have repeatedly held that "a classification neither involving fundamental rights nor proceeding along sus526US1 Unit: $U35 [12-11-00 12:23:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN

pect lines . . . cannot run afoul of the Equal Protection Clause
if there is a rational relationship between disparity of treatment and some legitimate governmental purpose." Heller
v. Doe, 509 U. S. 312, 319-321 (1993) (citations omitted); FCC
v. Beach Communications, Inc., 508 U. S. 307, 313-314
(1993); Nordlinger v. Hahn, 505 U. S. 1, 11 (1992). The legislative classification created by $ 3345.45 passes this test.
One of the statute's objectives was to increase the time spent
by faculty in the classroom; the imposition of a faculty workload policy not subject to collective bargaining was an entirely rational step to accomplish this objective. The legislature could quite reasonably have concluded that the policy
animating the law would have been undercut and likely varied if it were subject to collective bargaining. The State,
in effect, decided that the attainment of this goal was more
important than the system of collective bargaining that had
previously included university professors. See Vance v.
Bradley, 440 U. S. 93 (1979) (upholding a similar enactment
of Congress providing that federal employees covered by the
Foreign Service retirement system, but not those covered by
the Civil Service retirement system, would be required to
retire at age 60).

The fact that the record before the Ohio courts did not
show that collective bargaining in the past had lead to the
decline in classroom time for faculty does not detract from
the rationality of the legislative decision. See Heller, supra,
at 320 ("A State . . . has no obligation to produce evidence to
sustain the rationality of a statutory classification"). The
legislature wanted a uniform workload policy to be in place
by a certain date. It could properly conclude that collective
bargaining about that policy in the future would interfere
with the attainment of this end. Under our precedent, this
is sufficient to sustain the exclusion of university professors
from the otherwise general collective-bargaining scheme for
public employees.

I join the per curiam opinion recognizing, as the Court didin

Nordlinger v. Hahn, 505 U. S. 1 (1992), that for the minerun of economic regulations that do not trigger heightened

scrutiny, it is appropriate to inquire whether the lawmak-er's classification

"rationally furthers a legitimate state interest. In gen-eral, the Equal Protection Clause is satisfied so long as
there is a plausible policy reason for the classification,see

United States Railroad Retirement Bd. v. Fritz, 449
U. S. 166, 174, 179 (1980), the legislative facts on which
the classification is apparently based rationally mayhave been considered to be true by the governmental

decisionmaker, see Minnesota v. Clover Leaf Creamery
Co., 449 U. S. 456, 464 (1981), and the relationship of the
classification to its goal is not so attenuated as to renderthe distinction arbitrary or irrational, see

I also recognize that a summary disposition is not a fit occa-sion for elaborate discussion of our rational-basis standards

of review. See Hohn v. United States, 524 U. S. 236, 251(1998) (opinions rendered without full briefing or argument
have muted precedential value). Justice Stevens empha-sizes that this case is of dominant importance to the state
universities in Ohio, see post, at 131 (dissenting opinion); in
that light, the Ohio Supreme Court is of course at liberty toresolve the matter under the Ohio Constitution.

Stevens, J., dissenting

Justice Stevens, dissenting.
While surveying the flood of law reviews that crosses mydesk, I have sometimes wondered whether law professors

have any time to spend teaching their students about thelaw. Apparently, a majority of the legislators in Ohio had a
similar reaction to the work product of faculty members inOhio's several state universities. By enacting Ohio Rev.
Code Ann. $ 3345.45 (1997), the legislators decided to dosomething about what they perceived to be a problem that
neither the State Board of Regents nor the trustees of thoseuniversities could solve for themselves. Section 3345.45 directs that board and those trustees to develop standards andpolicies for instructional workloads for university faculty
members. It provides that faculty members of public uni-versities, unlike any other group of public employees, may
not engage in collective bargaining about their workload.How the intellectually gifted citizens of Ohio who have
selected teaching as their profession shall allocate their pro-fessional endeavors between research and teaching is a matter of great importance to themselves, to their students, andto the consumers of their scholarly writing. Who shall decide how the balance between research and teaching shall bestruck presents a similarly important question.

Prior to $ 3345.45, the faculty members' freedom to makesuch decisions was constrained only by the teaching or research assignments imposed by their superiors in the educa-tional establishment. By its enactment of $ 3345.45, the
Ohio General Assembly has asserted an interest in playinga role in making these decisions. As a result of the filing of
this lawsuit, first the Ohio courts and now this Court have
also participated in this decisional process.Buried beneath the legal arguments advanced in this case

lies a debate over academic freedom. In my judgment therelevant sources of constraint on that freedom are (1) the
self-discipline of the teacher, (2) her faculty or departmentsupervisors, (3) the trustees of the university where she

teaches, (4) the State Board of Regents, (5) the state legis-lature, (6) state judges, and, finally, (7) the judges sitting

on this Court. I omit any reference to the collective-bargaining representatives of the teachers because, as everyone agrees, there is no evidence that collective bargaininghas had any effect on the increased emphasis on research
over teaching that gave rise to the enactment of $ 3345.45.1I have neither the mandate nor the inclination to assess
whether the decision of the Ohio General Assembly to enact$ 3345.45 was wise or unwise. I am equally convinced that
this Court should not review the role played by the Ohiojudiciary in deciding how to resolve this dispute. The case
is important to the state universities in Ohio, but it has little,if any, national significance. Seven of the eleven Ohio
judges who reviewed the case concluded that the Ohio stat-ute violated the Ohio Constitution.

1 After reviewing studies prepared by the Legislative Office of Education Oversight, by a Special Task Force on Challenges & Opportunities for
Higher Education in Ohio, by the Regents' Advisory Committee on Faculty Workload Standards & Guidelines, by the Regents' Advisory Committee on Faculty Workload, and by the Ohio Board of Regents, as well as
statistical data collected from Ohio colleges and universities, the Ohio Supreme Court concluded:

"We have reviewed each of these reports [relied upon by Central State
University], and all other evidence contained in the record, and can conclude with confidence that there is not a shred of evidence in the entire
record which links collective bargaining with the decline in teaching over
the last decade, or in any way purports to establish that collective bargaining contributed in the slightest to the lost faculty time devoted to undergraduate teaching. Indeed, these reports appear to indicate that factors
other than collective bargaining are responsible for the decline in teaching
activity." 83 Ohio St. 3d 229, 236, 699 N. E. 2d 463, 469 (1998).

2 The seven judges include the four from the majority opinion of the

State Supreme Court and the three judges of the Court of Appeals who
originally struck down $ 3345.45.

The State Supreme Court held that the statute violated Article I, $ 2,
of the Ohio Constitution, which provides:

opinion of the Ohio Supreme Court did not cite a single casedecided by this Court.

If the State Supreme Court did misconstrue the EqualProtection Clause of the Federal Constitution, the impact of
that arguable error is of consequence only in the State of
Ohio, and will, in any event, turn out to be totally harmlessif that court adheres to its previously announced interpretation of the State Constitution. I therefore believe that theCourt should deny the petition for certiorari.

If the case does warrant this Court's review, it should notbe decided summarily. It surely should not be disposed of
simply by quoting descriptions of the rational-basis standardof review articulated in four nonunanimous opinions of this
Court deciding wholly dissimilar issues. Cases applying the
rational-basis test have described that standard in variousways. Compare,

e. g., the Court's opinions in F. S. Royster
Guano Co. v. Virginia, 253 U. S. 412, 415 (1920), and Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc., 473 U. S. 432, 446
(1985), with the majority opinion in Railroad Retirement Bd.
v. Fritz, 449 U. S. 166, 174-177 (1980). Indeed, in the latter
case there were three opinions, each of which formulated the
rational-basis standard differently from the other two. Ibid.

in judgment); id., at 183-184 (Brennan, J., dissenting).3

reform, or abolish the same, whenever they may deem it necessary; and
no special privileges or immunities shall ever be granted, that may not be
altered, revoked, or repealed by the General Assembly." The court found
it unnecessary to consider respondent's additional arguments based, in
part, on other provisions of the State Constitution. Id., at 237, 699 N. E.
2d, at 470.

3 In a footnote to the opinion in Fritz that cited a number of rationalbasis cases, the Court made this observation:

"The most arrogant legal scholar would not claim that all of these cases
applied a uniform or consistent test under equal protection principles.
And realistically speaking, we can be no more certain that this opinion will
remain undisturbed than were those who joined the opinion in Lindsley

Stevens, J., dissenting
The Court's disposition of this case seems to assume that
an incantation of the rational-basis test, together with speculation that collective bargaining might interfere with the
adoption of uniform faculty workload policies, makes it unnecessary to consider any other facts or arguments that
might inform an exercise of judgment about the underlying
issue. While I am not prepared to express an opinion about
the ultimate merits of the case, I can identify a serious flaw
in the Court's mechanistic analysis. The Court assumes
that the question improperly answered by the Ohio Supreme
Court is whether collective bargaining may interfere with
the attainment of a uniform workload policy.4 But that is
not the issue, because this case involves the Equal Protection
Clause, and not the principles of substantive due process.

The question posed by this case is whether there is a rational basis for discriminating against faculty members by
depriving them of bargaining assistance that is available to
all other public employees in the State of Ohio.5 Even the
Court's speculation about the possible adverse consequences
of collective bargaining about faculty workload does not explain why collective bargaining about the workloads of all
other public employees might not give rise to the same adverse consequences arising from lack of statewide uniformCo. [v. Virginia, 253 U. S. 412 (1920)], or any of the other cases referred
to in this opinion and in the dissenting opinion." 449 U. S., at 176-177,
n. 10.

4 In addition, the Court's opinion assumes that the ultimate objective of

having teachers spend more time in classrooms requires that there be a
single workload policy for each of the State's universities and for each of
the subjects taught in those schools, whether Latin, medicine, or astrophysics. I am not at all sure that such an assumption is rational.

5 Ohio Rev. Code Ann. $ 4117.03(A)(4) (1998) provides: "Public employees

have the right to: . . . Bargain collectively with their public employers to
determine wages, hours, terms and other conditions of employment and
the continuation, modification, or deletion of an existing provision of
a collective bargaining agreement, and enter into collective bargaining
agreements. . . ."

provide a rational basis for giving them more bargaining as-sistance than other public employees. In any event, no one

Motion denied.

Per Curiam.
Pro se petitioner Rivera seeks leave to proceed in forma
pauperis under Rule 39 of this Court. We deny this request
pursuant to Rule 39.8. Rivera is allowed until April 12,
1999, within which to pay the docketing fee required by Rule
38 and to submit his petition in compliance with this Court's
Rule 33.1. We also direct the Clerk not to accept any further petitions for certiorari nor petitions for extraordinary
writs from Rivera in noncriminal matters unless he pays the

in compliance with Rule 33.1.

Rivera has abused this Court's certiorari and extraordinary writ processes. In January of this year, we twice invoked Rule 39.8 to deny Rivera in forma pauperis status.
See Rivera v. Allin, 525 U. S. 1065; In re Rivera, 525 U. S.

which were both patently frivolous and had been denied
without recorded dissent. The instant petition for certiorari thus constitutes Rivera's 13th frivolous filing with this

We enter the order barring prospective filings for the rea-sons discussed in Martin v. District of Columbia Court of

KUMHO TIRE CO., LTD., et al. v. CARMICHAEL

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eleventh circuit

No. 97-1709. Argued December 7, 1998--Decided March 23, 1999
When a tire on the vehicle driven by Patrick Carmichael blew out and the

vehicle overturned, one passenger died and the others were injured.
The survivors and the decedent's representative, respondents here,
brought this diversity suit against the tire's maker and its distributor
(collectively Kumho Tire), claiming that the tire that failed was defective. They rested their case in significant part upon the depositions of
a tire failure analyst, Dennis Carlson, Jr., who intended to testify that,
in his expert opinion, a defect in the tire's manufacture or design caused
the blowout. That opinion was based upon a visual and tactile inspection of the tire and upon the theory that in the absence of at least two
of four specific, physical symptoms indicating tire abuse, the tire failure
of the sort that occurred here was caused by a defect. Kumho Tire
moved to exclude Carlson's testimony on the ground that his methodology failed to satisfy Federal Rule of Evidence 702, which says: "If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of
fact . . . , a witness qualified as an expert . . . may testify thereto in
the form of an opinion." Granting the motion (and entering summary
judgment for the defendants), the District Court acknowledged that it
should act as a reliability "gatekeeper" under Daubert v. Merrell Dow
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U. S. 579, 589, in which this Court held that
Rule 702 imposes a special obligation upon a trial judge to ensure that
scientific testimony is not only relevant, but reliable. The court noted
that Daubert discussed four factors--testing, peer review, error rates,
and "acceptability" in the relevant scientific community--which might
prove helpful in determining the reliability of a particular scientific theory or technique, id., at 593-594, and found that those factors argued
against the reliability of Carlson's methodology. On the plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration, the court agreed that Daubert should be applied flexibly, that its four factors were simply illustrative, and that
other factors could argue in favor of admissibility. However, the court
affirmed its earlier order because it found insufficient indications of the
reliability of Carlson's methodology. In reversing, the Eleventh Circuit
held that the District Court had erred as a matter of law in applying
Daubert. Believing that Daubert was limited to the scientific context,

526US1 Unit: $U37 [01-03-01 13:12:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN
138 KUMHO TIRE CO. v. CARMICHAEL

Syllabus
the court held that the Daubert factors did not apply to Carlson's testimony, which it characterized as skill or experience based.

Held:

1. The Daubert factors may apply to the testimony of engineers and
other experts who are not scientists. Pp. 147-153.

(a) The Daubert "gatekeeping" obligation applies not only to "scientific" testimony, but to all expert testimony. Rule 702 does not distinguish between "scientific" knowledge and "technical" or "other specialized" knowledge, but makes clear that any such knowledge might
become the subject of expert testimony. It is the Rule's word "knowledge," not the words (like "scientific") that modify that word, that establishes a standard of evidentiary reliability. 509 U. S., at 589-590.
Daubert referred only to "scientific" knowledge because that was the
nature of the expertise there at issue. Id., at 590, n. 8. Neither is the
evidentiary rationale underlying Daubert's "gatekeeping" determination limited to "scientific" knowledge. Rules 702 and 703 grant all expert witnesses, not just "scientific" ones, testimonial latitude unavailable
to other witnesses on the assumption that the expert's opinion will have
a reliable basis in the knowledge and experience of his discipline. Id.,
at 592. Finally, it would prove difficult, if not impossible, for judges
to administer evidentiary rules under which a "gatekeeping" obligation
depended upon a distinction between "scientific" knowledge and "technical" or "other specialized" knowledge, since there is no clear line dividing the one from the others and no convincing need to make such distinctions. Pp. 147-149.

(b) A trial judge determining the admissibility of an engineering
expert's testimony may consider one or more of the specific Daubert
factors. The emphasis on the word "may" reflects Daubert's description of the Rule 702 inquiry as "a flexible one." 509 U. S., at 594. The
Daubert factors do not constitute a definitive checklist or test, id., at
593, and the gatekeeping inquiry must be tied to the particular facts,
id., at 591. Those factors may or may not be pertinent in assessing
reliability, depending on the nature of the issue, the expert's particular expertise, and the subject of his testimony. Some of those factors
may be helpful in evaluating the reliability even of experience-based
expert testimony, and the Court of Appeals erred insofar as it ruled
those factors out in such cases. In determining whether particular expert testimony is reliable, the trial court should consider the specific
Daubert factors where they are reasonable measures of reliability.
Pp. 149-152.

(c) A court of appeals must apply an abuse-of-discretion standard
when it reviews a trial court's decision to admit or exclude expert

526US1 Unit: $U37 [01-03-01 13:12:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Syllabus
testimony. General Electric Co. v. Joiner, 522 U. S. 136, 138-139.
That standard applies as much to the trial court's decisions about how
to determine reliability as to its ultimate conclusion. Thus, whether
Daubert's specific factors are, or are not, reasonable measures of reliability in a particular case is a matter that the law grants the trial judge
broad latitude to determine. See id., at 143. The Eleventh Circuit
erred insofar as it held to the contrary. Pp. 152-153.

2. Application of the foregoing standards demonstrates that the District Court's decision not to admit Carlson's expert testimony was lawful. The District Court did not question Carlson's qualifications, but
excluded his testimony because it initially doubted his methodology and
then found it unreliable after examining the transcript in some detail
and considering respondents' defense of it. The doubts that triggered
the court's initial inquiry were reasonable, as was the court's ultimate
conclusion that Carlson could not reliably determine the cause of the
failure of the tire in question. The question was not the reliability of
Carlson's methodology in general, but rather whether he could reliably
determine the cause of failure of the particular tire at issue. That tire,
Carlson conceded, had traveled far enough so that some of the tread had
been worn bald, it should have been taken out of service, it had been
repaired (inadequately) for punctures, and it bore some of the very
marks that he said indicated, not a defect, but abuse. Moreover, Carlson's own testimony cast considerable doubt upon the reliability of both
his theory about the need for at least two signs of abuse and his proposition about the significance of visual inspection in this case. Respondents stress that other tire failure experts, like Carlson, rely on visual
and tactile examinations of tires. But there is no indication in the record that other experts in the industry use Carlson's particular approach
or that tire experts normally make the very fine distinctions necessary
to support his conclusions, nor are there references to articles or papers
that validate his approach. Respondents' argument that the District
Court too rigidly applied Daubert might have had some validity with
respect to the court's initial opinion, but fails because the court, on reconsideration, recognized that the relevant reliability inquiry should be
"flexible," and ultimately based its decision upon Carlson's failure to
satisfy either Daubert's factors or any other set of reasonable reliability
criteria. Pp. 153-158.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.
In Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509U. S. 579 (1993), this Court focused upon the admissibility of

scientific expert testimony. It pointed out that such testi-mony is admissible only if it is both relevant and reliable.
And it held that the Federal Rules of Evidence "assign tothe trial judge the task of ensuring that an expert's testimony both rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant tothe task at hand." Id., at 597. The Court also discussed
certain more specific factors, such as testing, peer review,error rates, and "acceptability" in the relevant scientific community, some or all of which might prove helpful in determin-ing the reliability of a particular scientific "theory or technique." Id., at 593-594.This case requires us to decide how

Daubert applies tothe testimony of engineers and other experts who are not

scientists. We conclude that Daubert's general holding--setting forth the trial judge's general "gatekeeping" obligation--applies not only to testimony based on "scientific"knowledge, but also to testimony based on "technical" and
"other specialized" knowledge. See Fed. Rule Evid. 702.We also conclude that a trial court

may consider one or moreof the more specific factors that Daubert mentioned when

doing so will help determine that testimony's reliability.But, as the Court stated in Daubert, the test of reliability is
"flexible," and Daubert's list of specific factors neither neces-sarily nor exclusively applies to all experts or in every case.

142 KUMHO TIRE CO. v. CARMICHAEL

Opinion of the Court
Rather, the law grants a district court the same broad latitude when it decides how to determine reliability as it enjoys
in respect to its ultimate reliability determination. See
General Electric Co. v. Joiner, 522 U. S. 136, 143 (1997)
(courts of appeals are to apply "abuse of discretion" standard
when reviewing district court's reliability determination).
Applying these standards, we determine that the District
Court's decision in this case--not to admit certain expert
testimony--was within its discretion and therefore lawful.

I
On July 6, 1993, the right rear tire of a minivan driven by
Patrick Carmichael blew out. In the accident that followed,
one of the passengers died, and others were severely injured.
In October 1993, the Carmichaels brought this diversity suit
against the tire's maker and its distributor, whom we refer
to collectively as Kumho Tire, claiming that the tire was defective. The plaintiffs rested their case in significant part
upon deposition testimony provided by an expert in tire failure analysis, Dennis Carlson, Jr., who intended to testify in
support of their conclusion.

Carlson's depositions relied upon certain features of tire
technology that are not in dispute. A steel-belted radial tire
like the Carmichaels' is made up of a "carcass" containing
many layers of flexible cords, called "plies," along which (between the cords and the outer tread) are laid steel strips
called "belts." Steel wire loops, called "beads," hold the
cords together at the plies' bottom edges. An outer layer,
called the "tread," encases the carcass, and the entire tire is
bound together in rubber, through the application of heat
and various chemicals. See generally, e. g., J. Dixon, Tires,
Suspension and Handling 68-72 (2d ed. 1996). The bead of
the tire sits upon a "bead seat," which is part of the wheel
assembly. That assembly contains a "rim flange," which
extends over the bead and rests against the side of the

Opinion of the Court
tire. See M. Mavrigian, Performance Wheels & Tires 81, 83
(1998) (illustrations).

A. Markovich, How To Buy and Care For Tires 4 (1994).
Carlson's testimony also accepted certain background facts
about the tire in question. He assumed that before the
blowout the tire had traveled far. (The tire was made in
1988 and had been installed some time before the Carmichaels bought the used minivan in March 1993; the Carmichaels had driven the van approximately 7,000 additional
miles in the two months they had owned it.) Carlson noted
that the tire's tread depth, which was 11/32 of an inch when
new, App. 242, had been worn down to depths that ranged
from 3/32 of an inch along some parts of the tire, to nothing
at all along others. Id., at 287. He conceded that the tire
tread had at least two punctures which had been inadequately repaired. Id., at 258-261, 322.

Despite the tire's age and history, Carlson concluded that
a defect in its manufacture or design caused the blowout.
He rested this conclusion in part upon three premises which,

526US1 Unit: $U37 [01-03-01 13:12:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN
144 KUMHO TIRE CO. v. CARMICHAEL

Opinion of the Court
for present purposes, we must assume are not in dispute:First, a tire's carcass should stay bound to the inner side of

the tread for a significant period of time after its tread depthhas worn away.

Id., at 208-209. Second, the tread of the
tire at issue had separated from its inner steel-belted carcass
prior to the accident. Id., at 336. Third, this "separation"caused the blowout.

Ibid.
Carlson's conclusion that a defect caused the separation,however, rested upon certain other propositions, several of

which the defendants strongly dispute. First, Carlson saidthat if a separation is

not caused by a certain kind of tire
misuse called "overdeflection" (which consists of underinflating the tire or causing it to carry too much weight, thereby
generating heat that can undo the chemical tread/carcass
bond), then, ordinarily, its cause is a tire defect. Id., at 193-
195, 277-278. Second, he said that if a tire has been subject
to sufficient overdeflection to cause a separation, it should
reveal certain physical symptoms. These symptoms include
(a) tread wear on the tire's shoulder that is greater than the
tread wear along the tire's center, id., at 211; (b) signs of a
"bead groove," where the beads have been pushed too hard
against the bead seat on the inside of the tire's rim, id., at
196-197; (c) sidewalls of the tire with physical signs of deterioration, such as discoloration, id., at 212; and/or (d) marks on
the tire's rim flange, id., at 219-220. Third, Carlson said
that where he does not find at least two of the four physical signs just mentioned (and presumably where there is no
reason to suspect a less common cause of separation), he
concludes that a manufacturing or design defect caused the
separation. Id., at 223-224.

Carlson added that he had inspected the tire in question.
He conceded that the tire to a limited degree showed greater
wear on the shoulder than in the center, some signs of "bead
groove," some discoloration, a few marks on the rim flange,
and inadequately filled puncture holes (which can also cause
heat that might lead to separation). Id., at 256-257, 258-

145Cite as: 526 U. S. 137 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
261, 277, 303-304, 308. But, in each instance, he testifiedthat the symptoms were not significant, and he explained

why he believed that they did not reveal overdeflection.For example, the extra shoulder wear, he said, appeared primarily on one shoulder, whereas an overdeflected tire would
reveal equally abnormal wear on both shoulders. Id., at277. Carlson concluded that the tire did not bear at least

two of the four overdeflection symptoms, nor was there anyless obvious cause of separation; and since neither overdeflection nor the punctures caused the blowout, a defect musthave done so.

Kumho Tire moved the District Court to exclude Carlson's
testimony on the ground that his methodology failed Rule
702's reliability requirement. The court agreed with Kumho
that it should act as a Daubert-type reliability "gatekeeper,"
even though one might consider Carlson's testimony as
"technical," rather than "scientific." See Carmichael v.
Samyang Tires, Inc., 923 F. Supp. 1514, 1521-1522 (SD Ala.
1996). The court then examined Carlson's methodology in
light of the reliability-related factors that Daubert mentioned, such as a theory's testability, whether it "has been a
subject of peer review or publication," the "known or potential rate of error," and the "degree of acceptance . . . within
the relevant scientific community." 923 F. Supp., at 1520
(citing Daubert, 509 U. S., at 589-595). The District Court
found that all those factors argued against the reliability of
Carlson's methods, and it granted the motion to exclude the
testimony (as well as the defendants' accompanying motion
for summary judgment).

The plaintiffs, arguing that the court's application of the
Daubert factors was too "inflexible," asked for reconsideration. And the court granted that motion. Carmichael
v. Samyang Tires, Inc., Civ. Action No. 93-0860-CB-S (SD
Ala., June 5, 1996), App. to Pet. for Cert. 1c. After reconsidering the matter, the court agreed with the plaintiffs that
Daubert should be applied flexibly, that its four factors were

146 KUMHO TIRE CO. v. CARMICHAEL

Opinion of the Court
simply illustrative, and that other factors could argue infavor of admissibility. It conceded that there may be widespread acceptance of a "visual-inspection method" for somerelevant purposes. But the court found insufficient indications of the reliability of

"the component of Carlson's tire failure analysis which
most concerned the Court, namely, the methodology em-ployed by the expert in analyzing the data obtained in

the visual inspection, and the scientific basis, if any, forsuch an analysis."

Id., at 6c.

It consequently affirmed its earlier order declaring Carlson'stestimony inadmissible and granting the defendants' motion

for summary judgment.The Eleventh Circuit reversed. See

Carmichael v. Samyang Tire, Inc., 131 F. 3d 1433 (1997). It "review[ed] . . . de
novo" the "district court's legal decision to apply Daubert."
Id., at 1435. It noted that "the Supreme Court in Daubert
explicitly limited its holding to cover only the `scientific con-text,' " adding that "a

Daubert analysis" applies only where
an expert relies "on the application of scientific principles,"rather than "on skill- or experience-based observation."

Id., at 1435-1436. It concluded that Carlson's testimony,which it viewed as relying on experience, "falls outside the
scope of Daubert," that "the district court erred as a matter
of law by applying Daubert in this case," and that the casemust be remanded for further (nonDaubert-type) consideration under Rule 702. 131 F. 3d, at 1436.Kumho Tire petitioned for certiorari, asking us to determine whether a trial court "may" consider Daubert's specific
"factors" when determining the "admissibility of an engineering expert's testimony." Pet. for Cert. i. We granted
certiorari in light of uncertainty among the lower courts
about whether, or how, Daubert applies to expert testimony
that might be characterized as based not upon "scientific"
knowledge, but rather upon "technical" or "other special526US1 Unit: $U37 [01-03-01 13:12:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN

II

A

In Daubert, this Court held that Federal Rule of Evidence
702 imposes a special obligation upon a trial judge to "ensure
that any and all scientific testimony . . . is not only relevant,
but reliable." 509 U. S., at 589. The initial question before
us is whether this basic gatekeeping obligation applies only
to "scientific" testimony or to all expert testimony. We, like
the parties, believe that it applies to all expert testimony.
See Brief for Petitioners 19; Brief for Respondents 17.

For one thing, Rule 702 itself says:

"If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge
will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence
or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as
an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or
education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion
or otherwise."

This language makes no relevant distinction between "scientific" knowledge and "technical" or "other specialized"
knowledge. It makes clear that any such knowledge might
become the subject of expert testimony. In Daubert, the
Court specified that it is the Rule's word "knowledge," not
the words (like "scientific") that modify that word, that "establishes a standard of evidentiary reliability." 509 U. S., at
589-590. Hence, as a matter of language, the Rule applies
its reliability standard to all "scientific," "technical," or
"other specialized" matters within its scope. We concede
that the Court in Daubert referred only to "scientific"
knowledge. But as the Court there said, it referred to "sci526US1 Unit: $U37 [01-03-01 13:12:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN
148 KUMHO TIRE CO. v. CARMICHAEL

Opinion of the Court
entific" testimony "because that [wa]s the nature of the ex-pertise" at issue.

Id., at 590, n. 8.
Neither is the evidentiary rationale that underlay theCourt's basic

Daubert "gatekeeping" determination limited
to "scientific" knowledge. Daubert pointed out that Federal
Rules 702 and 703 grant expert witnesses testimonial lati-tude unavailable to other witnesses on the "assumption that

the expert's opinion will have a reliable basis in the knowl-edge and experience of his discipline."

Id., at 592 (pointing
out that experts may testify to opinions, including those thatare not based on firsthand knowledge or observation). The

Rules grant that latitude to all experts, not just to "scientific" ones.

Finally, it would prove difficult, if not impossible, for
judges to administer evidentiary rules under which a gatekeeping obligation depended upon a distinction between "scientific" knowledge and "technical" or "other specialized"
knowledge. There is no clear line that divides the one from
the others. Disciplines such as engineering rest upon scientific knowledge. Pure scientific theory itself may depend for
its development upon observation and properly engineered
machinery. And conceptual efforts to distinguish the two
are unlikely to produce clear legal lines capable of application
in particular cases. Cf. Brief for National Academy of Engineering as Amicus Curiae 9 (scientist seeks to understand
nature while the engineer seeks nature's modification); Brief
for Rubber Manufacturers Association as Amicus Curiae
14-16 (engineering, as an " `applied science,' " relies on "scientific reasoning and methodology"); Brief for John Allen
et al. as Amici Curiae 6 (engineering relies upon "scientific
knowledge and methods").

Neither is there a convincing need to make such distinctions. Experts of all kinds tie observations to conclusions
through the use of what Judge Learned Hand called "general
truths derived from . . . specialized experience." Hand, Historical and Practical Considerations Regarding Expert Testi526US1 Unit: $U37 [01-03-01 13:12:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN

149Cite as: 526 U. S. 137 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
mony, 15 Harv. L. Rev. 40, 54 (1901). And whether the spe-cific expert testimony focuses upon specialized observations,

the specialized translation of those observations into theory,a specialized theory itself, or the application of such a theory
in a particular case, the expert's testimony often will rest
"upon an experience confessedly foreign in kind to [thejury's] own."

Ibid. The trial judge's effort to assure that
the specialized testimony is reliable and relevant can help thejury evaluate that foreign experience, whether the testimony

reflects scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge.We conclude that

Daubert's general principles apply to the
expert matters described in Rule 702. The Rule, in respectto all such matters, "establishes a standard of evidentiary

reliability." 509 U. S., at 590. It "requires a valid . . . connection to the pertinent inquiry as a precondition to admissi-bility."

Id., at 592. And where such testimony's factual
basis, data, principles, methods, or their application arecalled sufficiently into question, see Part III,

infra, the trial
judge must determine whether the testimony has "a reliablebasis in the knowledge and experience of [the relevant] discipline." 509 U. S., at 592. B

Petitioners ask more specifically whether a trial judgedetermining the "admissibility of an engineering expert's
testimony" may consider several more specific factors that
Daubert said might "bear on" a judge's gatekeeping determination. Brief for Petitioners i. These factors include:

--Whether a "theory or technique . . . can be (and has
been) tested";

--Whether it "has been subjected to peer review and
publication";

--Whether, in respect to a particular technique, there is
a high "known or potential rate of error" and whether
there are "standards controlling the technique's opera-tion"; and

526US1 Unit: $U37 [01-03-01 13:12:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN
150 KUMHO TIRE CO. v. CARMICHAEL

Opinion of the Court
--Whether the theory or technique enjoys " `general ac-ceptance' " within a " `relevant scientific community.' "

509 U. S., at 592-594.
Emphasizing the word "may" in the question, we answerthat question yes.

Engineering testimony rests upon scientific foundations,the reliability of which will be at issue in some cases. See,
e. g., Brief for Stephen N. Bobo et al. as Amici Curiae 23(stressing the scientific bases of engineering disciplines). In
other cases, the relevant reliability concerns may focus uponpersonal knowledge or experience. As the Solicitor General
points out, there are many different kinds of experts, andmany different kinds of expertise. See Brief for United
States as Amicus Curiae 18-19, and n. 5 (citing cases involv-ing experts in drug terms, handwriting analysis, criminal
modus operandi, land valuation, agricultural practices, rail-road procedures, attorney's fee valuation, and others). Our
emphasis on the word "may" thus reflects Daubert's descrip-tion of the Rule 702 inquiry as "a flexible one." 509 U. S.,
at 594. Daubert makes clear that the factors it mentions do
not constitute a "definitive checklist or test." Id., at 593.And Daubert adds that the gatekeeping inquiry must be

" `tied to the facts' " of a particular "case." Id., at 591 (quot-ing

United States v. Downing, 753 F. 2d 1224, 1242 (CA31985)). We agree with the Solicitor General that "[t]he factors identified in Daubert may or may not be pertinent inassessing reliability, depending on the nature of the issue,
the expert's particular expertise, and the subject of his testi-mony." Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 19. The
conclusion, in our view, is that we can neither rule out, norrule in, for all cases and for all time the applicability of the
factors mentioned in Daubert, nor can we now do so for sub-sets of cases categorized by category of expert or by kind of
evidence. Too much depends upon the particular circum-stances of the particular case at issue.

526US1 Unit: $U37 [01-03-01 13:12:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN

151Cite as: 526 U. S. 137 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
Daubert itself is not to the contrary. It made clear that
its list of factors was meant to be helpful, not definitive. Indeed, those factors do not all necessarily apply even in every
instance in which the reliability of scientific testimony is
challenged. It might not be surprising in a particular case,
for example, that a claim made by a scientific witness has
never been the subject of peer review, for the particular application at issue may never previously have interested any
scientist. Nor, on the other hand, does the presence of Daubert's general acceptance factor help show that an expert's
testimony is reliable where the discipline itself lacks reliability, as, for example, do theories grounded in any so-called
generally accepted principles of astrology or necromancy.

At the same time, and contrary to the Court of Appeals'
view, some of Daubert's questions can help to evaluate the
reliability even of experience-based testimony. In certain
cases, it will be appropriate for the trial judge to ask, for
example, how often an engineering expert's experiencebased methodology has produced erroneous results, or
whether such a method is generally accepted in the relevant
engineering community. Likewise, it will at times be useful
to ask even of a witness whose expertise is based purely on
experience, say, a perfume tester able to distinguish among
140 odors at a sniff, whether his preparation is of a kind that
others in the field would recognize as acceptable.

We must therefore disagree with the Eleventh Circuit's
holding that a trial judge may ask questions of the sort Daubert mentioned only where an expert "relies on the application of scientific principles," but not where an expert relies
"on skill- or experience-based observation." 131 F. 3d, at
1435. We do not believe that Rule 702 creates a schematism
that segregates expertise by type while mapping certain
kinds of questions to certain kinds of experts. Life and the
legal cases that it generates are too complex to warrant so
definitive a match.

526US1 Unit: $U37 [01-03-01 13:12:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN
152 KUMHO TIRE CO. v. CARMICHAEL

Opinion of the Court
To say this is not to deny the importance of Daubert'sgatekeeping requirement. The objective of that requirement is to ensure the reliability and relevancy of experttestimony. It is to make certain that an expert, whether
basing testimony upon professional studies or personalexperience, employs in the courtroom the same level of intellectual rigor that characterizes the practice of an expert inthe relevant field. Nor do we deny that, as stated in

Dau-bert, the particular questions that it mentioned will often be

appropriate for use in determining the reliability of chal-lenged expert testimony. Rather, we conclude that the trial
judge must have considerable leeway in deciding in a partic-ular case how to go about determining whether particular
expert testimony is reliable. That is to say, a trial courtshould consider the specific factors identified in

Daubertwhere they are reasonable measures of the reliability of

expert testimony. C

The trial court must have the same kind of latitude indeciding how to test an expert's reliability, and to decide
whether or when special briefing or other proceedings areneeded to investigate reliability, as it enjoys when it decides
whether that expert's relevant testimony is reliable. Ouropinion in

Joiner makes clear that a court of appeals is toapply an abuse-of-discretion standard when it "review[s] a

trial court's decision to admit or exclude expert testimony."522 U. S., at 138-139. That standard applies as much to the
trial court's decisions about how to determine reliability asto its ultimate conclusion. Otherwise, the trial judge would
lack the discretionary authority needed both to avoid un-necessary "reliability" proceedings in ordinary cases where
the reliability of an expert's methods is properly taken forgranted, and to require appropriate proceedings in the less
usual or more complex cases where cause for questioning theexpert's reliability arises. Indeed, the Rules seek to avoid
"unjustifiable expense and delay" as part of their search for

526US1 Unit: $U37 [01-03-01 13:12:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN

153Cite as: 526 U. S. 137 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
"truth" and the "jus[t] determin[ation]" of proceedings.Fed. Rule Evid. 102. Thus, whether Daubert's specific factors are, or are not, reasonable measures of reliability in aparticular case is a matter that the law grants the trial judge
broad latitude to determine. See Joiner, supra, at 143.And the Eleventh Circuit erred insofar as it held to the
contrary. III

We further explain the way in which a trial judge "may"consider

Daubert's factors by applying these considerationsto the case at hand, a matter that has been briefed exhaustively by the parties and their 19 amici. The District Courtdid not doubt Carlson's qualifications, which included a
masters degree in mechanical engineering, 10 years' workat Michelin America, Inc., and testimony as a tire failure
consultant in other tort cases. Rather, it excluded the tes-timony because, despite those qualifications, it initially
doubted, and then found unreliable, "the methodology em-ployed by the expert in analyzing the data obtained in the
visual inspection, and the scientific basis, if any, for such ananalysis." Civ. Action No. 93-0860-CB-S (SD Ala., June 5,
1996), App. to Pet. for Cert. 6c. After examining the tran-script in "some detail," 923 F. Supp., at 1518-1519, n. 4, and
after considering respondents' defense of Carlson's method-ology, the District Court determined that Carlson's testimony was not reliable. It fell outside the range where ex-perts might reasonably differ, and where the jury must
decide among the conflicting views of different experts, eventhough the evidence is "shaky." Daubert, 509 U. S., at 596.
In our view, the doubts that triggered the District Court'sinitial inquiry here were reasonable, as was the court's ultimate conclusion.For one thing, and contrary to respondents' suggestion,
the specific issue before the court was not the reasonableness
in general of a tire expert's use of a visual and tactile in-spection to determine whether overdeflection had caused

526US1 Unit: $U37 [01-03-01 13:12:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN
154 KUMHO TIRE CO. v. CARMICHAEL

Opinion of the Court
the tire's tread to separate from its steel-belted carcass.Rather, it was the reasonableness of using such an approach,

along with Carlson's particular method of analyzing the datathereby obtained, to draw a conclusion regarding

the particular matter to which the expert testimony was directly relevant. That matter concerned the likelihood that a defect inthe tire at issue caused its tread to separate from its carcass.

The tire in question, the expert conceded, had traveled farenough so that some of the tread had been worn bald; it
should have been taken out of service; it had been repaired(inadequately) for punctures; and it bore some of the very
marks that the expert said indicated, not a defect, but abuse
through overdeflection. See supra, at 143-144; App. 293-
294. The relevant issue was whether the expert could reliably determine the cause of this tire's separation.

Nor was the basis for Carlson's conclusion simply the general theory that, in the absence of evidence of abuse, a defect
will normally have caused a tire's separation. Rather, the
expert employed a more specific theory to establish the existence (or absence) of such abuse. Carlson testified precisely that in the absence of at least two of four signs of
abuse (proportionately greater tread wear on the shoulder;
signs of grooves caused by the beads; discolored sidewalls;
marks on the rim flange), he concludes that a defect caused
the separation. And his analysis depended upon acceptance
of a further implicit proposition, namely, that his visual and
tactile inspection could determine that the tire before him
had not been abused despite some evidence of the presence
of the very signs for which he looked (and two punctures).

For another thing, the transcripts of Carlson's depositions
support both the trial court's initial uncertainty and its final
conclusion. Those transcripts cast considerable doubt upon
the reliability of both the explicit theory (about the need for
two signs of abuse) and the implicit proposition (about the
significance of visual inspection in this case). Among other
things, the expert could not say whether the tire had trav526US1 Unit: $U37 [01-03-01 13:12:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN

eled more than 10, or 20, or 30, or 40, or 50 thousand miles,adding that 6,000 miles was "about how far" he could "say

with any certainty." Id., at 265. The court could rea-sonably have wondered about the reliability of a method of
visual and tactile inspection sufficiently precise to ascertain
with some certainty the abuse-related significance of minuteshoulder/center relative tread wear differences, but insufficiently precise to tell "with any certainty" from the treadwear whether a tire had traveled less than 10,000 or more
than 50,000 miles. And these concerns might have beenaugmented by Carlson's repeated reliance on the "subjective[ness]" of his mode of analysis in response to questions
seeking specific information regarding how he could differentiate between a tire that actually had been overdeflected and
a tire that merely looked as though it had been. Id., at 222,
224-225, 285-286. They would have been further augmented by the fact that Carlson said he had inspected the
tire itself for the first time the morning of his first deposition,
and then only for a few hours. (His initial conclusions were
based on photographs.) Id., at 180.

Moreover, prior to his first deposition, Carlson had issued
a signed report in which he concluded that the tire had "not
been . . . overloaded or underinflated," not because of the
absence of "two of four" signs of abuse, but simply because
"the rim flange impressions . . . were normal." Id., at 335-
336. That report also said that the "tread depth remaining
was 3/32 inch," id., at 336, though the opposing expert's (apparently undisputed) measurements indicate that the tread
depth taken at various positions around the tire actually
ranged from .5/32 of an inch to 4/32 of an inch, with the tire
apparently showing greater wear along both shoulders than
along the center, id., at 432-433.

Further, in respect to one sign of abuse, bead grooving,
the expert seemed to deny the sufficiency of his own simple
visual-inspection methodology. He testified that most tires
have some bead groove pattern, that where there is reason

156 KUMHO TIRE CO. v. CARMICHAEL

Opinion of the Court
to suspect an abnormal bead groove he would ideally "lookat a lot of [similar] tires" to know the grooving's significance,

and that he had not looked at many tires similar to the oneat issue.

Id., at 212-213, 214, 217.
Finally, the court, after looking for a defense of Carlson's
methodology as applied in these circumstances, found no con-vincing defense. Rather, it found (1) that "none" of the

Daubert factors, including that of "general acceptance" in therelevant expert community, indicated that Carlson's testimony was reliable, 923 F. Supp., at 1521; (2) that its ownanalysis "revealed no countervailing factors operating in
favor of admissibility which could outweigh those identified
in Daubert," App. to Pet. for Cert. 4c; and (3) that the "parties identified no such factors in their briefs," ibid. For
these three reasons taken together, it concluded that Carlson's testimony was unreliable.

Respondents now argue to us, as they did to the District
Court, that a method of tire failure analysis that employs a
visual/tactile inspection is a reliable method, and they point
both to its use by other experts and to Carlson's long experience working for Michelin as sufficient indication that that is
so. But no one denies that an expert might draw a conclusion from a set of observations based on extensive and specialized experience. Nor does anyone deny that, as a general matter, tire abuse may often be identified by qualified
experts through visual or tactile inspection of the tire. See
Affidavit of H. R. Baumgardner 1-2, cited in Brief for National Academy of Forensic Engineers as Amicus Curiae 16
(Tire engineers rely on visual examination and process of
elimination to analyze experimental test tires). As we said
before, supra, at 153-154, the question before the trial court
was specific, not general. The trial court had to decide
whether this particular expert had sufficient specialized
knowledge to assist the jurors "in deciding the particular
issues in the case." 4 J. McLaughlin, Weinstein's Federal Evidence || 702.05[1], p. 702-33 (2d ed. 1998); see also Advisory

of Civil Procedure and Evidence: Request for Comment 126(1998) (stressing that district courts must "scrutinize"
whether the "principles and methods" employed by an expert "have been properly applied to the facts of the case").The particular issue in this case concerned the use of Carlson's two-factor test and his related use of visual/tactile in-spection to draw conclusions on the basis of what seemed
small observational differences. We have found no indica-tion in the record that other experts in the industry use
Carlson's two-factor test or that tire experts such as Carlson
normally make the very fine distinctions about, say, the symmetry of comparatively greater shoulder tread wear that
were necessary, on Carlson's own theory, to support his conclusions. Nor, despite the prevalence of tire testing, does
anyone refer to any articles or papers that validate Carlson's
approach. Cf. Bobo, Tire Flaws and Separations, in Mechanics of Pneumatic Tires 636-637 (S. Clark ed. 1981); C.

Indeed, no one has argued that Carlson himself, were he still
working for Michelin, would have concluded in a report to
his employer that a similar tire was similarly defective on
grounds identical to those upon which he rested his conclusion here. Of course, Carlson himself claimed that his
method was accurate, but, as we pointed out in Joiner, "nothing in either Daubert or the Federal Rules of Evidence requires a district court to admit opinion evidence that is connected to existing data only by the ipse dixit of the expert."

158 KUMHO TIRE CO. v. CARMICHAEL

Scalia, J., concurring
Respondents additionally argue that the District Court toorigidly applied

Daubert's criteria. They read its opinion to
hold that a failure to satisfy any one of those criteria auto-matically renders expert testimony inadmissible. The District Court's initial opinion might have been vulnerable to
a form of this argument. There, the court, after rejectingrespondents' claim that Carlson's testimony was "exempted

from Daubert-style scrutiny" because it was "technical anal-ysis" rather than "scientific evidence," simply added that
"none of the four admissibility criteria outlined by the Daubert court are satisfied." 923 F. Supp., at 1521. Subsequently, however, the court granted respondents' motion forreconsideration. It then explicitly recognized that the relevant reliability inquiry "should be `flexible,' " that its " `overarching subject [should be] . . . validity' and reliability," and
that "Daubert was intended neither to be exhaustive nor to
apply in every case." App. to Pet. for Cert. 4c (quoting
Daubert, 509 U. S., at 594-595). And the court ultimately
based its decision upon Carlson's failure to satisfy either
Daubert's factors or any other set of reasonable reliability
criteria. In light of the record as developed by the parties,
that conclusion was within the District Court's lawful
discretion.

In sum, Rule 702 grants the district judge the discretionary authority, reviewable for its abuse, to determine reliability in light of the particular facts and circumstances of the
particular case. The District Court did not abuse its discretionary authority in this case. Hence, the judgment of the
Court of Appeals is

Reversed.

Justice Scalia, with whom Justice O'Connor and
Justice Thomas join, concurring.

I join the opinion of the Court, which makes clear that the
discretion it endorses--trial-court discretion in choosing the
manner of testing expert reliability--is not discretion to

abandon the gatekeeping function. I think it worth addingthat it is not discretion to perform the function inadequately.

Rather, it is discretion to choose among reasonable means ofexcluding expertise that is fausse and science that is junky.
Though, as the Court makes clear today, the Daubert factorsare not holy writ, in a particular case the failure to apply one
or another of them may be unreasonable, and hence an abuseof discretion.

Justice Stevens, concurring in part and dissenting inpart.
The only question that we granted certiorari to decide iswhether a trial judge "[m]ay . . . consider the four factors set
out by this Court in Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U. S. 579 (1993), in a Rule 702 analysis of ad-missibility of an engineering expert's testimony." Pet. for

Cert. i. That question is fully and correctly answered inParts I and II of the Court's opinion, which I join.

Part III answers the quite different question whether thetrial judge abused his discretion when he excluded the testimony of Dennis Carlson. Because a proper answer to thatquestion requires a study of the record that can be performed more efficiently by the Court of Appeals than by thenine Members of this Court, I would remand the case to the
Eleventh Circuit to perform that task. There are, of course,exceptions to most rules, but I firmly believe that it is neither fair to litigants nor good practice for this Court to reachout to decide questions not raised by the certiorari petition.
See General Electric Co. v. Joiner, 522 U. S. 136, 150-151(1997) (

Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting inpart).

Accordingly, while I do not feel qualified to disagree withthe well-reasoned factual analysis in Part III of the Court's
opinion, I do not join that Part, and I respectfully dissentfrom the Court's disposition of the case.

SOUTH CENTRAL BELL TELEPHONE CO. et al. v.ALABAMA

et al.

certiorari to the supreme court of alabama
No. 97-2045. Argued January 19, 1999--Decided March 23, 1999
Alabama requires each corporation doing business in that State to pay a

franchise tax based on the firm's capital. The tax for a domestic firm
is based on the par value of the firm's stock, which the firm may set at
a level well below its book or market value. An out-of-state firm must
pay tax based on the value of the actual amount of capital it employs
in the State, with no leeway to control its tax base. Reynolds Metals
Company and other corporations sued the state tax authorities, seeking
a refund of the foreign franchise tax they had paid on the ground that
the tax discriminated against foreign corporations in violation of the
Commerce and Equal Protection Clauses. The State Supreme Court
rejected the claims, holding that the special burden imposed on foreign
corporations simply offset a different burden imposed exclusively
on domestic corporations by Alabama's domestic shares tax. Subsequently, South Central Bell Telephone Company and other foreign corporations went to trial in the present suit, asserting similar Commerce
and Equal Protection Clause claims, though in respect to different tax
years. The trial court agreed with the Bell plaintiffs that the tax substantially discriminates against foreign corporations, but nonetheless
dismissed their claims as barred by res judicata in light of the State
Supreme Court's Reynolds Metals decision. The State Supreme
Court affirmed.

Held:

1. The State's argument that this Court lacks appellate jurisdiction
under the Eleventh Amendment was considered and rejected in McKesson Corp. v. Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, Fla. Dept.
of Business Regulation, 496 U. S. 18, 30. That case confirmed a longestablished and uniform practice of reviewing state-court decisions on
federal matters, regardless of whether the State was the plaintiff or the
defendant in the trial court. E. g., id., at 28. The Court will not revisit
that relatively recent precedent. Cf. Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833, 854-855. Pp. 165-166.

2. To the extent that the State Supreme Court based its decision on
claim or issue preclusion (res judicata or collateral estoppel), that decision is inconsistent with the Fourteenth Amendment's due process guarantee. Since Reynolds Metals and this case involve different plaintiffs

526US1 Unit: $U38 [01-03-01 13:14:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Syllabus
and tax years, neither is a class action, and no one claims there is privity
or some other special relationship between the two sets of plaintiffs, the
Bell plaintiffs are "strangers" to the earlier judgment and thus cannot
be bound by that judgment. Richards v. Jefferson County, 517 U. S.
793, 801-802. That the Bell plaintiffs were aware of the Reynolds Metals litigation and that one of the Reynolds Metals lawyers also represented the Bell plaintiffs created no special representational relationship between the earlier and later plaintiffs. Nor could these facts have
led the Bell plaintiffs to expect to be precluded, as a res judicata matter,
by the earlier judgment itself. Although the Bell plaintiffs, in a letter
to the trial court, specifically requested that their case be held in abeyance until Reynolds Metals was decided, the letter was no more than a
routine request for continuance and does not distinguish Richards.
Pp. 167-168.

3. The state franchise tax on foreign corporations impermissibly discriminates against interstate commerce, in violation of the Commerce
Clause. State law gives domestic corporations the ability to reduce
their franchise tax liability simply by reducing the par value of their
stock, while it denies foreign corporations that same ability. The State
cannot justify this discrimination on the ground that the tax is a complementary or compensatory tax that offsets the tax burden that the
domestic shares tax imposes upon domestic corporations, since the relevant tax burdens are not roughly approximate, nor are they similar

in substance. See, e. g., Oregon Waste Systems, Inc. v. Department
of Environmental Quality of Ore., 511 U. S. 93, 103. Alabama imposes its foreign franchise tax on a foreign firm's decision to do business
in the State; it imposes its domestic shares tax on a certain form of
property ownership, namely, shares in domestic corporations. The
State's invitation to reconsider and abandon the Court's negative Commerce Clause cases will not be entertained, as the State did not make
clear it intended to make this argument until it filed its brief on the
merits. Pp. 169-171.

Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.
The basic question in this case is whether the franchisetax Alabama assesses on foreign corporations violates the

Commerce Clause. We conclude that it does.

I
Alabama requires each corporation doing business in thatState to pay a franchise tax based upon the firm's capital.

A domestic firm, organized under the laws of Alabama, mustpay tax in an amount equal to 1% of the par value of the
firm's stock. Ala. Const., Art. XII, $ 229; Ala. Code $ 40-14-40 (1993); App. to Pet. for Cert. 50a, 52a, 61a (Stipulated
Facts). A foreign firm, organized under the laws of a Stateother than Alabama, must pay tax in an amount equal to
0.3% of the value of "the actual amount of capital employed"in Alabama. Ala. Const., Art. XII, $ 232; Ala. Code $ 40-14-
41(a) (Supp. 1998). Alabama law grants domestic firms con-siderable leeway in controlling their own tax base and tax
liability, as a firm may set its stock's par value at a levelwell below its book or market value. App. to Pet. for Cert.
52a-53a (Stipulated Facts). Alabama law does not grant aforeign firm similar leeway to control its tax base, however,
as the value of the "actual" capital upon which Alabama cal-culates the foreign franchise tax includes not only the value
of capital stock but also other accounting items (e. g., long-term debt, surplus), the value of which depends upon the

firm's financial status. Id., at 53a-54a; Ala. Code $$ 40-14-41(b)(1)-(5), (c) (Supp. 1998).

In 1986, the Reynolds Metals Company and three otherforeign corporations sued Alabama's tax authorities, seeking
a refund of the foreign franchise tax they had paid on the
ground that the tax discriminated against foreign corpora-tions. Although the tax favored foreign firms in some respects (granting them a lower tax rate and excluding anycapital not employed in Alabama), that favorable treatment
was more than offset by the fact that a domestic firm, unlikea foreign firm, could shrink its tax base significantly simply
by setting the par value of its stock at a low level. As a
result, Reynolds Metals said, the tax burden borne by foreign corporations was much higher than the burden on domestic corporations, and the tax consequently violated both
the Commerce and Equal Protection Clauses. U. S. Const.,
Art. I, $ 8, cl. 3, and Amdt. 14, $ 1.

The Alabama Supreme Court rejected these claims.
White v. Reynolds Metals Co., 558 So. 2d 373 (1989). Without denying that the franchise tax imposed a special burden
upon foreign corporations, the court nonetheless thought
that this special burden simply offset a different burden imposed exclusively upon domestic corporations by Alabama's
"domestic shares tax." This latter tax is a property tax on
shares of domestic stock; it is assessed against shareholders
based upon the value of the shares they hold, but in practice
it is normally paid by the corporation itself. Id., at 386-388
(citing, e. g., Gregg Dyeing Co. v. Query, 286 U. S. 472 (1932)
(permitting taxes that discriminate against interstate commerce when they compensate for burdens placed uniquely
upon domestic commerce)). Any remaining discrimination,
the court concluded, was constitutionally insignificant. 558
So. 2d, at 388-390.

While the Alabama courts were considering Reynolds
Metals, a different foreign corporation, South Central Bell
Telephone Company, brought the lawsuit now before us.

164 SOUTH CENTRAL BELL TELEPHONE CO. v. ALABAMA

Opinion of the Court
Bell asserted the same Commerce Clause and Equal Protec-tion Clause claims as had Reynolds Metals, though in respect

to different tax years. Bell initially agreed to hold its suit inabeyance pending the resolution of Reynolds Metals' claims.
Then, after the Alabama Supreme Court decided against the
taxpayers in Reynolds Metals, Bell ( joined by other foreigncorporations with similar claims) went to trial.

The Bell plaintiffs introduced evidence designed to showthat the empirical premises that underlay

Reynolds Metals
were wrong: Despite the differences in franchise tax rates,Alabama's franchise tax scheme in practice discriminates

substantially against foreign corporations, and the Alabama
tax on shares of domestic corporations does not offset the
discrimination in the franchise tax. The Alabama trial court
agreed with the Bell plaintiffs that their evidence, taken together with this Court's recent Commerce Clause cases,
"clearly and abundantly demonstrates that the franchise tax
on foreign corporations discriminates against them for no
other reason than the state of their incorporation." Memorandum Opinion in App. to Pet. for Cert. 21a-22a (hereinafter Mem. Op.) (citing Oregon Waste Systems, Inc. v. Department of Environmental Quality of Ore., 511 U. S. 93
(1994); Associated Industries of Mo. v. Lohman, 511 U. S.
641 (1994); Fulton Corp. v. Faulkner, 516 U. S. 325 (1996)).
But the trial court nonetheless dismissed their claims for a
different reason, namely, that given the Alabama Supreme
Court's decision in Reynolds Metals, "the Taxpayer[s']
claims [in this case] are barred by res judicata." Mem.
Op. 17a.

The Alabama Supreme Court affirmed the trial court by
a vote of 5 to 4. The majority's decision cited Reynolds
Metals and a procedural rule regarding summary dispositions and simply said, "PER CURIAM. AFFIRMED. NO
OPINION." 711 So. 2d 1005 (1998). One justice concurred
specially to say that by requesting that their case be held
in abeyance until Reynolds Metals was resolved, the Bell

Opinion of the Court
plaintiffs had agreed to be bound by Reynolds Metals. 711So. 2d, at 1005-1007 (opinion of Maddox, J.). Three dissenters wrote that given the differences between this case andReynolds Metals (e. g., different tax years, different plaintiffs), res judicata could not bind the Bell plaintiffs. 711 So.2d, at 1008 (opinion of See, J.). On the merits, the dissenters
concluded that the franchise tax violated the CommerceClause. See

id., at 1008-1011. (One other justice dissentedwithout opinion.)

We granted the Bell plaintiffs' petition for certiorari,agreeing to decide (1) whether the Alabama courts' refusal to
permit the Bell plaintiffs to raise their constitutional claimsbecause of res judicata "deprived" the Bell plaintiffs "of

the due process of law guaranteed by the FourteenthAmendment," Pet. for Cert. (i); see

Richards v. JeffersonCounty, 517 U. S. 793 (1996); and (2) whether the franchise

tax "impermissibly discriminates against interstate com-merce, in violation of the Commerce Clause," Pet. for Cert.
(i). We decide both questions in favor of the Bell plaintiffs.

II

A

At the outset, the respondents--the State of Alabama andits State Department of Revenue (collectively, the State)--

argue that this Court lacks "appellate jurisdiction over thiscase." Brief for Respondents 15. The State points to the
Eleventh Amendment, which provides:

"The Judicial power of the United States shall not beconstrued to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United Statesby Citizens of another State . . . ."

The State claims that this Amendment's literal language ap-plies here because this case began in state court as a suit
brought against one State, namely, Alabama, by citizens ofanother; because we, in hearing this case, would be exercis526US1 Unit: $U38 [01-03-01 13:14:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN
166 SOUTH CENTRAL BELL TELEPHONE CO. v. ALABAMA

Opinion of the Court
ing the "Judicial power of the United States"; and becauseAlabama has not waived its right to object to our exercise of

that power.This Court, however, has recently considered and rejected
the very argument that the State now makes. In McKesson
Corp. v. Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, Fla.
Dept. of Business Regulation, 496 U. S. 18 (1990), we unanimously held that "[t]he Eleventh Amendment does not con-strain the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court over

cases arising from state courts." Id., at 31. We explained:

"[I]t is `inherent in the constitutional plan' . . . that when
a state court takes cognizance of a case, the State as-sents to appellate review by this Court of the federal

issues raised in the case `whoever may be the parties tothe original suit, whether private persons, or the state
itself.' " Id., at 30 (quoting Principality of Monaco v.
Mississippi, 292 U. S. 313, 329 (1934); Proprietors of
Charles River Bridge v. Proprietors of Warren Bridge,
11 Pet. 420, 585 (1837) (Story, J., dissenting)).

Our holding in McKesson confirmed a long-established anduniform practice of reviewing state-court decisions on federal matters, regardless of whether the State was the plain-tiff or the defendant in the trial court. 496 U. S., at 28;
accord, General Oil Co. v. Crain, 209 U. S. 211, 233 (1908)
(Harlan, J., concurring) ("[I]t was long ago settled" that theEleventh Amendment does not bar "a writ of error to review

the final judgment of a state court").Although the State now asks us to "overrule

McKesson,"
Brief for Respondents 27, it does not provide a convincing
reason why we should revisit that relatively recent precedent, and we shall not do so. Cf. Planned Parenthood of
Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833, 854-855 (1992) (considerations relevant to overruling precedent include workability of prior precedent, its relation to other changes in
law, and relevant reliance).

Opinion of the Court

B
The State, in opposing Bell's petition for certiorari, arguedthat the Alabama Supreme Court's decision rested upon an

adequate state ground, namely, state-law principles of resjudicata. It now believes, however, that the Alabama Supreme Court's decision rejected the plaintiffs' claims on theirmerits and relied upon

Reynolds Metals under principles ofstare decisis, not res judicata. Brief for Respondents 3.

For that reason, the State "offer[s] no defense of the decisionas a valid application of the doctrine of

res judicata." Ibid.Nor do we believe a valid defense could be made. See Richards v. Jefferson County, supra.In Richards, we considered an Alabama Supreme Court
holding that state-law principles of res judicata preventedcertain taxpayers from bringing a case (which we will call
Case Two) to challenge on federal constitutional grounds astate tax that the Alabama Supreme Court had upheld in an
earlier case (Case One) brought by different taxpayers. Weheld that the Fourteenth Amendment forbade this "extreme"
application of state-law preclusion (res judicata) principles,
id., at 797, because the plaintiffs in Case Two were "strang-ers" to the earlier judgment, id., at 802.

We cannot distinguish Richards from the case before us.In

Richards, we pointed out that the taxpayers in Case One"did not sue on behalf of a class; their pleadings did not purport to assert any claim against or on behalf of any nonpar-ties; and the judgment they received did not purport to bind
any . . . taxpayers who were nonparties." Id., at 801. Weadded that the taxpayers in Case One did not understand
their suit "to be on behalf of " the different taxpayers in-volved in Case Two, nor did the Case One court make any
special effort "to protect the interests" of the Case Twoplaintiffs.

Id., at 802. As far as we are aware, the samecan be said of the circumstances now before us. The two

relevant cases involve different plaintiffs and different taxyears. Neither is a class action, and no one claims that there

526US1 Unit: $U38 [01-03-01 13:14:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN
168 SOUTH CENTRAL BELL TELEPHONE CO. v. ALABAMA

Opinion of the Court
is "privity" or some other special relationship between the
two sets of plaintiffs. Hence, the Case Two plaintiffs here
are "strangers" to Case One, and for the reasons we explained in Richards, they cannot be bound by the earlier
judgment.

The Alabama trial court tried to distinguish the circumstances before us from those in Richards by pointing out
that the plaintiffs here were aware of the earlier Reynolds
Metals litigation and that one of the Reynolds Metals lawyers also represented the Bell plaintiffs. See Mem. Op. 18a-
19a. These circumstances, however, created no special representational relationship between the earlier and later
plaintiffs. Nor could these facts have led the later plaintiffs
to expect to be precluded, as a matter of res judicata, by
the earlier judgment itself, even though they may well have
expected that the rule of law announced in Reynolds Metals
would bind them in the same way that a decided case binds
every citizen.

A concurring justice in the Alabama Supreme Court concluded that the Bell plaintiffs had "agreed that the final decision in Reynolds Metals would be controlling" when, in a
letter to the trial court, they "specifically requested that
[their] case be held in abeyance until Reynolds Metals was
decided." 711 So. 2d, at 1006-1007 (opinion of Maddox, J.).
That letter also said, however, that if " `either party desires
to proceed at a later date, with the Court's permission this
case would be activated.' " Id., at 1006. Given this latter
statement, the letter is no more than a routine request for
continuance. It does not distinguish Richards.

In sum, if the Alabama Supreme Court's holding in this
case rests on state-law claim or issue preclusion (res judicata
or collateral estoppel), that holding is inconsistent with Richards and with the Fourteenth Amendment's due process
guarantee.

Turning to the merits, we conclude that this Court's Com-merce Clause precedent requires us to hold Alabama's franchise tax unconstitutional. Alabama law defines a domesticcorporation's tax base as including only one item--the par
value of capital stock--which the corporation may set atwhatever level it chooses. A foreign corporation's tax base,
on the other hand, contains many additional balance sheetitems that are valued in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, rather than by arbitrary assignmentby the corporation. Accordingly, as the State has admitted,
Alabama law gives domestic corporations the ability to re-duce their franchise tax liability simply by reducing the par
value of their stock, while it denies foreign corporations thatsame ability. App. to Pet. for Cert. 52a-53a (Stipulated
Facts). And no one claims that the different tax rates forforeign and domestic corporations offset the difference in the
tax base. The tax therefore facially discriminates againstinterstate commerce and is unconstitutional unless the State
can offer a sufficient justification for it. Cf. Fulton Corp.v.

Faulkner, 516 U. S. 325 (1996) (state tax scheme requir-ing shareholders in out-of-state corporations to pay tax

on a higher percentage of share value than shareholders ofcorporations operating solely within the State facially
discriminated in violation of the Commerce Clause). Thisdiscrimination is borne out in practice, as the record, undisputed here, shows that the average domestic corporation
pays only one-fifth the franchise tax it would pay if it weretreated as a foreign corporation. See App. to Pet. for Cert.

36a (plaintiffs' statement of facts); Mem. Op. 21a, and n. 7
(adopting plaintiffs' statement of facts).The State cannot justify this discrimination on the ground

that the foreign franchise tax is a "complementary" or "com-pensatory" tax that offsets the tax burden that the domestic
shares tax imposes upon domestic corporations. E. g., Hen526US1 Unit: $U38 [01-03-01 13:14:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN
170 SOUTH CENTRAL BELL TELEPHONE CO. v. ALABAMA

Opinion of the Court
neford v. Silas Mason Co., 300 U. S. 577 (1937) (upholdinga facially discriminatory use tax as "complementary" to a

domestic sales tax). Our cases hold that a discriminatorytax cannot be upheld as "compensatory" unless the State
proves that the special burden that the franchise tax imposes
upon foreign corporations is "roughly . . . approximate"to the special burden on domestic corporations, and that the

taxes are similar enough "in substance" to serve as "mu-tually exclusive" proxies for one another.

Oregon Waste
Systems, 511 U. S., at 103; accord, Fulton, supra, at 332-333.In this case, however, the relevant tax burdens are

not
"roughly approximate." See App. to Pet. for Cert. 36a-37a
(plaintiffs' statement of facts, showing that the foreign franchise tax burden far exceeds the domestic franchise tax and
the domestic shares tax combined); Mem. Op. 21a, n. 7
(adopting plaintiffs' statement of facts); cf. 711 So. 2d, at 1011
(See, J., dissenting) (in the face of the State's "indefinite assertion," plaintiffs offered "substantial evidence . . . that the
foreign franchise tax exceeds any intrastate burden" imposed through the higher franchise tax rate and the domestic
shares tax). And the State has made no effort to persuade
this Court otherwise.

Nor are the two tax burdens similar in substance. Alabama imposes its foreign franchise tax upon a foreign firm's
decision to do business in the State; Alabama imposes its
domestic shares tax upon the ownership of a certain form of
property, namely, shares in domestic corporations. Compare Ala. Code $ 40-14-41 with $ 40-14-70 (1993 and Supp.
1998). No one has explained to us how the one could be seen
as a "proxy" for the other.

Rather than dispute any of these matters, the State instead says, with "respect to the merits," that "the flaw in
petitioners' claim lies not in the application to Alabama's corporate franchise tax of this Court's recent negative Commerce Clause cases; the flaw lies rather in the negative Commerce Clause cases themselves." Brief for Respondents 3.

The State adds that the Court should "formally reconsider"and "abando[n]" its negative Commerce Clause jurisprudence." Id., at 3, 28. We will not entertain this invitationto reconsider our longstanding negative Commerce Clause
doctrine, however, because the State did not make clear itintended to make this argument until it filed its brief on the
merits. We would normally expect notice of an intent tomake so far-reaching an argument in the respondent's opposition to a petition for certiorari, cf. this Court's Rule 15.2,thereby assuring adequate preparation time for those likely
affected and wishing to participate. We are not aware ofany convincing reason to depart from that practice in this
case. And consequently we shall not do so.For these reasons, the judgment of the Alabama Supreme
Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for further pro-ceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

I join the opinion of the Court, and I agree that the State'sfailure to properly raise its challenge to our negative Commerce Clause jurisprudence supports a decision not to passon the merits of this claim.

MINNESOTA et al. v. MILLE LACS BAND OFCHIPPEWA INDIANS

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eighth circuit

No. 97-1337. Argued December 2, 1998--Decided March 24, 1999
Pursuant to an 1837 Treaty, several Chippewa Bands ceded land in

present-day Minnesota and Wisconsin to the United States. The
United States, in turn, guaranteed to the Indians certain hunting, fishing, and gathering rights on the ceded land "during the pleasure of the
President of the United States." In an 1850 Executive Order, President Taylor ordered the Chippewa's removal from the ceded territory
and revoked their usufructuary rights. The United States ultimately
abandoned its removal policy, but its attempts to acquire Chippewa
lands continued. An 1855 Treaty set aside lands as reservations for the
Mille Lacs Band, but made no mention of, among other things, whether
it abolished rights guaranteed by previous treaties. Minnesota was admitted to the Union in 1858. In 1990, the Mille Lacs Band and several
members sued Minnesota, its Department of Natural Resources, and
state officials (collectively State), seeking, among other things, a declaratory judgment that they retained their usufructuary rights and an injunction to prevent the State's interference with those rights. The
United States and several counties and landowners intervened. In
later stages of the case, several Wisconsin Bands of Chippewa intervened and the District Court consolidated the Mille Lacs Band litigation
with the portion of another suit involving usufructuary rights under the
1837 Treaty. The District Court ultimately concluded that the Chippewa retained their usufructuary rights under the 1837 Treaty and resolved several resource allocation and regulation issues. The Eighth
Circuit affirmed. As relevant here, it rejected the State's argument
that the 1850 Executive Order abrogated the usufructuary rights guaranteed by the 1837 Treaty, concluded that the 1855 Treaty did not extinguish those privileges for the Mille Lacs Band, and rejected the State's
argument that, under the "equal footing doctrine," Minnesota's entrance
into the Union extinguished any Indian treaty rights.

Held: The Chippewa retain the usufructuary rights guaranteed to them

by the 1837 Treaty. Pp. 188-208.

(a) The 1850 Executive Order was ineffective to terminate Chippewa
usufructuary rights. The President's power to issue an Executive
Order must stem either from an Act of Congress or from the Constitu526US1 Unit: $U39 [12-13-00 19:23:21] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Syllabus
tion itself. Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579, 585.
The Court of Appeals concluded that the 1830 Removal Act did not
authorize the removal order, and no party challenges that conclusion
here. Even if the 1830 Removal Act did not forbid the removal order,
it did not authorize the order. There is no support for the landowners'
claim that the 1837 Treaty authorized the removal order. The Treaty
made no mention of removal, and the issue was not discussed during
treaty negotiations. The Treaty's silence is consistent with the United
States' objectives in negotiating the Treaty: the purchase of Chippewa
land. The State argues that, even if the order's removal portion was
invalid, the treaty privileges were nevertheless revoked because the
invalid removal order was severable from the portion of the order revoking usufructuary rights. Assuming, arguendo, that the severability
standard for statutes--whether the legislature would not have taken
the valid action independently of the invalid action, e. g., Champlin Refining Co. v. Corporation Comm'n of Okla., 286 U. S. 210, 234--also
applies to Executive Orders, the historical evidence indicates that President Taylor intended the 1850 order to stand or fall as a whole. That
order embodied a single, coherent policy, the primary purpose of which
was the Chippewa's removal. The revocation of usufructuary rights
was an integral part of this policy, for the order tells the Indians to "go"
and not to return to the ceded lands to hunt or fish. There is also little
historical evidence that the treaty privileges themselves--rather than
the Indians' presence--caused problems necessitating revocation of the
privileges. Pp. 188-195.

(b) The Mille Lacs Band did not relinquish its 1837 Treaty rights in
the 1855 Treaty by agreeing to "fully and entirely relinquish and convey
to the United States, any and all right, title, and interest, of whatsoever
nature the same may be, which they may now have in, and to any other
lands in the Territory of Minnesota or elsewhere." That sentence does
not mention the 1837 Treaty or hunting, fishing, and gathering rights.
In fact, the entire 1855 Treaty is devoid of any language expressly mentioning usufructuary rights or providing money for abrogation of those
rights. These are telling omissions, since federal treaty drafters had
the sophistication and experience to use express language when abrogating treaty rights. The historical record, purpose, and context of the
negotiations all support the conclusion that the 1855 Treaty was designed to transfer Chippewa land to the United States, not terminate
usufructuary rights. Oregon Dept. of Fish and Wildlife v. Klamath
Tribe, 473 U. S. 753, distinguished. Pp. 195-202.

(c) The Chippewa's usufructuary rights were not extinguished when
Minnesota was admitted to the Union. Congress must clearly express
an intent to abrogate Indian treaty rights, United States v. Dion, 476

U. S. 734, 738-740, and there is no clear evidence of such an intent here.
The State concedes that Minnesota's enabling Act is silent about treaty
rights and points to no legislative history describing the Act's effect on
such rights. The State's reliance on Ward v. Race Horse, 163 U. S. 504,
is misplaced. The Court's holding that a Treaty reserving to a Tribe
" `the right to hunt on the unoccupied lands of the United States, so long
as game may be found thereon, and so long as peace subsists among the
whites and Indians on the borders of the hunting districts' " terminated
when Wyoming became a State, id., at 507, has been qualified by this
Court's later decisions. The first part of the Race Horse holding--that
the treaty rights conflicted irreconcilably with state natural resources
regulation such that they could not survive Wyoming's admission to the
Union on an "equal footing" with the 13 original States--rested on a
false premise, for this Court has subsequently made clear that a tribe's
treaty rights to hunt, fish, and gather on state land can coexist with
state natural resources management, see, e. g., Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Assn., 443 U. S. 658.
Thus, statehood by itself is insufficient to extinguish such rights. Race
Horse's alternative holding--that the treaty rights at issue were not
intended to survive Wyoming's statehood--also does not help the State
here. There is no suggestion in the 1837 Treaty that the Senate intended the rights here to terminate when a State was established in the
area; there is no fixed termination point contemplated in that Treaty;
and treaty rights are not impliedly terminated at statehood, e. g., Wisconsin v. Hitchcock, 201 U. S. 202, 213-214. Pp. 202-208.

Opinion of the Court

anteed to the Indians certain hunting, fishing, and gathering
rights on the ceded land. We must decide whether the
Chippewa Indians retain these usufructuary rights today.
The State of Minnesota argues that the Indians lost these
rights through an Executive Order in 1850, an 1855 Treaty,
and the admission of Minnesota into the Union in 1858.
After an examination of the historical record, we conclude
that the Chippewa retain the usufructuary rights guaranteed to them under the 1837 Treaty.

I
A

In 1837, several Chippewa Bands, including the respondent Bands here, were summoned to Fort Snelling (near
present-day St. Paul, Minnesota) for the negotiation of a
treaty with the United States. The United States representative at the negotiations, Wisconsin Territorial Governor
Henry Dodge, told the assembled Indians that the United
States wanted to purchase certain Chippewa lands east of
the Mississippi River, lands located in present-day Wisconsin
and Minnesota. App. 46 (1837 Journal of Treaty Negotiations). The Chippewa agreed to sell the land to the United
States, but they insisted on preserving their right to hunt,
fish, and gather in the ceded territory. See, e. g., id., at 70,
75-76. In response to this request, Governor Dodge stated
that he would "make known to your Great Father, your request to be permitted to make sugar, on the lands; and you
will be allowed, during his pleasure, to hunt and fish on
them." Id., at 78. To these ends, the parties signed a
treaty on July 29, 1837. In the first two articles of the 1837
Treaty, the Chippewa ceded land to the United States in return for 20 annual payments of money and goods. The
United States also, in the fifth article of the Treaty, guaranteed to the Chippewa the right to hunt, fish, and gather on
the ceded lands:

Opinion of the Court
"The privilege of hunting, fishing, and gathering
the wild rice, upon the lands, the rivers and the lakes
included in the territory ceded, is guarantied [sic] to
the Indians, during the pleasure of the President of

the United States." 1837 Treaty with the Chippewa,
7 Stat. 537.

In 1842, many of the same Chippewa Bands entered into another Treaty with the United States, again ceding additional
lands to the Federal Government in return for annuity payments of goods and money, while reserving usufructuary
rights on the ceded lands. 1842 Treaty with the Chippewa,
7 Stat. 591. This Treaty, however, also contained a provision providing that the Indians would be "subject to removal
therefrom at the pleasure of the President of the United
States." Art. 6, id., at 592.

In the late 1840's, pressure mounted to remove the Chippewa to their unceded lands in the Minnesota Territory. On
September 4, 1849, Minnesota Territorial Governor Alexander Ramsey urged the Territorial Legislature to ask the
President to remove the Chippewa from the ceded land.
App. 878 (Report and Direct Testimony of Dr. Bruce M.
White) (hereinafter White Report). The Territorial Legislature complied by passing, in October 1849, "Joint Resolutions relative to the removal of the Chippewa Indians from
the ceded lands within the Territory of Minnesota." App. to
Pet. for Cert. 567 (hereinafter Joint Resolution). The Joint
Resolution urged:

"[T]o ensure the security and tranquility of the white
settlements in an extensive and valuable district of this
Territory, the Chippewa Indians should be removed
from all lands within the Territory to which the Indian
Title has been extinguished, and that the privileges
given to them by Article Fifth [of the 1837 Treaty] and
Article Second [of the 1842 Treaty] be revoked." Ibid.

178 MINNESOTA v. MILLE LACS BAND OF

CHIPPEWA INDIANS

Opinion of the Court

The Territorial Legislature directed its resolution to Con-gress, but it eventually made its way to President Zachary

Taylor. App. 674 (Report and Direct Testimony of Profes-sor Charles E. Cleland) (hereinafter Cleland Report). It is
unclear why the Territorial Legislature directed this resolution to Congress and not to the President. One possible ex-planation is that, although the 1842 Treaty gave the President authority to remove the Chippewa from that land area,see 1842 Treaty with the Chippewa, Art. 6, 7 Stat. 592, the
1837 Treaty did not confer such authority on the President.Therefore, any action to remove the Chippewa from the 1837
ceded lands would require congressional approval. See
App. 674 (Cleland Report).

The historical record provides some clues into the impetus
behind this push to remove the Chippewa. In his statement
to the Territorial Legislature, Governor Ramsey asserted
that the Chippewa needed to be removed because the white
settlers in the Sauk Rapids and Swan River area were complaining about the privileges given to the Chippewa Indians.
Id., at 878 (White Report). Similarly, the Territorial Legislature urged removal of the Chippewa "to ensure the security and tranquility of the white settlements" in the area.
App. to Pet. for Cert. 567 (Joint Resolution). The historical
evidence suggests, however, that the white settlers were
complaining about the Winnebago Indians, not the Chippewa, in the Sauk Rapids area. See App. 671-672 (Cleland
Report). There is also evidence that Minnesotans wanted
Indians moved from Wisconsin and Michigan to Minnesota
because a large Indian presence brought economic benefits
with it. Specifically, an Indian presence provided opportunities to trade with Indians in exchange for their annuity

payments, and to build and operate Indian agencies, schools,
and farms in exchange for money. The presence of these
facilities in an area also opened opportunities for patronage
jobs to staff these facilities. See id., at 668-671; id., at 1095
(White Report). See also id., at 149-150 (letter from Rice

Opinion of the Court
to Ramsey, Dec. 1, 1849) ("Minnesota would reap the benefit[from the Chippewa's removal]--whereas now their annuities

pass via Detroit and not one dollar do our inhabitants get").The District Court concluded in this case that "Minnesota
politicians, including Ramsey, advocated removal of the Wisconsin Chippewa to Minnesota because they wanted to ob-tain more of the economic benefits generated by having a

large number of Indians residing in their territory." 861F. Supp. 784, 803 (Minn. 1994).

Whatever the impetus behind the removal effort, Presi-dent Taylor responded to this pressure by issuing an Executive Order on February 6, 1850. The order provided:

"The privileges granted temporarily to the Chippewa
Indians of the Mississippi, by the Fifth Article of theTreaty made with them on the 29th of July 1837, `of

hunting, fishing and gathering the wild rice, upon thelands, the rivers and the lakes included in the territory
ceded' by that treaty to the United States; and the right
granted to the Chippewa Indians of the Mississippi andLake Superior, by the Second Article of the treaty with

them of October 4th 1842, of hunting on the territorywhich they ceded by that treaty, `with the other usual
privileges of occupancy until required to remove by thePresident of the United States,' are hereby revoked; and
all of the said Indians remaining on the lands ceded asaforesaid, are required to remove to their unceded
lands." App. to Pet. for Cert. 565.
The officials charged with implementing this order understood it primarily as a removal order, and they proceeded to
implement it accordingly. See Record, Doc. No. 311, Plaintiffs' Exh. 88 (letter from Brown to Ramsey, Feb. 6, 1850);
App. 161 (letter from Ramsey to Livermore, Mar. 4, 1850).

180 MINNESOTA v. MILLE LACS BAND OF

CHIPPEWA INDIANS

Opinion of the Court

1101-1102 (White Report) (describing circular and statingthat "the entire thrust" of the circular had to do with

removal).The Government hoped to entice the Chippewa to remove
to Minnesota by changing the location where the annuity
payments--the payments for the land cessions--would bemade. The Chippewa were to be told that their annuity

payments would no longer be made at La Pointe, Wisconsin(within the Chippewa's ceded lands), but, rather, would be
made at Sandy Lake, on unceded lands, in the MinnesotaTerritory. The Government's first annuity payment under
this plan, however, ended in disaster. The Chippewa were
told they had to be at Sandy Lake by October 25 to receive
their 1850 annuity payment. See B. White, The Regional
Context of the Removal Order of 1850, $ 6, pp. 6-9 to 6-10
(Mar. 1994). By November 10, almost 4,000 Chippewa had
assembled at Sandy Lake to receive the payment, but the
annuity goods were not completely distributed until December 2. Id., at 6-10. In the meantime, around 150 Chippewa
died in an outbreak of measles and dysentery; another 230
Chippewas died on the winter trip home to Wisconsin. App.
228-229 (letter from Buffalo to Lea, Nov. 6, 1851).

The Sandy Lake annuity experience intensified opposition
to the removal order among the Chippewa as well as among
non-Indian residents of the area. See id., at 206-207 (letter
from Warren to Ramsey, Jan. 21, 1851); id., at 214 (letter
from Lea to Stuart, June 3, 1851) (describing opposition to
the order). See also Record, Doc. No. 311, Plaintiffs' Exh.
93 (Michigan and Wisconsin citizens voice their objections to
the order to the President). In the face of this opposition,
Commissioner of Indian Affairs Luke Lea wrote to the Secretary of the Interior recommending that the President's
1850 order be modified to allow the Chippewa "to remain for
the present in the country they now occupy." App. 215 (letter from Lea to Stuart, June 3, 1851). According to Commissioner Lea, removal of the Wisconsin Bands "is not re526US1 Unit: $U39 [12-13-00 19:23:21] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
quired by the interests of the citizens or Government of theUnited States and would in its consequences in all probability be disastrous to the Indians." Ibid. Three monthslater, the Acting Commissioner of Indian Affairs wrote to
the Secretary to inform him that 1,000 Chippewa were assembled at La Pointe, but that they could not be removedfrom the area without the use of force. He sought the Secretary's approval "to suspend the removal of these Indiansuntil the determination of the President upon the recommendation of the commissioner is made known to this office."
Id., at 223-224 (letter from Mix to Graham, Aug. 23, 1851).
Two days later, the Secretary of the Interior issued the requested authorization, instructing the Commissioner "to suspend the removal of the Chippeway [sic] Indians until the
final determination of the President." Id., at 225 (letter
from Abraham to Lea, Aug. 25, 1851). Commissioner Lea
immediately telegraphed the local officials with instructions
to "[s]uspend action with reference to the removal of Lake
Superior Chippewas for further orders." Ibid. (telegram
from Lea to Watrous, Aug. 25, 1851). As the State's own
expert historian testified, "[f]ederal efforts to remove the
Lake Superior Chippewa to the Mississippi River effectively
ended in the summer of 1851." Id., at 986 (Report of Alan
S. Newell).

Although Governor Ramsey still hoped to entice the Chippewa to remove by limiting annuity payments to only those
Indians who removed to unceded lands, see id., at 235-236
(letter from Ramsey to Lea, Dec. 26, 1851), this plan, too,
was quickly abandoned. In 1853, Franklin Pierce became
President, and he appointed George Manypenny as Commissioner of Indian Affairs. The new administration reversed
Governor Ramsey's policy, and in 1853, annuity payments
were once again made within the ceded territory. See, e. g.,
Record, Doc. No. 311, Plaintiffs' Exh. 119, p. 2 (letter from
Gorman to Manypenny, Oct. 8, 1853); Plaintiffs' Exh. 122 (letter from Herriman to Gorman, Nov. 10, 1853); see also Plain526US1 Unit: $U39 [12-13-00 19:23:21] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tiffs' Exh. 120 (letter from Wheeler to Parents, Oct. 20, 1853).As Indian Agent Henry Gilbert explained, the earlier

"change from La Pointe to [Sandy Lake] was only an incidentof the order for removal," thus suggesting that the resumption of the payments at La Pointe was appropriate because
the 1850 removal order had been abandoned. App. 243 (let-ter from Gilbert to Manypenny, Dec. 14, 1853).

In 1849, white lumbermen built a dam on the Rum River(within the Minnesota portion of the 1837 ceded Territory),
and the Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa protested that the daminterfered with its wild rice harvest. This dispute erupted
in 1855 when violence broke out between the Chippewa and
the lumbermen, necessitating a call for federal troops. In
February 1855, the Governor of the Minnesota Territory,
Willis Gorman, who also served as the ex officio superintendent of Indian affairs for the Territory, wrote to Commissioner
Manypenny about this dispute. In his letter, he noted that
"[t]he lands occupied by the timbermen have been surveyed
and sold by the United States and the Indians have no other
treaty interests except hunting and fishing." Id., at 295-
296 (letter of Feb. 16, 1855) (emphasis added). There is no
indication that Commissioner Manypenny disagreed with
Governor Gorman's characterization of Chippewa treaty
rights. In June of the same year, Governor Gorman wrote
to Mille Lacs Chief Little Hill that even if the dam was located within the Mille Lacs Reservation under the 1855
Treaty, the dam "was put there long before you had any
rights there except to hunt and fish." Record, Doc. No. 163,
Plaintiffs' Exh. 19 (letter of June 4, 1855). Thus, as of 1855,
the federal official responsible for Indian affairs in the Minnesota Territory acknowledged and recognized Chippewa
rights to hunt and fish in the 1837 ceded Territory.

On the other hand, there are statements by federal officials
in the late 19th century and the first half of the 20th century
that suggest that the Federal Government no longer recognized Chippewa usufructuary rights under the 1837 Treaty.

Brief for United States in United States v. Thomas, O. T.1893, No. 668, pp. 2-3 (with respect to the 1842 Treaty, arguing that no Executive Order requiring Chippewa removal
had ever been made).

Although the United States abandoned its removal policy,
it did not abandon its attempts to acquire more Chippewa
land. To this end, in the spring of 1854, Congress began
considering legislation to authorize additional treaties for the
purchase of Chippewa lands. The House of Representatives
debated a bill "to provide for the extinguishment of the title
of the Chippewa Indians to the lands owned and claimed by
them in the Territory of Minnesota and State of Wisconsin."
Cong. Globe, 33d Cong., 1st Sess., 1032 (1854). This bill did
not require the removal of the Indians, but instead provided
for the establishment of reservations within the ceded territories on which the Indians could remain.

The treaty authorization bill stalled in the Senate during
1854, but Commissioner of Indian Affairs George Manypenny
began to implement it nonetheless. On August 11, he instructed Indian Agent Henry Gilbert to begin treaty negotiations to acquire more land from the Chippewa. Specifically, he instructed Gilbert to acquire "all the country" the
Chippewa own or claim in the Minnesota Territory and the
State of Wisconsin, except for some land that would be set
aside for reservations. App. 264. Gilbert negotiated such
a Treaty with several Chippewa Bands, 1854 Treaty with the
Chippewa, 10 Stat. 1109, although for reasons now lost to

history, the Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa was not a party tothis Treaty. The signatory Chippewa Bands ceded additional land to the United States, and certain lands were setaside as reservations for the Bands.

Id., Art. 2. In addition, the 1854 Treaty established new hunting and fishing
rights in the territory ceded by the Treaty. Id., Art. 11.When the Senate finally passed the authorizing legislation

in December 1854, Minnesota's territorial delegate to Con-gress recommended to Commissioner Manypenny that he
negotiate a treaty with the Mississippi, Pillager, and LakeWinnibigoshish Bands of Chippewa Indians. App. 286-287
(letter from Rice to Manypenny, Dec. 17, 1854). Commis-sioner Manypenny summoned representatives of those
Bands to Washington, D. C., for the treaty negotiations,
which were held in February 1855. See id., at 288 (letterfrom Manypenny to Gorman, Jan. 4, 1855). The purpose and

result of these negotiations was the sale of Chippewa landsto the United States. To this end, the first article of the
1855 Treaty contains two sentences:

"The Mississippi, Pillager, and Lake Winnibigoshish
bands of Chippewa Indians hereby cede, sell, and conveyto the United States all their right, title, and interest in,

and to, the lands now owned and claimed by them, in theTerritory of Minnesota, and included within the following boundaries, viz: [describing territorial boundaries].And the said Indians do further fully and entirely relinquish and convey to the United States, any and all right,
title, and interest, of whatsoever nature the same maybe, which they may now have in, and to any other lands

in the Territory of Minnesota or elsewhere." 10 Stat.
1165-1166.

Article 2 set aside lands in the area as reservations for the
signatory tribes. Id., at 1166-1167. The Treaty, however,
makes no mention of hunting and fishing rights, whether to
reserve new usufructuary rights or to abolish rights guaran526US1 Unit: $U39 [12-13-00 19:23:21] PAGES PGT: OPIN

A little over three years after the 1855 Treaty was signed,Minnesota was admitted to the Union. See Act of May 11,
1858, 11 Stat. 285. The admission Act is silent with respectto Indian treaty rights.

In 1990, the Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians and sev-eral of its members filed suit in the Federal District Court

for the District of Minnesota against the State of Minnesota,the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, and various state officers (collectively State), seeking, among otherthings, a declaratory judgment that they retained their usufructuary rights under the 1837 Treaty and an injunctionto prevent the State's interference with those rights. The
United States intervened as a plaintiff in the suit; nine coun-ties and six private landowners intervened as defendants.

The District Court bifurcated the case into two phases.Phase I of the litigation would determine whether, and to

what extent, the Mille Lacs Band retained any usufructuaryrights under the 1837 Treaty, while Phase II would determine the validity of particular state measures regulating anyretained rights.

In the first decision on the Phase I issues, the DistrictCourt rejected numerous defenses posed by the defendants
and set the matter for trial. 853 F. Supp. 1118 (Minn. 1994)(Murphy, C. J.). After a bench trial on the Phase I issues,
the District Court concluded that the Mille Lacs Band re-tained its usufructuary rights as guaranteed by the 1837
Treaty. 861 F. Supp. 784 (1994). Specifically, as relevant

186 MINNESOTA v. MILLE LACS BAND OF

CHIPPEWA INDIANS

Opinion of the Court

here, the court rejected the State's arguments that the 1837Treaty rights were extinguished by the 1850 Executive

Order or by the 1855 Treaty with the Chippewa. Id., at822-835. With respect to the 1850 Executive Order, the
District Court held, in relevant part, that the order was un-lawful because the President had no authority to order removal of the Chippewa without their consent. Id., at 823-826. The District Court also concluded that the United
States ultimately abandoned and repealed the removal policyembodied in the 1850 order.

Id., at 829-830. With respectto the 1855 Treaty, the District Court reviewed the historical

record and found that the parties to that agreement did notintend to abrogate the usufructuary privileges guaranteed
by the 1837 Treaty. Id., at 830-835.At this point in the case, the District Court permitted several Wisconsin Bands of Chippewa to intervene as plaintiffs 2and allowed the defendants to interpose new defenses. As
is relevant here, the defendants asserted for the first timethat the Bands' usufructuary rights were extinguished by
Minnesota's admission to the Union in 1858. The DistrictCourt rejected this new defense. No. 3-94-1226 (D. Minn.,
Mar. 29, 1996) (Davis, J.), App. to Pet. for Cert. 182-189.Simultaneously with this litigation, the Fond du Lac Band
of Chippewa Indians and several of its members filed a sepa-rate suit against Minnesota state officials, seeking a declaration that they retained their rights to hunt, fish, and gatherpursuant to the 1837 and 1854 Treaties. Two Minnesota
landowners intervened as defendants,3 and the District

Opinion of the Court
Court issued an order, like the order in the Mille Lacs Bandcase, bifurcating the litigation into two phases. In March

1996, the District Court held that the Fond du Lac Bandretained its hunting and fishing rights. Fond du Lac Band
of Chippewa Indians v. Carlson, Civ. No. 5-92-159 (D. Minn.,Mar. 18, 1996) (Kyle, J.), App. to Pet. for Cert. 419.

In June 1996, the District Court consolidated that part ofthe Fond du Lac litigation concerning the 1837 Treaty rights
with the Mille Lacs litigation for Phase II. In Phase II, theState and the Bands agreed to a Conservation Code and
Management Plan to regulate hunting, fishing, and gatheringin the Minnesota portion of the territory ceded in the 1837
Treaty. Even after this agreement, however, several re-source allocation and regulation issues remained unresolved;
the District Court resolved these issues in a final order is-sued in 1997. See 952 F. Supp. 1362 (Minn.) (Davis, J.).

On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuitaffirmed. 124 F. 3d 904 (1997). Three parts of the Eighth
Circuit's decision are relevant here. First, the Eighth Cir-cuit rejected the State's argument that President Taylor's
1850 Executive Order abrogated the Indians' hunting, fish-ing, and gathering rights as guaranteed by the 1837 Treaty.
The Court of Appeals concluded that President Taylor didnot have the authority to issue the removal order and that
the invalid removal order was inseverable from the portionof the order purporting to abrogate Chippewa usufructuary
rights. Id., at 914-918.Second, the Court of Appeals concluded that the 1855
Treaty did not extinguish the Mille Lacs Band's usufructuaryprivileges. Id., at 919-921. The court noted that the revocation of hunting and fishing rights was neither discussedduring the Treaty negotiations nor mentioned in the Treaty
itself. Id., at 920. The court also rejected the State's argu-ment that this Court's decision in

188 MINNESOTA v. MILLE LACS BAND OF

CHIPPEWA INDIANS

Opinion of the Court

Wildlife v. Klamath Tribe, 473 U. S. 753 (1985), required a
different result. 124 F. 3d, at 921. Third, the court rejected the State's argument that, under the "equal footing
doctrine," Minnesota's entrance into the Union extinguished
any Indian treaty rights. Id., at 926-929. Specifically, the
Court of Appeals found no evidence of congressional intent in
enacting the Minnesota statehood Act to abrogate Chippewa
usufructuary rights, id., at 929, and it rejected the argument
that Ward v. Race Horse, 163 U. S. 504 (1896), controlled the
resolution of this issue, 124 F. 3d, at 926-927.

In sum, the Court of Appeals held that the Chippewa retained their usufructuary rights under the 1837 Treaty with
respect to land located in the State of Minnesota. This conclusion is consistent with the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit's earlier decision holding that the Chippewa retained those same rights with respect to the ceded land
located in Wisconsin. Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake
Superior Chippewa Indians v. Voigt, 700 F. 2d 341, appeal
dism'd and cert. denied sub nom. Besadny v. Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians, 464 U. S.
805 (1983) (Brennan, Marshall, and Stevens, JJ., would affirm). The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit denied
a petition for rehearing and a suggestion for rehearing en
banc. The State of Minnesota, the landowners, and the
counties all filed petitions for writs of certiorari, and we
granted the State's petition. 524 U. S. 915 (1998).

II
We are first asked to decide whether President Taylor's
Executive Order of February 6, 1850, terminated Chippewa
hunting, fishing, and gathering rights under the 1837 Treaty.
The Court of Appeals began its analysis of this question with
a statement of black letter law: " `The President's power, if
any, to issue the order must stem either from an act of Con526US1 Unit: $U39 [12-13-00 19:23:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN

189Cite as: 526 U. S. 172 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
gress or from the Constitution itself.' " 124 F. 3d, at 915
(quoting Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S.
579, 585 (1952)). The court considered whether the President had authority to issue the removal order under the 1830
Removal Act (hereinafter Removal Act), 4 Stat. 411. The
Removal Act authorized the President to convey land west
of the Mississippi to Indian tribes that chose to "exchange
the lands where they now reside, and remove there." Id.,
at 412. According to the Court of Appeals, the Removal Act
only allowed the removal of Indians who had consented to
removal. 124 F. 3d, at 915-916. Because the Chippewa had
not consented to removal, according to the court, the Removal Act could not provide authority for the President's
1850 removal order. Id., at 916-917.

In this Court, no party challenges the Court of Appeals'
conclusion that the Removal Act did not authorize the President's removal order. The landowners argue that the Removal Act was irrelevant because it applied only to land exchanges, and that even if it required consent for such land
exchanges, it did not prohibit other means of removing Indians. See Brief for Respondent Thompson et al. 22-23. We
agree that the Removal Act did not forbid the President's
removal order, but as noted by the Court of Appeals, it also
did not authorize that order.

Because the Removal Act did not authorize the 1850 removal order, we must look elsewhere for a constitutional or
statutory authorization for the order. In this Court, only
the landowners argue for an alternative source of authority;
they argue that the President's removal order was authorized by the 1837 Treaty itself. See ibid. There is no support for this proposition, however. The Treaty makes no
mention of removal, and there was no discussion of removal
during the Treaty negotiations. Although the United
States could have negotiated a treaty in 1837 providing for
removal of the Chippewa--and it negotiated several such re526US1 Unit: $U39 [12-13-00 19:23:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN
190 MINNESOTA v. MILLE LACS BAND OF

CHIPPEWA INDIANS

Opinion of the Court

moval treaties with Indian tribes in 1837 4--the 1837 Treatywith the Chippewa did not contain any provisions authorizing a removal order. The silence in the Treaty, in fact, isconsistent with the United States' objectives in negotiating
it. Commissioner of Indian Affairs Harris explained theUnited States' goals for the 1837 Treaty in a letter to Governor Dodge on May 13, 1837. App. 42. In this letter, Harrisexplained that through this Treaty, the United States
wanted to purchase Chippewa land for the pinewoods locatedon it; the letter contains no reference to removal of the Chippewa. Ibid. Based on the record before us, the propositionthat the 1837 Treaty authorized the President's 1850 removal
order is unfounded. Because the parties have pointed to nocolorable source of authority for the President's removal
order, we agree with the Court of Appeals' conclusion thatthe 1850 removal order was unauthorized.

The State argues that even if the removal portion of theorder was invalid, the 1837 Treaty privileges were nevertheless revoked because the invalid removal order was sev-erable from the portion of the order revoking Chippewa

4 See 1837 Treaty with the Saganaw Chippewa, Art. 6, 7 Stat. 530 ("The

location can be obtained"); 1837 Treaty with the Potawatomie, Art. 1, 7
Stat. 533 ("And the chiefs and head men above named, for themselves and

the said Indians may hunt upon the western part of said neutral ground
until they shall procure a permanent settlement").

Opinion of the Court
usufructuary rights. Although this Court has often consid-ered the severability of

statutes, we have never addressed
whether Executive Orders can be severed into valid andinvalid parts, and if so, what standard should govern the

inquiry. In this case, the Court of Appeals assumed that
Executive Orders are severable, and that the standards ap-plicable in statutory cases apply without modification in the

context of Executive Orders. 124 F. 3d, at 917 (citing In re
Reyes, 910 F. 2d 611, 613 (CA9 1990)). Because no party
before this Court challenges the applicability of these stand-ards, for purposes of this case we shall assume,

arguendo,
that the severability standard for statutes also applies to
Executive Orders.

The inquiry into whether a statute is severable is essentially an inquiry into legislative intent. Regan v. Time, Inc.,
468 U. S. 641, 653 (1984) (plurality opinion). We stated the
traditional test for severability over 65 years ago: "Unless it
is evident that the legislature would not have enacted those
provisions which are within its power, independently of that
which is not, the invalid part may be dropped if what is left
is fully operative as a law." Champlin Refining Co. v. Corporation Comm'n of Okla., 286 U. S. 210, 234 (1932). See
also Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock, 480 U. S. 678, 684 (1987);
Regan v. Time, Inc., supra, at 653. Translated to the present context, we must determine whether the President
would not have revoked the 1837 Treaty privileges if he
could not issue the removal order.

We think it is clear that President Taylor intended the
1850 order to stand or fall as a whole. The 1850 order embodied a single, coherent policy, the predominant purpose of
which was removal of the Chippewa from the lands that they
had ceded to the United States. The federal officials
charged with implementing the order certainly understood
it as such. As soon as the Commissioner of Indian Affairs
received a copy of the order, he sent it to Governor Ramsey
and placed him in charge of its implementation. The Com526US1 Unit: $U39 [12-13-00 19:23:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN

CHIPPEWA INDIANS

Opinion of the Court

missioner's letter to Ramsey noted in passing that the orderrevoked the Chippewa's usufructuary privileges, but it did

not discuss implementation of that part of the order.Rather, the letter addressed the mechanics of implementing
the removal order. Record, Doc. No. 311, Plaintiffs' Exh.
88 (letter from Brown to Ramsey, Feb. 6, 1850). GovernorRamsey immediately wrote to his subagent at La Pointe (on

Lake Superior), noting that he had enclosed a "copy of theorder of the President

for the removal of the Chippewas,
from the lands they have ceded." App. 161 (letter fromRamsey to Livermore, Mar. 4, 1850) (emphasis added). This

letter made no mention of the revocation of Indian hunting
and fishing rights. Id., at 161-163. The La Pointe subagent, in turn, prepared a circular to notify the Wisconsin
Bands of the Executive Order, but this circular, too, focused
on removal of the Chippewa. See 861 F. Supp., at 805 (describing circular).

When the 1850 order is understood as announcing a removal policy, the portion of the order revoking Chippewa
usufructuary rights is seen to perform an integral function
in this policy. The order tells the Indians to "go," and also
tells them not to return to the ceded lands to hunt and fish.
The State suggests that President Taylor might also have
revoked Chippewa usufructuary rights as a kind of "incentive program" to encourage the Indians to remove had he
known that he could not order their removal directly. The
State points to no evidence, however, that the President or
his aides ever considered the abrogation of hunting and fishing rights as an "incentive program." Moreover, the State
does not explain how this incentive was to operate. As the
State characterizes Chippewa Treaty rights, the revocation
of those rights would not have prevented the Chippewa from
hunting, fishing, and gathering on the ceded territory; the
revocation of treaty rights would merely have subjected
Chippewa hunters, fishers, and gatherers to territorial, and,
later, state regulation. Brief for Petitioners 47, n. 21. The

526US1 Unit: $U39 [12-13-00 19:23:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN

193Cite as: 526 U. S. 172 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
State does not explain how, if the Chippewa were still per-mitted to hunt, fish, and gather on the ceded territory, the

revocation of the treaty rights would have encouraged theChippewa to remove to their unceded lands.

There is also no evidence that the treaty privileges themselves--as opposed to the presence of the Indians--causedany problems necessitating the revocation of those privileges. In other words, there is little historical evidence thatthe treaty privileges would have been revoked for some
other purpose. The only evidence in this regard is GovernorRamsey's statement to the Minnesota Territorial Legislature
that settlers in the Sauk Rapids and Swan River area were
complaining about the Chippewa Treaty privileges. But the
historical record suggests that the settlers were complaining
about the Winnebago Indians, and not the Chippewa, in that
area. See App. 671-672 (Cleland Report). When Governor
Ramsey was put in charge of enforcing the 1850 Executive
Order, he made no efforts to remove the Chippewa from
the Sauk Rapids area or to restrict hunting and fishing privileges there. In fact, his attempts to enforce the order
consisted primarily of efforts to move the Chippewa from
the Wisconsin and Michigan areas to Minnesota--closer to
the Sauk Rapids and Swan River settlements. App. 1099-
1100 (White Report); id., at 677-678, 1025-1027 (Cleland Report). More importantly, Governor Ramsey and the Minnesota Territorial Legislature explicitly tied revocation of the
treaty privileges to removal. Common sense explains the
logic of this strategy: If the legislature was concerned with
ensuring "the security and tranquility of the white settlements," App. to Pet. for Cert. 567 (Joint Resolution), this
concern was not addressed by merely revoking Indian treaty
rights; the Indians had to be removed.

We conclude that President Taylor's 1850 Executive Order
was ineffective to terminate Chippewa usufructuary rights
under the 1837 Treaty. The State has pointed to no statutory or constitutional authority for the President's removal

Opinion of the Court

order, and the Executive Order, embodying as it did one
coherent policy, is inseverable.5 We do not mean to suggest that a President, now or in the future, cannot revoke

5 The Chief Justice disagrees with this conclusion primarily because
he understands the removal order to be a mechanism for enforcing the
revocation of usufructuary rights. Post, at 213-214 (dissenting opinion).
The implicit premise of this argument is that the President had the inherent power to order the removal of the Chippewa from public lands; this
premise is flawed. The Chippewa were on the land long before the United
States acquired title to it. The 1837 Treaty does not speak to the right
of the United States to order them off the land upon acquisition of title,
and in fact, the usufructuary rights guaranteed by the Treaty presumed
that the Chippewa would continue to be on the land. Although the revocation of the rights might have justified measures to make sure that
the Chippewa were not hunting, fishing, or gathering, it does not follow
that revocation of the usufructuary rights permitted the United States to
remove the Chippewa from the land completely. The Chief Justice's
suggestion that the removal order was merely a measure to enforce the
revocation of the usufructuary rights is thus unwarranted. It cannot
be presumed that the ends justified the means; it cannot be presumed
that the rights of the United States under the Treaty included the right
to order removal in defense of the revocation of usufructuary rights. The
Treaty, the statutory law, and the Constitution were silent on this matter,
and to presume the existence of such Presidential power would run counter to the principles that treaties are to be interpreted liberally in favor
of the Indians, Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger
Fishing Vessel Assn., 443 U. S. 658, 675-676 (1979), and treaty ambiguities
to be resolved in their favor, Winters v. United States, 207 U. S. 564, 576-
577 (1908).

The Chief Justice also argues that the removal order ought to be
severable from the part of the order purporting to extinguish Chippewa
usufructuary rights because of the strong presumption supporting the
legality of executive action that has been authorized expressly or by implication. Post, at 215-216. Presumably, The Chief Justice understands the 1837 Treaty to authorize the executive action in question. In
this context, however, any general presumption about the legality of executive action runs into the principle that treaty ambiguities are to be resolved in favor of the Indians. Winters v. United States, supra, at 576-
577; see also County of Yakima v. Confederated Tribes and Bands of
Yakima Nation, 502 U. S. 251, 269 (1992). We do not think the general
presumption relied upon by The Chief Justice carries the same weight
when balanced against the counterpresumption specific to Indian treaties.

Opinion of the Court
Chippewa usufructuary rights in accordance with the terms
of the 1837 Treaty. All we conclude today is that the President's 1850 Executive Order was insufficient to accomplish
this revocation because it was not severable from the invalid
removal order.

III

The State argues that the Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa
Indians relinquished its usufructuary rights under the 1855
Treaty with the Chippewa. Specifically, the State argues
that the Band unambiguously relinquished its usufructuary
rights by agreeing to the second sentence of Article 1 in
that Treaty:

"And the said Indians do further fully and entirely relinquish and convey to the United States, any and all right,
title, and interest, of whatsoever nature the same may
be, which they may now have in, and to any other lands
in the Territory of Minnesota or elsewhere." 10 Stat.
1166.

This sentence, however, does not mention the 1837 Treaty,
and it does not mention hunting, fishing, and gathering
rights. The entire 1855 Treaty, in fact, is devoid of any language expressly mentioning--much less abrogating--usufructuary rights. Similarly, the Treaty contains no language providing money for the abrogation of previously held
rights. These omissions are telling because the United
States treaty drafters had the sophistication and experience
to use express language for the abrogation of treaty rights.
In fact, just a few months after Commissioner Manypenny
completed the 1855 Treaty, he negotiated a Treaty with the
Chippewa of Sault Ste. Marie that expressly revoked fishing
rights that had been reserved in an earlier Treaty. See
Treaty with the Chippewa of Sault Ste. Marie, Art. 1, 11

United States the right of fishing at the falls of St. Mary's

e. g., Choctaw Nation v. Oklahoma, 397 U. S. 620, 631 (1970)
(rejecting argument that language in Treaty had specialmeaning when United States was competent to state that

meaning more clearly).

The State argues that despite any explicit reference to the1837 Treaty rights, or to usufructuary rights more generally,

the second sentence of Article 1 nevertheless abrogatesthose rights. But to determine whether this language abrogates Chippewa Treaty rights, we look beyond the writtenwords to the larger context that frames the Treaty, including
"the history of the treaty, the negotiations, and the practicalconstruction adopted by the parties."

Choctaw Nation v.
United States, 318 U. S. 423, 432 (1943); see also El Al Israel
Airlines, Ltd. v. Tsui Yuan Tseng, 525 U. S. 155, 167 (1999).In this case, an examination of the historical record provides

insight into how the parties to the Treaty understood theterms of the agreement. This insight is especially helpful
to the extent that it sheds light on how the Chippewa sig-natories to the Treaty understood the agreement because
we interpret Indian treaties to give effect to the terms asthe Indians themselves would have understood them. See
Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger
Fishing Vessel Assn., 443 U. S. 658, 675-676 (1979); United
States v. Winans, 198 U. S. 371, 380-381 (1905).

The 1855 Treaty was designed primarily to transfer Chip-pewa land to the United States, not to terminate Chippewa

usufructuary rights. It was negotiated under the authority
of the Act of December 19, 1854. This Act authorized treaty

negotiations with the Chippewa "for the extinguishment oftheir title to all the lands owned and claimed by them in the

Territory of Minnesota and State of Wisconsin." Ch. 7, 10Stat. 598. The Act is silent with respect to authorizing
agreements to terminate Indian usufructuary privileges, andthis silence was likely not accidental. During Senate debate
on the Act, Senator Sebastian, the chairman of the Commit-tee on Indian Affairs, stated that the treaties to be negotiated under the Act would "reserv[e] to them [i. e., the Chip-pewa] those rights which are secured by former treaties."
Cong. Globe, 33d Cong., 1st Sess., 1404 (1854).In the winter of 1854-1855, Commissioner Manypenny
summoned several Chippewa chiefs to Washington, D. C., tobegin negotiations over the sale of Chippewa land in Minnesota to the United States. See App. 288 (letter from Many-penny to Gorman, Jan. 4, 1855). The negotiations ran from
February 12 through February 22. Commissioner Many-penny opened the negotiations by telling the Chippewa
chiefs that his goal for the negotiations was to buy a portionof their land,

id., at 304 (1855 Treaty Journal), and he stayedfirm to this proposed course throughout the talks, focusing

the discussions on the purchase of Chippewa land. Indeedall of the participants in the negotiations, including the Indians, understood that the purpose of the negotiations was totransfer Indian land to the United States. The Chief of the
Pillager Band of Chippewa stated: "It appears to me that I
understand what you want, and your views from the fewwords I have heard you speak. You want land."

Id., at 309
(1855 Treaty Journal) (statement of Flat Mouth). Commis-sioner Manypenny confirmed that the chief correctly understood the purpose of the negotiations:

"He appears to understand the object of the interview.
His people had more land than they wanted or could use,and stood in need of money; and I have more money than

I need, but want more land." Ibid.

Opinion of the Court

See also id., at 304 (statement of Hole-in-the-Day, the prin-cipal negotiator for the Chippewa: "Your words strike us in

this way. They are very short. `I want to buy your land.'These words are very expressive--very curt").

Like the authorizing legislation, the Treaty Journal, recording the course of the negotiations themselves, is silentwith respect to usufructuary rights. The journal records

no discussion of the 1837 Treaty, of hunting, fishing, andgathering rights, or of the abrogation of those rights.

Id.,
at 297-356. This silence suggests that the Chippewa did notunderstand the proposed Treaty to abrogate their usufructuary rights as guaranteed by other treaties. It is difficult
to believe that in 1855, the Chippewa would have agreed to
relinquish the usufructuary rights they had fought to preserve in 1837 without at least a passing word about the
relinquishment.

After the Treaty was signed, President Pierce submitted
it to the Senate for ratification, along with an accompanying
memorandum from Commissioner Manypenny describing the
Treaty he had just negotiated. Like the Treaty and the
Treaty Journal, this report is silent about hunting, fishing,
and gathering rights. Id., at 290-294 (message of the President of the United States communicating a treaty made with
the Mississippi, the Pillager, and the Lake Winnibigoshish
Bands of Chippewa Indians).

Commissioner Manypenny's memorandum on the 1855
Treaty is illuminating not only for what it did not say, but
also for what it did say: The report suggests a purpose for
the second sentence of Article 1. According to the Commissioner's report, the Treaty provided for the purchase of between 11 and 14 million acres of Chippewa land within the
boundaries defined by the first article. In addition to this
defined tract of land, the Commissioner continued, "those Indians (and especially the Pillager and Lake Winnibigoshish
bands) have some right of interest in a large extent of other
lands in common with other Indians in Minnesota, and which

Opinion of the Court
right or interest . . . is also ceded to the United States." Id.,at 292. This part of the Commissioner's report suggests

that the second sentence of Article 1 was designed not toextinguish usufructuary rights, but rather to extinguish remaining Chippewa land claims. The "other lands" do not
appear to be the lands ceded by the 1837 Treaty. The Pil-lager and Lake Winnibigoshish Bands did not occupy lands

in the 1837 ceded territory, so it is unlikely that the Commis-sioner would have described the usufructuary rights guaranteed by the 1837 Treaty as belonging "especially" to thoseBands. Moreover, the 1837 Treaty privileges were held in
common largely with Chippewa bands in Wisconsin, not with
"other Indians in Minnesota." In other words, the second
sentence of Article 1 did not extinguish usufructuary privileges, but rather it extinguished Chippewa land claims that
Commissioner Manypenny could not describe precisely. See
e. g., id., at 317-318 (1855 Treaty Journal) (Pillager negotiator declines to "state precisely what our bands claim as a
right"). See also 861 F. Supp., at 816-817.

One final part of the historical record also suggests that
the 1855 Treaty was a land purchase treaty and not a treaty
that also terminated usufructuary rights: the 1854 Treaty
with the Chippewa. Most of the Chippewa Bands that resided within the territory ceded by the 1837 Treaty were
signatories to the 1854 Treaty; only the Mille Lacs Band was
a party to the 1855 Treaty. If the United States had intended to abrogate Chippewa usufructuary rights under the
1837 Treaty, it almost certainly would have included a provision to that effect in the 1854 Treaty, yet that Treaty contains no such provision. To the contrary, it expressly secures new usufructuary rights to the signatory Bands on the
newly ceded territory. The State proposes no explanation--
compelling or otherwise--for why the United States would
have wanted to abrogate the Mille Lacs Band's hunting and
fishing rights, while leaving intact the other Bands' rights to
hunt and fish on the same territory.

CHIPPEWA INDIANS

Opinion of the Court

To summarize, the historical record provides no supportfor the theory that the second sentence of Article 1 was designed to abrogate the usufructuary privileges guaranteedunder the 1837 Treaty, but it does support the theory that
the Treaty, and Article 1 in particular, was designed to transfer Chippewa land to the United States. At the very least,the historical record refutes the State's assertion that the

1855 Treaty "unambiguously" abrogated the 1837 hunting,fishing, and gathering privileges. Given this plausible ambiguity, we cannot agree with the State that the 1855 Treatyabrogated Chippewa usufructuary rights. We have held
that Indian treaties are to be interpreted liberally in favor
of the Indians, Washington v. Washington State Commercial
Passenger Fishing Vessel Assn., 443 U. S., at 675-676; Choctaw Nation v. United States, 318 U. S., at 432, and that any
ambiguities are to be resolved in their favor, Winters v.
United States, 207 U. S. 564, 576-577 (1908). See also
County of Yakima v. Confederated Tribes and Bands of
Yakima Nation, 502 U. S. 251, 269 (1992).

To attack the conclusion that the 1855 Treaty does not abrogate the usufructuary rights guaranteed under the 1837
Treaty, the State relies primarily on our decision in Oregon
Dept. of Fish and Wildlife v. Klamath Tribe, 473 U. S. 753
(1985). Klamath required this Court to interpret two
agreements. In the first agreement, an 1864 Treaty between the United States and several Indian Tribes now collectively known as the Klamath Indian Tribe, the Indians
conveyed their remaining lands to the United States, and a
portion of this land was set aside as a reservation. Id., at
755. The 1864 Treaty provided that the Tribe had the " `exclusive right of taking fish in the streams and lakes, included
in said reservation, and of gathering edible roots, seeds, and
berries within its limits,' " but it provided for no offreservation usufructuary rights. Ibid. (quoting Treaty of
Oct. 14, 1864). Due to a surveying error, the reservation
excluded land that, under the terms of the Treaty, should

526US1 Unit: $U39 [12-13-00 19:23:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN

201Cite as: 526 U. S. 172 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
have been included within the reservation. Thus, in 1901,the United States and the Tribe entered into a second agreement, in which the United States agreed to compensate theTribe for those lands, and the Tribe agreed to " `cede, surrender, grant, and convey to the United States all their claim,
right, title and interest in and to' " the lands erroneouslyexcluded from the reservation.

Id., at 760. The Tribe
contended that the 1901 agreement had not abrogated itsusufructuary rights under the 1864 Treaty with respect to

those lands.We rejected the Tribe's argument and held that it had in
fact relinquished its usufructuary rights to the lands at issue.
We recognized that the 1864 Treaty had secured certain usufructuary rights to the Tribe, but we also recognized, based
on an analysis of the specific terms of the Treaty, that the
1864 Treaty restricted those rights to the lands within the
reservation. Id., at 766-767. Because the rights were
characterized as "exclusive," this "foreclose[d] the possibility
that they were intended to have existence outside of the reservation." Id., at 767. In other words, "because the right
to hunt and fish reserved in the 1864 Treaty was an exclusive
right to be exercised within the reservation, that right could
not consistently survive off the reservation" on the lands the
Tribe had sold. Id., at 769-770. This understanding of the
Tribe's usufructuary rights under the 1864 Treaty--that
those rights were exclusive, on-reservation rights--informed
our conclusion that the Klamath Tribe did not retain any
usufructuary rights on the land that it ceded in the 1901
agreement, land that was not part of the reservation. In
addition, we noted that there was nothing in the historical
record of the 1901 agreement that suggested that the parties
intended to change the background understanding of the
scope of the usufructuary rights. Id., at 772-773.

Klamath does not control this case. First, the Chippewa's usufructuary rights under the 1837 Treaty existed
independently of land ownership; they were neither tied to a

CHIPPEWA INDIANS

Opinion of the Court

reservation nor exclusive. In contrast to Klamath, there isno background understanding of the rights to suggest that

they are extinguished when title to the land is extinguished.Without this background understanding, there is no reason
to believe that the Chippewa would have understood a ces-sion of a particular tract of land to relinquish hunting and
fishing privileges on another tract of land. More impor-tantly, however, the State's argument that similar language
in two Treaties involving different parties has precisely thesame meaning reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of
basic principles of treaty construction. Our holding in Klamath was not based solely on the bare language of the 1901agreement. Rather, to reach our conclusion about the

meaning of that language, we examined the historical recordand considered the context of the treaty negotiations to discern what the parties intended by their choice of words.This review of the history and the negotiations of the agreements is central to the interpretation of treaties. El Al
Israel Airlines, Ltd. v. Tsui Yuan Tseng, 525 U. S., at 167.As we described above, an analysis of the history, purpose,

and negotiations of this Treaty leads us to conclude that theMille Lacs Band did not relinquish their 1837 Treaty rights
in the 1855 Treaty. IV

Finally, the State argues that the Chippewa's usufructuaryrights under the 1837 Treaty were extinguished when Minnesota was admitted to the Union in 1858. In making thisargument, the State faces an uphill battle. Congress may
abrogate Indian treaty rights, but it must clearly expressits intent to do so.

United States v. Dion, 476 U. S. 734,738-740 (1986); see also

Washington v. Washington StateCommercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Assn., 443 U. S., at

690; Menominee Tribe v. United States, 391 U. S. 404, 413(1968). There must be "clear evidence that Congress actually considered the conflict between its intended action onthe one hand and Indian treaty rights on the other, and chose

203Cite as: 526 U. S. 172 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
to resolve that conflict by abrogating the treaty." United
States v. Dion, supra, at 740. There is no such "clear evidence" of congressional intent to abrogate the ChippewaTreaty rights here. The relevant statute--Minnesota's enabling Act--provides in relevant part:

"[T]he State of Minnesota shall be one, and is hereby
declared to be one, of the United States of America, andadmitted into the Union on an equal footing with the

original States in all respects whatever." Act of May11, 1858, 11 Stat. 285.

This language, like the rest of the Act, makes no mentionof Indian treaty rights; it provides no clue that Congress
considered the reserved rights of the Chippewa and decidedto abrogate those rights when it passed the Act. The State
concedes that the Act is silent in this regard, Brief for Petitioners 36, and the State does not point to any legislativehistory describing the effect of the Act on Indian treaty

rights.With no direct support for its argument, the State relies
principally on this Court's decision in Ward v. Race Horse,163 U. S. 504 (1896). In

Race Horse, we held that a Treaty
reserving to a Tribe " `the right to hunt on the unoccupiedlands of the United States, so long as game may be found

thereon, and so long as peace subsists among the whites and
Indians on the borders of the hunting districts' " terminatedwhen Wyoming became a State in 1890.

Id., at 507 (quoting
Art. 4 of the Treaty). This case does not bear the weightthe State places on it, however, because it has been qualified

by later decisions of this Court.

The first part of the holding in Race Horse was based on
the "equal footing doctrine," the constitutional principle that
all States are admitted to the Union with the same attributes
of sovereignty (i. e., on equal footing) as the original 13
States. See Coyle v. Smith, 221 U. S. 559 (1911). As relevant here, it prevents the Federal Government from impair526US1 Unit: $U39 [12-13-00 19:23:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN
204 MINNESOTA v. MILLE LACS BAND OF

CHIPPEWA INDIANS

Opinion of the Court

ing fundamental attributes of state sovereignty when it ad-mits new States into the Union.

Id., at 573. According to
the Race Horse Court, because the treaty rights conflictedirreconcilably with state regulation of natural resources--

"an essential attribute of its governmental existence," 163
U. S., at 516--the treaty rights were held an invalid impair-ment of Wyoming's sovereignty. Thus, those rights could

not survive Wyoming's admission to the Union on "equalfooting" with the original States.

But Race Horse rested on a false premise. As this Court'ssubsequent cases have made clear, an Indian tribe's treaty
rights to hunt, fish, and gather on state land are not irreconcilable with a State's sovereignty over the natural resources
in the State. See, e. g., Washington v. Washington State
Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Assn., supra; see also
Antoine v. Washington, 420 U. S. 194 (1975). Rather, Indian
treaty rights can coexist with state management of natural
resources. Although States have important interests in
regulating wildlife and natural resources within their borders, this authority is shared with the Federal Government
when the Federal Government exercises one of its enumerated constitutional powers, such as treaty making. U. S.
Const., Art. VI, cl. 2. See, e. g., Missouri v. Holland, 252
U. S. 416 (1920); Kleppe v. New Mexico, 426 U. S. 529 (1976);
United States v. Winans, 198 U. S., at 382-384; United States
v. Forty-three Gallons of Whiskey, 93 U. S. 188 (1876). See
also Menominee Tribe v. United States, supra, at 411, n. 12.
Here, the 1837 Treaty gave the Chippewa the right to hunt,
fish, and gather in the ceded territory free of territorial, and
later state, regulation, a privilege that others did not enjoy.
Today, this freedom from state regulation curtails the State's
ability to regulate hunting, fishing, and gathering by the
Chippewa in the ceded lands. But this Court's cases have
also recognized that Indian treaty-based usufructuary rights
do not guarantee the Indians "absolute freedom" from state
regulation. Oregon Dept. of Fish and Wildlife v. Klamath

526US1 Unit: $U39 [12-13-00 19:23:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN

205Cite as: 526 U. S. 172 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
Tribe, 473 U. S., at 765, n. 16. We have repeatedly reaf-firmed state authority to impose reasonable and necessary

nondiscriminatory regulations on Indian hunting, fishing, andgathering rights in the interest of conservation. See Puyallup Tribe v. Department of Game of Wash., 391 U. S. 392,398 (1968);

Washington v. Washington State CommercialPassenger Fishing Vessel Assn., 443 U. S., at 682; Antoine v.

Washington, supra, at 207-208. This "conservation neces-sity" standard accommodates both the State's interest in
management of its natural resources and the Chippewa'sfederally guaranteed treaty rights. Thus, because treaty
rights are reconcilable with state sovereignty over naturalresources, statehood by itself is insufficient to extinguish
Indian treaty rights to hunt, fish, and gather on land withinstate boundaries.

7

We do not understand Justice Thomas to disagree withthis fundamental conclusion.

Race Horse rested on the
premise that treaty rights are irreconcilable with state sovereignty. It is this conclusion--the conclusion undergirdingthe

Race Horse Court's equal footing holding--that we have
consistently rejected over the years. Justice Thomas'only disagreement is as to the scope of state regulatory

authority. His disagreement is premised on a purporteddistinction between "rights" and "privileges." This Court
has never used a distinction between rights and privileges

7 The Chief Justice asserts that our criticism of Race Horse is inappropriate given our recent "reaffirm[ation]" of that case in Oregon Dept.
of Fish and Wildlife v. Klamath Tribe, 473 U. S. 753 (1985). Post, at 219.
Although we cited Race Horse in Klamath, we did not in so doing reaffirm
the equal footing doctrine as a bar to the continuation of Indian treatybased usufructuary rights. Klamath did not involve the equal footing
doctrine. Rather, we cited Race Horse for the second part of its holding,
discussed in the text, infra, at 206-208. See 473 U. S., at 773, n. 23. In
any event, the Race Horse Court's reliance on the equal footing doctrine
to terminate Indian treaty rights rested on foundations that were rejected
by this Court within nine years of that decision. See United States v.
Winans, 198 U. S. 371, 382-384 (1905).

Opinion of the Court

to justify any differences in state regulatory authority.Moreover, as

Justice Thomas acknowledges, post, at 223
(dissenting opinion), the starting point for any analysis ofthese questions is the treaty language itself. The Treaty

must be interpreted in light of the parties' intentions, with
any ambiguities resolved in favor of the Indians. Winters v.
United States, 207 U. S., at 576-577. There is no evidence
that the Chippewa understood any fine legal distinctionsbetween rights and privileges. Moreover, under

Justice
Thomas' view of the 1837 Treaty, the guarantee of hunting,fishing, and gathering privileges was essentially an empty

promise because it gave the Chippewa nothing that they did
not already have.

The equal footing doctrine was only part of the holding
in Race Horse, however. We also announced an alternative
holding: The treaty rights at issue were not intended to survive Wyoming's statehood. We acknowledged that Congress, in the exercise of its authority over territorial lands,
has the power to secure off-reservation usufructuary rights
to Indian tribes through a treaty, and that "it would be also
within the power of Congress to continue them in the State,
on its admission into the Union." 163 U. S., at 515. We also
acknowledged that if Congress intended the rights to survive
statehood, there was no need for Congress to preserve those
rights explicitly in the statehood Act. We concluded, however, that the particular rights in the Treaty at issue there--
"the right to hunt on the unoccupied lands of the United
States"--were not intended to survive statehood. Id., at
514; see id., at 514-515.

The Chief Justice reads Race Horse to establish a rule
that "temporary and precarious" treaty rights, as opposed to
treaty rights "which were `of such a nature as to imply their
perpetuity,' " are not intended to survive statehood. Post,
at 219. But the "temporary and precarious" language in
Race Horse is too broad to be useful in distinguishing rights
that survive statehood from those that do not. In Race

207Cite as: 526 U. S. 172 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
Horse, the Court concluded that the right to hunt on federallands was temporary because Congress could terminate the

right at any time by selling the lands. 163 U. S., at 510.Under this line of reasoning, any right created by operation
of federal law could be described as "temporary and precarious," because Congress could eliminate the right wheneverit wished. In other words, the line suggested by

Race
Horse is simply too broad to be useful as a guide to whethertreaty rights were intended to survive statehood.

The focus of the Race Horse inquiry is whether Congress(more precisely, because this is a treaty, the Senate) intended
the rights secured by the 1837 Treaty to survive statehood.
Id., at 514-515. The 1837 Treaty itself defines the circumstances under which the rights would terminate: when the
exercise of those rights was no longer the "pleasure of the
President." There is no suggestion in the Treaty that the
President would have to conclude that the privileges should
end when a State was established in the area. Moreover,
unlike the rights at issue in Race Horse, there is no fixed
termination point to the 1837 Treaty rights. The Treaty in
Race Horse contemplated that the rights would continue only
so long as the hunting grounds remained unoccupied and
owned by the United States; the happening of these conditions was "clearly contemplated" when the Treaty was ratified. Id., at 509. By contrast, the 1837 Treaty does not tie
the duration of the rights to the occurrence of some clearly
contemplated event. Finally, we note that there is nothing
inherent in the nature of reserved treaty rights to suggest
that they can be extinguished by implication at statehood.
Treaty rights are not impliedly terminated upon statehood.
Wisconsin v. Hitchcock, 201 U. S. 202, 213-214 (1906); Johnson v. Gearlds, 234 U. S. 422, 439-440 (1914). The Race
Horse Court's decision to the contrary--that Indian treaty
rights were impliedly repealed by Wyoming's statehood
Act--was informed by that Court's conclusion that the Indian treaty rights were inconsistent with state sovereignty

over natural resources and thus that Congress (the Senate)
could not have intended the rights to survive statehood.
But as we described above, Indian treaty-based usufructuary rights are not inconsistent with state sovereignty over

natural resources. See supra, at 204-205. Thus, contrary
to the State's contentions, Race Horse does not compel the
conclusion that Minnesota's admission to the Union extinguished Chippewa usufructuary rights guaranteed by the
1837 Treaty.

Accordingly, the judgment of the United States Court of
Appeals for the Eighth Circuit is affirmed.

It is so ordered.

Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice Scalia,
Justice Kennedy, and Justice Thomas join, dissenting.

The Court holds that the various Bands of Chippewa Indians retain a usufructuary right granted to them in an 1837
Treaty. To reach this result, the Court must successively
conclude that: (1) an 1850 Executive Order explicitly revoking the privilege as authorized by the 1837 Treaty was unlawful; (2) an 1855 Treaty under which certain Chippewa
Bands ceded "all" interests to the land does not include the
treaty right to come onto the land and hunt; and (3) the admission of Minnesota into the Union in 1858 did not terminate the discretionary hunting privilege, despite established
precedent of this Court to the contrary. Because I believe
that each one of these three conclusions is demonstrably
wrong, I dissent.

I

I begin with the text of the Treaty negotiated in 1837. In
that Treaty, the Chippewa ceded land to the United States in
exchange for specified consideration. Article 1 of the Treaty
describes the land ceded by the Chippewa to the United
States. Article 2 of the 1837 Treaty provides:

Thus, in exchange for the land cessions, the Chippewa agreedto receive an annuity payment of money, goods, and the implements necessary for creating blacksmith's shops andfarms, for a limited duration of 20 years.

210 MINNESOTA v. MILLE LACS BAND OF

CHIPPEWA INDIANS

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting

Articles 3 and 4 of the Treaty deal with cash payments topersons not parties to this suit, but Article 5 is involved here.

As the Court notes, there was some discussion during thetreaty negotiations that the Chippewa wished to preserve
some right to hunt in the ceded territory. See ante, at 176.The United States agreed to this request to some extent, and
the agreement of the parties was embodied in Article 5 ofthe Treaty, which provides that:

"The privilege of hunting, fishing, and gathering thewild rice, upon the lands, the rivers and the lakes included in the territory ceded, is guarantied to the Indi-ans, during the pleasure of the President of the United
States." 7 Stat. 537.
As the Court also notes, the Chippewa were aware that theirright to come onto the ceded land was not absolute--

the Court quotes the statement of Governor Dodge to theChippewa that he would " `make known to your Great Father, your request to be permitted to make sugar, on thelands; and you will be allowed, during his pleasure, to hunt
and fish on them.' " Ante, at 176; App. 46 (1837 Journal ofTreaty Negotiations).

Thus, the Treaty by its own plain terms provided for a
quid pro quo: Land was ceded in exchange for a 20-year an-nuity of money and goods. Additionally, the United States

granted the Chippewa a quite limited "privilege" to hunt andfish, "guarantied . . . during the pleasure of the President."
Art. 5, 7 Stat. 537. II

In 1850, President Taylor expressly terminated the 1837Treaty privilege by Executive Order. The Executive
Order provides:

"The privileges granted temporarily to the ChippewaIndians of the Mississippi by the Fifth Article of the

Treaty made with them on the 29th of July 1837, `ofhunting, fishing and gathering the wild rice, upon the

lands, the rivers and the lakes included in the territoryceded' by that treaty to the United States . . . are hereby

revoked; and all of the said Indians remaining on thelands ceded as aforesaid, are required to remove to their
unceded lands." App. to Pet. for Cert. 565.
In deciding that this seemingly ironclad revocation was noteffective as a matter of law, the Court rests its analysis on

four findings. First, the Court notes that the President'spower to issue the order must stem either from an Act of
Congress or the Constitution itself. Second, the Court de-termines that the Executive Order was a "removal order."
Third, the Court finds no authority for the President to orderthe Chippewa to remove from the ceded lands. And fourth,
the Court holds that the portion of the Executive Order ex-tinguishing the hunting and fishing rights is not severable
from the "removal order" and thus also was illegal. I shalladdress each of these dubious findings in turn.

The Court's first proposition is the seemingly innocuousstatement that a President's Executive Order must be authorized by law in order to have any legal effect. In sodoing, the Court quotes our decision in

Youngstown Sheet &Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579, 585 (1952), which held that

President Truman's seizure of the steel mills by ExecutiveOrder during the Korean War was unlawful. However, the
Court neglects to note that treaties, every bit as much asstatutes, are sources of law and may also authorize Executive actions. See Dames & Moore v. Regan, 453 U. S. 654,680 (1981). In

Dames & Moore, we noted that where thePresident acts with the implied consent of Congress in his

Executive actions, "he exercises not only his own powers butalso those delegated by Congress," and that such an action
was entitled to high deference as to its legality. Id., at 668.This case involves an even stronger case for deference to
Executive power than Dames & Moore, in which Presiden-tial power under an Executive agreement was impliedly authorized by Congress, because the Executive Order in this

case was issued pursuant to a Treaty ratified by the adviceand consent of the Senate, and thus became the supreme law

of the land. See U. S. Const., Art. VI; United States v. Belmont, 301 U. S. 324 (1937). The Court's contrary conclusion
is simply wrong.

The Court's second assumption is that the ExecutiveOrder was a "removal order"--that its primary purpose was

the removal of the Chippewa. This assumption rests uponscattered historical evidence that, in the Court's view, "[t]he
officials charged with implementing this order understood itprimarily as a removal order, and they proceeded to implement it accordingly." Ante, at 179. Regardless of what the
President's remote frontier agents may have thought, the
plain meaning of the text of President Taylor's order can only
support the opposite conclusion. The structure of the Executive Order is not that of a removal order, with the revocation of the hunting privileges added merely as an afterthought. Instead, the first part of the order (not to mention
the bulk of its text) deals with the extinguishment of the
Indians' privilege to enter onto the lands ceded to the United
States and hunt. Only then (and then only in its final five
words) does the Executive Order require the Indians to "remove to their unceded lands." App. to Pet. for Cert. 565
(Exec. Order, Feb. 6, 1850).

If the structure and apparent plain meaning of the Executive Order reveal that the order was primarily a revocation
of the privilege to hunt during the President's pleasure, what
then should we make of the fact that the officials charged
with "implementing" the order viewed their task as primarily effecting removal? The answer is simple. First, the
bulk of the Executive Order that terminates the hunting
privilege was self-executing. Second, while the President
could terminate the legal right (i. e., the privilege to enter
onto the ceded lands and hunt) without taking enforcement
action, a removal order would require actual implementation. The historical evidence cited by the Court is best

526US1 Unit: $U39 [12-13-00 19:23:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN

213Cite as: 526 U. S. 172 (1999)
Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
understood thus as an implementation of President Taylor'sunequivocal (and legally effective) termination of the usufructuary privileges. But while the removal portion mayhave required implementation to be effective, this cannot
turn the Executive Order into a "removal order." And even
if the President's agents viewed the order as a removal order(a proposition for which the historical evidence is far more

ambiguous than the Court admits), their interpretation is notbinding on this Court; nor should it be, since the agents had
nothing to do with the bulk of the order which terminatedthe treaty privileges.

The Court's third finding is that the removal portion of the
order is invalid because President Taylor had no authority
to order removal. Although the Court sensibly concludes
that the Removal Act of 1830 is inapplicable to this case, it
then curiously rejects the notion that the 1837 Treaty authorizes removal, largely on the grounds that "[t]he Treaty
makes no mention of removal." Ante, at 189. The Court is
correct that the Treaty does not mention removal, but this
is because the Treaty was essentially a deed of conveyance--
it transferred land to the United States in exchange for
goods and money. After the Treaty was executed and ratified, the ceded lands belonged to the United States, and the
only real property interest in the land remaining to the Indians was the privilege to come onto it and hunt during the
pleasure of the President. When the President terminated
that privilege (a legal act that the Court appears to concede he had a right to make, ante, at 193-194), he terminated
the Indians' right to come onto the ceded lands and hunt.
The Indians had no legal right to remain on the ceded lands
for that purpose, and the removal portion of the order should
be viewed in this context. Indeed, the Indians then had
no legal rights at all with respect to the ceded lands, in which
all title was vested in the United States. And this Court
has long held that the President has the implied power to
administer the public lands. See, e. g., United States v. Mid526US1 Unit: $U39 [12-13-00 19:23:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN

west Oil Co., 236 U. S. 459 (1915). Dealing with personswhose legal right to come onto the lands and hunt had been

extinguished would appear to fall squarely under this power.Whether the President chose to enforce his revocation
through an order to leave the land or the ambiguous lesser
"measures to make sure that the Chippewa were not hunt-ing, fishing, or gathering" proposed by the Court,

ante, at
194, n. 5, is not ours to second-guess a century and a halflater. Indeed, although the Court appears to concede that

the President had the power to enforce the revocation order,it is difficult to imagine what steps he could have taken to
prevent hunting other than ordering the Chippewa not tocome onto the land for that purpose. The ceded lands were
not a national park, nor did the President have an army of
park rangers available to guard Minnesota's wildlife fromChippewa poachers. Removal was the only viable option in

enforcing his power under the Treaty to terminate the hunting privilege. Thus, in my view, the final part of the Executive Order discussing removal was lawful.1

1 The Court's assumption that "any general presumption about the legality of executive action runs into the principle that treaty ambiguities are
to be resolved in favor of the Indians," ante, at 194, n. 5, illogically confuses the difference between executive authority and a principle of treaty
construction. The principle of Winters v. United States, 207 U. S. 564,
567-577 (1908), and County of Yakima v. Confederated Tribes and Bands
of Yakima Nation, 502 U. S. 251, 269 (1992), that ambiguities in treaties
are to be resolved in favor of the Indians, is only relevant to determining
the intent of the parties to a treaty (that is the United States and the
Indian tribe), and stems from the idea that in determining the intent of
the parties, Indian tribes should be given the benefit of the doubt as
against the United States in cases of ambiguous treaty provisions because
the United States was presumptively a more sophisticated bargainer.
See Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing
Vessel Assn., 443 U. S. 658, 675-676 (1979). But the determination of
whether the President has power to enforce his revocation by removal is
irrelevant to the intent of the parties to the treaty (the United States and
the Chippewa in this case) and presents instead an issue of separation of
powers (between the President and the Congress).

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
The fourth element essential to today's holding is the con-clusion that if the final part of the Executive Order requiring

removal were not authorized, the bulk of the order wouldfail as not severable. Because this is the first time we have
had occasion to consider the severability of Executive Orders, the Court first assumes that the standards for sever-ability of statutes also apply to the severability of Executive

Orders. Next, the Court determines to seek the "legislativeintent" of President Taylor in issuing the order.

Ante, at
191. And finally, the Court concludes that President Taylorwould not have issued the Executive Order in the absence

of a removal provision, because the 1850 order embodied a
coherent policy of Indian removal. As noted above, this
approach to the Executive Order stands it on its head--
the order first extinguishes the hunting privilege and only
then--in its last five words--orders removal.

But even if I were to assume that the President were without authority to order removal, I would conclude that the
removal provision is severable from that terminating the
treaty privileges. There is no dispute that the President
had authority under the 1837 Treaty to terminate the treaty
privileges. We have long held that "[w]hen the President
acts pursuant to an express or implied authorization from
Congress, . . . the executive action `would be supported
by the strongest of presumptions and the widest latitude of

judicial interpretation, and the burden of persuasion would
rest heavily upon any who might attack it.' " Dames &
Moore v. Regan, 453 U. S., at 668 (quoting Youngstown
Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S., at 637 (Jackson, J.,
concurring)). Against this deferential standard, the Court
musters little more than conjecture and inference, reinforced
by its upside-down reading of the Executive Order's plain
text. Not only does the Court invert the plain meaning of
the Executive Order, it inverts the proper standard of
review. Given the deference we are to accord this valid action made pursuant to a treaty, the order's termination of

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting

the treaty privileges should be sustained unless the Chippewa are able to clearly demonstrate that President Taylor
would not have terminated them without a removal order.
But there is no such evidence, and in the absence of evidence challenging the "strongest of presumptions and the
widest latitude of judicial interpretation" that we are required to afford President Taylor's actions, we have only
the Court's misguided excursion into historiographical
clairvoyance. Accordingly, I would conclude, if necessary,
that the termination portion of the Executive Order is
severable.

Rather than engage in the flawed analysis put forward by
the Court, I would instead hold that the Executive Order
constituted a valid revocation of the Chippewa's hunting and
fishing privileges. Pursuant to a Treaty, the President terminated the Indians' hunting and fishing privileges in an Executive Order which stated, in effect, that the privilege to
come onto federal lands and hunt was terminated, and that
the Indians move themselves from those lands.

No party has questioned the President's power to terminate the hunting privilege; indeed, the only other evidence
in the record of a President's intent regarding the Executive
Order is a 1938 letter from President Franklin Roosevelt to
one of the Chippewa, in which he stated his understanding
that the Indians had "temporarily" enjoyed "the right to
hunt and fish on the area ceded by them until such right
was revoked by the President" in the 1850 Executive Order.
App. to Pet. for Cert. 575 (letter from President Roosevelt
to Whitebird, Mar. 1, 1938). President Roosevelt went on
to add that since the right to hunt and fish was terminated
in 1850, the Chippewa "now have no greater right to hunt
or fish on the ceded area . . . than do the other citizens of

the State. Therefore, the Indians who hunt or fish . . . are
amenable to the State game laws and are subject to arrest
and conviction [f]or violation thereof." Id., at 576.

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
President Roosevelt's letter reflects the settled expecta-tions of the President, in whose office the discretion to terminate the privilege granted in Article 5 of the 1837 Treatywas vested, that the 1850 Executive Order was a valid termination of the treaty privileges. And because the 1837Treaty, in conjunction with the Presidential power over public lands, gave the President the power to order removal inconjunction with his termination of the hunting rights, the
Court's severability analysis is unnecessary. In sum, thereis simply no principled reason to invalidate the 150-year-old
Executive Order, particularly in view of the heightened def-erence and wide latitude that we are required to give orders
of this sort. III

Although I believe that the clear meaning of the ExecutiveOrder is sufficient to resolve this case, and that it is unnecessary to address the Court's treatment of the 1855 Treaty andthe 1858 admission of Minnesota to the Union, I shall briefly
express my strong disagreement with the Court's analysison these issues also.

As the Court notes, in 1855, several of the ChippewaBands agreed, in exchange for further annuity payments
of money and goods, to "fully and entirely relinquish andconvey to the United States, any and all right, title, and interest, of whatsoever nature the same may be, which theynow have in, and to any other lands in the Territory of Minnesota or elsewhere." 10 Stat. 1166. The plain meaning of
this provision is a relinquishment of the Indians of "all"rights to the land. The Court, however, interprets this

provision in a manner contrary to its plain meaning by first
noting that the provision does not mention "usufructuary"rights. It argues, citing examples, that since the United

States "had the sophistication and experience to use expresslanguage for the abrogation of treaty rights,"

ante, at 195,
but did not mention the 1837 Treaty rights in drafting this

language,2 it perhaps did not intend to extinguish those
rights, thus creating an interpretation at odds with the
Treaty's language. Then, using our canons of construction
that ambiguities in treaties are often resolved in favor of
the Indians, it concludes that the Treaty did not apply to the
hunting rights.

I think this conclusion strained, indeed. First, the language of the Treaty is so broad as to encompass "all" interests in land possessed or claimed by the Indians. Second,
while it is important to the Court that the Treaty "is devoid
of any language expressly mentioning--much less abrogating--usufructuary rights," ibid., the definition of "usufructuary rights" explains further why this is so. Usufructuary
rights are "a real right of limited duration on the property
of another." See Black's Law Dictionary 1544 (6th ed. 1990).
It seems to me that such a right would fall clearly under
the sweeping language of the Treaty under any reasonable
interpretation, and that this is not a case where "even
`learned lawyers' of the day would probably have offered differing interpretations of the [treaty language]." Cf. Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing
Vessel Assn., 443 U. S. 658, 677 (1979). And third, although
the Court notes that in other treaties the United States
sometimes expressly mentioned cessions of usufructuary
rights, there was no need to do so in this case, because the
settled expectation of the United States was that the 1850
Executive Order had terminated the hunting rights of the
Chippewa. Thus, rather than applying the plain and unequivocal language of the 1855 Treaty, the Court holds that
"all" does not in fact mean "all."

2 One notices the irony that where the President chose to explicitly eliminate the 1837 Treaty rights, the Court finds this specificity subsumed in
the "removal order," and invalidates it as well.

Finally, I note my disagreement with the Court's treat-ment of the equal footing doctrine, and its apparent overruling sub silentio of a precedent of 103 years' vintage. In
Ward v. Race Horse, 163 U. S. 504 (1896), we held thata Treaty granting the Indians "the right to hunt on the unoccupied lands of the United States, so long as game maybe found thereon, and so long as peace subsists among

the whites and the Indians on the borders of the huntingdistricts," did not survive the admission of Wyoming to
the Union since the treaty right was "temporary and pre-carious."

Id., at 515.But the Court, in a feat of jurisprudential legerdemain,

effectively overrules Race Horse sub silentio. First, theCourt notes that Congress may only abrogate Indian treaty
rights if it clearly expresses its intent to do so. Next, itasserts that Indian hunting rights are not irreconcilable with
state sovereignty, and determines that "because treatyrights are reconcilable with state sovereignty over natural
resources, statehood by itself is insufficient to extinguish In-dian treaty rights to hunt, fish, and gather on land within
state boundaries." Ante, at 205. And finally, the Courthints that Race Horse rested on an incorrect premise--that
Indian rights were inconsistent with state sovereignty.Without saying so, this jurisprudential bait-and-switch effectively overrules Race Horse, a case which we reaffirmed asrecently as 1985 in Oregon Dept. of Fish and Wildlife v. Klamath Tribe, 473 U. S. 753 (1985). Race Horse held merelythat treaty rights which were only "temporary and precarious," as opposed to those which were "of such a nature as toimply their perpetuity," do not survive statehood.

3 163 U. S.,

3 The Court maintains that this reading of Race Horse is overbroad and
would render any right created by operation of federal law "temporary and
precarious." Ante, at 206. Nothing could be further from the truth. The
outer limit of what constitutes a "temporary and precarious" right is not before the Court (nor, since Race Horse is apparently overruled, will it ever

at 515. Here, the hunting privileges were clearly, like thoseinvalidated in Race Horse, temporary and precarious: The

privilege was only guaranteed "during the pleasure of thePresident"; the legally enforceable annuity payments themselves were to terminate after 20 years; and the Indianswere on actual notice that the President might end the rights
in the future, App. 78 (1837 Journal of Treaty Negotiations).Perhaps the strongest indication of the temporary nature
of the treaty rights is presented unwittingly by the Court inits repeated (and correct) characterizations of the rights as
"usufructuary." As noted supra, at 218, usufructuary rightsare

by definition "of limited duration." Black's Law Dic-tionary,

supra, at 1544. Thus, even if the Executive Orderis invalid; and even if the 1855 Treaty did not cover the usufructuary rights: Under Race Horse, the temporary and pre-carious treaty privileges were eliminated by the admission
of Minnesota to the Union on an equal footing in 1858.Today the Court appears to invalidate (or at least substantially limit) Race Horse, without offering any principled rea-son to do so.

V
The Court today invalidates for no principled reason a149-year-old Executive Order, ignores the plain meaning of

a 144-year-old treaty provision, and overrules sub silentio a103-year-old precedent of this Court. I dissent.

Treaty in this case reveal themselves to be "temporary and precarious"
by their plain text: The privilege in Race Horse ended upon occupation of
the hunting districts or the outbreak of hostilities, while the privilege in
this case lasted only during the pleasure of the President. Both rights
were temporary and precarious, as neither was guaranteed, either expressly or impliedly, in perpetuity.

ante, at 204, our prior cases do not dictate the conclusionthat the 1837 Treaty curtails Minnesota's regulatory

authority.As the Court has ruled today that the Chippewa retain
the privilege to hunt, fish, and gather on the land they ceded
in the 1837 Treaty, the question of the scope of the State'sregulatory power over the Chippewas' exercise of those privileges assumes great significance--any limitations that theFederal Treaty may impose upon Minnesota's sovereign authority over its natural resources exact serious federalismcosts. The questions presented, however, do not require the
Court to decide whether the 1837 Treaty limits the State'sregulatory authority in any way. All that they require is a
judgment as to whether the usufructuary privileges at issue
survive three potentially extinguishing events: PresidentTaylor's 1850 Executive Order, the 1855 Treaty, and Minnesota's admission to the Union in 1858.The Court nevertheless offers the following observation:

"Here, the 1837 Treaty gave the Chippewa the right tohunt, fish, and gather in the ceded territory

free of territorial, and later state, regulation, a privilege thatothers did not enjoy. Today, this freedom from state

regulation curtails the State's ability to regulate hunting, fishing, and gathering by the Chippewa in the ceded
lands." Ante, at 204 (emphases added).

In light of the importance of this federalism question, the
Court should not pass on it, even in dicta, without the benefitof the parties' briefing and argument. But as the Court has

done so, I think it important to explain my disagreement
with the italicized propositions.

The plain language of the 1837 Treaty says nothing about
territorial, let alone future state, regulation. The historical
evidence that the Court reviews, ante, at 176-178, to the extent that it is relevant, is likewise silent as to whether the
Chippewa expected to be subject to any form of regulation

in the exercise of their reserved treaty privileges. The his-torical evidence certainly indicates that the Chippewa desired the privilege of access to the land they were ceding.But the 1837 Journal of Treaty Negotiations does not show
that the Chippewa demanded access to the land on any particular terms. See App. 70-78.Indeed, the Court retreats from its assertion that the 1837

Treaty gave the Chippewa an unlimited right to hunt, fish,and gather free from regulation when it states: "We have
repeatedly reaffirmed state authority to impose reasonableand necessary nondiscriminatory regulations on Indian hunting, fishing, and gathering rights in the interest of conservation." Ante, at 205. If the 1837 Treaty gives the Chippewa
a right to be free from state regulation, why may Minnesota
impose any regulations, reasonable and necessary or otherwise? The Court's answer to that question is that our prior
decisions have established that Indians never have " `absolute freedom,' " ante, at 204, from state regulation, no matter
what a treaty might say; rather, Indians' hunting, fishing,
and gathering activities are limited by those state regulations which are necessary for ensuring the conservation of
natural resources.

To be sure, Indians do not have absolute freedom from
state regulation of their off-reservation activities. Indeed,
the general rule is that the off-reservation activities of Indians are subject to a State's nondiscriminatory laws, absent
express federal law to the contrary. See, e. g., Oregon Dept.
of Fish and Wildlife v. Klamath Tribe, 473 U. S. 753, 765,
n. 16 (1985); New Mexico v. Mescalero Apache Tribe, 462
U. S. 324, 335, n. 18 (1983). The majority, however, overlooks the fact that the scope of a State's regulatory authority
depends upon the language of the treaty in question. At a
minimum, States may issue and enforce those regulations of
Indians' off-reservation usufructuary activities that are necessary in the interest of conservation. Our decisions suggest that state regulatory authority is so limited when, with

the treaty in question, the Indians reserved a right to fish,hunt, or gather on ceded lands. But it is doubtful that the

so-called "conservation necessity" standard applies in cases,such as this one, where Indians reserved no more than a
privilege to hunt, fish, and gather.The conservation necessity standard appears to have its
origin in Tulee v. Washington, 315 U. S. 681 (1942). In the1859 Treaty with the Yakima Indians, the Yakima reserved
" `the right of taking fish at all usual and accustomed places,in common with citizens of the Territory.' "

Id., at 683 (quot-ing 12 Stat. 953). The Court held that Washington State

had the "power to impose on Indians, equally with others,
such restrictions of a purely regulatory nature concerningthe time and manner of fishing outside the reservation

as are
necessary for the conservation of fish," but that the Treatyforeclosed "the state from charging the Indians a fee of the

kind in question." 315 U. S., at 684 (emphasis added). Itsconclusion was driven by the language of the Treaty as well
as the report of the treaty negotiations and what it revealedto be the Yakimas' understanding of the Treaty--to preserve their right "to hunt and fish in accordance with the immemorial customs of their tribes." Ibid.

issue with the language of the Treaties at issue in Winansand Puyallup). Most important, all the cases that the majority cites in support of the proposition that States mayenforce against Indians in their exercise of off-reservation
usufructuary activities only those regulations necessary forpurposes of conservation,

ante, at 204-205, involved the sameor substantially similar treaty language reserving a right to

hunt or fish. And all but Antoine also provided that theIndians could exercise their reserved rights at the usual and

accustomed places.In New York ex rel. Kennedy v. Becker, 241 U. S. 556
(1916), the Court considered significantly different language.The Big Tree Treaty of 1797, as the agreement was known,
provided that the Seneca were to retain "the privilege offishing and hunting on the said tract of land" conveyed by
the agreement. 7 Stat. 602 (emphasis added); see also 241U. S., at 562 (quoting the reservation clause). The Court
characterized the Senecas' claim as one "sought to be main-tained in derogation of the sovereignty of the State."

Ibid.In rejecting such a claim, it stated:

"[I]t can hardly be supposed that the thought of theIndians was concerned with the necessary exercise of
inherent power under modern conditions for the preser-vation of wild life. But the existence of the sovereignty
of the State was well understood, and this conceptioninvolved all that was necessarily implied in that sovereignty, whether fully appreciated or not. We do notthink that it is a proper construction of the reservation
in the conveyance to regard it as an attempt either to

Thomas, J., dissenting
reserve sovereign prerogative or so to divide the in-herent power of preservation as to make its competent

exercise impossible. Rather we are of the opinion thatthe clause is fully satisfied by considering it a reservation of a privilege of fishing and hunting upon thegranted lands

in common with the grantees, and othersto whom the privilege might be extended, but subject

nevertheless to that necessary power of appropriate reg-ulation, as to all those privileged, which inhered in the
sovereignty of the State over the lands where the privi-lege was exercised." Id., at 563-564 (emphasis added).

The only fair reading of Kennedy is that the Treaty reservedfor the Seneca a privilege in common with all persons to
whom the State chose to extend fishing and hunting privi-leges. The Court did not indicate that the Treaty limited
New York's regulatory authority with respect to the Senecain any way. See

id., at 564 (the treaty privilege was subjectto "that necessary power of appropriate regulation, as to all

those privileged, which inhered in the sovereignty of theState over the lands where the privilege was exercised" (emphasis added)). Of course, then, what was "appropriate"state regulation as applied to non-Indians was "appropriate"
regulation as applied to the Seneca. Cf. Puyallup Tribe,
supra, at 402, n. 14 ("The measure of the legal proprietyof [regulations that are to be measured by the conservation

necessity standard] is . . . distinct from the federal constitu-tional standard concerning the scope of the police power of
a State").2

2 As already noted, supra, at 222, the Court has said that "[a]bsent express federal law to the contrary, Indians going beyond reservation boundaries have generally been held subject to nondiscriminatory state law
otherwise applicable to all citizens of the State." Mescalero Apache Tribe
v. Jones, 411 U. S. 145, 148-149 (1973) (State of New Mexico permitted

to tax off-reservation activities of Tribe as they would any non-Indians).
In support of that proposition in Mescalero, the Court cited the Puyallup
Tribe and Tulee decisions, but not Kennedy. A possible explanation is

Thomas, J., dissenting

The 1837 Treaty at issue here did not reserve "the rightof taking fish at all usual and accustomed places, in common

with citizens of the Territory" like those involved in Tuleeand Puyallup Tribe. Rather, it provided:

"The privilege of hunting, fishing, and gathering thewild rice, upon the lands, the rivers and the lakes included in the territory ceded, is guarantied to the Indi-ans, during the pleasure of the President of the United
States." 1837 Treaty with the Chippewa, 7 Stat. 537(emphasis added).

This language more closely resembles the language of theBig Tree Treaty at issue in

Kennedy. Although Minnesota'sregulatory authority is not at issue here, in the appropriate

case we must explain whether reserved treaty privilegeslimit States' ability to regulate Indians' off-reservation usufructuary activities in the same way as a treaty reservingrights.

that the Treaties at issue in Puyallup Tribe and Tulee provided express
federal law to the contrary, while the Treaty in Kennedy did not.

position that treaty rights are "more substantial vested rights than treaty

227OCTOBER TERM, 1998
Syllabus

JONES v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 97-6203. Argued October 5, 1998--Decided March 24, 1999
Petitioner was charged with, inter alia, carjacking, in violation of 18

U. S. C. $ 2119, which at the time provided, as relevant here, that a person possessing a firearm who "takes a motor vehicle . . . from the person
or presence of another by force and violence or by intimidation . . .
shall--(1) be . . . imprisoned not more than 15 years . . . , (2) if serious
bodily injury . . . results, be . . . imprisoned not more than 25 years . . . ,
and (3) if death results, be . . . imprisoned for any number of years up
to life . . . ." The indictment made no reference to $ 2119's numbered
subsections and charged none of the facts mentioned in the latter two.
Petitioner was told at the arraignment that he faced a maximum 15-year
sentence for carjacking, and the jury instructions at his trial defined
that offense by reference solely to $ 2119(1). After he was found guilty,
however, the District Court imposed a 25-year sentence on the carjacking charge because one victim suffered serious bodily injury. The court
rejected petitioner's objection that serious bodily injury was an element
of the offense, which had been neither pleaded in the indictment nor
proven before the jury. In affirming, the Ninth Circuit agreed that

$ 2119(2) set out a sentencing factor, not an element of an independent
offense.

Held: Section 2119 establishes three separate offenses by the specification of elements, each of which must be charged by indictment, proven
beyond a reasonable doubt, and submitted to a jury for its verdict.
Pp. 232-252.

(a) The superficial impression that $ 2119's subsections are only sentencing provisions loses clarity when one looks at subsections (2) and
(3), which not only provide for steeply higher penalties, but condition
them on further facts (injury, death) that seem quite as important as
the elements in the principal paragraph (force, violence, intimidation).
The Government stresses that the numbered subsections do not stand
alone in defining offenses, most of whose elements are set out in the
statute's opening paragraph, and that this integrated structure suggests
that the statute establishes only a single offense. The Government also
argues that the numbered subsections come after the word "shall,"
which often divides offense-defining provisions from those that specify
sentences. A number of countervailing structural considerations, how526US1 Unit: $U40 [12-13-00 19:26:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN
228 JONES v. UNITED STATES

Syllabus
ever, weaken those points. First, if the shorter subsection (2) does not
stand alone, neither does $ 2119's more voluminous first paragraph,
which by itself would merely describe some obnoxious behavior, never
actually telling the reader that it is a crime. Only the numbered
subsections complete the thought. Second, "shall" does not invariably
separate offense-defining clauses from sentencing provisions. Section
2119's text alone does not justify any confident inference. Statutory
drafting, however, occurs against a backdrop not merely of structural
conventions of varying significance, but of traditional treatment of certain categories of important facts, like degree of injury to victims, in
relation to particular crimes. If a statute is unclear about whether it
treats a fact as element or penalty aggravator, it makes sense to look at
what other statutes have done, since Congress is unlikely to intend any
radical departures from past practice without making a point of saying
so. See Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U. S. 224, 230. Here,
a search for comparable examples suggests that Congress had separate
and aggravated offenses in mind when it employed numbered subsections in $ 2119, for it unmistakably identified serious bodily injury or
related facts of violence as an offense element in several other federal
statutes, including two of the three robbery statutes on which it modeled the carjacking statute. This conclusion is bolstered by the States'
practice of treating serious bodily injury as an element defining a distinct offense of aggravated robbery. Neither a 1996 amendment to the
statute nor the statute's legislative history supports the Government's
reading. Pp. 232-239.

(b) The Government's construction of the statute would raise a serious constitutional question under the Fifth Amendment's Due Process
Clause and the Sixth Amendment's notice and jury trial guarantees:
when a jury determination has not been waived, may judicial factfinding
by a preponderance support the application of a provision that increases
the potential severity of the penalty for a variant of a given crime?
Although this question has been recognized in a series of cases over the
past quarter century, see, e. g., Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U. S. 684, it has
not been resolved by those cases, see, e. g., Almendarez-Torres v. United
States, supra. Any doubt on the issue of statutory construction should
thus be resolved in favor of avoiding the question, under the rule that,
"where a statute is susceptible of two constructions, by one of which
grave and doubtful constitutional questions arise and by the other of
which such questions are avoided, [this Court's] duty is to adopt the
latter." United States ex rel. Attorney General v. Delaware & Hudson
Co., 213 U. S. 366, 408. Pp. 239-252.

Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case turns on whether the federal carjacking statute,18 U. S. C. $ 2119, as it was when petitioner was charged,

defined three distinct offenses or a single crime with a choiceof three maximum penalties, two of them dependent on sentencing factors exempt from the requirements of charge andjury verdict. We think the better reading is of three distinct offenses, particularly in light of the rule that any inter-pretive uncertainty should be resolved to avoid serious questions about the statute's constitutionality.

In December 1992, petitioner, Nathaniel Jones, and twoothers, Oliver and McMillan, held up two men, Mutanna and

Mardaie. While Jones and McMillan went through the vic-tims' pockets, Oliver stuck his gun in Mutanna's left ear, and
later struck him on the head. Oliver and McMillan madetheir getaway in the Cadillac Jones had driven to the scene,

A grand jury in the Eastern District of California indictedJones and his two accomplices on two counts: using or aiding
and abetting the use of a firearm during and in relation toa crime of violence, in violation of 18 U. S. C. $ 924(c), and
carjacking or aiding and abetting carjacking, in violation of18 U. S. C. $ 2119, which then read as follows:

"Whoever, possessing a firearm as defined in section921 of this title, takes a motor vehicle that has been
transported, shipped, or received in interstate or foreigncommerce from the person or presence of another by
force and violence or by intimidation, or attempts to doso, shall--

"(1) be fined under this title or imprisoned not morethan 15 years, or both,

Opinion of the Court
Jones that he faced a maximum sentence of 15 years on thecarjacking charge. App. 4-5, 7. Consistently with this advice, the District Court's subsequent jury instructions de-fined the elements subject to the Government's burden of
proof by reference solely to the first paragraph of $ 2119,with no mention of serious bodily injury.

Id., at 10. Thejury found Jones guilty on both counts.

The case took a new turn, however, with the arrival of thepresentence report, which recommended that petitioner be
sentenced to 25 years for the carjacking because one of thevictims had suffered serious bodily injury. The report
noted that Mutanna had testified that Oliver's gun caused
profuse bleeding in Mutanna's ear, and that a physician hadconcluded that Mutanna had suffered a perforated eardrum,

with some numbness and permanent hearing loss. Id., at15-16; 60 F. 3d, at 554. Jones objected that the 25-year recommendation was out of bounds, since serious bodily injurywas an element of the offense defined in part by $ 2119(2),
which had been neither pleaded in the indictment nor provenbefore the jury. App. 12-13. The District Court saw the
matter differently and, based on its finding that the serious
bodily injury allegation was supported by a preponderanceof the evidence, imposed a 25-year sentence on the carjacking

count, ibid., together with a consecutive 5-year sentence forthe firearm offense, 60 F. 3d, at 549.

Like the trial court, the Court of Appeals did not read$ 2119(2) as setting out an element of an independent offense.2 Id., at 551-554. The Ninth Circuit thus agreedwith the Eleventh, see

United States v. Williams, 51 F. 3d

Court of Appeals affirmed. App. 41-43; judgt. order reported at 116 F. 3d

the statute, particularly the grammatical dependence of thenumbered subsections on the first paragraph, demonstrated

Congress's understanding that the subsections did not com-plete the definitions of separate crimes. 60 F. 3d, at 552-
553. For its view that the subsections provided sentencingfactors, the court found additional support in the statute's
legislative history. The heading on the subtitle of the billcreating $ 2119 was "Enhanced Penalties for Auto Theft,"
which the court took as indicating that the statute's num-bered subsections merely defined sentencing enhancements.
Id., at 553. The court also noted several references in theCommittee Reports and floor debate on the bill to enhanced
penalties for an apparently single carjacking offense. Ibid.Because of features arguably distinguishing this case from
Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U. S. 224 (1998), wegranted certiorari, 523 U. S. 1045 (1998), and now reverse.

II
Much turns on the determination that a fact is an elementof an offense rather than a sentencing consideration, given

that elements must be charged in the indictment, submittedto a jury, and proven by the Government beyond a reasonable doubt. See, e. g., Hamling v. United States, 418 U. S.87, 117 (1974);

United States v. Gaudin, 515 U. S. 506, 509-510 (1995). Accordingly, some statutes come with the benefit of provisions straightforwardly addressing the distinctionbetween elements and sentencing factors. See McMillan v.
Pennsylvania, 477 U. S. 79, 85-86 (1986) (express identifica-tion of statutory provision as sentencing factor). Even
without any such help, however, $ 2119 at first glance has alook to it suggesting that the numbered subsections are only
sentencing provisions. It begins with a principal paragraphlisting a series of obvious elements (possession of a firearm,
taking a motor vehicle, connection with interstate commerce,and so on). That paragraph comes close to standing on its
own, followed by sentencing provisions, the first of which,

526US1 Unit: $U40 [12-13-00 19:26:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN

233Cite as: 526 U. S. 227 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
subsection (1), certainly adds no further element. But thesuperficial impression loses clarity when one looks at the

penalty subsections (2) and (3). These not only provide forsteeply higher penalties, but condition them on further facts
(injury, death) that seem quite as important as the elements
in the principal paragraph (e. g., force and violence, intimida-tion). It is at best questionable whether the specification of

facts sufficient to increase a penalty range by two-thirds, letalone from 15 years to life, was meant to carry none of the
process safeguards that elements of an offense bring withthem for a defendant's benefit. The "look" of the statute,
then, is not a reliable guide to congressional intentions, and
the Government accordingly advances two, more subtle
structural arguments for its position that the fact specified
in subsection (2) is merely a sentencing factor.

Like the Court of Appeals, the Government stresses that
the statute's numbered subsections do not stand alone in
defining offenses, most of whose elements on anyone's reckoning are set out in the statute's opening paragraph. This
integrated structure is said to suggest that the statute
establishes only a single offense. To the same point, the
Government argues that the numbered subsections come
after the word "shall," which often divides offense-defining
provisions from those that specify sentences. Brief for
United States 15-18. While these points are sound enough
as far as they go, they are far short of dispositive even on
their own terms, whereas they are weakened here by a number of countervailing structural considerations. First, as
petitioner notes, Reply Brief for Petitioner 1-2, if the shorter
subsection (2) of $ 2119 does not stand alone, neither does the
section's more voluminous first paragraph. In isolation, it
would merely describe some very obnoxious behavior, leaving any reader assuming that it must be a crime, but never
being actually told that it is. Only the numbered subsidiary
provisions complete the thought. Section 2119 is thus unlike most offense-defining provisions in the federal criminal

Opinion of the Court
code, which genuinely stand on their own grammatical feetthanks to phrases such as "shall be unlawful," see,

e. g., 18
U. S. C. $ 922(g), "shall be punished," see, e. g., $ 511A(a), or"shall be guilty of," see,

e. g., 18 U. S. C. $ 514 (1994 ed.,
Supp. II), which draw a provision to its close. Second, as
for the significance of the word "shall," although it frequentlyseparates offense-defining clauses from sentencing provisions, it hardly does so invariably. One of the robberystatutes that served as a model for $ 2119,

3 see 18 U. S. C.

$$ 2118(a)(3), (b)(3), for example, places elements of the of-fense on either side of "shall." And, of course, where the

supposedly "elements" side is itself grammatically incom-plete (as here), the placement of "shall" is oddly equivocal.
Indeed, both the Government and the Courts of Appealstreat the statute perhaps most closely resembling this one,

$ 1365(a) (consumer tampering), as defining basic and aggravated offenses, one of which is defined in terms of seriousbodily injury. See,

e. g., United States v. Meling, 47 F. 3d
1546, 1551 (CA9 1995).These clues derived from attention to structure and parsing of wording, like those the dissent holds up to distinguishthe carjacking act both from the robbery statutes upon
which it was modeled and state aggravated robbery statutes,see

post, at 260-262, 263-264 (opinion of Kennedy, J.), turn
out to move us only so far in our effort to infer congressional
intent. The text alone does not justify any confident infer-ence. But statutory drafting occurs against a backdrop not

merely of structural conventions of varying significance, butof traditional treatment of certain categories of important
facts, like the degree of injury to victims of crime, in relation to
particular crimes. If a given statute is unclear about treating
such a fact as element or penalty aggravator, it makes sense
to look at what other statutes have done, on the fair assumption that Congress is unlikely to intend any radical departures from past practice without making a point of saying so.

Opinion of the Court
We engaged in just such an enquiry this past Term inAlmendarez-Torres, where we stressed the history of treating recidivism as a sentencing factor, and noted that, withperhaps one exception, Congress had never clearly made
prior conviction an offense element where the offense con-duct, in the absence of recidivism, was independently unlawful. 523 U. S., at 230. Here, on the contrary, the search forcomparable examples more readily suggests that Congress
had separate and aggravated offenses in mind when it em-ployed the scheme of numbered subsections in $ 2119. Although Congress has explicitly treated serious bodily injuryas a sentencing factor, see,

e. g., 18 U. S. C. $ 2262(b)(2) (inter-state violation of a protection order); $ 248(b)(2) (free access

to clinic entrances; bodily injury), it has unmistakably identi-fied serious bodily injury as an offense element in any number of statutes, see, e. g., 10 U. S. C. $ 928(b)(2) (assault by amember of the armed forces); 18 U. S. C. $ 37(a)(1) (violence
at international airports); $ 1091(a)(2) (genocide). The like-lihood that Congress understood injury to be an offense
element here follows all the more from the fact that carjack-ing is a type of robbery, and serious bodily injury has traditionally been treated, both by Congress and by the statelegislatures, as defining an element of the offense of aggravated robbery. As the Government acknowledges, Brief forUnited States 20-21, and n. 8, Congress modeled the federal
carjacking statute on several other federal robbery statutes.4One of them, 18 U. S. C. $ 2118 (robbery involving controlled
substances), clearly makes causing serious bodily injury an
element of the offense. It provides that "[w]hoever takes or
attempts to take from the person or presence of another byforce or violence or by intimidation any [of certain controlled

4 Legislative history identifies three such models. See H. R. Rep.
No. 102-851, pt. 1, p. 17 (1992) ("The definition of the offense tracks the
language used in other federal robbery statutes (18 U. S. C. $$ 2111, 2113,
2118)"). One of them, 18 U. S. C. $ 2111 (robbery in areas of federal maritime or territorial jurisdiction), lacks aggravated forms of the offense altogether, and thus is not on point here.

substances] shall . . . be fined . . . or imprisoned not morethan twenty years, or both, if (1) the replacement cost of the

[controlled substance] was not less than $500, . . . or (3) an-other person was killed or suffered significant bodily injury
as a result of such taking or attempt." $ 2118(a)(3); see also

$ 2118(b)(3).5 A second model, $ 2113 (bank robbery), as theGovernment concedes, see Brief for United States 17, makes

related facts of violence, that is, assault and jeopardizing lifeby using a dangerous weapon, elements defining an aggravated form of that type of robbery. See $$ 2113(d), (e);cf.

Almendarez-Torres, supra, at 231 (citing bank robbery
statute as example of statute establishing greater and lesserincluded offenses);

McMillan, 477 U. S., at 88 (contrasting

$ 2113(d) with provision defining a sentencing enhancement).When pressed at oral argument, the Government proved

unable to explain why Congress might have chosen one treatment of serious bodily harm or violence in defining two of the
three offenses it used as its models for $ 2119 and a different
treatment in writing the carjacking statute itself, see Tr. of
Oral Arg. 41-44, and we are unable to imagine a convincing
reason ourselves. We thus think it fair to say that, as in the
earlier robbery statutes, so in the carjacking statute, Congress probably intended serious bodily injury to be an element defining an aggravated form of the crime.

State practice bolsters the conclusion. Many States use
causation of serious bodily injury or harm as an element defining a distinct offense of aggravated robbery. See, e. g.,
Ala. Code $ 13A-8-41(a)(2) (1994) (robbery in the first degree
defined in part by the causing of "serious physical injury");

5 The dissent, in passing, questions our view that $ 2118(a) makes the
causing of significant bodily injury an element of the offense defined by
that section, see post, at 261-262, but it offers no reason to doubt our
reading. Given that $ 2118(a) establishes only one maximum punishment,
and that it makes eligibility for such punishment contingent on the establishment of at least one of three facts, one of which is the causing of death
or significant bodily injury, we think our reading is the only sensible one.

Rev. Code $ 9A.56.200(1)(c) (1994) (robbery in the first degree; "[i]nflicts bodily injury"). While the state practice is
not, admittedly, direct authority for reading the federal carjacking statute, it does show that in treating serious bodily
injury as an element, Congress would have been treading a
well-worn path.

Despite these indications and the equivocal structural
clues, the Government suggests that a 1996 amendment supports its reading of the carjacking statute as previously
enacted. In the Carjacking Correction Act of 1996, 110 Stat.
3020, Congress provided that the term "serious bodily injury" in subsection (2) should include sexual abuse and aggravated sexual abuse as defined in $$ 2241 and 2242. The
Government points to several statements in the 1996 amendment's legislative history in which subsection (2) is described
as providing a "penalty enhancement," see, e. g., H. R. Rep.
No. 104-787, pp. 2, 3 (1996), as showing that subsection (2)

526US1 Unit: $U40 [12-13-00 19:26:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN
238 JONES v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
defines a sentencing factor. Even those of us disposed totreat legislative history as authority, however, find the

quoted statements unimpressive. Assuming that "penaltyenhancement" was meant to be synonymous with "sentencing factor," the legislative history also contains contrary indications in some of the statements made by the 1996 amend-ment's sponsors, suggesting an assumption that subsection

(2) established an element or elements that had to be provenat trial. See 142 Cong. Rec. 19769 (1996) (statement of Sen.
Biden) ("[T]he defendant had been convicted of raping thewoman" (emphasis added)). This hardly seems the occasion
to doubt that "subsequent legislative history is a `hazardous
basis for inferring the intent of an earlier' Congress." Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation v. LTV Corp., 496 U. S.
633, 650 (1990) (quoting United States v. Price, 361 U. S. 304,
313 (1960)). Indeed, our leeriness of relying on hindsight
expressed in legislative history is only confirmed by recognizing what oddity there would be in defining the fact of
serious bodily injury by reference to a distinct offense with
its own offense elements, like sexual abuse, while at the same
time assuming that the fact so defined is merely a sentencing consideration.

Nor do we think the legislative history that attracted the
Court of Appeals is any more helpful to the Government.
See 60 F. 3d, at 553. The Committee Reports and floor debate on the statute refer to its augmentation of the criminal
law in the singular, not the plural, speaking only of a new
federal "crime" or "offense" of carjacking in the singular.
See, e. g., H. R. Rep. No. 102-851, pt. 1, p. 17 (1992); 138 Cong.
Rec. 32500 (1992) (statement of Rep. Dingell). But what we
make of the singular-plural distinction turns on the circumstances. Characterizing a cluster of provisions as enacting
something to be described by the singular terms "offense"
or "crime" would signify a good deal if the speakers or writers were addressing a point on which the distinction mattered. That is not, however, what they were doing in the

Opinion of the Court
passages cited, where those references couched in the singu-lar did not occur in discussions of the issue of offense elements versus sentencing factors that we confront here. So,we think their significance is slight. On the subject of legislative history, we should add that we see nothing favorableto the Government in the fact that the statement in the
House Report explaining that the drafters of the carjackingstatute drew on the examples of other federal robbery statutes referred to an early version of the carjacking statutewhen it lacked any reference to the aggravated forms of the
offense now defined by subsections (2) and (3). See H. R.Rep. No. 102-851,

supra, at 17. As against the suggestionthat Congress looked to the earlier robbery statutes only

when it settled on the language contained in the carjackingstatute's first paragraph, we think it would have been
strange for Congress to find guidance in the other robberystatutes at the beginning of the legislative process and then
just forget about them. As the Government itself suggestsin a somewhat different context, there is no reason to think
that Congress "might have abandoned [those] ready federalmodels" in developing the more fully elaborated version of
the statute that it ultimately adopted. Brief for UnitedStates 21, n. 8.

III
While we think the fairest reading of $ 2119 treats the factof serious bodily harm as an element, not a mere enhancement, we recognize the possibility of the other view. Anydoubt that might be prompted by the arguments for that
other reading should, however, be resolved against it underthe rule, repeatedly affirmed, that "where a statute is susceptible of two constructions, by one of which grave anddoubtful constitutional questions arise and by the other of
which such questions are avoided, our duty is to adopt thelatter." United States ex rel. Attorney General v. Delaware & Hudson Co., 213 U. S. 366, 408 (1909); see also UnitedStates v. Jin Fuey Moy, 241 U. S. 394, 401 (1916). It is "out

of respect for Congress, which we assume legislates in thelight of constitutional limitations,"

Rust v. Sullivan, 500
U. S. 173, 191 (1991), that we adhere to this principle, which"has for so long been applied by this Court that it is beyond

debate." Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast
Building & Constr. Trades Council, 485 U. S. 568, 575 (1988);see also

United States v. X-Citement Video, Inc., 513 U. S.
64, 78 (1994).As the Government would have us construe it, the statute

would be open to constitutional doubt in light of a series ofcases over the past quarter century, dealing with due process
and the guarantee of trial by jury. The first of these, Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U. S. 684 (1975), reviewed a Maine murder
statute providing that the element of malice (in the sense of
want of provocation, Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S. 197,
215 (1977)) would be presumed upon proof of intent to kill
resulting in death, subject to a defendant's right of rebuttal
that he had acted on provocation in the heat of passion,
which would reduce the offense to manslaughter. Mullaney, supra, at 686, and n. 3. The challenge was that the
presumption subject to rebuttal relieved the State of its due
process burden to prove every element of the crime beyond
a reasonable doubt, as explained in In re Winship, 397 U. S.
358, 364 (1970). The State replied that the challenge was
merely formalistic, that the State's law in effect established
a generic crime of felonious homicide, Mullaney, supra, at
688, 696-697, on which view the fact subject to presumption
and rebuttal would have gone simply to sentence, and
Winship would not have been controlling. But the Court
declined to accord the State this license to recharacterize the
issue, in part because the State's reading left its statute at
odds both with the centuries-old common law recognition of
malice as the fact distinguishing murder from manslaughter
and with the widely held modern view that heat of passion,
once raised by the evidence, was a subject of the State's burden, 421 U. S., at 692-696, and in part because an unlimited

Opinion of the Court
choice over characterizing a stated fact as an element wouldleave the State substantially free to manipulate its way out

of Winship, 421 U. S., at 698.Two Terms later, in

Patterson v. New York, supra, the
Court ruled on a Winship challenge to a scheme defining
murder as causing death with intent, subject to an affirma-tive defense of extreme emotional disturbance for which

there was a reasonable explanation. 432 U. S., at 205-206.Unlike Maine's law, New York's raised no presumption of
malice; malice was omitted from the elements of murder.Patterson contended that because the presence or absence of
an extreme emotional disturbance affected the severity of
sentence, Winship and Mullaney required the State to prove
the absence of that fact beyond a reasonable doubt. We rejected this argument and "decline[d] to adopt as a constitutional imperative . . . that a State must disprove beyond a
reasonable doubt every fact constituting any and all affirmative defenses related to the culpability of an accused." 432
U. S., at 210. We identified the use of a presumption to establish an essential ingredient of the offense as the curse of
the Maine law, because the "shifting of the burden of persuasion with respect to a fact which the State deems so important that it must be either proved or presumed is impermissible under the Due Process Clause." Id., at 215. With one
caveat, therefore, Patterson left the States free to choose
the elements that define their crimes, without any impediment from Winship. The caveat was a stated recognition of
some limit upon state authority to reallocate the traditional
burden of proof, 432 U. S., at 210, which in that case was
easily satisfied by the fact that "at common law the burden
of proving" the mitigating circumstances of severe emotional
disturbance "rested on the defendant." Id., at 202; see also
id., at 211; Mullaney, supra, at 693-694. While a narrow
reading of this limit might have been no more than a ban on
using presumptions to reduce elements to the point of being
nominal, a broader reading was equally open, that the State

526US1 Unit: $U40 [12-13-00 19:26:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN
242 JONES v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
lacked the discretion to omit "traditional" elements from thedefinition of crimes and instead to require the accused to

disprove such elements.These cases about allocation of burden, with their implications about the charging obligation and the requisite quantum of proof, were succeeded by McMillan v. Pennsylvania,477 U. S. 79 (1986), in which the

Winship issue rose from a
provision that a judge's finding (by a preponderance) of visi-ble possession of a firearm would require a mandatory minimum sentence for certain felonies, but a minimum that fellwithin the sentencing ranges otherwise prescribed. Although the Court rejected the petitioner's claim insofar as it
would have required a finding beyond a reasonable doubt of
any fact upon which a mandatory minimum sentence depended (and rejected certain subsidiary arguments as well),
it did observe that the result might have been different if
proof of visible possession had exposed a defendant to a sentence beyond the maximum that the statute otherwise set
without reference to that fact. 477 U. S., at 88.

McMillan is notable not only for acknowledging the question of due process requirements for factfinding that raises a
sentencing range, but also for disposing of a claim that the
Pennsylvania law violated the Sixth Amendment right to
jury trial as well. The petitioner's basic argument was for
a right to jury determination of all "ultimate facts concerning the offense committed," id., at 93, and although the Court
disposed of this by reference back to its due process discussion, that discussion had broached the potential constitutional significance of factfinding that raised the sentencing
ceiling.

McMillan, then, recognizes a question under both the Due
Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the jury
guarantee of the Sixth: when a jury determination has not
been waived, may judicial factfinding by a preponderance
support the application of a provision that increases the potential severity of the penalty for a variant of a given crime?

Opinion of the Court
The seriousness of the due process issue is evident from Mul-laney's insistence that a State cannot manipulate its way out

of Winship, and from Patterson's recognition of a limit onstate authority to reallocate traditional burdens of proof; the
substantiality of the jury claim is evident from the practicalimplications of assuming Sixth Amendment indifference to
treating a fact that sets the sentencing range as a sentencingfactor, not an element.

6

The terms of the carjacking statute illustrate very wellwhat is at stake. If serious bodily injury were merely a

sentencing factor under $ 2119(2) (increasing the authorizedpenalty by two thirds, to 25 years), then death would presumably be nothing more than a sentencing factor under sub-section (3) (increasing the penalty range to life). If a potential penalty might rise from 15 years to life on a nonjurydetermination, the jury's role would correspondingly shrink

6 The dissent repeatedly chides us for failing to state precisely enough
the principle animating our view that the carjacking statute, as construed
by the Government, may violate the Constitution. See post, at 254, 266,
277. The preceding paragraph in the text expresses that principle plainly
enough, and we restate it here: under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth
Amendment and the notice and jury trial guarantees of the Sixth Amendment, any fact (other than prior conviction) that increases the maximum
penalty for a crime must be charged in an indictment, submitted to a jury,
and proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Because our prior cases suggest
rather than establish this principle, our concern about the Government's
reading of the statute rises only to the level of doubt, not certainty.

Contrary to the dissent's suggestion, the constitutional proposition that
drives our concern in no way "call[s] into question the principle that the
definition of the elements of a criminal offense is entrusted to the legislature." Post, at 270 (internal quotation marks omitted). The constitutional guarantees that give rise to our concern in no way restrict the
ability of legislatures to identify the conduct they wish to characterize as
criminal or to define the facts whose proof is essential to the establishment
of criminal liability. The constitutional safeguards that figure in our analysis concern not the identity of the elements defining criminal liability
but only the required procedures for finding the facts that determine the
maximum permissible punishment; these are the safeguards going to the
formality of notice, the identity of the factfinder, and the burden of proof.

244 JONES v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
from the significance usually carried by determinations of
guilt to the relative importance of low-level gatekeeping: in
some cases, a jury finding of fact necessary for a maximum
15-year sentence would merely open the door to a judicial
finding sufficient for life imprisonment. It is therefore no
trivial question to ask whether recognizing an unlimited legislative power to authorize determinations setting ultimate
sentencing limits without a jury would invite erosion of the
jury's function to a point against which a line must necessarily be drawn.

The question might well be less serious than the constitutional doubt rule requires if the history bearing on the Framers' understanding of the Sixth Amendment principle demonstrated an accepted tolerance for exclusively judicial
factfinding to peg penalty limits. But such is not the history. To be sure, the scholarship of which we are aware
does not show that a question exactly like this one was ever
raised and resolved in the period before the framing. On
the other hand, several studies demonstrate that on a general level the tension between jury powers and powers exclusively judicial would likely have been very much to the fore
in the Framers' conception of the jury right.

The fact that we point to no statutes of the earlier time
exemplifying the distinction between elements and facts that
elevate sentencing ranges is unsurprising, given the breadth
of judicial discretion over fines and corporal punishment in
less important, misdemeanor cases, see, e. g., J. Baker, Introduction to English Legal History 584 (3d ed. 1990); 4
W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 372
(1769) (hereinafter Blackstone); Preyer, Penal Measures in
the American Colonies: An Overview, 26 Am. J. Legal Hist.

felony, see Langbein, The English Criminal Trial Jury on the
Eve of the French Revolution, in The Trial Jury in England,

1987); 4 Blackstone 238-239; A. Scott, Criminal Law in Colo-nial Virginia 27-28, 103-106 (1930).

Even in this system, however, competition developed be-tween judge and jury over the real significance of their respective roles. The potential or inevitable severity of sentences was indirectly checked by juries' assertions of amitigating power when the circumstances of a prosecution

pointed to political abuse of the criminal process or endoweda criminal conviction with particularly sanguinary consequences. This power to thwart Parliament and Crown tookthe form not only of flat-out acquittals in the face of guilt
but of what today we would call verdicts of guilty to lesserincluded offenses, manifestations of what Blackstone described as "pious perjury" on the jurors' part. 4 Blackstone
238-239.7Countervailing measures to diminish the juries' power

were naturally forthcoming, with ensuing responses both in
the mother country and in the Colonies that validate, though
they do not answer, the question that the Government's position here would raise. One such move on the Government's
side was a parliamentary practice of barring the right to
jury trial when defining new, statutory offenses. See, e. g.,
Frankfurter & Corcoran, Petty Federal Offenses and the
Constitutional Guaranty of Trial by Jury, 39 Harv. L. Rev.
917, 925-930 (1926); 4 Blackstone 277-279. This practice extended to violations of the Stamp Act and recurred in statutes regulating imperial trade, see C. Ubbelohde, ViceAdmiralty Courts and the American Revolution 16-21, 74-80
(1960); Wroth, The Massachusetts Vice Admiralty Court, in

Germany 1700-1900, pp. 41, 48-49 (A. Schioppa ed. 1987). For Colonial
American practice, see, e. g., J. Goebell & T. Naughton, Law Enforcement

Law and Authority in Colonial America 32, 50 (G. Billias ed.1965), and was one of the occasions for the protest in the

Declaration of Independence against deprivation of the bene-fit of jury trial, see P. Maier, American Scripture 118 (1997).
But even before the Declaration, a less revolutionary voice
than the Continental Congress had protested against the leg-islative practice, in words widely read in America. The use

of nonjury proceedings had "of late been so far extended,"Blackstone warned in the 1760's, "as, if a check be not timely
given, to threaten the disuse of our admirable and truly Eng-lish trial by jury." 4 Blackstone 278. Identifying trial by
jury as "the grand bulwark" of English liberties, Blackstone
contended that other liberties would remain secure only "so
long as this palladium remains sacred and inviolate, not only
from all open attacks, (which none will be so hardy as to
make) but also from all secret machinations, which may sap
and undermine it; by introducing new and arbitrary methods
of trial, by justices of the peace, commissioners of the revenue, and courts of conscience. And however convenient
these may appear at first, (as doubtless all arbitrary powers,
well executed, are the most convenient), yet let it be again
remembered, that delays, and little inconveniences in the
forms of justice, are the price that all free nations must
pay for their liberty in more substantial matters." Id., at
342-344.

A second response to the juries' power to control outcomes
occurred in attempts to confine jury determinations in libel
cases to findings of fact, leaving it to the judges to apply the
law and, thus, to limit the opportunities for juror nullification. Ultimately, of course, the attempt failed, the juries'
victory being embodied in Fox's Libel Act in Britain, see
generally T. Green, Verdict According to Conscience 318-355
(1985), and exemplified in John Peter Zenger's acquittal in
the Colonies, see, e. g., J. Rakove, Original Meanings 300-302
(1996). It is significant here not merely that the denouement of the restrictive efforts left the juries in control, but

526US1 Unit: $U40 [12-13-00 19:26:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
that the focus of those efforts was principally the juries' con-trol over the ultimate verdict, applying law to fact (or "finding" the law, see, e. g., id., at 301), and not the factfindingrole itself.

8 There was apparently some accepted understanding at the time that the finding of facts was simply toosacred a jury prerogative to be trifled with in prosecution

for such a significant and traditional offense in the commonlaw courts.9 That this history had to be in the minds of theFramers is beyond cavil. According to one authority, the

leading account of Zenger's trial was, with one possible ex-ception, "the most widely known source of libertarian
thought in England and America during the eighteenth cen-tury." L. Levy, Freedom of Speech and Press in Early
American History 133 (1963). It is just as much beyond

8 The principle that the jury were the judges of fact and the judges the
deciders of law was stated as an established principle as early as 1628 by
Coke. See 1 E. Coke, Institutes of the Laws of England 155b (1628) ("ad
questionem facti non respondent judices; ad questionem juris non respondent juratores"). See also Langbein, The English Criminal Trial
Jury on the Eve of the French Revolution, in The Trial Jury in England,
France, Germany, supra, at 34, n. 60. Even the traditional, juryrestrictive view of libel law recognized the jury's authority over matters
of fact. See, e. g., King v. Francklin, 17 How. St. Tr. 626, 672 (K. B. 1731)
("These [publications and the words having the meaning ascribed to them]
are the two matters of fact that come under your consideration; and of
which you are proper judges. But then there is a third thing, to wit,
Whether these defamatory expressions amount to a libel or not? This
does not belong to the office of the jury, but to the office of the Court;
because it is a matter of law, and not of fact; and of which the Court are
the only proper judges"). Thus most participants in the struggle over
jury autonomy in seditious libel cases viewed the debate as concerned with
the extent of the jury's law-finding power, not its unquestioned role as the
determiner of factual issues. See T. Green, Verdict According to Conscience 318-319 (1985). Some influential jurists suggested that it might
also be seen as a struggle over the jury's right to find a particular fact,
namely, the required criminal intent. See 10 W. Holdsworth, History of
English Law 680-683 (1938).

9 See 4 Blackstone 354 ( jurors could choose to stop at special verdicts if

they wished).

Opinion of the Court
question that Americans of the period perfectly well understood the lesson that the jury right could be lost not only by
gross denial, but by erosion. See supra, at 245-247. One
contributor to the ratification debates, for example, commenting on the jury trial guarantee in Art. III, $ 2, echoed
Blackstone in warning of the need "to guard with the most
jealous circumspection against the introduction of new, and
arbitrary methods of trial, which, under a variety of plausible
pretenses, may in time, imperceptibly undermine this best
preservative of LIBERTY." A [New Hampshire] Farmer,
No. 3, June 6, 1788, quoted in The Complete Bill of Rights
477 (N. Cogan ed. 1997).

In sum, there is reason to suppose that in the present circumstances, however peculiar their details to our time and
place, the relative diminution of the jury's significance would
merit Sixth Amendment concern. It is not, of course, that
anyone today would claim that every fact with a bearing on
sentencing must be found by a jury; we have resolved that
general issue and have no intention of questioning its resolution. The point is simply that diminishment of the jury's
significance by removing control over facts determining a
statutory sentencing range would resonate with the claims
of earlier controversies, to raise a genuine Sixth Amendment
issue not yet settled.

Our position that the Sixth Amendment and due process
issues are by no means by the boards calls for a word about
several cases that followed McMillan. Almendarez-Torres
v. United States, 523 U. S. 224 (1998), decided last Term,
stands for the proposition that not every fact expanding a
penalty range must be stated in a felony indictment, the precise holding being that recidivism increasing the maximum
penalty need not be so charged. But the case is not dispositive of the question here, not merely because we are concerned with the Sixth Amendment right to jury trial and
not alone the rights to indictment and notice as claimed by

526US1 Unit: $U40 [12-13-00 19:26:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN

249Cite as: 526 U. S. 227 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
Almendarez-Torres, but because the holding last Termrested in substantial part on the tradition of regarding recidivism as a sentencing factor, not as an element to be set outin the indictment. The Court's repeated emphasis on the
distinctive significance of recidivism leaves no question thatthe Court regarded that fact as potentially distinguishable
for constitutional purposes from other facts that might ex-tend the range of possible sentencing. See

id., at 230 ("Atthe outset, we note that the relevant statutory subject matter is recidivism"); ibid. ("With recidivism as the subjectmatter in mind, we turn to the statute's language"); id., at
243 ("First, the sentencing factor at issue here--recidivism--is a traditional, if not the most traditional, basis for a sentencing court's increasing an offender's sentence"); id., at 245(distinguishing

McMillan "in light of the particular sentenc-ing factor at issue in this case--recidivism"). One basis for

that possible constitutional distinctiveness is not hard tosee: unlike virtually any other consideration used to enlarge
the possible penalty for an offense, and certainly unlike thefactor before us in this case, a prior conviction must itself

have been established through procedures satisfying thefair notice, reasonable doubt, and jury trial guarantees.
Almendarez-Torres cannot, then, be read to resolve the dueprocess and Sixth Amendment questions implicated by reading the carjacking statute as the Government urges.10

10 The dissent insists that Almendarez-Torres "controls the question before us," post, at 266, but in substantiating that assertion, it tellingly relies
more heavily on the claims of the Almendarez-Torres dissenters than on
the statements of the Almendarez-Torres majority. Neither source bears
out the current dissent's conclusion. If, as the dissenters in this case suggest, Almendarez-Torres did not turn on the particular "sentencing factor
at issue" there, 523 U. S., at 243, but instead stood for the broad proposition that any fact increasing the maximum permissible punishment may
be determined by a judge by a preponderance, it is a mystery why the
Almendarez-Torres majority engaged in so much discussion of recidivism,
or why, at the crux of its constitutional discussion, it turned first to discuss

Opinion of the Court
Nor is the question resolved by a series of three casesdealing with factfinding in capital sentencing. The first of

these, Spaziano v. Florida, 468 U. S. 447 (1984), contains nodiscussion of the sort of factfinding before us in this case.
It addressed the argument that capital sentencing must be ajury task and rejected that position on the ground that capital sentencing is like sentencing in other cases, being a choiceof the appropriate disposition, as against an alternative or a
range of alternatives. Id., at 459.

Spaziano was followed in a few years by Hildwin v. Flor-ida, 490 U. S. 638 (1989) (per curiam), holding that the determination of death-qualifying aggravating facts could be en-trusted to a judge, following a verdict of guilty of murder
and a jury recommendation of death, without violating theSixth Amendment's jury clause. Although citing

Spazianoas authority, 490 U. S., at 639-640, Hildwin was the first case

to deal expressly with factfinding necessary to authorize im-position of the more severe of alternative sentences, and thus
arguably comparable to factfinding necessary to expand thesentencing range available on conviction of a lesser crime
than murder. Even if we were satisfied that the analogywas sound,

Hildwin could not drive the answer to the SixthAmendment question raised by the Government's position

here. In Hildwin, a jury made a sentencing recommenda-tion of death, thus necessarily engaging in the factfinding
required for imposition of a higher sentence, that is, the dethe "tradition" of recidivism's treatment as a sentencing factor, ibid., or
why it never announced the unqualified holding that today's dissenters
claim to find in it. Admittedly, as the dissent here notes, the dissenters
in Almendarez-Torres criticized the majority for what they considered
the majority's unsupportable restraint in restricting their holding to recidivism. But that very criticism would have lacked its target if the
Almendarez-Torres majority had not so doggedly refrained from endorsing the general principle the dissent in this case now attributes to them.
The majority and the dissenters in Almendarez-Torres disagreed over the
legitimacy of the Court's decision to restrict its holding to recidivism, but
both sides agreed that the Court had done just that.

Opinion of the Court
termination that at least one aggravating factor had beenproved. Hildwin, therefore, can hardly be read as resolving

the issue discussed here, as the reasoning in Walton v. Ari-zona, 497 U. S. 639 (1990), confirms.

Walton dealt with an argument only slightly less expan-sive than the one in

Spaziano, that every finding underlyinga sentencing determination must be made by a jury. Although the Court's rejection of that position cited Hildwin,it characterized the nature of capital sentencing by quoting
from Poland v. Arizona, 476 U. S. 147, 156 (1986). See 497U. S., at 648. There, the Court described statutory specifications of aggravating circumstances in capital sentencing as"standards to guide the . . . choice between the alternative
verdicts of death and life imprisonment." Ibid. (quoting
Poland, supra, at 156 (internal quotation marks omitted)).The Court thus characterized the finding of aggravating

facts falling within the traditional scope of capital sentencingas a choice between a greater and a lesser penalty, not as a
process of raising the ceiling of the sentencing range avail-able. We are frank to say that we emphasize this careful
reading of Walton's rationale because the question impli-cated by the Government's position on the meaning of

$ 2119(2) is too significant to be decided without beingsquarely faced.

In sum, the Government's view would raise serious consti-tutional questions on which precedent is not dispositive.
Any doubt on the issue of statutory construction is hence tobe resolved in favor of avoiding those questions.

11 In tones of alarm, the dissent suggests, see post, at 254, 271, that our
decision will unsettle the efforts of many States to bring greater consistency to their sentencing practices through provisions for determinate sentences and statutorily or administratively established guidelines governing sentencing decisions. The dissent's concern is misplaced for several
reasons. Most immediately, our decision today does not announce any
new principle of constitutional law, but merely interprets a particular federal statute in light of a set of constitutional concerns that have emerged
through a series of our decisions over the past quarter century. But even

done by construing $ 2119 as establishing three separate of-fenses by the specification of distinct elements, each of which

must be charged by indictment, proven beyond a reasonabledoubt, and submitted to a jury for its verdict. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is accordingly reversed, andthe case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this
opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice Stevens, concurring.
Like Justice Scalia, see post, at 253, I am convinced thatit is unconstitutional for a legislature to remove from the

jury the assessment of facts that increase the prescribedrange of penalties to which a criminal defendant is exposed.

if we assume that the question we raise will someday be followed by the
answer the dissenters seem to fear, that answer would in no way hinder
the States (or the National Government) from choosing to pursue policies
aimed at rationalizing sentencing practices. If the constitutional concern
we have expressed should lead to a rule requiring jury determination of
facts that raise a sentencing ceiling, that rule would in no way constrain
legislative authority to identify the facts relevant to punishment or to
establish fixed penalties. The constitutional guarantees that prompt our
interpretation bear solely on the procedures by which the facts that raise
the possible penalty are to be found, that is, what notice must be given,
who must find the facts, and what burden must be satisfied to demonstrate
them. Finally, while we disagree with the dissent's dire prediction about
the effect of our decision on the States' ability to choose certain sentencing
policies, it should go without saying that, if such policies conflict with safeguards enshrined in the Constitution for the protection of the accused,
those policies have to yield to the constitutional guarantees. See, e. g.,
Burch v. Louisiana, 441 U. S. 130, 139 (1979) (Nonunanimous verdicts by
six-person criminal juries "sufficiently threate[n] the constitutional principles [animating the jury trial guarantee] that any countervailing interest
of the State should yield"); cf. Almeida-Sanchez v. United States, 413 U. S.
266, 273 (1973) ("The needs of law enforcement stand in constant tension
with the Constitution's protections of the individual against certain exercises of official power. It is precisely the predictability of these pressures
that counsels a resolute loyalty to constitutional safeguards").

It is equally clear that such facts must be established byproof beyond a reasonable doubt. That is the essence of the

Court's holdings in In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358 (1970), Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U. S. 684 (1975), and Patterson v. New
York, 432 U. S. 197 (1977). To permit anything less "with
respect to a fact which the State deems so important that it
must be either proved or presumed is impermissible under
the Due Process Clause." Id., at 215. This principle was
firmly embedded in our jurisprudence through centuries of
common-law decisions. See, e. g., Winship, 397 U. S., at 361-
364; Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 151-156 (1968). Indeed, in my view, a proper understanding of this principle
encompasses facts that increase the minimum as well as the
maximum permissible sentence, and also facts that must be
established before a defendant may be put to death. If McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S. 79 (1986), and Part II of
the Court's opinion in Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639, 647-
649 (1990), departed from that principle, as I think they did,
see McMillan, 477 U. S., at 95-104 (Stevens, J., dissenting),
and Walton, 497 U. S., at 709-714 (Stevens, J., dissenting),
they should be reconsidered in due course. It is not, however, necessary to do so in order to join the Court's opinion
today, which I do.

Justice Scalia, concurring.
In dissenting in Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523

in Monge v. California, 524 U. S. 721, 737 (1998), I set forth
as my considered view, that it is unconstitutional to remove
from the jury the assessment of facts that alter the congressionally prescribed range of penalties to which a criminal
defendant is exposed. Because I think it necessary to resolve all ambiguities in criminal statutes in such fashion as
to avoid violation of this constitutional principle, I join the
opinion of the Court.

Kennedy, J., dissenting
Justice Kennedy, with whom The Chief Justice,
Justice O'Connor, and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.

The question presented is whether the federal carjackingstatute, prohibiting the taking of a motor vehicle from the

person or presence of another by force and violence or byintimidation, contains in the first paragraph a complete definition of the offense, with all of the elements of the crimeCongress intended to codify. 18 U. S. C. $ 2119. In my
view, shared by every Court of Appeals to have addressedthe issue, it does. The Court adopts a contrary, strained
reading according to which the single statutory section pro-hibits three distinct offenses.

Had it involved simply a question of statutory interpreta-tion, the majority opinion would not have been cause for
much concern. Questions of statutory interpretation can beclose but nonetheless routine. That should have been so in
today's case. The Court, however, is unwilling to rest itsopinion on textual analysis. Rather, to bolster its statutory
interpretation, the Court raises the specter of " `grave anddoubtful constitutional questions,' " ante, at 239, without an
adequate explanation of the origins, contours, or consequences of its constitutional concerns. The Court's relianceon the so-called constitutional doubt rule is inconsistent with

usual principles of stare decisis and contradicts the approachfollowed just last Term in

Almendarez-Torres v. United
States, 523 U. S. 224 (1998). Our precedents admit of no realdoubt regarding the power of Congress to establish serious

bodily injury and death as sentencing factors rather thanoffense elements, as we made clear in

Almendarez-Torres.
Departing from this recent authority, the Court's sweeping
constitutional discussion casts doubt on sentencing practicesand assumptions followed not only in the federal system but

also in many States. Thus, among other unsettling conse-quences, today's decision intrudes upon legitimate and vital
state interests, upsetting the proper federal balance. I dis-sent from this unfortunate and unnecessary result.

Before it departs on its troubling constitutional discussion,the Court analyzes the text of $ 2119. This portion of the

Court's opinion, it should be acknowledged, is careful andcomprehensive. In my submission, however, the analysis
suggests the presence of more interpretative ambiguity thanin fact exists and reaches the wrong result. Like the Court,
I begin with the textual question.

I
Criminal laws proscribe certain conduct and specify pun-ishment for transgressions. A person commits a crime

when his or her conduct violates the essential parts of thedefined offense, which we refer to as its elements. As a general rule, each element of a charged crime must be set forthin an indictment,

Hamling v. United States, 418 U. S. 87, 117(1974), and established by the government by proof beyond

a reasonable doubt, In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358, 364 (1970),as determined by a jury, assuming the jury right is invoked,
Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508 U. S. 275, 277-278 (1993);Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U. S., at 239. The
same rigorous requirements do not apply with respect to"factors relevant only to the sentencing of an offender found
guilty of the charged crime." Id., at 228; see also McMillanv.

Pennsylvania, 477 U. S. 79, 93 (1986). "[T]he question ofwhich factors are which is normally a matter for Congress."

Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U. S., at 228.In determining whether clauses (1)-(3) of $ 2119 set forth
sentencing factors or define distinct criminal offenses, ourtask is to "look to the statute before us and ask what Congress intended." Ibid. The statute is as follows:

"Whoever, possessing a firearm as defined in section921 of this title, takes a motor vehicle that has been

transported, shipped, or received in interstate or foreigncommerce from the person or presence of another by
force and violence or by intimidation, or attempts to doso, shall--

256 JONES v. UNITED STATES

Kennedy, J., dissenting
"(1) be fined under this title or imprisoned not morethan 15 years, or both,

"(2) if serious bodily injury (as defined in section 1365of this title) results, be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 25 years, or both, and"(3) if death results, be fined under this title or imprisoned for any number of years up to life, or both."18 U. S. C. $ 2119 (1988 ed., Supp. V).

As the Court is quite fair to acknowledge, the first readingor initial look of the statute suggests that clauses (1)-(3) are
sentencing provisions. Ante, at 232. In my view, this con-clusion survives further and meticulous examination.

Section 2119 begins by setting forth in its initial paragraphelements typical of a robbery-type offense. For all ordinary
purposes, this is a complete crime. If, for instance, therewere only a single punishment, as provided in clause (1),
I think there could be no complaint with jury instructionsdrawn from the first paragraph of $ 2119, without reference
to the punishment set forth in clause (1). The design of thestatute yields the conclusion that the following numbered
provisions do not convert each of the clauses into additionalelements. These are punishment provisions directed to the
sentencing judge alone. To be sure, the drafting could havebeen more clear, and my proffered interpretation would have
been better implemented, if the word "shall" at the end ofthe first paragraph had been followed by a verb form (

e. g.,"be punished") and a period. Even as written, though, the

statute sets forth a complete crime in the first paragraph.It is difficult to see why Congress would double back and
insert additional elements for the jury's consideration inclauses (2) and (3). The more likely explanation is that Congress set forth the offense first and the punishment second,without intending to combine the two.

Unlike the Court, I am unpersuaded by other factors thatthis commonsense reading is at odds with congressional intent. As to the substance of clauses (2) and (3), the harm

Kennedy, J., dissenting
from a crime--including whether the crime, after its commis-sion, results in the serious bodily injury or death of a victim--has long been deemed relevant for sentencing pur-poses. Like recidivism, it is "as typical a sentencing factor
as one might imagine," Almendarez-Torres v. United States,
supra, at 230, a point the Court cannot dispute. To fix pun-ishment based on the harm resulting from a crime has been

the settled practice under traditional, discretionary sentenc-ing regimes. See,

e. g., U. S. Dept. of Justice, W. Rhodes &
C. Conly, Analysis of Federal Sentencing X-13, XV-11 (Fed-eral Justice Research Program Rep. No. FJRP-81/004, 1981)

(under preguidelines practice, with respect to a variety of
crimes, the amount of harm threatened or done to victims
made a significant difference in the length of sentence).
Even if we confine our attention to codified law, however,
examples abound to prove the point. Other federal statutes,
as the Court notes, treat serious bodily injury as a sentencing factor. Ante, at 235. As for state law, common
practice discloses widespread reliance on victim-impact factors for sentencing purposes. See, e. g., Alaska Stat. Ann.

$ 12.55.125(c)(2) (1998) ("physical injury"); Ariz. Rev. Stat.
Ann. $ 13.702(C) (Supp. 1998-1999) ("serious physical injury"); Colo. Rev. Stat. $ 18-1-105(9)(f) (1997) ("serious

Kennedy, J., dissenting

$ 40-35-114(12) (1997) ("death . . . or serious bodily injury");Utah Code of Judicial Admin., App. D, Form 2 (1998) ("substantial bodily injury"). Given this widespread understand-ing, there is nothing surprising or anomalous in the conclusion that Congress chose to treat serious bodily injury and
resulting death as sentencing factors in $ 2119.In addition, the plain reading of $ 2119 is reinforced by

common patterns of statutory drafting. For example, in oneestablished statutory model, Congress defines the elements
of an offense in an initial paragraph ending with the phrase"shall be punished as provided in" a separate subsection.
The subsection provides for graded sentencing ranges, predicated upon specific findings (such as serious bodily injury or
death). See, e. g., 8 U. S. C. $ 1324(a)(1). Section 2119 follows a similar logic. It is true that clauses (1)-(3) are not
separated into a separate subsection, thus giving rise to the
textual problem we must resolve. Congress does not always separate sentencing factors into separate subsections,
however. See, e. g., 18 U. S. C. $ 1347 (1994 ed., Supp. III)
(health-care fraud; enhanced penalties if the violation "results in serious bodily injury" or "results in death"). As
with statutes like $ 1324, the structure of $ 2119 suggests a
design which defines the offense first and the punishment
afterward.

In addition, there is some significance in the use of the
active voice in the main paragraph and the passive voice in
clauses (2) and (3) of $ 2119. In the more common practice,
criminal statutes use the active voice to define prohibited
conduct. See, e. g., 18 U. S. C. $ 1116 (1994 ed., Supp. III)
("[w]hoever kills or attempts to kill"); $ 2114 ("assaults,"
"robs or attempts to rob," "receives, possesses, conceals,
or disposes"); Tex. Penal Code Ann. $$ 29.03(a)(1), (2) (1994)
(aggravated robbery; "causes serious bodily injury," or
"uses or exhibits a deadly weapon"); cf. 18 U. S. C. $ 248(b)
(setting forth, as sentencing factors, "if bodily injury results," and "if death results"); United States Sentencing

Kennedy, J., dissenting
Commission, Guidelines Manual $ 2B3.1(b)(3) (Nov. 1998)(robbery guideline; "[i]f any victim sustained bodily injury").

These drafting conventions are not absolute rules. Con-gress uses active language in phrasing sentencing factors in
some instances. See, e. g., 18 U. S. C. $ 2262(b)(3) (1994 ed.,
Supp. III) ("if serious bodily injury to the victim results orif the offender uses a dangerous weapon during the offense").

Nevertheless, the more customary drafting conventions sup-port, rather than contradict, the interpretation that $ 2119
sets forth but one offense.The Court offers specific arguments regarding these background considerations, each deserving of consideration and
response.

First, as its principal argument, the Court cites the three
federal robbery statutes on which (according to the legislative history) $ 2119 was modeled. As the Court acknowledges, however, one of those statutes, 18 U. S. C. $ 2111, does
not refer to "serious bodily injury" or "death" "result[ing]"
at all. Because of the omission, the Court deems this statute irrelevant for our purposes. Yet the Committee Report
cited by the Court states that " `[t]he definition of the offense' " in $ 2119 " `tracks the language used in other federal
robbery statutes' " including $ 2111. Ante, at 235, n. 4 (quoting H. R. Rep. No. 102-851, pt. 1, p. 17 (1992)). The definition of the offense in $ 2119 includes "tak[ing]" or "attempt[ing]" to take a motor vehicle, "from the person or presence
of another," "by force and violence or by intimidation."
This is altogether consistent with the definition of the offense
in $ 2111, which provides in part that "[w]hoever . . . by force
and violence, or by intimidation, takes or attempts to take
from the person or presence of another" something of value
"shall be imprisoned." Of course $$ 2111 and 2119 each include at least one element the other does not (e. g., "within
the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United
States" in the former, "transported, shipped, or received in
interstate or foreign commerce" in the latter). Those ele526US1 Unit: $U40 [12-13-00 19:26:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN
260 JONES v. UNITED STATES

Kennedy, J., dissenting
ments, however, are included in unambiguous fashion in theoffense-defining part of the statutes. With respect to the

debatable interpretive question--whether serious bodily in-jury and death are part of the carjacking offense--the circumstance that the definition of the offense in $ 2119 is basedon $ 2111 and that $ 2111 does not include these elements
suggests $ 2119 does not include the elements either.Passing over $ 2111, the Court suggests $$ 2113 and 2118
support its reading of $ 2119. I disagree. Section 2113,captioned "Bank robbery and incidental crimes," consists of
eight subsections. The last three are definitional and irrele-vant to the question at hand. The first subsection, subsection (a), proscribes the crime of bank robbery in languagethat tracks the definition of the offense in $ 2119, i. e., "tak[ing], or attempt[ing] to take," something of value "from theperson or presence of another," "by force and violence, or by
intimidation." Subsection (b) proceeds to define the offenseof bank larceny and is cast in different terms--as is natural
in light of the different conduct proscribed. Subsections (d)and (e) of $ 2113, the two subsections relied upon by the
Court, provide as follows:

"(d) Whoever, in committing, or in attempting to com-mit, any offense defined in subsections (a) and (b) of this

section, assaults any person, or puts in jeopardy the lifeof any person by the use of a dangerous weapon or device, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned notmore than twenty-five years, or both.

"(e) Whoever, in committing any offense defined inthis section, or in avoiding or attempting to avoid apprehension for the commission of such offense, or in freeinghimself or attempting to free himself from arrest or confinement for such offense, kills any person, or forces anyperson to accompany him without the consent of such
person, shall be imprisoned not less than ten years, orif death results shall be punished by death or life
imprisonment."

We have not held that subsections (d) and (e) set forthseparate offenses. (The Court's citations to

AlmendarezTorres and McMillan on this score are inapt. In neithercase did we hold that $$ 2113(d) and (e) set forth distinct offenses.) Assuming they do, however, they fail to prove the
Court's point, for two reasons. First, as a matter of struc-ture, $ 2113 is divided into distinct subsections with a parallel

form. Excluding the definitional provisions at the end, eachof the five subsections begins with the word "[w]hoever,"
followed by specified conduct. Given that some of these sub-sections (

e. g., subsections (a) and (b)) set forth distinct offenses, it is fair to presume their like structured neighbors
do so as well. One finds no analogous subsections in $ 2119
with which clauses (1)-(3) can be matched. On the contrary,
clause (1) plainly fails to introduce anything that could be
construed as an offense element, making it all the less likely
that offense elements are introduced in clauses (2) and (3).
Second, the phrases from $ 2113 cited by the Court--"assaults any person" and "puts in jeopardy the life of any person by the use of a dangerous weapon or device"--are rather
different from the "serious bodily injury results" and "death
results" language of $ 2119. The former phrases occur before, not after, the punishment-introducing clause "shall
be . . . ." They are also phrased in the active voice, placing
attention on the defendant's actions, rather than their consequences. The "or if death results" phrase at the end of subsection (e) is a closer analogue to clauses (2) and (3) of $ 2119,
but there is no reason to assume that this phrase by itself--
as opposed to the preceding portion of subsection (e)--defines an element of an offense.

With respect to $ 2118, the Court asserts without citation
to authority that the phrase "another person . . . suffered
significant bodily injury" in subsection (a)(3) is an element of
the offense. Ante, at 235-236. Even assuming the Court is
correct on the point, however, the differences in structure
between that provision and $ 2119 show them not to be com526US1 Unit: $U40 [12-13-00 19:26:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Kennedy, J., dissenting
parable. Clauses (1)-(3) in $ 2119 set forth alternative sen-tences; but the three clauses in $ 2118(a) set forth alternative

ways of qualifying for the only punishment provided. Themore natural reading is that the drafters of $ 2119 took from

$ 2118 the same thing they took from $$ 2111 and 2113: the
language defining the basic elements of robbery. It is thislanguage, and not other provisions, that is common to all

four statutes.In short, even indulging the Court's assumptions, the federal robbery statutes do not support the conclusion that$ 2119 contains three substantive offenses. Rather, all four
statutes employ similar language to define the elements of a
basic robbery-type offense. It is in this sense that $ 2119 is
modeled on $$ 2111, 2113, and 2118.

The Court next relies on the consumer product-tampering
statute, 18 U. S. C. $ 1365(a), as support for its reading of

$ 2119. It is indeed true, as the Court suggests, that the
structure and phrasing of $ 1365(a) is similar to the carjacking statute. However, neither the Court nor, my research
indicates, any Court of Appeals has held that $ 1365(a) creates multiple offenses. The only case cited for the proposition that "the Courts of Appeals treat the statute . . . as
defining basic and aggravated offenses," ante, at 234, establishes nothing of the kind. There, the Court of Appeals did
no more than recite that the defendant had been charged and
convicted on multiple counts of product tampering, under
three subsections of $ 1365(a). United States v. Meling, 47
F. 3d 1546, 1551 (CA9 1995). None of the issues presented
turned on whether the subsections set forth additional
elements.

The Court's final justification for its reading of $ 2119 rests
on state practice. Of course, the Court cannot argue that
States do not take factors like serious bodily injury into account at sentencing; as discussed above, they do. Instead,
the Court says many States have created a distinct offense
of aggravated robbery, requiring proof of serious bodily in526US1 Unit: $U40 [12-13-00 19:26:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN

jury or harm. This is unremarkable. The laws reflect noth-ing more than common intuition that a forcible theft, all else

being equal, is more blameworthy when it results in seriousbodily injury or death. I have no doubt Congress was
responding to this same intuition when it added clauses (2)
and (3) to $ 2119. Recognizing the common policy concern,however, gives scant guidance on the question before us:

whether Congress meant to give effect to the policy by mak-ing serious bodily injury and death elements of distinct offenses or by making them sentencing factors. I agree withthe Court that these state statutes are not direct authority
for the issue presented here. Ante, at 237.

The persuasive force of the Court's state-law citations is
further undercut by the structural differences between those
laws and $ 2119. Ten of the thirteen statutes cited by the
Court follow the same pattern. One statutory section sets
forth the elements of the basic robbery offense. Another
section (captioned "Aggravated robbery" or "Robbery in the
first degree") incorporates the basic robbery offense (either
by explicit cross-reference or by obvious implication), adds
the bodily or physical injury element (in the active voice),
and then provides that the aggravated crime is subject to a
higher penalty set forth elsewhere (e. g., "a class A felony").
Two of the remaining three statutes, N. Y. Penal Law

$ 160.15 (McKinney 1988), and Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 515.020
(Michie 1990), deviate from this pattern in only minor respects while the third, N. H. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 636:1 (1996),
has a singular structure.

Had Congress wished to emulate this state practice in
detail, one might have expected it to structure $ 2119 in
a similar manner to the majority model. Cf. 18 U. S. C.

$$ 2113(e), (d). It did not do so. This suggests to me either
(i) that Congress chose a different structure than utilized by
the States in order to show its intent to treat "serious bodily
injury" as a sentencing factor, or (ii) that Congress simply
did not concentrate on state practice in deciding whether "se526US1 Unit: $U40 [12-13-00 19:26:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN
264 JONES v. UNITED STATES

Kennedy, J., dissenting
rious bodily injury" should be classed as an element or asentencing factor. Neither possibility sustains the Court's

interpretation of $ 2119. II

Although the Court, in my view, errs in its reading of$ 2119 as a simple matter of statutory construction, of far
greater concern is its constitutional discussion. In order toinject the rule of constitutional doubt into the case, the
Court treats the relevant line of authorities from Winship to
Almendarez-Torres as if it had been the Court's purpose towrite them at odds with each other, not to produce a coherent body of case law interpreting the relevant constitutionalprovisions. This attempt to create instability is neither a
proper use of the rule of constitutional doubt nor a persua-sive reading of our precedents. We have settled more than
the Court's opinion says.

In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358 (1970), made clear what haslong been accepted in our criminal justice system. It is the

principle that in a criminal case the government must estab-lish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. To implement this
constitutional protection, it follows, there must be an under-standing of the essential elements of the crime; and cases
like this one will arise, requiring statutory analysis.Nonetheless, the holding of the first case decided in the
wake of Winship, Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U. S. 684 (1975),now seems straightforward. In homicide cases, Maine
sought to presume malice from the fact of an intentional kill-ing alone, subject to the defendant's right to prove he had
acted in the heat of passion. This was so even though "thefact at issue . . .--the presence or absence of the heat of
passion on sudden provocation--has been, almost from theinception of the common law of homicide, the single most
important factor in determining the degree of culpability at-taching to an unlawful homicide." Id., at 696. As we later
explained, Mullaney "held that a State must prove everyingredient of an offense beyond a reasonable doubt, and that

526US1 Unit: $U40 [12-13-00 19:26:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Kennedy, J., dissenting
it may not shift the burden of proof to the defendant by presuming that ingredient upon proof of the other elements of
the offense." Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S. 197, 215
(1977).

In Patterson, the Court confronted a state rule placing on
the defendant the burden of establishing extreme emotional
disturbance as an affirmative defense to murder. As today's
majority opinion recognizes, Patterson stands for the proposition that the State has considerable leeway in determining
which factors shall be included as elements of its crimes.
We determined that New York was permitted to place the
burden of proving the affirmative defense on defendants because "nothing was presumed or implied against" them. Id.,
at 216.

In McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S. 79 (1986), we upheld a state law requiring imposition of a mandatory minimum sentence upon the trial judge's determination that the
defendant had visibly possessed a firearm during the commission of an enumerated offense. Today's majority errs, in
my respectful view, by suggesting McMillan is somewhat
inconsistent with Patterson. McMillan's holding follows
easily from Patterson. McMillan confirmed the State's authority to treat aggravated behavior as a factor increasing
the sentence, rather than as an element of the crime. The
opinion made clear that we had already "rejected the claim
that whenever a State links the `severity of punishment' to
`the presence or absence of an identified fact' the State must
prove that fact beyond a reasonable doubt." 477 U. S., at 84
(quoting Patterson v. New York, supra, at 214).

In today's decision, the Court chooses to rely on language
from McMillan to create a doubt where there should be
none. Ante, at 242. Yet any uncertainty on this score
ought to have been put to rest by our decision last Term in
Almendarez-Torres. To say otherwise, the majority must
strive to limit Almendarez-Torres, just as it must struggle

Kennedy, J., dissenting
with Patterson and McMillan. Almendarez-Torres, how-ever, controls the question before us.

As an initial matter, Almendarez-Torres makes clear thatthe constitutional doubt methodology employed by the Court
today is incorrect. It teaches that the constitutional doubt
canon of construction is applicable only if the statute at issueis "genuinely susceptible to two constructions after, and not

before, its complexities are unraveled. Only then is thestatutory construction that avoids the constitutional question a `fair' one." 523 U. S., at 238. For the reasons givenin Part I,

supra, the Court of Appeals' interpretation of

$ 2119 is, in my view, superior to petitioner's reading. At a
minimum, the question whether 8 U. S. C. $ 1326(b), the statute at issue in Almendarez-Torres, set forth sentencing factors or elements of distinct offenses was a closer one than
the statutory question presented here. Yet we found insufficient ambiguity to warrant application of the constitutional
doubt principle there. 523 U. S., at 238. Unless we are to
abandon any pretense of consistency in the application of the
principle, it is incumbent on the Court to explain how it reconciles its analysis with Almendarez-Torres.

Not only is the proper construction of the statute clearer
here, but there is less reason, in light of Almendarez-Torres
itself, to question the constitutionality of the statute as construed by the Court of Appeals. The insubstantiality of the
Court's constitutional concern is indicated by its quite summary reference to the principle of constitutional law the statute might offend. The Court puts the argument this way:
"[A]ny fact (other than prior conviction) that increases the
maximum penalty for a crime must be charged in an indictment, submitted to a jury, and proven beyond a reasonable
doubt." Ante, at 243, n. 6. It suggests the carjacking statute violates this principle because absent a finding of serious
bodily injury, a defendant may be sentenced to a maximum
of 15 years' imprisonment and, absent a finding of death, he
may be sentenced to a maximum of 25 years' imprisonment.

526US1 Unit: $U40 [12-13-00 19:26:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN

267Cite as: 526 U. S. 227 (1999)
Kennedy, J., dissenting
A finding of serious bodily injury increases the maximumpenalty for the crime of carjacking from 15 to 25 years' imprisonment and a finding of death increases the maximum tolife imprisonment.

If the Court is to be taken at its word, Congress could
comply with this principle by making only minor changesof phraseology that would leave the statutory scheme, for

practical purposes, unchanged. Congress could leave theinitial paragraph of $ 2119 intact, and provide that one who
commits the conduct described there shall "be imprisonedfor any number of years up to life." It could then add that
"if the sentencing judge determines that no death resulted,
one convicted under this section shall be imprisoned not
more than 25 years" and "if the sentencing judge determines
that no serious bodily injury resulted, one convicted under
this section shall be imprisoned not more than 15 years."
The practical result would be the same as the current version of $ 2119 (as construed by the Court of Appeals): The
jury makes the requisite findings under the initial paragraph,
and the court itself sentences the defendant within one of the
prescribed ranges based on the judge's own determination
whether serious bodily injury or death resulted.

The Court does not tell us whether this version of the
statute would pass constitutional muster. If so, the Court's
principle amounts to nothing more than chastising Congress
for failing to use the approved phrasing in expressing its
intent as to how carjackers should be punished. No constitutional values are served by so formalistic an approach,
while its constitutional costs in statutes struck down or, as
today, misconstrued, are real.

If, on the other hand, a rephrased $ 2119 would still violate
the Court's underlying constitutional principle, the Court
ought to explain how it would determine which sentencing
schemes cross the constitutional line. For example, a statute that sets a maximum penalty and then provides detailed
sentencing criteria to be applied by a sentencing judge (along

526US1 Unit: $U40 [12-13-00 19:26:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN
268 JONES v. UNITED STATES

Kennedy, J., dissenting
the lines of the federal Sentencing Guidelines) would be onlya more detailed version of the rephrased $ 2119 suggested

above. We are left to guess whether statutes of that sortmight be in jeopardy. (Further, by its terms,

Justice
Scalia's view--"that it is unconstitutional to remove from
the jury the assessment of facts that alter the congression-ally prescribed range of penalties to which a criminal defendant is exposed," ante, at 253 (concurring opinion)--would callinto question the validity of judge-administered mandatory
minimum sentencing provisions, contrary to our holding in
McMillan. Once the facts triggering application of the
mandatory minimum are found by the judge, the sentencing
range to which the defendant is exposed is altered.) In light
of these uncertainties, today's decision raises more questions
than the Court acknowledges.

In any event, the Court's constitutional doubts are not well
founded. In Almendarez-Torres, we squarely rejected the
petitioner's argument that "any significant increase in a statutory maximum sentence would trigger a constitutional `elements' requirement"; as we said, the Constitution "does not
impose that requirement." 523 U. S., at 247. See also
Monge v. California, 524 U. S. 721, 729 (1998) ("[T]he Court
has rejected an absolute rule that an enhancement constitutes an element of the offense any time that it increases
the maximum sentence to which a defendant is exposed").
Indeed, the dissenters in Almendarez-Torres had no doubt
on this score. 523 U. S., at 260 (opinion of Scalia, J.) (arguing that "there was, until today's unnecessary resolution
of the point, `serious doubt' whether the Constitution permits a defendant's sentencing exposure to be increased tenfold on the basis of a fact that is not charged, tried to a jury,
and found beyond a reasonable doubt").

The Court suggests two bases on which AlmendarezTorres is distinguishable, neither of which is persuasive.
First, the Court suggests that this case is "concerned with
the Sixth Amendment right to jury trial and not alone the

526US1 Unit: $U40 [12-13-00 19:26:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN

269Cite as: 526 U. S. 227 (1999)
Kennedy, J., dissenting
rights to indictment and notice as claimed by Almendarez-Torres."

Ante, at 248-249. This is not a valid basis upon
which to distinguish Almendarez-Torres. The petitioner in
Almendarez-Torres claimed that "the Constitution requires
Congress to treat recidivism as an element of the offense"
and that, as a corollary, "[t]he Government must prove that`element' to a jury." 523 U. S., at 239.

The Court has not suggested in its previous opinions,moreover, that there is a difference, in the context relevant
here, between, on the one hand, a right to a jury determina-tion, and, on the other, a right to notice by indictment and
to a determination based upon proof by the prosecution beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court offers no reason why
the concept of an element of a crime should mean one thing
for one inquiry and something else for another. There
would be little to guide us in formulating a standard to differentiate between elements of a crime for purposes of indictment, jury trial, and proof beyond a reasonable doubt.
Inviting such confusion is a curious way to safeguard the
important procedural rights of criminal defendants.

Second, the Court is eager to find controlling significance
in the fact that the statute at issue in Almendarez-Torres
made recidivism a sentencing factor, while the sentencing
factor at issue here is serious bodily injury. This is not a
difference of constitutional dimension, and AlmendarezTorres does not say otherwise. It is true that our statutory
analysis was informed in substantial measure by the fact
that recidivism is a common sentencing factor. Id., at 230.
In our constitutional analysis we invoked the long history
of using recidivism as a basis for increasing an offender's
sentence to illustrate the novel and anomalous character
of the petitioner's proposed constitutional rule--i. e., that
under McMillan v. Pennsylvania any factor that increases
the maximum penalty for a crime must be deemed an
element of the offense. We proceeded to reject that rule.
Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U. S., at 247. The

526US1 Unit: $U40 [12-13-00 19:26:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN
270 JONES v. UNITED STATES

Kennedy, J., dissenting
dissenters there (like the Court today) misunderstood theimport of this discussion, but they were correct in their observation that "[i]t is impossible to understand how McMillan could mean one thing in a later case where recidivism
is at issue, and something else in a later case where some
other sentencing factor is at issue." Id., at 258 (opinionof S

calia, J.).
The constitutional portion of Almendarez-Torres also re-jected the argument that constitutional concerns were raised

by a "different `tradition'--that of courts having treated re-cidivism as an element of the related crime."

Id., at 246.
We found this argument unconvincing because "any such tradition is not uniform." Ibid. Of course, the same is true
with respect to the sentencing factors at issue here. See
supra, at 257-258. In sum, "there is no rational basis
for making recidivism an exception." 523 U. S., at 258
(Scalia, J., dissenting) (emphasis deleted).

If the Court deems its new direction to be a justified departure from stare decisis, it does not make the case. There
is no support for the view that Almendarez-Torres was
based on a historical misunderstanding or misinterpretation.
By the Court's own submission, its historical discussion demonstrates no more than that "the tension between jury powers and powers exclusively judicial" would probably and generally have informed the Framers' conception of the jury
right. Ante, at 244. That must be correct, but it does not
call into question the principle that " `[t]he definition of the
elements of a criminal offense is entrusted to the legislature.' " Staples v. United States, 511 U. S. 600, 604 (1994)
(quoting Liparota v. United States, 471 U. S. 419, 424 (1985)).

The Court's historical analysis might have some bearing
on the instant case if $ 2119 disclosed the intent to serve the
real objective of punishing (without constitutional safeguards) those who caused serious bodily harm, rather than
to prevent the underlying conduct of carjacking. See
Almendarez-Torres v. United States, supra, at 243, 246. No

Kennedy, J., dissenting
such inference or implication can be drawn from the text andstatutory history of the offense here under consideration.

In fact, the Court makes no attempt to argue that anythingparticular to the carjacking statute suggests the jury's role
has been unconstitutionally diminished. The gravamen of
the offense is carjacking coupled with a threat of bodilyharm. The jury resolves these issues,

i. e., whether a vehicle is taken "by force and violence or by intimidation." In-deed, whether serious bodily injury results can be outside of

the defendant's control. As already explained, it is not inthe least a novel view that after the offense is established,
the extent of the harm caused is taken into account in the
sentencing phase. In this respect, today's case is far easier
than McMillan, where the sentencing factor was inherent in
the criminal conduct itself.

The rationale of the Court's constitutional doubt holding
makes it difficult to predict the full consequences of today's
holding, but it is likely that it will cause disruption and uncertainty in the sentencing systems of the States. Sentencing is one of the most difficult tasks in the enforcement of
the criminal law. In seeking to bring more order and consistency to the process, some States have sought to move
from a system of indeterminate sentencing or a grant of vast
discretion to the trial judge to a regime in which there are
more uniform penalties, prescribed by the legislature. See
A. Campbell, Law of Sentencing $$ 1:3, 4:6-4:8 (2d ed. 1991).
These States should not be confronted with an unexpected
rule mandating that what were once factors bearing upon
the sentence now must be treated as offense elements for
determination by the jury. This is especially so when, as
here, what is at issue is not the conduct of the defendant, but
the consequences of a completed criminal act.

A further disconcerting result of today's decision is the
needless doubt the Court's analysis casts upon our cases involving capital sentencing. For example, while in Walton v.
Arizona, 497 U. S. 639, 648 (1990), we viewed the aggravat526US1 Unit: $U40 [12-13-00 19:26:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN
272 JONES v. UNITED STATES

Kennedy, J., dissenting
ing factors at issue as sentencing enhancements and not aselements of the offense, the same is true of serious bodily

injury under the reading of $ 2119 the Court rejects as con-stitutionally suspect. The question is why, given that characterization, the statutory scheme in Walton was constitu-tionally permissible. Under the relevant Arizona statute,
Walton could not have been sentenced to death unless thetrial judge found at least one of the enumerated aggravating
factors. See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 13-703 (1989). Absentsuch a finding, the maximum potential punishment provided
by law was a term of imprisonment. If it is constitutionallyimpermissible to allow a judge's finding to increase the maximum punishment for carjacking by 10 years, it is not clearwhy a judge's finding may increase the maximum punishment
for murder from imprisonment to death. In fact, Waltonwould appear to have been a better candidate for the Court's
new approach than is the instant case. In Walton, the ques-tion was the aggravated character of the defendant's conduct, not, as here, a result that followed after the criminalconduct had been completed.

In distinguishing this line of precedent, the Court suggests
Walton did not "squarely fac[e]" the key constitutional ques-tion "implicated by the Government's position on the meaning of $ 2119(2)." Ante, at 251. The implication is clear.Reexamination of this area of our capital jurisprudence can
be expected. * * *

The Court misreads $ 2119 and seeks to create constitu-tional doubt where there is none. In my view,

Almendarez-Torres controls this case. I would hold $ 2119 as interpreted

by the Court of Appeals constitutional, and I dissent fromthe opinion and judgment of the Court.

Pro se petitioner Lowe seeks leave to proceed in formapauperis under Rule 39 of this Court. We deny this request

pursuant to Rule 39.8. Lowe is allowed until April 19, 1999,within which to pay the docketing fee required by Rule 38

Lowe has abused this Court's certiorari and extraordinarywrit processes. In November of last year and earlier this

We enter the order barring prospective filings for the rea-sons discussed in

Syllabus

UNITED STATES v. RODRIGUEZ-MORENO
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe third circuit

No. 97-1139. Argued December 7, 1998--Decided March 30, 1999
A drug distributor hired respondent and others to find a New York drug

dealer who stole cocaine from him during a Texas drug transaction and
to hold captive the middleman in the transaction, Ephrain Avendano,
during the search. The group drove from Texas to New Jersey to New
York to Maryland, taking Avendano with them. Respondent took possession of a revolver in Maryland and threatened to kill Avendano.
Avendano eventually escaped and called police, who arrested respondent
and the others. Respondent was charged in a New Jersey District
Court with, inter alia, using and carrying a firearm in relation to Avendano's kidnaping, in violation of 18 U. S. C. $ 924(c)(1). He moved to
dismiss that count, arguing that venue was proper only in Maryland, the
only place where the Government had proved he had actually used a
gun. The court denied the motion, and respondent was convicted of the

$ 924(c)(1) offense. The Third Circuit reversed. After applying what
it called the "verb test," it determined that venue was proper only in
the district where a defendant actually uses or carries a firearm.

Held: Venue in a prosecution for using or carrying a firearm "during and

in relation to any crime of violence" in violation of $ 924(c)(1) is proper
in any district where the crime of violence was committed. Under the
locus delicti test, a court must initially identify the conduct constituting
the offense (the nature of the offense) and then discern where the criminal acts occurred. See United States v. Cabrales, 524 U. S. 1, 6-7. Although the Third Circuit relied on the statute's verbs to determine the
nature of the offense, this Court has never held that verbs are the sole
consideration, to the exclusion of other relevant statutory language. A
defendant's violent acts are essential conduct elements of the $ 924(c)(1)
offense despite being embedded in the prepositional phrase, "during and
in relation to any crime of violence." Thus, the statute contains two
distinct conduct elements--as is relevant to this case, using and carrying
a gun and committing a kidnaping. Where a crime consists of distinct
parts which have different localities, venue is proper for the whole
charge where any part can be proved to have been committed. See
United States v. Lombardo, 241 U. S. 73. Respondent's argument that

$ 924(c)(1) is a "point-in-time" offense that only is committed in the place
where the kidnaping and use of a gun coincide is unpersuasive. Kidnap526US1 Unit: $U42 [09-21-99 14:52:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ing is a unitary crime, which, once begun, does not end until the victim is
free. It does not matter that respondent used the gun only in Maryland
because he did so "during and in relation to" a kidnaping that began in
Texas and continued in New York, New Jersey, and Maryland. The
kidnaping, to which the $ 924(c)(1) offense is attached, was committed in
all of the places that any part of it took place, and venue for the kidnaping charge was appropriate in any of them. Where venue is appropriate for the underlying crime of violence, so too it is for the $ 924(c)(1)
offense. Pp. 278-282.

Shortly after respondent and the others arrived at the
Maryland house, the owner of the home passed around a .357
magnum revolver and respondent took possession of the pistol. As it became clear that efforts to find the New York
drug dealer would not bear fruit, respondent told his employer that he thought they should kill the middleman and
end their search for the dealer. He put the gun to the back
of Avendano's neck but, at the urging of his cohorts, did not
shoot. Avendano eventually escaped through the back door
and ran to a neighboring house. The neighbors called the
Maryland police, who arrested respondent along with the
rest of the kidnapers. The police also seized the .357 magnum, on which they later found respondent's fingerprint.

Rodriguez-Moreno and his codefendants were tried jointly
in the United States District Court for the District of New
Jersey. Respondent was charged with, inter alia, conspiring to kidnap Avendano, kidnaping Avendano, and using and
carrying a firearm in relation to the kidnaping of Avendano,
in violation of 18 U. S. C. $ 924(c)(1). At the conclusion of
the Government's case, respondent moved to dismiss the

$ 924(c)(1) count for lack of venue. He argued that venue
was proper only in Maryland, the only place where the Government had proved he had actually used a gun. The District Court denied the motion, App. 54, and the jury found
respondent guilty on the kidnaping counts and on the

$ 924(c)(1) charge as well. He was sentenced to 87 months'
imprisonment on the kidnaping charges, and was given a
mandatory consecutive term of 60 months' imprisonment for
committing the $ 924(c)(1) offense.

278 UNITED STATES v. RODRIGUEZ-MORENO

Opinion of the Court
On a 2-to-1 vote, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit
reversed respondent's $ 924(c)(1) conviction. United States
v. Palma-Ruedas, 121 F. 3d 841 (1997). A majority of the
Third Circuit panel applied what it called the "verb test" to

$ 924(c)(1), and determined that a violation of the statute is
committed only in the district where a defendant "uses" or
"carries" a firearm. Id., at 849. Accordingly, it concluded
that venue for the $ 924(c)(1) count was improper in New
Jersey even though venue was proper there for the kidnaping of Avendano. The dissenting judge thought that the majority's test relied too much "on grammatical arcana," id., at
865, and argued that the proper approach was to "look at the
substance of the statutes in question," ibid. In his view, the
crime of violence is an essential element of the course of
conduct that Congress sought to criminalize in enacting

$ 924(c)(1), and therefore, "venue for a prosecution under
[that] statute lies in any district in which the defendant committed the underlying crime of violence." Id., at 863. The
Government petitioned for review on the ground that the
Third Circuit's holding was in conflict with a decision of the
Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, United States v. Pomranz, 43 F. 3d 156 (1995). We granted certiorari, 524 U. S.
915 (1998), and now reverse.

II
Article III of the Constitution requires that "[t]he Trial of
all Crimes . . . shall be held in the State where the said
Crimes shall have been committed." Art. III, $ 2, cl. 3. Its
command is reinforced by the Sixth Amendment's requirement that "[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall
enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial
jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have
been committed," and is echoed by Rule 18 of the Federal
Rules of Criminal Procedure ("prosecution shall be had in a
district in which the offense was committed").

Opinion of the Court
As we confirmed just last Term, the " `locus delicti [of thecharged offense] must be determined from the nature of the

crime alleged and the location of the act or acts constitutingit.' " United States v. Cabrales, 524 U. S. 1, 6-7 (1998) (quoting United States v. Anderson, 328 U. S. 699, 703 (1946)).1In performing this inquiry, a court must initially identify the
conduct constituting the offense (the nature of the crime) andthen discern the location of the commission of the criminal
acts.2 See Cabrales, supra, at 6-7; Travis v. United States,364 U. S. 631, 635-637 (1961);

United States v. Cores, 356U. S. 405, 408-409 (1958); Anderson, supra, at 703-706.

At the time respondent committed the offense and wastried, 18 U. S. C. $ 924(c)(1) provided:

"Whoever, during and in relation to any crime ofviolence . . . for which he may be prosecuted in a court
of the United States, uses or carries a firearm, shall, inaddition to the punishment provided for such crime of
violence . . . be sentenced to imprisonment for fiveyears . . . ."

3

The Third Circuit, as explained above, looked to the verbs ofthe statute to determine the nature of the substantive of1 When we first announced this test in United States v. Anderson, 328
U. S., at 703, we were comparing $ 11 of the Selective Training and Service
Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 894, in which Congress did "not indicate where [it]
considered the place of committing the crime to be," 328 U. S., at 703, with
statutes where Congress was explicit with respect to venue. Title 18
U. S. C. $ 924(c)(1), like the Selective Training and Service Act, does not
contain an express venue provision.

2 The Government argues that venue also may permissibly be based

upon the effects of a defendant's conduct in a district other than the one
in which the defendant performs the acts constituting the offense. Brief
for United States 16-17. Because this case only concerns the locus delicti, we express no opinion as to whether the Government's assertion
is correct.

3 The statute recently has been amended, see Pub. L. 105-386, 112 Stat.

3469, but it is not argued that the amendment is in any way relevant to
our analysis in this case.

Opinion of the Court
fense. But we have never before held, and decline to do sohere, that verbs are the sole consideration in identifying the

conduct that constitutes an offense. While the "verb test"certainly has value as an interpretative tool, it cannot be
applied rigidly, to the exclusion of other relevant statutorylanguage. The test unduly limits the inquiry into the nature
of the offense and thereby creates a danger that certain con-duct prohibited by statute will be missed.

In our view, the Third Circuit overlooked an essential con-duct element of the $ 924(c)(1) offense. Section 924(c)(1) prohibits using or carrying a firearm "during and in relation toany crime of violence . . . for which [a defendant] may be
prosecuted in a court of the United States." That the crimeof violence element of the statute is embedded in a prepositional phrase and not expressed in verbs does not dissuadeus from concluding that a defendant's violent acts are essential conduct elements. To prove the charged $ 924(c)(1) vio-lation in this case, the Government was required to show
that respondent used a firearm, that he committed all theacts necessary to be subject to punishment for kidnaping (a
crime of violence) in a court of the United States, and thathe used the gun "during and in relation to" the kidnaping
of Avendano. In sum, we interpret $ 924(c)(1) to containtwo distinct conduct elements--as is relevant to this case,
the "using and carrying" of a gun and the commission ofa kidnaping.

4 By way of comparison, last Term in United States v. Cabrales, 524 U. S.
1 (1998), we considered whether venue for money laundering, in violation
of 18 U. S. C. $$ 1956(a)(1)(B)(ii) and 1957, was proper in Missouri, where
the laundered proceeds were unlawfully generated, or rather, only in
Florida, where the prohibited laundering transactions occurred. As we
interpreted the laundering statutes at issue, they did not proscribe "the
anterior criminal conduct that yielded the funds allegedly laundered."
Cabrales, 524 U. S., at 7. The existence of criminally generated proceeds
was a circumstance element of the offense but the proscribed conduct--
defendant's money laundering activity--occurred " `after the fact' of an
offense begun and completed by others." Ibid. Here, by contrast, given

Opinion of the Court
Respondent, however, argues that for venue purposes "theNew Jersey kidnapping is completely irrelevant to the firearm crime, because respondent did not use or carry a gunduring the New Jersey crime." Brief for Respondent 12.
In the words of one amicus, $ 924(c)(1) is a "point-in-time"offense that only is committed in the place where the kidnaping and the use of a gun coincide. Brief for National Associ-ation of Criminal Defense Lawyers as

Amicus Curiae 11.We disagree. Several Circuits have determined that kidnaping, as defined by 18 U. S. C. $ 1201 (1994 ed. and Supp.III), is a unitary crime, see United States v. Seals, 130 F. 3d
451, 461-462 (CADC 1997); United States v. Denny-Shaffer,2 F. 3d 999, 1018-1019 (CA10 1993);

United States v. Godinez,998 F. 2d 471, 473 (CA7 1993); United States v. Garcia, 854

F. 2d 340, 343-344 (CA9 1988), and we agree with their con-clusion. A kidnaping, once begun, does not end until the
victim is free. It does not make sense, then, to speak of itin discrete geographic fragments. Section 924(c)(1) criminalized a defendant's use of a firearm "during and in relationto" a crime of violence; in doing so, Congress proscribed both
the use of the firearm and the commission of acts that consti-tute a violent crime. It does not matter that respondent

used the .357 magnum revolver, as the Government con-cedes, only in Maryland because he did so "during and in
relation to" a kidnaping that was begun in Texas and contin-ued in New York, New Jersey, and Maryland. In our view,

$ 924(c)(1) does not define a "point-in-time" offense when afirearm is used during and in relation to a continuing crime
of violence.As we said in United States v. Lombardo, 241 U. S. 73
(1916), "where a crime consists of distinct parts which havedifferent localities the whole may be tried where any part
can be proved to have been done." Id., at 77; cf. Hyde v.
United States, 225 U. S. 347, 356-367 (1912) (venue proper

the "during and in relation to" language, the underlying crime of violence
is a critical part of the $ 924(c)(1) offense.

against defendant in district where co-conspirator carried
out overt acts even though there was no evidence that the
defendant had ever entered that district or that the conspiracy was formed there). The kidnaping, to which the

$ 924(c)(1) offense is attached, was committed in all of the
places that any part of it took place, and venue for the kidnaping charge against respondent was appropriate in any of
them. (Congress has provided that continuing offenses can
be tried "in any district in which such offense was begun,
continued, or completed," 18 U. S. C. $ 3237(a).) Where
venue is appropriate for the underlying crime of violence, so
too it is for the $ 924(c)(1) offense. As the kidnaping was
properly tried in New Jersey, the $ 924(c)(1) offense could be
tried there as well.

* * *
We hold that venue for this prosecution was proper in the
district where it was brought. The judgment of the Court
of Appeals is therefore reversed. It is so ordered.

Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Stevens joins,
dissenting.

I agree with the Court that in deciding where a crime was
committed for purposes of the venue provision of Article III,

$ 2, of the Constitution, and the vicinage provision of the
Sixth Amendment, we must look at "the nature of the crime
alleged and the location of the act or acts constituting it."
Ante, at 279 (quoting United States v. Cabrales, 524 U. S. 1,
7 (1998), in turn quoting United States v. Anderson, 328 U. S.
699, 703 (1946)) (internal quotation marks omitted). I disagree with the Court, however, that the crime defined in 18
U. S. C. $ 924(c)(1) is "committed" either where the defendant
commits the predicate offense or where he uses or carries
the gun. It seems to me unmistakably clear from the text
of the law that this crime can be committed only where the

526US1 Unit: $U42 [09-21-99 14:52:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN

283Cite as: 526 U. S. 275 (1999)
Scalia, J., dissenting
defendant both engages in the acts making up the predicateoffense

and uses or carries the gun.
At the time of respondent's alleged offense, $ 924(c)(1)read:

"Whoever, during and in relation to any crime of vio-lence or drug trafficking crime . . . for which he may be
prosecuted in a court of the United States, uses or car-ries a firearm, shall, in addition to the punishment provided for such crime of violence or drug traffickingcrime, be sentenced to imprisonment for five years."

This prohibits the act of using or carrying a firearm "during"(and in relation to) a predicate offense. The provisions of
the United States Code defining the particular predicate of-fenses already punish all of the defendant's alleged criminal
conduct except his use or carriage of a gun; $ 924(c)(1) itself
criminalizes and punishes such use or carriage "during" thepredicate crime, because that makes the crime more dangerous. Cf. Muscarello v. United States, 524 U. S. 125, 132(1998). This is a simple concept, and it is embodied in a
straightforward text. To answer the question before us weneed only ask where the defendant's alleged act of using a
firearm during (and in relation to) a kidnaping occurred.Since it occurred only in Maryland, venue will lie only there.

The Court, however, relies on United States v. Lombardo,
241 U. S. 73, 77 (1916), for the proposition that " `where acrime consists of distinct parts which have different localities

the whole may be tried where any part can be proved to havebeen done.' "

Ante, at 281. The fallacy in this reliance is
that the crime before us does not consist of "distinct" parts
that can occur in different localities. Its two parts are
bound inseparably together by the word "during." Where
the gun is being used, the predicate act must be occurring
as well, and vice versa. The Court quite simply reads this
requirement out of the statute--as though there were no difference between a statute making it a crime to steal a cookie

526US1 Unit: $U42 [09-21-99 14:52:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN
284 UNITED STATES v. RODRIGUEZ-MORENO

Scalia, J., dissenting
and eat it (which could be prosecuted either in New Jersey,where the cookie was stolen, or in Maryland, where it was

eaten) and a statute making it a crime to eat a cookie whilerobbing a bakery (which could be prosecuted only where the
ingestive theft occurred).

The Court believes its holding is justified by the continuingnature of the kidnaping predicate offense, which invokes the

statute providing that "any offense against the United Statesbegun in one district and completed in another, or committed
in more than one district, may be inquired of and prosecutedin any district in which such offense was begun, continued,
or completed." 18 U. S. C. $ 3237(a). To disallow the New
Jersey prosecution here, the Court suggests, is to convert

$ 924(c)(1) from a continuing offense to a "point-in-time"
offense. Ante, at 281. That is simply not so. I in no way
contend that the kidnaping, or, for that matter, the use of
the gun, can occur only at one point in time. Each can extend over a protracted period, and in many places. But

$ 924(c)(1) is violated only so long as, and where, both continuing acts are being committed simultaneously. That is what
the word "during" means. Thus, if the defendant here had
used or carried the gun throughout the kidnaping, in Texas,
New Jersey, New York, and Maryland, he could have been
prosecuted in any of those States. As it was, however, he
used a gun during a kidnaping only in Maryland.

Finally, the Government contends that focusing on the
"use or carry" element of $ 924(c)(1) is "difficult to square"
with the cases holding that there can be only one $ 924(c)(1)
violation for each predicate offense. Reply Brief for United
States 9 (citing United States v. Palma-Ruedas, 121 F. 3d
841, 862-863 (CA3 1997) (Alito, J., concurring in part and

is an odd argument for the Government to make, since it hasdisagreed with those cases, see, e. g., Anderson, supra, at

1328; Lindsay, supra, at 674, and has succeeded in persuad-ing two Circuits to the contrary, see United States v. Camps,
32 F. 3d 102, 106-109 (CA4 1994), cert. denied, 513 U. S. 1158(1995);

States, 502 U. S. 869 (1991). But this dispute has nothingto do with the point before us here. I do not contend that
using the firearm is "the entire essence of the offense."Reply Brief for United States 9. The predicate offense is
assuredly an element of the crime--and if, for whatever rea-son, that element has the effect of limiting prosecution to one
violation per predicate offense, it can do so just as effectivelyeven if the "during" requirement is observed rather than
ignored.The short of the matter is that this defendant, who has a
constitutional right to be tried in the State and districtwhere his alleged crime was "committed," U. S. Const.,
Art. III, $ 2, cl. 3; Amdt. 6, has been prosecuted for using agun during a kidnaping in a State and district where all
agree he did not use a gun during a kidnaping. If to statethis case is not to decide it, the law has departed further
from the meaning of language than is appropriate for a gov-ernment that is supposed to rule (and to be restrained)
through the written word.

Syllabus

CONN et al. v. GABBERT
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 97-1802. Argued February 23, 1999--Decided April 5, 1999
Petitioners Conn and Najera, prosecutors in the "Menendez Brothers"

case on retrial, learned that Lyle Menendez had written a letter to Traci
Baker, in which he may have instructed her to testify falsely at the
first trial. Baker was subpoenaed to testify before a grand jury and to
produce any correspondence that she had received from Menendez.
She later responded that she had given Menendez's letters to her attorney, respondent Gabbert. When Baker appeared to testify before the
grand jury, accompanied by Gabbert, Conn directed police to secure a
warrant to search Gabbert for the letter. At the same time that Gabbert was being searched, Najera called Baker before the grand jury for
questioning. Gabbert brought suit against the prosecutors under 42
U. S. C. $ 1983, contending, inter alia, that his Fourteenth Amendment
right to practice his profession without unreasonable government interference was violated when the prosecutors executed a search warrant
at the same time his client was testifying before the grand jury. The
Federal District Court granted petitioners summary judgment, but the
Ninth Circuit reversed in part, holding that Gabbert had a right to practice his profession without undue and unreasonable government interference, and that because the right was clearly established, petitioners
were not entitled to qualified immunity.

Held: A prosecutor does not violate an attorney's Fourteenth Amendment

right to practice his profession by executing a search warrant while the
attorney's client is testifying before a grand jury. To prevail in a $ 1983
action for civil damages from a government official performing discretionary functions, the qualified immunity defense requires that the official be shown to have violated clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known. Harlow
v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, 818. There is no support in this Court's
cases for the Ninth Circuit's conclusion that the prosecutors' actions in
this case deprived Gabbert of a liberty interest in practicing law. See
Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 408 U. S. 564, 578; Meyer v.
Nebraska, 262 U. S. 390, 399. The cases relied upon by the Ninth Circuit or suggested by Gabbert all deal with a complete prohibition of the
right to engage in a calling, and not the sort of brief interruption as a
result of legal process which occurred here. See, e. g., Dent v. West

526US2 Unit: $U43 [12-11-00 17:55:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
Virginia, 129 U. S. 114. Gabbert's argument that the search's improper
timing interfered with his client's right to have him outside the grand
jury room and available to consult with her is unavailing, since a grand
jury witness has no constitutional right to have counsel present during
the proceeding, and none of this Court's decisions has held that such a
witness has a right to have her attorney present outside the jury room.
This Court need not decide whether such a right exists, because Gabbert
had no standing to raise the alleged infringement of his client's rights.
Although he does have standing to complain of the allegedly unreasonable timing of the search warrant's execution to prevent him from advising his client, challenges to the reasonableness of the execution of a
search warrant must be assessed under the Fourth Amendment, not the
Fourteenth, see Graham v. Connor, 490 U. S. 386, 395. Pp. 290-293.

288 CONN v. GABBERT

Opinion of the Court
clude that such conduct by a prosecutor does not violatean attorney's Fourteenth Amendment right to practice his

profession.This case arises out of the high-profile California trials of
the "Menendez Brothers," Lyle and Erik Menendez, for the
murder of their parents. Petitioners David Conn and CarolNajera are Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorneys,

and respondent Paul Gabbert is a criminal defense attorney.In early 1994, after the first Menendez trial ended in a hung
jury, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office as-signed Conn and Najera to prosecute the case on retrial.
Conn and Najera learned that Lyle Menendez had written a
letter to Traci Baker, his former girlfriend, in which he may
have instructed her to testify falsely at trial. Gabbert represented Baker, who had testified as a defense witness in the
first trial. Conn obtained and served Baker with a subpoena directing her to testify before the Los Angeles County
grand jury and also directing her to produce at that time any
correspondence that she had received from Lyle Menendez.
After Gabbert unsuccessfully sought to quash the portion
of the subpoena directing Baker to produce the Menendez
correspondence, Conn and Najera obtained a warrant to
search Baker's apartment for any such correspondence.
When police tried to execute the warrant, Baker told the
police that she had given all her letters from Menendez to
Gabbert.

Three days later, on March 21, 1994, Baker appeared as
directed before the grand jury, accompanied by Gabbert.
Believing that Gabbert might have the letter on his person,
Conn directed a police detective to secure a warrant to
search Gabbert. California law provides that a warrant to
search an attorney must be executed by a court-appointed
special master. When the Special Master arrived, Gabbert
requested that the search take place in a private room. He
did not request that his client's grand jury testimony be postponed. The Special Master searched Gabbert in the private

Opinion of the Court
room, and Gabbert produced two pages of a three-page letter
from Lyle Menendez to Baker.

At approximately the same time that the search of Gabbert was taking place, Najera called Baker before the grand
jury and began to question her. After being sworn, Najera
asked Baker whether she was acquainted with Lyle Menendez. Baker replied that she had been unable to speak with
her attorney because he was "still with the special master."
Brief for Petitioners 6. A short recess was taken during
which time Baker was unable to speak with Gabbert. He
was aware that Baker sought to speak with him, but apparently stated that the prosecutors would simply have to delay
the questioning until they finished searching him. Baker returned to the grand jury room and declined to answer the
question "upon the advice of [my] counsel" on the basis of her
Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. Id.,
at 7. Najera asked a followup question, and Baker again
asked for a short recess to confer with Gabbert. Baker was
again unable to locate Gabbert, and she again returned to
the grand jury room and asserted her Fifth Amendment
privilege. At this point, the grand jury recessed.

Believing that the actions of the prosecutors were illegal,
Gabbert brought suit against them and other officials in Federal District Court under Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983.
Relevant to this appeal by Conn and Najera, he contended
that his Fourteenth Amendment right to practice his profession without unreasonable government interference was violated when the prosecutors executed a search warrant at the
same time his client was testifying before the grand jury.*
Conn and Najera moved for summary judgment on the basis
of qualified immunity, and the District Court granted the
motion.

*Gabbert also brought a claim under $ 1983 that Conn and Najera had
violated his rights under the Fourth Amendment. That claim is not before us and we express no opinion on it.

290 CONN v. GABBERT

Opinion of the Court
The Court of Appeals reversed in part, holding that Conn
and Najera were not entitled to qualified immunity on Gabbert's Fourteenth Amendment claim. 131 F. 3d 793 (CA9
1997). Relying on Board of Regents of State Colleges v.
Roth, 408 U. S. 564, 572 (1972), and earlier cases of this Court
recognizing a right to choose one's vocation, the Court of
Appeals concluded that Gabbert had a right to practice his
profession without undue and unreasonable government interference. 131 F. 3d, at 800. The Court of Appeals also
held that based upon notions of " `common sense,' " id., at
801, the right allegedly violated in this case was clearly established, and as a result, Conn and Najera were not entitled
to qualified immunity: "The plain and intended result [of the
prosecutors' actions] was to prevent Gabbert from consulting
with Baker during her grand jury appearance. These actions were not objectively reasonable, and thus the prosecutors are not protected by qualified immunity from answering
Gabbert's Fourteenth Amendment claim." Id., at 802-803.
We granted certiorari and now reverse.

Section 1983 provides a federal cause of action against any
person who, acting under color of state law, deprives another
of his federal rights. 42 U. S. C. $ 1983. In order to prevail
in a $ 1983 action for civil damages from a government official
performing discretionary functions, the defense of qualified
immunity that our cases have recognized requires that the
official be shown to have violated "clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person
would have known." Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800,
818 (1982). Thus a court must first determine whether the
plaintiff has alleged the deprivation of an actual constitutional right at all, and if so, proceed to determine whether
that right was clearly established at the time of the alleged
violation. See Siegert v. Gilley, 500 U. S. 226, 232-233
(1991); see also County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U. S.
833, 841, n. 5 (1998).

Opinion of the Court
We find no support in our cases for the conclusion of theCourt of Appeals that Gabbert had a Fourteenth Amendment right which was violated in this case. The Court ofAppeals relied primarily on

Board of Regents v. Roth. In
Roth, this Court repeated the pronouncement in Meyer v.
Nebraska, 262 U. S. 390, 399 (1923), that the liberty guaran-teed by the Fourteenth Amendment " `denotes not merely

freedom from bodily restraint but also the right of the indi-vidual to contract, to engage in any of the common occupations of life, to acquire useful knowledge, to marry, establisha home and bring up children, to worship God according to
the dictates of his own conscience, and generally to enjoy
those privileges long recognized . . . as essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.' " Roth, supra, at
572 (quoting Meyer, supra, at 399). But neither Roth nor
Meyer even came close to identifying the asserted "right"
violated by the prosecutors in this case. Meyer held that
substantive due process forebade a State from enacting a
statute that prohibited teaching in any language other than
English. 262 U. S., at 399, 402-403. And Roth was a procedural due process case which held that an at-will college
professor had no "property" interest in his job within the
meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment so as to require the
university to hold a hearing before terminating him. 408
U. S., at 578. Neither case will bear the weight placed upon
it by either the Court of Appeals or Gabbert: Neither case
supports the conclusion that the actions of the prosecutors
in this case deprived Gabbert of a liberty interest in practicing law.

Similarly, none of the other cases relied upon by the Court
of Appeals or suggested by Gabbert provide any more than
scant metaphysical support for the idea that the use of a
search warrant by government actors violates an attorney's
right to practice his profession. In a line of earlier cases,
this Court has indicated that the liberty component of the
Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause includes some

526US2 Unit: $U43 [12-11-00 17:55:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN
292 CONN v. GABBERT

Opinion of the Court
generalized due process right to choose one's field of privateemployment, but a right which is nevertheless subject to reasonable government regulation. See, e. g., Dent v. West Virginia, 129 U. S. 114 (1889) (upholding a requirement of licensing before a person can practice medicine); Truax v. Raich,
239 U. S. 33, 41 (1915) (invalidating on equal protectiongrounds a state law requiring companies to employ 80%

United States citizens). These cases all deal with a com-plete prohibition of the right to engage in a calling, and not
the sort of brief interruption which occurred here.Gabbert also relies on

Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners
of N. M., 353 U. S. 232, 238-239 (1957), for the proposition
that a State cannot exclude a person from the practice of
law for reasons that contravene the Due Process Clause.
Schware held that former membership in the Communist
Party and an arrest record relating to union activities could
not be the basis for completely excluding a person from the
practice of law. Like Dent, supra, and Truax, supra, it does
not deal with a brief interruption as a result of legal process.
No case of this Court has held that such an intrusion can rise
to the level of a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's
liberty right to choose and follow one's calling. That right
is simply not infringed by the inevitable interruptions of our
daily routine as a result of legal process, which all of us may
experience from time to time.

Gabbert next argues that the improper timing of the
search interfered with his client's right to have him outside
the grand jury room and available to consult with her. A
grand jury witness has no constitutional right to have counsel present during the grand jury proceeding, United States
v. Mandujano, 425 U. S. 564, 581 (1976), and no decision of
this Court has held that a grand jury witness has a right to
have her attorney present outside the jury room. We need
not decide today whether such a right exists, because Gabbert clearly had no standing to raise the alleged infringement of the rights of his client Tracy Baker. "[T]he plaintiff

generally must assert his own legal rights and interests, andcannot rest his claim to relief on the legal rights or interests

of third parties." Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490, 499 (1975).Gabbert of course does have standing to complain of the
allegedly unreasonable timing of the execution of the searchwarrant to prevent him from advising his client. In essence
then, he argues that the prosecutors searched him in anunreasonable manner. We have held that where another

provision of the Constitution "provides an explicit textualsource of constitutional protection," a court must assess a
plaintiff 's claims under that explicit provision and "not themore generalized notion of `substantive due process.' "

Graham v. Connor, 490 U. S. 386, 395 (1989). Challenges to thereasonableness of a search by government agents clearly fall

under the Fourth Amendment, and not the Fourteenth.We hold that the Fourteenth Amendment right to practice
one's calling is not violated by the execution of a search war-rant, whether calculated to annoy or even to prevent consultation with a grand jury witness. In so holding, we thus ofcourse pretermit the question whether such a right was
"clearly established" as of a given day. The judgment of

the Court of Appeals holding to the contrary is thereforereversed.

It is so ordered.
Justice Stevens, concurring in the judgment.
Respondent claims that petitioners violated his constitutional right to practice his profession by unreasonably timingthe service and execution of a warrant to search his papers.

There is, however, no evidence that respondent's income,
reputation, clientele, or professional qualifications were ad-versely affected by the search. Nor is there any real evidence or allegation that respondent's client was substantiallyprejudiced by what occurred. See App. to Pet. for Cert.
B-17. Accordingly, despite the shabby character of petition-ers' conduct, I agree with the Court that it did not deprive

294 CONN v. GABBERT

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
respondent of liberty or property in violation of the Four-teenth Amendment.

My conclusion that the judgment of the Court of Appealsmust be reversed is reached independently of the question
whether petitioners may have violated the Fourth Amend-ment because their method of conducting the search was arguably unreasonable--an issue not squarely presented andargued by petitioners in this Court. If their conduct had
violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amend-ment, there is no reason why such a violation would cease to
exist just because they also violated some other constitu-tional provision. Thus the suggestion in the penultimate
paragraph of the Court's opinion--that the possible existenceof a second source of constitutional protection provides a sufficient reason for reversal, ante, at 293--is quite unpersua-sive. Indeed, if that ground for decision were valid, most of
the reasoning in the preceding pages of the Court's opinionwould be unnecessary to the decision.

WYOMING v. HOUGHTON
certiorari to the supreme court of wyoming
No. 98-184. Argued January 12, 1999--Decided April 5, 1999
During a routine traffic stop, a Wyoming Highway Patrol officer noticed a

hypodermic syringe in the driver's shirt pocket, which the driver admitted using to take drugs. The officer then searched the passenger
compartment for contraband, removing and searching what respondent,
a passenger in the car, claimed was her purse. He found drug paraphernalia there and arrested respondent on drug charges. The trial
court denied her motion to suppress all evidence from the purse as the
fruit of an unlawful search, holding that the officer had probable cause
to search the car for contraband, and, by extension, any containers
therein that could hold such contraband. Respondent was convicted.
In reversing, the Wyoming Supreme Court ruled that an officer with
probable cause to search a vehicle may search all containers that might
conceal the object of the search; but, if the officer knows or should know
that a container belongs to a passenger who is not suspected of criminal
activity, then the container is outside the scope of the search unless
someone had the opportunity to conceal contraband within it to avoid
detection. Applying that rule here, the court concluded that the search
violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.

Held: Police officers with probable cause to search a car, as in this case,

may inspect passengers' belongings found in the car that are capable of
concealing the object of the search. In determining whether a particular governmental action violates the Fourth Amendment, this Court inquires first whether the action was regarded as an unlawful search or
seizure under common law when the Amendment was framed, see, e. g.,
Wilson v. Arkansas, 514 U. S. 927, 931. Where that inquiry yields no
answer, the Court must evaluate the search or seizure under traditional
reasonableness standards by balancing an individual's privacy interests
against legitimate governmental interests, see, e. g., Vernonia School
Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U. S. 646, 652-653. This Court has concluded
that the Framers would have regarded as reasonable the warrantless
search of a car that police had probable cause to believe contained contraband, Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132, as well as the warrantless search of containers within the automobile, United States v. Ross,
456 U. S. 798. Neither Ross nor the historical evidence it relied upon
admits of a distinction based on ownership. The analytical principle
underlying Ross's rule is also fully consistent with the balance of this

296 WYOMING v. HOUGHTON

Syllabus
Court's Fourth Amendment jurisprudence. Even if the historical evidence were equivocal, the balancing of the relative interests weighs decidedly in favor of searching a passenger's belongings. Passengers, no
less than drivers, possess a reduced expectation of privacy with regard
to the property they transport in cars. See, e. g., Cardwell v. Lewis,
417 U. S. 583, 590. The degree of intrusiveness of a package search
upon personal privacy and personal dignity is substantially less than the
degree of intrusiveness of the body searches at issue in United States
v. Di Re, 332 U. S. 581, and Ybarra v. Illinois, 444 U. S. 85. In contrast
to the passenger's reduced privacy expectations, the governmental interest in effective law enforcement would be appreciably impaired without the ability to search the passenger's belongings, since an automobile's ready mobility creates the risk that evidence or contraband will
be permanently lost while a warrant is obtained, California v. Carney,
471 U. S. 386; since a passenger may have an interest in concealing
evidence of wrongdoing in a common enterprise with the driver,
cf. Maryland v. Wilson, 519 U. S. 408, 413-414; and since a criminal
might be able to hide contraband in a passenger's belongings as readily
as in other containers in the car, see, e. g., Rawlings v. Kentucky, 448
U. S. 98, 102. The Wyoming Supreme Court's "passenger property"
rule would be unworkable in practice. Finally, an exception from the
historical practice described in Ross protecting only a passenger's property, rather than property belonging to anyone other than the driver,
would be less sensible than the rule that a package may be searched,
whether or not its owner is present as a passenger or otherwise, because
it might contain the object of the search. Pp. 299-307.

Opinion of the Court
passengers in the front seat of the car: David Young (thedriver), his girlfriend, and respondent. While questioning

Young, the officer noticed a hypodermic syringe in Young'sshirt pocket. He left the occupants under the supervision
of two backup officers as he went to get gloves from his patrol car. Upon his return, he instructed Young to step outof the car and place the syringe on the hood. The officer

then asked Young why he had a syringe; with refreshingcandor, Young replied that he used it to take drugs.

At this point, the backup officers ordered the two femalepassengers out of the car and asked them for identification.
Respondent falsely identified herself as "Sandra James" and
stated that she did not have any identification. Meanwhile,
in light of Young's admission, the officer searched the passenger compartment of the car for contraband. On the back
seat, he found a purse, which respondent claimed as hers.
He removed from the purse a wallet containing respondent's driver's license, identifying her properly as Sandra K.
Houghton. When the officer asked her why she had lied
about her name, she replied: "In case things went bad."

Continuing his search of the purse, the officer found a
brown pouch and a black wallet-type container. Respondent
denied that the former was hers, and claimed ignorance of
how it came to be there; it was found to contain drug paraphernalia and a syringe with 60 ccs of methamphetamine.
Respondent admitted ownership of the black container,
which was also found to contain drug paraphernalia, and
a syringe (which respondent acknowledged was hers) with
10 ccs of methamphetamine--an amount insufficient to support the felony conviction at issue in this case. The officer
also found fresh needle-track marks on respondent's arms.
He placed her under arrest.

The State of Wyoming charged respondent with felony
possession of methamphetamine in a liquid amount greater
than three-tenths of a gram. See Wyo. Stat. Ann. $ 35-7-
1031(c)(iii) (Supp. 1996). After a hearing, the trial court de526US2 Unit: $U44 [12-11-00 17:59:45] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
nied her motion to suppress all evidence obtained from thepurse as the fruit of a violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth

Amendments. The court held that the officer had probablecause to search the car for contraband, and, by extension,
any containers therein that could hold such contraband. Ajury convicted respondent as charged.

The Wyoming Supreme Court, by divided vote, reversedthe conviction and announced the following rule:

"Generally, once probable cause is established to searcha vehicle, an officer is entitled to search all containers
therein which may contain the object of the search.However, if the officer knows or should know that a container is the personal effect of a passenger who is notsuspected of criminal activity, then the container is outside the scope of the search unless someone had the op-portunity to conceal the contraband within the personal
effect to avoid detection." 956 P. 2d 363, 372 (1998).
The court held that the search of respondent's purse violatedthe Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments because the officer

"knew or should have known that the purse did not belongto the driver, but to one of the passengers," and because
"there was no probable cause to search the passengers' per-sonal effects and no reason to believe that contraband had
been placed within the purse." Ibid. We granted certio-rari, 524 U. S. 983 (1998).

II
The Fourth Amendment protects "[t]he right of the peopleto be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects,

against unreasonable searches and seizures." In determin-ing whether a particular governmental action violates this
provision, we inquire first whether the action was regardedas an unlawful search or seizure under the common law when
the Amendment was framed. See Wilson v. Arkansas, 514U. S. 927, 931 (1995);

California v. Hodari D., 499 U. S. 621,624 (1991). Where that inquiry yields no answer, we must

Opinion of the Court
evaluate the search or seizure under traditional standards ofreasonableness by assessing, on the one hand, the degree to

which it intrudes upon an individual's privacy and, on theother, the degree to which it is needed for the promotion
of legitimate governmental interests. See, e. g., Vernonia
School Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U. S. 646, 652-653 (1995).It is uncontested in the present case that the police officers

had probable cause to believe there were illegal drugs in thecar. Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132 (1925), similarly
involved the warrantless search of a car that law enforce-ment officials had probable cause to believe contained contraband--in that case, bootleg liquor. The Court concludedthat the Framers would have regarded such a search as reasonable in light of legislation enacted by Congress from 1789through 1799--as well as subsequent legislation from the
founding era and beyond--that empowered customs officialsto search any ship or vessel without a warrant if they had
probable cause to believe that it contained goods subject toa duty.

Id., at 150-153. See also United States v. Ross,456 U. S. 798, 806 (1982);

Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S.616, 623-624 (1886). Thus, the Court held that "contraband

goods concealed and illegally transported in an automobile orother vehicle may be searched for without a warrant" where
probable cause exists. Carroll, supra, at 153.We have furthermore read the historical evidence to show
that the Framers would have regarded as reasonable (ifthere was probable cause) the warrantless search of containers within an automobile. In Ross, supra, we upheld as rea-sonable the warrantless search of a paper bag and leather
pouch found in the trunk of the defendant's car by officerswho had probable cause to believe that the trunk contained
drugs. Justice Stevens, writing for the Court, observed:

"It is noteworthy that the early legislation on whichthe Court relied in Carroll concerned the enforcement

of laws imposing duties on imported merchandise. . . .Presumably such merchandise was shipped then in con526US2 Unit: $U44 [12-11-00 17:59:45] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
tainers of various kinds, just as it is today. Since Con-gress had authorized warrantless searches of vessels and

beasts for imported merchandise, it is inconceivable thatit intended a customs officer to obtain a warrant for
every package discovered during the search; certainlyCongress intended customs officers to open shipping
containers when necessary and not merely to examinethe exterior of cartons or boxes in which smuggled
goods might be concealed. During virtually the entirehistory of our country--whether contraband was transported in a horse-drawn carriage, a 1921 roadster, or amodern automobile--it has been assumed that a lawful
search of a vehicle would include a search of any con-tainer that might conceal the object of the search." Id.,
at 820, n. 26.
Ross summarized its holding as follows: "If probable causejustifies the search of a lawfully stopped vehicle, it justifies

the search of every part of the vehicle and its contents thatmay conceal the object of the search."

Id., at 825 (emphasisadded). And our later cases describing Ross have characterized it as applying broadly to all containers within a car,without qualification as to ownership. See, e. g., California
v. Acevedo, 500 U. S. 565, 572 (1991) ("[T]his Court in Rosstook the critical step of saying that closed containers in cars
could be searched without a warrant because of their pres-ence within the automobile");

United States v. Johns, 469U. S. 478, 479-480 (1985) (Ross "held that if police officers

have probable cause to search a lawfully stopped vehicle,they may conduct a warrantless search of any containers
found inside that may conceal the object of the search").To be sure, there was no passenger in

Ross, and it was notclaimed that the package in the trunk belonged to anyone

other than the driver. Even so, if the rule of law that Rossannounced were limited to contents belonging to the driver,
or contents other than those belonging to passengers, onewould have expected that substantial limitation to be ex526US2 Unit: $U44 [12-11-00 17:59:45] PAGES PGT: OPIN
302 WYOMING v. HOUGHTON

Opinion of the Court
pressed. And, more importantly, one would have expectedthat limitation to be apparent in the historical evidence that

formed the basis for Ross's holding. In fact, however, noth-ing in the statutes

Ross relied upon, or in the practice under
those statutes, would except from authorized warrantless
search packages belonging to passengers on the suspect ship,horse-drawn carriage, or automobile.

Finally, we must observe that the analytical principle un-derlying the rule announced in

Ross is fully consistent--as
respondent's proposal is not--with the balance of our FourthAmendment jurisprudence.

Ross concluded from the historical evidence that the permissible scope of a warrantless
car search "is defined by the object of the search and the
places in which there is probable cause to believe that it may
be found." 456 U. S., at 824. The same principle is reflected in an earlier case involving the constitutionality of a
search warrant directed at premises belonging to one who is
not suspected of any crime: "The critical element in a reasonable search is not that the owner of the property is suspected
of crime but that there is reasonable cause to believe that
the specific `things' to be searched for and seized are located
on the property to which entry is sought." Zurcher v. Stanford Daily, 436 U. S. 547, 556 (1978). This statement was
illustrated by citation and description of Carroll, 267 U. S.,
at 158-159, 167. 436 U. S., at 556-557.

In sum, neither Ross itself nor the historical evidence it
relied upon admits of a distinction among packages or containers based on ownership. When there is probable cause
to search for contraband in a car, it is reasonable for police
officers--like customs officials in the founding era--to examine packages and containers without a showing of individualized probable cause for each one. A passenger's personal
belongings, just like the driver's belongings or containers
attached to the car like a glove compartment, are "in" the
car, and the officer has probable cause to search for contraband in the car.

Opinion of the Court
Even if the historical evidence, as described by Ross, werethought to be equivocal, we would find that the balancing of

the relative interests weighs decidedly in favor of allowingsearches of a passenger's belongings. Passengers, no less
than drivers, possess a reduced expectation of privacy withregard to the property that they transport in cars, which
"trave[l] public thoroughfares," Cardwell v. Lewis, 417 U. S.583, 590 (1974), "seldom serv[e] as . . . the repository of personal effects," ibid., are subjected to police stop and exami-nation to enforce "pervasive" governmental controls "[a]s an
everyday occurrence," South Dakota v. Opperman, 428 U. S.
364, 368 (1976), and, finally, are exposed to traffic accidents
that may render all their contents open to public scrutiny.In this regard--the degree of intrusiveness upon personal

privacy and indeed even personal dignity--the two cases theWyoming Supreme Court found dispositive differ substantially from the package search at issue here. United Statesv.

Di Re, 332 U. S. 581 (1948), held that probable cause to
search a car did not justify a body search of a passenger.And

Ybarra v. Illinois, 444 U. S. 85 (1979), held that a search
warrant for a tavern and its bartender did not permit body
searches of all the bar's patrons. These cases turned on theunique, significantly heightened protection afforded against

searches of one's person. "Even a limited search of theouter clothing . . . constitutes a severe, though brief, intrusion upon cherished personal security, and it must surely bean annoying, frightening, and perhaps humiliating experience." Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1, 24-25 (1968). Such trau-matic consequences are not to be expected when the police
examine an item of personal property found in a car.1

1 The dissent begins its analysis, post, at 309-310 (opinion of Stevens,
J.), with an assertion that this case is governed by our decision in United
States v. Di Re, 332 U. S. 581 (1948), which held, as the dissent describes it,
that the automobile exception to the warrant requirement did not justify
"searches of the passenger's pockets and the space between his shirt and
underwear," post, at 309. It attributes that holding to "the settled dis526US2 Unit: $U44 [12-11-00 17:59:45] PAGES PGT: OPIN
304 WYOMING v. HOUGHTON

Opinion of the Court
Whereas the passenger's privacy expectations are, as wehave described, considerably diminished, the governmental

interests at stake are substantial. Effective law enforce-ment would be appreciably impaired without the ability to
search a passenger's personal belongings when there is reason to believe contraband or evidence of criminal wrongdoingis hidden in the car. As in all car-search cases, the "ready

mobility" of an automobile creates a risk that the evidenceor contraband will be permanently lost while a warrant is
obtained. California v. Carney, 471 U. S. 386, 390 (1985).In addition, a car passenger--unlike the unwitting tavern
patron in Ybarra--will often be engaged in a common en-terprise with the driver, and have the same interest in

tinction between drivers and passengers," rather than to a distinction between search of the person and search of property, which the dissent
claims is "newly minted" by today's opinion--a "new rule that is based on
a distinction between property contained in clothing worn by a passenger
and property contained in a passenger's briefcase or purse." Post, at
309, 309-310.

In its peroration, however, the dissent quotes extensively from Justice
Jackson's opinion in Di Re, which makes it very clear that it is precisely
this distinction between search of the person and search of property that
the case relied upon:

"The Government says it would not contend that, armed with a search
warrant for a residence only, it could search all persons found in it. But
an occupant of a house could be used to conceal this contraband on his
person quite as readily as can an occupant of a car." 332 U. S., at 587
(quoted post, at 312).

Does the dissent really believe that Justice Jackson was saying that a
house search could not inspect property belonging to persons found in the
house--say a large standing safe or violin case belonging to the owner's
visiting godfather? Of course that is not what Justice Jackson meant at
all. He was referring precisely to that "distinction between property contained in clothing worn by a passenger and property contained in a passenger's briefcase or purse" that the dissent disparages, post, at 309. This
distinction between searches of the person and searches of property is
assuredly not "newly minted," see post, at 310. And if the dissent thinks
"pockets" and "clothing" do not count as part of the person, it must believe
that the only searches of the person are strip searches.

Opinion of the Court
concealing the fruits or the evidence of their wrongdoing.
Cf. Maryland v. Wilson, 519 U. S. 408, 413-414 (1997). A
criminal might be able to hide contraband in a passenger's
belongings as readily as in other containers in the car, see,
e. g., Rawlings v. Kentucky, 448 U. S. 98, 102 (1980)--perhaps
even surreptitiously, without the passenger's knowledge or
permission. (This last possibility provided the basis for
respondent's defense at trial; she testified that most of the
seized contraband must have been placed in her purse by
her traveling companions at one or another of various times,
including the time she was "half asleep" in the car.)

To be sure, these factors favoring a search will not always
be present, but the balancing of interests must be conducted
with an eye to the generality of cases. To require that the
investigating officer have positive reason to believe that the
passenger and driver were engaged in a common enterprise,
or positive reason to believe that the driver had time and
occasion to conceal the item in the passenger's belongings,
surreptitiously or with friendly permission, is to impose requirements so seldom met that a "passenger's property" rule
would dramatically reduce the ability to find and seize contraband and evidence of crime. Of course these requirements would not attach (under the Wyoming Supreme
Court's rule) until the police officer knows or has reason to
know that the container belongs to a passenger. But once a
"passenger's property" exception to car searches became
widely known, one would expect passenger-confederates to
claim everything as their own. And one would anticipate a
bog of litigation--in the form of both civil lawsuits and motions to suppress in criminal trials--involving such questions
as whether the officer should have believed a passenger's
claim of ownership, whether he should have inferred ownership from various objective factors, whether he had probable
cause to believe that the passenger was a confederate, or to
believe that the driver might have introduced the contraband

into the package with or without the passenger's knowledge.2When balancing the competing interests, our determinations

of "reasonableness" under the Fourth Amendment must takeaccount of these practical realities. We think they militate
in favor of the needs of law enforcement, and against apersonal-privacy interest that is ordinarily weak.

Finally, if we were to invent an exception from the histori-cal practice that

Ross accurately described and summarized,it is perplexing why that exception should protect only property belonging to a passenger, rather than (what seems muchmore logical) property belonging to anyone other than the
driver. Surely Houghton's privacy would have been invadedto the same degree whether she was present or absent when
her purse was searched. And surely her presence in the carwith the driver provided more, rather than less, reason to
believe that the two were in league. It may ordinarily beeasier to identify the property as belonging to someone other
than the driver when the purported owner is present to iden-tify it--but in the many cases (like

Ross itself) where thecar is seized, that identification may occur later, at the sta2 The dissent is "confident in a police officer's ability to apply a rule
requiring a warrant or individualized probable cause to search belongings
that are . . . obviously owned by and in the custody of a passenger," post,
at 311. If this is the dissent's strange criterion for warrant protection
("obviously owned by and in the custody of") its preceding paean to the
importance of preserving passengers' privacy rings a little hollow on rehearing. Should it not be enough if the passenger says he owns the briefcase, and the officer has no concrete reason to believe otherwise? Or
would the dissent consider that an example of "obvious" ownership? On
reflection, it seems not at all obvious precisely what constitutes obviousness--and so even the dissent's on-the-cheap protection of passengers' privacy interest in their property turns out to be unclear, and hence
unadministrable. But maybe the dissent does not mean to propose an
obviously-owned-by-and-in-the-custody-of test after all, since a few sentences later it endorses, simpliciter, "a rule requiring a warrant or individualized probable cause to search passenger belongings," post, at 312.
For the reasons described in text, that will not work.

tion house; and even at the site of the stop one can readilyimagine a package clearly marked with the owner's name

and phone number, by which the officer can confirm the driv-er's denial of ownership. The sensible rule (and the one supported by history and case law) is that such a package maybe searched, whether or not its owner is present as a passenger or otherwise, because it may contain the contraband thatthe officer has reason to believe is in the car.

* * *
We hold that police officers with probable cause to searcha car may inspect passengers' belongings found in the car

that are capable of concealing the object of the search. Thejudgment of the Wyoming Supreme Court is reversed.

It is so ordered.
Justice Breyer, concurring.
I join the Court's opinion with the understanding that his-tory is meant to inform, but not automatically to determine,

the answer to a Fourth Amendment question. Ante, at 299-300. I also agree with the Court that when a police officer
has probable cause to search a car, say, for drugs, it is reason-able for that officer also to search containers within the car.
If the police must establish a container's ownership prior tothe search of that container (whenever, for example, a passenger says "that's mine"), the resulting uncertainty will de-stroy the workability of the bright-line rule set forth in
United States v. Ross, 456 U. S. 798 (1982). At the sametime, police officers with probable cause to search a car for
drugs would often have probable cause to search containersregardless. Hence a bright-line rule will authorize only a
limited number of searches that the law would not other-wise justify.

At the same time, I would point out certain limitationsupon the scope of the bright-line rule that the Court de526US2 Unit: $U44 [12-11-00 17:59:45] PAGES PGT: OPIN

scribes. Obviously, the rule applies only to automobilesearches. Equally obviously, the rule applies only to containers found within automobiles. And it does not extendto the search of a person found in that automobile. As the
Court notes, and as United States v. Di Re, 332 U. S. 581,
586-587 (1948), relied on heavily by Justice Stevens' dis-sent, makes clear, the search of a person, including even " `a

limited search of the outer clothing,' " ante, at 303 (quoting
Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1, 24-25 (1968)), is a very different
matter in respect to which the law provides "significantlyheightened protection."

Ante, at 303; cf. Ybarra v. Illinois,
444 U. S. 85, 91 (1979); Sibron v. New York, 392 U. S. 40,
62-64 (1968).

Less obviously, but in my view also important, is the fact
that the container here at issue, a woman's purse, was found
at a considerable distance from its owner, who did not claim
ownership until the officer discovered her identification while
looking through it. Purses are special containers. They
are repositories of especially personal items that people generally like to keep with them at all times. So I am tempted
to say that a search of a purse involves an intrusion so similar to a search of one's person that the same rule should
govern both. However, given this Court's prior cases,
I cannot argue that the fact that the container was a purse
automatically makes a legal difference, for the Court has
warned against trying to make that kind of distinction.
United States v. Ross, supra, at 822. But I can say that it
would matter if a woman's purse, like a man's billfold, were
attached to her person. It might then amount to a kind of
"outer clothing," Terry v. Ohio, supra, at 24, which under
the Court's cases would properly receive increased protection. See post, at 312-313 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (quoting
United States v. Di Re, supra, at 587). In this case, the
purse was separate from the person, and no one has claimed
that, under those circumstances, the type of container makes
a difference. For that reason, I join the Court's opinion.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Souter and
Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.

After Wyoming's highest court decided that a state high-way patrolman unlawfully searched Sandra Houghton's

purse, the State of Wyoming petitioned for a writ of cer-tiorari. The State asked that we consider the propriety of
searching an automobile passenger's belongings when thegovernment has developed probable cause to search the vehicle for contraband based on the driver's conduct. The Stateconceded that the trooper who searched Houghton's purse
lacked a warrant, consent, or "probable cause specific to thepurse or passenger." Pet. for Cert. i. In light of our established preference for warrants and individualized suspicion,I would respect the result reached by the Wyoming Supreme
Court and affirm its judgment.In all of our prior cases applying the automobile exception
to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement, either thedefendant was the operator of the vehicle and in custody of
the object of the search, or no question was raised as to thedefendant's ownership or custody.

1 In the only automobile

case confronting the search of a passenger defendant--United States v. Di Re, 332 U. S. 581 (1948)--the Court held

that the exception to the warrant requirement did not apply.Id., at 583-587 (addressing searches of the passenger's pockets and the space between his shirt and underwear, both ofwhich uncovered counterfeit fuel rations). In Di Re, as
here, the information prompting the search directly impli-cated the driver, not the passenger. Today, instead of adhering to the settled distinction between drivers and pas-sengers, the Court fashions a new rule that is based on a
distinction between property contained in clothing worn by

Stevens, J., dissenting
a passenger and property contained in a passenger's brief-case or purse. In cases on both sides of the Court's newly

minted test, the property is in a "container" (whether apocket or a pouch) located in the vehicle. Moreover, unlike
the Court, I think it quite plain that the search of a passen-ger's purse or briefcase involves an intrusion on privacy that
may be just as serious as was the intrusion in Di Re. See,
e. g., New Jersey v. T. L. O., 469 U. S. 325, 339 (1985); Ex parteJackson, 96 U. S. 727, 733 (1878).

Even apart from Di Re, the Court's rights-restrictive ap-proach is not dictated by precedent. For example, in United
States v. Ross, 456 U. S. 798 (1982), we were concerned withthe interest of the driver in the integrity of "his automobile,"
id., at 823, and we categorically rejected the notion that thescope of a warrantless search of a vehicle might be "defined
by the nature of the container in which the contraband issecreted,"

id., at 824. "Rather, it is defined by the object ofthe search and the places in which there is probable cause to

believe that it may be found." Ibid. We thus disapprovedof a possible container-based distinction between a man's
pocket and a woman's pocketbook. Ironically, while we con-cluded in

Ross that "[p]robable cause to believe that a con-tainer placed in the trunk of a taxi contains contraband or

evidence does not justify a search of the entire cab," ibid.,the rule the Court fashions would apparently permit a warrantless search of a passenger's briefcase if there is probablecause to believe the taxidriver had a syringe somewhere in
his vehicle.Nor am I persuaded that the mere spatial association between a passenger and a driver provides an acceptable basisfor presuming that they are partners in crime or for ignoring
privacy interests in a purse.2 Whether or not the Fourth

2 See United States v. Di Re, 332 U. S. 581, 587 (1948) ("We are not
convinced that a person, by mere presence in a suspected car, loses
immunities from search of his person to which he would otherwise be
entitled"); Chandler v. Miller, 520 U. S. 305, 308 (1997) (emphasizing in526US2 Unit: $U44 [12-11-00 17:59:45] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Amendment required a warrant to search Houghton's purse,cf. Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132, 153 (1925), at the

very least the trooper in this case had to have probable causeto believe that her purse contained contraband. The Wyoming Supreme Court concluded that he did not. 956 P. 2d363, 372 (1998); see App. 20-21.

Finally, in my view, the State's legitimate interest in effec-tive law enforcement does not outweigh the privacy concerns
at issue.3 I am as confident in a police officer's ability toapply a rule requiring a warrant or individualized probable
cause to search belongings that are--as in this case--obvi-ously owned by and in the custody of a passenger as is the
Court in a "passenger-confederate[']s" ability to circumventthe rule.

Ante, at 305. Certainly the ostensible clarity ofthe Court's rule is attractive. But that virtue is insufficient

justification for its adoption. Arizona v. Hicks, 480 U. S.
dividualized suspicion); Ybarra v. Illinois, 444 U. S. 85, 91, 94-96 (1979)
(explaining that "a person's mere propinquity to others independently suspected of criminal activity does not, without more, give rise to probable
cause to search that person," and discussing Di Re); Brown v. Texas, 443
U. S. 47, 52 (1979); Sibron v. New York, 392 U. S. 40, 62-63 (1968); see also
United States v. Padilla, 508 U. S. 77, 82 (1993) (per curiam) ("Expectations of privacy and property interests govern the analysis of Fourth
Amendment search and seizure claims. Participants in a criminal conspiracy may have such expectations or interests, but the conspiracy itself
neither adds to nor detracts from them").

3 To my knowledge, we have never restricted ourselves to a two-step

Fourth Amendment approach wherein the privacy and governmental interests at stake must be considered only if 18th-century common law
"yields no answer." Ante, at 299. Neither the precedent cited by the
Court, nor the majority's opinion in this case, mandate that approach. In
a later discussion, the Court does attempt to address the contemporary
privacy and governmental interests at issue in cases of this nature. Ante,
at 303-306. Either the majority is unconvinced by its own recitation of
the historical materials, or it has determined that considering additional
factors is appropriate in any event. The Court does not admit the former;
and of course the latter, standing alone, would not establish uncertainty
in the common law as the prerequisite to looking beyond history in Fourth
Amendment cases.

Stevens, J., dissenting
321, 329 (1987); Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U. S. 385, 393 (1978).Moreover, a rule requiring a warrant or individualized probable cause to search passenger belongings is every bit assimple as the Court's rule; it simply protects more privacy.

I would decide this case in accord with what we have said
about passengers and privacy, rather than what we might
have said in cases where the issue was not squarely presented. See ante, at 301-302. What Justice Jackson wrotefor the Court 50 years ago is just as sound today:

"The Government says it would not contend that,
armed with a search warrant for a residence only, it
could search all persons found in it. But an occupant ofa house could be used to conceal this contraband on his

person quite as readily as can an occupant of a car. Ne-cessity, an argument advanced in support of this search,
would seem as strong a reason for searching guests ofa house for which a search warrant had issued as for
search of guests in a car for which none had been issued.
By a parity of reasoning with that on which the Govern-ment disclaims the right to search occupants of a house,

we suppose the Government would not contend that ifit had a valid search warrant for the car only it could
search the occupants as an incident to its execution.How then could we say that the right to search a car
without a warrant confers greater latitude to search oc-cupants than a search by warrant would permit?

"We see no ground for expanding the ruling in the
Carroll case to justify this arrest and search as incidentto the search of a car. We are not convinced that a

person, by mere presence in a suspected car, loses immunities from search of his person to which he would
otherwise be entitled." Di Re, 332 U. S., at 587.

warrantless automobile search based on probable cause is
"no broader" than the proper scope of a search authorized

by a warrant supported by probable cause).4 Instead ofapplying ordinary Fourth Amendment principles to this case,

the majority extends the automobile warrant exception toallow searches of passenger belongings based on the driver's
misconduct. Thankfully, the Court's automobile-centeredanalysis limits the scope of its holding. But it does not justify the outcome in this case.I respectfully dissent.

4 In response to this dissent the Court has crafted an imaginative footnote suggesting that the Di Re decision rested, not on Di Re's status as a
mere occupant of the vehicle and the importance of individualized suspicion, but rather on the intrusive character of the search. See ante, at
303-304, n. 1. That the search of a safe or violin case would be less intrusive than a strip search does not, however, persuade me that the Di Re
case would have been decided differently if Di Re had been a woman and
the gas coupons had been found in her purse. Significantly, in commenting on the Carroll case immediately preceding the paragraphs that I have
quoted in the text, the Di Re Court stated: "But even the National Prohibition Act did not direct the arrest of all occupants but only of the person
in charge of the offending vehicle, though there is better reason to assume
that no passenger in a car loaded with liquor would remain innocent of
knowledge of the car's cargo than to assume that a passenger must know
what pieces of paper are carried in the pockets of the driver." United
States v. Di Re, 332 U. S., at 586-587.

MITCHELL v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe third circuit

No. 97-7541. Argued December 9, 1998--Decided April 5, 1999
Petitioner pleaded guilty to federal charges of conspiring to distribute five

or more kilograms of cocaine and of distributing cocaine, but reserved
the right to contest at sentencing the drug quantity attributable under
the conspiracy count. Before accepting her plea, the District Court
made the inquiries required by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11;
told petitioner that she faced a mandatory minimum of 1 year in prison
for distributing cocaine, but a 10-year minimum for conspiracy if the
Government could show the required five kilograms; and explained that
by pleading guilty she would be waiving, inter alia, her right "at trial
to remain silent." Indicating that she had done "some of" the proffered
conduct, petitioner confirmed her guilty plea. At her sentencing hearing, three codefendants testified that she had sold 11/2 to 2 ounces of
cocaine twice a week for 11/2 years, and another person testified that
petitioner had sold her two ounces of cocaine. Petitioner put on no
evidence and argued that the only reliable evidence showed that she had
sold only two ounces of cocaine. The District Court ruled that as a
consequence of petitioner's guilty plea, she had no right to remain silent
about her crime's details; found that the codefendants' testimony put
her over the 5-kilogram threshold, thus mandating the 10-year minimum; and noted that her failure to testify was a factor in persuading
the court to rely on the codefendants' testimony. The Third Circuit
affirmed.

Held:

1. In the federal criminal system, a guilty plea does not waive the
self-incrimination privilege at sentencing. Pp. 321-327.

(a) The well-established rule that a witness, in a single proceeding,
may not testify voluntarily about a subject and then invoke the privilege
against self-incrimination when questioned about the details is justified
by the fact that a witness may not pick and choose what aspects of a
particular subject to discuss without casting doubt on the statements'
trustworthiness and diminishing the factual inquiry's integrity. The
privilege is waived for matters to which the witness testifies, and the
waiver's scope is determined by the scope of relevant cross-examination.
Brown v. United States, 356 U. S. 148, 154. The concerns justifying
cross-examination at trial are absent at a plea colloquy, which protects

526US2 Unit: $U45 [01-03-01 13:28:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN

315Cite as: 526 U. S. 314 (1999)
Syllabus
the defendant from an unintelligent or involuntary plea. There is no
convincing reason why the narrow inquiry at this stage should entail an
extensive waiver of the privilege. A defendant who takes the stand
cannot reasonably claim immunity on the matter he has himself put in
dispute, but the defendant who pleads guilty takes matters out of dispute, leaving little danger that the court will be misled by selective
disclosure. Here, petitioner's "some of" statement did not pose a threat
to the factfinding proceeding's integrity, for the purpose of the District
Court's inquiry was simply to ensure that she understood the charges
and there was a factual basis for the Government's case. Nor does Rule
11 contemplate a broad waiver. Its purpose is to inform the defendant
of what she loses by forgoing a trial, not to elicit a waiver of privileges
that exist beyond the trial's confines. Treating a guilty plea as a waiver
of the privilege would be a grave encroachment on defendants' rights.
It would allow prosecutors to indict without specifying a drug quantity,
obtain a guilty plea, and then put the defendant on the stand at sentencing to fill in the quantity. To enlist a defendant as an instrument of his
or her own condemnation would undermine the long tradition and vital
principle that criminal proceedings rely on accusations proved by the
Government, not on inquisitions conducted to enhance its own prosecutorial power. Rogers v. Richmond, 365 U. S. 534, 541. Pp. 321-325.

(b) Where a sentence has yet to be imposed, this Court has already
rejected the proposition that incrimination is complete once guilt has
been adjudicated. See Estelle v. Smith, 451 U. S. 454, 462. That proposition applies only to cases in which the sentence has been fixed and
the judgment of conviction has become final. See, e. g., Reina v. United
States, 364 U. S. 507, 513. Before sentencing a defendant may have a
legitimate fear of adverse consequences from further testimony, and any
effort to compel that testimony at sentencing "clearly would contravene
the Fifth Amendment," Estelle, supra, at 463. Estelle was a capital
case, but there is no reason not to apply its principle to noncapital sentencing hearings. The Fifth Amendment prevents a person from being
compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself. To
maintain that sentencing proceedings are not part of "any criminal case"
is contrary to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and to common
sense. Pp. 325-327.

2. A sentencing court may not draw an adverse inference from a defendant's silence in determining facts relating to the circumstances and
details of the crime. The normal rule in a criminal case permits no
negative inference from a defendant's failure to testify. See Griffin v.
California, 380 U. S. 609, 614. A sentencing hearing is part of the
criminal case, and the concerns mandating the rule against negative
inferences at trial apply with equal force at sentencing. This holding

316 MITCHELL v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
is a product not only of Griffin but also of Estelle's conclusion that there
is no basis for distinguishing between a criminal case's guilt and sentencing phases so far as the protection of the Fifth Amendment privilege is concerned. There is little doubt that the rule against adverse
inferences has become an essential feature of the Nation's legal tradition, teaching that the Government must prove its allegations while
respecting the defendant's individual rights. The Court expresses no
opinion on the questions whether silence bears upon the determination
of lack of remorse, or upon acceptance of responsibility for the offense
for purposes of a downward adjustment under the United States Sentencing Guidelines. Pp. 327-330.

Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.
Two questions relating to a criminal defendant's FifthAmendment privilege against self-incrimination are presented to us. The first is whether, in the federal criminalsystem, a guilty plea waives the privilege in the sentencing
phase of the case, either as a result of the colloquy precedingthe plea or by operation of law when the plea is entered.
We hold the plea is not a waiver of the privilege at sentenc-ing. The second question is whether, in determining facts

Petitioner Amanda Mitchell and 22 other defendants wereindicted for offenses arising from a conspiracy to distribute

cocaine in Allentown, Pennsylvania, from 1989 to 1994. Ac-cording to the indictment, the leader of the conspiracy, Harry
Riddick, obtained large quantities of cocaine and resold thedrug through couriers and street sellers, including petitioner.
Petitioner was charged with one count of conspiring to dis-tribute five or more kilograms of cocaine, in violation of 21
U. S. C. $ 846, and with three counts of distributing cocainewithin 1,000 feet of a school or playground, in violation of

$ 860(a). In 1995, without any plea agreement, petitionerpleaded guilty to all four counts. She reserved the right
to contest the drug quantity attributable to her under theconspiracy count, and the District Court advised her the
drug quantity would be determined at her sentencinghearing.

Before accepting the plea, the District Court made the in-quiries required by Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal
Procedure. Informing petitioner of the penalties for her of-fenses, the District Judge advised her, "the range of punishment here is very complex because we don't know how muchcocaine the Government's going to be able to show you were
involved in." App. 39. The judge told petitioner she faceda mandatory minimum of one year in prison under $ 860 for
distributing cocaine near a school or playground. She alsofaced "serious punishment depending on the quantity involved" for the conspiracy, with a mandatory minimum of 10years in prison under $ 841 if she could be held responsible
for at least 5 kilograms but less than 15 kilograms of cocaine.Id., at 42. By pleading guilty, the District Court explained,

318 MITCHELL v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
petitioner would waive various rights, including "the rightat trial to remain silent under the Fifth Amendment."

Id.,
at 45.After the Government explained the factual basis for the

charges, the judge, having put petitioner under oath, asked
her, "Did you do that?" Petitioner answered, "Some of it."
Id., at 47. She indicated that, although present for one of
the transactions charged as a substantive cocaine distribu-tion count, she had not herself delivered the cocaine to the

customer. The Government maintained she was liable nev-ertheless as an aider and abettor of the delivery by another
courier. After discussion with her counsel, petitioner reaffirmed her intention to plead guilty to all the charges. The
District Court noted she might have a defense to one count
on the theory that she was present but did not aid or abet
the transaction. Petitioner again confirmed her intention to
plead guilty, and the District Court accepted the plea.

In 1996, 9 of petitioner's original 22 codefendants went
to trial. Three other codefendants had pleaded guilty and
agreed to cooperate with the Government. They testified
petitioner was a regular seller for ringleader Riddick. At
petitioner's sentencing hearing, the three adopted their trial
testimony, and one of them furnished additional information
on the amount of cocaine petitioner sold. According to him,
petitioner worked two to three times a week, selling 11/2 to 2
ounces of cocaine a day, from April 1992 to August 1992.
Then, from August 1992 to December 1993 she worked three
to five times a week, and from January 1994 to March 1994
she was one of those in charge of cocaine distribution for
Riddick. On cross-examination, the codefendant conceded
he had not seen petitioner on a regular basis during the relevant period.

Both petitioner and the Government referred to trial testimony by one Alvitta Mack, who had made a series of drug
buys under the supervision of law enforcement agents, including three purchases from petitioner totaling two ounces

Opinion of the Court
of cocaine in 1992. Petitioner put on no evidence at sentenc-ing, nor did she testify to rebut the Government's evidence

about drug quantity. Her counsel argued, however, that thethree documented sales to Mack constituted the only evidence of sufficient reliability to be credited in determining
the quantity of cocaine attributable to her for sentencingpurposes.

After this testimony at the sentencing hearing the DistrictCourt ruled that, as a consequence of her guilty plea, petitioner had no right to remain silent with respect to the de-tails of her crimes. The court found credible the testimony
indicating petitioner had been a drug courier on a regularbasis. Sales of 1

1/2 to 2 ounces twice a week for a year and

a half put her over the 5-kilogram threshold, thus mandatinga minimum sentence of 10 years. "One of the things" persuading the court to rely on the testimony of the codefend-ants was petitioner's "not testifying to the contrary."

Id.,
at 95.

The District Judge told petitioner:

" `I held it against you that you didn't come forwardtoday and tell me that you really only did this a couple

of times. . . . I'm taking the position that you should
come forward and explain your side of this issue." `Your counsel's taking the position that you have a

Fifth Amendment right not to. . . . If he's--if it's deter-mined by a higher Court that he's right in that regard,
I would be willing to bring you back for resentencing.And if you--if--and then I might take a closer look at
the [codefendants'] testimony.' " Id., at 98-99.
The District Court sentenced petitioner to the statutory
minimum of 10 years of imprisonment, 6 years of supervised
release, and a special assessment of $200.

The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed the
sentence. 122 F. 3d 185 (1997). According to the Court of
Appeals: "By voluntarily and knowingly pleading guilty to

Opinion of the Court
the offense Mitchell waived her Fifth Amendment privilege."
Id., at 189. The court acknowledged other Circuits have
held a witness can "claim the Fifth Amendment privilege ifhis or her testimony might be used to enhance his or her

sentence," id., at 190 (citing United States v. Garcia, 78 F. 3d
1457, 1463, and n. 8 (CA10), cert. denied, 517 U. S. 1239(1996)), but it said this rule "does not withstand analysis,"

122 F. 3d, at 191. The court thought it would be illogical to"fragment the sentencing process," retaining the privilege
against self-incrimination as to one or more components ofthe crime while waiving it as to others.

Ibid. Petitioner's
reservation of the right to contest the amount of drugsattributable to her did not change the court's analysis. In

the Court of Appeals' view:

"Mitchell opened herself up to the full range of possible
sentences for distributing cocaine when she was toldduring her plea colloquy that the penalty for conspiring

to distribute cocaine had a maximum of life imprisonment. While her reservation may have put the government to its proof as to the amount of drugs, her declination to testify on that issue could properly be held
against her." Ibid.

The court acknowledged a defendant may plead guilty and
retain the privilege with respect to other crimes, but it observed: "Mitchell does not claim that she could be implicated
in other crimes by testifying at her sentencing hearing, nor
could she be retried by the state for the same offense."
Ibid. (citing 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. $ 111 (1998), a statute that
bars, with certain exceptions, a state prosecution following
a federal conviction based on the same conduct).

Judge Michel concurred, reasoning that any error by the
District Court in drawing an adverse factual inference from
petitioner's silence was harmless because "the evidence
amply supported [the judge's] finding on quantity" even with526US2 Unit: $U45 [01-03-01 13:28:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
out consideration of petitioner's failure to testify. 122 F. 3d,at 192.

Other Circuits to have confronted the issue have held thata defendant retains the privilege at sentencing. See, e. g.,
United States v. Kuku, 129 F. 3d 1435, 1437-1438 (CA111997);

United States v. Garcia, 78 F. 3d 1457, 1463 (CA101996); United States v. De La Cruz, 996 F. 2d 1307, 1312-1313

1067, 1075-1076 (CA6 1990); United States v. Lugg, 892 F. 2d101, 102-103 (CADC 1989); United States v. Paris, 827 F. 2d
395, 398-399 (CA9 1987). We granted certiorari to resolvethe apparent Circuit conflict created by the Court of Appeals'
decision, 524 U. S. 925 (1998), and we now reverse.

II
The Government maintains that petitioner's guilty pleawas a waiver of the privilege against compelled selfincrimination with respect to all the crimes comprehendedin the plea. We hold otherwise and rule that petitioner
retained the privilege at her sentencing hearing.

A
It is well established that a witness, in a single proceeding,may not testify voluntarily about a subject and then invoke

the privilege against self-incrimination when questionedabout the details. See Rogers v. United States, 340 U. S.
367, 373 (1951). The privilege is waived for the matters towhich the witness testifies, and the scope of the "waiver is
determined by the scope of relevant cross-examination,"Brown v. United States, 356 U. S. 148, 154-155 (1958). "The
witness himself, certainly if he is a party, determines thearea of disclosure and therefore of inquiry,"

id., at 155. Nicequestions will arise, of course, about the extent of the initial

testimony and whether the ensuing questions are compre526US2 Unit: $U45 [01-03-01 13:28:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN
322 MITCHELL v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
hended within its scope, but for now it suffices to note thegeneral rule.

The justifications for the rule of waiver in the testimonialcontext are evident: A witness may not pick and choose what
aspects of a particular subject to discuss without casting
doubt on the trustworthiness of the statements and dimin-ishing the integrity of the factual inquiry. As noted in

Rogers, a contrary rule "would open the way to distortion offacts by permitting a witness to select any stopping place in

the testimony," 340 U. S., at 371. It would, as we said in
Brown, "make of the Fifth Amendment not only a humane
safeguard against judicially coerced self-disclosure but a
positive invitation to mutilate the truth a party offers to
tell," 356 U. S., at 156. The illogic of allowing a witness to
offer only self-selected testimony should be obvious even to
the witness, so there is no unfairness in allowing crossexamination when testimony is given without invoking the
privilege.

We may assume for purposes of this opinion, then, that if
petitioner had pleaded not guilty and, having taken the stand
at a trial, testified she did "some of it," she could have been
cross-examined on the frequency of her drug deliveries and
the quantity of cocaine involved. The concerns which justify the cross-examination when the defendant testifies are
absent at a plea colloquy, however. The purpose of a plea
colloquy is to protect the defendant from an unintelligent
or involuntary plea. The Government would turn this constitutional shield into a prosecutorial sword by having the
defendant relinquish all rights against compelled selfincrimination upon entry of a guilty plea, including the right
to remain silent at sentencing.

There is no convincing reason why the narrow inquiry at
the plea colloquy should entail such an extensive waiver of
the privilege. Unlike the defendant taking the stand, who
"cannot reasonably claim that the Fifth Amendment gives
him . . . an immunity from cross-examination on the matters

526US2 Unit: $U45 [01-03-01 13:28:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN

323Cite as: 526 U. S. 314 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
he has himself put in dispute," id., at 155-156, the defendantwho pleads guilty puts nothing in dispute regarding the essentials of the offense. Rather, the defendant takes thosematters out of dispute, often by making a joint statement
with the prosecution or confirming the prosecution's version
of the facts. Under these circumstances, there is little dan-ger that the court will be misled by selective disclosure. In

this respect a guilty plea is more like an offer to stipulatethan a decision to take the stand. Here, petitioner's statement that she had done "some of " the proffered conduct didnot pose a threat to the integrity of factfinding proceedings,
for the purpose of the District Court's inquiry was simply to
ensure that petitioner understood the charges and that there
was a factual basis for the Government's case.

Nor does Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11, which
governs pleas, contemplate the broad waiver the Government envisions. Rule 11 directs the district court, before
accepting a guilty plea, to ascertain the defendant understands he or she is giving up "the right to be tried by a jury
and at that trial . . . the right against compelled selfincrimination." Rule 11(c)(3). The transcript of the plea
colloquy in this case discloses that the District Court took
care to comply with this and the other provisions of Rule 11.
The District Court correctly instructed petitioner: "You have
the right at trial to remain silent under the Fifth Amendment, or at your option, you can take the stand and tell the
jury your side of this controversy. . . . If you plead guilty, all
of those rights are gone." App. 45.

Neither the Rule itself nor the District Court's explication
of it indicates that the defendant consents to take the stand
in the sentencing phase or to suffer adverse consequences
from declining to do so. Both the Rule and the District
Court's admonition were to the effect that by entry of the
plea petitioner would surrender the right "at trial" to invoke
the privilege. As there was to be no trial, the warning
would not have brought home to petitioner that she was also

526US2 Unit: $U45 [01-03-01 13:28:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN
324 MITCHELL v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
waiving the right to self-incrimination at sentencing. Thepurpose of Rule 11 is to inform the defendant of what she

loses by forgoing the trial, not to elicit a waiver of the privi-lege for proceedings still to follow. A waiver of a right to
trial with its attendant privileges is not a waiver of the privileges which exist beyond the confines of the trial.Of course, a court may discharge its duty of ensuring a

factual basis for a plea by "question[ing] the defendant underoath, on the record, and in the presence of counsel about the
offense to which the defendant has pleaded." Rule 11(c)(5).We do not question the authority of a district court to make
whatever inquiry it deems necessary in its sound discretion
to assure itself the defendant is not being pressured to offer
a plea for which there is no factual basis. A defendant who
withholds information by invoking the privilege against
self-incrimination at a plea colloquy runs the risk the district
court will find the factual basis inadequate. At least once
the plea has been accepted, statements or admissions made
during the preceding plea colloquy are later admissible
against the defendant, as is the plea itself. A statement admissible against a defendant, however, is not necessarily a
waiver of the privilege against self-incrimination. Rule 11
does not prevent the defendant from relying upon the privilege at sentencing.

Treating a guilty plea as a waiver of the privilege at
sentencing would be a grave encroachment on the rights of
defendants. At oral argument, we asked counsel for the
United States whether, on the facts of this case, if the Government had no reliable evidence of the amount of drugs involved, the prosecutor "could say, well, we can't prove it, but
we'd like to put her on the stand and cross-examine her and
see if we can't get her to admit it." Tr. of Oral Arg. 45.
Counsel answered: "[T]he waiver analysis that we have put
forward suggests that at least as to the facts surrounding
the conspiracy to which she admitted, the Government could
do that." Ibid. Over 90% of federal criminal defendants

Were we to accept the Government's position, prosecutors could indict without specifying the quantityof drugs involved, obtain a guilty plea, and then put the defendant on the stand at sentencing to fill in the drug quantity.The result would be to enlist the defendant as an instrument
in his or her own condemnation, undermining the long tradi-tion and vital principle that criminal proceedings rely on accusations proved by the Government, not on inquisitions con-ducted to enhance its own prosecutorial power.

Rogers v.
Richmond, 365 U. S. 534, 541 (1961) ("[O]urs is an accusator-ial and not an inquisitorial system").

We reject the position that either petitioner's guilty pleaor her statements at the plea colloquy functioned as a waiver
of her right to remain silent at sentencing.

B
The centerpiece of the Third Circuit's opinion is the ideathat the entry of the guilty plea completes the incrimination

of the defendant, thus extinguishing the privilege. Wherea sentence has yet to be imposed, however, this Court has
already rejected the proposition that " `incrimination is com-plete once guilt has been adjudicated,' " Estelle v. Smith, 451
U. S. 454, 462 (1981), and we reject it again today.The Court of Appeals cited Wigmore on Evidence for the
proposition that upon conviction " `criminality ceases; andwith criminality the privilege.' " 122 F. 3d, at 191 (citing 8
J. Wigmore, Evidence $ 2279, p. 481 (J. McNaughton rev.1961)). The passage relied upon does not support the Third
Circuit's narrow view of the privilege. The full passage isas follows: "Legal criminality consists in liability to the law's
punishment. When that liability is removed, criminalityceases; and with the criminality the privilege."

Ibid. Itcould be argued that liability for punishment continues until

526US2 Unit: $U45 [01-03-01 13:28:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN
326 MITCHELL v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
sentence has been imposed, and so does the privilege. Evenif the Court of Appeals' interpretation of the treatise were

correct, however, and it means the privilege ceases upon con-viction but before sentencing, we would respond that the
suggested rule is simply wrong. A later supplement to the
treatise, indeed, states the proper rule that, "[a]lthough thewitness has pleaded guilty to a crime charged but has not

been sentenced, his constitutional privilege remains unim-paired." J. Wigmore, Evidence $ 2279, p. 991, n. 1 (A. Best
ed. Supp. 1998).It is true, as a general rule, that where there can be no
further incrimination, there is no basis for the assertion of
the privilege. We conclude that principle applies to cases
in which the sentence has been fixed and the judgment of
conviction has become final. See, e. g., Reina v. United
States, 364 U. S. 507, 513 (1960). If no adverse consequences
can be visited upon the convicted person by reason of further
testimony, then there is no further incrimination to be
feared.

Where the sentence has not yet been imposed a defendant
may have a legitimate fear of adverse consequences from
further testimony. As the Court stated in Estelle: "Any effort by the State to compel [the defendant] to testify against
his will at the sentencing hearing clearly would contravene
the Fifth Amendment." 451 U. S., at 463. Estelle was a
capital case, but we find no reason not to apply the principle
to noncapital sentencing hearings as well. "The essence of
this basic constitutional principle is `the requirement that
the State which proposes to convict and punish an individual
produce the evidence against him by the independent labor
of its officers, not by the simple, cruel expedient of forcing it
from his own lips.' " Id., at 462 (emphasis in original) (quoting Culombe v. Connecticut, 367 U. S. 568, 581-582 (1961)).
The Government itself makes the implicit concession that the
acceptance of a guilty plea does not eliminate the possibility
of further incrimination. In its brief to the Court, the Gov526US2 Unit: $U45 [01-03-01 13:28:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN

327Cite as: 526 U. S. 314 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
ernment acknowledges that a defendant who awaits sen-tencing after having pleaded guilty may assert the privilege

against self-incrimination if called as a witness in the trial ofa codefendant, in part because of the danger of responding
"to questions that might have an adverse impact on hissentence or on his prosecution for other crimes." Brief
for United States 31.The Fifth Amendment by its terms prevents a person from
being "compelled in any criminal case to be a witness againsthimself." U. S. Const., Amdt. 5. To maintain that sentencing proceedings are not part of "any criminal case" is con-trary to the law and to common sense. As to the law, under
the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, a court must im-pose sentence before a judgment of conviction can issue.
See Rule 32(d)(1) ("A judgment of conviction must set forththe plea . . . and the sentence"); cf. Mempa v. Rhay, 389 U. S.
128, 134 (1967). As to common sense, it appears that in thiscase, as is often true in the criminal justice system, the defendant was less concerned with the proof of her guilt orinnocence than with the severity of her punishment. Petitioner faced imprisonment from one year upwards to life,depending on the circumstances of the crime. To say that
she had no right to remain silent but instead could be com-pelled to cooperate in the deprivation of her liberty would
ignore the Fifth Amendment privilege at the precise stagewhere, from her point of view, it was most important. Our
rule is applicable whether or not the sentencing hearing isdeemed a proceeding separate from the Rule 11 hearing, an
issue we need not resolve. III

The Government suggests in a footnote that even ifpetitioner retained an unwaived privilege against selfincrimination in the sentencing phase of her case, the Dis-trict Court was entitled, based on her silence, to draw an
adverse inference with regard to the amount of drugs attrib-utable to her. Brief for United States 31-32, n. 18. The

Opinion of the Court
normal rule in a criminal case is that no negative inferencefrom the defendant's failure to testify is permitted.

Griffin
v. California, 380 U. S. 609, 614 (1965). We decline to adoptan exception for the sentencing phase of a criminal case with

regard to factual determinations respecting the circumstances and details of the crime.This Court has recognized "the prevailing rule that the

Fifth Amendment does not forbid adverse inferences againstparties to civil actions when they refuse to testify in response to probative evidence offered against them," Baxterv.

Palmigiano, 425 U. S. 308, 318 (1976), at least where refusal to waive the privilege does not lead "automatically and
without more to [the] imposition of sanctions," Lefkowitz v.
Cunningham, 431 U. S. 801, 808, n. 5 (1977). In ordinary
civil cases, the party confronted with the invocation of the
privilege by the opposing side has no capacity to avoid it, say,
by offering immunity from prosecution. The rule allowing
invocation of the privilege, though at the risk of suffering an
adverse inference or even a default, accommodates the right
not to be a witness against oneself while still permitting civil
litigation to proceed. Another reason for treating civil and
criminal cases differently is that "the stakes are higher" in
criminal cases, where liberty or even life may be at stake,
and where the government's "sole interest is to convict."
Baxter, 425 U. S., at 318-319.

Baxter itself involved state prison disciplinary proceedings
which, as the Court noted, "are not criminal proceedings"
and "involve the correctional process and important state
interests other than conviction for crime." Id., at 316, 319.
Cf. Ohio Adult Parole Authority v. Woodard, 523 U. S. 272
(1998) (adverse inference permissible from silence in clemency proceeding, a nonjudicial postconviction process which
is not part of the criminal case). Unlike a prison disciplinary proceeding, a sentencing hearing is part of the criminal
case--the explicit concern of the self-incrimination privilege.
In accordance with the text of the Fifth Amendment, we

Opinion of the Court
must accord the privilege the same protection in the sentenc-ing phase of "any criminal case" as that which is due in the

trial phase of the same case, see Griffin, supra.The concerns which mandate the rule against negative inferences at a criminal trial apply with equal force at sentencing. Without question, the stakes are high: Here, the infer-ence drawn by the District Court from petitioner's silence

may have resulted in decades of added imprisonment. TheGovernment often has a motive to demand a severe sentence,
so the central purpose of the privilege--to protect a defend-ant from being the unwilling instrument of his or her own
condemnation--remains of vital importance.

Our holding today is a product of existing precedent, not
only Griffin but also by Estelle v. Smith, in which the Court
could "discern no basis to distinguish between the guilt and
penalty phases of respondent's capital murder trial so far as
the protection of the Fifth Amendment privilege is concerned." 451 U. S., at 462-463. Although Estelle was a
capital case, its reasoning applies with full force here, where
the Government seeks to use petitioner's silence to infer
commission of disputed criminal acts. See supra, at 326.
To say that an adverse factual inference may be drawn from
silence at a sentencing hearing held to determine the specifics of the crime is to confine Griffin by ignoring Estelle.
We are unwilling to truncate our precedents in this way.

The rule against adverse inferences from a defendant's
silence in criminal proceedings, including sentencing, is of
proven utility. Some years ago the Court expressed concern that "[t]oo many, even those who should be better advised, view this privilege as a shelter for wrongdoers. They
too readily assume that those who invoke it are either guilty
of crime or commit perjury in claiming the privilege." Ullmann v. United States, 350 U. S. 422, 426 (1956). Later, it
quoted with apparent approval Wigmore's observation that
" `[t]he layman's natural first suggestion would probably be
that the resort to privilege in each instance is a clear confes526US2 Unit: $U45 [01-03-01 13:28:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN

sion of crime,' " Lakeside v. Oregon, 435 U. S. 333, 340, n. 10(1978) (quoting 8 Wigmore, Evidence $ 2272, at 426). It is

far from clear that citizens, and jurors, remain today so skep-tical of the principle or are often willing to ignore the prohibition against adverse inferences from silence. Principles
once unsettled can find general and wide acceptance in thelegal culture, and there can be little doubt that the rule prohibiting an inference of guilt from a defendant's rightful si-lence has become an essential feature of our legal tradition.
This process began even before Griffin. When Griffin wasbeing considered by this Court, some 44 States did not allow
a prosecutor to invite the jury to make an adverse inference
from the defendant's refusal to testify at trial. See Griffin,
supra, at 611, n. 3. The rule against adverse inferences is a
vital instrument for teaching that the question in a criminal
case is not whether the defendant committed the acts of
which he is accused. The question is whether the Government has carried its burden to prove its allegations while
respecting the defendant's individual rights. The Government retains the burden of proving facts relevant to the
crime at the sentencing phase and cannot enlist the defendant in this process at the expense of the self-incrimination
privilege. Whether silence bears upon the determination of
a lack of remorse, or upon acceptance of responsibility for
purposes of the downward adjustment provided in $ 3E1.1
of the United States Sentencing Guidelines (1998), is a separate question. It is not before us, and we express no view
on it.

By holding petitioner's silence against her in determining the facts of the offense at the sentencing hearing, the
District Court imposed an impermissible burden on the exercise of the constitutional right against compelled selfincrimination. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Scalia, J., dissenting
Justice Scalia, with whom The Chief Justice, Justice
O'Connor, and Justice Thomas join, dissenting.

I agree with the Court that Mitchell had the right to in-voke her Fifth Amendment privilege during the sentencing

phase of her criminal case. In my view, however, she didnot have the right to have the sentencer abstain from making
the adverse inferences that reasonably flow from her failureto testify. I therefore respectfully dissent.

I
The Fifth Amendment provides that "[n]o person . . . shallbe compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against

himself." As an original matter, it would seem to me thatthe threat of an adverse inference does not "compel" anyone
to testify. It is one of the natural (and not governmentallyimposed) consequences of failing to testify--as is the factfinder's increased readiness to believe the incriminating tes-timony that the defendant chooses not to contradict. Both
of these consequences are assuredly cons rather than pros inthe "to testify or not to testify" calculus, but they do not
compel anyone to take the stand. Indeed, I imagine that inmost instances, a guilty defendant would choose to remain
silent despite the adverse inference, on the theory that itwould do him less damage than his own cross-examined
testimony.Despite the text, we held in

Griffin v. California, 380 U. S.609, 614 (1965), that it was impermissible for the prosecutor

or judge to comment on a defendant's refusal to testify. Wecalled it a "penalty" imposed on the defendant's exercise of
the privilege. Ibid. And we did not stop there, holdingin

Carter v. Kentucky, 450 U. S. 288 (1981), that a judgemust, if the defendant asks, instruct the jury that it may not

become "an essential feature of our legal tradition." Ante,at 330. Although the latter assertion strikes me as hyperbolic, the former may be true--which is adequate reason notto overrule these cases, a course I in no way propose. It is
not adequate reason, however, to extend these cases into
areas where they do not yet apply, since neither logic norhistory can be marshaled in defense of them. The illogic of

the Griffin line is plain, for it runs exactly counter to normalevidentiary inferences: If I ask my son whether he saw a
movie I had forbidden him to watch, and he remains silent,the import of his silence is clear. Indeed, we have on other
occasions recognized the significance of silence, saying that
" `[f]ailure to contest an assertion . . . is considered evidence
of acquiescence . . . if it would have been natural under the
circumstances to object to the assertion in question.' " Baxter v. Palmigiano, 425 U. S. 308, 319 (1976) (quoting United
States v. Hale, 422 U. S. 171, 176 (1975)). See also United
States ex rel. Bilokumsky v. Tod, 263 U. S. 149, 153-154
(1923) ("Conduct which forms a basis for inference is evidence. Silence is often evidence of the most persuasive
character").

And as for history, Griffin's pedigree is equally dubious.
The question whether a factfinder may draw a logical inference from a criminal defendant's failure to offer formal testimony would not have arisen in 1791, because common-law
evidentiary rules prevented a criminal defendant from testifying in his own behalf even if he wanted to do so. See
generally Ferguson v. Georgia, 365 U. S. 570 (1961). That is
not to say, however, that a criminal defendant was not allowed to speak in his own behalf, and a tradition of expecting
the defendant to do so, and of drawing an adverse inference
when he did not, strongly suggests that Griffin is out of sync
with the historical understanding of the Fifth Amendment.
Traditionally, defendants were expected to speak rather extensively at both the pretrial and trial stages of a criminal
proceeding. The longstanding common-law principle, nemo

tenetur seipsum prodere, was thought to ban only testimony
forced by compulsory oath or physical torture, not voluntary,
unsworn testimony. See T. Barlow, The Justice of Peace: A
Treatise Containing the Power and Duty of That Magistrate
189-190 (1745).

Pretrial procedure in colonial America was governed (as it
had been for centuries in England) by the Marian Committal
Statute, which provided:

"[S]uch Justices or Justice [of the peace] before whom
any person shall be brought for Manslaughter or Felony,
or for suspicion thereof, before he or they shall commit
or send such Prisoner to Ward, shall take the examination of such Prisoner, and information of those that
bring him, of the fact and circumstance thereof, and the
same or as much thereof as shall be material to prove
the Felony shall put in writing, within two days after
the said examination. . . ." 2 & 3 Philip & Mary,
ch. 10 (1555).

The justice of the peace testified at trial as to the content of
the defendant's statement; if the defendant refused to speak,
this would also have been reported to the jury. Langbein,
The Privilege and Common Law Criminal Procedure, in The
Privilege Against Self-Incrimination 82, 92 (R. Helmholz
et al. eds. 1997).

At trial, defendants were expected to speak directly to the
jury. Sir James Stephen described 17th- and 18th-century
English trials as follows:

"[T]he prisoner in cases of felony could not be defended
by counsel, and had therefore to speak for himself. He
was thus unable to say . . . that his mouth was closed.
On the contrary his mouth was not only open, but the
evidence given against him operated as so much indirect
questioning, and if he omitted to answer the questions
it suggested he was very likely to be convicted." J. Ste526US2 Unit: $U45 [01-03-01 13:28:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN

phen, 1 History of the Criminal Law of England 440(1883).

See also J. Beattie, Crime and the Courts in England: 1660-1800, pp. 348-349 (1986) ("And the assumption was clear that
if the case against him was false the prisoner ought to sayso and suggest why, and that if he did not speak that could
only be because he was unable to deny the truth of the evi-dence"); 2 W. Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown, ch. 39, $ 2 (8th
ed. 1824) (confirming that defendants were expected to speakin their own defense at trial). Though it is clear that adverse inference from silence was permitted, I have been un-able to find any case adverting to that inference in upholding
a conviction--which suggests that defendants rarely thoughtit in their interest to remain silent. See Langbein,

supra,at 95-96.

No one, however, seemed to think this system inconsistentwith the principle of

nemo tenetur seipsum prodere. Andthere is no indication whatever that criminal procedure in

America made an abrupt about-face when this principle wasratified as a fundamental right in the Fifth Amendment and
its state-constitution analogues. See Moglen, The Privilegein British North America: The Colonial Period to the Fifth
Amendment, in The Privilege Against Self-Incrimination,
supra, at 139-140. Justices of the peace continued pretrialquestioning of suspects, whose silence continued to be introduced against them at trial. See, e. g., Fourth Report of theCommissioners on Practice and Pleadings in New York--
Code of Criminal Procedure xxviii (1849); 1 Complete Worksof Edward Livingston on Criminal Jurisprudence 356 (1873).
If any objection was raised to the pretrial procedure, it wason the purely statutory ground that the Marian Committal
Statute had no force in the new Republic. See, e. g., W. Hen-ing, The Virginia Justice: Comprising the Office and Authority of a Justice of the Peace 285 (4th ed. 1825). And defend-ants continued to speak at their trials until the assistance
of counsel became more common, which occurred gradually

Scalia, J., dissenting
throughout the 19th century. See W. Beaney, The Right toCounsel in American Courts 226 (1955).

The Griffin question did not arise until States beganenacting statutes providing that criminal defendants were
competent to testify under oath on their own behalf. Maine
was first in 1864, and the rest of the States and the FederalGovernment eventually followed. See 2 J. Wigmore, Evidence $ 579 (3d ed. 1940). Although some of these statutes(including the federal statute, 18 U. S. C. $ 3481) contained a
clause cautioning that no negative inference should be drawnfrom the defendant's failure to testify, disagreement with
this approach was sufficiently widespread that, as late as
1953, the Uniform Rules of Evidence drafted by the National
Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws provided that "[i]f an accused in a criminal action does not testify, counsel may comment upon [sic] accused's failure to testify, and the trier of fact may draw all reasonable inferences
therefrom." Uniform Rule of Evidence 23(4). See also
Model Code of Evidence Rule 201(3) (1942) (similar).

Whatever the merits of prohibiting adverse inferences as
a legislative policy, see ante, at 329-330, the text and history
of the Fifth Amendment give no indication that there is a
federal constitutional prohibition on the use of the defendant's silence as demeanor evidence. Our hardy forebears,
who thought of compulsion in terms of the rack and oaths
forced by the power of law, would not have viewed the drawing of a commonsense inference as equivalent pressure.
And it is implausible that the Americans of 1791, who were
subject to adverse inferences for failing to give unsworn testimony, would have viewed an adverse inference for failing to
give sworn testimony as a violation of the Fifth Amendment.
Nor can it reasonably be argued that the new statutes somehow created a "revised" understanding of the Fifth Amendment that was incorporated into the Due Process Clause of
the Fourteenth Amendment, since only nine States (and not
the Federal Government) had enacted competency statutes

Scalia, J., dissenting
when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted, and three ofthem did not prohibit adverse inferences from failure to

testify.1The Court's decision in Griffin, however, did not even pretend to be rooted in a historical understanding of the FifthAmendment. Rather, in a breathtaking act of sorcery it
simply transformed legislative policy into constitutional com-mand, quoting a passage from an earlier opinion describing
the benevolent purposes of 18 U. S. C. $ 3481, and then de-creeing, with literally nothing to support it: "If the words
`Fifth Amendment' are substituted for `act' and for `statute,'the spirit of the Self-Incrimination Clause is reflected." 380
U. S., at 613-614. Imagine what a Constitution we wouldhave if this mode of exegesis were generally applied--if, for
example, without any evidence to prove the point, the Courtcould simply say of all federal procedural statutes: "If the
words `Fifth Amendment' are substituted for `act' and for`statute,' the spirit of the Due Process Clause is reflected."
To my mind, Griffin was a wrong turn--which is not causeenough to overrule it, but is cause enough to resist its
extension. II

The Court asserts that it will not "adopt an exception"to

Griffin for the sentencing phase of a criminal case. Ante,at 328. That characterization of what we are asked to do is

evidently demanded, in the Court's view, by the very textof the Fifth Amendment: The phrase "any criminal case"
requires us to "accord the privilege the same protectionin the sentencing phase . . . as that which is due in the trial
phase of the same case." Ante, at 329. That is demonstra-bly not so.

1 The statutes prohibiting an adverse inference were: 1866 Mass. Acts,
ch. 260; 1866 Vt. Laws No. 40; 1867 Nev. Stats., ch. XVIII; 1867 Ohio Leg.
Acts 260; 1868 Conn. Laws, ch. XCVI; 1868 Minn. Laws, ch. LXX. The
statutes not prohibiting an adverse inference were: 1864 Me. Acts, ch. 280;
1866 Cal. Stats., ch. DCXLIV; 1866 S. C. Acts No. 4780.

Scalia, J., dissenting
Our case law has long recognized a natural dichotomy be-tween the guilt and penalty phases. The jury-trial right

contained in the Sixth Amendment--whose guarantees apply"[i]n all criminal prosecutions," a term indistinguishable
for present purposes from the Fifth Amendment's "in any
criminal case"--does not apply at sentencing. Spaziano v.
Florida, 468 U. S. 447, 462-463 (1984). Nor does the Sixth
Amendment's guarantee of the defendant's right "to be con-fronted with the witnesses against him." (The sentencing

judge may consider, for example, reports of probation officersand psychiatrists without affording any cross-examination.)
See Williams v. New York, 337 U. S. 241, 252 (1949). Likewise inapplicable at sentencing is the requirement of the Due
Process Clause that the prosecution prove the essential facts
beyond a reasonable doubt. McMillan v. Pennsylvania,
477 U. S. 79, 92 (1986).

The Court asserts that refusing to apply Griffin would
"truncate" our holding in Estelle v. Smith, 451 U. S. 454
(1981), that the Fifth Amendment applies to sentencing proceedings. Id., at 462. With the contrary indications in our
case law, however, it seems to me quite impossible to read
Estelle as holding, not only that the Fifth Amendment applies to sentencing as to guilt, but also that it has precisely
the same scope in both phases. Thus the question before
us, fairly put, is not whether we will "truncate" Estelle or
create an "exception" to Griffin, but whether we will, for the
first time, extend Griffin beyond the guilt phase. For the
answer to that question, one would normally look to the historical understanding of the "no adverse inference" constitutional practice. Since, as described in Part I, there was no
such practice, history is of no help here, except to suggest
that a mistakenly created constitutional right should not be
expanded.

Consistency with other areas of our jurisprudence points
in the same direction. We have permitted adverse inferences to be drawn from silence where the consequence is a

Woodard, 523 U. S. 272, 285-286 (1998), the imposition of
punishment for violation of prison rules, see Baxter v. Palmigiano, 425 U. S., at 318-319, and even deportation, see
INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, 468 U. S. 1032, 1043-1044 (1984) (citing United States ex rel. Bilokumsky v. Tod, 263 U. S., at153-154).

2 There is no reason why the increased punishment to which the defendant is exposed in the sentencingphase of a completed criminal trial should be treated differently--unless it is the theory that the guilt and sentencingphases form one inseparable "criminal case," which I have
refuted above. Nor, I might add--despite the broad dictathat it quotes from

Estelle--does the majority really believe
that the guilt and sentencing phases are a unified whole, elseit would not leave open the possibility that the acceptanceof-responsibility Sentencing Guideline escapes the ban on
negative inferences. Ante, at 330.

Which brings me to the greatest--the most bizarre--inconsistency of all: the combination of the rule that the Court
adopts today with the balance of our jurisprudence relating
to sentencing in particular. "[C]ourts in this country and in
England," we have said, have "practiced a policy under
which a sentencing judge [can] exercise a wide discretion in
the sources and types of evidence used to assist him in de2 Even at trial, I might note, we have not held the "no adverse inference"
rule to be absolute. One year after Griffin v. California, 380 U. S. 609
(1965), we did say in Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966), that a
defendant's postarrest silence could not be introduced as substantive evidence against him at trial. Id., at 468, n. 37 (dictum). But we have also
held that the Fifth Amendment permits a defendant to be impeached with
his prearrest silence, Jenkins v. Anderson, 447 U. S. 231, 238 (1980), or
postarrest silence, Fletcher v. Weir, 455 U. S. 603 (1982) (per curiam), if
he later takes the stand during his criminal trial; we have also recognized
the vitality of our pre-Griffin rule that a testifying defendant may be
impeached with his refusal to take the stand in a prior trial. Jenkins,

termining the kind and extent of punishment to be imposed
within limits fixed by law." Williams v. New York, supra,
at 246. "[A] sentencing judge `may appropriately conduct an
inquiry broad in scope, largely unlimited either as to the kind
of information he may consider, or the source from which it
may come.' " Nichols v. United States, 511 U. S. 738, 747
(1994) (quoting United States v. Tucker, 404 U. S. 443, 446
(1972)). "Few facts available to a sentencing judge," we
have observed, "are more relevant to `the likelihood that
[a defendant] will transgress no more, the hope that he may
respond to rehabilitative efforts to assist with a lawful future
career, [and] the degree to which he does or does not deem
himself at war with his society' " than a defendant's willingness to cooperate. Roberts v. United States, 445 U. S. 552,
558 (1980). See also 18 U. S. C. $ 3661 ("No limitation shall
be placed on the information concerning the background,
character, and conduct of a person convicted of an offense
which a court of the United States may receive and consider
for the purpose of imposing an appropriate sentence"). Today's opinion states, in as inconspicuous a manner as possible
at the very end of its analysis (one imagines that if the statement were delivered orally it would be spoken in a very low
voice, and with the Court's hand over its mouth), that its
holding applies only to inferences drawn from silence "in determining the facts of the offense." Ante, at 330. "Whether
silence bears upon the determination of a lack of remorse, or
upon acceptance of responsibility for purposes of the downward adjustment provided in $ 3E1.1 of the United States
Sentencing Guidelines (1998), is a separate question" on
which the majority expresses no view. Ibid. Never mind
that we have said before, albeit in dicta, that "[w]e doubt
that a principled distinction may be drawn between `enhancing' the punishment imposed upon the petitioner and denying him the `leniency' he claims would be appropriate if he
had cooperated." Roberts, supra, at 557, n. 4.

340 MITCHELL v. UNITED STATES

Scalia, J., dissenting
Of course the clutter swept under the rug by limiting the
opinion to "determining facts of the offense" is not merely
application of today's opinion to $ 3E1.1, but its application
to all determinations of acceptance of responsibility, repentance, character, and future dangerousness, in both federal
and state prosecutions--that is to say, to what is probably
the bulk of what most sentencing is all about. If the Court
ultimately decides--in the fullness of time and after a decent
period of confusion in the lower courts--that the "no inference" rule is indeed limited to "determining facts of the
offense," then we will have a system in which a state court
can increase the sentence of a convicted drug possessor who
refuses to say how many ounces he possessed--not because
that suggests he possessed the larger amount (to make such
an inference would be unconstitutional!) but because his refusal to cooperate suggests he is unrepentant. Apart from
the fact that there is no logical basis for drawing such a line
within the sentencing phase (whereas drawing a line between guilt and sentencing is entirely logical), the result
produced provides new support for Mr. Bumble's renowned
evaluation of the law. Its only sensible feature is that it will
almost always be unenforceable, since it will ordinarily be
impossible to tell whether the sentencer has used the silence
for either purpose or for neither.

If, on the other hand, the Court ultimately decides--in the
fullness of time and after a decent period of confusion in the
lower courts--that the extension of Griffin announced today
is not limited to "determining facts of the offense," then it
will have created a system in which we give the sentencing
judge access to all sorts of out-of-court evidence, including
the most remote hearsay, concerning the character of the
defendant, his prior misdeeds, his acceptance of responsibility and determination to mend his ways, but declare taboo

front of the judge: the defendant's refusal to cooperate with

the court. Such a rule orders the judge to avert his eyesfrom the elephant in the courtroom when it is the judge's job

to size up the elephant.The patent inadequacy of both of these courses with regard
to determining matters other than the "facts of the offense"is not finessed by simply resolving, for the time being, not to
choose between them. Sooner or later the choice must bemade, and the fact that both alternatives are unsatisfactory
cries out that the Court's extension of Griffin is a mistake.The Court asserts that the rule against adverse inferences
from silence, even in sentencing proceedings, "is of provenutility."

Ante, at 329. Significantly, however, the only util-ity it proceeds to describe--that it is a "vital instrument" for

teaching jurors that "the question in a criminal case is notwhether the defendant committed the acts of which he is
accused," but rather "whether the Government has carriedits burden to prove its allegations"--is a utility that has no
bearing upon sentencing, or indeed even upon the usual sen-tenc

er, which is a judge rather than a jury. Ante, at 330.

* * *
Though the Fifth Amendment protects Mitchell frombeing compelled to take the stand, and also protects her, as

we have held, from adverse inferences drawn from her si-lence at the guilt phase of the trial, there is no reason why
it must also shield her from the natural and appropriate con-sequences of her uncooperativeness at the sentencing stage.
I respectfully dissent.

Justice Thomas, dissenting.
Justice Scalia's dissenting opinion persuasively demon-strates that this Court's decision in Griffin v. California, 380

U. S. 609 (1965), lacks foundation in the Constitution's text,history, or logic. The vacuousness of

Griffin supplies "causeenough to resist its extension." Ante, at 336. And, in my

view, it also illustrates that Griffin and its progeny, in526US2 Unit: $U45 [01-03-01 13:28:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN
342 MITCHELL v. UNITED STATES

Thomas, J., dissenting
cluding Carter v. Kentucky, 450 U. S. 288 (1981), should bereexamined.

As Justice Scalia notes, the "illogic of the Griffin lineis plain" and its historical "pedigree is equally dubious."
Ante, at 332 (emphasis added). Not only does Griffin fail to
withstand a proper constitutional analysis, it rests on an un-sound assumption.

Griffin relied partly on the premise that
comments about a defendant's silence (and the inferencesdrawn therefrom) penalized the exercise of his Fifth Amendment privilege. See Griffin, supra, at 614; Carter, supra, at301. As the dissenting Justices in

Griffin rightly observed,
such comments or inferences do not truly "penalize" a defendant. See 380 U. S., at 620-621 (opinion of Stewart, J.,
joined by White, J.) ("Exactly what the penalty imposed consists of is not clear"); id., at 621 ("[T]he Court must be saying
that the California constitutional provision places some other
compulsion upon the defendant to incriminate himself, some
compulsion which the Court does not describe and which I
cannot readily perceive"). Prosecutorial comments on a defendant's decision to remain silent at trial surely impose no
greater "penalty" on a defendant than threats to indict him
on more serious charges if he chooses not to enter into a plea
bargain--a practice that this Court previously has validated.
See, e. g., Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U. S. 357, 365 (1978)
(finding no due process violation where plea negotiations
"presented the defendant with the unpleasant alternatives of
forgoing trial or facing charges on which he was plainly subject to prosecution"). Moreover, this so-called "penalty"
lacks any constitutional significance, since the explicit constitutional guarantee has been fully honored--a defendant is
not "compelled . . . to be a witness against himself," U. S.
Const., Amdt. 5, merely because the jury has been told that
it may draw an adverse inference from his failure to testify.
See Griffin, supra, at 621 (Stewart, J., joined by White, J.,
dissenting) ("[C]omment by counsel and the court does not
compel testimony by creating such an awareness" of a de526US2 Unit: $U45 [01-03-01 13:28:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN

fendant's decision not to testify); Carter, supra, at 306 (Pow-ell, J., concurring) ("But nothing in the [Self-Incrimination]

Clause requires that jurors not draw logical inferences whena defendant chooses not to explain incriminating circumstances").* Therefore, at bottom, Griffin constitutionalizesa policy choice that a majority of the Court found desirable
at the time. Carter compounded the error. This sort of un-dertaking is not an exercise in constitutional interpretation
but an act of judicial willfulness that has no logical stoppingpoint. See

Carter, supra, at 310 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting)("Such Thomistic reasoning is now carried from the constitutional provision itself, to the Griffin case, to the present case,and where it will stop no one can know").

We have previously recognized that stare decisis is "at itsweakest when we interpret the Constitution because our
interpretation can be altered only by constitutional amend-ment or by overruling our prior decisions."

Agostini v. Fel-ton, 521 U. S. 203, 235 (1997). Given their indefensible foundations, I would be willing to reconsider Griffin and Carterin the appropriate case. For purposes of this case, which
asks only whether the principle established in Griffin shouldbe extended, I agree that the Fifth Amendment does not
prohibit a sentencer from drawing an adverse inference froma defendant's failure to testify and, therefore, join

Justice
Scalia's dissent.

*I also agree with Justice Scalia, ante, at 336, that Griffin improperly
relied on a prior decision interpreting a federal statute to inform its resolution of a constitutional question--an error the Court later repeated in
Carter. See Griffin v. California, 380 U. S. 609, 613-614 (1965); Carter v.
Kentucky, 450 U. S. 288, 300-301, n. 16 (1981).

MURPHY BROTHERS, INC. v. MICHETTI PIPESTRINGING, INC.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eleventh circuit

No. 97-1909. Argued March 1, 1999--Decided April 5, 1999
On January 26, 1996, respondent Michetti Pipe Stringing, Inc. (Michetti),

filed a complaint in Alabama state court seeking damages for an alleged
breach of contract and fraud by petitioner Murphy Bros., Inc. (Murphy).
Michetti did not serve Murphy then, but three days later it faxed a
"courtesy copy" of the file-stamped complaint to a Murphy vice president. Michetti officially served Murphy under local law by certified
mail on February 12, 1996. On March 13, 1996 (30 days after service
but 44 days after receiving the faxed copy of the complaint), Murphy
removed the case under 28 U. S. C. $ 1441 to the Federal District Court.
Michetti moved to remand the case to the state court on the ground that
Murphy filed the removal notice 14 days too late under $ 1446(b), which
specifies, in relevant part, that the notice "shall be filed within thirty
days after the receipt by the defendant, through service or otherwise,
of a copy of the [complaint]." (Emphasis added.) Because the notice
had not been filed within 30 days of the date on which Murphy's vice
president received the facsimile transmission, Michetti asserted, the removal was untimely. The District Court denied the remand motion on
the ground that the 30-day removal period did not commence until Murphy was officially served with a summons. On interlocutory appeal, the
Eleventh Circuit reversed and remanded, instructing the District Court
to remand the action to state court. Emphasizing the statutory words
"receipt . . . or otherwise," the Eleventh Circuit held that the defendant's receipt of a faxed copy of the filed initial pleading sufficed to commence the 30-day removal period.

Held: A named defendant's time to remove is triggered by simultaneous

service of the summons and complaint, or receipt of the complaint,
"through service or otherwise," after and apart from service of the summons, but not by mere receipt of the complaint unattended by any formal service. Pp. 350-356.

(a) Service of process, under longstanding tradition in our system
of justice, is fundamental to any procedural imposition on a named defendant. In the absence of such service (or waiver of service by the defendant), a court ordinarily may not exercise power over a party the

Civ. Proc. 4(a) and 12(a)(1)(A). Unless a named defendant agrees to
waive service, the summons continues to function as the sine qua non
directing an individual or entity to participate in a civil action or forgo
procedural or substantive rights. Pp. 350-351.

(b) In enacting $ 1446(b), Congress did not endeavor to break away
from the traditional understanding. Prior to 1948, a defendant could
remove a case any time before the expiration of the time to respond to
the complaint under state law. Because that time limit varied from
State to State, however, the removal period correspondingly varied.
To reduce the disparity, Congress in 1948 enacted the original version
of $ 1446(b), which required that the removal petition in a civil action be
filed within 20 days after commencement of the action or service of
process, whichever was later. However, as first framed, $ 1446(b) did
not give adequate time or operate uniformly in States such as New
York, where service of the summons commenced the action and could
precede the filing of the complaint, so that the removal period could
have expired before the defendant obtained access to the complaint. To
ensure such access before commencement of the removal period, Congress in 1949 enacted the current version of $ 1446(b). Nothing in the
1949 amendment's legislative history so much as hints that Congress,
in making changes to accommodate atypical state commencement and
complaint filing procedures, intended to dispense with the historic function of service of process as the official trigger for responsive action by
a named defendant. Pp. 351-353.

(c) Relying on the "plain meaning" of $ 1446(b) that the panel perceived, the Eleventh Circuit was of the view that "[receipt] through
service or otherwise" opens a universe of means besides service for putting the defendant in possession of the complaint. However, the Eleventh Circuit did not delineate the dimensions of that universe. Nor can
one tenably maintain that the words "or otherwise" provide a clue. Cf.,
e. g., Potter v. McCauley, 186 F. Supp. 146, 149. The interpretation of

$ 1446(b) adopted here adheres to tradition, makes sense of the phrase
"or otherwise," and assures defendants adequate time to decide whether
to remove an action to federal court. The various state provisions for
service of the summons and the filing or service of the complaint fit into
one or another of four main categories. See ibid. In each of those
categories, the defendant's removal period will be no less than 30 days

Syllabus

from service, and in some of the categories, it will be more than 30 days
from service, depending on when the complaint is received. First, if
the summons and complaint are served together, the 30-day removal
period runs at once. Second, if the defendant is served with the summons but is furnished with the complaint sometime after, the removal
period runs from the receipt of the complaint. Third, if the defendant
is served with the summons and the complaint is filed in court, but under
local rules, service of the complaint is not required, the removal period
runs from the date the complaint is made available through filing. Finally, if the complaint is filed in court prior to any service, the removal
period runs from the service of the summons. See ibid. Notably, Rule
81(c), amended in 1949, uses the identical "receipt through service or
otherwise" language in specifying the 20-day period in which the defendant must answer the complaint once the case has been removed.
Rule 81(c) has been interpreted to afford the defendant at least 20 days
after service of process to respond. See Silva v. Madison, 69 F. 3d
1368, 1376-1377. In Silva, the Seventh Circuit distinguished its earlier
decision in Roe v. O'Donohue, 38 F. 3d 298 (defendant need not receive
service before time for removal under $ 1446(b) begins to run), but did
not adequately explain why one who has not yet lawfully been made a
party to an action should be required to decide in which court system
the case should be heard. If, as the Silva court rightly determined, the
"service or otherwise" language was not intended to abrogate the service requirement for purposes of Rule 81(c), that same language also was
not intended to bypass service as a starter for $ 1446(b)'s clock. The
fact that the Seventh Circuit could read the phrase "or otherwise" differently in Silva and Roe, moreover, undercuts the Eleventh Circuit's
position that the phrase has an inevitably "plain meaning." Furthermore, the so-called "receipt rule"--starting the time to remove on receipt of a copy of the complaint, however informally, despite the absence
of any formal service--could operate with notable unfairness to defendants in foreign nations. Because facsimile machines transmit instantaneously, but formal service abroad may take much longer than 30 days,
plaintiffs would be able to dodge international treaty requirements
and trap foreign opponents into keeping their suits in state courts.
Pp. 353-356.

(d) In sum, it would take a clearer statement than Congress has made
to read its endeavor to extend removal time (by adding receipt of the
complaint) to effect so strange a change--to set removal apart from all
other responsive acts, to render removal the sole instance in which one's
procedural rights slip away before service of a summons, i. e., before
one is subject to any court's authority. P. 356.

Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case concerns the time within which a defendantnamed in a state-court action may remove the action to

a federal court. The governing provision is 28 U. S. C.$ 1446(b), which specifies, in relevant part, that the removal
notice "shall be filed within thirty days after the receipt bythe defendant, through service or otherwise, of a copy of the
[complaint]." The question presented is whether the nameddefendant must be officially summoned to appear in the action before the time to remove begins to run. Or, may the30-day period start earlier, on the named defendant's receipt,
before service of official process, of a "courtesy copy" of thefiled complaint faxed by counsel for the plaintiff?

We read Congress' provisions for removal in light of a bed-rock principle: An individual or entity named as a defendant
is not obliged to engage in litigation unless notified of theaction, and brought under a court's authority, by formal process. Accordingly, we hold that a named defendant's time to

On January 26, 1996, respondent Michetti Pipe Stringing,Inc. (Michetti), filed a complaint in Alabama state court seeking damages for an alleged breach of contract and fraud bypetitioner Murphy Bros., Inc. (Murphy). Michetti did not
serve Murphy at that time, but three days later it faxed a"courtesy copy" of the file-stamped complaint to one of Murphy's vice presidents. The parties then engaged in settle-ment discussions until February 12, 1996, when Michetti officially served Murphy under local law by certified mail.On March 13, 1996 (30 days after service but 44 days after
receiving the faxed copy of the complaint), Murphy removedthe case under 28 U. S. C. $ 1441 to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama.1 Michettimoved to remand the case to the state court on the ground
that Murphy filed the removal notice 14 days too late. Thenotice of removal had not been filed within 30 days of the
date on which Murphy's vice president received the facsimiletransmission. Consequently, Michetti asserted, the removal
was untimely under 28 U. S. C. $ 1446(b), which provides:

"The notice of removal of a civil action or proceedingshall be filed within thirty days after the receipt by the

defendant, through service or otherwise, of a copy of theinitial pleading setting forth the claim for relief upon

whichever period is shorter." (Emphasis added.)
The District Court denied the remand motion on the groundthat the 30-day removal period did not commence until Murphy was officially served with a summons. The court ob-served that the phrase "or otherwise" was added to $ 1446(b)
in 1949 to govern removal in States where an action is com-menced merely by the service of a summons, without any
requirement that the complaint be served or even filed con-temporaneously. See App. A-24. Accordingly, the District
Court said, the phrase had "no field of operation" in Statessuch as Alabama, where the complaint must be served along
with the summons. See ibid.On interlocutory appeal permitted pursuant to 28 U. S. C.

$ 1292(b), the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit re-versed and remanded, instructing the District Court to remand the action to state court. 125 F. 3d 1396, 1399 (1997).The Eleventh Circuit held that "the clock starts to tick upon
the defendant's receipt of a copy of the filed initial pleading."
Id., at 1397. "By and large," the appellate court wrote, "ouranalysis begins and ends with" the words "receipt . . . or

otherwise." Id., at 1397-1398 (emphasis deleted). Becauselower courts have divided on the question whether service
of process is a prerequisite for the running of the 30-dayremoval period under $ 1446(b),

STRINGING, INC.

Opinion of the Court

II
Service of process, under longstanding tradition in our sys-tem of justice, is fundamental to any procedural imposition

on a named defendant. At common law, the writ of capias
ad respondendum directed the sheriff to secure the de-fendant's appearance by taking him into custody. See 1 J.

Moore, Moore's Federal Practice || 0.6[2.-2], p. 212 (2d ed.1996) ("[T]he three royal courts, Exchequer, Common Pleas,
and King's Bench . . . obtained an in personam jurisdictionover the defendant in the same manner through the writ of
capias ad respondendum."). The requirement that a de-fendant be brought into litigation by official service is the
contemporary counterpart to that writ. See International
Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U. S. 310, 316 (1945) ("[T]hecapias ad respondendum has given way to personal service

of summons or other form of notice.").In the absence of service of process (or waiver of service
by the defendant), a court ordinarily may not exercise powerover a party the complaint names as defendant. See

OmniCapital Int'l, Ltd. v. Rudolf Wolff & Co., 484 U. S. 97, 104

(1987) ("Before a . . . court may exercise personal jurisdictionover a defendant, the procedural requirement of service of
summons must be satisfied."); Mississippi Publishing Corp.v.

Murphree, 326 U. S. 438, 444-445 (1946) ("[S]ervice of sum-mons is the procedure by which a court . . . asserts jurisdiction over the person of the party served."). Accordingly,one becomes a party officially, and is required to take action
in that capacity, only upon service of a summons or otherauthority-asserting measure stating the time within which
the party served must appear and defend. See Fed. Rule
Civ. Proc. 4(a) ("[The summons] shall . . . state the timewithin which the defendant must appear and defend, and notify the defendant that failure to do so will result in a judg-ment by default against the defendant."); Rule 12(a)(1)(A) (a

served with the summons and complaint). Unless a nameddefendant agrees to waive service, the summons continues

to function as the sine qua non directing an individual orentity to participate in a civil action or forgo procedural or
substantive rights. III

When Congress enacted $ 1446(b), the legislators did notendeavor to break away from the traditional understanding.
Prior to 1948, a defendant could remove a case any time be-fore the expiration of her time to respond to the complaint
under state law. See, e. g., 28 U. S. C. $ 72 (1940 ed.). Be-cause the time limits for responding to the complaint varied
from State to State, however, the period for removal corre-spondingly varied. To reduce the disparity, Congress in
1948 enacted the original version of $ 1446(b), which providedthat "[t]he petition for removal of a civil action or proceeding
may be filed within twenty days after commencement ofthe action or service of process, whichever is later." Act of
June 25, 1948, 62 Stat. 939, as amended, 28 U. S. C. $ 1446(b).According to the relevant House Report, this provision was
intended to "give adequate time and operate uniformlythroughout the Federal jurisdiction." H. R. Rep. No. 308,
80th Cong., 1st Sess., A135 (1947).Congress soon recognized, however, that $ 1446(b), as first
framed, did not "give adequate time and operate uniformly"in all States. In States such as New York, most notably,
service of the summons commenced the action, and such
service could precede the filing of the complaint. Under$ 1446(b) as originally enacted, the period for removal in such

a State could have expired before the defendant obtained
access to the complaint.To ensure that the defendant would have access to the

complaint before commencement of the removal period, Con-gress in 1949 enacted the current version of $ 1446(b): "The
petition for removal of a civil action or proceeding shall be

filed within twenty days [now thirty days] 3 after the receiptby the defendant, through service or otherwise, of a copy of

the initial pleading setting forth the claim for relief uponwhich such action or proceeding is based." Act of May 24,
1949, $ 83(a), 63 Stat. 101. The accompanying Senate Re-port explained:

"In some States suits are begun by the service of a sum-mons or other process without the necessity of filing any
pleading until later. As the section now stands, thisplaces the defendant in the position of having to take
steps to remove a suit to Federal court before he knowswhat the suit is about. As said section is herein proposed to be rewritten, a defendant is not required to filehis petition for removal until 20 days after he has received (or it has been made available to him) a copy ofthe initial pleading filed by the plaintiff setting forth the
claim upon which the suit is based and the relief prayedfor. It is believed that this will meet the varying conditions of practice in all the States." S. Rep. No. 303, 81stCong., 1st Sess., 6 (1949).

See also H. R. Rep. No. 352, 81st Cong., 1st Sess., 14 (1949)("The first paragraph of the amendment to subsection (b)

shorter," $ 83(b), 63 Stat. 101, was added to address the situation in States
such as Kentucky, which required the complaint to be filed at the time the

the summons. See H. R. Rep. No. 352, 81st Cong., 1st Sess., 14 (1949)

IV
The Eleventh Circuit relied on the "plain meaning" of$ 1446(b) that the panel perceived. See 125 F. 3d, at 1398.

In the Eleventh Circuit's view, because the term " `[r]eceipt'is the nominal form of `receive,' which means broadly `to
come into possession of ' or to `acquire,' " the phrase " `[re-ceipt] through service or otherwise' opens a universe of
means besides service for putting the defendant in pos-session of the complaint." Ibid. What are the dimensions
of that "universe"? The Eleventh Circuit's opinion is unin-formative. Nor can one tenably maintain that the words
"or otherwise" provide a clue. Cf. Potter v. McCauley,186 F. Supp. 146, 149 (Md. 1960) ("It is not possible to state
definitely in general terms the precise scope and effectof the word `otherwise' in its context here because its proper
application in particular situations will vary with state pro-cedural requirements.");

Apache Nitrogen Products, Inc. v.

("Th[e first clause of revised $ 1446(b)], however, without more, would
create further difficulty in those States, such as Kentucky, where suit is
commenced by the filing of the plaintiff's initial pleading and the issuance and service of a summons without any requirement that a copy of
the pleading be served upon or otherwise furnished to the defendant. Accordingly . . . the amendment provides that in such cases the petition for
removal shall be filed within 20 days after the service of the summons.").

5 It is evident, too, that Congress could not have foreseen the situation

posed by this case, for, as the District Court recognized, "[i]n 1949 Congress did not anticipate use of facsmile [sic] transmissions." App. A-23,
n. 1. Indeed, even the photocopy machine was not yet on the scene
at that time. See 9 New Encyclopaedia Britannica 400 (15th ed. 1985)
(noting that photocopiers "did not become available for commercial use
until 1950").

Opinion of the Court

Harbor Ins. Co., 145 F. R. D. 674, 679 (Ariz. 1993) ("[I]fin fact the words `service or otherwise' had a plain meaning,

the cases would not be so hopelessly split over their properinterpretation.").

The interpretation of $ 1446(b) adopted here adheres totradition, makes sense of the phrase "or otherwise," and assures defendants adequate time to decide whether to removean action to federal court. As the court in

Potter observed,the various state provisions for service of the summons and

the filing or service of the complaint fit into one or anotherof four main categories. See 186 F. Supp., at 149. In each
of the four categories, the defendant's period for removal willbe no less than 30 days from service, and in some categories,
it will be more than 30 days from service, depending on whenthe complaint is received.

As summarized in Potter, the possibilities are as follows.First, if the summons and complaint are served together, the
30-day period for removal runs at once. Second, if the de-fendant is served with the summons but the complaint is
furnished to the defendant sometime after, the period forremoval runs from the defendant's receipt of the complaint.
Third, if the defendant is served with the summons and thecomplaint is filed in court, but under local rules, service of
the complaint is not required, the removal period runs fromthe date the complaint is made available through filing. Finally, if the complaint is filed in court prior to any service,
the removal period runs from the service of the summons.See

ibid.
Notably, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 81(c), amendedin 1949, uses the identical "receipt through service or otherwise" language in specifying the time the defendant has toanswer the complaint once the case has been removed:

"In a removed action in which the defendant has notanswered, the defendant shall answer or present the
other defenses or objections available under these rules

Opinion of the Court
within 20 days after the receipt through service or oth-erwise of a copy of the initial pleading setting forth the

claim for relief upon which the action or proceeding isbased."

Rule 81(c) sensibly has been interpreted to afford the defend-ant at least 20 days after service of process to respond. See
Silva v. Madison, 69 F. 3d 1368, 1376-1377 (CA7 1995). InSilva, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals observed that
"nothing . . . would justify our concluding that the drafters,in their quest for evenhandedness and promptness in the removal process, intended to abrogate the necessity for some-thing as fundamental as service of process."

Id., at 1376.In reaching this conclusion, the court distinguished an earlier decision, Roe v. O'Donohue, 38 F. 3d 298 (CA7 1994),which held that a defendant need not receive service of process before his time for removal under $ 1446(b) begins to run.See 69 F. 3d, at 1376. But, as the United States maintains in
its amicus curiae brief, the Silva court "did not adequatelyexplain why one who has not yet lawfully been made a party
to an action should be required to decide in which court sys-tem the case should be heard." Brief for United States as
Amicus Curiae 13, n. 4. If, as the Seventh Circuit rightlydetermined, the "service or otherwise" language was not intended to abrogate the service requirement for purposes ofRule 81(c), that same language also was not intended to bypass service as a starter for $ 1446(b)'s clock. The fact thatthe Seventh Circuit could read the phrase "or otherwise"
differently in Silva and Roe, moreover, undercuts the Elev-enth Circuit's position that the phrase has an inevitably
"plain meaning." 6

6 Contrary to a suggestion made at oral argument, see Tr. of Oral Arg.
6-7, 28 U. S. C. $ 1448 does not support the Eleventh Circuit's position.

defendants has not been served with process or in which the service has

Furthermore, the so-called "receipt rule"--starting thetime to remove on receipt of a copy of the complaint, however informally, despite the absence of any formal service--could, as the District Court recognized, operate with notable
unfairness to individuals and entities in foreign nations.See App. A-24. Because facsimile machines transmit instantaneously, but formal service abroad may take muchlonger than 30 days,

In sum, it would take a clearer statement than Congresshas made to read its endeavor to extend removal time (by

adding receipt of the complaint) to effect so strange achange--to set removal apart from all other responsive acts,
to render removal the sole instance in which one's proceduralrights slip away before service of a summons,

i. e., beforeone is subject to any court's authority. Accordingly, for the

reasons stated in this opinion, the judgment of the UnitedStates Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit is reversed,

It is so ordered.
not been perfected prior to removal . . . such process or service may be
completed or new process issued in the same manner as in cases originally
filed in such district court." Nothing in $ 1448 requires the defendant to
take any action. The statute simply allows the plaintiff to serve an unserved defendant or to perfect flawed service once the action has been
removed. In fact, the second paragraph of $ 1448, which provides that
"[t]his section shall not deprive any defendant upon whom process is
served after removal of his right to move to remand the case," explicitly
reserves the unserved defendant's right to take action (move to remand)
after service is perfected.

individuals in a foreign country).

to superimpose a judicially created service of process re-quirement onto $ 1446(b). In so doing, it departs from this
Court's practice of strictly construing removal and similarjurisdictional statutes. See

the admitted facts of this case, plaintiff-respondent Ward, a MAC employee, became permanently disabled on May 5, 1992. In late February
or early March 1993, he qualified for state disability benefits in California, where he worked, and thereupon informed MAC of his disability.
In April 1994, Ward asked MAC whether its long-term disability plan
covered his condition. When MAC told him it did, Ward completed a
benefits application and sent it to MAC, which processed the application
and forwarded it to UNUM. UNUM received proof of Ward's claim on
April 11, 1994. Because this notice was late under the policy terms,
UNUM advised Ward that his claim was denied as untimely. Ward
filed this suit under ERISA's civil enforcement provision, 29 U. S. C.

$ 1132(a), to recover the disability benefits provided by the plan. He
argued that, because a California employer administering an insured
group health plan should be deemed to act as the insurance company's
agent under Elfstrom v. New York Life Ins. Co., 67 Cal. 2d 503, 512, 432
P. 2d 731, 737, his notice of permanent disability to MAC, in February
or March 1993, sufficed to supply timely notice to UNUM. The District
Court rejected this argument, concluding that California's Elfstrom
rule is subject to ERISA's preemption clause, $ 1144(a), which states
that ERISA provisions "shall supersede . . . State laws" to the extent
that those laws "relate to any employee benefit plan." In rendering
summary judgment for UNUM, the District Court further held that
the Elfstrom rule is not preserved under ERISA's saving clause,

$ 1144(b)(2)(A), which exempts from preemption "any law of any State
which regulates insurance." The Ninth Circuit reversed, identifying
two grounds on which Ward might prevail. First, that court relied on
California's "notice-prejudice" rule, under which an insurer cannot avoid
liability although the proof of claim is untimely, unless the insurer shows
it suffered actual prejudice from the delay. Following its precedent,

Syllabus
the appeals court held that the notice-prejudice rule is saved from
ERISA preemption as a law that "regulates insurance." Second, and
contingently, the Ninth Circuit held that the Elfstrom agency rule does
not "relate to" employee benefit plans, and therefore is not preempted
by reason of ERISA. The court remanded the case for a determination
whether UNUM suffered actual prejudice from Ward's late notice of
claim; and if so, whether, under Elfstrom, Ward could prevail because
he had timely filed his claim.

Held:

1. California's notice-prejudice rule is a "law . . . which regulates insurance," and is therefore saved from preemption by ERISA.
Pp. 366-375.

(a) Because the parties agree that the notice-prejudice rule falls
under ERISA's preemption clause as a state law that "relate[s] to" employee benefit plans, their dispute hinges on whether the rule "regulates
insurance" and thus escapes preemption under the saving clause. This
Court's precedent provides a framework for resolving that question.
First, the Court asks whether, from a "common-sense view of the matter," the contested prescription regulates insurance. E. g., Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts, 471 U. S. 724, 740. Second, the
Court considers three factors to determine whether the regulation fits
within the "business of insurance" as that phrase is used in the
McCarran-Ferguson Act: whether the regulation (1) has the effect of
transferring or spreading a policyholder's risk, (2) is an integral part
of the policy relationship between the insurer and the insured, and
(3) is limited to entities within the insurance industry. Id., at 743.
Pp. 366-368.

(b) The Ninth Circuit correctly concluded that the notice-prejudice
rule "regulates insurance" as a matter of common sense. This Court
does not normally disturb an appeals court's judgment on an issue so
heavily dependent on analysis of state law, see Runyon v. McCrary, 427
U. S. 160, 181-182, and there is no cause to do so here. Because it controls the terms of the insurance relationship by requiring the insurer to
prove prejudice before enforcing proof-of-claim requirements, the California rule, by its very terms, is directed specifically at the insurance
industry and is applicable only to insurance contracts. The rule thus
appears to satisfy the common-sense view as a regulation that homes in
on the insurance industry and does not just have an impact on that
industry. Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, 481 U. S. 41, 50. The Court
rejects UNUM's argument that the rule cannot be held to "regulate
insurance" because it is merely an industry-specific application of the
general principle that disproportionate forfeiture should be avoided in

526US2 Unit: $U47 [12-11-00 18:40:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN
360 UNUM LIFE INS. CO. OF AMERICA v. WARD

Syllabus
the enforcement of contracts. While the notice-prejudice rule is an application of the maxim that law abhors a forfeiture, it is an application
of a special order, a rule mandatory for insurance contracts, not a principle a court may pliably employ when the circumstances so warrant.
Tellingly, UNUM has identified no California authority outside the
insurance-specific notice-prejudice context indicating that, as a matter
of law, failure to abide by a contractual time condition does not work a
forfeiture absent prejudice. Outside the notice-prejudice context, the
burden of justifying a departure from a contract's written terms generally rests with the party seeking the departure. Moreover, California
and other States have adopted the notice-prejudice rule to address policy concerns specific to the insurance industry. Pp. 368-373.

(c) The notice-prejudice rule regulates the "business of insurance"
within the meaning of the McCarran-Ferguson Act. Preliminarily, the
Court rejects UNUM's assertion that a state regulation must satisfy
all three McCarran-Ferguson factors in order to "regulate insurance."
Those factors are considerations to be weighed, Pilot Life, 481 U. S., at
49, and none is necessarily determinative in itself, Union Labor Life
Ins. Co. v. Pireno, 458 U. S. 119, 129. The Metropolitan Life Court
called the factors "relevant," 471 U. S., at 743, and looked to them as
checking points, not separate essential elements that must each be satisfied. The Court need not determine whether the rule at issue satisfies
the first, "risk-spreading," McCarran-Ferguson factor, because the remaining factors, verifying the common-sense view, are securely satisfied. Meeting the second factor, the notice-prejudice rule serves as an
integral part of the insurance relationship because it changes the bargain between insurer and insured; it effectively creates a mandatory
contract term that requires the insurer to prove prejudice before enforcing a timeliness-of-claim provision. The third factor--whether the rule
is limited to insurance entities--is also well met, since it is aimed at the
insurance industry and does not merely have an impact upon it. See
FMC Corp. v. Holliday, 498 U. S. 52, 61. Pp. 373-375.

2. The Court rejects UNUM's assertion that the notice-prejudice rule
conflicts in three ways with substantive provisions of ERISA. First,
UNUM's contention that the rule, by altering the notice provisions of
the insurance contract, conflicts with ERISA's requirement that plan
fiduciaries act "in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan," $ 1104(a)(1)(D), overlooks controlling precedent and
makes scant sense. This Court has repeatedly held that state laws
mandating insurance contract terms are saved from preemption under

$ 1144(b)(2)(A). See, e. g., Metropolitan Life, 471 U. S., at 758. Under
UNUM's interpretation, however, States would be powerless to alter

526US2 Unit: $U47 [12-11-00 18:40:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN

361Cite as: 526 U. S. 358 (1999)
Syllabus
the terms of the insurance relationship in ERISA plans; insurers could
displace any state regulation simply by inserting a contrary term in
plan documents. This interpretation would virtually read the saving
clause out of ERISA. Second, whatever the merits of UNUM's view
that $ 1132(a) preempts any action for plan benefits brought under state
rules such as notice-prejudice, the issue is not implicated here. Because Ward sued under $ 1132(a)(1)(B) "to recover benefits due . . . under
the terms of his plan," invoking the notice-prejudice rule as the relevant
rule of decision for his $ 1132(a) suit, the case does not raise the question
whether $ 1132(a) provides the sole launching ground for an ERISA enforcement action. Finally, the Court rejects UNUM's suggestion that
the notice-prejudice rule conflicts with $ 1133, which requires plans to
provide notice and the opportunity for review of denied claims, or with
Department of Labor regulations providing that a claim is filed when
the requirements of a reasonable claim filing procedure have been met.
By allowing a longer period to file than the minimum filing terms mandated by federal law, the notice-prejudice rule complements rather than
contradicts ERISA and the regulations. Pp. 375-377.

3. California's Elfstrom agency rule "relate[s] to" ERISA plans, and
therefore does not occupy ground outside ERISA's preemption clause.
Contrary to the Ninth Circuit's view that Elfstrom is consistent with
this Court's ERISA preemption precedent because it does not dictate
the manner in which the plan will be administered, deeming the
policyholder-employer the agent of the insurer would have a marked
effect on plan administration: It would force the employer, as plan
administrator, to assume a role, with attendant legal duties and consequences, that it has not undertaken voluntarily; and it would affect
not merely the plan's bookkeeping obligations regarding to whom benefits checks must be sent, but would also regulate the basic services
that a plan may or must provide to its participants and beneficiaries.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case, brought under $ 502(a) of the Employee Retire-ment Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 88 Stat. 891, as

amended, 29 U. S. C. $ 1132(a), concerns ERISA's preemptionand saving clauses. The preemption clause, $ 514(a), 29
U. S. C. $ 1144(a), broadly states that ERISA provisions"shall supersede . . . State laws" to the extent that those laws
"relate to any employee benefit plan." The saving clause,$ 514(b)(2)(A), 29 U. S. C. $ 1144(b)(2)(A), phrased with similar breadth, exempts from preemption "any law of any Statewhich regulates insurance." The key words "regulates insurance" in $ 514(b)(2)(A), and "relate to" in $ 514(a), onceagain require interpretation, for their meaning is not "plain";
sensible construction of ERISA, our decisions indicate, re-quires that we measure these words in context. See

PilotLife Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, 481 U. S. 41, 47 (1987) (noting that

repeated calls for interpretation are not surprising in viewof "the wide variety of state statutory and decisional law
arguably affected" by ERISA's preemption and savingclauses).

The context here is a suit to recover disability benefitsunder an ERISA-gover ned insurance policy issued by
defendant-petitioner UNUM Life Insurance Company ofAmerica (UNUM). Plaintiff-respondent John E. Ward submitted his proof of claim to UNUM outside the time limit setin the policy, and UNUM therefore denied Ward's claim.

Ruling in Ward's favor, and reversing the District Court'ssummary judgment for UNUM, the Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit relied on decisional law in California, the Statein which Ward worked and in which his employer operated.
The Ninth Circuit's judgment rested on two grounds. That

Opinion of the Court
court relied first on California's "notice-prejudice" rule,under which an insurer cannot avoid liability although the

proof of claim is untimely, unless the insurer shows it wasprejudiced by the delay. The notice-prejudice rule is saved
from preemption, the Court of Appeals held, because it is"law . . . which regulates insurance." See

Ward v. Manage-ment Analysis Co. Employee Disability Benefit Plan, 135

F. 3d 1276, 1280 (1998).The Court of Appeals announced a further ground for reversing the District Court's judgment for UNUM, one thatwould come into play if the insurer proved prejudice due to
the delayed notice. Under California's decisions, the NinthCircuit said, the employer could be deemed an agent of the
insurer in administering group insurance policies. Ward'semployer knew of his disability within the time the policy
allowed for proof of claim. The Ninth Circuit held that thegenerally applicable agency law reflected in the California
cases does not "relate to" employee benefit plans, and there-fore is not preempted. See

id., at 1281-1283, 1287-1288.We granted certiorari, 525 U. S. 928 (1998), and now affirm

the Court of Appeals' first disposition, and reverse the sec-ond. California's notice-prejudice rule, we agree, is a "law
. . . which regulates insurance," and is therefore saved frompreemption by ERISA. California's agency law, we further
hold, does "relate to" employee benefit plans, and thereforedoes not occupy ground outside ERISA's preemption clause.

I
UNUM issued a long-term group disability policy to Man-agement Analysis Company (MAC) as an insured welfare

benefit plan governed by ERISA, effective November 1,1983. The policy provides that proofs of claim must be furnished to UNUM, at the latest, one year and 180 days afterthe onset of disability.

Ward was employed by MAC from 1983 until May 1992.Throughout this period, premiums for the disability policy

Opinion of the Court
were deducted from Ward's paycheck. Under the admittedfacts of the case, Ward became permanently disabled with

severe leg pain on the date of his resignation, May 5, 1992.See 135 F. 3d, at 1280.

Ward's condition was diagnosed as diabetic neuropathy in
December 1992. In late February or early March 1993, hequalified for state disability benefits and thereupon informed

MAC of his disability and inquired about continuing healthinsurance benefits. In July 1993, Ward received a determination of eligibility for Social Security disability benefits andforwarded a copy of this determination to MAC's human resources division. See id., at 1279. In April 1994, Ward discovered among his papers a booklet describing the long-term
disability plan and asked MAC whether the plan covered his
condition. When MAC told him he was covered, Ward completed an application for benefits and forwarded it to MAC.
In turn, and after filling in the employer information section,
MAC forwarded the application to UNUM. UNUM received proof of Ward's claim on April 11, 1994. See ibid.
This notice was late under the terms of the policy, which
required submission of proof of claim by November 5, 1993.
See id., at 1280. By letter dated April 13, 1994, UNUM advised Ward that his claim was denied as untimely. See id.,
at 1279.

In September 1994, Ward filed suit against the MAC plan
under $ 502 of ERISA, 29 U. S. C. $ 1132, to recover the disability benefits provided by the plan. UNUM appeared as
a defendant and answered on behalf of itself and the plan.
See 135 F. 3d, at 1279. To the District Court, Ward argued
that under Elfstrom v. New York Life Ins. Co., 67 Cal. 2d
503, 512, 432 P. 2d 731, 737 (1967) (en banc), a California employer that administers an insured group health plan should
be deemed to act as the agent of the insurance company.
Therefore, Ward asserted, his notice of permanent disability
to MAC, in February or March 1993, sufficed to supply timely
notice to UNUM. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 30a. The Dis526US2 Unit: $U47 [12-11-00 18:40:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
trict Court rejected this argument, concluding that theagency rule announced in Elfstrom "relate[s] to" ERISA

plans; hence it is preempted under $ 514(a), 29 U. S. C.$ 1144(a). See App. to Pet. for Cert. 30a. The District
Court further held that the Elfstrom rule is not saved frompreemption as a law that "regulates insurance" within the
compass of ERISA's insurance saving clause, $ 514(b)(2)(A),29 U. S. C. $ 1144(b)(2)(A). App. to Pet. for Cert. 31a. Accordingly, the court rendered summary judg ment inUNUM's favor. See

id., at 33a.The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, identifying two grounds on which Ward might prevail. First,following the Ninth Circuit's recent decision in

Cisneros v.UNUM Life Ins. Co., 134 F. 3d 939 (1998), the appeals court

held that California's notice-prejudice rule is saved fromERISA preemption as a law that "regulates insurance";
under the notice-prejudice rule, Ward's late notice would notpreclude his ERISA claim absent proof that the insurer suffered actual prejudice because of the delay. See 135 F. 3d,at 1280. Second, and contingently, the Ninth Circuit held
that the Elfstrom rule, under which the employer could bedeemed an agent of the insurer, does not "relate to" employee benefit plans, and therefore is not preempted by rea-son of ERISA. See 135 F. 3d, at 1287 (internal quotation
marks omitted). The court accordingly remanded the caseto the District Court for a determination whether UNUM
suffered actual prejudice on account of the late submissionof Ward's notice of claim; and if so, whether, under the reasoning of Elfstrom, Ward could nevertheless prevail becausehe had timely filed his claim. See 135 F. 3d, at 1289.

California's notice-prejudice rule prescribes:

"[A] defense based on an insured's failure to give timelynotice [of a claim] requires the insurer to prove that it

suffered substantial prejudice. Prejudice is not pre526US2 Unit: $U47 [12-11-00 18:40:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN

sumed from delayed notice alone. The insurer mustshow actual prejudice, not the mere possibility of prejudice." Shell Oil Co. v. Winterthur Swiss Ins. Co., 12Cal. App. 4th 715, 760-761, 15 Cal. Rptr. 2d 815, 845 (1st
Dist. 1993) (citations omitted).
The parties agree that the notice-prejudice rule falls underERISA's preemption clause, $ 514(a), as a state law that "relate[s] to" an employee benefit plan.1 Their dispute hingeson this question: Does the rule "regulat[e] insurance" and
thus escape preempti on under the saving clause,$ 514(b)(2)(A).

2

Our precedent provides a framework for resolvingwhether a state law "regulates insurance" within the meaning of the saving clause. First, we ask whether, from a"common-sense view of the matter," the contested prescription regulates insurance. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Mas-sachusetts, 471 U. S. 724, 740 (1985); see Pilot Life, 481 U. S.,
at 48. Second, we consider three factors employed to deter-mine whether the regulation fits within the "business of insurance" as that phrase is used in the McCarran-FergusonAct, 59 Stat. 33, as amended, 15 U. S. C. $ 1011

et seq.: "first,whether the practice has the effect of transferring or spreading a policyholder's risk; second, whether the practice is anintegral part of the policy relationship between the insurer
and the insured; and third, whether the practice is limited toentities within the insurance industry."

Metropolitan Life,

1 Common-law rules developed by decisions of state courts are "State
law" under ERISA. See 29 U. S. C. $ 1144(c)(1) ("The term `State law'
includes all laws, decisions, rules, regulations, or other State action having
the effect of law.").

2 State laws that purport to regulate insurance by "deem[ing]" a plan to

be an insurance company are outside the saving clause and remain subject
to preemption. See $ 1144(b)(2)(B). Self-insured ERISA plans, therefore, are generally sheltered from state insurance regulation. See Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts, 471 U. S. 724, 747 (1985). Because
this case does not involve a self-insured plan, this limitation on state regulatory authority is not at issue here.

471 U. S., at 743 (emphasis, citations, and internal quotationmarks omitted); see also Pilot Life, 481 U. S., at 48-49.

A
The Ninth Circuit concluded that California's notice-prejudice rule "regulates insurance" as a matter of common

sense. See Cisneros, 134 F. 3d, at 945. We do not normallydisturb an appeals court's judgment on an issue so heavily
dependent on analysis of state law, see Runyon v. McCrary,427 U. S. 160, 181-182 (1976), and we lack cause to do so here.
The California notice-prejudice rule controls the terms of theinsurance relationship by "requiring the insurer to prove
prejudice before enforcing proof-of-claim requirements."
Cisneros, 134 F. 3d, at 945. As the Ninth Circuit observed,the rule, by its very terms, "is directed specifically at the

insurance industry and is applicable only to insurance con-tracts."

Ibid.; see Brief for United States as Amicus Cu-riae 12 ("[O]ur survey of California law reveals no cases

where the state courts apply the notice-prejudice rule assuch outside the insurance area. Nor is this surprising,
given that the rule is stated in terms of prejudice to an `in-surer' resulting from untimeliness of notice."). The rule
thus appears to satisfy the common-sense view as a regula-tion that homes in on the insurance industry and does "not
just have an impact on [that] industry." Pilot Life, 481U. S., at 50.

UNUM and its amici urge in opposition to the Ninth Cir-cuit's common-sense conclusion that the notice-prejudice rule
is merely an industry-specific application of the general prin-ciple that "disproportionate forfeiture should be avoided
in the enforcement of contracts." See Brief for AmericanCouncil of Life Insurance et al. as Amici Curiae 13; Brief
for Association of California Life and Health Insurance Com-panies as Amicus Curiae 5 ("[N]otice-prejudice is merely a
branch of the broad doctrine of harmless error."). Given thetenet from which the notice-prejudice rule springs, UNUM

Opinion of the Court
maintains, the rule resembles the Mississippi law at issue in
Pilot Life; under that law, punitive damages could be sought
for "bad faith" in denying claims without any reasonably ar-guable basis for the refusal to pay. See 481 U. S., at 50. We

determined in Pilot Life that although Mississippi had "identified its law of bad faith with the insurance industry, theroots of this law are firmly planted in the general principles

of Mississippi tort and contract law." Ibid. "Any breach ofcontract," we observed, "and not merely breach of an insurance contract, may lead to liability for punitive damagesunder [the Mississippi common law of bad faith]."

Ibid.
Accordingly, we concluded, the Mississippi law did not "regulat[e] insurance" within the meaning of ERISA's saving
clause. Ibid.

We do not find it fair to bracket California's noticepre judice rule for insurance contracts with Mississippi's
broad gauged "bad faith" claim for relief. Insurance policies
like UNUM's frame timely notice provisions as conditions
precedent to be satisfied by the insured before an insurer's
contractual obligation arises. See 1 B. Witkin, Summary of
California Law, Contracts $ 726, p. 657 (9th ed. 1987); Zurn
Engineers v. Eagle Star Ins. Co., 61 Cal. App. 3d 493, 499,
132 Cal. Rptr. 206, 210 (2d Dist. 1976). Ordinarily, "failure
to comply with conditions precedent . . . prevents an action
by the defaulting party to enforce the contract." 14 Cal.
Jur. 3d, Contracts $ 245, p. 542 (3d ed. 1974). A recent California decision, Platt Pacific Inc. v. Andelson, 6 Cal. 4th 307,
862 P. 2d 158 (1993) (en banc), is illustrative. In that case,
the California Supreme Court adhered to the normal course:
It refused to excuse a plaintiff 's failure to comply with a
contractual requirement to timely demand arbitration, although there was no allegation that the defendant had been
prejudiced by the plaintiff 's lapse. The plaintiff had forfeited the right to pursue arbitration, the court concluded,
for "the condition precedent [of a timely demand] was neither legally excused nor changed by modification of the par526US2 Unit: $U47 [12-11-00 18:40:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ties' written agreement." Id., at 321, 862 P. 2d, at 167. "Acontrary conclusion," the court stated, "would undermine the

law of contracts by vesting in one contracting party thepower to unilaterally convert the other contracting party's
conditional obligation into an independent, unconditionalobligation notwithstanding the terms of the agreement."
Id., at 314, 862 P. 2d, at 162.It is no doubt true that diverse California decisions bear
out the maxim that "law abhors a forfeiture" 3 and that the

3 UNUM cites a handful of California cases of this genre. They do not
cast doubt on our disposition. In Conservatorship of Rand, 49 Cal. App.
4th 835, 57 Cal. Rptr. 2d 119 (4th Dist. 1996), the court found that a county
court rule governing notice to a conservatee of potential liability for fees
and costs did not comply with statutory notice requirements, but excused
the defective notice because the conservatee had suffered no prejudice.
See id., at 838-841, 57 Cal. Rptr. 2d, at 121-123. Rand was not a contract
case at all; it concerned the consequences of a court's violation of a statecreated notice provision in the context of a judicial proceeding. Industrial Asphalt Inc. v. Garrett Corp., 180 Cal. App. 3d 1001, 226 Cal. Rptr. 17
(2d Dist. 1986), concerned the notice requirements imposed by California's
mechanics lien law and turned on principles of statutory rather than contract interpretation. See id., at 1005-1006, 226 Cal. Rptr., at 18-19. In
Industrial Asphalt, moreover, the complaining party had received actual
notice of the claim underlying the lien. Ibid. Neither case suggests that
California courts are generally unwilling or reluctant to enforce time conditions in private contracts as written.

The older decisions on which UNUM relies are no more instructive.
The contract at issue in Ballard v. MacCallum, 15 Cal. 2d 439, 101 P. 2d
692 (1940) (en banc), contained contradictory clauses, some appearing to
provide for forfeiture in the event of default, others appearing to contemplate an opportunity to cure. See id., at 442, 101 P. 2d, at 694. The court
invoked a general presumption against forfeitures only to resolve the conflict. See id., at 444, 101 P. 2d, at 695. Finally, in Henck v. Lake Hemet
Water Co., 9 Cal. 2d 136, 69 P. 2d 849 (1937) (en banc), a water supplier
attempted to escape the terms of a long-term delivery contract on the
ground that the water recipient had not timely made annual payment.
The California Supreme Court rejected the supplier's plea, observing that
"in a proper case," equity permits a court to excuse a lapse like the recipient's in order to avoid forfeiture. See id., at 141, 142, 69 P. 2d, at 852.
The Henck court carefully weighed the competing interests of the parties

Opinion of the Court
notice-prejudice rule is an application of that maxim. Butit is an application of a special order, a rule mandatory for

insurance contracts, not a principle a court may pliably em-ploy when the circumstances so warrant. Tellingly, UNUM
has identified no California authority outside the insurancespecific notice-prejudice context indicating that as a matterof law, failure to abide by a contractual time condition does

not work a forfeiture absent prejudice. Outside the notice-prejudice context, the burden of justifying a departure from
a contract's written terms generally rests with the partyseeking the departure. See,

e. g., American Bankers Mortgage Corp. v. Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., 75 F. 3d1401, 1413 (CA9 1996);

CQL Original Products, Inc. v. National Hockey League Players' Assn., 39 Cal. App. 4th 1347,
1357-1358, n. 6, 46 Cal. Rptr. 2d 412, 418, n. 6 (4th Dist. 1995).In short, the notice-prejudice rule is distinctive most notably

because it is a rule firmly applied to insurance contracts, not
a general principle guiding a court's discretion in a range
of matters.4

and relied in part on the water supplier's fault in inducing the late payment. See id., at 144-145, 69 P. 2d, at 853; cf. Restatement (Second) of
Contracts $ 229, Comment c, Reporter's Note (1979) (courts are likely to
excuse obligor's failure strictly to adhere to a performance timetable
where obligee has induced the failure).

These decisions support the uncontested propositions that the law disfavors forfeitures and that in case-specific circumstances California courts
will excuse the breach of a time or notice provision in order to avoid an
inequitable forfeiture. None of the decisions even remotely suggests that
failures to comply with contractual notice periods are excused as a matter
of law absent prejudice; none, therefore, suggests that the notice-prejudice
rule is merely a routine application of a general antiforfeiture principle.

4 UNUM features $ 229 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts (1979),

and urges that the notice-prejudice rule fits within its compass. Section
229 provides that "[t]o the extent that the non-occurrence of a condition
would cause disproportionate forfeiture, a court may excuse the nonoccurrence of that condition unless its occurrence was a material part of
the agreed exchange." The notice-prejudice rule, however, is mandatory
rather than permissive; it requires California courts to excuse a failure to

Opinion of the Court
California's insistence that insurers show prejudice beforethey may deny coverage because of late notice is grounded

in policy concerns specific to the insurance industry. SeeBrief for Council of State Governments et al. as Amici Curiae 10-14. That grounding is key to our decision. An-nouncing the notice-prejudice rule in

Campbell v. AllstateIns. Co., 60 Cal. 2d 303, 384 P. 2d 155 (1963) (en banc), the

California Supreme Court emphasized the "public policy ofthis state" in favor of compensating insureds. Id., at 307,
384 P. 2d, at 157; see ibid. (weighing the relative burdensof notice-prejudice on insurers and insureds). Subsequent
notice-prejudice rulings have likewise focused on insuranceindustry policy and governance. See,

e. g., Hanover Ins. Co.v. Carroll, 241 Cal. App. 2d 558, 570, 50 Cal. Rptr. 704, 712

(1st Dist. 1966) (public policy respecting compensation of in-sured injured parties); Northwestern Title Security Co. v.
Flack, 6 Cal. App. 3d 134, 143-144, 85 Cal. Rptr. 693, 698 (1stDist. 1970) (extending notice-prejudice rule to "claims-type"
policies, rejecting contention that sound public policy re-quired limitation of rule to "occurrence-type" policies);

Pa-cific Employers Ins. Co. v. Superior Court, 221 Cal. App. 3d

1348, 1359-1360, 270 Cal. Rptr. 779, 784-785 (2d Dist. 1990)(evaluating insurance industry public policy considerations in
reaching the opposite conclusion). Decisions of courts inother States similarly indicate that the notice-prejudice rule
addresses policy concerns specific to insurance. See, e. g.,
Cooper v. Government Employees Ins. Co., 51 N. J. 86, 94,237 A. 2d 870, 874 (1968) (failure to adopt notice-prejudice

would "disserve the public interest, for insurance is an in-strument of a social policy that the victims of negligence be
compensated"); Great American Ins. Co. v. C. G. Tate Con-struction Co., 303 N. C. 387, 395, 279 S. E. 2d 769, 774 (1981)
("The [notice-prejudice] rule we adopt today has the advanprovide timely notice whenever the insurer cannot carry the burden of
showing actual prejudice, and it allows no argument over the materiality
of the time prescription.

tages of promoting social policy and fulfilling the reasonableexpectations of the purchaser while fully protecting the ability of the insurer to protect its own interests."); Alcazar v.Hayes, 982 S. W. 2d 845, 851-853 (Tenn. 1998) (surveying the
"compelling public policy justifications" that support depart-ing from traditional contract interpretation in favor of
notice-prejudice).In sum, the Ninth Circuit properly concluded that noticeprejudice is a rule of law governing the insurance relation-ship distinctively. We reject UNUM's contention that the
rule merely restates a general principle disfavoring forfeit-ures and conclude instead that notice-prejudice, as a matter
of common sense, regulates insurance.

B
We next consider the criteria used to determine whethera state law regulates the "business of insurance" within the

meaning of the McCarran-Ferguson Act. Preliminarily, wereject UNUM's assertion that a state regulation must satisfy
all three McCarran-Ferguson factors in order to "regulateinsurance" under ERISA's saving clause. Our precedent is
more supple than UNUM conceives it to be. We have indi-cated that the McCarran-Ferguson factors are "considerations [to be] weighed" in determining whether a state lawregulates insurance, Pilot Life, 481 U. S., at 49, and that
"[n]one of these criteria is necessarily determinative in it-self," Union Labor Life Ins. Co. v. Pireno, 458 U. S. 119, 129
(1982). In Metropolitan Life, the case in which we firstused the McCarran-Ferguson formulation to assess whether
a state law "regulates insurance" for purposes of ERISA'ssaving clause, we called the McCarran-Ferguson factors "relevant"; we did not describe them as "required." See 471U. S., at 743;

O'Connor v. UNUM Life Ins. Co. of America,146 F. 3d 959, 963 (CADC 1998) ("That the factors are merely

`relevant' suggests that they need not all point in the samedirection, else they would be `required.' "). As the Ninth

526US2 Unit: $U47 [12-11-00 18:40:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN
374 UNUM LIFE INS. CO. OF AMERICA v. WARD

Opinion of the Court
Circuit correctly recognized, Metropolitan Life asked first
whether the law there in question "fit a common-sense understanding of insurance regulation," Cisneros, 134 F. 3d, at
945, and then looked to the McCarran-Ferguson factors as
checking points or "guideposts, not separate essential elements . . . that must each be satisfied" to save the State's
law, id., at 946.

The first McCarran-Ferguson factor asks whether the rule
at issue "has the effect of transferring or spreading a policyholder's risk." Metropolitan Life, 471 U. S., at 743 (internal
quotation marks omitted). The Ninth Circuit determined
that the notice-prejudice rule does not satisfy that criterion
because it "does not alter the allocation of risk for which the
parties initially contracted, namely the risk of lost income
from long-term disability." Cisneros, 134 F. 3d, at 946.
The United States as amicus curiae, however, suggests that
the notice-prejudice rule might be found to satisfy the
McCarran-Ferguson "risk-spreading" factor: "Insofar as the
notice-prejudice rule shifts the risk of late notice and stale
evidence from the insured to the insurance company in some
instances, it has the effect of raising premiums and spreading
risk among policyholders." Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 14. We need not pursue this point, because
the remaining McCarran-Ferguson factors, verifying the
common-sense view, are securely satisfied.

Meeting the second factor, the notice-prejudice rule serves
as "an integral part of the policy relationship between the
insurer and the insured." Metropolitan Life, 471 U. S., at
743. California's rule changes the bargain between insurer
and insured; it "effectively creates a mandatory contract
term" that requires the insurer to prove prejudice before
enforcing a timeliness-of-claim provision. Cisneros, 134

F. 3d, at 946. As the Ninth Circuit stated: "The [noticeprejudice] rule dictates the terms of the relationship be526US2 Unit: $U47 [12-11-00 18:40:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN

375Cite as: 526 U. S. 358 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
tween the insurer and the insured, and consequently, is inte-gral to that relationship." Ibid.

5

The third McCarran-Ferguson factor--which asks whetherthe rule is limited to entities within the insurance industry--

is also well met. As earlier explained, see supra, at 368-373, California's notice-prejudice rule focuses on the insurance industry. The rule "does not merely have an impacton the insurance industry; it is aimed at it."

FMC Corp. v.Holliday, 498 U. S. 52, 61 (1990).

III
UNUM and its amici assert that even if the notice-prejudice rule is saved under 29 U. S. C. $ 1144(b)(2)(A), it is

nonetheless preempted because it conflicts with substantiveprovisions of ERISA in three ways. UNUM first contends
that the notice-prejudice rule, by altering the notice pro-visions of the insurance contract, conflicts with ERISA's
requirement that plan fiduciaries act "in accordance withthe documents and instruments governing the plan. "

$ 1104(a)(1)(D). According to UNUM, $ 1104(a)(1)(D) pre-empts any state law contrary to a written plan term. See
Brief for Petitioner 32-33; Tr. of Oral Arg. 8.UNUM's "contra plan term" argument overlooks controlling precedent and makes scant sense. We have repeatedlyheld that state laws mandating insurance contract terms are
saved from preemption under $ 1144(b)(2)(A). See Metro-politan Life, 471 U. S., at 758 ("Massachusetts' mandatedbenefit law is a `law which regulates insurance' and so is notpre-empted by ERISA as it applies to insurance contracts

5 We reject UNUM's suggestion that because the notice-prejudice rule
regulates only the administration of insurance policies, not their substantive terms, it cannot be an integral part of the policy relationship. See
Metropolitan Life, 471 U. S., at 728, n. 2 (including laws regulating claims
practices and requiring grace periods in catalog of state laws that regulate insurance).

Opinion of the Court
purchased for plans subject to ERISA."); FMC Corp., 498U. S., at 64 ("[I]f a plan is insured, a State may regulate it

indirectly through regulation of its insurer and its insurer'sinsurance contracts."). Under UNUM's interpretation of

$ 1104(a)(1)(D), however, States would be powerless to alterthe terms of the insurance relationship in ERISA plans; insurers could displace any state regulation simply by insert-ing a contrary term in plan documents. This interpretation
would virtually "rea[d] the saving clause out of ERISA."
Metropolitan Life, 471 U. S., at 741.6UNUM next contends that ERISA's civil enforcement provision, $ 502(a), 29 U. S. C. $ 1132(a), preempts any action forplan benefits brought under state rules such as noticepre judice. Whatever the merits of UNUM's view of$ 502(a)'s preemptive force,

7 the issue is not implicated here.

6 We recognize that applying the States' varying insurance regulations
creates disuniformities for "national plans that enter into local markets to
purchase insurance." Metropolitan Life, 471 U. S., at 747. As we have
observed, however, "[s]uch disuniformities . . . are the inevitable result of
the congressional decision to `save' local insurance regulation." Ibid.

7 We discussed this issue in Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, 481 U. S. 41

(1987). That case concerned Mississippi common law creating a cause of
action for bad-faith breach of contract, law not specifically directed to the
insurance industry and therefore not saved from ERISA preemption. In
that context, the Solicitor General, for the United States as amicus curiae,
urged the exclusivity of $ 502(a), ERISA's civil enforcement provision, and
observed that $ 502(a) was modeled on the exclusive remedy provided by

$ 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947 (LMRA), 29 U. S. C.

$ 185. The Court agreed with the Solicitor General's submission. 481
U. S., at 52-56.

In the instant case, the Solicitor General, for the United States as amicus curiae, has endeavored to qualify the argument advanced in Pilot
Life. See Brief 20-25. Noting that "LMRA Section 301 does not contain
any statutory exception analogous to ERISA's insurance savings provision," the Solicitor General now maintains that the discussion of $ 502(a)
in Pilot Life "does not in itself require that a state law that `regulates
insurance,' and so comes within the terms of the savings clause, is nevertheless preempted if it provides a state-law cause of action or remedy."
Brief 25; see also id., at 23 ("[T]he insurance savings clause, on its face,

Opinion of the Court
Ward sued under $ 502(a)(1)(B) "to recover benefits due . . .under the terms of his plan." The notice-prejudice rule supplied the relevant rule of decision for this $ 502(a) suit. Thecase therefore does not raise the question whether $ 502(a)
provides the sole launching ground for an ERISA enforce-ment action.

Finally, we reject UNUM's suggestion that the notice-prejudice rule conflicts with $ 503 of ERISA, 29 U. S. C.

$ 1133, which requires plans to provide notice and the oppor-tunity for review of denied claims, or with Department of
Labor regulations providing that "[a] claim is filed when therequirements of a reasonable claim filing procedure . . . have
been met," 29 CFR $ 2560.503-1(d) (1998). By allowing alonger period to file than the minimum filing terms mandated by federal law, the notice-prejudice rule complementsrather than contradicts ERISA and the regulations. See
Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 19, n. 9.

Ward successfully maintained in the Ninth Circuit thatMAC had timely notice of his disability and that his notice

to MAC could be found to have served as notice to UNUMon the theory that MAC, as administrator of the group policy, acted as UNUM's agent. The policy itself providesotherwise:

"For all purposes of this policy, the policyholder [MAC]acts on its own behalf or as agent of the employee.
Under no circumstances will the policyholder be deemedthe agent of the Company [UNUM] without a written
authorization." App. to Pet. for Cert. 44a.
saves state law conferring causes of action or affecting remedies that regulate insurance, just as it does state mandated-benefits laws."). We need
not address the Solicitor General's current argument, for Ward has sued
under $ 502(a)(1)(B) for benefits due, and seeks only the application of
saved state insurance law as a relevant rule of decision in his $ 502(a)
action.

378 UNUM LIFE INS. CO. OF AMERICA v. WARD

Opinion of the Court
California law rendered that policy provision ineffective, theNinth Circuit appeared to conclude, because under the rule

stated in Elfstrom v. New York Life Ins. Co., 67 Cal. 2d, at512, 432 P. 2d, at 737, "the employer is the agent of the insurer in performing the duties of administering group insurance policies." Thus, the Ninth Circuit instructed that, onremand, if UNUM was found to have suffered actual prejudice on account of Ward's late notice of claim, the DistrictCourt should then determine whether the claim was timely
under Elfstrom. 135 F. 3d, at 1289.Ward does not argue in this Court that the

Elfstrom rule,
as comprehended by the Ninth Circuit, is a law that "regulates insurance." See Brief for Respondent 35 (the Ninth
Circuit applied "general principles of agency law," not a rule
determining when "employers who administer insured plans
are agents of the insurer as a matter of law"). Indeed, it is
difficult to tell from the Court of Appeals opinion precisely
what rule or principle that court derived from Elfstrom.
See Brief for Respondent 35 ("[T]he court below did not actually apply the Elfstrom rule in this case."); 135 F. 3d, at
1283, and n. 6 (endorsing the reasoning of Paulson v. Western
Life Ins. Co, 292 Ore. 38, 636 P. 2d 935 (1981), an Oregon
Supreme Court decision that purported to reconcile Elfstrom with an apparently conflicting body of case law).
Whatever the contours of Elfstrom may be, the Ninth Circuit held that the state law emerging from that case does not
"relat[e] to" an ERISA plan within the meaning of $ 1144(a),
and therefore escapes preemption. See 135 F. 3d, at 1287.

In this determination, the Ninth Circuit was mistaken.
The Court of Appeals stated, without elaboration, that Elfstrom does not dictate "the manner in which the plan will be
administered," and therefore is consistent with this Court's
ERISA preemption precedent. Ibid.; see New York State
Conference of Blue Cross & Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers
Ins. Co., 514 U. S. 645, 657-658 (1995) (identifying among
laws that "relat[e] to" employee benefit plans those that

Opinion of the Court
"mandat[e] employee benefit structures or their adminis-tration"). The Ninth Circuit's statement is not firmly

grounded.As persuasively urged by the United States in its amicus
curiae brief, deeming the policyholder-employer the agent ofthe insurer would have a marked effect on plan administration. It would "forc[e] the employer, as plan administrator,to assume a role, with attendant legal duties and consequences, that it has not undertaken voluntarily"; it wouldaffect "not merely the plan's bookkeeping obligations regarding to whom benefits checks must be sent, but [would] alsoregulat[e] the basic services that a plan may or must provide
to its participants and beneficiaries." Brief 27. Satisfiedthat the Elfstrom rule "relate[s] to" ERISA plans, we reject
the Ninth Circuit's contrary determination.

* * *
For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of Ap-peals is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the case

is remanded for further proceedings consistent with thisopinion.

It is so ordered.

UNITED STATES v. HAGGAR APPAREL CO.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe federal circuit

No. 97-2044. Argued January 11, 1999--Decided April 21, 1999
Respondent sought a refund for customs duties imposed on garments it

shipped to this country from an assembly plant it controlled in Mexico.
If there were mere assembly in Mexico without other steps, the garments would have been eligible for a partial duty exemption under subheading 9802.00.80, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States
(HTSUS), 19 U. S. C. $ 1202, which applies to articles assembled abroad
and not otherwise improved except by an "operatio[n] incidental to the
assembly process." Respondent, however, also sought to permapress
the garments in order to maintain their creases and avoid wrinkles. To
accomplish this, respondent baked the chemically pretreated garments
at the Mexican plant. Claiming the baking was an added process in
addition to assembly, the Customs Service denied a duty exemption
under 19 CFR $ 10.16(c)(4), its regulation deeming all permapressing
operations to be an additional step in manufacture, not part of or incidental to the assembly process. Respondent brought this suit in the
Court of International Trade, which declined to treat the regulation as
controlling and ruled in respondent's favor. The Court of Appeals for
the Federal Circuit affirmed, declining to analyze the regulation under
Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467
U. S. 837.

Held:

1. The regulation in question is subject to Chevron analysis.
Pp. 385-393.

(a) The statutes authorizing customs classification regulations are
consistent with the usual rule that regulations of an administering
agency warrant judicial deference; and nothing in the regulation in question persuades the Court that the agency intended the regulation to
have some lesser force and effect. The statutory scheme does not support respondent's contention that the regulation is limited in application
to customs officers themselves and is not intended to govern the adjudication of importers' refund suits in the Court of International Trade.
The Customs Service (which is within the Treasury Department) is
charged with fixing duties applicable to imported goods under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury. See 19 U. S. C.

Syllabus

$ 1500(b). Respondent argues in vain that $ 1502(a), which directs the
Secretary to make classification rules for "the various ports of entry,"
authorizes regulations that have no bearing on the importer's rights, but
simply ensure that customs officers around the country classify goods
according to a similar and consistent scheme. Like other regulations
which help to define the legal relations between the Government and
regulated entities, customs regulations were authorized by Congress at
least in part to clarify the rights and obligations of importers. This
conclusion is not altered by the circumstance that the United States
Trade Representative and the International Trade Commission have
certain responsibilities for recommending and proclaiming changes in
the HTSUS. These powers pertain to changing or amending the tariff
schedules themselves; the Treasury Department and the Customs Service are charged with administering the adopted schedules applicable
on the date of importation. Language respondent cites in 19 CFR

$ 10.11(a) does not suffice to displace the usual Chevron deference. Particularly in light of the fact that the agency utilized the notice-andcomment rulemaking process before issuing the regulations, the argument that they were not intended to be entitled to judicial deference
implies a sufficient departure from conventional contemporary administrative practice that this Court ought not to adopt it absent a different
statutory structure and more express language to this effect in the regulations themselves. Pp. 385-390.

(b) The Court also rejects respondent's argument that even if the
Treasury Department did intend the regulation to bear on the determination of refund suits, 28 U. S. C. $$ 2643, 2640(a), and 2638 empower the
Court of International Trade to interpret the tariff statute without
giving Chevron deference to regulations issued by the administering
agency. A central theme in respondent's argument is that such deference is not owed because the trial court proceedings may be, as they
were below, de novo. The conclusion does not follow from the premise.
De novo proceedings presume a foundation of law. The question here
is whether the regulations are part of that controlling law. Deference
can be given to the regulations without impairing the court's authority
to make factual determinations, and to apply those determinations to
the law, de novo. Under Chevron, if the agency's statutory interpretation clarifies an ambiguity in a way that is reasonable in light of the
legislature's revealed design, the Court gives that judgment controlling
weight. NationsBank of N. C., N. A. v. Variable Annuity Life Ins. Co.,
513 U. S. 251, 257. Although the statute under which respondent claims
an exemption gives direction not only by stating a general policy (to
grant the partial exemption where only assembly and incidental opera526US2 Unit: $U48 [12-11-00 18:45:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Syllabus
tions were abroad) but also by determining some specifics of the policy
(finding that painting, for example, is incidental to assembly), the statute
is ambiguous nonetheless in that the agency must use its discretion to
determine how best to implement the policy in those cases not covered
by the statute's specific terms. Finally, contrary to respondent's contention, the historical practice in customs cases is not so uniform and
clear as to convince the Court that judicial deference would thwart congressional intent. See, e. g., United States v. Vowell, 5 Cranch 368.
Pp. 390-393.

2. If the regulation in question is a reasonable interpretation and
implementation of an ambiguous statutory provision, it must be given
judicial deference. Pp. 394-395.

(a) The customs regulations may not be disregarded. Application
of the Chevron framework is the beginning of the legal analysis, and the
Court of International Trade must, when appropriate, give regulations
Chevron deference. Cf. Atlantic Mut. Ins. Co. v. Commissioner, 523
U. S. 382, 389. That court's expertise guides it in making complex determinations in a specialized area of the law; it is well positioned to
evaluate customs regulations and their operation in light of the statutory mandate to determine if the preconditions for Chevron deference
are present. P. 394.

(b) This Court declines to reach the question whether 19 CFR

$ 10.16(c) meets the preconditions for Chevron deference as a reasonable
interpretation of the statutory phrase "operations incidental to the assembly process." Because the Federal Circuit determined the Chevron
framework was not applicable, it did not go on to consider whether the

Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case concerns regulations relating to the customsclassification of certain imported goods. The regulations

were issued by the United States Customs Service with ap-proval of the Secretary of the Treasury. The question is
whether these regulations, deemed controlling by the Treas-ury, are entitled to judicial deference in a refund suit brought
in the Court of International Trade. Contrary to the posi-tion of that court and the Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit, we hold the regulation in question is subject to theanalysis required by

Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Re-sources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984), and that

if it is a reasonable interpretation and implementation ofan ambiguous statutory provision, it must be given judicial
deference. I

Respondent Haggar Apparel Co. designs, manufactures,and markets apparel for men. This matter arises from a
refund proceeding for duties imposed on men's trousersshipped by respondent to this country from an assembly
plant it controlled in Mexico. The fabric had been cut inthe United States and then shipped to Mexico, along with
the thread, buttons, and zippers necessary to complete thegarments. App. 37-38. There the trousers were sewn and
reshipped to the United States. If that had been the fullextent of it, there would be no dispute, for if there were

Opinion of the Court
mere assembly without other steps, all agree the importedgarments would have been eligible for the duty exemption

which respondent claims.Respondent, however, in the Government's view, added
one other step at the Mexican plant: permapressing. Permapressing is designed to maintain a garment's crease in thedesired place and to avoid other creases or wrinkles that

detract from its proper appearance. There are variousmethods and sequences by which permapressing can be accomplished, and one of respondent's contentions is that theTreasury's categorical approach fails to take these differences into account.

For the permapressed garments in question here, respondent purchased fabric in the United States that had been
treated with a chemical resin. Id., at 37. After the treated
fabric had been cut in the United States, shipped to Mexico,
and sewn and given a regular pressing there, respondent
baked the garments in an oven at the Mexican facility before
tagging and shipping them to the United States. The baking operation took some 12 to 15 minutes. Id., at 38. With
the right heat, the preapplied chemical was activated and the
permapress quality was imparted to the garment. If it had
delayed baking until the articles returned to the United
States, respondent would have had to take extra, otherwise
unnecessary steps in the United States before shipping the
garments to retailers. Id., at 127-128; App. to Pet. for Cert.
20a-21a. In addition, respondent maintained below, there
would have been a risk that during shipping unwanted
creases and wrinkles might have developed in the otherwise
finished garments. Ibid.

The Customs Service claimed the baking was an added
process in addition to assembly, and denied a duty exemption; respondent claimed the baking was simply part of the
assembly process, or, in the words of the controlling statute,
an "operatio[n] incidental to the assembly process." Subheading 9802.00.80, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the

(1982 ed.). Respondent's case was made more difficult by aregulation, to be discussed further, that deems all permapressing operations to be an additional step in manufacture,not part of or incidental to the assembly process. See 19
CFR $ 10.16(c) (1998). The issue before us is the force andeffect of the regulation in subsequent judicial proceedings.

After being denied the exemption it sought for the perma-pressed articles, respondent brought suit for refund in the
Court of International Trade. The court declined to treatthe regulation as controlling. 938 F. Supp. 868, 874-875
(1996). In making its determination, the court relied on adetailed analysis stemming from United States v. Mast Industries, Inc., 668 F. 2d 501 (CCPA 1981), a leading prece-dent on this duty exemption from the predecessor to the
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Mast Industries,in fact, involved garment fabrication and assembly, though
the Court of International Trade drew also on cases involv-ing other assembly operations.

E. g., 938 F. Supp., at 872(citing General Motors Corp. v. United States, 976 F. 2d 716

(CA Fed. 1992) (painting of sheet metal component partsused in motor vehicles)). The court ruled in favor of respondent. 938 F. Supp., at 875. On review, the Court ofAppeals for the Federal Circuit declined to analyze the regulation under Chevron, and affirmed. 127 F. 3d 1460, 1462(1997). We granted certiorari, 524 U. S. 981 (1998), and we
now vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and re-mand the case for further proceedings.

II
The statute on which respondent relies provides importersa partial exemption from duties otherwise imposed. The

exemption extends to:

"Articles . . . assembled abroad in whole or in part offabricated components, the product of the United States,

Opinion of the Court
which . . . (c) have not been advanced in value or im-proved in condition abroad except by being assembled

and except by operations incidental to the assemblyprocess such as cleaning, lubricating and painting."
Subheading 9802.00.80, HTSUS, 19 U. S. C. $ 1202.
(The HTSUS became law on January 1, 1989, replacing theprovisions of the former TSUS. See 19 U. S. C. $ 3004.

Item 807.00 of the TSUS, the previous statute which governssome of the shipments at issue in this case, is identical to
HTSUS Subheading 9802.00.80.)The relevant regulation interpreting the statute with respect to permapressed articles provides as follows:

"Any significant process, operation, or treatmentother than assembly whose primary purpose is the fabrication, completion, physical or chemical improvement ofa component, or which is not related to the assembly
process, whether or not it effects a substantial trans-formation of the article, shall not be regarded as incidental to the assembly and shall preclude the applicationof the exemption to such article. The following are examples of operations not considered incidental to theassembly . . . :

. . . . ."(4) Chemical treatment of components or assembled
articles to impart new characteristics, such as shower-proofing, permapressing, sanforizing, dying or bleaching
of textiles." 19 CFR $ 10.16(c) (1998).
The regulation was adopted in 1975 by the Commissionerof Customs upon approval by the Treasury Department,

after notice-and-comment rulemaking. See 39 Fed. Reg.24651 (1974) (proposed regulation); 40 Fed. Reg. 43021 (1975)
(final regulation).In contending that the regulation is not within the general
purview of the Chevron framework, respondent advancestwo sets of arguments. First, citing the terms of the regula526US2 Unit: $U48 [12-11-00 18:45:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN

387Cite as: 526 U. S. 380 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
tion and its enabling statutes, respondent contends the regu-lation is limited in application to customs officers themselves

and is not intended to govern the adjudication of importers'refund suits in the Court of International Trade. Second,
in reliance on the authority and jurisdiction of the Court of
International Trade, respondent argues that even if theTreasury Department did intend the regulation to bear on

the determination of refund suits, the Court of InternationalTrade is empowered to interpret the tariff statute without
giving the usual deference to regulations issued by the ad-ministering agency.

As to the first set of arguments, respondent says the regulation binds Customs Service employees when they classify
imported merchandise under the tariff schedules but does
not bind the importers themselves. The statutory scheme
does not support this limited view of the force and effect of
the regulation. The Customs Service (which is within the
Treasury Department) is charged with the classification of
imported goods under the proper provision of the tariff
schedules in the first instance. There is specific statutory
direction to this effect: "The Customs Service shall, under
rules and regulations prescribed by the Secretary [of the
Treasury,] . . . fix the final classification and rate of duty
applicable to" imported goods. 19 U. S. C. $ 1500(b). In addition, the Secretary is directed by statute to "establish and
promulgate such rules and regulations not inconsistent with
the law . . . as may be necessary to secure a just, impartial
and uniform appraisement of imported merchandise and the
classification and assessment of duties thereon at the various
ports of entry." $ 1502(a). See also General Headnote 11,
TSUS, 19 U. S. C. $ 1202 (1982 ed.) (authorizing the Secretary
"to issue rules and regulations governing the admission of
articles under the provisions" of the tariff schedules); General Note 20, HTSUS, 19 U. S. C. $ 1202 (same). The Secretary, in turn, has delegated to the Commissioner of Customs
the authority to issue generally applicable regulations, sub526US2 Unit: $U48 [12-11-00 18:45:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN
388 UNITED STATES v. HAGGAR APPAREL CO.

Opinion of the Court
ject to the Secretary's approval. Treasury Dept. OrderNo. 165, T. D. 53160 (Dec. 15, 1952).

Respondent relies on the specific direction to the Secre-tary to make rules of classification for "the various ports of
entry" to argue that the statute authorizes promulgation of
regulations that do nothing more than ensure that customsofficers in field offices around the country classify goods according to a similar and consistent scheme. The regulationsissued under the statute have no bearing, says respondent,
on the rights of the importer. We disagree. The phrase inquestion is explained by the simple fact that classification
decisions must be made at the port where goods enter. We
shall not assume Congress was concerned only to ensure that
customs officials at the various ports of entry make uniform
decisions but that it had no concern for uniformity once the
goods entered the country and judicial proceedings commenced. The tariffs do not mean one thing for customs officers and another for importers. It is of course possible,
even common, for agencies to give instructions or legal opinions to their officers and employees in one form or another,
without intending to bind the public. Cf. Crandon v. United
States, 494 U. S. 152, 177 (1990) (Scalia, J., concurring in
judgment). The statutory authorization for the regulations
in this case, we conclude, was not limited in this way. Like
other regulations which help to define the legal relations
between the Government and regulated entities, customs
regulations were authorized by Congress at least in part to
clarify the rights and obligations of importers.

Our conclusion is not altered by the circumstance that the
United States Trade Representative (USTR), by delegation from the President, and the International Trade Commission (ITC) have certain responsibilities for recommending and proclaiming changes in the HTSUS. See 19 U. S. C.

$$ 3004(c), 3005, 3006; 3 CFR 443 (1992). These powers pertain to changing or amending the tariff schedules themselves; the Treasury Department and the Customs Service

526US2 Unit: $U48 [12-11-00 18:45:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
are charged with administering the adopted schedules appli-cable on the date of importation. This also is the position

of the Government, for it acknowledged at oral argumentthat it is for the Treasury Department and the Customs
Service, not for the USTR or ITC, to issue regulations entitled to judicial deference in the interpretation of the tariffschedules. Tr. of Oral Arg. 14.

Respondent further cites a portion of the regulation andargues that the Customs Service itself views its regulatory
authority as limited to controlling its own agents' classifica-tion decisions, without affecting the course of later proceedings. It cites subsection (a) of 19 CFR $ 10.11 (1998), which
introduces $ 10.16 and the other classification regulations
adopted at the same time. Section 10.11(a) provides that
"[t]he definitions and regulations that follow are promulgated
to inform the public of the constructions and interpretations
that the United States Customs Service shall give to relevant statutory terms and to assure the impartial and uniform
assessment of duties upon merchandise claimed to be partially exempt from duty . . . at the various ports of entry."
It further provides that "[n]othing in these regulations
purports or is intended to restrict the legal right of importers or others to a judicial review of the matters contained
therein." Ibid.

This language, in our view, does not suffice to displace the
usual rule of Chevron deference. Subsections (a) and (b) of

$ 10.11 together serve to introduce the two kinds of regulations which follow. Section 10.11(b) advises that a refund
claimant must comply with both the substantive terms of the
statute and with certain "documentary requirements" set
forth in $ 10.24. If the importer fails to comply with the
documentary requirements, it is foreclosed from judicial review of the classification decision. $ 10.11(b). In contrast,
subsection (a) recites that nothing in the substantive classification regulations "purports or is intended to restrict the
legal right . . . to a judicial review of the matters contained

390 UNITED STATES v. HAGGAR APPAREL CO.

Opinion of the Court
therein." Assuming an importer complies with the docu-mentary requirements of $ 10.24, the disclaimer in $ 10.11(a)

is applicable, and the importer is entitled to bring a refundsuit challenging Customs' decision in federal court.

Apart from underscoring this distinction between substan-tive rules and documentary requirements, the quoted language from $ 10.11(a) may be thought surplusage in that itmerely confirms the existence of judicial review. Even if the
language is thought to be unnecessary, however, we do notview it as a tacit instruction for courts to disregard the substantive regulations. Particularly in light of the fact thatthe agency utilized the notice-and-comment rulemaking
process before issuing the regulations, the argument thatthey were not intended to be entitled to judicial deference
implies a sufficient departure from conventional contempo-rary administrative practice that we ought not to adopt it
absent a different statutory structure and more express lan-guage to this effect in the regulations themselves.

III
For the reasons we have given, the statutes authorizingcustoms classification regulations are consistent with the

usual rule that regulations of an administering agency war-rant judicial deference; and nothing in the regulation itself
persuades us that the agency intended the regulation to havesome lesser force and effect. We turn to respondent's second major contention, that the statutes governing the re-viewing authority of the Court of International Trade in
classification cases displace this customary framework.In support of the argument that Chevron rules are inapplicable, both respondent and the Court of Appeals rely on 28U. S. C. $ 2643. It provides:

"If the Court of International Trade is unable to deter-mine the correct decision on the basis of the evidence
presented in any civil action, the court may order a re-trial or rehearing for all purposes, or may order such

526US2 Unit: $U48 [12-11-00 18:45:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN

391Cite as: 526 U. S. 380 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
further administrative or adjudicative procedures as thecourt considers necessary to reach the correct decision."

The authority of the Court of International Trade to orderadditional proceedings to reach the correct decision, as well
as its duty to "make its determinations upon the basis ofthe record made before the court," $ 2640(a), and its authority to consider new grounds not advanced to the agency,$ 2638, are said to be inconsistent with deference to an
agency's regulation.A central theme in respondent's argument is that the trial
court proceedings may be, as they were in this case, de novo,and hence the court owes no deference to the regulation
under Chevron principles. Brief for Respondent 16-28.The conclusion does not follow from the premise. Valid regulations establish legal norms. Courts can give themproper effect even while applying the law to newfound facts,
just as any court conducting a trial in the first instance mustconform its rulings to controlling statutes, rules, and judicial
precedents. Though Congress might have chosen to directthe court not to pay deference to the agency's views, we do
not find that directive in these statutes. Cf. Scalia, JudicialDeference to Administrative Interpretations of Law, 1989
Duke L. J. 511, 515-516 (suggesting that "[i]f . . . Congresshad specified that in all suits involving interpretation or application of [a statute] the courts were to give no deferenceto the agency's views, but were to determine the issue de
novo," Chevron deference would be inappropriate). De novoproceedings presume a foundation of law. The question
here is whether the regulations are part of that controllinglaw. Deference can be given to the regulations without impairing the authority of the court to make factual determina-tions, and to apply those determinations to the law, de novo.

The Court of Appeals held in this case, and in previouscases presenting the issue, that these regulations were not
entitled to deference because the Court of InternationalTrade is charged to " `reach the correct decision' " in deter526US2 Unit: $U48 [12-11-00 18:45:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN
392 UNITED STATES v. HAGGAR APPAREL CO.

Opinion of the Court
mining the proper classification of goods. 127 F. 3d, at 1462;see also

Rollerblade, Inc. v. United States, 112 F. 3d 481, 483
(CA Fed. 1997); Universal Elecs. Inc. v. United States, 112F. 3d 488, 491-493 (CA Fed. 1997). The whole point of regulations such as these, however, is to ensure that the statute
is applied in a consistent and proper manner. Deference toan agency's expertise in construing a statutory command is

not inconsistent with reaching a correct decision.The analysis of a regulation's application in any particular
case, of course, may disclose an imprecise or imperfect imple-mentation of the statute. "One can doubtless imagine questionable applications of the regulation that test the limits
of the agency's authority." Babbitt v. Sweet Home Chapter,
Communities for Great Ore., 515 U. S. 687, 714 (1995)
(O'Connor, J., concurring). In the process of considering a
regulation in relation to specific factual situations, a court
may conclude the regulation is inconsistent with the statutory language or is an unreasonable implementation of it.
In those instances, the regulation will not control. Under
Chevron, if a court determines that "Congress has directly
spoken to the precise question at issue," then "that is the
end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must
give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress." 467 U. S., at 842-843. If, however, the agency's
statutory interpretation "fills a gap or defines a term in
a way that is reasonable in light of the legislature's revealed design, we give [that] judgment `controlling weight.' "
NationsBank of N. C., N. A. v. Variable Annuity Life Ins.
Co., 513 U. S. 251, 257 (1995) (quoting Chevron, supra, at 844).

A statute may be ambiguous, for purposes of Chevron
analysis, without being inartful or deficient. The present
case exemplifies the familiar proposition that Congress need
not, and likely cannot, anticipate all circumstances in which
a general policy must be given specific effect. Here Congress has authorized the agency to issue rules so that the
tariff statutes may be applied to unforeseen situations and

526US2 Unit: $U48 [12-11-00 18:45:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN

393Cite as: 526 U. S. 380 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
changing circumstances in a manner consistent with Con-gress' general intent. The statute under which respondent

claims an exemption gives direction not only by stating ageneral policy (to grant the partial exemption where only
assembly and incidental operations were abroad) but also by
determining some specifics of the policy (finding that paint-ing, for example, is incidental to assembly). For purposes of

the Chevron analysis, the statute is ambiguous nonetheless,ambiguous in that the agency must use its discretion to determine how best to implement the policy in those cases notcovered by the statute's specific terms. Those specifics are
instructive to the agency as to the general congressional purpose, and the agency's rules as to instances not covered by
the statute should be parallel, to the extent possible, with
the specific cases Congress did address.

Finally, respondent and a supporting amicus contend
Chevron deference is inconsistent with the historical practice
in customs cases. Brief for Respondent 1-6; Brief for Customs and International Trade Bar Association as Amicus
Curiae 6-11. This history, suffice it to say, is not so uniform
and clear as to convince us that judicial deference would
thwart congressional intent. As early as 1809, Chief Justice
Marshall noted in a customs case that "[i]f the question had
been doubtful, the court would have respected the uniform
construction which it is understood has been given by the
treasury department of the United States upon similar questions." United States v. Vowell, 5 Cranch 368, 372. See
also P. Reed, The Role of Federal Courts in U. S. Customs &
International Trade Law 289 (1997) ("Consistent with the
Chevron methodology, and as has long been the rule in customs cases, customs regulations are sustained if they represent reasonable interpretations of the statute"); cf. Zenith
Radio Corp. v. United States, 437 U. S. 443, 450 (1978) (deferring to the Treasury Department's "longstanding and consistent administrative interpretation" of the countervailing
duty provision of the Tariff Act).

Opinion of the Court

IV

A

The customs regulations may not be disregarded. Appli-cation of the

Chevron framework is the beginning of the legal
analysis. Like other courts, the Court of InternationalTrade must, when appropriate, give regulations

Chevron
deference. Cf. Atlantic Mut. Ins. Co. v. Commissioner, 523U. S. 382, 389 (1998) (when a term in the Internal Revenue

Code is ambiguous, "the task that confronts us is to decide,not whether the Treasury regulation represents the best interpretation of the statute, but whether it represents a reasonable one"). The expertise of the Court of InternationalTrade, somewhat like the expertise of the Tax Court, guides

it in making complex determinations in a specialized area ofthe law; it is well positioned to evaluate customs regulations
and their operation in light of the statutory mandate todetermine if the preconditions for

Chevron deference are
present. B

In addition to the applicability of the Chevron frameworkin general, we also granted certiorari on a second question,
asking whether 19 CFR $ 10.16(c) (1998) met the precondi-tions for

Chevron deference as a reasonable interpretation of
the statutory phrase "operations incidental to the assembly
process," Subheading 9802.00.80, HTSUS, 19 U. S. C. $ 1202,and Item 807.00, TSUS, 19 U. S. C. $ 1202 (1982 ed.). Because the Court of Appeals determined the Chevron frame-work was not applicable, it did not go on to consider whether
the regulation ultimately warrants deference under that
framework.

Respondent has made various arguments turning on the
details and facts of its manufacturing process, including substantial arguments challenging the regulation's interpretation of the statutory language as well as the application of
the regulation to the particular process and goods at issue

here. For instance, the Customs Service granted the ex-emption for trousers made from a pure synthetic fabric,

which were apparently pressed in the Mexico facility. App.33, 37; Brief for Respondent 47. Yet it denied the exemption
when ovenbaking was used for 12 to 15 minutes after somepressing, notwithstanding the fact that the permapress characteristics could have been achieved on the trousers involvedhere by pressing them for an additional period of time in lieu
of ovenbaking. Tr. 79-87. Moreover, though the regula-tion refers to the "[c]hemical treatment of components, . . .
such as . . . permapressing," 19 CFR $ 10.16(c)(4) (1998), it isundisputed that the chemical resin was applied to the trousers in the United States. App. 37.It will be open to respondent on remand to argue that the
baking of the garments in quantity is, from the standpointof the statute or the regulation itself, no less incidental to
the assembly process which the statute permits, or no morewithin the regulation's reference to permapressing, than is a
pressing-only operation. We conclude that these and similararguments, which raise the difficult question of how the regulation at issue fares under the Chevron framework, are bestaddressed in the first instance to the Court of Appeals for
the Federal Circuit or to the Court of International Trade.Declining to reach the second question on which certiorari
was granted, we remand the case to the Court of Appeals.The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded for
further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.
Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins,concurring in part and dissenting in part.

Like the statutory provision it explicates, the CustomsService regulation at issue begins with a generally applicable standard for a duty exemption, and concludes with rela-tively specific examples that indicate how that standard
should be interpreted. See Subheading 9802.00.80, Harmo526US2 Unit: $U48 [12-11-00 18:45:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN

nized Tariff Schedule of the United States, 19 U. S. C. $ 1202(listing operations taking place abroad that meet the standard); Item 807.00, Tariff Schedule of the United States, 19U. S. C. $ 1202 (1982 ed.) (same); 19 CFR $ 10.16(c) (1998)
(listing such operations that do not meet the standard).
Surely the agency's effort to enumerate "significant" andcommon operations not to be considered incidental to the assembly process was both permissible and sensible. Nothingin the statute or its history convinces me otherwise; in my
opinion, the regulation is clearly valid.Respondent's strongest challenge to the judgment of the
Customs Service is that the Service has misinterpreted and
misapplied one of its excluded examples: "Chemical treatment . . . to impart new characteristics, such as . . . permapressing." 19 CFR $ 10.16(c)(4) (1998). With respect to
the entries denied a duty exemption in this case, the fabric
was resin treated in the United States at the textile mill,
but pressed and ovenbaked in Mexico after assembly. Yet
the Service apparently granted a duty exemption for trousers respondent assembled from synthetic fabric; these trousers did not require ovenbaking or resin treatment, but
they were pressed in Mexico after assembly. See App. to
Pet. for Cert. 8a-9a, 15a-16a; App. 33-34, 37-38. Respondent contends that the Service cannot treat pressing-plusovenbaking, but not pressing alone, as a species of chemical
treatment that is not incidental to the assembly process.

There is a rather obvious answer to this contention. One
can certainly discern a meaningful difference between
merely pressing a synthetic fabric, on the one hand, and
using ovenbaking (or perhaps extended pressing) to treat a
fabric to which another substance has been added. Based
on that difference, the Service could logically conclude, in
accord with its understanding of its own regulation, that only
the latter is a form of "chemical treatment" excluded from a
duty exemption. Indeed, distinguishing these two operations in this fashion is the product of the kind of line-drawing

the assembly process," there will always be cases on oppositesides of the line that are almost identical. That consequence, however, does not necessarily compromise the integ-rity of the line that the agency has drawn or the manner in
which the rule was applied.In my view, the regulation before us is a reasonable elaboration of the statute, and the Customs Service's denial of aduty allowance in this case was consistent with its regulation
and well within the scope of its congressionally delegatedauthority. If we had not granted certiorari to decide the
reasonableness of the regulation, I would agree with theCourt's disposition of the case. See

Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 526 U. S. 137, 159 (1999) (Stevens, J., concurring inpart and dissenting in part). But since we did direct the

parties to enlighten us on these issues, and since I think theanswer is clear, I would simply reverse the judgment of the
Court of Appeals. I do, however, join Parts I, II, and III ofthe Court's well-reasoned opinion.

UNITED STATES v. SUN-DIAMOND GROWERSOF CALIFORNIA
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe district of columbia circuit

No. 98-131. Argued March 2, 1999--Decided April 27, 1999
Respondent trade association was charged with violating, inter alia, 18

U. S. C. $ 201(c)(1)(A), which prohibits giving "anything of value" to
a present, past, or future public official "for or because of any official
act performed or to be performed by such public official." Count One
of the indictment asserted that respondent gave illegal gratuities to former Secretary of Agriculture Michael Espy while two matters in which
it had an interest in favorable treatment were pending before Espy.
The indictment did not, however, allege a specific connection between
either of those matters (or any other Espy action) and the gratuities
conferred. In denying respondent's motion to dismiss Count One because of this omission, the District Court stated that, to sustain a

$ 201(c)(1)(A) charge, it is sufficient to allege that the defendant provided things of value to the official because of his position. At trial,
the court instructed the jury along these same lines. The jury convicted respondent on Count One, and the court imposed a fine. The
Court of Appeals reversed that conviction and remanded for a new
trial, stating that, because $ 201(c)(1)(A)'s "for or because of any official
act" language means what it says, the instructions invited the jury to
convict on materially less evidence than the statute demands--evidence
of gifts driven simply by Espy's official position. In rejecting respondent's attack on the indictment, however, the court stated that the Government need not show that a gratuity was given "for or because of"
any particular act or acts: That an official has relevant matters before
him should not insulate him as long as the jury is required to find the
requisite intent to reward past favorable acts or to make future ones
more likely.

Held:

1. In order to establish a $ 201(c)(1)(A) violation, the Government
must prove a link between a thing of value conferred upon a federal
official and a specific "official act" for or because of which it was given.
The Government's contention that $ 201(c)(1)(A) is satisfied merely by a
showing that respondent gave Secretary Espy a gratuity because of his
official position does not fit comfortably with the statutory text, the
more natural meaning of which is "for or because of some particular

Syllabus
official act of whatever identity." The statute's insistence upon an "official act," carefully defined (in $ 201(a)(3)), seems pregnant with the
requirement that some particular official act be identified and proved.
The Government's alternative reading would produce peculiar results,
criminalizing, e. g., token gifts to the President based on his official position and not linked to any identifiable act--such as the replica jerseys
given by championship sports teams each year during ceremonial White
House visits. Although, under the more narrow interpretation, the jerseys could be regarded as having been conferred (perhaps principally)
"for or because of" the official act of receiving sports teams at the White
House, such receipt--while assuredly an "official act" in some sense--is
not an "action on [a] matter . . . before any public official, in [his] official
capacity, or in [his] place of trust or profit" within the meaning of the

$ 201(a)(3) definition. The Government's insistence that its interpretation is the only one that gives effect to $ 201(c)(1)(A)'s forward-looking
prohibition on gratuities to selectees for federal office is rejected because the section can readily be applied to such persons even under the
more narrow interpretation. Pp. 404-408.

2. The Court's holding is supported by the fact that when Congress
has wanted to adopt a broadly prophylactic criminal prohibition upon
gift giving, it has done so in a more precise and more administrable
fashion. See, e. g., $ 209(a). Finally, a narrow, rather than a sweeping, prohibition is more compatible with the fact that $ 201(c)(1)(A) is
merely one strand of an intricate web of regulations, both administrative
and criminal, governing the acceptance of gifts and other self-enriching
actions by public officials. Because this is an area where precisely targeted prohibitions are commonplace, and where more general prohibitions have been qualified by numerous exceptions, a statute that can
linguistically be interpreted to be either a meat axe or a scalpel should
reasonably be taken to be the latter. Pp. 408-412.

3. The Court rejects the Government's contention that the District
Court's mistaken instructions concerning $ 201(c)(1)(A)'s scope--which
essentially and incorrectly substituted the term "official position" for
"official act"--constituted harmless error. The Government's argument
that the jury's verdict rendered pursuant to the instructions necessarily
included a finding that respondent's gratuities were given and received
"for or because of" official acts is but a restatement of the same flawed
premise that permeated the instructions themselves and that the Court
has herein rejected. Pp. 412-414.

Talmudic sages believed that judges who accepted bribeswould be punished by eventually losing all knowledge of the

divine law. The Federal Government, dealing with manypublic officials who are not judges, and with at least some
judges for whom this sanction holds no terror, has con-structed a framework of human laws and regulations defining various sorts of impermissible gifts, and punish-ing those who give or receive them with administrative
sanctions, fines, and incarceration. One element of thatframework is 18 U. S. C. $ 201(c)(1)(A), the "illegal gratuity statute," which prohibits giving "anything of value" toa present, past, or future public official "for or because of
any official act performed or to be performed by such publicofficial." In this case, we consider whether conviction under
the illegal gratuity statute requires any showing beyond thefact that a gratuity was given because of the recipient's official position. I

growers of raisins, figs, walnuts, prunes, and hazelnuts.Petitioner United States is represented by Independent

Counsel Donald Smaltz, who, as a consequence of his in-vestigation of former Secretary of Agriculture Michael Espy,
charged respondent with, inter alia, making illegal gifts to
Espy in violation of $ 201(c)(1)(A). That statute provides,in relevant part, that anyone who

"otherwise than as provided by law for the proper discharge of official duty . . . directly or indirectly gives,offers, or promises anything of value to any public official, former public official, or person selected to be a public official, for or because of any official act performed orto be performed by such public official, former public

official, or person selected to be a public official . . . shallbe fined under this title or imprisoned for not more than
two years, or both."
Count One of the indictment charged Sun-Diamond with
giving Espy approximately $5,900 in illegal gratuities:tickets to the 1993 U. S. Open Tennis Tournament (worth

$2,295), luggage ($2,427), meals ($665), and a framed printand crystal bowl ($524). The indictment alluded to two
matters in which respondent had an interest in favorabletreatment from the Secretary at the time it bestowed the
gratuities. First, respondent's member cooperatives participated in the Market Promotion Plan (MPP), a grantprogram administered by the Department of Agriculture

to promote the sale of U. S. farm commodities in foreigncountries. The cooperatives belonged to trade organizations, such as the California Prune Board and the Raisin
Administrative Committee, which submitted overseas marketing plans for their respective commodities. If their plans
were approved by the Secretary of Agriculture, the trade
organizations received funds to be used in defraying the
foreign marketing expenses of their constituents. Each of
respondent's member cooperatives was the largest mem526US2 Unit: $U49 [12-11-00 18:47:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
ber of its respective trade organization, and each receivedsignificant MPP funding. Respondent was understandably

concerned, then, when Congress in 1993 instructed the Sec-retary to promulgate regulations giving small-sized entities preference in obtaining MPP funds. Omnibus BudgetReconciliation Act of 1993, Pub. L. 103-66, $ 1302(b)(2)(A),
107 Stat. 330-331. If the Secretary did not deem respond-ent's member cooperatives to be small-sized entities, there
was a good chance they would no longer receive MPP grants.Thus, respondent had an interest in persuading the Secretary to adopt a regulatory definition of "small-sized entity"that would include its member cooperatives.

Second, respondent had an interest in the Federal Gov-ernment's regulation of methyl bromide, a low-cost pesticide
used by many individual growers in respondent's member co-operatives. In 1992, the Environmental Protection Agency
announced plans to promulgate a rule to phase out the useof methyl bromide in the United States. The indictment
alleged that respondent sought the Department of Agri-culture's assistance in persuading the EPA to abandon its
proposed rule altogether, or at least to mitigate its impact.In the latter event, respondent wanted the Department to
fund research efforts to develop reliable alternatives tomethyl bromide.

Although describing these two matters before the Sec-retary in which respondent had an interest, the indictment
did not allege a specific connection between either of them--or between any other action of the Secretary--and the gratuities conferred. The District Court denied respondent'smotion to dismiss Count One because of this omission. 941
F. Supp. 1262 (DC 1996). The court stated:

"[T]o sustain a charge under the gratuity statute, itis not necessary for the indictment to allege a direct

nexus between the value conferred to Secretary Espyby Sun-Diamond and an official act performed or to be
performed by Secretary Espy. It is sufficient for the

indictment to allege that Sun-Diamond provided thingsof value to Secretary Espy because of his position."

Id., at 1265.
At trial, the District Court instructed the jury along thesesame lines. It read $ 201(c)(1)(A) to the jury twice (along

with the definition of "official act" from $ 201(a)(3)), but thenplaced an expansive gloss on that statutory language, saying,
among other things, that "[i]t is sufficient if Sun-Diamondprovided Espy with unauthorized compensation simply because he held public office," and that "[t]he government neednot prove that the alleged gratuity was linked to a specific
or identifiable official act or any act at all." App. to Pet. forCert. 85a, 87a. The jury convicted respondent on, inter
alia, Count One (the only subject of this appeal), and theDistrict Court sentenced respondent on this count to pay a
fine of $400,000.*The Court of Appeals reversed the conviction on Count
One and remanded for a new trial, stating:

"Given that the `for or because of any official act' lan-guage in $ 201(c)(1)(A) means what it says, the jury instructions invited the jury to convict on materially lessevidence than the statute demands--evidence of gifts
driven simply by Espy's official position." 138 F. 3d961, 968 (CADC 1998).

In rejecting respondent's attack on the indictment, how-ever, the court stated that the Government need not show
that a gratuity was given "for or because of " any particularact or acts: "That an official has an abundance of relevant

of the sentence was concerned, the Court of Appeals remanded for resentencing because the probation included impermissible reporting requirements. 138 F. 3d 961, 977 (CADC 1998). That issue is not before us.

We granted certiorari. 525 U. S. 961 (1998).

Initially, it will be helpful to place $ 201(c)(1)(A) withinthe context of the statutory scheme. Subsection (a) of $ 201

sets forth definitions applicable to the section--including adefinition of "official act," $ 201(a)(3). Subsections (b) and (c)
then set forth, respectively, two separate crimes--or twopairs of crimes, if one counts the giving and receiving of
unlawful gifts as separate crimes--with two different setsof elements and authorized punishments. The first crime,
described in $ 201(b)(1) as to the giver, and $ 201(b)(2) as tothe recipient, is bribery, which requires a showing that something of value was corruptly given, offered, or promised toa public official (as to the giver) or corruptly demanded,
sought, received, accepted, or agreed to be received or ac-cepted by a public official (as to the recipient) with intent,
inter alia, "to influence any official act" (giver) or in returnfor "being influenced in the performance of any official act"
(recipient). The second crime, defined in $ 201(c)(1)(A) asto the giver, and in $ 201(c)(1)(B) as to the recipient, is illegal
gratuity, which requires a showing that something of valuewas given, offered, or promised to a public official (as to the
giver), or demanded, sought, received, accepted, or agreedto be received or accepted by a public official (as to the recipient), "for or because of any official act performed or tobe performed by such public official."

The distinguishing feature of each crime is its intent ele-ment. Bribery requires intent "to influence" an official act
or "to be influenced" in an official act, while illegal gratu-ity requires only that the gratuity be given or accepted
"for or because of " an official act. In other words, for brib-ery there must be a

quid pro quo--a specific intent to giveor receive something of value in exchange for an official

Opinion of the Court
act. An illegal gratuity, on the other hand, may constitutemerely a reward for some future act that the public official

will take (and may already have determined to take), or fora past act that he has already taken. The punishments prescribed for the two offenses reflect their relative seriousness:
Bribery may be punished by up to 15 years' imprisonment,a fine of $250,000 ($500,000 for organizations) or triple the

value of the bribe, whichever is greater, and disqualificationfrom holding government office. See 18 U. S. C. $$ 201(b)
and 3571. Violation of the illegal gratuity statute, on theother hand, may be punished by up to two years' imprisonment and a fine of $250,000 ($500,000 for organizations).
See $$ 201(c) and 3571.

The District Court's instructions in this case, in differentiating between a bribe and an illegal gratuity, correctly
noted that only a bribe requires proof of a quid pro quo.
The point in controversy here is that the instructions went
on to suggest that $ 201(c)(1)(A), unlike the bribery statute,
did not require any connection between respondent's intent
and a specific official act. It would be satisfied, according to
the instructions, merely by a showing that respondent gave
Secretary Espy a gratuity because of his official position--
perhaps, for example, to build a reservoir of goodwill that
might ultimately affect one or more of a multitude of unspecified acts, now and in the future. The United States,
represented by the Independent Counsel, and the Solicitor
General as amicus curiae, contend that this instruction was
correct. The Independent Counsel asserts that "section
201(c)(1)(A) reaches any effort to buy favor or generalized
goodwill from an official who either has been, is, or may at
some unknown, unspecified later time, be in a position to act
favorably to the giver's interests." Brief for United States
22 (emphasis added). The Solicitor General contends that

$ 201(c)(1)(A) requires only a showing that a "gift was motivated, at least in part, by the recipient's capacity to exercise
governmental power or influence in the donor's favor" with526US2 Unit: $U49 [12-11-00 18:47:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
out necessarily showing that it was connected to a particu-lar official act. Brief for United States Dept. of Justice as

Amicus Curiae 17 (emphasis added).In our view, this interpretation does not fit comfortably
with the statutory text, which prohibits only gratuities
given or received "for or because of any official act per-formed or to be performed" (emphasis added). It seems to

us that this means "for or because of some particular officialact of whatever identity"--just as the question "Do you like
any composer?" normally means "Do you like some partic-ular composer?" It is linguistically possible, of course, for
the phrase to mean "for or because of official acts in general, without specification as to which one"--just as the
question "Do you like any composer?" could mean "Do you
like all composers, no matter what their names or music?"
But the former seems to us the more natural meaning, especially given the complex structure of the provision before
us here. Why go through the trouble of requiring that the
gift be made "for or because of any official act performed
or to be performed by such public official," and then defining
"official act" (in $ 201(a)(3)) to mean "any decision or action
on any question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy, which may at any time be pending, or which may by
law be brought before any public official, in such official's
official capacity," when, if the Government's interpretation
were correct, it would have sufficed to say "for or because
of such official's ability to favor the donor in executing the
functions of his office"? The insistence upon an "official
act," carefully defined, seems pregnant with the requirement
that some particular official act be identified and proved.

Besides thinking that this is the more natural meaning of

$ 201(c)(1)(A), we are inclined to believe it correct because
of the peculiar results that the Government's alternative
reading would produce. It would criminalize, for example,
token gifts to the President based on his official position
and not linked to any identifiable act--such as the replica

526US2 Unit: $U49 [12-11-00 18:47:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
jerseys given by championship sports teams each year dur-ing ceremonial White House visits, see,

e. g., Gibson, Masters
of the Game, Lexington Herald-Leader, Nov. 10, 1998, p. A1.Similarly, it would criminalize a high school principal's gift

of a school baseball cap to the Secretary of Education, by
reason of his office, on the occasion of the latter's visit to theschool. That these examples are not fanciful is demonstrated by the fact that counsel for the United States main-tained at oral argument that a group of farmers would violate $ 201(c)(1)(A) by providing a complimentary lunch forthe Secretary of Agriculture in conjunction with his speech
to the farmers concerning various matters of USDA policy--
so long as the Secretary had before him, or had in prospect,
matters affecting the farmers. Tr. of Oral Arg. 26-27. Of
course the Secretary of Agriculture always has before him
or in prospect matters that affect farmers, just as the President always has before him or in prospect matters that affect
college and professional sports, and the Secretary of Education matters that affect high schools.

It might be said in reply to this that the more narrow
interpretation of the statute can also produce some peculiar results. In fact, in the above-given examples, the gifts
could easily be regarded as having been conferred, not only
because of the official's position as President or Secretary,
but also (and perhaps principally) "for or because of " the
official acts of receiving the sports teams at the White House,
visiting the high school, and speaking to the farmers about
USDA policy, respectively. The answer to this objection
is that those actions--while they are assuredly "official acts"
in some sense--are not "official acts" within the meaning
of the statute, which, as we have noted, defines "official act"
to mean "any decision or action on any question, matter,
cause, suit, proceeding or controversy, which may at any
time be pending, or which may by law be brought before
any public official, in such official's official capacity, or in
such official's place of trust or profit." 18 U. S. C. $ 201(a)(3).

408 UNITED STATES v. SUN-DIAMOND GROWERS OF CAL.

Opinion of the Court
Thus, when the violation is linked to a particular "officialact," it is possible to eliminate the absurdities

through the
definition of that term. When, however, no particular "of-ficial act" need be identified, and the giving of gifts by reason of the recipient's mere tenure in office constitutes a violation, nothing but the Government's discretion prevents theforegoing examples from being prosecuted.

The Government insists that its interpretation is theonly one that gives effect to all of the statutory language.
Specifically, it claims that the "official position" constructionis the only way to give effect to $ 201(c)(1)(A)'s forwardlooking prohibition on gratuities to persons who have been
selected to be public officials but have not yet taken office.
Because, it contends, such individuals would not know of
specific matters that would come before them, the only
way to give this provision effect is to interpret "official act"
to mean "official position." But we have no trouble envisioning the application of $ 201(c)(1)(A) to a selectee for federal office under the more narrow interpretation. If, for instance, a large computer company that has planned to merge
with another large computer company makes a gift to a person who has been chosen to be Assistant Attorney General
for the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and
who has publicly indicated his approval of the merger, it
would be quite possible for a jury to find that the gift was
made "for or because of " the person's anticipated decision,
once he is in office, not to challenge the merger. The uncertainty of future action seems to us, in principle, no more an
impediment to prosecution of a selectee with respect to some
future official act than it is to prosecution of an officeholder
with respect to some future official act.

Our refusal to read $ 201(c)(1)(A) as a prohibition of gifts
given by reason of the donee's office is supported by the fact
that when Congress has wanted to adopt such a broadly prophylactic criminal prohibition upon gift giving, it has done
so in a more precise and more administrable fashion. For

Opinion of the Court
example, another provision of Chapter 11 of Title 18, thechapter entitled "Bribery, Graft, and Conflicts of Interest,"

criminalizes the giving or receiving of any "supplementa-tion" of an Executive official's salary, without regard to the
purpose of the payment. See 18 U. S. C. $ 209(a). Other
provisions of the same chapter make it a crime for a bankemployee to give a bank examiner, and for a bank examiner

to receive from a bank employee, "any loan or gratuity,"again without regard to the purpose for which it is given.
See $$ 212-213. A provision of the Labor Management Re-lations Act makes it a felony for an employer to give to a
union representative, and for a union representative to receive from an employer, anything of value. 29 U. S. C. $ 186
(1994 ed. and Supp. III). With clearly framed and easily
administrable provisions such as these on the books imposing gift-giving and gift-receiving prohibitions specifically
based upon the holding of office, it seems to us most implausible that Congress intended the language of the gratuity
statute--"for or because of any official act performed or to
be performed"--to pertain to the office rather than (as the
language more naturally suggests) to particular official acts.

Finally, a narrow, rather than a sweeping, prohibition is
more compatible with the fact that $ 201(c)(1)(A) is merely
one strand of an intricate web of regulations, both administrative and criminal, governing the acceptance of gifts and
other self-enriching actions by public officials. For example,
the provisions following $ 201 in Chapter 11 of Title 18 make
it a crime to give any compensation to a federal employee,
or for the employee to receive compensation, in consideration of his representational assistance to anyone involved in
a proceeding in which the United States has a direct and
substantial interest, $ 203; for a federal employee to act as
"agent or attorney" for anyone prosecuting a claim against
the United States, $ 205(a)(1); for a federal employee to act
as "agent or attorney" for anyone appearing before virtually
any Government tribunal in connection with a matter in

which the United States has a direct and substantial interest,$ 205(a)(2); for various types of federal employees to engage

in various activities after completion of their federal service,$ 207; for an Executive employee to participate in any decision or proceeding relating to a matter in which he has a
financial interest, $ 208; for an employee of the ExecutiveBranch or an independent agency to receive "any contribution to or supplementation of salary . . . from any sourceother than the Government of the United States," $ 209; and
for a federal employee to accept a gift in connection with the"compromise, adjustment, or cancellation of any farm indebtedness," $ 217. A provision of the Internal Revenue Code
makes it criminal for a federal employee to accept a gift for
the "compromise, adjustment, or settlement of any charge
or complaint" for violation of the revenue laws. 26 U. S. C.

$ 7214(a)(9).

And the criminal statutes are merely the tip of the regulatory iceberg. In 5 U. S. C. $ 7353, which announces broadly
that no "employee of the executive, legislative, or judicial
branch shall solicit or accept anything of value from a
person . . . whose interests may be substantially affected
by the performance or nonperformance of the individual's
official duties," $ 7353(a)(2), Congress has authorized the promulgation of ethical rules for each branch of the Federal
Government, $ 7353(b)(1). Pursuant to that provision, each
branch of Government regulates its employees' acceptance
of gratuities in some fashion. See, e. g., 5 CFR $ 2635.202

Opinion of the Court
All of the regulations, and some of the statutes, describedabove contain exceptions for various kinds of gratuities

given by various donors for various purposes. Many ofthose exceptions would be snares for the unwary, given
that there are no exceptions to the broad prohibition that
the Government claims is imposed by $ 201(c)(1). In this re-gard it is interesting to consider the provisions of 5 CFR

$ 2635.202 (1999), issued by the Office of Government Ethics(OGE) and binding on all employees of the Executive Branch
and independent agencies. The first subsection of that pro-vision, entitled "General prohibitions," makes unlawful approximately (if not precisely) what the Government asserts$ 201(c)(1)(B) makes unlawful: acceptance of a gift "[f]rom
a prohibited source" (defined to include any person who
"[h]as interests that may be substantially affected by per-formance or nonperformance of the employee's official duties," 5 CFR $ 2635.203(d)(4) (1999)) or "[g]iven because ofthe employee's official position," $ 2635.202(a)(2). The second subsection, entitled "Relationship to illegal gratuitiesstatute," then provides:

"Unless accepted in violation of paragraph (c)(1) of thissection [banning acceptance of a gift `in return for
being influenced in the performance of an official act'],a gift accepted under the standards set forth in this subpart shall not constitute an illegal gratuity otherwise
prohibited by 18 U. S. C. $ 201(c)(1)(B)." $ 2635.202(b)
(emphasis added).

We are unaware of any law empowering OGE to decriminalize acts prohibited by Title 18 of the United States Code.
Yet it is clear that many gifts "accepted under the standards
set forth in [the relevant] subpart" will violate 18 U. S. C.

$ 201(c)(1)(B) if the interpretation that the Government
urges upon us is accepted. The subpart includes, for example--as $ 201(c)(1)(B) does not--exceptions for gifts of
$20 or less, aggregating no more than $50 from a single

source in a calendar year, see 5 CFR $ 2635.204(a) (1999), and
for certain public-service or achievement awards and honorary degrees, see $ 2635.204(d). We are frankly not sure
that even our more narrow interpretation of 18 U. S. C.

$ 201(c)(1)(B) will cause OGE's assurance of nonviolation if
the regulation is complied with to be entirely accurate; but
the misdirection, if any, will be infinitely less.

More important for present purposes, however, this regulation, and the numerous other regulations and statutes
littering this field, demonstrate that this is an area where
precisely targeted prohibitions are commonplace, and where
more general prohibitions have been qualified by numerous
exceptions. Given that reality, a statute in this field that
can linguistically be interpreted to be either a meat axe or a
scalpel should reasonably be taken to be the latter. Absent
a text that clearly requires it, we ought not expand this one
piece of the regulatory puzzle so dramatically as to make
many other pieces misfits. As discussed earlier, not only
does the text here not require that result; its more natural
reading forbids it.

III

As an alternative means of preserving the jury's verdict on Count One, the Government contends that the District Court's mistaken instruction concerning the scope of

$ 201(c)(1)(A) constituted harmless error. As described earlier, the District Court twice read the text of $$ 201(c)(1)(A)
and 201(a)(3), but it then incorrectly explained the meaning
of that statutory language by essentially substituting the
term "official position" for "official act." More specifically,
the court instructed the jury as follows:

"The essence of the crime is the official's position [as]
the receiver of the payment not whether the official
agrees to do anything in particular, that is, not whether
the official agrees to do any particular official act in return. Therefore . . . to prove that a gratuity offense

Opinion of the Court
has been committed, it is not necessary to show thatthe payment is intended for a particular matter then

pending before the official. It is sufficient if the moti-vating factor for the payment is just to keep the official
happy or to create a better relationship in general withthe official.

. . . . .
"It is sufficient if Sun-Diamond provided Espy with un-authorized compensation simply because he held public

office.. . . . .

"In order for you to convict Sun-Diamond of violatingthe gratuity statute, you must find beyond a reasonable
doubt that Sun-Diamond gave the gifts to Mr. Espy foror because of Mr. Espy's official government position and
not solely for reasons of friendship or social purpose.. . . . .

"With respect to official acts, the government has toprove that Sun-Diamond Growers of California gave
knowingly and willingly Secretary Espy things of valuewhile it had issues before the United States Department
of Agriculture.. . . . .

"Now, the government must prove that the gratuity wasknowingly and willingly given for or because of an official act performed or to be performed by the Secretaryof Agriculture, Michael Espy. That means that the government must prove that Sun-Diamond Growers of Cali-fornia . . . knowingly and willingly gave the gratuities,
at least in part, because of the Secretary's position inappreciation of Sun-Diamond Growers of California's
relationship with him as a public official or in anticipa-tion of the continuation of its relationship with him as a
public official. The government need not prove that thealleged gratuity was linked to a specific or identifiable

official act or any act at all." App. to Pet. for Cert. 84a-86a, 87a-88a.

The Government contends that the jury's verdict renderedpursuant to these instructions necessarily included a finding
that respondent's gratuities were given and received "for orbecause of " an official act or acts. Upon closer examination,
however, this argument is revealed to be nothing more thana restatement of the same flawed premise that permeated
the instructions themselves and that we have just rejected:"By returning a guilty verdict, the jury necessarily rejected
respondent's theory of defense and found beyond a reason-able doubt that the gifts were motivated by the fact that the
Secretary of Agriculture exercised regulatory authority overrespondent's business." Brief for United States 44. The
Court of Appeals tersely rejected this claim of harmlesserror, 138 F. 3d, at 968, and we do the same.

* * *
We hold that, in order to establish a violation of 18 U. S. C.$ 201(c)(1)(A), the Government must prove a link between

a thing of value conferred upon a public official and a spe-cific "official act" for or because of which it was given. We
affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals, which re-manded the case to the District Court for a new trial on
Count One. Our decision today casts doubt upon the lowercourts' resolution of respondent's challenge to the sufficiency
of the indictment on Count One--an issue on which certiorariwas neither sought nor granted. We leave it to the District
Court to determine whether that issue should be reopenedon remand.

It is so ordered.

IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION SERVICE v.AGUIRRE-AGUIRRE
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 97-1754. Argued March 3, 1999--Decided May 3, 1999
The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) permits withholding of deportation to a country when "the Attorney General determines that [an]
alien's life or freedom would be threatened in such country on account
of . . . political opinion." 8 U. S. C. $ 1253(h)(1). In general, withholding is mandatory if an alien establishes that he is more likely than
not to "be subject to persecution on [that ground]," INS v. Stevic, 467
U. S. 407, 429-430. However, as relevant here, it is not available if the
Attorney General finds that the alien committed a "serious nonpolitical
crime" before arriving in the United States, $ 1253(h)(2)(C). Respondent, a Guatemalan, requested, inter alia, withholding of his deportation by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. He testified at
an administrative hearing that, in protesting various government policies and actions in Guatemala, he had burned buses, assaulted passengers, and vandalized and destroyed private property. The Immigration
Judge granted his request, but the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA)
vacated the order, finding that his were "serious nonpolitical crime[s]."
Applying the weighing test it had developed in an earlier decision, the
BIA concluded that the common-law or criminal character of respondent's acts outweighed their political nature. The Ninth Circuit remanded the case, finding the BIA's analysis deficient in three respects:
It should have balanced respondent's admitted offenses against the
threat of persecution; it should have considered whether his acts were
grossly disproportionate to their alleged objective and were atrocious,
especially with reference to Circuit precedent; and it should have considered the political necessity and success of respondent's methods.

Held: In ruling that the BIA must supplement its weighing test by examining these additional factors, the Ninth Circuit failed to accord the
BIA's interpretation the level of deference required under Chevron
U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837.
Pp. 423-433.

(a) Because the Ninth Circuit confronted questions implicating "an
agency's construction of the statute which it administers," that court
should have asked whether "the statute is silent or ambiguous with
respect to the specific issue" before it, and, if so, "whether the agency's

526US2 Unit: $U50 [12-11-00 18:52:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN
416 INS v. AGUIRRE-AGUIRRE

Syllabus
answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute." Chevron,
supra, at 843. It is clear that Chevron deference applies to this statutory scheme. The Attorney General is charged with the INA's administration and enforcement, and $ 1253(h) expressly makes an alien's
entitlement to withholding turn on the Attorney General's determination whether the statutory conditions for withholding have been met.
Judicial deference to the Executive Branch is especially appropriate in
the immigration context. INS v. Abudu, 485 U. S. 94, 110. The BIA,
which is vested with the Attorney General's discretion and authority
in cases before it, should be accorded Chevron deference when it
gives ambiguous statutory terms meaning through a process of caseby-case adjudication. INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U. S. 421, 448-449.
Pp. 423-425.

(b) The Ninth Circuit's error is clearest with respect to its holding
that the BIA must balance respondent's criminal acts against his risk
of persecution in Guatemala. The BIA has rejected any such interpretation, and $ 1253(h)'s text and structure are consistent with that
conclusion. By its terms, the statute requires independent consideration of the persecution risk facing an alien before granting withholding.
It is reasonable to decide, as the BIA has done, that this factor can be
considered on its own and not also as a factor in determining whether
the crime itself is serious and nonpolitical. A United Nations handbook
relied on by the Ninth Circuit is not binding on the Attorney General,
the BIA, or the United States courts. Pp. 425-428.

(c) The Ninth Circuit erred in finding that the BIA should have considered whether respondent's acts were grossly disproportionate to
their alleged objective and atrocious in light of Circuit precedent. The
BIA does not dispute that such considerations may be important in
applying the serious nonpolitical crime exception. However, the BIA's
formulation does not purport to provide a comprehensive definition of
the exception, and the standard's full elaboration should await further
cases. The BIA's test identifies the general standard whether an offense's political aspect outweighs its common-law character and then
provides two specific inquiries that may be used in applying the rule:
whether there is a gross disproportion between means and ends, and
whether the acts are atrocious. Although an offense involving atrocious acts will result in denial of withholding, an offense's criminal
element may outweigh its political aspect even if none of the acts are
atrocious. Thus, the BIA did not need to give express consideration
to atrociousness before determining that respondent had committed
serious nonpolitical crimes. This approach is consistent with the statute, which does not equate every serious nonpolitical crime with atro526US2 Unit: $U50 [12-11-00 18:52:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN

417Cite as: 526 U. S. 415 (1999)
Syllabus
cious acts. Nor is there any reason to find such equivalence. In common usage, "atrocious" suggests a deed more culpable and aggravated
than a serious one. In light of this conclusion, the Court rejects the
Ninth Circuit's suggestion that the BIA was required to compare the
facts of this case with Circuit precedent on atrociousness. Pp. 428-431.

(d) The Ninth Circuit also erred to the extent it believed the BIA
had to give more express consideration to the necessity and success of
respondent's actions than it did. Although the Attorney General has
suggested that a crime will not be deemed political unless it has a causal
link to the alleged political purpose and object, the BIA was required
to do no more than find that respondent's acts were not political based
on the lack of proportion with his objectives. Even with a clear causal
connection, a lack of proportion may render crimes nonpolitical. Moreover, respondent had the burden of proving entitlement to withholding,
yet he failed to submit a brief to the BIA and the Immigration Judge
did not address this point. In these circumstances, the BIA's rather
cursory discussion does not warrant reversal. Pp. 431-432.

(e) The Court does not address respondent's argument, raised at this
late stage, that there are errors in the translation and transcription of
his testimony. Should the BIA determine modification of the record
is necessary, it can decide whether to consider the withholding issue
further. Pp. 432-433.

418 INS v. AGUIRRE-AGUIRRE

Opinion of the Court
Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.
We granted certiorari to consider the analysis employedby the Court of Appeals in setting aside a determination of

the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA). The BIA ruledthat respondent, a native and citizen of Guatemala, was not
entitled to withholding of deportation based on his expressedfear of persecution for earlier political activities in Guatemala. The issue in the case is not whether the persecutionis likely to occur, but whether, even assuming it is, respondent is ineligible for withholding because he "committed aserious nonpolitical crime" before his entry into the United
States. 8 U. S. C. $ 1253(h)(2)(C). The beginning point forthe BIA's analysis was its determination that respondent,
to protest certain governmental policies in Guatemala, had
burned buses, assaulted passengers, and vandalized and de-stroyed property in private shops, after forcing customers

out. These actions, the BIA concluded, were serious non-political crimes. In reaching this conclusion, it relied on a
statutory interpretation adopted in one of its earlier deci-sions,

Matter of McMullen, 19 I. & N. Dec. 90 (BIA 1984),
aff 'd, 788 F. 2d 591 (CA9 1986).On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit

concluded the BIA had applied an incorrect interpretation
of the serious nonpolitical crime provision, and it remandedfor further proceedings. In the Court of Appeals' view, as

we understand it, the BIA erred by misconstruing the con-trolling statute and by employing an analytical framework
insufficient to take account of the Court of Appeals' ownprecedent on this subject. According to the court, the BIA
erred in failing to consider certain factors, including "thepolitical necessity and success of Aguirre's methods";
whether his acts were grossly out of proportion to their objective or were atrocious; and the persecution respondentmight suffer upon return to Guatemala. 121 F. 3d 521, 524

(1997).

Opinion of the Court
We granted certiorari. 525 U. S. 808 (1998). We disagreewith the Court of Appeals and address each of the three

specific areas in which it found the BIA's analysis deficient.We reverse the judgment of the court and remand for further proceedings. I

The statutory provision for withholding of deportationthat is applicable here provides that "[t]he Attorney General
shall not deport or return any alien . . . to a country if theAttorney General determines that such alien's life or freedom would be threatened in such country on account of race,religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group,
or political opinion." 8 U. S. C. $ 1253(h)(1). The provisionwas added to the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 66
Stat. 166, 8 U. S. C. $ 1101 et seq. (1994 ed. and Supp. III), bythe Refugee Act of 1980 (Refugee Act), Pub. L. 96-212,
94 Stat. 102. See INS v. Stevic, 467 U. S. 407, 414-416, 421-422 (1984). As a general rule, withholding is mandatory if
an alien "establish[es] that it is more likely than not that[he] would be subject to persecution on one of the specified
grounds," id., at 429-430, but the statute has some specificexceptions. As is relevant here, withholding does not apply,
and deportation to the place of risk is authorized, "if theAttorney General determines that"

"there are serious reasons for considering that the alienhas committed a serious nonpolitical crime outside the
United States prior to the arrival of the alien in theUnited States." 8 U. S. C. $ 1253(h)(2)(C).

Under the immigration laws, withholding is distinct fromasylum, although the two forms of relief serve similar purposes. Whereas withholding only bars deporting an aliento a particular country or countries, a grant of asylum permits an alien to remain in the United States and to apply forpermanent residency after one year. See

INS v. Cardoza526US2 Unit: $U50 [12-11-00 18:52:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN
420 INS v. AGUIRRE-AGUIRRE

Opinion of the Court
Fonseca, 480 U. S. 421, 428-429, n. 6 (1987). In addition,
whereas withholding is mandatory unless the Attorney General determines one of the exceptions applies, the decision
whether asylum should be granted to an eligible alien is
committed to the Attorney General's discretion. Ibid. As
a consequence, under the law then in force, respondent
was able to seek asylum irrespective of his eligibility for
withholding.

As an incidental point, we note that in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996
(IIRIRA), Pub. L. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-546, Congress
revised the withholding and asylum provisions. The withholding provisions are now codified at 8 U. S. C. $ 1231(b)(3)
(1994 ed., Supp. III), and the asylum provisions at $ 1158.
Under current law, as enacted by IIRIRA, the Attorney
General may not grant asylum if she determines "there
are serious reasons for believing that the alien has committed a serious nonpolitical crime outside the United
States prior to the arrival of the alien in the United States."

$ 1158(b)(2)(A)(iii). The parties agree IIRIRA does not govern respondent's case. See IIRIRA, Tit. III-A, $$ 309(a),
(c), 110 Stat. 3009-625; IIRIRA, Div. C, Tit. VI-A, $ 604(c),
110 Stat. 3009-692. Prior to IIRIRA, in the Antiterrorism
and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), Pub. L.
104-132, Tit. IV-B, $ 413(f), 110 Stat. 1269, Congress granted
the Attorney General discretion to withhold deportation
when necessary to ensure compliance with the international
treaty upon which the Refugee Act was based, see infra,
at 427-429. This provision was made applicable to "applications filed before, on, or after" April 24, 1996, "if final action has not been taken on them before such date." AEDPA

$ 413(g), 110 Stat. 1269-1270. The BIA's decision constituted final action when rendered on March 5, 1996, 8 CFR

$ 243.1 (1995), App. to Pet. for Cert. 12a, so AEDPA $ 413(f)
was not applicable to respondent's case.

Opinion of the Court
We turn to the matter before us. In 1994, respondent wascharged with deportability by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) for illegal entry into the UnitedStates. Respondent conceded deportability but applied for
asylum and withholding. At a hearing before an Immigration Judge respondent testified, through an interpreter, thathe had been politically active in Guatemala from 1989 to 1992

with a student group called Estudeante Syndicado (ES)and with the National Central Union political party. App.
19-20, 36-37. He testified about threats due to his politi-cal activity. The threats, he believed, were from different
quarters, including the Guatemalan Government, right-wing
government support groups, and left-wing guerillas. App.
to Pet. for Cert. 23a.

Respondent described activities he and other ES members
engaged in to protest various government policies and actions, including the high cost of bus fares and the government's failure to investigate the disappearance or murder
of students and others. App. 20-21; App. to Pet. for Cert.
22a-23a. For purposes of our review, we assume that the
amount of bus fares is an important political and social issue
in Guatemala. We are advised that bus fare represents a
significant portion of many Guatemalans' annual living expense, and a rise in fares may impose substantial economic
hardship. See Brief for Massachusetts Law Reform Institute et al. as Amicus Curiae 18-19. In addition, government involvement with fare increases, and other aspects
of the transportation system, has been a focus of political
discontent in that country. Id., at 16-21.

According to the official hearing record, respondent testified that he and his fellow members would "strike" by
"burning buses, breaking windows or just attacking the
police, police cars." App. 20. Respondent estimated that
he participated in setting about 10 buses on fire, after dousing them with gasoline. Id., at 46. Before setting fire to
the buses, he and his group would order passengers to leave

422 INS v. AGUIRRE-AGUIRRE

Opinion of the Court
the bus. Passengers who refused were stoned, hit withsticks, or bound with ropes.

Id., at 46-47. In addition, respondent testified that he and his group "would break thewindows of . . . stores," "t[ake] the people out of the stores

that were there," and "throw everything on the floor." Id.,
at 48.The Immigration Judge granted respondent's applications

for withholding of deportation and for asylum, finding a like-lihood of persecution for his political opinions and activities
if he was returned to Guatemala. App. to Pet. for Cert.31a-32a. The INS appealed to the BIA. Respondent did
not file a brief with the BIA, although his request for an
extension of time to do so was granted. Brief for Petitioner
10, n. 6; Record 13-15. The BIA sustained the INS's appeal
from this decision, vacated the Immigration Judge's order,
and ordered respondent deported. App. to Pet. for Cert.
18a. With respect to withholding, the BIA did not decide
whether respondent had established the requisite risk of
persecution because it determined that, in any event, he had
committed a serious nonpolitical crime within the meaning
of $ 1253(h)(2)(C).

In addressing the definition of a serious nonpolitical crime,
the BIA applied the interpretation it first set forth in Matter
of McMullen, 19 I. & N. Dec., at 97-98: "In evaluating the
political nature of a crime, we consider it important that
the political aspect of the offense outweigh its common-law
character. This would not be the case if the crime is grossly
out of proportion to the political objective or if it involves
acts of an atrocious nature." In the instant case, the BIA
found, "the criminal nature of the respondent's acts outweigh
their political nature." App. to Pet. for Cert. 18a. The BIA
acknowledged respondent's dissatisfaction with the Guatemalan Government's "seeming inaction in the investigation
of student deaths and in its raising of student bus fares."
Ibid. It said, however: "The ire of the ES manifested itself disproportionately in the destruction of property and

526US2 Unit: $U50 [12-11-00 18:52:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN

423Cite as: 526 U. S. 415 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
assaults on civilians. Although the ES had a politicalagenda, those goals were outweighed by their criminal strategy of strikes . . . ." Ibid. The BIA further concluded re-spondent should not be granted discretionary asylum relief
in light of "the nature of his acts against innocent Guate-malans."

Id., at 17a.A divided panel of the Court of Appeals granted respondent's petition for review and remanded to the BIA.121 F. 3d 521 (CA9 1997). According to the majority, the
BIA's analysis of the serious nonpolitical crime exceptionwas legally deficient in three respects. First, the BIA
should have "consider[ed] the persecution that Aguirremight suffer if returned to Guatemala" and "balance[d] his
admitted offenses against the danger to him of death." Id.,at 524. Second, it should have "considered whether the acts
committed were grossly out of proportion to the[ir] allegedobjective" and were "of an atrocious nature," especially with
reference to Ninth Circuit precedent in this area. Ibid.(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Third, the
BIA "should have considered the political necessity andsuccess of Aguirre's methods." Id., at 523-524.

Judge Kleinfeld dissented. In his view, "[t]he BIA cor-rectly identified the legal question, whether `the criminal
nature of the respondent's acts outweigh their political na-ture.' " Id., at 524 (quoting McMullen v. INS, 788 F. 2d 591,
592 (CA9 1986)). Given the violent nature of respondent'sacts, and the fact the acts were in large part directed against
innocent civilians, the BIA "reasonably conclude[d] that [his]crimes were disproportionate to his political objectives."
121 F. 3d, at 525. II

As an initial matter, the Court of Appeals expressed nodisagreement with the Attorney General or the BIA that the
phrase "serious nonpolitical crime" in $ 1253(h)(2)(C) shouldbe applied by weighing "the political nature" of an act
against its "common-law" or "criminal" character. See Mat526US2 Unit: $U50 [12-11-00 18:52:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Deportation Proceedings for Doherty, 13 Op. Off. Legal
Counsel 1, 23 (1989) (an act " `should be considered a seriousnonpolitical crime if the act is disproportionate to the objective' ") (quoting McMullen v. INS, supra, at 595), rev'd on
other grounds, Doherty v. INS, 908 F. 2d 1108 (CA2 1990),rev'd, 502 U. S. 314 (1992). Nor does respondent take issue

with this basic inquiry.The Court of Appeals did conclude, however, that the
BIA must supplement this weighing test by examining ad-ditional factors. In the course of its analysis, the Court
of Appeals failed to accord the required level of deference
to the interpretation of the serious nonpolitical crime exception adopted by the Attorney General and BIA. Because
the Court of Appeals confronted questions implicating "an
agency's construction of the statute which it administers,"
the court should have applied the principles of deference
described in Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842 (1984). Thus, the
court should have asked whether "the statute is silent or
ambiguous with respect to the specific issue" before it; if so,
"the question for the court [was] whether the agency's answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute."
Id., at 843. See also INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U. S., at
448-449.

It is clear that principles of Chevron deference are applicable to this statutory scheme. The INA provides that "[t]he
Attorney General shall be charged with the administration and enforcement" of the statute and that the "determination and ruling by the Attorney General with respect
to all questions of law shall be controlling." 8 U. S. C.

met. 8 U. S. C. $$ 1253(h)(1), (2). In addition, we have rec-ognized that judicial deference to the Executive Branch is

especially appropriate in the immigration context whereofficials "exercise especially sensitive political functions that
implicate questions of foreign relations." INS v. Abudu, 485U. S. 94, 110 (1988). A decision by the Attorney General to
deem certain violent offenses committed in another countryas political in nature, and to allow the perpetrators to remain
in the United States, may affect our relations with that coun-try or its neighbors. The judiciary is not well positioned to
shoulder primary responsibility for assessing the likelihoodand importance of such diplomatic repercussions.

The Attorney General, while retaining ultimate author-ity, has vested the BIA with power to exercise the "discretion and authority conferred upon the Attorney General bylaw" in the course of "considering and determining cases before it." 8 CFR $ 3.1(d)(1) (1998). Based on this allocationof authority, we recognized in Cardoza-Fonseca, supra, that
the BIA should be accorded Chevron deference as it givesambiguous statutory terms "concrete meaning through a
process of case-by-case adjudication" (though we ultimatelyconcluded that the agency's interpretation in that case was
not sustainable). 480 U. S., at 448-449. In the case beforeus, by failing to follow

Chevron principles in its review ofthe BIA, the Court of Appeals erred.

A
The Court of Appeals' error is clearest with respect toits holding that the BIA was required to balance respondent's criminal acts against the risk of persecution he wouldface if returned to Guatemala. In

Matter of Rodriguez-Coto, 19 I. & N. Dec. 208, 209-210 (1985), the BIA "reject[ed]

any interpretation of the phras[e] . . . `serious nonpoliticalcrime' in [$ 1253(h)(2)(C)] which would vary with the nature of evidence of persecution." The text and structureof $ 1253(h) are consistent with this conclusion. Indeed, its

426 INS v. AGUIRRE-AGUIRRE

Opinion of the Court
words suggest that the BIA's reading of the statute, notthe interpretation adopted by the Court of Appeals, is the

more appropriate one. As a matter of plain language, it isnot obvious that an already-completed crime is somehow
rendered less serious by considering the further circumstance that the alien may be subject to persecution if re-turned to his home country. See

ibid. ("We find that the
modifie[r] . . . `serious' . . . relate[s] only to the nature of thecrime itself ").

It is important, too, as Rodriguez-Coto points out, id.,at 209-210, that for aliens to be eligible for withholding at
all, the statute requires a finding that their "life or freedom would be threatened in [the country to which deportation is sought] on account of their race, religion, nationality,
membership in a particular social group, or political opinion,"
i. e., that the alien is at risk of persecution in that country.
8 U. S. C. $ 1253(h)(1). By its terms, the statute thus requires independent consideration of the risk of persecution
facing the alien before granting withholding. It is reasonable to decide, as the BIA has done, that this factor can be
considered on its own and not also as a factor in determining
whether the crime itself is a serious, nonpolitical crime.
Though the BIA in the instant case declined to make findings
respecting the risk of persecution facing respondent, App. to
Pet. for Cert. 18a, this was because it determined respondent
was barred from withholding under the serious nonpolitical
crime exception. Ibid. The BIA, in effect, found respondent ineligible for withholding even on the assumption he
could establish a threat of persecution. This approach is
consistent with the language and purposes of the statute.

In reaching the contrary conclusion and ruling that the
risk of persecution should be balanced against the alien's
criminal acts, the Court of Appeals relied on a passage from
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees, Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status (Geneva, 1979) (U. N. Handbook).

Opinion of the Court
We agree the U. N. Handbook provides some guidance inconstruing the provisions added to the INA by the Refugee

Act. INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U. S., at 438-439, andn. 22. As we explained in

Cardoza-Fonseca, "one of Congress' primary purposes" in passing the Refugee Act was to
implement the principles agreed to in the 1967 United Na-tions Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, Jan. 31,

1967, 19 U. S. T. 6224, T. I. A. S. No. 6577 (1968), to which theUnited States acceded in 1968. 480 U. S., at 436-437. The
Protocol incorporates by reference Articles 2 through 34of the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of
Refugees, 189 U. N. T. S. 150 (July 28, 1951), reprinted in
19 U. S. T., at 6259, 6264-6276. The basic withholding provision of $ 1253(h)(1) parallels Article 33, which provides that
"[n]o Contracting State shall expel or return (`refouler') a
refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on
account of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a
particular social group or political opinion." Id., at 6276.
The Convention, in a part incorporated by the Protocol, also
places certain limits on the availability of this form of relief;
as pertinent here, the Convention states that its provisions
"shall not apply to any person with respect to whom there
are serious reasons for considering that . . . he has committed
a serious non-political crime outside the country of refuge
prior to his admission to that country as a refugee." Convention Art. I(F)(b), 19 U. S. T., at 6263-6264. Paragraph
156 of the U. N. Handbook, the portion relied upon by the
Court of Appeals, states that in applying the serious nonpolitical crime provision of Convention Art. I(F)(b), "it is . . .
necessary to strike a balance between the nature of the
offence presumed to have been committed by the applicant
and the degree of persecution feared . . . ."

The U. N. Handbook may be a useful interpretative aid,
but it is not binding on the Attorney General, the BIA, or
United States courts. "Indeed, the Handbook itself dis526US2 Unit: $U50 [12-11-00 18:52:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
claims such force, explaining that `the determination of refu-gee status under the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol

. . . is incumbent upon the Contracting State in whose terri-tory the refugee finds himself.' " INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca,
480 U. S., at 439, n. 22 (quoting U. N. Handbook || (ii), at 1).See also 480 U. S., at 439, n. 22 ("We do not suggest, of
course, that the explanation in the U. N. Handbook has theforce of law or in any way binds the INS . . ."). For the
reasons given, supra, at 425-426, we think the BIA'sdetermination that $ 1253(h)(2)(C) requires no additional balancing of the risk of persecution rests on a fair and permissi-ble reading of the statute. See also

T. v. Secretary of State
for the Home Dept., 2 All E. R. 865, 882 (H. L. 1996) (LordMustill) ("[T]he crime either is or is not political when committed, and its character cannot depend on the consequenceswhich the offender may afterwards suffer if he is returned").

B
Also relying on the U. N. Handbook, the Court of Appealsheld that the BIA "should have considered whether the acts

committed were `grossly out of proportion to the alleged ob-jective.' . . . The political nature of the offenses would be
`more difficult to accept' if they involved `acts of an atrociousnature.' " 121 F. 3d, at 524 (quoting U. N. Handbook || 152,
at 36). The court further suggested that the BIA shouldhave considered prior Circuit case law that "cast[s] light on
what under the law are acts of [an] atrocious nature." 121F. 3d, at 524. Citing its own opinion affirming the BIA's
decision in Matter of McMullen, see McMullen v. INS, 788F. 2d 591 (CA9 1986), the Court of Appeals stated that "[a]
comparison of what the McMullen court found atrociouswith the acts committed by Aguirre suggests a startling degree of difference." 121 F. 3d, at 524. It reasoned thatwhile McMullen had involved "indiscriminate bombing, murder, torture, [and] the maiming of innocent civilians," re-spondent's "only acts against innocent Guatemalans were

Opinion of the Court
the disruption of some stores and his use of methods thatwe would all find objectionable if practiced upon us on a

bus in the United States but which fall far short of the kindof atrocities attributed to McMullen and his associates."
121 F. 3d, at 524.

We do not understand the BIA to dispute that theseconsiderations--gross disproportionality, atrociousness, and

comparisons with previous decided cases--may be importantin applying the serious nonpolitical crime exception. In
fact, by the terms of the BIA's test (which is similar tothe language quoted by the Court of Appeals from the U. N.
Handbook), gross disproportion and atrociousness are relevant in the determination. According to the BIA: "In evaluating the political nature of a crime, we consider it important that the political aspect of the offense outweigh
its common-law character. This would not be the case if
the crime is grossly out of proportion to the political objective or if it involves acts of an atrocious nature." Matter
of McMullen, 19 I. & N. Dec., at 97-98. See also Deportation Proceedings for Doherty, 13 Op. Off. Legal Counsel,
at 22-26, rev'd on other grounds, Doherty v. INS, 908 F. 2d
1108 (CA2 1990), rev'd, 502 U. S. 314 (1992). The BIA's
formulation does not purport to provide a comprehensive
definition of the $ 1253(h)(2)(C) exception, and the full elaboration of that standard should await further cases, consistent
with the instruction our legal system always takes from considering discrete factual circumstances over time. See also
13 Op. Off. Legal Counsel, at 23 ("[T]he statute recognizes
that cases involving alleged political crimes arise in myriad
circumstances, and that what constitutes a `serious nonpolitical crime' is not susceptible of rigid definition"). Our decision takes into account that the BIA's test identifies a general standard (whether the political aspect of an offense
outweighs its common-law character) and then provides two
more specific inquiries that may be used in applying the rule:
whether there is a gross disproportion between means and

526US2 Unit: $U50 [12-11-00 18:52:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN
430 INS v. AGUIRRE-AGUIRRE

Opinion of the Court
ends, and whether atrocious acts are involved. Under this
approach, atrocious acts provide a clear indication that an
alien's offense is a serious nonpolitical crime. In the BIA's
judgment, where an alien has sought to advance his agenda
by atrocious means, the political aspect of his offense may
not fairly be said to predominate over its criminal character.
Commission of the acts, therefore, will result in a denial of
withholding. The criminal element of an offense may outweigh its political aspect even if none of the acts are deemed
atrocious, however. For this reason, the BIA need not give
express consideration to the atrociousness of the alien's acts
in every case before determining that an alien has committed
a serious nonpolitical crime.

The BIA's approach is consistent with the statute, which
does not equate every serious nonpolitical crime with atrocious acts. Cf. 8 U. S. C. $ 1253(h)(2)(B) (establishing an exception to withholding for a dangerous alien who has been
convicted of a "particularly serious crime," defined to include
an "aggravated felony"). Nor is there any reason to find this
equivalence under the statute. In common usage, the word
"atrocious" suggests a deed more culpable and aggravated
than a serious one. See Webster's Third New International
Dictionary 139 (1971) (defining "atrocious" as, "marked by
or given to extreme wickedness . . . [or] extreme brutality
or cruelty"; "outrageous: violating the bounds of common
decency"; "marked by extreme violence: savagely fierce:
murderous"; "utterly revolting: abominable"). As a practical matter, if atrocious acts were deemed a necessary element of all serious nonpolitical crimes, the Attorney General would have severe restrictions upon her power to
deport aliens who had engaged in serious, though not atrocious, forms of criminal activity. These restrictions cannot
be discerned in the text of $ 1253(h), and the Attorney General and BIA are not bound to impose the restrictions on
themselves.

431Cite as: 526 U. S. 415 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
In the instant case, the BIA determined that "the crimi-nal nature of the respondent's acts outweigh their political

nature" because his group's political dissatisfaction "mani-fested itself disproportionately in the destruction of property and assaults on civilians" and its political goals "wereoutweighed by [the group's] criminal strategy of strikes."
App. to Pet. for Cert. 18a. The BIA concluded respondenthad committed serious nonpolitical crimes by applying the
general standard established in its prior decision, so it hadno need to consider whether his acts might also have been
atrocious. The Court of Appeals erred in holding otherwise.We further reject the Court of Appeals' suggestion that
reversal was required due to the BIA's failure to comparethe facts of this case with those of McMullen. The court
thought doing so was necessary because of the guidanceprovided by McMullen on the meaning of atrociousness.
In light of our holding that the BIA was not required ex-pressly to consider the atrociousness of respondent's acts,
the BIA's silence on this point does not provide a groundfor reversal.

C
The third reason given by the Court of Appeals for re-versing the BIA was what the court deemed to be the

BIA's failure to consider respondent's "offenses in relationto [his] declared political objectives" and to consider "the
political necessity and success of [his] methods." 121 F. 3d,at 523-524. As we have discussed,

supra, at 422-423 and
this page, the BIA did address the relationship between re-spondent's political goals and his criminal acts, concluding

that the violence and destructiveness of the crimes, and their
impact on civilians, were disproportionate to his acknowl-edged political objectives. To the extent the court believed

the BIA was required to give more express considerationto the "necessity" and "success" of respondent's actions, it
erred.

432 INS v. AGUIRRE-AGUIRRE

Opinion of the Court
It is true the Attorney General has suggested that a crimewill not be deemed political unless there is a " `close and direct causal link between the crime committed and its allegedpolitical purpose and object.' " Deportation Proceedings for
Doherty, 13 Op. Off. Legal Counsel, at 23 (quoting McMullenv.

INS, 788 F. 2d 591 (CA9 1986)). The BIA's analysis, whichwas quite brief in all events, did not explore this causal link

beyond noting the general disproportion between respond-ent's acts and his political objectives. Whatever independent relevance a causal link inquiry might have in anothercase, in this case the BIA determined respondent's acts were
not political based on the lack of proportion with his objec-tives. It was not required to do more. Even in a case with
a clear causal connection, a lack of proportion between meansand ends may still render a crime nonpolitical. Moreover,
it was respondent who bore the burden of proving entitle-ment to withholding, see 8 CFR $ 208.16(c)(3) (1995) ("If the
evidence indicates that one or more of the grounds for denialof withholding of deportation . . . apply, the applicant shall
have the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evi-dence that such grounds do not apply"). He failed to submit
a brief on the causal link or any other issue to the BIA, andthe decision of the Immigration Judge does not address the
point. In these circumstances, the rather cursory nature ofthe BIA's discussion does not warrant reversal.

III
Finally, respondent contends the record of his testimonybefore the Immigration Judge contains errors. He testified

in Spanish and now contends there are errors in translationand transcription. Brief for Respondent 11-22. Respondent advanced this argument for the first time in his Brief inOpposition to Certiorari in this Court, see Brief in Opposition 1-5, having failed to raise it before either the BIA orthe Court of Appeals. We decline to address the argument
at this late stage.

Opinion of the Court
Respondent has filed a motion in the BIA for a new hear-ing in light of the alleged errors. App. to Brief for Respondent 1a-6a. Should the BIA determine modification ofthe record is necessary, it can determine whether further

BANK OF AMERICA NATIONAL TRUST AND SAV-INGS ASSOCIATION

v. 203 NORTH LaSALLESTREET PARTNERSHIP

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe seventh circuit

No. 97-1418. Argued November 2, 1998--Decided May 3, 1999
A loan by petitioner Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association (Bank) to respondent 203 North LaSalle Street Partnership
(Debtor) was secured by a mortgage on the Debtor's interest in a Chicago office building, the value of which was less than the balance due
the Bank. After the Debtor defaulted and the Bank began state-court
foreclosure, the Debtor filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U. S. C. $ 1101 et seq. The Debtor
proposed a reorganization plan under which, inter alia, certain of its
former partners would contribute new capital in exchange for the Debtor's entire ownership of the reorganized entity. That condition was an
exclusive eligibility provision: the old equity holders were the only ones
who could contribute new capital. The Bank objected and, as sole
member of an impaired class of creditors, thereby blocked confirmation
of the plan on a consensual basis. See $ 1129(a)(8). The Debtor, however, resorted to the alternate, judicial "cramdown" process for imposing a plan on a dissenting class. $ 1129(b). Among the conditions for
a cramdown is the requirement that the plan be "fair and equitable"
with respect to each class of impaired unsecured claims that has not
accepted it. $ 1129(b)(1). A plan may be found to be fair and equitable
if "the holder of any claim . . . junior to the claims of such class will not
receive or retain under the plan on account of such junior claim . . . any
property." $ 1129(b)(2)(B)(ii). Under this "absolute priority rule," the
Bank argued, the plan could not be confirmed as a cramdown because
the Debtor's old equity holders would receive property even though the
Bank's unsecured deficiency claim would not be paid in full. The Bankruptcy Court approved the plan nonetheless, and the District Court and
the Court of Appeals affirmed. The Seventh Circuit found ambiguity
in the absolute priority rule's language, and interpreted the phrase
"on account of" to permit recognition of a "new value corollary" to the
rule, under which the objection of an impaired senior class does not bar
junior claim holders from receiving or retaining property interests in
the debtor after reorganization, if they contribute new capital in money
or money's worth, reasonably equivalent to the property's value, and

Syllabus
necessary for successful reorganization of the restructured enterprise.
The court held that when an old equity holder retains an equity interest
in the reorganized debtor by meeting the corollary's requirements, he is
not receiving or retaining that interest "on account of" his prior equitable ownership, but, rather, "on account of" a new, substantial, necessary,
and fair infusion of capital.

Held: A debtor's prebankruptcy equity holders may not, over the objection of a senior class of impaired creditors, contribute new capital and
receive ownership interests in the reorganized entity, when that opportunity is given exclusively to the old equity holders under a plan
adopted without consideration of alternatives. The old equity holders are disqualified from participating in such a "new value" transaction
by $ 1129(b)(2)(B)(ii), which in these circumstances bars a junior interest holder's receipt of any property on account of his prior interest.
Pp. 444-458.

(a) The Court does not decide whether the statute includes a new
value corollary or exception. The drafting history is equivocal, but
does nothing to disparage the possibility apparent in the statutory text,
that $ 1129(b)(2)(B)(ii) may carry such a corollary. Although there is
no literal reference to "new value" in the phrase "on account of such
junior claim," the phrase could arguably carry such an implication in
modifying the prohibition against receipt by junior claimants of any interest under a plan while a senior class of unconsenting creditors goes
less than fully paid. Pp. 444-449.

(b) The Court adopts as the better reading of the "on account of"
modifier the more common understanding that the phrase means "because of," since this is the usage meant for the phrase at other places in
the statute, see Cohen v. de la Cruz, 523 U. S. 213, 219-220. Thus,
a causal relationship between holding the prior claim or interest and
receiving or retaining property is what activates the absolute priority
rule. As to the degree of causation that will disqualify a plan, the
Government argues not only that any degree of causation between
earlier interests and retained property will activate the bar to a plan
providing for later property, but also that whenever the holders of
equity in the Debtor end up with some property there will be some
causation. A less absolute statutory prohibition would follow from
reading the "on account of" language as intended to reconcile the two
recognized policies underlying Chapter 11, of preserving going concerns and maximizing property available to satisfy creditors, see Toibb
v. Radloff, 501 U. S. 157, 163. Causation between the old equity's holdings and subsequent property substantial enough to disqualify a plan
would presumably occur on this view whenever old equity's later prop526US2 Unit: $U51 [12-11-00 19:20:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN

erty would come at a price that failed to provide the greatest possible
addition to the bankruptcy estate, i. e., whenever the equity holders obtained or preserved an ownership interest for less than someone else
would have paid. Pp. 449-451.

(c) Assuming a new value corollary, plans providing junior interest
holders with exclusive opportunities free from competition and without
benefit of market valuation fall within $ 1129(b)(2)(B)(ii)'s prohibition.
In this case, the proposed plan is doomed by its provision for vesting
equity in the reorganized business in the Debtor's partners without
extending an opportunity to anyone else either to compete for that
equity or to propose a competing reorganization plan. The exclusiveness of the opportunity, with its protection against the market's
scrutiny of the stated purchase price, renders the partners' right a
property interest extended "on account of" the old equity position and
therefore subject to an unpaid senior creditor class's objection. Under
a plan granting old equity on exclusive right, any determination that
the purchase price was top dollar would necessarily be made by the
bankruptcy judge, whereas the best way to determine value is exposure
to a market. In the interest of statutory coherence, the Bankruptcy
Code's disfavor for decisions untested by competitive choice ought to
extend to valuations in administering $ 1129(b)(2)(B)(ii) when some form
of market valuation may be available to test the adequacy of an old
equity holder's proposed contribution. Pp. 454-458.

an Illinois real estate limited partnership.2 The Bank lent
the Debtor some $93 million, secured by a nonrecourse first
mortgage 3 on the Debtor's principal asset, 15 floors of an
office building in downtown Chicago. In January 1995, the
Debtor defaulted, and the Bank began foreclosure in a state
court.

In March, the Debtor responded with a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11

of America, Illinois v. 203 N. LaSalle Street Partnership,

objective was to ensure that its partners retained title to
the property so as to avoid roughly $20 million in personal
tax liabilities, which would fall due if the Bank foreclosed.

its equity holders.

3 A nonrecourse loan requires the Bank to look only to the Debtor's

collateral for payment. But see n. 6, infra.

4 The Debtor filed an initial plan on April 13, 1995, and amended it on

May 12, 1995. The Bank objected, and the Bankruptcy Court rejected
the plan on the ground that it was not feasible. See $ 1129(a)(11). The
Debtor submitted a new plan on September 11, 1995. In re 203 N. LaSalle, 126 F. 3d 955, 958-959 (CA7 1997).

Opinion of the Court
liquidate the property, and instead extended the exclusivity
period for cause shown, under $ 1121(d).5

The value of the mortgaged property was less than the
balance due the Bank, which elected to divide its undersecured claim into secured and unsecured deficiency claims
under $ 506(a) and $ 1111(b).6 126 F. 3d, at 958. Under the
plan, the Debtor separately classified the Bank's secured
claim, its unsecured deficiency claim, and unsecured trade
debt owed to other creditors. See $ 1122(a).7 The Bankruptcy Court found that the Debtor's available assets were
prepetition rents in a cash account of $3.1 million and the 15
floors of rental property worth $54.5 million. The secured
claim was valued at the latter figure, leaving the Bank with
an unsecured deficiency of $38.5 million.

So far as we need be concerned here, the Debtor's plan
had these further features:

5 The Bank neither appealed the denial nor raised it as an issue in this
appeal.

6 Having agreed to waive recourse against any property of the Debtor

other than the real estate, the Bank had no unsecured claim outside of
Chapter 11. Section 1111(b), however, provides that nonrecourse secured
creditors who are undersecured must be treated in Chapter 11 as if they
had recourse.

7 Indeed, the Seventh Circuit apparently requires separate classification

of the deficiency claim of an undersecured creditor from other general
unsecured claims. See In re Woodbrook Associates, 19 F. 3d 312, 319
(1994). Nonetheless, the Bank argued that if its deficiency claim had
been included in the class of general unsecured creditors, its vote against
confirmation would have resulted in the plan's rejection by that class.
The Bankruptcy Court and the District Court rejected the contention that
the classifications were gerrymandered to obtain requisite approval by a
single class, In re 203 N. LaSalle Street Limited Partnership, 190 B. R.
567, 592-593 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ND Ill. 1995); Bank of America, Illinois v. 203
N. LaSalle Street Partnership, 195 B. R. 692, 705 (ND Ill. 1996), and the
Court of Appeals agreed, 126 F. 3d, at 968. The Bank sought no review
of that issue, which is thus not before us.

203 NORTH LaSALLE STREET PARTNERSHIP

Opinion of the Court

(1) The Bank's $54.5 million secured claim would be paid
in full between 7 and 10 years after the original 1995
repayment date.8

(2) The Bank's $38.5 million unsecured deficiency claim
would be discharged for an estimated 16% of its present value.9

(3) The remaining unsecured claims of $90,000, held by
the outside trade creditors, would be paid in full, without interest, on the effective date of the plan.10

(4) Certain former partners of the Debtor would contribute $6.125 million in new capital over the course
of five years (the contribution being worth some $4.1
million in present value), in exchange for the Partnership's entire ownership of the reorganized debtor.

The last condition was an exclusive eligibility provision: the
old equity holders were the only ones who could contribute
new capital.11

The Bank objected and, being the sole member of an impaired class of creditors, thereby blocked confirmation of the

8 Payment consisted of a prompt cash payment of $1,149,500 and a secured, 7-year note, extendable at the Debtor's option. 126 F. 3d, at 959,
n. 4; 195 B. R., at 698.

9 This expected yield was based upon the Bankruptcy Court's projection

that a sale or refinancing of the property on the 10th anniversary of the
plan confirmation would produce a $19-million distribution to the Bank.

10 The Debtor originally owed $160,000 in unsecured trade debt. After

filing for bankruptcy, the general partners purchased some of the trade
claims. Upon confirmation, the insiders would waive all general unsecured claims they held. 126 F. 3d, at 958, n. 2; 195 B. R., at 698.

11 The plan eliminated the interests of noncontributing partners. More

than 60% of the Partnership interests would change hands on confirmation
of the plan. See Brief for Respondent 4, n. 7. The new Partnership,
however, would consist solely of former partners, a feature critical to the
preservation of the Partnership's tax shelter. Tr. of Oral Arg. 32.

Opinion of the Court
plan on a consensual basis. See $ 1129(a)(8).12 The Debtor,however, took the alternate route to confirmation of a reorganization plan, forthrightly known as the judicial "cram-down" process for imposing a plan on a dissenting class.

$ 1129(b). See generally Klee, All You Ever Wanted to
Know About Cram Down Under the New Bankruptcy Code,53 Am. Bankr. L. J. 133 (1979).

There are two conditions for a cramdown. First, all re-quirements of $ 1129(a) must be met (save for the plan's
acceptance by each impaired class of claims or interests,see $ 1129(a)(8)). Critical among them are the conditions
that the plan be accepted by at least one class of impairedcreditors, see $ 1129(a)(10), and satisfy the "best-interest-ofcreditors" test, see $ 1129(a)(7).13 Here, the class of tradecreditors with impaired unsecured claims voted for the
plan,14 126 F. 3d, at 959, and there was no issue of bestinterest. Second, the objection of an impaired creditor class
may be overridden only if "the plan does not discriminate
unfairly, and is fair and equitable, with respect to each classof claims or interests that is impaired under, and has not

accepted, the plan." $ 1129(b)(1). As to a dissenting classof impaired unsecured creditors, such a plan may be found to
be "fair and equitable" only if the allowed value of the claimis to be paid in full, $ 1129(b)(2)(B)(i), or, in the alternative,

12 A class of creditors accepts if a majority of the creditors and those
holding two-thirds of the total dollar amount of the claims within that
class vote to approve the plan. $ 1126(c).

13 Section 1129(a)(7) provides that if the holder of a claim impaired under

a plan of reorganization has not accepted the plan, then such holder must
"receive . . . on account of such claim . . . property of a value, as of the
effective date of the plan, that is not less than the amount that such holder
would so receive . . . if the debtor were liquidated under chapter 7 . . . on
such date." The "best interests" test applies to individual creditors holding impaired claims, even if the class as a whole votes to accept the plan.

14 Claims are unimpaired if they retain all of their prepetition legal, equitable, and contractual rights against the debtor. $ 1124.

Opinion of the Court

if "the holder of any claim or interest that is junior to the
claims of such [impaired unsecured] class will not receive
or retain under the plan on account of such junior claim or
interest any property," $ 1129(b)(2)(B)(ii). That latter condition is the core of what is known as the "absolute priority
rule."

The absolute priority rule was the basis for the Bank's
position that the plan could not be confirmed as a cramdown. As the Bank read the rule, the plan was open to
objection simply because certain old equity holders in the
Debtor Partnership would receive property even though the
Bank's unsecured deficiency claim would not be paid in full.
The Bankruptcy Court approved the plan nonetheless, and
accordingly denied the Bank's pending motion to convert
the case to Chapter 7 liquidation, or to dismiss the case.
The District Court affirmed, 195 B. R. 692 (ND Ill. 1996), as
did the Court of Appeals.

The majority of the Seventh Circuit's divided panel found
ambiguity in the language of the statutory absolute priority
rule, and looked beyond the text to interpret the phrase
"on account of " as permitting recognition of a "new value
corollary" to the rule. 126 F. 3d, at 964-965. According to
the panel, the corollary, as stated by this Court in Case v.
Los Angeles Lumber Products Co., 308 U. S. 106, 118 (1939),
provides that the objection of an impaired senior class does
not bar junior claim holders from receiving or retaining property interests in the debtor after reorganization, if they contribute new capital in money or money's worth, reasonably
equivalent to the property's value, and necessary for successful reorganization of the restructured enterprise. The panel
majority held that

"when an old equity holder retains an equity interest in
the reorganized debtor by meeting the requirements of
the new value corollary, he is not receiving or retaining
that interest `on account of ' his prior equitable owner526US2 Unit: $U51 [12-11-00 19:20:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
ship of the debtor. Rather, he is allowed to participatein the reorganized entity `on account of ' a new, substantial, necessary and fair infusion of capital." 126 F. 3d,at 964.

In the dissent's contrary view, there is nothing ambiguousabout the text: the "plain language of the absolute priority
rule . . . does not include a new value exception." Id., at970 (opinion of Kanne, J.). Since "[t]he Plan in this case
gives [the Debtor's] partners the exclusive right to retaintheir ownership interest in the indebted property

becauseof their status as . . . prior interest holder[s]," id., at 973,

the dissent would have reversed confirmation of the plan.We granted certiorari, 523 U. S. 1106 (1998), to resolve a
Circuit split on the issue. The Seventh Circuit in this casejoined the Ninth in relying on a new value corollary to the
absolute priority rule to support confirmation of such plans.See

In re Bonner Mall Partnership, 2 F. 3d 899, 910-916(CA9 1993), cert. granted, 510 U. S. 1039, vacatur denied and

appeal dism'd as moot, 513 U. S. 18 (1994). The Second andFourth Circuits, by contrast, without explicitly rejecting the
corollary, have disapproved plans similar to this one. SeeIn re Coltex Loop Central Three Partners, L. P., 138 F. 3d
39, 44-45 (CA2 1998); In re Bryson Properties, XVIII, 961F. 2d 496, 504 (CA4), cert. denied, 506 U. S. 866 (1992).

15 We

do not decide whether the statute includes a new value corol-lary or exception, but hold that on any reading respondent's

proposed plan fails to satisfy the statute, and accordinglyreverse.

15 All four of these cases arose in the single-asset real estate context,
the typical one in which new value plans are proposed. See 7 Collier on
Bankruptcy || 1129.04[4][c][ii][B], p. 1129-113 (rev. 15th ed. 1998). See

203 NORTH LaSALLE STREET PARTNERSHIP

Opinion of the Court

II
The terms "absolute priority rule" and "new value corol-lary" (or "exception") are creatures of law antedating the

current Bankruptcy Code, and to understand both thoseterms and the related but inexact language of the Code some
history is helpful. The Bankruptcy Act preceding the Codecontained no such provision as subsection (b)(2)(B)(ii), its
subject having been addressed by two interpretive rules.The first was a specific gloss on the requirement of $ 77B
(and its successor, Chapter X) of the old Act, that any reorga-nization plan be "fair and equitable." 11 U. S. C. $ 205(e)
(1934 ed., Supp. I) (repealed 1938) ($ 77B); 11 U. S. C. $ 621(2)(1934 ed., Supp. IV) (repealed 1979) (Chapter X). The reason for such a limitation was the danger inherent in any re-organization plan proposed by a debtor, then and now, that
the plan will simply turn out to be too good a deal for thedebtor's owners. See H. R. Doc. No. 93-137, pt. I, p. 255
(1973) (discussing concern with "the ability of a few insiders,whether representatives of management or major creditors,
to use the reorganization process to gain an unfair advan-tage");

ibid. ("[I]t was believed that creditors, because ofmanagement's position of dominance, were not able to bargain effectively without a clear standard of fairness andjudicial control"); Ayer, Rethinking Absolute Priority After
Ahlers, 87 Mich. L. Rev. 963, 969-973 (1989). Hence thepre-Code judicial response known as the absolute priority
rule, that fairness and equity required that "the creditors . . .
be paid before the stockholders could retain [equity interests]for any purpose whatever."

Northern Pacific R. Co. v.
Boyd, 228 U. S. 482, 508 (1913). See also Louisville Trust
Co. v. Louisville, N. A. & C. R. Co., 174 U. S. 674, 684 (1899)(reciting "the familiar rule that the stockholder's interest

in the property is subordinate to the rights of creditors; firstof secured and then of unsecured creditors," and concluding
that "any arrangement of the parties by which the subordi526US2 Unit: $U51 [12-11-00 19:20:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
nate rights and interests of the stockholders are attempted
to be secured at the expense of the prior rights of either
class of creditors comes within judicial denunciation").

The second interpretive rule addressed the first. Its
classic formulation occurred in Case v. Los Angeles Lumber
Products Co., in which the Court spoke through Justice
Douglas in this dictum:

"It is, of course, clear that there are circumstances
under which stockholders may participate in a plan of
reorganization of an insolvent debtor. . . . Where th[e]
necessity [for new capital] exists and the old stockholders make a fresh contribution and receive in return
a participation reasonably equivalent to their contribution, no objection can be made. . . .

"[W]e believe that to accord `the creditor his full right
of priority against the corporate assets' where the
debtor is insolvent, the stockholder's participation
must be based on a contribution in money or in money's
worth, reasonably equivalent in view of all the circumstances to the participation of the stockholder." 308
U. S., at 121-122.

Although counsel for one of the parties here has described
the Case observation as " `black-letter' principle," Brief for
Respondent 38, it never rose above the technical level of dictum in any opinion of this Court, which last addressed it in
Norwest Bank Worthington v. Ahlers, 485 U. S. 197 (1988),
holding that a contribution of " `labor, experience, and expertise' " by a junior interest holder was not in the " `money's
worth' " that the Case observation required. 485 U. S., at
203-205. See also Marine Harbor Properties, Inc. v. Manufacturers Trust Co., 317 U. S. 78, 85 (1942); Consolidated
Rock Products Co. v. Du Bois, 312 U. S. 510, 529, n. 27 (1941).

Opinion of the Court

did any court rely on the Case dictum to approve a plan
that gave old equity a property right after reorganization.
See Ayer, supra, at 1016; Markell, Owners, Auctions, and
Absolute Priority in Bankruptcy Reorganizations, 44 Stan.
L. Rev. 69, 92 (1991). Hence the controversy over how
weighty the Case dictum had become, as reflected in the
alternative labels for the new value notion: some writers
and courts (including this one, see Ahlers, supra, at 203-204,
n. 3) have spoken of it as an exception to the absolute priority rule, see, e. g., In re Potter Material Service, Inc., 781
F. 2d 99, 101 (CA7 1986); Miller, Bankruptcy's New Value
Exception: No Longer a Necessity, 77 B. U. L. Rev. 975
(1997); Georgakopoulos, New Value, Fresh Start, 3 Stan. J. L.
Bus. & Fin. 125 (1997), while others have characterized it as
a simple corollary to the rule, see, e. g., In re Bonner Mall
Partnership, 2 F. 3d, at 906; Ayer, supra, at 999.

Enactment of the Bankruptcy Code in place of the prior
Act might have resolved the status of new value by a provision bearing its name or at least unmistakably couched in
its terms, but the Congress chose not to avail itself of that
opportunity. In 1973, Congress had considered proposals by
the Bankruptcy Commission that included a recommendation
to make the absolute priority rule more supple by allowing
nonmonetary new value contributions. H. R. Doc. No. 93-
137, pt. I, at 258-259; id., pt. II, at 242, 252. Although Congress took no action on any of the ensuing bills containing
language that would have enacted such an expanded new
value concept,16 each of them was reintroduced in the next

congressional session. See H. R. 31, 94th Cong., 1st Sess.,

No. 95-595, p. 3 (1977). It had no explicit new value lan-guage, expansive or otherwise, but did codify the absolute
priority rule in nearly its present form. See H. R. 8200,

interests, and the additional estimated value of such contribution."

18 Section 7-310(d)(2)(B) read: "Subject to the provisions of section 7-303

(3) and (4) and the court's making any findings required thereby, there is
a reasonable basis for the valuation on which the plan is based and the
plan is fair and equitable in that there is a reasonable probability that the
securities issued and other consideration distributed under the plan will
fully compensate the respective classes of creditors and equity security
holders of the debtor for their respective interests in the debtor or his
property."

19 Section 1129(b) of H. R. 6 read, in relevant part: "[T]he court, on request of the proponent of such plan, shall confirm such plan . . . if such
plan is fair and equitable with respect to all classes except any class that
has accepted the plan and that is comprised of claims or interests on account of which the holders of such claims or interests will receive or retain

plan that is fair and equitable with respect to all classes."

Opinion of the Court

the plan on account of such junior claims or interests anyproperty").

20

For the purpose of plumbing the meaning of subsection(b)(2)(B)(ii) in search of a possible statutory new value exception, the lesson of this drafting history is equivocal.Although hornbook law has it that " `Congress does not intend sub silentio to enact statutory language that it hasearlier discarded,' "

INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U. S. 421,442-443 (1987), the phrase "on account of " is not silentium,

and the language passed by in this instance had never beenin the bill finally enacted, but only in predecessors that died
on the vine. None of these contained an explicit codifica-tion of the absolute priority rule,

21 and even in these earlier

bills the language in question stated an expansive new valueconcept, not the rule as limited in the

Case dictum.22
The equivocal note of this drafting history is amplifiedby another feature of the legislative advance toward the

current law. Any argument from drafting history has to
account for the fact that the Code does not codify any au-thoritative pre-Code version of the absolute priority rule.

Compare $ 1129(b)(2)(B)(ii) ("[T]he holder of any claim orinterest that is junior to the claims of such [impaired unsecured] class will not receive or retain under the plan onaccount of such junior claim or interest any property") with
Boyd, 228 U. S., at 508 ("[T]he creditors were entitled tobe paid before the stockholders could retain [a right of
property] for any purpose whatever"), and Case, 308 U. S.,
at 116 (" `[C]reditors are entitled to priority over stock-holders against all the property of an insolvent corporation' "

(quoting Kansas City Terminal R. Co. v. Central Union

20 While the earlier proposed bills contained provisions requiring as a
condition of confirmation that a plan be "fair and equitable," none of them
contained language explicitly codifying the absolute priority rule. See,

Trust Co. of N. Y., 271 U. S. 445, 455 (1926))). See H. R. Rep.No. 95-595, at 414 (characterizing $ 1129(b)(2)(B)(ii) as a

"partial codification of the absolute priority rule"); ibid.("The elements of the [fair and equitable] test are new[,]
departing from both the absolute priority rule and thebest interests of creditors tests found under the Bankruptcy Act").The upshot is that this history does nothing to disparage
the possibility apparent in the statutory text, that the abso-lute priority rule now on the books as subsection (b)(2)(B)(ii)
may carry a new value corollary. Although there is no lit-eral reference to "new value" in the phrase "on account of
such junior claim," the phrase could arguably carry such animplication in modifying the prohibition against receipt by
junior claimants of any interest under a plan while a seniorclass of unconsenting creditors goes less than fully paid.

III
Three basic interpretations have been suggested for the"on account of " modifier. The first reading is proposed by

the Partnership, that "on account of " harks back to account-ing practice and means something like "in exchange for," or
"in satisfaction of," Brief for Respondent 12-13, 15, n. 16.On this view, a plan would not violate the absolute priority
rule unless the old equity holders received or retained prop-erty in exchange for the prior interest, without any significant new contribution; if substantial money passed fromthem as part of the deal, the prohibition of subsection
(b)(2)(B)(ii) would not stand in the way, and whatever issuesof fairness and equity there might otherwise be would not
implicate the "on account of " modifier.This position is beset with troubles, the first one being
textual. Subsection (b)(2)(B)(ii) forbids not only receipt ofproperty on account of the prior interest but its retention
as well. See also $$ 1129(a)(7)(A)(ii), (a)(7)(B), (b)(2)(B)(i),(b)(2)(C)(i), (b)(2)(C)(ii). A common instance of the latter

450 BANK OF AMERICA NAT. TRUST AND SAV. ASSN. v.

203 NORTH LaSALLE STREET PARTNERSHIP

Opinion of the Court

would be a debtor's retention of an interest in the insolventbusiness reorganized under the plan. Yet it would be exceedingly odd to speak of "retain[ing]" property in exchangefor the same property interest, and the eccentricity of such
a reading is underscored by the fact that elsewhere in the
Code the drafters chose to use the very phrase "in ex-change for," $ 1123(a)(5)(J) (a plan shall provide adequate

means for implementation, including "issuance of securitiesof the debtor . . . for cash, for property, for existing securities, or in exchange for claims or interests"). It is unlikelythat the drafters of legislation so long and minutely contemplated as the 1978 Bankruptcy Code would have used two
distinctly different forms of words for the same purpose.
See Russello v. United States, 464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983).

The second difficulty is practical: the unlikelihood that
Congress meant to impose a condition as manipulable as
subsection (b)(2)(B)(ii) would be if "on account of " meant to
prohibit merely an exchange unaccompanied by a substantial infusion of new funds but permit one whenever substantial funds changed hands. "Substantial" or "significant"
or "considerable" or like characterizations of a monetary contribution would measure it by the Lord Chancellor's foot,
and an absolute priority rule so variable would not be much
of an absolute. Of course it is true (as already noted) that,
even if old equity holders could displace the rule by adding
some significant amount of cash to the deal, it would not
follow that their plan would be entitled to adoption; a contested plan would still need to satisfy the overriding condition of fairness and equity. But that general fairness and
equity criterion would apply in any event, and one comes
back to the question why Congress would have bothered to
add a separate priority rule without a sharper edge.

Since the "in exchange for" reading merits rejection, the
way is open to recognize the more common understanding
of "on account of " to mean "because of." This is certainly
the usage meant for the phrase at other places in the stat526US2 Unit: $U51 [12-11-00 19:20:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ute, see $ 1111(b)(1)(A) (treating certain claims as if theholder of the claim "had recourse against the debtor on account of such claim"); $ 522(d)(10)(E) (permitting debtors toexempt payments under certain benefit plans and contracts
"on account of illness, disability, death, age, or length ofservice"); $ 547(b)(2) (authorizing trustee to avoid a transfer of an interest of the debtor in property "for or on accountof an antecedent debt owed by the debtor"); $ 547(c)(4)(B)
(barring trustee from avoiding a transfer when a creditorgives new value to the debtor "on account of which new
value the debtor did not make an otherwise unavoidable
transfer to . . . such creditor"). So, under the commonsense
rule that a given phrase is meant to carry a given concept ina single statute, see

Cohen v. de la Cruz, 523 U. S. 213, 219-
220 (1998), the better reading of subsection (b)(2)(B)(ii) rec-ognizes that a causal relationship between holding the prior

claim or interest and receiving or retaining property is whatactivates the absolute priority rule.

The degree of causation is the final bone of contention.We understand the Government, as

amicus curiae, to take
the starchy position not only that any degree of causation
between earlier interests and retained property will acti-vate the bar to a plan providing for later property, Brief for

United States as Amicus Curiae 11-15, but also that when-ever the holders of equity in the Debtor end up with some
property there will be some causation; when old equity, andnot someone on the street, gets property the reason is

res
ipsa loquitur. An old equity holder simply cannot takeproperty under a plan if creditors are not paid in full.

203 NORTH LaSALLE STREET PARTNERSHIP

Opinion of the Court

There are, however, reasons counting against such a read-ing. If, as is likely, the drafters were treating junior claimants or interest holders as a class at this point (see Ahlers,485 U. S., at 202),

24 then the simple way to have prohibited

the old interest holders from receiving anything over objection would have been to omit the "on account of " phrase
entirely from subsection (b)(2)(B)(ii). On this assumption,
reading the provision as a blanket prohibition would leave
"on account of " as a redundancy, contrary to the interpretive obligation to try to give meaning to all the statutory
language. See, e. g., Moskal v. United States, 498 U. S. 103,
109-110 (1990); United States v. Menasche, 348 U. S. 528,
538-539 (1955).25 One would also have to ask why Congress

Bancorp Mortgage Co. v. Bonner Mall Partnership, O. T. 1993, No. 93-
714, p. 14.

The Government conceded that, in the case before us, it had no need to
press this more stringent view, since "whatever [the] definition of `on account of,' a 100 percent certainty that junior equit[y] obtains property
because they're junior equity will satisfy that." See Tr. of Oral Arg. 29
(internal quotation marks added).

24 It is possible, on the contrary, to argue on the basis of the immediate

text that the prohibition against receipt of an interest "on account of" a
prior unsecured claim or interest was meant to indicate only that there is
no per se bar to such receipt by a creditor holding both a senior secured
claim and a junior unsecured one, when the senior secured claim accounts
for the subsequent interest. This reading would of course eliminate the
phrase "on account of" as an express source of a new value exception, but
would leave open the possibility of interpreting the absolute priority rule
itself as stopping short of prohibiting a new value transaction.

25 Given our obligation to give meaning to the "on account of" modifier,

we likewise do not rely on various statements in the House Report or by
the bill's floor leaders, which, when read out of context, imply that Congress intended an emphatic, unconditional absolute priority rule. See,
e. g., H. R. Rep. No. 95-595, p. 224 (1977) ("[T]he bill requires that the plan
pay any dissenting class in full before any class junior to the dissenter
may be paid at all"); id., at 413 ("[I]f [an impaired class is] paid less than
in full, then no class junior may receive anything under the plan"); 124

Opinion of the Court
would have desired to exclude prior equity categorically
from the class of potential owners following a cramdown.
Although we have some doubt about the Court of Appeals's
assumption (see 126 F. 3d, at 966, and n. 12) that prior equity
is often the only source of significant capital for reorganizations, see, e. g., Blum & Kaplan, The Absolute Priority
Doctrine in Corporate Reorganizations, 41 U. Chi. L. Rev.
651, 672 (1974); Mann, Strategy and Force in the Liquidation of Secured Debt, 96 Mich. L. Rev. 159, 182-183, 192-
194, 208-209 (1997), old equity may well be in the best position to make a go of the reorganized enterprise and so may
be the party most likely to work out an equity-for-value
reorganization.

A less absolute statutory prohibition would follow from
reading the "on account of " language as intended to reconcile
the two recognized policies underlying Chapter 11, of preserving going concerns and maximizing property available
to satisfy creditors, see Toibb v. Radloff, 501 U. S. 157, 163
(1991). Causation between the old equity's holdings and
subsequent property substantial enough to disqualify a plan
would presumably occur on this view of things whenever
old equity's later property would come at a price that failed
to provide the greatest possible addition to the bankruptcy
estate, and it would always come at a price too low when the
equity holders obtained or preserved an ownership interest
for less than someone else would have paid.26 A truly full

firmable only "as long as no class junior to the dissenting class receives
anything at all"); id., at 34007 (statement of Sen. DeConcini) (same).

26 Even when old equity would pay its top dollar and that figure was

as high as anyone else would pay, the price might still be too low unless
the old equity holders paid more than anyone else would pay, on the
theory that the "necessity" required to justify old equity's participation in
a new value plan is a necessity for the participation of old equity as such.
On this interpretation, disproof of a bargain would not satisfy old equity's
burden; it would need to show that no one else would pay as much. See,

value transaction, on the other hand, would pose no threatto the bankruptcy estate not posed by any reorganization,

provided of course that the contribution be in cash or berealizable money's worth, just as Ahlers required for application of Case's new value rule. Cf. Ahlers, supra, at 203-205;
Case, 308 U. S., at 121. IV

Which of these positions is ultimately entitled to prevailis not to be decided here, however, for even on the latter
view the Bank's objection would require rejection of theplan at issue in this case. It is doomed, we can say without
necessarily exhausting its flaws, by its provision for vestingequity in the reorganized business in the Debtor's partners
without extending an opportunity to anyone else either tocompete for that equity or to propose a competing reorganization plan. Although the Debtor's exclusive opportunity topropose a plan under $ 1121(b) is not itself "property" within
the meaning of subsection (b)(2)(B)(ii), the respondent part-nership in this case has taken advantage of this opportunity
by proposing a plan under which the benefit of equity own-ership may be obtained by no one but old equity partners.
Upon the court's approval of that plan, the partners werein the same position that they would have enjoyed had
they exercised an exclusive option under the plan to buy theequity in the reorganized entity, or contracted to purchase it
from a seller who had first agreed to deal with no one else.It is quite true that the escrow of the partners' proposed
investment eliminated any formal need to set out an express

111 Banking L. J., at 243 (old equity must show that the reorganized entity
"needs funds from the prior owner-managers because no other source of
capital is available"). No such issue is before us, and we emphasize that
our holding here does not suggest an exhaustive list of the requirements
of a proposed new value plan.

Opinion of the Court
option or exclusive dealing provision in the plan itself, sincethe court's approval that created the opportunity and the

partners' action to obtain its advantage were simultaneous.But before the Debtor's plan was accepted no one else could
propose an alternative one, and after its acceptance no one
else could obtain equity in the reorganized entity. At themoment of the plan's approval the Debtor's partners necessarily enjoyed an exclusive opportunity that was in no eco-nomic sense distinguishable from the advantage of the exclusively entitled offeror or option holder. This opportunityshould, first of all, be treated as an item of property in its
own right. Cf. In re Coltex Loop Central Three Partners,
L. P., 138 F. 3d, at 43 (exclusive right to purchase postpetition equity is itself property); In re Bryson Properties,
XVIII, 961 F. 2d, at 504; Kham & Nate's Shoes No. 2, Inc. v.
First Bank, 908 F. 2d 1351, 1360 (CA7 1990); D. Baird, The
Elements of Bankruptcy 261 (rev. ed. 1993) ("The right to
get an equity interest for its fair market value is `property'
as the word is ordinarily used. Options to acquire an interest in a firm, even at its market value, trade for a positive
price"). While it may be argued that the opportunity has
no market value, being significant only to old equity holders
owing to their potential tax liability, such an argument avails
the Debtor nothing, for several reasons. It is to avoid just
such arguments that the law is settled that any otherwise
cognizable property interest must be treated as sufficiently
valuable to be recognized under the Bankruptcy Code. See
Ahlers, 485 U. S., at 207-208. Even aside from that rule,
the assumption that no one but the Debtor's partners might
pay for such an opportunity would obviously support no inference that it is valueless, let alone that it should not be
treated as property. And, finally, the source in the tax law
of the opportunity's value to the partners implies in no way
that it lacks value to others. It might, indeed, be valuable
to another precisely as a way to keep the Debtor from implementing a plan that would avoid a Chapter 7 liquidation.

456 BANK OF AMERICA NAT. TRUST AND SAV. ASSN. v.

203 NORTH LaSALLE STREET PARTNERSHIP

Opinion of the Court

Given that the opportunity is property of some value,the question arises why old equity alone should obtain it,

not to mention at no cost whatever. The closest thing to ananswer favorable to the Debtor is that the old equity partners would be given the opportunity in the expectation that
in taking advantage of it they would add the stated purchaseprice to the estate. See Brief for Respondent 40-41. But

this just begs the question why the opportunity should beexclusive to the old equity holders. If the price to be paid
for the equity interest is the best obtainable, old equity doesnot need the protection of exclusiveness (unless to trump
an equal offer from someone else); if it is not the best, thereis no apparent reason for giving old equity a bargain. There
is no reason, that is, unless the very purpose of the whole
transaction is, at least in part, to do old equity a favor. Andthat, of course, is to say that old equity would obtain its

opportunity, and the resulting benefit, because of old equity'sprior interest within the meaning of subsection (b)(2)(B)(ii).
Hence it is that the exclusiveness of the opportunity, with itsprotection against the market's scrutiny of the purchase
price by means of competing bids or even competing planproposals, renders the partners' right a property interest extended "on account of " the old equity position and therefore
subject to an unpaid senior creditor class's objection.

It is no answer to this to say that the exclusive opportunity should be treated merely as a detail of the broader
transaction that would follow its exercise, and that in this
wider perspective no favoritism may be inferred, since the
old equity partners would pay something, whereas no one
else would pay anything. If this argument were to carry
the day, of course, old equity could obtain a new property
interest for a dime without being seen to receive anything
on account of its old position. But even if we assume that
old equity's plan would not be confirmed without satisfying
the judge that the purchase price was top dollar, there is a
further reason here not to treat property consisting of an
exclusive opportunity as subsumed within the total trans526US2 Unit: $U51 [12-11-00 19:20:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
action proposed. On the interpretation assumed here, itwould, of course, be a fatal flaw if old equity acquired or

retained the property interest without paying full value. Itwould thus be necessary for old equity to demonstrate its
payment of top dollar, but this it could not satisfactorily dowhen it would receive or retain its property under a plan
giving it exclusive rights and in the absence of a competingplan of any sort.

27 Under a plan granting an exclusive right,

making no provision for competing bids or competing plans,any determination that the price was top dollar would necessarily be made by a judge in bankruptcy court, whereasthe best way to determine value is exposure to a market.

Whether a market test would require an opportunity to

we do not decide here. It is enough to say, assuming a new

Our precedents make clear that an analysis of any statute,including the Bankruptcy Code, must not begin with external sources, but with the text itself. See, e. g., ConnecticutNat. Bank v. Germain, 503 U. S. 249, 253-254 (1992); Union
Bank v. Wolas, 502 U. S. 151, 154 (1991). The relevant Codeprovision in this case, 11 U. S. C. $ 1129(b), does not expressly
authorize prepetition equity holders to receive or retainproperty in a reorganized entity in exchange for an infusion
of new capital.1 Instead, it is cast in general terms and re-quires that, to be confirmed over the objections of an impaired class of creditors, a reorganization plan be "fair andequitable." $ 1129(b)(1). With respect to an impaired class
of unsecured creditors, a plan can be fair and equitable onlyif, at a minimum, it "provides that each holder of a claim of
such class receive or retain on account of such claim prop-erty of a value, as of the effective date of the plan, equal to
the allowed amount of such claim," $ 1129(b)(2)(B)(i), or if"the holder of any claim or interest that is junior to the
claims of such class will not receive or retain under the planon account of such junior claim or interest any property,"

$ 1129(b)(2)(B)(ii).Neither condition is met here. The bank did not receive
property under the reorganization plan equal to the amount ofits unsecured deficiency claim. See ante, at 439-440. Therefore, the plan could not satisfy the first condition. With re-spect to the second condition, the prepetition equity holders

received at least two forms of property under the plan: theexclusive opportunity to obtain equity, ante, at 454-458, and

an equity interest in the reorganized entity. The plan couldnot be confirmed if the prepetition equity holders received
any of this property "on account of " their junior interest.The meaning of the phrase "on account of " is the central
interpretive question presented by this case. This phraseobviously denotes some type of causal relationship between
the junior interest and the property received or retained--such an interpretation comports with common understandings of the phrase. See, e. g., Random House Dictionary ofthe English Language 13 (2d ed. 1987) ("by reason of," "because of "); Webster's Third New International Dictionary 13(1976) ("for the sake of," "by reason of," "because of "). It
also tracks the use of the phrase elsewhere in the Code.See, e. g., 11 U. S. C. $$ 365(f )(3), 510(b), 1111(b)(1)(A); see
generally $ 1129. Regardless of how direct the causal nexusmust be, the prepetition equity holders here undoubtedly
received at least one form of property--the exclusive oppor-tunity--"on account of " their prepetition equity interest.
Ante, at 454. Since $ 1129(b)(2)(B)(ii) prohibits the prepeti-tion equity holders from receiving "any" property under the
plan on account of their junior interest, this plan was not"fair and equitable" and could not be confirmed. That conclusion, as the majority recognizes, ibid., is sufficient to re-solve this case. Thus, its comments on the Government's
position taken in another case, ante, at 451-454, and its spec-ulations about the desirability of a "market test," ante, at
457-458, are dicta binding neither this Court nor the lowerfederal courts.

ante, at 444-449, but fails to explain the relevance of thesesources to the interpretive question apart from the conclu526US2 Unit: $U51 [12-11-00 19:20:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN

sory assertion that the Code's language is "inexact" and thehistory is "helpful,"

ante, at 444. This sort of approach to
interpretation of the Bankruptcy Code repeats a method-ological error committed by this Court in

Dewsnup v. Timm,
502 U. S. 410 (1992).

In Dewsnup, the Court held, based on pre-Code practice,that $ 506(d) of the Code prevented a Chapter 7 debtor from

stripping down a creditor's lien on real property to the judi-cially determined value of the collateral.

Id., at 419-420.
The Court justified its reliance on such practice by findingthe provision ambiguous.

Id., at 416. Section 506 was ambiguous, in the Court's view, simply because the litigants and
amici had offered competing interpretations of the statute.
Ibid. This is a remarkable and untenable methodology for
interpreting any statute. If litigants' differing positions
demonstrate statutory ambiguity, it is hard to imagine how
any provision of the Code--or any other statute--would escape Dewsnup's broad sweep. A mere disagreement among
litigants over the meaning of a statute does not prove ambiguity; it usually means that one of the litigants is simply
wrong. Dewsnup's approach to statutory interpretation enables litigants to undermine the Code by creating "ambiguous" statutory language and then cramming into the Code
any good idea that can be garnered from pre-Code practice
or legislative history.

The risks of relying on such practice in interpreting the
Bankruptcy Code, which seeks to bring an entire area of law
under a single, coherent statutory umbrella, are especially
weighty. As we previously have recognized, the Code "was
intended to modernize the bankruptcy laws, and as a result
made significant changes in both the substantive and procedural laws of bankruptcy." United States v. Ron Pair Enterprises, Inc., 489 U. S. 235, 240 (1989) (citation omitted).
The Code's overall scheme often reflects substantial departures from various pre-Code practices. Most relevant to
this case, the Code created a system of creditor class ap526US2 Unit: $U51 [12-11-00 19:20:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN

proval of reorganization plans, unlike early pre-Code prac-tice where plan confirmation depended on unanimous creditor approval and could be hijacked by a single holdout. SeeD. Baird, The Elements of Bankruptcy 262 (rev. ed. 1993).
Hence it makes little sense to graft onto the Code conceptsthat were developed during a quite different era of bankruptcy practice.Even assuming the relevance of pre-Code practice in those
rare instances when the Code is truly ambiguous, see, e. g.,
Midlantic Nat. Bank v. New Jersey Dept. of EnvironmentalProtection, 474 U. S. 494, 501 (1986), and assuming that the

language here is ambiguous, surely the sparse history behindthe new value exception cannot inform the interpretation of

$ 1129(b)(2)(B)(ii). No holding of this Court ever embracedthe new value exception. As noted by the majority,

ante, at445, the leading decision suggesting this possibility, Case v.

Los Angeles Lumber Products Co., 308 U. S. 106 (1939), didso in dictum. And, prior to the Code's enactment, no court
ever relied on the Case dictum to approve a plan. Given itsquestionable pedigree prior to the Code's enactment, a concept developed in dictum and employed by lower federalcourts only

after the Code's enactment is simply not relevantto interpreting this provision of the Code.

This danger inherent in excessive reliance on pre-Codepractice did not escape the notice of the dissenting Justices

in Dewsnup who expressed "the greatest sympathy for theCourts of Appeals who must predict which manner of statu2 Nor do I think that the history of rejected legislative proposals bears
on the proper interpretation of the phrase "on account of." As an initial
matter, such history is irrelevant for the simple reason that Congress
enacted the Code, not the legislative history predating it. See United
States v. Estate of Romani, 523 U. S. 517, 535-537 (1998) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). Even if this history had
some relevance, it would not support the view that Congress intended to
insert a new value exception into the phrase "on account of." On the
contrary, Congress never acted on bills that would have allowed nonmonetary new value contributions. Ante, at 446-447.

to their participation.1 As we have on two prior occa-sions,

2 we granted certiorari in this case to decide whether

11 U. S. C. $ 1129(b)(2)(B)(ii) of the 1978 Act preserved or re-pealed this "new value" component of the absolute priority

rule. I believe the Court should now definitively resolve the
question and state that a holder of a junior claim or interest
does not receive property "on account of " such a claim when
its participation in the plan is based on adequate new value.

The Court today wisely re jects the Government's
"starchy" position that an old equity holder can never receive
an interest in a reorganized venture as a result of a cramdown unless the creditors are first paid in full. Ante, at
451.3 Nevertheless, I find the Court's objections to the plan

1 As Justice Douglas explained in Case v. Los Angeles Lumber Products
Co., 308 U. S. 106, 121-122 (1939) (footnote omitted):

"It is, of course, clear that there are circumstances under which stockholders may participate in a plan of reorganization of an insolvent debtor.
This Court, as we have seen, indicated as much in Northern Pacific Ry.
Co. v. Boyd[, 228 U. S. 482 (1913),] and Kansas City Terminal Ry. Co. v.
Central Union Trust Co.[, 271 U. S. 445 (1926)]. Especially in the latter
case did this Court stress the necessity, at times, of seeking new money
`essential to the success of the undertaking' from the old stockholders.
Where that necessity exists and the old stockholders make a fresh contribution and receive in return a participation reasonably equivalent to their
contribution, no objection can be made. . . .

"In view of these considerations we believe that to accord `the creditor
his full right of priority against the corporate assets' where the debtor is
insolvent, the stockholder's participation must be based on a contribution
in money or in money's worth, reasonably equivalent in view of all the
circumstances to the participation of the stockholder."

(1988); U. S. Bancorp Mortgage Co. v. Bonner Mall Partnership, 513 U. S.

3 As I noted earlier, see n. 1, supra, Justice Douglas made this proposition clear in Case v. Los Angeles, supra. Justice Douglas was a preeminent bankruptcy scholar, well known for his views on the dangers posed
by management-controlled corporate reorganizations. Both his work on

before us unsupported by either the text of $ 1129(b)(2)(B)(ii)or the record in this case. I would, therefore, affirm the

judgment of the Court of Appeals.

I
Section 1129 of Chapter 11 sets forth in detail the substan-tive requirements that a reorganization plan must satisfy in

order to qualify for confirmation.4 In the case of dissent-ing creditor classes, a plan must conform to the dictates
of $ 1129(b). With only one exception, the requirementsof $$ 1129(a) and 1129(b) are identical for plans submitted
by stockholders or junior creditors and plans submittedby other parties. That exception is the requirement in

$ 1129(b)(2)(B)(ii) that no holder of a junior claim or interestmay receive or retain any property "on account of such
junior claim or interest."When read in the light of Justice Douglas' opinion in

Casev. Los Angeles Lumber Products Co., 308 U. S. 106 (1939),

the meaning of this provision is perfectly clear. Whenevera junior claimant receives or retains an interest for a bargain
price, it does so "on account of " its prior claim. On the other
sion and on Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act sought to "restore the integrity of the reorganization process" which "too often [was] masterminded
from behind the scenes by reorganization managers allied with the corporation's management or its bankers." Jennings, Mr. Justice Douglas: His
Influence on Corporate and Securities Regulation, 73 Yale L. J. 920, 935-
937 (1964). To this end, Douglas placed special emphasis on the protection of creditors' rights in reorganizations. Hopkirk, William O. Douglas--His Work in Policing Bankruptcy Proceedings, 18 Vand. L. Rev. 663,
685 (1965). I find it implausible that Congress, in enacting the Bankruptcy Code, intended to be even more strict than Justice Douglas in limiting the ability of debtors to participate in reorganizations.

4 "Confirmation of a plan of reorganization is the statutory goal of every

chapter 11 case. Section 1129 provides the requirements for such confirmation, containing Congress' minimum requirements for allowing an entity to discharge its unpaid debts and continue its operations." 7 Collier
on Bankruptcy || 1129.01, p. 1129-10 (rev. 15th ed. 1998).

hand, if the new capital that it invests has an equivalent or
greater value than its interest in the reorganized venture, it
should be equally clear that its participation is based on the
fair price being paid and that it is not "on account of " its old
claim or equity.

Of course, the fact that the proponents of a plan offer to
pay a fair price for the interest they seek to acquire or retain
does not necessarily mean that the bankruptcy judge should
approve their plan. Any proposed cramdown must satisfy
all of the requirements of $ 1129 including, most notably, the
requirement that the plan be "fair and equitable" to all creditors whose claims are impaired. See $ 1129(b)(1). Moreover, even if the old stockholders propose to buy the debtor
for a fair price, presumably their plan should not be approved
if a third party, perhaps motivated by unique tax or competitive considerations, is willing to pay an even higher price.
Cf. $ 1129(c).

In every reorganization case, serious questions concerning
the value of the debtor's assets must be resolved.5 Nevertheless, for the purpose of answering the legal question presented by the parties to this case, I believe that we should
assume that all valuation questions have been correctly answered. If, for example, there had been a widely advertised
auction in which numerous bidders participated, and if
the plan proposed by respondents had been more favorable
by a wide margin than any competing proposal, would

$ 1129(b)(2)(B)(ii) require rejection of their plan simply because it provides that they shall retain 100% of the equity?

Petitioner and the Government would reply "yes" because
they think $ 1129(b)(2)(B)(ii) imposes an absolute ban on participation by junior claimants without the consent of all senior creditors. The Court correctly rejects this extreme
position because it would make the words "on account of "

superfluous, and because there is no plausible reason whyCongress would have desired such a categorical exclusion,

given that in some cases old equity may be the most likelysource of new capital. See ante, at 452-453. Indeed, the
dissenting judge in the Court of Appeals thought "such a re-sult would border on the absurd."

6 Thus, neither the dissenting judge in the Court of Appeals nor the Court appears to bein doubt about the proper answer to my hypothetical question.

Instead, the decision is apparently driven by doubts concern-ing the procedures followed by the Bankruptcy Judge in
making his value determinations, implicitly suggesting thatthe statute should be construed to require some form of competitive bidding in cases like this.7 See ante, at 456-458.Perhaps such a procedural requirement would be a wise
addition to the statute, but it is surely not contained in the

6 Judge Kanne wrote in dissent: "Perhaps the majority's reasoning is
driven by the fear that a `but for' interpretation would prevent old equity
from ever participating in a reorganized entity--something Congress
could never have intended. Indeed, such a result would border on the
absurd, but a simpler, `but for' causation requirement would not preclude
junior interests from participating in a reorganized entity. If prior equity
holders earn their shares in an open auction, for example, their received
interests would not be `on account of' their junior interests but `on account
of' their capital contributions." In re 203 N. LaSalle Street Partnership,
126 F. 3d 955, 972 (CA7 1997).

It would seem logical for adherents of this view also to find participation
by junior interests in the new entity not "on account of" their prior interest, if it were stipulated that old equity's capital contributions exceeded
the amount attainable in an auction, or if findings to that effect were not
challenged.

7 This doubt is unwarranted in this case. The bank does not challenge

the Bankruptcy Court's finding that the 15 floors of office space had a
market value of $55.8 million. The bank's original expert testimony on
the value of the property differed from the Bankruptcy Judge's finding by
only 2.8%. In re 203 N. LaSalle Street Partnership, 190 B. R. 567, 573-
576 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ND Ill. 1995). Therefore, although the bank argues that
the policy implications of the "new value debate" revolve around judicial
determinations of the valuation of the relevant collateral, Brief for Petitioner 5, n. 2, this concern was neither squarely presented in this case nor
preserved for our review.

present text of $ 1129(b)(2)(B)(ii). Indeed, that subsectionis not a procedural provision at all. Section 1129 defines

the substantive elements that must be met to render planseligible for confirmation by the bankruptcy judge after
all required statutory procedures have been completed.Cf. $ 1121 (Who may file a plan); $ 1122 (Classification of
claims or interests); $ 1125 (Postpetition disclosure and solici-tation); $ 1126 (Acceptance of plan); $ 1127 (Modification of
plan). Because, as I discuss below, petitioner does not nowchallenge either the procedures followed by the Bankruptcy
Judge or any of his value determinations, neither the recordnor the text of $ 1129(b)(2)(B)(ii) provides any support for
the Court's disposition of this case.

II
As I understand the Court's opinion, it relies on two rea-sons for refusing to approve the plan at this stage of the

proceedings: one based on the plan itself and the other onthe confirmation procedures followed before the plan was
adopted. In the Court's view, the fatal flaw in the plan pro-posed by respondent was that it vested complete ownership
in the former partners immediately upon confirmation, ante,at 454, and the defect in the process was that no other party
had an opportunity to propose a competing plan.These requirements are neither explicitly nor implicitly
dictated by the text of the statute. As for the first objec-tion, if we assume that the partners paid a fair price for what
the Court characterizes as their "exclusive opportunity," Ido not understand why the retention of a 100% interest in
assets is any more "on account of " their prior position thanretaining a lesser percentage might have been. Surely
there is no legal significance to the fact that immediately
after the confirmation of the plan "the partners were in thesame position that they would have enjoyed had they exercised an exclusive option under the plan to buy the equity

in the reorganized entity, or contracted to purchase itfrom a seller who had first agreed to deal with no one

else." Ibid.As to the second objection, petitioner does not challenge
the Bankruptcy Judge's valuation of the property or any ofhis other findings under $ 1129 (other than the plan's compliance with $ 1129(b)(2)(B)(ii)). Since there is no remainingquestion as to value, both the former partners (and the creditors, for that matter) are in the same position that theywould have enjoyed if the Bankruptcy Court had held an
auction in which this plan had been determined to be thebest available. That the court did not hold such an auction
should not doom this plan, because no such auction was re-quested by any of the parties, and the statute does not require that an auction be held. As with all the provisions of$ 1129, the question of compliance with $ 1129(b)(2)(B)(ii)
turns on the substantive content of the plan, not on specu-lation about the procedures that might have preceded its
confirmation.In this case, the partners had the exclusive right to propose a reorganization plan during the first 120 days afterfiling for bankruptcy. See $ 1121(b). No one contends that
that exclusive right is a form of property that is retained bythe debtor "on account of " its prior status.

8 The partners

did indeed propose a plan which provided for an infusion of$6.125 million in new capital in exchange for ownership of

the reorganized debtor. Since the tax value of the partner-ship depended on their exclusive participation, it is unsurprising that the partners' plan did not propose that unidenti-fied outsiders should also be able to own an unspecified
portion of the reorganized partnership. It seems both prac-tically and economically puzzling to assume that Congress
would have expected old equity to provide for the participa8 Indeed, as the Court acknowledges, ante, at 454, it is not "property"

tion of unknown third parties, who would have interests dif-ferent from (and perhaps incompatible with) the partners', in

order to comply with $ 1129(b)(2)(B)(ii).9Nevertheless, even after proposing their plan, the partners
had no vested right to purchase an equity interest in thepostreorganization enterprise until the Bankruptcy Judge
confirmed the plan. They also had no assurance that thecourt would refuse to truncate the exclusivity period and
allow other interested parties to file competing plans. As itturned out, the Bankruptcy Judge did not allow respondent
to file its proposed plan, but the bank did not appeal thatissue, and the question is not before us.

10

The moment the judge did confirm the partners' plan, theold equity holders were required by law to implement the

terms of the plan.11 It was then, and only then, that what

9 It goes without saying that Congress could not have expected the partners' plan to include a provision that would allow for the Bankruptcy
Judge to entertain competing plans, since that is a discretionary decision
exclusively within the province of the court. See $ 1121(d).

10 Apparently, the bank's plan called for liquidation of the property. In

order to flesh out all facts bearing on value, perhaps the Bankruptcy Judge
should have terminated the exclusivity period and allowed the bank to file
its plan. That the bank's plan called for liquidation of the property in a
single-asset context does not necessarily contravene the purposes of Chapter 11. See, e. g., In re River Village Associates, 181 B. R. 795, 805 (ED
Pa. 1995).

11 Section 1141(a) states: "Except as provided in subsections (d)(2) and

(d)(3) of this section, the provisions of a confirmed plan bind the debtor,
any entity issuing securities under the plan, any entity acquiring property
under the plan, and any creditor, equity security holder, or general partner
in the debtor, whether or not the claim or interest of such creditor, equity
security holder, or general partner is impaired under the plan and whether
or not such creditor, equity security holder, or general partner has accepted the plan."

See 8 Collier on Bankruptcy || 1141.02, at 1141-4 to 1141-5. ("Section
1141(a) of the Code provides that a plan is binding upon all parties once it

the Court characterizes as the critical "exclusive opportu-nity" came into existence. What the Court refuses to recognize, however, is that this "exclusive opportunity" is thefunction of the procedural features of this case: the statutory
exclusivity period, the Bankruptcy Judge's refusal to allowthe bank to file a competing plan, and the inescapable fact
that the judge could confirm only one plan.The Court's repeated references to the partners' "opportunity," see ante, at 454, 455, 456, is potentially misleadingbecause it ignores the fact that a plan is binding upon all
parties once it is confirmed. One can, of course, refer tocontractual rights and duties as "opportunities," but they are
not separate property interests comparable to an option thatgives its holder a legal right either to enter into a contract
or not to do so. They are simply a part of the bundle ofcontractual terms that have legal significance when a plan
is confirmed.When the court approved the plan, it accepted an offer
by old equity. If the value of the debtor's assets has beenaccurately determined, the fairness of such an offer should
be judged by the same standard as offers made by newcom-ers. Of course, its offer should not receive more favorable
consideration "on account of " their prior ownership. But ifthe debtor's plan would be entitled to approval if it had been
submitted by a third party, it should not be disqualified sim-ply because it did not include a unique provision that would

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 98-6. Argued March 2, 1999--Decided May 3, 1999
As relevant here, the Price-Anderson Act provides certain federal licensees with limited liability for claims of "public liability" arising out of or
resulting from a nuclear incident, converts such actions into federal
claims, grants federal district courts removal jurisdiction over such actions, and provides the mechanics for consolidating the actions and for
managing them once consolidated. Respondents filed separate lawsuits
in Navajo Tribal Courts, claiming damages for injuries suffered as a
result of uranium mining operations. Petitioners, defendants in those
suits, each filed suit in Federal District Court, seeking to enjoin respondents from pursuing their tribal-court claims. Citing the tribalcourt exhaustion doctrine of National Farmers Union Ins. Cos. v. Crow
Tribe, 471 U. S. 845, the District Court denied preliminary injunctions
except to the extent that respondents sought relief in the Tribal Courts
under the Price-Anderson Act. The practical consequences of the injunctions were left in the air, however, since the District Court left the
determinations whether the Act applied to respondents' claims to the
Tribal Courts. On petitioners' consolidated appeals, the Ninth Circuit
affirmed the District Court's decisions not to enjoin respondents from
pursuing non-Price-Anderson Act claims and to allow the Tribal Courts
to decide whether respondents' claims fell under that Act. Although
respondents had not appealed the partial injunctions, the Ninth Circuit,
citing important comity considerations, sua sponte reversed them.

Held:

1. Because the partial injunctions were not properly before the Court
of Appeals, it erred in addressing them. Absent a cross-appeal, an appellee may urge in support of a decree any matter appearing in the
record, but may not attack the decree with a view either to enlarging
his own rights thereunder or lessening his adversary's rights. United
States v. American Railway Express Co., 265 U. S. 425, 435. The Ninth
Circuit acknowledged the rule, but took up the unappealed portions of
the orders sua sponte because it believed that the prohibition on modifying judgments in favor of a nonappealing party is a "rule of practice"
subject to exceptions rather than an unqualified bound on the jurisdiction of appellate courts. This Court need not decide the theoretical
status of the rule, for even if it is not strictly jurisdictional, the "comity

considerations" the Ninth Circuit invoked are clearly inadequate to defeat the institutional interests the rule advances. Indeed, not a single
one of this Court's holdings has ever recognized an exception to the rule.
Respondents misconceive the nature of the cross-appeal requirement
when they argue that they should not be penalized for failing to crossappeal from preliminary injunctions because they could raise the same
issue on appeal from the final judgment. The requirement is meant not
to penalize parties who fail to assert their rights, but to protect institutional interests in the orderly functioning of the judicial system by putting opposing parties and appellate courts on notice of the issues to be
litigated and encouraging repose of those that are not. Fairness of notice does not turn on the interlocutory character of the orders at issue
here, and the interest in repose, though somewhat diminished when a
final appeal may yet raise the issue, is still considerable owing to the
indefinite duration of the injunctions. Pp. 479-482.

2. The doctrine of tribal-court exhaustion does not apply in this
case, which if brought in a state court would be subject to removal.
Pp. 482-488.

(a) This case differs markedly from those in which tribal-court exhaustion is appropriate. By the Price-Anderson Act's unusual preemption provision, 42 U. S. C. $ 2014(hh), Congress expressed an unmistakable preference for a federal forum, at the behest of the defending party,
both for litigating a Price-Anderson claim on the merits and for determining whether a claim falls under the Act when removal is contested.
Petitioners seek the benefit of what is in effect the same scheme of
preference for a federal forum when they ask for an injunction against
further litigation in the tribal courts. The issue, then, is whether Congress would have chosen to postpone federal resolution of the enjoinable
character of this tribal-court litigation, when it would not have postponed federal resolution of the functionally identical issue pending in a
state court. Pp. 482-485.

(b) The apparent reasons for the congressional policy of immediate
access to federal forums are as much applicable to tribal- as to statecourt litigation. The Act provides clear indications of the congressional
aims of speed and efficiency in the provisions addressing consolidation
and management of cases, e. g., 42 U. S. C. $ 2210(n)(3)(A). The Act's
terms are underscored by its legislative history, which expressly refers
to the multitude of separate cases brought in the aftermath of the Three
Mile Island accident and adverts to the expectation that the consolidation provisions would avoid inefficiencies resulting from duplicative determinations of similar issues in multiple jurisdictions. Applying tribal
exhaustion would invite precisely the mischief of duplicative determina526US2 Unit: $U52 [05-03-01 16:48:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.
The issue is whether the judicially created doctrine of
tribal-court exhaustion, requiring a district court to stay its
hand while a tribal court determines its own jurisdiction,
should apply in this case, which if brought in a state court
would be subject to removal. We think the exhaustion doctrine should not extend so far.

peaceful purposes," Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group, Inc., 438 U. S. 59, 63 (1978), Congress
passed the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (AEA), 68 Stat. 919,

In the wake of the 1979 accident at the Three Mile Islandnuclear power plant, suits proliferated in state and federal

courts, but because the accident was not an "extraordinarynuclear occurrence," within the meaning of the Act, see

$ 2014( j), there was no mechanism for consolidating theclaims in federal court. See S. Rep. No. 100-218, p. 13
(1987). Congress responded in 1988 by amending the Actto grant United States district courts original and removal
jurisdiction over all "public liability actions," 102 Stat. 1076,42 U. S. C. $ 2210(n)(2), defined as suits "asserting public liability," $ 2014(hh), which "shall be deemed to be . . . action[s]arising under" $ 2210. The Act now provides the mechanics
for consolidating such actions, $ 2210(n)(2), for managingthem once consolidated, $ 2210(n)(3), and for distributing limited compensatory funds, $ 2210(o).In 1995, respondents Laura and Arlinda Neztsosie, two
members of the Navajo Nation, filed suit in the DistrictCourt of the Navajo Nation, Tuba City District, against petitioner El Paso Natural Gas Company and one of its subsidi-aries, Rare Metals Corporation. The Neztsosies alleged
that on the Navajo Nation Reservation, from 1950 to 1965,El Paso and Rare Metals operated open pit uranium mines,
which collected water then used by the Neztsosies for a num-ber of things, including drinking. The Neztsosies claimed
that, as a result, they suffered severe injuries from exposureto radioactive and other hazardous materials, for which they
sought compensatory and punitive damages under Navajotort law. App. 18a-27a. In 1996, respondent Zonnie Richards, also a member of the Navajo Nation, brought suit forherself and her husband's estate in the District Court of the

States District Court for the District of Arizona, seeking toenjoin the Neztsosies and Richards from pursuing their
claims in the Tribal Courts. The District Court, citing the
tribal-court exhaustion doctrine of National Farmers Union
Ins. Cos. v. Crow Tribe, 471 U. S. 845 (1985), denied preliminary injunctions "except to the extent" that the Neztsosies
and Richards sought relief in the Tribal Courts under the
Price-Anderson Act. App. 71a, 73a. The practical consequences of those injunctions were left in the air, however,
since the District Court declined to decide whether the Act
applied to the claims brought by the Neztsosies and Richards, leaving those determinations to the Tribal Courts in
the first instance. Id., at 71a, 73a. Both El Paso and Cyprus Foote appealed.

On the companies' consolidated appeals, the Ninth Circuit
affirmed the District Court's decisions declining to enjoin the
Neztsosies and Richards from pursuing non-Price-Anderson
Act claims, as well as the decisions to allow the Tribal Courts
to decide in the first instance whether the Neztsosies' and
Richards's tribal claims fell within the ambit of the PriceAnderson Act. 136 F. 3d, at 617, n. 4, 620. But the Court
of Appeals did not rest there. Although neither the Neztsosies nor Richards had appealed the partial injunctions
against them, the Ninth Circuit sua sponte addressed those
District Court rulings, citing "important comity considerations involved." Id., at 615. The court reversed as to the
injunctions, holding that the Act contains no "express juris526US2 Unit: $U52 [12-11-00 19:24:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN

dictional prohibition" barring the tribal court from determin-ing its jurisdiction over Price-Anderson Act claims. Id., at

617-620. Judge Kleinfeld dissented, concluding that theunappealed partial injunctions against litigating PriceAnderson Act claims in tribal court should be treated as lawof the case, that all of the tribal-law claims were actually
Price-Anderson Act claims, and that exhaustion was not re-quired.

Id., at 620-622. We granted certiorari, 525 U. S.928 (1998), and now vacate and remand.

II
There is one matter preliminary to the principal issue.Because respondents did not appeal those portions of the

District Court's orders enjoining them from pursuing Price-Anderson Act claims in Tribal Court, those injunctions were
not properly before the Court of Appeals, which conse-quently erred in addressing them. We have repeatedly affirmed two linked principles governing the consequences ofan appellee's failure to cross-appeal. Absent a cross-appeal,
an appellee may "urge in support of a decree any matterappearing in the record, although his argument may involve
an attack upon the reasoning of the lower court," but maynot "attack the decree with a view either to enlarging his
own rights thereunder or of lessening the rights of his adver-sary." United States v. American Railway Express Co., 265
U. S. 425, 435 (1924); see also Union Tool Co. v. Wilson, 259U. S. 107, 111 (1922). We recognized the latter limitation as
early as 1796, see McDonough v. Dannery, 3 Dall. 188, 198,and more than 60 years ago we spoke of it as "inveterate and
certain," Morley Constr. Co. v. Maryland Casualty Co., 300U. S. 185, 191 (1937).

The Court of Appeals acknowledged the rule, but, in lightof the natural temptation to dispose of the related questions
of jurisdiction and exhaustion at one blow, still thought itcould take up the unappealed portions of the District Court's
orders sua sponte because "important comity considera526US2 Unit: $U52 [12-11-00 19:24:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
tions" were involved. 136 F. 3d, at 615. The Court of Ap-peals apparently took the view, shared by a number of courts

over the years, that the prohibition on modifying judgmentsin favor of a nonappealing party is a "rule of practice," subject to exceptions, not an unqualified limit on the power ofappellate courts. Petitioners and the Government say the
Court of Appeals was mistaken, seeing the rule as an unqual-ified bound on the jurisdiction of the courts of appeals. We
need not decide the theoretical status of such a firmly en-trenched rule,

2 however, for even if it is not strictly jurisdictional (a point we do not resolve) the "comity considerations"invoked by the Court of Appeals to justify relaxing it are

clearly inadequate to defeat the institutional interests in fairnotice and repose that the rule advances. Indeed, in more
than two centuries of repeatedly endorsing the cross-appealrequirement, not a single one of our holdings has ever recognized an exception to the rule.3

2 The issue has caused much disagreement among the Courts of Appeals
and even inconsistency within particular Circuits for more than 50 years.
For a survey of many of the cases, see Marts v. Hines, 117 F. 3d 1504,
1507-1511 (CA5 1997) (Garwood, J., dissenting), cert. denied, 522 U. S. 1058
(1998). For recent cases taking opposing positions, compare, e. g., Young
Radiator Co. v. Celotex Corp., 881 F. 2d 1408, 1416 (CA7 1989) (jurisdictional), with United States v. Tabor Court Realty Corp., 943 F. 2d 335,

issue among the members of a distinguished panel of the Second Circuit,
though without any reference to Morley Constr. Co. v. Maryland Casualty
Co., 300 U. S. 185 (1937), see In re Barnett, 124 F. 2d 1005, 1008-1013
(CA2 1942) (Frank, J., joined by Clark, J.); id., at 1013-1014 (L. Hand,
J., dissenting).

3 On three occasions since Morley Constr. Co., we have made statements

in dictum that might be taken to suggest the possibility of exceptions to
the rule. Only one of those statements concerned the power of the courts
of appeals. See Bowen v. Postal Service, 459 U. S. 212, 217-218, n. 7
(1983); id., at 244 (White, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting
in part); id., at 246-247 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting). In Strunk v. United
States, 412 U. S. 434, 437 (1973), we suggested in passing that there might
be occasions when, in a criminal case, the Court might address a constitu526US2 Unit: $U52 [12-11-00 19:24:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
On the assumption that comity is not enough, respondentsoffer one additional justification for an exception to the

cross-appeal requirement here. They point out that the Dis-trict Court orders appealed from were preliminary injunctions and thus interlocutory, not final, decrees. Respond-ents contend that because they knew they could challenge
the substance of those orders on appeal from a final judg-ment, they should not be penalized for failing to cross-appeal
at this preliminary stage of the suit. But this argumentmisconceives the nature of the cross-appeal requirement. It
is not there to penalize parties who fail to assert their rights,but is meant to protect institutional interests in the orderly

tional issue resolved in favor of a petitioner and not raised in a crosspetition for certiorari. In United States v. ITT Continental Baking Co.,
420 U. S. 223, 226, n. 2 (1975), we suggested that the cross-petition requirement might be a "matter of practice and control of our docket" rather than
of "our power." Although some might see Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U. S.
420, 435, n. 23 (1984), as countenancing exceptions to the cross-petition
requirement, see R. Stern, E. Gressman, S. Shapiro, & K. Geller, Supreme
Court Practice 364 (7th ed. 1993); see also Board of Trustees of State Univ.
of N. Y. v. Fox, 492 U. S. 469, 485-486 (1989), we have made clear that such
a view of Berkemer is mistaken. See Northwest Airlines, Inc. v. County
of Kent, 510 U. S. 355, 365, n. 8 (1994).

We have repeatedly expressed the rule in emphatic terms, see, e. g.,
Helvering v. Pfeiffer, 302 U. S. 247, 250-251 (1937) ("[A]n appellee cannot
without a cross-appeal attack a judgment entered below"), though admittedly we have normally had occasion to do so in reference to our own
certiorari jurisdiction rather than to the appellate jurisdiction of the
courts of appeals, see, e. g., LeTulle v. Scofield, 308 U. S. 415, 421-422
(1940) ("[W]e cannot afford [the nonpetitioning party] relief"); NLRB v.

Express Publishing Co., 312 U. S. 426, 431-432 (1941) ("[O]ur review is
limited"; "that question is not open here"); Alaska Industrial Bd. v. Chugach Elec. Assn., Inc., 356 U. S. 320, 325 (1958) (those questions are "not
open"); NLRB v. International Van Lines, 409 U. S. 48, 52, n. 4 (1972)
("not before us"); Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston, 469 U. S. 111,
119, n. 14 (1985) ("An argument that would modify the judgment . . . cannot
be presented unless a cross-petition has been filed"). Cf. Federated Department Stores, Inc. v. Moitie, 452 U. S. 394, 398-402 (1981) (res judicata
bars nonappealing parties from gaining the benefit of coparties' victory
on appeal).

Opinion of the Court
functioning of the judicial system, by putting opposing parties and appellate courts on notice of the issues to be litigated
and encouraging repose of those that are not. Fairness of
notice does not turn on the interlocutory character of the
orders at issue here, and while the interest in repose is somewhat diminished when a final appeal may yet raise the issue,
it is still considerable owing to the indefinite duration of the
injunctions. Preliminary injunctions are, after all, appealable as of right, see 28 U. S. C. $ 1292(a)(1), and the timely
filing requirements of Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure
4 and 26(b) squarely cover such appeals. Neither those
Rules nor the interests animating the cross-appeal requirement offer any leeway for such an exception.

Before the District Court, petitioners asserted simply that
the Tribal Court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over
Price-Anderson Act claims in respondents' tribal-court suits,
see App. 14a, 15a, 37a, and sought injunctive relief.4 The
District Court responded by enjoining respondents from pursuing any Price-Anderson claims in Tribal Court, and because they did not appeal the injunction, we have no occasion

4 At oral argument before the Court of Appeals, petitioners introduced
for the first time the essence of the theory on which they now rely, that
the Tribal Courts somehow lacked jurisdiction over Price-Anderson claims
because under Strate v. A-1 Contractors, 520 U. S. 438 (1997), a tribal
court has jurisdiction over a nonmember only where the tribe has regulatory jurisdiction with respect to the matter at issue, and Congress has
completely occupied the field of nuclear regulation. See 136 F. 3d 610,
618, n. 5 (CA9 1998); Brief for Petitioners 29-33. But Strate dealt with
claims against nonmembers arising on state highways, and "express[ed]
no view on the governing law or proper forum when an accident occurs on
a tribal road within a reservation." Strate, supra, at 442. By contrast,
the events in question here occurred on tribal lands. 136 F. 3d, at 618,
n. 5.

to consider its merits.5 Yet the injunction has no practicalsignificance without a determination whether respondents'

causes of action are as a matter of law Price-Anderson claimsunder the terms of 42 U. S. C. $$ 2210(n)(2) and 2014(hh).
This question the District Court declined to answer, thinkingthat the doctrine of tribal-court exhaustion required it to
abstain from deciding a question of tribal-court jurisdictionuntil the Tribal Courts themselves had addressed the matter.
The Court of Appeals approved the abstention on the theorythat the comity rationale underlying the tribal exhaustion
doctrine applied. See 136 F. 3d, at 613-615, 620. We think,
however, that it does not.

National Farmers Union Ins. Cos. v. Crow Tribe, 471 U. S.845 (1985), was a suit involving the federal-question jurisdiction of a United States District Court under 28 U. S. C.$ 1331, brought to determine "whether a tribal court has the
power to exercise civil subject-matter jurisdiction over non-Indians," 471 U. S., at 855. We held, initially, that federal
courts have authority to determine, as a matter "arisingunder" federal law, see 28 U. S. C. $ 1331, whether a tribal
court has exceeded the limits of its jurisdiction. See 471
U. S., at 852-853. After concluding that federal courts havesubject-matter jurisdiction to entertain such a case, we announced that, prudentially, a federal court should stay itshand "until after the Tribal Court has had a full opportunity
to determine its own jurisdiction." Id., at 857. In justi-fication of a prudential requirement of tribal exhaustion,
we stated that "the existence and extent of a tribal court'sjurisdiction will require a careful examination of tribal
sovereignty, the extent to which that sovereignty has been

5 Although we do not reach the merits of the injunction, candor requires
acknowledging that our view of the inappropriateness of applying tribal
exhaustion, adumbrated infra, at 485-487, suggests that, notwithstanding
the silence of the Price-Anderson Act with respect to tribal courts, the
exercise of tribal jurisdiction over claims found to fall within the Act once
a defendant has sought a federal forum would be anomalous at best.

altered, divested, or diminished, as well as a detailed studyof relevant statutes, Executive Branch policy as embodied in

treaties and elsewhere, and administrative or judicial deci-sions," id., at 855-856 (footnote omitted). The same "considerations of comity," Iowa Mut. Ins. Co. v. LaPlante, 480 U. S.9, 15 (1987), provided the rationale for extending the doctrine to cases where a defendant in tribal court assertsfederal-diversity jurisdiction in a related action in district
court. Id., at 16. Exhaustion was appropriate in each ofthose cases because "Congress is committed to a policy
of supporting tribal self-government . . . [which] favors a rulethat will provide the forum whose jurisdiction is being challenged the first opportunity to evaluate the factual and legalbases for the challenge." National Farmers Union Ins.
Cos., supra, at 856.This case differs markedly. By its unusual preemption
provision, see 42 U. S. C. $ 2014(hh),6 the Price-AndersonAct transforms into a federal action "any public liability action arising out of or resulting from a nuclear incident,"$ 2210(n)(2). The Act not only gives a district court original
jurisdiction over such a claim, see ibid., but provides forremoval to a federal court as of right if a putative PriceAnderson action is brought in a state court, see ibid. Con-gress thus expressed an unmistakable preference for a
federal forum, at the behest of the defending party, both for

6 This structure, in which a public liability action becomes a federal action, but one decided under substantive state-law rules of decision that do
not conflict with the Price-Anderson Act, see 42 U. S. C. $ 2014(hh), resembles what we have spoken of as " `complete pre-emption' doctrine," see
Caterpillar Inc. v. Williams, 482 U. S. 386, 393 (1987), under which "the
pre-emptive force of a statute is so `extraordinary' that it `converts an
ordinary state common-law complaint into one stating a federal claim for
purposes of the well-pleaded complaint rule,' " ibid. (quoting Metropolitan
Life Ins. Co. v. Taylor, 481 U. S. 58, 65 (1987)). We have found complete
preemption to exist under the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, see
Caterpillar Inc., supra, at 393-394, and the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, see Metropolitan Life, supra, at 65-66.

Opinion of the Court
litigating a Price-Anderson claim on the merits and for de-termining whether a claim falls under Price-Anderson when

removal is contested.Petitioners seek the benefit of what in effect is the same
scheme of preference for a federal forum when they ask for
an injunction against further litigation in the tribal courts.To be sure, their complaints claimed that the tribal courts

(unlike state courts) had no jurisdiction over these actions,on the ground that they were Price-Anderson claims. But
petitioners unmistakably seek to enjoin litigation of theseclaims in the tribal courts, whether or not those courts would
have jurisdiction to exercise in the absence of objection. In-junction against further litigation in tribal courts would in
practical terms give the same result as a removal held to be
justified on the ground that the actions removed fell underthe Price-Anderson definitions of claims of public liability: if

respondents then should wish to proceed they would be
forced to refile their claims in federal court (or a state court
from which the claims would be removed). The issue, then,
is whether Congress would have chosen to postpone federal
resolution of the enjoinable character of this tribal-court litigation, when it would not have postponed federal resolution
of the functionally identical issue pending in a state court.

We are at a loss to think of any reason that Congress
would have favored tribal exhaustion. Any generalized
sense of comity toward nonfederal courts is obviously displaced by the provisions for preemption and removal from
state courts, which are thus accorded neither jot nor tittle
of deference.7 The apparent reasons for this congressional

7 This is not to say that the existence of a federal preemption defense in
the more usual sense would affect the logic of tribal exhaustion. Under
normal circumstances, tribal courts, like state courts, can and do decide
questions of federal law, and there is no reason to think that questions of
federal preemption are any different. See Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez, 436 U. S. 49, 65 (1978) (tribal courts available to vindicate federal
rights). The situation here is the rare one in which statutory provisions

486 EL PASO NATURAL GAS CO. v. NEZTSOSIE

Opinion of the Court
policy of immediate access to federal forums are as muchapplicable to tribal- as to state-court litigation.

The Act provides clear indications of the congressionalaims of speed and efficiency. Section 2210(n)(3)(A) empowers the chief judge of a district court to appoint aspecial caseload management panel to oversee cases arising

from a nuclear incident. The functions of such panels in-clude case consolidation, $ 2210(n)(3)(C)(i); setting of priorities, $ 2210(n)(3)(C)(ii); "promulgat[ion] [of] special rules ofcourt . . . to expedite cases or allow more equitable consideration of claims," $ 2210(n)(3)(C)(v); and implementation ofsuch measures "as will encourage the equitable, prompt, and
efficient resolution of cases arising out of the nuclear inci-dent," $ 2210(n)(3)(C)(vi).

The terms of the Act are underscored by its legislativehistory, which expressly refers to the multitude of separate
cases brought "in various state and Federal courts" in theaftermath of the Three Mile Island accident. See S. Rep.
No. 100-218, at 13. This history adverts to the expectationthat "the provisions for consolidation of claims in the event
of any nuclear incident . . . would avoid the inefficiencies re-sulting from duplicative determinations of similar issues in
multiple jurisdictions that may occur in the absence of con-solidation."

Ibid.Applying tribal exhaustion would invite precisely the mischief of "duplicative determinations" and consequent "ineffi-ciencies" that the Act sought to avoid, and the force of the
congressional concerns saps the two arguable justificationsfor applying tribal exhaustion of any plausibility in these circumstances. The first possible justification might be thattribal exhaustion is less troubling than state-court exhaustion, because in the former situation the district court mayreview jurisdiction after recourse to tribal court has been
exhausted, see National Farmers Union Ins. Cos., 471 U. S.,
for conversion of state claims to federal ones and removal to federal courts
express congressional preference for a federal forum.

Opinion of the Court
at 857, whereas a state court's determination of its jurisdic-tion is final except for the possibility of our review on certiorari. But the likelihood of effective review says nothing tothe Act's insistence on efficient disposition of public liability
claims, which would of course be curtailed by an exhaustion
requirement. It is not credible that Congress would haveuniquely countenanced, let alone chosen, such a delay when

public liability claims are brought in tribal court.The second possible justification is that the absence of any
statutory provision for removal from tribal court runningparallel to the terms authorizing state-court removal might
ground a negative inference against any intent to govern
Price-Anderson actions in tribal courts, in accordance with
the usual policy of letting a plaintiff choose the forum. But
only the most zealous application of the maxim expressio
unius est exclusio alterius could answer the implausibility that Congress would have intended to force defendants
to remain in tribal courts. The congressional reasoning
sketched above is no less forceful when plaintiffs choose
tribal courts; leaving such claims in these courts would just
as effectively thwart the Act's policy of getting such cases
into a federal forum for consolidation, as leaving them in
state forums would do.

Why, then, the congressional silence on tribal courts? If
"expressio unius . . ." fails to explain the Congress's failure
to provide for tribal-court removal, what is the explanation?
After all we have said, inadvertence seems the most likely.
We have not been told of any nuclear testing laboratories
or reactors on reservation lands, and if none was brought to
the attention of Congress either, Congress probably would
never have expected an occasion for asserting tribal jurisdiction over claims like these. Now and then silence is not
pregnant.

Because the comity rationale for tribal exhaustion normally appropriate to a tribal court's determination of its jurisdiction stops short of the Price-Anderson Act, the District

California, which has the sixth highest welfare benefit levels in the country, sought to amend its Aid to Families with Dependent Children
(AFDC) program in 1992 by limiting new residents, for the first year
they live in the State, to the benefits they would have received in the
State of their prior residence. Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code Ann. $ 11450.03.
Although the Secretary of Health and Human Services approved the
change--a requirement for it to go into effect--the Federal District
Court enjoined its implementation, finding that, under Shapiro v.
Thompson, 394 U. S. 618, and Zobel v. Williams, 457 U. S. 55, it penalized "the decision of new residents to migrate to [California] and
be treated [equally] with existing residents," Green v. Anderson, 811

approval of $ 11450.03 in a separate proceeding, this Court ordered
Green to be dismissed. The provision thus remained inoperative until
after Congress enacted the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA), which replaced AFDC
with Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF). PRWORA
expressly authorizes any State receiving a TANF grant to pay the benefit amount of another State's TANF program to residents who have
lived in the State for less than 12 months. Since the Secretary no
longer needed to approve $ 11450.03, California announced that enforcement would begin on April 1, 1997. On that date, respondents
filed this class action, challenging the constitutionality of $ 11450.03's
durational residency requirement and PRWORA's approval of that
requirement. In issuing a preliminary injunction, the District Court
found that PRWORA's existence did not affect its analysis in Green.
Without reaching the merits, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the injunction.

Held:

1. Section 11450.03 violates $ 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Syllabus
(a) In assessing laws denying welfare benefits to newly arrived residents, this Court held in Shapiro that a State cannot enact durational
residency requirements in order to inhibit the migration of needy persons into the State, and that a classification that has the effect of imposing a penalty on the right to travel violates the Equal Protection Clause
absent a compelling governmental interest. Pp. 498-500.

(b) The right to travel embraces three different components: the
right to enter and leave another State; the right to be treated as a
welcome visitor while temporarily present in another State; and, for
those travelers who elect to become permanent residents, the right to
be treated like other citizens of that State. Pp. 500-502.

(c) The right of newly arrived citizens to the same privileges and
immunities enjoyed by other citizens of their new State--the third aspect of the right to travel--is at issue here. That right is protected
by the new arrival's status as both a state citizen and a United States
citizen, and it is plainly identified in the Fourteenth Amendment's
Privileges or Immunities Clause, see Slaughter-House Cases, 16 Wall.
36, 80. That newly arrived citizens have both state and federal capacities adds special force to their claim that they have the same rights as
others who share their citizenship. Pp. 502-504.

(d) Since the right to travel embraces a citizen's right to be treated
equally in her new State of residence, a discriminatory classification is
itself a penalty. California's classifications are defined entirely by the
period of residency and the location of the disfavored class members'
prior residences. Within the category of new residents, those who
lived in another country or in a State that had higher benefits than
California are treated like lifetime residents; and within the broad subcategory of new arrivals who are treated less favorably, there are 45
smaller classes whose benefit levels are determined by the law of their
former States. California's legitimate interest in saving money does
not justify this discriminatory scheme. The Fourteenth Amendment's
Citizenship Clause expressly equates citizenship with residence, Zobel,
457 U. S., at 69, and does not tolerate a hierarchy of subclasses of similarly situated citizens based on the location of their prior residences.
Pp. 504-507.

2. PRWORA's approval of durational residency requirements does not
resuscitate $ 11450.03. This Court has consistently held that Congress
may not authorize the States to violate the Fourteenth Amendment.
Moreover, the protection afforded to a citizen by that Amendment's Citizenship Clause limits the powers of the National Government as well as
the States. Congress' Article I powers to legislate are limited not only
by the scope of the Framers' affirmative delegation, but also by the
principle that the powers may not be exercised in a way that violates

492 SAENZ v. ROE

Opinion of the Court
Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court.
In 1992, California enacted a statute limiting the maxi-mum welfare benefits available to newly arrived residents.

The scheme limits the amount payable to a family that hasresided in the State for less than 12 months to the amount
payable by the State of the family's prior residence. Thequestions presented by this case are whether the 1992 statute was constitutional when it was enacted and, if not,whether an amendment to the Social Security Act enacted
by Congress in 1996 affects that determination.

I
California is not only one of the largest, most populated,and most beautiful States in the Nation; it is also one of

the most generous. Like all other States, California hasparticipated in several welfare programs authorized by the
Social Security Act and partially funded by the FederalGovernment. Its programs, however, provide a higher level
of benefits and serve more needy citizens than those of mostother States. In one year the most expensive of those programs, Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC),which was replaced in 1996 with Temporary Assistance to

Opinion of the Court
Needy Families (TANF), provided benefits for an average of2,645,814 persons per month at an annual cost to the State

of $2.9 billion. In California the cash benefit for a family oftwo--a mother and one child--is $456 a month, but in the
neighboring State of Arizona, for example, it is only $275.In 1992, in order to make a relatively modest reduction
in its vast welfare budget, the California Legislature enacted$ 11450.03 of the state Welfare and Institutions Code. That
section sought to change the California AFDC program bylimiting new residents, for the first year they live in California, to the benefits they would have received in the Stateof their prior residence.

1 Because in 1992 a state program

either had to conform to federal specifications or receive awaiver from the Secretary of Health and Human Services

in order to qualify for federal reimbursement, $ 11450.03 re-quired approval by the Secretary to take effect. In October 1992, the Secretary issued a waiver purporting to grantsuch approval.

On December 21, 1992, three California residents whowere eligible for AFDC benefits filed an action in the Eastern District of California challenging the constitutionality

494 SAENZ v. ROE

Opinion of the Court
of the durational residency requirement in $ 11450.03. Eachplaintiff alleged that she had recently moved to California

to live with relatives in order to escape abusive family cir-cumstances. One returned to California after living in Louisiana for seven years, the second had been living in Okla-homa for six weeks and the third came from Colorado. Each
alleged that her monthly AFDC grant for the ensuing 12months would be substantially lower under $ 11450.03 than
if the statute were not in effect. Thus, the former residentsof Louisiana and Oklahoma would receive $190 and $341 respectively for a family of three even though the full Califor-nia grant was $641; the former resident of Colorado, who had
just one child, was limited to $280 a month as opposed to thefull California grant of $504 for a family of two.

The District Court issued a temporary restraining orderand, after a hearing, preliminarily enjoined implementation
of the statute. District Judge Levi found that the statute"produces substantial disparities in benefit levels and makes
no accommodation for the different costs of living that existin different states."

2 Relying primarily on our decisions in

Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U. S. 618 (1969), and Zobel v. Wil-liams, 457 U. S. 55 (1982), he concluded that the statute

placed "a penalty on the decision of new residents to migrateto the State and be treated on an equal basis with existing
residents." Green v. Anderson, 811 F. Supp. 516, 521 (EDCal. 1993). In his view, if the purpose of the measure was
to deter migration by poor people into the State, it wouldbe unconstitutional for that reason. And even if the purpose was only to conserve limited funds, the State hadfailed to explain why the entire burden of the saving should
be imposed on new residents. The Court of Appeals sum2 The District Court referred to an official table of fair market rents
indicating that California's housing costs are higher than any other State
except Massachusetts. See Green v. Anderson, 811 F. Supp. 516, 521,
n. 13 (ED Cal. 1993); see also Declaration of Robert Greenstein, App.

marily affirmed for the reasons stated by the District Judge.Green v. Anderson, 26 F. 3d 95 (CA9 1994).

We granted the State's petition for certiorari. 513 U. S.922 (1994). We were, however, unable to reach the merits
because the Secretary's approval of $ 11450.03 had been in-validated in a separate proceeding,

3 and the State had acknowledged that the Act would not be implemented withoutfurther action by the Secretary. We vacated the judgment

and directed that the case be dismissed. Anderson v. Green,513 U. S. 557 (1995)

(per curiam).4 Accordingly, $ 11450.03remained inoperative until after Congress enacted the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity ReconciliationAct of 1996 (PRWORA), 110 Stat. 2105.

PRWORA replaced the AFDC program with TANF. Thenew statute expressly authorizes any State that receives a
block grant under TANF to "apply to a family the rules(including benefit amounts) of the [TANF] program . . . of
another State if the family has moved to the State fromthe other State and has resided in the State for less than 12
months." 110 Stat. 2124, 42 U. S. C. $ 604(c) (1994 ed., Supp.II). With this federal statutory provision in effect, California no longer needed specific approval from the Secretary toimplement $ 11450.03. The California Department of Social
Services therefore issued an "All County Letter" announc-ing that the enforcement of $ 11450.03 would commence on
April 1, 1997.The All County Letter clarifies certain aspects of the
statute. Even if members of an eligible family had lived inCalifornia all of their lives, but left the State "on January
29th, intending to reside in another state, and returned onApril 15th," their benefits are determined by the law of their
State of residence from January 29 to April 15, assuming

between old and new residents. App. to Pet. for Cert. 46-52.

Opinion of the Court
that that level was lower than California's.5 Moreover, thelower level of benefits applies regardless of whether the

family was on welfare in the State of prior residence andregardless of the family's motive for moving to California.
The instructions also explain that the residency require-ment is inapplicable to families that recently arrived from
another country. II

On April 1, 1997, the two respondents filed this action inthe Eastern District of California making essentially the
same claims asserted by the plaintiffs in Anderson v. Green,6but also challenging the constitutionality of PRWORA's
approval of the durational residency requirement. As in
Green, the District Court issued a temporary restrainingorder and certified the case as a class action.

7 The court

also advised the Attorney General of the United States thatthe constitutionality of a federal statute had been drawn

into question, but she did not seek to intervene or to filean

amicus brief. Reasoning that PRWORA permitted, butdid not require, States to impose durational residency requirements, Judge Levi concluded that the existence of thefederal statute did not affect the legal analysis in his prior
opinion in Green.He did, however, make certain additional comments on the
parties' factual contentions. He noted that the State didnot challenge plaintiffs' evidence indicating that, although

6 One of the respondents is a former resident of Oklahoma and the other

moved to California from the District of Columbia. In both of those jurisdictions the benefit levels are substantially lower than in California.

7 On the stipulation of the parties, the court certified a class of plaintiffs

defined as " `all present and future AFDC and TANF applicants and recipients who have applied or will apply for AFDC or TANF on or after
April 1, 1997, and who will be denied full California AFDC or TANF benefits because they have not resided in California for twelve consecutive
months immediately preceding their application for aid.' " App. to Pet.

Opinion of the Court
California benefit levels were the sixth highest in the Nationin absolute terms,

8 when housing costs are factored in, they

rank 18th; that new residents coming from 43 States wouldface higher costs of living in California; and that welfare

benefit levels actually have little, if any, impact on the resi-dential choices made by poor people. On the other hand, he
noted that the availability of other programs such as home-less assistance and an additional food stamp allowance of
$1 in stamps for every $3 in reduced welfare benefits par-tially offset the disparity between the benefits for new and
old residents. Notwithstanding those ameliorating facts,the State did not disagree with plaintiffs' contention that

$ 11450.03 would create significant disparities between new-comers and welfare recipients who have resided in the State
for over one year.The State relied squarely on the undisputed fact that the
statute would save some $10.9 million in annual welfarecosts--an amount that is surely significant even though
only a relatively small part of its annual expenditures ofapproximately $2.9 billion for the entire program. It contended that this cost saving was an appropriate exercise ofbudgetary authority as long as the residency requirement
did not penalize the right to travel. The State reasonedthat the payment of the same benefits that would have been
received in the State of prior residency eliminated any po-tentially punitive aspects of the measure. Judge Levi
concluded, however, that the relevant comparison was notbetween new residents of California and the residents of
their former States, but rather between the new residentsand longer term residents of California. He therefore again
enjoined the implementation of the statute.Without finally deciding the merits, the Court of Appeals
affirmed his issuance of a preliminary injunction. Roe v.
Anderson, 134 F. 3d 1400 (CA9 1998). It agreed with the

levels than California. Id., at 22, n. 10.

that have addressed the issue,9 we granted certiorari be-cause of the importance of the case.

The word "travel" is not found in the text of the Con-stitution. Yet the "constitutional right to travel from one

State to another" is firmly embedded in our jurisprudence.United States v. Guest, 383 U. S. 745, 757 (1966). Indeed,
as Justice Stewart reminded us in Shapiro v. Thompson, 394U. S. 618 (1969), the right is so important that it is "assertable against private interference as well as governmentalaction . . . a virtually unconditional personal right, guaranteed by the Constitution to us all." Id., at 643 (concurringopinion).

9 See Maldonado v. Houston, 157 F. 3d 179 (CA3 1998) (finding twotier durational residency requirement an unconstitutional infringement on
the right to travel); Anderson v. Green, 26 F. 3d 95 (CA9 1994), vacated
as unripe, 513 U. S. 557 (1995) (per curiam); Hicks v. Peters, 10 F. Supp.
2d 1003 (ND Ill. 1998) (granting injunction against enforcement of durational residency requirement); Westenfelder v. Ferguson, 998 F. Supp. 146
(RI 1998) (holding durational residency requirement a penalty on right to
travel incapable of surviving rational-basis review). Two state courts
have reached the same conclusion. See Mitchell v. Steffen, 504 N. W. 2d
198 (Minn. 1993), cert. denied, 510 U. S. 1081 (1994) (striking down a similar provision in Minnesota law); Sanchez v. Department of Human Services, 314 N. J. Super. 11, 713 A. 2d 1056 (1998) (striking down two-tier
welfare system); cf. Jones v. Milwaukee County, 168 Wis. 2d 892, 485 N. W.
2d 21 (1992) (holding that a 60-day waiting period for applicant for general
relief is not a penalty and therefore not unconstitutional).

Opinion of the Court
In Shapiro, we reviewed the constitutionality of threestatutory provisions that denied welfare assistance to residents of Connecticut, the District of Columbia, and Penn-sylvania, who had resided within those respective jurisdictions less than one year immediately preceding theirapplications for assistance. Without pausing to identify the
specific source of the right, we began by noting that theCourt had long "recognized that the nature of our Federal
Union and our constitutional concepts of personal libertyunite to require that all citizens be free to travel throughout
the length and breadth of our land uninhibited by statutes,rules, or regulations which unreasonably burden or restrict
this movement." Id., at 629. We squarely held that it was"constitutionally impermissible" for a State to enact durational residency requirements for the purpose of inhibitingthe migration by needy persons into the State.

11 We further

held that a classification that had the effect of imposing apenalty on the exercise of the right to travel violated the

Equal Protection Clause "unless shown to be necessary topromote a compelling governmental interest," id., at 634,
and that no such showing had been made.In this case California argues that $ 11450.03 was not
enacted for the impermissible purpose of inhibiting migra-tion by needy persons and that, unlike the legislation reviewed in Shapiro, it does not penalize the right to travelbecause new arrivals are not ineligible for benefits during
their first year of residence. California submits that, in11 "We do not doubt that the one-year waiting-period device is well
suited to discourage the influx of poor families in need of assistance. . . .
But the purpose of inhibiting migration by needy persons into the State
is constitutionally impermissible." 394 U. S., at 629.

"Thus, the purpose of deterring the in-migration of indigents cannot
serve as justification for the classification created by the one-year waiting
period . . . . If a law has `no other purpose . . . than to chill the assertion
of constitutional rights by penalizing those who choose to exercise them,
then it [is] patently unconstitutional.' United States v. Jackson, 390 U. S.

500 SAENZ v. ROE

Opinion of the Court
stead of being subjected to the strictest scrutiny, the stat-ute should be upheld if it is supported by a rational basis

and that the State's legitimate interest in saving over $10million a year satisfies that test. Although the United
States did not elect to participate in the proceedings in theDistrict Court or the Court of Appeals, it has participated
as amicus curiae in this Court. It has advanced the novelargument that the enactment of PRWORA allows the States
to adopt a "specialized choice-of-law-type provision" that"should be subject to an intermediate level of constitutional review," merely requiring that durational residencyrequirements be "substantially related to an important governmental objective." 12 The debate about the appropriatestandard of review, together with the potential relevance of
the federal statute, persuades us that it will be useful tofocus on the source of the constitutional right on which respondents rely. IV

The "right to travel" discussed in our cases embraces atleast three different components. It protects the right of
a citizen of one State to enter and to leave another State,the right to be treated as a welcome visitor rather than an
unfriendly alien when temporarily present in the secondState, and, for those travelers who elect to become permanent residents, the right to be treated like other citizens ofthat State.

It was the right to go from one place to another, includingthe right to cross state borders while en route, that was
vindicated in Edwards v. California, 314 U. S. 160 (1941),which invalidated a state law that impeded the free interstate passage of the indigent. We reaffirmed that right in
United States v. Guest, 383 U. S. 745 (1966), which affordedprotection to the " `right to travel freely to and from the

State of Georgia and to use highway facilities and other

Opinion of the Court
instrumentalities of interstate commerce within the Stateof Georgia.' " Id., at 757. Given that $ 11450.03 imposed no

obstacle to respondents' entry into California, we think theState is correct when it argues that the statute does not
directly impair the exercise of the right to free interstatemovement. For the purposes of this case, therefore, we
need not identify the source of that particular right in thetext of the Constitution. The right of "free ingress and regress to and from" neighboring States, which was expresslymentioned in the text of the Articles of Confederation,

13 may

simply have been "conceived from the beginning to be a nec-essary concomitant of the stronger Union the Constitution

created." Id., at 758.The second component of the right to travel is, however,
expressly protected by the text of the Constitution. Thefirst sentence of Article IV, $ 2, provides:

"The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to allPrivileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several
States."
Thus, by virtue of a person's state citizenship, a citizen ofone State who travels in other States, intending to return

home at the end of his journey, is entitled to enjoy the "Privi-leges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States" that
he visits.14 This provision removes "from the citizens ofeach State the disabilities of alienage in the other States."

Paul v. Virginia, 8 Wall. 168, 180 (1869) ("[W]ithout some

a State whether to obtain employment, Hicklin v. Orbeck,437 U. S. 518 (1978), to procure medical services,

Doe v. Bol-ton, 410 U. S. 179, 200 (1973), or even to engage in commercial shrimp fishing, Toomer v. Witsell, 334 U. S. 385 (1948).Those protections are not "absolute," but the Clause "does
bar discrimination against citizens of other States wherethere is no substantial reason for the discrimination beyond
the mere fact that they are citizens of other States." Id.,at 396. There may be a substantial reason for requiring
the nonresident to pay more than the resident for a huntinglicense, see

into another State and become a resident of that State.What is at issue in this case, then, is this third aspect of
the right to travel--the right of the newly arrived citizen tothe same privileges and immunities enjoyed by other citizens
of the same State. That right is protected not only by thenew arrival's status as a state citizen, but also by her status
as a citizen of the United States.15 That additional source

of protection is plainly identified in the opening words of theFourteenth Amendment:

"All persons born or naturalized in the United States,and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of
the United States and of the State wherein they reside.No State shall make or enforce any law which shall
abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of theUnited States; . . . ."

Despite fundamentally differing views concerning the cover-age of the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment, most notably expressed in the majority and dis-senting opinions in the Slaughter-House Cases, 16 Wall. 36
(1873), it has always been common ground that this Clauseprotects the third component of the right to travel. Writing
for the majority in the Slaughter-House Cases, Justice Millerexplained that one of the privileges conferred by this Clause
"is that a citizen of the United States can, of his own volition,become a citizen of any State of the Union by a

bona^ fideresidence therein, with the same rights as other citizens of

that State." Id., at 80. Justice Bradley, in dissent, usedeven stronger language to make the same point:

"The states have not now, if they ever had, any powerto restrict their citizenship to any classes or persons. A
citizen of the United States has a perfect constitutional
Dred Scott v. Sandford, 19 How. 393 (1857), this Court had limited the
protection of Article IV to rights under state law and concluded that free
blacks could not claim citizenship. The Fourteenth Amendment overruled this decision. The Amendment's Privileges or Immunities Clause
and Citizenship Clause guaranteed the rights of newly freed black citizens
by ensuring that they could claim the state citizenship of any State in
which they resided and by precluding that State from abridging their
rights of national citizenship.

16 U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, $ 1. The remainder of the section provides:

"nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the
equal protection of the laws."

right to go to and reside in any State he chooses, and toclaim citizenship therein, and an equality of rights with

every other citizen; and the whole power of the nationis pledged to sustain him in that right. He is not bound
to cringe to any superior, or to pray for any act of grace,as a means of enjoying all the rights and privileges enjoyed by other citizens." Id., at 112-113.
That newly arrived citizens "have two political capacities,one state and one federal," adds special force to their claim

that they have the same rights as others who share theircitizenship.

17 Neither mere rationality nor some intermediate standard of review should be used to judge the constitu-tionality of a state rule that discriminates against some of

its citizens because they have been domiciled in the State forless than a year. The appropriate standard may be more
categorical than that articulated in Shapiro, see supra, at499, but it is surely no less strict.

V
Because this case involves discrimination against citizenswho have completed their interstate travel, the State's argument that its welfare scheme affects the right to travel only"incidentally" is beside the point. Were we concerned solely
with actual deterrence to migration, we might be persuadedthat a partial withholding of benefits constitutes a lesser incursion on the right to travel than an outright denial of allbenefits. See

Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U. S. 330, 339 (1972).

17 "Federalism was our Nation's own discovery. The Framers split the
atom of sovereignty. It was the genius of their idea that our citizens
would have two political capacities, one state and one federal, each protected from incursion by the other. The resulting Constitution created a
legal system unprecedented in form and design, establishing two orders
of government, each with its own direct relationship, its own privity, its
own set of mutual rights and obligations to the people who sustain it and
are governed by it." U. S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, 514 U. S. 779,

Opinion of the Court
But since the right to travel embraces the citizen's right tobe treated equally in her new State of residence, the discriminatory classification is itself a penalty.It is undisputed that respondents and the members of the
class that they represent are citizens of California and that
their need for welfare benefits is unrelated to the length oftime that they have resided in California. We thus have no

occasion to consider what weight might be given to a citizen'slength of residence if the bona fides of her claim to state
citizenship were questioned. Moreover, because whateverbenefits they receive will be consumed while they remain in
California, there is no danger that recognition of their claim
will encourage citizens of other States to establish residency
for just long enough to acquire some readily portable benefit,
such as a divorce or a college education, that will be enjoyed
after they return to their original domicile. See, e. g., Sosna
v. Iowa, 419 U. S. 393 (1975); Vlandis v. Kline, 412 U. S. 441
(1973).

The classifications challenged in this case--and there are
many--are defined entirely by (a) the period of residency
in California and (b) the location of the prior residences of
the disfavored class members. The favored class of beneficiaries includes all eligible California citizens who have
resided there for at least one year, plus those new arrivals
who last resided in another country or in a State that provides benefits at least as generous as California's. Thus,
within the broad category of citizens who resided in California for less than a year, there are many who are treated
like lifetime residents. And within the broad subcategory
of new arrivals who are treated less favorably, there are
many smaller classes whose benefit levels are determined by
the law of the States from whence they came. To justify

$ 11450.03, California must therefore explain not only why it
is sound fiscal policy to discriminate against those who have
been citizens for less than a year, but also why it is permissible to apply such a variety of rules within that class.

526US2 Unit: $U53 [12-11-00 20:00:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN
506 SAENZ v. ROE

Opinion of the Court
These classifications may not be justified by a purpose to
deter welfare applicants from migrating to California for
three reasons. First, although it is reasonable to assume
that some persons may be motivated to move for the purpose of obtaining higher benefits, the empirical evidence
reviewed by the District Judge, which takes into account
the high cost of living in California, indicates that the number of such persons is quite small--surely not large enough
to justify a burden on those who had no such motive.18 Second, California has represented to the Court that the legislation was not enacted for any such reason.19 Third, even
if it were, as we squarely held in Shapiro v. Thompson, 394
U. S. 618 (1969), such a purpose would be unequivocally
impermissible.

Disavowing any desire to fence out the indigent, California has instead advanced an entirely fiscal justification for
its multitiered scheme. The enforcement of $ 11450.03 will
save the State approximately $10.9 million a year. The
question is not whether such saving is a legitimate purpose
but whether the State may accomplish that end by the discriminatory means it has chosen. An evenhanded, acrossthe-board reduction of about 72 cents per month for every
beneficiary would produce the same result. But our negative answer to the question does not rest on the weakness
of the State's purported fiscal justification. It rests on the
fact that the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment expressly equates citizenship with residence: "That
Clause does not provide for, and does not allow for, degrees of citizenship based on length of residence." Zobel,
457 U. S., at 69. It is equally clear that the Clause does not
tolerate a hierarchy of 45 subclasses of similarly situated

18 App. 21-26.
19 The District Court and the Court of Appeals concluded, however, that

the "apparent purpose of $ 11450.03 was to deter migration of poor people
to California." Roe v. Anderson, 134 F. 3d 1400, 1404 (CA9 1998).

Opinion of the Court
citizens based on the location of their prior residence.20Thus $ 11450.03 is doubly vulnerable: Neither the duration

of respondents' California residence, nor the identity of theirprior States of residence, has any relevance to their need for
benefits. Nor do those factors bear any relationship to theState's interest in making an equitable allocation of the funds
to be distributed among its needy citizens. As in Shapiro,we reject any contributory rationale for the denial of benefits
to new residents:

"But we need not rest on the particular facts of thesecases. Appellants' reasoning would logically permit the

State to bar new residents from schools, parks, and li-braries or deprive them of police and fire protection.
Indeed it would permit the State to apportion all bene-fits and services according to the past tax contributions
of its citizens." 394 U. S., at 632-633.
See also Zobel, 457 U. S., at 64. In short, the State's legiti-mate interest in saving money provides no justification for

its decision to discriminate among equally eligible citizens.

VI
The question that remains is whether congressional ap-proval of durational residency requirements in the 1996

amendment to the Social Security Act somehow resuscitatesthe constitutionality of $ 11450.03. That question is readily
answered, for we have consistently held that Congress maynot authorize the States to violate the Fourteenth Amendment.21 Moreover, the protection afforded to the citizen by

20 See Cohen, Discrimination Against New State Citizens: An Update,
11 Const. Comm. 73, 79 (1994) ("[J]ust as it would violate the Constitution
to deny these new arrivals state citizenship, it would violate the Constitution to concede their citizenship in name only while treating them as
if they were still citizens of other states").

21 " `Congress is without power to enlist state cooperation in a joint

federal-state program by legislation which authorizes the States to violate
the Equal Protection Clause.' Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U. S. 618, 641
(1969)." Townsend v. Swank, 404 U. S. 282, 291 (1971).

508 SAENZ v. ROE

Opinion of the Court
the Citizenship Clause of that Amendment is a limitation on
the powers of the National Government as well as the States.

Article I of the Constitution grants Congress broad power
to legislate in certain areas. Those legislative powers are,
however, limited not only by the scope of the Framers' affirmative delegation, but also by the principle "that they
may not be exercised in a way that violates other specific
provisions of the Constitution. For example, Congress is
granted broad power to `lay and collect Taxes,' but the
taxing power, broad as it is, may not be invoked in such a
way as to violate the privilege against self-incrimination."
Williams v. Rhodes, 393 U. S. 23, 29 (1968) (footnote omitted). Congress has no affirmative power to authorize the
States to violate the Fourteenth Amendment and is implicitly prohibited from passing legislation that purports to
validate any such violation.

"Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment gives Congress broad power indeed to enforce the command of the
amendment and `to secure to all persons the enjoyment
of perfect equality of civil rights and the equal protection of the laws against State denial or invasion. . . .'
Ex parte Virginia, 100 U. S. 339, 346 (1880). Congress'
power under $ 5, however, `is limited to adopting measures to enforce the guarantees of the Amendment; $ 5
grants Congress no power to restrict, abrogate, or dilute
these guarantees.' Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U. S.
641, 651, n. 10 (1966). Although we give deference
to congressional decisions and classifications, neither
Congress nor a State can validate a law that denies
the rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.
See, e. g., Califano v. Goldfarb, 430 U. S. 199, 210 (1977);
Williams v. Rhodes, 393 U. S. 23, 29 (1968)." Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U. S. 718, 732-733

Opinion of the Court
The Solicitor General does not unequivocally defend the
constitutionality of $ 11450.03. But he has argued that two
features of PRWORA may provide a sufficient justification
for state durational requirements to warrant further inquiry before finally passing on the section's validity, or
perhaps that it is only invalid insofar as it applies to new
arrivals who were not on welfare before they arrived in
California.22

He first points out that because the TANF program gives
the States broader discretion than did AFDC, there will
be significant differences among the States which may provide new incentives for welfare recipients to change their
residences. He does not, however, persuade us that the
disparities under the new program will necessarily be any
greater than the differences under AFDC, which included
such examples as the disparity between California's monthly
benefit of $673 for a family of four with Mississippi's benefit of $144 for a comparable family. Moreover, we are not
convinced that a policy of eliminating incentives to move
to California provides a more permissible justification for
classifying California citizens than a policy of imposing special burdens on new arrivals to deter them from moving into
the State. Nor is the discriminatory impact of $ 11450.03
abated by repeatedly characterizing it as "a sort of specialized choice-of-law rule." 23 California law alone discriminates among its own citizens on the basis of their prior
residence.

The Solicitor General also suggests that we should recognize the congressional concern addressed in the legislative
history of PRWORA that the "States might engage in a `race
to the bottom' in setting the benefit levels in their TANF

Opinion of the Court
programs." 24 Again, it is difficult to see why that concernshould be any greater under TANF than under AFDC. The

evidence reviewed by the District Court indicates that thesavings resulting from the discriminatory policy, if spread
equitably throughout the entire program, would have only aminiscule impact on benefit levels. Indeed, as one of the
legislators apparently interpreted this concern, it would logi-cally prompt the States to reduce benefit levels sufficiently
"to encourage emigration of benefit recipients." 25 But spec-ulation about such an unlikely eventuality provides no basis
for upholding $ 11450.03.Finally, the Solicitor General suggests that the State's
discrimination might be acceptable if California had limitedthe disfavored subcategories of new citizens to those who
had received aid in their prior State of residence at any timewithin the year before their arrival in California. The suggestion is ironic for at least three reasons: It would imposethe most severe burdens on the neediest members of the
disfavored classes; it would significantly reduce the savingsthat the State would obtain, thus making the State's claimed
justification even less tenable; and, it would confine the effectof the statute to what the Solicitor General correctly characterizes as "the invidious purpose of discouraging poor peoplegenerally from settling in the State."

Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice Thomasjoins, dissenting.

The Court today breathes new life into the previously dor-mant Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment--a Clause relied upon by this Court in only oneother decision, Colgate v. Harvey, 296 U. S. 404 (1935), overruled five years later by Madden v. Kentucky, 309 U. S. 83(1940). It uses this Clause to strike down what I believe
is a reasonable measure falling under the head of a "good-faith residency requirement." Because I do not think any
provision of the Constitution--and surely not a provisionrelied upon for only the second time since its enactment 130
years ago--requires this result, I dissent.

free interstate passage of citizens. The state law in Edwards v. California, 314 U. S. 160 (1941), which prohibited
the transport of any indigent person into California, was aclassic barrier to travel or migration and the Court rightly

struck it down. Indeed, for most of this country's history,
what the Court today calls the first "component" of the rightto travel,

ante, at 500, was the entirety of this right. As
Chief Justice Taney stated in his dissent in the Passenger
Cases, 7 How. 283 (1849):

"We are all citizens of the United States; and, as members of the same community, must have the right to
pass and repass through every part of it without inter-ruption, as freely as in our own States. And a tax imposed by a State for entering its territories or harboursis inconsistent with the rights which belong to the citizens of other States as members of the Union, and withthe objects which that Union was intended to attain.
Such a power in the States could produce nothing but
discord and mutual irritation, and they very clearly donot possess it."

Id., at 492.

See also Crandall v. Nevada, 6 Wall. 35, 44 (1868); Williams
v. Fears, 179 U. S. 270, 274 (1900); Memorial Hospital v.
Maricopa County, 415 U. S. 250, 280-283 (1974) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) (collecting and discussing cases). The
Court wisely holds that because Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code Ann.$ 11450.03 (West Supp. 1999) imposes no obstacle to respondents' entry into California, the statute does not infringe uponthe right to travel. See

ante, at 501. Thus, the traditional
conception of the right to travel is simply not an issue in
this case.

I also have no difficulty with aligning the right to travel
with the protections afforded by the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV, $ 2, to nonresidents who enter
other States "intending to return home at the end of [their]
journey." See ante, at 501. Nonresident visitors of other

States should not be subject to discrimination solely be-cause they live out of State. See Paul v. Virginia, 8 Wall.

168 (1869); Hicklin v. Orbeck, 437 U. S. 518 (1978). Like thetraditional right-to-travel guarantees discussed above, however, this Clause has no application here, because respond-ents expressed a desire to stay in California and become
citizens of that State. Respondents therefore plainly falloutside the protections of Article IV, $ 2.

Finally, I agree with the proposition that a "citizen of theUnited States can, of his own volition, become a citizen of
any State of the Union by a bona^ fide residence therein, with
the same rights as other citizens of that State." SlaughterHouse Cases, 16 Wall. 36, 80 (1873).But I cannot see how the right to become a citizen of another State is a necessary "component" of the right to travel,or why the Court tries to marry these separate and distinct
rights. A person is no longer "traveling" in any sense ofthe word when he finishes his journey to a State which he
plans to make his home. Indeed, under the Court's logic,the protections of the Privileges or Immunities Clause recognized in this case come into play only when an individual stops traveling with the intent to remain and become acitizen of a new State. The right to travel and the right to

become a citizen are distinct, their relationship is not recip-rocal, and one is not a "component" of the other. Indeed,
the same dicta from the Slaughter-House Cases quoted bythe Court actually treat the right to become a citizen and
the right to travel as separate and distinct rights under thePrivileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. See id., at 79-80.1 At most, restrictions on an indi1 The Court's decision in the Slaughter-House Cases only confirms my
view that state infringement on the right to travel is limited to the kind
of barrier established in Edwards v. California, 314 U. S. 160 (1941), and
its discussion is worth quoting in full:

"But lest it should be said that no such privileges and immunities are
to be found if those we have been considering are excluded, we venture

vidual's right to become a citizen indirectly affect his calculusin deciding whether to exercise his right to travel in the first

place, but such an attenuated and uncertain relationship isno ground for folding one right into the other.

No doubt the Court has, in the past 30 years, essentiallyconflated the right to travel with the right to equal state
citizenship in striking down durational residence require-ments similar to the one challenged here. See,

e. g., Shapirov. Thompson, 394 U. S. 618 (1969) (striking down 1-year residence before receiving any welfare benefit); Dunn v. Blum-stein, 405 U. S. 330 (1972) (striking down 1-year residence
before receiving the right to vote in state elections); Maricopa County, 415 U. S., at 280-283 (striking down 1-yearcounty residence before receiving entitlement to nonemergency hospitalization or emergency care). These casesmarked a sharp departure from the Court's prior right-totravel cases because in none of them was travel itself prohib-ited. See id., at 254-255 ("Whatever its ultimate scope . . .
the right to travel was involved in only a limited sense in
Shapiro"); Shapiro, supra, at 671-672 (Harlan, J., dissenting).Instead, the Court in these cases held that restricting the

provision of welfare benefits, votes, or certain medical beneto suggest some which own their existence to the Federal government, its
National character, its Constitution, or its laws.

"One of these is well described in the case of Crandall v. Nevada[, 6
Wall. 35 (1868)]. It is said to be the right of the citizen of this great
country, protected by implied guarantees of its Constitution, `to come to
the seat of government to assert any claim he may have upon that government, to transact any business he may have with it, to seek its protection,
to share its offices, to engage in administering its functions. He has the
right of free access to its seaports, through which all operations of foreign
commerce are conducted, to the subtreasuries, land offices, and courts of
justice in the several States.' And quoting from the language of Chief
Justice Taney in another case, it is said `that for all the great purposes for
which the Federal government was established, we are one people, with
one common country, we are all citizens of the United States;' and it is, as
such citizens, that their rights are supported in this court in Crandall v.
Nevada." 16 Wall., at 79 (footnote omitted).

fits to new citizens for a limited time impermissibly "penal-ized" them under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment for having exercised their right to travel.See Maricopa County, supra, at 257. The Court thus settled for deciding what restrictions amounted to "depriva-tions of very important benefits and rights" that operated
to indirectly "penalize" the right to travel. See Attorney
General of N. Y. v. Soto-Lopez, 476 U. S. 898, 907 (1986) (plu-rality opinion). In other cases, the Court recognized that

laws dividing new and old residents had little to do with theright to travel and merely triggered an inquiry into whether
the resulting classification rationally furthered a legitimategovernment purpose. See

Zobel v. Williams, 457 U. S. 55,60, n. 6 (1982); Hooper v. Bernalillo County Assessor, 472

U. S. 612, 618 (1985).2 While Zobel and Hooper reached thewrong result in my view, they at least put the Court on the
proper track in identifying exactly what interests it wasprotecting; namely, the right of individuals not to be subject
to unjustifiable classifications as opposed to infringementson the right to travel.

The Court today tries to clear much of the underbrushcreated by these prior right-to-travel cases, abandoning its
effort to define what residence requirements deprive indi-viduals of "important rights and benefits" or "penalize" the
right to travel. See ante, at 504-507. Under its new ana-lytical framework, a State, outside certain ill-defined circumstances, cannot classify its citizens by the length oftheir residence in the State without offending the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.The Court thus departs from

Shapiro and its progeny, and,while paying lipservice to the right to travel, the Court does

little to explain how the right to travel is involved at all.
Instead, as the Court's analysis clearly demonstrates, see
ante, at 504-507, this case is only about respondents' right
to immediately enjoy all the privileges of being a California
citizen in relation to that State's ability to test the goodfaith assertion of this right. The Court has thus come full
circle by effectively disavowing the analysis of Shapiro,
segregating the right to travel and the rights secured by
Article IV from the right to become a citizen under the Privileges or Immunities Clause, and then testing the residence
requirement here against this latter right. For all its misplaced efforts to fold the right to become a citizen into the
right to travel, the Court has essentially returned to its original understanding of the right to travel.

II
In unearthing from its tomb the right to become a state
citizen and to be treated equally in the new State of residence, however, the Court ignores a State's need to assure
that only persons who establish a bona fide residence receive
the benefits provided to current residents of the State. The
Slaughter-House dicta at the core of the Court's analysis
specifically condition a United States citizen's right to "become a citizen of any state of the Union" and to enjoy the
"same rights as other citizens of that State" on the establishment of a "bona^ fide residence therein." 16 Wall., at 80
(emphasis added). Even when redefining the right to travel
in Shapiro and its progeny, the Court has "always carefully
distinguished between bona fide residence requirements,
which seek to differentiate between residents and nonresidents, and residence requirements, such as durational,
fixed date, and fixed point residence requirements, which
treat established residents differently based on the time
they migrated into the State." Soto-Lopez, supra, at 903,
n. 3 (citing cases).

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
Thus, the Court has consistently recognized that whilenew citizens must have the same opportunity to enjoy the

privileges of being a citizen of a State, the States retainthe ability to use bona fide residence requirements to ferret
out those who intend to take the privileges and run. As
this Court explained in Martinez v. Bynum, 461 U. S. 321,328-329 (1983): "A bona fide residence requirement, appropriately defined and uniformly applied, furthers the sub-stantial state interest in assuring that services provided for
its residents are enjoyed only by residents. . . . A bona fideresidence requirement simply requires that the person

does
establish residence before demanding the services that are
restricted to residents." The Martinez Court explained
that "residence" requires "both physical presence and an intention to remain," see id., at 330, and approved a Texas
law that restricted eligibility for tuition-free education to
families who met this minimum definition of residence, id.,
at 332-333.

While the physical presence element of a bona fide residence is easy to police, the subjective intent element is not.
It is simply unworkable and futile to require States to inquire into each new resident's subjective intent to remain.
Hence, States employ objective criteria such as durational
residence requirements to test a new resident's resolve to
remain before these new citizens can enjoy certain in-state
benefits. Recognizing the practical appeal of such criteria,
this Court has repeatedly sanctioned the State's use of durational residence requirements before new residents receive
in-state tuition rates at state universities. Starns v. Malkerson, 401 U. S. 985 (1971), summarily aff 'g 326 F. Supp. 234
(Minn. 1970) (upholding 1-year residence requirement for instate tuition); Sturgis v. Washington, 414 U. S. 1057, summarily aff 'g 368 F. Supp. 38 (WD Wash. 1973) (same). The
Court has declared: "The State can establish such reasonable
criteria for in-state status as to make virtually certain that
students who are not, in fact, bona fide residents of the State,

but have come there solely for educational purposes, cannottake advantage of the in-state rates."

Vlandis v. Kline, 412
U. S. 441, 453-454 (1973). The Court has done the same inupholding a 1-year residence requirement for eligibility to

obtain a divorce in state courts, see Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U. S.
393, 406-409 (1975), and in upholding political party registra-tion restrictions that amounted to a durational residency

requirement for voting in primary elections, see Rosariov.

Rockefeller, 410 U. S. 752, 760-762 (1973).
If States can require individuals to reside in-state for ayear before exercising the right to educational benefits, the

right to terminate a marriage, or the right to vote in primary elections that all other state citizens enjoy, then States
may surely do the same for welfare benefits. Indeed, there
is no material difference between a 1-year residence requirement applied to the level of welfare benefits given
out by a State, and the same requirement applied to the level
of tuition subsidies at a state university. The welfare payment here and in-state tuition rates are cash subsidies provided to a limited class of people, and California's standard
of living and higher education system make both subsidies
quite attractive. Durational residence requirements were
upheld when used to regulate the provision of higher education subsidies, and the same deference should be given in
the case of welfare payments. See Dandridge v. Williams,
397 U. S. 471, 487 (1970) ("[T]he Constitution does not empower this Court to second-guess state officials charged with
the difficult responsibility of allocating limited public welfare
funds among the myriad of potential recipients").

The Court today recognizes that States retain the ability
to determine the bona fides of an individual's claim to residence, see ante, at 505, but then tries to avoid the issue. It
asserts that because respondents' need for welfare benefits is unrelated to the length of time they have resided in
California, it has "no occasion to consider what weight might
be given to a citizen's length of residence if the bona fides of

526US2 Unit: $U53 [12-11-00 20:00:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN

519Cite as: 526 U. S. 489 (1999)
Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
her claim to state citizenship were questioned." See ibid.But I do not understand how the absence of a link between

need and length of residency bears on the State's ability toobjectively test respondents' resolve to stay in California.
There is no link between the need for an education or for a
divorce and the length of residence, and yet States may uselength of residence as an objective yardstick to channel their

benefits to those whose intent to stay is legitimate.In one respect, the State has a greater need to require
a durational residence for welfare benefits than for collegeeligibility. The impact of a large number of new residents
who immediately seek welfare payments will have a far
greater impact on a State's operating budget than the impact of new residents seeking to attend a state university.
In the case of the welfare recipients, a modest durational
residence requirement to allow for the completion of an annual legislative budget cycle gives the State time to decide
how to finance the increased obligations.

The Court tries to distinguish education and divorce benefits by contending that the welfare payment here will be consumed in California, while a college education or a divorce
produces benefits that are "portable" and can be enjoyed
after individuals return to their original domicile. Ibid.
But this "you can't take it with you" distinction is more
apparent than real, and offers little guidance to lower courts
who must apply this rationale in the future. Welfare payments are a form of insurance, giving impoverished individuals and their families the means to meet the demands
of daily life while they receive the necessary training, education, and time to look for a job. The cash itself will no doubt
be spent in California, but the benefits from receiving this
income and having the opportunity to become employed or
employable will stick with the welfare recipients if they stay
in California or go back to their true domicile. Similarly,
tuition subsidies are "consumed" in-state but the recipient
takes the benefits of a college education with him wherever

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
he goes. A welfare subsidy is thus as much an investmentin human capital as is a tuition subsidy, and their attendant benefits are just as "portable." 3 More importantly, thisforay into social economics demonstrates that the line drawn
by the Court borders on the metaphysical, and requireslower courts to plumb the policies animating certain benefits
like welfare to define their "essence" and hence their "portability." As this Court wisely recognized almost 30 yearsago, "[t]he intractable economic, social, and even philosophical problems presented by public welfare assistance pro-grams are not the business of this Court."

Dandridge,
supra, at 487.I therefore believe that the durational residence requirement challenged here is a permissible exercise of the State's
power to "assur[e] that services provided for its residentsare enjoyed only by residents."

Martinez, 461 U. S., at 328.
The 1-year period established in $ 11450.03 is the same period this Court approved in Starns and Sosa. The requirement does not deprive welfare recipients of all benefits; indeed, the limitation has no effect whatsoever on a recipient's
ability to enjoy the full 5-year period of welfare eligibility;
to enjoy the full range of employment, training, and accompanying supportive services; or to take full advantage of
health care benefits under Medicaid. See Brief for Petitioners 7-8, 27. This waiting period does not preclude new residents from all cash payments, but merely limits them to what
they received in their prior State of residence. Moreover,
as the Court recognizes, see ante, at 497, any pinch resulting
from this limitation during the 1-year period is mitigated by
other programs such as homeless assistance and an increase
in food stamp allowance. The 1-year period thus permissibly balances the new resident's needs for subsistence with
the State's need to ensure the bona fides of their claim to
residence.

3 The same analysis applies to divorce.

Thomas, J., dissenting
Finally, Congress' express approval in 42 U. S. C. $ 604(c)of durational residence requirements for welfare recipients

like the one established by California only goes to show thereasonableness of a law like $ 11450.03. The National Legislature, where people from Mississippi as well as California
are represented, has recognized the need to protect stateresources in a time of experimentation and welfare reform.

As States like California revamp their total welfare pack-ages, see Brief for Petitioners 5-6, they should have the authority and flexibility to ensure that their new programs arenot exploited. Congress has decided that it makes good welfare policy to give the States this power. California has rea-sonably exercised it through an objective, narrowly tailored
residence requirement. I see nothing in the Constitution
that should prevent the enforcement of that requirement.

Justice Thomas, with whom The Chief Justice joins,
dissenting.

I join The Chief Justice's dissent. I write separately to
address the majority's conclusion that California has violated
"the right of the newly arrived citizen to the same privileges
and immunities enjoyed by other citizens of the same State."
Ante, at 502. In my view, the majority attributes a meaning
to the Privileges or Immunities Clause that likely was unintended when the Fourteenth Amendment was enacted
and ratified.

The Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment provides that "[n]o State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States." U. S. Const.,
Amdt. 14, $ 1. Unlike the Equal Protection and Due Process
Clauses, which have assumed near-talismanic status in
modern constitutional law, the Court all but read the Privileges or Immunities Clause out of the Constitution in the
Slaughter-House Cases, 16 Wall. 36 (1873). There, the
Court held that the State of Louisiana had not abridged

Thomas, J., dissenting
the Privileges or Immunities Clause by granting a partial
monopoly of the slaughtering business to one company. Id.,
at 59-63, 66. The Court reasoned that the Privileges or
Immunities Clause was not intended "as a protection to the
citizen of a State against the legislative power of his own
State." Id., at 74. Rather the "privileges or immunities of
citizens" guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment were
limited to those "belonging to a citizen of the United States
as such." Id., at 75. The Court declined to specify the
privileges or immunities that fell into this latter category,
but it made clear that few did. See id., at 76 (stating that
"nearly every civil right for the establishment and protection of which organized government is instituted," including
"those rights which are fundamental," are not protected by
the Clause).

Unlike the majority, I would look to history to ascertain
the original meaning of the Clause.1 At least in American
law, the phrase (or its close approximation) appears to stem

1 Legal scholars agree on little beyond the conclusion that the Clause
does not mean what the Court said it meant in 1873. See, e. g., Harrison,

The colonists' repeated assertions that they maintainedthe rights, privileges, and immunities of persons "born

within the realm of England" and "natural born" personssuggests that, at the time of the founding, the terms "privileges" and "immunities" (and their counterparts) were un-derstood to refer to those fundamental rights and liberties
specifically enjoyed by English citizens and, more broadly,by all persons. Presumably members of the Second Continental Congress so understood these terms when they em-ployed them in the Articles of Confederation, which guaranteed that "the free inhabitants of each of these States,
paupers, vagabonds and fugitives from justice excepted, shall
be entitled to all privileges and immunities of free citizensin the several States." Art. IV. The Constitution, which

superceded the Articles of Confederation, similarly guaran-tees that "[t]he Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all
Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States."Art. IV, $ 2, cl. 1.

Justice Bushrod Washington's landmark opinion in Corfield v. Coryell, 6 F. Cas. 546 (No. 3,230) (CCED Pa. 1825),
reflects this historical understanding. In Corfield, a citizen
of Pennsylvania challenged a New Jersey law that pro-hibited any person who was not an "actual inhabitant and

resident" of New Jersey from harvesting oysters from NewJersey waters.

Id., at 550. Justice Washington, sitting as
Circuit Justice, rejected the argument that the New Jerseylaw violated Article IV's Privileges and Immunities Clause.

He reasoned, "we cannot accede to the proposition . . . that,under this provision of the constitution, the citizens of the
several states are permitted to participate in all the rights

which belong exclusively to the citizens of any other par-ticular state, merely upon the ground that they are enjoyed by those citizens." Id., at 552. Instead, Washingtonconcluded:

"We feel no hesitation in confining these expressions tothose privileges and immunities which are, in their nature, fundamental; which belong, of right, to the citizensof all free governments; and which have, at all times,
been enjoyed by the citizens of the several states whichcompose this Union, from the time of their becoming
free, independent, and sovereign. What these fundamental principles are, it would perhaps be more tediousthan difficult to enumerate. They may, however, be all

comprehended under the following general heads: Pro-tection by the government; the enjoyment of life and
liberty, with the right to acquire and possess propertyof every kind, and to pursue and obtain happiness and
safety; subject nevertheless to such restraints as the
government may justly prescribe for the general goodof the whole. The right of a citizen of one state to pass

through, or to reside in any other state, for purposes oftrade, agriculture, professional pursuits, or otherwise;
to claim the benefit of the writ of habeas corpus; to insti-tute and maintain actions of any kind in the courts of
the state; . . . and an exemption from higher taxes orimpositions than are paid by the other citizens of the
state; . . . the elective franchise, as regulated and established by the laws or constitution of the state in whichit is to be exercised. These, and many others which

might be mentioned, are, strictly speaking, privileges
and immunities." Id., at 551-552.

Washington rejected the proposition that the Privileges
and Immunities Clause guaranteed equal access to all public
benefits (such as the right to harvest oysters in public waters) that a State chooses to make available. Instead, he

endorsed the colonial-era conception of the terms "privi-leges" and "immunities," concluding that Article IV encompassed only fundamental rights that belong to all citizens ofthe United States.

4 Id., at 552.

Justice Washington's opinion in Corfield indisputably in-fluenced the Members of Congress who enacted the Fourteenth Amendment. When Congress gathered to debatethe Fourteenth Amendment, Members frequently, if not
as a matter of course, appealed to Corfield, arguing thatthe Amendment was necessary to guarantee the fundamental rights that Justice Washington identified in his opinion.See Harrison, Reconstructing the Privileges or Immunities
Clause, 101 Yale L. J. 1385, 1418 (1992) (referring to a Mem-ber's "obligatory quotation from Corfield"). For just one
example, in a speech introducing the Amendment to theSenate, Senator Howard explained the Privileges or Immunities Clause by quoting at length from Corfield.5 Cong.Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 2765 (1866). Furthermore, it
appears that no Member of Congress refuted the notion thatWashington's analysis in Corfield undergirded the meaning
of the Privileges or Immunities Clause.6

4 During the first half of the 19th century, a number of legal scholars and
state courts endorsed Washington's conclusion that the Clause protected
only fundamental rights. See, e. g., Campbell v. Morris, 3 H. & McH. 535,
554 (Md. 1797) (Chase, J.) (Clause protects property and personal rights);
Douglass v. Stephens, 1 Del. Ch. 465, 470 (1821) (Clause protects the "absolute rights" that "all men by nature have"); 2 J. Kent, Commentaries on
American Law 71-72 (1836) (Clause "confined to those [rights] which were,
in their nature, fundamental"). See generally Antieau, Paul's Perverted
Privileges or the True Meaning of the Privileges and Immunities Clause
of Article Four, 9 Wm. & Mary L. Rev. 1, 18-21 (1967) (collecting sources).

5 He also observed that, while the Supreme Court had not "undertaken

to define either the nature or extent of the privileges and immunities,"
Washington's opinion gave "some intimation of what probably will be the
opinion of the judiciary." Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 2765 (1866).

6 During debates on the Civil Rights Act of 1866, Members of Congress

also repeatedly invoked Corfield to support the legislation. See generally

That Members of the 39th Congress appear to have en-dorsed the wisdom of Justice Washington's opinion does

not, standing alone, provide dispositive insight into theirunderstanding of the Fourteenth Amendment's Privileges
or Immunities Clause. Nevertheless, their repeated refer-ences to the

Corfield decision, combined with what ap-pears to be the historical understanding of the Clause's

operative terms, supports the inference that, at the timethe Fourteenth Amendment was adopted, people understood
that "privileges or immunities of citizens" were fundamen-tal rights, rather than every public benefit established by
positive law. Accordingly, the majority's conclusion--that aState violates the Privileges or Immunities Clause when it
"discriminates" against citizens who have been domiciled inthe State for less than a year in the distribution of welfare
benefits--appears contrary to the original understandingand is dubious at best.

As The Chief Justice points out, ante, at 511, it comesas quite a surprise that the majority relies on the Privileges
or Immunities Clause at all in this case. That is because, asI have explained supra, at 521-522, the Slaughter-House
Cases sapped the Clause of any meaning. Although the ma-jority appears to breathe new life into the Clause today, it
fails to address its historical underpinnings or its place inour constitutional jurisprudence. Because I believe that the
demise of the Privileges or Immunities Clause has contrib-uted in no small part to the current disarray of our FourSenator Trumbull, quoting from Corfield, explained that the legislation
protected the "fundamental rights belonging to every man as a free man,
and which under the Constitution as it now exists we have a right to
protect every man in." Cong. Globe, supra, at 476. The Civil Rights Act
is widely regarded as the precursor to the Fourteenth Amendment. See,
e. g., J. tenBroek, Equal Under Law 201 (rev. ed. 1965) ("The one point
upon which historians of the Fourteenth Amendment agree, and, indeed,
which the evidence places beyond cavil, is that the Fourteenth Amendment was designed to place the constitutionality of the Freedmen's Bureau
and civil rights bills, particularly the latter, beyond doubt").

teenth Amendment jurisprudence, I would be open to reeval-uating its meaning in an appropriate case. Before invoking

the Clause, however, we should endeavor to understand whatthe Framers of the Fourteenth Amendment thought that it
meant. We should also consider whether the Clause shoulddisplace, rather than augment, portions of our equal protection and substantive due process jurisprudence. The major-ity's failure to consider these important questions raises the
specter that the Privileges or Immunities Clause will becomeyet another convenient tool for inventing new rights, limited
solely by the "predilections of those who happen at the timeto be Members of this Court."

529OCTOBER TERM, 1998
Syllabus

CLINTON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,

et al. v. GOLDSMITH

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe armed forces

No. 98-347. Argued March 22, 1999--Decided May 17, 1999
After respondent Goldsmith, an Air Force major, defied an order by a

superior officer to inform his sex partners that he was infected with
HIV and to take measures to block any transfer of bodily fluids during
sexual relations, he was convicted by general court-martial of willful
disobedience of an order and other offenses under the Uniform Code
of Military Justice and sentenced to six years' confinement and partial
forfeiture of pay. The Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed,
and when Goldsmith sought no review of that decision in the Court
of Appeals for the Armed Forces (CAAF), his conviction became final.
Subsequently, in reliance on a newly enacted statute empowering the
President to drop from the rolls of the Armed Forces any officer who
had both been sentenced by a court-martial to more than six months'
confinement and served at least six months, the Air Force notified
Goldsmith that it was taking action to drop him from the rolls. Goldsmith did not immediately contest that proposal, but rather petitioned
the Court of Criminal Appeals for extraordinary relief to redress the
unrelated alleged interruption of his HIV medication during his incarceration. The court ruled that it lacked jurisdiction to act, and it
was in Goldsmith's appeal from that determination that he first asserted
the claim that the Air Force's action to drop him violated the Ex Post
Facto and Double Jeopardy Clauses. The CAAF granted his petition
for extraordinary relief and relied on the All Writs Act in enjoining
the President and other officials from dropping Goldsmith from the Air
Force rolls.

Held: Because the CAAF's process was neither "in aid of" its strictly

circumscribed jurisdiction to review court-martial findings and sentences nor "necessary" or "appropriate" in light of a servicemember's
alternative opportunities to seek relief, that court lacked jurisdiction
to issue an injunction against dropping respondent from the Air Force
rolls. Pp. 533-540.

(a) The All Writs Act authorizes "all courts established by Act of
Congress [to] issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their
respective jurisdictions." 28 U. S. C. $ 1651(a). Although military appellate courts are among those so empowered to issue extraordinary
writs, see Noyd v. Bond, 395 U. S. 683, 695, n. 7, the All Writs Act

does not enlarge those courts' power to issue process "in aid of" their
existing statutory jurisdiction, see, e. g., Pennsylvania Bureau of Correction v. United States Marshals Service, 474 U. S. 34, 41. The CAAF
is accorded jurisdiction by statute to "review the record in [specified]
cases reviewed by" the service courts of criminal appeals, 10 U. S. C.

$$ 867(a)(2), (3), which in turn have jurisdiction to "revie[w] courtmartial cases," $ 866(a). Since the Air Force's action to drop respondent
from the rolls was an executive action, not a "findin[g]" or "sentence,"

$ 867(c), that was (or could have been) imposed in a court-martial proceeding, the elimination of Goldsmith from the rolls appears straightforwardly to have been beyond the CAAF's jurisdiction to review and
hence beyond the "aid" of the All Writs Act in reviewing it. Goldsmith's claim that the CAAF has satisfied the "aid" requirement because
it protected and effectuated the sentence meted out by the court-martial
is beside the point, for two related reasons. First, his court-martial
sentence has not been changed; another military agency has simply
taken independent action. Second, the CAAF is not given authority,
by the All Writs Act or any other source, to oversee all matters arguably
related to military justice, or to act as a plenary administrator even
of criminal judgments it has affirmed. The CAAF spoke too expansively when it asserted that Congress intended it to have such broad
responsibility. Pp. 533-537.

(b) Even if the CAAF had some seriously arguable basis for jurisdiction in these circumstances, resort to the All Writs Act would still
be out of bounds, being unjustifiable either as "necessary" or as "appropriate" in light of alternative remedies available to a servicemember
demanding to be kept on the rolls. The All Writs Act invests a court
with a power essentially equitable and, as such, not generally available
to provide alternatives to other, adequate remedies at law. See, e. g.,
Carlisle v. United States, 517 U. S. 416, 429. This limitation operates
here, since the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records
(BCMR) has authority to provide administrative review of the action
challenged by respondent, and a servicemember claiming something
other than monetary relief may challenge the BCMR's decision to sustain a decision to drop him from the rolls (or otherwise dismiss him)
as final agency action under the Administrative Procedure Act. Moreover, in instances in which a claim for monetary relief may be framed,
a servicemember may enter the Court of Federal Claims with a challenge to dropping from the rolls (or other discharge) under the Tucker
Act, or he may enter a district court under the "Little Tucker Act."

Opinion of the Court
Deputy Solicitor General Dreeben argued the cause forpetitioners. With him on the briefs were Solicitor General

Waxman, James A. Feldman, Lisa Schiavo Blatt, and Ju-dith A. Miller.

John M. Economidy argued the cause for respondent.With him on the brief were

Carol L. Hubbard, Karen L.Hecker, and Douglas H. Kohrt.

Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.
The challenge here is to the use of the All Writs Act, 28U. S. C. $ 1651(a), by the Court of Appeals for the Armed

Forces, to enjoin the President and various military officialsfrom dropping respondent from the rolls of the Air Force.
Because that court's process was neither "in aid of " itsstrictly circumscribed jurisdiction to review court-martial
findings and sentences under 10 U. S. C. $ 867 nor "necessaryor appropriate" in light of a servicemember's alternative
opportunities to seek relief, we hold that the Court of Ap-peals for the Armed Forces lacked jurisdiction to issue the
injunction. I

Respondent James Goldsmith, a major in the UnitedStates Air Force, was ordered by a superior officer to inform
his sex partners that he was HIV-positive and to take meas-ures to block any transfer of bodily fluids during sexual relations. Contrary to this order, on two occasions Goldsmithhad unprotected intercourse, once with a fellow officer and
once with a civilian, without informing either that he wascarrying HIV.

As a consequence of his defiance, Goldsmith was convictedby general court-martial of willful disobedience of an order
from a superior commissioned officer, aggravated assaultwith means likely to produce death or grievous bodily harm,
and assault consummated by battery, in violation of Articles90 and 128 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ),
10 U. S. C. $$ 890, 928(b)(1), (a). In 1994, he was sentencedto six years' confinement and forfeiture of $2,500 of his pay

each month for six years. The Air Force Court of Criminal
Appeals affirmed his conviction and sentence in 1995, and
when he sought no review of that decision in the United
States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces (CAAF), his
conviction became final, see $ 871(c)(1)(A).

In 1996, Congress expanded the President's authority by
empowering him to drop from the rolls of the Armed Forces
any officer who had both been sentenced by a court-martial
to more than six months' confinement and served at least six
months.1 See National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal
Year 1996, 110 Stat. 325, 10 U. S. C. $$ 1161(b)(2), 1167 (1994
ed., Supp. III).2 In reliance on this statutory authorization,
the Air Force notified Goldsmith in 1996 that it was taking
action to drop him from the rolls.

Goldsmith did not immediately contest the proposal to
drop him, but rather petitioned the Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals for extraordinary relief under the All Writs Act,
28 U. S. C. $ 1651(a), to redress the unrelated alleged inter1 When a servicemember is dropped from the rolls, he forfeits his military pay. See 37 U. S. C. $ 803. The drop-from-the-rolls remedy targets
a narrow category of servicemembers who are absent without leave
(AWOL) or else have been convicted of serious crimes. Since 1870, the
President has had authority to drop from the rolls of the Army any officer
who has been AWOL for at least three months. See Act of July 15, 1870,

$ 17, 16 Stat. 319. The power was subsequently extended to officers confined in prison after final conviction by a civil court, see Act of Jan. 19,
1911, ch. 22, 36 Stat. 894, and then to "any armed force" officer AWOL for
at least three months or else finally sentenced to confinement in a federal
or state penitentiary or correctional institution, see Act of May 5, 1950,

$ 10, 64 Stat. 146.

2 Section 1161(b)(2) authorizes the President to "drop from the rolls of

any armed force any commissioned officer . . . who may be separated under
Section 1167 of this title by reason of a sentence to confinement adjudged
by a court-martial." Section 1167 provides that "a member sentenced by
a court-martial to a period of confinement for more than six months may
be separated from the member's armed force at any time after the sentence to confinement has become final . . . and the member has served in
confinement for a period of six months."

ruption of his HIV medication during his incarceration.The Court of Criminal Appeals ruled that it lacked jurisdiction to act, and it was in Goldsmith's appeal from thatdetermination that he took the first steps to raise the issue
now before us, an entirely new claim that the Air Force'saction to drop him from the rolls was unconstitutional. He
did not challenge his underlying court-martial conviction(the appeal period for which had expired, see Rule 19(a)(1),
CAAF Rules of Practice and Procedure). But he chargedthat the proposed action violated the

Ex Post Facto Clause,U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 9, cl. 3 (arguing that the statute authorizing it had been enacted after the date of his convic-tion), and the Double Jeopardy Clause, U. S. Const., Amdt. 5
(arguing that the action would inflict successive punishmentbased on the same conduct underlying his first conviction).
48 M. J. 84, 89-90 (CAAF 1998). The CAAF, on a divisionof 3 to 2, granted the petition for extraordinary relief and
relied on the All Writs Act, 28 U. S. C. $ 1651(a), in enjoin-ing the President and various other Executive Branch officials from dropping respondent from the rolls of the AirForce.

denied respondent's writ-appeal petition concerning his medical treatment
claim as moot. See 48 M. J. 84, 87-88 (1998).

As a result of the CAAF's order, respondent has not been dropped from
the rolls, and has returned to active duty status. The Air Force initiated an administrative separation proceeding against respondent, see 10
U. S. C. $ 1181, which has been deferred pending resolution of this case.

Opinion of the Court
v. United States, 510 U. S. 163, 166-169 (1994), it confinedthe court's jurisdiction to the review of specified sentences

imposed by courts-martial: the CAAF has the power to act"only with respect to the findings and sentence as approved
by the [court-martial's] convening authority and as affirmedor set aside as incorrect in law by the Court of Criminal
Appeals." 10 U. S. C. $ 867(c).5 Cf. Parisi v. Davidson, 405U. S. 34, 44 (1972) (Court of Military Appeals lacked express
authority over claim for discharge based on conscientiousobjector status). Despite these limitations, the CAAF asserted jurisdiction and purported to justify reliance on theAll Writs Act in this case on the view that "Congress intended [it] to have broad responsibility with respect to ad-ministration of military justice," 48 M. J., at 86-87,

that Goldsmith urges us to adopt. This we cannot do.While the All Writs Act authorizes employment of extraordinary writs, it confines the authority to the issuanceof process "in aid of " the issuing court's jurisdiction. 28
U. S. C. $ 1651(a) ("[A]ll courts established by Act of Con-gress may issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of
their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usagesand principles of law"). Thus, although military appellate
courts are among those empowered to issue extraordinarywrits under the Act, see

Noyd v. Bond, 395 U. S. 683, 695,n. 7 (1969), the express terms of the Act confine the power

of the CAAF to issuing process "in aid of " its existing statu5 When Congress established the Court of Military Appeals (the CAAF's
predecessor), it similarly confined its jurisdiction to the review of specified
sentences imposed by courts-martial. See Act of May 5, 1950, ch. 169,

of protecting the rights of all servicemembers in court-martial matters."

J. Moore & G. Pratt, Moore's Federal Practice $ 204.02[4]
(3d ed. 1998) ("The All Writs Act cannot enlarge a court's

We have already seen that the CAAF's independent statutory jurisdiction is narrowly circumscribed. To be more
specific, the CAAF is accorded jurisdiction by statute (so far
as it concerns us here) to "review the record in [specified]
cases reviewed by" the service courts of criminal appeals,
10 U. S. C. $$ 867(a)(2), (3), which in turn have jurisdiction
to "revie[w] court-martial cases," $ 866(a). Since the Air
Force's action to drop respondent from the rolls was an executive action, not a "findin[g]" or "sentence," $ 867(c), that
was (or could have been) imposed in a court-martial proceeding,7 the elimination of Goldsmith from the rolls appears
straightforwardly to have been beyond the CAAF's jurisdiction to review and hence beyond the "aid" of the All Writs
Act in reviewing it.

Goldsmith nonetheless claims that the CAAF has satisfied
the "aid" requirement of the Act because it protected and
effectuated the sentence meted out by the court-martial.
Goldsmith emphasizes that the court-martial could have dis7 A court-martial is specifically barred from dismissing or discharging an officer except as in accordance with the UCMJ, which gives it
no authority to drop a servicemember from the rolls. See Rules for
Courts-Martial 1003(b)(9)(A)-(C); Rule 1003(b)(9) ("A court-martial may
not adjudge an administrative separation from the service"). Moreover,
respondent brought the petition against the President, the Secretary
of Defense, and military officials who were not even parties to the

missed him from service, but instead chose to impose onlyconfinement and forfeitures.

8 Hence, he says the CAAF

merely preserved that sentence as the court-martial imposedit, by precluding additional punishment, which would incidentally violate the Ex Post Facto and Double Jeopardy
Clauses. But this is beside the point, for two related rea-sons. First, Goldsmith's court-martial sentence has not

been changed; another military agency has simply takenindependent action.

9 It would presumably be an entirely

different matter if a military authority attempted to alter ajudgment by revising a court-martial finding and sentence to

increase the punishment, contrary to the specific provisionsof the UCMJ, and it certainly would be a different matter
when such a judgment had been affirmed by an appellatecourt. In such a case, as the Government concedes, see
Tr. of Oral Arg. 15, 19, 52, the All Writs power would allow
the appellate court to compel adherence to its own judgment.See,

e. g., United States v. United States Dist. Court for
Southern Dist. of N. Y., 334 U. S. 258, 263-264 (1948). Sec-ond, the CAAF is not given authority, by the All Writs Act

or otherwise, to oversee all matters arguably related to mili-tary justice, or to act as a plenary administrator even of
criminal judgments it has affirmed. Simply stated, there isno source of continuing jurisdiction for the CAAF over all
actions administering sentences that the CAAF at one time
had the power to review. Thus the CAAF spoke too ex-pansively when it held itself to be "empowered by the All

Writs Act to grant extraordinary relief in a case in which
the court-martial rendered a sentence that constituted an

become final over one year before the Air Force initiated its action to drop
him from the rolls.

Even if the CAAF had some seriously arguable basis forjurisdiction in these circumstances, resort to the All Writs

Act would still be out of bounds, being unjustifiable eitheras "necessary" or as "appropriate" in light of alternative
remedies available to a servicemember demanding to be kepton the rolls.

11 The All Writs Act invests a court with a

power essentially equitable and, as such, not generally avail-able to provide alternatives to other, adequate remedies at

law. See, e. g., Carlisle v. United States, 517 U. S. 416, 429(1996) (" `The All Writs Act is a residual source of authority
to issue writs that are not otherwise covered by statute' "(quoting

Pennsylvania Bureau of Correction, 474 U. S.,at 43)). See also 19 Moore's Federal Practice $ 201.40 ("[A]

writ may not be used . . . when another method of reviewwill suffice"). This limitation operates here, since other ad10 The court, moreover, was simply wrong when it treated itself as a
court of original jurisdiction, see supra, at 535.

11 These remedies are in addition to the review as of right by the military department's Court of Criminal Appeals of any court-martial sentence that includes punitive dismissal or discharge. See 10 U. S. C.

$ 866(b)(1); $ 867(a) (decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeals subject
to discretionary review by the CAAF). And of course, once a criminal
conviction has been finally reviewed within the military system, and a
servicemember in custody has exhausted other avenues provided under
the UCMJ to seek relief from his conviction, see Noyd v. Bond, 395 U. S.
683, 693-699 (1969), he is entitled to bring a habeas corpus petition, see
28 U. S. C. $ 2241(c), claiming that his conviction is affected by a fundamental defect that requires that it be set aside. See, e. g., Burns v. Wilson, 346 U. S. 137, 142 (1953) (opinion of Vinson, C. J.). See also Calley v.

538 CLINTON v. GOLDSMITH

Opinion of the Court
ministrative bodies in the military, and the federal courts,
have authority to provide administrative or judicial review
of the action challenged by respondent.

In response to the notice Goldsmith received that action
was being considered to drop him from the rolls, he presented his claim to the Secretary of the Air Force. See
Tr. of Oral Arg. 4-5. If the Secretary takes final action to
drop him from the rolls (as he has not yet done), Goldsmith
will (as the Government concedes) be entitled to present his
claim to the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records (BCMR). This is a civilian body within the military
service, with broad-ranging authority to review a servicemember's "discharge or dismissal (other than a discharge or
dismissal by sentence of a general court-martial)," 10 U. S. C.

$ 1553(a), or "to correct an error or remove an injustice" in
a military record, $ 1552(a)(1).12

12 Respondent argues nonetheless that seeking BCMR review in his case
would have been futile (especially in light of his life-threatening illness)
since BCMR's lack authority to declare statutes unconstitutional, cannot
consider records of courts-martial and related administrative records (with
two inapplicable exceptions), and are generally " `unresponsive, bureaucratic extensions of the uniformed services,' " Brief for Respondent 16
(quoting H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-450, p. 798 (1996)).

In light of the fact that respondent chose to circumvent BCMR review,
we need not address whether the Air Force BCMR has the power to correct a record that is erroneous as a result of a constitutional violation.
Cf. Guerra v. Scruggs, 942 F. 2d 270, 273 (CA4 1991) ("The [Army BCMR]
has authority to consider claims of constitutional, statutory, and regulatory
violations"); Bois v. Marsh, 801 F. 2d 462, 467 (CADC 1986) ("[Appellant's]
claims based on [the] Constitution, executive orders and Army regulations `could readily have been made within the framework of this intramilitary procedure' " (quoting Chappell v. Wallace, 462 U. S. 296, 303 (1983))).
And while it is true that unless specifically authorized a BCMR may not
correct a court-martial record, see 10 U. S. C. $ 1552(f), it may still consider
the record, especially where, as here, the court-martial record is relevant
in determining the validity of the subsequent dropping from the rolls.
Finally, the alleged unresponsive nature of the BCMR's, if true, would in

Opinion of the Court
Respondent may also have recourse to the federal trial
courts. We have previously held, for example, that
"[BCMR] decisions are subject to judicial review [by federal
courts] and can be set aside if they are arbitrary, capricious,
or not based on substantial evidence." Chappell v. Wallace,
462 U. S. 296, 303 (1983). A servicemember claiming something other than monetary relief may challenge a BCMR's
decision to sustain a decision to drop him from the rolls (or
otherwise dismissing him) as final agency action under the
Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U. S. C. $ 551 et seq.;
see $$ 704, 706. For examples of such challenges entertained in the district courts or courts of appeals, see Roelofs
v. Secretary of Air Force, 628 F. 2d 594, 599-601 (CADC
1980) (proceeding in District Court under APA raising due
process challenge to administrative discharge based on conviction of civilian offense); Walker v. Shannon, 848 F. Supp.
250, 251, 254-255 (DC 1994) (suit under APA for review of
Army BCMR decision upholding involuntary separation).
In the instances in which a claim for monetary relief may
be framed, a servicemember may enter the Court of Federal
Claims with a challenge to dropping from the rolls (or other
discharge) under the Tucker Act, 28 U. S. C. $ 1491.13 See,
e. g., Doe v. United States, 132 F. 3d 1430, 1433-1434 (CA
Fed. 1997) (suit for backpay and correction of military records following administrative discharge); Mitchell v. United
States, 930 F. 2d 893, 896-897 (CA Fed. 1991) (suit for backno way alter the fact that BCMR's are legislatively authorized to provide
the relief sought by respondent.

In any event, it is clear as noted in the text that follows that respondent's constitutional objections could have been addressed by the federal
courts.

jurisdiction over nontort claims against the Government for greater than

backpay because within purview of "Little Tucker Act").In sum, executive action to drop respondent from the rolls
falls outside of the CAAF's express statutory jurisdiction,and alternative statutory avenues of relief are available.
The CAAF's injunction against dropping respondent fromthe rolls of the Air Force was neither "in aid of [its] jurisdictio[n]" nor "necessary or appropriate." Accordingly, wereverse the court's judgment.

It is so ordered.

HUNT, GOVERNOR OF NORTH CAROLINA, et al.

v. CROMARTIE et al.

appeal from the united states district court for theeastern district of north carolina

No. 98-85. Argued January 20, 1999--Decided May 17, 1999
After this Court decided, in Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U. S. 899, that North Carolina's Twelfth Congressional District was the product of unconstitutional racial gerrymandering, the State enacted a new districting plan
in 1997. Believing that the new District 12 was also unconstitutional,
appellees filed suit against several state officials to enjoin elections
under the new plan. Before discovery and without an evidentiary hearing, the three-judge District Court granted appellees summary judgment and entered the injunction. From "uncontroverted material
facts," the court concluded that the General Assembly in drawing District 12 had violated the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection
Clause.

Held: Because the General Assembly's motivation was in dispute, this case

was not suitable for summary disposition. Laws classifying citizens
based on race are constitutionally suspect and must be strictly scrutinized. A facially neutral law warrants such scrutiny if it can be proved
that the law was motivated by a racial purpose or object, Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S. 900, 913, or is unexplainable on grounds other than race,
Shaw v. Reno, 509 U. S. 630, 644. Assessing a jurisdiction's motivation
in drawing district lines is a complex endeavor requiring a court to
inquire into all available circumstantial and direct evidence. Arlington
Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U. S. 252, 266.
Appellees here sought to prove their claim through circumstantial evidence. Viewed in toto, that evidence--e. g., maps showing the district's
size, shape, and alleged lack of continuity; and statistical and demographic evidence--tends to support an inference that the State drew
district lines with an impermissible racial motive. Summary judgment,
however, is appropriate only where there is no genuine issue of material
fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
The legislature's motivation is a factual question, and was in dispute.
Appellants asserted that the legislature intended to make a strong Democratic district. They supported that contention with affidavits of two
state legislators and, more important, of an expert who testified that
the relevant data supported a political explanation at least as well as,
and somewhat better than, a racial explanation for the district's lines.

542 HUNT v. CROMARTIE

Syllabus
Accepting the political explanation as true, as the District Court was
required to do in ruling on appellees' summary judgment motion, appellees were not entitled to judgment as a matter of law for a jurisdiction
may engage in constitutional political gerrymandering, even if it so happens that the most loyal Democrats happen to be black Democrats and
even if those responsible for drawing the district are conscious of that
fact. See Bush v. Vera, 517 U. S. 952, 968. In concluding that the State
enacted its districting plan with an impermissible racial motivation, the
District Court either credited appellees' asserted inferences over appellants' or did not give appellants the inference they were due. In any
event, it was error to resolve the disputed fact of intent at the summary
judgment stage. Summary judgment in a plaintiff's favor in a racial
gerrymandering case may be awarded even where the claim is sought
to be proved by circumstantial evidence. But it is inappropriate when
the evidence is susceptible of different interpretations or inferences by
the trier of fact. Pp. 546-554.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.
In this appeal, we must decide whether appellees wereentitled to summary judgment on their claim that North Carolina's Twelfth Congressional District, as established by theState's 1997 congressional redistricting plan, constituted an
unconstitutional racial gerrymander in violation of the EqualProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

I
This is the third time in six years that litigation overNorth Carolina's Twelfth Congressional District has come

before this Court. The first time around, we held that plain-tiffs whose complaint alleged that the State had deliberately
segregated voters into districts on the basis of race withoutcompelling justification stated a claim for relief under the
Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.Shaw v. Reno, 509 U. S. 630, 658 (1993) (Shaw I). After remand, we affirmed the District Court's finding that NorthCarolina's District 12 classified voters by race and further held that the State's reapportionment scheme was notnarrowly tailored to serve a compelling interest.

Shaw v.Hunt, 517 U. S. 899 (1996) (Shaw II).

In response to our decision in Shaw II, the State enacteda new districting plan. See 1997 N. C. Sess. Laws, ch. 11.
A map of the unconstitutional District 12 was set forth inthe Appendix to the opinion of the Court in

Shaw I, supra,and we described it as follows:

"The second majority-black district, District 12, is . . .unusually shaped. It is approximately 160 miles long
and, for much of its length, no wider than the [InNew York University School of Law et al. by Burt Neuborne and Deborah

drivers on [Interstate]-85 sometimes find themselvesin separate districts in one county, only to `trade' districts when they enter the next county. Of the 10 coun-ties through which District 12 passes, 5 are cut into
3 different districts; even towns are divided. At onepoint the district remains contiguous only because it
intersects at a single point with two other districtsbefore crossing over them." 509 U. S., at 635-636
(citations omitted).
The State's 1997 plan altered District 12 in several respects.By any measure, blacks no longer constitute a majority of

District 12: Blacks now account for approximately 47% of thedistrict's total population, 43% of its voting age population,
and 46% of registered voters. App. to Juris. Statement 67a,99a. The new District 12 splits 6 counties as opposed to
10; beginning with Guilford County, the district runs in asouthwestern direction through parts of Forsyth, Davidson, Rowan, Iredell, and Mecklenburg Counties, picking upconcentrations of urban populations in Greensboro and
High Point (both in Guilford), Winston-Salem (Forsyth),and Charlotte (Mecklenburg). (The old District 12 went
through the same six counties but also included portions ofDurham, Orange, and Alamance Counties east of Guilford,
and parts of Gaston County west of Mecklenburg.) Withthese changes, the district retains only 41.6% of its previous
area, id., at 153a, and the distance between its farthest pointshas been reduced to approximately 95 miles,

id., at 105a.But while District 12 is wider and shorter than it was before,

it retains its basic "snakelike" shape and continues to trackInterstate 85. See generally Appendix, infra.

Appellees believed the new District 12, like the old one,to be the product of an unconstitutional racial gerrymander.

Opinion of the Court
They filed suit in the United States District Court for theEastern District of North Carolina against several state

officials in their official capacities seeking to enjoin electionsunder the State's 1997 plan. The parties filed competing
motions for summary judgment and supporting materials,and the three-judge District Court heard argument on the
pending motions, but before either party had conducteddiscovery and without an evidentiary hearing. Over one
judge's dissent, the District Court granted appellees' motionand entered the injunction they sought. 34 F. Supp. 2d 1029
(EDNC 1998). The majority of the court explained that"the uncontroverted material facts" showed that "District 12
was drawn to collect precincts with high racial identifica-tion rather than political identification," that "more heavily
Democratic precincts . . . were bypassed in the drawing ofDistrict 12 and included in the surrounding congressional
districts," and that "[t]he legislature disregarded traditionaldistricting criteria." No. 4:96-CV-104-BO(3) (EDNC, Apr.
14, 1998), App. to Juris. Statement 21a. From these "un-controverted material facts," the District Court concluded
"the General Assembly, in redistricting, used criteria withrespect to District 12 that are facially race driven,"

ibid.,and thereby violated the Equal Protection Clause of the

Fourteenth Amendment, id., at 22a. (Apparently becausethe issue was not litigated, the District Court did not consider whether District 12 was narrowly tailored to serve acompelling interest.)

1 In response to the District Court's decision and order, the State
enacted yet another districting plan, 1998 N. C. Sess. Laws, ch. 2 (codified at
N. C. Gen. Stat. $ 163-201(a) (Supp. 1998)), which revised Districts 5, 6, 9,
10, and 12. Under the State's 1998 plan, no part of Guilford County
is located within District 12 and all of Rowan County falls within the district's borders. The 1998 plan also modified District 12's boundaries in Forsyth, Davidson, and Iredell Counties. See ibid.; see also Cromartie v.
Hunt, No. 4:96-CV-104-BO(3) (EDNC, June 22, 1998), App. to Juris. Statement 178a-179a. The State's 1998 congressional elections were conducted

Opinion of the Court
The state officials filed a notice of appeal. We noted prob-able jurisdiction, 524 U. S. 980 (1998), and now reverse.

II
Our decisions have established that all laws that classifycitizens on the basis of race, including racially gerrymandered districting schemes, are constitutionally suspect andmust be strictly scrutinized.

Constructors, Inc. v. Pen~ a, 515 U. S. 200, 227 (1995). Whenracial classifications are explicit, no inquiry into legislative
purpose is necessary. See Shaw I, 509 U. S., at 642. A fa-cially neutral law, on the other hand, warrants strict scrutiny only if it can be proved that the law was "motivated bya racial purpose or object,"

Miller, supra, at 913, or if it is" `unexplainable on grounds other than race,' " Shaw I, supra,

at 644 (quoting Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing
Development Corp., 429 U. S. 252, 266 (1977)); see also Miller,supra, at 905, 913. The task of assessing a jurisdiction's

motivation, however, is not a simple matter; on the contrary,it is an inherently complex endeavor, one requiring the trial
court to perform a "sensitive inquiry into such circumstantialand direct evidence of intent as may be available." Arlington Heights, supra, at 266; see also Miller, supra, at 905, 914(citing

Arlington Heights); Shaw I, supra, at 644 (same).2

Opinion of the Court
Districting legislation ordinarily, if not always, classifiestracts of land, precincts, or census blocks, and is race neutral

on its face. North Carolina's 1997 plan was not atypical;appellees, therefore, were required to prove that District 12
was drawn with an impermissible racial motive--in thiscontext, strict scrutiny applies if race was the "predominant
factor" motivating the legislature's districting decision. Tocarry their burden, appellees were obliged to show--using
direct or circumstantial evidence, or a combination of both,see

Shaw II, supra, at 905; Miller, 515 U. S., at 916--that"the legislature subordinated traditional race-neutral districting principles, including but not limited to compactness,contiguity, and respect for political subdivisions or communities defined by actual shared interests, to racial considera-tions,"

ibid.Appellees offered only circumstantial evidence in support

of their claim. Their evidence included maps of District 12,showing its size, shape,

3 and alleged lack of continuity. See

Appendix, infra. They also submitted evidence of the dis-trict's low scores with respect to traditional measures of

compactness and expert affidavit testimony explaining thatthis statistical evidence proved the State had ignored traditional districting criteria in crafting the new Twelfth Con-gressional District. See App. 221-251. Appellees further
claimed that the State had disrespected political subdivisionsand communities of interest. In support, they pointed out
that under the 1997 plan, District 12 was the only one state3 Justice Stevens asserts that proof of a district's "bizarre configuration" gives rise equally to an inference that its architects were motivated
by politics or race. Post, at 555. We do not necessarily quarrel with the
proposition that a district's unusual shape can give rise to an inference of
political motivation. But we doubt that a bizarre shape equally supports
a political inference and a racial one. Some districts, we have said, are
"so highly irregular that [they] rationally cannot be understood as anything other than an effort to `segregat[e] . . . voters' on the basis of race."

wide to contain no undivided county and offered figuresshowing that District 12 gathered almost 75% of its population from Mecklenburg County, at the southern tip of thedistrict, and from Forsyth and Guilford Counties at the
northernmost part of the district. Id., at 176, 208-209.Appellees also presented statistical and demographic
evidence with respect to the precincts that were includedwithin District 12 and those that were placed in neighboring districts. For the six subdivided counties includedwithin District 12, the proportion of black residents was
higher in the portion of the county within District 12 thanthe portion of the county in a neighboring district.

4 Other

maps and supporting data submitted by appellees com-pared the demographics of several so-called "boundary segments." 5 This evidence tended to show that, in several in-stances, the State had excluded precincts that had a lower
percentage of black population but were as Democratic (interms of registered voters) as the precinct inside District 12.
Id., at 253-290; 3 Record, Doc. No. 61.Viewed in toto, appellees' evidence tends to support an
inference that the State drew its district lines with an im4 In the portion of Guilford County in District 12, black residents constituted 51.5% of the population, while in the District 6 portion, only
10.2% of the population was black. App. 179. Appellees' evidence as to
the other counties showed: Forsyth District 12 was 72.9% black while
Forsyth District 5 was 11.1% black; Davidson District 12 was 14.8% black
while Davidson District 6 was 4.1% black; Rowan District 12 was 35.6%
black and Rowan District 6 was 7.7% black; Iredell District 12 was 24.3%
black while Iredell District 10 was 10.1% black; Mecklenburg District 12
was 51.9% black but Mecklenburg District 9 was only 7.2% black. Id.,
at 179-181.

5 Boundary segments, we are told, are those sections along the district's perimeter that separate outside precincts from inside precincts. In
other words, the boundary segment is the district borderline itself; for
each segment, the relevant comparison is between the inside precinct
that touches the segment and the corresponding outside precinct. See
App. to Juris. Statement 92a; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae

Opinion of the Court
permissible racial motive--even though they presented nodirect evidence of intent. Summary judgment, however, is

appropriate only where there is no genuine issue of materialfact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter
of law. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U. S. 317 (1986);
Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U. S. 242 (1986). To besure, appellants did not contest the evidence of District 12's

shape (which hardly could be contested), nor did they claimthat appellees' statistical and demographic evidence, most
if not all of which appears to have been obtained from theState's own data banks, was untrue.

The District Court nevertheless was only partially correct in stating that the material facts before it were uncontroverted. The legislature's motivation is itself a factual
question. See Shaw II, 517 U. S., at 905; Miller, supra, at
910. Appellants asserted that the General Assembly drew
its district lines with the intent to make District 12 a strong
Democratic district. In support, they presented the afterthe-fact affidavit testimony of the two members of the General Assembly responsible for developing the State's 1997
plan. See App. to Juris. Statement 69a-84a. Those legislators further stated that, in crafting their districting law,
they attempted to protect incumbents, to adhere to traditional districting criteria, and to preserve the existing partisan balance in the State's congressional delegation, which in
1997 was composed of six Republicans and six Democrats.
Ibid.

More important, we think, was the affidavit of an expert,
Dr. David W. Peterson. Id., at 85a-100a. He reviewed
racial demographics, party registration, and election result
data (the number of people voting for Democratic candidates)
gleaned from the State's 1998 Court of Appeals election, 1998
Lieutenant Governor election, and 1990 United States Senate election for the precincts included within District 12
and those surrounding it. Unlike appellees' evidence, which
highlighted select boundary segments, appellants' expert

550 HUNT v. CROMARTIE

Opinion of the Court
examined the district's entire border--all 234 boundarysegments. See

id., at 92a. He recognized "a strong correlation between racial composition and party preference"so that "in precincts with high black representation, there

is a correspondingly high tendency for voters to favor the
Democratic Party" but that "[i]n precincts with low blackrepresentation, there is much more variation in party preference, and the fraction of registered voters favoring Demo-crats is substantially lower."

Id., at 91a. Because of this
significant correlation, the data tended to support both apolitical and racial hypothesis. Therefore, Peterson focused

on "divergent boundary segments," those where blacks were
greater inside District 12 but Democrats were greater outside and those where blacks were greater outside the district but Democrats were greater inside. He concluded that
the State included the more heavily Democratic precinct
much more often than the more heavily black precinct,
and therefore, that the data as a whole supported a political explanation at least as well as, and somewhat better
than, a racial explanation. Id., at 98a; see also id., at 87a
("[T]here is at least one other explanation that fits the data
as well as or better than race, and that explanation is political identification").

Peterson's analysis of District 12's divergent boundary
segments and his affidavit testimony that District 12 displays a high correlation between race and partisanship
support an inference that the General Assembly did no
more than create a district of strong partisan Democrats.
His affidavit is also significant in that it weakens the probative value of appellees' boundary segment evidence, which
the District Court appeared to give significant weight. See
id., at 20a-21a. Appellees' evidence was limited to a few
select precincts, see App. 253-276, whereas Peterson analyzed all 234 boundary segments. Moreover, appellees'
maps reported only party registration figures. Peterson
again was more thorough, looking also at actual voting re526US2 Unit: $U55 [12-13-00 19:52:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
sults. Peterson's more complete analysis was significantbecause it showed that in North Carolina, party registration

and party preference do not always correspond.6Accepting appellants' political motivation explanation as
true, as the District Court was required to do in ruling onappellees' motion for summary judgment, see

Anderson, 477U. S., at 255, appellees were not entitled to judgment as a

matter of law. Our prior decisions have made clear that ajurisdiction may engage in constitutional political gerrymandering, even if it so happens that the most loyal Demo-crats happen to be black Democrats and even if the State
were conscious of that fact. See Bush v. Vera, 517 U. S. 952,968 (1996);

id., at 1001 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment);Shaw II, supra, at 905; Miller, 515 U. S., at 916; Shaw I,

509 U. S., at 646.7 Evidence that blacks constitute even asupermajority in one congressional district while amount6 In addition to the evidence that appellants presented to the District
Court, they have submitted with their reply brief maps showing that
in almost all of the majority-Democrat registered precincts surrounding
those portions of District 12 in Guilford, Forsyth, and Mecklenburg Counties, Republican candidates were elected in at least one of the three elections considered by the state defendants' expert. Reply Brief for State
Appellants 4-8; App. to Reply Brief for State Appellants 1a-10a. Appellants apparently did not put this additional evidence before the District
Court prior to the court's decision on the competing motions for summary
judgment. They claim excuse in that appellees filed their maps showing
partisan registration at the "eleventh hour." Brief for State Appellants
10, n. 13. We are not sure why appellants believe the timing of appellees'
filing to be an excuse. The District Court set an advance deadline for
filings in support of the competing motions for summary judgment, so
appellants could not have been caught by surprise. And given that appellants not only had to respond to appellees' evidence, but also had their
own motion for summary judgment to support, one would think that the
District Court would not have needed to afford them "an adequate opportunity to respond." Ibid.

7 This Court has recognized, however, that political gerrymandering

claims are justiciable under the Equal Protection Clause although we were
not in agreement as to the standards that would govern such a claim. See
Davis v. Bandemer, 478 U. S. 109, 127 (1986).

Opinion of the Court
ing to less than a plurality in a neighboring district willnot, by itself, suffice to prove that a jurisdiction was motivated by race in drawing its district lines when the evi-dence also shows a high correlation between race and party
preference.Of course, neither appellees nor the District Court relied
exclusively on appellees' boundary segment evidence, andappellees submitted other evidence tending to show that the
General Assembly was motivated by racial considerationsin drawing District 12--most notably, District 12's shape
and its lack of compactness. But in ruling on a motion forsummary judgment, the nonmoving party's evidence "is to
be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawnin [that party's] favor." Anderson, 477 U. S., at 255. While
appellees' evidence might allow the District Court to findthat the State acted with an impermissible racial motivation,
despite the State's explanation as supported by the Petersonaffidavit, it does not require that the court do so. All that
can be said on the record before us is that motivation was indispute. Reasonable inferences from the undisputed facts
can be drawn in favor of a racial motivation finding or infavor of a political motivation finding. The District Court
nevertheless concluded that race was the "predominantfactor" in the drawing of the district. In doing so, it either
credited appellees' asserted inferences over those advancedand supported by appellants or did not give appellants the
inference they were due. In any event, it was error in thiscase for the District Court to resolve the disputed fact
of motivation at the summary judgment stage. Cf. ibid.("Credibility determinations, the weighing of the evidence,
and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts arejury functions").

us on a developed record and after the respective District Courts
had made findings of fact. Bush v. Vera, supra, at 959; Vera v.

Opinion of the Court
Outright admissions of impermissible racial motivationare infrequent and plaintiffs often must rely upon other evidence. Summary judgment in favor of the party with theburden of persuasion, however, is inappropriate when the
evidence is susceptible of different interpretations or infer-ences by the trier of fact.

9 That is not to say that summary

judgment in a plaintiff 's favor will never be appropriate in aracial gerrymandering case sought to be proved exclusively

by circumstantial evidence. We can imagine an instancewhere the uncontroverted evidence and the reasonable inferences to be drawn in the nonmoving party's favor wouldnot be "significantly probative" so as to create a genuine
issue of fact for trial. Id., at 249-250. But this is not thatcase. And even if the question whether appellants had
created a material dispute of fact were a close one, we thinkthat "the sensitive nature of redistricting and the presumption of good faith that must be accorded legislativeenactments," Miller, 515 U. S., at 916, would tip the balance
in favor of the District Court making findings of fact. Seealso id., at 916-917 ("[C]ourts must also recognize . . . the
intrusive potential of judicial intervention into the legisla-tive realm, when assessing . . . the adequacy of a plaintiff 's
showing at the various stages of litigation and determiningwhether to permit discovery or trial to proceed").

In reaching our decision, we are fully aware that the Dis-trict Court is more familiar with the evidence than this
Court, and is likewise better suited to assess the GenRichards, 861 F. Supp. 1304, 1311-1331, 1336-1344 (SD Tex. 1994);

1354, 1360-1369 (SD Ga. 1994).

9 Just as summary judgment is rarely granted in a plaintiff's favor in

cases where the issue is a defendant's racial motivation, such as disparate
treatment suits under Title VII or racial discrimination claims under 42
U. S. C. $ 1981, the same holds true for racial gerrymandering claims of the
sort brought here. See generally 10B C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane,

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Souter, Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer join, concurring inthe judgment.

The disputed issue of fact in this case is whether politi-cal considerations or racial considerations provide the "primary" explanation for the seemingly irregular configurationof North Carolina's Twelfth Congressional District. The
Court concludes that evidence submitted to the DistrictCourt on behalf of the State made it inappropriate for
that Court to grant appellees' motion for summary judg-ment. I agree with that conclusion, but write separately
to emphasize the importance of two undisputed matters offact that are firmly established by the historical record and
confirmed by the record in this case.First, bizarre configuration is the traditional hallmark
of the political gerrymander. This obvious proposition issupported by the work product of Elbridge Gerry, by the
"swan" designed by New Jersey Republicans in 1982, see
Karcher v. Daggett, 462 U. S. 725, 744, 762-763 (1983), andby the Indiana plan reviewed in Davis v. Bandemer, 478 U. S.

109, 183, 185 (1986). As we learned in Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U. S. 339 (1960), a racial gerrymander may have anequally "uncouth" shape. See id., at 340, 348. Thus, the

shape of the congressional district at issue in this case pro-vides strong evidence that either political or racial factors
motivated its architects, but sheds no light on the questionof which set of factors was more responsible for subordinating any of the State's "traditional" districting principles.1

1 I include the last phrase because the Court has held that a state legislature may make race-based districting decisions so long as those decisions

Second, as the Presidential campaigns conducted by Strom
Thurmond in 1948 and by George Wallace in 1968, and the
Senate campaigns conducted more recently by Jesse Helms,
have demonstrated, a great many registered Democrats in
the South do not always vote for Democratic candidates in
federal elections. The Congressional Quarterly recently recorded the fact that in North Carolina "Democratic voter
registration edges . . . no longer translat[e] into success in
statewide or national races. In recent years, conservative
white Democrats have gravitated toward Republican candidates." See Congressional Quarterly Inc., Congressional
Districts in the 1990s, p. 549 (1993).2 This voting pattern

scrutiny, a plaintiff must show that the State has relied on race in substantial disregard of customary and traditional districting practices"). In this
regard, I note that neither the Court's opinion nor the District Court's
opinion analyzes the question whether the "traditional districting principle" of joining communities of interest is subordinated in the present
Twelfth District. A district may lack compactness or contiguity--due,
for example, to geographic or demographic reasons--yet still serve the
traditional districting goal of joining communities of interest.

2 The Congressional Quarterly's publication, which is largely seen as

the authoritative source regarding the political and demographic makeup
of the congressional districts resulting from each decennial census, is
even more revealing when one examines its district-by-district analysis of
North Carolina's partisan voting patterns. With regard to the original
First District, which was just over 50 percent black, the book remarks:
"The white voters of the 1st claim the Democratic roots of their forefathers, but often support GOP candidates at the state and national

level. A fair number are `Jessecrats,' conservative Democratic supporters
of GOP Sen. Jesse Helms." Congressional Quarterly, at 550. The book
shows that while the Second and Third Districts have "significant Democratic voter registration edges," Republican candidates actually won substantial victories in four of five recent elections. See id., at 549, 552-553.
Statistics also demonstrate that a majority of voters in the Eleventh District consistently vote for Republicans "despite a wide Democratic registration advantage." Id., at 565. Although the book exhaustively analyzes the statistical demographics of each congressional district, listing
even the number of cable television subscribers in each district, it does
not provide voter registration statistics.

has proved to be particularly pronounced in voting districtsthat contain more than about one-third African-American

residents. See Pildes, The Politics of Race, 108 Harv.L. Rev. 1359, 1382-1386 (1995). There was no need for expert testimony to establish the proposition that "in NorthCarolina, party registration and party preference do not always correspond." Ante, at 551.Indeed, for me the most remarkable feature of the District
Court's erroneous decision is that it relied entirely on dataconcerning the location of registered Democrats and ignored
the more probative evidence of how the people who live nearthe borders of District 12 actually voted in recent elections.
That evidence not only undermines and rebuts the inferencesthe District Court drew from the party registration data, but
also provides strong affirmative evidence that is thoroughlyconsistent with the sworn testimony of the two members
of the state legislature who were most active in drawing theboundaries of District 12. The affidavits of those members,
stating that district lines were drawn according to electionresults, not voter registration, are uncontradicted.

3 And

almost all of the majority-Democrat registered precincts thatthe state legislature excluded from District 12 in favor of

precincts with higher black populations produced signifi-cantly less dependable Democratic results and actually voted
for one or more Republicans in recent elections.The record supports the conclusion that the most loyal
Democrats living near the borders of District 12 "happen tobe black Democrats," see

ibid., and I have no doubt that thelegislature was conscious of that fact when it enacted this

apportionment plan. But everyone agrees that that fact isnot sufficient to invalidate the district. Cf. ante, at 551-552.
That fact would not even be enough, under this Court's deci-sions, to invalidate a governmental action, that, unlike the

action at issue here, actually has an adverse impact on aparticular racial group. See, e. g., Personnel Administrator

of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U. S. 256, 279 (1979) (holding thatthe Equal Protection Clause is implicated only when "a state
legislatur[e] selected or reaffirmed a particular course of ac-tion at least in part `because of,' not merely `in spite of,' its
adverse effects upon an identifiable group"); Washington v.

onnor, J., concurring in judgment)("No matter how closely tied or significantly correlated to

race the explanation for [a governmental action] may be,the [action] does not implicate the Equal Protection Clause

than (i) a bizarre shape, which is equally consistent witheither political or racial motivation, (ii) registration data,
which are virtually irrelevant when actual voting resultswere available and which point in a different direction,
and (iii) knowledge of the racial composition of the district.Because we do not have before us the question whether the
District Court erred in denying the State's motion for sum-mary judgment, I need not decide whether that circumstantial evidence even raises an inference of improper motive.It is sufficient at this stage of the proceedings to join in the
Court's judgment of reversal, which I do.

559OCTOBER TERM, 1998
Syllabus

FLORIDA v. WHITE
certiorari to the supreme court of florida

No. 98-223. Argued March 23, 1999--Decided May 17, 1999
Two months after officers observed respondent using his car to deliver

cocaine, he was arrested at his workplace on unrelated charges. At
that time, the arresting officers seized his car without securing a warrant because they believed that it was subject to forfeiture under the
Florida Contraband Forfeiture Act (Act). During a subsequent inventory search, the police discovered cocaine in the car. Respondent was
then charged with a state drug violation. At his trial on the drug
charge, he moved to suppress the evidence discovered during the search,
arguing that the car's warrantless seizure violated the Fourth Amendment, thereby making the cocaine the "fruit of the poisonous tree."
After the jury returned a guilty verdict, the court denied the motion,
and the Florida First District Court of Appeal affirmed. It also certified to the Florida Supreme Court the question whether, absent exigent
circumstances, a warrantless seizure of an automobile under the Act
violated the Fourth Amendment. The latter court answered the question in the affirmative, quashed the lower court opinion, and remanded.

Held: The Fourth Amendment does not require the police to obtain a warrant before seizing an automobile from a public place when they have
probable cause to believe that it is forfeitable contraband. In deciding
whether a challenged governmental action violates the Amendment,
this Court inquires whether the action was regarded as an unlawful
search and seizure when the Amendment was framed. See, e. g., Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132, 149. This Court has held that when
federal officers have probable cause to believe that an automobile contains contraband, the Fourth Amendment does not require them to obtain a warrant prior to searching the car for and seizing the contraband.
Id., at 150-151. Although the police here lacked probable cause to believe that respondent's car contained contraband, they had probable
cause to believe that the vehicle itself was contraband under Florida
law. A recognition of the need to seize readily movable contraband
before it is spirited away undoubtedly underlies the early federal laws
relied upon in Carroll. This need is equally weighty when the automobile, as opposed to its contents, is the contraband that the police seek
to secure. In addition, this Court's Fourth Amendment jurisprudence
has consistently accorded officers greater latitude in exercising their
duties in public places. Here, because the police seized respondent's

Opinion of the Court
Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.
The Florida Contraband Forfeiture Act provides that cer-tain forms of contraband, including motor vehicles used in

violation of the Act's provisions, may be seized and poten-tially forfeited. In this case, we must decide whether the
Fourth Amendment requires the police to obtain a warrantbefore seizing an automobile from a public place when they
have probable cause to believe that it is forfeitable contra-band. We hold that it does not.

I
On three occasions in July and August 1993, police officersobserved respondent Tyvessel Tyvorus White using his car

to deliver cocaine, and thereby developed probable cause tobelieve that his car was subject to forfeiture under the Florida Contraband Forfeiture Act (Act), Fla. Stat. $ 932.701 et
seq. (1997).1 Several months later, the police arrested re-spondent at his place of employment on charges unrelated to

the drug transactions observed in July and August 1993. Atthe same time, the arresting officers, without securing a warrant, seized respondent's automobile in accordance with theprovisions of the Act. See $ 932.703(2)(a).

2 They seized the

of Virginia, Christine O. Gregoire of Washington, and Gay Woodhouse of
Wyoming.

Richard J. Troberman and Lisa B. Kemler filed a brief for the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers as amicus curiae urging
affirmance.

1 That Act provides, in relevant part: "Any contraband article, vessel,

motor vehicle, aircraft, other personal property, or real property used in
violation of any provision of the Florida Contraband Forfeiture Act, or in,
upon, or by means of which any violation of the Florida Contraband Forfeiture Act has taken or is taking place, may be seized and shall be forfeited." Fla. Stat. $ 932.703(1)(a) (1997).

2 Nothing in the Act requires the police to obtain a warrant prior

to seizing a vehicle. See State v. Pomerance, 434 So. 2d 329, 330 (Fla.
App. 1983). Rather, the Act simply provides that "[p]ersonal property

Opinion of the Court
vehicle solely because they believed that it was forfeitableunder the Act. During a subsequent inventory search, the

police found two pieces of crack cocaine in the ashtray.Based on the discovery of the cocaine, respondent was
charged with possession of a controlled substance in violationof Florida law.

At his trial on the possession charge, respondent filed amotion to suppress the evidence discovered during the inventory search. He argued that the warrantless seizure of hiscar violated the Fourth Amendment, thereby making the cocaine the "fruit of the poisonous tree." The trial court initially reserved ruling on respondent's motion, but later denied it after the jury returned a guilty verdict. On appeal,the Florida First District Court of Appeal affirmed. 680

So. 2d 550 (1996). Adopting the position of a majority ofstate and federal courts to have considered the question, the
court rejected respondent's argument that the FourthAmendment required the police to secure a warrant prior to
seizing his vehicle. Id., at 554. Because the Florida Su-preme Court and this Court had not directly addressed the
issue, the court certified to the Florida Supreme Court the
question whether, absent exigent circumstances, the war-rantless seizure of an automobile under the Act violated the

Fourth Amendment. Id., at 555.In a divided opinion, the Florida Supreme Court answered
the certified question in the affirmative, quashed the FirstDistrict Court of Appeal's opinion, and remanded. 710
So. 2d 949, 955 (1998). The majority of the court concludedthat, absent exigent circumstances, the Fourth Amendment
requires the police to obtain a warrant prior to seizing propmay be seized at the time of the violation or subsequent to the violation,
if the person entitled to notice is notified at the time of the seizure . . .
that there is a right to an adversarial preliminary hearing after the seizure
to determine whether probable cause exists to believe that such property
has been or is being used in violation of the Florida Contraband Forfeiture
Act." $ 932.703(2)(a).

erty that has been used in violation of the Act. Ibid. Ac-cording to the court, the fact that the police develop probable

cause to believe that such a violation occurred does not,standing alone, justify a warrantless seizure. The court expressly rejected the holding of the Eleventh Circuit, see
United States v. Valdes, 876 F. 2d 1554 (1989), and the major-ity of other Federal Circuits to have addressed the same

issue in the context of the federal civil forfeiture law, 21U. S. C. $ 881, which is similar to Florida's. See United
States v. Decker, 19 F. 3d 287 (CA6 1994) (per curiam);United States v. Pace, 898 F. 2d 1218, 1241 (CA7 1990);
United States v. One 1978 Mercedes Benz, 711 F. 2d 1297(CA5 1983);

United States v. Kemp, 690 F. 2d 397 (CA4 1982);United States v. Bush, 647 F. 2d 357 (CA3 1981). But see

United States v. Dixon, 1 F. 3d 1080 (CA10 1993); UnitedStates v. Lasanta, 978 F. 2d 1300 (CA2 1992); United States
v. Linn, 880 F. 2d 209 (CA9 1989). We granted certiorari,525 U. S. 1000 (1998), and now reverse.

II
The Fourth Amendment guarantees "[t]he right of the peo-ple to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects,

against unreasonable searches and seizures," and furtherprovides that "no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable
cause." U. S. Const., Amdt. 4. In deciding whether a chal-lenged governmental action violates the Amendment, we
have taken care to inquire whether the action was regardedas an unlawful search and seizure when the Amendment was
framed. See Wyoming v. Houghton, ante, at 299; Carroll v.
United States, 267 U. S. 132, 149 (1925) ("The Fourth Amend-ment is to be construed in light of what was deemed an unreasonable search and seizure when it was adopted, and in amanner which will conserve public interests as well as the
interests and rights of individual citizens").In

Carroll, we held that when federal officers have proba-ble cause to believe that an automobile contains contraband,

526US2 Unit: $U56 [10-14-99 17:11:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN
564 FLORIDA v. WHITE

Opinion of the Court
the Fourth Amendment does not require them to obtain a
warrant prior to searching the car for and seizing the contraband. Our holding was rooted in federal law enforcement
practice at the time of the adoption of the Fourth Amendment. Specifically, we looked to laws of the First, Second,
and Fourth Congresses that authorized federal officers to
conduct warrantless searches of ships and to seize concealed
goods subject to duties. Id., at 150-151 (citing Act of July
31, 1789, $$ 24, 29, 1 Stat. 43; Act of Aug. 4, 1790, $ 50, 1 Stat.
170; Act of Feb. 18, 1793, $ 27, 1 Stat. 315; Act of Mar. 2,
1799, $$ 68-70, 1 Stat. 677, 678). These enactments led us
to conclude that "contemporaneously with the adoption of the
Fourth Amendment," Congress distinguished "the necessity
for a search warrant between goods subject to forfeiture,
when concealed in a dwelling house or similar place, and like
goods in course of transportation and concealed in a movable
vessel where they readily could be put out of reach of a
search warrant." 267 U. S., at 151.

The Florida Supreme Court recognized that under Carroll, the police could search respondent's car, without obtaining a warrant, if they had probable cause to believe that it
contained contraband. The court, however, rejected the argument that the warrantless seizure of respondent's vehicle
itself also was appropriate under Carroll and its progeny.
It reasoned that "[t]here is a vast difference between permitting the immediate search of a movable automobile based on
actual knowledge that it then contains contraband [and] the
discretionary seizure of a citizen's automobile based upon a
belief that it may have been used at some time in the past to
assist in illegal activity." 710 So. 2d, at 953. We disagree.

The principles underlying the rule in Carroll and the
founding-era statutes upon which they are based fully support the conclusion that the warrantless seizure of respondent's car did not violate the Fourth Amendment. Although,
as the Florida Supreme Court observed, the police lacked

526US2 Unit: $U56 [10-14-99 17:11:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN

565Cite as: 526 U. S. 559 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
probable cause to believe that respondent's car containedcontraband, see 710 So. 2d, at 953, they certainly had probable cause to believe that the vehicle itself was contrabandunder Florida law.

3 Recognition of the need to seize readily

movable contraband before it is spirited away undoubtedlyunderlies the early federal laws relied upon in

Carroll. See267 U. S., at 150-152; see also California v. Carney, 471 U. S.

386, 390 (1985); South Dakota v. Opperman, 428 U. S. 364,367 (1976). This need is equally weighty when the automobile, as opposed to its contents, is the contraband that thepolice seek to secure.

4 Furthermore, the early federal statutes that we looked to in Carroll, like the Florida Contra-band Forfeiture Act, authorized the warrantless seizure of

both goods subject to duties and the ships upon which thosegoods were concealed. See, e. g., 1 Stat. 43, 46; 1 Stat. 170,
174; 1 Stat. 677, 678, 692.In addition to the special considerations recognized in the
context of movable items, our Fourth Amendment jurispru-dence has consistently accorded law enforcement officials
greater latitude in exercising their duties in public places.For example, although a warrant presumptively is required
for a felony arrest in a suspect's home, the Fourth Amend-ment permits warrantless arrests in public places where an
officer has probable cause to believe that a felony has oc-curred. See United States v. Watson, 423 U. S. 411, 416-424
(1976). In explaining this rule, we have drawn upon the es3 The Act defines "contraband" to include any "vehicle of any kind, . . .
which was used . . . as an instrumentality in the commission of, or in aiding
or abetting in the commission of, any felony." $ 932.701(2)(a)(5).

4 At oral argument, respondent contended that the delay between the

time that the police developed probable cause to seize the vehicle and
when the seizure actually occurred undercuts the argument that the warrantless seizure was necessary to prevent respondent from removing the
car out of the jurisdiction. We express no opinion about whether excessive delay prior to a seizure could render probable cause stale, and the
seizure therefore unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.

tablished "distinction between a warrantless seizure in anopen area and such a seizure on private premises."

Payton
v. New York, 445 U. S. 573, 587 (1980); see also id., at 586-587("It is also well settled that objects such as weapons or contraband found in a public place may be seized by the police
without a warrant"). The principle that underlies Watson
extends to the seizure at issue in this case. Indeed, the facts
of this case are nearly indistinguishable from those in G. M.
Leasing Corp. v. United States, 429 U. S. 338 (1977). There,
we considered whether federal agents violated the Fourth
Amendment by failing to secure a warrant prior to seizing
automobiles in partial satisfaction of income tax assessments.
Id., at 351. We concluded that they did not, reasoning that
"[t]he seizures of the automobiles in this case took place on
public streets, parking lots, or other open places, and did not
involve any invasion of privacy." Ibid. Here, because the
police seized respondent's vehicle from a public area--respondent's employer's parking lot--the warrantless seizure
also did not involve any invasion of respondent's privacy.
Based on the relevant history and our prior precedent, we
therefore conclude that the Fourth Amendment did not require a warrant to seize respondent's automobile in these
circumstances.

The judgment of the Florida Supreme Court is reversed,
and the case is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent
with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice Souter, with whom Justice Breyer joins,
concurring.

I join the Court's opinion subject to a qualification against
reading our holding as a general endorsement of warrantless
seizures of anything a State chooses to call "contraband,"
whether or not the property happens to be in public when
seized. The Fourth Amendment does not concede any talis526US2 Unit: $U56 [10-14-99 17:11:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN

manic significance to use of the term "contraband" whenevera legislature may resort to a novel forfeiture sanction in the

interest of law enforcement, as legislatures are evincing in-creasing ingenuity in doing, cf.,

e. g., Bennis v. Michigan, 516
U. S. 442, 443-446 (1996); id., at 458 (Stevens, J., dissenting);
United States v. James Daniel Good Real Property, 510 U. S.
43, 81-82, and n. 1 (1993) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and
dissenting in part) (expressing concern about the breadth of
new forfeiture statutes). Moreover, G. M. Leasing Corp. v.
United States, 429 U. S. 338 (1977) (upon which we rely
today), endorsed the public character of a warrantless seizure scheme by reference to traditional enforcement of government revenue laws, id., at 351-352, and n. 18 (citing, e. g.,
Murray's Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Improvement Co., 18
How. 272 (1856)), and the legality of seizing abandoned
contraband in public view, 429 U. S., at 352 (citing Hester
v. United States, 265 U. S. 57 (1924)).

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins,
dissenting.

During the summer of 1993, Florida police obtained evidence that Tyvessel White was engaged in the sale and delivery of narcotics, and that he was using his car to facilitate
the enterprise. For reasons unexplained, the police neither
arrested White at that point nor seized his automobile as
an instrumentality of his alleged narcotics offenses. Most
important to the resolution of this case, the police did not
seek to obtain a warrant before seizing White's car that
fall--over two months after the last event that justified the
seizure. Instead, after arresting White at work on an unrelated matter and obtaining his car keys, the officers seized
White's automobile without a warrant from his employer's
parking lot and performed an inventory search. The Florida Supreme Court concluded that the seizure, which took
place absent exigent circumstances or probable cause to be526US2 Unit: $U56 [10-14-99 17:11:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN

lieve that narcotics were present, was invalid. 710 So. 2d949 (1998).

In 1971, after advising us that "we must not lose sightof the Fourth Amendment's fundamental guarantee," Justice Stewart made this comment on what was then settledlaw:

"[T]he most basic constitutional rule in this area is that`searches conducted outside the judicial process, without
prior approval by judge or magistrate, are per se unrea-sonable under the Fourth Amendment--subject only to
a few specifically established and well-delineated excep-tions.' The exceptions are `jealously and carefully
drawn,' and there must be `a showing by those who seekexemption . . . that the exigencies of the situation made
that course imperative.' `[T]he burden is on those seek-ing the exemption to show the need for it.' " Coolidge
v. New Hampshire, 403 U. S. 443, 453, 454-455 (foot-notes omitted).

Because the Fourth Amendment plainly "protects propertyas well as privacy" and seizures as well as searches, Soldal
v. Cook County, 506 U. S. 56, 62-64 (1992), I would apply tothe present case our longstanding warrant presumption.

2

1 The Florida Supreme Court's opinion could be read to suggest that
due process protections in the Florida Constitution might independently
require a warrant or other judicial process before seizure under the Florida Contraband Forfeiture Act. See 710 So. 2d, at 952 (discussing Department of Law Enforcement v. Real Property, 588 So. 2d 957 (1991)). However, the certified question put to that court referred only to the Fourth
Amendment to the United States Constitution. 710 So. 2d, at 950. Thus,
a viable federal question was presented for us to decide on certiorari, but
of course we have no authority to determine the limits of state constitutional or statutory safeguards.

Mich., 407 U. S. 297, 315-318 (1972) ("Though the Fourth Amendment
speaks broadly of `unreasonable searches and seizures,' the definition of
`reasonableness' turns, at least in part, on the more specific commands of
the warrant clause"); Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U. S. 443, 454-455

Stevens, J., dissenting
In the context of property seizures by law enforcement authorities, the presumption might be overcome more easily in
the absence of an accompanying privacy or liberty interest.
Nevertheless, I would look to the warrant clause as a measure of reasonableness in such cases, United States v. United
States Dist. Court for Eastern Dist. of Mich., 407 U. S. 297,
315 (1972), and the circumstances of this case do not convince
me that the role of a neutral magistrate was dispensable.

The Court does not expressly disavow the warrant presumption urged by White and followed by the Florida Supreme Court, but its decision suggests that the exceptions
have all but swallowed the general rule. To defend the officers' warrantless seizure, the State points to cases establishing an "automobile exception" to our ordinary demand for a
warrant before a lawful search may be conducted. Each of
those cases, however, involved searches of automobiles for
contraband or temporary seizures of automobiles to effect
such searches.3 Such intrusions comport with the practice

seizure is unreasonable when made without a magistrate's authority expressed through a validly issued warrant"), overruled in part by Chimel

of the police and prosecution must determine probable cause"); Wong Sun

the police have probable cause, "contraband goods concealed and illegally
transported in an automobile or other vehicle may be searched for without
a warrant"); United States v. Ross, 456 U. S. 798, 820, n. 26, 825 (1982)
("During virtually the entire history of our country--whether contraband
was transported in a horse-drawn carriage, a 1921 roadster, or a modern
automobile--it has been assumed that a lawful search of a vehicle would

search"); Wyoming v. Houghton, ante, at 300-301; Pennsylvania v. Labron, 518 U. S. 938, 940 (1996) (per curiam) ("If a car is readily mobile

of federal customs officers during the Nation's early historyon which the majority relies, as well as the practicalities of

modern life. But those traditions and realities are weaksupport for a warrantless seizure of the vehicle itself, months
after the property was proverbially tainted by its physicalproximity to the drug trade, and while the owner is safely in
police custody.The stated purposes for allowing warrantless vehicle
searches are likewise insufficient to validate the seizure atissue, whether one emphasizes the ready mobility of automobiles or the pervasive regulation that diminishes the owner'sprivacy interests in such property. No one seriously suggests that the State's regulatory regime for road safetymakes acceptable such unchecked and potentially permanent
seizures of automobiles under the State's criminal laws.And, as the Florida Supreme Court cogently explained, an
exigent circumstance rationale is not available when the sei-zure is based upon a belief that the automobile may have
been used at some time in the past to assist in illegal activityand the owner is already in custody.

4 Moreover, the state

court's conclusion that the warrant process is a sensible pro-tection from abuse of government power is bolstered by the

inherent risks of hindsight at postseizure hearings and lawenforcement agencies' pecuniary interest in the seizure of
such property. See Fla. Stat. $ 932.704(1) (1997); cf. United
States v. James Daniel Good Real Property, 510 U. S. 43,55-56 (1993).

4 710 So. 2d 949, 953-954 (Fla. 1998) ("There simply was no concern presented here that an opportunity to seize evidence would be missed because
of the mobility of the vehicle. Indeed, the entire focus of the seizure here
was to seize the vehicle itself as a prize because of its alleged prior use in
illegal activities, rather than to search the vehicle for contraband known
to be therein, and that might be lost if not seized immediately"). The
majority notes, ante, at 565, n. 4, but does not confront, the argument that
the mobility of White's vehicle was not a substantial governmental concern in light of the delay between establishing probable cause and seizure.

Were we confronted with property that Florida deemedunlawful for private citizens to possess regardless of purpose, and had the State relied on the plain-view doctrine,perhaps a warrantless seizure would have been defensible.
See Horton v. California, 496 U. S. 128 (1990); Arizona v.
Hicks, 480 U. S. 321, 327 (1987) (citing Payton v. New York,445 U. S. 573 (1980)). But " `[t]here is nothing even remotely

criminal in possessing an automobile,' " Austin v. UnitedStates, 509 U. S. 602, 621 (1993) (quoting One 1958 Plymouth
Sedan v. Pennsylvania, 380 U. S. 693, 699 (1965)); no seriousfear for officer safety or loss of evidence can be asserted in
this case considering the delay and circumstances of the sei-zure; and only the automobile exception is at issue, 710
So. 2d, at 952; Brief for Petitioner 6, 28.5In any event, it seems to me that the State's treatment of
certain vehicles as "contraband" based on past use providesan added reason for insisting on an appraisal of the evidence
by a neutral magistrate, rather than a justification for ex-panding the discretionary authority of the police. Unlike a
search that is contemporaneous with an officer's probable-cause determination,

Horton, 496 U. S., at 130-131, a belatedseizure may involve a serious intrusion on the rights of innocent persons with no connection to the earlier offense. Cf.Bennis v. Michigan, 516 U. S. 442 (1996). And a seizure
supported only by the officer's conclusion that at some timein the past there was probable cause to believe that the car
was then being used illegally is especially intrusive whenfollowed by a routine and predictable inventory search--

5 There is some force to the majority's reliance on United States v. Watson, 423 U. S. 411 (1976), which held that no warrant is required for felony
arrests made in public. Ante, at 565-566. With respect to the seizures
at issue in Watson, however, I consider the law enforcement and public
safety interests far more substantial, and the historical and legal traditions
more specific and engrained, than those present on the facts of this case.

Stevens, J., dissenting
even though there may be no basis for believing the car then
contains any contraband or other evidence of wrongdoing.6

Of course, requiring police officers to obtain warrants in
cases such as the one before us will not allay every concern
private property owners might have regarding government
discretion and potentially permanent seizures of private
property under the authority of a State's criminal laws.
Had the officers in this case obtained a warrant in July or
August, perhaps they nevertheless could or would have executed that warrant months later; and, as the Court suggests,
ante, at 565, n. 4, delay between the basis for a seizure and its
effectuation might support a Fourth Amendment objection
whether or not a warrant was obtained. That said, a warrant application interjects the judgment of a neutral decisionmaker, one with no pecuniary interest in the matter, see
Connally v. Georgia, 429 U. S. 245, 250-251 (1977) (per curiam), before the burden of obtaining possession of the property shifts to the individual. Knowing that a neutral party

6 The Court's reliance on G. M. Leasing Corp. v. United States, 429 U. S.
338 (1977), is misplaced. The seizure in that case was supported by an
earlier tax assessment that was "given the force of a judgment." Id., at
352, n. 18 (internal quotation marks omitted). We emphasized that the
owner of the automobiles in question lacked a privacy interest, but he had
also lost any possessory interest in the property by way of the prior judgment. In this case, despite plenty of time to obtain a warrant that would
provide similar preseizure authority for the police, they acted entirely on
their own assessment of the probative force of evidence relating to earlier
events. In addition, White's property interests in his car were apparently
not extinguished until, at the earliest, the seizure took place. See Fla.
Stat. $$ 932.703(1)(c)-(d) (1997) (the State acquires rights, interest, and
title in contraband articles at the time of seizure, and the seizing agency
may not use the seized property until such rights, interest, and title are
"perfected" in accordance with the statute); $ 932.704(8); Soldal v. Cook
County, 506 U. S. 56, 63-64 (1992). This statutory scheme and its aims,
see Fla. Stat. $ 932.704(1) (1997), also distinguish more mundane and temporary vehicle seizures performed for regulatory purposes and immediate
public needs, such as a tow from a no-parking zone. No one contends that
a warrant is necessary in that case.

will be involved before private property is seized can onlyhelp ensure that law enforcement officers will initiate forfeiture proceedings only when they are truly justified. A war-rant requirement might not prevent delay and the attendant
opportunity for official mischief through discretionary tim-ing, but it surely makes delay more tolerable.

Without a legitimate exception, the presumption shouldprevail. Indeed, the particularly troubling aspect of this
case is not that the State provides a weak excuse for failingto obtain a warrant either before or after White's arrest, but
that it offers us no reason at all. The justification cannot bethat the authorities feared their narcotics investigation
would be exposed and hindered if a warrant had been ob-tained. Ex parte warrant applications provide neutral review of police determinations of probable cause, but suchprocedures are by no means public. And the officers had
months to take advantage of them. On this record, onemust assume that the officers who seized White's car simply
preferred to avoid the hassle of seeking approval from a judi-cial officer. I would not permit bare convenience to overcome our established preference for the warrant process asa check against arbitrary intrusions by law enforcement
agencies "engaged in the often competitive"--and, here,potentially lucrative--"enterprise of ferreting out crime."
Johnson v. United States, 333 U. S. 10, 14-15 (1948).Because I agree with the Florida Supreme Court's judgment that this seizure was not reasonable without a warrant,I respectfully dissent.

RUHRGAS AG v. MARATHON OIL CO. et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 98-470. Argued March 22, 1999--Decided May 17, 1999
The underlying controversy stems from a venture to produce gas in the

North Sea's Heimdal Field. In 1976, respondents Marathon Oil Company and Marathon International Oil Company acquired respondent
Marathon Petroleum Norge (Norge) and Marathon Petroleum Company
(Norway) (MPCN). Following the acquisition, Norge assigned its license to produce gas in the Heimdal Field to MPCN, which then contracted to sell 70% of its share of the Heimdal gas production to a group
of European buyers, including petitioner Ruhrgas AG. MPCN's sales
agreement with Ruhrgas and the other European buyers provided that
disputes would be settled by arbitration in Sweden. In 1995, Marathon
Oil Company, Marathon International Oil Company, and Norge (collectively Marathon) sued Ruhrgas in Texas state court, asserting state-law
claims of fraud, tortious interference with prospective business relations, participation in breach of fiduciary duty, and civil conspiracy.
Marathon alleged that Ruhrgas had defrauded it into financing MPCN's
development of the Heimdal Field and that Ruhrgas had diminished the
value of the license Norge had assigned to MPCN. Ruhrgas removed
the case to the District Court, asserting three bases for federal jurisdiction: diversity of citizenship, see 28 U. S. C. $ 1332, on the theory that
Norge, the only nondiverse plaintiff, had been fraudulently joined; federal question, see $ 1331, because Marathon's claims raised questions of
international relations; and 9 U. S. C. $ 205, which authorizes removal of
cases relating to international arbitration agreements. Ruhrgas moved
to dismiss the complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction. Marathon
moved to remand the case to the state court for lack of federal subjectmatter jurisdiction. The District Court granted Ruhrgas' motion.
Noting that Texas' long-arm statute authorizes personal jurisdiction to
the extent allowed by the Due Process Clause of the Federal Constitution, the court addressed the constitutional question and concluded that
Ruhrgas' contacts with Texas were insufficient to support personal jurisdiction. The en banc Fifth Circuit vacated and remanded, holding
that, in removed cases, district courts must decide issues of subjectmatter jurisdiction first, reaching issues of personal jurisdiction only if
subject-matter jurisdiction is found to exist. The court derived "counsel against" recognizing judicial discretion to proceed directly to per526US2 Unit: $U57 [12-11-00 20:46:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN

sonal jurisdiction from Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, 523
U. S. 83, in which this Court held that Article III generally requires a
federal court to satisfy itself of its subject-matter jurisdiction before it
considers the merits of a case. The Fifth Circuit limited its holding to
removed cases, perceiving in them the most grave threat that federal
courts would usurp state courts' residual jurisdiction.

Held: In cases removed from state court to federal court, as in cases originating in federal court, there is no unyielding jurisdictional hierarchy
requiring the federal court to adjudicate subject-matter jurisdiction before considering a challenge to personal jurisdiction. Pp. 583-588.

(a) The Fifth Circuit erred in according absolute priority to the
subject-matter jurisdiction requirement on the ground that it is nonwaivable and delimits federal-court power, while restrictions on a
court's jurisdiction over the person are waivable and protect individual
rights. Although the character of the two jurisdictional bedrocks unquestionably differs, the distinctions do not mean that subject-matter
jurisdiction is ever and always the more "fundamental." Personal jurisdiction, too, is an essential element of district court jurisdiction, without which the court is powerless to proceed to an adjudication. Employers Reinsurance Corp. v. Bryant, 299 U. S. 374, 382. In this case,
indeed, the impediment to subject-matter jurisdiction on which Marathon relies--lack of complete diversity--rests on statutory interpretation, not constitutional command. Marathon joined an alien plaintiff
(Norge) as well as an alien defendant (Ruhrgas). If the joinder of
Norge is legitimate, the complete diversity required by $ 1332, but not
by Article III of the Constitution, see State Farm Fire & Casualty Co.
v. Tashire, 386 U. S. 523, 530-531, is absent. In contrast, Ruhrgas relies
on the constitutional due process safeguard to stop the court from proceeding to the merits of the case. See Insurance Corp. of Ireland v.
Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, 456 U. S. 694, 702. The Steel Co.
jurisdiction-before-merits principle does not dictate a sequencing of

jurisdictional issues. A court that dismisses for want of personal jurisdiction, without first ruling on subject-matter jurisdiction, makes no assumption of law-declaring power that violates the separation of powers
principles underlying Steel Co. Pp. 583-585.

(b) The Court rejects Marathon's assertion that it is particularly offensive in removed cases to rule on personal jurisdiction without first
deciding subject-matter jurisdiction, because the federal court's personal jurisdiction determination may preclude the parties from relitigating the very same issue in state court. See Baldwin v. Iowa State
Traveling Men's Assn., 283 U. S. 522, 524-527. Issue preclusion in subsequent state-court litigation may also attend a federal court's subject526US2 Unit: $U57 [05-03-01 16:50:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN

matter determination. For example, if a federal court concludes that
state law does not allow damages sufficient to meet the amount in controversy for diversity jurisdiction, see 28 U. S. C. $ 1332(a), and remands
to the state court on that basis, the federal court's ruling on permissible
state-law damages may bind the parties in state court. Most essentially, federal and state courts are complementary systems for administering justice. Cooperation and comity, not competition and conflict,
are essential to the federal design. A State's dignitary interest bears
consideration when a district court exercises discretion in a case of this
order. If personal jurisdiction raises difficult questions of state law,
and subject-matter jurisdiction is resolved as easily as personal jurisdiction, a district court will ordinarily conclude that federalism concerns
tip the scales in favor of initially ruling on the motion to remand. In
other cases, however, the district court may find that overriding concerns of judicial economy and restraint warrant immediate dismissal for
lack of personal jurisdiction. The federal design allows leeway for
sensitive judgments of this sort. See Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37,
44. Pp. 585-587.

(c) In most instances, subject-matter jurisdiction will involve no arduous inquiry, and both expedition and sensitivity to state courts' coequal
stature should impel the federal court to dispose of that issue first.
Where, as here, however, a district court has before it a straightforward
personal jurisdiction issue presenting no complex state-law question,
and the alleged defect in subject-matter jurisdiction raises a difficult
and novel question, the court does not abuse its discretion by turning
directly to personal jurisdiction. Pp. 587-588.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case concerns the authority of the federal courts toadjudicate controversies. Jurisdiction to resolve cases on

the merits requires both authority over the category of claimin suit (subject-matter jurisdiction) and authority over the
parties (personal jurisdiction), so that the court's decisionwill bind them. In

Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, 523 U. S. 83 (1998), this Court adhered to the rule thata federal court may not hypothesize subject-matter jurisdiction for the purpose of deciding the merits. Steel Co.rejected a doctrine, once approved by several Courts of
Appeals, that allowed federal tribunals to pretermit juris-dictional objections "where (1) the merits question is more
readily resolved, and (2) the prevailing party on the merits
would be the same as the prevailing party were jurisdictiondenied."

Id., at 93. Recalling "a long and venerable line of
our cases," id., at 94, Steel Co. reiterated: "The requirementthat jurisdiction be established as a threshold matter . . .

is `inflexible and without exception,' " id., at 94-95 (quoting
Mansfield, C. & L. M. R. Co. v. Swan, 111 U. S. 379, 382
(1884)); for "[ j]urisdiction is power to declare the law," and" `[w]ithout jurisdiction the court cannot proceed at all in any

cause,' " 523 U. S., at 94 (quoting Ex parte McCardle, 7 Wall.
506, 514 (1869)). The Court, in Steel Co., acknowledged that"the absolute purity" of the jurisdiction-first rule had been

diluted in a few extraordinary cases, 523 U. S., at 101, and
Justice O'Connor, joined by Justice Kennedy, joined the
majority on the understanding that the Court's opinion didnot catalog "an exhaustive list of circumstances" in which

exceptions to the solid rule were appropriate, id., at 110.

Steel Co. is the backdrop for the issue now before us: If, as
Steel Co. held, jurisdiction generally must precede merits in
dispositional order, must subject-matter jurisdiction precedepersonal jurisdiction on the decisional line? Or, do federal

district courts have discretion to avoid a difficult question

Opinion of the Court
of subject-matter jurisdiction when the absence of personaljurisdiction is the surer ground? The particular civil action

we confront was commenced in state court and removed tofederal court. The specific question on which we granted
certiorari asks "[w]hether a federal district court is abso-lutely barred in all circumstances from dismissing a removed
case for lack of personal jurisdiction without first decidingits subject-matter jurisdiction." Pet. for Cert. i.

We hold that in cases removed from state court to federalcourt, as in cases originating in federal court, there is no
unyielding jurisdictional hierarchy. Customarily, a federalcourt first resolves doubts about its jurisdiction over the subject matter, but there are circumstances in which a districtcourt appropriately accords priority to a personal jurisdiction inquiry. The proceeding before us is such a case.

The underlying controversy stems from a venture toproduce gas in the Heimdal Field of the Norwegian North

Sea. In 1976, respondents Marathon Oil Company and Mar-athon International Oil Company acquired Marathon Petroleum Company (Norway) (MPCN) and respondent MarathonPetroleum Norge (Norge). See App. 26.

to MPCN. See Record, Exhs. 61 and 62 to Document 64.In 1981, MPCN contracted to sell 70% of its share of the

Marathon Oil Company, Marathon International Oil Company, and Norge (collectively, Marathon) filed this lawsuit
against Ruhrgas in Texas state court on July 6, 1995, asserting state-law claims of fraud, tortious interference with prospective business relations, participation in breach of fiduciary duty, and civil conspiracy. See App. 33-40. Marathon
Oil Company and Marathon International Oil Company alleged that Ruhrgas and the other European buyers induced
them with false promises of "premium prices" and guaranteed pipeline tariffs to invest over $300 million in MPCN for
the development of the Heimdal Field and the erection of a
pipeline to Ruhrgas' plant in Germany. See id., at 26-28;
Brief for Respondents 1-2. Norge alleged that Ruhrgas' effective monopolization of the Heimdal gas diminished the
value of the license Norge had assigned to MPCN. See App.

that Ruhrgas had furthered its plans at three meetings in
Houston, Texas, and through a stream of correspondence directed to Marathon in Texas. See App. 229, 233.

Ruhrgas removed the case to the District Court for the
Southern District of Texas. See 145 F. 3d 211, 214 (CA5
1998). In its notice of removal, Ruhrgas asserted three
bases for federal jurisdiction: diversity of citizenship, see 28

Norge, the only nondiverse plaintiff, had been fraudulently

joined; 2 federal question, see $ 1331, because Marathon'sclaims "raise[d] substantial questions of foreign and international relations, which are incorporated into and form partof the federal common law," App. 274; and 9 U. S. C. $ 205,
which authorizes removal of cases "relat[ing] to" international arbitration agreements.3 See 145 F. 3d, at 214-215;115 F. 3d 315, 319-321 (CA5), vacated and rehearing en banc

granted, 129 F. 3d 746 (1997). Ruhrgas moved to dismissthe complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction. Marathon
moved to remand the case to the state court for lack of fed-eral subject-matter jurisdiction. See 145 F. 3d, at 215.

After permitting jurisdictional discovery, the DistrictCourt dismissed the case for lack of personal jurisdiction.
See App. 455. In so ruling, the District Court relied onFifth Circuit precedent allowing district courts to adjudicate
personal jurisdiction without first establishing subjectmatter jurisdiction. See id., at 445. Texas' long-arm stat-ute, see Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. $ 17.042 (1997),

authorizes personal jurisdiction to the extent allowed by theDue Process Clause of the Federal Constitution. See App.
446; Kawasaki Steel Corp. v. Middleton, 699 S. W. 2d 199,200 (Tex. 1985). The District Court addressed the constitutional question and concluded that Ruhrgas' contacts withTexas were insufficient to support personal jurisdiction.

2 A suit between "citizens of a State and citizens or subjects of a foreign
state" lies within federal diversity jurisdiction. 28 U. S. C. $ 1332(a)(2).
Section 1332 has been interpreted to require "complete diversity." See
Strawbridge v. Curtiss, 3 Cranch 267 (1806); R. Fallon, D. Meltzer, & D.
Shapiro, Hart and Wechsler's The Federal Courts and the Federal System
1528-1531 (4th ed. 1996). The foreign citizenship of defendant Ruhrgas,
a German corporation, and plaintiff Norge, a Norwegian corporation, rendered diversity incomplete.

3 Title 9 U. S. C. $ 205 allows removal "[w]here the subject matter of an

action or proceeding pending in a State court relates to an arbitration
agreement or award falling under the Convention [on the Recognition and
Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards of June 10, 1958]."

Opinion of the Court
See App. 445-454. Finding "no evidence that Ruhrgas en-gaged in any tortious conduct in Texas," id., at 450, the court

determined that Marathon's complaint did not present cir-cumstances adequately affiliating Ruhrgas with Texas, see
id., at 448.4A panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit concluded that "respec[t]" for "the proper balance of federalism"impelled it to turn first to "the formidable subject matter
jurisdiction issue presented." 115 F. 3d, at 318. After ex-amining and rejecting each of Ruhrgas' asserted bases of
federal jurisdiction, see id., at 319-321,5 the Court of Appealsvacated the judgment of the District Court and ordered the
case remanded to the state court, see id., at 321. This Courtdenied Ruhrgas' petition for a writ of certiorari, which was

4 Respecting the three meetings Ruhrgas attended in Houston, Texas,
see supra, at 579, the District Court concluded that Marathon had not
shown that Ruhrgas pursued the alleged pattern of fraud and misrepresentation during the Houston meetings. See App. 449. The court further found that Ruhrgas attended those meetings "due to the [Heimdal
Agreement] with MPCN." Id., at 450. As the Heimdal Agreement provides for arbitration in Sweden, the court reasoned, "Ruhrgas could not
have expected to be haled into Texas courts based on these meetings."
Ibid. The court also determined that Ruhrgas did not have "systematic
and continuous contacts with Texas" of the kind that would "subject it to
general jurisdiction in Texas." Id., at 453 (citing Helicopteros Nacionales
de Colombia, S. A. v. Hall, 466 U. S. 408 (1984)).

5 The Court of Appeals concluded that whether Norge had a legal interest in the Heimdal license notwithstanding its assignment to MPCN likely
turned on difficult questions of Norwegian law; Ruhrgas therefore could
not show, at the outset, that Norge had been fraudulently joined as a
plaintiff to defeat diversity. See 115 F. 3d 315, 319-320 (CA5), vacated
and rehearing en banc granted, 129 F. 3d 746 (1997). The appeals court
also determined that Marathon's claims did not "strike at the sovereignty
of a foreign nation," so as to raise a federal question on that account. 115
F. 3d, at 320. Finally, the court concluded that Marathon asserted claims
independent of the Heimdal Agreement and that the case therefore did
not "relat[e] to" an international arbitration agreement under 9 U. S. C.

$ 205. See 115 F. 3d, at 320-321.

582 RUHRGAS AG v. MARATHON OIL CO.

Opinion of the Court
limited to the question whether subject-matter jurisdictionexisted under 9 U. S. C. $ 205. See 522 U. S. 967 (1997).

The Fifth Circuit, on its own motion, granted rehearing enbanc, thereby vacating the panel decision. See 129 F. 3d 746
(1997). In a 9-to-7 decision, the en banc court held that, inremoved cases, district courts must decide issues of subjectmatter jurisdiction first, reaching issues of personal jurisdic-tion "only if subject-matter jurisdiction is found to exist."
145 F. 3d, at 214. Noting Steel Co.'s instruction thatsubject-matter jurisdiction must be " `established as a
threshold matter,' " 145 F. 3d, at 217 (quoting 523 U. S., at94), the Court of Appeals derived from that decision "counsel
against" recognition of judicial discretion to proceed directlyto personal jurisdiction. 145 F. 3d, at 218. The court limited its holding to removed cases; it perceived in those casesthe most grave threat that federal courts would "usur[p] . . .
state courts' residual jurisdiction." Id., at 219.6Writing for the seven dissenters, Judge Higginbotham
agreed that subject-matter jurisdiction ordinarily should beconsidered first. See id., at 231. If the challenge to personal jurisdiction involves no complex state-law questions,however, and is more readily resolved than the challenge to
subject-matter jurisdiction, the District Court, in the dis-senters' view, should take the easier route. See ibid.
Judge Higginbotham regarded the District Court's decisiondismissing Marathon's case as illustrative and appropriate:
While Ruhrgas' argument under 9 U. S. C. $ 205 presenteda difficult issue of first impression, its personal jurisdiction
challenge raised "[n]o substantial questions of purely statelaw," and "could be resolved relatively easily in [Ruhrgas']
favor." 145 F. 3d, at 232-233.

6 The Fifth Circuit remanded the case to the District Court for it to
consider the "nove[l]" subject-matter jurisdiction issues presented. 145
F. 3d 211, 225 (CA5 1998). The appeals court "express[ed] no opinion" on
the vacated panel decision which had held that the District Court lacked
subject-matter jurisdiction. Id., at 225, n. 23.

Opinion of the Court
We granted certiorari, 525 U. S. 1039 (1998), to resolve aconflict between the Circuits

7 and now reverse.

III
Steel Co. held that Article III generally requires a federalcourt to satisfy itself of its jurisdiction over the subject matter before it considers the merits of a case. "For a court topronounce upon [the merits] when it has no jurisdiction to do
so," Steel Co. declared, "is . . . for a court to act ultra vires."523 U. S., at 101-102. The Fifth Circuit incorrectly read
Steel Co. to teach that subject-matter jurisdiction must befound to exist, not only before a federal court reaches the
merits, but also before personal jurisdiction is addressed.See 145 F. 3d, at 218.

A
The Court of Appeals accorded priority to the requirementof subject-matter jurisdiction because it is nonwaivable and

delimits federal-court power, while restrictions on a court'sjurisdiction over the person are waivable and protect individual rights. See id., at 217-218. The character ofthe two jurisdictional bedrocks unquestionably differs.
Subject-matter limitations on federal jurisdiction serve insti-tutional interests. They keep the federal courts within the
bounds the Constitution and Congress have prescribed. Ac-cordingly, subject-matter delineations must be policed by the
courts on their own initiative even at the highest level. See
Steel Co., 523 U. S., at 94-95; Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 12(h)(3)("Whenever it appears . . . that the court lacks jurisdiction

of the subject matter, the court shall dismiss the action.");28 U. S. C. $ 1447(c) (1994 ed., Supp. III) ("If at any time before final judgment [in a removed case] it appears that the

7 The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has concluded that district
courts have discretion to dismiss a removed case for want of personal
jurisdiction without reaching the issue of subject-matter jurisdiction.

Opinion of the Court
district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the case shallbe remanded.").

Personal jurisdiction, on the other hand, "represents a re-striction on judicial power . . . as a matter of individual liberty." Insurance Corp. of Ireland v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, 456 U. S. 694, 702 (1982). Therefore, a partymay insist that the limitation be observed, or he may forgo

that right, effectively consenting to the court's exercise ofadjudicatory authority. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 12(h)(1)
(defense of lack of jurisdiction over the person waivable);
Insurance Corp. of Ireland, 456 U. S., at 703 (same).

These distinctions do not mean that subject-matter jurisdiction is ever and always the more "fundamental." Personal jurisdiction, too, is "an essential element of the jurisdiction of a district . . . court," without which the court is
"powerless to proceed to an adjudication." Employers Reinsurance Corp. v. Bryant, 299 U. S. 374, 382 (1937). In this
case, indeed, the impediment to subject-matter jurisdiction
on which Marathon relies--lack of complete diversity--rests
on statutory interpretation, not constitutional command.
Marathon joined an alien plaintiff (Norge) as well as an alien
defendant (Ruhrgas). If the joinder of Norge is legitimate,
the complete diversity required by 28 U. S. C. $ 1332 (1994
ed. and Supp. III), but not by Article III, see State Farm
Fire & Casualty Co. v. Tashire, 386 U. S. 523, 530-531 (1967),
is absent. In contrast, Ruhrgas relies on the constitutional
safeguard of due process to stop the court from proceeding
to the merits of the case. See Insurance Corp. of Ireland,
456 U. S., at 702 ("The requirement that a court have personal jurisdiction flows . . . from the Due Process Clause.").

While Steel Co. reasoned that subject-matter jurisdiction
necessarily precedes a ruling on the merits, the same principle does not dictate a sequencing of jurisdictional issues.
"[A] court that dismisses on . . . non-merits grounds such
as . . . personal jurisdiction, before finding subject-matter
jurisdiction, makes no assumption of law-declaring power

Opinion of the Court
that violates the separation of powers principles underlyingMansfield and Steel Company." In re Papandreou, 139

F. 3d 247, 255 (CADC 1998). It is hardly novel for a federalcourt to choose among threshold grounds for denying audience to a case on the merits. Thus, as the Court observedin

Steel Co., district courts do not overstep Article III limitswhen they decline jurisdiction of state-law claims on discretionary grounds without determining whether those claimsfall within their pendent jurisdiction, see Moor v. County
of Alameda, 411 U. S. 693, 715-716 (1973), or abstain underYounger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37 (1971), without deciding
whether the parties present a case or controversy, see Ellisv.

Dyson, 421 U. S. 426, 433-434 (1975). See Steel Co., 523U. S., at 100-101, n. 3; cf. Arizonans for Official English v.

Arizona, 520 U. S. 43, 66-67 (1997) (pretermitting challengeto appellants' standing and dismissing on mootness grounds).

B
Maintaining that subject-matter jurisdiction must be de-cided first even when the litigation originates in federal

court, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 21; Brief for Respondents 13, Mar-athon sees removal as the more offensive case, on the ground
that the dignity of state courts is immediately at stake. Ifa federal court dismisses a removed case for want of personal
jurisdiction, that determination may preclude the partiesfrom relitigating the very same personal jurisdiction issue in
state court. See Baldwin v. Iowa State Traveling Men's
Assn., 283 U. S. 522, 524-527 (1931) (personal jurisdictionruling has issue-preclusive effect).

Issue preclusion in subsequent state-court litigation, how-ever, may also attend a federal court's subject-matter determination. Ruhrgas hypothesizes, for example, a defendantwho removes on diversity grounds a state-court suit seeking
$50,000 in compensatory and $1 million in punitive damagesfor breach of contract. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 10-11. If the
district court determines that state law does not allow puni526US2 Unit: $U57 [12-11-00 20:46:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN
586 RUHRGAS AG v. MARATHON OIL CO.

Opinion of the Court
tive damages for breach of contract and therefore remandsthe removed action for failure to satisfy the amount in

controversy, see 28 U. S. C. $ 1332(a) (1994 ed., Supp. III)($75,000), the federal court's conclusion will travel back with
the case. Assuming a fair airing of the issue in federal
court, that court's ruling on permissible state-law damagesmay bind the parties in state court, although it will set no

precedent otherwise governing state-court adjudications.See

Chicot County Drainage Dist. v. Baxter State Bank, 308
U. S. 371, 376 (1940) ("[Federal courts'] determinations of[whether they have jurisdiction to entertain a case] may not

be assailed collaterally."); Restatement (Second) of Judgments $ 12, p. 115 (1980) ("When a court has rendered a judgment in a contested action, the judgment [ordinarily] precludes the parties from litigating the question of the court's
subject matter jurisdiction in subsequent litigation."). Similarly, as Judge Higginbotham observed, our "dualistic . . .
system of federal and state courts" allows federal courts to
make issue-preclusive rulings about state law in the exercise
of supplemental jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C. $ 1367. 145
F. 3d, at 231, and n. 7.

Most essentially, federal and state courts are complementary systems for administering justice in our Nation. Cooperation and comity, not competition and conflict, are essential
to the federal design. A State's dignitary interest bears
consideration when a district court exercises discretion in a
case of this order. If personal jurisdiction raises "difficult
questions of [state] law," and subject-matter jurisdiction is
resolved "as eas[ily]" as personal jurisdiction, a district court
will ordinarily conclude that "federalism concerns tip the
scales in favor of initially ruling on the motion to remand."
Allen v. Ferguson, 791 F. 2d 611, 616 (CA7 1986). In other
cases, however, the district court may find that concerns of
judicial economy and restraint are overriding. See, e. g.,
Asociacion Nacional de Pescadores v. Dow Quimica, 988
F. 2d 559, 566-567 (CA5 1993) (if removal is nonfrivolous and

Opinion of the Court
personal jurisdiction turns on federal constitutional issues,"federal intrusion into state courts' authority . . . is minimized"). The federal design allows leeway for sensitivejudgments of this sort. " `Our Federalism' "

"does not mean blind deference to `States' Rights' anymore than it means centralization of control over every
important issue in our National Government and itscourts. The Framers rejected both these courses.
What the concept does represent is a system in whichthere is sensitivity to the legitimate interests of both
State and National Governments." Younger, 401 U. S.,at 44.

The Fifth Circuit and Marathon posit that state-court de-fendants will abuse the federal system with opportunistic removals. A discretionary rule, they suggest, will encouragemanufactured, convoluted federal subject-matter theories
designed to wrench cases from state court. See 145 F. 3d,at 219; Brief for Respondents 28-29. This specter of unwarranted removal, we have recently observed, "rests on an as-sumption we do not indulge--that district courts generally
will not comprehend, or will balk at applying, the rules onremoval Congress has prescribed. . . . The well-advised
defendant . . . will foresee the likely outcome of an unwar-ranted removal--a swift and nonreviewable remand order,
see 28 U. S. C. $$ 1447(c), (d), attended by the displeasure of adistrict court whose authority has been improperly invoked."
Caterpillar Inc. v. Lewis, 519 U. S. 61, 77-78 (1996).

C
In accord with Judge Higginbotham, we recognize that inmost instances subject-matter jurisdiction will involve no arduous inquiry. See 145 F. 3d, at 229 ("engag[ing]" subject-matter jurisdiction "at the outset of a case . . . [is] often . . .
the most efficient way of going"). In such cases, both expe-dition and sensitivity to state courts' coequal stature should

Opinion of the Court
impel the federal court to dispose of that issue first. SeeCantor Fitzgerald, L. P. v. Peaslee, 88 F. 3d 152, 155 (CA2

1996) (a court disposing of a case on personal jurisdictiongrounds "should be convinced that the challenge to the
court's subject-matter jurisdiction is not easily resolved").Where, as here, however, a district court has before it a
straightforward personal jurisdiction issue presenting nocomplex question of state law, and the alleged defect in
subject-matter jurisdiction raises a difficult and novel ques-tion, the court does not abuse its discretion by turning directly to personal jurisdiction.8

* * *
For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of Ap-peals is reversed, and the case is remanded for proceedings

consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.

8 Ruhrgas suggests that it would be appropriate simply to affirm the
District Court's holding that it lacked personal jurisdiction over Ruhrgas.
See Brief for Petitioner 38-39, and n. 20. That issue is not within the
question presented and is properly considered by the Fifth Circuit on
remand.

I

The State of New Jersey's prayer that she be declared to
be sovereign over the landfilled portions of Ellis Island
added by the Federal Government after 1834 is granted and
the State of New York is enjoined from enforcing her laws
or asserting sovereignty over the portions of Ellis Island
that lie within the State of New Jersey's sovereign boundary
as set forth in paragraph 4 of this decree.

II
The sovereign boundary between the State of New Jersey
and the State of New York is as set forth in Article First of
the Compact of 1834, enacted into law in both States and
approved by Congress.

WILSON et al. v. LAYNE, DEPUTY UNITED STATESMARSHAL,

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fourth circuit

No. 98-83. Argued March 24, 1999--Decided May 24, 1999
While executing a warrant to arrest petitioners' son in their home, respondents, deputy federal marshals and local sheriff's deputies, invited
a newspaper reporter and a photographer to accompany them. The
warrant made no mention of such a "media ride-along." The officers'
early morning entry into the home prompted a confrontation with petitioners, and a protective sweep revealed that the son was not in the
house. The reporters observed and photographed the incident but
were not involved in the execution of the warrant. Their newspaper
never published the photographs they took of the incident. Petitioners
sued the officers in their personal capacities for money damages under
Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388 (the federal marshals), and 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 (the sheriff's deputies), contending
that the officers' actions in bringing the media to observe and record
the attempted execution of the arrest warrant violated their Fourth
Amendment rights. The District Court denied respondents' motion for
summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity. In reversing,
the Court of Appeals declined to decide whether the officers' actions
violated the Fourth Amendment, but concluded that because no court
had held at the time of the search that media presence during a police
entry into a residence constituted such a violation, the right allegedly
violated was not "clearly established" and thus respondents were entitled to qualified immunity.

Held: A "media ride-along" in a home violates the Fourth Amendment,

but because the state of the law was not clearly established at the time
the entry in this case took place, respondent officers are entitled to qualified immunity. Pp. 609-618.

(a) The qualified immunity analysis is identical in suits under $ 1983
and Bivens. See, e. g., Graham v. Connor, 490 U. S. 386, 394, n. 9. A
court evaluating a qualified immunity claim must first determine
whether the plaintiff has alleged the deprivation of a constitutional
right, and, if so, proceed to determine whether that right was clearly
established at the time of the violation. Conn v. Gabbert, ante, at 290.
P. 609.

604 WILSON v. LAYNE

Syllabus
(b) It violates the Fourth Amendment rights of homeowners for police to bring members of the media or other third parties into their home
during the execution of a warrant when the presence of the third parties
in the home was not in aid of the warrant's execution. The Amendment
embodies centuries-old principles of respect for the privacy of the home,
which apply where, as here, police enter a home under the authority of
an arrest warrant in order to take into custody the suspect named in
the warrant, Payton v. New York, 445 U. S. 573, 602-604. It does not
necessarily follow from the fact that the officers were entitled to enter
petitioners' home that they were entitled to bring a reporter and a photographer with them. The Fourth Amendment requires that police
actions in execution of a warrant be related to the objectives of the
authorized intrusion. See, e. g., Arizona v. Hicks, 480 U. S. 321, 325.
Certainly the presence of the reporters, who did not engage in the execution of the warrant or assist the police in their task, was not related
to the objective of the authorized intrusion, the apprehension of petitioners' son. Taken in their entirety, the reasons advanced by respondents to support the reporters' presence--publicizing the government's
efforts to combat crime, facilitating accurate reporting on law enforcement activities, minimizing police abuses, and protecting suspects and
the officers--fall short of justifying media ride-alongs. Although the
presence of third parties during the execution of a warrant may in some
circumstances be constitutionally permissible, the presence of these
third parties was not. Pp. 609-614.

(c) Petitioners' Fourth Amendment right was not clearly established
at the time of the search. "Clearly established" for qualified immunity
purposes means that the contours of the right must be sufficiently clear
that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right. His very action need not previously have been held
unlawful, but in the light of pre-existing law its unlawfulness must be
apparent. E. g., Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U. S. 635, 640. It was not
unreasonable for a police officer at the time at issue to have believed
that bringing media observers along during the execution of an arrest
warrant (even in a home) was lawful. First, the constitutional question
presented by this case is by no means open and shut. Accurate media
coverage of police activities serves an important public purpose, and it
is not obvious from the Fourth Amendment's general principles that the
officers' conduct in this case violated the Amendment. Second, petitioners have not cited any cases of controlling authority in their jurisdiction at the time in question which clearly established the rule on which
they seek to rely, nor have they identified a consensus of cases of persuasive authority such that a reasonable officer could not have believed that
his actions were lawful. Finally, the federal marshals in this case relied

Opinion of the Court
on a Marshals Service ride-along policy which explicitly contemplated
media entry into private homes, and the sheriff's deputies had a ridealong program that did not expressly prohibit such entries. The state
of the law was at best undeveloped at the relevant time, and the officers
cannot have been expected to predict the future course of constitutional
law. E. g., Procunier v. Navarette, 434 U. S. 555, 561. Pp. 614-618.

606 WILSON v. LAYNE

Opinion of the Court
of the law was not clearly established at the time the searchin this case took place, the officers are entitled to the defense

of qualified immunity. I

In early 1992, the Attorney General of the United Statesapproved "Operation Gunsmoke," a special national fugitive
apprehension program in which United States Marshalsworked with state and local police to apprehend dangerous
criminals. The "Operation Gunsmoke" policy statement ex-plained that the operation was to concentrate on "armed individuals wanted on federal and/or state and local warrantsfor serious drug and other violent felonies." App. 15. This
effective program ultimately resulted in over 3,000 arrestsin 40 metropolitan areas. Brief for Federal Respondents
Layne et al. 2.One of the dangerous fugitives identified as a target of
"Operation Gunsmoke" was Dominic Wilson, the son of peti-tioners Charles and Geraldine Wilson. Dominic Wilson had
violated his probation on previous felony charges of robbery,theft, and assault with intent to rob, and the police computer
listed "caution indicators" that he was likely to be armed, toresist arrest, and to "assaul[t] police." App. 40. The computer also listed his address as 909 North StoneStreet Avenue in Rockville, Maryland. Unknown to the police, thiswas actually the home of petitioners, Dominic Wilson's parents. Thus, in April 1992, the Circuit Court for Montgom-ery County issued three arrest warrants for Dominic Wilson,
one for each of his probation violations. The warrants wereeach addressed to "any duly authorized peace officer," and
commanded such officers to arrest him and bring him "imme-diately" before the Circuit Court to answer an indictment as
to his probation violation. The warrants made no mention
of media presence or assistance.1

1 The warrants were identical in all relevant respects. By way of example, one of them read as follows:

Opinion of the Court
In the early morning hours of April 16, 1992, a Gunsmoke
team of Deputy United States Marshals and Montgomery
County Police officers assembled to execute the Dominic Wilson warrants. The team was accompanied by a reporter and
a photographer from the Washington Post, who had been invited by the Marshals to accompany them on their mission
as part of a Marshals Service ride-along policy.

At around 6:45 a.m., the officers, with media representatives in tow, entered the dwelling at 909 North StoneStreet
Avenue in the Lincoln Park neighborhood of Rockville.
Petitioners Charles and Geraldine Wilson were still in bed
when they heard the officers enter the home. Petitioner
Charles Wilson, dressed only in a pair of briefs, ran into the
living room to investigate. Discovering at least five men in
street clothes with guns in his living room, he angrily demanded that they state their business, and repeatedly cursed
the officers. Believing him to be an angry Dominic Wilson,
the officers quickly subdued him on the floor. Geraldine
Wilson next entered the living room to investigate, wearing
only a nightgown. She observed her husband being restrained by the armed officers.

When their protective sweep was completed, the officers
learned that Dominic Wilson was not in the house, and they
departed. During the time that the officers were in the
home, the Washington Post photographer took numerous pictures. The print reporter was also apparently in the living

Opinion of the Court
Charles Wilson. At no time, however, were the reporters
involved in the execution of the arrest warrant. Brief for
Federal Respondents Layne et al. 4. The Washington Post
never published its photographs of the incident.

Petitioners sued the law enforcement officials in their personal capacities for money damages under Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388 (1971) (the U. S.
Marshals Service respondents), and Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42
U. S. C. $ 1983 (the Montgomery County Sheriff 's Department respondents). They contended that the officers' actions in bringing members of the media to observe and record the attempted execution of the arrest warrant violated
their Fourth Amendment rights. The District Court denied
respondents' motion for summary judgment on the basis of
qualified immunity.

On interlocutory appeal to the Court of Appeals, a divided
panel reversed and held that respondents were entitled to
qualified immunity. The case was twice reheard en banc,
where a divided Court of Appeals again upheld the defense
of qualified immunity. The Court of Appeals declined to decide whether the actions of the police violated the Fourth
Amendment. It concluded instead that because no court
had held (at the time of the search) that media presence during a police entry into a residence violated the Fourth
Amendment, the right allegedly violated by respondents was
not "clearly established" and thus qualified immunity was
proper. 141 F. 3d 111 (CA4 1998). Five judges dissented,
arguing that the officers' actions did violate the Fourth
Amendment, and that the clearly established protections of
the Fourth Amendment were violated in this case. Id., at
119 (opinion of Murnaghan, J.)

Recognizing a split among the Circuits on this issue, we
granted certiorari in this case and another raising the same
question, Hanlon v. Berger, 525 U. S. 981 (1998), and now
affirm the Court of Appeals, although by different reasoning.

Opinion of the Court

II
Petitioners sued the federal officials under Bivens andthe state officials under $ 1983. Both

Bivens and $ 1983allow a plaintiff to seek money damages from government

officials who have violated his Fourth Amendment rights.See $ 1983; Bivens, supra, at 397. But government officials
performing discretionary functions generally are granted aqualified immunity and are "shielded from liability for civil
damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a rea-sonable person would have known."

Harlow v. Fitzgerald,
457 U. S. 800, 818 (1982).Although this case involves suits under both $ 1983 and

Bivens, the qualified immunity analysis is identical undereither cause of action. See,

e. g., Graham v. Connor, 490
U. S. 386, 394, n. 9 (1989); Malley v. Briggs, 475 U. S. 335, 340,
n. 2 (1986). A court evaluating a claim of qualified immunity"must first determine whether the plaintiff has alleged the

deprivation of an actual constitutional right at all, and if so,proceed to determine whether that right was clearly established at the time of the alleged violation." Conn v. Gabbert, ante, at 290. This order of procedure is designed to
"spare a defendant not only unwarranted liability, but unwar-ranted demands customarily imposed upon those defending

a long drawn out lawsuit." Siegert v. Gilley, 500 U. S. 226,
232 (1991). Deciding the constitutional question before ad-dressing the qualified immunity question also promotes clarity in the legal standards for official conduct, to the benefitof both the officers and the general public. See

County of
Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U. S. 833, 840-842, n. 5 (1998). Wenow turn to the Fourth Amendment question.

In 1604, an English court made the now-famous observa-tion that "the house of every one is to him as his castle and
fortress, as well for his defence against injury and violence,
as for his repose." Semayne's Case, 5 Co. Rep. 91a, 91b, 77

610 WILSON v. LAYNE

Opinion of the Court
Eng. Rep. 194, 195 (K. B.). In his Commentaries on theLaws of England, William Blackstone noted that

"the law of England has so particular and tender a re-gard to the immunity of a man's house, that it stiles it
his castle, and will never suffer it to be violated withimpunity: agreeing herein with the sentiments of antient
Rome . . . . For this reason no doors can in generalbe broken open to execute any civil process; though,
in criminal causes, the public safety supersedes theprivate." 4 Commentaries 223 (1765-1769).

The Fourth Amendment embodies this centuries-old princi-ple of respect for the privacy of the home: "The right of the
people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and ef-fects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not
be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable
cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly de-scribing the place to be searched, and the persons or things

to be seized." U. S. Const., Amdt. 4 (emphasis added). Seealso

United States v. United States Dist. Court for Eastern
Dist. of Mich., 407 U. S. 297, 313 (1972) ("[P]hysical entry ofthe home is the chief evil against which the wording of the

Fourth Amendment is directed").Our decisions have applied these basic principles of the
Fourth Amendment to situations, like the one in this case, in
which police enter a home under the authority of an arrestwarrant in order to take into custody the suspect named in

the warrant. In Payton v. New York, 445 U. S. 573, 602(1980), we noted that although clear in its protection of the
home, the common-law tradition at the time of the drafting
of the Fourth Amendment was ambivalent on the question
whether police could enter a home without a warrant. We
were ultimately persuaded that the "overriding respect
for the sanctity of the home that has been embedded in our
traditions since the origins of the Republic" meant that absent a warrant or exigent circumstances, police could not

Opinion of the Court
enter a home to make an arrest. Id., at 601, 603-604. Wedecided that "an arrest warrant founded on probable cause

implicitly carries with it the limited authority to enter adwelling in which the suspect lives when there is reason to
believe the suspect is within." Id., at 603.

Here, of course, the officers had such a warrant, and theywere undoubtedly entitled to enter the Wilson home in order

to execute the arrest warrant for Dominic Wilson. But itdoes not necessarily follow that they were entitled to bring
a newspaper reporter and a photographer with them. In
Horton v. California, 496 U. S. 128, 140 (1990), we held "[i]f
the scope of the search exceeds that permitted by the terms
of a validly issued warrant or the character of the relevant
exception from the warrant requirement, the subsequent seizure is unconstitutional without more." While this does not
mean that every police action while inside a home must be
explicitly authorized by the text of the warrant, see Michigan v. Summers, 452 U. S. 692, 705 (1981) (Fourth Amendment allows temporary detainer of homeowner while police
search the home pursuant to warrant), the Fourth Amendment does require that police actions in execution of a warrant be related to the objectives of the authorized intrusion,
see Arizona v. Hicks, 480 U. S. 321, 325 (1987). See also
Maryland v. Garrison, 480 U. S. 79, 87 (1987) ("[T]he purposes justifying a police search strictly limit the permissible
extent of the search").

Certainly the presence of reporters inside the home was
not related to the objectives of the authorized intrusion.
Respondents concede that the reporters did not engage in
the execution of the warrant, and did not assist the police in
their task. The reporters therefore were not present for
any reason related to the justification for police entry into
the home--the apprehension of Dominic Wilson.

This is not a case in which the presence of the third parties
directly aided in the execution of the warrant. Where the
police enter a home under the authority of a warrant to

526US3 Unit: $U59 [12-11-00 20:56:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN
612 WILSON v. LAYNE

Opinion of the Court
search for stolen property, the presence of third parties forthe purpose of identifying the stolen property has long been

approved by this Court and our common-law tradition. See,
e. g., Entick v. Carrington, 19 How. St. Tr. 1029, 1067 (K. B.
1765) (in search for stolen goods case, " `[t]he owner must
swear that the goods are lodged in such a place. He mustattend at the execution of the warrant to shew them to the

officer, who must see that they answer the description")(quoted with approval in

Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S.
616, 628 (1886)).Respondents argue that the presence of the Washington

Post reporters in the Wilsons' home nonetheless served a
number of legitimate law enforcement purposes. They first
assert that officers should be able to exercise reasonable discretion about when it would "further their law enforcement
mission to permit members of the news media to accompany
them in executing a warrant." Brief for Federal Respondents Layne et al. 15. But this claim ignores the importance
of the right of residential privacy at the core of the Fourth
Amendment. It may well be that media ride-alongs further
the law enforcement objectives of the police in a general
sense, but that is not the same as furthering the purposes of
the search. Were such generalized "law enforcement objectives" themselves sufficient to trump the Fourth Amendment, the protections guaranteed by that Amendment's text
would be significantly watered down.

Respondents next argue that the presence of third parties
could serve the law enforcement purpose of publicizing the
government's efforts to combat crime, and facilitate accurate
reporting on law enforcement activities. There is certainly
language in our opinions interpreting the First Amendment
which points to the importance of "the press" in informing
the general public about the administration of criminal justice. In Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn, 420 U. S. 469, 491-
492 (1975), for example, we said "in a society in which each
individual has but limited time and resources with which to

526US3 Unit: $U59 [12-11-00 20:56:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN

613Cite as: 526 U. S. 603 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
observe at first hand the operations of his government, herelies necessarily upon the press to bring to him in convenient form the facts of those operations." See also Richmond
Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia, 448 U. S. 555, 572-573 (1980).
No one could gainsay the truth of these observations, or the
importance of the First Amendment in protecting press free-dom from abridgment by the government. But the Fourth

Amendment also protects a very important right, and in thepresent case it is in terms of that right that the media ridealongs must be judged.Surely the possibility of good public relations for the police
is simply not enough, standing alone, to justify the ride-along
intrusion into a private home. And even the need for accurate reporting on police issues in general bears no direct relation to the constitutional justification for the police intrusion into a home in order to execute a felony arrest warrant.

Finally, respondents argue that the presence of third parties could serve in some situations to minimize police abuses
and protect suspects, and also to protect the safety of the
officers. While it might be reasonable for police officers to
themselves videotape home entries as part of a "quality control" effort to ensure that the rights of homeowners are
being respected, or even to preserve evidence, cf. Ohio v.
Robinette, 519 U. S. 33, 35 (1996) (noting the use of a
"mounted video camera" to record the details of a routine
traffic stop), such a situation is significantly different from
the media presence in this case. The Washington Post reporters in the Wilsons' home were working on a story for
their own purposes. They were not present for the purpose
of protecting the officers, much less the Wilsons. A private
photographer was acting for private purposes, as evidenced
in part by the fact that the newspaper and not the police
retained the photographs. Thus, although the presence of
third parties during the execution of a warrant may in some
circumstances be constitutionally permissible, see supra, at
611-612, the presence of these third parties was not.

614 WILSON v. LAYNE

Opinion of the Court
The reasons advanced by respondents, taken in their en-tirety, fall short of justifying the presence of media inside a

home. We hold that it is a violation of the Fourth Amend-ment for police to bring members of the media or other third
parties into a home during the execution of a warrant whenthe presence of the third parties in the home was not in aid
of the execution of the warrant.2

III
Since the police action in this case violated petitioners'Fourth Amendment right, we now must decide whether this

right was clearly established at the time of the search. SeeSiegert, 500 U. S., at 232-233. As noted above, Part II,
supra, government officials performing discretionary func-tions generally are granted a qualified immunity and are
"shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their con-duct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would haveknown."

Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 818. Whatthis means in practice is that "whether an official protected

by qualified immunity may be held personally liable for anallegedly unlawful official action generally turns on the `objective legal reasonableness' of the action, assessed in lightof the legal rules that were `clearly established' at the time
it was taken." Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U. S. 635, 639(1987) (citing

Harlow, supra, at 819); see also Graham v.Connor, 490 U. S., at 397.

In Anderson, we explained that what "clearly established"means in this context depends largely "upon the level of generality at which the relevant `legal rule' is to be identified."483 U. S., at 639. "[C]learly established" for purposes of

2 Even though such actions might violate the Fourth Amendment, if the
police are lawfully present, the violation of the Fourth Amendment is the
presence of the media and not the presence of the police in the home. We
have no occasion here to decide whether the exclusionary rule would apply
to any evidence discovered or developed by the media representatives.

526US3 Unit: $U59 [12-11-00 20:56:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN

615Cite as: 526 U. S. 603 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
qualified immunity means that "[t]he contours of the rightmust be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right. This isnot to say that an official action is protected by qualified
immunity unless the very action in question has previously
been held unlawful, but it is to say that in the light of pre-existing law the unlawfulness must be apparent."

Id., at
640 (citations omitted); see also United States v. Lanier, 520U. S. 259, 270 (1997).

It could plausibly be asserted that any violation ofthe Fourth Amendment is "clearly established," since it
is clearly established that the protections of the Fourth
Amendment apply to the actions of police. Some variation
of this theory of qualified immunity is urged upon us by petitioners, Brief for Petitioners 37, and seems to have been at
the core of the dissenting opinion in the Court of Appeals,
see 141 F. 3d, at 123. However, as we explained in Anderson, the right allegedly violated must be defined at the appropriate level of specificity before a court can determine if it
was clearly established. 483 U. S., at 641. In this case, the
appropriate question is the objective inquiry whether a reasonable officer could have believed that bringing members of
the media into a home during the execution of an arrest warrant was lawful, in light of clearly established law and the
information the officers possessed. Cf. ibid.

We hold that it was not unreasonable for a police officer in
April 1992 to have believed that bringing media observers
along during the execution of an arrest warrant (even in a
home) was lawful. First, the constitutional question presented by this case is by no means open and shut. The
Fourth Amendment protects the rights of homeowners from
entry without a warrant, but there was a warrant here. The
question is whether the invitation to the media exceeded the
scope of the search authorized by the warrant. Accurate
media coverage of police activities serves an important public purpose, and it is not obvious from the general principles

Opinion of the Court
of the Fourth Amendment that the conduct of the officers inthis case violated the Amendment.

Second, although media ride-alongs of one sort or anotherhad apparently become a common police practice,

3 in 1992

there were no judicial opinions holding that this practice be-came unlawful when it entered a home. The only published

decision directly on point was a state intermediate court de-cision which, though it did not engage in an extensive Fourth
Amendment analysis, nonetheless held that such conduct wasnot unreasonable.

Prahl v. Brosamle, 98 Wis. 2d 130, 154-155, 295 N. W. 2d 768, 782 (App. 1980). From the federal

courts, the parties have only identified two unpublished Dis-trict Court decisions dealing with media entry into homes,
each of which upheld the search on unorthodox non-FourthAmendment right to privacy theories.

Moncrief v. Hanton,10 Media L. Rptr. 1620 (ND Ohio 1984); Higbee v. TimesAdvocate, 5 Media L. Rptr. 2372 (SD Cal. 1980). Thesecases, of course, cannot "clearly establish" that media entry
into homes during a police ride-along violates the FourthAmendment.

At a slightly higher level of generality, petitioners point to
Bills v. Aseltine, 958 F. 2d 697 (CA6 1992), in which theCourt of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held that there were

material issues of fact precluding summary judgment on thequestion whether police exceeded the scope of a search warrant by allowing a private security guard to participate inthe search to identify stolen property other than that described in the warrant. Id., at 709. Bills, which was de-cided a mere five weeks before the events of this case, did
anticipate today's holding that police may not bring alongthird parties during an entry into a private home pursuant

3 See, e. g., Florida Publishing Co. v. Fletcher, 340 So. 2d 914, 919 (1976)
(it " `is a widespread practice of long-standing' " for media to accompany
officers into homes), cert. denied, 431 U. S. 930 (1977); Zoglin, Live on the
Vice Beat, Time, Dec. 22, 1986, p. 60 (noting "the increasingly common
practice of letting TV crews tag along on drug raids").

Opinion of the Court
to a warrant for purposes unrelated to those justifying thewarrant. Id., at 706. However, we cannot say that even in

light of Bills, the law on third-party entry into homes wasclearly established in April 1992. Petitioners have not
brought to our attention any cases of controlling authorityin their jurisdiction at the time of the incident that clearly
established the rule on which they seek to rely, nor havethey identified a consensus of cases of persuasive authority
such that a reasonable officer could not have believed thathis actions were lawful.

Finally, important to our conclusion was the reliance bythe United States marshals in this case on a Marshals Service ride-along policy that explicitly contemplated that mediawho engaged in ride-alongs might enter private homes with
their cameras as part of fugitive apprehension arrests.4 TheMontgomery County Sheriff 's Department also at this time
had a ride-along program that did not expressly prohibitmedia entry into private homes. Deposition of Sheriff Raymond M. Kight, in No. PJM-94-1718, p. 8. Such a policy, ofcourse, could not make reasonable a belief that was contrary
to a decided body of case law. But here the state of the lawas to third parties accompanying police on home entries was
at best undeveloped, and it was not unreasonable for lawenforcement officers to look and rely on their formal ridealong policies.Given such an undeveloped state of the law, the officers in
this case cannot have been "expected to predict the futurecourse of constitutional law."

Procunier v. Navarette, 434

4 A booklet distributed to marshals recommended that "fugitive apprehension cases . . . normally offer the best possibilities for ride-alongs."
App. 4-5. In its discussion of the best way to make ride-alongs useful to
the media and portray the Marshals Service in a favorable light, the booklet noted that reporters were likely to want to be able to shoot "good
action footage, not just a mop-up scene." It advised agents that "[i]f the
arrest is planned to take place inside a house or building, agree ahead of
time on when the camera can enter and who will give the signal." Id.,

308, 321 (1975); Pierson v. Ray, 386 U. S. 547, 557 (1967).
Between the time of the events of this case and today's decision, a split among the Federal Circuits in fact developed
on the question whether media ride-alongs that enter homes
subject the police to money damages. See 141 F. 3d, at 118-
119; Ayeni v. Mottola, 35 F. 3d 680 (CA2 1994), cert. denied,

129 F. 3d 505 (CA9 1997), cert. granted, 525 U. S. 981 (1998).
If judges thus disagree on a constitutional question, it is unfair to subject police to money damages for picking the losing
side of the controversy.

For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of
Appeals is affirmed. It is so ordered.

Justice Stevens, concurring in part and dissenting in
part.

Like every other federal appellate judge who has addressed the question, I share the Court's opinion that it violates the Fourth Amendment for police to bring members of
the media or other third parties into a private dwelling during the execution of a warrant unless the homeowner has
consented or the presence of the third parties is in aid of the
execution of the warrant. I therefore join Parts I and II of
the Court's opinion.

In my view, however, the homeowner's right to protection
against this type of trespass was clearly established long before April 16, 1992. My sincere respect for the competence
of the typical member of the law enforcement profession precludes my assent to the suggestion that "a reasonable officer
could have believed that bringing members of the media into
a home during the execution of an arrest warrant was lawful." Ante, at 615. I therefore disagree with the Court's

Opinion of Stevens, J.
resolution of the conflict in the Circuits on the qualified immunity issue.1 The clarity of the constitutional rule, a federal statute (18 U. S. C. $ 3105), common-law decisions, and
the testimony of the senior law enforcement officer all support my position that it has long been clearly established
that officers may not bring third parties into private homes
to witness the execution of a warrant. By contrast, the
Court's opposing view finds support in the following sources:
its bare assertion that the constitutional question "is by no
means open and shut," ante, at 615; three judicial opinions
that did not directly address the constitutional question,
ante, at 616; and a public relations booklet prepared by someone in the United States Marshals Service that never mentions allowing representatives of the media to enter private
property without the owner's consent, ante, at 617.

I
In its decision today the Court has not announced a new
rule of constitutional law. Rather, it has refused to recognize an entirely unprecedented request for an exception to a
well-established principle. Police action in the execution of
a warrant must be strictly limited to the objectives of the
authorized intrusion. That principle, like the broader protection provided by the Fourth Amendment itself, represents the confluence of two important sources: our English
forefathers' traditional respect for the sanctity of the private

1 It is important to emphasize that there is no split in Circuit authority on the merits of the constitutional issue. Nor, as I explain infra, at
622-624, do I believe that any District Court had reached a conclusion at
odds with the Court's Fourth Amendment holding. Any conflict was limited to the qualified immunity issue. Three Circuits rejected the defense
whereas the Fourth and the Eighth accepted it. See Ayeni v. Mottola,

home and the American colonists' hatred of the generalwarrant.

The contours of the rule are fairly described by the Court,
ante, at 609-611 of its opinion, and in the cases that it cites
on those pages. All of those cases were decided before 1992.
None of those cases--nor, indeed, any other of which I amaware--identified any exception to the rule of law that the

Court repeats today. In fact, the Court's opinion fails toidentify a colorable rationale for any such exception. Respondents' position on the merits consisted entirely of theirunpersuasive factual submission that the presence of representatives of the news media served various legitimate--
albeit nebulous--law enforcement purposes. The Court's
cogent rejection of those post hoc rationalizations cannot
be characterized as the announcement of a new rule of law.

During my service on the Court, I have heard lawyers
argue scores of cases raising Fourth Amendment issues.
Generally speaking, the Members of the Court have been
sensitive to the needs of the law enforcement community.
In virtually all of them at least one Justice thought that the
police conduct was reasonable. In fact, in only a handful did
the Court unanimously find a Fourth Amendment violation.
That the Court today speaks with a single voice on the merits of the constitutional question is unusual and certainly
lends support to the notion that the question is indeed "open
and shut." Ante, at 615.

But the more important basis for my opinion is that it
should have been perfectly obvious to the officers that their
"invitation to the media exceeded the scope of the search
authorized by the warrant." Ibid. Despite reaffirming
that clear rule, the Court nonetheless finds that the mere
presence of a warrant rendered the officers' conduct reasonable. The Court fails to cite a single case that even arguably
supports the proposition that using official power to enable
news photographers and reporters to enter a private home
for purposes unrelated to the execution of a warrant could

Opinion of Stevens, J.
be regarded as a "reasonable" invasion of either property
or privacy.

II

The absence of judicial opinions expressly holding that police violate the Fourth Amendment if they bring media representatives into private homes provides scant support for
the conclusion that in 1992 a competent officer could reasonably believe that it would be lawful to do so. Prior to our
decision in United States v. Lanier, 520 U. S. 259 (1997), no
judicial opinion specifically held that it was unconstitutional
for a state judge to use his official power to extort sexual
favors from a potential litigant. Yet, we unanimously concluded that the defendant had fair warning that he was violating his victim's constitutional rights. Id., at 271 ("The
easiest cases don't even arise" (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)).

Nor am I persuaded that the absence of rulings on the
precise Fourth Amendment issue presented in this case can
plausibly be explained by the assumption that the police
practice was common. I assume that the practice of allowing media personnel to "ride along" with police officers was
common, but that does not mean that the officers routinely
allowed the media to enter homes without the consent of the
owners. As the Florida Supreme Court noted in Florida
Publishing Co. v. Fletcher, 340 So. 2d 914, 918 (1976), there
has long been a widespread practice for firefighters to allow
photographers to enter disaster areas to take pictures, for
example, of the interior of buildings severely damaged by
fire. But its conclusion that such media personnel were not
trespassers rested on a doctrine of implied consent 2--a the2 The Florida Supreme Court held:

Opinion of Stevens, J.
ory wholly inapplicable to forcible entries in connection with
the execution of a warrant.3

In addition to this case, the Court points to three lower
court opinions--none of which addresses the Fourth Amendment--as the ostensible basis for a reasonable officer's belief
that the rule in Semayne's Case 4 was ripe for reevaluation.5
See ante, at 616. Two of the cases were decided in 1980 and
the third in 1984. In view of the clear restatement of the
rule in the later opinions of this Court, cited ante, at 611,
those three earlier decisions could not possibly provide a

ant to the doctrine of common custom, usage, and practice and since it had
been shown that it was common usage, custom and practice for news media
to enter private premises and homes under the circumstances present
here.. . . . .

" `The fire was a disaster of great public interest . . . . [I]t has been a
longstanding custom and practice throughout the country for representatives of the news media to enter upon private property where disaster of
great public interest has occurred.' " 340 So. 2d, at 917-918.

The Court's reference to this case, ante, at 616, n. 3, misleadingly suggests that the "widespread practice" referred to in the Florida court's
opinion was police practice; it was not.

3 Indeed, the Wisconsin state-court decision, cited by the Court as contrary authority, took pains to distinguish this case:
"We will not imply a consent as a matter of law. It is of course well
known that news representatives want to enter a private building after
or even during a newsworthy event within the building. That knowledge
is no basis for an implied consent by the possessor of the building to the
entry. . . . We conclude that custom and usage have not been shown in fact
or law to confer an implied consent upon news representatives to enter a
building under the circumstances presented by this case." Prahl v. Brosamle, 98 Wis. 2d 130, 149-150, 295 N. W. 2d 768, 780 (App. 1980).

4 5 Co. Rep. 91a, 77 Eng. Rep. 194 (K. B. 1604).

5 As the Court notes, the only Federal Court of Appeals authority on

the subject, Bills v. Aseltine, 958 F. 2d 697 (CA6 1992), "anticipate[d] today's holding that police may not bring along third parties during an entry
into a private home pursuant to a warrant for purposes unrelated to those
justifying the warrant." Ante, at 616-617.

basis for a claim by the police that they reasonably relied onjudicial recognition of an exception to the basic rule that the

purposes of the police intrusion strictly limit its scope.That the two federal decisions were not officially reported
makes such theoretical reliance especially anomalous.6Moreover, as the Court acknowledges, the claim rejected in
each of those cases was predicated on the media's allegedviolation of the plaintiffs' "unorthodox non-Fourth Amendment right to privacy theories," ante, at 616, rather than aclaim that the officers violated the Fourth Amendment by
allowing the press to observe the execution of the warrant.
Moncrief v. Hanton, 10 Media L. Rptr. 1620 (ND Ohio 1984);Higbee v. Times-Advocate, 5 Media L. Rptr. 2372 (SD Cal.

1980). As for the other case, Prahl v. Brosamle, 98 Wis. 2d130, 295 N. W. 2d 768 (App. 1980)--cited by the Court,

ante,at 616, for the proposition that the officer's conduct was "not

unreasonable"--it actually held that the defendants' motionto dismiss should have been denied because the allegations
supported the conclusion that the officer committed a tres-pass when he allowed a third party to enter the plaintiff 's
property.7 Since that conclusion was fully consistent with a

6 In the Fourth Circuit, unreported opinions may not be considered in
the course of determining qualified immunity. Hogan v. Carter, 85 F. 3d
1113, 1118 (1996).

7 Prahl v. Brosamle, 98 Wis. 2d, at 154-155, 295 N. W. 2d, at 782 ("A new

trial must be had with respect to the plaintiffs' claims for trespass against
Lieutenant Kuenning and Dane Country . . . . Lieutenant Kuenning had
no authority to extend a consent to [the press] to enter the land of another.
Although entry by Lieutenant Kuenning was privileged, he committed a
trespass by participating in the trespass by [the press]").

The Court is correct that the Wisconsin Court of Appeals upheld dismissal of the plaintiff's 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 claim against the newscaster because he was not acting under color of state law. As the basis for rejecting the $ 1983 action "for invasion of privacy based on disclosure of the
incident," the court further held that "[w]e are unwilling to accept the
proposition that the filming and television broadcast of a reasonable search
and seizure, without more, result in unreasonableness." 98 Wis. 2d, at

number of common-law cases holding that similar conductconstituted a trespass,

8 it surely does not provide any support for an officer's assumption that a similar trespass wouldbe lawful.

Far better evidence of an officer's reasonable understanding of the relevant law is provided by the testimony of theSheriff of Montgomery County, the commanding officer of

three of the respondents: " `We would never let a civilian intoa home. . . . That's just not allowed.' " Brief for Petitioners
41. III

The most disturbing aspect of the Court's ruling on thequalified immunity issue is its reliance on a document discussing "ride-alongs" apparently prepared by an employee inthe public relations office of the United States Marshals
Service. The text of the document, portions of which areset out in an appendix, makes it quite clear that its author
was not a lawyer, but rather a person concerned with devel-oping the proper public image of the Service, with a special
interest in creating a favorable impression with the Congress. Although the document occupies 14 pages in the joint

138, 295 N. W. 2d, at 774. Important to its conclusion was its observation
that, unlike the unnecessary male participation in body searches of schoolgirls in Doe v. Duter, 407 F. Supp. 922 (WD Wis. 1976), "[n]either the
search of Dr. Prahl and his premises nor the film or its broadcast has been
shown to include intimate, offensive or vulgar aspects." 98 Wis. 2d, at
138, 295 N. W. 2d, at 774. The reporter in question was stationed in the
entryway of the building and was able to film into the plaintiff's office
during the police interview.

8 See, e. g., Daingerfield v. Thompson, 74 Va. 136, 151 (1880) ("There

seems, indeed, to be no principle of law better settled, and for which numerous authorities may be cited if necessary, than this: that all persons
who wrongfully contribute in any manner to the commission of a trespass,
are responsible as principals, and each one is liable to the extent of the
injury done"); see also W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts $ 13, p. 72 (5th ed. 1984).

T-shirts and caps to "grease the skids," it contains no discussion of the conditions which must be satisfied before a newsperson may be authorized to enter private property during
the execution of a warrant. App. 12. There are guidelines
about how officers should act and speak in front of the camera, and the document does indicate that "the camera" should
not enter a private home until a "signal" is given. Id., at 7.
It does not, however, purport to give any guidance to the
marshals regarding when such a signal should be given,
whether it should ever be given without the consent of the
homeowner, or indeed on how to carry out any part of their
law enforcement mission. The notion that any member of
that well-trained cadre of professionals would rely on such a
document for guidance in the performance of dangerous law
enforcement assignments is too farfetched to merit serious
consideration.

* * *

The defense of qualified immunity exists to protect reasonable officers from personal liability for official actions later
found to be in violation of constitutional rights that were not
clearly established. The conduct in this case, as the Court
itself reminds us, contravened the Fourth Amendment's core
protection of the home. In shielding this conduct as if it
implicated only the unsettled margins of our jurisprudence,
the Court today authorizes one free violation of the wellestablished rule it reaffirms.

I respectfully dissent.

"MEDIA RIDE-ALONGS
"The U. S. Marshals Service, like all federal agencies, ultimately serves the needs and interests of the American public

when it accomplishes its designated duties. Keeping thepublic adequately informed of what the Service does can be

viewed as a duty in its own right, and we depend on thenews media to accomplish that.

"Media `ride-alongs' are one effective method to promote anaccurate picture of Deputy Marshals at work. Ride-alongs,
as the name implies, are simply opportunities for reportersand camera crews to go along with Deputies on operational
missions so they can see, and record, what actually happens.The result is usually a very graphic and dynamic look at the
operational activities of the Marshals Service, which is sub-sequently aired on TV or printed in a newspaper, magazine,
or book.
"However, successful ride-alongs don't just `happen' in aspontaneous fashion. They require careful planning and attention to detail to ensure that all goes smoothly and thatthe media receive an accurate picture of how the Marshals
Service operates. This booklet describes considerationsthat are important in nearly every ride-along." App. 4.

"Establish Ground Rules
"Another good idea--actually, it's an essential one--is to es-tablish ground rules at the start and convey them to the

reporter and camera person. Address such things as whatcan be covered with cameras and when, any privacy restrictions that may be encountered, and interview guidelines.
"Emphasize the need for safety considerations and explainany dangers that might be involved. Make the ground rules

realistic but balanced--remember, the media will want goodaction footage, not just a mop-up scene. If the arrest is
planned to take place inside a house or building, agree aheadof time on when the camera can enter and who will give the
signal." Id., at 7.
"The very best planning won't result in a good ride-along ifthe Marshals Service personnel involved do not do their part.

are important in getting the best media exposure possible."Id., at 9.

" `Waving the Flag'
"One action of special consequence is `waving the flag ' of theMarshals Service. This is accomplished when Deputies can

easily be recognized as USMS Deputies because they arewearing raid jackets, prominently displaying their badges,
or exhibiting other easily identifiable marks of the Service.We want the public to know who you are and what kind of
job you do. That is one of the goals of the ride-along. Sohaving Deputy Marshals easily identified as such on camera
is not just a whim--it's important to the overall success ofthe ride-along.
"Of course, how the Deputies act and what they say is alsocrucial. During the ride-along virtually any statement
made by Deputies just might end up as a quote, attributedto the person who made it. Sometimes that could prove embarrassing. A Deputy must try to visualize what his or herwords will look like in a newspaper or sound like on TV.
Being pleasant and professional at all times is key, and thatincludes not being drawn into statements of personal opinion
or inappropriate comments. Using common sense is therule."

Id., at 9-10.

"You also need to find out when the coverage will air or endup in print. Ask the reporter if he or she can keep you

informed on that matter. You might `grease the skids' forthis by offering the reporter, camera person, or other media
representatives involved a memento of the Marshals Service.Marshals Service caps, mugs, T-shirts, and the like can help
establish a rapport with a reporter that can benefit you inthe future." Id., at 12.

DAVIS, as next friend of LaSHONDA D. v. MONROECOUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eleventh circuit

No. 97-843. Argued January 12, 1999--Decided May 24, 1999
Petitioner filed suit against respondents, a county school board (Board)

and school officials, seeking damages for the sexual harassment of her
daughter LaShonda by G. F., a fifth-grade classmate at a public elementary school. Among other things, petitioner alleged that respondents'
deliberate indifference to G. F.'s persistent sexual advances toward
LaShonda created an intimidating, hostile, offensive, and abusive school
environment that violated Title IX of the Education Amendments of
1972, which, in relevant part, prohibits a student from being "excluded
from participation in, be[ing] denied the benefits of, or be[ing] subjected
to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving
Federal financial assistance," 20 U. S. C. $ 1681(a). In granting respondents' motion to dismiss, the Federal District Court found that "studenton-student," or peer, harassment provides no ground for a Title IX
private cause of action for damages. The en banc Eleventh Circuit
affirmed.

Held:

1. A private Title IX damages action may lie against a school board
in cases of student-on-student harassment, but only where the funding
recipient is deliberately indifferent to sexual harassment, of which the
recipient has actual knowledge, and that harassment is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it can be said to deprive the victims
of access to the educational opportunities or benefits provided by the
school. Pp. 638-653.

(a) An implied private right of action for money damages exists
under Title IX, Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools, 503 U. S.
60, where funding recipients had adequate notice that they could be
liable for the conduct at issue, Pennhurst State School and Hospital v.
Halderman, 451 U. S. 1, 17, but a recipient is liable only for its own
misconduct. Here, petitioner attempts to hold the Board liable for its
own decision to remain idle in the face of known student-on-student
harassment in its schools. The standard set out in Gebser v. Lago Vista
Independent School Dist., 524 U. S. 274--that a school district may be
liable for damages under Title IX where it is deliberately indifferent to
known acts of teacher-student sexual harassment--also applies in cases

526US3 Unit: $U60 [01-04-01 06:48:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN
630 DAVIS v. MONROE COUNTY BD. OF ED.

Syllabus
of student-on-student harassment. Initially, in Gebser, this Court expressly rejected the use of agency principles to impute liability to the
district for the acts of its teachers. Id., at 283. Additionally, Title IX's
regulatory scheme has long provided funding recipients with notice that
they may be liable for their failure to respond to nonagents' discriminatory acts. The common law has also put schools on notice that they
may be held responsible under state law for failing to protect students
from third parties' tortious acts. Of course, the harasser's identity is
not irrelevant. Deliberate indifference makes sense as a direct liability
theory only where the recipient has the authority to take remedial action, and Title IX's language itself narrowly circumscribes the circumstances giving rise to damages liability under the statute. If a recipient
does not engage in harassment directly, it may not be liable for damages
unless its deliberate indifference "subject[s]" its students to harassment,
i. e., at a minimum, causes students to undergo harassment or makes
them liable or vulnerable to it. Moreover, because the harassment
must occur "under" "the operations of" a recipient, 20 U. S. C. $$ 1681(a),
1687, the harassment must take place in a context subject to the school
district's control. These factors combine to limit a recipient's damages
liability to circumstances wherein the recipient exercises substantial
control over both the harasser and the context in which the known harassment occurs. Where, as here, the misconduct occurs during school
hours on school grounds, misconduct is taking place "under" an "operation" of the recipient. In these circumstances, the recipient retains substantial control over the context in which the harassment occurs. More
importantly, in this setting, the Board exercises significant control over
the harasser, for it has disciplinary authority over its students. At the
time of the events here, a publication for school attorneys and administrators indicated that student-on-student harassment could trigger Title
IX liability, and subsequent Department of Education policy guidelines
provide that such harassment falls within Title IX's scope. Contrary
to contentions of respondents and the dissent, school administrators will
continue to enjoy the flexibility they require in making disciplinary decisions so long as funding recipients are deemed "deliberately indifferent"
to acts of student-on-student harassment only where the recipient's response to the harassment or lack thereof is clearly unreasonable in light
of the known circumstances. Pp. 639-649.

(b) The requirement that recipients receive adequate notice of Title
IX's proscriptions also bears on the proper definition of "discrimination"
in a private damages action. Title IX proscribes sexual harassment
with sufficient clarity to satisfy Pennhurst's notice requirement and
serve as a basis for a damages action. See Gebser, supra, at 281. Having previously held that such harassment is "discrimination" in the

526US3 Unit: $U60 [01-04-01 06:48:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN

631Cite as: 526 U. S. 629 (1999)
Syllabus
school context under Title IX, this Court is constrained to conclude that
student-on-student sexual harassment, if sufficiently severe, can likewise rise to the level of "discrimination" actionable under the statute.
The statute's other prohibitions help to give content to "discrimination"
in this context. The statute not only protects students from discrimination but also shields them from being "excluded from participation in"
or "denied the benefits of" a recipient's "education program or activity"
on the basis of gender. 20 U. S. C. $ 1681(a). It is not necessary to
show an overt, physical deprivation of access to school resources to
make out a damages claim for sexual harassment under Title IX, but a
plaintiff must show harassment that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive, and that so undermines and detracts from the victims'
educational experience, that the victims are effectively denied equal access to an institution's resources and opportunities. Cf. Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U. S. 57, 67. Whether gender-oriented
conduct is harassment depends on a constellation of surrounding circumstances, expectations, and relationships, Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore
Services, Inc., 523 U. S. 75, 82, including, but not limited to, the harasser's and victim's ages and the number of persons involved. Courts
must also bear in mind that schoolchildren may regularly interact in
ways that would be unacceptable among adults. Moreover, that the
discrimination must occur "under any education program or activity"
suggests that the behavior must be serious enough to have the systemic
effect of denying the victim equal access to an education program or
activity. A single instance of severe one-on-one peer harassment could,
in theory, be said to have such a systemic effect, but it is unlikely that
Congress would have thought so. The fact that it was a teacher who
engaged in harassment in Franklin and Gebser is relevant. Peer harassment is less likely to satisfy the requirements that the misconduct
breach Title IX's guarantee of equal access to educational benefits and
have a systemic effect on a program or activity. Pp. 649-653.

2. Applying this standard to the facts at issue, the Eleventh Circuit
erred in dismissing petitioner's complaint. This Court cannot say beyond doubt that she can prove no set of facts that would entitle her to
relief. She alleges that LaShonda was the victim of repeated acts of
harassment by G. F. over a 5-month period, and allegations support the
conclusion that his misconduct was severe, pervasive, and objectively
offensive. Moreover, the complaint alleges that multiple victims of
G. F.'s misconduct sought an audience with the school principal and
that the harassment had a concrete, negative effect on LaShonda's ability to receive an education. The complaint also suggests that petitioner
may be able to show both actual knowledge and deliberate indifference

the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX), 86 Stat. 373,as amended, 20 U. S. C. $ 1681 et seq. The District Court

dismissed petitioner's Title IX claim on the ground that"student-on-student, " or peer, harassment provides no
ground for a private cause of action under the statute. TheCourt of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, sitting en banc,
affirmed. We consider here whether a private damages ac-tion may lie against the school board in cases of student-onstudent harassment. We conclude that it may, but onlywhere the funding recipient acts with deliberate indifference
to known acts of harassment in its programs or activities.Moreover, we conclude that such an action will lie only for
harassment that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively of-fensive that it effectively bars the victim's access to an educational opportunity or benefit.

I
Petitioner's Title IX claim was dismissed under FederalRule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim

upon which relief could be granted. Accordingly, in review-ing the legal sufficiency of petitioner's cause of action, "we
must assume the truth of the material facts as alleged in thecomplaint." Summit Health, Ltd. v. Pinhas, 500 U. S. 322,
325 (1991). A

Petitioner's minor daughter, LaShonda, was allegedly thevictim of a prolonged pattern of sexual harassment by one
of her fifth-grade classmates at Hubbard Elementary School,a public school in Monroe County, Georgia. According to
petitioner's complaint, the harassment began in December1992, when the classmate, G. F., attempted to touch LaShonda's breasts and genital area and made vulgar statementssuch as " `I want to get in bed with you' " and " `I want to
feel your boobs.' " Complaint || 7. Similar conduct alleg-edly occurred on or about January 4 and January 20, 1993.
Ibid. LaShonda reported each of these incidents to her

Opinion of the Court
mother and to her classroom teacher, Diane Fort. Ibid.Petitioner, in turn, also contacted Fort, who allegedly assured petitioner that the school principal, Bill Querry, hadbeen informed of the incidents.

Ibid. Petitioner contends
that, notwithstanding these reports, no disciplinary action
was taken against G. F. Id., || 16.G. F.'s conduct allegedly continued for many months. In

early February, G. F. purportedly placed a door stop in hispants and proceeded to act in a sexually suggestive manner
toward LaShonda during physical education class. Id., || 8.LaShonda reported G. F.'s behavior to her physical education
teacher, Whit Maples. Ibid. Approximately one week
later, G. F. again allegedly engaged in harassing behavior,
this time while under the supervision of another classroom
teacher, Joyce Pippin. Id., || 9. Again, LaShonda allegedly
reported the incident to the teacher, and again petitioner
contacted the teacher to follow up. Ibid.

Petitioner alleges that G. F. once more directed sexually
harassing conduct toward LaShonda in physical education
class in early March, and that LaShonda reported the incident to both Maples and Pippen. Id., || 10. In mid-April
1993, G. F. allegedly rubbed his body against LaShonda in
the school hallway in what LaShonda considered a sexually
suggestive manner, and LaShonda again reported the matter
to Fort. Id., || 11.

The string of incidents finally ended in mid-May, when
G. F. was charged with, and pleaded guilty to, sexual battery
for his misconduct. Id., || 14. The complaint alleges that
LaShonda had suffered during the months of harassment,
however; specifically, her previously high grades allegedly
dropped as she became unable to concentrate on her studies,
id., || 15, and, in April 1993, her father discovered that she
had written a suicide note, ibid. The complaint further
alleges that, at one point, LaShonda told petitioner that
she " `didn't know how much longer she could keep [G. F.]
off her.' " Id., || 12.

Opinion of the Court
Nor was LaShonda G. F.'s only victim; it is alleged thatother girls in the class fell prey to G. F.'s conduct. Id., || 16.

At one point, in fact, a group composed of LaShonda andother female students tried to speak with Principal Querry
about G. F.'s behavior. Id., || 10. According to the com-plaint, however, a teacher denied the students' request with
the statement, " `If [Querry] wants you, he'll call you.' "
Ibid.Petitioner alleges that no disciplinary action was taken in

response to G. F.'s behavior toward LaShonda. Id., || 16.In addition to her conversations with Fort and Pippen, petitioner alleges that she spoke with Principal Querry in mid-May 1993. When petitioner inquired as to what action the
school intended to take against G. F., Querry simply stated," `I guess I'll have to threaten him a little bit harder.' "

Id.,|| 12. Yet, petitioner alleges, at no point during the many

months of his reported misconduct was G. F. disciplined forharassment. Id., || 16. Indeed, Querry allegedly asked
petitioner why LaShonda " `was the only one complaining.' "
Id., || 12.Nor, according to the complaint, was any effort made to

separate G. F. and LaShonda. Id., || 16. On the contrary,notwithstanding LaShonda's frequent complaints, only after

On May 4, 1994, petitioner filed suit in the United StatesDistrict Court for the Middle District of Georgia against the
Board, Charles Dumas, the school district's superintendent,and Principal Querry. The complaint alleged that the Board

is a recipient of federal funding for purposes of Title IX,that "[t]he persistent sexual advances and harassment by the

student G. F. upon [LaShonda] interfered with her ability toattend school and perform her studies and activities," and
that "[t]he deliberate indifference by Defendants to the unwelcome sexual advances of a student upon LaShonda cre-ated an intimidating, hostile, offensive and abus[ive] school

environment in violation of Title IX." Id., |||| 27, 28. Thecomplaint sought compensatory and punitive damages, attorney's fees, and injunctive relief. Id., || 32.The defendants (all respondents here) moved to dismiss
petitioner's complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be
granted, and the District Court granted respondents' motion.
See 862 F. Supp. 363, 368 (MD Ga. 1994). With regard to
petitioner's claims under Title IX, the court dismissed the
claims against individual defendants on the ground that only
federally funded educational institutions are subject to liability in private causes of action under Title IX. Id., at 367.
As for the Board, the court concluded that Title IX provided
no basis for liability absent an allegation "that the Board or
an employee of the Board had any role in the harassment."
Ibid.

Petitioner appealed the District Court's decision dismissing her Title IX claim against the Board, and a panel of the
Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed. 74 F.
3d 1186, 1195 (1996). Borrowing from Title VII law, a majority of the panel determined that student-on-student harassment stated a cause of action against the Board under
Title IX: "[W]e conclude that as Title VII encompasses a
claim for damages due to a sexually hostile working environment created by co-workers and tolerated by the employer,
Title IX encompasses a claim for damages due to a sexually
hostile educational environment created by a fellow student
or students when the supervising authorities knowingly fail
to act to eliminate the harassment." Id., at 1193. The

Opinion of the Court
Eleventh Circuit panel recognized that petitioner sought tostate a claim based on school "officials' failure to take action

to stop the offensive acts of those over whom the officialsexercised control,"

ibid., and the court concluded that petitioner had alleged facts sufficient to support a claim for hostile environment sexual harassment on this theory, id., at1195.

The Eleventh Circuit granted the Board's motion for re-hearing en banc, 91 F. 3d 1418 (1996), and affirmed the District Court's decision to dismiss petitioner's Title IX claimagainst the Board, 120 F. 3d 1390 (1998). The en banc court
relied, primarily, on the theory that Title IX was passed pursuant to Congress' legislative authority under the Constitution's Spending Clause, U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 8, cl. 1, and that
the statute therefore must provide potential recipients of
federal education funding with "unambiguous notice of the
conditions they are assuming when they accept" it. 120
F. 3d, at 1399. Title IX, the court reasoned, provides recipients with notice that they must stop their employees from
engaging in discriminatory conduct, but the statute fails to
provide a recipient with sufficient notice of a duty to prevent
student-on-student harassment. Id., at 1401.

Writing in dissent, four judges urged that the statute, by
declining to identify the perpetrator of discrimination, encompasses misconduct by third parties: "The identity of the
perpetrator is simply irrelevant under the language" of the
statute. Id., at 1412 (Barkett, J., dissenting). The plain
language, the dissenters reasoned, also provides recipients
with sufficient notice that a failure to respond to student-onstudent harassment could trigger liability for the district.
Id., at 1414.

We granted certiorari, 524 U. S. 980 (1998), in order to resolve a conflict in the Circuits over whether, and under what
circumstances, a recipient of federal educational funds can be
liable in a private damages action arising from student-onstudent sexual harassment, compare 120 F. 3d 1390 (CA11

Opinion of the Court
the termination of funding, ibid., to give effect to the stat-ute's restrictions.

There is no dispute here that the Board is a recipient offederal education funding for Title IX purposes. 74 F. 3d,
at 1189. Nor do respondents support an argument thatstudent-on-student harassment cannot rise to the level of
"discrimination" for purposes of Title IX. Rather, at issuehere is the question whether a recipient of federal education
funding may be liable for damages under Title IX under anycircumstances for discrimination in the form of student-onstudent sexual harassment.

A
Petitioner urges that Title IX's plain language compels theconclusion that the statute is intended to bar recipients of

federal funding from permitting this form of discriminationin their programs or activities. She emphasizes that the
statute prohibits a student from being "subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receivingFederal financial assistance." 20 U. S. C. $ 1681(a) (emphasis added). It is Title IX's "unmistakable focus on the bene-fited class," Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U. S. 677,
691 (1979), rather than the perpetrator, that, in petitioner'sview, compels the conclusion that the statute works to protect
students from the discriminatory misconduct of their peers.Here, however, we are asked to do more than define the
scope of the behavior that Title IX proscribes. We mustdetermine whether a district's failure to respond to studenton-student harassment in its schools can support a privatesuit for money damages. See

Gebser v. Lago Vista Independent School Dist., 524 U. S. 274, 283 (1998) ("In this case,. . . petitioners seek not just to establish a Title IX violation

but to recover damages . . ."). This Court has indeed recog-nized an implied private right of action under Title IX, see
Cannon v. University of Chicago, supra, and we have heldthat money damages are available in such suits, Franklin v.

640 DAVIS v. MONROE COUNTY BD. OF ED.

Opinion of the Court
Gwinnett County Public Schools, 503 U. S. 60 (1992). Be-cause we have repeatedly treated Title IX as legislation

enacted pursuant to Congress' authority under the SpendingClause, however, see,

e. g., Gebser v. Lago Vista Independent
School Dist., supra, at 287 (Title IX); Franklin v. Gwinnett
County Public Schools, supra, at 74-75, and n. 8 (Title IX);see also

Guardians Assn. v. Civil Serv. Comm'n of New
York City, 463 U. S. 582, 598-599 (1983) (opinion of White, J.)(Title VI), private damages actions are available only where

recipients of federal funding had adequate notice that theycould be liable for the conduct at issue. When Congress acts
pursuant to its spending power, it generates legislation
"much in the nature of a contract: in return for federal funds,
the States agree to comply with federally imposed conditions." Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U. S. 1, 17 (1981). In interpreting language in
spending legislation, we thus "insis[t] that Congress speak
with a clear voice," recognizing that "[t]here can, of course,
be no knowing acceptance [of the terms of the putative contract] if a State is unaware of the conditions [imposed by the
legislation] or is unable to ascertain what is expected of it."
Ibid.; see also id., at 24-25.

Invoking Pennhurst, respondents urge that Title IX provides no notice that recipients of federal educational funds
could be liable in damages for harm arising from student-onstudent harassment. Respondents contend, specifically, that
the statute only proscribes misconduct by grant recipients,
not third parties. Respondents argue, moreover, that it
would be contrary to the very purpose of Spending Clause
legislation to impose liability on a funding recipient for the
misconduct of third parties, over whom recipients exercise
little control. See also Rowinsky v. Bryan Independent
School Dist., 80 F. 3d, at 1013.

We agree with respondents that a recipient of federal
funds may be liable in damages under Title IX only for its
own misconduct. The recipient itself must "exclud[e] [per526US3 Unit: $U60 [01-04-01 06:48:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
sons] from participation in, . . . den[y] [persons] the benefitsof, or . . . subjec[t] [persons] to discrimination under" its "program[s] or activit[ies]" in order to be liable under Title IX.The Government's enforcement power may only be exercised
against the funding recipient, see $ 1682, and we have not
extended damages liability under Title IX to parties outsidethe scope of this power. See

National Collegiate Athletic
Assn. v. Smith, 525 U. S. 459, 467, n. 5 (1999) (rejecting sug-gestion "that the private right of action available under . . .

$ 1681(a) is potentially broader than the Government's en-forcement authority"); cf.

Gebser v. Lago Vista Independent
School Dist., supra, at 289 ("It would be unsound, we think,
for a statute's express system of enforcement to require
notice to the recipient and an opportunity to come into voluntary compliance while a judicially implied system of enforcement permits substantial liability without regard to the recipient's knowledge or its corrective actions upon receiving
notice").

We disagree with respondents' assertion, however, that
petitioner seeks to hold the Board liable for G. F.'s actions
instead of its own. Here, petitioner attempts to hold the
Board liable for its own decision to remain idle in the face
of known student-on-student harassment in its schools. In
Gebser, we concluded that a recipient of federal education
funds may be liable in damages under Title IX where it is
deliberately indifferent to known acts of sexual harassment
by a teacher. In that case, a teacher had entered into a
sexual relationship with an eighth-grade student, and the
student sought damages under Title IX for the teacher's
misconduct. We recognized that the scope of liability in
private damages actions under Title IX is circumscribed
by Pennhurst's requirement that funding recipients have
notice of their potential liability. 524 U. S., at 287-288. Invoking Pennhurst, Guardians Assn., and Franklin, in
Gebser we once again required "that `the receiving entity of
federal funds [have] notice that it will be liable for a mone526US3 Unit: $U60 [01-04-01 06:48:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
tary award' " before subjecting it to damages liability. 524U. S., at 287 (quoting

Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public
Schools, 503 U. S., at 74). We also recognized, however, thatthis limitation on private damages actions is not a bar to

liability where a funding recipient intentionally violates the
statute. Id., at 74-75; see also Guardians Assn. v. Civil
Serv. Comm'n of New York City, supra, at 597-598 (opinion
of White, J.) (same with respect to Title VI). In particular,we concluded that

Pennhurst does not bar a private damages
action under Title IX where the funding recipient engagesin intentional conduct that violates the clear terms of the

statute.

Accordingly, we rejected the use of agency principles to
impute liability to the district for the misconduct of its teachers. 524 U. S., at 283. Likewise, we declined the invitation
to impose liability under what amounted to a negligence
standard--holding the district liable for its failure to react
to teacher-student harassment of which it knew or should
have known. Ibid. Rather, we concluded that the district
could be liable for damages only where the district itself intentionally acted in clear violation of Title IX by remaining
deliberately indifferent to acts of teacher-student harassment of which it had actual knowledge. Id., at 290. Contrary to the dissent's suggestion, the misconduct of the
teacher in Gebser was not "treated as the grant recipient's
actions." Post, at 661 (opinion of Kennedy, J.). Liability
arose, rather, from "an official decision by the recipient not
to remedy the violation." Gebser v. Lago Vista Independent
School Dist., supra, at 290. By employing the "deliberate
indifference" theory already used to establish municipal liability under Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, see Gebser
v. Lago Vista Independent School Dist., supra, at 290-291
(citing Board of Comm'rs of Bryan Cty. v. Brown, 520 U. S.
397 (1997), and Canton v. Harris, 489 U. S. 378 (1989)), we
concluded in Gebser that recipients could be liable in damages only where their own deliberate indifference effectively

526US3 Unit: $U60 [01-04-01 06:48:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN

643Cite as: 526 U. S. 629 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
"cause[d]" the discrimination, 524 U. S., at 291; see also Canton v. Harris, supra, at 385 (recognizing that a municipality
will be liable under $ 1983 only if "the municipality itselfcauses the constitutional violation at issue" (emphasis in

original)). The high standard imposed in Gebser sought to
eliminate any "risk that the recipient would be liable indamages not for its own official decision but instead for its

employees' independent actions." 524 U. S., at 290-291.

Gebser thus established that a recipient intentionally violates Title IX, and is subject to a private damages action,where the recipient is deliberately indifferent to known acts

of teacher-student discrimination. Indeed, whether viewed
as "discrimination" or "subject[ing]" students to discrimination, Title IX "[u]nquestionably . . . placed on [the Board]
the duty not" to permit teacher-student harassment in
its schools, Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools,
supra, at 75, and recipients violate Title IX's plain terms
when they remain deliberately indifferent to this form of
misconduct.

We consider here whether the misconduct identified in
Gebser--deliberate indifference to known acts of harassment--amounts to an intentional violation of Title IX, capable of supporting a private damages action, when the harasser is a student rather than a teacher. We conclude that,
in certain limited circumstances, it does. As an initial matter, in Gebser we expressly rejected the use of agency principles in the Title IX context, noting the textual differences
between Title IX and Title VII. 524 U. S., at 283; cf. Faragher v. Boca Raton, 524 U. S. 775, 791-792 (1998) (invoking
agency principles on ground that definition of "employer" in
Title VII includes agents of employer); Meritor Savings
Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U. S. 57, 72 (1986) (same). Additionally, the regulatory scheme surrounding Title IX has
long provided funding recipients with notice that they may
be liable for their failure to respond to the discriminatory
acts of certain nonagents. The Department of Education re526US3 Unit: $U60 [01-04-01 06:48:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN
644 DAVIS v. MONROE COUNTY BD. OF ED.

Opinion of the Court
quires recipients to monitor third parties for discriminationin specified circumstances and to refrain from particular

forms of interaction with outside entities that are known todiscriminate. See,

e. g., 34 CFR $$ 106.31(b)(6), 106.31(d),
106.37(a)(2), 106.38(a), 106.51(a)(3) (1998).

The common law, too, has put schools on notice that theymay be held responsible under state law for their failure to

protect students from the tortious acts of third parties. SeeRestatement (Second) of Torts $ 320, and Comment

a (1965).
In fact, state courts routinely uphold claims alleging thatschools have been negligent in failing to protect their students from the torts of their peers. See, e. g., Rupp v. Bryant, 417 So. 2d 658, 666-667 (Fla. 1982); Brahatcek v. Millard
School Dist., 202 Neb. 86, 99-100, 273 N. W. 2d 680, 688
(1979); McLeod v. Grant County School Dist. No. 128, 42
Wash. 2d 316, 320, 255 P. 2d 360, 362-363 (1953).

This is not to say that the identity of the harasser is irrelevant. On the contrary, both the "deliberate indifference"
standard and the language of Title IX narrowly circumscribe
the set of parties whose known acts of sexual harassment
can trigger some duty to respond on the part of funding recipients. Deliberate indifference makes sense as a theory of
direct liability under Title IX only where the funding recipient has some control over the alleged harassment. A recipient cannot be directly liable for its indifference where it lacks
the authority to take remedial action.

The language of Title IX itself--particularly when viewed
in conjunction with the requirement that the recipient have
notice of Title IX's prohibitions to be liable for damages--
also cabins the range of misconduct that the statute proscribes. The statute's plain language confines the scope of
prohibited conduct based on the recipient's degree of control
over the harasser and the environment in which the harassment occurs. If a funding recipient does not engage in harassment directly, it may not be liable for damages unless its
deliberate indifference "subject[s]" its students to harass526US3 Unit: $U60 [01-04-01 06:48:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN

645Cite as: 526 U. S. 629 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
ment. That is, the deliberate indifference must, at a mini-mum, "cause [students] to undergo" harassment or "make

them liable or vulnerable" to it. Random House Dictionaryof the English Language 1415 (1966) (defining "subject" as
"to cause to undergo the action of something specified; expose" or "to make liable or vulnerable; lay open; expose");Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2275 (1961)

(defining "subject" as "to cause to undergo or submit to:make submit to a particular action or effect: EXPOSE").
Moreover, because the harassment must occur "under" "theoperations of " a funding recipient, see 20 U. S. C. $ 1681(a);

$ 1687 (defining "program or activity"), the harassment must
take place in a context subject to the school district's control,
Webster's Third New International Dictionary, supra, at
2487 (defining "under" as "in or into a condition of subjection,
regulation, or subordination"; "subject to the guidance and
instruction of "); Random House Dictionary, supra, at 1543
(defining "under" as "subject to the authority, direction, or
supervision of ").

These factors combine to limit a recipient's damages liability to circumstances wherein the recipient exercises substantial control over both the harasser and the context in which
the known harassment occurs. Only then can the recipient
be said to "expose" its students to harassment or "cause"
them to undergo it "under" the recipient's programs. We
agree with the dissent that these conditions are satisfied
most easily and most obviously when the offender is an agent
of the recipient. Post, at 661. We rejected the use of
agency analysis in Gebser, however, and we disagree that
the term "under" somehow imports an agency requirement
into Title IX. See post, at 660-661. As noted above, the
theory in Gebser was that the recipient was directly liable
for its deliberate indifference to discrimination. See supra,
at 642-643. Liability in that case did not arise because the
"teacher's actions [were] treated" as those of the funding recipient, post, at 661; the district was directly liable for its

Opinion of the Court
own failure to act. The terms "subjec[t]" and "under" im-pose limits, but nothing about these terms requires the use

of agency principles.Where, as here, the misconduct occurs during school hours
and on school grounds--the bulk of G. F.'s misconduct, in
fact, took place in the classroom--the misconduct is takingplace "under" an "operation" of the funding recipient. See

Doe v. University of Illinois, 138 F. 3d, at 661 (finding liabil-ity where school fails to respond properly to "student-onstudent sexual harassment that takes place while the stu-dents are involved in school activities or otherwise under the
supervision of school employees"). In these circumstances,the recipient retains substantial control over the context in
which the harassment occurs. More importantly, however,
in this setting the Board exercises significant control overthe harasser. We have observed, for example, "that the nature of [the State's] power [over public schoolchildren] is cus-todial and tutelary, permitting a degree of supervision and
control that could not be exercised over free adults." Vernonia School Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U. S. 646, 655 (1995).
On more than one occasion, this Court has recognized theimportance of school officials' "comprehensive authority . . . ,

consistent with fundamental constitutional safeguards, to
prescribe and control conduct in the schools." Tinker v. Des
Moines Independent Community School Dist., 393 U. S. 503,
507 (1969); see also New Jersey v. T. L. O., 469 U. S. 325,
342, n. 9 (1985) ("The maintenance of discipline in the schools
requires not only that students be restrained from assaulting
one another, abusing drugs and alcohol, and committing
other crimes, but also that students conform themselves to
the standards of conduct prescribed by school authorities");
74 F. 3d, at 1193 ("The ability to control and influence behavior exists to an even greater extent in the classroom than in
the workplace . . ."). The common law, too, recognizes the
school's disciplinary authority. See Restatement (Second) of
Torts $ 152 (1965). We thus conclude that recipients of federal funding may be liable for "subject[ing]" their students

Opinion of the Court
to discrimination where the recipient is deliberately indifferent to known acts of student-on-student sexual harassment
and the harasser is under the school's disciplinary authority.

At the time of the events in question here, in fact, school
attorneys and administrators were being told that studenton-student harassment could trigger liability under Title IX.
In March 1993, even as the events alleged in petitioner's
complaint were unfolding, the National School Boards Association issued a publication, for use by "school attorneys and
administrators in understanding the law regarding sexual
harassment of employees and students," which observed that
districts could be liable under Title IX for their failure to
respond to student-on-student harassment. See National
School Boards Association Council of School Attorneys, Sexual Harassment in the Schools: Preventing and Defending
Against Claims v, 45 (rev. ed.). Drawing on Equal Employment Opportunity Commission guidelines interpreting Title
VII, the publication informed districts that, "if [a] school district has constructive notice of severe and repeated acts of
sexual harassment by fellow students, that may form the
basis of a [T]itle IX claim." Ibid. The publication even
correctly anticipated a form of Gebser's actual notice requirement: "It is unlikely that courts will hold a school district
liable for sexual harassment by students against students in
the absence of actual knowledge or notice to district employees." Sexual Harassment in the Schools, supra, at 45. Although we do not rely on this publication as an "indicium of
congressional notice," see post, at 671, we do find support
for our reading of Title IX in the fact that school attorneys
have rendered an analogous interpretation.

Likewise, although they were promulgated too late to contribute to the Board's notice of proscribed misconduct, the
Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) has
recently adopted policy guidelines providing that studenton-student harassment falls within the scope of Title IX's
proscriptions. See Department of Education, Office of Civil

Rights, Sexual Harassment Guidance: Harassment of Stu-dents by School Employees, Other Students, or Third Parties, 62 Fed. Reg. 12034, 12039-12040 (1997) (OCR Title IXGuidelines); see also Department of Education, Racial Incidents and Harassment Against Students at Educational
Institutions, 59 Fed. Reg. 11448, 11449 (1994).We stress that our conclusion here--that recipients may

be liable for their deliberate indifference to known acts ofpeer sexual harassment--does not mean that recipients can
avoid liability only by purging their schools of actionablepeer harassment or that administrators must engage in particular disciplinary action. We thus disagree with respondents' contention that, if Title IX provides a cause of action
for student-on-student harassment, "nothing short of expulsion of every student accused of misconduct involving sexual
overtones would protect school systems from liability or
damages." See Brief for Respondents 16; see also 120 F. 3d,
at 1402 (Tjoflat, J.) ("[A] school must immediately suspend or
expel a student accused of sexual harassment"). Likewise,
the dissent erroneously imagines that victims of peer harassment now have a Title IX right to make particular remedial
demands. See post, at 686 (contemplating that victim could
demand new desk assignment). In fact, as we have previously noted, courts should refrain from second-guessing
the disciplinary decisions made by school administrators.
New Jersey v. T. L. O., supra, at 342-343, n. 9.

School administrators will continue to enjoy the flexibility
they require so long as funding recipients are deemed "deliberately indifferent" to acts of student-on-student harassment
only where the recipient's response to the harassment or lack
thereof is clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances. The dissent consistently mischaracterizes this
standard to require funding recipients to "remedy" peer harassment, post, at 658, 662, 668, 683, and to "ensur[e] that . . .
students conform their conduct to" certain rules, post, at 666.
Title IX imposes no such requirements. On the contrary,

649Cite as: 526 U. S. 629 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
the recipient must merely respond to known peer harass-ment in a manner that is not clearly unreasonable. This is

not a mere "reasonableness" standard, as the dissent as-sumes. See post, at 679. In an appropriate case, there is
no reason why courts, on a motion to dismiss, for summaryjudgment, or for a directed verdict, could not identify a response as not "clearly unreasonable" as a matter of law.Like the dissent, see

post, at 664-668, we acknowledgethat school administrators shoulder substantial burdens as

a result of legal constraints on their disciplinary authority.To the extent that these restrictions arise from federal
statutes, Congress can review these burdens with attentionto the difficult position in which such legislation may place
our Nation's schools. We believe, however, that the stand-ard set out here is sufficiently flexible to account both for
the level of disciplinary authority available to the schooland for the potential liability arising from certain forms of
disciplinary action. A university might not, for example, beexpected to exercise the same degree of control over its
students that a grade school would enjoy, see post, at 666-668, and it would be entirely reasonable for a school to refrain from a form of disciplinary action that would expose itto constitutional or statutory claims.

While it remains to be seen whether petitioner can showthat the Board's response to reports of G. F.'s misconduct
was clearly unreasonable in light of the known circum-stances, petitioner may be able to show that the Board "subject[ed]" LaShonda to discrimination by failing to respond inany way over a period of five months to complaints of G. F.'s
in-school misconduct from LaShonda and other femalestudents.

The requirement that recipients receive adequate notice ofTitle IX's proscriptions also bears on the proper definition of

"discrimination" in the context of a private damages action.We have elsewhere concluded that sexual harassment is a

Opinion of the Court
form of discrimination for Title IX purposes and that TitleIX proscribes harassment with sufficient clarity to satisfy

Pennhurst's notice requirement and serve as a basis for adamages action. See

Gebser v. Lago Vista Independent
School Dist., 524 U. S., at 281; Franklin v. Gwinnett County
Public Schools, 503 U. S., at 74-75. Having previously de-termined that "sexual harassment" is "discrimination" in the

school context under Title IX, we are constrained to concludethat student-on-student sexual harassment, if sufficiently
severe, can likewise rise to the level of discrimination ac-tionable under the statute. See

Bennett v. Kentucky Dept.
of Ed., 470 U. S. 656, 665-666 (1985) (rejecting claim of insufficient notice under Pennhurst where statute made clear
that there were some conditions placed on receipt of federal
funds, and noting that Congress need not "specifically identif[y] and proscrib[e]" each condition in the legislation). The
statute's other prohibitions, moreover, help give content to
the term "discrimination" in this context. Students are not
only protected from discrimination, but also specifically
shielded from being "excluded from participation in" or "denied the benefits of " any "education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance." $ 1681(a). The statute makes clear that, whatever else it prohibits, students
must not be denied access to educational benefits and opportunities on the basis of gender. We thus conclude that funding recipients are properly held liable in damages only where
they are deliberately indifferent to sexual harassment, of
which they have actual knowledge, that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it can be said to deprive
the victims of access to the educational opportunities or benefits provided by the school.

The most obvious example of student-on-student sexual
harassment capable of triggering a damages claim would
thus involve the overt, physical deprivation of access to
school resources. Consider, for example, a case in which
male students physically threaten their female peers every

Opinion of the Court
day, successfully preventing the female students from usinga particular school resource--an athletic field or a computer

lab, for instance. District administrators are well aware ofthe daily ritual, yet they deliberately ignore requests for aid
from the female students wishing to use the resource. The
district's knowing refusal to take any action in response tosuch behavior would fly in the face of Title IX's core principles, and such deliberate indifference may appropriately besubject to claims for monetary damages. It is not necessary,
however, to show physical exclusion to demonstrate that stu-dents have been deprived by the actions of another student
or students of an educational opportunity on the basis of sex.
Rather, a plaintiff must establish sexual harassment of students that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive,
and that so undermines and detracts from the victims' educational experience, that the victim-students are effectively
denied equal access to an institution's resources and opportunities. Cf. Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477
U. S., at 67.

Whether gender-oriented conduct rises to the level of
actionable "harassment" thus "depends on a constellation of
surrounding circumstances, expectations, and relationships,"
Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., 523 U. S. 75,
82 (1998), including, but not limited to, the ages of the harasser and the victim and the number of individuals involved,
see OCR Title IX Guidelines 12041-12042. Courts, moreover, must bear in mind that schools are unlike the adult
workplace and that children may regularly interact in a manner that would be unacceptable among adults. See, e. g.,
Brief for National School Boards Association et al. as Amici
Curiae 11 (describing "dizzying array of immature . . . behaviors by students"). Indeed, at least early on, students are
still learning how to interact appropriately with their peers.
It is thus understandable that, in the school setting, students
often engage in insults, banter, teasing, shoving, pushing,
and gender-specific conduct that is upsetting to the students

Opinion of the Court
subjected to it. Damages are not available for simple actsof teasing and name-calling among school children, however,

even where these comments target differences in gender.Rather, in the context of student-on-student harassment,
damages are available only where the behavior is so severe,
pervasive, and objectively offensive that it denies its victimsthe equal access to education that Title IX is designed to

protect.The dissent fails to appreciate these very real limitations
on a funding recipient's liability under Title IX. It is notenough to show, as the dissent would read this opinion to
provide, that a student has been "teased," post, at 678, or
"called . . . offensive names," post, at 680. Comparisons to
an "overweight child who skips gym class because the other
children tease her about her size," the student who "refuses
to wear glasses to avoid the taunts of `four-eyes,' " and "the
child who refuses to go to school because the school bully
calls him a `scaredy-cat' at recess," post, at 678, are inapposite and misleading. Nor do we contemplate, much less hold,
that a mere "decline in grades is enough to survive" a motion
to dismiss. Post, at 677. The dropoff in LaShonda's grades
provides necessary evidence of a potential link between her
education and G. F.'s misconduct, but petitioner's ability to
state a cognizable claim here depends equally on the alleged
persistence and severity of G. F.'s actions, not to mention the
Board's alleged knowledge and deliberate indifference. We
trust that the dissent's characterization of our opinion will
not mislead courts to impose more sweeping liability than
we read Title IX to require.

Moreover, the provision that the discrimination occur
"under any education program or activity" suggests that the
behavior be serious enough to have the systemic effect of
denying the victim equal access to an educational program
or activity. Although, in theory, a single instance of sufficiently severe one-on-one peer harassment could be said to
have such an effect, we think it unlikely that Congress would

Opinion of the Court
have thought such behavior sufficient to rise to this level inlight of the inevitability of student misconduct and the

amount of litigation that would be invited by entertainingclaims of official indifference to a single instance of one-onone peer harassment. By limiting private damages actionsto cases having a systemic effect on educational programs or
activities, we reconcile the general principle that Title IXprohibits official indifference to known peer sexual harassment with the practical realities of responding to studentbehavior, realities that Congress could not have meant to be
ignored. Even the dissent suggests that Title IX liabilitymay arise when a funding recipient remains indifferent to
severe, gender-based mistreatment played out on a "wide-spread level" among students. Post, at 683.

The fact that it was a teacher who engaged in harassmentin Franklin and Gebser is relevant. The relationship between the harasser and the victim necessarily affects theextent to which the misconduct can be said to breach Title
IX's guarantee of equal access to educational benefits andto have a systemic effect on a program or activity. Peer
harassment, in particular, is less likely to satisfy these re-quirements than is teacher-student harassment.

C
Applying this standard to the facts at issue here, we con-clude that the Eleventh Circuit erred in dismissing petitioner's complaint. Petitioner alleges that her daughter was thevictim of repeated acts of sexual harassment by G. F. over a
5-month period, and there are allegations in support of theconclusion that G. F.'s misconduct was severe, pervasive, and
objectively offensive. The harassment was not only verbal;it included numerous acts of objectively offensive touching,
and, indeed, G. F. ultimately pleaded guilty to criminal sex-ual misconduct. Moreover, the complaint alleges that there
were multiple victims who were sufficiently disturbed byG. F.'s misconduct to seek an audience with the school prin526US3 Unit: $U60 [01-04-01 06:48:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Kennedy, J., dissenting
cipal. Further, petitioner contends that the harassment had
a concrete, negative effect on her daughter's ability to receive an education. The complaint also suggests that petitioner may be able to show both actual knowledge and deliberate indifference on the part of the Board, which made no
effort whatsoever either to investigate or to put an end to
the harassment.

On this complaint, we cannot say "beyond doubt that [petitioner] can prove no set of facts in support of [her] claim
which would entitle [her] to relief." Conley v. Gibson, 355
U. S. 41, 45-46 (1957). See also Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U. S.
232, 236 (1974) ("The issue is not whether a plaintiff will
ultimately prevail but whether the claimant is entitled to
offer evidence to support the claims"). Accordingly, the
judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the
Eleventh Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for
further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.
Justice Kennedy, with whom The Chief Justice, Justice Scalia, and Justice Thomas join, dissenting.

The Court has held that Congress' power " `to authorize
expenditure of public moneys for public purposes is not limited by the direct grants of legislative power found in the
Constitution.' " South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U. S. 203, 207
(1987) (quoting United States v. Butler, 297 U. S. 1, 66
(1936)). As a consequence, Congress can use its Spending
Clause power to pursue objectives outside of "Article I's
`enumerated legislative fields' " by attaching conditions to
the grant of federal funds. 483 U. S., at 207. So understood, the Spending Clause power, if wielded without concern for the federal balance, has the potential to obliterate
distinctions between national and local spheres of interest
and power by permitting the Federal Government to set pol526US3 Unit: $U60 [01-04-01 06:48:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Kennedy, J., dissenting
icy in the most sensitive areas of traditional state concern,areas which otherwise would lie outside its reach.

A vital safeguard for the federal balance is the require-ment that, when Congress imposes a condition on the States'
receipt of federal funds, it "must do so unambiguously."
Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451U. S. 1, 17 (1981). As the majority acknowledges, "legislation enacted pursuant to the spending power is much in thenature of a contract," and the legitimacy of Congress' exercise of its power to condition funding on state compliancewith congressional conditions "rests on whether the State
voluntarily and knowingly accepts the terms of the `contract.' " Ibid.; see ante, at 640. " `There can, of course, be
no knowing acceptance [of the terms of the putative contract]
if a State is unaware of the conditions [imposed by the legislation] or is unable to ascertain what is expected of it.' "
Ibid. (quoting Pennhurst, 451 U. S., at 17).

Our insistence that "Congress speak with a clear voice" to
"enable the States to exercise their choice knowingly, cognizant of the consequences of their participation," ibid., is not
based upon some abstract notion of contractual fairness.
Rather, it is a concrete safeguard in the federal system.
Only if States receive clear notice of the conditions attached
to federal funds can they guard against excessive federal
intrusion into state affairs and be vigilant in policing
the boundaries of federal power. Cf. Dole, supra, at 217
(O'Connor, J., dissenting) ("If the spending power is to be
limited only by Congress' notion of the general welfare, the
reality, given the vast financial resources of the Federal Government, is that the Spending Clause gives `power to the
Congress to tear down the barriers, to invade the states'
jurisdiction, and to become a parliament of the whole people,
subject to no restrictions save such as are self-imposed' "
(quoting Butler, supra, at 78)). While the majority purports
to give effect to these principles, it eviscerates the clearnotice safeguard of our Spending Clause jurisprudence.

Title IX provides:

"No person in the United States shall, on the basis of
sex, be [1] excluded from participation in, [2] be denied
the benefits of, or [3] be subjected to discrimination
under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance." 20 U. S. C. $ 1681(a).

To read the provision in full is to understand what is most
striking about its application in this case: Title IX does not
by its terms create any private cause of action whatsoever,
much less define the circumstances in which money damages
are available. The only private cause of action under Title
IX is judicially implied. See Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U. S. 677 (1979).

The Court has encountered great difficulty in establishing
standards for deciding when to imply a private cause of action under a federal statute which is silent on the subject.
We try to conform the judicial judgment to the bounds of
likely congressional purpose but, as we observed in Gebser
v. Lago Vista Independent School Dist., 524 U. S. 274 (1998),
defining the scope of the private cause of action in general,
and the damages remedy in particular, "inherently entails a
degree of speculation, since it addresses an issue on which
Congress has not specifically spoken." Id., at 284.

When the statute at issue is a Spending Clause statute,
this element of speculation is particularly troubling because
it is in significant tension with the requirement that Spending Clause legislation give States clear notice of the consequences of their acceptance of federal funds. Without
doubt, the scope of potential damages liability is one of the
most significant factors a school would consider in deciding
whether to receive federal funds. Accordingly, the Court
must not imply a private cause of action for damages unless
it can demonstrate that the congressional purpose to create
the implied cause of action is so manifest that the State,

Kennedy, J., dissenting
when accepting federal funds, had clear notice of the termsand conditions of its monetary liability.

Today the Court fails to heed, or even to acknowledge,these limitations on its authority. The remedial scheme the
majority creates today is neither sensible nor faithful to
Spending Clause principles. In order to make its case forschool liability for peer sexual harassment, the majority

must establish that Congress gave grant recipients clear andunambiguous notice that they would be liable in money damages for failure to remedy discriminatory acts of their stu-dents. The majority must also demonstrate that the statute
gives schools clear notice that one child's harassment of another constitutes "discrimination" on the basis of sex within
the meaning of Title IX, and that--as applied to individual
cases--the standard for liability will enable the grant recipient to distinguish inappropriate childish behavior from
actionable gender discrimination. The majority does not
carry these burdens.

Instead, the majority finds statutory clarity where there
is none and discovers indicia of congressional notice to the
States in the most unusual of places. It treats the issue as
one of routine statutory construction alone, and it errs even
in this regard. In the end, the majority not only imposes on
States liability that was unexpected and unknown, but the
contours of which are, as yet, unknowable. The majority's
opinion purports to be narrow, but the limiting principles it
proposes are illusory. The fence the Court has built is made
of little sticks, and it cannot contain the avalanche of liability
now set in motion. The potential costs to our schools of today's decision are difficult to estimate, but they are so great
that it is most unlikely Congress intended to inflict them.

The only certainty flowing from the majority's decision is
that scarce resources will be diverted from educating our
children and that many school districts, desperate to avoid
Title IX peer harassment suits, will adopt whatever federal
code of student conduct and discipline the Department of Ed526US3 Unit: $U60 [01-04-01 06:48:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ucation sees fit to impose upon them. The Nation's school-children will learn their first lessons about federalism in

classrooms where the Federal Government is the ever-present regulator. The Federal Government will have insinuated itself not only into one of the most traditional areasof state concern but also into one of the most sensitive areas
of human affairs. This federal control of the discipline ofour Nation's schoolchildren is contrary to our traditions and
inconsistent with the sensible administration of our schools.Because Title IX did not give States unambiguous notice
that accepting federal funds meant ceding to the FederalGovernment power over the day-to-day disciplinary decisions of schools, I dissent. I

I turn to the first difficulty with the majority's decision.Schools cannot be held liable for peer sexual harassment because Title IX does not give them clear and unambiguousnotice that they are liable in damages for failure to remedy
discrimination by their students. As the majority acknowl-edges, Title IX prohibits only misconduct by grant recipients, not misconduct by third parties. Ante, at 640-641("The recipient itself must `exclud[e] [persons] from participation in, . . . den[y] [persons] the benefits of, or . . . subjec[t][persons] to discrimination under' its `program[s] or activit[ies]' in order to be liable under Title IX"). The majorityargues, nevertheless, that a school "subjects" its students to
discrimination when it knows of peer harassment and fails torespond appropriately.

The mere word "subjected" cannot bear the weight of themajority's argument. As we recognized in

Gebser, the pri-mary purpose of Title IX is "to prevent recipients of federal

financial assistance from using the funds in a discriminatorymanner." 524 U. S., at 292. We stressed in

Gebser thatTitle IX prevents discrimination by the grant recipient,

whether through the acts of its principals or the acts of itsagents. See id., at 286 (explaining that Title IX and Title VI

Kennedy, J., dissenting
"operate in the same manner, conditioning an offer of federalfunding on a promise by the recipient not to discriminate, in

what amounts essentially to a contract between the Govern-ment and the recipient of funds"). "[W]hereas Title VII
aims centrally to compensate victims of discrimination, TitleIX focuses more on `protecting' individuals from discriminatory practices carried out by recipients of federal funds."
Id., at 287. The majority does not even attempt to arguethat the school's failure to respond to discriminatory acts by

students is discrimination by the school itself.

A
In any event, a plaintiff cannot establish a Title IX viola-tion merely by showing that she has been "subjected to discrimination." Rather, a violation of Title IX occurs only ifshe is "subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity," 20 U. S. C. $ 1681(a), where "program oractivity" is defined as "all of the operations of " a grant recipient, $ 1687.Under the most natural reading of this provision, discrimination violates Title IX only if it is authorized by, or in ac-cordance with, the actions, activities, or policies of the grant
recipient. See Webster's Third New International Diction-ary 2487 (1981) (defining "under" as "required by: in accordance with: bound by"); American Heritage Dictionary 1395(New College ed. 1981) (defining "under" as "[w]ith the authorization of; attested by; by virtue of "); Random HouseDictionary of the English Language 2059 (2d ed. 1987) (defining "under" as "authorized, warranted, or attested by" or"in accordance with"); see also 43 Words and Phrases 149-
152 (1969) (citing cases defining "under" as, inter alia, " `inaccordance with' and `in conformity with' "; "indicating subjection, guidance or control, and meaning `by authority of ' ";" `by,' `by reason of,' or `by means of ' "; and " `by virtue of,'
which is defined . . . as meaning `by or through the authorityof ' "). This reading reflects the common legal usage of the

Kennedy, J., dissenting
term "under" to mean pursuant to, in accordance with, or asauthorized or provided by. See,

e. g., Gregory v. Ashcroft,
501 U. S. 452, 469 (1991) ("Because Congress nowhere statedits intent to impose mandatory obligations on the States

under its $ 5 powers, we concluded that Congress did not do
so"); ante, at 632 ("Among petitioner's claims was a claim formonetary and injunctive relief under Title IX . . .").

It is not enough, then, that the alleged discriminationoccur in a "context subject to the school district's control."
Ante, at 645. The discrimination must actually be "con-trolled by"--that is, be authorized by, pursuant to, or in
accordance with, school policy or actions. Compare ante,
at 645 (defining "under" as "in or into a condition of subjection, regulation, or subordination" (emphasis added)), with
ibid. (defining "under" as "subject to the guidance and instruction of " (emphasis added)).

This reading is also consistent with the fact that the discrimination must be "under" the "operations" of the grant
recipient. The term "operations" connotes active and affirmative participation by the grant recipient, not merely inaction or failure to respond. See Black's Law Dictionary
1092 (6th ed. 1990) (defining "operation" as an "[e]xertion of
power; the process of operating or mode of action; an effect
brought about in accordance with a definite plan; action;
activity").

Teacher sexual harassment of students is "under" the
school's program or activity in certain circumstances, but
student harassment is not. Our decision in Gebser recognizes that a grant recipient acts through its agents and thus,
under certain limited circumstances, even tortious acts by
teachers may be attributable to the school. We noted in
Gebser that, in contrast to Title VII, which defines "employer" to include "any agent"--Title IX "contains no comparable reference to an educational institution's `agents,' and
so does not expressly call for application of agency principles." 524 U. S., at 283. As a result, we declined to incor526US3 Unit: $U60 [01-04-01 06:48:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN

661Cite as: 526 U. S. 629 (1999)
Kennedy, J., dissenting
porate principles of agency liability, such as a strict appli-cation of vicarious liability, that would conflict with the

Spending Clause's notice requirement and Title IX's expressadministrative enforcement scheme.

Contrary to the majority's assertion, ante, at 643, however,
we did not abandon agency principles altogether. Rather,we sought in

Gebser to identify those employee actions which
could fairly be attributed to the grant recipient by superim-posing additional Spending Clause notice requirements on

traditional agency principles. 524 U. S., at 288 ("Title IXcontains important clues that Congress did not intend to
allow recovery in damages where liability rests solely on
principles of vicarious liability or constructive notice"). We
concluded that, because of the Spending Clause overlay, a
teacher's discrimination is attributable to the school only
when the school has actual notice of that harassment and is
"deliberately indifferent." The agency relation between the
school and the teacher is thus a necessary, but not sufficient,
condition of school liability. Where the heightened requirements for attribution are met, the teacher's actions are
treated as the grant recipient's actions. In those circumstances, then, the teacher sexual harassment is "under" the
operations of the school.

I am aware of no basis in law or fact, however, for attributing the acts of a student to a school and, indeed, the majority
does not argue that the school acts through its students.
See ante, at 641 ("We disagree with respondents' assertion . . . that petitioner seeks to hold the Board liable for
G. F.'s actions instead of its own. Here, petitioner attempts
to hold the Board liable for its own decision to remain idle
in the face of known student-on-student harassment in its
schools"). Discrimination by one student against another
therefore cannot be "under" the school's program or activity as required by Title IX. The majority's imposition of
liability for peer sexual harassment thus conflicts with the
most natural interpretation of Title IX's "under a program

or activity" limitation on school liability. At the very least,
my reading undermines the majority's implicit claim that
Title IX imposes an unambiguous duty on schools to remedy
peer sexual harassment.

B

1

Quite aside from its disregard for the "under the program"
limitation of Title IX, the majority's reading is flawed in
other respects. The majority contends that a school's deliberate indifference to known student harassment "subjects"
students to harassment--that is, "cause[s] [students] to undergo" harassment. Ante, at 645. The majority recognizes, however, that there must be some limitation on the
third-party conduct that the school can fairly be said to
cause. In search of a principle, the majority asserts, without much elaboration, that one causes discrimination when
one has some "degree of control" over the discrimination and
fails to remedy it. Ante, at 644.

To state the majority's test is to understand that it is little
more than an exercise in arbitrary line-drawing. The majority does not explain how we are to determine what degree
of control is sufficient--or, more to the point, how the States
were on clear notice that the Court would draw the line to
encompass students.

Agency principles usually mark the outer limits of an entity's liability for the actions of an individual over whom it
exercises some control. Cf. Faragher v. Boca Raton, 524
U. S. 775 (1998) (applying agency principles to delimit Title
VII employer liability); Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U. S. 742 (1998) (same). The Court, for example,
has not recognized liability for the actions of nonagents
under Title VII, which contains an express private right of
action and is not Spending Clause legislation. The majority
nonetheless rejects out-of-hand an agency limitation on Title
IX liability based on its cramped reading of Gebser. As

Kennedy, J., dissenting
noted above, the Gebser Court rejected the wholesale impor-tation of federal common-law agency principles into Title IX

to expand liability beyond that which the statute clearly pro-hibited; it did not, as the majority would have it, reject the
proposition that school liability is limited by agency principles. Indeed, to suppose that Congress would have rejectedwell-established principles of agency law in favor of the majority's vague control principle turns Gebser on its head.
Gebser contemplated that Title IX liability would be less
expansive than Title VII liability, not more so. See Gebser,
supra, at 286-287.

One would think that the majority would at least limit its
control principle by reference to the long-established practice of the Department of Education (DOE). For the first 25
years after the passage of Title IX--until 1997--the DOE's
regulations drew the liability line, at its most expansive, to
encompass only those to whom the school delegated its official functions. See 34 CFR $ 106.51(a)(3) (1998) ("A [grant]
recipient shall not enter into any contractual or other relationship which directly or indirectly has the effect of subjecting employees or students to discrimination prohibited by
this subpart, including relationships with employment and
referral agencies, with labor unions, and with organizations
providing or administering fringe benefits to employees of
the recipient"). It is perhaps reasonable to suppose that
grant recipients were on notice that they could not hire third
parties to do for them what they could not do themselves.
For example, it might be reasonable to find that a school
was on notice that it could not circumvent Title IX's core
prohibitions by, for example, delegating its admissions decisions to an outside screening committee it knew would discriminate on the basis of gender.

Given the state of gender discrimination law at the time
Title IX was passed, however, there is no basis to think that
Congress contemplated liability for a school's failure to remedy discriminatory acts by students or that the States would

believe the statute imposed on them a clear obligation todo so. When Title IX was enacted in 1972, the concept of

"sexual harassment" as gender discrimination had not beenrecognized or considered by the courts. See generally C.
MacKinnon, Sexual Harassment of Working Women: A Caseof Sex Discrimination 59-72 (1979). The types of discrimination that were recognized--discriminatory admissionsstandards, denial of access to programs or resources, hiring,
etc.--could not be engaged in by students. See, e. g., 20U. S. C. $ 1681(a)(2) (referencing application of Title IX prohibitions to school admissions).

The majority nonetheless appears to see no need to justifydrawing the "enough control" line to encompass students.

In truth, however, a school's control over its students is muchmore complicated and limited than the majority acknowledges. A public school does not control its students in theway it controls its teachers or those with whom it contracts.
Most public schools do not screen or select students, andtheir power to discipline students is far from unfettered.

Public schools are generally obligated by law to educateall students who live within defined geographic boundaries.
Indeed, the Constitution of almost every State in the countryguarantees the State's students a free primary and secondary public education. See, e. g., Cal. Const., Art. IX, $ 5;Colo. Const., Art. IX, $ 2; Ga. Const., Art. VIII, $ 1, || 1; Ind.
Const., Art. VIII, $ 1; Md. Const., Art. VIII, $ 1; Mo. Const.,Art. IX, $ 1(a); Neb. Const., Art. VII, $ 1; N. J. Const., Art.

Wyo. Const., Art. VII, $$ 1 and 9. In at least some States,moreover, there is a continuing duty on schools to educate
even students who are suspended or expelled. See, e. g.,

Phillip Leon M. v. Board of Education, 199 W. Va. 400, 484S. E. 2d 909 (1996) (holding that the education clause of the

West Virginia Constitution confers on students a fundamen-tal right to an education and requires that a county school
board provide alternative educational programs, such as an
alternative school, to students who are expelled or sus-pended for an extended period for bringing guns to school).

Schools that remove a harasser from the classroom and thenattempt to fulfill their continuing-education obligation by
placing the harasser in any kind of group setting, rather thanby hiring expensive tutors for each student, will find themselves at continuing risk of Title IX suits brought by the
other students in the alternative education program.

In addition, federal law imposes constraints on school disciplinary actions. This Court has held, for example, that
due process requires, "[a]t the very minimum," that a student facing suspension "be given some kind of notice and
afforded some kind of hearing." Goss v. Lopez, 419 U. S.
565, 579 (1975).

The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA),
20 U. S. C. $ 1400 et seq. (1994 ed., Supp. III), moreover,
places strict limits on the ability of schools to take disciplinary actions against students with behavior disorder disabilities, even if the disability was not diagnosed prior to the
incident triggering discipline. See, e. g., $ 1415(f)(1) (parents
entitled to hearing when school proposes to change disabled
student's educational placement); $ 1415(k)(1)(A) (school authorities can only "order a change in the placement of a child
with a disability . . . to an appropriate interim alternative
educational setting, another setting, or suspension" for up to
"10 school days" unless student's offense involved a weapon
or illegal drugs); $ 1415(k)(8) ("[A] child who has not been
determined to be eligible for special education . . . and who
has engaged in behavior that violated any [school rule] may
assert any of the protections" of the subchapter if the school
"had knowledge . . . that the child was a child with a disabil526US3 Unit: $U60 [01-04-01 06:48:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ity before the behavior that precipitated the disciplinary ac-tion occurred"); $ 1415(k)(8)(B)(ii) (school "deemed to have

knowledge that a child is a child with a disability if . . . thebehavior or performance of the child demonstrates the need
for such [special education and related] services"). "Disability," as defined in the IDEA, includes "serious emotional dis-turbance," $ 1401(3)(A)(i), which the DOE, in turn, has defined as a "condition exhibiting . . . over a long period oftime and to a marked degree that adversely affects a child's
educational performance," an "inability to build or maintainsatisfactory interpersonal relationships with peers and
teachers," or "[i]nappropriate types of behavior or feelings
under normal circumstances." 34 CFR $ 300.7(b)(9) (1998).
If, as the majority would have us believe, the behavior that
constitutes actionable peer sexual harassment so deviates
from the normal teasing and jostling of adolescence that it
puts schools on clear notice of potential liability, then a student who engages in such harassment may have at least a
colorable claim of severe emotional disturbance within the
meaning of the IDEA. When imposing disciplinary sanction
on a student harasser who might assert a colorable IDEA
claim, the school must navigate a complex web of statutory
provisions and DOE regulations that significantly limit its
discretion.

The practical obstacles schools encounter in ensuring that
thousands of immature students conform their conduct to acceptable norms may be even more significant than the legal
obstacles. School districts cannot exercise the same measure of control over thousands of students that they do over
a few hundred adult employees. The limited resources of
our schools must be conserved for basic educational services.
Some schools lack the resources even to deal with serious
problems of violence and are already overwhelmed with disciplinary problems of all kinds.

about school control over primary and secondary school stu526US3 Unit: $U60 [01-04-01 06:48:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN

dents is the majority's failure to grapple in any meaningful
way with the distinction between elementary and secondary
schools, on the one hand, and universities on the other. The
majority bolsters its argument that schools can control their
students' actions by quoting our decision in Vernonia School
Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U. S. 646, 655 (1995), for the proposition that " `the nature of [the State's] power [over public
school children] is custodial and tutelary, permitting a degree
of supervision and control that could not be exercised over
free adults.' " Ante, at 646. Yet the majority's holding
would appear to apply with equal force to universities, which
do not exercise custodial and tutelary power over their
adult students.

A university's power to discipline its students for speech
that may constitute sexual harassment is also circumscribed
by the First Amendment. A number of federal courts have
already confronted difficult problems raised by university
speech codes designed to deal with peer sexual and racial
harassment. See, e. g., Dambrot v. Central Mich. Univ., 55
F. 3d 1177 (CA6 1995) (striking down university discriminatory harassment policy because it was overbroad, vague, and
not a valid prohibition on fighting words); UWM Post, Inc.
v. Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis. System, 774 F. Supp.
1163 (ED Wis. 1991) (striking down university speech code
that prohibited, inter alia, " `discriminatory comments' " directed at an individual that " `intentionally . . . demean' " the
" `sex . . . of the individual' " and " `[c]reate an intimidating,
hostile or demeaning environment for education, university
related work, or other university-authorized activity' "); Doe

The difficulties associated with speech codes simply under-score the limited nature of a university's control over student

behavior that may be viewed as sexual harassment. De-spite the fact that the majority relies on the assumption that
schools exercise a great deal of control over their studentsto justify creating the private cause of action in the first
instance, it does not recognize the obvious limits on a univer-sity's ability to control its students as a reason to doubt the
propriety of a private cause of action for peer harassment.It simply uses them as a factor in determining whether the
university's response was reasonable. See ante, at 649.

The majority's presentation of its control test illustratesits own discomfort with the rule it has devised. Rather than

beginning with the language of Title IX itself, the majoritybegins with our decision in

Gebser and appears to discoverthere a sweeping legal duty--divorced from agency principles--for schools to remedy third-party discriminationagainst students. The majority then finds that the DOE's
Title IX regulations and state common law gave States therequisite notice that they would be liable in damages for failure to fulfill this duty. Only then does the majority turn tothe language of Title IX itself--not, it appears, to find a duty
or clear notice to the States, for that the majority assumeshas already been established, but rather to suggest a limit
on the breathtaking scope of the liability the majority thinksis so clear under the statute. See

ante, at 645 ("These fac-tors [("subjects" and "under")] combine to limit a recipient's

damages liability to circumstances wherein the recipientexercises substantial control over both the harasser and the
context in which the known harassment occurs").Our decision in

Gebser did not, of course, recognize someill-defined, freestanding legal duty on schools to remedy discrimination by third parties. In particular, Gebser gaveschools no notice whatsoever that they might be liable on the

Kennedy, J., dissenting
majority's novel theory that a school "subjects" a student tothird-party discrimination if it exercises some measure of

control over the third party. We quoted the "subjected todiscrimination" language only once in

Gebser, when we
quoted the text of Title IX in full, and we did not use the
word "control." Instead, we affirmed that Title IX prohibitsdiscrimination by the grant recipient. See

Gebser, 524 U. S.,
at 286; id., at 291-292; supra, at 658-659.Neither the DOE's Title IX regulations nor state tort law,

moreover, could or did provide States the notice required byour Spending Clause principles. The majority contends that
the DOE's Title IX regulations have "long provided funding
recipients with notice that they may be liable for their failure
to respond to the discriminatory acts of certain nonagents."
Ante, at 643. Even assuming that DOE regulations could
give schools the requisite notice, they did not do so. Not
one of the regulations the majority cites suggests that
schools may be held liable in money damages for failure to
respond to third-party discrimination.

In addition, as discussed above, the DOE regulations provide no support for the proposition that schools were on
notice that students were among those "nonagents" whose
actions the schools were bound to remedy. Most of the regulations cited by the majority merely forbid grant recipients
to give affirmative aid to third parties who discriminate.
See 34 CFR $ 106.31(b)(6) (1998) (A grant "recipient shall
not, on the basis of sex," "[a]id or perpetuate discrimination
against any person by providing significant assistance to any
agency, organization, or person which discriminates on the
basis of sex in providing any aid, benefit or service to students or employees"); see also $ 106.37(a)(2) (A grant recipient shall not, "[t]hrough solicitation, listing, approval, provision of facilities or other services, assist any foundation,
trust, agency, organization, or person which provides assistance to any of such recipient's students in a manner which
discriminates on the basis of sex"); $ 106.38(a) (A grant recip526US3 Unit: $U60 [01-04-01 06:48:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ient "which assists any agency, organization or person inmaking employment available to any of its students [s]hall

assure itself that such employment is made available withoutdiscrimination on the basis of sex [and] [s]hall not render
such services to any agency, organization, or person which
discriminates on the basis of sex in its employment prac-tices"). The others forbid grant recipients to delegate the

provision of student (or employee) benefits and services tothird parties who engage in gender discrimination in administering what is, in effect, the school's program. See$ 106.51(a)(3) ("A [grant] recipient shall not enter into any
contractual or other relationship which directly or indirectly
has the effect of subjecting employees or students to discrimination prohibited by this subpart, including relationships
with employment and referral agencies, with labor unions,
and with organizations providing or administering fringe
benefits to employees of the recipient"); see also $ 106.31(d)
(A grant recipient "which requires participation by any applicant, student, or employee in any education program or
activity not operated wholly by such recipient, or which facilitates, permits, or considers such participation as part of or
equivalent to an education program or activity operated by
such recipient, including participation in educational consortia and cooperative employment and student-teaching assignments" must take steps to assure itself that the education program or activity is not discriminating on the basis of
gender and "shall not facilitate, require, permit, or consider
such participation" if the program is discriminating). None
of the regulations suggests a generalized duty to remedy discrimination by third parties over whom the school may arguably exercise some control.

Requiring a school to take affirmative steps to remedy harassment by its students imposes a much heavier burden on
schools than prohibiting affirmative aid or effective delegation of school functions to an entity that discriminates. Notice of these latter responsibilities, then, can hardly be said

Kennedy, J., dissenting
to encompass clear notice of the former. In addition, eachof the DOE regulations is predicated on a grant recipient's

choice to give affirmative aid to, or to enter into voluntaryassociation with, a discriminating entity. The recipient,
moreover, as the regulations envision, is free to terminate
that aid or association (or could have so provided throughcontract). The relationships regulated by the DOE are thus

quite different from school-student relationships. The dif-ferences confirm that the regulations did not provide adequate notice of a duty to remedy student discrimination.The majority also concludes that state tort law provided
States the requisite notice. It is a non sequitur to suppose,
however, that a State knows it is liable under a federal statute simply because the underlying conduct might form the
basis for a state tort action. In any event, it is far from
clear that Georgia law gave the Monroe County Board of
Education notice that it would be liable even under state law
for failure to respond reasonably to known student harassment. See, e. g., Holbrook v. Executive Conference Center,
Inc., 219 Ga. App. 104, 106, 464 S. E. 2d 398, 401 (1996) (holding that school districts are entitled to sovereign immunity
for claims based on their supervision of students unless the
school displayed "wilfulness, malice, or corruption").

The majority's final observation about notice confirms just
how far it has strayed from the basic Spending Clause principle that Congress must, through the clear terms of the statute, give States notice as to what the statute requires. The
majority contends that schools were on notice because they
"were being told" by a 1993 National School Boards Association publication that peer sexual harassment might trigger
Title IX liability. Ante, at 647. By treating a publication
designed to help school lawyers prevent and guard against
school liability as a reliable indicium of congressional notice,
the majority has transformed a litigation manual--which,
like all such manuals, errs on the side of caution in describing
potential liability--into a self-fulfilling prophecy. It seems

Kennedy, J., dissenting
schools cannot even discuss potential liabilities amongst
themselves without somehow stipulating that Congress had
some specified intent.

II

Our decision in Gebser makes clear that the Spending
Clause clear-notice rule requires both that the recipients be
on general notice of the kind of conduct the statute prohibits,
and--at least when money damages are sought--that they
be on notice that illegal conduct is occurring in a given situation. See, e. g., Gebser, 524 U. S., at 287-288 (rejecting
vicarious liability because it would hold schools liable even
when they did not know that prohibited discrimination was
occurring).

Title IX, however, gives schools neither notice that the
conduct the majority labels peer "sexual harassment" is gender discrimination within the meaning of the Act nor any
guidance in distinguishing in individual cases between actionable discrimination and the immature behavior of children and adolescents. The majority thus imposes on schools
potentially crushing financial liability for student conduct
that is not prohibited in clear terms by Title IX and that
cannot, even after today's opinion, be identified by either
schools or courts with any precision.

The law recognizes that children--particularly young children--are not fully accountable for their actions because
they lack the capacity to exercise mature judgment. See,
e. g., 1 E. Farnsworth, Contracts $ 4.4 (2d ed. 1998) (discussing minor's ability to disaffirm a contract into which he has
entered). It should surprise no one, then, that the schools
that are the primary locus of most children's social development are rife with inappropriate behavior by children who
are just learning to interact with their peers. The amici on
the front lines of our schools describe the situation best:

"Unlike adults in the workplace, juveniles have limited
life experiences or familial influences upon which to es526US3 Unit: $U60 [01-04-01 06:48:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN

673Cite as: 526 U. S. 629 (1999)
Kennedy, J., dissenting
tablish an understanding of appropriate behavior. The
real world of school discipline is a rough-and-tumble
place where students practice newly learned vulgarities,
erupt with anger, tease and embarrass each other, share
offensive notes, flirt, push and shove in the halls, grab
and offend." Brief for National School Boards Association et al. as Amici Curiae 10-11 (hereinafter Brief for
School Amici).

No one contests that much of this "dizzying array of immature or uncontrollable behaviors by students," ibid., is inappropriate, even "objectively offensive" at times, ante, at 650,
and that parents and schools have a moral and ethical responsibility to help students learn to interact with their
peers in an appropriate manner. It is doubtless the case,
moreover, that much of this inappropriate behavior is directed toward members of the opposite sex, as children in
the throes of adolescence struggle to express their emerging
sexual identities.

It is a far different question, however, whether it is either
proper or useful to label this immature, childish behavior
gender discrimination. Nothing in Title IX suggests that
Congress even contemplated this question, much less answered it in the affirmative in unambiguous terms.

The majority, nevertheless, has no problem labeling the
conduct of fifth graders "sexual harassment" and "gender
discrimination." Indeed, the majority sidesteps the difficult
issue entirely, first by asserting without analysis that respondents do not "support an argument that student-onstudent harassment cannot rise to the level of discrimination'
for purposes of Title IX," ante, at 639, and then by citing
Gebser and Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools,
503 U. S. 60 (1992), for the proposition that "[w]e have elsewhere concluded that sexual harassment is a form of discrimination for Title IX purposes and that Title IX proscribes
harassment with sufficient clarity to satisfy Pennhurst's no526US3 Unit: $U60 [01-04-01 06:48:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Kennedy, J., dissenting
tice requirement and serve as a basis for a damages action,"
ante, at 649-650.

Contrary to the majority's assertion, however, respond-ents have made a cogent and persuasive argument that the

type of student conduct alleged by petitioner should not be
considered "sexual harassment," much less gender discrimi-nation actionable under Title IX:

"[A]t the time Petitioner filed her complaint, no court,
including this Court had recognized the concept of sex-ual harassment in any context other than the employment context. Nor had any Court extended the concept
of sexual harassment to the misconduct of emotionallyand socially immature children. The type of conduct alleged by Petitioner in her complaint is not new. How-ever, in past years it was properly identified as misconduct which was addressed within the context of studentdiscipline. The Petitioner now asks this Court to create
out of whole cloth a cause of action by labeling childish
misconduct as `sexual harassment,' to stigmatize chil-dren as sexual harassers, and have the federal court system take on the additional burden of second guessingthe disciplinary actions taken by school administrators
in addressing misconduct, something this Court has con-sistently refused to do." Brief for Respondents 12-13
(citation omitted).
See also Brief for Independent Women's Forum as Amicus
Curiae 19 (questioning whether "at the primary and second-ary school level" it is proper to label "sexual misconduct by

students" as "sexual harassment" because there is no power
relationship between the harasser and the victim).

Likewise, the majority's assertion that Gebser and Franklin settled the question is little more than ipse dixit.
Gebser and Franklin themselves did nothing more than cite
Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U. S. 57, 64
(1986), a Title VII case, for the proposition that "when a su526US3 Unit: $U60 [01-04-01 06:48:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Kennedy, J., dissenting
pervisor sexually harasses a subordinate because of the sub-ordinate's sex, that supervisor `discriminate[s]' on the basis

of sex." See Franklin, supra, at 74; Gebser, 524 U. S., at282-283. To treat that proposition as establishing that the
student conduct at issue here is gender discrimination is to
erase, in one stroke, all differences between children andadults, peers and teachers, schools and workplaces.

In reality, there is no established body of federal or statelaw on which courts may draw in defining the student conduct that qualifies as Title IX gender discrimination. Anal-ogies to Title VII hostile environment harassment are inapposite, because schools are not workplaces and children are
not adults. The norms of the adult workplace that have
defined hostile environment sexual harassment, see, e. g.,
Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., 523 U. S. 75
(1998), are not easily translated to peer relationships in
schools, where teenage romantic relationships and dating are
a part of everyday life. Analogies to Title IX teacher sexual
harassment of students are similarly flawed. A teacher's
sexual overtures toward a student are always inappropriate; a teenager's romantic overtures to a classmate (even
when persistent and unwelcome) are an inescapable part of
adolescence.

The majority admits that, under its approach, "[w]hether
gender-oriented conduct rises to the level of actionable `harassment' . . . `depends on a constellation of surrounding circumstances, expectations, and relationships,' including, but
not limited to, the ages of the harasser and the victim and
the number of individuals involved." Ante, at 651 (citations
omitted). The majority does not explain how a school is supposed to discern from this mishmash of factors what is actionable discrimination. Its multifactored balancing test is
a far cry from the clarity we demand of Spending Clause
legislation.

The difficulties schools will encounter in identifying peer
sexual harassment are already evident in teachers' manuals

Kennedy, J., dissenting
designed to give guidance on the subject. For example, oneteachers' manual on peer sexual harassment suggests that

sexual harassment in kindergarten through third grade in-cludes a boy being "put down" on the playground "because
he wants to play house with the girls" or a girl being "put
down because she shoots baskets better than the boys."Minnesota Dept. of Education, Girls and Boys Getting Along:

Teaching Sexual Harassment Prevention in the ElementaryClassroom 65 (1993). Yet another manual suggests that
one student saying to another, "You look nice," could besexual harassment, depending on the "tone of voice," how
the student looks at the other, and "who else is around."
N. Stein & L. Sjostrom, Flirting or Hurting? A Teacher's
Guide on Student-to-Student Sexual Harassment in Schools
(Grades 6 through 12), p. 14 (1994). Blowing a kiss is also
suspect. Ibid. This confusion will likely be compounded
once the sexual harassment label is invested with the force
of federal law, backed up by private damages suits.

The only guidance the majority gives schools in distinguishing between the "simple acts of teasing and namecalling among school children," said not to be a basis for suit
even when they "target differences in gender," ante, at 652,
and actionable peer sexual harassment is, in reality, no guidance at all. The majority proclaims that "in the context of
student-on-student harassment, damages are available only
where the behavior is so severe, pervasive, and objectively
offensive that it denies its victims the equal access to education that Title IX is designed to protect." Ibid. The majority does not even purport to explain, however, what constitutes an actionable denial of "equal access to education."
Is equal access denied when a girl who tires of being chased
by the boys at recess refuses to go outside? When she cannot concentrate during class because she is worried about
the recess activities? When she pretends to be sick one day
so she can stay home from school? It appears the majority
is content to let juries decide.

Kennedy, J., dissenting
The majority's reference to a "systemic effect," ante, at653, does nothing to clarify the content of its standard. The

majority appears to intend that requirement to do no morethan exclude the possibility that a single act of harassment
perpetrated by one student on one other student can formthe basis for an actionable claim. That is a small concession indeed.The only real clue the majority gives schools about the
dividing line between actionable harassment that denies avictim equal access to education and mere inappropriate
teasing is a profoundly unsettling one: On the facts of thiscase, petitioner has stated a claim because she alleged, in
the majority's words, "that the harassment had a concrete,negative effect on her daughter's ability to receive an education." Ante, at 654. In petitioner's words, the effects thatmight have been visible to the school were that her daughter's grades "dropped" and her "ability to concentrate on herschool work [was] affected." App. to Pet. for Cert. 97a. Almost all adolescents experience these problems at one timeor another as they mature.

III
The majority's inability to provide any workable definitionof actionable peer harassment simply underscores the myriad ways in which an opinion that purports to be narrow is,in fact, so broad that it will support untold numbers of lawyers who will prove adept at presenting cases that will with-stand the defendant school districts' pretrial motions. Each
of the barriers to runaway litigation the majority offers uscrumbles under the weight of even casual scrutiny.

For example, the majority establishes what sounds like arelatively high threshold for liability--"denial of equal access" to education--and, almost in the same breath, makesclear that alleging a decline in grades is enough to survive
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and, it follows, tostate a winning claim. The majority seems oblivious to the

678 DAVIS v. MONROE COUNTY BD. OF ED.

Kennedy, J., dissenting
fact that almost every child, at some point, has trouble inschool because he or she is being teased by his or her peers.

The girl who wants to skip recess because she is teased bythe boys is no different from the overweight child who skips
gym class because the other children tease her about her size
in the locker room; or the child who risks flunking out be-cause he refuses to wear glasses to avoid the taunts of "foureyes"; or the child who refuses to go to school because theschool bully calls him a "scaredy-cat" at recess. Most children respond to teasing in ways that detract from their abil-ity to learn. The majority's test for actionable harassment
will, as a result, sweep in almost all of the more innocuous
conduct it acknowledges as a ubiquitous part of school life.

The string of adjectives the majority attaches to the word
"harassment"--"severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive"--likewise fails to narrow the class of conduct that can
trigger liability, since the touchstone for determining
whether there is Title IX liability is the effect on the child's
ability to get an education. Ante, at 650. Indeed, the
Court's reliance on the impact on the child's educational
experience suggests that the "objective offensiveness" of a
comment is to be judged by reference to a reasonable child at
whom the comments were aimed. Not only is that standard
likely to be quite expansive, it also gives schools--and juries--little guidance, requiring them to attempt to gauge the
sensitivities of, for instance, the average seven-year-old.

The majority assures us that its decision will not interfere
with school discipline and instructs that, "as we have previously noted, courts should refrain from second-guessing
the disciplinary decisions made by school administrators."
Ante, at 648. The obvious reason for the majority's expressed reluctance to allow courts and litigants to secondguess school disciplinary decisions is that school officials are
usually in the best position to judge the seriousness of alleged harassment and to devise an appropriate response.
The problem is that the majority's test, in fact, invites courts

and juries to second-guess school administrators in everycase, to judge in each instance whether the school's response

was "clearly unreasonable." A reasonableness standard, re-gardless of the modifier, transforms every disciplinary decision into a jury question. Cf. Doe v. University of Illinois,
138 F. 3d 653, 655 (CA7 1998) (holding that college studenthad stated a Title IX claim for peer sexual harassment even

though school officials had suspended two male students for10 days and transferred another out of her biology class).

Another professed limitation the majority relies upon isthat the recipient will be liable only where the acts of student harassment are "known." See, e. g., ante, at 644, 647.
The majority's enunciation of the standard begs the obvious
question: known to whom? Yet the majority says not one
word about the type of school employee who must know
about the harassment before it is actionable.

The majority's silence is telling. The deliberate indifference liability we recognized in Gebser was predicated on notice to "an official of the recipient entity with authority to
take corrective action to end the discrimination." 524 U. S.,
at 290. The majority gives no indication that it believes the
standard to be any different in this context and--given its
extensive reliance on the Gebser standard throughout the
opinion--appears to adopt the Gebser notice standard by implication. At least the courts adjudicating Title IX peer
harassment claims are likely to so conclude.

By choosing not to adopt the standard in explicit terms,
the majority avoids having to confront the bizarre implications of its decision. In the context of teacher harassment,
the Gebser notice standard imposes some limit on school liability. Where peer harassment is the discrimination, however, it imposes no limitation at all. In most cases of student misbehavior, it is the teacher who has authority, at least
in the first instance, to punish the student and take other
measures to remedy the harassment. The anomalous result
will be that, while a school district cannot be held liable for

a teacher's sexual harassment of a student without notice tothe school board (or at least to the principal), the district can

be held liable for a teacher's failure to remedy peer harass-ment. The threshold for school liability, then, appears to be
lower when the harasser is a student than when the harasser
is a teacher who is an agent of the school. The absurdityof this result confirms that it was neither contemplated by

Congress nor anticipated by the States.The majority's limitations on peer sexual harassment suits
cannot hope to contain the flood of liability the Court todaybegins. The elements of the Title IX claim created by the
majority will be easy not only to allege but also to prove.
A female plaintiff who pleads only that a boy called her offensive names, that she told a teacher, that the teacher's response was unreasonable, and that her school performance
suffered as a result, appears to state a successful claim.

There will be no shortage of plaintiffs to bring such complaints. Our schools are charged each day with educating
millions of children. Of those millions of students, a large
percentage will, at some point during their school careers,
experience something they consider sexual harassment. A
1993 study by the American Association of University
Women Educational Foundation, for instance, found that
"fully 4 out of 5 students (81%) report that they have been
the target of some form of sexual harassment during their
school lives." Hostile Hallways: The AAUW Survey on
Sexual Harassment in America's Schools 7 (1993). The number of potential lawsuits against our schools is staggering.

The cost of defending against peer sexual harassment suits
alone could overwhelm many school districts, particularly
since the majority's liability standards will allow almost any
plaintiff to get to summary judgment, if not to a jury. In
addition, there are no damages caps on the judicially implied
private cause of action under Title IX. As a result, school
liability in one peer sexual harassment suit could approach,
or even exceed, the total federal funding of many school dis526US3 Unit: $U60 [01-04-01 06:48:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN

district sued in Gebser received only $120,000 in federal
funds a year. 524 U. S., 289-290. Indeed, the entire 1992-1993 budget of that district was only $1.6 million. See Tr. of

Oral Arg. in No. 96-1866, p. 34.The limitless liability confronting our schools under the
implied Title IX cause of action puts schools in a far worseposition than businesses; when Congress established the express cause of action for money damages under Title VII, it
prescribed damages caps. See Gebser, supra, at 286 ("It
was not until 1991 that Congress made damages available
under Title VII, and even then, Congress carefully limited
the amount recoverable in any individual case, calibrating
the maximum recovery to the size of the employer. See 42
U. S. C. $ 1981a(b)(3). Adopting petitioner's position would
amount, then, to allowing unlimited recovery of damages
under Title IX where Congress has not spoken on the subject
of either the right or the remedy, and in the face of evidence
that when Congress expressly considered both in Title VII
it restricted the amount of damages available"). In addition,
in contrast to Title VII, Title IX makes no provision for
agency investigation and conciliation of complaints (prior to
the filing of a case in federal court) that could weed out frivolous suits or settle meritorious ones at minimal cost.

The prospect of unlimited Title IX liability will, in all likelihood, breed a climate of fear that encourages school administrators to label even the most innocuous of childish conduct
sexual harassment. It would appear to be no coincidence
that, not long after the DOE issued its proposed policy guidance warning that schools could be liable for peer sexual harassment in the fall of 1996, see 61 Fed. Reg. 42728, a North
Carolina school suspended a 6-year-old boy who kissed a female classmate on the cheek for sexual harassment, on the

theory that "[u]nwelcome is unwelcome at any age." LosAngeles Times, Sept. 25, 1996, p. A11. A week later, a New

York school suspended a second grader who kissed a class-mate and ripped a button off her skirt. Buffalo News, Oct.
2, 1996, p. A16. The second grader said that he got the idea
from his favorite book "Corduroy," about a bear with a miss-ing button.

Ibid. School administrators said only, "We
were given guidelines as to why we suspend children. Wefollow the guidelines."

Ibid.
At the college level, the majority's holding is sure to addfuel to the debate over campus speech codes that, in the

name of preventing a hostile educational environment, may
infringe students' First Amendment rights. See supra, at
667. Indeed, under the majority's control principle, schools
presumably will be responsible for remedying conduct that
occurs even in student dormitory rooms. As a result,
schools may well be forced to apply workplace norms in the
most private of domains.

Even schools that resist overzealous enforcement may find
that the most careful and reasoned response to a sexual harassment complaint nonetheless provokes litigation. Speaking with the voice of experience, the school amici remind us,
"[h]istory shows that, no matter what a school official chooses
to do, someone will be unhappy. Student offenders almost
always view their punishment as too strict, and student complainants almost always view an offender's punishment as
too lax." Brief for School Amici 12 (footnotes omitted).

A school faced with a peer sexual harassment complaint in
the wake of the majority's decision may well be beset with
litigation from every side. One student's demand for a quick
response to her harassment complaint will conflict with the
alleged harasser's demand for due process. Another student's demand for a harassment-free classroom will conflict
with the alleged harasser's claim to a mainstream placement
under the IDEA or with his state constitutional right to a
continuing, free public education. On college campuses, and

Kennedy, J., dissenting
even in secondary schools, a student's claim that the schoolshould remedy a sexually hostile environment will conflict

with the alleged harasser's claim that his speech, even if of-fensive, is protected by the First Amendment. In each of
these situations, the school faces the risk of suit, and maybe
even multiple suits, regardless of its response. See Doe v.
University of Illinois, 138 F. 3d, at 679 (Posner, C. J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc) ("Liability for fail-ing to prevent or rectify sexual harassment of one student by

another places a school on a razor's edge, since the remedialmeasures that it takes against the alleged harasser are as
likely to expose the school to a suit by him as a failure to
take those measure[s] would be to expose the school to a suit
by the victim of the alleged harassment").

The majority's holding in this case appears to be driven by
the image of the school administration sitting idle every day
while male students commandeer a school's athletic field or
computer lab and prevent female students from using it
through physical threats. See ante, at 650-651. Title IX
might provide a remedy in such a situation, however, without
resort to the majority's unprecedented theory of school liability for student harassment. If the school usually disciplines
students for threatening each other and prevents them from
blocking others' access to school facilities, then the school's
failure to enforce its rules when the boys target the girls on
a widespread level, day after day, may support an inference
that the school's decision not to respond is itself based on
gender. That pattern of discriminatory response could form
the basis of a Title IX action.

(Contrary to the majority's assertion, see ante, at 653, I
do not suggest that mere indifference to gender-based mistreatment--even if widespread--is enough to trigger Title
IX liability. I suggest only that a clear pattern of discriminatory enforcement of school rules could raise an inference
that the school itself is discriminating. Recognizing that the
school itself might discriminate based on gender in the en526US3 Unit: $U60 [01-04-01 06:48:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN

forcement of its rules is a far cry from recognizing Title IXliability based on the majority's expansive theory that a

school "subjects" its students to third-party discriminationwhen it has some control over the harasser and fails to take
corrective action.)

Even more important, in most egregious cases the studentwill have state-law remedies available to her. The student

will often have recourse against the offending student (or hisparents) under state tort law. In some cases, like this one,
the perpetrator may also be subject to criminal sanctions.And, as the majority notes, the student may, in some circumstances, have recourse against the school under state law.
Ante, at 644.

Disregarding these state-law remedies for student misbehavior and the incentives that our schools already have to
provide the best possible education to all of their students,
the majority seeks, in effect, to put an end to student misbehavior by transforming Title IX into a Federal Student Civility Code. See Brief for Independent Women's Forum as
Amicus Curiae 2 (urging the Court to avoid that result). I
fail to see how federal courts will administer school discipline
better than the principals and teachers to whom the public
has entrusted that task or how the majority's holding will
help the vast majority of students, whose educational opportunities will be diminished by the diversion of school funds
to litigation. The private cause of action the Court creates will justify a corps of federal administrators in writing
regulations on student harassment. It will also embroil
schools and courts in endless litigation over what qualifies as
peer sexual harassment and what constitutes a reasonable
response.

In the final analysis, this case is about federalism. Yet
the majority's decision today says not one word about the
federal balance. Preserving our federal system is a legitimate end in itself. It is, too, the means to other ends. It
ensures that essential choices can be made by a government

Kennedy, J., dissenting
more proximate to the people than the vast apparatus offederal power. Defining the appropriate role of schools in

teaching and supervising children who are beginning to ex-plore their own sexuality and learning how to express it to
others is one of the most complex and sensitive issues our
schools face. Such decisions are best made by parents andby the teachers and school administrators who can counsel

with them. The delicacy and immense significance of teach-ing children about sexuality should cause the Court to act
with great restraint before it displaces state and localgovernments.

Heedless of these considerations, the Court rushes onward, finding that the cause of action it creates is necessary
to effect the congressional design. It is not. Nothing in
Title IX suggests that Congress intended or contemplated
the result the Court reaches today, much less dictated it in
unambiguous terms. Today's decision cannot be laid at the
feet of Congress; it is the responsibility of the Court.

The Court must always use great care when it shapes private causes of action without clear guidance from Congress,
but never more so than when the federal balance is at stake.
As we recognized in Gebser, the definition of an implied
cause of action inevitably implicates some measure of discretion in the Court to shape a sensible remedial scheme. 524
U. S., at 284. Whether the Court ever should have embarked on this endeavor under a Spending Clause statute is
open to question. What should be clear beyond any doubt,
however, is that the Court is duty bound to exercise that
discretion with due regard for federalism and the unique role
of the States in our system. The Court today disregards
that obligation. I can conceive of few interventions more
intrusive upon the delicate and vital relations between
teacher and student, between student and student, and between the State and its citizens than the one the Court creates today by its own hand. Trusted principles of federalism are superseded by a more contemporary imperative.

Perhaps the most grave, and surely the most lasting, dis-service of today's decision is that it ensures the Court's own

disregard for the federal balance soon will be imparted to ouryoungest citizens. The Court clears the way for the Federal
Government to claim center stage in America's classrooms.Today's decision mandates to teachers instructing and supervising their students the dubious assistance of federal courtplaintiffs and their lawyers and makes the federal courts the
final arbiters of school policy and of almost every disagree-ment between students. Enforcement of the federal right
recognized by the majority means that federal influencewill permeate everything from curriculum decisions to dayto-day classroom logistics and interactions. After today,Johnny will find that the routine problems of adolescence are
to be resolved by invoking a federal right to demand assign-ment to a desk two rows away.

As its holding makes painfully clear, the majority'swatered-down version of the Spending Clause clearstatement rule is no substitute for the real protections ofstate and local autonomy that our constitutional system requires. If there be any doubt of the futility of the Court'sattempt to hedge its holding about with words of limitation
for future cases, the result in this case provides the answer.The complaint of this fifth grader survives and the school
will be compelled to answer in federal court. We can beassured that like suits will follow--suits, which in cost and
number, will impose serious financial burdens on local schooldistricts, the taxpayers who support them, and the children
they serve. Federalism and our struggling school systemsdeserve better from this Court. I dissent.

CITY OF MONTEREY v. DEL MONTE DUNES ATMONTEREY, LTD.,

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 97-1235. Argued October 7, 1998--Decided May 24, 1999
After petitioner city imposed more rigorous demands each of the five

times it rejected applications to develop a parcel of land owned by respondent Del Monte Dunes and its predecessor in interest, Del Monte
Dunes brought this suit under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983. The District Court
submitted the case to the jury on Del Monte Dunes' theory that the
city effected a regulatory taking or otherwise injured the property by
unlawful acts, without paying compensation or providing an adequate
postdeprivation remedy for the loss. The court instructed the jury to
find for Del Monte Dunes if it found either that Del Monte Dunes had
been denied all economically viable use of its property or that the city's
decision to reject the final development proposal did not substantially
advance a legitimate public purpose. The jury found for Del Monte
Dunes. In affirming, the Ninth Circuit ruled, inter alia, that the District Court did not err in allowing Del Monte Dunes' takings claim to
be tried to a jury, because Del Monte Dunes had a right to a jury trial
under $ 1983; that whether Del Monte Dunes had been denied all economically viable use of the property and whether the city's denial of the
final proposal substantially advanced legitimate public interests were,
on the facts of this case, questions suitable for the jury; and that the
jury reasonably could have decided each of these questions in Del Monte
Dunes' favor.

Held: The judgment is affirmed.
95 F. 3d 1422, affirmed.

Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to
Part IV-A-2, concluding that:

1. The Ninth Circuit's discussion of the rough-proportionality standard of Dolan v. City of Tigard, 512 U. S. 374, 391, is irrelevant to this
Court's disposition of the case. Although this Court believes the Dolan
standard is inapposite to a case such as this one, the jury instructions
did not mention proportionality, let alone require the jury to find for Del
Monte Dunes unless the city's actions were roughly proportional to its
asserted interests. The rough-proportionality discussion, furthermore,
was unnecessary to sustain the jury's verdict, given the Ninth Circuit's
holding that Del Monte Dunes had proffered evidence sufficient to rebut

each of the city's reasons for denying the final development plan.
Pp. 702-703.

2. In holding that the jury could have found the city's denial of the
final development plan not reasonably related to legitimate public interests, the Ninth Circuit did not impermissibly adopt a rule allowing
wholesale interference by judge or jury with municipal land-use policies,
laws, or routine regulatory decisions. As the city itself proposed the
essence of the jury instructions, it cannot now contend that these instructions did not provide an accurate statement of the law. In any
event, the instructions are consistent with this Court's previous general
discussions of regulatory takings liability. See, e. g., Agins v. City of
Tiburon, 447 U. S. 255, 260. Given that the city did not challenge below
the applicability or continued viability of these authorities, the Court
declines the suggestions of amici to revisit them. To the extent the
city contends the District Court's judgment was based upon a jury determination of the reasonableness of its general zoning laws or land-use
policies, its argument can be squared with neither the jury instructions
nor the theory on which the case was tried, which were confined to the
question whether, in light of the case's history and context, the city's
particular decision to deny Del Monte Dunes' final development proposal
was reasonably related to the city's proffered justifications. To the
extent the city argues that, as a matter of law, its land-use decisions
are immune from judicial scrutiny under all circumstances, its position
is contrary to settled regulatory takings principles and is rejected.
Pp. 703-707.

3. The District Court properly submitted the question of liability on
Del Monte Dunes' regulatory takings claim to the jury. Pp. 707-711,
718-722.

(a) The propriety of such submission depends on whether Del
Monte Dunes had a statutory or constitutional right to a jury trial, and,
if it did, the nature and extent of the right. Because $ 1983 does not
itself confer the jury right when it authorizes "an action at law" to redress deprivation of a federal right under color of state law, the constitutional question must be reached. The Court's interpretation of the Seventh Amendment--which provides that "[i]n Suits at common law, . . .
the right of trial by jury shall be preserved"--has been guided by historical analysis comprising two principal inquiries: (1) whether the cause
of action either was tried at law at the time of the founding or is at least
analogous to one that was, and (2) if so, whether the particular trial
decision must fall to the jury in order to preserve the substance of the
common-law right as it existed in 1791. Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., 517 U. S. 370, 376. Pp. 707-708.

Syllabus
(b) Del Monte Dunes' $ 1983 suit is an action at law for Seventh
Amendment purposes. Pp. 708-711.

(1) That Amendment applies not only to common-law causes of
action but also to statutory causes of action analogous to common-law
causes of action ordinarily decided in English law courts in the late 18th
century, as opposed to those customarily heard by courts of equity or
admiralty. E. g., Feltner v. Columbia Pictures Television, Inc., 523
U. S. 340, 348. Pp. 708-709.

(2) A $ 1983 suit seeking legal relief is an action at law within
the Seventh Amendment's meaning. It is undisputed that when the
Amendment was adopted there was no action equivalent to $ 1983. It
is settled law, however, that the Amendment's jury guarantee extends
to statutory claims unknown to the common law, so long as the claims
can be said to "soun[d] basically in tort," and seek legal relief. Curtis
v. Loether, 415 U. S. 189, 195-196. There can be no doubt that $ 1983
claims sound in tort. See, e. g., Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U. S. 477, 483.
Here Del Monte Dunes sought legal relief in the form of damages for
the unconstitutional denial of just compensation. Damages for a constitutional violation are a legal remedy. See, e. g., Teamsters v. Terry, 494
U. S. 558, 570. Pp. 709-711.

(c) The particular liability issues were proper for determination by
the jury. Pp. 718-722.

(1) In making this determination, the Court looks to history to
determine whether the particular issues, or analogous ones, were decided by judge or by jury in suits at common law at the time the Seventh
Amendment was adopted. Where history does not provide a clear
answer, the Court looks to precedent and functional considerations.
Markman, supra, at 384. P. 718.

(2) There is no precise analogue for the specific test of liability
submitted to the jury in this case, although some guidance is provided
by the fact that, in suits sounding in tort for money damages, questions
of liability were usually decided by the jury, rather than the judge.
Pp. 718-719.

(3) None of the Court's regulatory takings precedents has addressed the proper allocation of liability determinations between judge
and jury in explicit terms. In Williamson County Regional Planning
Comm'n v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, 473 U. S. 172, 191, the
Court assumed the propriety of submitting to the jury the question
whether a county planning commission had denied the plaintiff landowner all economically viable use of the property. However, because
Williamson is not a direct holding, further guidance must be found in
considerations of process and function. Pp. 719-720.

Syllabus
(4) In actions at law otherwise within the purview of the Seventh
Amendment, the issue whether a landowner has been deprived of all
economically viable use of his property is for the jury. The issue is
predominantly factual, e. g., Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U. S.
393, 413, and in actions at law such issues are in most cases allocated to
the jury, see, e. g., Baltimore & Carolina Line, Inc. v. Redman, 295 U. S.
654, 657. Pp. 720-721.

(5) Although the question whether a land-use decision substantially advances legitimate public interests is probably best understood
as a mixed question of fact and law, here, the narrow question submitted
to the jury was whether, when viewed in light of the context and protracted history of the development application process, the city's decision to reject a particular development plan bore a reasonable relationship to its proffered justifications. This question was essentially
fact-bound in nature, and thus was properly submitted to the jury.
P. 721.

(d) This Seventh Amendment holding is limited in various respects:
It does not address the jury's role in an ordinary inverse condemnation
suit, or attempt a precise demarcation of the respective provinces of
judge and jury in determining whether a zoning decision substantially
advances legitimate governmental interests that would extend to other
contexts. Del Monte Dunes' argument was not that the city had followed its zoning ordinances and policies but rather that it had not done
so. As is often true in $ 1983 actions, the disputed questions were
whether the government had denied a constitutional right in acting outside the bounds of its authority, and, if so, the extent of any resulting
damages. These were questions for the jury. Pp. 721-722.

Justice Kennedy, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice Stevens,
and Justice Thomas, concluded in Part IV-A-2 that the city's request
to create an exception to the general Seventh Amendment rule governing $ 1983 actions for claims alleging violations of the Fifth Amendment
Takings Clause must be rejected. Pp. 711-718.

1. This Court has declined in other contexts to classify $ 1983 actions
based on the nature of the underlying right asserted, and the city provides no persuasive justification for adopting a different rule for Seventh Amendment purposes. P. 711.

2. Even when analyzed not as a $ 1983 action simpliciter, but as a

$ 1983 action seeking redress for an uncompensated taking, Del Monte
Dunes' suit remains an action at law. Contrary to the city's submission,
a formal condemnation proceeding--as to which the Court has said there
is no constitutional jury right, e. g., United States v. Reynolds, 397 U. S.
14, 18--is not the controlling analogy here. That analogy is rendered

Syllabus
inapposite by fundamental differences between a condemnation proceeding and a $ 1983 action to redress an uncompensated taking. Most important, when the government initiates condemnation proceedings, it
concedes the landowner's right to receive just compensation and seeks
a mere determination of the amount of compensation due. Liability
simply is not an issue. This difference renders the analogy not only
unhelpful but inapposite. See, e. g., Bonaparte v. Camden & Amboy R.
Co., 3 F. Cas. 821, 829 (No. 1,617) (CC NJ). Moreover, when the government condemns property for public use, it provides the landowner a
forum for seeking just compensation as is required by the Constitution.
See First English Evangelical Lutheran Church of Glendale v. County
of Los Angeles, 482 U. S. 304, 316. If the condemnation proceedings do
not, in fact, deny the landowner just compensation, the government's
actions are neither unconstitutional nor unlawful. E. g., Williamson,
supra, at 195. In this case, however, Del Monte Dunes was denied not
only its property but also just compensation or even an adequate forum
for seeking it. In these circumstances, the original understanding of
the Takings Clause and historical practice support the conclusion that
the cause of action sounds in tort and is most analogous to the various
actions that lay at common law to recover damages for interference with
property interests. In such common-law actions, there was a right to
trial by jury. See, e. g., Feltner, supra, at 349. The city's argument,
that because the Constitution allows the government to take property
for public use, a taking for that purpose cannot be tortious or unlawful,
is rejected. When the government repudiates its duty to provide just
compensation, see, e. g., First English, supra, at 315, it violates the Constitution, and its actions are unlawful and tortious. Pp. 711-718.

Justice Scalia concluded:
1. The Seventh Amendment provides respondents with a right to a
jury trial on their $ 1983 claim. All $ 1983 actions must be treated alike
insofar as that right is concerned. Section 1983 establishes a unique,
or at least distinctive, cause of action, in that the legal duty which is the
basis for relief is ultimately defined not by the claim-creating statute
itself, but by an extrinsic body of law to which the statute refers,
namely, "federal rights elsewhere conferred." Baker v. McCollan, 443
U. S. 137, 144, n. 3. The question before the Court then is not what
common-law action is most analogous to some generic suit seeking compensation for a Fifth Amendment taking, but what common-law action
is most analogous to a $ 1983 claim. This Court has concluded that all

$ 1983 claims should be characterized in the same way, Wilson v. Garcia,
471 U. S. 261, 271-272, as tort actions for the recovery of damages for
personal injuries, id., at 276. Pp. 723-726.

e. g., Curtis v. Loether, 415 U. S. 189, 195. Pp. 727-731.

3. The trial court properly submitted the particular issues raised by
respondents' $ 1983 claim to the jury. The question whether they were
deprived of all economically viable use of their property presents primarily a question of fact appropriate for jury consideration. As to the
question whether petitioner's rejection of respondents' building plans
substantially advanced a legitimate public purpose, the subquestion
whether the government's asserted basis for its challenged action represents a legitimate state interest was properly removed from the jury's
cognizance, but the subquestion whether that legitimate state interest
is substantially furthered by the challenged government action is, at
least in the highly particularized context of the present case, a jury
question. Pp. 731-732.

694 MONTEREY v. DEL MONTE DUNES AT MONTEREY, LTD.

Opinion of the Court
city of Monterey. The city, in a series of repeated rejec-tions, denied proposals to develop the property, each time

imposing more rigorous demands on the developers. DelMonte Dunes brought suit in the United States District
Court for the Northern District of California, under Rev.Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983. After protracted litigation,
the case was submitted to the jury on Del Monte Dunes' the-ory that the city effected a regulatory taking or otherwise
injured the property by unlawful acts, without paying com-pensation or providing an adequate postdeprivation remedy
for the loss. The jury found for Del Monte Dunes, and theCourt of Appeals affirmed.

The petitioner contends that the regulatory takings claimshould not have been decided by the jury and that the Court
of Appeals adopted an erroneous standard for regulatorytakings liability. We need not decide all of the questions
presented by the petitioner, nor need we examine each ofthe points given by the Court of Appeals in its decision to
affirm. The controlling question is whether, given the city'sapparent concession that the instructions were a correct
statement of the law, the matter was properly submitted tothe jury. We conclude that it was, and that the judgment of
the Court of Appeals should be affirmed.

I
A

The property which Del Monte Dunes and its predecessorin interest (landowners) sought to develop was a 37.6-acre

ocean-front parcel located in the city of Monterey, at or nearthe city's boundary to the north, where Highway 1 enters.
With the exception of the ocean and a state park located tothe northeast, the parcel was virtually surrounded by a railroad right-of-way and properties devoted to industrial, com-mercial, and multifamily residential uses. The parcel itself
was zoned for multifamily residential use under the city'sgeneral zoning ordinance.

695Cite as: 526 U. S. 687 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
The parcel had not been untouched by its urban and indus-trial proximities. A sewer line housed in 15-foot man-made

dunes covered with jute matting and surrounded by snowfencing traversed the property. Trash, dumped in violation
of the law, had accumulated on the premises. The parcelhad been used for many years by an oil company as a terminal and tank farm where large quantities of oil were deliv-ered, stored, and reshipped. When the company stopped
using the site, it had removed its oil tanks but left behindtank pads, an industrial complex, pieces of pipe, broken concrete, and oil-soaked sand. The company had introducednonnative ice plant to prevent erosion and to control soil conditions around the oil tanks. Ice plant secretes a substancethat forces out other plants and is not compatible with the
parcel's natural flora. By the time the landowners sought todevelop the property, ice plant had spread to some 25 percent
of the parcel, and, absent human intervention, would con-tinue to advance, endangering and perhaps eliminating the
parcel's remaining natural vegetation.The natural flora the ice plant encroached upon included
buckwheat, the natural habitat of the endangered Smith'sBlue Butterfly. The butterfly lives for one week, travels a
maximum of 200 feet, and must land on a mature, floweringbuckwheat plant to survive. Searches for the butterfly from
1981 through 1985 yielded but a single larva, discovered in1984. No other specimens had been found on the property,
and the parcel was quite isolated from other possible habitatsof the butterfly.

B
In 1981 the landowners submitted an application to de-velop the property in conformance with the city's zoning and

general plan requirements. Although the zoning require-ments permitted the development of up to 29 housing units
per acre, or more than 1,000 units for the entire parcel, thelandowners' proposal was limited to 344 residential units.
In 1982 the city's planning commission denied the application

696 MONTEREY v. DEL MONTE DUNES AT MONTEREY, LTD.

Opinion of the Court
but stated that a proposal for 264 units would receive favor-able consideration. In keeping with the suggestion, the

landowners submitted a revised proposal for 264 units. Inlate 1983, however, the planning commission again denied the
application. The commission once more requested a reduction in the scale of the development, this time saying a planfor 224 units would be received with favor. The landowners

returned to the drawing board and prepared a proposal for224 units, which, its previous statements notwithstanding,
the planning commission denied in 1984. The landownersappealed to the city council, which overruled the planning
commission's denial and referred the project back to the commission, with instructions to consider a proposal for 190
units.

The landowners once again reduced the scope of their development proposal to comply with the city's request, and
submitted four specific, detailed site plans, each for a total of
190 units for the whole parcel. Even so, the planning commission rejected the landowners' proposal later in 1984.
Once more the landowners appealed to the city council. The
council again overruled the commission, finding the proposal
conceptually satisfactory and in conformance with the city's
previous decisions regarding, inter alia, density, number of
units, location on the property, and access. The council then
approved one of the site plans, subject to various specific
conditions, and granted an 18-month conditional use permit
for the proposed development.

The landowners spent most of the next year revising their
proposal and taking other steps to fulfill the city's conditions.
Their final plan, submitted in 1985, devoted 17.9 of the 37.6
acres to public open space (including a public beach and areas
for the restoration and preservation of the buckwheat habitat), 7.9 acres to open, landscaped areas, and 6.7 acres to
public and private streets (including public parking and access to the beach). Only 5.1 acres were allocated to buildings and patios. The plan was designed, in accordance with

526US3 Unit: $U61 [01-03-01 13:40:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN

697Cite as: 526 U. S. 687 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
the city's demands, to provide the public with a beach, abuffer zone between the development and the adjoining state

park, and view corridors so the buildings would not be visibleto motorists on the nearby highway; the proposal also called
for restoring and preserving as much of the sand dune structure and buckwheat habitat as possible consistent with de-velopment and the city's requirements.

After detailed review of the proposed buildings, roads, andparking facilities, the city's architectural review committee
approved the plan. Following hearings before the planningcommission, the commission's professional staff found the
final plan addressed and substantially satisfied the city's
conditions. It proposed the planning commission make specific findings to this effect and recommended the plan be
approved.

In January 1986, less than two months before the landowners' conditional use permit was to expire, the planning commission rejected the recommendation of its staff and denied
the development plan. The landowners appealed to the city
council, also requesting a 12-month extension of their permit
to allow them time to attempt to comply with any additional
requirements the council might impose. The permit was extended until a hearing could be held before the city council
in June 1986. After the hearing, the city council denied the
final plan, not only declining to specify measures the landowners could take to satisfy the concerns raised by the council but also refusing to extend the conditional use permit to
allow time to address those concerns. The council's decision, moreover, came at a time when a sewer moratorium
issued by another agency would have prevented or at least
delayed development based on a new plan.

The council did not base its decision on the landowners'
failure to meet any of the specific conditions earlier prescribed by the city. Rather, the council made general findings that the landowners had not provided adequate access
for the development (even though the landowners had twice

Opinion of the Court
changed the specific access plans to comply with the city'sdemands and maintained they could satisfy the city's new

objections if granted an extension), that the plan's layoutwould damage the environment (even though the location of
the development on the property was necessitated by thecity's demands for a public beach, view corridors, and a
buffer zone next to the state park), and that the plan woulddisrupt the habitat of the Smith's Blue Butterfly (even
though the plan would remove the encroaching ice plant andpreserve or restore buckwheat habitat on almost half of the
property, and even though only one larva had ever beenfound on the property).

C
After five years, five formal decisions, and 19 different siteplans, 10 Tr. 1294-1295 (Feb. 9, 1994), Del Monte Dunes

decided the city would not permit development of the prop-erty under any circumstances. Del Monte Dunes commenced suit against the city in the United States DistrictCourt for the Northern District of California under 42
U. S. C. $ 1983, alleging, inter alia, that denial of the finaldevelopment proposal was a violation of the due process and
equal protection provisions of the Fourteenth Amendmentand an uncompensated, and so unconstitutional, regulatory
taking.The District Court dismissed the claims as unripe under
Williamson County Regional Planning Comm'n v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, 473 U. S. 172 (1985), on the
grounds that Del Monte Dunes had neither obtained a defin-itive decision as to the development the city would allow nor

sought just compensation in state court. The Court of Appeals reversed. 920 F. 2d 1496 (CA9 1990). After review-ing at some length the history of attempts to develop the

property, the court found that to require additional proposalswould implicate the concerns about repetitive and unfair procedures expressed in MacDonald, Sommer & Frates v. Yolo

526US3 Unit: $U61 [01-03-01 13:40:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN

699Cite as: 526 U. S. 687 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
County, 477 U. S. 340, 350, n. 7 (1986), and that the city's
decision was sufficiently final to render Del Monte Dunes'
claim ripe for review. 920 F. 2d, at 1501-1506. The court
also found that because the State of California had not provided a compensatory remedy for temporary regulatory takings when the city issued its final denial, see First English
Evangelical Lutheran Church of Glendale v. County of Los
Angeles, 482 U. S. 304 (1987), Del Monte Dunes was not required to pursue relief in state court as a precondition to
federal relief. See 920 F. 2d, at 1506-1507.

On remand, the District Court determined, over the city's
objections, to submit Del Monte Dunes' takings and equal
protection claims to a jury but to reserve the substantive
due process claim for decision by the court. Del Monte
Dunes argued to the jury that, although the city had a right
to regulate its property, the combined effect of the city's various demands--that the development be invisible from the
highway, that a buffer be provided between the development
and the state park, and that the public be provided with a
beach--was to force development into the "bowl" area of
the parcel. As a result, Del Monte Dunes argued, the city's
subsequent decision that the bowl contained sensitive
buckwheat habitat which could not be disturbed blocked
the development of any portion of the property. See 10
Tr. 1288-1294, 1299-1302, 1317 (Feb. 9, 1994). While conceding the legitimacy of the city's stated regulatory purposes,
Del Monte Dunes emphasized the tortuous and protracted
history of attempts to develop the property, as well as the
shifting and sometimes inconsistent positions taken by the
city throughout the process, and argued that it had been
treated in an unfair and irrational manner. Del Monte
Dunes also submitted evidence designed to undermine the
validity of the asserted factual premises for the city's denial
of the final proposal and to suggest that the city had considered buying, or inducing the State to buy, the property for

Opinion of the Court
public use as early as 1979, reserving some money for thispurpose but delaying or abandoning its plans for financial

reasons. See id., at 1303-1306. The State of California'spurchase of the property during the pendency of the litigation may have bolstered the credibility of Del Monte Dunes'position.

At the close of argument, the District Court instructed thejury it should find for Del Monte Dunes if it found either that
Del Monte Dunes had been denied all economically viableuse of its property or that "the city's decision to reject the
plaintiff 's 190 unit development proposal did not substan-tially advance a legitimate public purpose." App. 303.
With respect to the first inquiry, the jury was instructed, inrelevant part, as follows:

"For the purpose of a taking claim, you will find that theplaintiff has been denied all economically viable use of
its property, if, as the result of the city's regulatory deci-sion there remains no permissible or beneficial use for
that property. In proving whether the plaintiff hasbeen denied all economically viable use of its property,
it is not enough that the plaintiff show that after thechallenged action by the city the property diminished in
value or that it would suffer a serious economic loss asthe result of the city's actions."

Ibid.

With respect to the second inquiry, the jury received thefollowing instruction:

"Public bodies, such as the city, have the authorityto take actions which substantially advance legitimate
public interest[s] and legitimate public interest[s] caninclude protecting the environment, preserving open
space agriculture, protecting the health and safety of itscitizens, and regulating the quality of the community by
looking at development. So one of your jobs as jurorsis to decide if the city's decision here substantially advanced any such legitimate public purpose.

526US3 Unit: $U61 [01-03-01 13:40:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN

701Cite as: 526 U. S. 687 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
"The regulatory actions of the city or any agency sub-stantially advanc[e] a legitimate public purpose if the

action bears a reasonable relationship to that objective."Now, if the preponderance of the evidence establishes
that there was no reasonable relationship between thecity's denial of the . . . proposal and legitimate public
purpose, you should find in favor of the plaintiff. If youfind that there existed a reasonable relationship between the city's decision and a legitimate public purpose,you should find in favor of the city. As long as the regulatory action by the city substantially advances theirlegitimate public purpose, . . . its underlying motives
and reasons are not to be inquired into." Id., at 304.
The essence of these instructions was proposed by the city.See Tr. 11 (June 17, 1994).

The jury delivered a general verdict for Del Monte Duneson its takings claim, a separate verdict for Del Monte Dunes
on its equal protection claim, and a damages award of $1.45million. Tr. 2 (Feb. 17, 1994). After the jury's verdict, the
District Court ruled for the city on the substantive due proc-ess claim, stating that its ruling was not inconsistent with
the jury's verdict on the equal protection or the takingsclaim. App. to Pet. for Cert. A-39. The court later denied
the city's motions for a new trial or for judgment as a matterof law.

The Court of Appeals affirmed. 95 F. 3d 1422 (CA9 1996).The court first ruled that the District Court did not err in
allowing Del Monte Dunes' regulatory takings claim to betried to a jury, id., at 1428, because Del Monte Dunes had a
right to a jury trial under $ 1983, id., at 1426-1427, andwhether Del Monte Dunes had been denied all economically
viable use of the property and whether the city's denial ofthe final proposal substantially advanced legitimate public
interests were, on the facts of this case, questions suitablefor the jury,

id., at 1430. The court ruled that sufficient evi-dence had been presented to the jury from which it reason526US3 Unit: $U61 [01-03-01 13:40:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN
702 MONTEREY v. DEL MONTE DUNES AT MONTEREY, LTD.

Opinion of the Court
ably could have decided each of these questions in Del MonteDunes' favor. Id., at 1430-1434. Because upholding the

verdict on the regulatory takings claim was sufficient to sup-port the award of damages, the court did not address the
equal protection claim. Id., at 1426.The questions presented in the city's petition for certiorari
were (1) whether issues of liability were properly submittedto the jury on Del Monte Dunes' regulatory takings claim,
(2) whether the Court of Appeals impermissibly based itsdecision on a standard that allowed the jury to reweigh the
reasonableness of the city's land-use decisi on, and (3)whether the Court of Appeals erred in assuming that the
rough-proportionality standard of Dolan v. City of Tigard,512 U. S. 374 (1994), applied to this case. We granted certiorari, 523 U. S. 1045 (1998), and now address these questionsin reverse order.

II
In the course of holding a reasonable jury could have foundthe city's denial of the final proposal not substantially related

to legitimate public interests, the Court of Appeals stated:"Even if the City had a legitimate interest in denying Del
Monte's development application, its action must be `roughlyproportional' to furthering that interest. . . . That is, the
City's denial must be related `both in nature and extent tothe impact of the proposed development.' " 95 F. 3d, at 1430,
quoting Dolan, supra, at 391.Although in a general sense concerns for proportionality
animate the Takings Clause, see Armstrong v. United States,364 U. S. 40, 49 (1960) ("The Fifth Amendment's guarantee
. . . was designed to bar Government from forcing some peo-ple alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and
justice, should be borne by the public as a whole"), we havenot extended the rough-proportionality test of

Dolan beyondthe special context of exactions--land-use decisions conditioning approval of development on the dedication of prop-erty to public use. See Dolan, supra, at 385; Nollan v. Cali526US3 Unit: $U61 [01-03-01 13:40:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN

703Cite as: 526 U. S. 687 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
fornia Coastal Comm'n, 483 U. S. 825, 841 (1987). The ruleapplied in Dolan considers whether dedications demanded as

conditions of development are proportional to the develop-ment's anticipated impacts. It was not designed to address,
and is not readily applicable to, the much different questionsarising where, as here, the landowner's challenge is based
not on excessive exactions but on denial of development.We believe, accordingly, that the rough-proportionality test
of Dolan is inapposite to a case such as this one.The instructions given to the jury, however, did not mention proportionality, let alone require it to find for Del MonteDunes unless the city's actions were roughly proportional to
its asserted interests. The Court of Appeals' discussion ofrough proportionality, we conclude, was unnecessary to its
decision to sustain the jury's verdict. Although the courtstated that "[s]ignificant evidence supports Del Monte's claim
that the City's actions were disproportional to both the na-ture and extent of the impact of the proposed development,"
95 F. 3d, at 1432, it did so only after holding that

"Del Monte provided evidence sufficient to rebut each ofthese reasons [for denying the final proposal]. Taken

together, Del Monte argued that the City's reasons fordenying their application were invalid and that it unfairly intended to forestall any reasonable developmentof the Dunes. In light of the evidence proffered by Del
Monte, the City has incorrectly argued that no rationaljuror could conclude that the City's denial of Del Monte's
application lacked a sufficient nexus with its stated ob-jectives."

Id., at 1431-1432.

Given this holding, it was unnecessary for the Court ofAppeals to discuss rough proportionality. That it did so is

irrelevant to our disposition of the case.

III
The city challenges the Court of Appeals' holding that thejury could have found the city's denial of the final develop526US3 Unit: $U61 [01-03-01 13:40:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN
704 MONTEREY v. DEL MONTE DUNES AT MONTEREY, LTD.

Opinion of the Court
ment plan not reasonably related to legitimate public inter-ests. Although somewhat obscure, the city's argument is

not cast as a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence;rather, the city maintains that the Court of Appeals adopted
a legal standard for regulatory takings liability that allows
juries to second-guess public land-use policy.As the city itself proposed the essence of the instructions

given to the jury, it cannot now contend that the instructionsdid not provide an accurate statement of the law. In any
event, although this Court has provided neither a definitivestatement of the elements of a claim for a temporary regulatory taking nor a thorough explanation of the nature or applicability of the requirement that a regulation substantially
advance legitimate public interests outside the context of
required dedications or exactions, cf., e. g., Nollan, supra, at
834-835, n. 3, we note that the trial court's instructions are
consistent with our previous general discussions of regulatory takings liability. See Dolan, supra, at 385; Lucas v.
South Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U. S. 1003, 1016 (1992);
Yee v. Escondido, 503 U. S. 519, 534 (1992); Nollan, supra, at
834; Keystone Bituminous Coal Assn. v. DeBenedictis, 480
U. S. 470, 485 (1987); United States v. Riverside Bayview

Homes, Inc., 474 U. S. 121, 126 (1985); Agins v. City of Tiburon, 447 U. S. 255, 260 (1980). The city did not challenge
below the applicability or continued viability of the general
test for regulatory takings liability recited by these authorities and upon which the jury instructions appear to have
been modeled. Given the posture of the case before us, we
decline the suggestions of amici to revisit these precedents.

To the extent the city contends the judgment sustained by
the Court of Appeals was based upon a jury determination
of the reasonableness of its general zoning laws or land-use
policies, its argument can be squared with neither the instructions given to the jury nor the theory on which the case
was tried. The instructions did not ask the jury whether
the city's zoning ordinances or policies were unreasonable

Opinion of the Court
but only whether "the city's decision to reject the plaintiff 's190 unit development proposal did not substantially advance

a legitimate public purpose," App. 303, that is, whether"there was no reasonable relationship between the city's denial of the . . . proposal and legitimate public purpose," id.,
at 304. Furthermore, Del Monte Dunes' lawyers were ex-plicit in conceding that "[t]his case is not about the right of

a city, in this case the city of Monterey, to regulate land."10 Tr. 1286 (Feb. 9, 1994). See also

id., at 1287 (proposals
were made "keeping in mind various regulations and re-quirements, heights, setbacks, and densities and all that.

That's not what this case is about"); id., at 1287-1288 ("They
have the right to set height limits. They have the right to
talk about where they want access. That's not what this
case is about. We all accept that in today's society, cities
and counties can tell a land owner what to do to some reasonable extent with their property"). Though not presented for
review, Del Monte Dunes' equal protection argument that it
had received treatment inconsistent with zoning decisions
made in favor of owners of similar properties, and the jury's
verdict for Del Monte Dunes on this claim, confirm the understanding of the jury and Del Monte Dunes that the complaint was not about general laws or ordinances but about a
particular zoning decision.

The instructions regarding the city's decision also did not
allow the jury to consider the reasonableness, per se, of the
customized, ad hoc conditions imposed on the property's development, and Del Monte Dunes did not suggest otherwise.
On the contrary, Del Monte Dunes disclaimed this theory of
the case in express terms: "Del Monte Dunes partnership did
not file this lawsuit because they were complaining about
giving the public the beach, keeping it [the development] out
of the view shed, devoting and [giving] to the State all this
habitat area. One-third [of the] property is going to be

Opinion of the Court
1289 (conceding that the city may "ask an owner to give awaya third of the property without getting a dime in compensation for it and providing parking lots for the public and habi-tats for the butterfly, and boardwalks").

Rather, the jury was instructed to consider whether the
city's denial of the final proposal was reasonably related to alegitimate public purpose. Even with regard to this issue,

however, the jury was not given free rein to second-guessthe city's land-use policies. Rather, the jury was instructed,
in unmistakable terms, that the various purposes assertedby the city were legitimate public interests. See App. 304.

The jury, furthermore, was not asked to evaluate the city's
decision in isolation but rather in context, and, in particular,
in light of the tortuous and protracted history of attempts to
develop the property. See, e. g., 10 Tr. 1294-1295 (Feb. 9,
1994). Although Del Monte Dunes was allowed to introduce
evidence challenging the asserted factual bases for the city's
decision, it also highlighted the shifting nature of the city's
demands and the inconsistency of its decision with the recommendation of its professional staff, as well as with its previous decisions. See, e. g., id., at 1300. Del Monte Dunes
also introduced evidence of the city's longstanding interest
in acquiring the property for public use. See, e. g., id., at
1303-1306.

In short, the question submitted to the jury on this issue
was confined to whether, in light of all the history and the
context of the case, the city's particular decision to deny Del
Monte Dunes' final development proposal was reasonably related to the city's proffered justifications. This question was
couched, moreover, in an instruction that had been proposed
in essence by the city, and as to which the city made no
objection.

Thus, despite the protests of the city and its amici, it is
clear that the Court of Appeals did not adopt a rule of takings law allowing wholesale interference by judge or jury
with municipal land-use policies, laws, or routine regulatory

Opinion of the Court
decisions. To the extent the city argues that, as a matter of
law, its land-use decisions are immune from judicial scrutiny
under all circumstances, its position is contrary to settled
regulatory takings principles. We reject this claim of error.

IV
We next address whether it was proper for the District
Court to submit the question of liability on Del Monte Dunes'
regulatory takings claim to the jury. (Before the District
Court, the city agreed it was proper for the jury to assess
damages. See Supplemental Memorandum of Petitioner Re:
Court/Jury Trial Issues in No. C86-5042 (ND Cal.), p. 2, Record, Doc. No. 111.) As the Court of Appeals recognized, the
answer depends on whether Del Monte Dunes had a statutory or constitutional right to a jury trial, and, if it did, the
nature and extent of the right. Del Monte Dunes asserts
the right to a jury trial is conferred by $ 1983 and by the
Seventh Amendment.

Under our precedents, "[b]efore inquiring into the applicability of the Seventh Amendment, we must `first ascertain
whether a construction of the statute is fairly possible by
which the [constitutional] question may be avoided.' " Feltner v. Columbia Pictures Television, Inc., 523 U. S. 340, 345
(1998) (quoting Tull v. United States, 481 U. S. 412, 417, n. 3
(1987)); accord, Curtis v. Loether, 415 U. S. 189, 192, n. 6
(1974).

The character of $ 1983 is vital to our Seventh Amendment
analysis, but the statute does not itself confer the jury right.
See Feltner, supra, at 345 ("[W]e cannot discern `any congressional intent to grant . . . the right to a jury trial' " (quoting Tull, supra, at 417, n. 3)). Section 1983 authorizes a
party who has been deprived of a federal right under the
color of state law to seek relief through "an action at law,
suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress." Del
Monte Dunes contends that the phrase "action at law" is a

Opinion of the Court
term of art implying a right to a jury trial. We disagree,for this is not a necessary implication.

In Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U. S. 575, 583 (1978), we found astatutory right to a jury trial in part because the statute
authorized "legal . . . relief." Our decision, however, did notrest solely on the statute's use of the phrase but relied as
well on the statute's explicit incorporation of the proceduresof the Fair Labor Standards Act, which had been interpreted
to guarantee trial by jury in private actions. Id., at 580.We decline, accordingly, to find a statutory jury right under

$ 1983 based solely on the authorization of "an action at law."As a consequence, we must reach the constitutional question. The Seventh Amendment provides that "[i]n Suits atcommon law, where the value in controversy shall exceed
twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall bepreserved . . . ." Consistent with the textual mandate that
the jury right be preserved, our interpretation of theAmendment has been guided by historical analysis comprising two principal inquiries. "[W]e ask, first, whether we aredealing with a cause of action that either was tried at law at
the time of the founding or is at least analogous to one thatwas."

Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., 517 U. S.370, 376 (1996). "If the action in question belongs in the law

category, we then ask whether the particular trial decisionmust fall to the jury in order to preserve the substance of
the common-law right as it existed in 1791." Ibid.

A
With respect to the first inquiry, we have recognized that"suits at common law" include "not merely suits, which the

common law recognized among its old and settled proceed-ings, but [also] suits in which legal rights were to be ascertained and determined, in contradistinction to those whereequitable rights alone were recognized, and equitable remedies were administered." Parsons v. Bedford, 3 Pet. 433,447 (1830). The Seventh Amendment thus applies not only

to common-law causes of action but also to statutory causesof action " `analogous to common-law causes of action ordinarily decided in English law courts in the late 18th century,as opposed to those customarily heard by courts of equity or
admiralty.' " Feltner, supra, at 348 (quoting Granfinanciera, S. A. v. Nordberg, 492 U. S. 33, 42 (1989)); accord, Cur-tis, supra, at 193.

Del Monte Dunes brought this suit pursuant to $ 1983 tovindicate its constitutional rights. We hold that a $ 1983 suit

seeking legal relief is an action at law within the meaning ofthe Seventh Amendment.

Justice Scalia's opinion concur-ring in part and concurring in the judgment presents a comprehensive and convincing analysis of the historical and con-stitutional reasons for this conclusion. We agree with his
analysis and conclusion.It is undisputed that when the Seventh Amendment was
adopted there was no action equivalent to $ 1983, framed inspecific terms for vindicating constitutional rights. It is settled law, however, that the Seventh Amendment jury guar-antee extends to statutory claims unknown to the common
law, so long as the claims can be said to "soun[d] basically intort," and seek legal relief.

Curtis, supra, at 195-196.As
Justice Scalia explains, see post, at 727-731, therecan be no doubt that claims brought pursuant to $ 1983 sound

in tort. Just as common-law tort actions provide redress forinterference with protected personal or property interests,

$ 1983 provides relief for invasions of rights protected underfederal law. Recognizing the essential character of the statute, " `[w]e have repeatedly noted that 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 cre-ates a species of tort liability,' "

Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U. S.477, 483 (1994) (quoting Memphis Community School Dist.

v. Stachura, 477 U. S. 299, 305 (1986)), and have interpretedthe statute in light of the "background of tort liability," Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167, 187 (1961) (overruled on othergrounds, Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs., 436

Opinion of the Court
U. S. 658 (1978)); accord, Heck, supra, at 483. Our settledunderstanding of $ 1983 and the Seventh Amendment thus

compel the conclusion that a suit for legal relief broughtunder the statute is an action at law.

Here Del Monte Dunes sought legal relief. It was entitled
to proceed in federal court under $ 1983 because, at the timeof the city's actions, the State of California did not provide

a compensatory remedy for temporary regulatory takings.See

First English, 482 U. S., at 308-311. The constitutional
injury alleged, therefore, is not that property was taken butthat it was taken without just compensation. Had the city

paid for the property or had an adequate postdeprivation
remedy been available, Del Monte Dunes would have suffered no constitutional injury from the taking alone. See
Williamson, 473 U. S., at 194-195. Because its statutory action did not accrue until it was denied just compensation, in
a strict sense Del Monte Dunes sought not just compensation
per se but rather damages for the unconstitutional denial of
such compensation. Damages for a constitutional violation
are a legal remedy. See, e. g., Teamsters v. Terry, 494 U. S.
558, 570 (1990) ("Generally, an action for money damages was
`the traditional form of relief offered in the courts of law' ")
(quoting Curtis, 415 U. S., at 196).

Even when viewed as a simple suit for just compensation,
we believe Del Monte Dunes' action sought essentially legal
relief. "We have recognized the `general rule' that monetary relief is legal." Feltner, 523 U. S., at 352 (quoting
Teamsters v. Terry, supra, at 570). Just compensation,
moreover, differs from equitable restitution and other monetary remedies available in equity, for in determining just
compensation, "the question is what has the owner lost, not
what has the taker gained." Boston Chamber of Commerce
v. Boston, 217 U. S. 189, 195 (1910). As its name suggests,
then, just compensation is, like ordinary money damages, a
compensatory remedy. The Court has recognized that compensation is a purpose "traditionally associated with legal

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
relief." Feltner, supra, at 352. Because Del Monte Dunes'statutory suit sounded in tort and sought legal relief, it was

an action at law. 2

In an attempt to avoid the force of this conclusion, the cityurges us to look not to the statutory basis of Del Monte
Dunes' claim but rather to the underlying constitutionalright asserted. At the very least, the city asks us to create
an exception to the general Seventh Amendment rule gov-erning $ 1983 actions for claims alleging violations of the
Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment. See New Port
Largo, Inc. v. Monroe County, 95 F. 3d 1084 (CA11 1996)(finding, in tension with the Ninth Circuit's decision in this

case, that there is no right to a jury trial on a takings claimbrought under $ 1983). Because the jury's role in estimating
just compensation in condemnation proceedings was incon-sistent and unclear at the time the Seventh Amendment was
adopted, this Court has said "that there is no constitutionalright to a jury in eminent domain proceedings."

UnitedStates v. Reynolds, 397 U. S. 14, 18 (1970); accord, Bauman

v. Ross, 167 U. S. 548, 593 (1897). The city submits that theanalogy to formal condemnation proceedings is controlling,
so that there is no jury right here.As

Justice Scalia notes, see post, at 724-726, we havedeclined in other contexts to classify $ 1983 actions based

on the nature of the underlying right asserted, and thecity provides no persuasive justification for adopting a different rule for Seventh Amendment purposes. Even whenanalyzed not as a $ 1983 action simpliciter, however, but as
a $ 1983 action seeking redress for an uncompensated taking,Del Monte Dunes' suit remains an action at law.

Although condemnation proceedings spring from the sameFifth Amendment right to compensation which, as incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment, is applicable here, see
First English, supra, at 315 (citing Jacobs v. United States,290 U. S. 13, 16 (1933)), a condemnation action differs in im526US3 Unit: $U61 [01-03-01 13:40:33] PAGES PGT: OPIN
712 MONTEREY v. DEL MONTE DUNES AT MONTEREY, LTD.

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
portant respects from a $ 1983 action to redress an uncom-pensated taking. Most important, when the government

initiates condemnation proceedings, it concedes the landown-er's right to receive just compensation and seeks a mere determination of the amount of compensation due. Liability
simply is not an issue. As a result, even if condemnationproceedings were an appropriate analogy, condemnation

practice would provide little guidance on the specific ques-tion whether Del Monte Dunes was entitled to a jury determination of liability.This difference renders the analogy to condemnation proceedings not only unhelpful but also inapposite. When the
government takes property without initiating condemnation
proceedings, it "shifts to the landowner the burden to discover the encroachment and to take affirmative action to recover just compensation." United States v. Clarke, 445
U. S. 253, 257 (1980). Even when the government does not
dispute its seizure of the property or its obligation to pay for
it, the mere "shifting of the initiative from the condemning
authority to the condemnee" can place the landowner "at a
significant disadvantage." Id., at 258; cf. id., at 255 ("There
are important legal and practical differences between an inverse condemnation suit and a condemnation proceeding");
84 Stat. 1906, $ 304, 42 U. S. C. $ 4654 (recognizing, at least
implicitly, the added burden by providing for recovery of attorney's fees in cases where the government seizes property
without initiating condemnation proceedings but not in ordinary condemnation cases). Where, as here, the government
not only denies liability but fails to provide an adequate postdeprivation remedy (thus refusing to submit the question of
liability to an impartial arbiter), the disadvantage to the
owner becomes all the greater. At least in these circumstances, the analogy to ordinary condemnation procedures is
simply untenable.

Our conclusion is confirmed by precedent. Early authority finding no jury right in a condemnation proceeding did so

526US3 Unit: $U61 [01-03-01 13:40:33] PAGES PGT: OPIN

713Cite as: 526 U. S. 687 (1999)
Opinion of Kennedy, J.
on the ground that condemnation did not involve the deter-mination of legal rights because liability was undisputed:

"We are therefore of opinion that the trial by jury ispreserved inviolate in the sense of the constitution,
when in all criminal cases, and in civil cases when a rightis in controversy in a court of law, it is secured to each
party. In cases of this description [condemnation pro-ceedings], the right to take, and the right to compensation, are admitted; the only question is the amount,which may be submitted to any impartial tribunal the
legislature may designate." Bonaparte v. Camden &
Amboy R. Co., 3 F. Cas. 821, 829 (No. 1,617) (CC NJ1830) (Baldwin, Circuit Justice).

(Although Justice Souter's opinion concurring in part
and dissenting in part takes issue with this distinction, its
arguments are unpersuasive. First, it correctly notes thatwhen the government initiates formal condemnation procedures, a landowner may question whether the proposed tak-ing is for public use. The landowner who raises this issue,
however, seeks not to establish the government's liability fordamages, but to prevent the government from taking his
property at all. As the dissent recognizes, the relief desiredby a landowner making this contention is analogous not to
damages but to an injunction; it should be no surprise, then,
that the landowner is not entitled to a jury trial on his enti-tlement to a remedy that sounds not in law but in equity.

Second, the dissent refers to "the diversity of rationales un-derlying early state cases in which the right of a direct condemnee to a jury trial was considered and denied." Post, at
742. The dissent mentions only the rationale that because
the government is immune from suit for damages, it can
qualify any remedy it provides by dispensing with the right
to a jury trial. The cases cited for this proposition--two
state-court cases antedating the adoption of the Fourteenth
Amendment and an off-point federal case--do not implicate

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
the Fifth Amendment. Even if the sovereign immunity ra-tionale retains its vitality in cases where this Amendment is

applicable, cf. First English, 482 U. S., at 316, n. 9, it is nei-ther limited to nor coextensive with takings claims. Rather,
it would apply to all constitutional suits against the Federal
Government or the States, but not to constitutional suitssuch as this one against municipalities like the city of Monterey. Third, the dissent contends that the distinction wehave drawn is absent from our condemnation cases. Even
if this were true--and it is not obvious that it is--equallyabsent from those decisions is any analysis or principle that
would extend beyond the narrow context of direct condemnation suits to actions such as this one. Rather, as apparent
even from the passages quoted by the dissent, see post, at
736-739, and n. 1, these cases rely only on the Court's perception of historical English and colonial practice in direct
condemnation cases. Nothing in these cases detracts from
the authorities cited in this opinion that do support the
distinction we draw between direct condemnation and a
suit like this one. Finally, the existence of a different historical practice distinguishes direct condemnation from an
ordinary tort case in which the defendant concedes liability.
See post, at 742-743, n. 5.)

Condemnation proceedings differ from the instant cause of
action in another fundamental respect as well. When the
government condemns property for public use, it provides
the landowner a forum for seeking just compensation, as is
required by the Constitution. See First English, supra, at
316. If the condemnation proceedings do not, in fact, deny
the landowner just compensation, the government's actions
are neither unconstitutional nor unlawful. See Williamson,
473 U. S., at 194 ("The Fifth Amendment does not proscribe
the taking of property; it proscribes taking without just compensation"). Even when the government takes property
without initiating condemnation proceedings, there is no constitutional violation " `unless or until the state fails to pro526US3 Unit: $U61 [01-03-01 13:40:33] PAGES PGT: OPIN

vide an adequate postdeprivation remedy for the propertyloss.' "

Id., at 195 (quoting Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U. S. 517,
532, n. 12 (1984)). In this case, however, Del Monte Duneswas denied not only its property but also just compensation

or even an adequate forum for seeking it. That is the gravamen of the $ 1983 claim.In these circumstances, we conclude the cause of action

sounds in tort and is most analogous to the various actionsthat lay at common law to recover damages for interference
with property interests. Our conclusion is consistent withthe original understanding of the Takings Clause and with
historical practice.

Early opinions, nearly contemporaneous with the adoption
of the Bill of Rights, suggested that when the government
took property but failed to provide a means for obtaining
just compensation, an action to recover damages for the government's actions would sound in tort. See, e. g., Lindsay v.
Commissioners, 2 Bay 38, 61 (S. C. 1796) (opinion of Waties,
J.) ("But suppose they could sue, what would be the nature
of the action? It could not be founded on contract, for there
was none. It must then be on a tort; it must be an action of
trespass, in which the jury would give a reparation in damages. Is not this acknowledging that the act of the legislature [in authorizing uncompensated takings] is a tortious
act?" (emphases in original)); Gardner v. Village of Newburgh, 2 Johns. Ch. 162, 164, 166 (N. Y. 1816) (Kent, Ch.)
(uncompensated governmental interference with property
right would support a tort action at law for nuisance).

Consistent with this understanding, and as a matter of historical practice, when the government has taken property
without providing an adequate means for obtaining redress,
suits to recover just compensation have been framed as
common-law tort actions. See, e. g., Richards v. Washington Terminal Co., 233 U. S. 546 (1914) (nuisance); Pumpelly
v. Green Bay Co., 13 Wall. 166 (1872) (trespass on the case);

(1833) (unspecified tort); Bradshaw v. Rodgers, 20 Johns. 103(N. Y. 1822) (trespass). Tort actions of these descriptions

lay at common law, 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on theLaws of England, ch. 12 (1768) (trespass; trespass on the
case); id., ch. 13 (trespass on the case for nuisance), and in
these actions, as in other suits at common law, there was aright to trial by jury, see,

e. g., Feltner, 523 U. S., at 349 ("Actions on the case, like other actions at law, were tried be-fore juries").

(Justice Souter's criticism of our reliance on these earlyauthorities misses the point of our analysis. We do not contend that the landowners were always successful. As the
dissent makes clear, prior to the adoption of the Fourteenth
Amendment and the concomitant incorporation of the Takings Clause against the States, a variety of obstacles--including various traditional immunities, the lack of a constitutional right, and the resulting possibility of legislative
justification--stood in the way of the landowner who sought
redress for an uncompensated taking. Rather, our point is
that the suits were attempted and were understood to sound
in tort. It is therefore ironic that the dissent invokes a law
review article discussing such suits entitled "The First Constitutional Tort: The Remedial Revolution in NineteenthCentury State Just Compensation Law." Post, at 746-747
(citing Brauneis, 52 Vand. L. Rev. 57 (1999)). It is true, as
the dissenting opinion observes, that claims for just compensation were sometimes brought in quasi contract rather than
tort. See, e. g., United States v. Lynah, 188 U. S. 445, 458-
465 (1903) (overruled on other grounds, United States v. Chicago, M., St. P. & P. R. Co., 312 U. S. 592 (1941)) (comparing
claims for just compensation brought in quasi contract with
just-compensation claims brought in tort). The historical
existence of quasi-contract suits for just compensation does
nothing to undermine our Seventh Amendment analysis,
however, since quasi contract was frequently available to the
victim of a tort who elected to waive the tort and proceed

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
instead in quasi contract. See, e. g., W. Prosser, Law of
Torts $ 110, pp. 1118-1127 (1941). In any event, quasi contract was itself an action at law. See, e. g., 1 G. Palmer, Restitution $$ 1.2, 2.2-2.3 (1978); F. Woodward, Quasi Contracts

$ 6 (1913).)

The city argues that because the Constitution allows the
government to take property for public use, a taking for that
purpose cannot be tortious or unlawful. We reject this conclusion. Although the government acts lawfully when, pursuant to proper authorization, it takes property and provides
just compensation, the government's action is lawful solely
because it assumes a duty, imposed by the Constitution, to
provide just compensation. See First English, 482 U. S., at
315 (citing Jacobs, 290 U. S., at 16). When the government
repudiates this duty, either by denying just compensation
in fact or by refusing to provide procedures through which
compensation may be sought, it violates the Constitution.
In those circumstances the government's actions are not only
unconstitutional but unlawful and tortious as well. See
Gardner v. Village of Newburgh, supra, at 166, 168 ("[T]o
render the exercise of the [eminent domain] power valid,"
the government must provide landowner "fair compensation"; "[u]ntil, then, some provision be made for affording him
compensation, it would be unjust, and contrary to the first
principles of government," to deprive plaintiff of his property rights; absent such a provision, the plaintiff "would be
entitled to his action at law for the interruption of his right");
Beatty v. United States, 203 F. 620, 626 (CA4 1913) ("The
taking of property by condemnation under the power of eminent domain is compulsory. The party is deprived of his
property against his will. It is in effect a lawful trespass
committed by the sovereign, and lawful only on the condition
that the damages inflicted by the trespass are paid to the
injured party. The analogy to a suit at common law for trespass is close and complete").

718 MONTEREY v. DEL MONTE DUNES AT MONTEREY, LTD.

Opinion of the Court
(The argument that an uncompensated taking is not tortious because the landowner seeks just compensation rather
than additional damages for the deprivation of a remedy reveals the same misunderstanding. Simply put, there is no
constitutional or tortious injury until the landowner is denied
just compensation. That the damages to which the landowner is entitled for this injury are measured by the just
compensation he has been denied is neither surprising nor
significant.)

B

Having decided Del Monte Dunes' $ 1983 suit was an action
at law, we must determine whether the particular issues of
liability were proper for determination by the jury. See
Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., 517 U. S. 370
(1996). In actions at law, issues that are proper for the jury
must be submitted to it "to preserve the right to a jury's
resolution of the ultimate dispute," as guaranteed by the
Seventh Amendment. Id., at 377. We determine whether
issues are proper for the jury, when possible, "by using the
historical method, much as we do in characterizing the suits
and actions within which [the issues] arise." Id., at 378.
We look to history to determine whether the particular issues, or analogous ones, were decided by judge or by jury in
suits at common law at the time the Seventh Amendment
was adopted. Where history does not provide a clear answer, we look to precedent and functional considerations.
Id., at 384.

Just as no exact analogue of Del Monte Dunes' $ 1983 suit
can be identified at common law, so also can we find no precise analogue for the specific test of liability submitted to the
jury in this case. We do know that in suits sounding in tort
for money damages, questions of liability were decided by
the jury, rather than the judge, in most cases. This allocation preserved the jury's role in resolving what was often

Opinion of the Court
the heart of the dispute between plaintiff and defendant.Although these general observations provide some guidance

on the proper allocation between judge and jury of the liabil-ity issues in this case, they do not establish a definitive
answer. 2

We look next to our existing precedents. Although thisCourt has decided many regulatory takings cases, none of
our decisions has addressed the proper allocation of liabilitydeterminations between judge and jury in explicit terms.
This is not surprising. Most of our regulatory takings deci-sions have reviewed suits against the United States, see,
e. g., United States v. Riverside Bayview Homes, Inc., 474U. S. 121 (1985);

Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Recla-mation Assn., Inc., 452 U. S. 264 (1981), suits decided by

state courts, see, e. g., Dolan v. City of Tigard, 512 U. S. 374(1994);

In Williamson, we did review a regulatory takings casein which the plaintiff landowner sued a county planning commission in federal court for money damages under $ 1983.473 U. S., at 182. Whether the commission had denied the
plaintiff all economically viable use of the property had beensubmitted to the jury.

Id., at 191-192, and n. 12. Althoughthe Court did not consider the point, it assumed the propriety of this procedure. E. g., id., at 191 ("It is not clearwhether the jury would have found that the respondent had

Opinion of the Court
been denied all reasonable beneficial use of the property hadany of the eight objections been met through the grant of a

variance. . . . Accordingly, until the Commission determinesthat no variances will be granted, it is impossible for the jury
to find, on this record, whether respondent `will be unable toderive economic benefit' from the land").

Williamson is not a direct holding, however, and we mustlook for further guidance. We turn next to considerations
of process and function. 3

In actions at law predominantly factual issues are in mostcases allocated to the jury. See

Baltimore & Carolina Line,Inc. v. Redman, 295 U. S. 654, 657 (1935). The allocation

rests on a firm historical foundation, see, e. g., 1 E. Coke,Institutes 155b (1628) ("ad quaestionem facti non respondent judices; ad quaestionem juris non respondent juratores"), and serves "to preserve the right to a jury's resolu-tion of the ultimate dispute," Markman, supra, at 377.

Almost from the inception of our regulatory takings doc-trine, we have held that whether a regulation of property
goes so far that "there must be an exercise of eminent do-main and compensation to sustain the act . . . depends upon
the particular facts." Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260U. S. 393, 413 (1922); accord,

Keystone Bituminous Coal,supra, at 473-474. Consistent with this understanding, we

have described determinations of liability in regulatory tak-ings cases as " `essentially ad hoc, factual inquiries,' " Lucas,
supra, at 1015 (quoting Penn Central Transp. Co. v. NewYork City, 438 U. S. 104, 124 (1978)), requiring "complex
factual assessments of the purposes and economic effects ofgovernment actions,"

Yee, 503 U. S., at 523.In accordance with these pronouncements, we hold that

the issue whether a landowner has been deprived of all eco-nomically viable use of his property is a predominantly factual question. As our implied acknowledgment of the pro-cedure in Williamson, supra, suggests, in actions at law

Opinion of the Court
otherwise within the purview of the Seventh Amendment,this question is for the jury.

The jury's role in determining whether a land-use decisionsubstantially advances legitimate public interests within the
meaning of our regulatory takings doctrine presents a moredifficult question. Although our cases make clear that this
inquiry involves an essential factual component, see Yee,
supra, at 523, it no doubt has a legal aspect as well, and isprobably best understood as a mixed question of fact and law.

In this case, the narrow question submitted to the jurywas whether, when viewed in light of the context and protracted history of the development application process, thecity's decision to reject a particular development plan bore a
reasonable relationship to its proffered justifications. SeePart III,

supra. As the Court of Appeals recognized, thisquestion was "essentially fact-bound [in] nature." 95 F. 3d,

at 1430 (internal quotation marks omitted) (alteration byCourt of Appeals). Under these circumstances, we hold that
it was proper to submit this narrow, fact-bound question tothe jury.

C
We note the limitations of our Seventh Amendment hold-ing. We do not address the jury's role in an ordinary inverse

condemnation suit. The action here was brought under$ 1983, a context in which the jury's role in vindicating constitutional rights has long been recognized by the federalcourts. A federal court, moreover, cannot entertain a takings claim under $ 1983 unless or until the complaining land-owner has been denied an adequate postdeprivation remedy.
Even the State of California, where this suit arose, now pro-vides a facially adequate procedure for obtaining just compensation for temporary takings such as this one. Our de-cision is also circumscribed in its conceptual reach. The
posture of the case does not present an appropriate occasionto define with precision the elements of a temporary regulatory takings claim; although the city objected to submitting

Opinion of the Court
issues of liability to the jury at all, it approved the instruc-tions that were submitted to the jury and therefore has no

basis to challenge them.For these reasons, we do not attempt a precise demarcation of the respective provinces of judge and jury in determining whether a zoning decision substantially advances le-gitimate governmental interests. The city and its

amici
suggest that sustaining the judgment here will underminethe uniformity of the law and eviscerate state and local zoning authority by subjecting all land-use decisions to plenary,and potentially inconsistent, jury review. Our decision
raises no such specter. Del Monte Dunes did not bring a
broad challenge to the constitutionality of the city's general
land-use ordinances or policies, and our holding does not extend to a challenge of that sort. In such a context, the determination whether the statutory purposes were legitimate,
or whether the purposes, though legitimate, were furthered
by the law or general policy, might well fall within the province of the judge. Nor was the gravamen of Del Monte
Dunes' complaint even that the city's general regulations
were unreasonable as applied to Del Monte Dunes' property;
we do not address the proper trial allocation of the various
questions that might arise in that context. Rather, to the
extent Del Monte Dunes' challenge was premised on unreasonable governmental action, the theory argued and tried to
the jury was that the city's denial of the final development
permit was inconsistent not only with the city's general ordinances and policies but even with the shifting ad hoc restrictions previously imposed by the city. Del Monte Dunes' argument, in short, was not that the city had followed its
zoning ordinances and policies but rather that it had not done
so. As is often true in $ 1983 actions, the disputed questions
were whether the government had denied a constitutional
right in acting outside the bounds of its authority, and, if so,
the extent of any resulting damages. These were questions
for the jury.

V
For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court ofAppeals is affirmed.

It is so ordered.
Justice Scalia, concurring in part and concurring in thejudgment.

I join all except Part IV-A-2 of Justice Kennedy's opin-ion. In my view, all $ 1983 actions must be treated alike
insofar as the Seventh Amendment right to jury trial isconcerned; that right exists when monetary damages are
sought; and the issues submitted to the jury in the presentcase were properly sent there.

I
Revised Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, creates a duty torefrain from interference with the federal rights of others,

and provides money damages and injunctive relief for viola-tion of that duty. Since the statute itself confers no right to
jury trial, such a right is to be found, if at all, in the applica-tion to $ 1983 of the Seventh Amendment, which guarantees
a jury "[i]n Suits at common law, where the value in con-troversy shall exceed twenty dollars." In determining
whether a particular cause of action is a "[s]ui[t] at commonlaw" within the meaning of this provision, we must examine
whether it was tried at law in 1791 or is analogous to such acause, see, e. g., Granfinanciera, S. A. v. Nordberg, 492 U. S.
33, 42 (1989), and whether it seeks relief that is legal or equi-table in nature, see, e. g., Tull v. United States, 481 U. S. 412,
421 (1987).The fundamental difference between my view of this case
and Justice Souter's is that I believe $ 1983 establishes aunique, or at least distinctive, cause of action, in that the
legal duty which is the basis for relief is ultimately definednot by the claim-creating statute itself, but by an extrinsic
body of law to which the statute refers, namely, "federal

rights elsewhere conferred." Baker v. McCollan, 443 U. S.137, 144, n. 3 (1979). In this respect $ 1983 is, so to speak, a

prism through which many different lights may pass. Un-like

Justice Souter, I believe that, in analyzing this cause
of action for Seventh Amendment purposes, the proper focus
is on the prism itself, not on the particular ray that happensto be passing through in the present case.

The Seventh Amendment inquiry looks first to the "natureof the statutory action."

Feltner v. Columbia Pictures Television, Inc., 523 U. S. 340, 348 (1998). The only "statutoryaction" here is a $ 1983 suit. The question before us, therefore, is not what common-law action is most analogous to
some generic suit seeking compensation for a Fifth Amendment taking, but what common-law action is most analogous
to a $ 1983 claim. The fact that the breach of duty which
underlies the particular $ 1983 claim at issue here--a Fifth
Amendment takings violation--may give rise to another
cause of action besides a $ 1983 claim, namely, a so-called
inverse condemnation suit, which is (according to Part IV-
A-2 of Justice Kennedy's opinion) or is not (according to
Justice Souter's opinion) entitled to be tried before a jury,
seems to me irrelevant. The central question remains
whether a $ 1983 suit is entitled to a jury. The fortuitous
existence of an inverse-condemnation cause of action is
surely not essential to the existence of the $ 1983 claim. Indeed, for almost all $ 1983 claims arising out of constitutional
violations, no alternative private cause of action does exist--
which makes it practically useful, in addition to being theoretically sound, to focus on the prism instead of the refracted light.

This is exactly the approach we took in Wilson v. Garcia,
471 U. S. 261 (1985)--an opinion whose analysis is so precisely in point that it gives this case a distinct quality of
de'ja` vu. Wilson required us to analogize $ 1983 actions to
common-law suits for a different purpose: not to determine
applicability of the jury-trial right, but to identify the rele526US3 Unit: $U61 [01-03-01 13:40:33] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of Scalia, J.
vant statute of limitations. Since no federal limitationsperiod was provided, the Court had to apply 42 U. S. C.

$ 1988(a), which stated that, in the event a federal civil rightsstatute is "deficient in the provisions necessary to furnish
suitable remedies and punish offenses against law, the com-mon law, as modified and changed by the constitution and
statutes of the State wherein the court having jurisdictionof such civil or criminal cause is held, so far as the same is
not inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the UnitedStates, shall be extended to and govern the [federal] courts
in the trial and disposition of the cause . . . ." In applyingthis provision, the Court identified as one of the steps necessary for its analysis resolution of precisely the question Ihave been discussing here: "[W]e must . . . decide whether
all $ 1983 claims should be characterized in the same way, orwhether they should be evaluated differently depending
upon the varying factual circumstances and legal theoriespresented in each individual case." 471 U. S., at 268. The
Court concluded (as I do here) that all $ 1983 claims shouldbe characterized in the same way. It said (as I have) that

$ 1983 was "a uniquely federal remedy," and that it is "thepurest coincidence . . . when state statutes or the common
law provide for equivalent remedies; any analogies to thosecauses of action are bound to be imperfect."

Id., at 271-272(citations, footnotes, and internal quotation marks omitted).

And the Court was affected (as I am here) by the practicaldifficulties of the other course, which it described as follows:

"Almost every $ 1983 claim can be favorably analogizedto more than one of the ancient common-law forms of
action, each of which may be governed by a differentstatute of limitations. . . .

"A catalog of . . . constitutional claims that have beenalleged under $ 1983 would encompass numerous and diverse topics and subtopics: discrimination in public em-ployment on the basis of race or the exercise of First
Amendment rights, discharge or demotion without pro526US3 Unit: $U61 [01-03-01 13:40:33] PAGES PGT: OPIN

cedural due process, mistreatment of schoolchildren, de-liberate indifference to the medical needs of prison inmates, the seizure of chattels without advance notice orsufficient opportunity to be heard--to identify only a
few." Id., at 272-273 (footnotes omitted).
For these reasons the Court concluded that all $ 1983 actionsshould be characterized as "tort action[s] for the recovery of

damages for personal injuries." Id., at 276.To be sure, $ 1988 is not the Seventh Amendment. It is
entirely possible to analogize $ 1983 to the "common law" inone fashion for purposes of that statute, and in another fashion for purposes of the constitutional guarantee. But I can-not imagine why one would want to do that. For both purposes it is a "unique federal remedy" whose character isdetermined by the federal cause of action, and not by the
innumerable constitutional and statutory violations uponwhich that cause of action is dependent. And for both purposes the search for (often nonexistent) common-law ana-logues to remedies for those particular violations is a major
headache. Surely, the burden should be upon Justice Souter to explain why a different approach is appropriate inthe present context. I adhere to the approach of Wilson,

reaffirmed and refined in Owens v. Okure, 488 U. S. 235(1989), that a $ 1983 action is a $ 1983 action.

1

1 Justice Souter properly notes that "trial by jury is not a uniform
feature of $ 1983 actions." Post, at 751. This does not lead, however, to
his desired conclusion that all $ 1983 actions can therefore not properly be
analogized to tort claims. Post, at 740, 750-752. Before the merger of
law and equity, a contested right would have to be established at law
before relief could be obtained in equity. Thus, a suit in equity to enjoin an alleged nuisance could not be brought until a tort action at law
established the right to relief. See 1 J. High, Law of Injunctions 476-477
(2d ed. 1880). Since the merger of law and equity, any type of relief,
including purely equitable relief, can be sought in a tort suit--so that I can
file a tort action seeking only an injunction against a nuisance. If I should
do so, the fact that I seek only equitable relief would disentitle me to a
jury, see, e. g., Curtis v. Loether, 415 U. S. 189, 198 (1974); Dairy Queen,

Opinion of Scalia, J.

II
To apply this methodology to the present case: There is no
doubt that the cause of action created by $ 1983 is, and wasalways regarded as, a tort claim. Thomas Cooley's treatise

on tort law, which was published roughly contemporaneouslywith the enactment of $ 1983, tracked Blackstone's view, see
3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 115-119 (1768), that torts are remedies for invasions of certain
rights, such as the rights to personal security, personal lib-erty, and property. T. Cooley, Law of Torts 2-3 (1880).
Section 1983 assuredly fits that description. Like other tort
causes of action, it is designed to provide compensation for
injuries arising from the violation of legal duties, see Carey
v. Piphus, 435 U. S. 247, 254 (1978), and thereby, of course,
to deter future violations.

This Court has confirmed in countless cases that a $ 1983
cause of action sounds in tort. We have stated repeatedly
that $ 1983 "creates a species of tort liability," Imbler v.
Pachtman, 424 U. S. 409, 417 (1976); see also Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U. S. 477, 483 (1994); Memphis Community
School Dist. v. Stachura, 477 U. S. 299, 305 (1986); Smith v.
Wade, 461 U. S. 30, 34 (1983); Carey, supra, at 253; Hague v.
Committee for Industrial Organization, 307 U. S. 496, 507
(1939) (opinion of Roberts, J.) (describing a claim brought
under a predecessor of $ 1983 as seeking relief for "tortious
invasions of alleged civil rights by persons acting under color

Inc. v. Wood, 369 U. S. 469, 471 (1962); Parsons v. Bedford, 3 Pet. 433,
446-447 (1830); E. Re & J. Re, Cases and Materials on Remedies 46 (4th
ed. 1996)--but that would not render the nuisance suit any less a tort suit,
so that if damages were sought a jury would be required. So also here:
Some $ 1983 suits do not require a jury because only equitable relief is
sought. But since they are tort suits, when damages are requested, as
they are in the present case, a jury must be provided. Thus, the relief
sought is an important consideration in the Seventh Amendment inquiry,
but contrary to Justice Souter's belief it is a consideration separate from
the determination of the analogous common-law cause of action.

of state authority"). We have commonly described it as creating a "constitutional tort," since violations of constitutional
rights have been the most frequently litigated claims. See
Crawford-El v. Britton, 523 U. S. 574, 600-601 (1998); Jefferson v. City of Tarrant, 522 U. S. 75, 78-79 (1997); McMillian
v. Monroe County, 520 U. S. 781, 784 (1997); Richardson v.
McKnight, 521 U. S. 399, 401 (1997); Johnson v. Jones, 515
U. S. 304, 307 (1995); Albright v. Oliver, 510 U. S. 266, 269
(1994); Siegert v. Gilley, 500 U. S. 226, 231 (1991); St. Louis
v. Praprotnik, 485 U. S. 112, 121 (1988); Daniels v. Williams,
474 U. S. 327, 329 (1986); Memphis Community School Dist.,
supra, at 307; Smith, supra, at 35; Monell v. New York City
Dept. of Social Servs., 436 U. S. 658, 691 (1978). In Wilson
v. Garcia, we explicitly identified $ 1983 as a personal-injury
tort, stating that "[a] violation of [$ 1983] is an injury to the
individual rights of the person," and that "Congress unquestionably would have considered the remedies established in
the Civil Rights Act [of 1871] to be more analogous to tort
claims for personal injury than, for example, to claims for
damages to property or breach of contract." 471 U. S., at
277.

As described earlier, in Wilson, supra, and Okure, supra,
we used $ 1983's identity as a personal-injury tort to determine the relevant statute of limitations under 42 U. S. C.

$ 1988(a). We have also used $ 1983's character as a tort
cause of action to determine the scope of immunity, Kalina
v. Fletcher, 522 U. S. 118, 124-125 (1997), the recoverable
damages, Heck, supra, at 483; Memphis Community School
Dist., supra, at 305-306, and the scope of liability, Monroe v.
Pape, 365 U. S. 167, 187 (1961). In Owen v. Independence,
445 U. S. 622, 657 (1980), we even asserted that the attributes
of $ 1983 could change to keep up with modern developments
in the law of torts: "Doctrines of tort law have changed
significantly over the past century, and our notions of governmental responsibility should properly reflect that evo526US3 Unit: $U61 [01-03-01 13:40:33] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of Scalia, J.
lution. . . . [T]he principle of equitable loss-spreading has
joined fault as a factor in distributing the costs of official
misconduct."

The Seventh Amendment's right to jury trial attaches to
a statutory cause of action that, although unknown at common law, is analogous to common-law causes that were tried
before juries. See, e. g., Feltner v. Columbia Pictures Television, Inc., 523 U. S., at 347-348. The initial Seventh
Amendment question before us, therefore, is whether a tort
action seeking money damages was a "suit at common law"
for which a jury trial was provided. The answer is obviously yes. Common-law tort actions were brought under
the writs of trespass and trespass on the case. See generally S. Milsom, Historical Foundations of the Common Law
283-313 (2d ed. 1981). Trespass remedied direct, forcible
tortious injuries, while the later developed trespass on the
case remedied indirect or consequential harms. See, e. g.,
Dix, Origins of the Action of Trespass on the Case, 46 Yale
L. J. 1142, 1163 (1937); Krauss, Tort Law and Private Ordering, 35 St. Louis U. L. J. 623, 637, and n. 66 (1991). Claims
brought pursuant to these writs and seeking money damages
were triable to juries at common law. See, e. g., T. Plucknett, A Concise History of the Common Law 125, 348 (4th
ed. 1948); J. Baker, An Introduction to English Legal History
59 (2d ed. 1979). It is clear from our cases that a tort action
for money damages is entitled to jury trial under the Seventh
Amendment. See Curtis v. Loether, 415 U. S. 189, 195
(1974) (according jury trial because "[a] damages action
under [Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968] sounds
basically in tort--the statute merely defines a new legal
duty, and authorizes the courts to compensate a plaintiff for
the injury caused by the defendant's wrongful breach"); Pernell v. Southall Realty, 416 U. S. 363, 370 (1974) ("This Court
has long assumed that . . . actions for damages to a person
or property . . . are actions at law triable to a jury"); Ross v.

Bernhard, 396 U. S. 531, 533 (1970) ("The Seventh Amendment . . . entitle[s] the parties to a jury trial in actions for
damages to a person or property . . .").

A number of lower courts have held that a $ 1983 damages
action--without reference to what might have been the most
analogous common-law remedy for violation of the particular
federal right at issue--must be tried to a jury. See, e. g.,
Caban-Wheeler v. Elsea, 71 F. 3d 837, 844 (CA11 1996);
Perez-Serrano v. DeLeon-Velez, 868 F. 2d 30, 32-33 (CA1
1989); Laskaris v. Thornburgh, 733 F. 2d 260, 264 (CA3 1984);
Segarra v. McDade, 706 F. 2d 1301, 1304 (CA4 1983); Dolence
v. Flynn, 628 F. 2d 1280, 1282 (CA10 1980); Amburgey v.
Cassady, 507 F. 2d 728, 730 (CA6 1974); Brisk v. Miami
Beach, 726 F. Supp. 1305, 1311-1312 (SD Fla. 1989); Ruth
Anne M. v. Alvin Independent School Dist., 532 F. Supp.
460, 475 (SD Tex. 1982); Mason v. Melendez, 525 F. Supp.
270, 282 (WD Wis. 1981); Cook v. Cox, 357 F. Supp. 120, 124-
125, and n. 4 (ED Va. 1973).

In sum, it seems to me entirely clear that a $ 1983 cause of
action for damages is a tort action for which jury trial would
have been provided at common law. The right of jury trial
is not eliminated, of course, by virtue of the fact that, under
our modern unified system, the equitable relief of an injunction is also sought. See, e. g., Dairy Queen, Inc. v. Wood,
369 U. S. 469, 479 (1962); Scott v. Neely, 140 U. S. 106, 109-110
(1891). Nor--to revert to the point made in Part I of this
discussion--is the tort nature of the cause of action, and its
entitlement to jury trial, altered by the fact that another
cause of action was available (an inverse-condemnation suit)
to obtain the same relief. Even if that were an equitable
cause of action--or, as Justice Souter asserts, a peculiar
legal cause of action to which the right to jury trial did not
attach--the nature of the $ 1983 suit would no more be transformed by it than, for example, a common-law fraud action
would be deprived of the right to jury trial by the fact that

the defendant was a trustee who could, instead, have beensued for an equitable accounting.

III
To say that respondents had the right to a jury trial ontheir $ 1983 claim is not to say that they were entitled to

have the jury decide every issue. The precise scope of thejury's function is the second Seventh Amendment issue before us here--and there again, as we stated in Markman v.
Westview Instruments, Inc., 517 U. S. 370, 377 (1996), historyis our guide. I agree with the Court's methodology, see

ante, at 718-719, 720, which, in the absence of a precisehistorical analogue, recognizes the historical preference
for juries to make primarily factual determinations and forjudges to resolve legal questions. See Baltimore & Carolina Line, Inc. v. Redman, 295 U. S. 654, 657 (1935). Thatfact-law dichotomy is routinely applied by the lower courts
in deciding $ 1983 cases. For instance, in cases alleging re-taliatory discharge of a public employee in violation of the
First Amendment, judges determine whether the speechthat motivated the termination was constitutionally protected speech, while juries find whether the discharge wascaused by that speech. See,

e. g., Horstkoetter v. Department of Public Safety, 159 F. 3d 1265, 1271 (CA10 1998).And in cases asserting municipal liability for harm caused

by unconstitutional policies, judges determine whether thealleged policies were unconstitutional, while juries find
whether the policies in fact existed and whether they harmedthe plaintiff. See, e. g., Myers v. County of Orange, 157 F. 3d
66, 74-76 (CA2 1998), cert. denied, 525 U. S. 1146 (1999).In the present case, the question of liability for a Takings
Clause violation was given to the jury to determine by an-swering two questions: (1) whether respondents were deprived of "all economically viable use" of their property, and(2) whether petitioner's 1986 rejection of respondents' building plans "substantially advance[d] [a] legitimate public in526US3 Unit: $U61 [01-03-01 13:40:33] PAGES PGT: OPIN

teres[t]." Ante, at 701. I concur in the Court's assessmentthat the "economically viable use" issue presents primarily

a question of fact appropriate for consideration by a jury.Ante, at 720-721. The second question--whether the taking
"substantially advance[s] [a] legitimate public interes[t]" 2--seems to me to break down (insofar as is relevant to the
instructions here) into two subquestions: (1) Whether thegovernment's asserted basis for its challenged action represents a legitimate state interest. That was a question oflaw for the court. (2) Whether that legitimate state interest
is substantially furthered by the challenged government ac-tion. I agree with the Court that at least in the highly particularized context of the present case, involving the denialof a single application for stated reasons, that was a question
of fact for the jury. As the matter was put to the jury inthe present case, the first subquestion was properly removed
from the jury's cognizance: the court instructed that "legiti-mate public interest[s] can include protecting the environment, preserving open space agriculture, protecting thehealth and safety of its citizens, and regulating the quality
of the community by looking at development." App. 304.These included the only public interests asserted in the case.
The second subquestion, on the other hand, was properly leftto the jury: "[O]ne of your jobs as jurors is to decide if the
city's decision here substantially advanced any such legiti-mate public purpose."

Ibid.; see ante, at 721.

I conclude that the Seventh Amendment provides respond-ents with a right to a jury trial on their $ 1983 claim, and

that the trial court properly submitted the particular issuesraised by that $ 1983 claim to the jury. For these reasons,
I concur in the judgment and join all but Part IV-A-2 of
Justice Kennedy's opinion.

2 As the Court explains, petitioner forfeited any objection to this standard, see ante, at 704, and I express no view as to its propriety.

Justice Souter, with whom Justice O'Connor, Justice
Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer join, concurring in part anddissenting in part.

A federal court commits error by submitting an issue to ajury over objection, unless the party seeking the jury determination has a right to a jury trial on the issue. Fed. RuleCiv. Proc. 39(a)(2). In this action under Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42
U. S. C. $ 1983, the city unsuccessfully objected to submittingrespondents' regulatory takings (or inverse condemnation)
claim to a jury. Respondents had no right to a jury trialeither by statute or under the Constitution; the District
Court thus erred in submitting their claim to a jury. Inholding to the contrary, that such a right does exist under
the Seventh Amendment, the Court misconceives a takingsclaim under $ 1983 and draws a false analogy between such
a claim and a tort action. I respectfully dissent from thiserror.

I
I see eye to eye with the Court on some of the preliminaryissues. I agree in rejecting extension of "rough proportionality" as a standard for reviewing land-use regulations gen-erally and so join Parts I and II of the majority opinion. I
also join the Court in thinking the statutory language "anaction at law" insufficient to provide a jury right under 42
U. S. C. $ 1983, ante, at 707-708, with the consequence that
Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., 517 U. S. 370(1996), must provide the appropriate questions in passing

on the issue of a constitutional guarantee of jury trial:" `whether we are dealing with a cause of action that either
was tried at law at the time of the founding or is at leastanalogous to one that was' "; and, if so, " `whether the particular trial decision must fall to the jury in order to pre-serve the substance of the common-law right as it existed
in 1791.' " Ante, at 708 (quoting Markman, supra, at 376).The Court soundly concedes that at the adoption of the Seventh Amendment there was no action like the modern in526US3 Unit: $U61 [01-03-01 13:40:33] PAGES PGT: OPIN

verse condemnation suit for obtaining just compensationwhen the government took property without invoking formal

condemnation procedures. Like the Court, I am accordinglyremitted to a search for any analogy that may exist and a
consideration of any implication going to the substance of thejury right that the results of that enquiry may raise. But
this common launching ground is where our agreement ends.

II
The city's proposed analogy of inverse condemnation pro-ceedings to direct ones is intuitively sensible, given their

common Fifth Amendment constitutional source and link tothe sovereign's power of eminent domain. Accord, e. g., New
Port Largo, Inc. v. Monroe County, 95 F. 3d 1084, 1092 (CA111996) ("We have discovered no indication that the rule in
regulatory takings cases differs from the general eminentdomain framework");

Northglenn v. Grynberg, 846 P. 2d 175,178 (Colo. 1993) ("Because an inverse condemnation action is

based on the `takings' clause of our constitution, it is to betried as if it were an eminent domain proceeding"). See
Grant, A Revolutionary View of the Seventh Amendmentand the Just Compensation Clause, 91 Nw. U. L. Rev. 144,
191-205 (1996).The intuition is borne out by closer analysis of the respective proceedings. The ultimate issue is identical in both di-rect and inverse condemnation actions: a determination of
"the fair market value of the property [taken] on the date itis appropriated," as the measure of compensation required
by the Fifth Amendment. Kirby Forest Industries, Inc. v.
United States, 467 U. S. 1, 10 (1984). It follows, as JusticeBrandeis said in

Hurley v. Kincaid, 285 U. S. 95 (1932), that"[t]he compensation which [a property owner] may obtain in

[an inverse condemnation] proceeding will be the same asthat which he might have been awarded had the [government] instituted . . . condemnation proceedings," id., at 104.This, indeed, has been our settled understanding, in cases

Opinion of Souter, J.
before Hurley and after Kirby Forest Industries, which haveemphasized the common underlying nature of direct and inverse condemnation cases; the commencement of inverse con-demnation actions by property owners, and direct condemnation proceedings by the government, does not go to the
substance of either. As we said in First English Evangelical Lutheran Church of Glendale v. County of Los Angeles,
482 U. S. 304 (1987):

" `The fact that condemnation proceedings were not in-stituted and that the right was asserted in suits by the

owners d[oes] not change the essential nature of the
claim. The form of the remedy did not qualify theright. It rested upon the Fifth Amendment.' "

Id., at
315 (quoting Jacobs v. United States, 290 U. S. 13, 16(1933)).

Accord, Boom Co. v. Patterson, 98 U. S. 403, 407 (1879) ("Thepoint in issue [in the inverse condemnation proceeding] was
the compensation to be made to the owner of the land; inother words, the value of the property taken. . . . The case
would have been in no essential particular different had theState authorized the company by statute to appropriate the
particular property in question, and the owners to bring suitagainst the company in the courts of law for its value"). It
is presumably for this reason that this Court has described
inverse condemnation actions as it might speak of eminentdomain proceedings brought by property owners instead of

the government. See Agins v. City of Tiburon, 447 U. S.255, 258, n. 2 (1980) ("Inverse condemnation is `a shorthand
description of the manner in which a landowner recovers just
compensation for a taking of his property when condemnation proceedings have not been instituted' ") (quoting United
States v. Clarke, 445 U. S. 253, 257 (1980)). See also Armstrong v. United States, 364 U. S. 40, 49 (1960); Grant, supra,
at 192-193 ("The difference between condemnation and inverse condemnation inheres precisely in the `character' of

the former as United States v. Landowner and the latter asLandowner v. United States"). Thus, the analogy between

direct and inverse condemnation is apparent whether wefocus on the underlying Fifth Amendment right or the common remedy of just compensation.The strength of the analogy is fatal to respondents' claim
to a jury trial as a matter of right. Reaffirming what wasalready a well-established principle, the Court explained
over a century ago that "the estimate of the just compensa-tion for property taken for the public use, under the right of
eminent domain, is not required to be made by a jury," Bauman v. Ross, 167 U. S. 548, 593 (1897) (citing, inter alia, Custiss v. Georgetown & Alexandria Turnpike Co., 6 Cranch 233(1810); United States v. Jones, 109 U. S. 513, 519 (1883); and

Shoemaker v. United States, 147 U. S. 282, 300, 301 (1893)),1

1 In Bauman, the Court upheld a statute (providing for condemnation
of land for streets) that contemplated a form of jury "differing from an
ordinary jury in consisting of less than twelve persons, and in not being
required to act with unanimity," and stated that the just compensation
determination "may be entrusted by Congress to commissioners appointed
by a court or by the executive, or to an inquest consisting of more or fewer
men than an ordinary jury." 167 U. S., at 593. The Court relied upon
prior cases that had assumed the absence of a constitutional right to a
jury determination of just compensation. See, e. g., Shoemaker, 147 U. S.,
at 301-302, 304-305 (upholding statute providing for ascertainment of the
value of condemned land by three presidentially appointed commissioners); Jones, 109 U. S., at 519 ("The proceeding for the ascertainment of the
value of the property and consequent compensation to be made, is merely
an inquisition to establish a particular fact as a preliminary to the actual
taking; and it may be prosecuted before commissioners or special boards
or the courts, with or without the intervention of a jury, as the legislative
power may designate"). See also Kohl v. United States, 91 U. S. 367, 376
(1876) ("That [the right of eminent domain] was not enforced through the
agency of a jury is immaterial; for many civil as well as criminal proceedings at common law were without a jury"); Crane v. Hahlo, 258 U. S. 142,
147 (1922) ("[T]he reference of such a question [determining the amount
of compensation], especially in eminent domain proceedings, to a commission, or board, or sheriff's jury, or other non-judicial tribunal, was so common in England and in this country prior to the adoption of the Federal

and we have since then thought it "long . . . settled thatthere is no constitutional right to a jury in eminent domain

proceedings," United States v. Reynolds, 397 U. S. 14, 18(1970).

2 See 12 C. Wright, A. Miller, & R. Marcus, Federal

Practice and Procedure $ 3051, p. 224 (1997) ("It is absolutelysettled that there is no constitutional right to a trial by jury

in compensation cases").The reason that direct condemnation proceedings carry no
jury right is not that they fail to qualify as "Suits at commonlaw" within the meaning of the Seventh Amendment's guarantee, for we may assume that they are indeed common lawproceedings,

3 see Kohl v. United States, 91 U. S. 367, 376

(1876) ("The right of eminent domain always was a right atcommon law");

Louisiana Power & Light Co. v. City of Thi-bodaux, 360 U. S. 25, 28 (1959) ("[A]n eminent domain proceeding is deemed for certain purposes of legal classificationa `suit at common law' "). The reason there is no right to

Constitution that it has been held repeatedly that it is a form of procedure
within the power of the State to provide").

2 Similarly, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does

not require a jury trial in state condemnation proceedings. See, e. g.,
Long Island Water Supply Co. v. Brooklyn, 166 U. S. 685, 694 (1897);
Crane, supra, at 147; Dohany v. Rogers, 281 U. S. 362, 369 (1930).

3 Several commentators and courts have advanced theories that a condemnation proceeding is not an action at law, but rather is either some
sort of special proceeding, or else an equitable proceeding. See, e. g., H.
Mills & A. Abbott, Mills on Law of Eminent Domain $ 84, p. 225 (2d ed.
1888); id., $ 91, at 239 ("Condemnation is not an action at law, but an inquisition on the part of the state for the ascertainment of a particular fact,
and may be conducted without the intervention of a jury"); 1A J. Sackman,
Nichols on Eminent Domain $ 4.105[1], p. 4-137 (rev. 3d ed. 1998) ("Condemnation proceedings are not suits at common law"). There is some
accumulated support for the idea that condemnation proceedings derive
from the writ ad quod damnum, which was issued by the courts of equity
to the sheriff to conduct an inquest into the amount of damages incurred
by a landowner as a result of the taking. Nonetheless, since Kohl v.
United States, supra, at 376, the first case involving the Federal Government's exercise of its power of eminent domain, this Court has classified
condemnation proceedings as suits at common law.

jury trial, rather, is that the Seventh Amendment "pre-serve[s]" the common law right where it existed at the time

of the framing, but does not create a right where none ex-isted then. See U. S. Const., Amdt. 7 ("In Suits at common
law . . . the right of trial by jury shall be preserved"). See
also 5 J. Moore, J. Lucas, & J. Wicker, Moore's Federal Prac-tice || 38.32[1], p. 38-268 (2d ed. 1996) ("[T]he Seventh

Amendment does not guarantee a jury trial in all commonlaw actions in the federal courts; [instead] it preserves the
right of jury trial as at common law"). There is no juryright, then, because condemnation proceedings carried "no
uniform and established right to a common law jury trial in
England or the colonies at the time . . . the Seventh Amendment was adopted." Ibid. See, e. g., Atlas Roofing Co. v.
Occupational Safety and Health Review Comm'n, 430 U. S.
442, 458 (1977) ("Condemnation was a suit at common law
but constitutionally could be tried without a jury"). The
statement in Reynolds indeed expressly rested on these considerations, as shown in the Court's quotation of Professor
Moore's statement that "[t]he practice in England and in the
colonies prior to the adoption in 1791 of the Seventh Amendment, the position taken by Congress contemporaneously
with, and subsequent to, the adoption of the Amendment,
and the position taken by the Supreme Court and nearly all
of the lower federal courts lead to the conclusion that there
is no constitutional right to jury trial in the federal courts in
an action for the condemnation of property under the power
of eminent domain." Reynolds, supra, at 18 (quoting 5 J.
Moore, Federal Practice || 38.32[1], p. 239 (2d ed. 1969) (internal quotation marks omitted)).

The Court in Reynolds was on solid footing. In England,
while the general practice of Parliament was to provide for
the payment of compensation, parliamentary supremacy enabled it to take private property for public use without compensation. See, e. g., Randolph, The Eminent Domain, 3
L. Q. Rev. 314, 323 (1887) ("That there is no eminent domain

526US3 Unit: $U61 [01-03-01 13:40:33] PAGES PGT: OPIN

739Cite as: 526 U. S. 687 (1999)
Opinion of Souter, J.
sub nomine in England is because the power is included, andthe right to compensation lost, in the absolutism of Parliament. The only technical term approximating eminent do-main is `compulsory powers' as used in statutes granting to
companies and associations the right to take private property for their use"). See also McNulty, The Power of "Com-pulsory Purchase" Under the Law of England, 21 Yale L. J.

639, 644-646 (1912). Thus, when Parliament made provisionfor compensation, it was free to prescribe whatever procedure it saw fit, and while the agency of a common law jurywas sometimes chosen, very frequently other methods were
adopted. See Blair, Federal Condemnation Proceedings and
the Seventh Amendment, 41 Harv. L. Rev. 29, 32-36 (1928);
id., at 36 ("[A]n ample basis exists in the parliamentary precedents for the conclusion that the common law sanctioned
such diverse methods of assessment that no one method can
be said to have been made imperative by the Seventh
Amendment"). See also 1A J. Sackman, Nichols on Eminent
Domain $ 4.105[1], p. 4-115, and $ 4.107, pp. 4-136 to 4-137
(rev. 3d ed. 1998) ("It had become the practice in almost all
of the original thirteen states at the time when their constitutions were adopted, to refer the question of damages from
the construction of [high]ways . . . to a commission of viewers
or appraisers, generally three or five in number"); id., at
4-137 ("[I]t has been repeatedly held that when land is taken
by authority of the United States, the damages may be ascertained by any impartial tribunal").

In sum, at the time of the framing the notion of regulatory
taking or inverse condemnation was yet to be derived, the
closest analogue to the then-unborn claim was that of direct
condemnation, and the right to compensation for such direct
takings carried with it no right to a jury trial, just as the
jury right is foreign to it in the modern era. On accepted
Seventh Amendment analysis, then, there is no reason to find
a jury right either by direct analogy or for the sake of preserving the substance of any jury practice known to the law

Opinion of Souter, J.
at the crucial time. Indeed, the analogy with direct con-demnation actions is so strong that there is every reason

to conclude that inverse condemnation should implicate nojury right.

III
The plurality avoids this obvious conclusion in two alterna-tive ways. One way is to disparage the comparison of inverse to direct taking, on the grounds that litigation of theformer involves proof of liability that the latter does not and
is generally more onerous to the landowner. The disparage-ment is joined with adoption of a different analogy, between
inverse condemnation proceedings and actions for tortiousinterference with property interests, the latter of which
do implicate a right to jury trial. The plurality's statedgrounds for avoiding the direct condemnation analogy, however, simply break down, and so does the purported compari-son to the tort actions. The other way the plurality avoids
my conclusion is by endorsing the course followed by Justice Scalia in his separate opinion, by selecting an analogynot to tort actions as such, but to tort-like $ 1983 actions.

This alternative, however, is ultimately found wanting, for itprefers a statutory analogy to a constitutional one.

A

1
The plurality's argument that no jury is required in a di-rect condemnation proceeding because the government's liability is conceded, leaving only the issue of damages to beassessed, rests on a premise that is only partially true. The
part that is true, of course, is that the overwhelming numberof direct condemnation cases join issue solely on the amount
of damages, that is, on the just compensation due the land-owner. But that is not true always. Now and then a landowner will fight back by denying the government's right tocondemn, claiming that the object of the taking was not a
public purpose or was otherwise unauthorized by statute.

See, e. g., Hawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff, 467 U. S.
229, 240 (1984) ("There is . . . a role for courts to play in
reviewing a legislature's judgment of what constitutes a public use, even . . . [if] it is an `extremely narrow' one" (citation
omitted)); Shoemaker, 147 U. S., at 298. See also 2A Sackman, supra, at 7-81 to 7-82, and nn. 89-90 (listing state cases

for private purposes); 2 J. Lewis, Law of Eminent Domain

$ 417, p. 923, and n. 51 (2d ed. 1900). What is more, when
such a direct condemnation does have more than compensation at stake, the defense of no public purpose or authority
closely resembles, if indeed it does not duplicate, one of the
grounds of liability for inverse condemnation noted in Agins,
447 U. S., at 260-261, and raised in this case: the failure of
the regulation to contribute substantially to the realization
of a legitimate governmental purpose.4 Indeed, the distinction between direct and inverse condemnation becomes
murkier still when one considers that, even though most inverse condemnation plaintiffs accept the lawfulness of the
taking and just want money, see infra, at 747, n. 7, some
such plaintiffs ask for an injunction against the government's
action, in which event they seek the same ultimate relief as
the direct condemnee who defends against the taking as unauthorized. If the direct condemnee has no right to a jury,
see 2A Sackman, Nichols on Eminent Domain $ 7.03[11][a], at
7-90 ("The question of whether a legislative determination of
a public use is really public has been declared by the courts
ultimately to be a judicial one"), the inverse condemnee
should fare no differently.

742 MONTEREY v. DEL MONTE DUNES AT MONTEREY, LTD.

Opinion of Souter, J.
This recognition may underlie the fact that the plurality'sabsence-of-liability-issue reasoning for distinguishing direct

and inverse condemnation fails to resonate through the casesholding that direct actions carry no jury right or commenting
on the absence of juries in such cases. While the pluralitycites an opinion of Justice Baldwin, sitting on Circuit, for its
position, ante, at 713 (citing Bonaparte v. Camden & Amboy
R. Co., 3 F. Cas. 821, 829 (No. 1,617) (CC NJ 1830)), thiscitation leaves the reader with a rather skewed perspective

on the diversity of rationales underlying early state cases inwhich the right of a direct condemnee to a jury trial was
considered and denied. Several courts rested on the fact
that proceedings to secure compensation were in the natureof suits against the sovereign, and thus the legislature could

qualify and condition the right to bring such suits, at leastto the extent of providing that they be conducted without a
jury. See, e. g., Ligat v. Commonwealth, 19 Pa. 456, 460(1852) ("A sovereign state is not liable to an action at law,
against her consent; and the right of trial by jury has, there-fore, no existence in such a case");

Pennsylvania R. Co. v.
First German Lutheran Congregation of Pittsburgh, 53 Pa.
445, 449 (1866) ("In taking private property for its road [therailroad corporation] exercises a part of the sovereign power

of the state . . . [and] the right of trial by jury has neverbeen held to belong to the citizen himself in proceedings by
the state under her powers of eminent domain"). See also
McElrath v. United States, 102 U. S. 426, 440 (1880). Just
as significantly, the plurality's new rationale is absent fromany of our precedents, including those underlying the

Reynolds decision.5

5 See n. 1, supra. Moreover, if presence of a liability issue were crucial,
then the jury right presumably would be lost in every tort case with liability conceded, which goes to trial on damages alone. Such, of course, is
not the practice. See, e. g., Blazar v. Perkins, 463 A. 2d 203, 207 (R. I.
1983) ("The fact that prior to trial, defendants admitted liability, thereby
removing one issue from the consideration of the jury, does not alter the

743Cite as: 526 U. S. 687 (1999)
Opinion of Souter, J.
Finally, the absence of the plurality's rationale from ourprior discussions of the matter most probably reflects the

fact that the want of a liability issue in most condemnationcases says nothing to explain why no jury ought to be provided on the question of damages that always is before thecourts. The dollars-and-cents issue is about as "factual" as
one can be (to invoke a criterion of jury suitability empha-sized by the Court in another connection,

ante, at 720-721),and no dispute about liability provokes more contention than

the price for allowing the government to put a landownerout of house and home. If an emphasis on factual issues
vigorously contested were a sufficient criterion for identify-ing something essential to the preservation of the Seventh
Amendment jury right, there ought to be a jury right indirect condemnation cases as well as the inverse ones favored by the plurality.The plurality's second reason for doubting the comparability of direct and inverse condemnation is that the landownerhas a heavier burden to shoulder in the latter case, beginning
with a need to initiate legal action, see United States v.Clarke, 445 U. S., at 257. Once again, however, it is apparent that the two varieties of condemnation are not alwaysso distinguishable. The landowner who defends in a direct
condemnation action by denying the government's right totake is in no significantly different position from the inverse
condemnee who claims the government must pay or be en-joined because its regulation fails to contribute substantially
to its allegedly public object. See, e. g., 2A Sackman, supra,$ 7.03[12], at 7-105 to 7-106 (citing cases where "the challenger has the burden of proof to show that the taking is notfor a public purpose"). And once again one may ask why,
even if the inverse condemnee's burden always were theheavier, that should make any difference. Some plaintiffs'
cases are easy and some are difficult, but the difficult ones
application of th[e] principle [that plaintiffs cannot waive a jury trial on
the issue of damage when defendants have demanded a jury trial]").

are no different in front of a jury (except on the assumptionthat juries are more apt to give David the advantage against

Goliath, which I do not believe is the plurality's point). Nei-ther the Fifth nor the Seventh Amendment has ever been
thought to shift and spring with ease of proof. Cf. United
States v. 101.88 Acres of Land, More or Less, Situated inSt. Mary Parish, La., 616 F. 2d 762, 772 (CA5 1980) ("The

Just as the plurality's efforts to separate direct from in-verse condemnation actions thus break down, so does its proposal to analogize inverse condemnation to property damagetorts. Whereas the plurality posits an early practice of litigating inverse condemnation as a common law tort, therewas in fact a variety of treatments, some of them consistent
with the plurality's argument, some of them not. None ofthose treatments turned on the plurality's analysis that a
State's withholding of some recovery process is essential tothe cause of action. In the end, the plurality's citations simply do not point to any early practice both consistently fol-lowed and consistent with the concepts underlying today's
inverse condemnation law. a

The plurality introduces its claimed analogue of tort ac-tions for property damage by emphasizing what it sees as a
real difference between the action of the government in di-rect condemnations, and those inverse condemnations, at
least, that qualify for litigation under $ 1983. Whereas ineminent domain proceedings the government admits its liability for the value of the taking, in the inverse condemnationcases litigated under $ 1983, it refuses to do so inasmuch as
it denies the landowner any state process (or effective proc-ess) for litigating his claim. See Williamson County Re526US3 Unit: $U61 [01-03-01 13:40:33] PAGES PGT: OPIN

gional Planning Comm'n v. Hamilton Bank of JohnsonCity, 473 U. S. 172, 194-195 (1985). Thus the plurality explains that

"[a]lthough the government acts lawfully when, pursu-ant to proper authorization, it takes property and provides just compensation, the government's action is law-ful solely because it assumes a duty, imposed by the
Constitution, to provide just compensation. See FirstEnglish, 482 U. S., at 315 (citing Jacobs, 290 U. S., at 16).
When the government repudiates this duty, either bydenying just compensation in fact or by refusing to provide procedures through which compensation may besought, it violates the Constitution. In those circumstances the government's actions are not only unconstitu-tional but unlawful and tortious as well."

Ante, at 717.

According to the plurality, it is the taking of property with-out providing compensation or a mechanism to obtain it that

is tortious and subject to litigation under $ 1983. See ante,at 714-715, 717. By this reasoning, the plurality seeks to
distinguish such a $ 1983 action from a direct condemnationaction and possibly from "an ordinary inverse condemnation suit," as well, ante, at 721, by which the plurality pre-sumably means a suit under a state law providing a mechanism for redress of regulatory takings claims.The plurality claims to have authority for this view in
some early state and federal cases seeing regulatory inter-ference with land use as akin to nuisance, trespass, or trespass on the case, ante, at 715-716, and I agree that two ofthe plurality's cited cases,

6 decided under state law, are

6 Two of the cases cited by the plurality offer at most tangential support.
Plaintiff's claim in Barron ex rel. Tiernan v. Mayor of Baltimore, 7 Pet.
243, 249 (1833), was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, on the ground that
the Fifth Amendment was not applicable to the States. In Lindsay v.
Commissioners, 2 Bay 38 (S. C. 1796), the plaintiff sought a writ of prohibition restraining city commissioners from laying out a street, not damages.
While the plurality relies on the opinion of one justice favoring the grant526US3 Unit: $U61 [01-03-01 13:40:33] PAGES PGT: OPIN

authority for the tort treatment the plurality claims to bethe appropriate analogy. See Gardner v. Village of Newburgh, 2 Johns. Ch. 162 (N. Y. 1816) (Kent, Ch.); Pumpelly v.Green Bay Co., 13 Wall. 166 (1872). One other is arguably
such authority; Richards v. Washington Terminal Co., 233U. S. 546 (1914), is somewhat ambiguous, holding that the
law of nuisance would provide compensation for interferencewith enjoyment of land when the State chose not to take the
interest by direct condemnation; the measure of damages(not explained) may well have been what the Fifth Amendment would provide for a temporary partial taking.Beyond these cases, however, any prospect of a uniform
tort treatment disappears. One of the plurality's citedcases, Bradshaw v. Rodgers, 20 Johns. 103 (N. Y. 1822), was
reversed by Rogers v. Bradshaw, 20 Johns. 735 (N. Y. 1823).As the concept of public liability was explained in the latter
opinion, it turned not on an issue of garden variety tort law,but on whether there was a total absence or not of legal
authority for a defending public officer's action with respectto the land. See

id., at 743 ("I should doubt exceedingly,whether the general principle, that private property is not

to be taken for public uses without just compensation, is tobe carried so far as to make a public officer, who enters upon
private property by virtue of legislative authority, speciallygiven for a public purpose, a trespasser, if he enters before
the property has been paid for. I do not know, nor do I find,that the precedents will justify any court of justice in carrying the general principle to such an extent"). See alsoBrauneis, The First Constitutional Tort: The Remedial Revolution in Nineteenth-Century State Just CompensationLaw, 52 Vand. L. Rev. 57, 64-65 (1999) (demonstrating that

could recover retrospective damages under common law ac-tion of trespass or trespass on the case only after defendant

was "stripped of his [legislative] justification"). Cf. Leaderv. Moxon, 2 Black. W. 924, 927, 96 Eng. Rep. 546, 547 (C. P.
1773) (commissioners acted outside their statutory authorityand were thus liable in tort);

Boulton v. Crowther, 2 Barn. &Cress. 701, 707, 107 Eng. Rep. 544, 547 (K. B. 1824). Under

these cases, there would be no recovery unless the publicofficer interfering with the property right was acting wholly
without authority. But as absence of legal authorization be-comes crucial to recovery, the analogy to tort liability fades.
What is even more damaging to the attempted tort analogy,whether it rests on simple tort cases like

Gardner or legalauthorization cases like Bradshaw, is that this very assumption that liability flows from wrongful or unauthorized con-duct is at odds with the modern view of acts effecting inverse
condemnation as being entirely lawful.7 See First EnglishEvangelical Lutheran, 482 U. S., at 314-315 (citing Williamson County Regional Planning Comm'n v. Hamilton Bankof Johnson City, 473 U. S., at 194; Hodel v. Virginia Surface
Mining & Reclamation Assn., Inc., 452 U. S. 264, 297, n. 40(1981); Hurley v. Kincaid, 285 U. S., at 104; Monongahela
Nav. Co. v. United States, 148 U. S. 312, 336 (1893); UnitedStates v. Jones, 109 U. S., at 518). Unlike damages to redress a wrong as understood in Gardner or Bradshaw (oreven in a modern tort action), a damages award in an inverse
condemnation action orders payment of the "just compensa-tion" required by the Constitution for payment of an obligation lawfully incurred.To the plurality's collection of tort and authorization cases,
one must add those that are so far from reflecting any earlyunderstanding of inverse condemnation as conventionally

7 When an inverse condemnee seeks an injunction (as when a direct condemnee challenges the taking, or a plaintiff claims a substantive due process violation), there is a claim of wrong in the sense of lack of authority.
But this is not so in the usual case where damages are sought.

tortious that they treat inverse condemnation as groundingan action in quasi contract, see, e. g., Jacobs v. United States,

290 U. S., at 16. Although the quasi-contractual actionseems to be the closest cousin to the plurality's conception of

$ 1983 as applied here, the resemblance is limited by thatstrain of quasi-contract

8 theory holding that the defendant

must pay for what he has received to avoid unjust enrich-ment, see E. Farnsworth, Contracts $ 2.20, p. 101 (3d ed.

1999), whereas the theory of just compensation for a takingis that the owner must be paid for what he has lost,

UnitedStates v. Miller, 317 U. S. 369, 373-374 (1943).

After a canvass of these materials, the only conclusion thatseems reasonable to me is that prior to the emergence of
the modern inverse condemnation action a spectrum of legaltheories was employed to respond to the problem of inverse
taking. No one of these experiments can be accepted as adefinitive analogue of the contemporary action, and each of
them is inconsistent in some way with the contemporaryview that inverse condemnation enforces payment for the
owner's value in property lawfully taken.

b
If the chosen tort analogy were not already too weak tosustain the plurality's position, it would be rendered so by

the plurality's inability to identify any tort recovery underthe old cases for the government's sin of omission in failing
to provide a process of compensation (which the pluralityfinds at the heart of the $ 1983 claim), as distinct from the
acts of interfering with use or enjoyment of land. The plu-rality simply fails to find any analogue on this element, and
its failure is in fact matched by the failure of its $ 1983 theoryto fit the reality of $ 1983 litigation for inverse takings.
When an inverse condemnation claim is brought under$ 1983, the "provision" of law that is thereby enforced,

Golden State Transit Corp. v. Los Angeles, 493 U. S. 103, 106(1989), is the Fifth Amendment Just Compensation Clause

and no other.9 There is no separate cause of action for with-holding process, and respondents in the instant case do not
claim otherwise; they simply seek just compensation fortheir land, subject to the usual rules governing $ 1983 liability and damages awards.10

c

Finally, it must be said that even if the tort analogue werenot a failure, it would prove too much. For if the comparison to inverse condemnation were sound, it would be equally

9 Of course, $ 1983 "is not itself a source of substantive rights, but a
method for vindicating federal rights elsewhere conferred by those parts
of the United States Constitution and federal statutes that it describes."
Baker v. McCollan, 443 U. S. 137, 144, n. 3 (1979). Accord, Johnson v.
University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire, 70 F. 3d 469, 481 (CA7 1995) ("Because $ 1983 does not create substantive rights, but rather provides a remedy for violations of pre-existing rights, $ 1983 claims must specifically
allege a violation of the Constitution or `laws' of the United States").

10 Respondents in this case sought damages for the fair market value of

the property, interim damages for a temporary taking, holding costs, interest, attorney's fees, costs, and other consequential damages. Complaint
pp. 14-15; First Amended Complaint pp. 16-17. The jury was instructed
that in calculating damages: "[I]t's up to you to decide the difference in
value, the fair market value as a result of the City's decision. Multiply it
by an interest rate you think is appropriate, for a length of time you think
is appropriate. So those are the three elements of computing the damages claimed if you determine the plaintiff is entitled to recover." 11
Record 1426. Respondents thus sought no incremental "damages" (beyond just compensation) for denial of state compensation procedures. Indeed, the only "damages" available in inverse condemnation cases is the
just compensation measured by the value of the land. See supra, at 734.
See, e. g., Eide v. Sarasota County, 908 F. 2d 716 (CA11 1990). The fact
that no further element of damages is recognized confirms rejection of the
tort analogy, for it would be a peculiar tort indeed that did not recognize
its concomitant injury in damages. Cf. Miller v. Campbell County, 854
P. 2d 71, 77 (Wyo. 1993) (rejecting reliance on tort law in holding that
emotional distress is not a proper element of damages in inverse condemnation actions).

sound as to direct condemnation and so require recognitionof the very jury right that we have previously denied. This

perception was apparent to the Court of Appeals in this case,when it wrote (erroneously) that "both eminent domain and
inverse condemnation actions resemble common-law actionsfor trover to recover damages for conversion of personal
property, and detinue and replevin." 95 F. 3d 1422, 1427(CA9 1996). The Court of Appeals, indeed, cited

Beattyv. United States, 203 F. 620 (CA4 1913), as does the plurality, ante, at 717, in which the Fourth Circuit held thatthe landowner in a direct condemnation proceeding had a
Seventh Amendment right to a jury determination of justcompensation:

"The taking of property by condemnation under thepower of eminent domain is compulsory. The party is
deprived of his property against his will. . . . The anal-ogy to a suit at common law for trespass is close and
complete, and it is for that reason presumably the Su-preme Court of the United States, acting on the definition of a suit at common law previously indicated by it,has decided that a proceeding by the United States to
condemn lands for public purposes is a suit at commonlaw. If so it be, then it would follow that the defendant,
if he claims it, is entitled at some stage in the proceedingto have his damages assessed by a jury." 203 F., at 626.

The plurality's analogy, if accepted, simply cannot be con-fined to inverse condemnation actions alone, and if it is not
so confined it runs squarely against the settled law in thefield of direct condemnation.

B
In addition to the plurality's direct tort analogy, the Courtpursues a different analytical approach in adopting

Justice
Scalia's analogy to $ 1983 actions seeking legal relief, seeante, at 709.

Justice Scalia begins with a more sweeping

526US3 Unit: $U61 [01-03-01 13:40:33] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of Souter, J.
claim: "The central question remains whether a $ 1983 suitis entitled to a jury." Ante, at 724 (opinion concurring in

part and concurring in judgment). The analogy to the broadclass of $ 1983 actions is put forward as serving the undoubted virtues of simplicity and uniformity in treating vari-ous actions that may be brought under a single remedial
statute. It is only when "apply[ing] this methodology to thepresent case,"

ante, at 727, that Justice Scalia is carefulnot to claim too much: he no longer argues for drawing an

analogy between $ 1983 inverse condemnation actions andall $ 1983 actions, but only those $ 1983 actions brought to
recover money damages, see ante, at 729. This subclass of$ 1983 actions, he quite correctly notes, has been treated as
tortlike in character and thus as much entitled to jury trialas tort actions have been at common law. For two independent reasons, however, I think the analogy with $ 1983actions, either as a class or as a subclass of damages actions,
is inadequate. 1

First, the analogy to all $ 1983 actions does not serve anyunified field theory of jury rights under $ 1983. While the
statute is indeed a prism through which rights originatingelsewhere may pass on their way to a federal jury trial, trial
by jury is not a uniform feature of $ 1983 actions. The stat-ute provides not only for actions at law with damages remedies where appropriate, but for "suit[s] in equity, or otherproper proceeding[s] for redress." 42 U. S. C. $ 1983. Accordingly, rights passing through the $ 1983 prism may inproper cases be vindicated by injunction, see, e. g., Mitchum
v. Foster, 407 U. S. 225, 242-243 (1972) ($ 1983 falls within"expressly authorized" exception of Anti-Injunction Act and
thus authorizes injunctions staying state-court proceedings),by orders of restitution, see,

e. g., Samuel v. University ofPittsburgh, 538 F. 2d 991, 994-995 (CA3 1976) (restitution of

university fees collected pursuant to rule held to violateEqual Protection Clause), and by declaratory judgments, see,

Opinion of Souter, J.
e. g., Steffel v. Thompson, 415 U. S. 452, 454, 475 (1974) (declaratory relief under $ 1983 available in suit claiming state
criminal statute constitutionally invalid), none of which implicate, or always implicate, a right to jury trial. Comparing inverse condemnation actions to the class of $ 1983 actions that are treated like torts does not, therefore, preserve
a uniformity in jury practice under $ 1983 that would otherwise be lost. Justice Scalia's metaphor is, indeed, an apt
one: $ 1983 is a prism, not a procrustean bed.

Nor, as I have already mentioned, see supra, at 748-750,
is there a sound basis for treating inverse condemnation as
providing damages for a tort. A State's untoward refusal
to provide an adequate remedy to obtain compensation, the
sine qua non of an inverse condemnation remedy under

$ 1983, is not itself the independent subject of an award of
damages (and respondents do not claim otherwise); the remedy is not damages for tortious behavior, but just compensation for the value of the property taken.

2
Even if an argument for $ 1983 simplicity and uniformity
were sustainable, however, it would necessarily be weaker
than the analogy with direct condemnation actions. That
analogy rests on two elements that are present in each of the
two varieties of condemnation actions: a Fifth Amendment
constitutional right and a remedy specifically mandated by
that same amendment. Because constitutional values are
superior to statutory values, uniformity as between different
applications of a given constitutional guarantee is more important than uniformity as between different applications of
a given statute. If one accepts that proposition as I do, a
close analogy between direct and inverse condemnation proceedings is necessarily stronger than even a comparably
close resemblance between two statutory actions.

IV
Were the results of the analysis to this point uncertain,
one final anomaly of the Court's position would point up its
error. The inconsistency of recognizing a jury trial right in
inverse condemnation, notwithstanding its absence in condemnation actions, appears the more pronounced on recalling
that under Agins one theory of recovery in inverse condemnation cases is that the taking makes no substantial contribution to a legitimate governmental purpose.11 This issue includes not only a legal component that may be difficult to
resolve, but one so closely related to similar issues in substantive due process property claims, that this Court cited a
substantive due process case when recognizing the theory
under the rubric of inverse condemnation. See Agins, 447
U. S., at 260 (citing Nectow v. Cambridge, 277 U. S. 183, 188
(1928)).12 Substantive due process claims are, of course, routinely reserved without question for the court. See, e. g.,
County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U. S. 833, 853-855
(1998); Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U. S. 702, 722-723
(1997); FM Properties Operating Co. v. Austin, 93 F. 3d 167,
172, n. 6 (CA5 1996) (rational relationship to legitimate government interest for purposes of substantive due process a
question of law for the court); Sameric Corp. v. Philadelphia, 142 F. 3d 582, 590-591 (CA3 1998) (same as to city

11 The jury's inverse condemnation verdict did not indicate which of the
theories formed the basis of its liability finding: (1) whether the city's
action did not substantially advance a legitimate purpose; or (2) whether
the city's denial of the permit deprived the subject property of all economically viable use.

12 I offer no opinion here on whether Agins was correct in assuming that

this prong of liability was properly cognizable as flowing from the Just
Compensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment, as distinct from the Due
Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.

historical commission action).13 Thus, it would be far re-moved from usual practice to charge a jury with the duty

to assess the constitutional legitimacy of the government'sobjective or the constitutional adequacy of its relationship to
the government's chosen means.The usual practice makes perfect sense. While juries are
not customarily called upon to assume the subtleties of defer-ential review, courts apply this sort of limited scrutiny in
all sorts of contexts and are routinely accorded institutionalcompetence to do it. See,

e. g., Pearson v. Grand Blanc, 961F. 2d 1211, 1222 (CA6 1992) (deferential substantive due

process review a matter of law for the court). Scrutinizingthe legal basis for governmental action is "one of those
things that judges often do and are likely to do better thanjurors unburdened by training in exegesis."

Markman, 517U. S., at 388. It therefore should bring no surprise to find

that in the takings cases a question whether regulatory ac-tion substantially advances a legitimate public aim has more
often than not been treated by the federal courts as a legalissue. See,

e. g., New Port Largo, Inc. v. Monroe County,95 F. 3d 1084, 1092 (CA11 1996) (whether regulatory taking

occurred is an issue for the court); Mid Gulf, Inc. v. Bishop,792 F. Supp. 1205, 1213-1214, 1215 (Kan. 1992) (whether city's
regulations unreasonable and a taking a question of law forthe court); Gissel v. Kenmare Township, 512 N. W. 2d 470,
474 (N. D. 1994) (necessity for proposed taking a question forthe court);

Yegen v. Bismarck, 291 N. W. 2d 422, 424 (N. D.1980) (taking vel non of private property for public use a

question of law). But see Gray v. South Carolina Dept. ofHighways, 427 S. E. 2d 899 (S. C. App. 1992) (whether no
taking because closing of intersection was needed to preventserious public harm is jury issue). These practices point up

the government's aims are "clearly arbitrary and unreasonable, having no
substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare." Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., 272 U. S. 365, 395 (1926).

the great gulf between the practical realities of takings liti-gation, and the Court's reliance on the assertion that "in

suits sounding in tort for money damages, questions of liabil-ity were decided by the jury, rather than the judge, in most
cases," ante, at 718.Perhaps this is the reason that the Court apparently seeks
to distance itself from the ramifications of today's determi-nation. The Court disclaims any attempt to set a "precise
demarcation of the respective provinces of judge and juryin determining whether a zoning decision substantially advances legitimate governmental interests." Ante, at 722.It denies that today's holding would extend to "a broad
challenge to the constitutionality of the city's general land-use ordinances or policies," in which case, "the determination whether the statutory purposes were legitimate, orwhether the purposes, though legitimate, were furthered by
the law or general policy, might well fall within the provinceof the judge." Ibid. (And the plurality presumably does
not mean to address any Seventh Amendment issue thatsomeone might raise when the government has provided an
adequate remedy, for example, by recognizing a compensa-tory action for inverse condemnation, see

ante, at 714-715,717.) But the Court's reticence is cold comfort simply because it rests upon distinctions that withstand analysis nobetter than the tort-law analogies on which the Court's conclusion purports to rest. The narrowness of the Court'sintentions cannot, therefore, be accepted as an effective
limit on the consequences on its reasoning, from whichI respectfully dissent.

14 I would therefore remand the case. There would be no need for a
new trial; the judge could treat the jury's verdict as advisory, so long as
he recorded his own findings consistent with the jury's verdict. See Fed.

CALIFORNIA DENTAL ASSOCIATION v. FEDERALTRADE COMMISSION
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 97-1625. Argued January 13, 1999--Decided May 24, 1999
Petitioner California Dental Association (CDA), a nonprofit association of

local dental societies to which about three-quarters of the State's dentists belong, provides desirable insurance and preferential financing arrangements for its members, and engages in lobbying, litigation, marketing, and public relations for members' benefit. Members agree to
abide by the CDA's Code of Ethics, which, inter alia, prohibits false
or misleading advertising. The CDA has issued interpretive advisory
opinions and guidelines relating to advertising. Respondent Federal
Trade Commission brought a complaint, alleging that the CDA violated

$ 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (Act), 15 U. S. C. $ 45, in applying its guidelines so as to restrict two types of truthful, nondeceptive
advertising: price advertising, particularly discounted fees, and advertising relating to the quality of dental services. An Administrative
Law Judge (ALJ) held the Commission to have jurisdiction over the
CDA and found a $ 5 violation. As relevant here, the Commission held
that the advertising restrictions violated the Act under an abbreviated
rule-of-reason analysis. In affirming, the Ninth Circuit sustained the
Commission's jurisdiction and concluded that an abbreviated or "quick
look" rule-of-reason analysis was proper in this case.

Held:

1. The Commission's jurisdiction extends to an association that, like
the CDA, provides substantial economic benefit to its for-profit members. The Act gives the Commission authority over a "corporatio[n],"
15 U. S. C. $ 45(a)(2), "organized to carry on business for its own profit
or that of its members," $ 44. The Commission's claim that the Act
gives it jurisdiction over nonprofit associations whose activities provide
substantial economic benefits to their for-profit members is clearly the
better reading of the Act, which does not require that a supporting
organization must devote itself entirely to its members' profits or say
anything about how much of the entity's activities must go to raising
the members' bottom lines. There is thus no apparent reason to let the
Act's application turn on meeting some threshold percentage of activity
for this purpose or even a softer formulation calling for a substantial
part of the entity's total activities to be aimed at its members' pecuniary

Syllabus
benefit. The Act does not cover all membership organizations of
profit-making corporations without more. However, the economic benefits conferred upon CDA's profit-seeking professionals plainly fall
within the object of enhancing its members' "profit," which is the Act's
jurisdictional touchstone. The Act's logic and purpose comport with
this result, and its legislative history is not inconsistent with this interpretation. Pp. 765-769.

2. Where any anticompetitive effects of given restraints are far from
intuitively obvious, the rule of reason demands a more thorough enquiry
into the consequences of those restraints than the abbreviated analysis
the Ninth Circuit performed in this case. Pp. 769-781.

(a) An abbreviated or "quick-look" analysis is appropriate when an
observer with even a rudimentary understanding of economics could
conclude that the arrangements in question have an anticompetitive effect on customers and markets. See, e. g., National Collegiate Athletic
Assn. v. Board of Regents of Univ. of Okla., 468 U. S. 85. This case
fails to present a situation in which the likelihood of anticompetitive
effects is comparably obvious, for the CDA's advertising restrictions
might plausibly be thought to have a net procompetitive effect or possibly no effect at all on competition. Pp. 769-771.

(b) The discount and nondiscount advertising restrictions are, on
their face, designed to avoid false or deceptive advertising in a market
characterized by striking disparities between the information available
to the professional and the patient. The existence of significant challenges to informed decisionmaking by the customer for professional
services suggests that advertising restrictions arguably protecting patients from misleading or irrelevant advertising call for more than cursory treatment. In applying cursory review, the Ninth Circuit brushed
over the professional context and described no anticompetitive effects
from the discount advertising bar. The CDA's price advertising rule
appears to reflect the prediction that any costs to competition associated
with eliminating across-the-board advertising will be outweighed by
gains to consumer information created by discount advertising that is
exact, accurate, and more easily verifiable. This view may or may not
be correct, but it is not implausible; and neither a court nor the Commission may initially dismiss it as presumptively wrong. The CDA's plausible explanation for its nonprice advertising restrictions, namely that
restricting unverifiable quality claims would have a procompetitive effect by preventing misleading or false claims that distort the market,
likewise rules out the Ninth Circuit's use of abbreviated rule-of-reason
analysis for those restrictions. The obvious anticompetitive effect that
triggers such analysis has not been shown. Pp. 771-778.

Syllabus
(c) Saying that the Ninth Circuit's conclusion required a more extended examination of the possible factual underpinnings than it received is not necessarily to call for the fullest market analysis. Not
every case attacking a restraint not obviously anticompetitive is a candidate for plenary market examination. There is generally no categorical
line between restraints giving rise to an intuitively obvious inference
of anticompetitive effect and those that call for more detailed treatment. What is required is an enquiry meet for the case, looking to
a restraint's circumstances, details, and logic. Here, a less quick look
was required for the initial assessment of the CDA's advertising
restrictions. Pp. 779-781.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.
There are two issues in this case: whether the jurisdiction
of the Federal Trade Commission extends to the California
Dental Association (CDA), a nonprofit professional association, and whether a "quick look" sufficed to justify finding
that certain advertising restrictions adopted by the CDA violated the antitrust laws. We hold that the Commission's
jurisdiction under the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC
Act) extends to an association that, like the CDA, provides
substantial economic benefit to its for-profit members, but
that where, as here, any anticompetitive effects of given restraints are far from intuitively obvious, the rule of reason
demands a more thorough enquiry into the consequences of
those restraints than the Court of Appeals performed.

The CDA is a voluntary nonprofit association of local dental societies to which some 19,000 dentists belong, including
about three-quarters of those practicing in the State. In re
California Dental Assn., 121 F. T. C. 190, 196-197 (1996).

of commerce, real-estate boards, [and] boards of trade," although it has for-profit subsidiaries that give its members
advantageous access to various sorts of insurance, including
liability coverage, and to financing for their real estate,
equipment, cars, and patients' bills. The CDA lobbies and
litigates in its members' interests, and conducts marketing
and public relations campaigns for their benefit. 128 F. 3d
720, 723 (CA9 1997).

The dentists who belong to the CDA through these associations agree to abide by a Code of Ethics (Code) including
the following $ 10:

"Although any dentist may advertise, no dentist shall
advertise or solicit patients in any form of communication in a manner that is false or misleading in any
material respect. In order to properly serve the public,
dentists should represent themselves in a manner that
contributes to the esteem of the public. Dentists should
not misrepresent their training and competence in any
way that would be false or misleading in any material
respect." App. 33.

The CDA has issued a number of advisory opinions interpreting this section,1 and through separate advertising

1 The advisory opinions, which substantially mirror parts of the California Business and Professions Code, see Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code Ann. $$ 651,
1680 (West 1999), include the following propositions:

"A statement or claim is false or misleading in any material respect
when it:

"a. contains a misrepresentation of fact;
"b. is likely to mislead or deceive because in context it makes only a
partial disclosure of relevant facts;

"c. is intended or is likely to create false or unjustified expectations of
favorable results and/or costs;

"d. relates to fees for specific types of services without fully and specifically disclosing all variables and other relevant factors;

Responsibility for enforcing the Code rests in the first instance with the local dental societies, to which applicants for
CDA membership must submit copies of their own advertisements and those of their employers or referral services to
assure compliance with the Code. The local societies also
actively seek information about potential Code violations
by applicants or CDA members. Applicants who refuse to
withdraw or revise objectionable advertisements may be denied membership; and members who, after a hearing, remain

probability will cause an ordinarily prudent person to misunderstand or

"Any communication or advertisement which refers to the cost of dental
services shall be exact, without omissions, and shall make each service
clearly identifiable, without the use of such phrases as `as low as,' `and up,'
`lowest prices,' or words or phrases of similar import.

"Any advertisement which refers to the cost of dental services and uses
words of comparison or relativity--for example, `low fees'--must be based
on verifiable data substantiating the comparison or statement of relativity.
The burden shall be on the dentist who advertises in such terms to establish the accuracy of the comparison or statement of relativity."

"Advertising claims as to the quality of services are not susceptible to
measurement or verification; accordingly, such claims are likely to be false
or misleading in any material respect." 128 F. 3d 720, 723-724 (CA9 1997)

Opinion of the Court
similarly recalcitrant are subject to censure, suspension, orexpulsion from the CDA. 128 F. 3d, at 724.

The Commission brought a complaint against the CDA, al-leging that it applied its guidelines so as to restrict truthful,
nondeceptive advertising, and so violated $ 5 of the FTC Act,38 Stat. 717, 15 U. S. C. $ 45.

3 The complaint alleged that

the CDA had unreasonably restricted two types of advertis-ing: price advertising, particularly discounted fees, and advertising relating to the quality of dental services. Com-plaint || 7. An Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) held the
Commission to have jurisdiction over the CDA, which, the
ALJ noted, had itself "stated that a selection of its programsand services has a potential value to members of between

$22,739 and $65,127," 121 F. T. C., at 207. He found that,
although there had been no proof that the CDA exertedmarket power, no such proof was required to establish an

antitrust violation under In re Mass. Bd. of Registration in
Optometry, 110 F. T. C. 549 (1988), since the CDA had
unreasonably prevented members and potential membersfrom using truthful, nondeceptive advertising, all to the detriment of both dentists and consumers of dental services.He accordingly found a violation of $ 5 of the FTC Act. 121
F. T. C., at 272-273.

The Commission adopted the factual findings of the ALJexcept for his conclusion that the CDA lacked market power,

with which the Commission disagreed. The Commissiontreated the CDA's restrictions on discount advertising as illegal per se. 128 F. 3d, at 725. In the alternative, the Com-mission held the price advertising (as well as the nonprice)
restrictions to be violations of the Sherman and FTC Acts

3 The FTC Act's prohibition of unfair competition and deceptive acts or
practices, 15 U. S. C. $ 45(a)(1), overlaps the scope of $ 1 of the Sherman
Act, 15 U. S. C. $ 1, aimed at prohibiting restraint of trade, FTC v. Indiana
Federation of Dentists, 476 U. S. 447, 454-455 (1986), and the Commission
relied upon Sherman Act law in adjudicating this case, In re California

Opinion of the Court
under an abbreviated rule-of-reason analysis. One Commis-sioner concurred separately, arguing that the Commission

should have applied the Mass. Bd. standard, not the per seanalysis, to the limitations on price advertising. Another
Commissioner dissented, finding the evidence insufficient to
show either that the restrictions had an anticompetitive ef-fect under the rule of reason, or that the CDA had market

power. 128 F. 3d, at 725.The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, sustaining the Commission's assertion of jurisdiction over theCDA and its ultimate conclusion on the merits.

Id., at 730.
The court thought it error for the Commission to have ap-plied

per se analysis to the price advertising restrictions,
finding analysis under the rule of reason required for all the
restrictions. But the Court of Appeals went on to explainthat the Commission had properly

"applied an abbreviated, or `quick look,' rule of reason
analysis designed for restraints that are not per se unlawful but are sufficiently anticompetitive on their facethat they do not require a full-blown rule of reason

inquiry. See [National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v.
Board of Regents of Univ. of Okla., 468 U. S. 85, 109-
110, and n. 39 (1984)] (`The essential point is that therule of reason can sometimes be applied in the twinkling

of an eye.' [Ibid. (citing P. Areeda, The "Rule of Rea-son" in Antitrust Analysis: General Issues 37-38 (Federal Judicial Center, June 1981) (parenthetical omitted)).] It allows the condemnation of a `naked restraint'on price or output without an `elaborate industry analysis.' Id., at 109." Id., at 727.
The Court of Appeals thought truncated rule-of-reason
analysis to be in order for several reasons. As for the restrictions on discount advertising, they "amounted in practice to a fairly `naked' restraint on price competition itself,"
ibid. The CDA's procompetitive justification, that the re526US3 Unit: $U62 [12-11-00 21:59:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
strictions encouraged disclosure and prevented false andmisleading advertising, carried little weight because "it is

simply infeasible to disclose all of the information that is re-quired," id., at 728, and "the record provides no evidence
that the rule has in fact led to increased disclosure and trans-parency of dental pricing,"

ibid. As to nonprice advertisingrestrictions, the court said that

"[t]hese restrictions are in effect a form of output limita-tion, as they restrict the supply of information about
individual dentists' services. See Areeda & Hoven-kamp, Antitrust Law || 1505 at 693-94 (Supp. 1997). . . .
The restrictions may also affect output more directly, asquality and comfort advertising may induce some customers to obtain nonemergency care when they mightnot otherwise do so. . . . Under these circumstances,
we think that the restriction is a sufficiently naked re-straint on output to justify quick look analysis."

Ibid.

The Court of Appeals went on to hold that the Commis-sion's findings with respect to the CDA's agreement and intent to restrain trade, as well as on the effect of the restric-tions and the existence of market power, were all supported
by substantial evidence. Id., at 728-730. In dissent, JudgeReal took the position that the Commission's jurisdiction did
not cover the CDA as a nonprofit professional associationengaging in no commercial operations.

Id., at 730. Buteven assuming jurisdiction, he argued, full-bore rule-ofreason analysis was called for, since the disclosure require-ments were not naked restraints and neither fixed prices nor
banned nondeceptive advertising. Id., at 730-731.We granted certiorari to resolve conflicts among the

The FTC Act gives the Commission authority over "per-sons, partnerships, or corporations," 15 U. S. C. $ 45(a)(2),

and defines "corporation" to include "any company . . . orassociation, incorporated or unincorporated, without shares
of capital or capital stock or certificates of interest, exceptpartnerships, which is organized to carry on business for its
own profit or that of its members," $ 44. Although the Cir-cuits have not agreed on the precise extent of this definition,
see n. 4, supra, the Commission has long held that some cir-cumstances give it jurisdiction over an entity that seeks no
profit for itself. While the Commission has claimed to havejurisdiction over a nonprofit entity if a substantial part of its
total activities provides pecuniary benefits to its members,see In re American Medical Assn., 94 F. T. C. 701, 983-984

Opinion of the Court
(1988) (Scalia, J., concurring) (Chevron deference applies toagency's interpretation of its own statutory jurisdiction)).

But we have no occasion to review the call for deferencehere, the interpretation urged in respondent's brief being
clearly the better reading of the statute under ordinary principles of construction.The FTC Act is at pains to include not only an entity "organized to carry on business for its own profit," 15 U. S. C.$ 44, but also one that carries on business for the profit "of
its members," ibid. While such a supportive organizationmay be devoted to helping its members in ways beyond immediate enhancement of profit, no one here has claimed that
such an entity must devote itself single-mindedly to the
profit of others. It could, indeed, hardly be supposed that
Congress intended such a restricted notion of covered supporting organizations, with the opportunity this would bring
with it for avoiding jurisdiction where the purposes of the
FTC Act would obviously call for asserting it.

Just as the FTC Act does not require that a supporting
organization must devote itself entirely to its members'
profits, neither does the Act say anything about how much
of the entity's activities must go to raising the members' bottom lines. There is accordingly no apparent reason to let
the statute's application turn on meeting some threshold percentage of activity for this purpose, or even satisfying a
softer formulation calling for a substantial part of the nonprofit entity's total activities to be aimed at its members'
pecuniary benefit. To be sure, proximate relation to lucre
must appear; the FTC Act does not cover all membership
organizations of profit-making corporations without more,
and an organization devoted solely to professional education
may lie outside the FTC Act's jurisdictional reach, even
though the quality of professional services ultimately affects
the profits of those who deliver them.

There is no line drawing exercise in this case, however,
where the CDA's contributions to the profits of its individual

526US3 Unit: $U62 [12-11-00 21:59:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN

767Cite as: 526 U. S. 756 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
members are proximate and apparent. Through for-profitsubsidiaries, the CDA provides advantageous insurance and

preferential financing arrangements for its members, and itengages in lobbying, litigation, marketing, and public relations for the benefit of its members' interests. This conge-ries of activities confers far more than

de minimis or merelypresumed economic benefits on CDA members; the economic

benefits conferred upon the CDA's profit-seeking profession-als plainly fall within the object of enhancing its members'
"profit," 6 which the FTC Act makes the jurisdictional touch6 This conclusion is consistent with holdings by a number of Courts of
Appeals. In FTC v. National Comm'n on Egg Nutrition, the Court of
Appeals held that a nonprofit association "organized for the profit of the
egg industry," 517 F. 2d, at 488, fell within the Commission's jurisdiction.
In American Medical Assn. v. FTC, 638 F. 2d 443 (CA2 1980), the Court
of Appeals held that the "business aspects," id., at 448, of the AMA's activities brought it within the Commission's reach. These cases are consistent with our conclusion that an entity organized to carry on activities that
will confer greater than de minimis or presumed economic benefits on
profit-seeking members certainly falls within the Commission's jurisdiction. In Community Blood Bank v. FTC, the Court of Appeals addressed
the question whether the Commission had jurisdiction over a blood bank
and an association of hospitals. It held that "the question of the jurisdiction over the corporations or other associations involved should be determined on an ad hoc basis," 405 F. 2d, at 1018, and that the Commission's
jurisdiction extended to "any legal entity without shares of capital which
engages in business for profit within the traditional meaning of that language," ibid. (emphasis deleted). The Court of Appeals also said that
"[a]ccording to a generally accepted definition `profit' means gain from
business or investment over and above expenditures, or gain made on
business or investment where both receipts or payments are taken into
account," id., at 1017, although in the same breath it noted that the term's
"meaning must be derived from the context in which it is used," id., at
1016. Our decision here is fully consistent with Community Blood Bank,
because the CDA contributes to the profits of at least some of its members,
even on a restrictive definition of profit as gain above expenditures. (It
should go without saying that the FTC Act does not require for Commission jurisdiction that members of an entity turn a profit on their membership, but only that the entity be organized to carry on business for members' profit.) Nonetheless, we do not, and indeed, on the facts here, could

768 CALIFORNIA DENTAL ASSN. v. FTC

Opinion of the Court
stone. There is no difficulty in concluding that the Commission has jurisdiction over the CDA.

The logic and purpose of the FTC Act comport with this
result. The FTC Act directs the Commission to "prevent"
the broad set of entities under its jurisdiction "from using
unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce and
unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce." 15 U. S. C. $ 45(a)(2). Nonprofit entities organized
on behalf of for-profit members have the same capacity and
derivatively, at least, the same incentives as for-profit organizations to engage in unfair methods of competition or unfair
and deceptive acts. It may even be possible that a nonprofit
entity up to no good would have certain advantages, not only
over a for-profit member but over a for-profit membership
organization as well; it would enjoy the screen of superficial
disinterest while devoting itself to serving the interests of
its members without concern for doing more than breaking
even.

Nor, contrary to petitioner's argument, is the legislative
history inconsistent with this interpretation of the Commission's jurisdiction. Although the versions of the FTC Act
first passed by the House and the Senate defined "corporation" to refer only to incorporated, joint stock, and sharecapital companies organized to carry on business for profit,
see H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 1142, 63d Cong., 2d Sess., 11, 14
(1914), the Conference Committee subsequently revised the
definition to its present form, an alteration that indicates an

not, decide today whether the Commission has jurisdiction over nonprofit
organizations that do not confer profit on for-profit members but do, for
example, show annual income surpluses, engage in significant commerce,
or compete in relevant markets with for-profit players. We therefore do
not foreclose the possibility that various paradigms of profit might fall
within the ambit of the FTC Act. Nor do we decide whether a purpose
of contributing to profit only in a presumed sense, as by enhancing professional educational efforts, would implicate the Commission's jurisdiction.

Opinion of the Court
intention to include nonprofit entities.7 And the legislativehistory, like the text of the FTC Act, is devoid of any hint at

an exemption for professional associations as such.We therefore conclude that the Commission had jurisdiction to pursue the claim here, and turn to the questionwhether the Court of Appeals devoted sufficient analysis to
sustain the claim that the advertising restrictions promul-gated by the CDA violated the FTC Act.

III
The Court of Appeals treated as distinct questions the suf-ficiency of the analysis of anticompetitive effects and the

substantiality of the evidence supporting the Commission'sconclusions. Because we decide that the Court of Appeals
erred when it held as a matter of law that quick-look analysiswas appropriate (with the consequence that the Commission's abbreviated analysis and conclusion were sustainable),we do not reach the question of the substantiality of the evidence supporting the Commission's conclusion.8In National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v. Board of Regents
of Univ. of Okla., 468 U. S. 85 (1984), we held that a "nakedrestraint on price and output requires some competitive jus7 A letter from Bureau of Corporations Commissioner Joseph E. Davies
to Senator Francis G. Newlands, the bill's sponsor and a member of the
Conference Committee, written August 8, 1914, before the Conference
Committee revisions, included a memorandum dated August 7, 1914, that
expressed concern that the versions of the bill passed by the House and
the Senate would not extend jurisdiction to purportedly nonprofit organizations, which might "furnish convenient vehicles for common understandings looking to the limitation of output and the fixing of prices contrary
to law." Trade Commission Bill: Letter from the Commissioner of Corporations to the Chairman of the Senate Comm. on Interstate Commerce,

8 We leave to the Court of Appeals the question whether on remand it

can effectively assess the Commission's decision for substantial evidence
on the record, or whether it must remand to the Commission for a more
extensive rule-of-reason analysis on the basis of an enhanced record.

FTC v. Indiana Federation of
Dentists, 476 U. S. 447, 459 (1986) (quoting National Soc. of
Professional Engineers, supra, at 692). In each of these
cases, which have formed the basis for what has come to becalled abbreviated or "quick-look" analysis under the rule

of reason, an observer with even a rudimentary understanding of economics could conclude that the arrangements in
question would have an anticompetitive effect on customers
and markets. In National Collegiate Athletic Assn., the
league's television plan expressly limited output (the number
of games that could be televised) and fixed a minimum price.
468 U. S., at 99-100. In National Soc. of Professional Engineers, the restraint was "an absolute ban on competitive bidding." 435 U. S., at 692. In Indiana Federation of Dentists, the restraint was "a horizontal agreement among the
participating dentists to withhold from their customers a
particular service that they desire." 476 U. S., at 459. As
in such cases, quick-look analysis carries the day when the
great likelihood of anticompetitive effects can easily be ascertained. See Law v. National Collegiate Athletic Assn.,

analysis applies "where a practice has obvious anticompetitive effects"); Chicago Professional Sports Limited Partnership v. National Basketball Assn., 961 F. 2d 667, 674-676

ments in National Soc. of Professional Engineers and Indi-ana Federation of Dentists "embodied a strong economic

self-interest of the parties to them").The case before us, however, fails to present a situation in
which the likelihood of anticompetitive effects is comparablyobvious. Even on

Justice Breyer's view that bars ontruthful and verifiable price and quality advertising are

prima facie anticompetitive, see post, at 784-785 (opinionconcurring in part and dissenting in part), and place the
burden of procompetitive justification on those who agree toadopt them, the very issue at the threshold of this case is
whether professional price and quality advertising is suffi-ciently verifiable in theory and in fact to fall within such
a general rule. Ultimately our disagreement with Justice
Breyer turns on our different responses to this issue.Whereas he accepts, as the Ninth Circuit seems to have

done, that the restrictions here were like restrictions on ad-vertisement of price and quality generally, see, e. g., post, at
785, 787, 790, it seems to us that the CDA's advertising re-strictions might plausibly be thought to have a net procompetitive effect, or possibly no effect at all on competition.The restrictions on both discount and nondiscount advertising are, at least on their face, designed to avoid false or de-ceptive advertising

9 in a market characterized by striking

disparities between the information available to the profes-sional and the patient.

10 Cf. Carr & Mathewson, The Eco9 That false or misleading advertising has an anticompetitive effect, as
that term is customarily used, has been long established. Cf. FTC v. Algoma Lumber Co., 291 U. S. 67, 79-80 (1934) (finding a false advertisement
to be unfair competition).

10 "The fact that a restraint operates upon a profession as distinguished

from a business is, of course, relevant in determining whether that particular restraint violates the Sherman Act. It would be unrealistic to view
the practice of professions as interchangeable with other business activities, and automatically to apply to the professions antitrust concepts which
originated in other areas. The public service aspect, and other features
of the professions, may require that a particular practice, which could

or potential competitors to get and verify information aboutthe price and availability of services magnifies the dangers to
competition associated with misleading advertising. Whatis more, the quality of professional services tends to resist
either calibration or monitoring by individual patients or cli-ents, partly because of the specialized knowledge required to
evaluate the services, and partly because of the difficulty indetermining whether, and the degree to which, an outcome
is attributable to the quality of services (like a poor job oftooth filling) or to something else (like a very tough walnut).

berg ed. 1980) (describing long-term relationship betweenprofessional and client not as "a series of spot contracts" but

rather as "a long-term agreement, often implicit, to deal witheach other in a set of future unspecified or incompletely specified circumstances according to certain rules," and adding
that "[i]t is not clear how or if these [implicit contracts] canbe reconciled with the promotion of effective price competition in individual spot markets for particular services").The existence of such significant challenges to informed decisionmaking by the customer for professional services imme-diately suggests that advertising restrictions arguably protecting patients from misleading or irrelevant advertising
call for more than cursory treatment as obviously comparable to classic horizontal agreements to limit output or price
competition.

The explanation proffered by the Court of Appeals for
the likely anticompetitive effect of the CDA's restrictions on
discount advertising began with the unexceptionable statements that "price advertising is fundamental to price competition," 128 F. 3d, at 727, and that "[r]estrictions on the ability to advertise prices normally make it more difficult for
consumers to find a lower price and for dentists to compete
on the basis of price," ibid. (citing Bates v. State Bar of Ariz.,
433 U. S. 350, 364 (1977); Morales v. Trans World Airlines,
Inc., 504 U. S. 374, 388 (1992)). The court then acknowledged that, according to the CDA, the restrictions nonetheless furthered the "legitimate, indeed procompetitive, goal
of preventing false and misleading price advertising." 128
F. 3d, at 728. The Court of Appeals might, at this juncture,
have recognized that the restrictions at issue here are very
far from a total ban on price or discount advertising, and
might have considered the possibility that the particular restrictions on professional advertising could have different effects from those "normally" found in the commercial world,
even to the point of promoting competition by reducing the
occurrence of unverifiable and misleading across-the-board

Opinion of the Court
discount advertising.11 Instead, the Court of Appeals confined itself to the brief assertion that the "CDA's disclosure
requirements appear to prohibit across-the-board discounts
because it is simply infeasible to disclose all of the information that is required," ibid., followed by the observation that
"the record provides no evidence that the rule has in fact led
to increased disclosure and transparency of dental pricing,"
ibid.

But these observations brush over the professional context and describe no anticompetitive effects. Assuming that
the record in fact supports the conclusion that the CDA disclosure rules essentially bar advertisement of across-theboard discounts, it does not obviously follow that such a ban
would have a net anticompetitive effect here. Whether advertisements that announced discounts for, say, first-time
customers, would be less effective at conveying information
relevant to competition if they listed the original and discounted prices for checkups, X-rays, and fillings, than they
would be if they simply specified a percentage discount
across the board, seems to us a question susceptible to empirical but not a priori analysis. In a suspicious world, the
discipline of specific example may well be a necessary condition of plausibility for professional claims that for all practical purposes defy comparison shopping. It is also possible
in principle that, even if across-the-board discount advertisements were more effective in drawing customers in the short
run, the recurrence of some measure of intentional or accidental misstatement due to the breadth of their claims might

11 Justice Breyer claims that "the Court of Appeals did consider the
relevant differences." Post, at 790. But the language he cites says nothing more than that per se analysis is inappropriate here and that "some
caution" was appropriate where restrictions purported to restrict false
advertising, see 128 F. 3d, at 726-727. Caution was of course appropriate,
but this statement by the Court of Appeals does not constitute a consideration of the possible differences between these and other advertising
restrictions.

leak out over time to make potential patients skeptical ofany such across-the-board advertising, so undercutting the

method's effectiveness. Cf. Akerlof, 84 Q. J. Econ., at 495(explaining that "dishonest dealings tend to drive honest
dealings out of the market"). It might be, too, that across-the-board discount advertisements would continue to attract
business indefinitely, but might work precisely because theywere misleading customers, and thus just because their effect would be anticompetitive, not procompetitive. Put an-other way, the CDA's rule appears to reflect the prediction
that any costs to competition associated with the eliminationof across-the-board advertising will be outweighed by gains
to consumer information (and hence competition) created bydiscount advertising that is exact, accurate, and more easily
verifiable (at least by regulators). As a matter of economicsthis view may or may not be correct, but it is not implausible,
and neither a court nor the Commission may initially dismissit as presumptively wrong.

12

In theory, it is true, the Court of Appeals neither ruledout the plausibility of some procompetitive support for the

CDA's requirements nor foreclosed the utility of an eviden-tiary discussion on the point. The court indirectly acknowledged the plausibility of procompetitive justifications for the

12 Justice Breyer suggests that our analysis is "of limited relevance,"
post, at 791, because "[t]he basic question is whether this . . . theoretically
redeeming virtue in fact offsets the restrictions' anticompetitive effects in
this case," ibid. He thinks that the Commission and the Court of Appeals
"adequately answered that question," ibid., but the absence of any empirical evidence on this point indicates that the question was not answered,
merely avoided by implicit burden shifting of the kind accepted by Justice Breyer. The point is that before a theoretical claim of anticompetitive effects can justify shifting to a defendant the burden to show empirical evidence of procompetitive effects, as quick-look analysis in effect
requires, there must be some indication that the court making the decision
has properly identified the theoretical basis for the anticompetitive effects
and considered whether the effects actually are anticompetitive. Where,
as here, the circumstances of the restriction are somewhat complex, assumption alone will not do.

Opinion of the Court
CDA's position when it stated that "the record provides noevidence that the rule has in fact led to increased disclosure

and transparency of dental pricing," 128 F. 3d, at 728. Butbecause petitioner alone would have had the incentive to introduce such evidence, the statement sounds as though the
Court of Appeals may have thought it was justified withoutfurther analysis to shift a burden to the CDA to adduce hard

evidence of the procompetitive nature of its policy; thecourt's adversion to empirical evidence at the moment of
this implicit burden shifting underscores the leniency of itsenquiry into evidence of the restrictions' anticompetitive
effects.

The Court of Appeals was comparably tolerant in accepting the sufficiency of abbreviated rule-of-reason analysis as
to the nonprice advertising restrictions. The court began
with the argument that "[t]hese restrictions are in effect a
form of output limitation, as they restrict the supply of information about individual dentists' services." Ibid. (citing P.
Areeda & H. Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law || 1505, pp. 693-694
(1997 Supp.)). Although this sentence does indeed appear
as cited, it is puzzling, given that the relevant output for
antitrust purposes here is presumably not information or advertising, but dental services themselves. The question is
not whether the universe of possible advertisements has
been limited (as assuredly it has), but whether the limitation
on advertisements obviously tends to limit the total delivery
of dental services. The court came closest to addressing
this latter question when it went on to assert that limiting
advertisements regarding quality and safety "prevents dentists from fully describing the package of services they
offer," 128 F. 3d, at 728, adding that "[t]he restrictions may
also affect output more directly, as quality and comfort advertising may induce some customers to obtain nonemergency care when they might not otherwise do so," ibid.
This suggestion about output is also puzzling. If quality advertising actually induces some patients to obtain more care

Opinion of the Court
than they would in its absence, then restricting such adver-tising would reduce the demand for dental services, not the

supply; and it is of course the producers' supply of a good inrelation to demand that is normally relevant in determining
whether a producer-imposed output limitation has the anti-competitive effect of artificially raising prices,

13 see General

Leaseways, Inc. v. National Truck Leasing Assn., 744 F. 2d588, 594-595 (CA7 1984) ("An agreement on output also

equates to a price-fixing agreement. If firms raise price, themarket's demand for their product will fall, so the amount
supplied will fall too--in other words, output will be re-stricted. If instead the firms restrict output directly, price
will as mentioned rise in order to limit demand to the re-duced supply. Thus, with exceptions not relevant here, raising price, reducing output, and dividing markets have thesame anticompetitive effects").

Although the Court of Appeals acknowledged the CDA'sview that "claims about quality are inherently unverifiable
and therefore misleading," 128 F. 3d, at 728, it respondedthat this concern "does not justify banning all quality claims
without regard to whether they are, in fact, false or mislead-ing,"

ibid. As a result, the court said, "the restriction is asufficiently naked restraint on output to justify quick look

analysis." Ibid. The court assumed, in these words, thatsome dental quality claims may escape justifiable censure,
because they are both verifiable and true. But its implicit

13 Justice Breyer wonders if we "mea[n] this statement as an argument against the anticompetitive tendencies that flow from an agreement
not to advertise service quality." Post, at 791. But as the preceding sentence shows, we intend simply to question the logic of the Court of Appeals's suggestion that the restrictions are anticompetitive because they
somehow "affect output," 128 F. 3d, at 728, presumably with the intent to
raise prices by limiting supply while demand remains constant. We do
not mean to deny that an agreement not to advertise service quality might
have anticompetitive effects. We merely mean that, absent further analysis of the kind Justice Breyer undertakes, it is not possible to conclude that the net effect of this particular restriction is anticompetitive.

Opinion of the Court
assumption fails to explain why it gave no weight to the
countervailing, and at least equally plausible, suggestion that
restricting difficult-to-verify claims about quality or patient
comfort would have a procompetitive effect by preventing
misleading or false claims that distort the market. It is, indeed, entirely possible to understand the CDA's restrictions
on unverifiable quality and comfort advertising as nothing
more than a procompetitive ban on puffery, cf. Bates, 433
U. S., at 366 (claims relating to the quality of legal services
"probably are not susceptible of precise measurement or
verification and, under some circumstances, might well be
deceptive or misleading to the public, or even false"); id.,
at 383-384 ("[A]dvertising claims as to the quality of services . . . are not susceptible of measurement or verification; accordingly, such claims may be so likely to be misleading as to warrant restriction"), notwithstanding Justice
Breyer's citation (to a Commission discussion that never
faces the issue of the unverifiability of professional quality
claims, raised in Bates), post, at 785.14

The point is not that the CDA's restrictions necessarily
have the procompetitive effect claimed by the CDA; it is possible that banning quality claims might have no effect at all
on competitiveness if, for example, many dentists made very
much the same sort of claims. And it is also of course possible that the restrictions might in the final analysis be anticompetitive. The point, rather, is that the plausibility of
competing claims about the effects of the professional advertising restrictions rules out the indulgently abbreviated
review to which the Commission's order was treated. The
obvious anticompetitive effect that triggers abbreviated
analysis has not been shown.

14 The Commission said only that " `mere puffing' deceives no one and
has never been subject to regulation." 121 F. T. C., at 318. The question
here, of course, is not whether puffery may be subject to governmental
regulation, but whether a professional organization may ban it.

Opinion of the Court
In light of our focus on the adequacy of the Court of Ap-peals's analysis,

Justice Breyer's thorough-going, de novo
antitrust analysis contains much to impress on its own meritsbut little to demonstrate the sufficiency of the Court of Appeals's review. The obligation to give a more deliberate look
than a quick one does not arise at the door of this Court andshould not be satisfied here in the first instance. Had the

Court of Appeals engaged in a painstaking discussion in aleague with

Justice Breyer's (compare his 14 pages with
the Ninth Circuit's 8), and had it confronted the comparabil-ity of these restrictions to bars on clearly verifiable advertising, its reasoning might have sufficed to justify its conclusion.
Certainly Justice Breyer's treatment of the antitrust issues here is no "quick look." Lingering is more like it, and
indeed Justice Breyer, not surprisingly, stops short of endorsing the Court of Appeals's discussion as adequate to the
task at hand.

Saying here that the Court of Appeals's conclusion at least
required a more extended examination of the possible factual
underpinnings than it received is not, of course, necessarily
to call for the fullest market analysis. Although we have
said that a challenge to a "naked restraint on price and output" need not be supported by "a detailed market analysis"
in order to "requir[e] some competitive justification," National Collegiate Athletic Assn., 468 U. S., at 110, it does not
follow that every case attacking a less obviously anticompetitive restraint (like this one) is a candidate for plenary market
examination. The truth is that our categories of analysis of
anticompetitive effect are less fixed than terms like "per se,"
"quick look," and "rule of reason" tend to make them appear.
We have recognized, for example, that "there is often no
bright line separating per se from Rule of Reason analysis,"
since "considerable inquiry into market conditions" may be
required before the application of any so-called "per se" condemnation is justified. Id., at 104, n. 26. "[W]hether the
ultimate finding is the product of a presumption or actual

market analysis, the essential inquiry remains the same--whether or not the challenged restraint enhances competition." Id., at 104. Indeed, the scholar who enriched anti-trust law with the metaphor of "the twinkling of an eye" for
the most condensed rule-of-reason analysis himself cautionedagainst the risk of misleading even in speaking of a "spectrum" of adequate reasonableness analysis for passing uponantitrust claims: "There is always something of a sliding
scale in appraising reasonableness, but the sliding scale for-mula deceptively suggests greater precision than we can
hope for. . . . Nevertheless, the quality of proof requiredshould vary with the circumstances." P. Areeda, Antitrust
Law || 1507, p. 402 (1986).15 At the same time, ProfessorAreeda also emphasized the necessity, particularly great in
the quasi-common law realm of antitrust, that courts explainthe logic of their conclusions. "By exposing their reasoning,
judges . . . are subjected to others' critical analyses, whichin turn can lead to better understanding for the future."
Id., || 1500, at 364. As the circumstances here demonstrate,there is generally no categorical line to be drawn between

15 Other commentators have expressed similar views. See, e. g., Kolasky, Counterpoint: The Department of Justice's "Stepwise" Approach
Imposes Too Heavy a Burden on Parties to Horizontal Agreements, Antitrust 41, 43 (spring 1998) ("[I]n applying the rule of reason, the courts, as
with any balancing test, use a sliding scale to determine how much proof
to require"); Piraino, Making Sense of the Rule of Reason: A New Standard for Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 47 Vand. L. Rev. 1753, 1771 (1994)
("[C]ourts will have to undertake varying degrees of inquiry depending
upon the type of restraint at issue. The legality of certain restraints will
be easy to determine because their competitive effects are obvious.
Other restrictions will require a more detailed analysis because their competitive impact is more ambiguous"). But see Klein, A "Stepwise" Approach for Analyzing Horizontal Agreements Will Provide a Much Needed
Structure for Antitrust Review, Antitrust 41, 42 (spring 1990) (examination of procompetitive justifications "is by no means a full scrutiny of the
proffered efficiency justification. It is, rather, a hard look at the justification to determine if it meets the defendant's burden of coming forward
with--but not establishing--a valid efficiency justification").

restraints that give rise to an intuitively obvious inference
of anticompetitive effect and those that call for more detailed
treatment. What is required, rather, is an enquiry meet for
the case, looking to the circumstances, details, and logic of a
restraint. The object is to see whether the experience of
the market has been so clear, or necessarily will be, that a
confident conclusion about the principal tendency of a restriction will follow from a quick (or at least quicker) look, in
place of a more sedulous one. And of course what we see
may vary over time, if rule-of-reason analyses in case after
case reach identical conclusions. For now, at least, a less
quick look was required for the initial assessment of the
tendency of these professional advertising restrictions. Because the Court of Appeals did not scrutinize the assumption
of relative anticompetitive tendencies, we vacate the judgment and remand the case for a fuller consideration of the
issue. It is so ordered.

Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice
Kennedy, and Justice Ginsburg join, concurring in part
and dissenting in part.

I agree with the Court that the Federal Trade Commission
(FTC or Commission) has jurisdiction over petitioner, and
I join Parts I and II of its opinion. I also agree that in
a "rule of reason" antitrust case "the quality of proof required should vary with the circumstances," that "[w]hat is
required . . . is an enquiry meet for the case," and that the
object is a "confident conclusion about the principal tendency
of a restriction." Ante, at 780 and this page (internal quotation marks omitted). But I do not agree that the Court has
properly applied those unobjectionable principles here. In
my view, a traditional application of the rule of reason to
the facts as found by the Commission requires affirming the
Commission--just as the Court of Appeals did below.

Opinion of Breyer, J.

I
The Commission's conclusion is lawful if its "factual findings," insofar as they are supported by "substantial evidence," "make out a violation of Sherman Act $ 1." FTC
v. Indiana Federation of Dentists, 476 U. S. 447, 454-455
(1986). To determine whether that is so, I would not simply
ask whether the restraints at issue are anticompetitive overall. Rather, like the Court of Appeals (and the Commission), I would break that question down into four classical,
subsidiary antitrust questions: (1) What is the specific restraint at issue? (2) What are its likely anticompetitive effects? (3) Are there offsetting procompetitive justifications? (4) Do the parties have sufficient market power to
make a difference?

A

The most important question is the first: What are the
specific restraints at issue? See, e. g., National Collegiate
Athletic Assn. v. Board of Regents of Univ. of Okla., 468
U. S. 85, 98-100 (1984) (NCAA); Broadcast Music, Inc. v.
Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 441 U. S. 1, 21-23
(1979). Those restraints do not include merely the agreement to which the California Dental Association's (Dental
Association or Association) ethical rule literally refers,
namely, a promise to refrain from advertising that is " `false
or misleading in any material respect.' " Ante, at 760 (quoting California Dental Code of Ethics $ 10 (1993), App. 33).
Instead, the Commission found a set of restraints arising
out of the way the Dental Association implemented this
innocent-sounding ethical rule in practice, through advisory opinions, guidelines, enforcement policies, and review of
membership applications. In re California Dental Assn.,
121 F. T. C. 190 (1996). As implemented, the ethical rule
reached beyond its nominal target, to prevent truthful and
nondeceptive advertising. In particular, the Commission
determined that the rule, in practice:

526US3 Unit: $U62 [12-11-00 21:59:59] PAGES PGT: OPIN

783Cite as: 526 U. S. 756 (1999)
Opinion of Breyer, J.
(1) "precluded advertising that characterized a dentist'sfees as being low, reasonable, or affordable,"

id., at 301;

(2) "precluded advertising . . . of across the board dis-counts,"

ibid.; and

(3) "prohibit[ed] all quality claims," id., at 308.

Whether the Dental Association's basic rule as implemented actually restrained the truthful and nondeceptive ad-vertising of low prices, across-the-board discounts, and quality service are questions of fact. The Administrative Law
Judge (ALJ) and the Commission may have found those
questions difficult ones. But both the ALJ and the Commission ultimately found against the Dental Association in
respect to these facts. And the question for us--whether
those agency findings are supported by substantial evidence,
see Indiana Federation, supra, at 454-455--is not difficult.

The Court of Appeals referred explicitly to some of the
evidence that it found adequate to support the Commission's
conclusions. It pointed out, for example, that the Dental
Association's "advisory opinions and guidelines indicate
that . . . descriptions of prices as `reasonable' or `low' do not
comply" with the Association's rule; that in "numerous cases"
the Association "advised members of objections to special
offers, senior citizen discounts, and new patient discounts,
apparently without regard to their truth"; and that one advisory opinion "expressly states that claims as to the quality
of services are inherently likely to be false or misleading,"
all "without any particular consideration of whether" such
statements were "true or false." 128 F. 3d 720, 729 (CA9
1997).

The Commission itself had before it far more evidence. It
referred to instances in which the Association, without regard for the truthfulness of the statements at issue, recommended denial of membership to dentists wishing to advertise, for example, "reasonable fees quoted in advance,"
"major savings," or "making teeth cleaning . . . inexpensive."

Opinion of Breyer, J.
121 F. T. C., at 301. It referred to testimony that "across-the-board discount advertising in literal compliance with the

requirements `would probably take two pages in the tele-phone book' and `[n]obody is going to really advertise in that
fashion.' " Id., at 302. And it pointed to many instances inwhich the Dental Association suppressed such advertising
claims as "we guarantee all dental work for 1 year," "latestin cosmetic dentistry," and "gentle dentistry in a caring environment." Id., at 308-310.I need not review the evidence further, for this Court has
said that "substantial evidence" is a matter for the courts ofappeals, and that it "will intervene only in what ought to be
the rare instance when the standard appears to have beenmisapprehended or grossly misapplied." Universal Camera
Corp. v. NLRB, 340 U. S. 474, 490-491 (1951). I have saidenough to make clear that this is not a case warranting our
intervention. Consequently, we must decide only the basiclegal question whether the three restraints described above
unreasonably restrict competition.

B
Do each of the three restrictions mentioned have "the po-tential for genuine adverse effects on competition"?

Indiana Federation, 476 U. S., at 460; 7 P. Areeda, Antitrust Law|| 1503a, pp. 372-377 (1986) (hereinafter Areeda). I should

have thought that the anticompetitive tendencies of the threerestrictions were obvious. An agreement not to advertise
that a fee is reasonable, that service is inexpensive, or thata customer will receive a discount makes it more difficult for
a dentist to inform customers that he charges a lower price.If the customer does not know about a lower price, he will
find it more difficult to buy lower price service. That fact,in turn, makes it less likely that a dentist will obtain more
customers by offering lower prices. And that likelihoodmeans that dentists will prove less likely to offer lower
prices. But why should I have to spell out the obvious? To

restrain truthful advertising about lower prices is likely torestrict competition in respect to price--"the central nervous system of the economy." United States v. SoconyVacuum Oil Co., 310 U. S. 150, 226, n. 59 (1940); cf., e. g.,
Bates v. State Bar of Ariz., 433 U. S. 350, 364 (1977) (price
advertising plays an "indispensable role in the allocation ofresources in a free enterprise system");

Virginia Bd. of
Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425U. S. 748, 765 (1976). The Commission thought this fact sufficient to hold (in the alternative) that the price advertisingrestrictions were unlawful

per se. See 121 F. T. C., at 307;
cf. Socony-Vacuum, supra, at 222-228 (finding agreement
among competitors to buy "spot-market oil" unlawful per se
because of its tendency to restrict price competition). For
present purposes, I need not decide whether the Commission
was right in applying a per se rule. I need only assume a
rule of reason applies, and note the serious anticompetitive
tendencies of the price advertising restraints.

The restrictions on the advertising of service quality also
have serious anticompetitive tendencies. This is not a case
of "mere puffing," as the FTC recognized. See 121 F. T. C.,
at 317-318; cf. ante, at 778. The days of my youth, when the
billboards near Emeryville, California, home of AAA baseball's Oakland Oaks, displayed the name of "Painless" Parker,
Dentist, are long gone--along with the Oakland Oaks. But
some parents may still want to know that a particular dentist
makes a point of "gentle care." Others may want to know
about 1-year dental work guarantees. To restrict that kind
of service quality advertisement is to restrict competition
over the quality of service itself, for, unless consumers know,
they may not purchase, and dentists may not compete to supply that which will make little difference to the demand for
their services. That, at any rate, is the theory of the Sherman Act. And it is rather late in the day for anyone to deny
the significant anticompetitive tendencies of an agreement
that restricts competition in any legitimate respect, see, e. g.,

Opinion of Breyer, J.
Paramount Famous Lasky Corp. v. United States, 282 U. S.30, 43 (1930); United States v. First Nat. Pictures, Inc., 282

U. S. 44, 54-55 (1930), let alone one that inhibits customersfrom learning about the quality of a dentist's service.

Nor did the Commission rely solely on the unobjectionableproposition that a restriction on the ability of dentists to advertise on quality is likely to limit their incentive to competeon quality. Rather, the Commission pointed to record
evidence affirmatively establishing that quality-based com-petition is important to dental consumers in California. 121
F. T. C., at 309-311. Unsurprisingly, these consumerschoose dental services based at least in part on "information
about the type and quality of service." Id., at 249. Simi-larly, as the Commission noted, the ALJ credited testimony
to the effect that "advertising the comfort of services will`absolutely' bring in more patients," and, conversely, that restraining the ability to advertise based on quality would de-crease the number of patients that a dentist could attract.
Id., at 310. Finally, the Commission looked to the testimonyof dentists who themselves had suffered adverse effects on
their business when forced by petitioner to discontinue ad-vertising quality of care. See

id., at 310-311.The FTC found that the price advertising restrictions

amounted to a "naked attempt to eliminate price competi-tion." Id., at 300. It found that the service quality advertising restrictions "deprive consumers of information theyvalue and of healthy competition for their patronage."

Id.,at 311. It added that the "anticompetitive nature of these

restrictions" was "plain." Ibid. The Court of Appealsagreed. I do not believe it possible to deny the anticompetitive tendencies I have mentioned.

C
We must also ask whether, despite their anticompetitivetendencies, these restrictions might be justified by other procompetitive tendencies or redeeming virtues. See 7 Areeda,

787Cite as: 526 U. S. 756 (1999)
Opinion of Breyer, J.
|| 1504, at 377-383. This is a closer question--at least in the-ory. The Dental Association argues that the three relevant

restrictions are inextricably tied to a legitimate Associationeffort to restrict false or misleading advertising. The Association, the argument goes, had to prevent dentists from engaging in the kind of truthful, nondeceptive advertising thatit banned in order effectively to stop dentists from making

unverifiable claims about price or service quality, whichclaims would mislead the consumer.

The problem with this or any similar argument is an em-pirical one. Notwithstanding its theoretical plausibility, the
record does not bear out such a claim. The Commission,
which is expert in the area of false and misleading advertising, was uncertain whether petitioner had even made the
claim. It characterized petitioner's efficiencies argument as
rooted in the (unproved) factual assertion that its ethical rule
"challenges only advertising that is false or misleading."
121 F. T. C., at 316 (emphasis added). Regardless, the Court
of Appeals wrote, in respect to the price restrictions, that
"the record provides no evidence that the rule has in fact led
to increased disclosure and transparency of dental pricing."
128 F. 3d, at 728. With respect to quality advertising, the
Commission stressed that the Association "offered no convincing argument, let alone evidence, that consumers of dental services have been, or are likely to be, harmed by the
broad categories of advertising it restricts." 121 F. T. C., at
319. Nor did the Court of Appeals think that the Association's unsubstantiated contention that "claims about quality
are inherently unverifiable and therefore misleading" could
"justify banning all quality claims without regard to whether
they are, in fact, false or misleading." 128 F. 3d, at 728.

With one exception, my own review of the record reveals
no significant evidentiary support for the proposition that
the Association's members must agree to ban truthful price
and quality advertising in order to stop untruthful claims.
The one exception is the obvious fact that one can stop un526US3 Unit: $U62 [12-11-00 21:59:59] PAGES PGT: OPIN

truthful advertising if one prohibits all advertising. Butsince the Association made virtually no effort to sift the false

from the true, see 121 F. T. C., at 316-317, that fact does notmake out a valid antitrust defense. See NCAA, 468 U. S.,
at 119; 7 Areeda, || 1505, at 383-384.In the usual Sherman Act $ 1 case, the defendant bears the
burden of establishing a procompetitive justification. See
National Soc. of Professional Engineers v. United States,435 U. S. 679, 695 (1978); 7 Areeda, || 1507b, at 397; 11 H.

Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law || 1914c, pp. 313-315 (1998); seealso Law v. National Collegiate Athletic Assn., 134 F. 3d
1010, 1019 (CA10), cert. denied, 525 U. S. 822 (1998); United
States v. Brown Univ., 5 F. 3d 658, 669 (CA3 1993); CapitalImaging Associates v. Mohawk Valley Medical Associates,

Inc., 996 F. 2d 537, 543 (CA2), cert. denied, 510 U. S. 947(1993); Kreuzer v. American Academy of Periodontology,
735 F. 2d 1479, 1492-1495 (CADC 1984). And the Court ofAppeals was correct when it concluded that no such justification had been established here.

D
I shall assume that the Commission must prove one addi-tional circumstance, namely, that the Association's restraints

would likely have made a real difference in the marketplace.See 7 Areeda, || 1503, at 376-377. The Commission, disagreeing with the ALJ on this single point, found that theAssociation did possess enough market power to make a
difference. In at least one region of California, the mid-peninsula, its members accounted for more than 90% of the
marketplace; on average they accounted for 75%. See 121F. T. C., at 314. In addition, entry by new dentists into
the marketplace is fairly difficult. Dental education is ex-pensive (leaving graduates of dental school with $50,000-
$100,000 of debt), as is opening a new dentistry office (whichcosts $75,000-$100,000).

Id., at 315-316. And Dental Asso-ciation members believe membership in the Association is

526US3 Unit: $U62 [12-11-00 21:59:59] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of Breyer, J.
important and valuable and recognized as such by the public.Id., at 312-313, 315-316.

These facts, in the Court of Appeals' view, were sufficientto show "enough market power to harm competition through
[the Association's] standard setting in the area of advertis-ing." 128 F. 3d, at 730. And that conclusion is correct.
Restrictions on advertising price discounts in Palo Alto maymake a difference because potential patients may not respond readily to discount advertising by the handful (10%)of dentists who are not members of the Association. And
that fact, in turn, means that the remaining 90% will proveless likely to engage in price competition. Facts such as
these have previously led this Court to find market power--unless the defendant has overcome the showing with strong
contrary evidence. See, e. g., Indiana Federation, 476 U. S.,at 456-457; cf. United States v. Loew's Inc., 371 U. S. 38,
45 (1962); Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U. S. 294,341-344 (1962); accord, United States v. Aluminum Co. of
America, 148 F. 2d 416, 424 (CA2 1945). I can find no reasonfor departing from that precedent here.

II
In the Court's view, the legal analysis conducted by theCourt of Appeals was insufficient, and the Court remands

the case for a more thorough application of the rule of reason.But in what way did the Court of Appeals fail? I find the
Court's answers to this question unsatisfactory--when onedivides the overall Sherman Act question into its traditional
component parts and adheres to traditional judicial practicefor allocating the burdens of persuasion in an antitrust case.

Did the Court of Appeals misconceive the anticompetitivetendencies of the restrictions? After all, the object of the
rule of reason is to separate those restraints that "may sup-press or even destroy competition" from those that "merely
regulat[e] and perhaps thereby promot[e] competition."Board of Trade of Chicago v. United States, 246 U. S. 231,

526US3 Unit: $U62 [12-11-00 21:59:59] PAGES PGT: OPIN
790 CALIFORNIA DENTAL ASSN. v. FTC

Opinion of Breyer, J.
238 (1918). The majority says that the Association's "advertising restrictions might plausibly be thought to have a net
procompetitive effect, or possibly no effect at all on competition." Ante, at 771. It adds that

"advertising restrictions arguably protecting patients
from misleading or irrelevant advertising call for more
than cursory treatment as obviously comparable to classic horizontal agreements to limit output or price competition." Ante, at 773.

And it criticizes the Court of Appeals for failing to recognize
that "the restrictions at issue here are very far from a total
ban on price or discount advertising" and that "the particular restrictions on professional advertising could have different effects from those `normally' found in the commercial
world, even to the point of promoting competition . . . ."
Ibid.

The problem with these statements is that the Court of
Appeals did consider the relevant differences. It rejected
the legal "treatment" customarily applied "to classic horizontal agreements to limit output or price competition"--i. e.,
the FTC's (alternative) per se approach. See 128 F. 3d, at
726-727. It did so because the Association's "policies do not,
on their face, ban truthful nondeceptive ads"; instead, they
"have been enforced in a way that restricts truthful advertising," id., at 727. It added that "[t]he value of restricting
false advertising . . . counsels some caution in attacking rules
that purport to do so but merely sweep too broadly." Ibid.

Did the Court of Appeals misunderstand the nature of an
anticompetitive effect? The Court says:

"If quality advertising actually induces some patients to
obtain more care than they would in its absence, then
restricting such advertising would reduce the demand
for dental services, not the supply; and . . . the producers' supply . . . is normally relevant in determining

526US3 Unit: $U62 [12-11-00 21:59:59] PAGES PGT: OPIN

791Cite as: 526 U. S. 756 (1999)
Opinion of Breyer, J.
whether a . . . limitation has the anticompetitive effectof artificially raising prices." Ante, at 776-777.

But if the Court means this statement as an argumentagainst the anticompetitive tendencies that flow from an
agreement not to advertise service quality, I believe it is themajority, and not the Court of Appeals, that is mistaken.
An agreement not to advertise, say, "gentle care" is anticom-petitive because it imposes an artificial barrier against each
dentist's independent decision to advertise gentle care.That barrier, in turn, tends to inhibit those dentists who
want to supply gentle care from getting together with thosecustomers who want to buy gentle care. See P. Areeda &
H. Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law || 1505*, p. 404 (Supp. 1998).There is adequate reason to believe that tendency present in
this case. See supra, at 786.Did the Court of Appeals inadequately consider possible
procompetitive justifications? The Court seems to think so,for it says:

"[T]he [Association's] rule appears to reflect the predic-tion that any costs to competition associated with the
elimination of across-the-board advertising will be out-weighed by gains to consumer information (and hence
competition) created by discount advertising that isexact, accurate, and more easily verifiable (at least by
regulators)." Ante, at 775.
That may or may not be an accurate assessment of the Asso-ciation's motives in adopting its rule, but it is of limited relevance. Cf. Board of Trade of Chicago, supra, at 238. Thebasic question is whether this, or some other, theoretically
redeeming virtue in fact offsets the restrictions' anticom-petitive effects in this case. Both court and Commission
adequately answered that question.The Commission found that the defendant did not make
the necessary showing that a redeeming virtue existed inpractice. See 121 F. T. C., at 319-320. The Court of Ap526US3 Unit: $U62 [12-11-00 21:59:59] PAGES PGT: OPIN
792 CALIFORNIA DENTAL ASSN. v. FTC

Opinion of Breyer, J.
peals, asking whether the rules, as enforced, "augment[ed]competition and increase[d] market efficiency," found the

Commission's conclusion supported by substantial evidence.128 F. 3d, at 728. That is why the court said that "the
record provides no evidence that the rule has in fact led to
increased disclosure and transparency of dental pricing"--which is to say that the record provides no evidence that the

effects, though anticompetitive, are nonetheless redeemed orjustified.

Ibid.
The majority correctly points out that "petitioner alonewould have had the incentive to introduce such evidence" of

procompetitive justification. Ante, at 776. (Indeed, that is
one of the reasons defendants normally bear the burden of
persuasion about redeeming virtues. See supra, at 788.)
But despite this incentive, petitioner's brief in this Court
offers nothing concrete to counter the Commission's conclusion that the record does not support the claim of justification. Petitioner's failure to produce such evidence itself
"explain[s] why [the lower court] gave no weight to the . . .
suggestion that restricting difficult-to-verify claims about
quality or patient comfort would have a procompetitive effect by preventing misleading or false claims that distort the
market." Ante, at 778.

With respect to the restraint on advertising across-theboard discounts, the majority summarizes its concerns as follows: "Assuming that the record in fact supports the conclusion that the [Association's] disclosure rules essentially bar
advertisement of [such] discounts, it does not obviously follow that such a ban would have a net anticompetitive effect
here." Ante, at 774. I accept, rather than assume, the
premise: The FTC found that the disclosure rules did bar
advertisement of across-the-board discounts, and that finding
is supported by substantial evidence. See supra, at 783-
784. And I accept as literally true the conclusion that the
Court says follows from that premise, namely, that "net anticompetitive effects" do not "obviously" follow from that

793Cite as: 526 U. S. 756 (1999)
Opinion of Breyer, J.
premise. But obviousness is not the point. With respectto any of the three restraints found by the Commission,

whether "net anticompetitive effects" follow is a matter ofhow the Commission, and, here, the Court of Appeals, have
answered the questions I laid out at the beginning. See
supra, at 782. Has the Commission shown that the restric-tion has anticompetitive tendencies? It has. Has the Association nonetheless shown offsetting virtues? It has not.Has the Commission shown market power sufficient for it
to believe that the restrictions will likely make a real worlddifference? It has.

The upshot, in my view, is that the Court of Appeals,
applying ordinary antitrust principles, reached an unexceptional conclusion. It is the same legal conclusion that this
Court itself reached in Indiana Federation--a much closer
case than this one. There the Court found that an agreement by dentists not to submit dental X rays to insurers
violated the rule of reason. The anticompetitive tendency
of that agreement was to reduce competition among dentists
in respect to their willingness to submit X rays to insurers,
see 476 U. S., at 456--a matter in respect to which consumers
are relatively indifferent, as compared to advertising of price
discounts and service quality, the matters at issue here.
The redeeming virtue in Indiana Federation was the alleged
undesirability of having insurers consider a range of matters
when deciding whether treatment was justified--a virtue no
less plausible, and no less proved, than the virtue offered
here. See id., at 462-464. The "power" of the dentists to
enforce their agreement was no greater than that at issue
here (control of 75% to 90% of the relevant markets). See
id., at 460. It is difficult to see how the two cases can be
reconciled.

* * *
I would note that the form of analysis I have followed is
not rigid; it admits of some variation according to the circumstances. The important point, however, is that its allocation

Opinion of Breyer, J.
of the burdens of persuasion reflects a gradual evolutionwithin the courts over a period of many years. That evolution represents an effort carefully to blend the procompeti-tive objectives of the law of antitrust with administrative
necessity. It represents a considerable advance, both fromthe days when the Commission had to present and/or refute
every possible fact and theory, and from antitrust theoriesso abbreviated as to prevent proper analysis. The former
prevented cases from ever reaching a conclusion, cf. Bok,Section 7 of the Clayton Act and the Merging of Law and
Economics, 74 Harv. L. Rev. 226, 266 (1960), and the lattercalled forth the criticism that the "Government always
wins," United States v. Von's Grocery Co., 384 U. S. 270, 301(1966) (Stewart, J., dissenting). I hope that this case does
not represent an abandonment of that basic, and important,form of analysis.

For these reasons, I respectfully dissent from Part III ofthe Court's opinion.

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 97-1008. Argued February 24, 1999--Decided May 24, 1999
After suffering a stroke and losing her job, petitioner Cleveland sought

and obtained Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits,
claiming that she was unable to work due to her disability. The week
before her SSDI award, she filed suit under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), contending that her former employer, respondent Policy Management Systems Corporation, had discriminated against
her on account of her disability. In granting Policy Management Systems summary judgment, the District Court concluded that Cleveland's
claim that she was totally disabled for SSDI purposes estopped her from
proving an essential element of her ADA claim, namely, that she could
"perform the essential functions" of her job, at least with "reasonable . . .
accommodation," 42 U. S. C. $ 12111(8). The Fifth Circuit affirmed,
holding that the application for, or receipt of, SSDI benefits creates a
rebuttable presumption that a recipient is estopped from pursuing an
ADA claim and that Cleveland failed to rebut the presumption.

Held:

1. Pursuit, and receipt, of SSDI benefits does not automatically estop
a recipient from pursuing an ADA claim or erect a strong presumption against the recipient's ADA success. However, to survive a summary judgment motion, an ADA plaintiff cannot ignore her SSDI contention that she was too disabled to work, but must explain why that
contention is consistent with her ADA claim that she can perform the
essential functions of her job, at least with reasonable accommodation.
Pp. 801-807.

(a) Despite the appearance of conflict between the SSDI program
(which provides benefits to a person with a disability so severe that she
is unable to do her previous work or any other kind of substantial gainful work) and the ADA (which prohibits covered employers from discriminating against a disabled person who can perform the essential
functions of her job, including those who can do so only with reasonable
accommodation), the two claims do not inherently conflict to the point
where courts should apply a special negative presumption such as the
one applied below. There are many situations in which an SSDI claim
and an ADA claim can comfortably exist side by side. For example,

526US3 Unit: $U63 [12-11-00 22:03:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN
796 CLEVELAND v. POLICY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS CORP.

Syllabus
since the Social Security Administration (SSA) does not take into account the possibility of "reasonable accommodation" in determining
SSDI eligibility, an ADA plaintiff's claim that she can perform her job
with reasonable accommodation may well prove consistent with an SSDI
claim that she could not perform her own job (or other jobs) without it.
An individual might qualify for SSDI under SSA's administrative rules
and yet, due to special individual circumstances, be capable of performing the essential functions of her job. Or her condition might have
changed over time, so that a statement about her disability made at the
time of her application for SSDI benefits does not reflect her capacities
at the time of the relevant employment decision. Thus, this Court
would not apply a special legal presumption permitting someone who
has applied for, or received, SSDI benefits to bring an ADA suit only in
some limited and highly unusual set of circumstances. Pp. 801-805.

(b) Nonetheless, in some cases an earlier SSDI claim may turn out
genuinely to conflict with an ADA claim. Summary judgment for a
defendant is appropriate when a plaintiff fails to make a sufficient showing to establish the existence of an essential element on which she has
the burden of proof at trial. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U. S. 317,
322. An ADA plaintiff's sworn assertion in an application for disability
benefits that she is unable to work appears to negate the essential element of her ADA claim that she can perform the essential functions
of her job, and a court should require an explanation of this apparent
inconsistency. To defeat summary judgment, that explanation must be
sufficient to warrant a reasonable juror's concluding that, assuming the
truth of, or the plaintiff's good-faith belief in, the earlier statement, the
plaintiff could nonetheless perform the essential functions of her job,
with or without reasonable accommodation. Pp. 805-807.

2. Here, the parties should have the opportunity in the trial court to
present, or to contest, Cleveland's explanations for the discrepancy between her SSDI statements and her ADA claim, which include that the
SSDI statements that she was totally disabled were made in a forum
that does not consider the effect that reasonable workplace accommodation would have on her ability to work and that those statements were
reliable at the time they were made. P. 807.

Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.
The Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) programprovides benefits to a person with a disability so severe that

she is "unable to do [her] previous work" and "cannot . . .engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work which
exists in the national economy." $ 223(a) of the Social Security Act, as set forth in 42 U. S. C. $ 423(d)(2)(A). This caseasks whether the law erects a special presumption that

would significantly inhibit an SSDI recipient from simultane-ously pursuing an action for disability discrimination under
the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), claiming
that "with . . . reasonable accommodation" she could "perform the essential functions" of her job. $ 101, 104 Stat. 331,
42 U. S. C. $ 12111(8).

We believe that, in context, these two seemingly divergent
statutory contentions are often consistent, each with the
other. Thus pursuit, and receipt, of SSDI benefits does not
automatically estop the recipient from pursuing an ADA
claim. Nor does the law erect a strong presumption against

the recipient's success under the ADA. Nonetheless, anADA plaintiff cannot simply ignore her SSDI contention that

After suffering a disabling stroke and losing her job, Car-olyn Cleveland sought and obtained SSDI benefits from the

Social Security Administration (SSA). She has also broughtthis ADA suit in which she claims that her former employer,
Policy Management Systems Corporation, discriminatedagainst her on account of her disability. The two claims
developed in the following way:

August 1993: Cleveland began work at Policy Man-agement Systems. Her job required her to perform

background checks on prospective employees of PolicyManagement System's clients.
January 7, 1994: Cleveland suffered a stroke, whichdamaged her concentration, memory, and language
skills.
January 28, 1994: Cleveland filed an SSDI application inwhich she stated that she was "disabled" and "unable to

work." App. 21.
April 11, 1994: Cleveland's condition having improved,she returned to work with Policy Management Systems.

She reported that fact to the SSA two weeks later.
July 11, 1994: Noting that Cleveland had returned towork, the SSA denied her SSDI application.

July 15, 1994: Policy Management Systems firedCleveland.
September 14, 1994: Cleveland asked the SSA to recon-sider its July 11th SSDI denial. In doing so, she said:

Opinion of the Court
"I was terminated [by Policy Management Systems] due
to my condition and I have not been able to work since.
I continue to be disabled." Id., at 46. She later added
that she had "attempted to return to work in mid April,"
that she had "worked for three months," and that Policy Management Systems terminated her because she
"could no longer do the job" in light of her "condition."
Id., at 47.

November 1994: The SSA denied Cleveland's request for
reconsideration. Cleveland sought an SSA hearing, reiterating that "I am unable to work due to my disability," and presenting new evidence about the extent of
her injuries. Id., at 79.

September 29, 1995: The SSA awarded Cleveland SSDI
benefits retroactive to the day of her stroke, January
7, 1994.

On September 22, 1995, the week before her SSDI award,
Cleveland brought this ADA lawsuit. She contended that
Policy Management Systems had "terminat[ed]" her employment without reasonably "accommodat[ing] her disability."
Id., at 7. She alleged that she requested, but was denied,
accommodations such as training and additional time to complete her work. Id., at 96. And she submitted a supporting
affidavit from her treating physician. Id., at 101. The District Court did not evaluate her reasonable accommodation
claim on the merits, but granted summary judgment to the
defendant because, in that court's view, Cleveland, by applying for and receiving SSDI benefits, had conceded that she
was totally disabled. And that fact, the court concluded,
now estopped Cleveland from proving an essential element of
her ADA claim, namely, that she could "perform the essential
functions" of her job, at least with "reasonable accommodation." 42 U. S. C. $ 12111(8).

Opinion of the Court
The Fifth Circuit affirmed the District Court's grant ofsummary judg ment. 120 F. 3d 513 (1997). The court

wrote:

"[T]he application for or the receipt of social securitydisability benefits creates a

rebuttable presumption thatthe claimant or recipient of such benefits is judicially

estopped from asserting that he is a `qualified individualwith a disability.' "

Id., at 518.

The Circuit Court noted that it was "at least theoreticallyconceivable that under some limited and highly unusual set

of circumstances the two claims would not necessarily bemutually exclusive."

Id., at 517. But it concluded that,because

"Cleveland consistently represented to the SSA that shewas totally disabled, she has failed to raise a genuine
issue of material fact rebutting the presumption that sheis judicially estopped from now asserting that for the
time in question she was nevertheless a `qualified indi-vidual with a disability' for purposes of her ADA claim."
Id., at 518-519.
We granted certiorari in light of disagreement among theCircuits about the legal effect upon an ADA suit of the application for, or receipt of, disability benefits. Compare, e. g.,
Rascon v. U S West Communications, Inc., 143 F. 3d 1324,1332 (CA10 1998) (application for, and receipt of, SSDI benefits is relevant to, but does not estop plaintiff from bringing,an ADA claim);

cial estoppel but holding that claimant who declared totaldisability in a benefits application failed to raise a genuine

issue of material fact as to whether she was a qualified indi-vidual with a disability).

II
The Social Security Act and the ADA both help individualswith disabilities, but in different ways. The Social Security

Act provides monetary benefits to every insured individualwho "is under a disability." 42 U. S. C. $ 423(a)(1). The Act
defines "disability" as an

"inability to engage in any substantial gainful activityby reason of any . . . physical or mental impairment

which can be expected to result in death or which haslasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period
of not less than 12 months." $ 423(d)(1)(A).
The individual's impairment, as we have said, supra, at 797,must be

"of such severity that [she] is not only unable to do [her]previous work but cannot, considering [her] age, education, and work experience, engage in any other kind ofsubstantial gainful work which exists in the national
economy . . . ." $ 423(d)(2)(A).
The ADA seeks to eliminate unwarranted discriminationagainst disabled individuals in order both to guarantee those

individuals equal opportunity and to provide the Nation withthe benefit of their consequently increased productivity.
See, e. g., 42 U. S. C. $$ 12101(a)(8), (9). The ADA prohibitscovered employers from discriminating "against a qualified
individual with a disability because of the disability of suchindividual." $ 12112(a). The ADA defines a "qualified individual with a disability" as a disabled person "who . . . canperform the essential functions" of her job, including those
who can do so only "with . . . reasonable accommodation."$ 12111(8).

802 CLEVELAND v. POLICY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS CORP.

Opinion of the Court
We here consider but one of the many ways in which thesetwo statutes might interact. This case does

not involve, for
example, the interaction of either of the statutes before uswith other statutes, such as the Federal Employers' Liability

Act, 45 U. S. C. $ 51 et seq. Nor does it involve directly conflicting statements about purely factual matters, such as"The light was red/green," or "I can/cannot raise my arm

above my head." An SSA representation of total disabilitydiffers from a purely factual statement in that it often
implies a context-related legal conclusion, namely, "I amdisabled for purposes of the Social Security Act." And our
consideration of this latter kind of statement consequently
leaves the law related to the former, purely factual, kind of
conflict where we found it.

The case before us concerns an ADA plaintiff who both
applied for, and received, SSDI benefits. It requires us to
review a Court of Appeals decision upholding the grant of
summary judgment on the ground that an ADA plaintiff 's
"represent[ation] to the SSA that she was totally disabled"
created a "rebuttable presumption" sufficient to "judicially
esto[p]" her later representation that, "for the time in question," with reasonable accommodation, she could perform the
essential functions of her job. 120 F. 3d, at 518-519. The
Court of Appeals thought, in essence, that claims under both
Acts would incorporate two directly conflicting propositions,
namely, "I am too disabled to work" and "I am not too disabled to work." And in an effort to prevent two claims that
would embody that kind of factual conflict, the court used a
special judicial presumption, which it believed would ordinarily prevent a plaintiff like Cleveland from successfully
asserting an ADA claim.

In our view, however, despite the appearance of conflict
that arises from the language of the two statutes, the two
claims do not inherently conflict to the point where courts
should apply a special negative presumption like the one applied by the Court of Appeals here. That is because there

526US3 Unit: $U63 [12-11-00 22:03:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN

803Cite as: 526 U. S. 795 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
are too many situations in which an SSDI claim and an ADAclaim can comfortably exist side by side.

For one thing, as we have noted, the ADA defines a"qualified individual" to include a disabled person "who
. . . can perform the essential functions" of her job "with
reasonable accommodation." Reasonable accommodationsmay include:

"job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position, acquisition ormodification of equipment or devices, appropriate adjustment or modifications of examinations, training materials or policies, the provision of qualified readers orinterpreters, and other similar accommodations." 42

U. S. C. $ 12111(9)(B).
By way of contrast, when the SSA determines whether an
individual is disabled for SSDI purposes, it does not take thepossibility of "reasonable accommodation" into account, nor

need an applicant refer to the possibility of reasonable ac-commodation when she applies for SSDI. See Memorandum
from Daniel L. Skoler, Associate Comm'r for Hearings andAppeals, SSA, to Administrative Appeals Judges, reprinted
in 2 Social Security Practice Guide, App. $ 15C[9], pp. 15-401to 15-402 (1998). The omission reflects the facts that the
SSA receives more than 2.5 million claims for disability benefits each year; its administrative resources are limited; thematter of "reasonable accommodation" may turn on highly

disputed workplace-specific matters; and an SSA misjudg-ment about that detailed, and often fact-specific matter
would deprive a seriously disabled person of the critical financial support the statute seeks to provide. See Brief for
United States et al. as Amici Curiae 10-11, and n. 2, 13.
The result is that an ADA suit claiming that the plaintiff can
perform her job with reasonable accommodation may well
prove consistent with an SSDI claim that the plaintiff could
not perform her own job (or other jobs) without it.

526US3 Unit: $U63 [12-11-00 22:03:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN
804 CLEVELAND v. POLICY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS CORP.

Opinion of the Court
For another thing, in order to process the large number of
SSDI claims, the SSA administers SSDI with the help of a
five-step procedure that embodies a set of presumptions
about disabilities, job availability, and their interrelation.
The SSA asks:

Step One: Are you presently working? (If so, you are
ineligible.) See 20 CFR $ 404.1520(b) (1998).

Step Two: Do you have a "severe impairment," i. e.,
one that "significantly limits" your ability to do basic
work activities? (If not, you are ineligible.) See

$ 404.1520(c).

Step Three: Does your impairment "mee[t] or equa[l]"
an impairment on a specific (and fairly lengthy) SSA
list? (If so, you are eligible without more.) See

$$ 404.1520(d), 404.1525, 404.1526.

Step Four: If your impairment does not meet or equal a
listed impairment, can you perform your "past relevant
work?" (If so, you are ineligible.) See $ 404.1520(e).

Step Five: If your impairment does not meet or equal a
listed impairment and you cannot perform your "past
relevant work," then can you perform other jobs that
exist in significant numbers in the national economy?
(If not, you are eligible.) See $$ 404.1520(f ), 404.1560(c).

The presumptions embodied in these questions--particularly
those necessary to produce Step Three's list, which, the Government tells us, accounts for approximately 60 percent of
all awards, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 20--grow out of the need
to administer a large benefits system efficiently. But they
inevitably simplify, eliminating consideration of many differences potentially relevant to an individual's ability to perform a particular job. Hence, an individual might qualify
for SSDI under the SSA's administrative rules and yet, due
to special individual circumstances, remain capable of "perform[ing] the essential functions" of her job.

526US3 Unit: $U63 [12-11-00 22:03:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN

805Cite as: 526 U. S. 795 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
Further, the SSA sometimes grants SSDI benefits to indi-viduals who not only can work, but are working. For example, to facilitate a disabled person's reentry into the workforce, the SSA authorizes a 9-month trial-work period during
which SSDI recipients may receive full benefits. See 42
U. S. C. $$ 422(c), 423(e)(1); 20 CFR $ 404.1592 (1998). Seealso $ 404.1592a (benefits available for an additional 15-month

period depending upon earnings). Improvement in a totallydisabled person's physical condition, while permitting that
person to work, will not necessarily or immediately lead theSSA to terminate SSDI benefits. And the nature of an individual's disability may change over time, so that a statement
about that disability at the time of an individual's application
for SSDI benefits may not reflect an individual's capacities
at the time of the relevant employment decision.

Finally, if an individual has merely applied for, but has not
been awarded, SSDI benefits, any inconsistency in the theory
of the claims is of the sort normally tolerated by our legal
system. Our ordinary Rules recognize that a person may
not be sure in advance upon which legal theory she will succeed, and so permit parties to "set forth two or more statements of a claim or defense alternately or hypothetically,"
and to "state as many separate claims or defenses as the
party has regardless of consistency." Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.
8(e)(2). We do not see why the law in respect to the assertion of SSDI and ADA claims should differ. (And, as we
said, we leave the law in respect to purely factual contradictions where we found it.)

In light of these examples, we would not apply a special
legal presumption permitting someone who has applied for,
or received, SSDI benefits to bring an ADA suit only in
"some limited and highly unusual set of circumstances."
120 F. 3d, at 517.

Nonetheless, in some cases an earlier SSDI claim may turn
out genuinely to conflict with an ADA claim. Summary
judgment for a defendant is appropriate when the plaintiff

526US3 Unit: $U63 [12-11-00 22:03:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN
806 CLEVELAND v. POLICY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS CORP.

Opinion of the Court
"fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existenceof an element essential to [her] case, and on which [she] will

bear the burden of proof at trial." Celotex Corp. v. Catrett,477 U. S. 317, 322 (1986). An ADA plaintiff bears the burden of proving that she is a "qualified individual with a disability"--that is, a person "who, with or without reasonableaccommodation, can perform the essential functions" of her

job. 42 U. S. C. $ 12111(8). And a plaintiff 's sworn asser-tion in an application for disability benefits that she is, for
example, "unable to work" will appear to negate an essentialelement of her ADA case--at least if she does not offer a
sufficient explanation. For that reason, we hold that an
ADA plaintiff cannot simply ignore the apparent contradiction that arises out of the earlier SSDI total disability claim.
Rather, she must proffer a sufficient explanation.

The lower courts, in somewhat comparable circumstances,
have found a similar need for explanation. They have held
with virtual unanimity that a party cannot create a genuine
issue of fact sufficient to survive summary judgment simply
by contradicting his or her own previous sworn statement
(by, say, filing a later affidavit that flatly contradicts that
party's earlier sworn deposition) without explaining the contradiction or attempting to resolve the disparity. See, e. g.,
Colantuoni v. Alfred Calcagni & Sons, Inc., 44 F. 3d 1, 5
(CA1 1994); Rule v. Brine, Inc., 85 F. 3d 1002, 1011 (CA2

494, 498 (CA Fed. 1992), cert. denied, 508 U. S. 912 (1993).Although these cases for the most part involve purely factual
contradictions (as to which we do not necessarily endorsethese cases, but leave the law as we found it), we believe
that a similar insistence upon explanation is warranted here,where the conflict involves a legal conclusion. When faced
with a plaintiff 's previous sworn statement asserting "totaldisability" or the like, the court should require an explanation of any apparent inconsistency with the necessary ele-ments of an ADA claim. To defeat summary judgment, that
explanation must be sufficient to warrant a reasonable ju-ror's concluding that, assuming the truth of, or the plaintiff 's
good-faith belief in, the earlier statement, the plaintiff couldnonetheless "perform the essential functions" of her job, with
or without "reasonable accommodation."

III
In her brief in this Court, Cleveland explains the discrep-ancy between her SSDI statements that she was "totally disabled" and her ADA claim that she could "perform the essen-tial functions" of her job. The first statements, she says,
"were made in a forum which does not consider the effectthat reasonable workplace accommodations would have on
the ability to work." Brief for Petitioner 43. Moreover,she claims the SSDI statements were "accurate statements"
if examined "in the time period in which they were made."
Ibid. The parties should have the opportunity in the trialcourt to present, or to contest, these explanations, in sworn

form where appropriate. Accordingly, we vacate the judg-ment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

granted certiorari, 525 U. S. 981 (1998).

Respondents live on a 75,000-acre ranch near Jordan, Mon-tana. In 1993, a Magistrate Judge issued a warrant authorizing the search of "The Paul W. Berger ranch with appurte-nant structures, excluding the residence" for evidence of
"the taking of wildlife in violation of Federal laws." App.17. About a week later, a multiple-vehicle caravan consisting of Government agents and a crew of photographers andreporters from Cable News Network, Inc. (CNN), proceeded
to a point near the ranch. The agents executed the warrant
and explained: "Over the course of the day, the officerssearched the ranch and its outbuildings pursuant to the authority conferred by the search warrant. The CNN mediacrew . . . accompanied and observed the officers, and the

Held: Petitioner's motion to proceed in forma pauperis is denied. He is

Motions denied.

Per Curiam.
Pro se petitioner Cross seeks leave to proceed in forma
pauperis under Rule 39 of this Court. We deny these re-quests as frivolous pursuant to Rule 39.8. Cross is allowed

until June 14, 1999, within which to pay the docketing feesrequired by Rule 38 and to submit his petitions in compliance

noncriminal matters unless he first pays the docketing feerequired by Rule 38 and submits his petitions in compliance
with Rule 33.1.Cross has repeatedly abused this Court's certiorari process. On March 8, 1999, we invoked Rule 39.8 to deny Crossin forma pauperis status with respect to four petitions for
certiorari. See Cross v. Pelican Bay State Prison, post,p. 1003 (three cases); Cross v. Cambra, post, p. 1003. Before
that time, Cross had filed six petitions for certiorari, all ofwhich were both patently frivolous and had been denied

without recorded dissent. The 2 instant petitions bringCross' total number of frivolous filings to 12, and he has 4

We enter the order barring prospective filings for the rea-sons discussed in

Martin v. District of Columbia Court ofAppeals, 506 U. S. 1 (1992) (per curiam). Cross' abuse of

the writ of certiorari has been in noncriminal cases, and welimit our sanction accordingly. The order therefore will not
prevent Cross from petitioning to challenge criminal sanc-tions which might be imposed on him. Similarly, because
Cross has not abused this Court's extraordinary writs proce-dures, the order will not prevent him from filing nonfrivolous
petitions for extraordinary writs. The order will, however,allow this Court to devote its limited resources to the claims
of petitioners who have not abused our certiorari process.

It is so ordered.
Justice Stevens, dissenting.
As I have suggested in the past, the Court uses more ofits "limited resources" preparing, entering, and policing orders of this kind than it would by following a consistent pol-icy of simply denying the many frivolous petitions that are
filed by a large number of litigants. See Martin v. Districtof Columbia Court of Appeals, 506 U. S. 1, 4 (1992) (

RICHARDSON v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe seventh circuit

No. 97-8629. Argued February 22, 1999--Decided June 1, 1999
At petitioner Richardson's trial for violating 21 U. S. C. $ 848--which forbids any "person" from "engag[ing] in a continuing criminal enterprise,"

$ 848(a), and defines "continuing criminal enterprise" (CCE) as involving
a violation of the drug statutes where "such violation is part of a continuing series of violations," $ 848(c)--the judge rejected Richardson's proposal to instruct the jury that it must unanimously agree on which three
acts constituted the series of violations. Instead, the judge instructed
the jurors that they must unanimously agree that the defendant committed at least three federal narcotics offenses, but did not have to agree
as to the particular offenses. The jury convicted Richardson, and the
Seventh Circuit upheld the trial judge's instruction.

Held: A jury in a $ 848 case must unanimously agree not only that the

defendant committed some "continuing series of violations," but also
about which specific "violations" make up that "continuing series."
Pp. 817-824.

(a) A jury in a federal criminal case cannot convict unless it unanimously finds that the Government has proved each element of the offense. However, it need not always decide unanimously which of
several possible means the defendant used to commit an element. If

$ 848(c)'s phrase "series of violations" refers to one element, a "series,"
in respect to which individual "violations" are but the means, then the
jury need only agree that the defendant committed at least three underlying crimes, and need not agree about which three. Conversely, if
the statute creates several elements, the several "violations," then the
jury must agree unanimously about which three crimes the defendant
committed. Pp. 817-818.

(b) Considerations of language, tradition, and potential unfairness
support a reading of "violations" as elements rather than means. The
Government has not found any legal source reading any instance of the
words "violation" or "violations" as means. To hold that each "violation" here amounts to a separate element is consistent with a tradition
of requiring juror unanimity where the issue is whether a defendant has
engaged in conduct that violates the law. To hold the contrary is not.
The CCE statute's breadth aggravates the dangers of unfairness that
treating each violation as a means would risk. The statute's word "vio526US3 Unit: $U66 [12-11-00 22:07:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN
814 RICHARDSON v. UNITED STATES

Syllabus
lations" covers many different kinds of behavior of varying degrees of
seriousness. The two chapters of the Federal Criminal Code setting
forth drug crimes contain approximately 90 numbered sections, many
of which proscribe various acts that may be alleged as "violations" for
purposes of $ 848's series requirement. This consideration increases
the likelihood that treating violations simply as alternative means, by
permitting a jury to avoid discussion of the specific factual details of
each violation, will cover up wide disagreement among the jurors about
just what the defendant did, or did not, do. Moreover, the Government
may seek to prove that a defendant has been involved in numerous underlying violations, significantly aggravating the risk that jurors will
fail to focus on specific factual detail unless required to do so. Finally,
this Court has indicated that the Constitution itself limits a State's
power to define crimes in ways that would permit juries to convict while
disagreeing about means, at least where that definition risks serious
unfairness and lacks support in history or tradition. Schad v. Arizona,
501 U. S. 624, 632-633. Pp. 818-820.

(c) The Government's arguments for interpreting "violations" as
means--that the words "continuing series" focus on the drug business,
not on the particular violations that constitute the business; that an
analogy can be found in state courts' interpretations of statutes permitting conviction upon proof of a continuous course of conduct without jury agreement on a specific underlying crime; that a juryunanimity requirement will make the statute's crime too difficult to
prove; and that other portions of the statute do not require jury unanimity--are not sufficiently powerful to overcome the foregoing considerations. Pp. 820-824.

if so, whether the error was harmless in this case, are left to the Seventh
Circuit on remand. P. 824.

man, Assistant Attorney General Robinson, Deputy Solici-tor General Dreeben, and Joel M. Gershowitz.*

Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.
A federal criminal statute forbids any "person" from "en-gag[ing] in a continuing criminal enterprise." 84 Stat. 1264,

21 U. S. C. $ 848(a). It defines "continuing criminal enter-prise" (CCE) as involving a "violat[ion]" of the drug statutes
where "such violation is a part of a continuing series of vio-lations." $ 848(c). We must decide whether a jury has to
agree unanimously about which specific violations make upthe "continuing series of violations." We hold that the jury
must do so. That is to say, a jury in a federal criminal casebrought under $ 848 must unanimously agree not only that
the defendant committed some "continuing series of vio-lations" but also that the defendant committed each of the
individual "violations" necessary to make up that "continu-ing series."

I
The CCE statute imposes a mandatory minimum prisonterm of at least 20 years upon a person who engages in a

"continuing criminal enterprise." $ 848(a). It says:

"[A] person is engaged in a continuing criminal enter-prise if--

"(1) he violates any provision of [the federal drug laws,
i. e.,] this subchapter or subchapter II of this chapterthe punishment for which is a felony, and

"(2) such violation is a part of a continuing series of vio-lations of [the federal drug laws, i. e.,] this subchapter
or subchapter II of this chapter--"(A) which are undertaken by such person in concert
with five or more other persons with respect to whom

brief for the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers as amicus

816 RICHARDSON v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
such person occupies a position of organizer [or supervisor or manager] and

"(B) from which such person obtains substantial income or resources." $ 848(c).

In 1994 the Federal Government charged the petitioner,
Eddie Richardson, with violating this statute. The Government presented evidence designed to show that in 1970
Richardson had organized a Chicago street gang called the
Undertaker Vice Lords; that the gang had distributed
heroin, crack cocaine, and powder cocaine over a period of
years stretching from 1984 to 1991; and that Richardson,
known as "King of all the Undertakers," had run the gang,
managed the sales, and obtained substantial income from
those unlawful activities. The jury convicted Richardson.

The question before us arises out of the trial court's instruction about the statute's "series of violations" requirement. The judge rejected Richardson's proposal to instruct
the jury that it must "unanimously agree on which three acts
constituted [the] series of violations." App. 21. Instead,
the judge instructed the jurors that they "must unanimously
agree that the defendant committed at least three federal
narcotics offenses," while adding, "[y]ou do not . . . have
to agree as to the particular three or more federal narcotics offenses committed by the defendant." Id., at 37.
On appeal, the Seventh Circuit upheld the trial judge's instruction. 130 F. 3d 765, 779 (1997). Recognizing a split in
the Circuits on the matter, we granted certiorari. Compare
United States v. Edmonds, 80 F. 3d 810, 822 (CA3 1996)
(en banc) ( jury must unanimously agree on which "violations" constitute the series), with United States v. Hall, 93
F. 3d 126, 129 (CA4 1996) (unanimity with respect to particular "violations" is not required), and United States v. Anderson, 39 F. 3d 331, 350-351 (CADC 1994) (same). We now
conclude that unanimity in respect to each individual violation is necessary.

Opinion of the Court

II
Federal crimes are made up of factual elements, whichare ordinarily listed in the statute that defines the crime.

A (hypothetical) robbery statute, for example, that makes ita crime (1) to take (2) from a person (3) through force or the
threat of force (4) property (5) belonging to a bank wouldhave defined the crime of robbery in terms of the five elements just mentioned. Cf. 18 U. S. C. $ 2113(a). Calling aparticular kind of fact an "element" carries certain legal
consequences. Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523U. S. 224, 239 (1998). The consequence that matters for this
case is that a jury in a federal criminal case cannot convictunless it unanimously finds that the Government has proved
each element. Johnson v. Louisiana, 406 U. S. 356, 369-371(1972) (Powell, J., concurring); Andres v. United States, 333
U. S. 740, 748 (1948); Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 31(a).The question before us arises because a federal jury need
not always decide unanimously which of several possible setsof underlying brute facts make up a particular element, say,
which of several possible means the defendant used to com-mit an element of the crime.

Schad v. Arizona, 501 U. S.624, 631-632 (1991) (plurality opinion); Andersen v. United

States, 170 U. S. 481, 499-501 (1898). Where, for example,an element of robbery is force or the threat of force, some
jurors might conclude that the defendant used a knife tocreate the threat; others might conclude he used a gun. But
that disagreement--a disagreement about means--wouldnot matter as long as all 12 jurors unanimously concluded
that the Government had proved the necessary related ele-ment, namely, that the defendant had threatened force. See
McKoy v. North Carolina, 494 U. S. 433, 449 (1990) (Black-mun, J., concurring).

In this case, we must decide whether the statute's phrase"series of violations" refers to one element, namely a "series," in respect to which the "violations" constitute theunderlying brute facts or means, or whether those words

526US3 Unit: $U66 [12-11-00 22:07:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN
818 RICHARDSON v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
create several elements, namely the several "violations," inrespect to each of which the jury must agree unanimously

and separately. Our decision will make a difference where,as here, the Government introduces evidence that the defendant has committed more underlying drug crimes thanlegally necessary to make up a "series." (We assume, but
do not decide, that the necessary number is three, the num-ber used in this case.) If the statute creates a single element, a "series," in respect to which individual violationsare but the means, then the jury need only agree that the
defendant committed at least three of all the underlyingcrimes the Government has tried to prove. The jury need
not agree about which three. On the other hand, if thestatute makes each "violation" a separate element, then
the jury must agree unanimously about which three crimesthe defendant committed.

A
When interpreting a statute, we look first to the language.
United States v. Wells, 519 U. S. 482, 490 (1997). In thiscase, that language may seem to permit either interpretation, that of the Government or of the petitioner, for thestatute does not explicitly tell us whether the individual violation is an element or a means. But the language is nottotally neutral. The words "violates" and "violations" are
words that have a legal ring. A "violation" is not simply anact or conduct; it is an act or conduct that is contrary to law.
Black's Law Dictionary 1570 (6th ed. 1990). That circum-stance is significant because the criminal law ordinarily entrusts a jury with determining whether alleged conduct "vio-lates" the law, see

infra, at 822, and, as noted above, afederal criminal jury must act unanimously when doing so.

Indeed, even though the words "violates" and "violations"appear more than 1,000 times in the United States Code, the
Government has not pointed us to, nor have we found, anylegal source reading any instance of either word as the Government would have us read them in this case. To hold that

526US3 Unit: $U66 [12-11-00 22:07:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN

819Cite as: 526 U. S. 813 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
each "violation" here amounts to a separate element is consistent with a tradition of requiring juror unanimity where
the issue is whether a defendant has engaged in conduct that
violates the law. To hold the contrary is not.

The CCE statute's breadth also argues against treating
each individual violation as a means, for that breadth aggravates the dangers of unfairness that doing so would risk.
Cf. Schad v. Arizona, supra, at 645 (plurality opinion). The
statute's word "violations" covers many different kinds of
behavior of varying degrees of seriousness. The two chapters of the Federal Criminal Code setting forth drug crimes
contain approximately 90 numbered sections, many of which
proscribe various acts that may be alleged as "violations" for
purposes of the series requirement in the statute. Compare,
e. g., 21 U. S. C. $$ 842(a)(4) and (c) (1994 ed. and Supp. III)
(providing civil penalties for removing drug labels) and 21
U. S. C. $ 844(a) (Supp. III) (simple possession of a controlled
substance) with 21 U. S. C. $ 858 (endangering human life
while manufacturing a controlled substance in violation
of the drug laws) and $ 841(b)(1)(A) (possession with intent
to distribute large quantities of drugs). At the same time,
the Government in a CCE case may well seek to prove that
a defendant, charged as a drug kingpin, has been involved
in numerous underlying violations. The first of these considerations increases the likelihood that treating violations
simply as alternative means, by permitting a jury to avoid
discussion of the specific factual details of each violation,
will cover up wide disagreement among the jurors about
just what the defendant did, or did not, do. The second
consideration significantly aggravates the risk (present at
least to a small degree whenever multiple means are at
issue) that jurors, unless required to focus upon specific
factual detail, will fail to do so, simply concluding from testimony, say, of bad reputation, that where there is smoke
there must be fire.

820 RICHARDSON v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
Finally, this Court has indicated that the Constitution
itself limits a State's power to define crimes in ways that
would permit juries to convict while disagreeing about
means, at least where that definition risks serious unfairness and lacks support in history or tradition. Schad v. Arizona, 501 U. S., at 632-633 (plurality opinion); id., at 651
(Scalia, J., concurring) ("We would not permit . . . an indictment charging that the defendant assaulted either X on
Tuesday or Y on Wednesday . . ."). We have no reason to
believe that Congress intended to come close to, or to test,
those constitutional limits when it wrote this statute. See
Garrett v. United States, 471 U. S. 773, 783-784 (1985) (citing
H. R. Rep. No. 91-1444, pt. 1, pp. 83-84 (1970)) (in making
CCE a separate crime, rather than a sentencing provision,
Congress sought increased procedural protections for defendants); cf. Gomez v. United States, 490 U. S. 858, 864
(1989) ("It is our settled policy to avoid an interpretation
of a federal statute that engenders constitutional issues if a
reasonable alternative interpretation poses no constitutional
question"); Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 346-348 (1936)
(Brandeis, J., concurring).

B

The Government's arguments for an interpretation of
"violations" as means are not sufficiently powerful to overcome the considerations just mentioned, those of language,
tradition, and potential unfairness. The Government, emphasizing the words "continuing series," says that the statute, in seeking to punish drug kingpins, focuses upon the
drug business, not upon the particular violations that constitute the business. Brief for United States 18-19. The argument, however, begs the question. Linguistically speaking, the statute punishes those kingpins who are involved in
a "continuing series of violations" of the drug laws. And
Congress might well have intended a jury to focus upon individual violations in order to assure guilt of the serious

526US3 Unit: $U66 [12-11-00 22:07:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
crime the statute creates. Emphasizing the first two wordsin the passage does not eliminate the last.

Nor can the Government successfully appeal to a historyor tradition of treating individual criminal "violations" as
simply means toward the commission of a greater crime.
The Government virtually concedes the absence of any suchtradition when it says that the statute "departed significantly from common-law models and prior drug laws, creat-ing a new crime keyed to the concept of a `continuing criminal enterprise.' " Id., at 18. The closest analogies it citesconsist of state statutes making criminal such crimes as
sexual abuse of a minor. State courts interpreting such
statutes have sometimes permitted jury disagreement about
a "specific" underlying criminal "incident" insisting only
upon proof of a "continuous course of conduct" in violation
of the law. E. g., People v. Gear, 19 Cal. App. 4th 86, 89-94,
23 Cal. Rptr. 2d 261, 263-267 (1993) (continuous sexual abuse
of a child); People v. Reynolds, 294 Ill. App. 3d 58, 69-71, 689
N. E. 2d 335, 343-344 (1997) (criminal sexual assault of a
minor and aggravated sexual abuse of a minor); State v.
Spigarolo, 210 Conn. 359, 391-392, 556 A. 2d 112, 129 (1989)
(committing an act likely to impair the health or morals of a
child); Soper v. State, 731 P. 2d 587, 591 (Alaska App. 1987)
(sexual assault in the first degree). With one exception,
see Cal. Penal Code Ann. $ 288.5(a) (West Supp. 1998), the
statutes do not define the statutory crime in terms that
require the commission of other predicate crimes by the
defendant. The state practice may well respond to special
difficulties of proving individual underlying criminal acts,
People v. Gear, supra, at 90-92, 23 Cal. Rptr. 2d, at 264-265,
which difficulties are absent here. See infra, at 823-824.
The cases are not federal but state, where this Court has not
held that the Constitution imposes a jury-unanimity requirement. Johnson v. Louisiana, 406 U. S., at 366 (Powell, J.,
concurring). And their special subject matter indicates that
they represent an exception; they do not represent a general

822 RICHARDSON v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
tradition or a rule. People v. Gear, supra, at 89-92, 23 Cal.Rptr. 2d, at 263-265.

In fact, federal criminal law's treatment of recidivism of-fers a competing analogy no more distant than the analogy the Government offers. See Garrett v. United States,
supra, at 782 (the statute originated in a "recidivist pro-vision . . . that provided for enhanced sentences"). If one

looks to recidivism, one finds that commission of a priorcrime will lead to an enhanced punishment only when a relevant factfinder, judge, or jury has found that the defendantcommitted that specific individual prior crime. Where sentencing is at issue, the judge, enhancing a sentence in light
of recidivism, must find a prior individual conviction, United
States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual $$ 4A1.1,
4B1.1 (Nov. 1998), which means that an earlier factfinder
(e. g., a unanimous federal jury in the case of a federal crime)
found that the defendant committed the specific earlier
crime, $$ 4A1.2(a)(1), 4B1.2(c). Where a substantive statute
is at issue, for example, a statute forbidding a felon's possession of a firearm, 18 U. S. C. $ 922(g) (1994 ed. and Supp. III),
the relevant precondition, namely that the gun possessor be
a felon, means at a minimum that an earlier factfinder (e. g.,
a unanimous federal jury in the case of a federal crime) found
that the defendant in fact committed that earlier individual crime. The Government's interpretation is inconsistent
with this practice, for it, in effect, imposes punishment on
a defendant for the underlying crimes without any factfinder
having found that the defendant committed those crimes. If
there are federal statutes reflecting a different practice or
tradition, the Government has not called them to our attention, which suggests that any such statute would represent
a lesser known exception to ordinary practice. Cf. Schad
v. Arizona, 501 U. S., at 633 (plurality opinion) ("[I]t is an
assumption of our system of criminal justice . . . that no person may be punished criminally save upon proof of some specific illegal conduct").

823Cite as: 526 U. S. 813 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
Neither are we convinced by the Government's two re-maining significant arguments. First, the Government says

that a jury-unanimity requirement will make the statute'scrime too difficult to prove--to the point where it is unreasonable to assume Congress intended such a requirement.
But we do not understand why a unanimity requirementwould produce that level of difficulty. After all, the Government routinely obtains the testimony of underlings--street-level dealers who could point to specific incidents--as
well as the testimony of agents who make controlled buysor otherwise observe drug transactions. Such witnesses
should not have inordinate difficulty pointing to specific
transactions. Or, if they do have difficulty, would that difficulty in proving individual specific transactions not tend to
cast doubt upon the existence of the requisite "series"?

The dissent, but not the Government, argues that the
prosecution will now have to prove that the defendant derived substantial income or resources from, and that five persons were involved with, the specific underlying crimes the
jury unanimously agrees were committed. See post, at 830.
To the extent the dissent suggests that those other statutory
requirements must be satisfied with respect to each underlying crime, it is clearly wrong. Those requirements must
be met with respect to the series, which, at a minimum, permits the jury to look at all of the agreed-upon violations in
combination. Even if the jury were limited to the agreedupon violations, we still fail to see why prosecutions would
prove unduly difficult. The dissent writes as if it follows
from its reading that conviction under the CCE statute depends on specific proof of specific sales to specific street-level
users. See post, at 832. That is not true. A specific transaction is not an element of possession with intent to distribute under 21 U. S. C. $ 841. It would be enough to present
testimony, like that of Michael Sargent partially recounted
by the dissent, showing that the defendant supplied a runner
in his organization with large quantities of drugs on or about

526US3 Unit: $U66 [12-11-00 22:07:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN
824 RICHARDSON v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
particular dates as alleged in an indictment. And one needonly examine Sargent's testimony to dispel any fears about

fading memories. He testified that he received from Rich-ardson large quantities of heroin three times a week; he was
able to specify the location where Richardson gave him the
drugs; he was able to recall precisely how the heroin waspackaged when Richardson gave it to him. Tr. 1399-1401.

Though he was not pressed to be specific, he even testifiedthat he started receiving drugs from Richardson sometime
in the beginning of 1989. Id., at 1382. Given the record inthis case, we find it hard to believe the Government will have
as hard a time producing evidence sufficient to support aCCE conviction as the dissent suggests.

Second, the Government points to a different portion of
the statute, which requires a defendant to have supervised"five or more other persons." 21 U. S. C. $ 848(c)(2)(A).

The Government says that no one claims that the jury mustunanimously agree about the identity of those five other
persons. It adds that the jury may also disagree about thebrute facts that make up other statutory elements such as
the "substantial income" that the defendant must derivefrom the enterprise, $ 848(c)(2)(B), or the defendant's role
in the criminal organization, $ 848(c)(2)(A). Assuming, without deciding, that there is no unanimity requirement in respect to these other provisions, we nonetheless find them
significantly different from the provision before us. They
differ in respect to language, breadth, tradition, and the
other factors we have discussed.

These considerations, taken together, lead us to conclude
that the statute requires jury unanimity in respect to each
individual "violation." We leave to the Court of Appeals
the question whether to engage in harmless-error analysis,
and if so, whether the error was harmless in this case.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the
case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with
this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Kennedy, J., dissenting
Justice Kennedy, with whom Justice O'Connor and
Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.

The evidence in this case established that petitioner wasthe head of a sophisticated, well-entrenched, successful

drug distribution enterprise. It had sales of hundreds ofkilograms of heroin and cocaine over a period of years in
Chicago. The jury found that petitioner was engaged in a"continuing criminal enterprise" (CCE).

Title 21 U. S. C., subchapter I, $ 848(c), defines a person asengaged in a CCE if--

"(1) he violates any provision of this subchapter or sub-chapter II of this chapter the punishment for which is a
felony, and
"(2) such violation is a part of a continuing series ofviolations of this subchapter or subchapter II of this

chapter--"(A) which are undertaken by such person in concert
with five or more other persons with respect to whomsuch person occupies a position of organizer, a supervisory position, or any other position of management, and"(B) from which such person obtains substantial income or resources." 84 Stat. 1266.
We are concerned with subparagraph (2), which by its termsrequires the Government to establish the following elements

if it is to prove a CCE: (1) that the violation is part of acontinuing series of violations of the drug laws; (2) that the
continuing series is undertaken by the accused in concertwith five or more other persons; (3) that the accused occupied
a position of organizer, supervisor, or manager, with respectto those other persons; and (4) that the accused obtained
substantial income or resources from the continuing seriesof violations.

The Court today reasons that the first enumerated ele-ment in the subparagraph is not an element at all; instead,
it is shorthand for some number of other elements corre-sponding to the individual violations in the series. The jury

526US3 Unit: $U66 [12-11-00 22:07:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN
826 RICHARDSON v. UNITED STATES

Kennedy, J., dissenting
must therefore be unanimous not as to whether there was
a continuing series of violations but rather as to each of
the individual violations making up some subset of the
continuing series. The Court does not decide how many
elements this portion of the statute contains, although it
assumes without deciding that three will do. Ante, at 818.
The Court gives no satisfactory explanation for confining
its holding to the continuing series phrase, while assuming
nonunanimity as to the specifics of the other elements in the
same subparagraph. Nor does the Court attempt to explain
how a jury is supposed to make sense of the other elements--
like deriving substantial income from the series--now that
the series has in effect been replaced with a few discrete
violations.

The consequences of the Court's decision go well beyond
the jury instruction the Court discusses. The Court's decision of necessity alters the manner in which the Government must frame its indictment and design its trial strategy.
The elements of the offenses charged must be set forth in
the indictment, see Hamling v. United States, 418 U. S. 87,
117 (1974), so henceforth when the Government indicts it
must choose three or more specific violations and allege
those, despite its ability to show that the CCE involves
hundreds or thousands of sales. This is a substantial
departure from what Congress intended. I submit my
respectful dissent.

The Government procured a two-count indictment against
petitioner. The CCE charge is in Count II and the Government, in my view, charged precisely what Congress said it
should. Count II was as follows:

828 RICHARDSON v. UNITED STATES

Kennedy, J., dissenting
By holding that the Government must in addition allegethree or more discrete violations, thus pinning a case involving thousands of transactions on just three of them, theCourt misunderstands the whole design and purpose of the
statute.

We begin on common ground, for, as the Court acknowl-edges, it is settled that jurors need not agree on all of the

means the accused used to commit an offense. Schad v. Arizona, 501 U. S. 624 (1991), confirmed this principle. In my
view, Congress intended the "continuing series of viola-tions" to be one of the defining characteristics of a continuing criminal enterprise, and therefore to be a single element
of the offense, subject to fulfillment in various ways. The
important point is not just that the violations occurred but
that they relate to the enterprise and demonstrate its ongoing nature, hence the requirement of a "continuing" series.
Evidence that the accused supervised a ring that engaged
in thousands of illegal transactions is more probative of the
continuing nature of the enterprise than evidence tending to
show three particular violations.

Nowhere in the text of the statute or its legislative history
does Congress show an interest in the particular predicate
violations constituting the continuing series. Rather, the
CCE offense is aimed at what Congress perceived to be a
peculiar evil: the drug kingpin. The Court's observation
that there is a tradition requiring juror unanimity where the
issue is whether a defendant has engaged in conduct that
violates the law, ante, at 818, simply restates the question
presented. The Court has made clear in an earlier case that
Congress did not "inten[d] to substitute the CCE offense for
the underlying predicate offenses in the case of a big-time
drug dealer," but rather intended "to permit prosecution for
CCE in addition to prosecution for the predicate offenses."
Garrett v. United States, 471 U. S. 773, 785, 786 (1985). The
CCE statute provides a specific remedy to combat criminal
organizations, in large part because of the perceived inade526US3 Unit: $U66 [12-11-00 22:07:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN

829Cite as: 526 U. S. 813 (1999)
Kennedy, J., dissenting
quacies of prior law. Id., at 782-784. By treating the CCEoffense like a simple recidivism statute, the Court's opinion

does not conform to the statutory purpose.The continuing series element reflects Congress' intent to
punish those who organize or direct ongoing narcoticsrelated activity. As the Court said in Garrett: "A common-sense reading of this definition [of `engaged in a continuing

criminal enterprise'] reveals a carefully crafted prohibitionaimed at a special problem. This language is designed to
reach the `top brass' in the drug rings, not the lieutenantsand foot soldiers."

Id., at 781. As part of that statutory
design, the continuing series element of the offense aims to
punish those whose persistence and organization establish a
successful, ongoing criminal operation. The continuing series element, as a consequence, is directed at identifying
drug enterprises of the requisite size and dangerousness, not
at punishing drug offenders for discrete drug violations.

The remaining elements of the CCE definition likewise
target drug kingpins. With respect to the requirement of
action in concert with five or more other persons, every
Court of Appeals to have considered the issue has concluded that the element aims the statute at enterprises
of a certain size, so the identity of the individual supervisees
is irrelevant. See, e. g., United States v. Harris, 959 F. 2d
246, 255 (CADC 1992) (per curiam) (panel including Ruth
Bader Ginsburg and Clarence Thomas, JJ.); United States
v. Garcia, 988 F. 2d 965, 969 (CA9 1993); United States v.
Moorman, 944 F. 2d 801, 803 (CA11 1991); United States
v. English, 925 F. 2d 154, 159 (CA6 1991); United States v.
Linn, 889 F. 2d 1369, 1374 (CA5 1989); United States v. Jackson, 879 F. 2d 85, 88 (CA3 1989); United States v. Tarvers,
833 F. 2d 1068, 1074-1075 (CA1 1987); United States v. Markowski, 772 F. 2d 358, 364 (CA7 1985). As for the remaining
elements, it is undisputed that the jury need not agree unanimously on whether the defendant was a supervisor as opposed to an organizer or other manager, because the leader526US3 Unit: $U66 [12-11-00 22:07:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Kennedy, J., dissenting
ship role is what matters. It should be equally apparentthat the jury need not agree unanimously on which income

or resources the defendant received from the CCE, becausewhat matters is that there be substantial income from the
continuing series, without regard to the form in which it
arrives.The Court assumes that other elements of the statute

can be fulfilled without juror unanimity as to the means offulfillment, and offers nothing more than the conclusory assertion that these other elements "differ in respect to lan-guage, breadth, [and] tradition" from the continuing series
element. Ante, at 824. Not only does the Court fail to provide any analysis that might explain how the elements differ,
it also ignores the point that they are the same in the one
respect that counts for the statute's purposes, namely, that
they are all ways of ensuring that the accused directs
schemes of sufficient size, duration, and effectiveness to
warrant special punishment, without regard to the particulars of the schemes.

It is easy enough to understand that a drug distribution
organization should have five or more other persons to come
within the condemnation of the statute. It is likewise easy
to understand that the organization should generate substantial income for its leaders as a requirement for conviction. Once the continuing series has been replaced with
three individual violations, however, the remaining elements
become difficult for the jury to apply. The Court's unnecessary atomization of the continuing series element disrupts
Congress' careful concentration on the ongoing enterprise
and replaces it with a concentration on perhaps three violations picked out of the continuing series.

The Court seems to proceed on the assumption that any
three small transactions involving a few grams will establish the requisite series. That is not so. In my view, the
necessary consequence of the Court's ruling is that the three
specific crimes must themselves be the ones, in the words

526US3 Unit: $U66 [12-11-00 22:07:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN

831Cite as: 526 U. S. 813 (1999)
Kennedy, J., dissenting
of the statute, "from which [the accused] obtains substantial
income or resources." 21 U. S. C. $ 848(c)(2)(B). Just any
three will not do. This significant new burden will make
prosecutions under the CCE statute remarkably more difficult. Three small transactions will probably not generate
substantial income, and it is unlikely that each transaction
will involve five or more other persons. Or there might be
different views among the jurors as to which transactions
netted substantial income and as to which were undertaken
in concert with five or more others. It is disruptive of the
statutory purpose to require the Government at the outset
to isolate just three or more violations and then relate all
the other parts of the CCE definition to just these offenses.
Yet that is what the Court appears to require. As a consequence, the statute might not even reach businesses (like
petitioner's) which depend for their success upon a high volume of relatively small sales, unless there is jury unanimity
on 20 or 30 discrete transactions. It is all but inconceivable
that Congress intended, in effect, to exempt such businesses
from coverage by this unwarranted emphasis on individual
transactions. It is the enterprise as a whole that must be
examined, and the continuing series of violations relates to
the entire scope of the operations.

In addition, the individual violations making up a continuing series may not always be easy to prove with particularity. The Court assures us that "witnesses should not
have inordinate difficulty pointing to specific transactions."
Ante, at 823. It then asks the rhetorical question: "Or, if
they do have difficulty, would that difficulty in proving individual specific transactions not tend to cast doubt upon the
existence of the requisite `series'?" Ibid. Quite apart from
the point already mentioned that the continuing series must
relate to the elements of action in concert and receipt of
substantial income, the answer to that question is "no."
The evidence in this case so demonstrates.

832 RICHARDSON v. UNITED STATES

Kennedy, J., dissenting
Petitioner was the founder and leader of a gang called theUndertaker Vice Lords. The evidence indicated that petitioner operated what might be called a chain drugstore inChicago, selling various kinds of drugs, including white and
brown heroin, powder cocaine, and rock or crack cocaine,
at various established locations or "spots." Several gangmembers pleaded guilty, cooperated with the Government,

and testified at petitioner's trial. The following are but afew examples of the testimony offered against petitioner.
Johnnie Chew, who ran a brown heroin distribution spotfor the gang in 1987 and 1988, estimated that the gang sold
a "frame"--25 packs, each containing 25 bags worth $25
apiece--every three to four days. Michael Sargent testified that, while he was in charge of a white heroin distribution spot, Richardson supplied him with $40,000 to $60,000
worth of heroin three times a week. Joseph Westmoreland
estimated the Undertakers were collecting about $20,000
to $30,000 per day selling white heroin from 1988 to 1990.
Andre Cal admitted cooking a quarter kilo of powder cocaine
into crack cocaine two to three times a week for 10 months
in the early 1990's. Several other gang members admitted
to earning $50,000 to $60,000 each selling drugs for the gang
on a regular basis. To suggest that Congress intended, in
the face of devastating testimony like this, to allow petitioner to escape a CCE conviction because the witnesses
did not describe any specific, individual transaction out of
thousands (many of which are more than a decade old) is
to misunderstand the nature of the crime Congress sought
to prohibit.

State course-of-conduct crimes provide an analog to the
federal CCE statute. A crime may be said to involve a
continuing course of conduct because it is committed over
a period of time, like kidnaping, harboring a fugitive, or failing to provide support for a minor. In such cases, the jury
need not agree unanimously on individual acts that occur
during the ongoing crime. See generally, e. g., B. Witkin &

526US3 Unit: $U66 [12-11-00 22:07:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Kennedy, J., dissenting
N. Epstein, California Criminal Law $ 2942, p. 245 (2d ed.,Supp. 1997) ("A unanimity instruction is not required when

the crime charged involves a continuous course of conduct . . .such as failure to provide, child abuse, contributing to the
delinquency of a minor, and driving under the influence").
States have also chosen to define as continuous some crimesthat involve repeated conduct where the details of specific

instances may be difficult to prove, as in cases of child mo-lestation or promoting prostitution. See,

e. g., People v.
Adames, 54 Cal. App. 4th 198, 62 Cal. Rptr. 2d 631 (1997)(continuous sexual abuse of a child);

People v. Reynolds, 294
Ill. App. 3d 58, 689 N. E. 2d 335 (1997) (criminal sexual assault and aggravated sexual abuse of a minor); State v. Molitor, 210 Wis. 2d 416, 565 N. W. 2d 248 (App. 1997) (repeated
sexual intercourse with underage partner); State v. Doogan,
82 Wash. App. 185, 917 P. 2d 155 (1996) (advancing prostitution and profiting from prostitution). The CCE offense has
some attributes of both of these categories: To the extent
the CCE offense aims to punish acting as leader of a drug
enterprise, it targets an ongoing violation. To the extent it
relies on there being a series of violations, it may be susceptible to difficulties of proof which make it reasonable to
base a conviction upon the existence of the series rather than
the individual violations. As in this very case, the transactions may have been so numerous or taken place so long
ago that they cannot be recalled individually.

Having failed to confront the acknowledged purpose of
the statute, the Court invokes the principle of constitutional
doubt. Just last Term we warned that overuse of the doctrine risks aggravating the friction between the branches of
Government "by creating (through the power of precedent)
statutes foreign to those Congress intended, simply through
fear of a constitutional difficulty that, upon analysis, will
evaporate." Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U. S.
224, 238 (1998). As discussed in Part II, infra, the CCE
statute in my view passes constitutional muster. Yet the

526US3 Unit: $U66 [12-11-00 22:07:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN
834 RICHARDSON v. UNITED STATES

Kennedy, J., dissenting
Court today interprets the statute in a way foreign to Con-gress' intent without discussing any possible constitutional

infirmity other than to say that it has "no reason to believethat Congress intended to come close to, or to test," the limits on the definition of crimes imposed by the Due Process
Clause when it wrote the CCE statute. Ante, at 820.There is no indication that Congress had any concerns

about the statute's constitutionality. The Court seems toimply the contrary by citing

Garrett for the proposition that
Congress "sought increased procedural protections for de-fendants" in making CCE a separate crime,

ante, at 820 (paraphrasing Garrett, 471 U. S., at 783-784). Taken in context,
the passage from Garrett supports neither the Court's reading of the statute nor its invocation of constitutional doubt.
Garrett held the Double Jeopardy Clause did not bar prosecution for the CCE offense after a prior conviction for one
of the underlying predicate offenses. The passage in question discussed the debate in Congress over whether to impose enhanced punishments for drug kingpins by means of a
separate offense or by means of a sentencing factor. The
House Report cited by the Court noted that an amendment
by Representative Dingell "made engagement in a continuing criminal enterprise a new and distinct offense with
all its elements triable in court." H. R. Rep. No. 91-1444,
pt. 1, p. 84 (1970). That is of course true, but it begs the
question presented in this case, namely, whether the existence of a series is itself an element, or whether the individual
offenses in that series are elements. To say that the jury
must agree unanimously on the elements provides no guidance in determining what those elements are. The competing provision from Representative Poff, moreover, which
would have treated engaging in a CCE as a sentencing factor, was also adopted, with the result that "both approaches
are contained in the statute." Garrett, supra, at 784 (citing
21 U. S. C. $$ 848, 849, 850). There is thus no reason to think
Congress thought it necessary for the jury to agree on which

Kennedy, J., dissenting
particular predicate offenses made up the continuing series
before an enhanced punishment may be imposed.

II
In my view, there is no due process problem with interpreting the continuing series requirement as a single element of the crime. The plurality opinion in Schad spoke
of "the impracticability of trying to derive any single test
for the level of definitional and verdict specificity permitted
by the Constitution." 501 U. S., at 637. Rather, our inquiry is guided by "due process with its demands for fundamental fairness and for the rationality that is an essential
component of that fairness." Ibid. (citation omitted). Our
analysis of fundamental fairness and rationality, by necessity,
is contextual, taking into account both the purposes of the
legislature and the practicalities of the criminal justice
system. In the CCE context, the continuing series element
advances the goals of the statute in a way that is neither
unfair nor irrational: It is a direct and overt prohibition upon
drug lords whose very persistence and success makes them
a particular evil.

The CCE statute does not in any way implicate the suggestion in Schad that an irrational single crime consisting
of, for instance, either robbery or failure to file a tax return
would offend due process. See id., at 633, 650. Although
the continuing series may consist of different drug crimes,
the mere proof of a series does not suffice to convict. The
Government must also prove action in concert with five
or more persons, a leadership role for the defendant with
respect to those persons, and substantial income or resources derived from the continuing series. The presence
of these additional elements distinguishes the CCE statute from a simple recidivism statute, notwithstanding the
Court's attempt to draw an analogy between the two. See
ante, at 822.

526US3 Unit: $U66 [12-11-00 22:07:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN
836 RICHARDSON v. UNITED STATES

Kennedy, J., dissenting
The Court cites Garrett for the proposition that the CCEstatute originated in a " `recidivist provision . . . that provided for enhanced sentences.' " Ante, at 822. In fact, thepoint the Court was making in

Garrett was that Congress
rejected the simple recidivist provision in favor of the current definition of a CCE, which, as the Court in Garrett tookpains to point out, "is not drafted in the way that a recidivist

provision would be drafted" but instead uses "starkly con-trasting language." 471 U. S., at 781-782 (comparing the
CCE definition of $ 848 with the recidivist provision incorpo-rated into $ 849).

One could concede, arguendo, that if Congress were to
pass a habitual-offender statute the sole element of which
was the existence of a series of crimes without a requirement
of jury unanimity on any underlying offense, then the statute
would raise serious questions as to fairness and rationality
because the jury's discretion would be so unconstrained.
The statute before us is not of that type, for the various
elements work together to channel the jury's attention toward a certain kind of ongoing enterprise. We should not
strike down this reasonable law out of fear that we will
not be able to deal in an appropriate manner with an unreasonable law if one should confront us. The CCE statute does not represent an end run around the Constitution's jury unanimity requirement, for Congress had a sound
basis for defining the elements as it did: to punish those who
act as drug kingpins. There are many ways to be a drug
kingpin, just as there are many ways to commit murder or
kidnaping.

With regard to the fundamental fairness of the alternative
means of satisfying the continuing series element, the plurality opinion in Schad indicated that the Court should look
to see whether the alleged predicate offenses making up the
series in each particular case are morally equivalent. The
alternative means of fulfilling an element "must reasonably
reflect notions of equivalent blameworthiness or culpabil526US3 Unit: $U66 [12-11-00 22:07:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Kennedy, J., dissenting
ity, whereas a difference in their perceived degrees of culpa-bility would be a reason to conclude that they identified different offenses altogether." 501 U. S., at 643. The properquestion is not whether the blameworthiness is comparable
"in all possible instances"; rather, the question is whetherone means of fulfillment "may ever be treated as [the] equivalent" of another, and in particular whether the alternativemeans presented in a given case may be so treated.

Id., at643, 644. The continuity itself is what Congress sought to

prohibit with the series element, so it makes no differenceif the violations in the series involve comparable amounts
of drugs.In the absence of any reason to think Congress' definition
of the CCE offense was irrational, or unfair under fundamen-tal principles, or an illicit attempt to avoid the constitutional
requirement of jury unanimity, there is no constitutional bar-rier to requiring jury unanimity on the existence of a continuing series of violations without requiring unanimity as tothe underlying predicate offenses.

* * *
Petitioner is just the sort of person at whom the CCEstatute is aimed. Where witnesses have testified they sold

drugs on a regular basis as part of an enterprise led by thedefendant, it is appropriate for the jury to conclude that a
continuing series of violations of the drug laws has takenplace. Neither Congress' intent nor the Due Process Clause
requires the result the Court reaches today, which rewardsthose drug kingpins whose operations are so vast that the
individual violations cannot be recalled or charged with spec-ificity. I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

O'SULLIVAN v. BOERCKEL
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe seventh circuit

No. 97-2048. Argued March 30, 1999--Decided June 7, 1999
After respondent Boerckel's state convictions were affirmed by the Illinois

Appellate Court and the Illinois Supreme Court denied his petition for
leave to appeal, he filed a federal habeas petition raising six grounds for
relief. In denying the petition, the District Court found, among other
things, that Boerckel had procedurally defaulted his first three claims
by failing to include them in his petition to the Illinois Supreme Court.
The Seventh Circuit reversed and remanded, concluding that Boerckel
had not procedurally defaulted those claims because he was not required
to present them in a petition for discretionary review to the Illinois
Supreme Court in order to satisfy 28 U. S. C. $$ 2254(b)(1), (c), under
which federal habeas relief is available to state prisoners only after they
have exhausted their claims in state court.

Held: In order to satisfy the exhaustion requirement, a state prisoner

must present his claims to a state supreme court in a petition for discretionary review when that review is part of the State's ordinary appellate
review procedure. As a matter of comity, $ 2254(c)--which provides
that a habeas petitioner "shall not be deemed to have exhausted [state
court] remedies . . . if he has the right under [state] law . . . to raise,
by any available procedure, the question presented"--requires that
state prisoners give state courts a full and fair opportunity to resolve
federal constitutional claims before those claims are presented to the
federal courts. See, e. g., Castille v. Peoples, 489 U. S. 346, 351. State
prisoners must give the state courts one full opportunity to resolve
any constitutional issues by invoking one complete round of the State's
established appellate review process. Here, Illinois' established, normal appellate review procedure is a two-tiered system: Most criminal
appeals are heard first by the intermediate appellate courts, and a party
may petition for leave to appeal a decision by the Appellate Court to
the Illinois Supreme Court. Whether to grant such a petition is left to
the sound discretion of the Illinois Supreme Court, Ill. Sup. Ct. Rule
315(a). Although a state prisoner has no right to review in the Illinois
Supreme Court, he does have a "right . . . to raise" his claims before
that court. That is all $ 2254(c) requires. Boerckel's argument that
Rule 315(a) discourages the filing of discretionary petitions raising routine allegations of error, and instead directs litigants to present to the

Opinion of the Court
Supreme Court only those claims that present questions of broad significance, is rejected. Boerckel's related argument, that a rule requiring state prisoners to file petitions for review with that court offends
comity by inundating the Illinois Supreme Court with countless unwanted petitions presenting routine allegations of error, is also rejected.
There is nothing in the exhaustion doctrine requiring federal courts to
ignore a state law or rule providing that a procedure is unavailable,
but the creation of a discretionary review system does not, without
more, make review in the Illinois Supreme Court unavailable. As the
time for filing a petition for leave to appeal to the Illinois Supreme
Court has long past, Boerckel's failure to present three of his federal
habeas claims to that court in a timely fashion has resulted in a procedural default of those claims. Pp. 842-849.

Opinion of the Court
discretionary review in order to satisfy the exhaustion re-quirement. We conclude that he must.

I
In 1977, respondent Darren Boerckel was tried in theCircuit Court of Montgomery County, Illinois, for the rape,

burglary, and aggravated battery of an 87-year-old woman.The central evidence against him at trial was his written confession to the crimes, a confession admitted overBoerckel's objection. The jury convicted Boerckel on all
three charges, and he was sentenced to serve 20 to 60 years'imprisonment on the rape charge, and shorter terms on
the other two charges, with all sentences to be servedconcurrently.

Boerckel appealed his convictions to the Appellate Courtof Illinois, raising several issues. He argued, among other
things, that his confession should have been suppressedbecause the confession was the fruit of an illegal arrest,
because the confession was coerced, and because he hadnot knowingly and intelligently waived his rights under
Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966). Boerckel alsoclaimed that prosecutorial misconduct denied him a fair
trial, that he had been denied discovery of exculpatory mate-rial held by the police, and that the evidence was insufficient
to support his conviction. The Illinois Appellate Court,with one justice dissenting, rejected Boerckel's claims and
affirmed his convictions and sentences. People v. Boerckel,68 Ill. App. 3d 103, 385 N. E. 2d 815 (1979).

Boerckel next filed a petition for leave to appeal to theIllinois Supreme Court. In this petition, he raised only
three issues. Boerckel claimed first that his confession wasthe fruit of an unlawful arrest because, contrary to the Appellate Court's ruling, he was under arrest when he gavehis confession. Boerckel also contended that he was denied a fair trial by prosecutorial misconduct and that he hadbeen erroneously denied discovery of exculpatory material

in the possession of the police. The Illinois Supreme Courtdenied the petition for leave to appeal, and this Court denied Boerckel's subsequent petition for a writ of certiorari.
Boerckel v. Illinois, 447 U. S. 911 (1980).

In 1994, Boerckel filed a pro se petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U. S. C. $ 2254 in the United States Dis-trict Court for the Central District of Illinois. The District

Court appointed counsel for Boerckel, and Boerckel's coun-sel filed an amended petition in March 1995. The amended
petition asked for relief on six grounds: (1) that Boerckelhad not knowingly and intelligently waived his

Miranda
rights; (2) that his confession was not voluntary; (3) that the
evidence against him was insufficient to sustain the conviction; (4) that his confession was the fruit of an illegal arrest;
(5) that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at trial
and on appeal; and (6) that his right to discovery of exculpatory material under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963),
was violated.

In an order dated November 15, 1995, the District Court
found, as relevant here, that Boerckel had procedurally defaulted his first, second, and third claims by failing to include them in his petition for leave to appeal to the Illinois

Supreme Court. No. 94-3258 (CD Ill.), pp. 4-10. Boerckel
attempted to overcome the procedural defaults by presenting evidence that he fell within the "fundamental miscarriage
of justice" exception to the procedural default rule. See
Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 750 (1991). At a hearing on this issue, Boerckel argued that he was actually innocent of the offenses for which he had been convicted and
he presented evidence that he claimed showed that two
other men were responsible for the crimes. In a subsequent ruling, the District Court concluded that Boerckel had
failed to satisfy the standards established in Schlup v. Delo,
513 U. S. 298 (1995), for establishing the "fundamental miscarriage of justice" exception, and thus held that Boerckel
could not overcome the procedural bars preventing review

of his claims. No. 94-3258 (CD Ill., Oct. 28, 1996), pp. 14-15.After rejecting Boerckel's remaining claims for relief, the

District Court denied his habeas petition. Id., at 18.On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit
considered one question, namely, whether Boerckel had pro-cedurally defaulted the first three claims in his habeas petition (whether he knowingly and intelligently waived his
Miranda rights, whether his confession was voluntary,and whether the evidence was sufficient to support a verdict)

by failing to raise those claims in his petition for leave toappeal to the Illinois Supreme Court. The Court of Appeals reversed the judgment of the District Court denyingBoerckel's habeas petition and remanded for further proceedings. 135 F. 3d 1194 (1998). The court concluded thatBoerckel was not required to present his claims in a petition
for discretionary review to the Illinois Supreme Court to sat-isfy the exhaustion requirement.

Id., at 1199-1202. Thus,according to the Court of Appeals, Boerckel had not procedurally defaulted those claims. Id., at 1202.We granted certiorari to resolve a conflict in the Courts
of Appeals on this issue. 525 U. S. 999 (1998). Compare
e. g., Richardson v. Procunier, 762 F. 2d 429 (CA5 1985)(must file petition for discretionary review), with Dolny v.

Erickson, 32 F. 3d 381 (CA8 1994) (petition for discretionaryreview not required), cert. denied, 513 U. S. 1111 (1995).

Before a federal court may grant habeas relief to a stateprisoner, the prisoner must exhaust his remedies in state

court. In other words, the state prisoner must give thestate courts an opportunity to act on his claims before he
presents those claims to a federal court in a habeas petition.The exhaustion doctrine, first announced in

Ex parte Royall,117 U. S. 241 (1886), is now codified at 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(b)(1)

(1994 ed., Supp. III). This doctrine, however, raises a re-curring question: What state remedies must a habeas peti526US3 Unit: $U67 [01-03-01 13:46:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tioner invoke to satisfy the federal exhaustion requirement?See

Castille v. Peoples, 489 U. S. 346, 349-350 (1989); Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, 78 (1977). The particular ques-tion posed by this case is whether a prisoner must seek review in a state court of last resort when that court has
discretionary control over its docket.Illinois law provides for a two-tiered appellate review

process. Criminal defendants are tried in the local circuitcourts, and although some criminal appeals (

e. g., those in
which the death penalty is imposed) are heard directly bythe Supreme Court of Illinois, most criminal appeals are

heard first by an intermediate appellate court, the Appel-late Court of Illinois. Ill. Sup. Ct. Rule 603 (1998). A party
may petition for leave to appeal a decision by the Appellate
Court to the Illinois Supreme Court (with exceptions thatare irrelevant here), but whether "such a petition will be

granted is a matter of sound judicial discretion." Rule315(a). See also Rule 612(b) (providing that Rule 315 governs criminal, as well as civil, appeals). Rule 315 elaborateson the exercise of this discretion as follows:

"The following, while neither controlling nor fully mea-suring the court's discretion, indicate the character of
reasons which will be considered: the general impor-tance of the question presented; the existence of a conflict between the decision sought to be reviewed and adecision of the Supreme Court, or of another division
of the Appellate Court; the need for the exercise of the
Supreme Court's supervisory authority; and the finalor interlocutory character of the judgment sought to be

reviewed." Rule 315(a).
Boerckel's amended federal habeas petition raised three
claims that he had not included in his petition for leave
to appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court. To determine
whether Boerckel was required to present those claims to
the Illinois Supreme Court in order to exhaust his state

Opinion of the Court
remedies, we turn first to the language of the federal habeasstatute. Section 2254(c) provides that a habeas petitioner

"shall not be deemed to have exhausted the remedies avail-able in the courts of the State . . . if he has the right under
the law of the State to raise, by any available procedure, the
question presented." Although this language could be readto effectively foreclose habeas review by requiring a state

prisoner to invoke any possible avenue of state court review,we have never interpreted the exhaustion requirement in
such a restrictive fashion. See Wilwording v. Swenson, 404U. S. 249, 249-250 (1971)

(per curiam). Thus, we have not
interpreted the exhaustion doctrine to require prisoners to
file repetitive petitions. See Brown v. Allen, 344 U. S. 443,
447 (1953) (holding that a prisoner does not have "to ask the
state for collateral relief, based on the same evidence and
issues already decided by direct review"). We have also
held that state prisoners do not have to invoke extraordinary remedies when those remedies are alternatives to the
standard review process and where the state courts have
not provided relief through those remedies in the past. See
Wilwording v. Swenson, supra, at 249-250 (rejecting suggestion that state prisoner should have invoked "any of a
number of possible alternatives to state habeas including
`a suit for injunction, a writ of prohibition, or mandamus or
a declaratory judgment in the state courts,' or perhaps other
relief under the State Administrative Procedure Act").

Section 2254(c) requires only that state prisoners give
state courts a fair opportunity to act on their claims. See
Castille v. Peoples, supra, at 351; Picard v. Connor, 404 U. S.
270, 275-276 (1971). State courts, like federal courts, are
obliged to enforce federal law. Comity thus dictates that
when a prisoner alleges that his continued confinement for a
state court conviction violates federal law, the state courts
should have the first opportunity to review this claim and
provide any necessary relief. Rose v. Lundy, 455 U. S. 509,
515-516 (1982); Darr v. Burford, 339 U. S. 200, 204 (1950).

Opinion of the Court
This rule of comity reduces friction between the state andfederal court systems by avoiding the "unseem[liness]" of a

federal district court's overturning a state court convictionwithout the state courts having had an opportunity to correct the constitutional violation in the first instance. Ibid.
See also Duckworth v. Serrano, 454 U. S. 1, 3-4 (1981) (per
curiam); Rose v. Lundy, supra, at 515-516.

Because the exhaustion doctrine is designed to give thestate courts a full and fair opportunity to resolve federal

constitutional claims before those claims are presented tothe federal courts, we conclude that state prisoners must
give the state courts one full opportunity to resolve any constitutional issues by invoking one complete round of the
State's established appellate review process. Here, Illinois'
established, normal appellate review procedure is a twotiered system. Comity, in these circumstances, dictates that
Boerckel use the State's established appellate review procedures before he presents his claims to a federal court.
Unlike the extraordinary procedures that we found unnecessary in Brown v. Allen and Wilwording v. Swenson, a petition for discretionary review in Illinois' Supreme Court is
a normal, simple, and established part of the State's appellate review process. In the words of the statute, state
prisoners have "the right . . . to raise" their claims through
a petition for discretionary review in the State's highest
court. $ 2254(c). Granted, as Boerckel contends, Brief for
Respondent 16, he has no right to review in the Illinois
Supreme Court, but he does have a "right . . . to raise"
his claims before that court. That is all $ 2254(c) requires.

Boerckel contests this conclusion with two related arguments. His first argument is grounded in a stylized portrait of the Illinois appellate review process. According to
Boerckel, Illinois' appellate review procedures make the
intermediate appellate courts the primary focus of the system; all routine claims of error are directed to those courts.
The Illinois Supreme Court, by contrast, serves only to an526US3 Unit: $U67 [01-03-01 13:46:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN
846 O'SULLIVAN v. BOERCKEL

Opinion of the Court
swer "questions of broad significance." Id., at 4. Boer-ckel's view of Illinois' appellate review process derives from

Ill. Sup. Ct. Rule 315(a) (1998). He reads this Rule to dis-courage the filing of petitions raising routine allegations of
error and to direct litigants to present only those claims that
meet the criteria defined by the Rule. Rule 315(a), by itsown terms, however, does not "contro[l]" or "measur[e]" the

Illinois Supreme Court's discretion. The Illinois SupremeCourt is free to take cases that do not fall easily within the
descriptions listed in the Rule. Moreover, even if we wereto assume that the Rule discourages the filing of certain petitions, it is difficult to discern which cases fall into the "discouraged" category. In this case, for example, the parties
disagree about whether, under the terms of Rule 315(a),
Boerckel's claims should have been presented to the Illinois
Supreme Court. Compare Brief for Respondent 5 with
Reply Brief for Petitioner 5.

The better reading of Rule 315(a) is that the Illinois
Supreme Court has the opportunity to decide which cases
it will consider on the merits. The fact that Illinois has
adopted a discretionary review system may reflect little
more than that there are resource constraints on the Illinois Supreme Court's ability to hear every case that is presented to it. It may be that, given the necessity of a discretionary review system, the Rule allows the Illinois Supreme
Court to expend its limited resources on "questions of broad
significance." We cannot conclude from this Rule, however,
that review in the Illinois Supreme Court is unavailable.
By requiring state prisoners to give the Illinois Supreme
Court the opportunity to resolve constitutional errors in the
first instance, the rule we announce today serves the comity
interests that drive the exhaustion doctrine.

Boerckel's second argument is related to his first. According to Boerckel, because the Illinois Supreme Court has
announced (through Rule 315(a)) that it does not want to
hear routine allegations of error, a rule requiring state pris526US3 Unit: $U67 [01-03-01 13:46:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
oners to file petitions for review with that court offends com-ity by inundating the Illinois Supreme Court with countless

unwanted petitions. Brief for Respondent 8-14. See also135 F. 3d, at 1201. This point, of course, turns on Boerckel's
interpretation of Rule 315(a), an interpretation that, as
discussed above, we do not find persuasive. Nor is it clearthat the rule we announce today will have the effect that

Boerckel predicts. We do not know, for example, whatpercentage of Illinois state prisoners who eventually seek
federal habeas relief decline, in the first instance, to seekreview in the Illinois Supreme Court.

We acknowledge that the rule we announce today--requiring state prisoners to file petitions for discretionary review
when that review is part of the ordinary appellate review
procedure in the State--has the potential to increase the
number of filings in state supreme courts. We also recognize that this increased burden may be unwelcome in
some state courts because the courts do not wish to have
the opportunity to review constitutional claims before those
claims are presented to a federal habeas court. See, e. g.,
In re Exhaustion of State Remedies in Criminal and PostConviction Relief Cases, 321 S. C. 563, 471 S. E. 2d 454
(1990); see also State v. Sandon, 161 Ariz. 157, 777 P. 2d 220
(1989). Under these circumstances, Boerckel may be correct that the increased, unwelcome burden on state supreme
courts disserves the comity interests underlying the exhaustion doctrine. In this regard, we note that nothing in our
decision today requires the exhaustion of any specific state
remedy when a State has provided that that remedy is unavailable. Section 2254(c), in fact, directs federal courts to
consider whether a habeas petitioner has "the right under
the law of the State to raise, by any available procedure, the
question presented." (Emphasis added.) The exhaustion
doctrine, in other words, turns on an inquiry into what procedures are "available" under state law. In sum, there is
nothing in the exhaustion doctrine requiring federal courts

Opinion of the Court
to ignore a state law or rule providing that a given procedureis not available. We hold today only that the creation of a

discretionary review system does not, without more, makereview in the Illinois Supreme Court unavailable.

Boerckel's amended federal habeas petition raised three
claims that he had pressed before the Appellate Court ofIllinois, but that he had not included in his petition for leave

to appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court. There is no dis-pute that this state court remedy--a petition for leave to
appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court--is no longer avail-able to Boerckel; the time for filing such a petition has long
passed. See Ill. Sup. Ct. Rule 315(b). Thus, Boerckel's failure to present three of his federal habeas claims to the Illinois Supreme Court in a timely fashion has resulted in a
procedural default of those claims. See Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S., at 731-732; Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 125-
126, n. 28 (1982).

We do not disagree with Justice Stevens' general description of the law of exhaustion and procedural default.
Specifically, we do not disagree with his description of the
interplay of these two doctrines. Post, at 853-854 (dissenting opinion). As Justice Stevens notes, a prisoner could
evade the exhaustion requirement--and thereby undercut
the values that it serves--by "letting the time run" on state
remedies. Post, at 853. To avoid this result, and thus "protect the integrity" of the federal exhaustion rule, ibid., we
ask not only whether a prisoner has exhausted his state remedies, but also whether he has properly exhausted those
remedies, i. e., whether he has fairly presented his claims to
the state courts, see post, at 854. Our disagreement with
Justice Stevens in this case turns on our differing answers
to this last question: Whether a prisoner who fails to present
his claims in a petition for discretionary review to a state
court of last resort has properly presented his claims to the
state courts. Because we answer this question "no," we
conclude that Boerckel has procedurally defaulted his claims.

Souter, J., concurring
Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for theSeventh Circuit is reversed.

It is so ordered.
Justice Souter, concurring.
I agree with the Court's strict holding that "the creation of
a discretionary review system does not, without more, make
review in the Illinois Supreme Court unavailable" for pur-poses of federal habeas exhaustion.

Ante, at 848. I understand the Court to have left open the question (not directlyimplicated by this case) whether we should construe the exhaustion doctrine to force a State, in effect, to rule on discre-tionary review applications when the State has made it plain
that it does not wish to require such applications before itspetitioners may seek federal habeas relief. The Supreme
Court of South Carolina, for example, has declared:

"[I]n all appeals from criminal convictions or postconviction relief matters, a litigant shall not be requiredto petition for rehearing and certiorari following an

adverse decision of the Court of Appeals in order to be
deemed to have exhausted all available state remediesrespecting a claim of error. Rather, when the claim has

been presented to the Court of Appeals or the SupremeCourt, and relief has been denied, the litigant shall be
deemed to have exhausted all available state remedies."
In re Exhaustion of State Remedies in Criminal and
Post-Conviction Relief Cases, 321 S. C. 563, 564, 471S. E. 2d 454 (1990).

The Court is clear that "nothing in the exhaustion doctrinerequir[es] federal courts to ignore a state law or rule providing that a given procedure is not available." Ante, at847-848. Its citation of

In re Exhaustion of State Remedies, for the proposition that the increased burden on state
courts may be unwelcome, should not be read to suggest
something more: that however plainly a State may speak its

Stevens, J., dissenting
highest court must be subjected to constant applications fora form of discretionary review that the State wishes to reserve for truly extraordinary cases, or else be forced to elim-inate that kind of discretionary review.

In construing the exhaustion requirement, "[w]e have . . .
held that state prisoners do not have to invoke extraordi-nary remedies when those remedies are alternatives to the

standard review process and where the state courts have notprovided relief through those remedies in the past."

Ante,
at 844 (citing Wilwording v. Swenson, 404 U. S. 249, 249-250(1971)

(per curiam)). I understand that we leave open the
possibility that a state prisoner is likewise free to skip aprocedure even when a state court has occasionally employed

it to provide relief, so long as the State has identified the
procedure as outside the standard review process and has
plainly said that it need not be sought for the purpose of
exhaustion. It is not obvious that either comity or precedent requires otherwise.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Ginsburg and
Justice Breyer join, dissenting.

The Court's opinion confuses two analytically distinct
judge-made rules: (1) the timing rule, first announced in Ex
parte Royall, 117 U. S. 241 (1886), and later codified at 28
U. S. C. $ 2254(b)(1) (1994 ed., Supp. III), that requires a state
prisoner to exhaust his state remedies before seeking a federal writ of habeas corpus; and (2) the waiver, or so-called
procedural default, rule, applied in cases like Francis v. Henderson, 425 U. S. 536 (1976), that forecloses relief even when
the petitioner has exhausted his remedies.

Properly phrased, the question presented by this case is
not whether respondent's claims were exhausted; they
clearly were because no state remedy was available to him
when he applied for the federal writ. The question is
whether we should hold that his claims are procedurally defaulted and thereby place still another procedural hurdle in

Stevens, J., dissenting
the path of applicants for federal relief who have given atleast two state courts a fair opportunity to consider the merits of their constitutional claims. Before addressing thatquestion, I shall briefly trace the history of the two separate
doctrines that the Court has improperly commingled.

I
"[T]he problem of waiver is separate from the questionwhether a state prisoner has exhausted state remedies."

Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 125-126, n. 28 (1982). Thequestion of exhaustion "refers only to remedies still available at the time of the federal petition," ibid.; it requiresfederal courts to ask whether an applicant for federal relief
could still get the relief he seeks in the state system. If theapplicant currently has a state avenue available for raising
his claims, a federal court, in the interest of comity, mustgenerally abstain from intervening. This time-honored rule
has developed over several decades of cases, always withthe goal of respecting the States' interest in passing first on
their prisoners' constitutional claims in order to act as theprimary guarantor of those prisoners' federal rights, and
always separate and apart from rules of waiver.In

Ex parte Royall this Court reviewed a federal trialjudge's decision dismissing for want of jurisdiction a state

prisoner's application for a writ of habeas corpus. The pris-oner, who was awaiting trial on charges that he had violated
a Virginia statute, alleged that the statute was unconstitu-tional. This Court held that the trial court had jurisdiction,
but nevertheless concluded that as a matter of comity thecourt had "discretion, whether it will discharge him, upon
habeas corpus, in advance of his trial in the court in whichhe is indicted." 117 U. S., at 253. Moreover, we held that,
even if the prisoner was convicted, the court still had discre-tion to await a decision by the highest court of the State.

We clarified this abstention principle in Urquhart v.Brown, 205 U. S. 179 (1907). We stated that the "excep526US3 Unit: $U67 [01-03-01 13:46:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN
852 O'SULLIVAN v. BOERCKEL

Stevens, J., dissenting
tional cases in which a Federal court or judge may some-times appropriately interfere by

habeas corpus in advance
of final action by the authorities of the State are those ofgreat urgency,"

id., at 182, that involve the authority of the
General Government. Apart from those rare cases presenting "exceptional circumstances of peculiar urgency," see
United States ex rel. Kennedy v. Tyler, 269 U. S. 13, 17
(1925), our early cases consistently applied the rule summa-rized in

Ex parte Hawk, 321 U. S. 114, 116-117 (1944) (per
curiam): "Ordinarily an application for habeas corpus by onedetained under a state court judgment of conviction for

crime will be entertained by a federal court only after all
state remedies available, including all appellate remedies
in the state courts and in this Court by appeal or writ of
certiorari, have been exhausted."

The 1948 statute changed neither that rule nor its exclusive emphasis on timing. In that year, "Congress codified
the exhaustion doctrine in 28 U. S. C. $ 2254, citing Ex parte
Hawk as correctly stating the principle of exhaustion."
Rose v. Lundy, 455 U. S. 509, 516 (1982). The statute as
enacted provided that an application for a writ by a state
prisoner "shall not be granted" unless the applicant has exhausted his state remedies and, as the amended statute still
does today, further provided that the applicant shall not be
deemed to have done so "if he has the right under the law
of the State to raise, by any available procedure, the question presented." 62 Stat. 967; 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d) (1994 ed.,
Supp. III). We interpreted this statute in Rose as requiring
"total exhaustion"--that is, as requiring federal courts to
dismiss habeas petitions when any of the claims could still
be brought in state court. 455 U. S., at 522. Conversely, of
course, if no state procedure is available for raising any
claims at the time a state prisoner applies for federal relief,
the exhaustion requirement is satisfied.

To be sure, the fact that a prisoner has failed to invoke
an available state procedure may provide the basis for a

Stevens, J., dissenting
conclusion that he has waived a claim. But the exhaustioninquiry focuses entirely on the availability of state procedures at the time when the federal court is asked to enter-tain a habeas petition. Our decision in Moore v. Dempsey,
261 U. S. 86 (1923), which was cited with approval in Hawk,321 U. S., at 118, illustrates this principle. In that case, the
Arkansas Supreme Court had rejected the petitioner's jurydiscrimination claim because he had asserted it in a motion
for new trial that "came too late." 261 U. S., at 93. But, inholding that the Federal District Court should have entertained the claim, we obviously found that the state court'srefusal to hear the claim on procedural grounds did not mean
that the claim had not been exhausted. When we implicitlyoverruled Moore several years later in Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722 (1991), we did so only on waiver grounds.We explicitly noted that "[a] habeas petitioner who has defaulted his federal claims in state court meets the technicalrequirements for exhaustion; there are no state remedies any
longer `available' to him." Id., at 732.Neither party argues that respondent currently has any
state remedies available to him. The Court recognizes thiscircumstance, see

ante, at 848, but still purports to analyzewhether respondent has "exhausted [his] claims in state

court." Ante, at 839, 842. Since I do not believe that thiscase raises an exhaustion issue, I turn to the subject of
waiver. II

In order to protect the integrity of our exhaustionrule, we have also crafted a separate waiver rule, or--as
it is now commonly known--the procedural default doctrine.The purpose of this doctrine is to ensure that state prisoners
not only become ineligible for state relief before raising theirclaims in federal court, but also that they give state courts
a sufficient opportunity to decide those claims before doingso. If we allowed state prisoners to obtain federal review
simply by letting the time run on adequate and accessible

Stevens, J., dissenting
state remedies and then rushing into the federal system,the comity interests that animate the exhaustion rule could

easily be thwarted. We therefore ask in federal habeascases not only whether an applicant has exhausted his state
remedies; we also ask how he has done so. This second inquiry forms the basis for our procedural default doctrine: Ahabeas petitioner who has concededly exhausted his state

remedies must also have properly done so by giving theState a fair "opportunity to pass upon [his claims]."

Darr
v. Burford, 339 U. S. 200, 204 (1950). When a prisoner hasdeprived the state courts of such an opportunity, he has procedurally defaulted his claims and is ineligible for federal
habeas relief save a showing of "cause and prejudice," Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478, 485 (1986), or " `a fundamental
miscarriage of justice' " id., at 495.

In the first of our modern procedural default cases, Francis v. Henderson, 425 U. S. 536 (1976), we held that a state
prisoner had waived his right to challenge the composition
of his grand jury because he had failed to comply with a
state law requiring that such a challenge be made in advance
of trial. Our opinion did not even mention the obvious fact
that the petitioner had exhausted his state remedies; rather,
it stressed the importance of requiring " `prompt assertion
of the right to challenge discriminatory practices in the
make-up of a grand jury.' " Id., at 541.

Similarly, in Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72 (1977), we
held that the failure to object at trial to the admission of an
inculpatory statement precluded a federal court from entertaining in a habeas proceeding the claim that the statement
was involuntary. Our opinion correctly assumed that the
petitioner had exhausted his state remedies. Id., at 80-81.
Our conclusion that waiver was appropriate rested largely
on the importance of treating a trial as "the `main event,' so
to speak," and making the necessary record "with respect to
the constitutional claim when the recollections of witnesses
are freshest, not years later in a federal habeas proceeding."

Stevens, J., dissenting
Id., at 88, 90. In Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107 (1982), anothercase in which the prisoner had unquestionably exhausted his

state remedies, see id., at 125-126, n. 28, we held that aclaimed constitutional defect in the trial judge's instructions
to the jury had been waived because the objection had not
been raised at trial.In

Coleman, the Court extended our procedural default
doctrine to state collateral appellate proceedings. TheCourt held that an inmate's constitutional claims that he had

advanced in a state habeas proceeding could not be enter-tained by a federal court because his appeal from the state
trial court's denial of collateral relief had been filed three
days late. The Court, as I noted above, expressly stated
that the exhaustion requirement had been satisfied because
"there [were] no state remedies any longer `available' to
him." 501 U. S., at 732. But because the State had consistently and strictly applied its timing deadlines for filing such
appellate briefs in this and other cases, we concluded that
Coleman had effectively deprived the State of a fair opportunity to pass on his claims and thus had procedurally defaulted them.

On the other hand, we have continually recognized, as the
Court essentially does again today, ante, at 844, that a state
prisoner need not have invoked every conceivably "available"
state remedy in order to avoid procedural default. As far
back as Brown v. Allen, 344 U. S. 443, 447 (1953), we held
that even when a State offers postconviction procedures, a
prisoner does not have "to ask the state for collateral relief,
based on the same evidence and issues already decided by
direct review." We later held that prisoners who have exhausted state habeas procedures need not have requested in
state courts an injunction, a writ of prohibition, mandamus
relief, a declaratory judgment, or relief under the State Administrative Procedure Act, even if those procedures were
technically available. Wilwording v. Swenson, 404 U. S. 249

rectly hold that prisoners have exhausted their state reme-dies, and have not procedurally defaulted their claims, when

those prisoners had the right under state law to file a peti-tion for rehearing from the last adverse state-court decision
and failed to do so.The presence or absence of exhaustion, in sum, tells us
nothing about whether a prisoner has defaulted his constitu-tional claims. Exhaustion is purely a rule of timing and has
played no role in the series of waiver decisions that fore-closed challenges to the composition of the grand jury, evidentiary rulings at trial, instructions to the jury, and finally,counsel's inadvertent error in failing to file a timely appeal
from a state court's denial of collateral relief. The Court'sreasons for progressively expanding its procedural default
doctrine were best explained in the cases that arose in atrial setting. By failing to raise their constitutional objections at trial, defendants truly impinge state courts' abilityto correct, or even to make a record regarding the effect of,
legal errors. See Engle, 456 U. S., at 128; Wainwright, 433U. S., at 90. Though I found that reasoning unsatisfactory
in the state postconviction context, see Coleman, 501 U. S.,at 758 (Blackmun, J., joined by Marshall and

Stevens, JJ.,dissenting), at least the Court did not make the analytical

error that pervades its opinion today. It did not assumethat there was any necessary connection between the question of exhaustion and the question of procedural default.

III
I come now to the real issue presented by this case:whether respondent's failure to include all six of his current claims in his petition for leave to appeal to the IllinoisSupreme Court should result in his procedurally defaulting
the three claims he did not raise.The Court barely answers this question. Even though
no one contends that respondent currently has any stateremedy available to him, the Court concentrates instead on

Stevens, J., dissenting
exhaustion. It states that respondent has not exhausted hisclaims because he had " `the right . . . to raise' [his] claims

through a petition for discretionary review in the [Illi-nois Supreme Court]."

Ante, at 845 (quoting 28 U. S. C.

$ 2254(c)). The Court adds to this that "the creation of a
discretionary review system does not, without more, makereview in the Illinois Supreme Court unavailable."

Ante, at
848. But, as the Court acknowledges almost immediatelythereafter, the fact that "the time for filing [a petition to that

court] has long passed" most assuredly makes such reviewunavailable in this case.

Ibid. The Court then resolves
this case's core issue in a single sentence and two citations:
"Thus, Boerckel's failure to present three of his federal habeas claims to the Illinois Supreme Court in a timely fashion
has resulted in a procedural default of those claims. Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S., at 731-732; Engle v. Isaac, 456
U. S. 107, 125-126, n. 28 (1982)." Ibid.

I disagree that respondent has procedurally defaulted
these three claims, and neither Engle nor Coleman suggests
otherwise. The question we must ask is whether respondent has given the State a fair opportunity to pass on these
claims. This Court has explained that the best way to determine the answer to this question is to "respect . . . state
procedural rules" and to inquire whether the State has denied (or would deny) relief to the prisoner based on his failure to abide by any such rule. Coleman, 501 U. S., at 751.
See also Engle, 456 U. S., at 129 (federal courts should avoid
"undercutting the State's ability to enforce its procedural
rules"). Thus, we held in Engle that a prisoner defaults a
claim by failing to follow a state rule requiring that it be
raised at trial or on direct appeal. The Court in Coleman
felt so strongly about "the important interests served by
state procedural rules at every stage of the judicial process
and the harm to the States that results when federal courts
ignore these rules," 501 U. S., at 749, that it imposed procedural default on a death-row inmate for filing his appellate

brief in state postconviction review just three days after theState's deadline.

Surely the Illinois Supreme Court's discretionary reviewrule and respondent's attempt to follow it are entitled to
at least as much respect. It is reasonable to assume that
the Illinois Supreme Court, like this Court, has establisheda discretionary review system in order to reserve its resources for issues of broad significance. Claims of viola-tions of well-established constitutional rules, important as
they may be to individual litigants, do not ordinarily presentsuch issues.

Discretionary review rules not only provide an effective
tool for apportioning limited resources, but also foster more
useful and effective advocacy. We have recognized on numerous occasions that the "process of `winnowing out weaker
arguments on appeal and focusing on' those more likely to
prevail . . . is the hallmark of effective appellate advocacy.' "
Smith v. Murray, 477 U. S. 527, 536 (1986) (quoting Jones v.
Barnes, 463 U. S. 745, 751-752 (1983)). This maxim is even
more germane regarding petitions for certiorari. The most
helpful and persuasive petitions for certiorari to this Court
usually present only one or two issues, and spend a considerable amount of time explaining why those questions of law
have sweeping importance and have divided or confused
other courts. Given the page limitations that we impose,
a litigant cannot write such a petition if he decides, or is
required, to raise every claim that might possibly warrant
reversal in his particular case.

The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit found that
these same factors animate the Illinois Supreme Court's
discretionary review rule. See 135 F. 3d 1194, 1200 (1998).
It also pointed out that Illinois courts in state habeas proceedings dismiss claims like respondent's on res judicata--
not waiver--grounds once they have been pressed at trial
and on direct appeal; it makes no difference whether the
prisoner has raised the claim in a petition for review to

the Illinois Supreme Court. Id., at 1199 (citing Gomez v.
Acevedo, 106 F. 3d 192, 195-196 (CA7 1997) (which cites in
turn People v. Coleman, 168 Ill. 2d 509, 522-523, 660 N. E.2d 919, 927 (1995))). The Illinois courts, in other words, are

prepared to stand behind the merits of their decisions regarding constitutional criminal procedure once a trial courtand an appellate court have passed on them. No state procedural ground independently supports such decisions, sofederal courts do not undercut Illinois' procedural rules by
reaching the merits of the constitutional claims resolvedtherein. See

Coleman, 501 U. S., at 736-738.
We ordinarily defer to a federal court of appeals' interpretation of state-law questions. See Bishop v. Wood, 426 U. S.
341, 346-347 (1976). The Court today nevertheless refuses
to conclude that the Illinois rule "discourages the filing of
certain petitions" (or even certain claims in petitions), and
surmises instead that the rule does nothing more than announce the State Supreme Court's desire to decide for itself
which cases it will consider on the merits. Ante, at 846.
This analysis strikes me as unsatisfactory. I would, consistent with the Seventh Circuit's view, read the Illinois rule as
dissuading the filing of fact-intensive claims of error that fail
to present any issue of broad significance. I would also deduce from the rule that Illinois prisoners need not present
their claims in discretionary review petitions before raising
them in federal court.

The Court's decision to the contrary is unwise. It will
impose unnecessary burdens on habeas petitioners; it will
delay the completion of litigation that is already more protracted than it should be; and, most ironically, it will undermine federalism by thwarting the interests of those state
supreme courts that administer discretionary dockets. If,
as the Court has repeatedly held, the purpose of our waiver
doctrine is to cultivate comity by respecting state procedural rules, then I agree with the Court of Appeals that
we should not create procedural obstacles when state prison526US3 Unit: $U67 [01-03-01 13:46:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ers follow those rules. In fact, I find these observations bythe Court of Appeals far more persuasive than anything in

today's opinion:

"Boerckel provided Illinois state courts with an op-portunity to review the matter in his direct appeal.

Federal courts do not snatch claims from state courtswhen they review claims not included in discretionary
petitions to state supreme courts. Our refusal to barBoerckel from habeas review is a recognition of the
inequity of penalizing a petitioner for following therequirements a state imposes on its second tier of
appellate review. Allowing petitioners to exercise thediscretion provided them by the states in selecting
claims to petition for leave to appeal does not offendcomity.

"We also note that requiring petitioners to argue allof their claims to the state supreme court would turn
federalism on its head. If a state has chosen a systemthat asks petitioners to be selective in deciding which
claims to raise in a petition for leave to appeal to thestate's highest court, we seriously question why this
Court should require the petitioner to raise all claims tothe state's highest court if he hopes to request habeas
review. The exhaustion requirement of $ 2254 does notrequire such a result.

"Moreover, contrary to O'Sullivan's suggestion, thisdecision will not `obliterate any opportunity for a state's
highest court to protect federally secured rights becauseit will leave state prisoners with little incentive to petition state supreme courts.' Respondent Br. at 19. Itis difficult to imagine that this holding will induce attorneys and defendants in state government custody towithhold an appropriate claim in a petition for leave to
appeal to the state's highest court, knowing that it can-not hurt and could only potentially help their cause.
O'Sullivan's argument assumes a remarkably risk-prone

group of defendants and attorneys, especially given thefact that `the success rate at trial and on appeal, while

low, is greater than the success rate on habeas corpus.'See Judith Resnik, Tiers, 57 S. Cal. L. Rev. 837, 894
(1984). We do not believe that it accurately predicts theeffect our holding will have on the incentives to petition
the Illinois Supreme Court."Finally, we reiterate our concern that `[t]reating an
omission from a petition for a discretionary hearing as aconclusive bar to federal review under $ 2254 could create a trap for unrepresented prisoners, whose efforts toidentify unsettled and important issues suitable for discretionary review would preclude review of errors underlaw already established.'

[144,] 147 [(CA7 1996)]." 135 F. 3d, at 1201-1202.
The Court of Appeals, in effect, held that federal courtsshould respect state procedural rules regardless of whether

applying them impedes access to federal habeas review orsignals the availability of such relief. The Court today, on
the other hand, admits that its decision may "disserv[e] . . .comity" and may cause an "unwelcome" influx of filings in
state supreme courts. Ante, at 847. It takes no issue withthe Court of Appeals' finding that Illinois would not invoke
an independent state procedural ground as an alternativebasis for denying relief to prisoners in respondent's situation. The Court today nevertheless requires defendantsin every criminal case in States like Illinois to present to
the state supreme court every federal issue that the defend-ants think might possibly warrant some relief if brought in
a future federal habeas petition.Thankfully, the Court leaves open the possibility that
state supreme courts with discretionary dockets may avoida deluge of undesirable claims by making a plain statement--as Arizona and South Carolina have done, see ibid.--that they do not wish the opportunity to review such claims
before they pass into the federal system. I agree with

862 O'SULLIVAN v. BOERCKEL

Breyer, J., dissenting
Justice Souter, ante, at 850 (concurring opinion), that aproper conception of comity obviously requires deference to

such a policy. But we should accord such deference underthe procedural default doctrine, not by allowing state courts
to construe for themselves the federal-law exhaustion requirement in $ 2254. No matter how plainly a state courthas said that it does not want the opportunity to review certain claims, discretionary review was either "available" to aprisoner when he was in the state system or it was not.
And when the prisoner arrives in federal court, either thetime for seeking discretionary review has run or it has not.
The key point is that federal courts should not find procedural default when a prisoner has relied on a state supreme
court's explicit statement that criminal defendants need not
present to it every claim that they might wish to assert as a
ground for relief in federal habeas proceedings.

I see no compelling reason to require States that already
have discretionary docket rules to take this additional step
of expressly disavowing any desire to be presented with
every such claim. In my view, it should be enough to avoid
waiving a claim that a state prisoner in a State like Illinois
raised that claim at trial and in his appeal as of right.

I respectfully dissent.

Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Stevens and
Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.

In my view, whether a state prisoner (who failed to seek
discretionary review in a state supreme court) can seek federal habeas relief depends upon the State's own preference.
If the State does not want the prisoner to seek discretionary
state review (or if it does not care), why should that failure
matter to federal habeas law? See, e. g., Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 731-732, 751 (1991) (emphasizing comity
interest in federal habeas). Illinois' procedural rules, like
similar rules in other States, suggest that the State does not
want prisoners to seek discretionary State Supreme Court

review except in unusual circumstances. See Ill. Sup. Ct.Rule 315(a) (1998); accord,

e. g., Colo. Rule App. 49 (1998)
(discretionary review granted "only when there are specialand important reasons therefor"); Idaho Rule App. 118(b)

(1999) (similar); Tenn. Rule App. Proc. 11(a) (1998) (similar).
And Justice Stevens has explained how the majority'sview of the matter will force upon state supreme courts

many petitions for review that fall outside the scope of theirdiscretionary review and which those courts would likely
prefer not to handle. Ante, at 858 (dissenting opinion).The small number of cases actually reviewed by state
courts with discretion over their dockets similarly suggests
that States such as Illinois have no particular interest in requiring state prisoners to seek discretionary review in every
case. In 1997, the latest year for which statistics are available, the Illinois Supreme Court granted review in only 33
of the 1,072 criminal petitions filed (3.1%). See memorandum from Carol R. Flango, National Center for State Courts,
to Supreme Court Library (June 11, 1999) (available in Clerk
of Court's case file). Nor is Illinois unique among state
courts of last resort employing discretionary review. See
ibid. (in 1997, Virginia's Supreme Court granted 30 of 1,160
criminal petitions for review (2.6%); California granted 39 of
3,265 (1.2%); Georgia granted 11 of 189 (5.8%); Ohio granted
16 of 595 (2.7%); Connecticut granted 24 of 113 (21.2%); Louisiana granted 127 of 1,410 (9.0%); Minnesota granted 38 of
222 (17.1%); North Carolina granted 23 of 237 (9.7%); Tennessee granted 41 of 549 (7.5%); Texas granted 111 of 1,677
(6.6%)). On the majority's view, these courts must now consider additional petitions for review of criminal cases, which
petitions will contain many claims raised only to preserve a
right to pursue those claims in federal habeas proceedings.
The result will add to the burdens of already overburdened
state courts and delay further a criminal process that is often
criticized for too much delay. Cf. Hohn v. United States, 524
U. S. 236, 264 (1998) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (complaining of

Breyer, J., dissenting
"interminable delays in the execution of state . . . criminalsentences"). I do not believe such a result "demonstrates

respect for the state courts." Rose v. Lundy, 455 U. S. 509,525 (1982) (Blackmun, J., concurring).

I nonetheless see cause for optimism. Justice Souter'sconcurring opinion suggests that a federal habeas court
should respect a State's desire that prisoners not file peti-tions for discretionary review, where the State has expressed the desire clearly. Ante, at 849-850. On that view,today's holding creates a kind of presumption that a habeas
petitioner must raise a given claim in a petition for discre-tionary review in state court prior to raising that claim on
federal habeas, but the State could rebut the presumptionthrough state law clearly expressing a desire to the contrary.
South Carolina has expressed that contrary preference. SeeIn re Exhaustion of State Remedies in Criminal and PostConviction Relief Cases, 321 S. C. 563, 471 S. E. 2d 454(1990). Other States may do the same.

Even were I to take the majority's approach, however,I would reverse the presumption. I would presume, on the
basis of Illinois' own rules and related statistics, and inthe absence of any clear legal expression to the contrary,
that Illinois does not mind if a state prisoner does not askits Supreme Court for discretionary review prior to seeking habeas relief in federal court. But the presumption towhich

Justice Souter refers would still help. And I writeto emphasize the fact that the majority has left the matter

open.

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe tenth circuit

No. 98-830. Argued April 19, 1999--Decided June 7, 1999
Land patents issued to western settlers pursuant to the Coal Lands Acts

of 1909 and 1910 conveyed the land and everything in it, except the
"coal," which was reserved to the United States. Patented lands
included reservation lands previously ceded by respondent Southern
Ute Indian Tribe to the United States. In 1938, the United States
restored to the Tribe, in trust, title to ceded reservation lands still
owned by the Government, including the reserved coal in lands patented
under the 1909 and 1910 Acts. These lands contain large quantities of
coalbed methane gas (CBM gas) within the coal formations. At the
time of the 1909 and 1910 Acts, such gas was considered a dangerous
waste product of coal mining, but it is now considered a valuable energy
source. Relying on a 1981 opinion by the Solicitor of the Department
of the Interior that CBM gas was not included in the Acts' coal reservation, oil and gas companies entered into CBM gas leases with the
individual landowners of some 200,000 acres of patented land in which
the Tribe owns the coal. The Tribe filed suit against petitioners, the
royalty owners and producers under the leases, and federal agencies and
officials (respondents here), seeking, inter alia, a declaration that CBM
gas is coal reserved by the 1909 and 1910 Acts. The District Court
granted the defendants summary judgment, holding that the plain
meaning of the term "coal" in the Acts is a solid rock substance that
does not include CBM gas. In reversing, the Tenth Circuit found the
term ambiguous, invoked the canon that ambiguities in land grants
should be resolved in favor of the sovereign, and concluded that the coal
reservation encompassed CBM gas. The Solicitor of the Interior has
withdrawn the 1981 opinion, and the United States now supports the
Tribe's position.

Held: The term "coal" as used in the 1909 and 1910 Acts does not encompass CBM gas. Pp. 872-880.

(a) The question here is not whether, based on what scientists know
today, CBM gas is a constituent of coal, but whether Congress so regarded it in 1909 and 1910. The common understanding of coal at that

866 AMOCO PRODUCTION CO. v. SOUTHERN UTE TRIBE

Syllabus
time would not have encompassed CBM gas. Most dictionaries of the
day defined coal as the solid fuel resource and CBM gas as a distinct
substance that escaped from coal during mining, rather than as a part
of the coal itself. As a practical matter, moreover, it is clear that Congress intended to reserve only the solid rock fuel that was mined,
shipped throughout the country, and then burned to power the Nation's railroads, ships, and factories. Public land statutes should be
interpreted in light of the country's condition when they were passed,
Leo Sheep Co. v. United States, 440 U. S. 668, 682, and coal, not gas, was
the primary energy for the Industrial Revolution. Congress passed the
Acts to address concerns over the short supply, mismanagement, and
fraudulent acquisition of this solid rock fuel and chose a narrow reservation to address these concerns. That Congress viewed CBM gas as
a dangerous waste product is evident from earlier mine-safety legislation that prescribed specific ventilation standards to dilute such gas.
Congress' view was confirmed by the fact that coal companies venting
the gas while mining coal made no attempt to capture or preserve the
gas. To the extent that Congress was aware of limited and sporadic
drilling for CBM gas as fuel, there is every reason to think it viewed
this as drilling for natural gas. Such a distinction is significant, since
the question is not whether Congress would have thought that CBM gas
had fuel value, but whether Congress thought it was coal fuel. In the
1909 and 1910 Acts, Congress chose to reserve only coal, not oil, natural
gas, or other energy resources. This reservation's limited nature is
confirmed by subsequent enactments, in which Congress used explicit
terms to reserve gas rights. Pp. 874-878.

(b) Respondents contend that Congress did not reserve the solid coal
but convey the CBM gas because the resulting split estate would be
impractical and mining would be difficult if miners had to capture and
preserve escaping CBM gas. It is unlikely that Congress considered
this issue, since it did not think that CBM gas would be a profitable energy source. Nor would the prospect of a split estate have
deterred Congress from reserving only coal, since including CBM gas
in the coal reservation would create a split estate between CBM gas
and natural gas, which would be at least as difficult to administer as a
split coal/CBM gas estate. Pp. 878-880.

During the second half of the 19th century, Congresssought to encourage the settlement of the West by providing

land in fee simple absolute to homesteaders who entered andcultivated tracts of a designated size for a period of years.
See, e. g., 1862 Homestead Act, 12 Stat. 392; 1877 DesertLand Act, ch. 107, 19 Stat. 377, as amended, 43 U. S. C.

$$ 321-323. Public lands classified as valuable for coal wereexempted from entry under the general land-grant statutes
and instead were made available for purchase under the 1864Coal Lands Act, ch. 205, $ 1, 13 Stat. 343, and the 1873 Coal
Lands Act, ch. 279, $ 1, 17 Stat. 607, which set a maximumlimit of 160 acres on individual entry and minimum prices
of $10 to $20 an acre. Lands purchased under these earlyCoal Lands Acts--like lands patented under the Homestead
Acts--were conveyed to the entryman in fee simple absolute,with no reservation of any part of the coal or mineral estate
to the United States. The coal mined from the lands pur-chased under the Coal Lands Acts and from other reserves
fueled the Industrial Revolution.At the turn of the 20th century, however, a coal famine
struck the West. See Hearings on Coal Lands and Coal-Land Laws of the United States before the House Committee
on Public Lands, 59th Cong., 2d Sess., 11-13 (1906) (tes-timony of Edgar E. Clark, Interstate Commerce Commissioner). At the same time, evidence of widespread fraudin the administration of federal coal lands came to light.

Railroads and other coal interests had exploited the system
to avoid paying for coal lands and to evade acreage restric-tions by convincing individuals to falsify affidavits, acquire

lands for homesteading, and then turn the land over to them.C. Mayer & G. Riley, Public Domain, Private Dominion 117-
118 (1985).In 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt responded to the
perceived crisis by withdrawing 64 million acres of public
land thought to contain coal from disposition under the public
land laws. Western Nuclear, 462 U. S., at 48-49. As a result, even homesteaders who had entered and worked the
land in good faith lost the opportunity to make it their own
unless they could prove to the land office that the land was
not valuable for coal.

President Roosevelt's order outraged homesteaders and
western interests, and Congress struggled for the next three
years to construct a compromise that would reconcile the
competing interests of protecting settlers and managing
federal coal lands for the public good. President Roosevelt
and others urged Congress to begin issuing limited patents
that would sever the surface and mineral estates and allow
for separate disposal of each. See id., at 49 (quoting Special
Message to Congress, Jan. 22, 1909, 15 Messages and Papers
of the Presidents 7266). Although various bills were introduced in Congress that would have severed the estates--

coal, lignite, oil, and natural gas in the public lands").Finally, Congress passed the 1909 Act, which authorized
the Federal Government, for the first time, to issue limited
land patents. In contrast to the broad reservations of min-eral rights proposed in the failed bills, however, the 1909

Act provided for only a narrow reservation. The 1909 Actauthorized issuance of patents to individuals who had already made good-faith agricultural entries onto tracts lateridentified as coal lands, but the issuance was to be subject to
"a reservation to the United States of all coal in said lands,
and the right to prospect for, mine, and remove the same."

to "mine coal for use on the land for domestic purposes prior
to the disposal by the United States of the coal deposit."
Ibid. A similar Act in 1910 opened the remaining coal lands
to new entry under the homestead laws, subject to the
same reservation of coal to the United States. 30 U. S. C.

Among the lands patented to settlers under the 1909 and
1910 Acts were former reservation lands of the Southern
Ute Indian Tribe, which the Tribe had ceded to the United
States in 1880 in return for certain allotted lands provided
for their settlement. Act of June 15, 1880, ch. 223, 21 Stat.
199. In 1938, the United States restored to the Tribe, in
trust, title to the ceded reservation lands still owned by the
United States, including the reserved coal in lands patented
under the 1909 and 1910 Acts. As a result, the Tribe now
has equitable title to the coal in lands within its reservation
settled by homesteaders under the 1909 and 1910 Acts.

We are advised that over 20 million acres of land were
patented under the 1909 and 1910 Acts and that the lands--
including those lands in which the Tribe owns the coal--contain large quantities of CBM gas. Brief for Montana et al.

Opinion of the Court
gas had long been considered a dangerous waste product ofcoal mining. By the 1970's, however, it was apparent that

CBM gas could be a significant energy resource, see Duel &Kimm, Coalbed Gas: A Source of Natural Gas, Oil & Gas J.,
June 16, 1975, p. 47, and, in the shadow of the Arab oil
embargo, the Federal Government began to encourage theimmediate production of CBM gas through grants, see 42

U. S. C. $$ 5901-5915 (1994 ed. and Supp. III), and substan-tial tax credits, see 26 U. S. C. $ 29 (1994 ed. and Supp. III).

Commercial development of CBM gas was hampered, how-ever, by uncertainty over its ownership. "In order to expedite the development of this energy source," the Solicitor
of the Department of the Interior issued a 1981 opinion
concluding that the reservation of coal to the United States
in the 1909 and 1910 Acts did not encompass CBM gas.
See Ownership of and Right to Extract Coalbed Gas in Federal Coal Deposits, 88 I. D. 538, 539. In reliance on the Solicitor's 1981 opinion, oil and gas companies entered into
leases to produce CBM gas with individual landowners holding title under 1909 and 1910 Act patents to some 200,000
acres in which the Tribe owns the coal.

In 1991, the Tribe brought suit in Federal District Court
against petitioners, the royalty owners and producers under
the oil and gas leases covering that land, and the federal
agencies and officials responsible for the administration of
lands held in trust for the Tribe. The Tribe sought, inter
alia, a declaration that Congress' reservation of coal in the
1909 and 1910 Acts extended to CBM gas, so that the Tribe--
not the successors in interest of the land patentees--owned
the CBM gas.

The District Court granted summary judgment for the
defendants, holding that the plain meaning of "coal" is the
"solid rock substance" used as fuel, which does not include
CBM gas. 874 F. Supp. 1142, 1154 (Colo. 1995). On appeal,
a panel of the Court of Appeals reversed. 119 F. 3d 816,
819 (CA10 1997). The court then granted rehearing en banc

Opinion of the Court
on the question whether the term "coal" in the 1909 and1910 Acts "unambiguously excludes or includes CBM." 151

F. 3d, at 1256. Over a dissenting opinion by Judge Tacha,joined by two other judges, the en banc court agreed with
the panel. Ibid. The court held that the term "coal" wasambiguous.

Ibid. It invoked the interpretive canon thatambiguities in land grants should be resolved in favor of the

sovereign and concluded that the coal reservation encom-passed CBM gas. Ibid.

The United States did not petition for, or participate in,the rehearing en banc. Instead, it filed a supplemental
brief explaining that the Solicitor of the Interior was re-considering the 1981 Solicitor's opinion in light of the panel's
decision. Brief for Federal Respondents 14, n. 8. On theday the federal respondents' response to petitioners' certiorari petition was due, see id., at 47, n. 37, the Solicitor ofthe Interior withdrew the 1981 opinion in a one-line order,
see Addendum to Brief for Federal Respondents in Opposi-tion 1a. The federal respondents now support the Tribe's
position that CBM gas is coal reserved by the 1909 and1910 Acts.

II
We begin our discussion as the parties did, with a briefoverview of the chemistry and composition of coal. Coal is

a heterogeneous, noncrystalline sedimentary rock composedprimarily of carbonaceous materials. See,

e. g., Gorbaty &Larsen, Coal Structure and Reactivity, in 3 Encyclopedia

of Physical Science and Technology 437 (R. Meyers ed. 2d ed.1992). It is formed over millions of years from decaying
plant material that settles on the bottom of swamps and isconverted by microbiological processes into peat. D. Van
Krevelen, Coal 90 (3d ed. 1993). Over time, the resultingpeat beds are buried by sedimentary deposits.

Id., at 91.As the beds sink deeper and deeper into the earth's crust,

the peat is transformed by chemical reactions which increasethe carbon content of the fossilized plant material. Ibid.

526US3 Unit: $U68 [12-11-00 22:30:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN

873Cite as: 526 U. S. 865 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
The process in which peat transforms into coal is referred toas coalification. Ibid.

The coalification process generates methane and othergases. R. Rogers, Coalbed Methane: Principles and Practice 148 (1994). Because coal is porous, some of that gas isretained in the coal. CBM gas exists in the coal in three
basic states: as free gas; as gas dissolved in the water in coal;and as gas "adsorped" on the solid surface of the coal, that
is, held to the surface by weak forces called van der Waalsforces.

Id., at 16-17, 117. These are the same three statesor conditions in which gas is stored in other rock formations.

Because of the large surface area of coal pores, however, amuch higher proportion of the gas is adsorped on the surface
of coal than is adsorped in other rock. Id., at 16-17. Whenpressure on the coalbed is decreased, the gas in the coal formation escapes. As a result, CBM gas is released from coalas the coal is mined and brought to the surface.

III
While the modern science of coal provides a useful back-drop for our discussion and is consistent with our ultimate

disposition, it does not answer the question presented to us.The question is not whether, given what scientists know
today, it makes sense to regard CBM gas as a constituentof coal but whether Congress so regarded it in 1909 and
1910. In interpreting statutory mineral reservations likethe one at issue here, we have emphasized that Congress
"was dealing with a practical subject in a practical way"and that it intended the terms of the reservation to be understood in "their ordinary and popular sense." Burke v.
Southern Pacific R. Co., 234 U. S. 669, 679 (1914) (reject-ing "scientific test" for determining whether a reservation

of "mineral lands" included "petroleum lands"); see alsoPerrin v. United States, 444 U. S. 37, 42 (1979) ("[U]nless
otherwise defined, words will be interpreted as taking theirordinary, contemporary, common meaning" at the time

874 AMOCO PRODUCTION CO. v. SOUTHERN UTE TRIBE

Opinion of the Court
Congress enacted the statute). We are persuaded that thecommon conception of coal at the time Congress passed

the 1909 and 1910 Acts was the solid rock substance thatwas the country's primary energy resource.

A
At the time the Acts were passed, most dictionaries de-fined coal as the solid fuel resource. For example, one contemporary dictionary defined coal as a "solid and more orless distinctly stratified mineral, varying in color from darkbrown to black, brittle, combustible, and used as fuel, notfusible without decomposition and very insoluble." 2 Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia 1067 (1906). See also Amer-ican Dictionary of the English Language 244 (N. Webster
1889) (defining "coal" as a "black, or brownish black, solid,combustible substance, consisting, like charcoal, mainly of
carbon, but more compact"); 2 New English Dictionary onHistorical Principles 549 (J. Murray ed. 1893) (defining coal
as a "mineral, solid, hard, opaque, black, or blackish, foundin seams or strata in the earth, and largely used as fuel");
Webster's New International Dictionary of the EnglishLanguage 424 (W. Harris & F. Allen eds. 1916) (defining coal
as a "black, or brownish black, solid, combustible mineralsubstance").

In contrast, dictionaries of the day defined CBM gas--then called "marsh gas," "methane," or "fire-damp"--as a
distinct substance, a gas "contained in" or "given off by"coal, but not as coal itself. See,

e. g., 3 Century Dictionaryand Cyclopedia 2229 (1906) (defining "fire-damp" as "[t]he gas

contained in coal, often given off by it in large quantities,and exploding, on ignition, when mixed with atmospheric
air"; noting that "[f]ire-damp is a source of great danger tolife in coal-mines").

As these dictionary definitions suggest, the common un-derstanding of coal in 1909 and 1910 would not have encompassed CBM gas, both because it is a gas rather than a solid

526US3 Unit: $U68 [12-11-00 22:30:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN

875Cite as: 526 U. S. 865 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
mineral and because it was understood as a distinct sub-stance that escaped from coal as the coal was mined, rather

than as a part of the coal itself.

B
As a practical matter, moreover, it is clear that, by re-serving coal in the 1909 and 1910 Act patents, Congress intended to reserve only the solid rock fuel that was mined,shipped throughout the country, and then burned to power
the Nation's railroads, ships, and factories. Cf. Leo SheepCo. v. United States, 440 U. S. 668, 682 (1979) (public land
statutes should be interpreted in light of "the conditionof the country when the acts were passed" (internal quotation marks omitted)). In contrast to natural gas, whichwas not yet an important source of fuel at the turn of the
century, coal was the primary energy for the Industrial Rev-olution. See,

e. g., D. Yergin, The Prize 543 (1991). Seealso Brief for Federal Respondents 30 (recognizing that the

three primary sources of energy in the United States at theturn of the century were coal, oil, and wood, and that natural
gas--even from conventional reservoirs--was not yet an im-portant energy resource).

As the history recounted in Part I, supra, establishes,Congress passed the 1909 and 1910 Acts to address concerns
over the short supply, mismanagement, and fraudulent ac-quisition of this solid rock fuel resource. Rejecting broader
proposals, Congress chose a narrow reservation of the re-source that would address the exigencies of the crisis at
hand without unduly burdening the rights of homesteadersor impeding the settlement of the West.

It is evident that Congress viewed CBM gas not as partof the solid fuel resource it was attempting to conserve and
manage but as a dangerous waste product, which escapedfrom coal as the coal was mined. Congress was well aware
by 1909 that the natural gas found in coal formations wasreleased during coal mining and posed a serious threat to

526US3 Unit: $U68 [12-11-00 22:30:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
mine safety. Explosions in coal mines sparked by CBM gasoccurred with distressing frequency in the late 19th and

early 20th centuries. Brief for National Mining Associationas

Amicus Curiae 7. Congress was also well aware that
the CBM gas needed to be vented to the greatest extent
possible. Almost 20 years prior to the passage of the 1909and 1910 Acts, Congress had enacted the first federal coalmine-safety law which, among other provisions, prescribedspecific ventilation standards for coal mines of a certain
depth "so as to dilute and render harmless . . . the noxiousor poisonous gases." 1891 Territorial Mine Inspection Act,

$ 6, 26 Stat. 1105. See also 3 Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia, supra, at 2229 (explaining the dangers associated
with fire-damp).

That CBM gas was considered a dangerous waste product
which escaped from coal, rather than part of the valuable
coal fuel itself, is also confirmed by the fact that coal companies venting the gas to prevent its accumulation in the
mines made no attempt to capture or preserve it. The more
gas that escaped from the coal once it was brought to the
surface, the better it was for the mining companies because
it decreased the risk of a dangerous gas buildup during
transport and storage. Cf. E. Moore, Coal: Its Properties,
Analysis, Classification, Geology, Extraction, Uses and Distribution 308 (1922) (noting that the presence of gases such
as methane in the coal increases the risk of spontaneous
combustion of the coal during storage).

(The fact that CBM gas was known to escape naturally
from coal distinguishes it from the "producer gas" that was
generated from coal in the 1800's. Brief for Federal Respondents 30. Producer gas was produced by "destructive
distillation, that is, by heating the coal to a temperature
where it decomposed chemically." App. 531 (reproducing
Perry, The Gasification of Coal, Scientific American 230,
(Mar. 1974)). The natural escape of CBM gas from the coal
also distinguishes CBM gas from other "volatile matter,"

Opinion of the Court
expelled when coal is heated, or liquid "coal extracts," which"can be extracted through the use of appropriate solvents."

Brief for Federal Respondents 26-27. The federal respond-ents' expressed concern that if the coal reservation does not
encompass CBM gas it does not encompass these "components" of coal, see ibid., is unfounded.)There is some evidence of limited and sporadic exploitation of CBM gas as a fuel prior to the passage of the 1909and 1910 Acts. See,

e. g., E. Craig & M. Myers, Ownership
of Methane Gas in Coalbeds, 24 Rocky Mt. Min. L. Inst. 767,768 (1978) ("As early as 1746, methane was being drained

from an English coal mine through pipes and used for heating"); see also United States Steel Corp. v. Hoge, 503 Pa.
140, 146, 468 A. 2d 1380, 1383 (1983) (noting that as early as
1900, "certain wells were drilled [into coalbeds in Pennsylvania, which] produced coalbed gas"). It seems unlikely,
though, that Congress considered this limited drilling for
CBM gas. To the extent Congress had an awareness of
it, there is every reason to think it viewed the extraction
of CBM gas as drilling for natural gas, not mining coal.

That distinction is significant because the question before
us is not whether Congress would have thought that CBM
gas had some fuel value, but whether Congress considered
it part of the coal fuel. When it enacted the 1909 and 1910
Acts, Congress did not reserve all minerals or energy resources in the lands. It reserved only coal, and then only
in lands that were specifically identified as valuable for coal.
It chose not to reserve oil, natural gas, or any other known
or potential energy resources.

The limited nature of the 1909 and 1910 Act reservations is confirmed by subsequent congressional enactments.
When Congress wanted to reserve gas rights that might
yield valuable fuel, it did so in explicit terms. In 1912, for
example, Congress enacted a statute that reserved "oil and
gas" in Utah lands. Act of Aug. 24, 1912, 37 Stat. 496. In
addition, both the 1912 Act and a later Act passed in 1914

526US3 Unit: $U68 [12-11-00 22:30:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN
878 AMOCO PRODUCTION CO. v. SOUTHERN UTE TRIBE

Opinion of the Court
continued the tradition begun in the 1909 and 1910 Acts ofreserving only those minerals enumerated in the statute.

See ibid.; Act of July 17, 1914, 38 Stat. 509, as amended,30 U. S. C. $$ 121-123 (providing that "[l]ands withdrawn or
classified as phosphate, nitrate, potash, oil, gas, or asphalticminerals, or which are valuable for those deposits," could be
patented, subject to a reservation to the United States of"the deposits on account of which the lands so patented were
withdrawn or classified or reported as valuable"). It wasnot until 1916 that Congress passed a public lands Act containing a general reservation of valuable minerals in thelands. See Stock-Raising Homestead Act, ch. 9, 39 Stat. 862,
as amended, 43 U. S. C. $ 299 (reserving "all the coal andother minerals in the lands" in all lands patented under the
Act). See also Western Nuclear, 462 U. S., at 49 ("Unlikethe preceding statutes containing mineral reservations, the
[1916 Stock-Raising Homestead Act] was not limited to landsclassified as mineral in character, and it did not reserve only
specifically identified minerals").

C
Respondents contend that Congress did not reserve thesolid coal but convey the CBM gas because the resulting

split estate would be impractical and would make miningthe coal difficult because the miners would have to capture
and preserve the CBM gas that escaped during mining.See, e. g., Brief for Respondent Southern Ute Indian Tribe
46; see also id., at 25-26 (emphasizing that the reservationincludes the right to "mine" the coal, indicating that "Congress reserved all rights needed to develop the underlyingcoal" including the right to vent CBM gas during mining).
We doubt Congress would have given much considerationto these problems, however, because--as noted above--it
does not appear to have given consideration to the possi-bility that CBM gas would one day be a profitable energy
source developed on a large scale.

879Cite as: 526 U. S. 865 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
It may be true, nonetheless, that the right to mine thecoal implies the right to release gas incident to coal mining

where it is necessary and reasonable to do so. The rightto dissipate the CBM gas where reasonable and necessary
to mine the coal does not, however, imply the ownership
of the gas in the first instance. Rather, it simply reflectsthe established common-law right of the owner of one mineral estate to use, and even damage, a neighboring estateas necessary and reasonable to the extraction of his own
minerals. See, e. g., Williams v. Gibson, 84 Ala. 228, 4 So.350 (1888); Rocky Mountain Mineral Law Foundation, 6
American Law of Mining $ 200.04 (2d ed. 1997). Given that
split estates were already common at the time the 1909 and
1910 Acts were passed, see, e. g., Chartiers Block Coal Co. v.
Mellon, 152 Pa. 286, 25 A. 597 (1893), and that the common
law has proved adequate to the task of resolving the resulting conflicts between estates, there is no reason to think that
the prospect of a split estate would have deterred Congress
from reserving only the coal.

Were a case to arise in which there are two commercially
valuable estates and one is to be damaged in the course of
extracting the other, a dispute might result, but it could be
resolved in the ordinary course of negotiation or adjudication. That is not the issue before us, however. The question is one of ownership, not of damage or injury.

In all events, even were we to construe the coal reservation to encompass CBM gas, a split estate would result.
The United States concedes (and the Tribe does not dispute)
that once the gas originating in the coal formation migrates
to surrounding rock formations it belongs to the natural
gas, rather than the coal, estate. See Brief for Federal Respondents 35; Brief for Respondent Southern Ute Indian
Tribe 3, n. 4. Natural gas from other sources may also
exist in the lands at issue. Including the CBM gas in the
coal reservation would, therefore, create a split gas estate
that would be at least as difficult to administer as a split

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
coal/CBM gas estate. If CBM gas were reserved with thecoal estate, those developing the natural gas resources in

the land would have to allocate the gas between the naturalgas and coal estates based on some assessment of how much
had migrated outside the coal itself. There is no reason tothink Congress would have been more concerned about the
creation of a split coal/CBM gas estate than the creation ofa split gas estate.

Because we conclude that the most natural interpreta-tion of "coal" as used in the 1909 and 1910 Acts does not
encompass CBM gas, we need not consider the applicabilityof the canon that ambiguities in land grants are construed
in favor of the sovereign or the competing canons relied onby petitioners.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.

It is so ordered.
Justice Breyer took no part in the consideration ordecision of this case.

Justice Ginsburg, dissenting.
I would affirm the judgment below substantially for thereasons stated by the Court of Appeals and the federal

respondents. See 151 F. 3d 1251, 1256-1267 (CA10 1998)(en banc); Brief for Federal Respondents 14-16. As the
Court recognizes, in 1909 and 1910 coalbed methane gas(CBM) was a liability. See ante, at 870-871, 875-876. Congress did not contemplate that the surface owner would beresponsible for it. More likely, Congress would have assumed that the coal owner had dominion over, and attendantresponsibility for, CBM. I do not find it clear that Congress
understood dominion would shift if and when the liabilitybecame an asset. I would therefore apply the canon that
ambiguities in land grants are construed in favor of the sov-ereign. See

Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins,dissenting.

This case involves the legitimacy of an affirmative-action planadopted by the Dallas Fire Department. The Court of Appeals
for the Fifth Circuit held that there was insufficient evidence ofpast discrimination in the Dallas Fire Department to justify the
fire department's policy of promoting some women and minoritiesover white males who had achieved scores within the same "band"
on a civil service exam. See 150 F. 3d 438, 441 (1998); Pet. forCert. 4. And the petitioners ask us to review that determination.

The defendants offered the following evidence of past discrimi-nation in support of the plan: (1) The Dallas Fire Department did
not hire its first black firefighter until 1969. App. to Pet. forCert. 72. (2) Blacks and Latinos comprised less than 1 percent
of the fire department in 1972. Ibid. (3) In 1972, the Depart-ment of Justice concluded that the fire department had engaged
in impermissible racial discrimination. Ibid. (4) In 1976, theDallas Fire Department entered into a consent decree with the
Department of Justice "to alleviate the effects of any past discrim-ination that might have occurred." Id., at 62. (5) The consent
decree and subsequent plans led to advances in the hiring ofminorities and women, and, in 1988, 38.7 percent of the entry-level
"fire and rescue officers" were black or Latino and 1.9 percentwere women. See id., at 143. (6) In the upper ranks of the fire
department, in 1988, blacks and Latinos made up 14.8 percent ofthe "driver-engineers," 5.8 percent of the "lieutenants," and 5.2
percent of the "executives/deputy chiefs." Pet. for Cert. 4-5;App. to Pet. for Cert. 141-143. Women made up 1.6 percent of
the "driver-engineers," but there were no women "lieutenants"or "executives/deputy chiefs." Ibid.

This Court has held that a government entity's implementationof race-conscious measures that are narrowly tailored to remedy
past discrimination by that entity does not violate the Equal Pro526ORD Unit: $PT1 [01-08-01 16:20:53] PGT: ORD1BV (Bound Volume)

tection Clause. See, e. g., Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pen~ a,515 U. S. 200, 237 (1995); Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S.
469, 507 (1989); United States v. Paradise, 480 U. S. 149, 167 (1987)(plurality opinion). And it has indicated that significant statistical disparities between the pool of those selected for a job andthose eligible for the job may be used, among other things, to
show past discrimination. See Croson, supra, at 501-502. Inthis case, there are both statistics and other evidentiary indicia
of past discrimination, including a finding by the Department ofJustice of a history of discrimination. Courts of Appeals apparently have upheld affirmative-action plans in other cities basedon similar records. See McNamara v. Chicago, 138 F. 3d 1219,
1223-1224 (CA7), cert. denied, 525 U. S. 981 (1998); see also Stuartv. Roche, 951 F. 2d 446, 450-452 (CA1 1991), cert. denied, 504
U. S. 913 (1992).In light of the many affirmative-action plans in effect throughout the Nation, the question presented, concerning the means ofproving past discrimination, is an important one; the lower courts
are divided; and the Fifth Circuit's decision may be questionablein light of our precedents. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent
from the denial of certiorari in this case.

AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT OF 1990.

Effect of receiving Social Security disability benefits.--Pursuit and receipt of Social Security disability benefits does not estop a recipient from
pursuing an ADA claim or set up a strong presumption against ADA success, but recipient must explain why her Social Security claim that she is
unable to work is consistent with her ADA claim that she can perform her
job's essential functions, at least with reasonable accommodation. Cleveland v. Policy Management Systems Corp., p. 795.

ANTITRUST ACTS.

Federal Trade Commission Act--Nonprofit association--FTC jurisdiction--Abbreviated rule-of-reason analysis.--FTC's jurisdiction under Act
extends to a nonprofit association that provides substantial economic benefit to its for-profit members; because anticompetitive effects of petitioner's
advertising restrictions were not intuitively obvious, Ninth Circuit erred
in using an abbreviated rule-of-reason analysis to determine whether restrictions violated antitrust laws. California Dental Assn. v. FTC, p. 756.

paying compensation or providing an adequate postdeprivation remedy for
loss. Monterey v. Del Monte Dunes at Monterey, Ltd., p. 687.

COAL LANDS ACTS.

Ownership of coalbed methane (CBM) gas.--Term "coal" as used in
1909 and 1910 Coal Lands Acts does not encompass CBM gas, and thus
does not give ownership of CBM gas to respondent Tribe, which owns coal
rights reserved by Acts. Amoco Production Co. v. Southern Ute Tribe,

2. State franchise tax--Res judicata and collateral estoppel.--Alabama
Supreme Court's refusal to permit petitioners to raise their constitutional
claims against state franchise tax because of res judicata or collateral estoppel is inconsistent with Fourteenth Amendment's due process guarantee. South Central Bell Telephone Co. v. Alabama, p. 160.

III. Equal Protection of the Laws.

1. Public universities--Instructional standards--Collective bargaining.--Ohio Supreme Court's invalidation of a state law exempting public
universities' standards for professors' instructional workloads from collective bargaining cannot be reconciled with Equal Protection Clause. Central State Univ. v. American Assn. of Univ. Professors, Central State Univ.
Chapter, p. 124.

2. Redistricting plan--Summary judgment.--Because North Carolina
General Assembly's motivation in drawing that State's Twelfth Congressional District was in dispute, appellees were not entitled to summary
judgment on their claim that district was a racial gerrymander violating
equal protection. Hunt v. Cromartie, p. 541.

CONSTITUTIONAL LAW--Continued.
IV. Privilege Against Self-Incrimination.

Sentencing phase--Effect of guilty plea.--A guilty plea does not waive
Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination in case's sentencing
phase; nor may a court draw an adverse inference from defendant's silence
in determining facts about crime that bear on sentence's severity. Mitchell v. United States, p. 314.

V. Privileges or Immunities.

Right to travel--Durational residency requirements for welfare recipients.--California's requirement limiting new residents to welfare benefit
level paid in State of their former residence violates right to travel guaranteed by Fourteenth Amendment; its constitutionality is not resuscitated
by a change in federal welfare law. Saenz v. Roe, p. 489.

VI. Right to Liberty.

Right to practice law.--A prosecutor does not violate an attorney's
Fourteenth Amendment right to practice his profession by executing a
warrant to search attorney while his client is testifying before a grand
jury. Conn v. Gabbert, p. 286.

VII. Searches and Seizures.

1. Automobile searches--Passengers' belongings.--Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments permit police with probable cause to search a car to
inspect passengers' belongings that are capable of concealing object of
search. Wyoming v. Houghton, p. 295.

2. Automobile seizures--Forfeitable contraband.--Fourth Amendment
does not require police to obtain a warrant before seizing an automobile
from a public place when they have probable cause to believe that it is
forfeitable contraband. Florida v. White, p. 559.

3. Media "ride-along" with police--Qualified immunity.--A media
"ride-along" search of petitioners' home violates Fourth Amendment, but
because state of law was not clearly established at time home was entered,
respondent officers are entitled to qualified immunity. Wilson v. Layne,
p. 603.

4. Media "ride-along" with police--Qualified immunity.--Where respondent homeowners allege that a media "ride-along" involving a search
of their home violates Fourth Amendment, but petitioner officers are entitled to a qualified immunity defense under Wilson v. Layne, Ninth Circuit's judgment for respondents is vacated. Hanlon v. Berger, p. 808.

Habeas Corpus.

1. Carjacking--"Intent" element.--In criminalizing carjacking "with
the intent to cause death or serious bodily harm," 18 U. S. C. $ 2119 does
not require Government to prove that a carjacker had an unconditional
intent to kill or harm in all events, but merely requires proof of such an
intent if necessary to effect a carjacking. Holloway v. United States, p. 1.

2. Carjacking--Offense elements.--Title 18 U. S. C. $ 2119 establishes
not a single crime with a choice of three maximum penalties, but three
distinct offenses, each of which must be charged by indictment, proved
beyond a reasonable doubt, and submitted to a jury for verdict. Jones v.
United States, p. 227.

3. Continuing criminal enterprise--Jury findings--Specific violations.--A jury in a continuing criminal enterprise case under 21 U. S. C.

make up that "continuing series." Richardson v. United States, p. 813.

4. German citizen's execution.--Court declines to exercise its original

p. 111.

5. Illegal gratuities to federal officials--Link with "official act."--
In order to establish an illegal gratuity in violation of 18 U. S. C.

$ 201(c)(1)(A), Government must prove a link between a thing of value
conferred upon a federal official and a specific "official act" for or because
of which it was given. United States v. Sun-Diamond Growers of Cal.,
p. 398.

6. Proper venue--Crime of violence--Firearm use.--Venue in a prosecution for using or carrying a firearm "during and in relation to any crime
of violence," 18 U. S. C. $ 924(c)(1), is proper in any district where crime

JURISDICTION.

1. Court of Appeals for Armed Forces--Injunction--Dropping respondent from Air Force rolls.--CAAF lacked jurisdiction under All
Writs Act to enjoin officials from dropping respondent after he was sentenced by a court-martial to more than six months' confinement and served
more than six months of that sentence, where CAAF's process was neither
"in aid of" its strictly circumscribed jurisdiction to review courts-martial
nor "necessary or appropriate" in light of a servicemember's alternative
opportunities to seek relief. Clinton v. Goldsmith, p. 529.

2. Federal district courts--Removal from state court--Jurisdictional
hierarchy.--In cases removed from state to federal court, there is no
unyielding jurisdictional hierarchy requiring federal court to adjudicate
subject-matter jurisdiction before considering a challenge to personal jurisdiction. Ruhrgas AG v. Marathon Oil Co., p. 574.

3. Federal district courts--Tribal court exhaustion doctrine.--Doctrine, which requires a district court to stay its hand while a tribal court
determines its own jurisdiction, does not extend to claims filed pursuant to
