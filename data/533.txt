CASES ADJUDGED

IN THE

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

AT
OCTOBER TERM, 2000

KANSAS v. COLORADO
on exceptions to report of special master
No. 105, Orig. Argued March 19, 2001--Decided June 11, 2001
The Arkansas River rises in Colorado and flows through Kansas and several other States before emptying into the Mississippi River. In 1949,
Congress approved the Arkansas River Compact (Compact), which Colorado and Kansas negotiated, and which provided in Article IV-D that,
inter alia, future development of the river basin could not materially
deplete the usable quantity or availability to other users of the river's
waters. In 1986, Kansas filed a complaint alleging that Colorado had
violated the Compact. In his first report, the Special Master found
that post-Compact increases in groundwater well pumping in Colorado
had materially depleted the waters in violation of Article IV-D; in
his second report, he recommended that damages be awarded to Kansas; and in his third report, he recommended that such damages be
measured by Kansas' losses attributable to Compact violations since
1950, be paid in money not water, and include prejudgment interest
from 1969 to the date of judgment. Colorado has filed four objections
to the third report, Kansas has filed one, and the United States submits
that all objections should be overruled.

Held:

1. The recommended damages award does not violate the Eleventh
Amendment. Thus, Colorado's first exception is overruled. Colorado
contends that the Amendment precludes damages based on losses sustained by individual Kansas farmers, as the Report recommends. Kansas has unquestionably made the required showing that it has a direct
interest of its own and is not merely seeking recovery for the benefit of

1

2 KANSAS v. COLORADO

Syllabus
individuals who are the real parties in interest. Oklahoma ex rel.
Johnson v. Cook, 304 U. S. 387, 396. This is but one of several proceedings in which Kansas' own interest in preventing upstream diversion of
the river has justified the exercise of this Court's original jurisdiction.
Kansas has been in full control of this litigation since its inception, and
its right to control the disposition of any recovery of damages is unencumbered. The injury to individual farmers is but one component of
the formula adopted by the Special Master to quantify damages here.
When a State properly invokes this Court's original jurisdiction, neither
the measure of, nor the method for calculating, damages can retrospectively negate that jurisdiction. Nor would jurisdiction be affected by
Kansas' postjudgment decision about whether to deposit the money recovered in its general coffers or use the money to benefit those who
were hurt by the violation. Pp. 7-9.

2. The unliquidated nature of Kansas' money damages does not bar
an award of prejudgment interest. Thus, Colorado's second exception
is overruled. This Court has long recognized that the common-law distinction between liquidated and unliquidated damages is unsound,
Funkhouser v. J. B. Preston Co., 290 U. S. 163, 168, and that a monetary
award does not fully compensate for an injury unless it includes an interest component, see, e. g., Milwaukee v. Cement Div., National Gypsum
Co., 515 U. S. 189, 195. The Special Master acted properly in declining
to follow this long-repudiated common-law rule. Pp. 9-12.

3. The Special Master determined the appropriate rate for the prejudgment interest award and determined that interest should begin
running in 1969. Colorado's third exception is overruled insofar as
it challenges the interest rates and sustained insofar as it challenges
the Special Master's recommendation that the interest should begin
to accrue in 1969. Kansas' exception that the interest should begin to
accrue in 1950 is overruled. Pp. 12-16.

(a) Because this Court has decided that Kansas could measure a
portion of its damages by individual farmers' losses, the interest rates
applicable to individuals in the relevant years, rather than the lower
rates available to States, may properly be used to calculate damages.
Pp. 12-13.

(b) The Special Master concluded that interest should be awarded
according to fairness considerations rather than a rigid theory of compensation for money withheld. Kansas' argument that this Court has
effectively foreclosed that equities-balancing approach has some merit,
but this Court cannot say that by 1949 the Court's case law had developed sufficiently to put Colorado on notice that prejudgment interest
would automatically be awarded from the time of injury for a Compact
violation. Therefore, the Special Master acted properly in analyzing

3Cite as: 533 U. S. 1 (2001)
Syllabus
this case's facts and awarding only as much prejudgment interest as
was required by balancing the equities. The equities support an award
beginning on a date later than the date of first violation. The factors
the Special Master considered--that no one thought that the pact was
being violated in the early years after it was signed and that a long
interval passed between the original injuries and these proceedings, as
well as the dramatic impact of compounding interest over many years--
fully justify his view that prejudgment interest should not be awarded
for any years before either party was aware of the excessive pumping.
Colorado suggests that prejudgment interest should begin to accrue in
1985, the year the complaint was filed, rather than 1969, when Colorado
knew or should have known that it was violating the Compact. Though
the issue is close, the equities favor the later date. In overruling Colorado's exceptions to the second report, this Court held that Kansas
was not guilty of inexcusable delay in failing to complain more promptly
about the post-Compact pumping because the nature and extent of the
violations were unclear even years after the violation became obvious.
That conclusion is a double-edged sword. Both States' interests would
have been served had the claim been advanced promptly after its
basis became known, and it was clear that once the proceedings started
they would be complex and protracted. Given the uncertainty over the
damages' scope that prevailed from 1968 and 1985 and the fact Kansas
had the power to begin the process by which those damages would be
quantified, Colorado's request that the Court deny prejudgment interest
for that time is reasonable. Pp. 13-16.

4. The Special Master properly determined the value of the crop
losses attributable to Compact violations. Thus, Colorado's fourth
exception is overruled. Kansas and Colorado disagreed as to how much
additional crop yield would have been produced with the missing water.
Kansas' experts relied upon the hypothesis of a generally linear relationship between water available for use and increased crop yields.
Colorado, whose own expert recanted an alternative proposal for calculating damages, attempts to poke holes in Kansas' methodology
through a speculative application of economic theory. That attack is
unpersuasive, given Colorado's inability to mount an effective challenge
to Kansas' experts on their own terms and its complete failure to provide a plausible alternative estimate of crop damage. Pp. 16-20.

Colorado's exceptions sustained in part and overruled in part; Kansas'

exception overruled; and case remanded.

part, in which Scalia and Thomas, JJ., joined, post, p. 20.

John B. Draper, Special Assistant Attorney General ofKansas, argued the cause for plaintiff. With him on the

briefs were Carla J. Stovall, Attorney General, John W.Campbell, Chief Deputy Attorney General, John M. Cassidy,
Assistant Attorney General, Leland E. Rolfs, Special Assist-ant Attorney General, and Andrew S. Montgomery.

Jeffrey P. Minear argued the cause for intervenor UnitedStates. With him on the briefs were

Solicitor GeneralWaxman, Assistant Attorney General Schiffer, Deputy Solicitor General Kneedler, and Patricia Weiss.David W. Robbins, Special Assistant Attorney General of
Colorado, argued the cause for defendant. With him on thebriefs were Ken Salazar, Attorney General, Carol D. Angel,
Senior Assistant Attorney General, and Dennis M. Mont-gomery, Special Assistant Attorney General.

Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court.
The Arkansas River rises in the mountains of Coloradojust east of the Continental Divide, descends for about 280

miles to the Kansas border, then flows through that State,Oklahoma, and Arkansas and empties into the Mississippi
River. On May 20, 1901, Kansas first invoked this Court'soriginal jurisdiction to seek a remedy for Colorado's diversion of water from the Arkansas River. See Kansasv.

Colorado, 185 U. S. 125, 126 (1902) (statement of case).In opinions written during the past century, most recently

in Kansas v. Colorado, 514 U. S. 673, 675-678 (1995), we havedescribed the history and the importance of the river. For
present purposes it suffices to note that two of those cases,Kansas v. Colorado, 206 U. S. 46 (1907), and Colorado v.
Kansas, 320 U. S. 383 (1943), led to the negotiation of theArkansas River Compact (Compact), an agreement between
Kansas and Colorado that in turn was approved by Congressin 1949. See 63 Stat. 145. The case before us today in533US1 Unit: $U68 [10-21-02 15:08:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
volves a claim by Kansas for damages based on Colorado'sviolations of that Compact.

The Compact was designed to "[s]ettle existing disputesand remove causes of future controversy" between the two
States and their citizens concerning waters of the Arkan-sas River and to "[e]quitably divide and apportion" those
waters and the benefits arising from construction and operation of the federal project known as the "John Martin Reser-voir." Arkansas River Compact, Art. I, reprinted in App.

to Brief for Kansas A-1, A-2. Article IV-D of the Com-pact provides:

"This Compact is not intended to impede or prevent
future beneficial development of the Arkansas River
basin in Colorado and Kansas by Federal or State agen-cies, by private enterprise, or by combinations thereof,

which may involve construction of dams, reservoir, andother works for the purpose of water utilization and control, as well as the improved or prolonged functioningof existing works: Provided, that the waters of the
Arkansas River, as defined in Article III, shall not bematerially depleted in usable quantity or availability for
use to the water users in Colorado and Kansas underthis Compact by such future development or construction." Id., at A-5.
It is the proviso to that paragraph that is of special relevance to this case.In 1986, we granted Kansas leave to file a complaint alleging three violations of the Compact by Colorado. See514 U. S., at 679-680. After taking evidence in the liability
phase of the proceeding, Special Master Arthur L. Littleworth filed his first report, in which he recommended
that two of the claims be denied, but that the Court find
that post-Compact increases in groundwater well pumping
in Colorado had materially depleted the waters of the river
in violation of Article IV-D. See id., at 680. We overruled

6 KANSAS v. COLORADO

Opinion of the Court
Colorado's exceptions to that recommendation, including an
argument that Kansas was guilty of laches. Id., at 687-689.
We remanded the case to the Special Master to determine
an appropriate remedy for the violations of Article IV-D.
Id., at 694.

After further proceedings the Special Master filed a second report recommending an award of damages. Colorado
filed exceptions to that report, arguing that the Eleventh Amendment barred an award based on losses incurred
by Kansas citizens, and that the report improperly recommended the recovery of prejudgment interest on an unliquidated claim. We overruled those exceptions without
prejudice to their renewal after the Special Master made
a more specific recommendation for a remedy. 522 U. S.
1073 (1998). He did so in his third report, and we are now
confronted with exceptions filed by both States.

In the third report, the Special Master recommends that
damages be measured by Kansas' losses, rather than Colorado's profits, attributable to Compact violations after 1950;
that the damages be paid in money rather than water; and
that the damages should include prejudgment interest from
1969 to the date of judgment. Colorado has filed four objections to the report. It contends (1) that the recommended
award of damages would violate the Eleventh Amendment
to the United States Constitution; (2) that the damages
award should not include prejudgment interest; (3) that
the amount of interest awarded is excessive; and (4) that the
Special Master improperly credited flawed expert testimony,
with the result that Kansas' crop production losses were
improperly calculated. On the other hand, Kansas has filed
an objection submitting that prejudgment interest should
be paid from 1950, rather than 1969. The United States,
which intervened because of its interest in the operation
of flood control projects in Colorado, submits that both
States' objections should be overruled.

Opinion of the Court

I
We have decided that a State may recover monetarydamages from another State in an original action, without

running afoul of the Eleventh Amendment.1 See, e. g.,
Texas v. New Mexico, 482 U. S. 124, 130 (1987) ("The Courthas recognized the propriety of money judgments against

a State in an original action, and specifically in a case in-volving a compact. In proper original actions, the Eleventh Amendment is no barrier, for by its terms, it appliesonly to suits by citizens against a State" (citations omitted));
see also Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U. S. 725, 745, n. 21(1981);

South Dakota v. North Carolina, 192 U. S. 286, 317-321 (1904). Colorado contends, however, that the Eleventh

Amendment precludes any such recovery based on lossessustained by individual water users in Kansas.

It is firmly established, and undisputed in this litigation,that the text of the Eleventh Amendment would bar a direct action against Colorado by citizens of Kansas. More-over, we have several times held that a State may not invoke our original jurisdiction when it is merely acting asan agent or trustee for one or more of its citizens. For example, in New Hampshire v. Louisiana, 108 U. S. 76 (1883),we refused to assume jurisdiction over an action to recover
payment on defaulted bonds that had been formally assignedto the state plaintiffs but remained beneficially owned by
private individuals. And, in North Dakota v. Minnesota,263 U. S. 365 (1923), we held that, while the plaintiff State
could obtain an injunction against the improper operationof Minnesota's drainage ditches, the Eleventh Amendment
precluded an award of damages based on injuries to indi-vidual farmers, where the damages claim was financed by

1 That Amendment provides: "The Judicial power of the United States

Opinion of the Court
contributions from the farmers and the State had committedto dividing any recovery among the farmers "in proportion

to the amount of [their] loss." Id., at 375.Those cases make it clear that a "State is not permitted to
enter a controversy as a nominal party in order to forwardthe claims of individual citizens."

Maryland v. Louisiana,
451 U. S., at 737; see also New Hampshire v. Louisiana, 108
U. S., at 89 (Eleventh Amendment applies and acts to barjurisdiction where "the State and the attorney-general are

only nominal actors in the proceeding"). The "governingprinciple" is that in order to invoke our original jurisdiction,
"the State must show a direct interest of its own and not
merely seek recovery for the benefit of individuals who are
the real parties in interest." Oklahoma ex rel. Johnson v.
Cook, 304 U. S. 387, 396 (1938).

Kansas has unquestionably made such a showing. Indeed,
the present proceeding is but one of several in which Kansas'
own interest in preventing upstream diversions from the
Arkansas River has justified an exercise of our original jurisdiction. In Cook we even offered as an example of proper
original jurisdiction one of the prior original suits between
Kansas and Colorado, see id., at 393-394 (citing Kansas v.
Colorado, 206 U. S. 46 (1907)), and in Texas v. New Mexico
we held that enforcement of an interstate water compact
by means of a recovery of money damages can be within a
State's proper pursuit of the "general public interest" in an
original action, 482 U. S., at 132, n. 7.

Moreover, the record in this case plainly discloses that
the State of Kansas has been in full control of this litigation
since its inception. Its right to control the disposition of any
recovery of damages is entirely unencumbered. The injury
to individual farmers is but one component of the formula
adopted by the Special Master to quantify the damages
caused by Colorado's violation of its contractual obligations.
In short, there is simply nothing in the record to suggest
that the State of Kansas is merely a "nominal party" to this

Opinion of the Court
litigation or that the individual farmers are "the real partiesin interest."

When a State properly invokes our jurisdiction to seekredress for a wrong perpetrated against it by a sister State,
neither the measure of damages that we ultimately de-termine to be proper nor our method for calculating those
damages can retrospectively negate our jurisdiction. Norwould our jurisdiction to order a damages remedy be affected by Kansas' postjudgment decisions concerning theuse of the money recovered from Colorado. As we have
previously recognized, it is the State's prerogative eitherto deposit the proceeds of any judgment in "the general
coffers of the State" or to use them to "benefit those whowere hurt."

Ibid.We overrule Colorado's first exception.

II
Colorado next excepts to the Special Master's conclusionthat the damages award should include prejudgment interest

despite the fact that Kansas' claim is unliquidated.2 At onepoint in time, the fact that the claim was unliquidated would
have been of substantial importance. As a general matter,early common-law cases drew a distinction between liquidated and unliquidated claims and refused to allow intereston the latter. See,

e. g., Comment, Prejudgment Interest:

2 Though final damages have not yet been calculated, the importance
of this issue is illustrated by breaking down the damages claimed by
Kansas. Of $62,369,173 in damages so claimed, $9,218,305 represents
direct and indirect losses in actual dollars when the damage occurred.
Of the remaining $53,150,868, about $12 million constitutes an adjustment
for inflation (a type of interest that Colorado concedes is appropriate)
while the remaining amount (approximately $41 million) represents
additional interest intended to compensate for lost investment opportunities. Third Report of Special Master 87-88 (hereinafter Third Report).
The magnitude of prejudgment interest ultimately awarded in this case
will, of course, turn on the date from which interest accrues. See Part
III-B, infra.

Opinion of the Court
Survey and Suggestion, 77 Nw. U. L. Rev. 192, 196, and n. 26(1982) (discussing history and collecting sources). This rule

seems to have rested upon a belief that there was somethinginherently unfair about requiring debtors to pay interest
when they were unable to halt its accrual by handing overto their creditors a fixed and unassailable amount. See, e. g.,
id., at 196.This common-law distinction has long since lost its hold
on the legal imagination. Beginning in the early part of thelast century, numerous courts and commentators have rejected the distinction for failing to acknowledge the compen-satory nature of interest awards.

3 This Court allied itself

with the evolving consensus in 1933, when we expressed theopinion that the distinction between cases of liquidated and

unliquidated damages "is not a sound one." Funkhouser v.
J. B. Preston Co., 290 U. S. 163, 168 (1933). The analysissupporting that conclusion gave no doubt as to our reasoning:

"Whether the case is of the one class or the other, the in-jured party has suffered a loss which may be regarded as
not fully compensated if he is confined to the amount foundto be recoverable as of the time of breach and nothing is
added for the delay in obtaining the award of damages."
Ibid. Our cases since 1933 have consistently acknowledgedthat a monetary award does not fully compensate for an

injury unless it includes an interest component. See, e. g.,Milwaukee v. Cement Div., National Gypsum Co., 515 U. S.

Relying on our cases, the Special Master "concluded thatthe unliquidated nature of Kansas' money damages does
not, in and of itself, bar an award of prejudgment interest."Second Report, $ XV, reprinted in App. to Third Report 43.
In reaching that conclusion, the Special Master was fullycognizant of both the displaced common-law rule and the
subsequent doctrinal evolution. In addition, he gave care-ful consideration to equitable considerations that might
mitigate against an award of interest, concluding that "con-siderations of fairness,"

Board of Comm'rs of Jackson Cty.v. United States, 308 U. S. 343, 352 (1939), supported the

award of at least some prejudgment interest in this case.We find no fault in the Special Master's analysis of either
our prior cases or the equities of this matter. While wewill deal with the amount of prejudgment interest below,
to answer Colorado's second objection it is sufficient to con-clude that the Special Master was correct in determining
that the unliquidated nature of the damages does not pre-clude an award of prejudgment interest.

4 Justice O'Connor argues that the state of the law was insufficiently
evolved by 1949 for Colorado to have had notice that the courts might
award prejudgment interest if it violated its obligations under the Compact. See post, at 21-25 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in
part). Though the law was indeed in flux at that time, this Court had
already made it clear that it put no stock in the traditional common-law
prohibition, see Funkhouser v. J. B. Preston Co., 290 U. S. 163, 168 (1933),
and had stated explicitly that such interest may accrue when "considerations of fairness" demand it, see Board of Comm'rs of Jackson Cty. v.
United States, 308 U. S. 343, 352 (1939). The contemporary Restatement
of Contracts was in accord. See Restatement of Contracts $ 337(b), at 542

12 KANSAS v. COLORADO

Opinion of the Court
Colorado's second exception is overruled.

III
Colorado's third exception takes issue with both the
rate of interest adopted by the Special Master and the date
from which he recommended that interest begin to accrue.
As to the second of these two concerns, Colorado submits
that, if any prejudgment interest is to be awarded, it should
begin to accrue in 1985 (when Kansas filed its complaint in
this action), rather than in 1969 (when, the Special Master
concluded, Colorado knew or should have known that it
was violating the Compact). On the other hand, Kansas has
entered an exception, arguing that the accrual of interest
should begin in 1950. We first address the rate question,
then the timing issue.

A

The Special Master credited the testimony of Kansas'
three experts who calculated the interest rates that they
thought necessary to provide full compensation for the damages caused by Colorado's violations of the Compact in the
years since 1950. As a result of inflation and changing market conditions those rates varied from year to year. In their
calculation of the damages suffered by Kansas farmers, the
experts used the interest rates that were applicable to individuals in the relevant years rather than the (lower) rates
available to States.

due"). Under those circumstances, we think it is clear that, in 1949, an
informed contracting party would not have concluded that an agreement's
silence on the issue deprived a reviewing court of the authority to award
compensatory interest if the party willfully violated its contractual obligations. Moreover, under Justice O'Connor's reasoning, States who entered into interstate compacts before 1987, see post, at 23, would retain
a perpetual incentive to breach their contractual obligations and reap
the benefits of such a breach with the full knowledge that the courts lack
the authority to order a fully compensatory remedy.

13Cite as: 533 U. S. 1 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
Colorado argues that the lower rates should have beenused because it is the State, rather than the individual farmers, that is maintaining the action and will receive any awardof damages. But if, as we have already decided, see Part I,
supra, it is permissible for the State to measure a portionof its damages by losses suffered by individual farmers, it
necessarily follows that the courts are free to utilize what-ever interest rate will most accurately measure those losses.
The money in question in this portion of the damages awardis revenue that would--but for Colorado's actions--have
been earned by individual farmers. Thus, the Special Mas-ter correctly concluded that the economic consequences of
Colorado's breach could best be remedied by an interestaward that mirrors the cost of any additional borrowing
the farmers may have been forced to undertake in orderto compensate for lost revenue.

B
Although the Special Master rejected Colorado's sub-mission that there is a categorical bar to the award of prejudgment interest on unliquidated claims, he concluded thatsuch interest should not "be awarded according to [any] rigid
theory of compensation for money withheld," but rathershould respond to " `considerations of fairness.' " Third Report 97 (quoting Jackson Cty., 308 U. S., at 352). Kansasargues that our decisions subsequent to Jackson County
have effectively foreclosed the equities-balancing approachthat the Special Master adopted. There is some merit to
Kansas' position. See National Gypsum Co., 515 U. S., at193 (affirming a decision of the Court of Appeals that had
read our cases as "disapproving of a `balancing of the equi-ties' as a method of deciding whether to allow prejudgment
interest").However, despite the clear direction indicated by some
of our earlier opinions, we cannot say that by 1949 our caselaw had developed sufficiently to put Colorado on notice

14 KANSAS v. COLORADO

Opinion of the Court
that, upon a violation of the Compact, we would auto-matically award prejudgment interest from the time of injury. Given the state of the law at that time, Colorado maywell have believed that we would balance the equities in
order to achieve a just and equitable remedy, rather thanautomatically imposing prejudgment interest in order to
achieve full compensation. See Jackson Cty., 308 U. S., at
352 (prejudgment interest award limited by "considerationsof fairness");

Miller v. Robertson, 266 U. S. 243, 258 (1924)
("[W]hen necessary in order to arrive at fair compensation,the court in the exercise of a sound discretion may include

interest or its equivalent as an element of damages" on un-liquidated claims); Restatement of Contracts $ 337, p. 542
(1932) (prejudgment interest on unliquidated claims "maybe allowed in the discretion of the court, if justice requires it"). While we are confident that, when it signedthe Compact, Colorado was on notice that it might be subject to prejudgment interest if such interest was neces-sary to fashion an equitable remedy, we are unable to conclude with sufficient certainty that Colorado was on notice
that such interest would be imposed as a matter of course.We, therefore, believe that the Special Master acted properly in carefully analyzing the facts of the case and in only
awarding as much prejudgment interest as was required by
a balancing of the equities.

We also agree with the Special Master that the equities in
this case do not support an award of prejudgment interest
from the date of the first violation of the Compact, but rather
favor an award beginning on a later date. In reaching this
conclusion, the Special Master appropriately considered several factors. In particular, he relied on the fact that in the
early years after the Compact was signed, no one had any
thought that the pact was being violated. Third Report 106.
In addition, he considered the long interval that passed between the original injuries and these proceedings, as well
as the dramatic impact of compounding interest over many
years. Id., at 99-101; see also n. 3, supra.

15Cite as: 533 U. S. 1 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
In its exception, Kansas argues that the Special Master's
reasoning would be appropriate if damages were being
awarded as a form of punishment, but does not justify a
refusal to provide full compensation to an injured party.
Moreover, Kansas argues, a rule that rewards ignorance
might discourage diligence in making sure that there is full
compliance with the terms of the Compact. Kansas' argument is consistent with a "rigid theory of compensation for
money withheld," but, for the reasons discussed above, we
are persuaded that the Special Master correctly declined to
adopt such a theory. The equitable considerations identified by the Special Master fully justify his view that in this
case it would be inappropriate to award prejudgment interest for any years before either party was aware of the
excessive pumping in Colorado.

In its third exception, Colorado argues that, if prejudgment interest is to be awarded at all, the equities are best
balanced by limiting such interest to the time after the complaint was filed, rather than the time after which Colorado
knew or should have known that it was violating the Compact. Specifically, Colorado suggests that prejudgment interest should begin to accrue in 1985 rather than 1969. The
choice between the two dates is surely debatable; it is a
matter over which reasonable people can--and do--disagree.
After examining the equities for ourselves, however, a majority of the Court has decided that the later date is the
more appropriate.5

5 Justice O'Connor, Justice Scalia, and Justice Thomas would
not allow any prejudgment interest. See post, at 20. Justice Kennedy
and The Chief Justice are of the opinion that prejudgment interest
should run from the date of the filing of the complaint. Justice Souter,
Justice Ginsburg, Justice Breyer, and the author of this opinion
agree with the Special Master's view that interest should run from the
time when Colorado knew or should have known that it was violating
the Compact. In order to produce a majority for a judgment, the four
Justices who agree with the Special Master have voted to endorse the
position expressed in the text.

16 KANSAS v. COLORADO

Opinion of the Court
When we overruled Colorado's objections to the SpecialMaster's first report, we held that Kansas was not guilty

of inexcusable delay in failing to complain more promptlyabout post-Compact well pumping. 514 U. S., at 687-689.
In saying that the delay was not inexcusable, we recog-nized that the nature and extent of Colorado's violations
continued to be unclear even in the years after which itbecame obvious that the Compact was being violated.

Id.,at 688-689. That conclusion is something of a two-edged

sword, however. While Kansas' delay was understandablegiven the amorphous nature of its claims, there is no doubt
that the interests of both States would have been servedif the claim had been advanced promptly after its basis
became known. Once it became obvious that a violationof the Compact had occurred, it was equally clear that the
proceedings necessary to evaluate the significance of the vio-lations would be complex and protracted. Despite the diligence of the parties and the Special Master, over 15 yearshave elapsed since the complaint was filed. Given the uncertainty over the scope of damages that prevailed duringthe period between 1968 and 1985 and the fact that it was
uniquely in Kansas' power to begin the process by whichthose damages would be quantified, Colorado's request that
we deny prejudgment interest for that period is reasonable.For these reasons, we overrule Kansas' exception. We
also overrule Colorado's third exception insofar as it chal-lenges the interest rates recommended by the Special Master, but we sustain that objection insofar as it challengesthe award of interest for the years prior to 1985.

IV
Colorado's final objection challenges the Special Master'sdetermination of the value of the crop losses attributable

to the Compact violations, the largest component of Kansas'damages claim. The Special Master accomplished the calculation by estimating the amount of farmland affected by

Opinion of the Court
Colorado's violations, the crops planted on that farmland,the price of those crops, and the difference in yield between

what the affected land would have produced with the addi-tional water and what the land actually produced with the
water it received.The parties were in agreement concerning most of the
facts bearing on the Special Master's calculation. Theyagreed that water was in short supply in the affected area
each year, 178 Tr. 127-128; they agreed on the amount of theshortage that resulted from Colorado's violations,

ibid.; andthey generally agreed on which crops were planted on the

affected farmland as well as the prices of those crops in therelevant years. See Third Report 46.

The only issue on which the parties disagreed was theexact effect of the diverted water on the crop yields for
the farmland in question. On that score, both Kansas andColorado accepted the general notion that "[u]p to the
point where crops no longer can make use of additionalwater, more water produces more crop yield."

Id., at 47.But they parted ways on the question of precisely how much

additional yield would have been produced with the miss-ing water.

6 Kansas' experts relied upon the hypothesis of

a generally linear relationship between water available for

6 As the Special Master noted, "Colorado experts did not dispute, in
general, the linear relationship between [water usage] and crop yield. . . .
However, they were of the view that the particular linear crop yield coefficients used by Kansas were not sufficiently reliable to determine the
increase in yields that would have occurred if there had been no depletions
of headgate deliveries to the [affected] lands." Third Report 47. Colorado suggests that Kansas' model, based as it is upon academic studies,
does not adequately account for reductions in crop yield from such realworld conditions as "weather, disease, and pests." Brief for Colorado 44,
n. 12. But, as the Special Master correctly noted, Kansas' experts reduced the predicted crop yield by 25% in order to account for such possibilities. Third Report 51 ("The 25% reduction was calculated to adjust
the controlled experimental data to `realistic long-term type conditions'
in western Kansas, including high temperatures, winds, insects, and other
stressful conditions").

use and increased crop yields. With figures drawn from anumber of studies, Professor Norman Whittlesey, Kansas'

principal expert,7 developed quantitative estimates of thelost yield, per unit of water, for the various crops grown on
the affected farmland. Although Colorado's expert initiallyattempted to propose his own model, he ultimately abandoned his position when confronted with flaws in his data.197 Tr. 44-46.

Its own expert having recanted his alternative proposalfor calculating the effects of the diverted water on crop
yield, Colorado attempts to poke holes in Kansas' method-ology through a speculative application of abstract economic
theory. Kansas' numbers (for crop losses due to divertedwater) cannot be correct, Colorado argues, because if they
were, it would have been economically profitable for theaffected farmers to drill wells and obtain water from underground sources rather than suffer the reduced yield fromthe shortage of surface water. Brief for Colorado 41-49.
Because Kansas farmers did not install wells, Coloradoconcludes, we can know that the diverted water was not
as valuable as Kansas' experts claim.The Special Master did not question Colorado's assertion
that digging wells would, in retrospect, actually have beenprofitable for Kansas farmers, but he declined to employ
Colorado's argument as a basis for rejecting Kansas' ex-pert testimony on the extent of crop losses. His thoughtful
analysis is worth quoting in full:

"Given the hindsight of present day economists, itmight have been profitable for everyone to drill supplemental wells . . . . However, there are many reasonswhy this may not have been done, and the failure to
drill wells does not by itself indicate that Kansas'

We agree with the Special Master that accepting Colo-rado's argument requires a good deal of speculation, not

only about the comparative advantages of wells as opposedto irrigation, but also about the ability of the farmers fully
to understand or to implement different choices withoutthe benefit of expert hindsight. Given Colorado's inability
to mount an effective challenge to Kansas' experts on theirown terms and its complete failure to provide a plausible
alternative estimate of the crop damage that resulted fromits violations of the Compact, we conclude that its attack
on Kansas' conclusions is unpersuasive.8

8 We also agree with the Special Master's decision to disregard the
Colorado expert's comparison of the numbers produced by Kansas' model
with numbers drawn from the literature on the various crops planted on
the affected farmland. As Colorado admits, see Brief for Colorado 46,
the water values in the literature were not based on "a `short-short run'

were involved, and only additional harvesting and irrigation costs would

We remand the case to the Special Master for preparationof a final judgment consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.
Justice O'Connor, with whom Justice Scalia and
Justice Thomas join, concurring in part and dissentingin part.

I agree with the Court's disposition of this case as to Colo-rado's first and fourth exceptions to the Special Master's
Third Report, concerning the award and determination ofdamages. I therefore join Parts I, IV, and V of the Court's
opinion. I do not concur in Parts II and III of the Court'sopinion because I believe that the award of prejudgment
interest to Kansas, coming over half a century after the Ar-kansas River Compact's (hereinafter Compact) negotiation
and approval, is clearly improper under our precedents.We are dealing with an interstate compact apportioning
the flow of a river between two States. A compact is a con-tract. It represents a bargained-for exchange between its
signatories and "remains a legal document that must beconstrued and applied in accordance with its terms."

involved short-short run situations, and because such short-short run

of Richmond, 262 U. S. 649, 660 (1923); see generally 11 Wil-liston on Contracts $ 30:19 (4th ed. 1999). The basic question

before the Court is thus one of "the fair intendment of thecontract itself."

Virginia v. West Virginia, 238 U. S. 202,
233 (1915). Specifically, the question is whether, at the time
the Compact was negotiated and approved, Colorado andKansas could fairly be said to have intended, or at least to

have expected or assumed, that Colorado might be exposingitself to liability for prejudgment interest in the event of
the Compact's breach. Cf. id., at 232-236 (awarding interest
to Virginia in a suit against West Virginia for breach of a
contract to assume "an equitable proportion" of Virginia's
interest-bearing public debt upon finding that "there is no
escape from the conclusion that there was a contract duty
on the part of West Virginia to provide for accruing interest
as a part of the equitable proportion assumed").

I fail to see how Colorado and Kansas could have contemplated that prejudgment interest would be awarded.
The "venerable . . . rule" at common law was that prejudgment interest was unavailable on claims for unliquidated or,
even more significantly, unascertainable damages. Milwaukee v. Cement Div., National Gypsum Co., 515 U. S. 189, 197
(1995). Contrary to the Court's suggestion, see ante, at
9-11, 13-14, that rule had not been abandoned by the period
between 1943 and 1949, the years of the Compact's negotiation and ultimate approval by Congress. By that time, the
state of the law in general regarding awards of prejudgment
interest for unliquidated claims was uncertain at best, as the
Court itself recognizes. See ante, at 9-11, and n. 3; cf. ante,

then, along with other courts, criticized the common law rulethat prejudgment interest was recoverable on claims for liquidated, but not for unliquidated, damages. See ibid. Butin the absence of a statute providing for such interest, many
courts, including our own, still denied and would continueto deny prejudgment interest on claims for unliquidated
and unascertainable damages in a great many, and probably
most, circumstances. See, e. g., Board of Comm'rs of Jackson Cty. v. United States, 308 U. S. 343, 353 (1939); Blau v.
Lehman, 368 U. S. 403, 414 (1962); Lineman v. Schmid, 32Cal. 2d 204, 211, 195 P. 2d 408, 412 (1948) (Although "there is

authority to the effect that the distinction formerly existing
between liquidated and unliquidated demands is practically
obliterated, . . . further reading . . . discloses, with citation
of many cases, that the general rule is almost uniformly
adhered to, namely, that interest is not allowable where
the damages depend upon no fixed standard and cannot be
made certain except by accord, verdict or decree"); D. Dobbs,
Remedies $ 3.5, p. 165 (1973) ("Most courts, in the absence
of a statute to the contrary, would not award interest on
unliquidated pecuniary claims, the amount of which could not
be ascertained or computed, even in theory, without a trial");
see generally C. McCormick, Law of Damages $ 51, p. 210
(1935) (explaining evolution of rule in America); see also 1
D. Dobbs, Law of Remedies $ 3.6(1), p. 336 (2d ed. 1993) ("The
most significant limitation on the recovery of prejudgment
interest is the general rule that, apart from statute, prejudgment interest is not recoverable on claims that are
neither liquidated as a dollar sum nor ascertainable by fixed
standards" (footnotes omitted)).

Awards of such interest on claims for unliquidated and
unascertainable damages for breach of a contract appear to
have been rarer still. See, e. g., Williams v. Idaho Potato
Starch Co., 73 Idaho 13, 24, 245 P. 2d 1045, 1051-1052 (1952);
Meyer v. Strom, 37 Wash. 2d 818, 829-830, 226 P. 2d 218, 224

410-413; see also 3 Williston on Contracts $ 1413, p. 2508(1920) ("Interest is not generally allowed . . . where market

rates or prices furnish no definite or exact test of the amountdue" (footnote omitted)); 1 T. Sedgwick, Measure of Damages

$ 312, p. 614 (9th ed. 1912) ("Generally speaking, no interestcan be recovered for breach of a contract, where the damages
are in their nature unliquidated, until the amount is ascertained" (footnote omitted)). In fact, at the time, they werenot allowed in either Colorado or Kansas. See,

e. g., Clark
v. Giacomini, 85 Colo. 530, 536-537, 277 P. 306, 308 (1929);
Denver Horse Imp. Co. v. Schafer, 58 Colo. 376, 390, 147

114 P. 374, 378 (1911).

Finally, and most important to this case, an award of
prejudgment interest on unliquidated and unascertainable
damages for breach of an interstate compact was unheard
of at the time of the Compact's negotiation and approval.
Unlike cases involving bonds or other instruments of credit,
see, e. g., Virginia v. West Virginia, supra, at 232-236; South
Dakota v. North Carolina, 192 U. S. 286, 317-321 (1904),
monetary damages in cases of this sort, involving the apportionment of water between States, are notoriously difficult
to ascertain. Indeed, despite 15 years of litigation over the
Compact, and resort to a great deal of data, expert testimony, complicated methodologies, and sophisticated analyses
on the subject, the final value of Kansas' damages still has
yet to be determined. See ante, at 9, n. 2; see also Third
Report $$ III to X (detailing and analyzing the numerous
variables and data elements necessary to arrive at a determination of Kansas' damages). It thus is not surprising that,
until 1987, we had never even suggested that monetary damages could be recovered from a State as a remedy for its
violation of an interstate compact apportioning the flow
of an interstate stream. And when we first allowed such
damages in Texas v. New Mexico, 482 U. S. 124 (1987), we

24 KANSAS v. COLORADO

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
did so partially at the behest of New Mexico, the breachingState. See

id., at 129-132. How, then, can one say that,
at the time the Compact was negotiated and approved, itssignatories could fairly be said to have intended, or at

least could reasonably be said to have expected or assumed,that Kansas might recover prejudgment interest on damages caused by Colorado's breach? The necessary predicate
to such a recovery was neither recognized nor even contem-plated by this Court or, apparently, by the state parties to

original actions of this sort, until some 40 years thence.In light of this history, it seems inescapable that any
participant in the drafting and negotiation of the Compact
would, if asked at the time, have reacted with marked surprise to the notion that the Compact rendered its signatories
liable for an award of prejudgment interest such as that
sanctioned by the Court today. As both the Compact itself
and the parties' post-Compact course of dealing make clear,
the "fair intendment" of the Compact very probably was
simply for the in-kind recovery of water as a remedy for
its breach. The Compact says nothing about the availability
of prejudgment interest on money damages as part of any
remedy or, for that matter, about the availability of money
damages as a remedy in the first instance. It contemplates
the delivery of water from Colorado to Kansas, pure and
simple. See Arkansas River Compact, reprinted in App.
to Brief for Kansas A-1. When Kansas filed its complaint
in this matter, "it sought only a decree commanding Colorado `to deliver the waters of the Arkansas River in accordance with the provisions of the Arkansas River Compact.' "
Third Report $ XI, at 98. Cf. Colorado v. Kansas, 320 U. S.
383, 391 (1943) (discussing Kansas' prayer for relief in the
form of "an apportionment in second feet or acre feet"). Not
until our decision in Texas v. New Mexico, supra, did Kansas
amend its complaint to include a claim for monetary damages. See Third Report $ XI, at 98. Neither Kansas nor
Colorado appears ever to have anticipated or assumed, much

25Cite as: 533 U. S. 1 (2001)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
less expected, that the Compact might result in a monetaryaward of prejudgment interest over half a century after

its signing.The Court ignores all of this in awarding prejudgment
interest to Kansas, seizing instead upon the compensatoryrationale behind the criticism of the common law rule and
awards of prejudgment interest on unliquidated claims for
damages in general. See ante, at 10-11. I do not disputethat awards of interest are compensatory in nature or that,

as a general matter, "a monetary award does not fully com-pensate for an injury unless it includes an interest component." Ante, at 10; see also National Gypsum Co., 515
U. S., at 195, n. 7. But, as the Court itself recognizes, see
ante, at 11, our precedents make clear that, at least today
and in the absence of a governing statute, awards of prejudgment interest on unliquidated claims for damages are governed not by any "rigid theory of compensation for money
withheld," but rather by "considerations of fairness." Blau,
368 U. S., at 414 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see, e. g., General Motors Corp. v. Devex Corp., 461 U. S.
648, 651-653, and n. 5 (1983); Funkhouser, 290 U. S., at 168-
169. This is especially so where, as here, we are dealing
with suits by one governmental body against another. See
West Virginia v. United States, 479 U. S. 305, 309-312 (1987);
Board of Comm'rs of Jackson Cty., 308 U. S., at 349-353.

There is nothing fair about awarding prejudgment interest
as a remedy for the Compact's breach when all available evidence suggests that the signatories to the Compact neither
intended nor contemplated such an unconventional remedy.
Many compacts between States are old; suits involving compacts concerning water rights are late in starting and are
invariably long pending; and, because statutes of limitation
or the doctrine of laches is rarely available to preclude the
steady buildup of prejudgment interest, the amount of such
interest can become quite large, as Kansas' claim for approximately $41 million illustrates. See ante, at 9, n. 2. One

533US1 Unit: $U68 [10-21-02 15:08:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN
26 KANSAS v. COLORADO

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
would think that, particularly in such circumstances, eventhe most rudimentary conception of fairness would dictate

that the Court ought not to interpret a contract betweentwo States as exposing one of them to liability under a novel
legal principle some 50 years later without some indicationthat the States might have contemplated such exposure in
conjunction with the contractual rights and duties expressedin their compact. Contrary to the Court's apparent belief,
see ante, at 11-12, n. 4, nothing about such a contextualizedhistorical approach would create an across-the-board incentive for the continued breach of interstate compacts enteredinto before 1987, especially given the prospect of large and
uncertain damages awards. Had Kansas and Colorado an-ticipated or even suspected what the Court today effects,
they almost certainly would have negotiated a provision inthe Compact to address the situation. States in the future
very likely will do so in the wake of the Court's decision,which creates a very different backdrop from the one against
which Kansas and Colorado operated. In the absence ofsuch a provision, however, "the loss [as to interest] should
remain where it has fallen." Board of Comm'rs of JacksonCty., supra, at 353; see Third Report $ XI, at 101 ("Prejudgment interest here neither takes from those who benefitted,nor goes to those who were injured").

For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent from theCourt's award of prejudgment interest.

KYLLO v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 99-8508. Argued February 20, 2001--Decided June 11, 2001
Suspicious that marijuana was being grown in petitioner Kyllo's home

in a triplex, agents used a thermal-imaging device to scan the triplex
to determine if the amount of heat emanating from it was consistent with the high-intensity lamps typically used for indoor marijuana
growth. The scan showed that Kyllo's garage roof and a side wall
were relatively hot compared to the rest of his home and substantially warmer than the neighboring units. Based in part on the thermal
imaging, a Federal Magistrate Judge issued a warrant to search Kyllo's
home, where the agents found marijuana growing. After Kyllo was
indicted on a federal drug charge, he unsuccessfully moved to suppress the evidence seized from his home and then entered a conditional guilty plea. The Ninth Circuit ultimately affirmed, upholding
the thermal imaging on the ground that Kyllo had shown no subjective expectation of privacy because he had made no attempt to conceal the heat escaping from his home. Even if he had, ruled the court,
there was no objectively reasonable expectation of privacy because
the thermal imager did not expose any intimate details of Kyllo's life,
only amorphous hot spots on his home's exterior.

Held: Where, as here, the Government uses a device that is not in general

public use, to explore details of a private home that would previously
have been unknowable without physical intrusion, the surveillance
is a Fourth Amendment "search," and is presumptively unreasonable
without a warrant. Pp. 31-41.

(a) The question whether a warrantless search of a home is reasonable and hence constitutional must be answered no in most instances,
but the antecedent question whether a Fourth Amendment "search"
has occurred is not so simple. This Court has approved warrantless
visual surveillance of a home, see California v. Ciraolo, 476 U. S. 207,
213, ruling that visual observation is no "search" at all, see Dow Chemical Co. v. United States, 476 U. S. 227, 234-235, 239. In assessing when
a search is not a search, the Court has adapted a principle first enunciated in Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347, 361: A "search" does
not occur--even when its object is a house explicitly protected by the
Fourth Amendment--unless the individual manifested a subjective

533US1 Unit: $U69 [10-17-02 18:29:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN
28 KYLLO v. UNITED STATES

Syllabus
expectation of privacy in the searched object, and society is willing
to recognize that expectation as reasonable, see, e. g., California v.
Ciraolo, supra, at 211. Pp. 31-33.

(b) While it may be difficult to refine the Katz test in some instances,
in the case of the search of a home's interior--the prototypical and hence
most commonly litigated area of protected privacy--there is a ready
criterion, with roots deep in the common law, of the minimal expectation of privacy that exists, and that is acknowledged to be reasonable.
To withdraw protection of this minimum expectation would be to permit police technology to erode the privacy guaranteed by the Fourth
Amendment. Thus, obtaining by sense-enhancing technology any information regarding the home's interior that could not otherwise have
been obtained without physical "intrusion into a constitutionally protected area," Silverman v. United States, 365 U. S. 505, 512, constitutes a search--at least where (as here) the technology in question is
not in general public use. This assures preservation of that degree
of privacy against government that existed when the Fourth Amendment was adopted. Pp. 33-35.

(c) Based on this criterion, the information obtained by the thermal
imager in this case was the product of a search. The Court rejects the
Government's argument that the thermal imaging must be upheld because it detected only heat radiating from the home's external surface.
Such a mechanical interpretation of the Fourth Amendment was rejected in Katz, where the eavesdropping device in question picked up
only sound waves that reached the exterior of the phone booth to which
it was attached. Reversing that approach would leave the homeowner
at the mercy of advancing technology--including imaging technology
that could discern all human activity in the home. Also rejected is the
Government's contention that the thermal imaging was constitutional
because it did not detect "intimate details." Such an approach would
be wrong in principle because, in the sanctity of the home, all details are intimate details. See, e. g., United States v. Karo, 468 U. S.
705; Dow Chemical, supra, at 238, distinguished. It would also be
impractical in application, failing to provide a workable accommodation between law enforcement needs and Fourth Amendment interests.
See Oliver v. United States, 466 U. S. 170, 181. Pp. 35-40.

(d) Since the imaging in this case was an unlawful search, it will
remain for the District Court to determine whether, without the
evidence it provided, the search warrant was supported by probable
cause--and if not, whether there is any other basis for supporting
admission of that evidence. P. 40.

Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case presents the question whether the use of athermal-imaging device aimed at a private home from a

public street to detect relative amounts of heat withinthe home constitutes a "search" within the meaning of the
Fourth Amendment. I

In 1991 Agent William Elliott of the United States De-partment of the Interior came to suspect that marijuana
was being grown in the home belonging to petitioner DannyKyllo, part of a triplex on Rhododendron Drive in Florence,
Oregon. Indoor marijuana growth typically requires high-intensity lamps. In order to determine whether an amount
of heat was emanating from petitioner's home consistentwith the use of such lamps, at 3:20 a.m. on January 16, 1992,
Agent Elliott and Dan Haas used an Agema Thermovision210 thermal imager to scan the triplex. Thermal imagers
detect infrared radiation, which virtually all objects emitbut which is not visible to the naked eye. The imager converts radiation into images based on relative warmth--black

Opinion of the Court
is cool, white is hot, shades of gray connote relative differences; in that respect, it operates somewhat like a video
camera showing heat images. The scan of Kyllo's home took
only a few minutes and was performed from the passenger
seat of Agent Elliott's vehicle across the street from the
front of the house and also from the street in back of the
house. The scan showed that the roof over the garage and
a side wall of petitioner's home were relatively hot compared to the rest of the home and substantially warmer
than neighboring homes in the triplex. Agent Elliott concluded that petitioner was using halide lights to grow marijuana in his house, which indeed he was. Based on tips from
informants, utility bills, and the thermal imaging, a Federal
Magistrate Judge issued a warrant authorizing a search of
petitioner's home, and the agents found an indoor growing
operation involving more than 100 plants. Petitioner was
indicted on one count of manufacturing marijuana, in violation of 21 U. S. C. $ 841(a)(1). He unsuccessfully moved to
suppress the evidence seized from his home and then entered
a conditional guilty plea.

The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit remanded the
case for an evidentiary hearing regarding the intrusiveness
of thermal imaging. On remand the District Court found
that the Agema 210 "is a non-intrusive device which emits
no rays or beams and shows a crude visual image of the
heat being radiated from the outside of the house"; it
"did not show any people or activity within the walls of
the structure"; "[t]he device used cannot penetrate walls
or windows to reveal conversations or human activities";
and "[n]o intimate details of the home were observed."
Supp. App. to Pet. for Cert. 39-40. Based on these findings, the District Court upheld the validity of the warrant
that relied in part upon the thermal imaging, and reaffirmed
its denial of the motion to suppress. A divided Court of
Appeals initially reversed, 140 F. 3d 1249 (1998), but that

Opinion of the Court
opinion was withdrawn and the panel (after a change in com-position) affirmed, 190 F. 3d 1041 (1999), with Judge Noonan

dissenting. The court held that petitioner had shown nosubjective expectation of privacy because he had made
no attempt to conceal the heat escaping from his home, id.,at 1046, and even if he had, there was no objectively reasonable expectation of privacy because the imager "did notexpose any intimate details of Kyllo's life," only "amorphous
`hot spots' on the roof and exterior wall," id., at 1047. Wegranted certiorari. 530 U. S. 1305 (2000).

II
The Fourth Amendment provides that "[t]he right of thepeople to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and

effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shallnot be violated." "At the very core" of the Fourth Amendment "stands the right of a man to retreat into his own homeand there be free from unreasonable governmental intrusion." Silverman v. United States, 365 U. S. 505, 511 (1961).With few exceptions, the question whether a warrantless
search of a home is reasonable and hence constitutional mustbe answered no. See

Illinois v. Rodriguez, 497 U. S. 177,181 (1990); Payton v. New York, 445 U. S. 573, 586 (1980).

On the other hand, the antecedent question whether or nota Fourth Amendment "search" has occurred is not so simple
under our precedent. The permissibility of ordinary visualsurveillance of a home used to be clear because, well into the
20th century, our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence was tiedto common-law trespass. See,

e. g., Goldman v. UnitedStates, 316 U. S. 129, 134-136 (1942); Olmstead v. United

States, 277 U. S. 438, 464-466 (1928). Cf. Silverman v.
United States, supra, at 510-512 (technical trespass not necessary for Fourth Amendment violation; it suffices if thereis "actual intrusion into a constitutionally protected area").

Visual surveillance was unquestionably lawful because " `the

32 KYLLO v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
eye cannot by the laws of England be guilty of a trespass.' "Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 616, 628 (1886) (quoting Entick v. Carrington, 19 How. St. Tr. 1029, 95 Eng. Rep. 807(K. B. 1765)). We have since decoupled violation of a person's Fourth Amendment rights from trespassory violationof his property, see Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U. S. 128, 143
(1978), but the lawfulness of warrantless visual surveillanceof a home has still been preserved. As we observed in

Cali-fornia v. Ciraolo, 476 U. S. 207, 213 (1986), "[t]he Fourth

Amendment protection of the home has never been extendedto require law enforcement officers to shield their eyes when
passing by a home on public thoroughfares."One might think that the new validating rationale would
be that examining the portion of a house that is in plainpublic view, while it is a "search"

1 despite the absence of

trespass, is not an "unreasonable" one under the FourthAmendment. See Minnesota v. Carter, 525 U. S. 83, 104

(1998) (Breyer, J., concurring in judgment). But in factwe have held that visual observation is no "search" at all--
perhaps in order to preserve somewhat more intact our
doctrine that warrantless searches are presumptively un-constitutional. See

Dow Chemical Co. v. United States, 476
U. S. 227, 234-235, 239 (1986). In assessing when a searchis not a search, we have applied somewhat in reverse the

principle first enunciated in Katz v. United States, 389 U. S.347 (1967).

Katz involved eavesdropping by means of an
electronic listening device placed on the outside of a tele-phone booth--a location not within the catalog ("persons,

houses, papers, and effects") that the Fourth Amendmentprotects against unreasonable searches. We held that the

1 When the Fourth Amendment was adopted, as now, to "search" meant
"[t]o look over or through for the purpose of finding something; to explore;
to examine by inspection; as, to search the house for a book; to search the
wood for a thief." N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English
Language 66 (1828) (reprint 6th ed. 1989).

33Cite as: 533 U. S. 27 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
Fourth Amendment nonetheless protected Katz from thewarrantless eavesdropping because he "justifiably relied"

upon the privacy of the telephone booth. Id., at 353.As Justice Harlan's oft-quoted concurrence described it,
a Fourth Amendment search occurs when the governmentviolates a subjective expectation of privacy that society
recognizes as reasonable. See id., at 361. We have sub-sequently applied this principle to hold that a Fourth
Amendment search does not occur--even when the explicitlyprotected location of a

house is concerned--unless "the in-dividual manifested a subjective expectation of privacy in

the object of the challenged search," and "society [is] will-ing to recognize that expectation as reasonable." Ciraolo,
supra, at 211. We have applied this test in holding thatit is not a search for the police to use a pen register at
the phone company to determine what numbers were dialedin a private home, Smith v. Maryland, 442 U. S. 735, 743-
744 (1979), and we have applied the test on two differentoccasions in holding that aerial surveillance of private homes
and surrounding areas does not constitute a search, Ciraolo,
supra; Florida v. Riley, 488 U. S. 445 (1989).The present case involves officers on a public street engaged in more than naked-eye surveillance of a home. Wehave previously reserved judgment as to how much technological enhancement of ordinary perception from such avantage point, if any, is too much. While we upheld enhanced aerial photography of an industrial complex in DowChemical, we noted that we found "it important that
this is not an area immediately adjacent to a private home,where privacy expectations are most heightened," 476 U. S.,
at 237, n. 4 (emphasis in original).

III
It would be foolish to contend that the degree of privacy secured to citizens by the Fourth Amendment has been

533US1 Unit: $U69 [10-17-02 18:29:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN
34 KYLLO v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
entirely unaffected by the advance of technology. For example, as the cases discussed above make clear, the technology enabling human flight has exposed to public view
(and hence, we have said, to official observation) uncovered
portions of the house and its curtilage that once were
private. See Ciraolo, supra, at 215. The question we confront today is what limits there are upon this power of
technology to shrink the realm of guaranteed privacy.

The Katz test--whether the individual has an expectation of privacy that society is prepared to recognize as
reasonable--has often been criticized as circular, and hence
subjective and unpredictable. See 1 W. LaFave, Search
and Seizure $ 2.1(d), pp. 393-394 (3d ed. 1996); Posner, The
Uncertain Protection of Privacy by the Supreme Court, 1979
S. Ct. Rev. 173, 188; Carter, supra, at 97 (Scalia, J., concurring). But see Rakas, supra, at 143-144, n. 12. While
it may be difficult to refine Katz when the search of areas
such as telephone booths, automobiles, or even the curtilage
and uncovered portions of residences is at issue, in the case
of the search of the interior of homes--the prototypical and
hence most commonly litigated area of protected privacy--
there is a ready criterion, with roots deep in the common
law, of the minimal expectation of privacy that exists, and
that is acknowledged to be reasonable. To withdraw protection of this minimum expectation would be to permit
police technology to erode the privacy guaranteed by the
Fourth Amendment. We think that obtaining by senseenhancing technology any information regarding the interior
of the home that could not otherwise have been obtained
without physical "intrusion into a constitutionally protected
area," Silverman, 365 U. S., at 512, constitutes a search--
at least where (as here) the technology in question is not in
general public use. This assures preservation of that degree
of privacy against government that existed when the Fourth
Amendment was adopted. On the basis of this criterion, the

information obtained by the thermal imager in this case wasthe product of a search.

The Government maintains, however, that the thermalimaging must be upheld because it detected "only heat radiating from the external surface of the house," Brief forUnited States 26. The dissent makes this its leading point,
see post, at 41, contending that there is a fundamental dif-ference between what it calls "off-the-wall" observations
and "through-the-wall surveillance." But just as a thermal
imager captures only heat emanating from a house, so alsoa powerful directional microphone picks up only sound emanating from a house--and a satellite capable of scanning frommany miles away would pick up only visible light emanating
from a house. We rejected such a mechanical interpretationof the Fourth Amendment in

Katz, where the eavesdropping
device picked up only sound waves that reached the exteriorof the phone booth. Reversing that approach would leave

the homeowner at the mercy of advancing technology--including imaging technology that could discern all human

2 The dissent's repeated assertion that the thermal imaging did not
obtain information regarding the interior of the home, post, at 43, 44 (opinion of Stevens, J.), is simply inaccurate. A thermal imager reveals the
relative heat of various rooms in the home. The dissent may not find that
information particularly private or important, see post, at 43-44, 45, 49-
50, but there is no basis for saying it is not information regarding the
interior of the home. The dissent's comparison of the thermal imaging

to various circumstances in which outside observers might be able to
perceive, without technology, the heat of the home--for example, by observing snowmelt on the roof, post, at 43--is quite irrelevant. The
fact that equivalent information could sometimes be obtained by other
means does not make lawful the use of means that violate the Fourth
Amendment. The police might, for example, learn how many people are
in a particular house by setting up year-round surveillance; but that
does not make breaking and entering to find out the same information
lawful. In any event, on the night of January 16, 1992, no outside observer could have discerned the relative heat of Kyllo's home without
thermal imaging.

account of more sophisticated systems that are already in useor in development.

3 The dissent's reliance on the distinction

between "off-the-wall" and "through-the-wall" observationis entirely incompatible with the dissent's belief, which

we discuss below, that thermal-imaging observations of
the intimate details of a home are impermissible. The mostsophisticated thermal-imaging devices continue to measure heat "off-the-wall" rather than "through-the-wall"; thedissent's disapproval of those more sophisticated thermalimaging devices, see post, at 49, is an acknowledgment thatthere is no substance to this distinction. As for the dissent's extraordinary assertion that anything learned through"an inference" cannot be a search, see

post, at 44, that would
validate even the "through-the-wall" technologies that thedissent purports to disapprove. Surely the dissent does not

believe that the through-the-wall radar or ultrasound tech-nology produces an 8-by-10 Kodak glossy that needs no analysis (i. e., the making of inferences). And, of course, the
novel proposition that inference insulates a search is bla-tantly contrary to

United States v. Karo, 468 U. S. 705 (1984),
where the police "inferred" from the activation of a beeperthat a certain can of ether was in the home. The police ac3 The ability to "see" through walls and other opaque barriers is a

Through the Wall Surveillance," and a "Radar Flashlight" that "will enable law enforcement officers to detect individuals through interior building walls." www.nlectc.org/techproj/ (visited May 3, 2001). Some devices may emit low levels of radiation that travel "through-the-wall," but
others, such as more sophisticated thermal-imaging devices, are entirely
passive, or "off-the-wall" as the dissent puts it.

The Government also contends that the thermal imaging
was constitutional because it did not "detect private activities occurring in private areas," Brief for United States 22.
It points out that in Dow Chemical we observed that the
enhanced aerial photography did not reveal any "intimate
details." 476 U. S., at 238. Dow Chemical, however, involved enhanced aerial photography of an industrial complex, which does not share the Fourth Amendment sanctity
of the home. The Fourth Amendment's protection of the
home has never been tied to measurement of the quality
or quantity of information obtained. In Silverman, for example, we made clear that any physical invasion of the
structure of the home, "by even a fraction of an inch," was
too much, 365 U. S., at 512, and there is certainly no exception to the warrant requirement for the officer who barely
cracks open the front door and sees nothing but the nonintimate rug on the vestibule floor. In the home, our cases
show, all details are intimate details, because the entire area
is held safe from prying government eyes. Thus, in Karo,
supra, the only thing detected was a can of ether in the

4 The dissent asserts, post, at 44-45, n. 3, that we have misunderstood
its point, which is not that inference insulates a search, but that inference
alone is not a search. If we misunderstood the point, it was only in a
good-faith effort to render the point germane to the case at hand. The
issue in this case is not the police's allegedly unlawful inferencing, but
their allegedly unlawful thermal-imaging measurement of the emanations
from a house. We say such measurement is a search; the dissent says
it is not, because an inference is not a search. We took that to mean
that, since the technologically enhanced emanations had to be the basis
of inferences before anything inside the house could be known, the use of
the emanations could not be a search. But the dissent certainly knows
better than we what it intends. And if it means only that an inference
is not a search, we certainly agree. That has no bearing, however, upon
whether hi-tech measurement of emanations from a house is a search.

officers lawfully present could observe in "plain view" wasthe registration number of a phonograph turntable. These
were intimate details because they were details of the home,just as was the detail of how warm--or even how relatively
warm--Kyllo was heating his residence.5Limiting the prohibition of thermal imaging to "intimate
details" would not only be wrong in principle; it would beimpractical in application, failing to provide "a workable
accommodation between the needs of law enforcement andthe interests protected by the Fourth Amendment,"

Oliverv. United States, 466 U. S. 170, 181 (1984). To begin with,

there is no necessary connection between the sophistica-tion of the surveillance equipment and the "intimacy" of
the details that it observes--which means that one cannotsay (and the police cannot be assured) that use of the relatively crude equipment at issue here will always be lawful.The Agema Thermovision 210 might disclose, for example,
at what hour each night the lady of the house takes herdaily sauna and bath--a detail that many would consider
"intimate"; and a much more sophisticated system mightdetect nothing more intimate than the fact that someone
left a closet light on. We could not, in other words, developa rule approving only that through-the-wall surveillance
which identifies objects no smaller than 36 by 36 inches,but would have to develop a jurisprudence specifying which

if " `modern technology' " revealed " `those intimate associations, objects or activities otherwise imperceptible to police or fellow citizens.' "
Id., at 215, n. 3 (quoting Brief for State of California 14-15). We think
the Court's focus in this secondhand dictum was not upon intimacy but
upon otherwise-imperceptibility, which is precisely the principle we vindicate today.

home activities are "intimate" and which are not. And evenwhen (if ever) that jurisprudence were fully developed, no

police officer would be able to know in advance whether histhrough-the-wall surveillance picks up "intimate" details--
and thus would be unable to know in advance whether itis constitutional.

The dissent's proposed standard--whether the technologyoffers the "functional equivalent of actual presence in the
area being searched," post, at 47--would seem quite similarto our own at first blush. The dissent concludes that

Katzwas such a case, but then inexplicably asserts that if the

same listening device only revealed the volume of the con-versation, the surveillance would be permissible, post, at
49-50. Yet if, without technology, the police could not dis-cern volume without being actually present in the phone
booth, Justice Stevens should conclude a search has oc-curred. Cf. Karo, 468 U. S., at 735 (

Stevens, J., concurringin part and dissenting in part) ("I find little comfort in the

Court's notion that no invasion of privacy occurs until a lis-tener obtains some significant information by use of the device. . . . A bathtub is a less private area when the plumberis present even if his back is turned"). The same should
hold for the interior heat of the home if only a person pres-ent in the home could discern the heat. Thus the driving
force of the dissent, despite its recitation of the abovestandard, appears to be a distinction among different types
of information--whether the "homeowner would even careif anybody noticed," post, at 50. The dissent offers no practical guidance for the application of this standard, and forreasons already discussed, we believe there can be none.
The people in their houses, as well as the police, deservemore precision.

the constitutional analysis by noting that whether or not the technology
is in general public use may be a factor. See post, at 47. That quarrel,

Opinion of the Court
We have said that the Fourth Amendment draws "a firmline at the entrance to the house," Payton, 445 U. S., at 590.

That line, we think, must be not only firm but also bright--which requires clear specification of those methods of surveillance that require a warrant. While it is certainly possi-ble to conclude from the videotape of the thermal imaging
that occurred in this case that no "significant" compromiseof the homeowner's privacy has occurred, we must take the
long view, from the original meaning of the Fourth Amendment forward.

"The Fourth Amendment is to be construed in the lightof what was deemed an unreasonable search and seizure

when it was adopted, and in a manner which will conserve public interests as well as the interests and rightsof individual citizens."

Carroll v. United States, 267
U. S. 132, 149 (1925).

Where, as here, the Government uses a device that is notin general public use, to explore details of the home that

would previously have been unknowable without physical
intrusion, the surveillance is a "search" and is presumptivelyunreasonable without a warrant.

Since we hold the Thermovision imaging to have beenan unlawful search, it will remain for the District Court to
determine whether, without the evidence it provided, thesearch warrant issued in this case was supported by probable
cause--and if not, whether there is any other basis for sup-porting admission of the evidence that the search pursuant
to the warrant produced.
however, is not with us but with this Court's precedent. See Ciraolo,
supra, at 215 ("In an age where private and commercial flight in the public
airways is routine, it is unreasonable for respondent to expect that his
marijuana plants were constitutionally protected from being observed
with the naked eye from an altitude of 1,000 feet"). Given that we can
quite confidently say that thermal imaging is not "routine," we decline in
this case to reexamine that factor.

Justice Stevens, with whom The Chief Justice, Justice O'Connor, and Justice Kennedy join, dissenting.

There is, in my judgment, a distinction of constitutionalmagnitude between "through-the-wall surveillance" that

gives the observer or listener direct access to informationin a private area, on the one hand, and the thought processes
used to draw inferences from information in the public do-main, on the other hand. The Court has crafted a rule that
purports to deal with direct observations of the inside ofthe home, but the case before us merely involves indirect
deductions from "off-the-wall" surveillance, that is, obser-vations of the exterior of the home. Those observations
were made with a fairly primitive thermal imager that gath-ered data exposed on the outside of petitioner's home but did
not invade any constitutionally protected interest in privacy.1Moreover, I believe that the supposedly "bright-line" rule
the Court has created in response to its concerns aboutfuture technological developments is unnecessary, unwise,
and inconsistent with the Fourth Amendment.

home without a warrant are presumptively unreasonable."Payton v. New York, 445 U. S. 573, 586 (1980) (emphasis
added). But it is equally well settled that searches andseizures of property in plain view are presumptively reasonable. See id., at 586-587.2 Whether that property isresidential or commercial, the basic principle is the same:
" `What a person knowingly exposes to the public, even inhis own home or office, is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection.' " California v. Ciraolo, 476 U. S. 207,213 (1986) (quoting

Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347,351 (1967)); see Florida v. Riley, 488 U. S. 445, 449-450

(1986); Air Pollution Variance Bd. of Colo. v. Western Al-falfa Corp., 416 U. S. 861, 865 (1974). That is the principle
implicated here.While the Court "take[s] the long view" and decides this
case based largely on the potential of yet-to-be-developedtechnology that might allow "through-the-wall surveillance,"
ante, at 38-40; see ante, at 36, n. 3, this case involves noth-ing more than off-the-wall surveillance by law enforcement
officers to gather information exposed to the general publicfrom the outside of petitioner's home. All that the infrared
camera did in this case was passively measure heat emitted

from the exterior surfaces of petitioner's home; all thatthose measurements showed were relative differences in

emission levels, vaguely indicating that some areas of theroof and outside walls were warmer than others. As still
images from the infrared scans show, see Appendix, infra,no details regarding the interior of petitioner's home were
revealed. Unlike an x-ray scan, or other possible "throughthe-wall" techniques, the detection of infrared radiationemanating from the home did not accomplish "an unauthorized physical penetration into the premises," Silverman v.
United States, 365 U. S. 505, 509 (1961), nor did it "obtain
information that it could not have obtained by observation
from outside the curtilage of the house," United States v.
Karo, 468 U. S. 705, 715 (1984).

Indeed, the ordinary use of the senses might enable a
neighbor or passerby to notice the heat emanating from
a building, particularly if it is vented, as was the case here.
Additionally, any member of the public might notice that
one part of a house is warmer than another part or a nearby
building if, for example, rainwater evaporates or snow melts
at different rates across its surfaces. Such use of the senses
would not convert into an unreasonable search if, instead,
an adjoining neighbor allowed an officer onto her property
to verify her perceptions with a sensitive thermometer.
Nor, in my view, does such observation become an unreasonable search if made from a distance with the aid of a
device that merely discloses that the exterior of one house,
or one area of the house, is much warmer than another.
Nothing more occurred in this case.

Thus, the notion that heat emissions from the outside
of a dwelling are a private matter implicating the protections
of the Fourth Amendment (the text of which guarantees
the right of people "to be secure in their . . . houses" against
unreasonable searches and seizures (emphasis added)) is not
only unprecedented but also quite difficult to take seriously.

in a laboratory or opium den, enter the public domain if andwhen they leave a building. A subjective expectation that

they would remain private is not only implausible but alsosurely not "one that society is prepared to recognize as `reasonable.' " Katz, 389 U. S., at 361 (Harlan, J., concurring).To be sure, the homeowner has a reasonable expectation
of privacy concerning what takes place within the home,and the Fourth Amendment's protection against physical invasions of the home should apply to their functional equiva-lent. But the equipment in this case did not penetrate the
walls of petitioner's home, and while it did pick up "detailsof the home" that were exposed to the public,

ante, at 38, itdid not obtain "any information regarding the interior of the

home," ante, at 34 (emphasis added). In the Court's ownwords, based on what the thermal imager "showed" regarding the outside of petitioner's home, the officers "concluded"that petitioner was engaging in illegal activity inside the
home. Ante, at 30. It would be quite absurd to charac-terize their thought processes as "searches," regardless of
whether they inferred (rightly) that petitioner was growingmarijuana in his house, or (wrongly) that "the lady of the
house [was taking] her daily sauna and bath." Ante, at 38.In either case, the only conclusions the officers reached concerning the interior of the home were at least as indirectas those that might have been inferred from the contents
of discarded garbage, see California v. Greenwood, 486 U. S.35 (1988), or pen register data, see

Smith v. Maryland,442 U. S. 735 (1979), or, as in this case, subpoenaed utility

records, see 190 F. 3d 1041, 1043 (CA9 1999). For the firsttime in its history, the Court assumes that an inference
can amount to a Fourth Amendment violation. See ante,at 36-37.

Notwithstanding the implications of today's decision, there
is a strong public interest in avoiding constitutional litigation
over the monitoring of emissions from homes, and over the
inferences drawn from such monitoring. Just as "the police
cannot reasonably be expected to avert their eyes from
evidence of criminal activity that could have been observed
by any member of the public," Greenwood, 486 U. S., at 41,
so too public officials should not have to avert their senses
or their equipment from detecting emissions in the public
domain such as excessive heat, traces of smoke, suspicious
odors, odorless gases, airborne particulates, or radioactive
emissions, any of which could identify hazards to the community. In my judgment, monitoring such emissions with
"sense-enhancing technology," ante, at 34, and drawing useful conclusions from such monitoring, is an entirely reasonable public service.

On the other hand, the countervailing privacy interest
is at best trivial. After all, homes generally are insulated
to keep heat in, rather than to prevent the detection of heat
going out, and it does not seem to me that society will suffer
from a rule requiring the rare homeowner who both intends
to engage in uncommon activities that produce extraordinary
amounts of heat, and wishes to conceal that production from
outsiders, to make sure that the surrounding area is well
insulated. Cf. United States v. Jacobsen, 466 U. S. 109, 122
(1984) ("The concept of an interest in privacy that society is
prepared to recognize as reasonable is, by its very nature,
critically different from the mere expectation, however well

(1984), to refute a point we do not make underscores the fact that the
Court has no real answer (either in logic or in law) to the point we do
make. Of course, Karo itself does not provide any support for the Court's
view that inferences can amount to unconstitutional searches. The illegality in that case was "the monitoring of a beeper in a private residence"
to obtain information that "could not have [been] obtained by observation
from outside," id., at 714-715, rather than any thought processes that
flowed from such monitoring.

directed," the "physical entry of the home," United States v.United States Dist. Court for Eastern Dist. of Mich., 407
U. S. 297, 313 (1972), and it is hard to believe that it is an
interest the Framers sought to protect in our Constitution.Since what was involved in this case was nothing more

than drawing inferences from off-the-wall surveillance,rather than any "through-the-wall" surveillance, the officers'
conduct did not amount to a search and was perfectlyreasonable.

Instead of trying to answer the question whether the
use of the thermal imager in this case was even arguablyunreasonable, the Court has fashioned a rule that is intended to provide essential guidance for the day when "moresophisticated systems" gain the "ability to `see' through
walls and other opaque barriers." Ante, at 36, and n. 3.The newly minted rule encompasses "obtaining [1] by senseenhancing technology [2] any information regarding the in-terior of the home [3] that could not otherwise have been
obtained without physical intrusion into a constitutionally
protected area . . . [4] at least where (as here) the tech-nology in question is not in general public use."

Court's new rule is at once too broad and too narrow, and isnot justified by the Court's explanation for its adoption. As

I have suggested, I would not erect a constitutional impedi-ment to the use of sense-enhancing technology unless it provides its user with the functional equivalent of actual pres-ence in the area being searched.

Despite the Court's attempt to draw a line that is "notonly firm but also bright,"

ante, at 40, the contours of itsnew rule are uncertain because its protection apparently

dissipates as soon as the relevant technology is "in gen-eral public use," ante, at 34. Yet how much use is general
public use is not even hinted at by the Court's opinion, whichmakes the somewhat doubtful assumption that the thermal
imager used in this case does not satisfy that criterion.5In any event, putting aside its lack of clarity, this criterion
is somewhat perverse because it seems likely that the threatto privacy will grow, rather than recede, as the use of intrusive equipment becomes more readily available.It is clear, however, that the category of "sense-enhancing
technology" covered by the new rule, ibid., is far too broad.It would, for example, embrace potential mechanical substitutes for dogs trained to react when they sniff narcotics.But in

United States v. Place, 462 U. S. 696, 707 (1983), weheld that a dog sniff that "discloses only the presence or absence of narcotics" does "not constitute a `search' within themeaning of the Fourth Amendment," and it must follow that
sense-enhancing equipment that identifies nothing but illegal

5 The record describes a device that numbers close to a thousand manufactured units; that has a predecessor numbering in the neighborhood
of 4,000 to 5,000 units; that competes with a similar product numbering
from 5,000 to 6,000 units; and that is "readily available to the public" for
commercial, personal, or law enforcement purposes, and is just an 800-
number away from being rented from "half a dozen national companies"
by anyone who wants one. App. 18. Since, by virtue of the Court's
new rule, the issue is one of first impression, perhaps it should order an
evidentiary hearing to determine whether these facts suffice to establish
"general public use."

Stevens, J., dissenting
activity is not a search either. Nevertheless, the use of such
a device would be unconstitutional under the Court's rule, as
would the use of other new devices that might detect the
odor of deadly bacteria or chemicals for making a new type
of high explosive, even if the devices (like the dog sniffs)
are "so limited both in the manner in which" they obtain
information and "in the content of the information" they reveal. Ibid. If nothing more than that sort of information
could be obtained by using the devices in a public place to
monitor emissions from a house, then their use would be no
more objectionable than the use of the thermal imager in
this case.

The application of the Court's new rule to "any information regarding the interior of the home," ante, at 34, is also
unnecessarily broad. If it takes sensitive equipment to
detect an odor that identifies criminal conduct and nothing
else, the fact that the odor emanates from the interior of a
home should not provide it with constitutional protection.
See supra, at 47 and this page. The criterion, moreover, is
too sweeping in that information "regarding" the interior of
a home apparently is not just information obtained through
its walls, but also information concerning the outside of the
building that could lead to (however many) inferences "regarding" what might be inside. Under that expansive view,
I suppose, an officer using an infrared camera to observe a
man silently entering the side door of a house at night carrying a pizza might conclude that its interior is now occupied
by someone who likes pizza, and by doing so the officer would
be guilty of conducting an unconstitutional "search" of the
home.

Because the new rule applies to information regarding
the "interior" of the home, it is too narrow as well as too
broad. Clearly, a rule that is designed to protect individuals from the overly intrusive use of sense-enhancing equipment should not be limited to a home. If such equipment

did provide its user with the functional equivalent of access
to a private place--such as, for example, the telephone booth
involved in Katz, or an office building--then the rule should
apply to such an area as well as to a home. See Katz, 389
U. S., at 351 ("[T]he Fourth Amendment protects people,
not places").

The final requirement of the Court's new rule, that the
information "could not otherwise have been obtained without physical intrusion into a constitutionally protected area,"
ante, at 34 (internal quotation marks omitted), also extends
too far as the Court applies it. As noted, the Court effectively treats the mental process of analyzing data obtained
from external sources as the equivalent of a physical intrusion into the home. See supra, at 44. As I have explained, however, the process of drawing inferences from
data in the public domain should not be characterized as a
search.

The two reasons advanced by the Court as justifications
for the adoption of its new rule are both unpersuasive.
First, the Court suggests that its rule is compelled by our
holding in Katz, because in that case, as in this, the surveillance consisted of nothing more than the monitoring
of waves emanating from a private area into the public
domain. See ante, at 35. Yet there are critical differences between the cases. In Katz, the electronic listening
device attached to the outside of the phone booth allowed
the officers to pick up the content of the conversation inside
the booth, making them the functional equivalent of intruders because they gathered information that was otherwise available only to someone inside the private area; it
would be as if, in this case, the thermal imager presented a
view of the heat-generating activity inside petitioner's home.
By contrast, the thermal imager here disclosed only the
relative amounts of heat radiating from the house; it would
be as if, in Katz, the listening device disclosed only the rela533US1 Unit: $U69 [10-17-02 18:29:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tive volume of sound leaving the booth, which presumablywas discernible in the public domain.

6 Surely, there is a

significant difference between the general and well-settledexpectation that strangers will not have direct access to

the contents of private communications, on the one hand,and the rather theoretical expectation that an occasional
homeowner would even care if anybody noticed the relativeamounts of heat emanating from the walls of his house,
on the other. It is pure hyperbole for the Court to suggestthat refusing to extend the holding of

Katz to this case wouldleave the homeowner at the mercy of "technology that could

discern all human activity in the home." Ante, at 35-36.Second, the Court argues that the permissibility of

"through-the-wall surveillance" cannot depend on a dis-tinction between observing "intimate details" such as "the
lady of the house [taking] her daily sauna and bath," andnoticing only "the nonintimate rug on the vestibule floor" or
"objects no smaller than 36 by 36 inches." Ante, at 37, 38-39. This entire argument assumes, of course, that the thermal imager in this case could or did perform "through-the-wall surveillance" that could identify any detail "that would
previously have been unknowable without physical intru-sion."

Ante, at 39-40. In fact, the device could not, seen. 1, supra, and did not, see Appendix, infra, enable its user

to identify either the lady of the house, the rug on the vesti-bule floor, or anything else inside the house, whether smaller
or larger than 36 by 36 inches. Indeed, the vague thermalimages of petitioner's home that are reproduced in the Appendix were submitted by him to the District Court as partof an expert report raising the question whether the device
could even take "accurate, consistent infrared images" of the

6 The use of the latter device would be constitutional given Smith v.
Maryland, 442 U. S. 735, 741 (1979), which upheld the use of pen registers to record numbers dialed on a phone because, unlike "the listening
device employed in Katz . . . pen registers do not acquire the contents
of communications."

Buteven if the device could reliably show extraordinary differences in the amounts of heat leaving his home, drawing theinference that there was something suspicious occurring inside the residence--a conclusion that officers far less giftedthan Sherlock Holmes would readily draw--does not qualify
as "through-the-wall surveillance," much less a FourthAmendment violation.

III
Although the Court is properly and commendably con-cerned about the threats to privacy that may flow from advances in the technology available to the law enforcementprofession, it has unfortunately failed to heed the tried and
true counsel of judicial restraint. Instead of concentratingon the rather mundane issue that is actually presented by
the case before it, the Court has endeavored to craft anall-encompassing rule for the future. It would be far wiser
to give legislators an unimpeded opportunity to grapplewith these emerging issues rather than to shackle them with
prematurely devised constitutional constraints.I respectfully dissent.

TUAN ANH NGUYEN et al. v. IMMIGRATION ANDNATURALIZATION SERVICE
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 99-2071. Argued January 9, 2001--Decided June 11, 2001
Petitioner Tuan Anh Nguyen was born out of wedlock in Vietnam to a

Vietnamese citizen and copetitioner Joseph Boulais, a United States
citizen. Nguyen became a lawful permanent United States resident at
age six and was raised by Boulais. At age 22, Nguyen pleaded guilty
in a Texas state court to two counts of sexual assault on a child. Subsequently, respondent Immigration and Naturalization Service initiated
deportation proceedings against him based on his serious criminal
offenses. The Immigration Judge ordered him deportable. Boulais
obtained an order of parentage from a state court while Nguyen's appeal
was pending before the Board of Immigration Appeals, but the Board
dismissed the appeal, rejecting Nguyen's citizenship claim because he
had not complied with 8 U. S. C. $ 1409(a)'s requirements for one born
out of wedlock and abroad to a citizen father and a noncitizen mother.
On appeal, the Fifth Circuit rejected petitioners' claim that $ 1409
violates equal protection by providing different citizenship rules for
children born abroad and out of wedlock depending on whether the
citizen parent is the mother or the father.

Held: Section 1409 is consistent with the equal protection guarantee

embedded in the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause. Pp. 59-73.

(a) A child born abroad and out of wedlock acquires at birth the
nationality status of a citizen mother who meets a specified residency
requirement. $ 1409(c). However, when the father is the citizen parent, inter alia, one of three affirmative steps must be taken before the
child turns 18: legitimization, a declaration of paternity under oath
by the father, or a court order of paternity. $ 1409(a)(4). The failure to satisfy this section renders Nguyen ineligible for citizenship.
Pp. 59-60.

(b) A gender-based classification withstands equal protection scrutiny if it serves important governmental objectives and the discriminatory means employed are substantially related to the achievement of those objectives. United States v. Virginia, 518 U. S. 515, 533.
Congress' decision to impose different requirements on unmarried
fathers and unmarried mothers is based on the significant difference between their respective relationships to the potential citizen at the time

533US1 Unit: $U70 [10-17-02 18:52:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN
54 TUAN ANH NGUYEN v. INS

Syllabus
of birth and is justified by two important governmental interests.
Pp. 60-71.

(1) The first such interest is the importance of assuring that a
biological parent-child relationship exists. The mother's relation is
verifiable from the birth itself and is documented by the birth certificate
or hospital records and the witnesses to the birth. However, a father
need not be present at the birth, and his presence is not incontrovertible
proof of fatherhood. See Lehr v. Robertson, 463 U. S. 248, 260, n. 16.
Because fathers and mothers are not similarly situated with regard
to proof of biological parenthood, the imposition of different rules for
each is neither surprising nor troublesome from a constitutional perspective. Section 1409(a)(4)'s provision of three options is designed to
ensure acceptable documentation of paternity. Petitioners argue that

$ 1409(a)(1)'s requirement that a father provide clear and convincing
evidence of parentage is sufficient to achieve the end of establishing
paternity, given the sophistication of modern DNA tests. However,
that section does not mandate DNA testing. Moreover, the Constitution does not require that Congress elect one particular mechanism
from among many possible methods of establishing paternity, and

$ 1409(a)(4) represents a reasonable legislative conclusion that the
satisfaction of one of several alternatives will suffice to establish the
father-child blood link required as a predicate to the child's acquisition of citizenship. Finally, even a facially neutral rule would sometimes require fathers to take additional affirmative steps which would
not be required of mothers, whose names will be on the birth certificate
as a result of their presence at the birth, and who will have the benefit
of witnesses to the birth to call upon. Pp. 62-64.

(2) The second governmental interest furthered by $ 1409(a)(4) is
the determination to ensure that the child and citizen parent have some
demonstrated opportunity to develop a relationship that consists of real,
everyday ties providing a connection between child and citizen parent
and, in turn, the United States. Such an opportunity inheres in the
event of birth in the case of a citizen mother and her child, but does not
result as a matter of biological inevitability in the case of an unwed
father. He may not know that a child was conceived, and a mother
may be unsure of the father's identity. One concern in this context
has always been with young men on duty with the Armed Forces in
foreign countries. Today, the ease of travel and willingness of Americans to visit foreign countries have resulted in numbers of trips abroad
that must be of real concern when contemplating the prospect of mandating, contrary to Congress' wishes, citizenship by male parentage subject to no condition other than the father's residence in this country.
Equal protection principles do not require Congress to ignore this

55Cite as: 533 U. S. 53 (2001)
Syllabus
reality. Section 1409 takes the unremarkable step of ensuring that the
opportunity inherent in the event of birth as to the mother-child relationship exists between father and child before citizenship is conferred upon the latter. That interest's importance is too profound to
be satisfied by a DNA test because scientific proof of biological paternity does not, by itself, ensure father-child contact during the child's
minority. Congress is well within its authority in refusing, absent
proof of an opportunity for a relationship to develop, to commit this
country to embracing a child as a citizen. Contrary to petitioners' argument, $ 1409 does not embody a gender-based stereotype. There is
nothing irrational or improper in recognizing that at the moment of
birth--a critical event in the statutory scheme and tradition of citizenship law--the mother's knowledge of the child and the fact of parenthood have been established in a way not guaranteed to the unwed
father. Pp. 64-68.

(3) The means Congress chose substantially relate to its interest
in facilitating a parent-child relationship. First, various statutory provisions, in addition to $ 1409(a), require that some act linking a child to
the United States occur before the child turns 18. Second, petitioners'
argument that $ 1409(a)(4) reflects a stereotype that women are more
likely than men to actually establish the required relationship misconceives both the governmental interest's nature and the equal protection inquiry. As to the former, Congress could have chosen to advance the interest of ensuring a meaningful relationship in every
case, but it enacted instead an easily administered scheme to promote
the different but still substantial interest of ensuring an opportunity
for that relationship to develop. Petitioners' argument confuses the
equal protection inquiry's means and ends; $ 1409(a)(4) should not be
invalidated because Congress elected to advance an interest that is
less demanding to satisfy than some alternative. Even if one conceives
of Congress' real interest as the establishment of a meaningful relationship, it is almost axiomatic that a policy seeking to foster the opportunity for meaningful parent-child bonds to develop has a close and substantial bearing on the governmental interest in that bond's formation.
Here, Congress' means are in substantial furtherance of an important
governmental objective, and the fit between the means and that end is
exceedingly persuasive. See Virginia, supra, at 533. Pp. 68-70.

(c) Section 1409(a)(4) imposes a minimal obligation. Only the least
onerous of its three options must be satisfied; and it can be satisfied on
the day of birth, or the next day, or for the next 18 years. Section
1409(a), moreover, is not the sole means of attaining citizenship for the
child, who can seek citizenship in his or her own right, rather than via
reliance on parental ties. Pp. 70-71.

naturalization power. Pp. 71-73.

the statutory distinction is consistent with the equal protection guarantee embedded in the Due Process Clause of
the Fifth Amendment.

I

Petitioner Tuan Anh Nguyen was born in Saigon, Vietnam,
on September 11, 1969, to copetitioner Joseph Boulais and a
Vietnamese citizen. Boulais and Nguyen's mother were not
married. Boulais always has been a citizen of the United
States, and he was in Vietnam under the employ of a corporation. After he and Nguyen's mother ended their relationship, Nguyen lived for a time with the family of Boulais'
new Vietnamese girlfriend. In June 1975, Nguyen, then
almost six years of age, came to the United States. He became a lawful permanent resident and was raised in Texas
by Boulais.

In 1992, when Nguyen was 22, he pleaded guilty in a Texas
state court to two counts of sexual assault on a child. He
was sentenced to eight years in prison on each count. Three
years later, the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) initiated deportation proceedings against
Nguyen as an alien who had been convicted of two crimes
involving moral turpitude, as well as an aggravated felony.
See 8 U. S. C. $$ 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii) and (iii) (1994 ed., Supp. IV).
Though later he would change his position and argue he was
a United States citizen, Nguyen testified at his deportation
hearing that he was a citizen of Vietnam. The Immigration
Judge found him deportable.

Nguyen appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals
and, in 1998, while the matter was pending, his father obtained an order of parentage from a state court, based on
DNA testing. By this time, Nguyen was 28 years old. The
Board dismissed Nguyen's appeal, rejecting his claim to
United States citizenship because he had failed to establish
compliance with 8 U. S. C. $ 1409(a), which sets forth the re533US1 Unit: $U70 [10-17-02 18:52:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
quirements for one who was born out of wedlock and abroadto a citizen father and a noncitizen mother.

Nguyen and Boulais appealed to the Court of Appeals forthe Fifth Circuit, arguing that $ 1409 violates equal protection by providing different rules for attainment of citizenshipby children born abroad and out of wedlock depending upon
whether the one parent with American citizenship is the
mother or the father. The court rejected the constitutionalchallenge to $ 1409(a). 208 F. 3d 528, 535 (2000).

The constitutionality of the distinction between unwedfathers and mothers was argued in

Miller, but a majority
of the Court did not resolve the issue. Four Justices, in
two different opinions, rejected the challenge to the genderbased distinction, two finding the statute consistent with
the Fifth Amendment, see 523 U. S., at 423 (opinion of Stevens, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J.), and two concluding that the court could not confer citizenship as a remedy
even if the statute violated equal protection, see id., at 452
(Scalia, J., joined by Thomas, J., concurring in judgment).
Three Justices reached a contrary result, and would have
found the statute violative of equal protection. Id., at 460
(Ginsburg, J., joined by Souter and Breyer, JJ., dissenting); id., at 471 (Breyer, J., joined by Souter and Ginsburg, JJ., dissenting). Finally, two Justices did not reach
the issue as to the father, having determined that the
child, the only petitioner in Miller, lacked standing to raise
the equal protection rights of his father. Id., at 445 (O'Connor, J., joined by Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment).

Since Miller, the Courts of Appeal have divided over the
constitutionality of $ 1409. Compare 208 F. 3d 528 (CA5
2000) (case below) with Lake v. Reno, 226 F. 3d 141 (CA2
2000), and United States v. Ahumada-Aguilar, 189 F. 3d 1121
(CA9 1999). We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict.
530 U. S. 1305 (2000). The father is before the Court in
this case; and, as all agree he has standing to raise the constitutional claim, we now resolve it. We hold that $ 1409(a)

Opinion of the Court
is consistent with the constitutional guarantee of equalprotection.

II
The general requirement for acquisition of citizenshipby a child born outside the United States and its outlying

possessions and to parents who are married, one of whomis a citizen and the other of whom is an alien, is set forth

in 8 U. S. C. $ 1401(g). The statute provides that the childis also a citizen if, before the birth, the citizen parent had
been physically present in the United States for a total offive years, at least two of which were after the parent turned
14 years of age.As to an individual born under the same circumstances,
save that the parents are unwed, $ 1409(a) sets forth the fol-lowing requirements where the father is the citizen parent
and the mother is an alien:

"(1) a blood relationship between the person and thefather is established by clear and convincing evidence,

"(2) the father had the nationality of the UnitedStates at the time of the person's birth,
"(3) the father (unless deceased) has agreed in writingto provide financial support for the person until the person reaches the age of 18 years, and"(4) while the person is under the age of 18 years--

"(A) the person is legitimated under the law of theperson's residence or domicile,
"(B) the father acknowledges paternity of the personin writing under oath, or
"(C) the paternity of the person is established by ad-judication of a competent court."

In addition, $ 1409(a) incorporates by reference, as to thecitizen parent, the residency requirement of $ 1401(g).

When the citizen parent of the child born abroad and outof wedlock is the child's mother, the requirements for the
transmittal of citizenship are described in $ 1409(c):

533US1 Unit: $U70 [10-17-02 18:52:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN
60 TUAN ANH NGUYEN v. INS

Opinion of the Court
"(c) Notwithstanding the provision of subsection (a)of this section, a person born, after December 23, 1952,

outside the United States and out of wedlock shall beheld to have acquired at birth the nationality status of
his mother, if the mother had the nationality of theUnited States at the time of such person's birth, and if
the mother had previously been physically present inthe United States or one of its outlying possessions for
a continuous period of one year."
Section 1409(a) thus imposes a set of requirements on thechildren of citizen fathers born abroad and out of wedlock

to a noncitizen mother that are not imposed under likecircumstances when the citizen parent is the mother. All
concede the requirements of $$ 1409(a)(3) and (a)(4), relat-ing to a citizen father's acknowledgment of a child while
he is under 18, were not satisfied in this case. We need notdiscuss $ 1409(a)(3), however. It was added in 1986, after
Nguyen's birth; and Nguyen falls within a transitional rulewhich allows him to elect application of either the current version of the statute, or the pre-1986 version, whichcontained no parallel to $ 1409(a)(3). See Immigration and
Nationality Act Amendments of 1986, 100 Stat. 3655; notefollowing 8 U. S. C. $ 1409; Miller, supra, at 426, n. 3, 432
(opinion of Stevens, J.). And in any event, our ruling re-specting $ 1409(a)(4) is dispositive of the case. As an individual seeking citizenship under $ 1409(a) must meet allof its preconditions, the failure to satisfy $ 1409(a)(4) renders
Nguyen ineligible for citizenship.

III
For a gender-based classification to withstand equal pro-tection scrutiny, it must be established " `at least that the

[challenged] classification serves "important governmentalobjectives and that the discriminatory means employed"
are "substantially related to the achievement of those ob-jectives." ' "

Opinion of the Court
(1996) (quoting Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458U. S. 718, 724 (1982), in turn quoting

Wengler v. Druggists
Mut. Ins. Co., 446 U. S. 142, 150 (1980)). For reasons tofollow, we conclude $ 1409 satisfies this standard. Given

that determination, we need not decide whether some lesserdegree of scrutiny pertains because the statute implicates Congress' immigration and naturalization power. See
Miller, 523 U. S., at 434, n. 11 (explaining that the statutemust be subjected to a standard more deferential to the

congressional exercise of the immigration and naturalizationpower, but that "[e]ven if . . . the heightened scrutiny that
normally governs gender discrimination claims applied in
this context," the statute would be sustained (citations
omitted)).

Before considering the important governmental interests advanced by the statute, two observations concerning
the operation of the provision are in order. First, a citizen
mother expecting a child and living abroad has the right to
reenter the United States so the child can be born here
and be a 14th Amendment citizen. From one perspective,
then, the statute simply ensures equivalence between two
expectant mothers who are citizens abroad if one chooses
to reenter for the child's birth and the other chooses not to
return, or does not have the means to do so. This equivalence is not a factor if the single citizen parent living abroad
is the father. For, unlike the unmarried mother, the unmarried father as a general rule cannot control where the
child will be born.

Second, although $ 1409(a)(4) requires certain conduct to
occur before the child of a citizen father, born out of wedlock
and abroad, reaches 18 years of age, it imposes no limitations
on when an individual who qualifies under the statute can
claim citizenship. The statutory treatment of citizenship is
identical in this respect whether the citizen parent is the
mother or the father. A person born to a citizen parent of
either gender may assert citizenship, assuming compliance

62 TUAN ANH NGUYEN v. INS

Opinion of the Court
with statutory preconditions, regardless of his or her age.And while the conditions necessary for a citizen mother

to transmit citizenship under $ 1409(c) exist at birth, citi-zen fathers and/or their children have 18 years to satisfy
the requirements of $ 1409(a)(4). See Miller, supra, at 435(opinion of

Stevens, J.).The statutory distinction relevant in this case, then, is

that $ 1409(a)(4) requires one of three affirmative steps tobe taken if the citizen parent is the father, but not if the
citizen parent is the mother: legitimation; a declaration ofpaternity under oath by the father; or a court order of paternity. Congress' decision to impose requirements on un-married fathers that differ from those on unmarried mothers
is based on the significant difference between their respec-tive relationships to the potential citizen at the time of birth.
Specifically, the imposition of the requirement for a paternalrelationship, but not a maternal one, is justified by two important governmental objectives. We discuss each in turn.

A
The first governmental interest to be served is the im-portance of assuring that a biological parent-child relationship exists. In the case of the mother, the relation isverifiable from the birth itself. The mother's status is documented in most instances by the birth certificate or hospitalrecords and the witnesses who attest to her having given
birth.In the case of the father, the uncontestable fact is that
he need not be present at the birth. If he is present, fur-thermore, that circumstance is not incontrovertible proof
of fatherhood. See Lehr v. Robertson, 463 U. S. 248, 260,n. 16 (1983) (" `The mother carries and bears the child, and
in this sense her parental relationship is clear. The validityof the father's parental claims must be gauged by other
measures' " (quoting Caban v. Mohammed, 441 U. S. 380, 397(1979) (Stewart, J., dissenting)));

U. S. 762, 770 (1977) ("The more serious problems of prov-ing paternity might justify a more demanding standard for

illegitimate children claiming under their fathers' estatesthan that required . . . under their mothers' estates . . .").
Fathers and mothers are not similarly situated with re-gard to the proof of biological parenthood. The imposition
of a different set of rules for making that legal determination with respect to fathers and mothers is neither sur-prising nor troublesome from a constitutional perspective.

Cf. Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc., 473 U. S. 432,439 (1985) (explaining that the Equal Protection Clause
"is essentially a direction that all persons similarly situated
should be treated alike"); F. S. Royster Guano Co. v. Virginia, 253 U. S. 412, 415 (1920). Section 1409(a)(4)'s provision of three options for a father seeking to establish
paternity--legitimation, paternity oath, and court order of
paternity--is designed to ensure an acceptable documentation of paternity.

Petitioners argue that the requirement of $ 1409(a)(1), that
a father provide clear and convincing evidence of parentage,
is sufficient to achieve the end of establishing paternity,
given the sophistication of modern DNA tests. Brief for
Petitioners 21-24. Section 1409(a)(1) does not actually mandate a DNA test, however. The Constitution, moreover,
does not require that Congress elect one particular mechanism from among many possible methods of establishing
paternity, even if that mechanism arguably might be the
most scientifically advanced method. With respect to DNA
testing, the expense, reliability, and availability of such testing in various parts of the world may have been of particular
concern to Congress. See Miller, supra, at 437 (opinion of
Stevens, J.). The requirement of $ 1409(a)(4) represents a
reasonable conclusion by the legislature that the satisfaction of one of several alternatives will suffice to establish
the blood link between father and child required as a predicate to the child's acquisition of citizenship. Cf. Lehr, supra,

Opinion of the Court
at 267-268 (upholding New York statutory requirement thatgave mothers of children born out of wedlock notice of an

adoption hearing, but only extended that right to fatherswho mailed a postcard to a "putative fathers registry").
Given the proof of motherhood that is inherent in birth itself,it is unremarkable that Congress did not require the same
affirmative steps of mothers.Finally, to require Congress to speak without reference
to the gender of the parent with regard to its objective ofensuring a blood tie between parent and child would be to
insist on a hollow neutrality. As Justice Stevens pointedout in

Miller, Congress could have required both mothersand fathers to prove parenthood within 30 days or, for that

matter, 18 years, of the child's birth. 523 U. S., at 436.Given that the mother is always present at birth, but that
the father need not be, the facially neutral rule would some-times require fathers to take additional affirmative steps
which would not be required of mothers, whose names willappear on the birth certificate as a result of their presence
at the birth, and who will have the benefit of witnesses tothe birth to call upon. The issue is not the use of gender
specific terms instead of neutral ones. Just as neutral termscan mask discrimination that is unlawful, gender specific
terms can mark a permissible distinction. The equal protec-tion question is whether the distinction is lawful. Here, the
use of gender specific terms takes into account a biologicaldifference between the parents. The differential treatment
is inherent in a sensible statutory scheme, given the uniquerelationship of the mother to the event of birth.

The second important governmental interest furtheredin a substantial manner by $ 1409(a)(4) is the determination

to ensure that the child and the citizen parent have somedemonstrated opportunity or potential to develop not just a

Opinion of the Court
relationship that is recognized, as a formal matter, by thelaw, but one that consists of the real, everyday ties that

provide a connection between child and citizen parent and,in turn, the United States. See

id., at 438-440 (opinion of
Stevens, J.). In the case of a citizen mother and a childborn overseas, the opportunity for a meaningful relationship

between citizen parent and child inheres in the very event
of birth, an event so often critical to our constitutional andstatutory understandings of citizenship. The mother knows

that the child is in being and is hers and has an initial pointof contact with him. There is at least an opportunity for
mother and child to develop a real, meaningful relationship.

The same opportunity does not result from the event of
birth, as a matter of biological inevitability, in the case of the
unwed father. Given the 9-month interval between conception and birth, it is not always certain that a father will
know that a child was conceived, nor is it always clear that
even the mother will be sure of the father's identity. This
fact takes on particular significance in the case of a child
born overseas and out of wedlock. One concern in this context has always been with young people, men for the most
part, who are on duty with the Armed Forces in foreign
countries. See Department of Defense, Selected Manpower
Statistics 48, 74 (1999) (reporting that in 1969, the year in
which Nguyen was born, there were 3,458,072 active duty
military personnel, 39,506 of whom were female); Department of Defense, Selected Manpower Statistics 29 (1970)
(noting that 1,041,094 military personnel were stationed in
foreign countries in 1969); Department of Defense, Selected
Manpower Statistics 49, 76 (1999) (reporting that in 1999
there were 1,385,703 active duty military personnel, 200,287
of whom were female); id., at 33 (noting that 252,763 military
personnel were stationed in foreign countries in 1999).

When we turn to the conditions which prevail today, we
find that the passage of time has produced additional and
even more substantial grounds to justify the statutory dis533US1 Unit: $U70 [10-17-02 18:52:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
tinction. The ease of travel and the willingness of Ameri-cans to visit foreign countries have resulted in numbers

of trips abroad that must be of real concern when we con-template the prospect of accepting petitioners' argument,
which would mandate, contrary to Congress' wishes, citizen-ship by male parentage subject to no condition save the
father's previous length of residence in this country. In
1999 alone, Americans made almost 25 million trips abroad,excluding trips to Canada and Mexico. See U. S. Dept. of

Commerce, 1999 Profile of U. S. Travelers to Overseas Des-tinations 1 (Oct. 2000). Visits to Canada and Mexico add
to this figure almost 34 million additional visits. See U. S.
Dept. of Commerce, U. S. Resident Travel to Overseas Countries, Historical Visitation 1989-1999, p. 1 (Oct. 2000). And
the average American overseas traveler spent 15.1 nights
out of the United States in 1999. 1999 Profile of U. S. Travelers to Overseas Destinations, supra, at 4.

Principles of equal protection do not require Congress to
ignore this reality. To the contrary, these facts demonstrate
the critical importance of the Government's interest in ensuring some opportunity for a tie between citizen father
and foreign born child which is a reasonable substitute for
the opportunity manifest between mother and child at the
time of birth. Indeed, especially in light of the number of
Americans who take short sojourns abroad, the prospect
that a father might not even know of the conception is a
realistic possibility. See Miller, supra, at 439 (opinion of
Stevens, J.). Even if a father knows of the fact of conception, moreover, it does not follow that he will be present at
the birth of the child. Thus, unlike the case of the mother,
there is no assurance that the father and his biological child
will ever meet. Without an initial point of contact with the
child by a father who knows the child is his own, there is
no opportunity for father and child to begin a relationship.
Section 1409 takes the unremarkable step of ensuring that
such an opportunity, inherent in the event of birth as to the

Opinion of the Court
mother-child relationship, exists between father and childbefore citizenship is conferred upon the latter.

The importance of the governmental interest at issue hereis too profound to be satisfied merely by conducting a DNA
test. The fact of paternity can be established even withoutthe father's knowledge, not to say his presence. Paternity
can be established by taking DNA samples even from a
few strands of hair, years after the birth. See Federal Ju-dicial Center, Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence 497

(2d ed. 2000). Yet scientific proof of biological paternitydoes nothing, by itself, to ensure contact between father and
child during the child's minority.

Congress is well within its authority in refusing, absent
proof of at least the opportunity for the development of a
relationship between citizen parent and child, to commit this
country to embracing a child as a citizen entitled as of birth
to the full protection of the United States, to the absolute
right to enter its borders, and to full participation in the
political process. If citizenship is to be conferred by the unwitting means petitioners urge, so that its acquisition abroad
bears little relation to the realities of the child's own ties and
allegiances, it is for Congress, not this Court, to make that
determination. Congress has not taken that path but has
instead chosen, by means of $ 1409, to ensure in the case of
father and child the opportunity for a relationship to develop,
an opportunity which the event of birth itself provides for
the mother and child. It should be unobjectionable for Congress to require some evidence of a minimal opportunity for
the development of a relationship with the child in terms the
male can fulfill.

While the INS' brief contains statements indicating the
governmental interest we here describe, see Brief for Respondent 38, 41, it suggests other interests as well. Statements from the INS' brief are not conclusive as to the objects
of the statute, however, as we are concerned with the objectives of Congress, not those of the INS. We ascertain the

Opinion of the Court
purpose of a statute by drawing logical conclusions from itstext, structure, and operation.

Petitioners and their amici argue in addition that, ratherthan fulfilling an important governmental interest, $ 1409
merely embodies a gender-based stereotype. Although theabove discussion should illustrate that, contrary to petitioners' assertions, $ 1409 addresses an undeniable difference inthe circumstance of the parents at the time a child is born,
it should be noted, furthermore, that the difference does notresult from some stereotype, defined as a frame of mind resulting from irrational or uncritical analysis. There is noth-ing irrational or improper in the recognition that at the moment of birth--a critical event in the statutory scheme andin the whole tradition of citizenship law--the mother's
knowledge of the child and the fact of parenthood have beenestablished in a way not guaranteed in the case of the unwed
father. This is not a stereotype. See Virginia, 518 U. S.,at 533 ("The heightened review standard our precedent
establishes does not make sex a proscribed classifica-tion. . . . Physical differences between men and women . . .
are enduring"). 2

Having concluded that facilitation of a relationship be-tween parent and child is an important governmental interest, the question remains whether the means Congresschose to further its objective--the imposition of certain additional requirements upon an unwed father--substantiallyrelate to that end. Under this test, the means Congress
adopted must be sustained.First, it should be unsurprising that Congress decided
to require that an opportunity for a parent-child relation-ship occur during the formative years of the child's minority.
In furtherance of the desire to ensure some tie between thiscountry and one who seeks citizenship, various other statutory provisions concerning citizenship and naturalizationrequire some act linking the child to the United States to

occur before the child reaches 18 years of age. See, e. g., 8U. S. C. $ 1431 (child born abroad to one citizen parent and

one noncitizen parent shall become a citizen if, inter alia, thenoncitizen parent is naturalized before the child reaches 18
years of age and the child begins to reside in the UnitedStates before he or she turns 18); $ 1432 (imposing same conditions in the case of a child born abroad to two alien parents
who are naturalized).Second, petitioners argue that $ 1409(a)(4) is not effective.

In particular, petitioners assert that, although a mother willknow of her child's birth, "knowledge that one is a parent,
no matter how it is acquired, does not guarantee a relationship with one's child." Brief for Petitioners 16. They
thus maintain that the imposition of the additional requirements of $ 1409(a)(4) only on the children of citizen fathers
must reflect a stereotype that women are more likely than
men to actually establish a relationship with their children.
Id., at 17.

This line of argument misconceives the nature of both the
governmental interest at issue and the manner in which we
examine statutes alleged to violate equal protection. As to
the former, Congress would of course be entitled to advance
the interest of ensuring an actual, meaningful relationship
in every case before citizenship is conferred. Or Congress
could excuse compliance with the formal requirements when
an actual father-child relationship is proved. It did neither
here, perhaps because of the subjectivity, intrusiveness, and
difficulties of proof that might attend an inquiry into any
particular bond or tie. Instead, Congress enacted an easily
administered scheme to promote the different but still
substantial interest of ensuring at least an opportunity for
a parent-child relationship to develop. Petitioners' argument confuses the means and ends of the equal protection
inquiry; $ 1409(a)(4) should not be invalidated because Congress elected to advance an interest that is less demanding
to satisfy than some other alternative.

Opinion of the Court
Even if one conceives of the interest Congress pursuesas the establishment of a real, practical relationship of considerable substance between parent and child in every case,as opposed simply to ensuring the potential for the relationship to begin, petitioners' misconception of the natureof the equal protection inquiry is fatal to their argument.
A statute meets the equal protection standard we here applyso long as it is " ` "substantially related to the achievement
of " ' " the governmental objective in question. Virginia,
supra, at 533 (quoting Hogan, 458 U. S., at 724, in turn quot-ing Wengler, 446 U. S., at 150). It is almost axiomatic that

a policy which seeks to foster the opportunity for meaningfulparent-child bonds to develop has a close and substantial
bearing on the governmental interest in the actual forma-tion of that bond. None of our gender-based classification
equal protection cases have required that the statute underconsideration must be capable of achieving its ultimate objective in every instance. In this difficult context of con-ferring citizenship on vast numbers of persons, the means
adopted by Congress are in substantial furtherance of impor-tant governmental objectives. The fit between the means
and the important end is "exceedingly persuasive." See
Virginia, supra, at 533. We have explained that an "ex-ceedingly persuasive justification" is established "by showing at least that the classification serves `important gov-ernmental objectives and that the discriminatory means
employed' are `substantially related to the achievement ofthose objectives.' " Hogan, supra, at 724 (citations omitted).
Section 1409 meets this standard.

C
In analyzing $ 1409(a)(4), we are mindful that the obli-gation it imposes with respect to the acquisition of citizenship by the child of a citizen father is minimal. This circum-stance shows that Congress has not erected inordinate and
unnecessary hurdles to the conferral of citizenship on the

533US1 Unit: $U70 [10-17-02 18:52:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN

71Cite as: 533 U. S. 53 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
children of citizen fathers in furthering its important objec-tives. Only the least onerous of the three options provided

for in $ 1409(a)(4) must be satisfied. If the child has beenlegitimated under the law of the relevant jurisdiction, that
will be the end of the matter. See $ 1409(a)(4)(A). In thealternative, a father who has not legitimated his child by
formal means need only make a written acknowledgmentof paternity under oath in order to transmit citizenship to
his child, hardly a substantial burden. See $ 1409(a)(4)(B).Or, the father could choose to obtain a court order of paternity. See $ 1409(a)(4)(C). The statute can be satisfied onthe day of birth, or the next day, or for the next 18 years.
In this case, the unfortunate, even tragic, circumstance isthat Boulais did not pursue, or perhaps did not know of, these
simple steps and alternatives. Any omission, however, doesnot nullify the statutory scheme.

Section 1409(a), moreover, is not the sole means by whichthe child of a citizen father can attain citizenship. An individual who fails to comply with $ 1409(a), but who has sub-stantial ties to the United States, can seek citizenship in his
or her own right, rather than via reliance on ties to a citizenparent. See, e. g., 8 U. S. C. $$ 1423, 1427. This option now
may be foreclosed to Nguyen, but any bar is due to the seri-ous nature of his criminal offenses, not to an equal protection denial or to any supposed rigidity or harshness in thecitizenship laws.

IV
The statutory scheme's satisfaction of the equal protec-tion scrutiny we apply to gender-based classifications constitutes a sufficient basis for upholding it. It should be noted,however, that, even were we to conclude that the statute
did not meet this standard of review, petitioners would faceadditional obstacles before they could prevail.

The INS urges that, irrespective of whether $ 1409(a) isconstitutional, the Court cannot grant the relief petitioners
request: the conferral of citizenship on terms other than

Opinion of the Court
those specified by Congress. There may well be "potentialproblems with fashioning a remedy" were we to find the

statute unconstitutional. See Miller, 523 U. S., at 451(O'C

onnor, J., concurring in judgment); cf. id., at 445, n. 26
(opinion of Stevens, J.) (declining to address the questionwhether the Court could confer the sought-after remedy).

Two Members of today's majority said in Miller that this
argument was dispositive. See id., at 452-459 (Scalia, J.,joined by

Thomas, J., concurring in judgment). Petitioners
ask us to invalidate and sever $$ 1409(a)(3) and (a)(4), butit must be remembered that severance is based on the

assumption that Congress would have intended the result.
See id., at 457 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (citing
New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144 (1992)). In this
regard, it is significant that, although the Immigration and
Nationality Act contains a general severability provision,
Congress expressly provided with respect to the very subchapter of the United States Code at issue and in a provision entitled "Sole procedure" that "[a] person may only be
naturalized as a citizen of the United States in the manner
and under the conditions prescribed in this subchapter and
not otherwise." 8 U. S. C. $ 1421(d); see also Miller, supra,
at 457-458 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment). Section
1421(d) refers to naturalization, which in turn is defined as
"conferring of nationality of a state upon a person after
birth." 8 U. S. C. $ 1101(a)(23). Citizenship under $ 1409(a)
is retroactive to the date of birth, but it is a naturalization
under $ 1421(d) nevertheless. The conditions specified by

$ 1409(a) for conferral of citizenship, as a matter of definition,
must take place after the child is born, in some instances
taking as long as 18 years. Section 1409(a), then, is subject
to the limitation imposed by $ 1421(d).

In light of our holding that there is no equal protection
violation, we need not rely on this argument. For the same
reason, we need not assess the implications of statements in
our earlier cases regarding the wide deference afforded to

Congress in the exercise of its immigration and naturaliza-tion power. See, e. g., Fiallo v. Bell, 430 U. S. 787, 792-793,

and n. 4 (1977) (quoting Galvan v. Press, 347 U. S. 522, 531(1954)); 430 U. S., at 792 (quoting Oceanic Steam Nav. Co. v.
Stranahan, 214 U. S. 320, 339 (1909)). These argumentswould have to be considered, however, were it to be determined that $ 1409 did not withstand conventional equalprotection scrutiny.

V
To fail to acknowledge even our most basic biologicaldifferences--such as the fact that a mother must be present at birth but the father need not be--risks making theguarantee of equal protection superficial, and so disserving it. Mechanistic classification of all our differences asstereotypes would operate to obscure those misconceptions
and prejudices that are real. The distinction embodied inthe statutory scheme here at issue is not marked by misconception and prejudice, nor does it show disrespect foreither class. The difference between men and women in relation to the birth process is a real one, and the principleof equal protection does not forbid Congress to address the
problem at hand in a manner specific to each gender.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is

Affirmed.
Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas joins,concurring.
I remain of the view that the Court lacks power to pro-vide relief of the sort requested in this suit--namely, conferral of citizenship on a basis other than that prescribed byCongress. See

Miller v. Albright, 523 U. S. 420, 452 (1998)(

O'Connor, J., dissenting

for me to reach the merits of petitioners' equal protectionclaims. I join the opinion of the Court.

Justice O'Connor, with whom Justice Souter, Justice
Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.

In a long line of cases spanning nearly three decades, thisCourt has applied heightened scrutiny to legislative classifications based on sex. The Court today confronts anotherstatute that classifies individuals on the basis of their sex.
While the Court invokes heightened scrutiny, the manner inwhich it explains and applies this standard is a stranger
to our precedents. Because the Immigration and Natural-ization Service (INS) has not shown an exceedingly persuasive justification for the sex-based classification embodied in8 U. S. C. $ 1409(a)(4)--i. e., because it has failed to establish
at least that the classification substantially relates to theachievement of important governmental objectives--I would
reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

I
Sex-based statutes, even when accurately reflecting theway most men or women behave, deny individuals opportunity. Such generalizations must be viewed not in isolation,but in the context of our Nation's " `long and unfortunate
history of sex discrimination.' " J. E. B. v. Alabama ex rel.T. B., 511 U. S. 127, 136 (1994) (quoting Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U. S. 677, 684 (1973) (plurality opinion)). Sex-basedgeneralizations both reflect and reinforce "fixed notions concerning the roles and abilities of males and females." Mis-sissippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U. S. 718, 725 (1982).

For these reasons, a party who seeks to defend a statutethat classifies individuals on the basis of sex "must carry the
burden of showing an `exceedingly persuasive justification'for the classification."

Feenstra, 450 U. S. 455, 461 (1981)); see also United States
v. Virginia, 518 U. S. 515, 531 (1996). The defender of the
classification meets this burden "only by showing at least
that the classification serves `important governmental objectives and that the discriminatory means employed' are
`substantially related to the achievement of those objectives.' " Mississippi Univ. for Women, supra, at 724 (quoting Wengler v. Druggists Mut. Ins. Co., 446 U. S. 142, 150
(1980)); see also Virginia, 518 U. S., at 533.

Our cases provide significant guidance concerning the
meaning of this standard and how a reviewing court is to
apply it. This Court's instruction concerning the application
of heightened scrutiny to sex-based classifications stands in
stark contrast to our elucidation of the rudiments of rational
basis review. To begin with, under heightened scrutiny,
"[t]he burden of justification is demanding and it rests entirely on [the party defending the classification]." Ibid.
Under rational basis scrutiny, by contrast, the defender of
the classification "has no obligation to produce evidence to
sustain the rationality of a statutory classification." Heller
v. Doe, 509 U. S. 312, 320 (1993). Instead, "[t]he burden is
on the one attacking the legislative arrangement to negative
every conceivable basis which might support it, whether or
not the basis has a foundation in the record." Id., at 320-
321 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).

Further, a justification that sustains a sex-based classification "must be genuine, not hypothesized or invented
post hoc in response to litigation." Virginia, supra, at 533.
"[T]he mere recitation of a benign, compensatory purpose is
not an automatic shield which protects against any inquiry
into the actual purposes underlying a statutory scheme."
Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U. S. 636, 648 (1975). Under
rational basis review, by contrast, it is " `constitutionally
irrelevant [what] reasoning in fact underlay the legislative
decision.' " Railroad Retirement Bd. v. Fritz, 449 U. S. 166,

533US1 Unit: $U70 [10-17-02 18:52:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN
76 TUAN ANH NGUYEN v. INS

O'Connor, J., dissenting
179 (1980) (quoting Flemming v. Nestor, 363 U. S. 603, 612(1960)).

Heightened scrutiny does not countenance justificationsthat "rely on overbroad generalizations about the different talents, capacities, or preferences of males and females."
Virginia, supra, at 533. Rational basis review, by contrast, is much more tolerant of the use of broad generalizations about different classes of individuals, so long as theclassification is not arbitrary or irrational. See,

e. g., Kimel
v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 528 U. S. 62, 84 (2000); Fritz,
supra, at 177.

Moreover, overbroad sex-based generalizations are impermissible even when they enjoy empirical support. See, e. g.,
J. E. B., supra, at 139, n. 11; Craig v. Boren, 429 U. S. 190,
199 (1976); Wiesenfeld, supra, at 645. Under rational basis
scrutiny, however, empirical support is not even necessary
to sustain a classification. See, e. g., FCC v. Beach Communications, Inc., 508 U. S. 307, 315 (1993) ("[A] legislative
choice is not subject to courtroom factfinding and may be
based on rational speculation unsupported by evidence or
empirical data").

The different burdens imposed by these equal protection
standards correspond to the different duties of a reviewing
court in applying each standard. The court's task in applying heightened scrutiny to a sex-based classification is clear:
"Focusing on the differential treatment or denial of opportunity for which relief is sought, the reviewing court must determine whether the proffered justification is `exceedingly
persuasive.' " Virginia, 518 U. S., at 532-533. In making
this determination, the court must inquire into the actual
purposes of the discrimination, for "a tenable justification
must describe actual state purposes, not rationalizations
for actions in fact differently grounded." Id., at 535-536;
see also id., at 533; Wiesenfeld, supra, at 648; Califano v.
Goldfarb, 430 U. S. 199, 212-217 (1977) (plurality opinion);

rational basis standard, on the other hand, instructs that"a classification `must be upheld against equal protection

challenge if there is any reasonably conceivable state offacts that could provide a rational basis for the classification.' " Heller, supra, at 320 (quoting Beach Communications, supra, at 313). This standard permits a court to
hypothesize interests that might support legislative distinctions, whereas heightened scrutiny limits the realm ofjustification to demonstrable reality.

These different standards of equal protection review alsoset different bars for the magnitude of the governmental interest that justifies the statutory classification. Heightened
scrutiny demands that the governmental interest served by
the classification be "important," see, e. g., Virginia, supra,
at 533, whereas rational basis scrutiny requires only that the
end be "legitimate," see, e. g., Nordlinger v. Hahn, 505 U. S.
1, 10 (1992).

The most important difference between heightened scrutiny and rational basis review, of course, is the required fit
between the means employed and the ends served. Under
heightened scrutiny, the discriminatory means must be
"substantially related" to an actual and important governmental interest. See, e. g., Virginia, supra, at 533. Under
rational basis scrutiny, the means need only be "rationally
related" to a conceivable and legitimate state end. See, e. g.,
Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc., 473 U. S. 432, 440
(1985).

The fact that other means are better suited to the achievement of governmental ends therefore is of no moment under
rational basis review. See, e. g., Vance v. Bradley, 440 U. S.
93, 103, n. 20 (1979) ("Even were it not irrelevant to [rational
basis review] that other alternatives might achieve approximately the same results . . ."); Massachusetts Bd. of Retirement v. Murgia, 427 U. S. 307, 316 (1976) (per curiam)
("[T]he State perhaps has not chosen the best means to accomplish this purpose. But where rationality is the test, a

O'Connor, J., dissenting
State `does not violate the Equal Protection Clause merelybecause the classifications made by its laws are imperfect' "

(quoting Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U. S. 471, 485 (1970))).But because we require a much tighter fit between means
and ends under heightened scrutiny, the availability ofsex-neutral alternatives to a sex-based classification is often
highly probative of the validity of the classification. See,
e. g., Wengler, 446 U. S., at 151 (invalidating a sex-basedclassification where a sex-neutral approach would completely serve the needs of both classes); Orr v. Orr, 440 U. S.268, 281 (1979) (finding "no reason, therefore, to use sex as a
proxy for need" where the alimony statute already pro-vided for individualized hearings that took financial circumstances into account); Wiesenfeld, 420 U. S., at 653 (findinga gender-based distinction to be "gratuitous" where "without it, the statutory scheme would only provide benefits tothose men who are in fact similarly situated to the women
the statute aids"). II

The Court recites the governing substantive standard forheightened scrutiny of sex-based classifications, see ante, at
60-61, 70, but departs from the guidance of our precedentsconcerning such classifications in several ways. In the first
sentence of its equal protection analysis, the majority glossesover the crucial matter of the burden of justification.

Ante,at 60 ("For a gender-based classification to withstand equal

protection scrutiny, it must be established . . ."); see alsoante, at 70. In other circumstances, the Court's use of an
impersonal construction might represent a mere elision ofwhat we have stated expressly in our prior cases. Here,
however, the elision presages some of the larger failings ofthe opinion.

For example, the majority hypothesizes about the in-terests served by the statute and fails adequately to inquire into the actual purposes of $ 1409(a)(4). The Courtalso does not always explain adequately the importance

79Cite as: 533 U. S. 53 (2001)
O'Connor, J., dissenting
of the interests that it claims to be served by the provi-sion. The majority also fails carefully to consider whether

the sex-based classification is being used impermissibly "asa `proxy for other, more germane bases of classification,' "
Mississippi Univ. for Women, 458 U. S., at 726 (quotingCraig, 429 U. S., at 198), and instead casually dismisses the
relevance of available sex-neutral alternatives. And, con-trary to the majority's conclusion, the fit between the means
and ends of $ 1409(a)(4) is far too attenuated for the provisionto survive heightened scrutiny. In all, the majority opinion
represents far less than the rigorous application of height-ened scrutiny that our precedents require.

A
According to the Court, "[t]he first governmental interestto be served is the importance of assuring that a biological

parent-child relationship exists." Ante, at 62. The major-ity does not elaborate on the importance of this interest,
which presumably lies in preventing fraudulent conveyancesof citizenship. Nor does the majority demonstrate that this
is one of the actual purposes of $ 1409(a)(4). Assuming thatCongress actually had this purpose in mind in enacting parts
of $ 1409(a)(4), cf. Miller v. Albright, 523 U. S. 420, 435-436(1998) (opinion of

Stevens, J.), the INS does not appear torely on this interest in its effort to sustain $ 1409(a)(4)'s sexbased classification. Cf. Brief for Respondent 11 (claimingthat $ 1409 serves "at least two important interests: first,
ensuring that children who are born abroad out of wedlockhave, during their minority, attained a sufficiently recognized or formal relationship to their United States citizenparent--and thus to the United States--to justify the conferral of citizenship upon them; and second, preventing suchchildren from being stateless"). In light of the reviewing
court's duty to "determine whether the proffered justifica-tion is `exceedingly persuasive,' "

Virginia, 518 U. S., at 533,this disparity between the majority's defense of the statute

533US1 Unit: $U70 [10-17-02 18:52:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN
80 TUAN ANH NGUYEN v. INS

O'Connor, J., dissenting
and the INS' proffered justifications is striking, to say theleast.

The gravest defect in the Court's reliance on this in-terest, however, is the insufficiency of the fit between

$ 1409(a)(4)'s discriminatory means and the asserted end.Section 1409(c) imposes no particular burden of proof on
mothers wishing to convey citizenship to their children.
By contrast, $ 1409(a)(1), which petitioners do not challengebefore this Court, requires that "a blood relationship between the person and the father [be] established by clearand convincing evidence." Atop $ 1409(a)(1), $ 1409(a)(4)
requires legitimation, an acknowledgment of paternity in
writing under oath, or an adjudication of paternity before
the child reaches the age of 18. It is difficult to see what

$ 1409(a)(4) accomplishes in furtherance of "assuring that a
biological parent-child relationship exists," ante, at 62, that

$ 1409(a)(1) does not achieve on its own. The virtual certainty of a biological link that modern DNA testing affords
reinforces the sufficiency of $ 1409(a)(1). See Miller, supra,
at 484-485 (Breyer, J., dissenting).

It is also difficult to see how $ 1409(a)(4)'s limitation of
the time allowed for obtaining proof of paternity substantially furthers the assurance of a blood relationship. Modern DNA testing, in addition to providing accuracy unmatched by other methods of establishing a biological link,
essentially negates the evidentiary sig nificance of the
passage of time. Moreover, the application of $ 1409(a)(1)'s
"clear and convincing evidence" requirement can account for
any effect that the passage of time has on the quality of the
evidence.

The Court criticizes petitioners' reliance on the availability and sophistication of modern DNA tests, ante, at 63, but
appears to misconceive the relevance of such tests. No one
argues that $ 1409(a)(1) mandates a DNA test. Legitimation or an adjudication of paternity, see $$ 1409(a)(4)(A), (C),
may well satisfy the "clear and convincing" standard of

533US1 Unit: $U70 [10-17-02 18:52:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN

O'Connor, J., dissenting

$ 1409(a)(1). (Satisfaction of $ 1409(a)(4) by a written ac-knowledgment of paternity under oath, see $ 1409(a)(4)(B),

would seem to do little, if anything, to advance the assuranceof a blood relationship, further stretching the means-end
fit in this context.) Likewise, petitioners' argument doesnot depend on the idea that one particular method of establishing paternity is constitutionally required. Petitioners' argument rests instead on the fact that, if the goal is toobtain proof of paternity, the existence of a statutory provision governing such proof, coupled with the efficacy andavailability of modern technology, is highly relevant to the
sufficiency of the tailoring between $ 1409(a)(4)'s sex-based
classification and the asserted end. Because $ 1409(a)(4)
adds little to the work that $ 1409(a)(1) does on its own, it
is difficult to say that $ 1409(a)(4) "substantially furthers"
an important governmental interest. Kirchberg, 450 U. S.,
at 461.

The majority concedes that Congress could achieve the
goal of assuring a biological parent-child relationship in a
sex-neutral fashion, but then, in a surprising turn, dismisses
the availability of sex-neutral alternatives as irrelevant. As
the Court suggests, "Congress could have required both
mothers and fathers to prove parenthood within 30 days or,
for that matter, 18 years, of the child's birth." Ante, at 64
(citing Miller, supra, at 436 (opinion of Stevens, J.)). Indeed, whether one conceives the majority's asserted interest
as assuring the existence of a biological parent-child relationship, ante, at 62, or as ensuring acceptable documentation of that relationship, ante, at 63, a number of sex-neutral
arrangements--including the one that the majority offers--
would better serve that end. As the majority seems implicitly to acknowledge at one point, ante, at 62, a mother will
not always have formal legal documentation of birth because
a birth certificate may not issue or may subsequently be lost.
Conversely, a father's name may well appear on a birth certificate. While it is doubtless true that a mother's blood re533US1 Unit: $U70 [10-17-02 18:52:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN
82 TUAN ANH NGUYEN v. INS

O'Connor, J., dissenting
lation to a child is uniquely "verifiable from the birth itself "to those present at birth,

ibid., the majority has not shown
that a mother's birth relation is uniquely verifiable by the
INS, much less that any greater verifiability warrants a sexbased, rather than a sex-neutral, statute.In our prior cases, the existence of comparable or superior

sex-neutral alternatives has been a powerful reason to reject
a sex-based classification. See supra, at 78. The majority,however, turns this principle on its head by denigrating as

"hollow" the very neutrality that the law requires. Ante, at64. While the majority trumpets the availability of superior
sex-neutral alternatives as confirmation of $ 1409(a)(4)'s validity, our precedents demonstrate that this fact is a decided
strike against the law. Far from being "hollow," the avoidance of gratuitous sex-based distinctions is the hallmark of
equal protection. Cf. J. E. B., 511 U. S., at 152-153 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment) (" `At the heart of the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection lies the simple command that the Government must treat citizens as individuals,
not as simply components of a racial [or] sexual . . . class' "
(quoting Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC, 497 U. S. 547, 602
(1990) (O'Connor, J., dissenting))).

The majority's acknowledgment of the availability of sexneutral alternatives scarcely confirms the point that "[t]he
differential treatment is inherent in a sensible statutory
scheme." Ante, at 64. The discussion instead demonstrates that, at most, differential impact will result from the
fact that "[f]athers and mothers are not similarly situated
with regard to the proof of biological parenthood." Ante, at
63. In other words, it will likely be easier for mothers to
satisfy a sex-neutral proof of parentage requirement. But
facially neutral laws that have a disparate impact are a different animal for purposes of constitutional analysis than
laws that specifically provide for disparate treatment. We
have long held that the differential impact of a facially neutral law does not trigger heightened scrutiny, see, e. g.,

533US1 Unit: $U70 [10-17-02 18:52:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN

83Cite as: 533 U. S. 53 (2001)
O'Connor, J., dissenting
Washington v. Davis, 426 U. S. 229 (1976), whereas we applyheightened scrutiny to laws that facially classify individuals

on the basis of their sex. See, e. g., United States v. Vir-ginia, 518 U. S. 515 (1996); see also J. E. B., supra, at 152
(Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment) ("[O]ur case law doesreveal a strong presumption that gender classifications are
invalid"); Parham v. Hughes, 441 U. S. 347, 351 (1979) (plural-ity opinion) ("Not all legislation, however, is entitled to the
same presumption of validity. . . . [T]he presumption of statu-tory validity may also be undermined when a State has
enacted legislation creating classes based upon certain otherimmutable human attributes" (citing,

inter alia, Reed v.Reed, 404 U. S. 71 (1971))).

If rational basis scrutiny were appropriate in this case,then the claim that "[t]he Constitution . . . does not require
that Congress elect one particular mechanism from amongmany possible methods of establishing paternity," ante, at
63, would have much greater force. So too would the claimthat "[t]he requirement of $ 1409(a)(4) represents a reasonable conclusion . . . ." Ibid. But fidelity to the Con-stitution's pledge of equal protection demands more when a
facially sex-based classification is at issue. This is not be-cause we sit in judgment of the wisdom of laws in one instance but not the other, cf. Beach Communications, 508U. S., at 313, but rather because of the potential for "injury
. . . to personal dignity," J. E. B., supra, at 153 (Kennedy, J.,concurring in judgment), that inheres in or accompanies so
many sex-based classifications.

B
The Court states that "[t]he second important governmen-tal interest furthered in a substantial manner by $ 1409(a)(4)

is the determination to ensure that the child and the citizenparent have some demonstrated opportunity or potential to
develop not just a relationship that is recognized, as a for-mal matter, by the law, but one that consists of the real,

O'Connor, J., dissenting
everyday ties that provide a connection between child andcitizen parent and, in turn, the United States."

Ante, at
64-65. The Court again fails to demonstrate that this wasCongress' actual purpose in enacting $ 1409(a)(4). The majority's focus on "some demonstrated opportunity or poten-tial to develop . . . real, everyday ties" in fact appears to be
the type of hypothesized rationale that is insufficient under
heightened scrutiny. See supra, at 75-77.The INS asserts the governmental interest of "ensuring that children who are born abroad out of wedlock have,during their minority, attained a sufficiently recognized or
formal relationship to their United States citizen parent--
and thus to the United States--to justify the conferral of
citizenship upon them." Brief for Respondent 11. The majority's asserted end, at best, is a simultaneously watereddown and beefed-up version of this interest asserted by the
INS. The majority's rendition is weaker than the INS' in
that it emphasizes the "opportunity or potential to develop"
a relationship rather than the actual relationship about
which the INS claims Congress was concerned. The majority's version is also stronger in that it goes past the formal
relationship apparently desired by the INS to "real, everyday ties."

Assuming, as the majority does, that Congress was actually concerned about ensuring a "demonstrated opportunity"
for a relationship, it is questionable whether such an opportunity qualifies as an "important" governmental interest
apart from the existence of an actual relationship. By focusing on "opportunity" rather than reality, the majority presumably improves the chances of a sufficient means-end fit.
But in doing so, it dilutes significantly the weight of the interest. It is difficult to see how, in this citizenship-conferral
context, anyone profits from a "demonstrated opportunity"
for a relationship in the absence of the fruition of an actual tie. Children who have an "opportunity" for such a tie
with a parent, of course, may never develop an actual rela533US1 Unit: $U70 [10-17-02 18:52:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN

O'Connor, J., dissenting
tionship with that parent. See Miller, 523 U. S., at 440(opinion of

Stevens, J.). If a child grows up in a foreign
country without any postbirth contact with the citizen par-ent, then the child's never-realized "opportunity" for a relationship with the citizen seems singularly irrelevant tothe appropriateness of granting citizenship to that child.
Likewise, where there is an actual relationship, it is the
actual relationship that does all the work in rendering ap-propriate a grant of citizenship, regardless of when and how

the opportunity for that relationship arose.Accepting for the moment the majority's focus on "opportunity," the attempt to justify $ 1409(a)(4) in these terms is
still deficient. Even if it is important "to require that an
opportunity for a parent-child relationship occur during
the formative years of the child's minority," ante, at 68,
it is difficult to see how the requirement that proof of such
opportunity be obtained before the child turns 18 substantially furthers the asserted interest. As the facts of this
case demonstrate, ante, at 57, it is entirely possible that a
father and child will have the opportunity to develop a relationship and in fact will develop a relationship without
obtaining the proof of the opportunity during the child's
minority. After his parents' relationship had ended, petitioner Nguyen lived with the family of his father's new
girlfriend. In 1975, before his sixth birthday, Nguyen came
to the United States, where he was reared by his father,
petitioner Boulais. In 1997, a DNA test showed a 99.98%
probability of paternity, and, in 1998, Boulais obtained an
order of parentage from a Texas court.

Further underscoring the gap between the discriminatory means and the asserted end is the possibility that "a
child might obtain an adjudication of paternity `absent any
affirmative act by the father, and perhaps even over his
express objection.' " Miller, 523 U. S., at 486 (Breyer, J.,
dissenting) (quoting id., at 434 (opinion of Stevens, J.)).
The fact that the means-end fit can break down so readily

533US1 Unit: $U70 [10-17-02 18:52:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN
86 TUAN ANH NGUYEN v. INS

O'Connor, J., dissenting
in theory, and not just in practice, is hardly characteristicof a "substantial" means-end relationship.

Moreover, available sex-neutral alternatives would atleast replicate, and could easily exceed, whatever fit there
is between $ 1409(a)(4)'s discriminatory means and the ma-jority's asserted end. According to the Court, $ 1409(a)(4) is
designed to ensure that fathers and children have the same
"opportunity which the event of birth itself provides for themother and child."

Ante, at 67. Even assuming that this
is so, Congress could simply substitute for $ 1409(a)(4) a re-quirement that the parent be present at birth or have knowledge of birth. Cf. Miller, supra, at 487 (Breyer, J., dissenting). Congress could at least allow proof of such presence
or knowledge to be one way of demonstrating an opportunity for a relationship. Under the present law, the statute
on its face accords different treatment to a mother who is
by nature present at birth and a father who is by choice
present at birth even though those two individuals are
similarly situated with respect to the "opportunity" for a
relationship. The mother can transmit her citizenship at
birth, but the father cannot do so in the absence of at least
one other affirmative act. The different statutory treatment is solely on account of the sex of the similarly situated
individuals. This type of treatment is patently inconsistent
with the promise of equal protection of the laws. See, e. g.,
Reed, 404 U. S., at 77 ("By providing dissimilar treatment
for men and women who are thus similarly situated, the challenged section violates the Equal Protection Clause").

Indeed, the idea that a mother's presence at birth supplies adequate assurance of an opportunity to develop a relationship while a father's presence at birth does not would
appear to rest only on an overbroad sex-based generalization. A mother may not have an opportunity for a relationship if the child is removed from his or her mother
on account of alleged abuse or neglect, or if the child and
mother are separated by tragedy, such as disaster or war,

O'Connor, J., dissenting
of the sort apparently present in this case. There is no reason, other than stereotype, to say that fathers who are
present at birth lack an opportunity for a relationship on
similar terms. The "[p]hysical differences between men and
women," Virginia, 518 U. S., at 533, therefore do not justify

$ 1409(a)(4)'s discrimination.

The majority later ratchets up the interest, for the sake
of argument, to "the establishment of a real, practical relationship of considerable substance between parent and
child in every case, as opposed simply to ensuring the potential for the relationship to begin." Ante, at 70. But the
majority then dismisses the distinction between opportunity
and reality as immaterial to the inquiry in this case. Ibid.
The majority rests its analysis of the means-end fit largely
on the following proposition: "It is almost axiomatic that a
policy which seeks to foster the opportunity for meaningful
parent-child bonds to develop has a close and substantial
bearing on the governmental interest in the actual formation
of that bond." Ibid. A bare assertion of what is allegedly
"almost axiomatic," however, is no substitute for the "demanding" burden of justification borne by the defender of
the classification. Virginia, supra, at 533.

Moreover, the Court's reasoning hardly conforms to the
tailoring requirement of heightened scrutiny. The fact that
a discriminatory policy embodies the good intention of "seek[ing] to foster" the opportunity for something beneficial to
happen is of little relevance in itself to whether the policy
substantially furthers the desired occurrence. Whether the
classification indeed "has a close and substantial bearing"
on the actual occurrence of the preferred result depends on
facts and circumstances and must be proved by the classification's defender. Far from being a virtual axiom, the relationship between the intent to foster an opportunity and
the fruition of the desired effect is merely a contingent
proposition. The majority's sweeping claim is no surrogate

O'Connor, J., dissenting
for the careful application of heightened scrutiny to a par-ticular classification.

The question that then remains is the sufficiency of thefit between $ 1409(a)(4)'s discriminatory means and the goal
of "establish[ing] . . . a real, practical relationship of con-siderable substance."

Ante, at 70. If Congress wishes to
advance this end, it could easily do so by employing a
sex-neutral classification that is a far "more germane bas[i]sof classification" than sex,

Craig, 429 U. S., at 198. For
example, Congress could require some degree of regularcontact between the child and the citizen parent over a

period of time. See Miller, 523 U. S., at 470 (Ginsburg,
J., dissenting).

The majority again raises this possibility of the use of
sex-neutral means only to dismiss it as irrelevant. The
Court admits that "Congress could excuse compliance with
the formal requirements when an actual father-child relationship is proved," but speculates that Congress did not
do so "perhaps because of the subjectivity, intrusiveness,
and difficulties of proof that might attend an inquiry into any
particular bond or tie." Ante, at 69. We have repeatedly
rejected efforts to justify sex-based classifications on the
ground of administrative convenience. See, e. g., Wengler,
446 U. S., at 152; Frontiero, 411 U. S., at 690-691. There is
no reason to think that this is a case where administrative
convenience concerns are so powerful that they would justify
the sex-based discrimination, cf. Wengler, supra, at 152,
especially where the use of sex as a proxy is so ill fit to the
purported ends as it is here. And to the extent Congress
might seek simply to ensure an "opportunity" for a relationship, little administrative inconvenience would seem to
accompany a sex-neutral requirement of presence at birth,
knowledge of birth, or contact between parent and child
prior to a certain age.

The claim that $ 1409(a)(4) substantially relates to the
achievement of the goal of a "real, practical relationship"

thus finds support not in biological differences but insteadin a stereotype--

i. e., "the generalization that mothers are
significantly more likely than fathers . . . to develop caringrelationships with their children."

Miller, supra, at 482-
483 (Breyer, J., dissenting). Such a claim relies on "thevery stereotype the law condemns,"

J. E. B., 511 U. S., at
138 (internal quotation marks omitted), "lends credibility"
to the generalization, Mississippi Univ. for Women, 458U. S., at 730, and helps to convert that "assumption" into

"a self-fulfilling prophecy," ibid. See also J. E. B., supra,at 140 ("When state actors exercise peremptory challenges
in reliance on gender stereotypes, they ratify and reinforce
prejudicial views of the relative abilities of men and
women"). Indeed, contrary to this stereotype, Boulais has
reared Nguyen, while Nguyen apparently has lacked a relationship with his mother.

The majority apparently tries to avoid reliance on this
stereotype by characterizing the governmental interest as a
"demonstrated opportunity" for a relationship and attempting to close the gap between opportunity and reality with a
dubious claim about what is "almost axiomatic." But the
fact that one route is wisely forgone does not mean that
the other is plausibly taken. The inescapable conclusion instead is that $ 1409(a)(4) lacks an exceedingly persuasive
justification.

In denying petitioner's claim that $ 1409(a)(4) rests on
stereotypes, the majority articulates a misshapen notion of
"stereotype" and its significance in our equal protection
jurisprudence. The majority asserts that a "stereotype" is
"defined as a frame of mind resulting from irrational or
uncritical analysis." Ante, at 68. This Court has long recognized, however, that an impermissible stereotype may
enjoy empirical support and thus be in a sense "rational."
See, e. g., J. E. B., supra, at 139, n. 11 ("We have made abundantly clear in past cases that gender classifications that rest
on impermissible stereotypes violate the Equal Protection

Clause, even when some statistical support can be conjuredup for the generalization");

Craig, 429 U. S., at 201 (invalidating a sex-based classification even though the evidencesupporting the distinction was "not trivial in a statistical

sense"); id., at 202 (noting that "prior cases have consistentlyrejected the use of sex as a decisionmaking factor even
though the statutes in question certainly rested on far more
predictive empirical relationships than this"); Wiesenfeld,420 U. S., at 645 (invalidating a sex-based classification even

though the underlying generalization was "not entirely with-out empirical support"). Indeed, the stereotypes that underlie a sex-based classification "may hold true for many,
even most, individuals." Miller, 523 U. S., at 460 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting). But in numerous cases where a measure of truth has inhered in the generalization, "the Court
has rejected official actions that classify unnecessarily and
overbroadly by gender when more accurate and impartial
functional lines can be drawn." Ibid.

Nor do stereotypes consist only of those overbroad generalizations that the reviewing court considers to "show
disrespect" for a class, ante, at 73. Cf., e. g., Craig, supra,
at 198-201. The hallmark of a stereotypical sex-based classification under this Court's precedents is not whether the
classification is insulting, but whether it "relie[s] upon the
simplistic, outdated assumption that gender could be used as
a `proxy for other, more germane bases of classification.' "
Mississippi Univ. for Women, supra, at 726 (quoting Craig,
supra, at 198).

It is also important to note that, while our explanations
of many decisions invalidating sex-based classifications have
pointed to the problems of "stereotypes" and "overbroad
generalizations," these explanations certainly do not mean
that the burden is on the challenger of the classification to
prove legislative reliance on such generalizations. Indeed,
an arbitrary distinction between the sexes may rely on no
identifiable generalization at all but may simply be a de533US1 Unit: $U70 [10-17-02 18:52:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN

violation. The burden of proving that use of a sex-basedclassification substantially relates to the achievement of an
important governmental interest remains unmistakably andentirely with the classification's defender. See, e. g., Virginia, 518 U. S., at 532-533.

C
The Court has also failed even to acknowledge the "vol-umes of history" to which "[t]oday's skeptical scrutiny of

official action denying rights or opportunities based on sexresponds." Id., at 531. The history of sex discrimination
in laws governing the transmission of citizenship and withrespect to parental responsibilities for children born out of
wedlock counsels at least some circumspection in discerninglegislative purposes in this context. See generally Miller,
supra, at 460-468 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting).Section 1409 was first enacted as $ 205 of the Nationality
Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 1139-1140. The 1940 Act had beenproposed by the President, forwarding a report by a specially convened Committee of Advisors, including the At-torney General. The Committee explained to Congress the
rationale for $ 205, whose sex-based classification remains ineffect today:

"[T]he Department of State has, at least since 1912,uniformly held that an illegitimate child born abroad
of an American mother acquires at birth the national-ity of the mother, in the absence of legitimation or adjudication establishing the paternity of the child. Thisruling is based . . . on the ground that the mother in
such case stands in the place of the father. . . . [U]nderAmerican law the mother has a right to custody and
control of such a child as against the putative father, and
is bound to maintain it as its natural guardian. Thisrule seems to be in accord with the old Roman law and

with the laws of Spain and France." To Revise andCodify the Nationality Laws of the United States, Hearings on H. R. 6127 before the House Committee on Im-migration and Naturalization, 76th Cong., 1st Sess., 431
(1945) (reprinting Message from the President, Nation-ality Laws of the United States (1938)) (emphasis added
and internal quotation marks and citations omitted).
Section 1409(a)(4) is thus paradigmatic of a historic re-gime that left women with responsibility, and freed men

from responsibility, for nonmarital children. Under this law,as one advocate explained to Congress in a 1932 plea for a
sex-neutral citizenship law, "when it comes to the illegiti-mate child, which is a great burden, then the mother is
the only recognized parent, and the father is put safely inthe background." Naturalization and Citizenship Status of

on Immigration and Naturalization, 72d Cong., 1st Sess., 3(testimony of Burnita Shelton Matthews); see also id., at 5
(citizenship law "permit[s] [the father] to escape the burdensincident to illegitimate parenthood"). Unlike $ 1409(a)(4),
our States' child custody and support laws no longer assumethat mothers alone are "bound" to serve as "natural guardians" of nonmarital children. See, e. g., Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann.$ 25-501 (1999) (equal duties of support); cf. Cal. Civ. Code
Ann. $ 4600 (West 1972) (abolishing "tender years" doctrine).The majority, however, rather than confronting the stereotypical notion that mothers must care for these children andfathers may ignore them, quietly condones the "very stereotype the law condemns," J. E. B., 511 U. S., at 138 (internalquotation marks omitted).

Punctuating the disparity between the majority's and theINS' accounts of the governmental interests at stake is the
majority's failure even to address the INS' second assertedrationale: that $ 1409 prevents certain children from being
stateless. Brief for Respondent 11; see also id., at 17-18

(describing statelessness problem). The Court certainly hasgood reason to reject this asserted rationale. Indeed, the

INS hardly even attempts to show how the statelessnessconcern justifies the discriminatory means of $ 1409(a)(4) in
particular. The INS instead undertakes a demonstrationof how the statelessness concern justifies $ 1409(c)'s relaxed
residency requirements for citizen mothers. See id., at 17-
19, 42-43, 44, n. 23. But petitioners do not challenge herethe distinction between $ 1401(g), which requires that citizen

fathers have previously resided in the United States for fiveyears, including at least two years after the age of 14, and

$ 1409(c), which provides that a citizen mother need only
have resided in the United States for one year. The INS'
proffered justification of statelessness thus does nothing to
buttress the case for $ 1409(a)(4).

The Court also makes a number of observations that tend,
on the whole, to detract and distract from the relevant equal
protection inquiry. For example, presumably referring to

$ 1409 in general, the majority suggests that "the statute
simply ensures equivalence between two expectant mothers
who are citizens abroad if one chooses to reenter for the
child's birth and the other chooses not to return, or does not
have the means to do so." Ante, at 61. But even apart
from the question whether this was one of Congress' actual
purposes (and the majority does not affirmatively claim that
it was), this equivalence is quite beside the point of petitioners' constitutional challenge, which is directed at the dissimilar treatment accorded to fathers and mothers.

The Court also states that the obligation imposed by

$ 1409(a)(4) is "minimal" and does not present "inordinate
and unnecessary hurdles" to the acquisition of citizenship
by the nonmarital child of a citizen father. Ante, at 70.
Even assuming that the burden is minimal (and the question
whether the hurdle is "unnecessary" is quite different in kind
from the question whether it is burdensome), it is well settled that "the `absence of an insurmountable barrier' will not

redeem an otherwise unconstitutionally discriminatory law."Kirchberg, 450 U. S., at 461 (quoting Trimble v. Gordon, 430

U. S. 762, 774 (1977)).Finally, while the recitation of statistics concerning military personnel and overseas travel, ante, at 65-66, highlightsthe opportunities for United States citizens to interact with
citizens of foreign countries, it bears little on the questionwhether $ 1409(a)(4)'s

discriminatory means are a permissi-ble governmental response to those circumstances. Indeed,

the majority's discussion may itself simply reflect the stereo-type of male irresponsibility that is no more a basis for the
validity of the classification than are stereotypes about the"traditional" behavior patterns of women.

It is, of course, true that the failure to recognize rele-vant differences is out of line with the command of equal
protection. See ante, at 73. But so too do we underminethe promise of equal protection when we try to make our
differences carry weight they simply cannot bear. Thispromise informs the proper application of heightened scrutiny to sex-based classifications and demands our scrupulousadherence to that test.

III
The Court identifies two "additional obstacles" that peti-tioners would face even were the Court to accept the conclusion that the statute fails heightened scrutiny. Ante, at71. The first question concerns " `potential problems with
fashioning a remedy.' " Ante, at 72 (quoting Miller, 523U. S., at 451 (O'C

onnor, J., concurring in judgment) (citing
id., at 452-459 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment))). Thesecond question concerns "the implications of statements in

our earlier cases regarding the wide deference afforded toCongress in the exercise of its immigration and naturalization power." Ante, at 72-73. I believe that petitioners areable to surmount both of these hurdles.

As to the matter of remedy, severance of $ 1409(a)(4) wouldhave been appropriate had petitioners prevailed. Several

O'Connor, J., dissenting
factors support this conclusion. The Immigration and Na-tionality Act (INA) contains a general severability clause,

which provides: "If any particular provision of this Act,or the application thereof to any person or circumstance,
is held invalid, the remainder of the Act and the applicationof such provision to other persons or circumstances shall not
be affected thereby." $ 406, 66 Stat. 281; see note following
8 U. S. C. $ 1101, p. 38, "Separability." We have concludedthat this severability clause "is unambiguous and gives rise

to a presumption that Congress did not intend the validityof the [INA] as a whole, or any part of the [INA], to depend
upon whether" any one provision was unconstitutional.
INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919, 932 (1983).

Title 8 U. S. C. $ 1421(d), which states that "[a] person may
only be naturalized as a citizen of the United States in the
manner and under the conditions prescribed in this subchapter and not otherwise," has no effect on the operation
of the INA's general severability clause in this case. Section
1421(d) governs only naturalization, which the statute defines as "the conferring of nationality of a state upon a person after birth," $ 1101(a)(23), whereas $$ 1401(g) and 1409
deal with the transmission of citizenship at birth, see $ 1401
("The following shall be nationals and citizens of the United
States at birth . . ."). Further, unlike the INA's general
severability clause, $ 1421(d) does not specifically address
the scenario where a particular provision is held invalid.
Indeed, the INS does not even rely on $ 1421(d) in its brief.

Nor does our decision in INS v. Pangilinan, 486 U. S. 875
(1988), preclude severance here. In Pangilinan, this Court
held that courts lack equitable authority to order the naturalization of persons who did not satisfy the statutory requirements for naturalization. Id., at 883-885. Petitioners
in the instant case, however, seek the exercise of no such
equitable power. Petitioners instead seek severance of the
offending provisions so that the statute, free of its constitutional defect, can operate to determine whether citizen533US1 Unit: $U70 [10-17-02 18:52:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ship was transmitted at birth. Cf. Miller, supra, at 488-489(

Breyer, J., dissenting).

In addition to the severance clause, this Court has oftenconcluded that, in the absence of legislative direction

not
to sever the infirm provision, "extension, rather than nul-lification," of a benefit is more faithful to the legislative design. Califano v. Westcott, 443 U. S. 76, 89-90 (1979); see
also Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U. S. 636 (1975); Frontiero, 411 U. S., at 691, n. 25. The choice of extension over
nullification also would have the virtue of avoiding injury toparties who are not represented in the instant litigation.

And Congress, of course, remains free to redesign the statute in a manner that comports with the Constitution.

As to the question of deference, the pivotal case is Fiallo
v. Bell, 430 U. S. 787 (1977). Fiallo, however, is readily
distinguished. Fiallo involved constitutional challenges to
various statutory distinctions, including a classification
based on the sex of a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident, that determined the availability of a special
immigration preference to certain aliens by virtue of their
relationship with the citizen or lawful permanent resident.
Id., at 788-792; see also Miller, supra, at 429 (opinion of
Stevens, J.). The Court, emphasizing "the limited scope
of judicial inquiry into immigration legislation," 430 U. S.,
at 792, rejected the constitutional challenges. The Court
noted its repeated prior emphasis that " `over no conceivable subject is the legislative power of Congress more complete than it is over' the admission of aliens." Ibid. (quoting Oceanic Steam Nav. Co. v. Stranahan, 214 U. S. 320,
339 (1909)).

The instant case is not about the admission of aliens but
instead concerns the logically prior question whether an individual is a citizen in the first place. A predicate for application of the deference commanded by Fiallo is that the
individuals concerned be aliens. But whether that predicate
obtains is the very matter at issue in this case. Cf. Miller,

O'Connor, J., dissenting
523 U. S., at 433, n. 10 (opinion of Stevens, J.) ("[T]he Gov-ernment now argues . . . that an alien outside the territory

of the United States has no substantive rights cognizableunder the Fifth Amendment. Even if that is so, the question to be decided is whether petitioner is such an alienor whether, as [petitioner] claims, [petitioner] is a citizen.
Thus, we must address the merits to determine whetherthe predicate for this argument is accurate" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). Because $$ 1401 and 1409govern the conferral of citizenship at birth, and not the admission of aliens, the ordinary standards of equal protectionreview apply. See

id., at 480-481 (Breyer, J., dissenting).

* * *
No one should mistake the majority's analysis for a carefulapplication of this Court's equal protection jurisprudence

concerning sex-based classifications. Today's decision in-stead represents a deviation from a line of cases in which we
have vigilantly applied heightened scrutiny to such classifi-cations to determine whether a constitutional violation has
occurred. I trust that the depth and vitality of these prece-dents will ensure that today's error remains an aberration.
I respectfully dissent.

GOOD NEWS CLUB et al. v. MILFORDCENTRAL SCHOOL
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe second circuit

No. 99-2036. Argued February 28, 2001--Decided June 11, 2001
Under New York law, respondent Milford Central School (Milford) enacted

a policy authorizing district residents to use its building after school
for, among other things, (1) instruction in education, learning, or the
arts and (2) social, civic, recreational, and entertainment uses pertaining to the community welfare. Stephen and Darleen Fournier, district
residents eligible to use the school's facilities upon approval of their
proposed use, are sponsors of the Good News Club, a private Christian
organization for children ages 6 to 12. Pursuant to Milford's policy,
they submitted a request to hold the Club's weekly afterschool meetings in the school. Milford denied the request on the ground that the
proposed use--to sing songs, hear Bible lessons, memorize scripture,
and pray--was the equivalent of religious worship prohibited by the
community use policy. Petitioners (collectively, the Club), filed suit
under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, alleging, inter alia, that the denial of the Club's
application violated its free speech rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The District Court ultimately granted Milford
summary judgment, finding the Club's subject matter to be religious
in nature, not merely a discussion of secular matters from a religious
perspective that Milford otherwise permits. Because the school had
not allowed other groups providing religious instruction to use its
limited public forum, the court held that it could deny the Club access without engaging in unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination.
In affirming, the Second Circuit rejected the Club's contention that
Milford's restriction was unreasonable, and held that, because the Club's
subject matter was quintessentially religious and its activities fell
outside the bounds of pure moral and character development, Milford's
policy was constitutional subject discrimination, not unconstitutional
viewpoint discrimination.

Held:

1. Milford violated the Club's free speech rights when it excluded the
Club from meeting after hours at the school. Pp. 106-112.

(a) Because the parties so agree, this Court assumes that Milford
operates a limited public forum. A State establishing such a forum is
not required to and does not allow persons to engage in every type of

Syllabus
speech. It may be justified in reserving its forum for certain groups
or the discussion of certain topics. E. g., Rosenberger v. Rector and
Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819, 829. The power to so restrict
speech, however, is not without limits. The restriction must not discriminate against speech based on viewpoint, ibid., and must be reasonable in light of the forum's purpose, Cornelius v. NAACP Legal
Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U. S. 788, 806. Pp. 106-107.

(b) By denying the Club access to the school's limited public forum
on the ground that the Club was religious in nature, Milford discriminated against the Club because of its religious viewpoint in violation
of the Free Speech Clause. That exclusion is indistinguishable from
the exclusions held violative of the Clause in Lamb's Chapel v. Center
Moriches Union Free School Dist., 508 U. S. 384, where a school district
precluded a private group from presenting films at the school based
solely on the religious perspective of the films, and in Rosenberger,
where a university refused to fund a student publication because it
addressed issues from a religious perspective. The only apparent difference between the activities of Lamb's Chapel and the Club is the
inconsequential distinction that the Club teaches moral lessons from a
Christian perspective through live storytelling and prayer, whereas
Lamb's Chapel taught lessons through films. Rosenberger also is dispositive: Given the obvious religious content of the publication there
at issue, it cannot be said that the Club's activities are any more
"religious" or deserve any less Free Speech Clause protection. This
Court disagrees with the Second Circuit's view that something that
is quintessentially religious or decidedly religious in nature cannot
also be characterized properly as the teaching of morals and character development from a particular viewpoint. What matters for Free
Speech Clause purposes is that there is no logical difference in kind
between the invocation of Christianity by the Club and the invocation
of teamwork, loyalty, or patriotism by other associations to provide a
foundation for their lessons. Because Milford's restriction is viewpoint
discriminatory, the Court need not decide whether it is unreasonable
in light of the forum's purposes. Pp. 107-112.

2. Permitting the Club to meet on the school's premises would not
have violated the Establishment Clause. Establishment Clause defenses similar to Milford's were rejected in Lamb's Chapel, supra, at
395--where the Court found that, because the films would not have been
shown during school hours, would not have been sponsored by the
school, and would have been open to the public, not just to church
members, there was no realistic danger that the community would
think that the district was endorsing religion--and in Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S. 263, 272-273, and n. 13--where a university's forum was

100 GOOD NEWS CLUB v. MILFORD CENTRAL SCHOOL

Syllabus
already available to other groups. Because the Club's activities are
materially indistinguishable from those in Lamb's Chapel and Widmar,
Milford's reliance on the Establishment Clause is unavailing. As in
Lamb's Chapel, the Club's meetings were to be held after school hours,
not sponsored by the school, and open to any student who obtained parental consent, not just to Club members. As in Widmar, Milford made
its forum available to other organizations. The Court rejects Milford's
attempt to distinguish those cases by emphasizing that its policy involves elementary school children who will perceive that the school
is endorsing the Club and will feel coerced to participate because the
Club's activities take place on school grounds, even though they occur
during nonschool hours. That argument is unpersuasive for a number
of reasons. (1) Allowing the Club to speak on school grounds would
ensure, not threaten, neutrality toward religion. Accordingly, Milford faces an uphill battle in arguing that the Establishment Clause
compels it to exclude the Club. See, e. g., Rosenberger, supra, at 839.
(2) To the extent the Court considers whether the community would feel
coercive pressure to engage in the Club's activities, cf. Lee v. Weisman,
505 U. S. 577, 592-593, the relevant community is the parents who
choose whether their children will attend Club meetings, not the children themselves. (3) Whatever significance it may have assigned in
the Establishment Clause context to the suggestion that elementary
school children are more impressionable than adults, cf., e. g., id., at
592, the Court has never foreclosed private religious conduct during
nonschool hours merely because it takes place on school premises where
elementary school children may be present. Lee, supra, at 592, and
Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 U. S. 578, 584, distinguished. (4) Even if
the Court were to consider the possible misperceptions by schoolchildren in deciding whether there is an Establishment Clause violation, the facts of this case simply do not support Milford's conclusion.
Finally, it cannot be said that the danger that children would misperceive the endorsement of religion is any greater than the danger
that they would perceive a hostility toward the religious viewpoint
if the Club were excluded from the public forum. Because it is not
convinced that there is any significance to the possibility that elementary school children may witness the Club's activities on school
premises, the Court can find no reason to depart from Lamb's Chapel
and Widmar. Pp. 112-119.

3. Because Milford has not raised a valid Establishment Clause claim,
this Court does not address whether such a claim could excuse Milford's
viewpoint discrimination. Pp. 113, 120.

102 GOOD NEWS CLUB v. MILFORD CENTRAL SCHOOL

Opinion of the Court
Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case presents two questions. The first question is
whether Milford Central School violated the free speech
rights of the Good News Club when it excluded the Club
from meeting after hours at the school. The second question is whether any such violation is justified by Milford's
concern that permitting the Club's activities would violate
the Establishment Clause. We conclude that Milford's restriction violates the Club's free speech rights and that no
Establishment Clause concern justifies that violation.

I
The State of New York authorizes local school boards
to adopt regulations governing the use of their school facilities. In particular, N. Y. Educ. Law $ 414 (McKinney 2000)
enumerates several purposes for which local boards may
open their schools to public use. In 1992, respondent Milford Central School (Milford) enacted a community use policy
adopting seven of $ 414's purposes for which its building
could be used after school. App. to Pet. for Cert. D1-D3.
Two of the stated purposes are relevant here. First, district
residents may use the school for "instruction in any branch
of education, learning or the arts." Id., at D1. Second, the
school is available for "social, civic and recreational meetings
and entertainment events, and other uses pertaining to the
welfare of the community, provided that such uses shall
be nonexclusive and shall be opened to the general public."

Opinion of the Court
Stephen and Darleen Fournier reside within Milford's dis-trict and therefore are eligible to use the school's facilities

as long as their proposed use is approved by the school.Together they are sponsors of the local Good News Club,
a private Christian organization for children ages 6 to 12.Pursuant to Milford's policy, in September 1996 the Fourniers submitted a request to Dr. Robert McGruder, interim
superintendent of the district, in which they sought per-mission to hold the Club's weekly afterschool meetings in

the school cafeteria. App. in No. 98-9494 (CA2), p. A-81.The next month, McGruder formally denied the Fourniers'
request on the ground that the proposed use--to have "a funtime of singing songs, hearing a Bible lesson and memorizing
scripture," ibid.--was "the equivalent of religious worship."App. H1-H2. According to McGruder, the community use
policy, which prohibits use "by any individual or organiza-tion for religious purposes," foreclosed the Club's activities.
App. to Pet. for Cert. D2.In response to a letter submitted by the Club's counsel,
Milford's attorney requested information to clarify the nature of the Club's activities. The Club sent a set of ma-terials used or distributed at the meetings and the following

description of its meeting:

"The Club opens its session with Ms. Fournier taking
attendance. As she calls a child's name, if the childrecites a Bible verse the child receives a treat. After

attendance, the Club sings songs. Next Club mem-bers engage in games that involve,

inter alia, learning
Bible verses. Ms. Fournier then relates a Bible story
and explains how it applies to Club members' lives.
The Club closes with prayer. Finally, Ms. Fournier distributes treats and the Bible verses for memorization."
App. in No. 98-9494 (CA2), at A-30.

McGruder and Milford's attorney reviewed the materials
and concluded that "the kinds of activities proposed to be

engaged in by the Good News Club were not a discussionof secular subjects such as child rearing, development of

character and development of morals from a religious per-spective, but were in fact the equivalent of religious instruction itself." Id., at A-25. In February 1997, the Mil-ford Board of Education adopted a resolution rejecting the
Club's request to use Milford's facilities "for the purposeof conducting religious instruction and Bible study."

Club), filed an action under Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C.$ 1983, against Milford in the United States District Court
for the Northern District of New York. The Club allegedthat Milford's denial of its application violated its free speech
rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, itsright to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment,
and its right to religious freedom under the ReligiousFreedom Restoration Act of 1993, 107 Stat. 1488, 42 U. S. C.

$ 2000bb et seq.1The Club moved for a preliminary injunction to prevent
the school from enforcing its religious exclusion policyagainst the Club and thereby to permit the Club's use of
the school facilities. On April 14, 1997, the District Courtgranted the injunction. The Club then held its weekly
afterschool meetings from April 1997 until June 1998 in ahigh school resource and middle school special education
room. App. N12.In August 1998, the District Court vacated the preliminary injunction and granted Milford's motion for summaryjudgment. 21 F. Supp. 2d 147 (NDNY 1998). The court
found that the Club's "subject matter is decidedly religiousin nature, and not merely a discussion of secular matters

Freedom Restoration Act because we held the Act to be unconstitutional

from a religious perspective that is otherwise permittedunder [Milford's] use policies."

Id., at 154. Because the
school had not permitted other groups that provided reli-gious instruction to use its limited public forum, the court

held that the school could deny access to the Club with-out engaging in unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination.
The court also rejected the Club's equal protection claim.

The Club appealed, and a divided panel of the UnitedStates Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed.

202 F. 3d 502 (2000). First, the court rejected the Club'scontention that Milford's restriction against allowing religious instruction in its facilities is unreasonable. Second,it held that, because the subject matter of the Club's activities is "quintessentially religious," id., at 510, and theactivities "fall outside the bounds of pure `moral and character development,' " id., at 511, Milford's policy of excludingthe Club's meetings was constitutional subject discrimination, not unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination. JudgeJacobs filed a dissenting opinion in which he concluded that
the school's restriction did constitute viewpoint discrimination under Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free
School Dist., 508 U. S. 384 (1993).

There is a conflict among the Courts of Appeals on thequestion whether speech can be excluded from a limited public forum on the basis of the religious nature of the speech.Compare

unconstitutional a school use policy that prohibited GoodNews Club from meeting during times when the Boy Scouts

II
The standards that we apply to determine whether a Statehas unconstitutionally excluded a private speaker from use

of a public forum depend on the nature of the forum. SeePerry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn., 460 U. S.
37, 44 (1983). If the forum is a traditional or open pub-lic forum, the State's restrictions on speech are subject to
stricter scrutiny than are restrictions in a limited publicforum. Id., at 45-46. We have previously declined to decide whether a school district's opening of its facilities pur-suant to N. Y. Educ. Law $ 414 creates a limited or a traditional public forum. See Lamb's Chapel, supra, at 391-392.Because the parties have agreed that Milford created a limited public forum when it opened its facilities in 1992, seeBrief for Petitioners 15-17; Brief for Respondent 26, we need
not resolve the issue here. Instead, we simply will assumethat Milford operates a limited public forum.

When the State establishes a limited public forum, theState is not required to and does not allow persons to engage in every type of speech. The State may be justified"in reserving [its forum] for certain groups or for the discussion of certain topics." Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors
of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819, 829 (1995); see also Lamb'sChapel, supra, at 392-393. The State's power to restrict

speech, however, is not without limits. The restriction mustnot discriminate against speech on the basis of viewpoint,

Opinion of the Court
Rosenberger, supra, at 829, and the restriction must be "rea-sonable in light of the purpose served by the forum," Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U. S.788, 806 (1985).

III
Applying this test, we first address whether the exclu-sion constituted viewpoint discrimination. We are guided

in our analysis by two of our prior opinions, Lamb's Chapeland

Rosenberger. In Lamb's Chapel, we held that a schooldistrict violated the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment when it excluded a private group from presenting filmsat the school based solely on the films' discussions of family
values from a religious perspective. Likewise, in Rosenberger, we held that a university's refusal to fund a studentpublication because the publication addressed issues from

a religious perspective violated the Free Speech Clause.Concluding that Milford's exclusion of the Good News Club
based on its religious nature is indistinguishable from theexclusions in these cases, we hold that the exclusion constitutes viewpoint discrimination. Because the restrictionis viewpoint discriminatory, we need not decide whether

it is unreasonable in light of the purposes served by theforum.

2 Although Milford argued below that, under $ 414, it could not permit
its property to be used for the purpose of religious activity, see Brief
for Appellee in No. 98-9494 (CA2), p. 12, here it merely asserts in one
sentence that it has, "in accordance with state law, closed [its] limited
open forum to purely religious instruction and services," Brief for Respondent 27. Because Milford does not elaborate, it is difficult to discern whether it is arguing that it is required by state law to exclude the
Club's activities.

Before the Court of Appeals, Milford cited Trietley v. Board of Ed.
of Buffalo, 65 App. Div. 2d 1, 409 N. Y. S. 2d 912 (1978), in which a New
York court held that a local school district could not permit a student
Bible club to meet on school property because "[r]eligious purposes are
not included in the enumerated purposes for which a school may be used
under section 414 of the Education Law." Id., at 5-6, 409 N. Y. S. 2d,

533US1 Unit: $U71 [10-17-02 19:00:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN
108 GOOD NEWS CLUB v. MILFORD CENTRAL SCHOOL

Opinion of the Court
Milford has opened its limited public forum to activities
that serve a variety of purposes, including events "pertaining to the welfare of the community." App. to Pet. for
Cert. D1. Milford interprets its policy to permit discussions of subjects such as child rearing, and of "the development of character and morals from a religious perspective." Brief for Appellee in No. 98-9494 (CA2), p. 6.
For example, this policy would allow someone to use Aesop's
Fables to teach children moral values. App. N11. Additionally, a group could sponsor a debate on whether there
should be a constitutional amendment to permit prayer in
public schools, id., at N6, and the Boy Scouts could meet
"to influence a boy's character, development and spiritual
growth," id., at N10-N11. In short, any group that "promote[s] the moral and character development of children"
is eligible to use the school building. Brief for Appellee in
No. 98-9494 (CA2), at 9.

Just as there is no question that teaching morals and
character development to children is a permissible purpose under Milford's policy, it is clear that the Club teaches
morals and character development to children. For example, no one disputes that the Club instructs children to overcome feelings of jealousy, to treat others well regardless
of how they treat the children, and to be obedient, even if
it does so in a nonsecular way. Nonetheless, because Milford found the Club's activities to be religious in nature--
"the equivalent of religious instruction itself," 202 F. 3d,
at 507--it excluded the Club from use of its facilities.

at 915. Although the court conceded that the Bible clubs might provide
incidental secular benefits, it nonetheless concluded that the school would
have violated the Establishment Clause had it permitted the club's activities on campus. Because we hold that the exclusion of the Club on the
basis of its religious perspective constitutes unconstitutional viewpoint
discrimination, it is no defense for Milford that purely religious purposes
can be excluded under state law.

Opinion of the Court
Applying Lamb's Chapel,3 we find it quite clear that Mil-ford engaged in viewpoint discrimination when it excluded

the Club from the afterschool forum. In Lamb's Chapel, thelocal New York school district similarly had adopted $ 414's
"social, civic or recreational use" category as a permitted usein its limited public forum. The district also prohibited use
"by any group for religious purposes." 508 U. S., at 387.Citing this prohibition, the school district excluded a church
that wanted to present films teaching family values from aChristian perspective. We held that, because the films "no
doubt dealt with a subject otherwise permissible" under therule, the teaching of family values, the district's exclusion
of the church was unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination.
Id., at 394.Like the church in Lamb's Chapel, the Club seeks to

address a subject otherwise permitted under the rule, theteaching of morals and character, from a religious standpoint. Certainly, one could have characterized the film pre-sentations in

Lamb's Chapel as a religious use, as the Courtof Appeals did, Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union

Free School Dist., 959 F. 2d 381, 388-389 (CA2 1992). Andone easily could conclude that the films' purpose to instruct
that " `society's slide toward humanism . . . can only becounterbalanced by a loving home where Christian values
are instilled from an early age,' " id., at 384, was "quintessen-tially religious," 202 F. 3d, at 510. The only apparent dif3 We find it remarkable that the Court of Appeals majority did not
cite Lamb's Chapel, despite its obvious relevance to the case. We do not
necessarily expect a court of appeals to catalog every opinion that reverses one of its precedents. Nonetheless, this oversight is particularly
incredible because the majority's attention was directed to it at every turn.
See, e. g., 202 F. 3d 502, 513 (CA2 2000) (Jacobs, J., dissenting) ("I cannot
square the majority's analysis in this case with Lamb's Chapel"); 21 F.
Supp. 2d, at 150; App. O9-O11 (District Court stating "that Lamb's Chapel
and Rosenberger pinpoint the critical issue in this case"); Brief for Appellee in No. 98-9494 (CA2), at 36-39; Brief for Appellants in No. 98-9494
(CA2), pp. 15, 36.

110 GOOD NEWS CLUB v. MILFORD CENTRAL SCHOOL

Opinion of the Court
ference between the activity of Lamb's Chapel and the activities of the Good News Club is that the Club chooses to
teach moral lessons from a Christian perspective through
live storytelling and prayer, whereas Lamb's Chapel taught
lessons through films. This distinction is inconsequential.
Both modes of speech use a religious viewpoint. Thus, the
exclusion of the Good News Club's activities, like the exclusion of Lamb's Chapel's films, constitutes unconstitutional
viewpoint discrimination.

Our opinion in Rosenberger also is dispositive. In Rosenberger, a student organization at the University of Virginia
was denied funding for printing expenses because its publication, Wide Awake, offered a Christian viewpoint. Just as
the Club emphasizes the role of Christianity in students'
morals and character, Wide Awake " `challenge[d] Christians
to live, in word and deed, according to the faith they proclaim
and . . . encourage[d] students to consider what a personal
relationship with Jesus Christ means.' " 515 U. S., at 826.
Because the university "select[ed] for disfavored treatment
those student journalistic efforts with religious editorial
viewpoints," we held that the denial of funding was unconstitutional. Id., at 831. Although in Rosenberger there
was no prohibition on religion as a subject matter, our
holding did not rely on this factor. Instead, we concluded
simply that the university's denial of funding to print
Wide Awake was viewpoint discrimination, just as the
school district's refusal to allow Lamb's Chapel to show its
films was viewpoint discrimination. Ibid. Given the obvious religious content of Wide Awake, we cannot say that
the Club's activities are any more "religious" or deserve any
less First Amendment protection than did the publication of
Wide Awake in Rosenberger.

Despite our holdings in Lamb's Chapel and Rosenberger,
the Court of Appeals, like Milford, believed that its characterization of the Club's activities as religious in nature

533US1 Unit: $U71 [10-17-02 19:00:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN

111Cite as: 533 U. S. 98 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
warranted treating the Club's activities as different in
kind from the other activities permitted by the school. See
202 F. 3d, at 510 (the Club "is doing something other than
simply teaching moral values"). The "Christian viewpoint"
is unique, according to the court, because it contains an
"additional layer" that other kinds of viewpoints do not.
Id., at 509. That is, the Club "is focused on teaching children how to cultivate their relationship with God through
Jesus Christ," which it characterized as "quintessentially religious." Id., at 510. With these observations, the court
concluded that, because the Club's activities "fall outside
the bounds of pure `moral and character development,' " the
exclusion did not constitute viewpoint discrimination. Id.,
at 511.

We disagree that something that is "quintessentially religious" or "decidedly religious in nature" cannot also be
characterized properly as the teaching of morals and character development from a particular viewpoint. See 202 F.
3d, at 512 (Jacobs, J., dissenting) ("[W]hen the subject matter is morals and character, it is quixotic to attempt a distinction between religious viewpoints and religious subject
matters"). What matters for purposes of the Free Speech
Clause is that we can see no logical difference in kind between the invocation of Christianity by the Club and the
invocation of teamwork, loyalty, or patriotism by other associations to provide a foundation for their lessons. It is apparent that the unstated principle of the Court of Appeals'
reasoning is its conclusion that any time religious instruction and prayer are used to discuss morals and character, the
discussion is simply not a "pure" discussion of those issues.
According to the Court of Appeals, reliance on Christian
principles taints moral and character instruction in a way
that other foundations for thought or viewpoints do not.
We, however, have never reached such a conclusion. Instead, we reaffirm our holdings in Lamb's Chapel and Rosen533US1 Unit: $U71 [10-17-02 19:00:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN
112 GOOD NEWS CLUB v. MILFORD CENTRAL SCHOOL

Opinion of the Court
berger that speech discussing otherwise permissible sub-jects cannot be excluded from a limited public forum on the

ground that the subject is discussed from a religious view-point. Thus, we conclude that Milford's exclusion of the
Club from use of the school, pursuant to its community usepolicy, constitutes impermissible viewpoint discrimination.

IV
Milford argues that, even if its restriction constitutesviewpoint discrimination, its interest in not violating the

Establishment Clause outweighs the Club's interest in gain-ing equal access to the school's facilities. In other words,
according to Milford, its restriction was required to avoidviolating the Establishment Clause. We disagree.

We have said that a state interest in avoiding an Establish-ment Clause violation "may be characterized as compelling,"
and therefore may justify content-based discrimination.

4 Despite Milford's insistence that the Club's activities constitute "religious worship," the Court of Appeals made no such determination.
It did compare the Club's activities to "religious worship," 202 F. 3d,
at 510, but ultimately it concluded merely that the Club's activities "fall
outside the bounds of pure `moral and character development,' " id., at 511.
In any event, we conclude that the Club's activities do not constitute mere
religious worship, divorced from any teaching of moral values.

Justice Souter's recitation of the Club's activities is accurate. See
post, at 137-138 (dissenting opinion). But in our view, religion is used
by the Club in the same fashion that it was used by Lamb's Chapel and by
the students in Rosenberger: Religion is the viewpoint from which ideas
are conveyed. We did not find the Rosenberger students' attempt to cultivate a personal relationship with Christ to bar their claim that religion
was a viewpoint. And we see no reason to treat the Club's use of religion
as something other than a viewpoint merely because of any evangelical
message it conveys. According to Justice Souter, the Club's activities
constitute "an evangelical service of worship." Post, at 138. Regardless
of the label Justice Souter wishes to use, what matters is the substance of the Club's activities, which we conclude are materially indistinguishable from the activities in Lamb's Chapel and Rosenberger.

Opinion of the Court
Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S. 263, 271 (1981). However, it
is not clear whether a State's interest in avoiding an Establishment Clause violation would justify viewpoint discrimination. See Lamb's Chapel, 508 U. S., at 394-395 (noting
the suggestion in Widmar but ultimately not finding an Establishment Clause problem). We need not, however, confront the issue in this case, because we conclude that the
school has no valid Establishment Clause interest.

We rejected Establishment Clause defenses similar to
Milford's in two previous free speech cases, Lamb's Chapel
and Widmar. In particular, in Lamb's Chapel, we explained
that "[t]he showing of th[e] film series would not have been
during school hours, would not have been sponsored by the
school, and would have been open to the public, not just to
church members." 508 U. S., at 395. Accordingly, we found
that "there would have been no realistic danger that the
community would think that the District was endorsing religion or any particular creed." Ibid. Likewise, in Widmar,
where the university's forum was already available to other
groups, this Court concluded that there was no Establishment Clause problem. 454 U. S., at 272-273, and n. 13.

The Establishment Clause defense fares no better in this
case. As in Lamb's Chapel, the Club's meetings were held
after school hours, not sponsored by the school, and open
to any student who obtained parental consent, not just to
Club members. As in Widmar, Milford made its forum
available to other organizations. The Club's activities are
materially indistinguishable from those in Lamb's Chapel
and Widmar. Thus, Milford's reliance on the Establishment
Clause is unavailing.

Milford attempts to distinguish Lamb's Chapel and Widmar by emphasizing that Milford's policy involves elementary school children. According to Milford, children will
perceive that the school is endorsing the Club and will feel
coercive pressure to participate, because the Club's activities

114 GOOD NEWS CLUB v. MILFORD CENTRAL SCHOOL

Opinion of the Court
take place on school grounds, even though they occur duringnonschool hours.

5 This argument is unpersuasive.

First, we have held that "a significant factor in uphold-ing governmental programs in the face of Establishment

Clause attack is their neutrality towards religion." Rosen-berger, 515 U. S., at 839 (emphasis added). See also Mitchell
v. Helms, 530 U. S. 793, 809 (2000) (plurality opinion) ("Indistinguishing between indoctrination that is attributable to
the State and indoctrination that is not, [the Court has] con-sistently turned to the principle of

neutrality, upholding aidthat is offered to a broad range of groups or persons without

regard to their religion" (emphasis added)); id., at 838(O'C

onnor, J., concurring in judgment) ("[N]eutrality is animportant reason for upholding government-aid programs

against Establishment Clause challenges"). Milford's impli-cation that granting access to the Club would do damage to
the neutrality principle defies logic. For the "guarantee ofneutrality is respected, not offended, when the government,
following neutral criteria and evenhanded policies, extendsbenefits to recipients whose ideologies and viewpoints, including religious ones, are broad and diverse." Rosen-berger, supra, at 839. The Good News Club seeks nothing
more than to be treated neutrally and given access to speakabout the same topics as are other groups. Because allowing the Club to speak on school grounds would ensure neu-trality, not threaten it, Milford faces an uphill battle in arguing that the Establishment Clause compels it to excludethe Good News Club.

5 It is worth noting that, although Milford repeatedly has argued that
the Club's meeting time directly after the schoolday is relevant to its
Establishment Clause concerns, the record does not reflect any offer by
the school district to permit the Club to use the facilities at a different
time of day. The superintendent's stated reason for denying the applications was simply that the Club's activities were "religious instruction."
202 F. 3d, at 507. In any event, consistent with Lamb's Chapel and
Widmar, the school could not deny equal access to the Club for any time
that is generally available for public use.

115Cite as: 533 U. S. 98 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
Second, to the extent we consider whether the commu-nity would feel coercive pressure to engage in the Club's activities, cf. Lee v. Weisman, 505 U. S. 577, 592-593 (1992), therelevant community would be the parents, not the elementary school children. It is the parents who choose whethertheir children will attend the Good News Club meetings.
Because the children cannot attend without their parents'
permission, they cannot be coerced into engaging in theGood News Club's religious activities. Milford does not

suggest that the parents of elementary school children wouldbe confused about whether the school was endorsing religion.
Nor do we believe that such an argument could be reasonably advanced.

Third, whatever significance we may have assigned in the
Establishment Clause context to the suggestion that elementary school children are more impressionable than adults,
cf., e. g., id., at 592; School Dist. of Grand Rapids v. Ball,
473 U. S. 373, 390 (1985) (stating that "symbolism of a union
between church and state is most likely to influence children
of tender years, whose experience is limited and whose beliefs consequently are the function of environment as much
as of free and voluntary choice"), we have never extended
our Establishment Clause jurisprudence to foreclose private
religious conduct during nonschool hours merely because it
takes place on school premises where elementary school children may be present.

None of the cases discussed by Milford persuades us
that our Establishment Clause jurisprudence has gone this
far. For example, Milford cites Lee v. Weisman for the
proposition that "there are heightened concerns with protecting freedom of conscience from subtle coercive pressure in the elementary and secondary public schools," 505
U. S., at 592. In Lee, however, we concluded that attendance
at the graduation exercise was obligatory. Id., at 586. See
also Santa Fe Independent School Dist. v. Doe, 530 U. S. 290
(2000) (holding the school's policy of permitting prayer at

116 GOOD NEWS CLUB v. MILFORD CENTRAL SCHOOL

Opinion of the Court
football games unconstitutional where the activity took placeduring a school-sponsored event and not in a public forum).

We did not place independent significance on the fact thatthe graduation exercise might take place on school premises, Lee, supra, at 583. Here, where the school facilities arebeing used for a nonschool function and there is no government sponsorship of the Club's activities, Lee is inapposite.

Equally unsupportive is Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 U. S.
578 (1987), in which we held that a Louisiana law that proscribed the teaching of evolution as part of the public school
curriculum, unless accompanied by a lesson on creationism,
violated the Establishment Clause. In Edwards, we mentioned that students are susceptible to pressure in the classroom, particularly given their possible reliance on teachers
as role models. See id., at 584. But we did not discuss this
concern in our application of the law to the facts. Moreover,
we did note that mandatory attendance requirements meant
that state advancement of religion in a school would be particularly harshly felt by impressionable students.6 But we
did not suggest that, when the school was not actually advancing religion, the impressionability of students would be
relevant to the Establishment Clause issue. Even if Edwards had articulated the principle Milford believes it did,
the facts in Edwards are simply too remote from those here

6 Milford also cites Illinois ex rel. McCollum v. Board of Ed. of School
Dist. No. 71, Champaign Cty., 333 U. S. 203 (1948), for its position that
the Club's religious element would be advanced by the State through
compulsory attendance laws. In McCollum, the school district excused
students from their normal classroom study during the regular schoolday
to attend classes taught by sectarian religious teachers, who were subject
to approval by the school superintendent. Under these circumstances,
this Court found it relevant that "[t]he operation of the State's compulsory
education system . . . assist[ed] and [wa]s integrated with the program
of religious instruction carried on by separate religious sects." Id., at
209. In the present case, there is simply no integration and cooperation
between the school district and the Club. The Club's activities take place
after the time when the children are compelled by state law to be at the
school.

117Cite as: 533 U. S. 98 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
to give the principle any weight. Edwards involved thecontent of the curriculum taught by state teachers during

the schoolday to children required to attend. Obviously,when individuals who are not schoolteachers are giving
lessons after school to children permitted to attend onlywith parental consent, the concerns expressed in Edwards
are not present.7Fourth, even if we were to consider the possible misperceptions by schoolchildren in deciding whether Milford'spermitting the Club's activities would violate the Establishment Clause, the facts of this case simply do not sup-port Milford's conclusion. There is no evidence that young
children are permitted to loiter outside classrooms afterthe schoolday has ended. Surely even young children are
aware of events for which their parents must sign permission

7 Milford also refers to Board of Ed. of Westside Community Schools
(Dist. 66) v. Mergens, 496 U. S. 226 (1990), to support its view that "assumptions about the ability of students to make . . . subtle distinctions
[between schoolteachers during the schoolday and Reverend Fournier
after school] are less valid for elementary age children who tend to be
less informed, more impressionable, and more subject to peer pressure than average adults." Brief for Respondent 19. Four Justices in
Mergens believed that high school students likely are capable of distinguishing between government and private endorsement of religion.
See 496 U. S., at 250-251 (opinion of O'Connor, J.). The opinion, however, made no statement about how capable of discerning endorsement
elementary school children would have been in the context of Mergens,
where the activity at issue was after school. In any event, even to the
extent elementary school children are more prone to peer pressure than
are older children, it simply is not clear what, in this case, they could be
pressured to do.

In further support of the argument that the impressionability of elementary school children even after school is significant, Milford points
to several cases in which we have found Establishment Clause violations
in public schools. For example, Milford relies heavily on School Dist.
of Abington Township v. Schempp, 374 U. S. 203 (1963), in which we found
unconstitutional Pennsylvania's practice of permitting public schools to

is inapposite because this case does not involve activity by the school
during the schoolday.

118 GOOD NEWS CLUB v. MILFORD CENTRAL SCHOOL

Opinion of the Court
forms. The meetings were held in a combined high school
resource room and middle school special education room,
not in an elementary school classroom. The instructors are
not schoolteachers. And the children in the group are not
all the same age as in the normal classroom setting; their
ages range from 6 to 12.8 In sum, these circumstances
simply do not support the theory that small children would
perceive endorsement here.

Finally, even if we were to inquire into the minds of schoolchildren in this case, we cannot say the danger that children
would misperceive the endorsement of religion is any greater
than the danger that they would perceive a hostility toward
the religious viewpoint if the Club were excluded from the
public forum. This concern is particularly acute given the
reality that Milford's building is not used only for elementary school children. Students, from kindergarten through
the 12th grade, all attend school in the same building.
There may be as many, if not more, upperclassmen as elementary school children who occupy the school after hours.
For that matter, members of the public writ large are permitted in the school after hours pursuant to the community
use policy. Any bystander could conceivably be aware of
the school's use policy and its exclusion of the Good News
Club, and could suffer as much from viewpoint discrimination as elementary school children could suffer from perceived endorsement. Cf. Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at 835-836
(expressing the concern that viewpoint discrimination can
chill individual thought and expression).

8 Milford also relies on the Equal Access Act, 98 Stat. 1302, 20 U. S. C.

$$ 4071-4074, as evidence that Congress has recognized the vulnerability
of elementary school children to misperceiving endorsement of religion.
The Act, however, makes no express recognition of the impressionability
of elementary school children. It applies only to public secondary schools
and makes no mention of elementary schools. $ 4071(a). We can derive no meaning from the choice by Congress not to address elementary
schools.

Opinion of the Court
We cannot operate, as Milford would have us do, underthe assumption that any risk that small children would perceive endorsement should counsel in favor of excluding theClub's religious activity. We decline to employ Establishment Clause jurisprudence using a modified heckler's veto,in which a group's religious activity can be proscribed on
the basis of what the youngest members of the audiencemight misperceive. Cf.

Capitol Square Review and Ad-visory Bd. v. Pinette, 515 U. S. 753, 779-780 (1995) (O'C

onnor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment)("[B]ecause our concern is with the political community writ

large, the endorsement inquiry is not about the perceptionsof particular individuals or saving isolated nonadherents
from . . . discomfort . . . . It is for this reason that thereasonable observer in the endorsement inquiry must be
deemed aware of the history and context of the commu-nity and forum in which the religious [speech takes place]"
(emphasis added)). There are countervailing constitutionalconcerns related to rights of other individuals in the community. In this case, those countervailing concerns are thefree speech rights of the Club and its members. Cf.

Rosen-berger, supra, at 835 ("Vital First Amendment speech principles are at stake here"). And, we have already foundthat those rights have been violated, not merely perceived
to have been violated, by the school's actions toward theClub.

We are not convinced that there is any significance inthis case to the possibility that elementary school children
may witness the Good News Club's activities on schoolpremises, and therefore we can find no reason to depart from
our holdings in Lamb's Chapel and Widmar. Accordingly,we conclude that permitting the Club to meet on the school's
premises would not have violated the Establishment Clause.9

9 Both parties have briefed the Establishment Clause issue extensively,
and neither suggests that a remand would be of assistance on this issue.

120 GOOD NEWS CLUB v. MILFORD CENTRAL SCHOOL

Scalia, J., concurring

V
When Milford denied the Good News Club access to theschool's limited public forum on the ground that the Club

was religious in nature, it discriminated against the Clubbecause of its religious viewpoint in violation of the Free
Speech Clause of the First Amendment. Because Milfordhas not raised a valid Establishment Clause claim, we do
not address the question whether such a claim could excuseMilford's viewpoint discrimination.

* * *
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, andthe case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with

this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice Scalia, concurring.
I join the Court's opinion but write separately to explainfurther my views on two issues.

I
First, I join Part IV of the Court's opinion, regardingthe Establishment Clause issue, with the understanding

that its consideration of coercive pressure, see ante, at 115,and perceptions of endorsement, see ante, at 115, 117-118,
"to the extent" that the law makes such factors relevant,
several facts, see post, at 140, and Justice Breyer believes that development of those facts could yet be dispositive in this case, see post, at 128
(opinion concurring in part), none of these facts is relevant to the Establishment Clause inquiry. For example, Justice Souter suggests that we
cannot determine whether there would be an Establishment Clause violation unless we know when, and to what extent, other groups use the facilities. When a limited public forum is available for use by groups presenting any viewpoint, however, we would not find an Establishment Clause
violation simply because only groups presenting a religious viewpoint
have opted to take advantage of the forum at a particular time.

Scalia, J., concurring
is consistent with the belief (which I hold) that in this casethat extent is zero. As to coercive pressure: Physical coercion is not at issue here; and so-called "peer pressure,"if it can even be considered coercion, is, when it arises
from private activities, one of the attendant consequencesof a freedom of association that is constitutionally protected,
see, e. g., Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U. S. 609, 622
(1984); NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357 U. S. 449,460-461 (1958). What is at play here is not coercion, but the

compulsion of ideas--and the private right to exert and re-ceive that compulsion (or to have one's children receive it)
is protected by the Free Speech and Free Exercise Clauses,
see, e. g., Heffron v. International Soc. for Krishna Consciousness, Inc., 452 U. S. 640, 647 (1981); Murdock v. Pennsylvania, 319 U. S. 105, 108-109 (1943); Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U. S. 296, 307-310 (1940), not banned by the
Establishment Clause. A priest has as much liberty to
proselytize as a patriot.

As to endorsement, I have previously written that "[r]eligious expression cannot violate the Establishment Clause
where it (1) is purely private and (2) occurs in a traditional
or designated public forum, publicly announced and open
to all on equal terms." Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd. v. Pinette, 515 U. S. 753, 770 (1995). The same is
true of private speech that occurs in a limited public forum,
publicly announced, whose boundaries are not drawn to
favor religious groups but instead permit a cross-section
of uses. In that context, which is this case, "erroneous conclusions [about endorsement] do not count." Id., at 765.
See also Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free
School Dist., 508 U. S. 384, 401 (1993) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) ("I would hold, simply and clearly, that
giving [a private religious group] nondiscriminatory access
to school facilities cannot violate [the Establishment Clause]
because it does not signify state or local embrace of a particular religious sect").

Scalia, J., concurring

II
Second, since we have rejected the only reason that respondent gave for excluding the Club's speech from a forumthat clearly included it (the forum was opened to any "us[e]

pertaining to the welfare of the community," App. to Pet.for Cert. D1), I do not suppose it matters whether the exclusion is characterized as viewpoint or subject-matter dis-crimination. Lacking

any legitimate reason for excluding
the Club's speech from its forum--"because it's religious"will not do, see,

e. g., Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v.
Hialeah, 508 U. S. 520, 532-533, 546 (1993); Employment
Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U. S.
872, 877-878 (1990)--respondent would seem to fail First
Amendment scrutiny regardless of how its action is characterized. Even subject-matter limits must at least be
"reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum,"
Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473
U. S. 788, 806 (1985).1 But I agree, in any event, that respondent did discriminate on the basis of viewpoint.

As I understand it, the point of disagreement between
the Court and the dissenters (and the Court of Appeals)

1 In this regard, I should note the inaccuracy of Justice Souter's claim
that the reasonableness of the forum limitation is not properly before us,
see post, at 136, and n. 1 (dissenting opinion). Petitioners argued, both in
their papers filed in the District Court, Memorandum of Law in Support
of Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment in No. 97-CV-0302 (NDNY),
pp. 20-22, and in their brief filed on appeal, Brief for Appellants in
No. 98-9494 (CA2), pp. 33-35, that respondent's exclusion of them from
the forum was unreasonable in light of the purposes served by the forum.
Although the District Court did say in passing that the reasonableness
of respondent's general restriction on use of its facilities for religious
purposes was not challenged, see 21 F. Supp. 2d 147, 154 (NDNY 1998), the
Court of Appeals apparently decided that the particular reasonableness
challenge brought by petitioners had been preserved, because it addressed
the argument on the merits, see 202 F. 3d 502, 509 (CA2 2000) ("Taking
first the reasonableness criterion, the Club argues that the restriction
is unreasonable . . . . This argument is foreclosed by precedent").

Scalia, J., concurring
with regard to petitioner's Free Speech Clause claim is notwhether the Good News Club must be permitted to present

religious viewpoints on morals and character in respondent'sforum, which has been opened to secular discussions of that
subject, see ante, at 108.2 The answer to that is establishedby our decision in Lamb's Chapel, supra. The point of disagreement is not even whether some of the Club's religiousspeech fell within the protection of

Lamb's Chapel. It cer-tainly did. See ante, at 108; 202 F. 3d 502, 509 (CA2 2000)

(the Club's "teachings may involve secular values such asobedience or resisting jealousy").

The disagreement, rather, regards the portions of theClub's meetings that are not "purely" "discussions" of morality and character from a religious viewpoint. The Club,for example, urges children "who already believe in the
Lord Jesus as their Savior" to "[s]top and ask God for thestrength and the `want' . . . to obey Him," 21 F. Supp. 2d
147, 156 (NDNY 1998) (internal quotation marks omitted),and it invites children who "don't know Jesus as Savior" to
"trust the Lord Jesus to be [their] Savior from sin," ibid.The dissenters and the Second Circuit say that the presence
of such additional speech, because it is purely religious,transforms the Club's meetings into something different
in kind from other, nonreligious activities that teach moraland character development. See

post, at 132-133 (Stevens,J., dissenting); post, at 137-138 (
Souter, J., dissenting); 202F. 3d, at 509-511. Therefore, the argument goes, excluding

the Club is not viewpoint discrimination. I disagree.Respondent has opened its facilities to any "us[e] pertaining to the welfare of the community, provided that suchus[e] shall be nonexclusive and shall be opened to the general

2 Neither does the disagreement center on the mode of the Club's
speech--the fact that it sings songs and plays games. Although a forum
could perhaps be opened to lectures but not plays, debates but not concerts, respondent has placed no such restrictions on the use of its facilities.
See App. N8, N14, N19 (allowing seminars, concerts, and plays).

public." App. to Pet. for Cert. D1. Shaping the moraland character development of children certainly "pertain[s]

to the welfare of the community." Thus, respondent hasagreed that groups engaged in the endeavor of developing
character may use its forum. The Boy Scouts, for example,may seek "to influence a boy's character, development and
spiritual growth," App. N10-N11; cf. Boy Scouts of America
v. Dale, 530 U. S. 640, 649 (2000) ("[T]he general mission ofthe Boy Scouts is clear: `[t]o instill values in young people' "

(quoting the Scouts' mission statement)), and a group mayuse Aesop's Fables to teach moral values, App. N11. When
the Club attempted to teach Biblical-based moral values,
however, it was excluded because its activities "d[id] not
involve merely a religious perspective on the secular subject of morality" and because "it [was] clear from the conduct
of the meetings that the Good News Club goes far beyond
merely stating its viewpoint." 202 F. 3d, at 510.

From no other group does respondent require the sterility
of speech that it demands of petitioners. The Boy Scouts
could undoubtedly buttress their exhortations to keep
"morally straight" and live "clean" lives, see Boy Scouts
of America v. Dale, supra, at 649, by giving reasons why
that is a good idea--because parents want and expect it,
because it will make the scouts "better" and "more successful" people, because it will emulate such admired past Scouts
as former President Gerald Ford. The Club, however, may
only discuss morals and character, and cannot give its reasons why they should be fostered--because God wants and
expects it, because it will make the Club members "saintly"
people, and because it emulates Jesus Christ. The Club may
not, in other words, independently discuss the religious
premise on which its views are based--that God exists and
His assistance is necessary to morality. It may not defend
the premise, and it absolutely must not seek to persuade
the children that the premise is true. The children must,
so to say, take it on faith. This is blatant viewpoint dis533US1 Unit: $U71 [10-17-02 19:00:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN

crimination. Just as calls to character based on patriotismwill go unanswered if the listeners do not believe their country is good and just, calls to moral behavior based on God'swill are useless if the listeners do not believe that God exists.
Effectiveness in presenting a viewpoint rests on the persua-siveness with which the speaker defends his premise--and
in respondent's facilities every premise but a religious one
may be defended.In

Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515
U. S. 819 (1995), we struck down a similar viewpoint re-striction. There, a private student newspaper sought funding from a student-activity fund on the same basis as its
secular counterparts. And though the paper printed such
directly religious material as exhortations to belief, see id.,
at 826 (quoting the paper's self-described mission " `to encourage students to consider what a personal relationship
with Jesus Christ means' "); id., at 865 (Souter, J., dissenting) (" `The only way to salvation through Him is by confessing and repenting of sin. It is the Christian's duty to
make sinners aware of their need for salvation' " (quoting
the paper)); see also id., at 865-867 (quoting other examples),
we held that refusing to provide the funds discriminated on
the basis of viewpoint, because the religious speech had been
used to "provid[e] . . . a specific premise . . . from which a
variety of subjects may be discussed and considered," id.,
at 831 (opinion of the Court). The right to present a viewpoint based on a religion premise carried with it the right to
defend the premise.

The dissenters emphasize that the religious speech used
by the Club as the foundation for its views on morals and
character is not just any type of religious speech--although
they cannot agree exactly what type of religious speech it is.
In Justice Stevens's view, it is speech "aimed principally
at proselytizing or inculcating belief in a particular religious faith," post, at 130; see also post, at 133-134, n. 3.
This does not, to begin with, distinguish Rosenberger, which

126 GOOD NEWS CLUB v. MILFORD CENTRAL SCHOOL

Scalia, J., concurring
also involved proselytizing speech, as the above quotationsshow. See also Rosenberger, supra, at 844 (referring approvingly to the dissent's description of the paper as a"wor[k] characterized by . . . evangelism"). But in addition,
it does not distinguish the Club's activities from those of theother groups using respondent's forum--which have not, as
Justice Stevens suggests, see post, at 131-132, been re-stricted to roundtable "discussions" of moral issues. Those
groups may seek to inculcate children with their beliefs, andthey may furthermore "recruit others to join their respective
groups," post, at 131. The Club must therefore have libertyto do the same, even if, as

Justice Stevens fears withoutsupport in the record, see ibid., its actions may prove (shudder!) divisive. See Lamb's Chapel, 508 U. S., at 395 (re-marking that worries about "public unrest" caused by "proselytizing" are "difficult to defend as a reason to deny thepresentation of a religious point of view"); cf. Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U. S. 668, 684-685 (1984) (holding that "politicaldivisiveness" could not invalidate inclusion of cre` che in
municipal Christmas display); Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310U. S., at 310-311.

Justice Souter, while agreeing that the Club's religiousspeech "may be characterized as proselytizing,"

post, at 139,n. 3, thinks that it is even more clearly excludable from respondent's forum because it is essentially "an evangelicalservice of worship," post, at 138. But we have previously
rejected the attempt to distinguish worship from other reli-gious speech, saying that "the distinction has [no] intelligible
content," and further, no "relevance" to the constitutionalissue. Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S. 263, 269, n. 6 (1981);
see also Murdock v. Pennsylvania, 319 U. S., at 109 (refusingto distinguish evangelism from worship).

3 Those holdings

3 We have drawn a different distinction--between religious speech generally and speech about religion--but only with regard to restrictions the
State must place on its own speech, where pervasive state monitoring
is unproblematic. See School Dist. of Abington Township v. Schempp,

are surely proved correct today by the dissenters' inabilityto agree, even between themselves, into which subcategory

of religious speech the Club's activities fell. If the dis-tinction did have content, it would be beyond the courts'
competence to administer. Widmar v. Vincent, supra, at269, n. 6; cf. Lee v. Weisman, 505 U. S. 577, 616-617 (1992)
(Souter, J., concurring) ("I can hardly imagine a subjectless amenable to the competence of the federal judiciary,
or more deliberately to be avoided where possible," than"comparative theology"). And if courts (and other government officials) were competent, applying the distinctionwould require state monitoring of private, religious speech
with a degree of pervasiveness that we have previouslyfound unacceptable. See,

e. g., Rosenberger v. Rector andVisitors of Univ. of Va., supra, at 844-845; Widmar v. Vincent, supra, at 269, n. 6. I will not endorse an approach thatsuffers such a wondrous diversity of flaws.

* * *
With these words of explanation, I join the opinion of theCourt.

Justice Breyer, concurring in part.
I agree with the Court's conclusion and join its opinionto the extent that they are consistent with the following

three observations. First, the government's "neutrality" inrespect to religion is one, but only one, of the considerations
relevant to deciding whether a public school's policy violatesthe Establishment Clause. See,

e. g., Mitchell v. Helms, 530U. S. 793, 839 (2000) (O'C
onnor, J., concurring in judgment);

374 U. S. 203, 225 (1963) (State schools in their official capacity may not
teach religion but may teach about religion). Whatever the rule there,
licensing and monitoring private religious speech is an entirely different matter, see, e. g., Kunz v. New York, 340 U. S. 290, 293-294 (1951),
even in a limited public forum where the State has some authority to draw
subject-matter distinctions.

128 GOOD NEWS CLUB v. MILFORD CENTRAL SCHOOL

Breyer, J., concurring in part
Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd. v. Pinette, 515U. S. 753, 774, 777 (1995) (O'C

onnor, J., concurring in part
and concurring in judgment). As this Court previously hasindicated, a child's perception that the school has endorsed

a particular religion or religion in general may also provecritically important. See

School Dist. of Grand Rapids v.
Ball, 473 U. S. 373, 389-390 (1985); see also Lamb's Chapel
v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist., 508 U. S. 384,395 (1993);

County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties
Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U. S. 573, 592-594(1989). Today's opinion does not purport to change that

legal principle.

Second, the critical Establishment Clause question here
may well prove to be whether a child, participating in the
Good News Club's activities, could reasonably perceive the
school's permission for the Club to use its facilities as an
endorsement of religion. See Ball, supra, at 390 ("[A]n important concern of the effects test is whether . . . the challenged government action is sufficiently likely to be perceived by adherents of the controlling denominations as an
endorsement, and by the nonadherents as a disapproval, of
their individual religious choices"). The time of day, the
age of the children, the nature of the meetings, and other
specific circumstances are relevant in helping to determine whether, in fact, the Club "so dominate[s]" the "forum"
that, in the children's minds, "a formal policy of equal access
is transformed into a demonstration of approval." Capitol
Square Review and Advisory Bd., supra, at 777 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).

Third, the Court cannot fully answer the Establishment
Clause question this case raises, given its procedural posture. The specific legal action that brought this case to the
Court of Appeals was the District Court's decision to grant
Milford Central School's motion for summary judgment.
The Court of Appeals affirmed the grant of summary judgment. We now hold that the school was not entitled to

Breyer, J., concurring in part
summary judgment, either in respect to the Free Speech orthe Establishment Clause issue. Our holding must mean

that, viewing the disputed facts (including facts about thechildren's perceptions)

favorably to the Club (the nonmoving
party), the school has not shown an Establishment Clauseviolation.

To deny one party's motion for summary judgment, however, is not to grant summary judgment for the other side.There may be disputed "genuine issue[s]" of "material fact,"

Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(c), particularly about how a reason-able child participant would understand the school's role,
cf. post, at 140 (Souter, J., dissenting). Indeed, the Court
itself points to facts not in evidence, ante, at 117 ("There is
no evidence that young children are permitted to loiter outside classrooms after the schoolday has ended"), ante, at 118
("There may be as many, if not more, upperclassmen as
elementary school children who occupy the school after
hours"), identifies facts in evidence which may, depending
on other facts not in evidence, be of legal significance, ibid.
(discussing the type of room in which the meetings were
held and noting that the Club's participants "are not all the
same age as in the normal classroom setting"), and makes assumptions about other facts, ante, at 117-118 ("Surely even
young children are aware of events for which their parents
must sign permission forms"), ante, at 118 ("Any bystander
could conceivably be aware of the school's use policy and
its exclusion of the Good News Club, and could suffer as
much from viewpoint discrimination as elementary school
children could suffer from perceived endorsement"). The
Court's invocation of what is missing from the record and
its assumptions about what is present in the record only confirm that both parties, if they so desire, should have a fair
opportunity to fill the evidentiary gap in light of today's
opinion. Cf. Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 56(c) (summary judgment

material fact" and movant "is entitled to a judgment as a

matter of law"), 56(f) (permitting supplementation of recordfor summary judgment purposes where appropriate).

Justice Stevens, dissenting.
The Milford Central School has invited the public to useits facilities for educational and recreational purposes, but

not for "religious purposes." Speech for "religious pur-poses" may reasonably be understood to encompass three
different categories. First, there is religious speech that issimply speech about a particular topic from a religious point
of view. The film in Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches
Union Free School Dist., 508 U. S. 384 (1993), illustrates thiscategory. See id., at 388 (observing that the film series at

issue in that case "would discuss Dr. [James] Dobson's viewson the undermining influences of the media that could only
be counterbalanced by returning to traditional, Christianfamily values instilled at an early stage"). Second, there is
religious speech that amounts to worship, or its equivalent.Our decision in Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S. 263 (1981),
concerned such speech. See id., at 264-265 (describingthe speech in question as involving "religious worship").
Third, there is an intermediate category that is aimed principally at proselytizing or inculcating belief in a particularreligious faith.

A public entity may not generally exclude even religiousworship from an open public forum.

Id., at 276. Similarly,
a public entity that creates a limited public forum for thediscussion of certain specified topics may not exclude a

speaker simply because she approaches those topics froma religious point of view. Thus, in

Lamb's Chapel we held
that a public school that permitted its facilities to be usedfor the discussion of family issues and child rearing could

not deny access to speakers presenting a religious pointof view on those issues. See 508 U. S., at 393-394.

But, while a public entity may not censor speech about
an authorized topic based on the point of view expressed

concurring in judgment)). Accordingly, "control over accessto a nonpublic forum can be based on subject matter and

speaker identity so long as the distinctions drawn are reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum and are
viewpoint neutral." Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense
& Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U. S. 788, 806 (1985). The novel question that this case presents concerns the constitutionality of
a public school's attempt to limit the scope of a public forum
it has created. More specifically, the question is whether a
school can, consistently with the First Amendment, create a
limited public forum that admits the first type of religious
speech without allowing the other two.

Distinguishing speech from a religious viewpoint, on the
one hand, from religious proselytizing, on the other, is comparable to distinguishing meetings to discuss political issues
from meetings whose principal purpose is to recruit new
members to join a political organization. If a school decides
to authorize afterschool discussions of current events in
its classrooms, it may not exclude people from expressing
their views simply because it dislikes their particular political opinions. But must it therefore allow organized political
groups--for example, the Democratic Party, the Libertarian
Party, or the Ku Klux Klan--to hold meetings, the principal purpose of which is not to discuss the current-events
topic from their own unique point of view but rather to
recruit others to join their respective groups? I think not.
Such recruiting meetings may introduce divisiveness and

tend to separate young children into cliques that underminethe school's educational mission. Cf.

Lehman v. Shaker
Heights, 418 U. S. 298 (1974) (upholding a city's refusal toallow "political advertising" on public transportation).

School officials may reasonably believe that evangelicalmeetings designed to convert children to a particular religious faith pose the same risk. And, just as a school may
allow meetings to discuss current events from a politicalperspective without also allowing organized political recruitment, so too can a school allow discussion of topicssuch as moral development from a religious (or nonreligious)
perspective without thereby opening its forum to religious
proselytizing or worship. See, e. g., Campbell v. St. Tammany Parish School Board, 231 F. 3d 937, 942 (CA5 2000)
("Under the Supreme Court's jurisprudence, a government
entity such as a school board has the opportunity to open
its facilities to activity protected by the First Amendment,
without inviting political or religious activities presented
in a form that would disserve its efforts to maintain neutrality"). Moreover, any doubt on a question such as this
should be resolved in a way that minimizes "intrusion by
the Federal Government into the operation of our public
schools," Mergens, 496 U. S., at 290 (Stevens, J., dissenting);
see also Epperson v. Arkansas, 393 U. S. 97, 104 (1968)
("Judicial interposition in the operation of the public school
system of the Nation raises problems requiring care and
restraint. . . . By and large, public education in our Nation is
committed to the control of state and local authorities").

The particular limitation of the forum at issue in this case
is one that prohibits the use of the school's facilities for "religious purposes." It is clear that, by "religious purposes,"
the school district did not intend to exclude all speech from
a religious point of view. See App. N13-N15 (testimony of
the superintendent for Milford schools indicating that the
policy would permit people to teach "that man was created
by God as described in the Book of Genesis" and that crime

was caused by society's "lack of faith in God"). Instead, itsought only to exclude religious speech whose principal goal

is to "promote the gospel." Id., at N18. In other words,the school sought to allow the first type of religious speech
while excluding the second and third types. As long as thisis done in an evenhanded manner, I see no constitutional
violation in such an effort.1 The line between the variouscategories of religious speech may be difficult to draw, but
I think that the distinctions are valid, and that a school,particularly an elementary school, must be permitted to
draw them.2 Cf. Illinois ex rel. McCollum v. Board of Ed.
of School Dist. No. 71, Champaign Cty., 333 U. S. 203, 231(1948) (Frankfurter, J., concurring) ("In no activity of the

State is it more vital to keep out divisive forces than inits schools . . .").

This case is undoubtedly close. Nonetheless, regardlessof whether the Good News Club's activities amount to "worship," it does seem clear, based on the facts in the record,that the school district correctly classified those activities
as falling within the third category of religious speech andtherefore beyond the scope of the school's limited public
forum.3 In short, I am persuaded that the school district

1 The school district, for example, could not, consistently with its present policy, allow school facilities to be used by a group that affirmatively
attempted to inculcate nonbelief in God or in the view that morality
is wholly unrelated to belief in God. Nothing in the record, however,
indicates that any such group was allowed to use school facilities.

2 "A perceptive observer sees a material difference between the light

of day and the dark of night, and knows that difference to be a reality
even though the two are separated not by a bright line but by a zone of
twilight." Buirkle v. Hanover Ins. Cos., 832 F. Supp. 469, 483 (Mass.
1993).

3 The majority elides the distinction between religious speech on a

particular topic and religious speech that seeks primarily to inculcate
belief. Thus, it relies on Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ.
of Va., 515 U. S. 819 (1995), as if that case involved precisely the same
type of speech that is at issue here. But, while both Wide Awake, the
organization in Rosenberger, and the Good News Club engage in a mixture

could (and did) permissibly exclude from its limited pub-lic forum proselytizing religious speech that does not rise

to the level of actual worship. I would therefore affirm thejudgment of the Court of Appeals.

Even if I agreed with Part II of the majority opinion, how-ever, I would not reach out, as it does in Part IV, to decide
a constitutional question that was not addressed by eitherthe District Court or the Court of Appeals.

Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.
Justice Souter, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins,dissenting.

The majority rules on two issues. First, it decides thatthe Court of Appeals failed to apply the rule in

Lamb'sChapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist., 508

U. S. 384 (1993), which held that the government may notdiscriminate on the basis of viewpoint in operating a limited
public forum. The majority applies that rule and concludesthat Milford violated Lamb's Chapel in denying Good News
the use of the school. The majority then goes on to de-termine that it would not violate the Establishment Clause
of the First Amendment for the Milford School Districtto allow the Good News Club to hold its intended gatherings of public school children in Milford's elementary school.
of different types of religious speech, the Rosenberger Court clearly believed that the first type of religious speech predominated in Wide Awake.
It described that group's publications as follows:

"The first issue had articles about racism, crisis pregnancy, stress, prayer,
C. S. Lewis' ideas about evil and free will, and reviews of religious music.
In the next two issues, Wide Awake featured stories about homosexuality,
Christian missionary work, and eating disorders, as well as music reviews
and interviews with University professors." Id., at 826.

In contrast to Wide Awake's emphasis on providing Christian commentary on such a diverse array of topics, Good News Club meetings
are dominated by religious exhortation, see post, at 137-138 (Souter, J.,
dissenting). My position is therefore consistent with the Court's decision
in Rosenberger.

The majority is mistaken on both points. The Court ofAppeals unmistakably distinguished this case from Lamb's

Chapel, though not by name, and accordingly affirmed theapplication of a policy, unchallenged in the District Court,
that Milford's public schools may not be used for religiouspurposes. As for the applicability of the Establishment
Clause to the Good News Club's intended use of Milford'sschool, the majority commits error even in reaching the
issue, which was addressed neither by the Court of Appealsnor by the District Court. I respectfully dissent.

I
Lamb's Chapel, a case that arose (as this one does) fromapplication of N. Y. Educ. Law $ 414 (McKinney 2000) and

local policy implementing it, built on the accepted rule thata government body may designate a public forum subject
to a reasonable limitation on the scope of permitted sub-ject matter and activity, so long as the government does
not use the forum-defining restrictions to deny expressionto a particular viewpoint on subjects open to discussion.
Specifically, Lamb's Chapel held that the government couldnot "permit school property to be used for the presentation
of all views about family issues and child rearing exceptthose dealing with the subject matter from a religious standpoint." 508 U. S., at 393-394.This case, like Lamb's Chapel, properly raises no issue
about the reasonableness of Milford's criteria for restrict-ing the scope of its designated public forum. Milford has
opened school property for, among other things, "instructionin any branch of education, learning or the arts" and for
"social, civic and recreational meetings and entertainmentevents and other uses pertaining to the welfare of the community, provided that such uses shall be nonexclusive andshall be opened to the general public." App. to Pet. for
Cert. D1-D3. But Milford has done this subject to the re-striction that "[s]chool premises shall not be used . . . for

religious purposes." Id., at D2. As the District Courtstated, Good News did "not object to the reasonableness

of [Milford]'s policy that prohibits the use of [its] facilitiesfor religious purposes." Id., at C14.

The sole question before the District Court was, there-fore, whether, in refusing to allow Good News's intended
use, Milford was misapplying its unchallenged restrictionin a way that amounted to imposing a viewpoint-based restriction on what could be said or done by a group entitledto use the forum for an educational, civic, or other permitted
purpose. The question was whether Good News was beingdisqualified when it merely sought to use the school property
the same way that the Milford Boy and Girl Scouts and the4-H Club did. The District Court held on the basis of undisputed facts that Good News's activity was essentially unlikethe presentation of views on secular issues from a religious
standpoint held to be protected in Lamb's Chapel, see App.to Pet. for Cert. C29-C31, and was instead activity precluded
by Milford's unchallenged policy against religious use, evenunder the narrowest definition of that term.

The Court of Appeals understood the issue the same way.See 202 F. 3d 502, 508 (CA2 2000) (Good News argues that
"to exclude the Club because it teaches morals and valuesfrom a Christian perspective constitutes unconstitutional
viewpoint discrimination"); id., at 509 ("The crux of the GoodNews Club's argument is that the Milford school's application
of the Community Use Policy to exclude the Club from itsfacilities is not viewpoint neutral").

1 The Court of Appeals held that any challenge to the policy's reasonableness was foreclosed by its own precedent, 202 F. 3d, at 509, a holding the majority leaves untouched, see ante, at 107 ("[W]e need not decide
whether it is unreasonable in light of the purposes served by the forum");
cf. ante, at 108, n. 2 ("Because we hold that the exclusion of the Club on
the basis of its religious perspective constitutes unconstitutional viewpoint
discrimination, it is no defense for Milford that purely religious purposes
can be excluded under state law"). In any event, the reasonableness of
the forum limitation was beyond the scope of the appeal from summary

also realized that the Lamb's Chapel criterion was the ap-propriate measure: "The activities of the Good News Club

do not involve merely a religious perspective on the secularsubject of morality." 202 F. 3d, at 510. Cf.

Lamb's Chapel,
supra, at 393 (district could not exclude "religious stand-point" in discussion on child rearing and family values, an

undisputed "use for social or civic purposes otherwise permitted" under the use policy).2 The appeals court agreedwith the District Court that the undisputed facts in this case

differ from those in Lamb's Chapel, as night from day. Asampling of those facts shows why both courts were correct.

Good News's classes open and close with prayer. In asample lesson considered by the District Court, children are
instructed that "[t]he Bible tells us how we can have oursins forgiven by receiving the Lord Jesus Christ. It tells us
how to live to please Him. . . . If you have received the LordJesus as your Saviour from sin, you belong to God's special
group--His family." App. to Pet. for Cert. C17-C18 (ellipsis
in original). The lesson plan instructs the teacher to "lead
a child to Christ," and, when reading a Bible verse, to "[e]mphasize that this verse is from the Bible, God's Word," and
is "important--and true--because God said it." The lesson
further exhorts the teacher to "[b]e sure to give an opportunity for the `unsaved' children in your class to respond to the
Gospel" and cautions against "neglect[ing] this responsibility." Id., at C20.

While Good News's program utilizes songs and games,
the heart of the meeting is the "challenge" and "invitation,"
which are repeated at various times throughout the lesson.

use limitation was not challenged.

2 It is true, as the majority notes, ante, at 109, n. 3, that the Court

of Appeals did not cite Lamb's Chapel by name. But it followed it in
substance, and it did cite an earlier opinion written by the author of the
panel opinion here, Bronx Household of Faith v. Community School Dist.

Souter, J., dissenting
During the challenge, "saved" children who "already believe
in the Lord Jesus as their Savior" are challenged to " `stop
and ask God for the strength and the "want" . . . to obey
Him.' " Ibid. They are instructed that

"[i]f you know Jesus as your Savior, you need to place
God first in your life. And if you don't know Jesus as
Savior and if you would like to, then we will--we will
pray with you separately, individually. . . . And the challenge would be, those of you who know Jesus as Savior,
you can rely on God's strength to obey Him." Ibid.

During the invitation, the teacher "invites" the "unsaved"
children " `to trust the Lord Jesus to be your Savior from
sin,' " and " `receiv[e] [him] as your Savior from sin.' " Id.,
at C21. The children are then instructed that

"[i]f you believe what God's Word says about your sin
and how Jesus died and rose again for you, you can have
His forever life today. Please bow your heads and close
your eyes. If you have never believed on the Lord
Jesus as your Savior and would like to do that, please
show me by raising your hand. If you raised your hand
to show me you want to believe on the Lord Jesus,
please meet me so I can show you from God's Word how
you can receive His everlasting life." Ibid.

It is beyond question that Good News intends to use the
public school premises not for the mere discussion of a subject from a particular, Christian point of view, but for an
evangelical service of worship calling children to commit
themselves in an act of Christian conversion.3 The majority

3 The majority rejects Milford's contention that Good News's activities
fall outside the purview of the limited forum because they constitute "religious worship" on the ground that the Court of Appeals made no such
determination regarding the character of the club's program, see ante,
at 112, n. 4. This distinction is merely semantic, in light of the Court

avoids this reality only by resorting to the bland and general characterization of Good News's activity as "teaching
of morals and character, from a religious standpoint." Ante,
at 109. If the majority's statement ignores reality, as it
surely does, then today's holding may be understood only in
equally generic terms. Otherwise, indeed, this case would
stand for the remarkable proposition that any public school
opened for civic meetings must be opened for use as a church,
synagogue, or mosque.

II

I also respectfully dissent from the majority's refusal to
remand on all other issues, insisting instead on acting as
a court of first instance in reviewing Milford's claim that
it would violate the Establishment Clause to grant Good
News's application. Milford raised this claim to demonstrate a compelling interest for saying no to Good News,
even on the erroneous assumption that Lamb's Chapel's
public forum analysis would otherwise require Milford to
say yes. Whereas the District Court and Court of Appeals
resolved this case entirely on the ground that Milford's actions did not offend the First Amendment's Speech Clause,
the majority now sees fit to rule on the application of the
Establishment Clause, in derogation of this Court's proper
role as a court of review. E. g., National Collegiate Athletic

of Appeals's conclusion that "[i]t is difficult to see how the Club's activities
differ materially from the `religious worship' described" in other case law,
202 F. 3d 502, 510 (CA2 2000), and the record below.

Justice Stevens distinguishes between proselytizing and worship,
ante, at 130 (dissenting opinion), and distinguishes each from discussion
reflecting a religious point of view. I agree with Justice Stevens that
Good News's activities may be characterized as proselytizing and therefore as outside the purpose of Milford's limited forum, ante, at 133. Like
the Court of Appeals, I also believe Good News's meetings have elements
of worship that put the club's activities further afield of Milford's limited
forum policy, the legitimacy of which was unchallenged in the summary
judgment proceeding.

Souter, J., dissenting
Assn. v. Smith, 525 U. S. 459, 470 (1999) ("[W]e do not decidein the first instance issues not decided below").

The Court's usual insistence on resisting temptations toconvert itself into a trial court and on remaining a court of
review is not any mere procedural nicety, and my objectionto turning us into a district court here does not hinge on a
preference for immutable procedural rules. Respect for our
role as a reviewing court rests, rather, on recognizing thatthis Court can often learn a good deal from considering how

a district court and a court of appeals have worked their waythrough a difficult issue. It rests on recognizing that an
issue as first conceived may come to be seen differently as a
case moves through trial and appeal; we are most likely to
contribute something of value if we act with the benefit of
whatever refinement may come in the course of litigation.
And our customary refusal to become a trial court reflects
the simple fact that this Court cannot develop a record as
well as a trial court can. If I were a trial judge, for example,
I would balk at deciding on summary judgment whether an
Establishment Clause violation would occur here without
having statements of undisputed facts or uncontradicted
affidavits showing, for example, whether Good News conducts its instruction at the same time as school-sponsored
extracurricular and athletic activities conducted by school
staff and volunteers, see Brief for Respondent 6; whether
any other community groups use school facilities immediately after classes end and how many students participate
in those groups; and the extent to which Good News, with
28 students in its membership, may "dominate the forum"
in a way that heightens the perception of official endorsement, Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va.,

Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S. 263, 274 (1981). We will never

instance. Like the majority, I lack the benefit that devel-opment in the District Court and Court of Appeals might

provide, and like the majority I cannot say for sure howcomplete the record may be. I can, however, speak to the
doubtful underpinnings of the majority's conclusion.This Court has accepted the independent obligation to
obey the Establishment Clause as sufficiently compelling
to satisfy strict scrutiny under the First Amendment. See
id., at 271 ("[T]he interest of the [government] in complying
with its constitutional obligations may be characterized ascompelling");

Lamb's Chapel, 508 U. S., at 394. Milford's actions would offend the Establishment Clause if they carried
the message of endorsing religion under the circumstances,
as viewed by a reasonable observer. See Capitol Square
Review and Advisory Bd. v. Pinette, 515 U. S. 753, 777 (1995)
(O'Connor, J., concurring). The majority concludes that
such an endorsement effect is out of the question in Milford's
case, because the context here is "materially indistinguishable" from the facts in Lamb's Chapel and Widmar. Ante,
at 113. In fact, the majority is in no position to say that, for
the principal grounds on which we based our Establishment
Clause holdings in those cases are clearly absent here.

In Widmar, we held that the Establishment Clause did
not bar a religious student group from using a public university's meeting space for worship as well as discussion.
As for the reasonable observers who might perceive government endorsement of religion, we pointed out that the
forum was used by university students, who "are, of course,
young adults," and, as such, "are less impressionable than
younger students and should be able to appreciate that the
University's policy is one of neutrality toward religion."
454 U. S., at 274, n. 14. To the same effect, we remarked
that the "large number of groups meeting on campus" negated "any reasonable inference of University support from
the mere fact of a campus meeting place." Ibid. Not only
was the forum "available to a broad class of nonreligious as

well as religious speakers," but there were, in fact, over 100recognized student groups at the University, and an "absence

of empirical evidence that religious groups [would] dominate[the University's] open forum." Id., at 274-275; see also id.,
at 274 ("The provision of benefits to so broad a spectrum ofgroups is an important index of secular effect"). And if all
that had not been enough to show that the university-studentuse would probably create no impression of religious endorsement, we pointed out that the university in that casehad issued a student handbook with the explicit disclaimer
that "the University's name will not `be identified in any waywith the aims, policies, programs, products, or opinions of
any organization or its members.' " Id., at 274, n. 14.

Lamb's Chapel involved an evening film series on childrearing open to the general public (and, given the subject

matter, directed at an adult audience). See 508 U. S., at 387,395. There, school property "had repeatedly been used by
a wide variety of private organizations," and we could saywith some assurance that "[u]nder these circumstances . . .
there would have been no realistic danger that the commu-nity would think that the District was endorsing religion or
any particular creed . . . ." Id., at 395.What we know about this case looks very little like

Wid-mar or Lamb's Chapel. The cohort addressed by Good

News is not university students with relative maturity,or even high school pupils, but elementary school children
as young as six.4 The Establishment Clause cases have

4 It is certainly correct that parents are required to give permission for
their children to attend Good News's classes, see ante, at 115 (as parents
are often required to do for a host of official school extracurricular activities), and correct that those parents would likely not be confused as to the
sponsorship of Good News's classes. But the proper focus of concern in
assessing effects includes the elementary school pupils who are invited to
meetings, Lodging, Exh. X2, who see peers heading into classrooms for
religious instruction as other classes end, and who are addressed by the
"challenge" and "invitation."

students were confused during the time the Good News Club met on school

County

Edwards v. Aguillard, supra, at

wide-ranging intellectual exchange that were home to thechallenged activities in

Widmar and Lamb's Chapel. See
also Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at 850, 836-837. In Widmar,the nature of the university campus and the sheer number

of activities offered precluded the reasonable college ob-server from seeing government endorsement in any one of
them, and so did the time and variety of community use inthe

Lamb's Chapel case. See also Rosenberger, 515 U. S.,

144 GOOD NEWS CLUB v. MILFORD CENTRAL SCHOOL

Souter, J., dissenting
U. S. 226, 252 (1990) (plurality opinion) ("To the extent thata religious club is merely one of many different studentinitiated voluntary clubs, students should perceive no mes-sage of government endorsement of religion").

The timing and format of Good News's gatherings, on theother hand, may well affirmatively suggest the

imprimatur
of officialdom in the minds of the young children. The club
is open solely to elementary students (not the entire com-munity, as in

Lamb's Chapel), only four outside groups have
been identified as meeting in the school, and Good News is,seemingly, the only one whose instruction follows immediately on the conclusion of the official schoolday. See Brief
for National School Boards Association et al. as Amici Curiae 6. Although school is out at 2:56 p.m., Good News apparently requested use of the school beginning at 2:30 on
Tuesdays "during the school year," so that instruction could
begin promptly at 3:00, see Lodging, Exh. W-1, at which
time children who are compelled by law to attend school
surely remain in the building. Good News's religious meeting follows regular school activities so closely that the Good
News instructor must wait to begin until "the room is clear,"
and "people are out of the room," App. P29, before starting
proceedings in the classroom located next to the regular
third- and fourth-grade rooms, id., at N12. In fact, the
temporal and physical continuity of Good News's meetings
with the regular school routine seems to be the whole point
of using the school. When meetings were held in a community church, 8 or 10 children attended; after the school became the site, the number went up three-fold. Id., at P12;
Lodging, Exh. AA2.

Even on the summary judgment record, then, a record
lacking whatever supplementation the trial process might
have led to, and devoid of such insight as the trial and appellate judges might have contributed in addressing the

ALABAMA v. BOZEMAN
certiorari to the supreme court of alabama

No. 00-492. Argued April 17, 2001--Decided June 11, 2001
The Interstate Agreement on Detainers (Agreement) creates uniform procedures for lodging and executing a detainer, i. e., a legal order that
requires a State to hold a currently imprisoned individual when he has
finished serving his sentence so that he may be tried by a different
State for a different crime. As relevant here, the Agreement provides
that a State that obtains a prisoner for purposes of trial must try him
within 120 days of his arrival, Art. IV(c), and if it returns him to his
"original place of imprisonment" prior to that trial, charges "shall" be
dismissed with prejudice, Art. IV(e). While respondent Bozeman was
serving a federal prison sentence in Florida, the Covington County, Alabama, district attorney sought temporary custody of Bozeman to arraign
him on firearms charges and to appoint counsel. When taken to Covington County, Bozeman spent the night in the county jail, appeared in
local court the next morning, obtained local counsel, and was returned
to federal prison that evening. About one month later, he was brought
back to the county for trial. Bozeman's counsel moved to dismiss the
state charges on the ground that, because Bozeman had been "returned
to the original place of imprisonment" (namely, the federal prison) "prior
to" "trial" on state charges being "had," in violation of Article IV(e),
the local court had to dismiss the charges with prejudice in light of Art.
IV(e)'s command as to remedy. Bozeman was convicted, and an appeals
court affirmed. The State Supreme Court reversed, holding that the
Agreement's literal language controlled and required dismissal of the
state charges.

Held: The literal language of Article IV(e) bars any further criminal proceedings when a defendant is returned to the original place of imprisonment before trial. Pp. 152-157.

(a) Alabama claims that Article IV(e)'s basic purpose is to prevent
shuttling that would interrupt a prisoner's rehabilitation and that,
since the one-day interruption here did not interrupt rehabilitation
significantly, any violation is "technical," "harmless," or "de minimis."
However, the Agreement's language militates against an implicit exception, for it is absolute, as the word "shall" is ordinarily the language
of command. Anderson v. Yungkau, 329 U. S. 482, 485. Moreover,
the Agreement makes no distinction among different kinds of arrivals,
e. g., exempting those that are followed by return within a short, speci533US1 Unit: $U72 [11-21-01 06:43:16] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Syllabus
fied time period, or those that are simply for arraignment purposes.
Pp. 152-154.

(b) Even assuming that the Agreement exempts violations that,
viewed in terms of its purposes, are de minimis, the violation here could
not qualify as trivial, because the "no return" provision's purpose cannot
be a simple, direct effort to prevent the interruption of rehabilitation.
Article IV(e)'s requirement that the prisoner remain in the county jail
means that he will typically spend 120 days away from the sending
State's rehabilitation programs, whereas returning him prior to trial--
in violation of IV(e)--would permit him to participate in the sending
State's program for some of those days. To call such a violation "technical," because it means fewer days spent away from the sending State,
is to call virtually every conceivable antishuttling violation "technical."
The Agreement may seek to remove rehabilitation obstructions in a
different way: Requiring the receiving State to pay for the prisoner's
incarceration during the pretrial period (pursuant to Article V) may
give the State an incentive to shorten that period and dispose of detainers expeditiously. Alternatively, the Agreement's drafters may have
sought to minimize the number of shuttles in the belief that the "shuttling" itself adds to the uncertainties obstructing rehabilitation programs, see Art. I. Regardless of the antishuttling remedy's original
purpose, given the Agreement's absolute language, it is enough to
explain why Alabama's view is not plausible and to point to other purposes more easily squared with Article IV(e)'s text and operation.
Pp. 154-156.

(c) Alabama's additional claim that return to the sending State after
a brief journey to the receiving State for pretrial purposes is helpful,
not harmful, to the prisoner is a policy argument more appropriately
addressed to legislatures. And the federal statutory provision to which
the Solicitor General points governs only when the United States is a
receiving State, which does not help Alabama's cause. Although this
Court rejects Alabama's interpretation of the Agreement, a receiving
State is not barred from returning a prisoner when it would be mutually
advantageous and the prisoner accordingly waives his Article IV(e)
rights. Pp. 156-157.

Opinion of the Court
Sandra Jean Stewart, Assistant Attorney General of Ala-bama, argued the cause for petitioner. With her on the

briefs was Bill Pryor, Attorney General.Jeffrey A. Lamken argued the cause for the United States
as amicus curiae urging reversal. With him on the briefwere Acting Solicitor General Underwood, Acting Assistant
Attorney General Keeney, and Deputy Solicitor General
Dreeben.Mark John Christensen, by appointment of the Court, 531

U. S. 1141, argued the cause and filed a brief for respondent.*

Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.#
Forty-eight States, the Federal Government, and the Dis-trict of Columbia (all of which, for simplicity, we shall call

"States") have entered into the Interstate Agreement on De-tainers (Agreement), 18 U. S. C. App. $ 2, p. 692, an interstate
compact. The Agreement creates uniform procedures forlodging and executing a detainer,

i. e., a legal order that re-quires a State in which an individual is currently imprisoned

to hold that individual when he has finished serving his sen-tence so that he may be tried by a different State for a different crime.The Agreement provides for expeditious delivery of the
prisoner to the receiving State for trial prior to the termina-tion of his sentence in the sending State. And it seeks to
minimize the consequent interruption of the prisoner's ongo-ing prison term. In particular, Article IV(c) specifies that
the receiving State shall begin the prisoner's "trial . . .within one hundred and twenty days of the arrival of the
prisoner in the receiving State." At the same time, ArticleIV(e) prohibits return of the individual to the sending State
before that trial is complete. It says:

Association of Extradition Officials as amicus curiae urging reversal.

Opinion of the Court
"If trial is not had on any indictment, information, orcomplaint contemplated hereby prior to the prisoner's

being returned to the original place of imprisonmentpursuant to article V(e) hereof, such indictment, information, or complaint shall not be of any further force oreffect, and the court shall enter an order dismissing the
same with prejudice." (Emphasis added.)
The case before us requires us to interpret the Article IVlanguage that we have just quoted. See

New York v. Hill,528 U. S. 110, 111 (2000) ("As `a congressionally sanctioned

interstate compact' within the Compact Clause of the UnitedStates Constitution, Art. I, $ 10, cl. 3, the [Interstate Agreement on Detainers] is a federal law subject to federal con-struction") (quoting Carchman v. Nash, 473 U. S. 716, 719
(1985); Cuyler v. Adams, 449 U. S. 433, 442 (1981)). Thecase concerns a defendant whose initial imprisonment was
interrupted briefly--for a single day--during which time hewas brought to the receiving State for purposes of arraignment and then returned immediately to his original place ofimprisonment. The question is whether, in such circumstances, the literal language of Article IV(e) bars any furthercriminal proceedings--because the defendant was "returned
to the original place of imprisonment" before "trial" was"had." We conclude that Article IV(e) does bar further proceedings, despite the fact that the interruption of the initialimprisonment lasted for only one day.

Opinion of the Court
the problems that led to the Agreement's creation, namely,that

"charges outstanding against a prisoner, detainers basedon untried indictments, informations, or complaints and
difficulties in securing speedy trial of persons alreadyincarcerated in other jurisdictions, produce uncertainties which obstruct programs of prisoner treatmentand rehabilitation."

Article I then adds that "it is the . . . purpose of this agree-ment to encourage the expeditious and orderly disposition of
such charges and determination of the proper status of . . .detainers . . . ."

Article II sets forth definitions. Article III gives a pris-oner against whom a detainer has been lodged the right to
"request" a "final disposition" of the relevant charges, inwhich case "he shall be brought to trial within one hundred
and eighty days" (unless extended by the trial court for"good cause"); otherwise, the relevant "indictment, information, or complaint shall not be of any further force or effect,and the court shall enter an order dismissing the same with
prejudice." Art. III(a), (d).

Article IV gives "the jurisdiction in which an untried in-dictment, information, or complaint is pending,"

i. e., the receiving State, the right "to have a prisoner against whom"it "has lodged a detainer . . . made available" for trial.

Art. IV(a). It says further that, once the prisoner arrivesin the receiving State, the "trial" must begin "within one
hundred and twenty days" unless extended for "good cause."Art. IV(c). Article IV also sets forth the "antishuttling"
provision at issue here. To repeat: that provision says that
trial must be "had . . . prior to the prisoner's being returned
to the original place of imprisonment"; otherwise, the
charges "shall" be dismissed with prejudice. Art. IV(e).
Article V sets forth conditions on the receiving State obtaining temporary custody of the prisoner. The remaining arti533US1 Unit: $U72 [11-21-01 06:43:16] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
cles deal with subsidiary matters, not relevant here with oneexception: Article IX provides that the "agreement shall be

liberally construed so as to effectuate its purposes."For present purposes, it is important to keep in mind that
the Agreement basically (1) gives a prisoner the right to de-mand a trial within 180 days; and (2) gives a State the right
to obtain a prisoner for purposes of trial, in which case theState (a) must try the prisoner within 120 days of his arrival,
and (b) must not return the prisoner to his "original place ofimprisonment" prior to that trial.

B
In January 1997, respondent Michael Bozeman was servinga sentence of imprisonment for a federal drug crime in federal prison in Marianna, Florida. At the beginning of thatmonth, the district attorney of Covington County, Alabama,
who had earlier lodged a detainer against Bozeman in con-nection with charges related to discharging firearms, sought
temporary custody in order to arraign Bozeman on thosefirearms charges and secure the appointment of counsel. On
January 23, federal authorities released Bozeman to local of-ficials. Those officials took him to Covington County, about
80 miles from the federal prison, where he arrived later inthe day. Bozeman spent the night in the county jail, appeared in local court the next morning, obtained local ap-pointed counsel, and was transported back to federal prison
that evening. About one month later, Bozeman was broughtback to Covington County for trial.

At that time, Bozeman's local counsel filed a motion to dis-miss the state charges on the ground that in January Bozeman had been "returned to the original place of imprison-ment" (namely, the federal prison) "prior to" "trial" on state
charges being "had." See App. 37-42. Consequently, heargued, under Article IV(e) the state charges were without
"any further force or effect," and the local court had to"enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice."

152 ALABAMA v. BOZEMAN

Opinion of the Court
Bozeman was convicted, and the trial court subsequentlydenied Bozeman's motion for dismissal. It wrote that it

"made much sense to bring" Bozeman "into the countybriefly" to deal with "short pre-trial matters" and then to
"return him to the surroundings to which he was accus-tomed." App. to Pet. for Cert. 28a. Doing so furthered
Bozeman's "interest in maintaining . . . rehabilitation avail-able to him in federal prison."

Ibid. In the trial judge'sview, Bozeman "certainly would not [have] receive[d] much

rehabilitation in a county jail." Ibid. Consequently, thejudge concluded, the January transfer was "wholly consistent
with" the Agreement's goal, "to expedite the prosecution ofstate charges without interfering with any rehabilitative
programs of the federal government." Id., at 29a.An intermediate State Court of Appeals affirmed the
conviction. 738 So. 2d 934 (1998). But the Alabama StateSupreme Court reversed by a 5-to-3 vote. 781 So. 2d 165
(2000). In its view, the literal language of the Agreementcontrolled and required dismissal of the state charges. The
dissenters argued that the Agreement violation was merely"technical," and consequently did not require dismissal.

Id.,at 170. The State petitioned for certiorari. In light of

differences among the lower courts, we granted the writ.Compare, e. g., United States v. Schrum, 638 F. 2d 214, 215
(CA10 1981) (per curiam) (adopting District Court's literalinterpretation of Agreement), with United States v. Daniels,
3 F. 3d 25, 27-28 (CA1 1993) (rejecting literal interpretationof Agreement). And we now affirm the Alabama Supreme
Court's decision. II

Alabama does not deny a violation of Article IV(e) as liter-ally interpreted, for it concedes that its officials "returned"
Bozeman to his "original place of imprisonment," beforeBozeman's county court "trial" was "had." Nor does Alabama claim that Bozeman waived the right to trial beforereturn that Article IV provides. See Reply Brief for Peti533US1 Unit: $U72 [11-21-01 06:43:16] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tioner 1, n. 1. Cf. Hill, 528 U. S., at 114-115 (holding thatdefendant may waive his rights under Art. III of the Agreement). Rather, Alabama, supported by the United StatesSolicitor General and others, claims that Article IV(e)'s basic
purpose is to prevent shuttling that would interrupt the pris-oner's rehabilitation. See, e. g., United States v. Roy, 830
F. 2d 628, 636 (CA7 1987) (provision is "meant to protect theprisoner against endless interruption of the rehabilitation
programs because of criminal proceedings in other jurisdic-tions"). They say the one-day interruption that occurred
here did not interrupt rehabilitation significantly. Hence,any violation is "technical," "harmless," or "

de minimis."And Article IV(e) contains an implicit exception for such

trivial violations. Brief for Petitioner 26; Brief for UnitedStates as Amicus Curiae 12-13. Cf. Wisconsin Dept. of
Revenue v. William Wrigley, Jr., Co., 505 U. S. 214, 231(1992) (laws ordinarily are enacted with understanding that
de minimis exceptions will be recognized). We cannot ac-cept this argument, however, for two reasons.

A
First, the language of the Agreement militates against animplicit exception, for it is absolute. It says that, when a

prisoner is "returned" before trial, the indictment, informa-tion, or complaint "

shall not be of any further force or effect,and the court shall enter an order dismissing the same with

prejudice." Art. IV(e) (emphasis added). "The word `shall'is ordinarily `the language of command.' " Anderson v.
Yungkau, 329 U. S. 482, 485 (1947) (quoting Escoe v. Zerbst,295 U. S. 490, 493 (1935)).

The cases Alabama cites as supporting a "harmless error"construction involved statutes that lacked this absolute
language. See, e. g., United States v. Montalvo-Murillo,495 U. S. 711, 716-717 (1990) (Bail Reform Act "is silent
on the issue of a remedy for violations of its time limits").Cf.

William Wrigley, Jr., supra, at 231-232 (applying "de

154 ALABAMA v. BOZEMAN

Opinion of the Court
minimis exception" presumption as "part of the establishedbackground of legal principles against which all enactments are adopted," where text did not provide a "contraryindication").

Moreover, the Agreement makes no distinction among dif-ferent kinds of IV(c) "arrivals," say, by exempting those that
are followed by return within a short, specified period oftime, or those that are simply for the purpose of arraignment. Given the Agreement's language and the importantconsequences of starting the running of the 120-day time
limit, we see no basis for such a distinction. Hence, we mustassume that

every prisoner arrival in the receiving State,whether followed by a very brief stay or a very long

stay in the receiving State, triggers IV(e)'s "no return"requirement.

B
Second, even were we to assume for argument's sake thatthe Agreement exempts violations that, viewed in terms of

the Agreement's purposes, are de minimis, cf. Article IX(stating that Agreement "shall be liberally construed so as
to effectuate its purposes"), we could not say that the viola-tion at issue here qualifies as trivial. That is because the
purpose of the "no return" provision cannot be as Alabamaand the Solicitor General describe it, namely, as a simple,
direct effort to prevent the interruption of rehabilitation. Aprovision that prevents returning a prisoner who has arrived
in the receiving State does not directly increase the numberof days the prisoner will spend in rehabilitation in the sending State. Rather, it directly and intentionally decreasesthe number of days that prisoner will spend in the sending
State.This point is obvious once one keeps in mind that the trial
must take place within 120 days of the prisoner's arrival inthe receiving State. Article IV(e)'s requirement that the
prisoner remain in the county jail means that the prisonerwill spend all of those 120 days away from the sending

Opinion of the Court
State's rehabilitation programs. By contrast, returning the
prisoner prior to trial--in violation of Article IV(e)--would
permit the prisoner to participate in the sending State's program for some of those days. But to call such a violation
"technical," because it means fewer days spent away from
the sending State, is to call virtually every conceivable antishuttling violation "technical"--a circumstance which, like
the 13th chime of the clock, shows that Alabama's conception
of the provision's purpose is seriously flawed.

Article IV(e) may seek to remove obstructions to prisoner
rehabilitation in a different way. The Agreement not only
prevents "return," but it also requires the receiving State to
pay for the prisoner's incarceration in that State during the
period prior to trial. Art. V(h) ("From the time that a party
State receives custody of a prisoner pursuant to this agreement until such prisoner is returned to the territory and custody of the sending State, the [receiving] State . . . shall be
responsible for the prisoner and shall also pay all costs of
transporting, caring for, keeping, and returning the prisoner"). That requirement may provide the receiving State
with an incentive to shorten the pretrial period--to proceed
to trial faster than 120 days or not to seek extensions--thus
disposing of detainers, and the attendant "uncertainties
which obstruct programs of prisoner treatment and rehabilitation," in the most "expeditious" manner. Art. I. See also
Cuyler, 449 U. S., at 449 (discussing negative effects of detainers on prisoners). But if that is Article IV(e)'s purpose,
the transfer here was inconsistent with it. By returning
Bozeman to federal prison, the county saved itself the cost
of housing him--and for a nontrivial several week period,
which may have allowed it to delay resolving the detainer.

Alternatively, the Agreement's drafters may have thought
that the "shuttling" itself, i. e., the movement back and forth
among prisons, adds to the "uncertainties which obstruct
programs of prisoner treatment and rehabilitation." Art. I

Opinion of the Court
(emphasis added). And they may have sought to minimizethe number of "shuttles" for that reason alone.

Viewing the Agreement in terms of either purpose, wecannot say that the one-day violation here is de mimimis,
technical, or harmless. Neither do the briefs (or, to ourknowledge, any lower court opinion) point to any other
plausible rehabilitation-related purpose of Article IV(e) spe-cifically, in terms of which the violation here might count as
trivial. But we need not decide precisely what led Congressand the many other legislatures to agree to Article IV(e)'s
antishuttling remedy. Given the Agreement's absolute lan-guage, it is enough to explain why Alabama's view of the
Agreement's purpose is not plausible and to point to otherpurposes more easily squared with Article IV(e)'s text and
operation. C

Alabama and amici make additional claims, basically elab-orating on the trial court's view that return to the sending
State after a brief journey to the receiving State for pretrialpurposes is helpful, not harmful, to the prisoner. But given
Article IV's text, which indicates a contrary view, the partieswould more appropriately address these policy arguments
to legislatures.The Solicitor General also points to a federal statutory
provision that says expressly that an "order of a court dis-missing any indictment, information, or complaint may be
with or without prejudice," depending on the "seriousness ofthe offense," the "facts and circumstances of the case," and
the "impact of a reprosecution on the administration of theagreement" and "on the administration of justice." 18
U. S. C. App. $ 9(1), p. 695. This statutory provision, how-ever, governs only when "the United States is a receiving
State." $ 9. And here the United States is not the receiv-ing State. We fail to see how this provision helps, rather
than hurts, Alabama's cause. Although we reject Alabama'sinterpretation of the Agreement, our decision does not bar a

CEDRIC KUSHNER PROMOTIONS, LTD. v. KING

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe second circuit

No. 00-549. Argued April 18, 2001--Decided June 11, 2001
Petitioner, a corporate promoter of boxing matches, sued Don King, the

president and sole shareholder of a rival corporation, alleging that King
had conducted his corporation's affairs in violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), which makes it "unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise . . . to
conduct or participate . . . in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs
through a pattern of racketeering activity," 18 U. S. C. $ 1962(c). The
District Court, citing Circuit precedent, dismissed the complaint. In
affirming, the Second Circuit expressed its view that $ 1962(c) applies
only where a plaintiff shows the existence of two separate entities, a
"person" and a distinct "enterprise," the affairs of which that "person"
improperly conducts. In this instance, the court noted, it was undisputed that King was an employee of his corporation and also acting
within the scope of his authority. Under the court's analysis, King, in
a legal sense, was part of the corporation, not a "person," distinct from
the "enterprise," who allegedly improperly conducted the "enterprise's
affairs."

Held: In the circumstances of this case, $ 1962(c) requires no more than

the formal legal distinction between "person" and "enterprise" (namely,
incorporation); hence, the provision applies when a corporate employee
unlawfully conducts the affairs of the corporation of which he is the sole
owner--whether he conducts those affairs within the scope, or beyond
the scope, of corporate authority. This Court does not quarrel with the
basic principle that to establish liability under $ 1962(c) one must allege
and prove the existence of two distinct entities: (1) a "person"; and (2)
an "enterprise" that is not simply the same "person" referred to by a
different name. Nonetheless, the Court disagrees with the appellate
court's application of that "distinctness" principle to the present circumstances, in which a corporate employee, acting within the scope of

his authority, allegedly conducts the corporation's affairs in a RICOforbidden way. The corporate owner/employee, a natural person, is distinct from the corporation itself, a legally different entity with different
rights and responsibilities due to its different legal status. The Court
can find nothing in RICO that requires more "separateness" than that.

Syllabus
Linguistically speaking, an employee who conducts his corporation's affairs through illegal acts comes within $ 1962(c)'s terms forbidding any
"person" unlawfully to conduct an "enterprise," particularly when RICO
explicitly defines "person" to include "any individual . . . capable of holding a legal or beneficial interest in property," and defines "enterprise"
to include a "corporation," $$ 1961(3), (4). And, linguistically speaking,
the employee and the corporation are different "persons," even where
the employee is the corporation's sole owner. Incorporation's basic purpose is to create a legal entity distinct from those natural individuals
who created the corporation, who own it, or whom it employs. See,
e. g., United States v. Bestfoods, 524 U. S. 51, 61-62. The precedent on
which the Second Circuit relied involved significantly different circumstances from those here at issue. Further, to apply RICO in these circumstances is consistent with the statute's basic purposes of protecting
both a legitimate "enterprise" from those who would use unlawful acts
to victimize it, United States v. Turkette, 452 U. S. 576, 591, and the
public from those who would unlawfully use an "enterprise" (whether
legitimate or illegitimate) as a "vehicle" through which unlawful activity
is committed, National Organization for Women, Inc. v. Scheidler, 510
U. S. 249, 259. Conversely, the appellate court's critical legal distinction--between employees acting within and without the scope of corporate authority--would immunize from RICO liability many of those at
whom this Court has said RICO directly aims, e. g., high-ranking individuals in an illegitimate criminal enterprise, who, seeking to further
the enterprise's purposes, act within the scope of their authority,
cf. Turkette, supra, at 581. Finally, nothing in the statute's history significantly favors an alternative interpretation. This Court's rule is no
less consistent than is the lower court's rule with the following principles cited by King: (1) the principle that a corporation acts only through
its directors, officers, and agents; (2) the principle that a corporation
should not be liable for its employees' criminal acts where Congress
so intends; and (3) antitrust law's intracorporate conspiracy doctrine.

Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act(RICO or Act), 18 U. S. C. $ 1961

et seq., makes it "unlaw-ful for any person employed by or associated with any

enterprise . . . to conduct or participate . . . in the conduct ofsuch enterprise's affairs" through the commission of two or
more statutorily defined crimes--which RICO calls "a pat-tern of racketeering activity." $ 1962(c). The language
suggests, and lower courts have held, that this provisionforesees two separate entities, a "person" and a distinct
"enterprise."This case focuses upon a person who is the president and
sole shareholder of a closely held corporation. The plaintiffclaims that the president has conducted the corporation's
affairs through the forbidden "pattern," though for presentpurposes it is conceded that, in doing so, he acted within the
scope of his authority as the corporation's employee. Inthese circumstances, are there two entities, a "person" and
a separate "enterprise"? Assuming, as we must given theposture of this case, that the allegations in the complaint are
true, we conclude that the "person" and "enterprise" hereare distinct and that the RICO provision applies.

cate crimes. The District Court, citing Court of Appealsprecedent, dismissed the complaint. Civ. No. 98-6859, 1999

WL 771366, *3-4 (SDNY, Sept. 28, 1999). And the Court ofAppeals affirmed that dismissal. 219 F. 3d 115 (CA2 2000)
(per curiam). In the appellate court's view, $ 1962(c) appliesonly where a plaintiff shows the existence of two separate
entities, a "person" and a distinct "enterprise," the affairs of
which that "person" improperly conducts. Id., at 116. Inthis instance, "it is undisputed that King was an employee"

of the corporation Don King Productions and also "actingwithin the scope of his authority."

Id., at 117. Under the
Court of Appeals' analysis, King, in a legal sense, was partof, not separate from, the corporation. There was no "person," distinct from the "enterprise," who improperly con-ducted the "enterprise's affairs." And thus $ 1962(c) did not
apply. Ibid.Other Circuits, applying $ 1962(c) in roughly similar circumstances, have reached a contrary conclusion. See, e. g.,
Brannon v. Boatmen's First Nat. Bank of Okla., 153 F. 3d
1144, 1148, n. 4 (CA10 1998); Richmond v. Nationwide Cassel
L. P., 52 F. 3d 640, 647 (CA7 1995); Jaguar Cars, Inc. v. Royal
Oaks Motor Car Co., 46 F. 3d 258, 265, 269 (CA3 1995); Sever
v. Alaska Pulp Corp., 978 F. 2d 1529, 1534 (CA9 1992). We
granted certiorari to resolve the conflict. We now agree
with these Circuits and hold that the Second Circuit's interpretation of $ 1962(c) is erroneous.

We do not quarrel with the basic principle that to establish
liability under $ 1962(c) one must allege and prove the existence of two distinct entities: (1) a "person"; and (2) an "enterprise" that is not simply the same "person" referred to by
a different name. The statute's language, read as ordinary
English, suggests that principle. The Act says that it
applies to "person[s]" who are "employed by or associated
with" the "enterprise." $ 1962(c). In ordinary English one
speaks of employing, being employed by, or associating with
others, not oneself. See Webster's Third New International
Dictionary 132 (1993) (defining "associate"); id., at 743 (defin533US1 Unit: $U73 [10-21-02 15:12:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ing "employ"). In addition, the Act's purposes are consist-ent with that principle. Whether the Act seeks to prevent

a person from victimizing, say, a small business, S. Rep.No. 91-617, p. 77 (1969), or to prevent a person from using a
corporation for criminal purposes, National Organization
for Women, Inc. v. Scheidler, 510 U. S. 249, 259 (1994), the
person and the victim, or the person and the tool, are different entities, not the same.The Government reads $ 1962(c) "to require some distinctness between the RICO defendant and the RICO enter-prise." Brief for United States as

Amicus Curiae 11. And
it says that this requirement is "legally sound and workable." Ibid. We agree with its assessment, particularly
in light of the fact that 12 Courts of Appeals have interpreted the statute as embodying some such distinctness requirement without creating discernible mischief in the administration of RICO. See St. Paul Mercury Ins. Co. v.
Williamson, 224 F. 3d 425, 445 (CA5 2000); United States v.

denied, 531 U. S. 1050 (2001). Indeed, this Court previously
has said that liability "depends on showing that the defendants conducted or participated in the conduct of the `enterprise's affairs,' not just their own affairs." Reves v. Ernst &
Young, 507 U. S. 170, 185 (1993).

While accepting the "distinctness" principle, we nonetheless disagree with the appellate court's application of that
principle to the present circumstances--circumstances in
which a corporate employee, "acting within the scope of
his authority," 219 F. 3d, at 117, allegedly conducts the corporation's affairs in a RICO-forbidden way. The corporate
owner/employee, a natural person, is distinct from the corporation itself, a legally different entity with different rights
and responsibilities due to its different legal status. And
we can find nothing in the statute that requires more "separateness" than that. Cf. McCullough v. Suter, 757 F. 2d 142,
144 (CA7 1985) (finding either formal or practical separateness sufficient to be distinct under $ 1962(c)).

Linguistically speaking, an employee who conducts the affairs of a corporation through illegal acts comes within the
terms of a statute that forbids any "person" unlawfully to
conduct an "enterprise," particularly when the statute explicitly defines "person" to include "any individual . . . capable of holding a legal or beneficial interest in property," and
defines "enterprise" to include a "corporation." 18 U. S. C.

$$ 1961(3), (4). And, linguistically speaking, the employee
and the corporation are different "persons," even where the
employee is the corporation's sole owner. After all, incorporation's basic purpose is to create a distinct legal entity, with
legal rights, obligations, powers, and privileges different
from those of the natural individuals who created it, who own
it, or whom it employs. See United States v. Bestfoods, 524
U. S. 51, 61-62 (1998); Burnet v. Clark, 287 U. S. 410, 415
(1932); 1 W. Fletcher, Cyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations $$ 7, 14 (rev. ed. 1999).

164 CEDRIC KUSHNER PROMOTIONS, LTD. v. KING

Opinion of the Court
We note that the Second Circuit relied on earlier Circuitprecedent for its decision. But that precedent involved

quite different circumstances which are not presented here.This case concerns a claim that a corporate employee is the
"person" and the corporation is the "enterprise." It is natu-ral to speak of a corporate employee as a "person employed
by" the corporation. $ 1962(c). The earlier Second Circuit
precedent concerned a claim that a corporation was the "per-son" and the corporation, together with all its employees and

agents, were the "enterprise." See Riverwoods Chappaqua
Corp. v. Marine Midland Bank, N. A., 30 F. 3d 339, 344
(1994) (affirming dismissal of complaint). It is less natural
to speak of a corporation as "employed by" or "associated
with" this latter oddly constructed entity. And the Second
Circuit's other precedent also involved significantly different
allegations compared with the instant case. See Anatian
v. Coutts Bank (Switzerland) Ltd., 193 F. 3d 85, 89 (1999)
(affirming dismissal where plaintiff alleged that same bank
was both "person" and "enterprise"), cert. denied, 528 U. S.
1188 (2000); Discon, Inc. v. NYNEX Corp., 93 F. 3d 1055,
1064 (1996) (involving complaint alleging that corporate subsidiaries were "persons" and subsidiaries, taken together as
parent, were "enterprise"), vacated on other grounds, 525
U. S. 128 (1998); Bennett, supra, at 315, and n. 2 (same as
Anatian). We do not here consider the merits of these
cases, and note only their distinction from the instant case.

Further, to apply the RICO statute in present circumstances is consistent with the statute's basic purposes as this
Court has defined them. The Court has held that RICO
both protects a legitimate "enterprise" from those who
would use unlawful acts to victimize it, United States v. Turkette, 452 U. S. 576, 591 (1981), and also protects the public
from those who would unlawfully use an "enterprise"
(whether legitimate or illegitimate) as a "vehicle" through
which "unlawful . . . activity is committed," National
Organization for Women, Inc., supra, at 259. A corporate

533US1 Unit: $U73 [10-21-02 15:12:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN

165Cite as: 533 U. S. 158 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
employee who conducts the corporation's affairs through anunlawful RICO "pattern . . . of activity," $ 1962(c), uses that

corporation as a "vehicle" whether he is, or is not, its soleowner.

Conversely, the appellate court's critical legal distinction--between employees acting within the scope of corporate authority and those acting outside that authority--is inconsistent with a basic statutory purpose. Cf. Reves, supra, at 184(stating that an enterprise is " `operated,' " within $ 1962(c)'s

meaning, "not just by upper management but also by lowerrung participants in the enterprise

who are under the direction of upper management" (emphasis added)). It would
immunize from RICO liability many of those at whom this
Court has said RICO directly aims--e. g., high-ranking individuals in an illegitimate criminal enterprise, who, seeking
to further the purposes of that enterprise, act within the
scope of their authority. Cf. Turkette, supra, at 581 (Congress "did nothing to indicate that an enterprise consisting
of a group of individuals was not covered by RICO if the
purpose of the enterprise was exclusively criminal").

Finally, we have found nothing in the statute's history that
significantly favors an alternative interpretation. That history not only refers frequently to the importance of undermining organized crime's influence upon legitimate businesses but also refers to the need to protect the public from
those who would run "organization[s] in a manner detrimental to the public interest." S. Rep. No. 91-617, at 82. This
latter purpose, as we have said, invites the legal principle we
endorse, namely, that in present circumstances the statute
requires no more than the formal legal distinction between
"person" and "enterprise" (namely, incorporation) that is
present here.

In reply, King argues that the lower court's rule is consistent with (1) the principle that a corporation acts only
through its directors, officers, and agents, 1 Fletcher, supra,

$ 30, (2) the principle that a corporation should not be liable

533US1 Unit: $U73 [10-21-02 15:12:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN
166 CEDRIC KUSHNER PROMOTIONS, LTD. v. KING

Opinion of the Court
for the criminal acts of its employees where Congress so in-tends, Brief for Respondents 20-21, and (3) the Sherman Act

principle limiting liability under 15 U. S. C. $ 1 by excluding"from unlawful combinations or conspiracies the activities
of a single firm," Copperweld Corp. v. Independence TubeCorp., 467 U. S. 752, 769-770, n. 15 (1984). The alternative
that we endorse, however, is no less consistent with theseprinciples. It does not deny that a corporation acts through
its employees; it says only that the corporation and its em-ployees are not legally identical. It does not assert that
ordinary respondeat superior principles make a corporationlegally liable under RICO for the criminal acts of its employees; that is a matter of congressional intent not before us.See,

e. g., Gasoline Sales, Inc., 39 F. 3d, at 73 (holding thatcorporation cannot be "vicariously liable" for $ 1962(c) violations committed by its vice president). Neither is it incon-sistent with antitrust law's intracorporate conspiracy doctrine; that doctrine turns on specific antitrust objectives.See

Copperweld Corp., supra, at 770-771. Rather, we holdsimply that the need for two distinct entities is satisfied;

hence, the RICO provision before us applies when a corpo-rate employee unlawfully conducts the affairs of the corporation of which he is the sole owner--whether he conductsthose affairs within the scope, or beyond the scope, of corporate authority.For these reasons, the Court of Appeals' judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedingsconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

DUNCAN, SUPERINTENDENT, GREAT MEADOWCORRECTIONAL FACILITY

v. WALKER

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe second circuit

No. 00-121. Argued March 26, 2001--Decided June 18, 2001
The time during which an "application for State post-conviction or other

collateral review" is pending tolls the limitation period for filing federal
habeas petitions. 28 U. S. C. $ 2244(d)(2). Before the April 24, 1996,
effective date of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act
of 1996 (AEDPA), respondent's state robbery conviction became final.
He filed, inter alia, a federal habeas petition under $ 2254. The District Court dismissed the petition without prejudice because it was
not apparent that respondent had exhausted available state remedies.
On May 20, 1997, without having returned to state court, respondent
filed another federal habeas petition. The District Court dismissed
that petition because respondent had not filed within a reasonable
time from AEDPA's effective date. In reversing, the Second Circuit
found that respondent's first federal habeas petition was an application
for "other collateral review" that tolled the limitation period under

$ 2244(d)(2) and made his current petition timely.

Held: A federal habeas petition is not an "application for State postconviction or other collateral review" within the meaning of $ 2244(d)(2).
As a result, $ 2244(d)(2) did not toll the limitation period during the
pendency of respondent's first federal habeas petition. The Court begins with the language of the statute. See, e. g., Williams v. Taylor,
529 U. S. 420, 431. Petitioner's contention that "State" applies to the
entire phrase "post-conviction or other collateral review" is correct.
To begin with, Congress placed "State" before that phrase without specifically naming any kind of "Federal" review. The fact that other
AEDPA provisions denominate expressly both "State" and "Federal"
proceedings, see, e. g., $ 2254(i), supplies strong evidence that Congress
would have mentioned "Federal" review expressly had Congress intended to include federal review. See Bates v. United States, 522 U. S.
23, 29-30. Respondent's contrary construction would render the word
"State" insignificant, if not wholly superfluous. This Court's duty to
give effect, where possible, to every word of a statute, United States
v. Menasche, 348 U. S. 528, 538-539, makes the Court reluctant to
treat statutory terms as surplusage. This is especially so when the

Syllabus
term occupies so pivotal a place in the statutory scheme as the word
"State" in the federal habeas statute. But under respondent's rendition, "State" has no operative effect on the scope of $ 2244(d)(2). The
clause would have precisely the same content were it to read "postconviction or other collateral review." Contrary to the Second Circuit's characterization, petitioner's interpretation does not yield the
linguistic oddity "State other collateral review," but more naturally
yields the understanding "other State collateral review." Further,
that court's reasoning that the phrase "other collateral review" would
be rendered meaningless if it did not refer to federal habeas petitions depends on the incorrect premise that the only state "collateral"
review is "post-conviction" review. "[O]ther collateral review" could
include, e. g., a state court civil commitment or civil contempt order.
Congress also may have used "post-conviction or other collateral" in
recognition of the diverse terminology that different States employ
to represent the different forms of collateral review that are available after a conviction. Examination of the AEDPA provision establishing the limitation period for filing $ 2254 petitions in state capital
cases, $ 2263(b)(2), shows that Congress used the disjunctive clause
"post-conviction review or other collateral relief" where the latter term
could not possibly include anything federal within its ambit. Petitioner's construction is also far more consistent than respondent's with
AEDPA's purpose to further the principles of comity, finality, and federalism. Respondent contends that petitioner's interpretation creates
the potential for unfairness to litigants who file timely federal petitions
that are dismissed without prejudice after the limitation period has
expired. But the Court's sole task here is one of statutory construction.
And in light of the facts that respondent never cured the defects that
led to the dismissal of his first federal petition during the remaining
nine months of the limitation period, and that his 1996 and 1997 petitions contained different claims, this Court has no occasion to address
alternative scenarios. Pp. 172-182.

170 DUNCAN v. WALKER

Opinion of the Court
New York state courts. The last of these convictions came
in June 1992, when respondent pleaded guilty to robbery
in the first degree in the New York Supreme Court, Queens
County. Respondent was sentenced to 7 to 14 years in
prison on this conviction.

Respondent unsuccessfully pursued a number of state
remedies in connection with his convictions. It is unnecessary to describe all of these proceedings herein. Respondent's last conviction was affirmed on June 12, 1995. Respondent was later denied leave to appeal to the New York
Court of Appeals. Respondent also sought a writ of error
coram nobis, which the Appellate Division denied on March
18, 1996. Respondent's last conviction became final in April
1996, prior to the April 24, 1996, effective date of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA),
110 Stat. 1214.

In a single document dated April 10, 1996, respondent filed
a complaint under Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, and a
petition for habeas corpus under 28 U. S. C. $ 2254 in the
United States District Court for the Eastern District of
New York. On July 9, 1996, the District Court dismissed
the complaint and petition without prejudice. With respect
to the habeas petition, the District Court, citing $ 2254(b),
concluded that respondent had not adequately set forth his
claim because it was not apparent that respondent had exhausted available state remedies. The District Court noted
that, for example, respondent had failed to specify the claims
litigated in the state appellate proceedings relating to his
robbery convictions.

On May 20, 1997, more than one year after AEDPA's effective date, respondent filed another federal habeas petition in the same District Court. It is undisputed that respondent had not returned to state court since the dismissal
of his first federal habeas filing. On May 6, 1998, the District Court dismissed the petition as time barred because

Opinion of the Court
respondent had not filed the petition within a "reasonabletime" from AEDPA's effective date.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Cir-cuit reversed the District Court's judgment, reinstated the
habeas petition, and remanded the case for further pro-ceedings.

Walker v. Artuz, 208 F. 3d 357 (2000). The Court
of Appeals noted at the outset that, because respondent's
conviction had become final prior to AEDPA's effective date,he had until April 24, 1997, to file his federal habeas petition.

The court also observed that the exclusion from the limita-tion period of the time during which respondent's first federal habeas petition was pending in the District Court would
render the instant habeas petition timely.

The Court of Appeals held that respondent's first federal habeas petition had tolled the limitation period because
it was an application for "other collateral review" within
the meaning of $ 2244(d)(2). The court characterized the
disjunctive "or" between "post-conviction" and "other collateral" as creating a "distinct break" between two kinds
of review. Id., at 359. The court also stated that application of the word "State" to both "post-conviction" and "other
collateral" would create a "linguistic oddity" in the form of
the construction "State other collateral review." Id., at 360.
The court further reasoned that the phrase "other collateral
review" would be meaningless if it did not refer to federal
habeas petitions. The court therefore concluded that the
word "State" modified only "post-conviction."

The Court of Appeals also found no conflict between its
interpretation of the statute and the purpose of AEDPA.
The court found instead that its construction would promote the goal of encouraging petitioners to file their federal
habeas applications as soon as possible.

We granted certiorari, 531 U. S. 991 (2000), to resolve a
conflict between the Second Circuit's decision and the decisions of three other Courts of Appeals. See Jiminez v. Rice,
222 F. 3d 1210 (CA9 2000); Grooms v. Johnson, 208 F. 3d 488

the Second Circuit's view. Petrick v. Martin, 236 F. 3d 624(CA10 2001). We now reverse.

Our task is to construe what Congress has enacted. Webegin, as always, with the language of the statute. See, e. g.,

175 (1989); Watt v. Energy Action Ed. Foundation, 454 U. S.151, 162 (1981). Respondent reads $ 2244(d)(2) to apply the
word "State" only to the term "post-conviction" and notto the phrase "other collateral." Under this view, a properly filed federal habeas petition tolls the limitation period.Petitioner contends that the word "State" applies to the
entire phrase "post-conviction or other collateral review."Under this view, a properly filed federal habeas petition does
not toll the limitation period.We believe that petitioner's interpretation of $ 2244(d)(2)
is correct for several reasons. To begin with, Congressplaced the word "State" before "post-conviction or other
collateral review" without specifically naming any kind of"Federal" review. The essence of respondent's position is
that Congress used the phrase "other collateral review"to incorporate federal habeas petitions into the class of applications for review that toll the limitation period. But acomparison of the text of $ 2244(d)(2) with the language of
other AEDPA provisions supplies strong evidence that,had Congress intended to include federal habeas petitions
within the scope of $ 2244(d)(2), Congress would have men-tioned "Federal" review expressly. In several other portions of AEDPA, Congress specifically used both the words"State" and "Federal" to denote state and federal proceedings. For example, 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(i) (1994 ed., Supp. V)provides: "The ineffectiveness or incompetence of counsel

Opinion of the Court
during Federal or State collateral post-conviction proceed-ings shall not be a ground for relief in a proceeding arising

under section 2254." Likewise, the first sentence of 28U. S. C. $ 2261(e) (1994 ed., Supp. V) provides: "The ineffectiveness or incompetence of counsel during State or Federalpost-conviction proceedings in a capital case shall not be a
ground for relief in a proceeding arising under section 2254."
The second sentence of $ 2261(e) states: "This limitation shallnot preclude the appointment of different counsel, on the

court's own motion or at the request of the prisoner, at anyphase of State or Federal post-conviction proceedings on
the basis of the ineffectiveness or incompetence of counsel
in such proceedings." Finally, 28 U. S. C. $ 2264(a)(3) (1994
ed., Supp. V) excuses a state capital prisoner's failure to raise
a claim properly in state court where the failure is "based
on a factual predicate that could not have been discovered
through the exercise of due diligence in time to present the
claim for State or Federal post-conviction review."

Section 2244(d)(2), by contrast, employs the word "State,"
but not the word "Federal," as a modifier for "review." It
is well settled that " `[w]here Congress includes particular
language in one section of a statute but omits it in another
section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.' " Bates v. United States, 522 U. S. 23,
29-30 (1997) (quoting Russello v. United States, 464 U. S.
16, 23 (1983)). We find no likely explanation for Congress'
omission of the word "Federal" in $ 2244(d)(2) other than
that Congress did not intend properly filed applications for
federal review to toll the limitation period. It would be
anomalous, to say the least, for Congress to usher in federal
review under the generic rubric of "other collateral review"
in a statutory provision that refers expressly to "State"
review, while denominating expressly both "State" and
"Federal" proceedings in other parts of the same statute.
The anomaly is underscored by the fact that the words

533US1 Unit: $U74 [10-17-02 19:11:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN
174 DUNCAN v. WALKER

Opinion of the Court
"State" and "Federal" are likely to be of no small importwhen Congress drafts a statute that governs federal collateral review of state court judgments.Further, were we to adopt respondent's construction of
the statute, we would render the word "State" insignifi-cant, if not wholly superfluous. "It is our duty `to give
effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute.' "
United States v. Menasche, 348 U. S. 528, 538-539 (1955)(quoting

Montclair v. Ramsdell, 107 U. S. 147, 152 (1883));
see also Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 404 (2000) (de-scribing this rule as a "cardinal principle of statutory construction"); Market Co. v. Hoffman, 101 U. S. 112, 115 (1879)
("As early as in Bacon's Abridgment, sect. 2, it was said
that `a statute ought, upon the whole, to be so construed
that, if it can be prevented, no clause, sentence, or word
shall be superfluous, void, or insignificant' "). We are thus
"reluctan[t] to treat statutory terms as surplusage" in any
setting. Babbitt v. Sweet Home Chapter, Communities for
Great Ore., 515 U. S. 687, 698 (1995); see also Ratzlaf v.
United States, 510 U. S. 135, 140 (1994). We are especially
unwilling to do so when the term occupies so pivotal a place
in the statutory scheme as does the word "State" in the
federal habeas statute. But under respondent's rendition
of $ 2244(d)(2), Congress' inclusion of the word "State" has no
operative effect on the scope of the provision. If the phrase
"State post-conviction or other collateral review" is construed to encompass both state and federal collateral review, then the word "State" places no constraint on the class
of applications for review that toll the limitation period.
The clause instead would have precisely the same content
were it to read "post-conviction or other collateral review."

The most that could then be made of the word "State"
would be to say that Congress singled out applications for
"State post-conviction" review as one example from the
universe of applications for collateral review. Under this
approach, however, the word "State" still does nothing to

Opinion of the Court
delimit the entire class of applications for review that tollthe limitation period. A construction under which the word

"State" does nothing more than further modify "post-conviction" relegates "State" to quite an insignificant role
in the statutory provision. We believe that our duty to"give each word some operative effect" where possible,

Walters v. Metropolitan Ed. Enterprises, Inc., 519 U. S. 202, 209
(1997), requires more in this context.The Court of Appeals characterized petitioner's interpretation as producing the "linguistic oddity" of "State othercollateral review," which is "an ungainly construction that
[the Court of Appeals did] not believe Congress intended."
208 F. 3d, at 360. But nothing precludes the application
of the word "State" to the entire phrase "post-conviction
or other collateral review," regardless of the resulting construction that one posits. The term "other collateral" is
easily understood as a unit to which "State" applies just
as "State" applies to "post-conviction." Moreover, petitioner's interpretation does not compel the verbal formula hypothesized by the Court of Appeals. Indeed, the ungainliness of "State other collateral review" is a very good reason
why Congress might have avoided that precise verbal formulation in the first place. The application of the word "State"
to the phrase "other collateral review" more naturally yields
the understanding "other State collateral review."

The Court of Appeals also reasoned that petitioner's
reading of the statute fails to give operative effect to the
phrase "other collateral review." The court claimed that
"the phrase `other collateral review' would be meaningless
if it did not refer to federal habeas petitions." Ibid. This
argument, however, fails because it depends on the incorrect premise that there can be no form of state "collateral"
review "other" than state "post-conviction" review within
the meaning of $ 2244(d)(2). To the contrary, it is possible
for "other collateral review" to include review of a state
court judgment that is not a criminal conviction.

176 DUNCAN v. WALKER

Opinion of the Court
Section 2244(d)(1)'s 1-year limitation period applies to"an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in

custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court." Sec-tion 2244(d)(2) provides for tolling during the pendency of
"a properly filed application for State post-conviction orother collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim." Nothing in the language of these provisions
requires that the state court judgment pursuant to which aperson is in custody be a criminal conviction. Nor does 28

U. S. C. $ 2254 (1994 ed. and Supp. V) by its terms apply onlyto those in custody pursuant to a state criminal conviction.
See, e. g., $ 2254(a) ("a person in custody pursuant to the
judgment of a State court"); $ 2254(b)(1) ("a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court"); $ 2254(d)
("a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State
court"); $ 2254(e)(1) ("a person in custody pursuant to the
judgment of a State court").

Incarceration pursuant to a state criminal conviction may
be by far the most common and most familiar basis for satisfaction of the "in custody" requirement in $ 2254 cases.
But there are other types of state court judgments pursuant
to which a person may be held in custody within the meaning
of the federal habeas statute. For example, federal habeas
corpus review may be available to challenge the legality of a
state court order of civil commitment or a state court order
of civil contempt. See, e. g., Francois v. Henderson, 850 F.
2d 231 (CA5 1988) (entertaining a challenge brought in a
federal habeas petition under $ 2254 to a state court's commitment of a person to a mental institution upon a verdict
of not guilty by reason of insanity); Leonard v. Hammond,
804 F. 2d 838 (CA4 1986) (holding that constitutional challenges to civil contempt orders for failure to pay child support were cognizable only in a habeas corpus action). These
types of state court judgments neither constitute nor require criminal convictions. Any state collateral review that
is available with respect to these judgments, strictly speak533US1 Unit: $U74 [10-17-02 19:11:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN

177Cite as: 533 U. S. 167 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
ing, is not post-conviction review. Accordingly, even if" ` "State post-conviction review" means all collateral review of a conviction provided by a state,' " 208 F. 3d, at 360(quoting

Barrett v. Yearwood, 63 F. Supp. 2d 1245, 1250
(ED Cal. 1999)), the phrase "other collateral review" neednot include federal habeas petitions in order to have independent meaning.

Congress also may have employed the construction "post-conviction or other collateral" in recognition of the diverse terminology that different States employ to representthe different forms of collateral review that are available
after a conviction. In some jurisdictions, the term "postconviction" may denote a particular procedure for review
of a conviction that is distinct from other forms of what
conventionally is considered to be postconviction review.
For example, Florida employs a procedure that is officially
entitled a "Motion to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Sentence." Fla. Rule Crim. Proc. 3.850 (2001). The Florida
courts have commonly referred to a Rule 3.850 motion as a
"motion for post-conviction relief " and have distinguished
this procedure from other vehicles for collateral review of
a criminal conviction, such as a state petition for habeas
corpus. See, e. g., Bryant v. State, 780 So. 2d 978, 979 (Fla.
App. 2001) ("[A] petition for habeas corpus cannot be used
to circumvent the two-year period for filing motions for
post-conviction relief "); Finley v. State, 394 So. 2d 215,
216 (Fla. App. 1981) ("[T]he remedy of habeas corpus is
not available as a substitute for post-conviction relief under
Rule 3.850"). Congress may have refrained from exclusive
reliance on the term "post-conviction" so as to leave no doubt
that the tolling provision applies to all types of state collateral review available after a conviction and not just to
those denominated "post-conviction" in the parlance of a
particular jurisdiction.

Examination of another AEDPA provision also demonstrates that "other collateral" need not refer to any form of

533US1 Unit: $U74 [10-17-02 19:11:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN
178 DUNCAN v. WALKER

Opinion of the Court
federal review in order to have meaning. Title 28 U. S. C.

$ 2263 (1994 ed., Supp. V) establishes the limitation period
for filing $ 2254 petitions in state capital cases that arise from
jurisdictions meeting the "opt-in" requirements of $ 2261.
Section 2263(b)(2) provides that the limitation period "shall
be tolled from the date on which the first petition for postconviction review or other collateral relief is filed until the
final State court disposition of such petition." The reference to "the final State court disposition of such petition"
makes it clear that only petitions filed in state court, and
not petitions for federal review, toll the limitation period in
capital cases. Congress therefore used the phrases "postconviction review" and "other collateral relief " in a disjunctive clause where the term "other collateral," whatever its
precise content, could not possibly include anything federal
within its ambit. This illustration vitiates any suggestion
that "other collateral" relief or review must include federal
relief or review in order for the term to have any significance
apart from "post-conviction" review.

Consideration of the competing constructions in light of
AEDPA's purposes reinforces the conclusion that we draw
from the text. Petitioner's interpretation of the statute
is consistent with "AEDPA's purpose to further the principles of comity, finality, and federalism." Williams, 529
U. S., at 436. Specifically, under petitioner's construction,

$ 2244(d)(2) promotes the exhaustion of state remedies while
respecting the interest in the finality of state court judgments. Under respondent's interpretation, however, the
provision would do far less to encourage exhaustion prior
to seeking federal habeas review and would hold greater
potential to hinder finality.

The exhaustion requirement of $ 2254(b) ensures that the
state courts have the opportunity fully to consider federallaw challenges to a state custodial judgment before the lower
federal courts may entertain a collateral attack upon that

533US1 Unit: $U74 [10-17-02 19:11:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
judgment. See, e. g., O'Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U. S. 838,
845 (1999) ("[T]he exhaustion doctrine is designed to give
the state courts a full and fair opportunity to resolve federal
constitutional claims before those claims are presented to the
federal courts"); Rose v. Lundy, 455 U. S. 509, 518-519 (1982)
("A rigorously enforced total exhaustion rule will encourage
state prisoners to seek full relief first from the state courts,
thus giving those courts the first opportunity to review all
claims of constitutional error"). This requirement "is principally designed to protect the state courts' role in the
enforcement of federal law and prevent disruption of state
judicial proceedings." Id., at 518. The exhaustion rule
promotes comity in that " `it would be unseemly in our dual
system of government for a federal district court to upset a
state court conviction without an opportunity to the state
courts to correct a constitutional violation.' " Ibid. (quoting
Darr v. Burford, 339 U. S. 200, 204 (1950)); see also O'Sullivan, supra, at 844 ("Comity thus dictates that when a prisoner alleges that his continued confinement for a state court
conviction violates federal law, the state courts should have
the first opportunity to review this claim and provide any
necessary relief ").

The 1-year limitation period of $ 2244(d)(1) quite plainly
serves the well-recognized interest in the finality of state
court judgments. See generally Calderon v. Thompson, 523
U. S. 538, 555-556 (1998). This provision reduces the potential for delay on the road to finality by restricting the time
that a prospective federal habeas petitioner has in which to
seek federal habeas review.

The tolling provision of $ 2244(d)(2) balances the interests served by the exhaustion requirement and the limitation period. Section 2244(d)(2) promotes the exhaustion of
state remedies by protecting a state prisoner's ability later
to apply for federal habeas relief while state remedies are
being pursued. At the same time, the provision limits the

180 DUNCAN v. WALKER

Opinion of the Court
harm to the interest in finality by according tolling effectonly to "properly filed application[s] for State post-conviction

or other collateral review."By tolling the limitation period for the pursuit of state
remedies and not during the pendency of applications forfederal review, $ 2244(d)(2) provides a powerful incentive
for litigants to exhaust all available state remedies before
proceeding in the lower federal courts. But if the statutewere construed so as to give applications for federal review the same tolling effect as applications for state col-lateral review, then $ 2244(d)(2) would furnish little incentive
for individuals to seek relief from the state courts before
filing federal habeas petitions. The tolling provision instead would be indifferent between state and federal filings.
While other statutory provisions, such as $ 2254(b) itself, of
course, would still provide individuals with good reason to
exhaust, $ 2244(d)(2) would be out of step with this design.
At the same time, respondent's interpretation would further
undermine the interest in finality by creating more potential
for delay in the adjudication of federal law claims.

A diminution of statutory incentives to proceed first in
state court would also increase the risk of the very piecemeal litigation that the exhaustion requirement is designed
to reduce. Cf. Rose, 455 U. S., at 520. We have observed
that "strict enforcement of the exhaustion requirement will
encourage habeas petitioners to exhaust all of their claims in
state court and to present the federal court with a single
habeas petition." Ibid. But were we to adopt respondent's construction of $ 2244(d)(2), we would dilute the efficacy
of the exhaustion requirement in achieving this objective.
Tolling the limitation period for a federal habeas petition
that is dismissed without prejudice would thus create more
opportunities for delay and piecemeal litigation without advancing the goals of comity and federalism that the exhaustion requirement serves. We do not believe that Congress
designed the statute in this manner.

Opinion of the Court
The Court of Appeals reasoned that its interpretationof the statute would further Congress' goal "to spur defendants to file their federal habeas petitions more quickly."208 F. 3d, at 361. But this view fails to account sufficiently
for AEDPA's clear purpose to encourage litigants to pur-sue claims in state court prior to seeking federal collateral
review. See, e. g., $$ 2254(b), 2254(e)(2), 2264(a). Section
2244(d)(1)'s limitation period and $ 2244(d)(2)'s tolling pro-vision, together with $ 2254(b)'s exhaustion requirement, encourage litigants first to exhaust all state remedies and thento file their federal habeas petitions as soon as possible.

Respondent contends that petitioner's construction of the
statute creates the potential for unfairness to litigants who
file timely federal habeas petitions that are dismissed without prejudice after the limitation period has expired. But
our sole task in this case is one of statutory construction,
and upon examining the language and purpose of the statute,
we are convinced that $ 2244(d)(2) does not toll the limitation
period during the pendency of a federal habeas petition.

We also note that, when the District Court dismissed respondent's first federal habeas petition without prejudice,
respondent had more than nine months remaining in the
limitation period in which to cure the defects that led to
the dismissal. It is undisputed, however, that petitioner neither returned to state court nor filed a nondefective federal
habeas petition before this time had elapsed. Respondent's
May 1997 federal habeas petition also contained claims different from those presented in his April 1996 petition. In
light of these facts, we have no occasion to address the alternative scenarios that respondent describes. We also have
no occasion to address the question that Justice Stevens
raises concerning the availability of equitable tolling.

We hold that an application for federal habeas corpus
review is not an "application for State post-conviction or
other collateral review" within the meaning of 28 U. S. C.

$ 2244(d)(2). Section 2244(d)(2) therefore did not toll the

limitation period during the pendency of respondent's firstfederal habeas petition. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further pro-ceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.
Justice Souter, concurring.
Although I join the Court's opinion in full, I have joined
Justice Stevens's separate opinion pointing out thatnothing bars a district court from retaining jurisdiction

pending complete exhaustion of state remedies, and thata claim for equitable tolling could present a serious issue
on facts different from those before us.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Souter joins,
concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.

For substantially the reasons stated in the Court's opinion,
ante, at 172-178, I agree that the better reading of 28 U. S. C.$ 2244(d)(2) (1994 ed., Supp. V) is that it encompasses only

"State" applications for "post-conviction or other collateralreview." Thus, as the Court holds, "an application for federal habeas corpus review is not an `application for Statepost-conviction or other collateral review' within the meaning of 28 U. S. C. $ 2244(d)(2)." Ante, at 181. I write separately to add two observations regarding the equitablepowers of the federal courts, which are unaffected by today's

decision construing a single provision of the Antiterror-ism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110
Stat. 1214.First, although the Court's pre-AEDPA decision in

Rose
v. Lundy, 455 U. S. 509, 522 (1982), prescribed the dismissalof federal habeas corpus petitions containing unexhausted

claims, in our post-AEDPA world there is no reason why adistrict court should not retain jurisdiction over a meritorious claim and stay further proceedings pending the complete

533US1 Unit: $U74 [10-17-02 19:11:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN

183Cite as: 533 U. S. 167 (2001)
Opinion of Stevens, J.
exhaustion of state remedies. Indeed, there is every reasonto do so when AEDPA gives a district court the alternative of simply denying a petition containing unexhausted butnonmeritorious claims, see 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(b)(2) (1994 ed.,
Supp. V), and when the failure to retain jurisdiction wouldforeclose federal review of a meritorious claim because of the
lapse of AEDPA's 1-year limitations period.Second, despite the Court's suggestion that tolling the
limitations period for a first federal habeas petition wouldundermine the "purposes" of AEDPA, see

ante, at 178-182,neither the Court's narrow holding, nor anything in the text

or legislative history of AEDPA, precludes a federal courtfrom deeming the limitations period tolled for such a petition as a matter of equity. The Court's opinion does not ad-dress a federal court's ability to toll the limitations period
apart from $ 2244(d)(2). See ante, at 181. Furthermore, afederal court might very well conclude that tolling is appropriate based on the reasonable belief that Congress could nothave intended to bar federal habeas review for petitioners
who invoke the court's jurisdiction within the 1-year interval
prescribed by AEDPA.After all, federal habeas corpus has evolved as the product of both judicial doctrine and statutory law. See gener-ally E. Chemerinsky, Federal Jurisdiction $ 15 (3d ed. 1999).
In the context of AEDPA's 1-year limitations period, whichby its terms runs from "the date on which the judgment
became final," see $ 2244(d)(1)(A), the Courts of Appeals haveuniformly created a 1-year grace period, running from the
date of AEDPA's enactment, for prisoners whose state con-victions became final prior to AEDPA.

Opinion of Stevens, J.
courts may well conclude that Congress simply overlooked
the class of petitioners whose timely filed habeas petitions
remain pending in district court past the limitations period,
only to be dismissed after the court belatedly realizes that
one or more claims have not been exhausted.2 See post, at
186 (Breyer, J., dissenting) (district courts on average take
268 days to dismiss petitions on procedural grounds; 10% remain pending more than 2 years). As a result, equitable
considerations may make it appropriate for federal courts
to fill in a perceived omission on the part of Congress by
tolling AEDPA's statute of limitations for unexhausted federal habeas petitions. Today's ruling does not preclude that
possibility, given the limited issue presented in this case and
the Court's correspondingly limited holding.3

I concur in the Court's holding on the understanding that
it does not foreclose either of the above safeguards against
the potential for injustice that a literal reading of $ 2244(d)(2)
might otherwise produce.

866 (CA7 1996) (en banc), rev'd on other grounds, 521 U. S. 320 (1997); Ford
v. Bowersox, 178 F. 3d 522, 523 (CA8 1999); Calderon v. District Court,
128 F. 3d 1283, 1286-1287 (CA9 1997), overruled on other grounds, 163 F.

(CA10 1998); Wilcox v. Florida Dept. of Corrections, 158 F. 3d 1209, 1211
(CA11 1998).

2 The question whether a claim has been exhausted can often be a difficult one, not just for prisoners unschooled in the immense complexities
of federal habeas corpus law, see post, at 190-191 (Breyer, J., dissenting),
but also for district courts, see, e. g., Morgan v. Bennett, 204 F. 3d 360,
369-371 (CA2 2000) (disagreeing with District Court's conclusion that
claim had not been exhausted); Bear v. Boone, 173 F. 3d 782, 784-785
(CA10 1999) (same).

3 Thus the court below, which resolved the case based on its reading

of 28 U. S. C. $ 2244(d)(2) (1994 ed., Supp. V), and which therefore did not
reach the question whether it "should exercise its equitable powers to
exclude the [time] during which the first [habeas] petition was pending,"
208 F. 3d 357, 362 (CA2 2000), is free to consider the issue on remand.

The federal habeas corpus statute limits the period of timeduring which a state prisoner may file a federal habeas petition to one year, ordinarily running from the time the pris-oner's conviction becomes final in the state courts. See 28
U. S. C. $ 2244(d) (1994 ed., Supp. V). Section 2244(d)(2) tollsthat 1-year period while "a properly filed application for
State post-conviction or other collateral review . . . is pend-ing." The question before us is whether this tolling provision applies to federal, as well as state, collateral review
proceedings. Do the words "other collateral review" en-compass federal habeas corpus proceedings? I believe that

they do.To understand my conclusion, one must understand why
the legal issue before us is significant. Why would a stateprisoner ever want federal habeas corpus proceedings to toll
the federal habeas corpus limitations period? After all, thevery point of tolling is to provide a state prisoner adequate
time to file a federal habeas petition. If the prisoner hasalready filed that petition, what need is there for further
tolling?The answer to this question--and the problem that gives
rise to the issue before us--is that a federal court may be
required to dismiss a state prisoner's federal habeas peti-tion, not on the merits, but because that prisoner has not

exhausted his state collateral remedies for every claim pre-sented in the federal petition. See 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(b)(1)
(1994 ed., Supp. V) (requiring petitioners to exhaust stateremedies before filing federal habeas petition); cf.

Rose v.
Lundy, 455 U. S. 509, 510 (1982) (holding, under predeces-sor to current $ 2254, that district courts cannot reach the

merits of "mixed" petitions containing both exhausted andunexhausted claims). Such a dismissal means that a prisoner wishing to pursue the claim must return to state court,

Breyer, J., dissenting
pursue his state remedies, and then, if he loses, again file afederal habeas petition in federal court. All this takes time.

The statute tolls the 1-year limitations period during thetime the prisoner proceeds in the state courts. But unless
the statute also tolls the limitations period during the timethe defective petition was pending in federal court, the state
prisoner may find, when he seeks to return to federal court,
that he has run out of time.This possibility is not purely theoretical. A Justice Department study indicates that 63% of all habeas petitionsare dismissed, and 57% of those are dismissed for failure to
exhaust state remedies. See U. S. Dept. of Justice, Office
of Justice Programs, Bureau of Justice Statistics, Federal
Habeas Corpus Review: Challenging State Court Criminal
Convictions 17 (1995) (hereinafter Federal Habeas Corpus
Review). And it can take courts a significant amount of
time to dispose of even those petitions that are not addressed
on the merits; on the average, district courts took 268 days
to dismiss petitions on procedural grounds. Id., at 23-24;
see also id., at 19 (of all habeas petitions, nearly half were
pending in the district court for six months or longer; 10%
were pending more than two years). Thus, if the words
"other collateral review" do not include federal collateral
review, a large group of federal habeas petitioners, seeking to return to federal court after subsequent state-court
rejection of an unexhausted claim, may find their claims
time barred. Moreover, because district courts vary substantially in the time they take to rule on habeas petitions,
two identically situated prisoners can receive opposite results. If Prisoner A and Prisoner B file mixed petitions in
different district courts six months before the federal limitations period expires, and the court takes three months
to dismiss Prisoner A's petition, but seven months to dismiss Prisoner B's petition, Prisoner A will be able to return to federal court after exhausting state remedies, but
Prisoner B--due to no fault of his own--may not.

On the other hand, if the words "other collateral review"include federal collateral review, state prisoners whose federal claims have been dismissed for nonexhaustion willsimply add to the 1-year limitations period the time they
previously spent in both state and federal proceedings.Other things being equal, they will be able to return to federal court after pursuing the state remedies that remain
available. And similarly situated prisoners will not sufferdifferent outcomes simply because they file their petitions

in different district courts.The statute's language, read by itself, does not tell us
whether the words "State post-conviction or other collateral review" include federal habeas proceedings. Rather,
it is simply unclear whether Congress intended the word
"State" to modify "post-conviction" review alone, or also to
modify "other collateral review" (as the majority believes).
Indeed, most naturally read, the statute refers to two distinct kinds of applications: (1) applications for "State postconviction" review and (2) applications for "other collateral
review," a broad category that, on its face, would include
applications for federal habeas review. The majority's reading requires either an unusual intonation--"State postconviction-or-other-collateral review"--or a slight rewrite of
the language, by inserting the word "State" where it does
not appear, between "other" and "collateral." Regardless, I
believe that either reading is possible. The statute's words,
by themselves, have no singular "plain meaning."

Neither do I believe that the various interpretive canons
to which the majority appeals can solve the problem. Invoking the principle that " `Congress acts intentionally and
purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion' " of particular words, Bates v. United States, 522 U. S. 23, 29-30 (1997)
(quoting Russello v. United States, 464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983)),
the majority attempts to ascertain Congress' intent by looking to the tolling provision's statutory neighbors. It points
to other provisions where Congress explicitly used the

533US1 Unit: $U74 [10-17-02 19:11:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN
188 DUNCAN v. WALKER

Breyer, J., dissenting
words "State" and "Federal" together, expressing its intentto cover both kinds of proceedings. See

ante, at 172-173
(citing 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(i) (1994 ed., Supp. V); $ 2261(e);$ 2264(a)(3)). And it reasons that Congress' failure to do so

here displays a different intent.But other statutory neighbors show that, when Congress
wished unambiguously to limit tolling to state proceedings,
"it knew how to do so." Custis v. United States, 511 U. S.485, 492 (1994). In the special tolling provision governing

certain capital cases, Congress said explicitly that the limi-tations period is tolled "from the date on which the first
petition for post-conviction review or other collateral relief
is filed until the final State court disposition of such petition," thus making it clear that federal proceedings, for
example, petitions for certiorari, do not count. 28 U. S. C.

$ 2263(b)(2) (1994 ed., Supp. V) (emphasis added). Does Congress' failure to include a similar qualification in $ 2244's
tolling provision show that it means that provision to cover
both federal and state proceedings? In fact, the "argument from neighbors" shows only that Congress might have
spoken more clearly than it did. It cannot prove the statutory point.

The majority also believes that only its interpretation
gives effect to every word in the statute--in particular the
word "State." It asks: If Congress meant to cover federal
habeas review, why does the word "State" appear in the
statute? Federal habeas proceedings are a form of postconviction proceedings. So, had Congress meant to cover
them, it would have just said "post-conviction and other
collateral review." See ante, at 174.

But this argument proves too much, for one can ask with
equal force: If Congress intended to exclude federal habeas
proceedings, why does the word "post-conviction" appear
in the statute? State postconviction proceedings are a form
of collateral review. So, had Congress meant to exclude federal collateral proceedings, it could have just said "State col533US1 Unit: $U74 [10-17-02 19:11:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN

189Cite as: 533 U. S. 167 (2001)
Breyer, J., dissenting
lateral review," thereby clearly indicating that the phraseapplies only to state proceedings.

In fact, this kind of argument, viewed realistically, getsus nowhere. Congress probably picked out "State postconviction" proceedings from the universe of collateral pro-ceedings and mentioned it separately because state postconviction proceedings are a salient example of collateral
proceedings. But to understand this is not to understandwhether the universe from which Congress picked "State

post-conviction" proceedings as an example is the universe of
all collateral proceedings, or the universe of state collateral
proceedings. The statute simply does not say.

Indeed, the majority recognizes that neither the statute's
language nor the application of canons of construction is
sufficient to resolve the problem. It concedes that the
phrase "other collateral review," if construed as "other
[state] collateral review," would add little to the coverage
that the words "State post-conviction . . . review" would
provide in its absence. See ante, at 176 (noting that a state
criminal conviction is "by far the most common" basis for
seeking federal habeas review). The majority resolves this
difficulty by noting that "other collateral review" could
also include either review of state civil confinement proceedings or state postconviction review to which a State refers by some other name, such as state "habeas" proceedings.
See ante, at 176-177.

But it is difficult to believe that Congress had state civil
proceedings in mind, given that other provisions within

$ 2244 indicate that Congress saw criminal proceedings as
its basic subject matter. For instance, the exceptions to
the bar against successive petitions in $ 2244(d) seem to presume that the petition at issue challenges a criminal conviction. See 28 U. S. C. $ 2244(b)(2)(A) (1994 ed., Supp. V)
(requiring a "new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court");

$ 2244(b)(2)(B) (requiring new evidence establishing that,

533US1 Unit: $U74 [10-17-02 19:11:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN
190 DUNCAN v. WALKER

Breyer, J., dissenting
"but for constitutional error, no reasonable factfinder wouldhave found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense").

Nor does it seem likely that Congress would have expectedfederal courts applying the tolling provision to construe
"post-conviction" review to exclude state "habeas" petitionschallenging convictions. The statute in which the words
"State post-conviction proceedings" appear is a federal statute, and federal courts would be likely to apply those wordsto whatever state proceedings in fact fall within this federal

description, whatever different labels different States mightchoose to attach. It is simpler, more meaningful, and just
as logical to assume that Congress meant the words "other
collateral review" to cast a wider net--a net wide enough
to include federal collateral proceedings such as those that
precede a dismissal for nonexhaustion.

Faced with this statutory ambiguity, I would look to statutory purposes in order to reach a proper interpretation.
And, while I agree that Congress sought to " `further the
principles of comity, finality, and federalism,' " ante, at 178
(quoting Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 420, 436 (2000)),
I would also ask whether Congress would have intended
to create the kind of "unexhausted petition" problem that
I described at the outset. The answer is no. Congress enacted a statute that all agree gave state prisoners a full year
(plus the duration of state collateral proceedings) to file a
federal habeas corpus petition. Congress would not have
intended to shorten that time dramatically, at random, and
perhaps erase it altogether, "den[ying] the petitioner the
protections of the Great Writ entirely," Lonchar v. Thomas,
517 U. S. 314, 324 (1996), simply because the technical nature
of the habeas rules led a prisoner initially to file a petition
in the wrong court.

The majority's argument assumes a congressional desire
to strengthen the prisoners' incentive to file in state court
first. But that is not likely to be the result of today's
holding. After all, virtually every state prisoner already

533US1 Unit: $U74 [10-17-02 19:11:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN

191Cite as: 533 U. S. 167 (2001)
Breyer, J., dissenting
knows that he must first exhaust state-court remedies; andI imagine that virtually all of them now try to do so. The

problem arises because the vast majority of federal habeaspetitions are brought without legal representation. See
Federal Habeas Corpus Review 14 (finding that 93% of ha-beas petitioners in study were

pro se). Prisoners acting
pro se will often not know whether a change in wording
between state and federal petitions will be seen in federalcourt as a new claim or a better way of stating an old one;

and they often will not understand whether new factsbrought forward in the federal petition reflect a new claim
or better support for an old one. Insofar as that is so,
the Court's approach is likely to lead not to fewer improper
federal petitions, but to increased confusion, as prisoners
hesitate to change the language of state petitions or add
facts, and to greater unfairness. And it will undercut one
significant purpose of the provision before us--to grant state
prisoners a fair and reasonable time to bring a first federal
habeas corpus petition.

Nor is it likely that prisoners will deliberately seek to
delay by repeatedly filing unexhausted petitions in federal court, as the Court suggests. See ante, at 180. First,
prisoners not under a sentence of death (the vast majority
of habeas petitioners) have no incentive to delay adjudication of their claims. Rather, "[t]he prisoner's principal interest . . . is in obtaining speedy federal relief." Rose v.
Lundy, 455 U. S., at 520. Second, the prisoner who chooses
to go into federal court with unexhausted claims runs the
risk that the district court will simply deny those claims on
the merits, as it is permitted to do, see 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(b)(2)
(1994 ed., Supp. V), before the prisoner has had the opportunity to develop a record in state court. Third, district
courts have the power to prevent vexatious repeated filings
by, for instance, ordering that a petition filed after a mixed
petition is dismissed must contain only exhausted claims.
See Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U. S. 473, 489 (2000). Thus,

533US1 Unit: $U74 [10-17-02 19:11:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN
192 DUNCAN v. WALKER

Breyer, J., dissenting
the interest in reducing "piecemeal litigation," ante, at 180,is not likely to be significantly furthered by the majority's

holding.Finally, the majority's construction of the statute will not
necessarily promote comity. Federal courts, understandingthat dismissal for nonexhaustion may mean the loss of any
opportunity for federal habeas review, may tend to read ambiguous earlier state-court proceedings as having adequatelyexhausted a federal petition's current claims. For similar

reasons, wherever possible, they may reach the merits of afederal petition's claims without sending the petitioner back
to state court for exhaustion. To that extent, the majority's
interpretation will result in a lesser, not a greater, respect
for the state interests to which the majority refers. In addition, by creating pressure to expedite consideration of habeas petitions and to reach the merits of arguably exhausted
claims, it will impose a heavier burden on the district courts.
(While Justice Stevens' sound suggestions that district
courts hold mixed petitions in abeyance and employ equitable tolling, see ante, at 182-184 (opinion concurring in part
and concurring in judgment), would properly ameliorate
some of the unfairness of the majority's interpretation, they
will also add to the burdens on the district courts in a way
that simple tolling for federal habeas petitions would not.)

In two recent cases, we have assumed that Congress did
not want to deprive state prisoners of first federal habeas
corpus review, and we have interpreted statutory ambiguities accordingly. In Stewart v. Martinez-Villareal, 523
U. S. 637 (1998), we held that a federal habeas petition filed
after the initial filing was dismissed as premature should not
be deemed a "second or successive" petition barred by $ 2244,
lest "dismissal . . . for technical procedural reasons . . . bar
the prisoner from ever obtaining federal habeas review."
Id., at 645. And in Slack v. McDaniel, we held that a
federal habeas petition filed after dismissal of an initial
filing for nonexhaustion should not be deemed a "second

or successive petition," lest "the complete exhaustion rule"become a " `trap' " for " `the unwary pro se prisoner.' " 529

U. S., at 487 (quoting Rose, supra, at 520). Making the sameassumption here, I would interpret the ambiguous provision
before us to permit tolling for federal habeas petitions.In both Martinez-Villareal and Slack, the Court discerned the purpose of an ambiguous statutory provisionby assuming that (absent a contrary indication) congressional purpose would mirror that of most reasonable humanbeings knowledgeable about the area of the law in question.
And the Court kept those purposes firmly and foremost inmind as it sought to understand the statute. See

Slack,supra, at 486-487; Martinez-Villareal, supra, at 644 (refusing to adopt an interpretation whose "implications forhabeas practice would be far reaching and seemingly perverse"). Today it takes a different approach--an approachthat looks primarily, though not exclusively, to linguistic
canons to dispel the uncertainties caused by ambiguity.Where statutory language is ambiguous, I believe these priorities are misplaced. Language, dictionaries, and canons,unilluminated by purpose, can lead courts into blind alleys,
producing rigid interpretations that can harm those whomthe statute affects. If generalized, the approach, bit by bit,
will divorce law from the needs, lives, and values of thosewhom it is meant to serve--a most unfortunate result for a
people who live their lives by law's light. The Court wasright in

Martinez-Villareal and Slack to see purpose as keyto the statute's meaning and to understand Congress as

intending the same; it is wrong to reverse its interpretivepriorities here.

With respect, I dissent.

SAUCIER v. KATZ et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 99-1977. Argued March 20, 2001--Decided June 18, 2001
Respondent Katz, president of respondent In Defense of Animals, filed a

suit pursuant to Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403
U. S. 388, against, inter alios, petitioner Saucier, a military policeman.
Katz alleged, among other things, that Saucier had violated his Fourth
Amendment rights by using excessive force in arresting him while
he protested during Vice President Gore's speech at a San Francisco
army base. The District Court declined to grant Saucier summary
judgment on qualified immunity grounds. In affirming, the Ninth
Circuit made a two-part qualified immunity inquiry. First, it found
that the law governing Saucier's conduct was clearly established when
the incident occurred. It therefore moved to a second step: to determine if a reasonable officer could have believed, in light of the clearly
established law, that his conduct was lawful. The court concluded
that this step and the merits of a Fourth Amendment excessive force
claim are identical, since both concern the objective reasonableness
of the officer's conduct in light of the circumstances the officer faced
at the scene. Thus, it found, summary judgment based on qualified
immunity was inappropriate.

Held:

1. A qualified immunity ruling requires an analysis not susceptible
of fusion with the question whether unreasonable force was used in
making the arrest. The Ninth Circuit's approach cannot be reconciled
with Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U. S. 635. A qualified immunity defense must be considered in proper sequence. A ruling should be made
early in the proceedings so that the cost and expenses of trial are
avoided where the defense is dispositive. Such immunity is an entitlement not to stand trial, not a defense from liability. Mitchell v.
Forsyth, 472 U. S. 511, 526. The initial inquiry is whether a constitutional right would have been violated on the facts alleged, for if no
right would have been violated, there is no need for further inquiry into
immunity. However, if a violation could be made out on a favorable
view of the parties' submissions, the next, sequential step is whether
the right was clearly established. This inquiry must be undertaken in
light of the case's specific context, not as a broad general proposition.
The relevant, dispositive inquiry is whether it would be clear to a rea533US1 Unit: $U75 [10-17-02 19:24:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN

195Cite as: 533 U. S. 194 (2001)
Syllabus
sonable officer that the conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted. See Wilson v. Layne, 526 U. S. 603, 615. The Ninth Circuit's
approach--to deny summary judgment if a material issue of fact remains on the excessive force claim--could undermine the goal of qualified immunity to avoid excessive disruption of government and permit
the resolution of many insubstantial claims on summary judgment.
Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, 818. If the law did not put the
officer on notice that his conduct would be clearly unlawful, summary
judgment based on qualified immunity is appropriate. The Ninth
Circuit concluded that qualified immunity is duplicative in an excessive force case, thus eliminating the need for the second step. In holding that qualified immunity applied in the Fourth Amendment context
just as it would for any other official misconduct claim, the Anderson
Court rejected the argument that there is no distinction between the
reasonableness standard for warrantless searches and the qualified immunity inquiry. In an attempt to distinguish Anderson, Katz claims
that the subsequent Graham v. Connor, 490 U. S. 386, decision set forth
an excessive force analysis indistinguishable from qualified immunity,
thus rendering the separate immunity inquiry superfluous and inappropriate in such cases. Contrary to his arguments, the immunity and
excessive force inquiries remain distinct after Graham. Graham sets
forth factors relevant to the merits of a constitutional excessive force
claim, which include the severity of the crime, whether the suspect
poses a threat to the officers or others, and whether he is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight. Id., at 396. If an
officer reasonably, but mistakenly, believed that a suspect was likely
to fight back, for instance, the officer would be justified in using more
force than in fact was needed. The qualified immunity inquiry's concern, on the other hand, is to acknowledge that reasonable mistakes
can be made as to the legal constraints on particular police conduct.
An officer might correctly perceive all of the relevant facts, but have
a mistaken understanding as to whether a particular amount of force
is legal in those circumstances. Pp. 200-207.

2. Petitioner was entitled to qualified immunity. Assuming that a
constitutional violation occurred under the facts alleged, the question
is whether this general prohibition was the source for clearly established law that was contravened in the circumstances. In the circumstances presented to petitioner, which included the duty to protect the
Vice President's safety and security from persons unknown in number,
there was no clearly established rule prohibiting him from acting as
he did. This conclusion is confirmed by the uncontested fact that the
force used--dragging Katz from the area and shoving him while placing

Opinion of the Court
Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.
In this case a citizen alleged excessive force was used
to arrest him. The arresting officer asserted the defense
of qualified immunity. The matter we address is whether
the requisite analysis to determine qualified immunity is so
intertwined with the question whether the officer used excessive force in making the arrest that qualified immunity
and constitutional violation issues should be treated as one
question, to be decided by the trier of fact. The Court of
Appeals held the inquiries do merge into a single question.
We now reverse and hold that the ruling on qualified immunity requires an analysis not susceptible of fusion with the
question whether unreasonable force was used in making
the arrest.

I

In autumn of 1994, the Presidio Army Base in San Francisco was the site of an event to celebrate conversion of
the base to a national park. Among the speakers was Vice
President Albert Gore, Jr., who attracted several hundred
observers from the military and the general public. Some
in attendance were not on hand to celebrate, however. Respondent Elliot Katz was concerned that the Army's Letterman Hospital would be used for conducting experiments on
animals. (Katz was president of a group called In Defense
of Animals. Although both he and the group are respondents here, the issues we discuss center upon Katz, and we
refer to him as "respondent.") To voice opposition to the
possibility that the hospital might be used for experiments,
respondent brought with him a cloth banner, approximately
4 by 3 feet, that read "Please Keep Animal Torture Out of
Our National Parks." In the past, as respondent was aware,
members of the public had been asked to leave the military
base when they engaged in certain activities, such as distributing handbills; and he kept the banner concealed under
his jacket as he walked through the base.

198 SAUCIER v. KATZ

Opinion of the Court
The area designated for the speakers contained seatingfor the general public, separated from the stage by a waisthigh fence. Respondent sat in the front row of the publicseating area. At about the time Vice President Gore began
speaking, respondent removed the banner from his jacket,started to unfold it, and walked toward the fence and speakers' platform.

Petitioner Donald Saucier is a military police officer whowas on duty that day. He had been warned by his superiors

of the possibility of demonstrations, and respondent hadbeen identified as a potential protester. Petitioner and Sergeant Steven Parker--also a military police officer, but not
a party to the suit--recognized respondent and moved to
intercept him as he walked toward the fence. As he reached
the barrier and began placing the banner on the other side,
the officers grabbed respondent from behind, took the banner, and rushed him out of the area. Each officer had one
of respondent's arms, half-walking, half-dragging him, with
his feet "barely touching the ground." App. 24. Respondent was wearing a visible, knee-high leg brace, although petitioner later testified he did not remember noticing it at
the time. Saucier and Parker took respondent to a nearby
military van, where, respondent claims, he was shoved or
thrown inside. Id., at 25. The reason for the shove remains
unclear. It seems agreed that respondent placed his feet
somewhere on the outside of the van, perhaps the bumper,
but there is a dispute whether he did so to resist. As a
result of the shove, respondent claims, he fell to the floor of
the van, where he caught himself just in time to avoid any
injury. The officers drove respondent to a military police
station, held him for a brief time, and then released him.
Though the details are not clear, it appears that at least one
other protester was also placed into the van and detained for
a brief time. Id., at 27.

Respondent brought this action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against

governing excessive force claims was clearly established at
the time of the arrest, and that "[i]n the Fourth Amendment
context, the qualified immunity inquiry is the same as the
inquiry made on the merits." Id., at 29a-30a. As a result,
it ruled, petitioner was not entitled to summary judgment.
Id., at 30a.

In the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit petitioner filed an interlocutory appeal from the denial
of qualified immunity. 194 F. 3d 962 (1999). The Court of
Appeals affirmed, noting at the outset its two-part analysis
for qualified immunity questions. First, the Court of Appeals considers "whether the law governing the official's
conduct was clearly established." Id., at 967. If it was
not, that ends the matter, and the official is entitled to immunity. If, however, the law was clearly established when the
conduct occurred, the Court of Appeals' second step is to
determine if a reasonable officer could have believed, in
light of the clearly established law, that his conduct was
lawful. Ibid. As to the first step of its analysis, the court
observed that Graham v. Connor, 490 U. S. 386 (1989), sets
forth the objective reasonableness test for evaluating excessive force claims, a principle the Court of Appeals concluded was clearly established for qualified immunity purposes. The court then concluded that the second step of the
qualified immunity inquiry and the merits of the Fourth

Opinion of the Court
Amendment excessive force claim are identical, since bothconcern the objective reasonableness of the officer's conduct in light of the circumstances the officer faced on thescene. 194 F. 3d, at 968. On this reasoning, summary judgment based on qualified immunity was held inappropriate.Id., at 968-969.

Saucier, represented by the Government of the UnitedStates, sought review here, arguing the Court of Appeals
erred in its view that the qualified immunity inquiry isthe same as the constitutional inquiry and so becomes superfluous or duplicative when excessive force is alleged.We granted certiorari, 531 U. S. 991 (2000).

II
The Court of Appeals ruled first that the right was clearlyestablished; and second that the reasonableness inquiry into

excessive force meant that it need not consider aspects ofqualified immunity, leaving the whole matter to the jury.
194 F. 3d, at 967. This approach cannot be reconciled with
Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U. S. 635 (1987), however, andwas in error in two respects. As we shall explain, the first

inquiry must be whether a constitutional right would havebeen violated on the facts alleged; second, assuming the violation is established, the question whether the right wasclearly established must be considered on a more specific
level than recognized by the Court of Appeals.In a suit against an officer for an alleged violation of a
constitutional right, the requisites of a qualified immunitydefense must be considered in proper sequence. Where the
defendant seeks qualified immunity, a ruling on that issueshould be made early in the proceedings so that the costs
and expenses of trial are avoided where the defense isdispositive. Qualified immunity is "an entitlement not to
stand trial or face the other burdens of litigation." Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U. S. 511, 526 (1985). The privilege is"an

immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to lia533US1 Unit: $U75 [10-17-02 19:24:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
bility; and like an absolute immunity, it is effectively lostif a case is erroneously permitted to go to trial."

Ibid. As
a result, "we repeatedly have stressed the importance ofresolving immunity questions at the earliest possible stage

in litigation." Hunter v. Bryant, 502 U. S. 224, 227 (1991)
(per curiam).

A court required to rule upon the qualified immunity issue
must consider, then, this threshold question: Taken in thelight most favorable to the party asserting the injury, do

the facts alleged show the officer's conduct violated a con-stitutional right? This must be the initial inquiry.

Siegert
v. Gilley, 500 U. S. 226, 232 (1991). In the course of determining whether a constitutional right was violated on the
premises alleged, a court might find it necessary to set
forth principles which will become the basis for a holding that a right is clearly established. This is the process
for the law's elaboration from case to case, and it is one
reason for our insisting upon turning to the existence or
nonexistence of a constitutional right as the first inquiry.
The law might be deprived of this explanation were a court
simply to skip ahead to the question whether the law clearly
established that the officer's conduct was unlawful in the
circumstances of the case.

If no constitutional right would have been violated were
the allegations established, there is no necessity for further inquiries concerning qualified immunity. On the other
hand, if a violation could be made out on a favorable view
of the parties' submissions, the next, sequential step is to
ask whether the right was clearly established. This inquiry, it is vital to note, must be undertaken in light of the
specific context of the case, not as a broad general proposition; and it too serves to advance understanding of the law
and to allow officers to avoid the burden of trial if qualified
immunity is applicable.

In this litigation, for instance, there is no doubt that
Graham v. Connor, supra, clearly establishes the general

533US1 Unit: $U75 [10-17-02 19:24:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN
202 SAUCIER v. KATZ

Opinion of the Court
proposition that use of force is contrary to the FourthAmendment if it is excessive under objective standards of

reasonableness. Yet that is not enough. Rather, we em-phasized in

Anderson "that the right the official is alleged
to have violated must have been `clearly established' in amore particularized, and hence more relevant, sense: The

contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doingviolates that right." 483 U. S., at 640. The relevant, dispositive inquiry in determining whether a right is clearlyestablished is whether it would be clear to a reasonable
officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he
confronted. See Wilson v. Layne, 526 U. S. 603, 615 (1999)
("[A]s we explained in Anderson, the right allegedly violated must be defined at the appropriate level of specificity
before a court can determine if it was clearly established").

The approach the Court of Appeals adopted--to deny
summary judgment any time a material issue of fact remains on the excessive force claim--could undermine the
goal of qualified immunity to "avoid excessive disruption of
government and permit the resolution of many insubstantial
claims on summary judgment." Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457
U. S. 800, 818 (1982). If the law did not put the officer on
notice that his conduct would be clearly unlawful, summary
judgment based on qualified immunity is appropriate. See
Malley v. Briggs, 475 U. S. 335, 341 (1986) (qualified immunity protects "all but the plainly incompetent or those who
knowingly violate the law").

This is not to say that the formulation of a general rule
is beside the point, nor is it to insist the courts must have
agreed upon the precise formulation of the standard. Assuming, for instance, that various courts have agreed that
certain conduct is a constitutional violation under facts not
distinguishable in a fair way from the facts presented in
the case at hand, the officer would not be entitled to qualified immunity based simply on the argument that courts

533US1 Unit: $U75 [10-17-02 19:24:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN

203Cite as: 533 U. S. 194 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
had not agreed on one verbal formulation of the controllingstandard.

The Court of Appeals concluded that qualified immunityis merely duplicative in an excessive force case, eliminating
the need for the second step where a constitutional viola-tion could be found based on the allegations. In

Anderson,
a warrantless search case, we rejected the argument that
there is no distinction between the reasonableness standardfor warrantless searches and the qualified immunity inquiry.

We acknowledged there was some "surface appeal" to theargument that, because the Fourth Amendment's guarantee
was a right to be free from "unreasonable" searches and
seizures, it would be inconsistent to conclude that an officer
who acted unreasonably under the constitutional standard
nevertheless was entitled to immunity because he " `reasonably' acted unreasonably." 483 U. S., at 643. This superficial similarity, however, could not overcome either our
history of applying qualified immunity analysis to Fourth
Amendment claims against officers or the justifications for
applying the doctrine in an area where officers perform
their duties with considerable uncertainty as to "whether
particular searches or seizures comport with the Fourth
Amendment." Id., at 644. With respect, moreover, to the
argument made in Anderson that an exception should be
made for Fourth Amendment cases, we observed "the heavy
burden this argument must sustain to be successful," since
"the doctrine of qualified immunity reflects a balance that
has been struck `across the board.' " Id., at 642 (quoting
Harlow v. Fitzgerald, supra, at 821). We held that qualified
immunity applied in the Fourth Amendment context just
as it would for any other claim of official misconduct. 483
U. S., at 644.

Faced, then, with the heavy burden of distinguishing Anderson and of carving out an exception to the typical qualified immunity analysis applied in other Fourth Amendment
contexts, the primary submission by respondent in defense

204 SAUCIER v. KATZ

Opinion of the Court
of the Court of Appeals' decision is that our decision in
Graham v. Connor, 490 U. S. 386 (1989), somehow changes
matters. Graham, in respondent's view, sets forth an ex-cessive force analysis indistinguishable from qualified immunity, rendering the separate immunity inquiry superfluousand inappropriate. Respondent asserts that, like the qualified immunity analysis applicable in other contexts, the excessive force test already affords officers latitude for mis-taken beliefs as to the amount of force necessary, so that

"Graham has addressed for the excessive force area mostof the concerns expressed in

Anderson." Brief for Respondents 7. Respondent points out that Graham did not
address the interaction of excessive force claims and qualified immunity, since the issue was not raised, see 490 U. S.,
at 399, n. 12; and respondent seeks to distinguish Anderson
on the theory that the issue of probable cause implicates
evolving legal standards and resulting legal uncertainty,
a subject raising recurrent questions of qualified immunity.
By contrast, respondent says, excessive force is governed
by the standard established in Graham, a standard providing ample guidance for particular situations. Finally,
respondent adopts the suggestion made by one Court of
Appeals that the relevant distinction is that probable cause
is an ex post inquiry, whereas excessive force, like qualified immunity, should be evaluated from an ex ante perspective. See Finnegan v. Fountain, 915 F. 2d 817, 824,
n. 11 (CA2 1990).

These arguments or attempted distinctions cannot bear
the weight respondent seeks to place upon them. Graham
did not change the qualified immunity framework explained
in Anderson. The inquiries for qualified immunity and excessive force remain distinct, even after Graham.

In Graham, we held that claims of excessive force in the
context of arrests or investigatory stops should be analyzed
under the Fourth Amendment's "objective reasonableness
standard," not under substantive due process principles.

Opinion of the Court
490 U. S., at 388, 394. Because "police officers are oftenforced to make split-second judgments--in circumstances

that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving--about theamount of force that is necessary in a particular situation,"
id., at 397, the reasonableness of the officer's belief as tothe appropriate level of force should be judged from that
on-scene perspective, id., at 396. We set out a test that
cautioned against the "20/20 vision of hindsight" in favorof deference to the judgment of reasonable officers on the

scene. Id., at 393, 396. Graham sets forth a list of factorsrelevant to the merits of the constitutional excessive force
claim, "requir[ing] careful attention to the facts and circumstances of each particular case, including the severity
of the crime at issue, whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others, and
whether he is actively resisting arrest or attempting to
evade arrest by flight." Id., at 396. If an officer reasonably, but mistakenly, believed that a suspect was likely to
fight back, for instance, the officer would be justified in using
more force than in fact was needed.

The qualified immunity inquiry, on the other hand, has a
further dimension. The concern of the immunity inquiry
is to acknowledge that reasonable mistakes can be made
as to the legal constraints on particular police conduct. It
is sometimes difficult for an officer to determine how the
relevant legal doctrine, here excessive force, will apply to
the factual situation the officer confronts. An officer might
correctly perceive all of the relevant facts but have a mistaken understanding as to whether a particular amount
of force is legal in those circumstances. If the officer's mistake as to what the law requires is reasonable, however, the
officer is entitled to the immunity defense.

Graham does not always give a clear answer as to whether
a particular application of force will be deemed excessive by
the courts. This is the nature of a test which must accommodate limitless factual circumstances. This reality serves

533US1 Unit: $U75 [10-17-02 19:24:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN
206 SAUCIER v. KATZ

Opinion of the Court
to refute respondent's claimed distinction between excessiveforce and other Fourth Amendment contexts; in both spheres

the law must be elaborated from case to case. Qualified im-munity operates in this case, then, just as it does in others,
to protect officers from the sometimes "hazy border betweenexcessive and acceptable force,"

Priester v. Riviera Beach,
208 F. 3d 919, 926-927 (CA11 2000), and to ensure that before
they are subjected to suit, officers are on notice their conductis unlawful.

Graham and Anderson refute the excessive force/probablecause distinction on which much of respondent's position
seems to depend. The deference owed officers facing suits
for alleged excessive force is not different in some qualitative respect from the probable-cause inquiry in Anderson.
Officers can have reasonable, but mistaken, beliefs as to the
facts establishing the existence of probable cause or exigent
circumstances, for example, and in those situations courts
will not hold that they have violated the Constitution. Yet,
even if a court were to hold that the officer violated the
Fourth Amendment by conducting an unreasonable, warrantless search, Anderson still operates to grant officers
immunity for reasonable mistakes as to the legality of their
actions. The same analysis is applicable in excessive force
cases, where in addition to the deference officers receive
on the underlying constitutional claim, qualified immunity
can apply in the event the mistaken belief was reasonable.

The temporal perspective of the inquiry, whether labeled
as ex ante or ex post, offers no meaningful distinction between excessive force and other Fourth Amendment suits.
Graham recognized as much, reviewing several of our
probable-cause and search warrant cases, then stating that
"[w]ith respect to a claim of excessive force, the same standard of reasonableness at the moment applies." 490 U. S., at
396 (discussing use of force under Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1
(1968); probable cause to arrest under Hill v. California, 401
U. S. 797 (1971); and search warrant requirements under

Opinion of the Court
Maryland v. Garrison, 480 U. S. 79 (1987)); see also Hunterv. Bryant, 502 U. S., at 228 ("Probable cause existed if `at

the moment the arrest was made . . . the facts and circum-stances within their knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information were sufficient to warranta prudent man in believing' " a crime had been committed
(quoting Beck v. Ohio, 379 U. S. 89, 91 (1964))). Excessiveforce claims, like most other Fourth Amendment issues,
are evaluated for objective reasonableness based upon theinformation the officers had when the conduct occurred.

III
The case was presented to the Court of Appeals on theassumption that respondent's seizure and brief detention

did not violate clearly established First Amendment privi-leges and did not violate the Fourth Amendment right to
be free from arrest without probable cause, as distinctfrom the force used to detain. The sole question, then,
is whether the force used violated a clearly establishedFourth Amendment protection so that petitioner was not
entitled to immunity.Our instruction to the district courts and courts of appeals to concentrate at the outset on the definition of theconstitutional right and to determine whether, on the facts
alleged, a constitutional violation could be found is im-portant. As we have said, the procedure permits courts
in appropriate cases to elaborate the constitutional rightwith greater degrees of specificity. Because we granted certiorari only to determine whether qualified immunity wasappropriate, however, and because of the limits imposed
upon us by the questions on which we granted review, wewill assume a constitutional violation could have occurred
under the facts alleged based simply on the general ruleprohibiting excessive force, then proceed to the question
whether this general prohibition against excessive force wasthe source for clearly established law that was contravened

533US1 Unit: $U75 [10-17-02 19:24:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN
208 SAUCIER v. KATZ

Opinion of the Court
in the circumstances this officer faced. There was no con-travention under this standard. Though it is doubtful that

the force used was excessive, we need not rest our conclu-sion on that determination. The question is what the officer reasonably understood his powers and responsibilitiesto be, when he acted, under clearly established standards.

Respondent's excessive force claim for the most part
depends upon the "gratuitously violent shove" allegedly re-ceived when he was placed into the van, although respondent notes as well that the alleged violation resulted fromthe "totality of the circumstances," including the way he
was removed from the speaking area. See Brief for Respondents 3, n. 2.

These circumstances, however, disclose substantial
grounds for the officer to have concluded he had legitimate
justification under the law for acting as he did. In Graham
we noted that "[o]ur Fourth Amendment jurisprudence has
long recognized that the right to make an arrest or investigatory stop necessarily carries with it the right to use some
degree of physical coercion or threat thereof to effect it."
490 U. S., at 396. A reasonable officer in petitioner's position could have believed that hurrying respondent away from
the scene, where the Vice President was speaking and respondent had just approached the fence designed to separate the public from the speakers, was within the bounds
of appropriate police responses.

Petitioner did not know the full extent of the threat respondent posed or how many other persons there might be
who, in concert with respondent, posed a threat to the security of the Vice President. There were other potential protesters in the crowd, and at least one other individual was
arrested and placed into the van with respondent. In carrying out the detention, as it has been assumed the officers
had the right to do, petitioner was required to recognize
the necessity to protect the Vice President by securing respondent and restoring order to the scene. It cannot be said

209Cite as: 533 U. S. 194 (2001)
Ginsburg, J., concurring in judgment
there was a clearly established rule that would prohibitusing the force petitioner did to place respondent into the

van to accomplish these objectives.As for the shove respondent received when he was
placed into the van, those same circumstances show somedegree of urgency. We have approved the observation that
"[n]ot every push or shove, even if it may later seem un-necessary in the peace of a judge's chambers, violates the
Fourth Amendment." Ibid. (citations omitted). Pushesand shoves, like other police conduct, must be judged under
the Fourth Amendment standard of reasonableness.In the circumstances presented to this officer, which
included the duty to protect the safety and security of theVice President of the United States from persons unknown
in number, neither respondent nor the Court of Appealshas identified any case demonstrating a clearly established
rule prohibiting the officer from acting as he did, nor arewe aware of any such rule. Our conclusion is confirmed
by the uncontested fact that the force was not so excessivethat respondent suffered hurt or injury. On these premises, petitioner was entitled to qualified immunity, and thesuit should have been dismissed at an early stage in the
proceedings.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and
the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent withthis opinion.

It is so ordered.
Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Stevens and
Justice Breyer join, concurring in the judgment.

In Graham v. Connor, 490 U. S. 386 (1989), the Court an-nounced and described an "objective reasonableness" standard to govern all claims that law enforcement officers, in vio-lation of the Fourth Amendment, used excessive force in the
course of an arrest. Measuring material facts of this case
that are not subject to genuine dispute against the Graham

standard, I conclude that officer Saucier's motion for sum-mary judgment should have been granted. I therefore concur in the Court's judgment. However, I would not travelthe complex route the Court lays out for lower courts.

Applicati on of the G raham objective reasonablenessstandard is both necessary, under currently governing precedent, and, in my view, sufficient to resolve cases of this genre.The Court today tacks on to a

Graham inquiry a second,overlapping objective reasonableness inquiry purportedly

demanded by qualified immunity doctrine. The two-parttest today's decision imposes holds large potential to confuse.
Endeavors to bring the Court's abstract instructions downto earth, I suspect, will bear out what lower courts have
already observed--paradigmatically, the determination ofpolice misconduct in excessive force cases and the availability of qualified immunity both hinge on the same question:Taking into account the particular circumstances confronting
the defendant officer, could a reasonable officer, identicallysituated, have believed the force employed was lawful? See,
e. g., Roy v. Inhabitants of Lewiston, 42 F. 3d 691, 695 (CA11994);

Rowland v. Perry, 41 F. 3d 167, 173 (CA4 1994).Nothing more and nothing else need be answered in this

case. I

All claims that law enforcement officers have used exces-sive force in the course of an arrest, Graham made explicit,
are to be judged "under the Fourth Amendment and its`reasonableness' standard, rather than under a `substantive due process' approach." 490 U. S., at 395. Underlyingintent or motive are not relevant to the inquiry; rather,
"the question is whether the officers' actions are `objectivelyreasonable' in light of the facts and circumstances confronting them." Id., at 397. The proper perspective in judg-ing an excessive force claim, Graham explained, is that of
"a reasonable officer on the scene" and "at the moment" forcewas employed.

Id., at 396. "Not every push or shove," the

533US1 Unit: $U75 [10-17-02 19:24:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN

211Cite as: 533 U. S. 194 (2001)
Ginsburg, J., concurring in judgment
Court cautioned, "even if it may later seem unnecessary in
the peace of a judge's chambers, violates the Fourth Amendment." Ibid. (citation omitted). "The calculus of reasonableness" must allow for the reality that "police officers are
often forced to make split-second judgments" about the force
a particular situation warrants "in circumstances that are
tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving." Id., at 396-397.

Under Graham's instructions, the question in this case
is whether officer Saucier, in light of the facts and circumstances confronting him, could have reasonably believed
he acted lawfully. Here, as in the mine run of excessive
force cases, no inquiry more complex than that is warranted.

Inspecting this case under Graham's lens, and without
doubling the "objectively reasonable" inquiry, I agree that
Katz's submissions were too slim to put officer Saucier to the
burden of trial. As the Court points out, it is not genuinely
in doubt that "[a] reasonable officer in [Saucier's] position
could have believed that hurrying [Katz] away from the
scene . . . was within the bounds of appropriate police responses." Ante, at 208. Katz's excessive force claim thus
depended on the "gratuitously violent shove" he allegedly
received. Ibid.; see Brief for Respondents 3, n. 2 (conceding
that "the gratuitous violent shove" was essential to Katz's
excessive force claim).

Yet Katz failed to proffer proof, after pretrial discovery,
that Saucier, as distinguished from his fellow officer Parker,1
had a hand in the allegedly violent shove.2 Saucier, in his

for Petitioner 3, n. 4.

2 See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(e) ("When a motion for summary judgment

is made and supported as provided in this rule, an adverse party may not
rest upon the mere allegations or denials of the adverse party's pleading,
but the adverse party's response . . . must set forth specific facts showing
that there is a genuine issue for trial.").

deposition, denied participating in any shove, see App. 39-40, while Katz, in his deposition, said, without elaborating:

"They [Parker and Saucier] pretty much threw me in. Justshoved me in," id., at 25. But critically, at no point did Katz
say, specifically, that Saucier himself, and not only Parker,pushed or shoved.

Katz's reluctance directly to charge Saucier with pushingor shoving is understandable in view of a television news
videotape of the episode Katz presented as an exhibit to hiscomplaint. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 27a. The videotape
shows that the shove, described by Katz as gratuitously vio-lent, came from the officer on the right side of the police
van, not from the officer positioned on the left side. It isundisputed that the officer on the right is Parker, the officer
on the left, Saucier. See Pet. for Cert. 27-28, and n. 19;Brief for Petitioner 50, n. 26. Mindful of

Graham's cau-tionary observation that "[n]ot every push or shove, even

if it may later seem unnecessary in the peace of a judge'schambers, violates the Fourth Amendment," 490 U. S., at
396 (citation omitted), and in view of Katz's failure to denythat the shove alleged to establish excessive force came from
Parker alone, not from Saucier, I am persuaded that Katztendered no triable excessive force claim against Saucier.

In the Court's opinion, Graham is inadequate to con-trol adjudication of excessive force cases.

Graham must beoverlaid, the Court maintains, by a sequential qualified immunity inquiry. Ante, at 200. The Court instructs lowercourts first to undertake what appears to be an unadorned

Saucier employed excessive force in removing Katz from the site of the
celebration and placing him in the van. See Rowland v. Perry, 41 F. 3d
167, 174 (CA4 1994) ("[d]isputed versions of the facts alone are not enough
to warrant denial of summary judgment").

Graham inquiry, i. e., to consider initially whether theparties' submissions, viewed favorably to the plaintiff, could

show that the officer's conduct violated the Fourth Amend-ment. Ante, at 201. If the plaintiff prevails on that
"threshold question," ibid., the trial court is then to proceedto the "dispositive [qualified immunity] inquiry," asking
"whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that theconduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted,"

ante,at 202.

In the instant case, however, the Court finds that pro-cedural impediments stop it from considering first "whether

a constitutional right would have been violated on the factsalleged."

Ante, at 200, 207-208. The Court therefore "assume[s] a constitutional violation could have occurred," ante,at 207--

i. e., it supposes a trier could have found that officer
Saucier used force excessive under Graham's definition.Even so, the Court reasons, qualified immunity would shield

Saucier because he could have "concluded he had legitimate
justification under the law for acting as he did." Ante, at208.

Skipping ahead of the basic Graham (constitutional vio-lation) inquiry it admonished lower courts to undertake at
the outset, the Court failed to home in on the duplicationinherent in its two-step scheme. As lower courts dealing
with excessive force cases on the ground have recognized,however, this Court's decisions invoke "the same `objectively reasonable' standard in describing both the consti-tutional test of liability [citing

Graham, 490 U. S., at 397],
and the . . . standard for qualified immunity [citing Andersonv.

Appeals ha[s] identified any case demonstrating a clearly established rule
prohibiting the officer from acting as he did," ante, at 209, must be read
in light of our previous caution that "the very action in question [need
not have] previously been held unlawful" for a plaintiff to defeat qualified
immunity, Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U. S. 635, 640 (1987).

who uses force that is objectively reasonable "in light of thefacts and circumstances confronting [him]," Graham, 490
U. S., at 397, simultaneously meets the standard for qualifiedimmunity, see

ante, at 201, and the standard the Court setin Graham for a decision on the merits in his favor. Conversely, an officer whose conduct is objectively unreason-able under Graham should find no shelter under a sequential
qualified immunity test.Double counting "objective reasonableness," the Court appears to suggest, ante, at 200, is demanded by Anderson,which twice restated that qualified immunity shields the conduct of officialdom "across the board." 483 U. S., at 642, 645(quoting Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, 821 (1982)
(Brennan, J., concurring)); see also Anderson, 483 U. S., at643 ("we have been unwilling to complicate qualified immunity analysis by making the scope or extent of immunityturn on the precise nature of various officials' duties or the
precise character of the particular rights alleged to havebeen violated"). As I see it, however, excessive force cases
are not meet for Anderson's two-part test.

Anderson presented the question whether the particu-lar search conducted without a warrant was supported by

probable cause and exigent circumstances. The answer tosuch a question is often far from clear.

the Court accorded qualified immunity to police who permitted the media

the ride-along practice was unsettled at the time of the incident-in-suit
in Wilson, and remained so until this Court spoke.

police officer must not be held to act at his peril." Bivensv.

Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 456 F. 2d 1339, 1348 (1972) (on remand). In this light,
Anderson reasoned: "Law enforcement officers whose judgments in making these difficult determinations [whether
particular searches or seizures comport with the FourthAmendment] are objectively legally reasonable should no

more be held personally liable in damages than shouldofficials making

analogous determinations in other areas
of law." 483 U. S., at 644 (emphasis added).

As the foregoing discussion indicates, however, "excessive
force" typically is not an "analogous determination." The
constitutional issue whether an officer's use of force was reasonable in given circumstances routinely can be answered
simply by following Graham's directions. In inquiring,
under Graham, whether an officer's use of force was within
a range of reasonable options, the decisionmaker is also
(and necessarily) answering the question whether a reasonable officer "could have believed" his use of force "to be
lawful," Anderson, 483 U. S., at 638. See Street, 929 F. 2d,
at 541, n. 2 (because of difficulty of deciding probable-cause
issues, the conduct of an officer may be objectively reasonable even if cause did not exist, but "in excessive force cases,
once a factfinder has determined that the force used was unnecessary under the circumstances, any question of objective
reasonableness has also been foreclosed").

The Court fears that dispensing with the duplicative qualified immunity inquiry will mean "leaving the whole matter
to the jury." Ante, at 200. Again, experience teaches
otherwise. Lower courts, armed with Graham's directions,
have not shied away from granting summary judgment to
defendant officials in Fourth Amendment excessive force
cases where the challenged conduct is objectively reasonable
based on relevant, undisputed facts. See, e. g., Wilson v.

and concluding officer's conduct was objectively reasonable
in the circumstances, so summary judgment for officer was

judgment for defendant); 6 Wardlaw v. Pickett, 1 F. 3d 1297,
1303-1304 (CADC 1993) (same). Indeed, this very case, as
I earlier explained, see supra, at 210-212, fits the summary
judgment bill. Of course, if an excessive force claim turns
on which of two conflicting stories best captures what happened on the street, Graham will not permit summary judgment in favor of the defendant official. And that is as it
should be. When a plaintiff proffers evidence that the official subdued her with a chokehold even though she complied
at all times with his orders, while the official proffers evidence that he used only stern words, a trial must be had.
In such a case, the Court's two-step procedure is altogether
inutile.

but not in the two-step inquiry the Court has ordered. Once

UNITED STATES v. MEAD CORP.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe federal circuit

No. 99-1434. Argued November 8, 2000--Decided June 18, 2001
The Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States authorizes the

United States Customs Service to classify and fix the rate of duty on
imports, under rules and regulations issued by the Secretary of the
Treasury. As relevant here, the Secretary provides for tariff rulings
before the entry of goods by regulations authorizing "ruling letters"
setting tariff classifications for particular imports. Any of the 46 portof-entry Customs offices and the Customs Headquarters Office may
issue such letters. Respondent imports "day planners," three-ring
binders with pages for daily schedules, phone numbers and addresses, a
calendar, and suchlike. After classifying the planners as duty free for
several years, Customs Headquarters issued a ruling letter classifying
them as bound diaries subject to tariff. Mead filed suit in the Court of
International Trade, which granted the Government summary judgment. In reversing, the Federal Circuit found that ruling letters should
not be treated like Customs regulations, which receive the highest level
of deference under Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense
Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, because they are not preceded by notice
and comment as under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), do not
carry the force of law, and are not intended to clarify importers's rights
and obligations beyond the specific case. The court gave no deference
at all to the ruling letter at issue.

Held: Administrative implementation of a particular statutory provision

qualifies for Chevron deference when it appears that Congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force
of law, and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of such authority. Such delegation may be
shown in a variety of ways, as by an agency's power to engage in adjudication or notice-and-comment rulemaking, or by some other indication of comparable congressional intent. A Customs ruling letter has
no claim to Chevron deference, but, under Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323
U. S. 134, it is eligible to claim respect according to its persuasiveness.
Pp. 227-239.

(a) When Congress has explicitly left a gap for an agency to fill, there
has been an express delegation of authority to the agency to elucidate a

533US1 Unit: $U76 [11-01-02 19:12:19] PAGES PGT: OPLG

Syllabus
specific statutory provision by regulation, and any ensuing regulation is binding unless procedurally defective, arbitrary or capricious
in substance, or manifestly contrary to the statute. Even in the absence of an express delegation of authority on a particular question,
agencies charged with applying a statute necessarily make all sorts
of interpretive choices, and while not all of those choices bind judges
to follow them, they may influence courts facing questions the agencies have already answered. The weight accorded to an administrative
judgment "will depend upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of its reasoning, its consistency with earlier
and later pronouncements, and all those factors which give it power
to persuade, if lacking power to control." Skidmore, supra, at 140.
In Chevron, this Court identified a category of interpretive choices
distinguished by an additional reason for judicial deference, recognizing that Congress engages not only in express, but also in implicit,
delegation of specific interpretive authority. It can be apparent from
the agency's generally conferred authority and other statutory circumstances that Congress would expect the agency to be able to speak
with the force of law when addressing ambiguity in the statute or fills
in a space in the enacted law, even one about which Congress did not
have intent as to a particular result. When circumstances implying
such an expectation exist, a reviewing court must accept the agency's
position if Congress has not previously spoken to the point at issue and
the agency's interpretation is reasonable. A very good indicator of delegation meriting Chevron treatment is express congressional authorizations to engage in the rulemaking or adjudication process that produces
the regulations or rulings for which deference is claimed. Thus, the
overwhelming number of cases applying Chevron deference have reviewed the fruits of notice-and-comment rulemaking or formal adjudication. Although the fact that the tariff classification at issue was not a
product of such formal process does not alone bar Chevron's application,
cf., e. g., NationsBank of N. C., N. A. v. Variable Annuity Life Ins. Co.,
513 U. S. 251, 256-257, 263, there are ample reasons to deny Chevron
deference here. Pp. 227-231.

(b) There is no indication on the statute's face that Congress meant
to delegate authority to Customs to issue classification rulings with the
force of law. Also, it is difficult to see in agency practice any indication
that Customs set out with a lawmaking pretense in mind, for it does
not generally engage in notice-and-comment practice and a letter's
binding character as a ruling stops short of third parties. Indeed, any
suggestion that rulings intended to have the force of law are being
churned out at a rate of 10,000 a year at 46 offices is self-refuting. Nor

Syllabus
do statutory amendments effective after this case arose reveal a new
congressional objective of treating classification decisions generally as
rulemaking with force of law or suggest any intent to create a Chevron
patchwork of classification rules, some with force of law, some without. In sum, classification rulings are best treated like "interpretations contained in policy statements, agency manuals, and enforcement
guidelines," Christensen v. Harris County, 529 U. S. 576, 587, and thus
beyond the Chevron pale. Pp. 231-234.

(c) This does not mean, however, that the letters are due no deference. Chevron did not eliminate Skidmore's holding that an agency's
interpretation may merit some deference whatever its form, given the
"specialized experience and broader investigations and information"
available to the agency, 323 U. S., at 139, and given the value of uniformity in its administrative and judicial understandings of what a national
law requires, id., at 140. There is room at least to raise a Skidmore
claim here, where the regulatory scheme is highly detailed, and Customs
can bring the benefit of specialized experience to bear on this case's
questions. The classification ruling may at least seek a respect proportional to its "power to persuade," ibid., and may claim the merit of its
writer's thoroughness, logic and expertness, its fit with prior interpretations, and any other sources of weight. Underlying this Court's position is a choice about the best way to deal with the great variety of
ways in which the laws invest the Government's administrative arms
with discretion, and with procedures for exercising it, in giving meaning
to Acts of Congress. The Court said nothing in Chevron to eliminate
Skidmore's recognition of various justifications for deference depending
on statutory circumstances and agency action. Judicial responses to
such action must continue to differentiate between the two cases. Any
Skidmore assessment here ought to be made in the first instance by the
lower courts. Pp. 234-239.

Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.
The question is whether a tariff classification ruling by theUnited States Customs Service deserves judicial deference.

The Federal Circuit rejected Customs's invocation of Chev-ron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,
467 U. S. 837 (1984), in support of such a ruling, to which itgave no deference. We agree that a tariff classification has
no claim to judicial deference under Chevron, there being noindication that Congress intended such a ruling to carry the
force of law, but we hold that under Skidmore v. Swift & Co.,323 U. S. 134 (1944), the ruling is eligible to claim respect
according to its persuasiveness.

and regulations prescribed by the Secretary [of the Treasury,] . . . fix the final classification and rate of duty applicable
to . . . merchandise" under the HTSUS. Section 1502(a) provides that

"[t]he Secretary of the Treasury shall establish and
promulgate such rules and regulations not inconsistent with the law (including regulations establishing procedures for the issuance of binding rulings prior to the
entry of the merchandise concerned), and may disseminate such information as may be necessary to secure a
just, impartial, and uniform appraisement of imported
merchandise and the classification and assessment of
duties thereon at the various ports of entry." 1

See also $ 1624 (general delegation to Secretary to issue
rules and regulations for the admission of goods).

The Secretary provides for tariff rulings before the entry
of goods by regulations authorizing "ruling letters" setting
tariff classifications for particular imports. 19 CFR $ 177.8
(2000). A ruling letter

"represents the official position of the Customs Service
with respect to the particular transaction or issue described therein and is binding on all Customs Service
personnel in accordance with the provisions of this
section until modified or revoked. In the absence of a
change of practice or other modification or revocation
which affects the principle of the ruling set forth in the
ruling letter, that principle may be cited as authority
in the disposition of transactions involving the same
circumstances." $ 177.9(a).

1 The statutory term "ruling" is defined by regulation as "a written
statement . . . that interprets and applies the provisions of the Customs
and related laws to a specific set of facts." 19 CFR $ 177.1(d)(1) (2000).

Opinion of the Court
After the transaction that gives it birth, a ruling letter is
to "be applied only with respect to transactions involving
articles identical to the sample submitted with the ruling
request or to articles whose description is identical to the
description set forth in the ruling letter." $ 177.9(b)(2). As
a general matter, such a letter is "subject to modification or
revocation without notice to any person, except the person
to whom the letter was addressed," $ 177.9(c), and the regulations consequently provide that "no other person should rely
on the ruling letter or assume that the principles of that
ruling will be applied in connection with any transaction
other than the one described in the letter," ibid. Since ruling letters respond to transactions of the moment, they are
not subject to notice and comment before being issued, may
be published but need only be made "available for public
inspection," 19 U. S. C. $ 1625(a), and, at the time this action
arose, could be modified without notice and comment under
most circumstances, 19 CFR $ 177.10(c) (2000).2 A broader
notice-and-comment requirement for modification of prior
rulings was added by statute in 1993, Pub. L. 103-182, $ 623,
107 Stat. 2186, codified at 19 U. S. C. $ 1625(c), and took effect
after this case arose.3

2 The opinion of the Federal Circuit in this case noted that $ 177.10(c)
provides some notice-and-comment procedures for rulings that have the
" `effect of changing a practice.' " 185 F. 3d 1304, 1307, n. 1 (1999). The
appeals court noted that this case does not involve such a ruling, and
specifically excluded such rulings from the reach of its holding. Ibid.

3 As amended by legislation effective after Customs modified its classification ruling in this case, 19 U. S. C. $ 1625(c) provides that a ruling or
decision that would "modify . . . or revoke a prior interpretive ruling
or decision which has been in effect for at least 60 days" or would "have
the effect of modifying the treatment previously accorded by the Customs
Service to substantially identical transactions" shall be "published in the
Customs Bulletin. The Secretary shall give interested parties an opportunity to submit, during not less than the 30-day period after the date of
such publication, comments on the correctness of the proposed ruling or

Between 1989 and 1993, Customs repeatedly treated dayplanners under the "other" HTSUS subheading. In January 1993, however, Customs changed its position, and issueda Headquarters ruling letter classifying Mead's day planners
as "Diaries . . . , bound" subject to tariff under subheading
4820.10.20. That letter was short on explanation, App. toBrief in Opposition 4a-6a, but after Mead's protest, Customs

Headquarters issued a new letter, carefully reasoned butnever published, reaching the same conclusion, App. to Pet.
for Cert. 28a-47a. This letter considered two definitions of
"diary" from the Oxford English Dictionary, the first covering a daily journal of the past day's events, the second a book
including " `printed dates for daily memoranda and jottings;
also . . . calendars . . . .' " Id., at 33a-34a (quoting Oxford
English Dictionary 321 (Compact ed. 1982)). Customs concluded that "diary" was not confined to the first, in part
because the broader definition reflects commercial usage
and hence the "commercial identity of these items in the
marketplace." App. to Pet. for Cert. 34a. As for the definition of "bound," Customs concluded that HTSUS was not
referring to "bookbinding," but to a less exact sort of fastening described in the Harmonized Commodity Description and
Coding System Explanatory Notes to Heading 4820, which
spoke of binding by " `reinforcements or fittings of metal,
plastics, etc.' " Id., at 45a.

Customs rejected Mead's further protest of the second
Headquarters ruling letter, and Mead filed suit in the
Court of International Trade (CIT). The CIT granted the
Government's motion for summary judgment, adopting Customs's reasoning without saying anything about deference.
17 F. Supp. 2d 1004 (1998).

Mead then went to the United States Court of Appeals
for the Federal Circuit. While the case was pending there
this Court decided United States v. Haggar Apparel Co., 526

533US1 Unit: $U76 [11-01-02 19:12:19] PAGES PGT: OPLG
226 UNITED STATES v. MEAD CORP.

Opinion of the Court
U. S. 380 (1999), holding that Customs regulations receivethe deference described in

Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural
Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984). Theappeals court requested briefing on the impact of

Haggar,
and the Government argued that classification rulings, likeCustoms regulations, deserve

Chevron deference.
The Federal Circuit, however, reversed the CIT and held
that Customs classification rulings should not get Chevrondeference, owing to differences from the regulations at issue

in Haggar. Rulings are not preceded by notice and com-ment as under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5
U. S. C. $ 553, they "do not carry the force of law and are not,
like regulations, intended to clarify the rights and obligations of importers beyond the specific case under review."
185 F. 3d, at 1307. The appeals court thought classification rulings had a weaker Chevron claim even than Internal
Revenue Service interpretive rulings, to which that court
gives no deference; unlike rulings by the IRS, Customs rulings issue from many locations and need not be published.
185 F. 3d, at 1307-1308.

The Court of Appeals accordingly gave no deference at
all to the ruling classifying the Mead day planners and rejected the agency's reasoning as to both "diary" and "bound."
It thought that planners were not diaries because they had
no space for "relatively extensive notations about events,
observations, feelings, or thoughts" in the past. Id., at
1310. And it concluded that diaries "bound" in subheading
4810.10.20 presupposed "unbound" diaries, such that treating
ring-fastened diaries as "bound" would leave the "unbound
diary" an empty category. Id., at 1311.

We granted certiorari, 530 U. S. 1202 (2000), in order to
consider the limits of Chevron deference owed to administrative practice in applying a statute. We hold that administrative implementation of a particular statutory provision
qualifies for Chevron deference when it appears that Congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make

Opinion of the Court
rules carrying the force of law, and that the agency inter-pretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority. Delegation of such authority maybe shown in a variety of ways, as by an agency's power to
engage in adjudication or notice-and-comment rulemaking,or by some other indication of a comparable congressional
intent. The Customs ruling at issue here fails to qualify,although the possibility that it deserves some deference
under Skidmore leads us to vacate and remand.

When Congress has "explicitly left a gap for an agency tofill, there is an express delegation of authority to the agency

to elucidate a specific provision of the statute by regulation,"
Chevron, 467 U. S., at 843-844, and any ensuing regulationis binding in the courts unless procedurally defective, arbitrary or capricious in substance, or manifestly contrary tothe statute.

and while not all of those choices bind judges to followthem, they certainly may influence courts facing questions
the agencies have already answered. "[T]he well-reasonedviews of the agencies implementing a statute `constitute a

Opinion of the Court
Since 1984, we have identified a category of interpretivechoices distinguished by an additional reason for judicial

deference. This Court in Chevron recognized that Congressnot only engages in express delegation of specific interpretive authority, but that "[s]ometimes the legislative dele-gation to an agency on a particular question is implicit."
467 U. S., at 844. Congress, that is, may not have expressly
delegated authority or responsibility to implement a particu-lar provision or fill a particular gap. Yet it can still be apparent from the agency's generally conferred authority andother statutory circumstances that Congress would expect
the agency to be able to speak with the force of law when it
addresses ambiguity in the statute or fills a space in the
enacted law, even one about which "Congress did not actually have an intent" as to a particular result. Id., at 845.
When circumstances implying such an expectation exist, a
reviewing court has no business rejecting an agency's exercise of its generally conferred authority to resolve a particular statutory ambiguity simply because the agency's
chosen resolution seems unwise, see id., at 845-846, but is
obliged to accept the agency's position if Congress has not
previously spoken to the point at issue and the agency's interpretation is reasonable, see id., at 842-845; cf. 5 U. S. C.

$ 706(2) (a reviewing court shall set aside agency action,
findings, and conclusions found to be "arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance
with law").

We have recognized a very good indicator of delegation
meriting Chevron treatment in express congressional authorizations to engage in the process of rulemaking or adjudication that produces regulations or rulings for which
deference is claimed. See, e. g., EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244, 257 (1991) (no Chevron deference
to agency guideline where congressional delegation did
not include the power to " `promulgate rules or regulations' "

Breyer, J., dissenting) (where it is in doubtthat Congress actually intended to delegate particular interpretive authority to an agency, Chevron is "inapplicable").
It is fair to assume generally that Congress contemplatesadministrative action with the effect of law when it provides for a relatively formal administrative procedure tending to foster the fairness and deliberation that should under-lie a pronouncement of such force.

(South Dakota), N. A., 517 U. S. 735, 741 (1996) (APA noticeand comment "designed to assure due deliberation"). Thus,

the overwhelming number of our cases applying Chevrondeference have reviewed the fruits of notice-and-comment
rulemaking or formal adjudication.12 That said, and as sig11 See Merrill & Hickman, Chevron's Domain, 89 Geo. L. J. 833, 872 (2001)
("[I]f Chevron rests on a presumption about congressional intent, then
Chevron should apply only where Congress would want Chevron to apply.
In delineating the types of delegations of agency authority that trigger
Chevron deference, it is therefore important to determine whether a
plausible case can be made that Congress would want such a delegation to
mean that agencies enjoy primary interpretational authority").

nificant as notice-and-comment is in pointing to Chevronauthority, the want of that procedure here does not decide

the case, for we have sometimes found reasons for Chev-ron deference even when no such administrative formality
was required and none was afforded, see, e. g., NationsBankof N. C., N. A. v. Variable Annuity Life Ins. Co., 513 U. S.
251, 256-257, 263 (1995).13 The fact that the tariff classifi-cation here was not a product of such formal process does
not alone, therefore, bar the application of Chevron.There are, nonetheless, ample reasons to deny

Chevrondeference here. The authorization for classification rulings,

and Customs's practice in making them, present a case farremoved not only from notice-and-comment process, but
from any other circumstances reasonably suggesting thatCongress ever thought of classification rulings as deserving
the deference claimed for them here.

tion rulings with the force of law. We are not, of course,here making any global statement about Customs's authority, for it is true that the general rulemaking power con-ferred on Customs, see 19 U. S. C. $ 1624, authorizes some
regulation with the force of law, or "legal norms," as we putit in Haggar, 526 U. S., at 391.

14 It is true as well that Congress had classification rulings in mind when it explicitlyauthorized, in a parenthetical, the issuance of "regulations

establishing procedures for the issuance of binding rulingsprior to the entry of the merchandise concerned," 19 U. S. C.

$ 1502(a).15 The reference to binding classifications does not,however, bespeak the legislative type of activity that would
naturally bind more than the parties to the ruling, once thegoods classified are admitted into this country. And though
the statute's direction to disseminate "information" neces-sary to "secure" uniformity,

ibid., seems to assume that aruling may be precedent in later transactions, precedential

value alone does not add up to Chevron entitlement; inter-pretive rules may sometimes function as precedents, see
Strauss, The Rulemaking Continuum, 41 Duke L. J. 1463,1472-1473 (1992), and they enjoy no

Chevron status as aclass. In any event, any precedential claim of a classification

ruling is counterbalanced by the provision for independentreview of Customs classifications by the CIT, see 28 U. S. C.

$$ 2638-2640; the scheme for CIT review includes a provisionthat treats classification rulings on par with the Secretary's
rulings on "valuation, rate of duty, marking, restricted mer14 Cf. Adams Fruit Co. v. Barrett, 494 U. S. 638, 649-650 (1990) (although
Congress required the Secretary of Labor to promulgate standards implementing certain provisions of the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural

delegated authority are entitled to deference," the Secretary's interpretation of the Act's enforcement provisions is not entitled to Chevron deference because "[n]o such delegation regarding [those] provisions is evident
in the statute").

15 The ruling in question here, however, does not fall within that

category.

It is difficult, in fact, to see in the agency practice itselfany indication that Customs ever set out with a lawmaking

pretense in mind when it undertook to make classificationslike these. Customs does not generally engage in noticeand-comment practice when issuing them, and their treat-ment by the agency makes it clear that a letter's binding
character as a ruling stops short of third parties; Customshas regarded a classification as conclusive only as between
itself and the importer to whom it was issued, 19 CFR$ 177.9(c) (2000), and even then only until Customs has given
advance notice of intended change, $$ 177.9(a), (c). Otherimporters are in fact warned against assuming any right of
detrimental reliance. $ 177.9(c).Indeed, to claim that classifications have legal force is to
ignore the reality that 46 different Customs offices issue10,000 to 15,000 of them each year, see Brief for Respondent 5; CITBA Brief 6 (citing Treasury Advisory Committeeon the Commercial Operations of the United States Customs Service, Report of the COAC Subcommittee on OR&R,Exhs. 1, 3 (Jan. 26, 2000) (reprinted in App. to CITBA
Brief 20a-21a)). Any suggestion that rulings intended tohave the force of law are being churned out at a rate of

10,000 a year at an agency's 46 scattered offices is simplyself-refuting. Although the circumstances are less startling
here, with a Headquarters letter in issue, none of the rele-vant statutes recognizes this category of rulings as separate
or different from others; there is thus no indication that a

not raised below, $ 2638, and "shall make its determinations upon the basis
of the record made before the court," rather than that developed by Customs, $ 2640(a); see generally Haggar Apparel, 526 U. S., at 391.

Opinion of the Court
more potent delegation might have been understood as goingto Headquarters even when Headquarters provides developed reasoning, as it did in this instance.Nor do the amendments to the statute made effective after
this case arose disturb our conclusion. The new law re-quires Customs to provide notice-and-comment procedures
only when modifying or revoking a prior classification rul-ing or modifying the treatment accorded to substantially
identical transactions, 19 U. S. C. $ 1625(c); and under its reg-ulations, Customs sees itself obliged to provide notice-andcomment procedures only when "changing a practice" so asto produce a tariff increase, or in the imposition of a restriction or prohibition, or when Customs Headquarters deter-mines that "the matter is of sufficient importance to involve
the interests of domestic industry," 19 CFR $$ 177.10(c)(1),(2) (2000). The statutory changes reveal no new congressional objective of treating classification decisions generallyas rulemaking with force of law, nor do they suggest any
intent to create a Chevron patchwork of classification rul-ings, some with force of law, some without.

In sum, classification rulings are best treated like "inter-pretations contained in policy statements, agency manuals,
and enforcement guidelines." Christensen, 529 U. S., at 587.They are beyond the Chevron pale.

C
To agree with the Court of Appeals that Customs rulingletters do not fall within Chevron is not, however, to place

them outside the pale of any deference whatever. Chevrondid nothing to eliminate Skidmore's holding that an agency's
interpretation may merit some deference whatever its form,given the "specialized experience and broader investigations and information" available to the agency, 323 U. S.,at 139, and given the value of uniformity in its administrative
and judicial understandings of what a national law requires,
id., at 140. See generally Metropolitan Stevedore Co. v.

from the exercise of . . . delegated lawmaking powers").

There is room at least to raise a Skidmore claim here,
where the regulatory scheme is highly detailed, and Customs
can bring the benefit of specialized experience to bear on the
subtle questions in this case: whether the daily planner with
room for brief daily entries falls under "diaries," when diaries are grouped with "notebooks and address books, bound;
memorandum pads, letter pads and similar articles," HTSUS
subheading 4820.10.20; and whether a planner with a ring
binding should qualify as "bound," when a binding may be
typified by a book, but also may have "reinforcements or
fittings of metal, plastics, etc.," Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System Explanatory Notes to Heading 4820, p. 687 (cited in Customs Headquarters letter, App.

its "power to persuade," Skidmore, supra, at 140; see also
Christensen, 529 U. S., at 587; id., at 595 (Stevens, J., dissenting); id., at 596-597 (Breyer, J., dissenting). Such a
ruling may surely claim the merit of its writer's thoroughness, logic, and expertness, its fit with prior interpretations,
and any other sources of weight.

D
Underlying the position we take here, like the position
expressed by Justice Scalia in dissent, is a choice about
the best way to deal with an inescapable feature of the

533US1 Unit: $U76 [11-01-02 19:12:19] PAGES PGT: OPLG
236 UNITED STATES v. MEAD CORP.

Opinion of the Court
body of congressional legislation authorizing administrativeaction. That feature is the great variety of ways in which

the laws invest the Government's administrative arms withdiscretion, and with procedures for exercising it, in giving
meaning to Acts of Congress. Implementation of a statutemay occur in formal adjudication or the choice to defend
against judicial challenge; it may occur in a central boardor office or in dozens of enforcement agencies dotted across
the country; its institutional lawmaking may be confinedto the resolution of minute detail or extend to legislative
rulemaking on matters intentionally left by Congress to beworked out at the agency level.

Although we all accept the position that the Judiciaryshould defer to at least some of this multifarious administrative action, we have to decide how to take account of thegreat range of its variety. If the primary objective is to
simplify the judicial process of giving or withholding def-erence, then the diversity of statutes authorizing discretionary administrative action must be declared irrelevantor minimized. If, on the other hand, it is simply implausible that Congress intended such a broad range of statutoryauthority to produce only two varieties of administrative
action, demanding either Chevron deference or none at all,then the breadth of the spectrum of possible agency action
must be taken into account. Justice Scalia's first priorityover the years has been to limit and simplify. The Court's
choice has been to tailor deference to variety.17 This accept17 Compare Christensen v. Harris County, 529 U. S. 576, 587 (2000)

Opinion of the Court
ance of the range of statutory variation has led the Court to
recognize more than one variety of judicial deference, just as
the Court has recognized a variety of indicators that Congress would expect Chevron deference.18

Our respective choices are repeated today. Justice
Scalia would pose the question of deference as an eitheror choice. On his view that Chevron rendered Skidmore
anachronistic, when courts owe any deference it is Chevron
deference that they owe, post, at 250. Whether courts do
owe deference in a given case turns, for him, on whether the
agency action (if reasonable) is "authoritative," post, at 257.
The character of the authoritative derives, in turn, not from
breadth of delegation or the agency's procedure in implementing it, but is defined as the "official" position of an
agency, ibid., and may ultimately be a function of administrative persistence alone, ante, at 258.

The Court, on the other hand, said nothing in Chevron to
eliminate Skidmore's recognition of various justifications for
deference depending on statutory circumstances and agency
action; Chevron was simply a case recognizing that even
without express authority to fill a specific statutory gap,
circumstances pointing to implicit congressional delegation
present a particularly insistent call for deference. Indeed,
in holding here that Chevron left Skidmore intact and applicable where statutory circumstances indicate no intent to
delegate general authority to make rules with force of law,
or where such authority was not invoked, we hold nothing
more than we said last Term in response to the particular

(urging broader application of Chevron).

18 It is, of course, true that the limit of Chevron deference is not marked

by a hard-edged rule. But Chevron itself is a good example showing
when Chevron deference is warranted, while this is a good case showing
when it is not. Judges in other, perhaps harder, cases will make reasoned
choices between the two examples, the way courts have always done.

statutory circumstances in Christensen, to which Justice
Scalia then took exception, see 529 U. S., at 589, just as hedoes again today.

We think, in sum, that Justice Scalia's efforts to sim-plify ultimately run afoul of Congress's indications that different statutes present different reasons for consideringrespect for the exercise of administrative authority or deference to it. Without being at odds with congressional intentmuch of the time, we believe that judicial responses to administrative action must continue to differentiate betweenChevron and Skidmore, and that continued recognition of
Skidmore is necessary for just the reasons Justice Jacksongave when that case was decided.

Since the Skidmore assessment called for here ought to bemade in the first instance by the Court of Appeals for the

19 Surely Justice Jackson's practical criteria, along with Chevron's concern with congressional understanding, provide more reliable guideposts
than conclusory references to the "authoritative" or "official." Even
if those terms provided a true criterion, there would have to be something wrong with a standard that accorded the status of substantive law
to every one of 10,000 "official" customs classifications rulings turned out
each year from over 46 offices placed around the country at the Nation's
entryways. Justice Scalia tries to avoid that result by limiting what
is "authoritative" or "official" to a pronouncement that expresses the
"judgment of central agency management, approved at the highest levels,"
as distinct from the pronouncements of "underlings," post, at 259, n. 6.
But that analysis would not entitle a Headquarters ruling to Chevron deference; the "highest level" at Customs is the source of the regulation at
issue in Haggar, the Commissioner of Customs with the approval of the
Secretary of the Treasury. 526 U. S., at 386. The Commissioner did not
issue the Headquarters ruling. What Justice Scalia has in mind here
is that because the Secretary approved the Government's position in its
brief to this Court, Chevron deference is due. But if that is so, Chevron
deference was not called for until sometime after the litigation began,
when central management at the highest level decided to defend the
ruling, and the deference is not to the classification ruling as such but
to the brief. This explains why the Court has not accepted Justice
Scalia's position.

Federal Circuit or the CIT, we go no further than to vacate
the judgment and remand the case for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice Scalia, dissenting.
Today's opinion makes an avulsive change in judicial review of federal administrative action. Whereas previously
a reasonable agency application of an ambiguous statutory
provision had to be sustained so long as it represented the
agency's authoritative interpretation, henceforth such an application can be set aside unless "it appears that Congress
delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules
carrying the force of law," as by giving an agency "power to
engage in adjudication or notice-and-comment rulemaking,
or . . . some other [procedure] indicati[ng] comparable congressional intent," and "the agency interpretation claiming
deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority."
Ante, at 226-227.1 What was previously a general presumption of authority in agencies to resolve ambiguity in the statutes they have been authorized to enforce has been changed
to a presumption of no such authority, which must be overcome by affirmative legislative intent to the contrary. And
whereas previously, when agency authority to resolve ambiguity did not exist the court was free to give the statute
what it considered the best interpretation, henceforth the
court must supposedly give the agency view some indeterminate amount of so-called Skidmore deference. Skidmore v.
Swift & Co., 323 U. S. 134 (1944). We will be sorting out the
consequences of the Mead doctrine, which has today replaced
the Chevron doctrine, Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984), for years
to come. I would adhere to our established jurisprudence,

the former. Cf., e. g., ante, at 230.

Only five years ago, the Court described the Chevron doc-trine as follows: "We accord deference to agencies under

Chevron . . . because of a presumption that Congress, whenit left ambiguity in a statute meant for implementation
by an agency, understood that the ambiguity would be re-solved, first and foremost, by the agency, and desired the
agency (rather than the courts) to possess whatever de-gree of discretion the ambiguity allows,"

Smiley v. Citibank
(South Dakota), N. A., 517 U. S. 735, 740-741 (1996) (cit-ing Chevron, supra, at 843-844). Today the Court collapses this doctrine, announcing instead a presumption thatagency discretion does not exist unless the statute, expressly
or impliedly, says so. While the Court disclaims any hard-and-fast rule for determining the existence of discretionconferring intent, it asserts that "a very good indicator[is] express congressional authorizations to engage in the
process of rulemaking or adjudication that produces regu-lations or rulings for which deference is claimed," ante,
at 229. Only when agencies act through "adjudication[,]notice-and-comment rulemaking, or . . . some other [procedure] indicati[ng] comparable congressional intent [whateverthat means]" is

Chevron deference applicable--because these"relatively formal administrative procedure[s] [designed] to

rather than the courts, resolve statutory ambiguities. Ante,at 227, 230. Once it is determined that

ing to traditional interpretive principles and by their ownjudicial lights. No, the Court now resurrects, in full force,

the pre-Chevron doctrine of Skidmore deference, see Skid-more, supra, whereby "[t]he fair measure of deference to an
agency administering its own statute . . . var[ies] with cir-cumstances," including "the degree of the agency's care, its
consistency, formality, and relative expertness, and . . . thepersuasiveness of the agency's position,"

ante, at 228 (foot-notes omitted). The Court has largely replaced Chevron, in

other words, with that test most beloved by a court unwill-ing to be held to rules (and most feared by litigants who
want to know what to expect): th'ol' "totality of the circum-stances" test.

The Court's new doctrine is neither sound in principle norsustainable in practice.

A
As to principle: The doctrine of Chevron--that all authoritative agency interpretations of statutes they are chargedwith administering deserve deference--was rooted in a legal

presumption of congressional intent, important to the di-vision of powers between the Second and Third Branches.
When, Chevron said, Congress leaves an ambiguity in astatute that is to be administered by an executive agency,
it is presumed that Congress meant to give the agency dis-cretion, within the limits of reasonable interpretation, as
to how the ambiguity is to be resolved. By committing en-forcement of the statute to an agency rather than the courts,
Congress committed its initial and primary interpretation tothat branch as well.

There is some question whether Chevron was faithful tothe text of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), which
it did not even bother to cite.2 But it was in accord with the

2 Title 5 U. S. C. $ 706 provides that, in reviewing agency action, the
court shall "decide all relevant questions of law"--which would seem
to mean that all statutory ambiguities are to be resolved judicially. See

origins of federal-court judicial review. Judicial control offederal executive officers was principally exercised through

the prerogative writ of mandamus. See L. Jaffe, JudicialControl of Administrative Action 166, 176-177 (1965). That
writ generally would not issue unless the executive officerwas acting plainly beyond the scope of his authority.

"The questions mooted before the Secretary and de-cided by him were whether the fund is a tribal fund,
whether the tribe is still existing and whether the dis-tribution of the annuities is to be confined to members
of the tribe . . . . These are all questions of law thesolution of which requires a construction of the act of
1889 and other related acts. A reading of these actsshows that they fall short of plainly requiring that

any of the questions be answered in the negative andthat in some aspects they give color to the affirmative
answers of the Secretary. That the construction of theacts insofar as they have a bearing on the first and third
questions is sufficiently uncertain to involve the exerciseof judgment and discretion is rather plain. . . .

. . . . .
"From what has been said it follows that the case isnot one in which mandamus will lie." Wilbur v. United

States ex rel. Kadrie, 281 U. S. 206, 221-222 (1930).
Anthony, The Supreme Court and the APA: Sometimes They Just Don't
Get It, 10 Am. U. Admin. L. J. 1, 9-11 (1996). It could be argued, however, that the legal presumption identified by Chevron left as the only
"questio[n] of law" whether the agency's interpretation had gone beyond the scope of discretion that the statutory ambiguity conferred.
Today's opinion, of course, is no more observant of the APA's text than
Chevron was--and indeed is even more difficult to reconcile with it.
Since the opinion relies upon actual congressional intent to suspend $ 706,
rather than upon a legal presumption against which $ 706 was presumably
enacted, it runs head-on into the provision of the APA which specifies that
the Act's requirements (including the requirement that judges shall "decide all relevant questions of law") cannot be amended except expressly.

Statutory ambiguities, in other words, were left to reason-able resolution by the Executive.

The basis in principle for today's new doctrine can be de-scribed as follows: The background rule is that ambiguity
in legislative instructions to agencies is to be resolved notby the agencies but by the judges. Specific congressional
intent to depart from this rule must be found--and while
there is no single touchstone for such intent it can generallybe found when Congress has authorized the agency to act

through (what the Court says is) relatively formal proce-dures such as informal rulemaking and formal (and informal?) adjudication, and when the agency in fact employs
such procedures. The Court's background rule is contradicted by the origins of judicial review of administrative
action. But in addition, the Court's principal criterion of
congressional intent to supplant its background rule seems
to me quite implausible. There is no necessary connection
between the formality of procedure and the power of the
entity administering the procedure to resolve authoritatively questions of law. The most formal of the procedures
the Court refers to--formal adjudication--is modeled after
the process used in trial courts, which of course are not generally accorded deference on questions of law. The purpose
of such a procedure is to produce a closed record for determination and review of the facts--which implies nothing
about the power of the agency subjected to the procedure to
resolve authoritatively questions of law.

As for informal rulemaking: While formal adjudication
procedures are prescribed (either by statute or by the Constitution), see 5 U. S. C. $$ 554, 556; Wong Yang Sung v. McGrath, 339 U. S. 33, 50 (1950), informal rulemaking is more
typically authorized but not required. Agencies with such
authority are free to give guidance through rulemaking,
but they may proceed to administer their statute case-bycase, "making law" as they implement their program (not
necessarily through formal adjudication). See NLRB v. Bell

Aerospace Co., 416 U. S. 267, 290-295 (1974); SEC v. Chenery
Corp., 332 U. S. 194, 202-203 (1947). Is it likely--or indeed
even plausible--that Congress meant, when such an agencychooses rulemaking, to accord the administrators of that

agency, and their successors, the flexibility of interpreting
the ambiguous statute now one way, and later another;
but, when such an agency chooses case-by-case administration, to eliminate all future agency discretion by having
that same ambiguity resolved authoritatively (and forever)
by the courts? 3 Surely that makes no sense. It is also the
case that certain significant categories of rules--those involving grant and benefit programs, for example, are exempt from the requirements of informal rulemaking. See
5 U. S. C. $ 553(a)(2). Under the Court's novel theory, when
an agency takes advantage of that exemption its rules will
be deprived of Chevron deference, i. e., authoritative effect.
Was this either the plausible intent of the APA rulemaking
exemption, or the plausible intent of the Congress that
established the grant or benefit program?

Some decisions that are neither informal rulemaking nor
formal adjudication are required to be made personally by
a Cabinet Secretary, without any prescribed procedures.
See, e. g., United States v. Giordano, 416 U. S. 505, 508 (1974)
(involving application of 18 U. S. C. $ 2516 (1970 ed.), requiring wiretap applications to be authorized by "[t]he Attorney
General, or any Assistant Attorney General specially designated by the Attorney General"); D. C. Federation of Civic

the Secretary of Transportation to determine that there is
"no feasible and prudent alternative to the use of " publicly
owned parkland for a federally funded highway), cert. denied, 405 U. S. 1030 (1972). Is it conceivable that decisions

specifically committed to these high-level officers are meant
to be accorded no deference, while decisions by an administrative law judge left in place without further discretionary agency review, see 5 U. S. C. $ 557(b), are authoritative?
This seems to me quite absurd, and not at all in accord with
any plausible actual intent of Congress.

B
As for the practical effects of the new rule:

1
The principal effect will be protracted confusion. As
noted above, the one test for Chevron deference that the
Court enunciates is wonderfully imprecise: whether "Congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make
rules carrying the force of law, . . . as by . . . adjudication[,]
notice-and-comment rulemaking, or . . . some other [procedure] indicati[ng] comparable congressional intent." But
even this description does not do justice to the utter flabbiness of the Court's criterion, since, in order to maintain
the fiction that the new test is really just the old one, applied consistently throughout our case law, the Court must
make a virtually open-ended exception to its already imprecise guidance: In the present case, it tells us, the absence
of notice-and-comment rulemaking (and "[who knows?] [of]
some other [procedure] indicati[ng] comparable congressional
intent") is not enough to decide the question of Chevron deference, "for we have sometimes found reasons for Chevron
deference even when no such administrative formality was
required and none was afforded." Ante, at 226-227, 231.
The opinion then goes on to consider a grab bag of other
factors--including the factor that used to be the sole criterion for Chevron deference: whether the interpretation represented the authoritative position of the agency, see ante,

533US1 Unit: $U76 [11-01-02 19:12:19] PAGES PGT: OPLG
246 UNITED STATES v. MEAD CORP.

Scalia, J., dissenting
at 231-234. It is hard to know what the lower courts are tomake of today's guidance.

2
Another practical effect of today's opinion will be an arti-ficially induced increase in informal rulemaking. Buy stock

in the GPO. Since informal rulemaking and formal adju-dication are the only more-or-less safe harbors from the
storm that the Court has unleashed; and since formal adju-dication is not an option but must be mandated by statute
or constitutional command; informal rulemaking--which theCourt was once careful to make voluntary unless required
by statute, see Bell Aerospace, supra, and Chenery, supra--will now become a virtual necessity. As I have described,
the Court's safe harbor requires not merely that the agencyhave been given rulemaking authority, but also that the
agency have employed rulemaking as the means of resolv-ing the statutory ambiguity. (It is hard to understand why
that should be so. Surely the mere conferral of rulemakingauthority demonstrates--if one accepts the Court's logic--a
congressional intent to allow the agency to resolve ambi-guities. And given that intent, what difference does it make
that the agency chooses instead to use another perfectlypermissible means for that purpose?) Moreover, the majority's approach will have a perverse effect on the rulesthat do emerge, given the principle (which the Court leaves
untouched today) that judges must defer to reasonableagency interpretations of their own regulations. See,

e. g.,United States v. Cleveland Indians Baseball Co., 532 U. S.

200, 220 (2001) ("We need not decide whether the [informal]Revenue Rulings themselves are entitled to deference[, . . .
because] the Rulings simply reflect the agency's longstand-ing interpretation of its own regulations"). Agencies will
now have high incentive to rush out barebones, ambiguousrules construing statutory ambiguities, which they can then
in turn further clarify through informal rulings entitled tojudicial respect.

Scalia, J., dissenting

3
Worst of all, the majority's approach will lead to the os-sification of large portions of our statutory law. Where

Chevron applies, statutory ambiguities remain ambiguitiessubject to the agency's ongoing clarification. They create
a space, so to speak, for the exercise of continuing agencydiscretion. As

Chevron itself held, the Environmental Pro-tection Agency can interpret "stationary source" to mean a

single smokestack, can later replace that interpretation withthe "bubble concept" embracing an entire plant, and if that
proves undesirable can return again to the original inter-pretation. 467 U. S., at 853-859, 865-866. For the indeterminately large number of statutes taken out of Chevron bytoday's decision, however, ambiguity (and hence flexibility)
will cease with the first judicial resolution. Skidmore defer-ence gives the agency's current position some vague and uncertain amount of respect, but it does not, like Chevron,
leave the matter within the control of the Executive Branchfor the future. Once the court has spoken, it becomes unlawful for the agency to take a contradictory position; thestatute now says what the court has prescribed. See Neal
v. United States, 516 U. S. 284, 295 (1996); Lechmere, Inc. v.NLRB, 502 U. S. 527, 536-537 (1992); Maislin Industries,
U. S., Inc. v. Primary Steel, Inc., 497 U. S. 116, 131 (1990).It will be bad enough when this ossification occurs as a result
of judicial determination (under today's new principles) thatthere is no affirmative indication of congressional intent to
"delegate"; but it will be positively bizarre when it occurssimply because of an agency's failure to act by rulemaking
(rather than informal adjudication) before the issue is pre-sented to the courts.

One might respond that such ossification would not resultif the agency were simply to readopt its interpretation, after
a court reviewing it under Skidmore had rejected it, by re-promulgating it through one of the

Chevron-eligible proce-dural formats approved by the Court today. Approving this

Scalia, J., dissenting
procedure would be a landmark abdication of judicial power.It is worlds apart from

Chevron proper, where the court does
not purport to give the statute a judicial interpretation--except in identifying the scope of the statutory ambiguity,

as to which the court's judgment is final and irreversible.(Under

Chevron proper, when the agency's authoritative interpretation comes within the scope of that ambiguity--and
the court therefore approves it--the agency will not be"overruling" the court's decision when it later decides that

a different interpretation (still within the scope of the ambi-guity) is preferable.) By contrast, under this view, the reviewing court will not be holding the agency's authorita-tive interpretation within the scope of the ambiguity; but
will be holding that the agency has not used the "delegation-conferring" procedures, and that the court must therefore
interpret the statute on its own--but subject to reversal ifand when the agency uses the proper procedures.

One is reminded of Justice Jackson's words in Chicago &
Southern Air Lines, Inc. v. Waterman S. S. Corp., 333 U. S.
103, 113 (1948):

"The court below considered that after it reviewed
the Board's order its judgment would be submitted tothe President, that his power to disapprove would apply

after as well as before the court acts, and hence that
there would be no chance of a deadlock and no conflictof function. But if the President may completely disregard the judgment of the court, it would be only be-cause it is one the courts were not authorized to render.
Judgments within the powers vested in courts by the
Judiciary Article of the Constitution may not lawfully
be revised, overturned or refused faith and credit by
another Department of Government."

I know of no case, in the entire history of the federal courts,
in which we have allowed a judicial interpretation of a
statute to be set aside by an agency--or have allowed a

533US1 Unit: $U76 [11-01-02 19:12:19] PAGES PGT: OPLG

Scalia, J., dissenting
lower court to render an interpretation of a statute sub-ject to correction by an agency. As recently as 1996, we

rejected an attempt to do precisely that. In Chapman v.
United States, 500 U. S. 453 (1991), we had held that the
weight of the blotter paper bearing the lysergic acid diethyl-amide (LSD) must be counted for purposes of determining

whether the quantity crossed the 10-gram threshold of 21
U. S. C. $ 841(b)(1)(A)(v) imposing a minimum sentence of 10years. At that time the United States Sentencing Commission applied a similar approach under the SentencingGuidelines, but had taken no position regarding the meaning
of the statutory provision. The Commission later changedits Guidelines approach, and, according to the petitioner in
Neal v. United States, 516 U. S. 284 (1996), made clear itsview that the statute bore that meaning as well. The petitioner argued that we should defer to that new approach.We would have none of it.

"Were we, for argument's sake, to adopt petitioner'sview that the Commission intended the commentary as
an interpretation of $ 841(b)(1), and that the last sen-tence of the commentary states the Commission's view
that the dose-based method is consistent with the term`mixture or substance' in the statute, he still would not
prevail. The Commission's dose-based method cannot
be squared with Chapman. . . . In these circumstances,we need not decide what, if any, deference is owed the

Commission in order to reject its alleged contrary inter-pretation. Once we have determined a statute's meaning, we adhere to our ruling under the doctrine of stare
decisis, and we assess an agency's later interpretation of
the statute against that settled law." Id., at 294-295
(citations omitted).

There is, in short, no way to avoid the ossification of federal
law that today's opinion sets in motion. What a court says
is the law after according Skidmore deference will be the

Scalia, J., dissenting
law forever, beyond the power of the agency to change eventhrough rulemaking.

4
And finally, the majority's approach compounds the con-fusion it creates by breathing new life into the anachronism

of Skidmore, which sets forth a sliding scale of deferenceowed an agency's interpretation of a statute that is dependent "upon the thoroughness evident in [the agency's] con-sideration, the validity of its reasoning, its consistency with
earlier and later pronouncements, and all those factors whichgive it power to persuade, if lacking power to control"; in
this way, the appropriate measure of deference will be ac-corded the "body of experience and informed judgment"
that such interpretations often embody, 323 U. S., at 140.Justice Jackson's eloquence notwithstanding, the rule of
Skidmore deference is an empty truism and a trifling state-ment of the obvious: A judge should take into account the
well-considered views of expert observers.It was possible to live with the indeterminacy of Skidmore deference in earlier times. But in an era when fed-eral statutory law administered by federal agencies is pervasive, and when the ambiguities (intended or unintended)that those statutes contain are innumerable, totality-of-thecircumstances Skidmore deference is a recipe for uncer-tainty, unpredictability, and endless litigation. To condemn
a vast body of agency action to that regime (all except rule-making, formal (and informal?) adjudication, and whatever
else might now and then be included within today's in-tentionally vague formulation of affirmative congressional
intent to "delegate") is irresponsible.

II
The Court's pretense that today's opinion is nothing morethan application of our prior case law does not withstand

analysis. It is, to be sure, impossible to demonstrate thatany of our cases contradicts the rule of decision that the

533US1 Unit: $U76 [11-01-02 19:12:19] PAGES PGT: OPLG

Scalia, J., dissenting
Court prescribes, because the Court prescribes none. Moreprecisely, it at one and the same time (1) renders meaningless

its newly announced requirement that there be an affirma-tive congressional intent to have ambiguities resolved by
the administering agency, and (2) ensures that no prior de-cision can possibly be cited which contradicts that requirement, by simply announcing that all prior decisions according
Chevron deference exemplify the multifarious ways in whichthat congressional intent can be manifested: "[A]s significant

as notice-and-comment is in pointing to Chevron authority,the want of that procedure here does not decide the case, for
we have sometimes found reasons for Chevron deferenceeven when no such administrative formality was required
and none was afforded," ante, at 230-231.4

4 As a sole, teasing example of those "sometimes" the Court cites NationsBank of N. C., N. A. v. Variable Annuity Life Ins. Co., 513 U. S. 251
(1995), explaining in a footnote that our "longstanding precedent" evinced
a tradition of great deference to the " `deliberative conclusions' " of the
Comptroller of the Currency as to the meaning of the banking laws the
Comptroller is charged with enforcing. Ante, at 231, n. 13. How it is
that a tradition of great judicial deference to the agency head provides
affirmative indication of congressional intent to delegate authority to resolve statutory ambiguities challenges the intellect and the imagination.
If the point is that Congress must have been aware of that tradition
of great deference when it enacted the law at issue, the same could be said
of the Customs Service, and indeed of all agencies. See, e. g., 4 K. Davis,
Administrative Law Treatise $ 30.08, pp. 237-238 (1958) (describing the
"great weight" accorded the "determination[s]" of the Federal Trade Commission (quoting FTC v. Cement Institute, 333 U. S. 683, 720 (1948)); Report of the Attorney General's Committee on Administrative Procedure,
S. Doc. No. 8, 77th Cong., 1st Sess., 90-91 (1941). Indeed, since our opinion in Chevron Congress must have been aware that we would defer to
all authoritative agency resolutions of statutory ambiguities. Needless
to say, NationsBank itself makes no mention of any such affirmative indication, because it was never the law. The many other cases that contradict the Court's new rule will presumably be explained, like NationsBank,
as other "modes" of displaying affirmative congressional intent. If a tradition of judicial deference can be called that with a straight face, what
cannot be?

252 UNITED STATES v. MEAD CORP.

Scalia, J., dissenting
The principles central to today's opinion have no anteced-ent in our jurisprudence.

Chevron, the case that the opinion
purportedly explicates, made no mention of the "relativelyformal administrative procedure[s],"

ante, at 230, that the
Court today finds the best indication of an affirmative in-tent by Congress to have ambiguities resolved by the administering agency. Which is not so remarkable, since Chevron
made no mention of any need to find such an affirmative in-tent; it said that in the event of statutory ambiguity agency

authority to clarify was to be presumed. And our caseshave followed that prescription.

Six years ago, we unanimously accorded Chevron deference to an interpretation of the National Bank Act, 12
U. S. C. $ 24 Seventh (1988 ed. and Supp. V), contained in a
letter to a private party from a Senior Deputy Comptroller
of the Currency. See NationsBank of N. C., N. A. v. Variable Annuity Life Ins. Co., 513 U. S. 251, 255, 257 (1995).
We did so because the letter represented (and no one contested) that it set forth the official position of the Comptroller of the Currency, see id., at 263.

Several cases decided virtually in the wake of Chevron,
which the Court conveniently ignores, demonstrate that Congress could not (if it was reading our opinions) have acted
in reliance on a background assumption that Chevron deference would generally be accorded only to agency interpretations arrived at through formal adjudication, notice-andcomment rulemaking, or other procedures assuring "fairness
and deliberation," ante, at 230. In FDIC v. Philadelphia
Gear Corp., 476 U. S. 426, 438-439 (1986), we accorded Chevron deference to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's interpretation of the statutory term "deposit" reflected in a course of unstructured administrative actions,
and gave particular weight to the agency's "contemporaneous understanding" reflected in the response given by
an FDIC official to a question asked at a meeting of FDIC
and bank officials. It was clear that the position reflected

Scalia, J., dissenting
the official position of the agency, and that was enough tocommand

Chevron deference. In Young v. Community Nutrition Institute, 476 U. S. 974 (1986), the statutory ambi-guity at issue pertained to a provision that "the Secretary

[of Health and Human Services] shall promulgate regulationslimiting the quantity [of any poisonous or deleterious substance added to any food] to such extent as he finds necessary for the protection of public health." The Secretary hadregularly interpreted the phrase "to such extent as he finds

necessary" as conferring discretion not to issue a rule, ratherthan merely discretion regarding the quantity that the rule
would permit. This interpretation was not, of course, reflected in any formal adjudication, and had not been the
subject of any informal rulemaking--it was the Secretary's
understanding consistently applied in the course of the
Department's practice. We accorded it Chevron deference,
as unquestionably we should have. And in Mead Corp. v.
Tilley, 490 U. S. 714 (1989), a private suit by retirees against
their former employer under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), we accorded Chevron
deference to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation's interpretation of $ 4044(a) of ERISA, 29 U. S. C. $ 1344(a) (1982
ed. and Supp. V), that was reflected only in an amicus brief
to this Court and in several opinion letters issued without
benefit of any prescribed procedures. See 490 U. S., at 722.

I could continue to enumerate cases according Chevron
deference to agency interpretations not arrived at through
formal proceedings--for example, Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation v. LTV Corp., 496 U. S. 633, 642-643, 647-648
(1990) (according Chevron deference to the PBGC's interpretation of the requirements for its restoring a terminated
plan under $ 4047 of ERISA, 29 U. S. C. $ 1347 (1988 ed.),
which interpretation was reflected in nothing more than
the agency's act of issuing a notice of restoration). Suffice
it to say that many cases flatly contradict the theory of
Chevron set forth in today's opinion, and with one exception

533US1 Unit: $U76 [11-01-02 19:12:19] PAGES PGT: OPLG
254 UNITED STATES v. MEAD CORP.

Scalia, J., dissenting
not a single case can be found with language that supportsthe theory. That exception, a very recent one, deserves extended discussion.In

Christensen v. Harris County, 529 U. S. 576 (2000), the
Court said the following:

"[W]e confront an interpretation contained in an
opinion letter, not one arrived at after, for example, aformal adjudication or notice-and-comment rulemaking.

Interpretations such as those in opinion letters--likeinterpretations contained in policy statements, agency
manuals, and enforcement guidelines, all of which lackthe force of law--do not warrant

Chevron-style deference." Id., at 587.

This statement was dictum, unnecessary to the Court's holding. Since the Court went on to find that the Secretary ofLabor's position "ma[de] little sense" given the text and

structure of the statute, id., at 585-586, Chevron deferencecould not have been accorded

no matter what the conditions
for its application. See 529 U. S., at 591 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). It was, moreover, dictum unsupported by the precedent that the Court
cited.

The Christensen majority followed its above-quoted dictum with a string citation of three cases, none of which
sustains its point. In Reno v. Koray, 515 U. S. 50 (1995),
we had no occasion to consider what level of deference was
owed the Bureau of Prisons' interpretation of 18 U. S. C.

$ 3585(b) set forth in an internal agency guideline, because
our opinion made clear that we would have independently
arrived at the same interpretation on our own, see 515 U. S.,
at 57-60. And although part of one sentence in Koray might

since the sentence ends by observing that the statement was
"a `permissible construction of the statute' " under Chevron.
515 U. S., at 61 (quoting Chevron, 467 U. S., at 843). In the
second case cited, EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co., 499
U. S. 244 (1991), it was again unnecessary to our holding
whether the agency's interpretation of the statute warranted
Chevron deference, since the "longstanding . . . `canon of
[statutory] construction' " disfavoring extraterritoriality, 499
U. S., at 248, would have required the same result even if
Chevron applied. See 499 U. S., at 260 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). While the opinion
did purport to accord the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission's informally promulgated interpretation only
Skidmore deference, it did so because the Court thought
itself bound by its pre-Chevron, EEOC-specific decision in
General Elec. Co. v. Gilbert, 429 U. S. 125 (1976), which noted
that " `Congress, in enacting Title VII, did not' " intend to
give the EEOC substantive authority to resolve statutory
ambiguities, Arabian American Oil, supra, at 257 (quoting
Gilbert, supra, at 141). Lastly, in Martin v. Occupational
Safety and Health Review Comm'n, 499 U. S. 144 (1991),
the question of the level of deference owed the Secretary of
Labor's interpretation of the Occupational Safety and Health
Act of 1970, 84 Stat. 1590, as amended, 29 U. S. C. $ 651
et seq., was neither presented by the case nor considered in
our opinion. The only question before the Court was which
of two competing interpretations of 29 CFR $ 1910.1029
(1990)--the Secretary's or the Occupational Safety and
Health Review Commission's--should have been deferred to
by the court below. See 499 U. S., at 150. The dicta the

and Judicial Deference to Agency Interpretations of AgencyRules, 96 Colum. L. Rev. 612 (1996).

To make matters worse, the arguments marshaled byChristensen in support of its dictum--its observation that
"interpretations contained in policy statements, agency man-uals, and enforcement guidelines, all . . . lack the force of
law," and its citation of 1 K. Davis & R. Pierce, Administra-tive Law Treatise $ 3.5 (3d ed. 1994), 529 U. S., at 587--are
not only unpersuasive but bear scant resemblance to the rea-soning of today's opinion. Davis and Pierce, and Professor
Robert Anthony upon whom they rely, see Anthony, WhichAgency Interpretations Should Bind Citizens and the
Courts?, 7 Yale J. on Reg. 1 (1990), do indeed set forth theargument I have criticized above, that congressional authorization of informal rulemaking or formal (and perhaps eveninformal) adjudication somehow bespeaks a congressional
intent to "delegate" power to resolve statutory ambiguities.But their analysis does not permit the broad add-ons that
the Court's opinion contains--"some other [procedure] indi-cati[ng] comparable congressional intent," ante, at 227, and
"we have sometimes found reasons for Chevron deferenceeven when no such administrative formality was required
and none was afforded," ante, at 231.

III
To decide the present case, I would adhere to the originalformulation of

Chevron. " `The power of an administrativeagency to administer a congressionally created . . . program

necessarily requires the formulation of policy and the mak-ing of rules to fill any gap left, implicitly or explicitly, by
Congress,' " 467 U. S., at 843 (quoting Morton v. Ruiz, 415U. S. 199, 231 (1974)). We accordingly presume--and our
precedents have made clear to Congress that we presume--that, absent some clear textual indication to the contrary,
"Congress, when it left ambiguity in a statute meant for im533US1 Unit: $U76 [11-01-02 19:12:19] PAGES PGT: OPLG

Scalia, J., dissenting
plementation by an agency, understood that the ambiguity
would be resolved, first and foremost, by the agency, and
desired the agency (rather than the courts) to possess whatever degree of discretion the ambiguity allows," Smiley, 517
U. S., at 740-741 (citing Chevron, supra, at 843-844). Chevron sets forth an across-the-board presumption, which operates as a background rule of law against which Congress
legislates: Ambiguity means Congress intended agency discretion. Any resolution of the ambiguity by the administering agency that is authoritative--that represents the official
position of the agency--must be accepted by the courts if it
is reasonable.

Nothing in the statute at issue here displays an intent
to modify the background presumption on which Chevron
deference is based. The Court points, ante, at 233, n. 16, to
28 U. S. C. $ 2640(a), which provides that, in reviewing the
ruling by the Customs Service, the Court of International
Trade (CIT) "shall make its determinations upon the basis of
the record made before the court." But records are made
to determine the facts, not the law. All this provision means
is that new evidence may be introduced at the CIT stage;
it says nothing about whether the CIT must respect the
Customs Service's authoritative interpretation of the law.
More significant than $ 2640(a), insofar as the CIT's obligation to defer to the Customs Service's legal interpretations
is concerned, is $ 2639(a)(1), which requires the CIT to accord
a "presum[ption of] correct[ness]" to the Customs Service's
decision. Another provision cited by the Court, ante, at
233, n. 16, is $ 2638, which provides that the CIT, "by rule,
may consider any new ground in support" of the challenge
to the Customs Service's ruling. Once again, it is impossible to see how this has any connection to the degree of
deference the CIT must accord the Customs Service's interpretation of its statute. Such "new ground[s]" may be
intervening or newly discovered facts, or some intervening

law or regulation that might render the Customs Service'sruling unsound.

5

There is no doubt that the Customs Service's inter-pretation represents the authoritative view of the agency.

Although the actual ruling letter was signed by only theDirector of the Commercial Rulings Branch of Customs
Headquarters' Office of Regulations and Rulings, see Pet.for Cert. 47a, the Solicitor General of the United States has
filed a brief, cosigned by the General Counsel of the Depart-ment of the Treasury, that represents the position set forth
in the ruling letter to be the official position of the CustomsService. Cf.

Christensen, 529 U. S., at 591 (Scalia, J., con-curring in part and concurring in judgment). No one contends that it is merely a "post hoc rationalizatio[n]" or an"agency litigating positio[n] wholly unsupported by regulations, rulings, or administrative practice," Bowen v. George-town Univ. Hospital, 488 U. S. 204, 212 (1988).

5 The Court also states that "[i]t is hard to imagine" that Congress
would have intended courts to defer to classification rulings since "the
scheme for CIT review includes a provision that treats classification
rulings on par with the Secretary's rulings on `valuation, rate of duty,
marking, restricted merchandise, entry requirements, drawbacks, vessel
repairs, or similar matters,' " ante, at 232-233 (quoting 28 U. S. C.

$ 1581(h), and citing $ 2639(b)). I fail to see why this is hard to imagine
at all. If anything, the fact that "the scheme for CIT review . . . treats
classification rulings on par with the Secretary's rulings on" such important matters as " `valuation, rate of duty, . . . restricted merchandise [and]
entry requirements,' " ante, at 232-233, which often require interpretation
of the Nation's customs and tariff statutes, only strengthens the case for
according Chevron deference to whatever statutory interpretations (as opposed to factual determinations) such rulings embody. In other words,
the Court's point is wrong--indeed, the Court's point cuts deeply into its
own case--unless the Court believes that the Secretary's personal rulings
on the legal criteria for imposing particular rates of duty, or for determining restricted merchandise, are entitled to no deference.

6 The Court's parting shot, that "there would have to be something

wrong with a standard that accorded the status of substantive law to
every one of 10,000 `official' customs classifications rulings turned out
each year from over 46 offices placed around the country at the Nation's
entryways," ante, at 238, n. 19, misses the mark. I do not disagree. The

259Cite as: 533 U. S. 218 (2001)
Scalia, J., dissenting
There is also no doubt that the Customs Service's inter-pretation is a reasonable one, whether or not judges would

consider it the best. I will not belabor this point, since theCourt evidently agrees: An interpretation that was unreasonable would not merit the remand that the Court decreesfor consideration of Skidmore deference.

IV
Finally, and least importantly, even were I to accept theCourt's revised version of

Chevron as a correct statement

"authoritativeness" of an agency interpretation does not turn upon
whether it has been enunciated by someone who is actually employed
by the agency. It must represent the judgment of central agency management, approved at the highest levels. I would find that condition to
have been satisfied when, a ruling having been attacked in court, the
general counsel of the agency has determined that it should be defended.
If one thinks that that does not impart sufficient authoritativeness, then
surely the line has been crossed when, as here, the General Counsel of
the agency and the Solicitor General of the United States have assured
this Court that the position represents the agency's authoritative view.
(Contrary to the Court's suggestion, there would be nothing bizarre about
the fact that this latter approach would entitle the ruling to deference
here, though it would not have been entitled to deference in the lower
courts. Affirmation of the official agency position before this court--if
that is thought necessary--is no different from the agency's issuing a
new rule after the Court of Appeals determination. It establishes a new
legal basis for the decision, which this Court must take into account
(or remand for that purpose), even though the Court of Appeals could not.
See Thorpe v. Housing Authority of Durham, 393 U. S. 268, 282 (1969);
see also United States v. Schooner Peggy, 1 Cranch 103 (1801).)

The authoritativeness of the agency ruling may not be a bright-line
standard--but it is infinitely brighter than the line the Court asks us to
draw today, between a statute such as the one at issue in NationsBank
that (according to the Court) does display an "affirmative intent" to "delegate" interpretive authority, and innumerable indistinguishable statutes
that (according to the Court) do not. And, most important of all, it is a
line that focuses attention on the right question: not whether Congress
"affirmatively intended" to delegate interpretive authority (if it entrusted
administration of the statute to an agency, it did, because that is how
our system works); but whether it is truly the agency's considered view,
or just the opinions of some underlings, that are at issue.

Scalia, J., dissenting
of the law, I would still accord deference to the tariff classification ruling at issue in this case. For the case is indistinguishable, in that regard, from NationsBank of N. C.,
N. A. v. Variable Annuity Life Ins. Co., 513 U. S. 251 (1995),
which the Court acknowledges as an instance in which Chevron deference is warranted notwithstanding the absence
of formal adjudication, notice-and-comment rulemaking, or
comparable "administrative formality," ante, at 231. Here,
as in NationsBank, there is a tradition of great deference to
the opinions of the agency head, ante, at 231, n. 13. Just two
Terms ago, we observed:

"As early as 1809, Chief Justice Marshall noted in a customs case that `[i]f the question had been doubtful, the
court would have respected the uniform construction
which it is understood has been given by the treasury
department of the United States upon similar questions.' United States v. Vowell, 5 Cranch 368, 372. See
also P. Reed, The Role of Federal Courts in U. S. Customs & International Trade Law 289 (1997) (`Consistent
with the Chevron methodology, and as has long been
the rule in customs cases, customs regulations are sustained if they represent reasonable interpretations of
the statute'); cf. Zenith Radio Corp. v. United States,
437 U. S. 443, 450 (1978) (deferring to the Treasury Department's `longstanding and consistent administrative
interpretation' of the countervailing duty provision of
the Tariff Act." United States v. Haggar Apparel Co.,
526 U. S. 380, 393 (1999).

And here, as in NationsBank, the agency interpretation in
question is officially that of the agency head. Consequently,
even on the Court's own terms, the Customs ruling at issue
in this case should be given Chevron deference.

IDAHO v. UNITED STATES et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 00-189. Argued April 23, 2001--Decided June 18, 2001
This suit involves a dispute between the United States and Idaho over

the ownership of submerged lands underlying portions of Lake Coeur
d'Alene and the St. Joe River. The Coeur d'Alene Tribe once inhabited
vast acreage in and about what is now Idaho, and traditionally used
Lake Coeur d'Alene and the St. Joe River for food, fiber, transportation,
recreation, and cultural activities. In 1873, the Tribe agreed to relinquish for compensation all claims to its aboriginal lands outside
the bounds of a specified reservation that included part of the river
and virtually all of the lake. The agreement required congressional
approval, but President Grant set the land aside in an 1873 Executive Order, which set the reservation's northern boundary directly
across the lake. An 1883 Government survey indicated that the reservation included submerged lands. When Congress neither ratified
the agreement nor compensated the Tribe, the Tribe petitioned the
Government to make a proper treaty and Congress authorized negotiations. In 1887, the Tribe agreed to cede its rights to all land except
that within the Executive Order reservation, and the Government
promised to compensate the Tribe and agreed to hold the land forever
as Indian land. Still, Congress did not ratify the agreement. In 1888,
the Interior Secretary responded to a Senate enquiry about the reservation's boundaries, reporting that the reservation appeared to embrace
all but a small fragment of the lake's navigable waters and that the
St. Joe River flowed through the reservation. Also in 1888, Congress
approved a railroad right-of-way that crossed the reservation's navigable waters, but directed that the Tribe's consent be obtained and
that the Tribe be compensated. Responding to a growing desire to
obtain for the public an interest in portions of the reservation, Congress authorized negotiations that produced a new agreement in 1889,
in which the Tribe agreed to cede the reservation's northern portion,
including two-thirds of the lake, for compensation. In 1890, the Senate
passed a bill ratifying the 1887 and 1889 agreements, but while the bill
was pending in the House, Congress passed the Idaho Statehood Act,
admitting Idaho to the Union. In 1891, Congress ratified the 1887 and
1889 agreements. The United States initiated this action against Idaho
to quiet title in the United States, in trust for the Tribe, to the sub533US1 Unit: $U77 [10-19-02 13:19:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Syllabus
merged lands within the current reservation. The Tribe intervened to
assert its interest in those lands, and Idaho counterclaimed to quiet
title in its favor. The District Court quieted title in the United States
as trustee, and the Tribe as beneficiary, to the bed and banks of the lake
and the river within the reservation. The Ninth Circuit affirmed.

Held: The National Government holds title, in trust for the Tribe, to

lands underlying portions of Lake Coeur d'Alene and the St. Joe River.
Pp. 272-281.

(a) Armed with the strong presumption against defeat of a State's
title to land under navigable waters, United States v. Alaska, 521 U. S.
1, 34, the Court looks to Congress's declarations and intent when resolving conflicts over submerged lands claimed to be reserved or conveyed by the United States before statehood, e. g., id., at 36. The twostep enquiry used in reservation cases asks whether Congress intended
to include submerged lands within the federal reservation, and, if so,
whether Congress intended to defeat the future State's title to those
lands. Ibid. Where, as here, the Executive Branch initially reserved
the land, the two-step test is satisfied when an Executive reservation
clearly includes submerged lands, and Congress recognizes that reservation in a way that demonstrates its intent to defeat state title.
Id., at 41-46, 55-61. Here, Idaho has conceded that the Executive
Branch intended, or interpreted, the 1873 Executive Order reservation
to include submerged lands. Pp. 272-274.

(b) Congress recognized the full extent of the Executive Order reservation and it intended to bar passage to Idaho of title to the submerged
lands at issue. Idaho's concession, in the Ninth Circuit, that the Executive Order reservation included submerged lands and that Congress
was on notice regarding the scope of the reservation was prudent in
light of the District Court's findings of facts. That court concluded that
the submerged lands and related water rights had been continuously
important to the Tribe throughout the period prior to congressional
action confirming the reservation and granting Idaho statehood, and
that the Federal Government could only achieve its goals of promoting
settlement in the Tribe's aboriginal area, avoiding hostilities with the
Tribe, and extinguishing aboriginal title by agreeing to a reservation
that included the submerged lands. That is the background of the 1873
Executive Order's inclusion of such lands, which in turn were the subject of the Senate's 1888 request to the Interior Secretary, whose response was consistent with the 1883 survey results. The manner in
which Congress then proceeded to deal with the Tribe shows clearly
that preservation of the reservation's land, absent contrary agreement
with the Tribe, was central to Congress's complementary objectives

of dealing with pressures of white settlement and establishing the reservation by permanent legislation. Congress made it expressly plain
that its object was to obtain tribal interests only by tribal consent.
When it sought to extinguish aboriginal title to lands outside the 1873
reservation and to reduce the reservation's size, it did so by authorizing negotiations with the Tribe to cede title for compensation. It also
honored the reservation's boundaries by requiring that the Tribe be
compensated for the railroad right-of-way. The intent was that anything not consensually ceded by the Tribe would remain for the Tribe's
benefit, an objective flatly at odds with Idaho's view that Congress
meant to transfer the balance of submerged lands to the State in what
would have amounted to an act of bad faith accomplished by unspoken
operation of law. Idaho's position is also at odds with later manifestations of congressional understanding that statehood had not affected the
submerged lands. Pp. 275-281.

The United States brought this quiet title action againstthe State of Idaho. The question is whether the National

Opinion of the Court
apparently unaware of this action until at least 1871, whenit petitioned the Government to set aside a reservation,

id., at 1102-1103. The Tribe found the 1867 boundaries un-satisfactory, due in part to their failure to make adequate
provision for fishing and other uses of important waterways.When the Tribe petitioned the Commissioner of Indian Affairs a second time, it insisted on a reservation that includedkey river valleys because "we are not as yet quite up to
living on farming" and "for a while yet we need have somehunting and fishing." App. 27.

Following further negotiations, the Tribe in 1873 agreedto relinquish (for compensation) all claims to its aboriginal
lands outside the bounds of a more substantial reservationthat negotiators for the United States agreed to "set apart
and secure" "for the exclusive use of the Coeur d'Alene In-dians, and to protect . . . from settlement or occupancy by
other persons." Id., at 33. The reservation boundariesdescribed in the agreement covered part of the St. Joe River
(then called the St. Joseph), and all of Lake Coeur d'Aleneexcept a sliver cut off by the northern boundary. Id., at
33-34; 95 F. Supp. 2d, at 1095-1096.Although by its own terms the agreement was not binding without congressional approval, App. 36-37, later in1873 President Grant issued an Executive Order directing
that the reservation specified in the agreement be "with-drawn from sale and set apart as a reservation for the Cur
d'Ale` ne Indians." Exec. Order of Nov. 8, 1873, reprinted in1 C. Kapler, Indian Affairs: Laws and Treaties 837 (1904).
The 1873 Executive Order set the northern boundary of thereservation directly across Lake Coeur d'Alene, which, the
District Court found, was contrary "to the usual practice ofmeandering a survey line along the mean high water mark."

Opinion of the Court
An 1883 Government survey fixed the reservation's totalarea at 598,499.85 acres, which the District Court found necessarily "included submerged lands within the reservationboundaries." 95 F. Supp. 2d, at 1108.

As of 1885, Congress had neither ratified the 1873 agree-ment nor compensated the Tribe. This inaction prompted
the Tribe to petition the Government again, to "make withus a proper treaty of peace and friendship . . . by which
your petitioners may be properly and fully compensatedfor such portion of their lands not now reserved to them;
[and] that their present reserve may be confirmed to them."App. 350-351. In response, Congress authorized new negotiations to obtain the Tribe's agreement to cede land outsidethe borders of the 1873 reservation. Act of May 15, 1886,
ch. 333, 24 Stat. 44. In 1887, the Tribe agreed to cede

"all right, title, and claim which they now have, or everhad, to all lands in said Territories [Washington, Idaho,

and Montana] and elsewhere, except the portion of landwithin the boundaries of their present reservation in
the Territory of Idaho, known as the Coeur d'Alene Res-ervation." App. 378.

The Government, in return, promised to compensate theTribe, and agreed that

"[i]n consideration of the foregoing cession and agree-ments . . . the Coeur d'Alene Reservation shall be held
forever as Indian land and as homes for the Coeurd'Alene Indians . . . and no part of said reservation
shall ever be sold, occupied, open to white settlement,
Petitioner 9. Ultimately, this factual dispute is of little consequence;
the District Court found that the boundary and acreage calculations
showed the understanding of the Government and the Tribe that submerged lands were included, 95 F. Supp. 2d, at 1108, and the State conceded on appeal that "[c]ertainly, . . . by 1888, the executive branch had
construed the 1873 Coeur d'Alene Reservation as including submerged
lands." Opening Brief for Appellant in No. 98-35831 (CA9), p. 17.

As before, the agreement was not binding on either partyuntil ratified by Congress. Id., at 382.

In January 1888, not having as yet ratified any agree-ment with the Tribe, the Senate expressed uncertainty about
the extent of the Tribe's reservation and adopted a resolu-tion directing the Secretary of the Interior to "inform the
Senate as to the extent of the present area and boundariesof the Coeur d'Alene Indian Reservation in the Territory of
Idaho," and specifically, "whether such area includes anyportion, and if so, about how much of the navigable waters
of Lake Coeur d'Alene, and of Coeur d'Alene and St. JosephRivers." S. Misc. Doc. No. 36, 50th Cong., 1st Sess., 1 (1888).
The Secretary responded in February 1888 with a report ofthe Commissioner of Indian Affairs, stating that "the reservation appears to embrace all the navigable waters of LakeCoeur d'Alene, except a very small fragment cut off by the
north boundary of the reservation," and that "[t]he St. Jo-seph River also flows through the reservation." S. Exec.
Doc. No. 76, 50th Cong., 1st Sess., 3 (1888). Based largely,it appears, on this report, Idaho conceded in the Court
of Appeals (as it does here) that the 1873 Executive Orderreservation included submerged lands. See Opening Brief
for Appellant in No. 98-35831 (CA9), p. 17 ("Certainly, theState concedes that by 1888, the executive branch had construed the 1873 Coeur d'Alene Reservation as includingsubmerged lands"); Brief for Petitioner 17.

In May 1888, shortly after receiving the Secretary's re-port, Congress passed an Act granting a right-of-way to the
Washington and Idaho Railroad Company "for the extensionof its railroad through the lands in Idaho Territory set apart
for the use of the Coeur d'Alene Indians by executive order,commonly known as the Coeur d'Alene Indian Reservation."
Act of May 30, 1888, ch. 336, $ 1, 25 Stat. 160. Notably, theAct directed that the Tribe's consent be obtained and that

the Tribe alone (no one else being mentioned) be compen-sated for the right-of-way, a part of which crossed over navigable waters within the reservation. Id., $ 3, 25 Stat. 161;see also Reply Brief for Petitioner 16.

Congress was not prepared to ratify the 1887 agreement,however, owing to a growing desire to obtain for the public
not only any interest of the Tribe in land outside the 1873
reservation, but certain portions of the reservation itself.The House Committee on Indian Affairs later recalled that

the 1887 agreement was not promptly ratified for

"sundry reasons, among which was a desire on the partof the United States to acquire an additional area, to

wit, a certain valuable portion of the reservation specially dedicated to the exclusive use of said Indiansunder an Executive order of 1873, and which portions

of said lands, situate[d] on the northern end of saidreservation, is valuable and necessary to the citizens
of the United States for sundry reasons. It containsnumerous, extensive, and valuable mineral ledges. It
contains large bodies of valuable timber. . . . It con-tains a magnificent sheet of water, the Coeur d'Alene
Lake . . . ." H. R. Rep. No. 1109, 51st Cong., 1st Sess.,4 (1890).

But Congress did not simply alter the 1873 boundariesunilaterally. Instead, the Tribe was understood to be entitled beneficially to the reservation as then defined, and the1889 Indian Appropriations Act included a provision directing the Secretary of the Interior "to negotiate with theCoeur d'Alene tribe of Indians," and, specifically, to negotiate "for the purchase and release by said tribe of such
portions of its reservation not agricultural and valuable
chiefly for minerals and timber as such tribe shall consent
to sell." Act of Mar. 2, 1889, ch. 412, $ 4, 25 Stat. 1002.
Later that year, the Tribe and Government negotiators
reached a new agreement under which the Tribe would cede

the northern portion of the reservation, including approxi-mately two-thirds of Lake Coeur d'Alene, in exchange for

$500,000. App. 198; see also 95 F. Supp. 2d, at 1113. Thenew boundary line, like the old one, ran across the lake,
and General Simpson, a negotiator for the United States, re-assured the Tribe that "you still have the St. Joseph River
and the lower part of the lake." App. 183. And, again,
the agreement was not to be binding on either party untilboth it and the 1887 agreement were ratified by Congress.

Id., at 199.On June 7, 1890, the Senate passed a bill ratifying both
the 1887 and 1889 agreements. S. 2828, 51st Cong., 1st Sess.(1890); 21 Cong. Rec. 5769-5770 (1890). On June 10, the
Senate bill was referred to the House, where a parallel billhad already been reported by the House Committee on Indian Affairs. H. R. Rep. No. 1109, 51st Cong., 1st Sess.(1890); see 21 Cong. Rec. 2775 (1890).

On July 3, 1890, while the Senate bill was under consid-eration by the House Committee on Indian Affairs, Congress passed the Idaho Statehood Act, admitting Idaho into
the Union "on an equal footing with the original States,"Act of July 3, 1890, ch. 656, 26 Stat. 215. The Statehood Act

"accepted, ratified, and confirmed" the Idaho Constitution,
ibid., which "forever disclaim[ed] all right and title to . . . all
lands lying within [Idaho] owned or held by any Indians or
Indian tribes" and provided that "until the title thereto shall
have been extinguished by the United States, the same shall
be subject to the disposition of the United States, and said
Indian lands shall remain under the absolute jurisdiction and
control of the congress of the United States," Idaho Const.,
Art. XXI, $ 19 (1890).

A little over a month later, on August 19, 1890, the House
Committee on Indian Affairs reported that the Senate bill
ratifying the 1887 and 1889 agreements was identical to
the House bill that it had already recommended. H. R. Rep.

and 1889 agreements with the Tribe. Act of Mar. 3, 1891,ch. 543, $$ 19, 20, 26 Stat. 1027, 1029. The Act also directed

the Secretary of the Interior to convey to one Frederick Posta "portion of [the] reservation," id., at 1031, that the Tribe
had purported to sell to Post in 1871.3 The property, locatedon the Spokane River and known as Post Falls, was described as "all three of the river channels and islands, withenough land on the north and south shores for water-power
and improvements." Ibid.In 1894, Congress approved yet another agreement with
the Tribe, this time for the cession of a lakeside townsitecalled Harrison, within the boundary of the ratified reservation. Act of Aug. 15, 1894, ch. 290, 28 Stat. 322, agreementreprinted in App. 389; see also 95 F. Supp. 2d, at 1117. The
agreement with the Tribe described the cession as cover-ing "all the land" embraced within a tract that included a
portion of the lake. App. 392. Like the earlier railroadcession, this one was subject to compensation to the Tribe
and no one else.The United States, acting in its own capacity and as
trustee for the Tribe, initiated this action against the Stateof Idaho to quiet title (in the United States, to be held for
the use and benefit of the Tribe) to the submerged landswithin the exterior boundaries of the Tribe's current reservation, which encompass the lower third of Lake Coeurd'Alene and part of the St. Joe River.

Oneida, 414 U. S. 661, 667-668 (1974) (under common law and various
Nonintercourse Acts, Indian title can only be extinguished with federal
consent).

4 Because this action was brought by the United States, it does not

implicate the Eleventh Amendment bar raised when the Tribe pressed
its own claim to the submerged lands in Idaho v. Coeur d'Alene Tribe
of Idaho, 521 U. S. 261 (1997). See Arizona v. California, 460 U. S. 605,

The United States's complaint was apparently motivated by Idaho's
issuance of permits for the construction of "docks, piers, floats, pilings,
breakwaters, boat ramps and other such aids to navigation within the

Ibid. Following a 9-day trial, the District Court quietedtitle "in favor of the United States, as trustee, and the Coeur

Due to the public importance of navigable waterways,ownership of the land underlying such waters is "strongly

identified with the sovereign power of government." Mon-tana v. United States, 450 U. S. 544, 552 (1981). See generally Idaho v. Coeur d'Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U. S. 261,284 (1997);

United States v. Alaska, 521 U. S. 1, 5 (1997). Inorder to allow new States to enter the Union on an "equal

footing" with the original States with regard to this im-portant interest, "the United States early adopted and constantly has adhered to the policy of regarding lands undernavigable waters in acquired territory . . . as held for the
ultimate benefit of future States." United States v. HoltState Bank, 270 U. S. 49, 55 (1926); see also Shively v.
Bowlby, 152 U. S. 1, 48-50 (1894). Therefore, in contrastto the law governing surface land held by the United States,
see Scott v. Lattig, 227 U. S. 229, 244 (1913), the default ruleis that title to land under navigable waters passes from the
United States to a newly admitted State. Shively, supra,at 26-50. Specifically, although Congress has the power before statehood to convey land beneath navigable waters,and to reserve such land for the United States, " `[a] court

supra, at 552).

Armed with that presumption, we have looked to Con-gress's declarations and intent when we have had to resolve

conflicts over submerged lands claimed to have been reserved or conveyed by the United States before statehood.
Alaska, supra, at 36 ("Whether title to submerged lands
rests with a State, of course, is ultimately a matter of federalintent");

The issue of congressional intent is refined somewhat
when submerged lands are located within a tract that the
National Government has dealt with in some special way
before statehood, as by reserving lands for a particular
national purpose such as a wildlife refuge or, as here, an
Indian reservation. Because reserving submerged lands
does not necessarily imply the intent "to defeat a future
State's title to the land," Utah Div. of State Lands, supra,
at 202, we undertake a two-step enquiry in reservation cases.
We ask whether Congress intended to include land under
navigable waters within the federal reservation and, if so,
whether Congress intended to defeat the future State's title
to the submerged lands. Alaska, supra, at 36; Utah, supra,
at 202.

Our most recent case of this sort, United States v. Alaska,
supra, addressed two parcels of land initially reserved not
by Congress but, as here, by the Executive Branch. We
explained that the two-step test of congressional intent is
satisfied when an Executive reservation clearly includes
submerged lands, and Congress recognizes the reservation
in a way that demonstrates an intent to defeat state title.
Id., at 41-46, 55-61. We considered whether Congress was

Opinion of the Court
on notice that the Executive reservation included submergedlands, see id., at 42, 45, 56, and whether the purpose of the

reservation would have been compromised if the submergedlands had passed to the State, id., at 42-43, 45-46, 58.
Where the purpose would have been undermined, we ex-plained, "[i]t is simply not plausible that the United States
sought to reserve only the upland portions of the area," id.,at 39-40.

Here, Idaho has conceded that "the executive branch hadintended, or by 1888 had interpreted, the 1873 Executive
Order Reservation to include submerged lands." Brief forPetitioner 17. The concession is a sound one. A right to
control the lakebed and adjacent waters was traditionallyimportant to the Tribe, which emphasized in its petition
to the Government that it continued to depend on fishing.Cf.

Montana, supra, at 556 (finding no intent to include sub-merged lands within a reservation where the tribe did not

depend on fishing or use of navigable water). The DistrictCourt found that the acreage determination of the reserved
area in 1883 necessarily included the area of the lakebedwithin the unusual boundary line crossing the lake from east
to west. Cf. Alaska, supra, at 39 (concluding that a bound-ary following the ocean side of offshore islands necessarily
embraced submerged lands shoreward of the islands). Inlight of those findings and Idaho's concession, the parties
here concentrate on the second question, of Congress's intentto defeat Idaho's title to the submerged lands.

5

5 The District Court and Court of Appeals accepted the United States's
position that it had reserved the submerged lands, and that Congress
intended that reservation to defeat Idaho's title. They did not reach
the Tribe's alternative theory that, notwithstanding the scope of any
reservation, the Tribe retained aboriginal title to the submerged lands,
which cannot be extinguished without explicit action by Congress, see
Oneida Indian Nation, 414 U. S., at 667-668; cf. United States v. Winans,
198 U. S. 371, 381 (1905) (explaining that a treaty ceding some aboriginal
lands to the United States and setting apart other lands as a reservation "was not a grant of rights to the Indians, but a grant of rights from

Opinion of the Court
In the Court of Appeals, Idaho also conceded one pointcovered in this second part of the enquiry. It agreed that

after the Secretary of the Interior's 1888 report that the res-ervation embraced nearly "all the navigable water of Lake
Coeur d'Alene," S. Exec. Doc. No. 76, 50th Cong., 1st Sess.,at 3, Congress was on notice that the Executive Order reservation included submerged lands. Opening Brief for Appellant in No. 98-35831 (CA9), at 11 ("[Congress was] informedthat the Coeur d'Alene Reservation embraced submerged

lands"). Again, Idaho's concession was prudent in light ofthe District Court's findings of facts. 95 F. Supp. 2d, at 1114
("The evidence shows that prior to Idaho's statehood, Con-gress was on notice that the Executive Order of 1873 reserved for the benefit of the Tribe the submerged landswithin the boundaries of the Coeur d'Alene Reservation").

The District Court did not merely impute to Congressknowledge of the land survey, but also explained how the
submerged lands and related water rights had been con-tinuously important to the Tribe throughout the period
prior to congressional action confirming the reservation and
granting Idaho statehood. And the District Court made thefollowing findings about the period preceding negotiations

authorized by Congress:

"The facts demonstrate that an influx of non-Indians into
the Tribe's aboriginal territory prompted the FederalGovernment to negotiate with the Coeur d'Alenes in

an attempt to confine the Tribe to a reservation andto obtain the Tribe's release of its aboriginal lands for
settlement. Before it would agree to these conditions,however, the Tribe demanded an enlarged reservation
that included the Lake and rivers. Thus, the FederalGovernment could only achieve its goals of promoting

them--a reservation of those not granted"). The Tribe does not press its
unextinguished-aboriginal-title argument here. See Brief for Respondent
Coeur d'Alene Tribe 25, n. 12.

276 IDAHO v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
settlement, avoiding hostilities and extinguishing ab-original title by agreeing to a reservation that included

the submerged lands." Id., at 1107.6
This, in summary, was the background for the 1873 Execu-tive Order's inclusion of submerged lands, which in turn

were the subject of the 1888 request by the Senate to theSecretary of the Interior for advice about the Tribe's rights
over the "navigable waters of Lake Coeur d'Alene and theCoeur d'Alene and St. Joseph Rivers," S. Misc. Doc. No. 36,
50th Cong., 1st Sess., at 1. As noted, the Secretary an-swered in the affirmative, S. Exec. Doc. No. 76, 50th Cong.,
1st Sess., at 3, consistently with the survey indicating thatthe submerged lands were within the reservation. Thus,
the District Court remarked that it would be difficult toimagine circumstances that could have made it more plain
to Congress that submerged lands were within the reser-vation. 95 F. Supp. 2d, at 1114.

The manner in which Congress then proceeded to dealwith the Tribe shows clearly that preservation of the land
within the reservation, absent contrary agreement with theTribe, was central to Congress's complementary objectives
of dealing with pressures of white settlement and estab-lishing the reservation by permanent legislation. The Tribe
had shown its readiness to fight to preserve its land rightswhen in 1858 it defeated a force of the United States military,
which it misunderstood as intending to take aboriginal lands.See H. R. Rep. No. 1109, 51st Cong., 1st Sess., at 2-3. The
concern with hostility arose again in 1873 before the reser-vation boundaries were established, when a surveyor on the

6 See also Commissioner of Indian Affairs, Annual Report (1873), reprinted in App. 45 (explaining that Tribe was dissatisfied with a previous
reservation and that the 1873 agreement was required "[f]or the purpose of extinguishing [the Tribe's] claim to all the tract of country claimed
by them"). See generally Montana v. United States, 450 U. S. 544, 556
(1981) (creation of Indian reservation is appropriate public purpose justifying defeat of state title to submerged lands).

Opinion of the Court
scene had warned the Surveyor General that "[s]hould thefisheries be excluded there will in my opinion be trouble with

these Indians." App. 30.Hence, although the goal of extinguishing aboriginal title
could have been achieved by congressional fiat, see Tee-HitTon Indians v. United States, 348 U. S. 272, 279-282 (1955),
and Congress was free to define the reservation boundaries
however it saw fit, the goal of avoiding hostility seeminglycould not have been attained without the agreement of the

Tribe. Congress in any event made it expressly plain thatits object was to obtain tribal interests only by tribal consent. When in 1886 Congress took steps toward extinguishing aboriginal title to all lands outside the 1873 boundaries,
it did so by authorizing negotiation of agreements ceding
title for compensation. Soon after that, when Congress decided to seek a reduction in the size of the 1873 reservation itself, the Secretary of the Interior advised the Senate
against fiddling with the scope of the reservation without
the Tribe's agreement. The report of February 1888 likewise urged that any move to diminish the reservation
"should be done, if done at all, with the full and free consent
of the Indians, and they should, of course, receive proper
compensation for any land so taken." App. 129. Accordingly, after receiving the Secretary's report, Congress undertook in the 1889 Act to authorize negotiation with the Tribe
for the consensual, compensated cession of such portions of
the Tribe's reservation "as such tribe shall consent to sell,"
Act of Mar. 2, 1889, ch. 412, $ 4, 25 Stat. 1002. In the meantime it honored the reservation's recently clarified boundaries by requiring that the Tribe be compensated for the
Washington and Idaho Railroad Company right-of-way, Act
of May 30, 1888, ch. 336, $ 1, 25 Stat. 160.

The facts, including the provisions of Acts of Congress in
1886, 1888, and 1889, thus demonstrate that Congress understood its objective as turning on the Tribe's agreement
to the abrogation of any land claim it might have and to any

278 IDAHO v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
reduction of the 1873 reservation's boundaries. The explicitstatutory provisions requiring agreement of the Tribe were

unchanged right through to the point of Congress's final 1891ratification of the reservation, in an Act that of course contained no cession by the Tribe of submerged lands withinthe reservation's outer boundaries. Nor, it should be added,
is there any hint in the evidence that delay in final passage
of the ratifying Act was meant to pull a fast one by allowingthe reservation's submerged lands to pass to Idaho under a

legal presumption, by virtue of the Statehood Act approvedeight months before Congress took final action on the reservation. There is no evidence that the Act confirming thereservation was delayed for any reason but comparison of
the respective House and Senate bills, to assure that theywere identical prior to the House's passage of the Senate
version.7The record thus answers the State's argument that, because the 1889 Act indicates that Congress sought to obtain
portions of the reservation "valuable chiefly for minerals
and timber," Congress was not necessarily thinking one
thing or another about the balance of the reservation land.
Reply Brief for Petitioner 6-7; see also Tr. of Oral Arg.
12-13. The argument simply ignores the evidence that Congress did know that the reservation included submerged
lands, and that it authorized the reservation's modification
solely by agreement. The intent, in other words, was that
anything not consensually ceded by the Tribe would remain for the Tribe's benefit, an objective flatly at odds with
Idaho's view that Congress meant to transfer the balance

7 Given the preceding discussion of, among other things, the earlier
congressional Acts, it should go without saying that this reference to
the fact that the Senate passed the ratification Act before statehood is
not intended to suggest that the Senate action constituted the enactment
of an expression of intent on behalf of the whole Congress, let alone that
it was sufficient of itself to defeat Idaho's title to the submerged lands.
But cf. post, at 285 (Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting).

Opinion of the Court
of submerged lands to the State in what would haveamounted to an act of bad faith accomplished by unspoken

operation of law. Indeed, the implausibility of the State'scurrent position is underscored by the fact that it made a
contrary argument in the Court of Appeals, where it em-phasized the District Court's finding that the 1889 Act was
an authorization "to negotiate with the Tribe for a release ofthe submerged lands," and recognized that "[Congress was]
informed that the Coeur d'Alene Reservation embracedsubmerged lands." Opening Brief for Appellant in No. 98-
35831 (CA9), at 11, 31.Idaho's position is at odds not only with evidence of
congressional intent before statehood, but also with latercongressional understanding that statehood had not affected
the submerged lands in question. Eight months after pass-ing the Statehood Act, Congress ratified the 1887 and 1889
agreements in their entireties (including language in the1887 agreement that "the Coeur d'Alene Reservation shall
be held forever as Indian land"), with no signal that someof the land over which the parties to those agreements had
negotiated had passed in the interim to Idaho. The ratifi-cation Act suggested in a further way Congress's understanding that the 1873 reservation's submerged lands hadnot passed to the State, by including a provision confirming the Tribe's sale of river channels to Frederick Post.Confirmation would have been beyond Congress's power if
title to the submerged riverbed had already passed to theState.

8 Finally, the Act of Congress ceding the portion of

18. That merely suggests the possibility that Congress intended to defeat the State's title to even more territory than the United States is
claiming here.

The State also hypothesizes that the relevant portions of the Spokane
River may not have been considered navigable at the time of the conveyance, ibid., in which case the equal footing doctrine would not apply and
the conveyance would say nothing about Congress's intent with regard to

280 IDAHO v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
reservation land for the townsite of Harrison confirms Con-gress's understanding that the lakebed within the reservation's boundaries was part of the reservation. Only threeyears after the Act confirming the reservation, the townsite cession was treated just as the right-of-way for the rail-road had been treated before statehood. The Tribe (and no
one else) was compensated for a cession whose bounds sug-gested inclusion of submerged lands; the boundary lines did
not stop at the water's edge and meander the entire shore,but continued into the area of the lake to encompass submerged territory that the National Government simply couldnot have conveyed if it had passed to Idaho at the time of
statehood.9In sum, Congress undertook to negotiate with the Coeur
d'Alene Tribe for reduction in the territory of an Execu-tive Order reservation that Idaho concedes included the submerged lands at issue here. Congress was aware that thesubmerged lands were included and clearly intended to redefine the area of the reservation that covered them onlyby consensual transfer, in exchange for the guarantee that
the Tribe would retain the remainder. There is no indicasubmerged lands underlying navigable waters. We need not resolve this
factual question, which was not addressed below. Suffice it to say that
Congress's actions in 1891 were consistent with an understanding that
the State did not have title to the riverbeds conveyed to Post, which,
along with the later Harrison cession of part of the concededly navigable lake, is consistent with an understanding that no submerged lands
within the reservation's stated boundaries had passed to Idaho.

9 Here, we agree with the dissent, post, at 284, that Congress cannot,

after statehood, reserve or convey submerged lands that "ha[ve] already
been bestowed" upon a State. See Shively v. Bowlby, 152 U. S. 1, 26-28
(1894) (citing Lessee of Pollard v. Hagan, 3 How. 212 (1845)). Our point
in mentioning Congress's actions after statehood is merely to confirm
what Congress's prestatehood actions already make clear: that the lands
at issue here were not bestowed upon Idaho at statehood, because Congress intended that they remain tribal reservation lands barring agreement to the contrary.

tion that Congress ever modified its objective of negotiatedconsensual transfer, which would have been defeated if Congress had let parts of the reservation pass to the State beforethe agreements with the Tribe were final. Any imputation
to Congress either of bad faith or of secrecy in dropping itsexpress objective of consensual dealing with the Tribe is
at odds with the evidence. We therefore think the nego-tiating history, not to mention subsequent events, "ma[k]e

the submerged lands at issue here.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.

It is so ordered.
Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice Scalia,
Justice Kennedy, and Justice Thomas join, dissenting.

The Court makes out a plausible case for the propositionthat, on the day Idaho was admitted to the Union, the Executive Branch of the Federal Government had intended toretain in trust for the Coeur d'Alene Indian Tribe the submerged lands under a portion of Lake Coeur d'Alene. But
the existence of such intent on the part of the ExecutiveBranch is simply not enough to defeat an incoming State's

title to submerged lands within its borders. Decisions ofthis Court going back more than 150 years establish this
proposition beyond a shadow of a doubt."[T]he ownership of land under navigable waters," it
bears repeating, "is an incident of sovereignty." Montanav.

United States, 450 U. S. 544, 551 (1981). Recognizing this
important relationship, this Court "announced the principlethat the United States held the lands under navigable waters

be created." Utah Div. of State Lands v. United States, 482
U. S. 193, 196 (1987) (quoting Lessee of Pollard v. Hagan,
3 How. 212, 230 (1845)). That duty may not lightly be disregarded, and, as the Court rightly observes, our inquiry
"begin[s] with a strong presumption against defeat of a
State's title." Ante, at 273 (internal quotation marks and
citations omitted). Accordingly, "disposals [of submerged
lands] by the United States during the territorial period . . .
should not be regarded as intended unless the intention was
definitely declared or otherwise made very plain." United
States v. Holt State Bank, 270 U. S. 49, 55 (1926); see also
Montana, supra, at 552 ("[The Court] must not infer such
a conveyance unless the intention was definitely declared
or otherwise made very plain, or was rendered in clear and
especial words, or unless the claim confirmed in terms embraces the land under the waters of the stream" (internal
quotation marks and citations omitted)).

The Court makes three critical mistakes in its application
of the equal footing doctrine here--errors that significantly
dilute the doctrine. First and foremost, the Court misconceives the scope of historical events directly relevant to the
question whether Congress had, by July 3, 1890, acted to
withhold title to submerged lands from the entering State
of Idaho. At the very moment that Idaho entered the Union
"on an equal footing with the original States," Act of July 3,
1890, ch. 656, 26 Stat. 215, Congress and the President vested
in Idaho the accoutrements of sovereignty, including title
to submerged lands. It is therefore improper for the Court
to look to events after Idaho's admission in order to discern
whether Congress had months or years previously intended
to divest the entering State of its submerged lands. Indeed,
I am aware of no case applying the equal footing doctrine
to determine title to submerged lands in which this Court
has looked beyond the moment of statehood for evidence of
federal intent.

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
Our decision in United States v. Alaska, 521 U. S. 1 (1997),
is particularly illustrative of the timeframe relevant to our
inquiry. That case concerned in part Alaska's assumption
of title to submerged lands within the National Petroleum
Reserve-Alaska (Reserve) and the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge (Refuge). See id., at 4. In stark contrast to today's
decision, the Court in its lengthy discussion in Alaska resisted entirely the temptation to delve into the treatment
of the lands in question in the months and years following
Alaska's admission to the Union in 1959. And the invitation to do so hardly could have been more obvious with
respect to the Refuge, which had been "set apart" as a wildlife reservation but had not yet been formally approved by
the Secretary of the Interior. Id., at 46-47. "This application," the Court observed, "was still pending in July 1958,
when Congress passed the Alaska Statehood Act, and in
January 1959, when Alaska was formally admitted to the
Union." Id., at 46. Although the Court noted that the
application was approved several months after Alaska's
admission, the Court considered the pending application as
relevant only insofar as it put Congress on notice of the
action. See id., at 56. The Alaska Court did not give--
contrary to the Court's reasoning in the present case--any
import to the fact that the application ultimately was approved. Indeed, Alaska's focus on the instant of statehood
as the crucial moment of inquiry could hardly be more clear.
See, e. g., id., at 42 ("The conclusion that Congress was aware
when it passed the Alaska Statehood Act that the Reserve
encompassed submerged lands is reinforced by other legislation, enacted just before Alaska's admission to the Union,
granting certain offshore lands to the Territory of Alaska");
id., at 55 ("We now consider whether, prior to Alaska's admission to the Union, the United States defeated the future
State's title to the submerged lands included within the
proposed Range" (emphases added)). Other cases indicate

Accordingly, insofar as the submerged lands at issue hereare concerned, it is of no moment that Congress ultimately

ratified the 1887 and 1889 negotiations. See ante, at 279.Well before it took such action, Congress had given its assent
to Idaho's entry into the Union as a sovereign State andthereby joined with the Executive to extinguish the Federal
Government's right to withhold title to submerged lands.It follows that Congress' acceptance of the fact that "the
Coeur d'Alene Reservation shall be held forever as Indian
land," ibid., does nothing to explain whether submergedlands were within that reservation at the time of--much less

eight months after--Idaho's admission. By the same token,our inquiry is not illuminated by Congress' attempt in 1891
to affirm Chief Seltice's purported conveyance of certainlands to Frederick Post, see

ante, at 271, 279, or by Congress' approval in 1894 of the so-called "Harrison cession,"see

ante, at 279-280. Simply put, the consequences of admission are instantaneous, and it ignores the uniquely sovereign character of that event for the Court to suggest thatsubsequent events somehow can diminish what has already

been bestowed.Second, all agree (at least in theory) that the question before us is "whether Congress intended to include land undernavigable waters within the federal reservation and, if so,
whether Congress intended to defeat the future State's titleto the submerged lands,"

ante, at 273 (emphasis added).
But the Court proceeds to determine this "intent" by consid-ering what obviously are

not Acts of Congress. Congress

1 The Court of Appeals stated that "we are aware of no rule forbidding
consideration of such [post-statehood] events. Indeed, the case law may
suggest the contrary. See Alaska Pacific Fisheries v. United States,
248 U. S. 78, 89-90 (1918)." 210 F. 3d 1067, 1079, n. 17 (CA9 2000). This
citation is puzzling indeed, for Alaska was not admitted to the Union until
some 40 years after the Court's decision in Alaska Pacific Fisheries.

itself did authorize negotiations with the Tribe in 1886 and1889, but those Acts expressly provided that any resulting

agreements were not binding "until ratified by Congress."Act of May 15, 1886, 24 Stat. 44, App. 51; Act of Mar. 2, 1889,
25 Stat. 1002, App. 144. And it is undisputed that ratifi-cation did not occur before Idaho gained admission. The
Court, however, is willing to divine congressional intentto withhold submerged lands from the State from what
are best described as inchoate prestatehood proceedings.In the Court's view it is sufficient that one House of Congress had acted to approve the agreements and that theother was in the process of considering similar legislation.
See ante, at 278. The Court thus speaks of the "final" rati-fication of the 1887 and 1889 negotiations as if the official
approval of both Houses of Congress was but a mere formal-ity.

Ibid. But see U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 7, cl. 2. But theindisputable fact remains that, as of July 3, 1890, "Congress"

had passed the Idaho Statehood Act but had not ratified the1887 and 1889 agreements.

Nor do our prior decisions in this area support the Court'sdecision to wander so far afield. In

Alaska, we evaluatedthe impact of an express provision in the Alaska Statehood

Act, Pub. L. 85-508, 72 Stat. 347, reserving certain lands forthe United States. 521 U. S., at 41-42. There the evidence
that "Congress expressed a clear intent to defeat state title"to submerged lands came in the form of a duly passed federal statute rather than as inferences drawn from preludesto future congressional Acts. Id., at 41. Indeed, that
Statehood Act abounds in specificity, in $ 11(b) directly iden-tifying the Reserve, and in $ 6(e) defining other reserved
lands in some detail.2 So, too, in Utah Division of State

and title to . . . all lands . . . owned or held by any Indians or Indian
tribes" were boilerplate formulations at the time, and the inclusion of

Lands we evaluated prestatehood federal statutes without
reference to inchoate proceedings lacking the force of law.
482 U. S., at 198-200 (discussing the impact on Utah's claim
to certain submerged lands of the Sundry Appropriations
Act of 1888, 25 Stat. 505, and the Sundry Appropriations Act
of 1890, ch. 837, 26 Stat. 371). Cf. Montana, supra, at 550-
555 (considering whether certain treaties vested property
rights in the Crow Indians). We thus wisely have not relied
on this sort of evidence in the past, and it is unfortunate that
we embark upon that route today.

Third, despite the critical relationship between submerged
lands and sovereignty, the Court makes the unwarranted
assumption that any use granted with respect to navigable
waters must necessarily include reserving title to the submerged lands below them. As the Court previously has explained, the purpose underlying a reservation of territorial
lands is often probative of federal intent. See, e. g., Alaska,
521 U. S., at 39. Even accepting the District Court's conclusions regarding the Tribe's dietary habits, and further
accepting this Court's inference that Congress was concerned with the Tribe's access to navigable waters,3 it does

this language hardly compares to the precision employed in the Alaska
Statehood Act. Indeed, every State admitted between the years 1889 and
1912 entered with such a disclaimer. See N. D. Const., Art. 16, $ 2 (1889);
S. D. Const., Art. XXII, $ 18 (1889); Mont. Const., Ordinance I (1889);
Wash. Const., Art. XXVI, $ 2 (1889); Wyo. Const., Ordinance $ 3 (1889);
Utah Const., Art. III (1894); Okla. Const., Art. I, $ 3 (1906); N. M. Const.,
Art. XXI, $ 2 (1910); Ariz. Const., Art. XX, par. 4 (1910). Tellingly, in
each of these Constitutions save Oklahoma's, the relevant language is
identical to that in the Idaho Constitution. This disclaimer, in any event,
simply begs the question whether submerged lands were in fact "owned
or held" by the Coeur d'Alene Tribe upon Idaho's admission.

3 This inference may not be justified. Although Idaho apparently has

conceded that the 1873 Executive Order included submerged lands within
the reservation, that fact hardly confirms that Congress made a similar
statement in simply authorizing negotiations with the Tribe. United
States v. Alaska, 521 U. S. 1 (1997), moreover, indicates that it is at best

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
not necessarily follow that Congress intended to reservetitle in submerged lands by authorizing negotiations leading to the cession of portions of the reservation establishedby the 1873 Executive Order.

It is perfectly consistent with the assumption that Con-gress wanted to preserve the Coeur d'Alene Indians' way
of life to conclude that, if Congress meant to grant theTribe any interest in Lake Coeur d'Alene, it was more likely
a right to fish and travel the waters rather than withhold-ing for the Tribe's benefit perpetual title in the underlying
lands. See Montana, 450 U. S., at 554 ([Although the treaty]
gave the Crow Indians the sole right to use and occupy thereserved land, and, implicitly, the power to exclude others

from it, the respondents' reliance on that provision simplybegs the question of the precise extent of the conveyed lands
to which this exclusivity attaches"); see also ibid. ("The merefact that the bed of a navigable water lies within the boundaries described in the treaty does not make the riverbedpart of the conveyed land, especially when there is no express reference to the riverbed that might overcome the
presumption against its conveyance").For this reason, Congress' decision in 1888 to grant a

right-of-way to the Washington and Idaho Railroad Com-pany across a part of the Coeur d'Alene Reservation is not
clear evidence of Congress' intent with respect to sub-merged lands. All but a miniscule portion of the rightof-way passes along surface lands, and it crosses the lakeonly at one of its narrowest points. There is no mention
of submerged lands in the authorizing resolution, and itseems obvious that Congress required the company to pay

an open question whether Executive action alone is sufficient to withhold
title to submerged lands. Id., at 43-45; cf. U. S. Const., Art. IV, $ 3, cl. 2
("The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules
and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging
to the United States" (emphasis added)). Thus, the majority rests far too
much weight on Idaho's concession regarding the 1873 reservation.

compensation to the Tribe because of the significant impactthe railroad would have upon surface lands:

"[T]he right of way hereby granted to said companyshall be seventy-five feet in width on each side of

the central line of said railroad as aforesaid[;] and saidcompany shall also have the right to take from said
lands adjacent to the line of said road material, stone,earth, and timber necessary for the construction of said
railroad; also, ground adjacent to such right of wayfor station-buildings, depots, machine-shops, side-tracks,
turnouts, and water-stations, not to exceed in amountthree hundred feet in width and three thousand feet in
length for each station, to the extent one station for eachten miles of road." App. 138.

Thus, I do not think it just to infer any intent regardingsubmerged lands from Congress' requirement of compensation for what was to be primarily an intrusion--and asignificant one at that--upon surface lands.

In sum, the evidence of congressional intent properlybefore the Court today fails to rise to anywhere near the
level of certainty our cases require. Congress' desire todivest an entering State of its sovereign interest in submerged lands must be "definitely declared or otherwise madevery plain,"

Montana, supra, at 552. That standard hasnot been met here.

IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION SERVICE

v. ST. CYR

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe second circuit

No. 00-767. Argued April 24, 2001--Decided June 25, 2001
Before the effective dates of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death

Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) and the Illegal Immigration Reform and
Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), $ 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 was interpreted to give the Attorney General broad discretion to waive deportation of resident aliens.
As relevant here, the large class of aliens depending on $ 212(c) relief
was reduced in 1996 by $ 401 of AEDPA, which identified a broad set
of offenses for which convictions would preclude such relief; and by
IIRIRA, which repealed $ 212(c) and replaced it with a new section
excluding from the class anyone "convicted of an aggravated felony,"
8 U. S. C. $ 1229b(a)(3). Respondent St. Cyr, a lawful permanent United
States resident, pleaded guilty to a criminal charge that made him
deportable. He would have been eligible for a waiver of deportation
under the immigration law in effect when he was convicted, but his
removal proceedings were commenced after AEDPA's and IIRIRA's
effective dates. The Attorney General claims that those Acts withdrew
his authority to grant St. Cyr a waiver. The Federal District Court
accepted St. Cyr's habeas corpus application and agreed that the new
restrictions do not apply to removal proceedings brought against an
alien who pleaded guilty to a deportable crime before their enactment.
The Second Circuit affirmed.

Held:

1. Courts have jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C. $ 2241 to decide the legal
issue raised by St. Cyr's habeas petition. Pp. 298-314.

(a) To prevail on its claim that AEDPA and IIRIRA stripped federal courts of jurisdiction to decide a pure question of law, as in this
case, petitioner Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) must
overcome both the strong presumption in favor of judicial review of
administrative action and the longstanding rule requiring a clear and
unambiguous statement of congressional intent to repeal habeas jurisdiction. Here, that plain statement rule draws additional reinforcement from other canons of statutory construction: First, when a statutory interpretation invokes the outer limits of Congress' power, there
must be a clear indication that Congress intended that result; and

533US2 Unit: $U78 [11-05-02 18:53:21] PAGES PGT: OPLG
290 INS v. ST. CYR

Syllabus
second, if an otherwise acceptable construction would raise serious constitutional problems and an alternative interpretation is fairly possible,
the statute must be construed to avoid such problems. Pp. 298-300.

(b) Construing the amendments at issue to preclude court review
of a pure question of law would give rise to substantial constitutional
questions. The Constitution's Suspension Clause, which protects the
privilege of the habeas corpus writ, unquestionably requires some judicial intervention in deportation cases. Heikkila v. Barber, 345 U. S.
229, 235. Even assuming that the Clause protects only the writ as it
existed in 1789, substantial evidence supports St. Cyr's claim that pure
questions of law could have been answered in 1789 by a common-law
judge with power to issue the writ. Thus, a serious Suspension Clause
issue would arise if the 1996 statutes have withdrawn that power from
federal judges and provided no adequate substitute. The need to resolve such a serious and difficult constitutional question and the desirability of avoiding that necessity reinforce the reasons for requiring a
clear and unambiguous statement of congressional intent. Pp. 300-305.

(c) To conclude that the writ is no longer available in this context
would also represent a marked departure from historical immigration
law practice. The writ has always been available to review the legality
of Executive detention, see, e. g., Felker v. Turpin, 518 U. S. 651, 663,
and, until the 1952 Act, a habeas action was the sole means of challenging a deportation order's legality, see, e. g., Heikkila, 345 U. S., at 235.
Habeas courts have answered questions of law in alien suits challenging
Executive interpretations of immigration law and questions of law that
arose in the discretionary relief context. Pp. 305-308.

(d) Neither AEDPA $ 401(e) nor three IIRIRA provisions, 8 U. S. C.

$$ 1252(a)(1), (a)(2)(C), and (b)(9), express a clear and unambiguous statement of Congress' intent to bar 28 U. S. C. $ 2241 petitions. None of
these sections even mentions $ 2241. Section 401(e)'s repeal of a subsection of the 1961 Act, which provided, inter alia, habeas relief for
an alien in custody pursuant to a deportation order, is not sufficient
to eliminate what the repealed section did not grant--namely, habeas
jurisdiction pursuant to $ 2241. See Ex parte Yerger, 8 Wall. 85, 105-
106. The three IIRIRA provisions do not speak with sufficient clarity
to bar habeas jurisdiction. They focus on "judicial review" or "jurisdiction to review." In the immigration context, however, "judicial
review" and "habeas corpus" have historically distinct meanings, with
habeas courts playing a far narrower role. Pp. 308-314.

2. Section 212(c) relief remains available for aliens, like St. Cyr, whose
convictions were obtained through plea agreements and who, notwithstanding those convictions, would have been eligible for $ 212(c) relief at
the time of their plea under the law then in effect. Pp. 314-326.

(a) A statute's language must require that it be applied retroactively. Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hospital, 488 U. S. 204, 208. The
first step in the impermissible-retroactive-effect determination is to
ascertain whether Congress has directed with the requisite clarity that
the law be applied retrospectively. Martin v. Hadix, 527 U. S. 343, 352.
Such clarity is not shown by the comprehensiveness of IIRIRA's revision of federal immigration law, see Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244, 260-261, by the promulgation of IIRIRA's effective date, see id., at 257, or by IIRIRA $ 309(c)(1)'s "saving provision."
Pp. 314-320.

(b) The second step is to determine whether IIRIRA attaches
new legal consequences to events completed before its enactment, a
judgment informed and guided by considerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and settled expectations. Landgraf, 511 U. S., at 270.
IIRIRA's elimination of $ 212(c) relief for people who entered into
plea agreements expecting that they would be eligible for such relief
clearly attaches a new disability to past transactions or considerations.
Plea agreements involve a quid pro quo between a criminal defendant and the government, and there is little doubt that alien defendants
considering whether to enter into such agreements are acutely aware
of their convictions' immigration consequences. The potential for unfairness to people like St. Cyr is significant and manifest. Now that
prosecutors have received the benefit of plea agreements, facilitated
by the aliens' belief in their continued eligibility for $ 212(c) relief, it
would be contrary to considerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance,
and settled expectations to hold that IIRIRA deprives them of any
possibility of such relief. The INS' argument that application of deportation law can never have retroactive effect because deportation
proceedings are inherently prospective is not particularly helpful in
undertaking Landgraf's analysis, and the fact that deportation is
not punishment for past crimes does not mean that the Court cannot
consider an alien's reasonable reliance on the continued availability
of discretionary relief from deportation when deciding the retroactive
effect of eliminating such relief. That $ 212(c) relief is discretionary
does not affect the propriety of this Court's conclusion, for there is a
clear difference between facing possible deportation and facing certain
deportation. Pp. 320-326.

their enactment and on the availability of discretionary relieffrom deportation.

Respondent, Enrico St. Cyr, is a citizen of Haiti whowas admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent
resident in 1986. Ten years later, on March 8, 1996, hepleaded guilty in a state court to a charge of selling a controlled substance in violation of Connecticut law. That con-viction made him deportable. Under pre-AEDPA law applicable at the time of his conviction, St. Cyr would have beeneligible for a waiver of deportation at the discretion of the
Attorney General. However, removal proceedings againsthim were not commenced until April 10, 1997, after both
AEDPA and IIRIRA became effective, and, as the AttorneyGeneral interprets those statutes, he no longer has discretion
to grant such a waiver.In his habeas corpus petition, respondent has alleged that
the restrictions on discretionary relief from deportation con-tained in the 1996 statutes do not apply to removal proceedings brought against an alien who pleaded guilty to a de-portable crime before their enactment. The District Court
accepted jurisdiction of his application and agreed with hissubmission. In accord with the decisions of four other Circuits, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed.1229 F. 3d 406 (2000). The importance of both questions warranted our grant of certiorari. 531 U. S. 1107 (2001).

Subject to certain exceptions, $ 3 of the Immigration Act
of 1917 excluded from admission to the United States several
classes of aliens, including, for example, those who had committed crimes "involving moral turpitude." 39 Stat. 875.
The seventh exception provided "[t]hat aliens returning after
a temporary absence to an unrelinquished United States
domicile of seven consecutive years may be admitted in the
discretion of the Secretary of Labor, and under such conditions as he may prescribe." Id., at 878.2 Although that
provision applied literally only to exclusion proceedings, and
although the deportation provisions of the statute did not
contain a similar provision, the INS relied on $ 3 to grant
relief in deportation proceedings involving aliens who had
departed and returned to this country after the ground for
deportation arose. See, e. g., Matter of L, 1 I. & N. Dec. 1,
2 (1940).3

Section 212 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of
1952, which replaced and roughly paralleled $ 3 of the 1917
Act, excluded from the United States several classes of
aliens, including those convicted of offenses involving moral
turpitude or the illicit traffic in narcotics. See 66 Stat. 182-
187. As with the prior law, this section was subject to a
proviso granting the Attorney General broad discretion to

See Matter of L, 1 I. & N. Dec. 1, n. 1 (1940). As a result, the powers
previously delegated to the Secretary of Labor were transferred to the
Attorney General. See id., at 2.

3 The exercise of discretion was deemed a nunc pro tunc correction of

the record of reentry. In approving of this construction, the Attorney
General concluded that strictly limiting the seventh exception to exclusion
proceedings would be "capricious and whimsical." Id., at 5.

admit excludable aliens. See id., at 187. That proviso, cod-ified at 8 U. S. C. $ 1182(c), stated:

"Aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence whotemporarily proceeded abroad voluntarily and not under
an order of deportation, and who are returning to a law-ful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years,
may be admitted in the discretion of the AttorneyGeneral . . . ."

Like $ 3 of the 1917 Act, $ 212(c) was literally applicable onlyto exclusion proceedings, but it too has been interpreted by
the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) to authorize anypermanent resident alien with "a lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years" to apply for a discretionarywaiver from deportation. See Matter of Silva, 16 I. & N.
Dec. 26, 30 (1976) (adopting position of Francis v. INS, 532F. 2d 268 (CA2 1976)). If relief is granted, the deportation
proceeding is terminated and the alien remains a perma-nent resident.

The extension of $ 212(c) relief to the deportation contexthas had great practical importance, because deportable offenses have historically been defined broadly. For exam-ple, under the INA, aliens are deportable upon conviction
for two crimes of "moral turpitude" (or for one such crimeif it occurred within five years of entry into the country and
resulted in a jail term of at least one year). See 8 U. S. C.$$ 1227(a)(2)(A)(i)-(ii) (1994 ed., Supp. V). In 1988, Congress further specified that an alien is deportable upon con-viction for any "aggravated felony," Anti-Drug Abuse Act
of 1988, 102 Stat. 4469-4470, $ 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), which wasdefined to include numerous offenses without regard to how
long ago they were committed.4 Thus, the class of aliens

4 See 8 U. S. C. $ 1101(a)(43) (1994 ed. and Supp. V). While the term has
always been defined expansively, it was broadened substantially by
IIRIRA. For example, as amended by that statute, the term includes
all convictions for theft or burglary for which a term of imprisonment

surprisingly, a substantial percentage of their applicationsfor $ 212(c) relief have been granted.

of at least one year is imposed (as opposed to five years pre-IIRIRA),
compare $ 1101(a)(43)(G) (1994 ed., Supp. V) with $ 1101(a)(43)(G) (1994
ed.), and all convictions involving fraud or deceit in which the loss to the
victim exceeds $10,000 (as opposed to $200,000 pre-IIRIRA), compare

$ 1101(a)(43)(M)(i) (1994 ed., Supp. V) with $ 1101(a)(43)(M)(i) (1994 ed.).
In addition, the term includes any "crime of violence" resulting in a prison
sentence of at least one year (as opposed to five years pre-IIRIRA), compare $ 1101(a)(43)(F) (1994 ed., Supp. V) with $ 1101(a)(43)(F) (1994 ed.),
and that phrase is itself broadly defined. See 18 U. S. C. $ 16 ("[A]n offense that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of
physical force against the person or property of another," or "any other
offense that is a felony and that, by its nature, involves a substantial risk
that physical force against the person or property of another may be used
in the course of committing the offense").

5 See, e. g., Rannik, The Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act

of 1996: A Death Sentence for the 212(c) Waiver, 28 U. Miami Inter-Am.
L. Rev. 123, 150, n. 80 (1996) (providing statistics indicating that 51.5% of
the applications for which a final decision was reached between 1989 and
1995 were granted); see also Mattis v. Reno, 212 F. 3d 31, 33 (CA1 2000)
("[I]n the years immediately preceding the statute's passage, over half the
applications were granted"); Tasios, 204 F. 3d, at 551 (same).

In developing these changes, the BIA developed criteria, comparable to
common-law rules, for deciding when deportation is appropriate. Those
criteria, which have been set forth in several BIA opinions, see, e. g.,
Matter of Marin, 16 I. & N. Dec. 581 (1978), include the seriousness
of the offense, evidence of either rehabilitation or recidivism, the duration of the alien's residence, the impact of deportation on the family, the
number of citizens in the family, and the character of any service in the
Armed Forces.

6 See Rannik, 28 U. Miami Inter-Am. L. Rev., at 150, n. 80. However,

based on these statistics, one cannot form a reliable estimate of the number of individuals who will be affected by today's decision. Since the 1996
statutes expanded the definition of "aggravated felony" substantially--and
retroactively--the number of individuals now subject to deportation absent $ 212(c) relief is significantly higher than these figures would sug533US2 Unit: $U78 [11-05-02 18:53:21] PAGES PGT: OPLG

Opinion of the Court
Three statutes enacted in recent years have reduced the
size of the class of aliens eligible for such discretionary relief.
In 1990, Congress amended $ 212(c) to preclude from discretionary relief anyone convicted of an aggravated felony
who had served a term of imprisonment of at least five
years. $ 511, 104 Stat. 5052 (amending 8 U. S. C. $ 1182(c)).
In 1996, in $ 440(d) of AEDPA, Congress identified a broad
set of offenses for which convictions would preclude such
relief. See 110 Stat. 1277 (amending 8 U. S. C. $ 1182(c)).7
And finally, that same year, Congress passed IIRIRA. That
statute, inter alia, repealed $ 212(c), see $ 304(b), 110 Stat.
3009-597, and replaced it with a new section that gives the
Attorney General the authority to cancel removal for a
narrow class of inadmissible or deportable aliens, see id.,
at 3009-594 (creating 8 U. S. C. $ 1229b (1994 ed., Supp. V)).
So narrowed, that class does not include anyone previously
"convicted of any aggravated felony." $ 1229b(a)(3) (1994
ed., Supp. V).

In the Attorney General's opinion, these amendments
have entirely withdrawn his $ 212(c) authority to waive deportation for aliens previously convicted of aggravated felonies. Moreover, as a result of other amendments adopted
in AEDPA and IIRIRA, the Attorney General also maintains that there is no judicial forum available to decide
whether these statutes did, in fact, deprive him of the power
to grant such relief. As we shall explain below, we disagree on both points. In our view, a federal court does have
jurisdiction to decide the merits of the legal question, and

gest. In addition, the nature of the changes (bringing under the definition
more minor crimes which may have been committed many years ago) suggests that an increased percentage of applicants will meet the stated criteria for $ 212(c) relief.

7 The new provision barred review for individuals ordered deported because of a conviction for an aggravated felony, for a drug conviction, for
certain weapons or national security violations, and for multiple convictions involving crimes of moral turpitude. See 110 Stat. 1277.

298 INS v. ST. CYR

Opinion of the Court
the District Court and the Court of Appeals decided thatquestion correctly in this case.

II
The first question we must consider is whether the DistrictCourt retains jurisdiction under the general habeas corpus

statute, 28 U. S. C. $ 2241, to entertain St. Cyr's challenge.His application for a writ raises a pure question of law. He
does not dispute any of the facts that establish his deport-ability or the conclusion that he is deportable. Nor does he
contend that he would have any right to have an unfavor-able exercise of the Attorney General's discretion reviewed
in a judicial forum. Rather, he contests the Attorney Gen-eral's conclusion that, as a matter of statutory interpretation,
he is not eligible for discretionary relief.The District Court held, and the Court of Appeals agreed,
that it had jurisdiction to answer that question in a habeascorpus proceeding.

8 The INS argues, however, that four

sections of the 1996 statutes--specifically, $ 401(e) of AEDPAand three secti ons of IIRIRA (8 U. S. C. $$ 1252(a)(1),

1252(a)(2)(C), and 1252(b)(9) (1994 ed., Supp. V))--strippedthe courts of jurisdiction to decide the question of law presented by respondent's habeas corpus application.For the INS to prevail it must overcome both the strong
presumption in favor of judicial review of administrativeaction

9 and the longstanding rule requiring a clear statement of congressional intent to repeal habeas jurisdiction.See Ex parte Yerger, 8 Wall. 85, 102 (1869) ("We are not at

liberty to except from [habeas corpus jurisdiction] any casesnot plainly excepted by law"); Felker v. Turpin, 518 U. S.

mentions our authority to entertain original habeas peti-tions," and the statute "makes no mention of our authority

to hear habeas petitions filed as original matters in thisCourt").

10 Implications from statutory text or legislative

history are not sufficient to repeal habeas jurisdiction; in-stead, Congress must articulate specific and unambiguous

statutory directives to effect a repeal. Ex parte Yerger, 8
Wall., at 105 ("Repeals by implication are not favored. Theyare seldom admitted except on the ground of repugnancy;

and never, we think, when the former act can stand togetherwith the new act").

11

In this case, the plain statement rule draws additionalreinforcement from other canons of statutory construction.

First, as a general matter, when a particular interpretationof a statute invokes the outer limits of Congress' power,
we expect a clear indication that Congress intended that re-sult. See

Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast
Building & Constr. Trades Council, 485 U. S. 568, 575 (1988).
Second, if an otherwise acceptable construction of a statute

into issue, the critical matters involved in the judicial decision." Gregory

be effective, must be `unequivocally expressed' "); Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234, 242 (1985) ("Congress may abrogate the
States' constitutionally secured immunity from suit in federal court
only by making its intention unmistakably clear in the language of the
statute"); see also Eskridge & Frickey, Quasi-Constitutional Law: Clear
Statement Rules as Constitutional Lawmaking, 45 Vand. L. Rev. 593, 597

the constitutional power to do virtually anything").

a clearly expressed congressional intention to the contrary, to regard each
as effective" (internal quotation marks omitted)).

Opinion of the Court
would raise serious constitutional problems, and where analternative interpretation of the statute is "fairly possible,"

see Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S. 22, 62 (1932), we are obli-gated to construe the statute to avoid such problems. See
Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 341, 345-348 (1936) (Bran-deis, J., concurring); United States ex rel. Attorney General
v. Delaware & Hudson Co., 213 U. S. 366, 408 (1909).12A construction of the amendments at issue that would
entirely preclude review of a pure question of law by anycourt would give rise to substantial constitutional questions.
Article I, $ 9, cl. 2, of the Constitution provides: "The Privi-lege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended,
unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the publicSafety may require it." Because of that Clause, some "judicial intervention in deportation cases" is unquestionably"required by the Constitution."

Heikkila v. Barber, 345U. S. 229, 235 (1953).

Unlike the provisions of AEDPA that we construed in
Felker v. Turpin, 518 U. S. 651 (1996), this case involves analien subject to a federal removal order rather than a person

confined pursuant to a state-court conviction. Accordingly,regardless of whether the protection of the Suspension

`[t]he elementary rule is that every reasonable construction must be resorted to, in order to save a statute from unconstitutionality.' This approach . . . also recognizes that Congress, like this Court, is bound by and
swears an oath to uphold the Constitution. The courts will therefore not
lightly assume that Congress intended to infringe constitutionally protected liberties or usurp power constitutionally forbidden it." Edward

"as it existed in 1789." 13 Felker, 518 U. S., at 663-664.

At its historical core, the writ of habeas corpus has
served as a means of reviewing the legality of Executive
detention, and it is in that context that its protections have
been strongest.14 See, e. g., Swain v. Pressley, 430 U. S. 372,

executive authorities without judicial trial"). In England
prior to 1789, in the Colonies,15 and in this Nation during
the formative years of our Government, the writ of habeas
corpus was available to nonenemy aliens as well as to citi13 The fact that this Court would be required to answer the difficult
question of what the Suspension Clause protects is in and of itself a reason to avoid answering the constitutional questions that would be raised
by concluding that review was barred entirely. Cf. Neuman, Habeas
Corpus, Executive Detention, and the Removal of Aliens, 98 Colum. L.
Rev. 961, 980 (1998) (noting that "reconstructing habeas corpus law . . .
[for purposes of a Suspension Clause analysis] would be a difficult enterprise, given fragmentary documentation, state-by-state disuniformity,
and uncertainty about how state practices should be transferred to new
national institutions").

14 At common law, "[w]hile habeas review of a court judgment was

limited to the issue of the sentencing court's jurisdictional competency,
an attack on an executive order could raise all issues relating to the legality of the detention." Note, Developments in the Law--Federal Habeas

Notwithstanding the historical use of habeas corpus toremedy unlawful Executive action, the INS argues that this

case falls outside the traditional scope of the writ at com-mon law. It acknowledges that the writ protected an individual who was held without legal authority, but arguesthat the writ would not issue where "an official had statutory authorization to detain the individual . . . but . . . theofficial was not properly exercising his discretionary power
to determine whether the individual should be released."Brief for Respondent in

Colcano-Martinez v. INS, O. T. 2000,No. 00-1011, p. 33. In this case, the INS points out, there

is no dispute that the INS had authority in law to holdSt. Cyr, as he is eligible for removal. St. Cyr counters that
there is historical evidence of the writ issuing to redress the

23 See, e. g., Ex parte Boggin, 13 East 549, n. (b), 104 Eng. Rep. 484, n. (a)2
(K. B. 1811) (referring to Chalacombe's Case, in which the court required a
response from the Admiralty in a case involving the impressment of a
master of a coal vessel, despite the argument that exemptions for "seafaring persons of this description" were given only as a matter of "grace
and favour," not "of right"); Hollingshead's Case, 1 Salkeld 351, 91 Eng.
Rep. 307 (K. B. 1702) (granting relief on the grounds that the language of

the warrant of commitment--authorizing detention until "otherwise discharged by due course of law"--exceeded the authority granted under the
statute to commit "till [the bankrupt] submit himself to be examined by
the commissioners"); see also Brief for Legal Historians as Amici Curiae
8-10, 18-28.

The dissent, however, relies on Chalacombe's Case as its sole support
for the proposition that courts treated Executive discretion as "lying entirely beyond the judicial ken." See post, at 343 (opinion of Scalia, J.).
Although Lord Ellenborough expressed "some hesitation" as to whether
the case should "stand over for the consideration of the Admiralty," he
concluded that, given the public importance of the question, the response
should be called for. 13 East, at 549, n. (b), 104 Eng. Rep., at 484, n. (a)2.
The case ultimately became moot when the Admiralty discharged Chalacombe, but it is significant that, despite some initial hesitation, the court
decided to proceed.

improper exercise of official discretion. See n. 23, supra;Hafetz, The Untold Story of Noncriminal Habeas Corpus and

the 1996 Immigration Acts, 107 Yale L. J. 2509 (1998).St. Cyr's constitutional position also finds some support
in our prior immigration cases. In Heikkila v. Barber, theCourt observed that the then-existing statutory immigration
scheme "had the effect of precluding judicial intervention indeportation cases

except insofar as it was required by theConstitution," 345 U. S., at 234-235 (emphasis added)--and

that scheme, as discussed below, did allow for review onhabeas of questions of law concerning an alien's eligibility
for discretionary relief. Therefore, while the INS' histori-cal arguments are not insubstantial, the ambiguities in the
scope of the exercise of the writ at common law identifiedby St. Cyr, and the suggestions in this Court's prior decisions as to the extent to which habeas review could be lim-ited consistent with the Constitution, convince us that the
Suspension Clause questions that would be presented bythe INS' reading of the immigration statutes before us are
difficult and significant.24In sum, even assuming that the Suspension Clause protects only the writ as it existed in 1789, there is substantial

340 (opinion of Scalia, J.). He did note that "the first congress of the
United States" acted under "the immediate influence" of the injunction
provided by the Suspension Clause when it gave "life and activity" to
"this great constitutional privilege" in the Judiciary Act of 1789, and that
the writ could not be suspended until after the statute was enacted. 4
Cranch, at 95. That statement, however, surely does not imply that Marshall believed the Framers had drafted a Clause that would proscribe a
temporary abrogation of the writ, while permitting its permanent suspension. Indeed, Marshall's comment expresses the far more sensible view
that the Clause was intended to preclude any possibility that "the privilege itself would be lost" by either the inaction or the action of Congress.
See, e. g., ibid. (noting that the Founders "must have felt, with peculiar
force, the obligation" imposed by the Suspension Clause).

evidence to support the proposition that pure questions oflaw like the one raised by the respondent in this case could

have been answered in 1789 by a common-law judge withpower to issue the writ of habeas corpus. It necessarily follows that a serious Suspension Clause issue would be pre-sented if we were to accept the INS' submission that the
1996 statutes have withdrawn that power from federaljudges and provided no adequate substitute for its exercise.
See Hart, The Power of Congress to Limit the Jurisdictionof Federal Courts: An Exercise in Dialectic, 66 Harv. L. Rev.
1362, 1395-1397 (1953). The necessity of resolving such aserious and difficult constitutional issue--and the desirability of avoiding that necessity--simply reinforce the reasonsfor requiring a clear and unambiguous statement of congressional intent.Moreover, to conclude that the writ is no longer available
in this context would represent a departure from historicalpractice in immigration law. The writ of habeas corpus has
always been available to review the legality of Executivedetention. See Felker, 518 U. S., at 663; Swain v. Pressley,

Federal courts have been authorized toissue writs of habeas corpus since the enactment of the Judiciary Act of 1789, and $ 2241 of the Judicial Code providesthat federal judges may grant the writ of habeas corpus on
the application of a prisoner held "in custody in violation ofthe Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States."

Opinion of the Court
Kaine, 14 How. 103 (1853); United States v. Jung Ah Lung,
124 U. S. 621, 626-632 (1888).

Until the enactment of the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act, the sole means by which an alien could test the legality of his or her deportation order was by bringing a habeas
corpus action in district court.26 See, e. g., United States v.
Jung Ah Lung, 124 U. S. 621 (1888); Heikkila, 345 U. S., at
235; Chin Yow v. United States, 208 U. S. 8 (1908); Ng Fung
Ho v. White, 259 U. S. 276, 284 (1922). In such cases, other
than the question whether there was some evidence to support the order,27 the courts generally did not review factual
determinations made by the Executive. See Ekiu v. United
States, 142 U. S. 651, 659 (1892). However, they did review
the Executive's legal determinations. See Gegiow v. Uhl,
239 U. S. 3, 9 (1915) ("The statute by enumerating the conditions upon which the allowance to land may be denied, prohibits the denial in other cases. And when the record shows
that a commissioner of immigration is exceeding his power,
the alien may demand his release upon habeas corpus"); see
also Neuman, Jurisdiction and the Rule of Law after the 1996
Immigration Act, 113 Harv. L. Rev. 1963, 1965-1969 (2000).28

Shaughnessy v. Pedreiro, 349 U. S. 48 (1955). However, in 1961, Congress
acted to consolidate review in the courts of appeals. See Foti v. INS, 375
U. S. 217 (1963).

27 See, e. g., United States ex rel. Vajtauer v. Commissioner of Immigration, 273 U. S. 103, 106 (1927) (holding that deportation "on charges
unsupported by any evidence is a denial of due process which may be
corrected on habeas corpus").

28 "And when the record shows that a commissioner of immigration

is exceeding his power, the alien may demand his release upon habeas
corpus. The conclusiveness of the decisions of immigration officers under

Habeas courts also regularly answered questions of lawthat arose in the context of discretionary relief. See, e. g.,

United States ex rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy, 347 U. S. 260(1954);

United States ex rel. Hintopoulos v. Shaughnessy,
353 U. S. 72, 77 (1957).30 Traditionally, courts recognized a
distinction between eligibility for discretionary relief, on theone hand, and the favorable exercise of discretion, on the

other hand. See Neuman, 113 Harv. L. Rev., at 1991 (notingthe "strong tradition in habeas corpus law . . . that subjects the legally erroneous failure to exercise discretion,unlike a substantively unwise exercise of discretion, to inquiry on the writ"). Eligibility that was "governed by spe29 See, e. g., Delgadillo v. Carmichael, 332 U. S. 388, 391 (1947) (rejecting
on habeas the Government's interpretation of the statutory term "entry");
Bridges v. Wixon, 326 U. S. 135, 149 (1945) (rejecting on habeas the Government's interpretation of the term "affiliation" with the Communist
Party); Kessler v. Strecker, 307 U. S. 22, 35 (1939) (holding that "as the
Secretary erred in the construction of the statute, the writ must be
granted"). Cf. Mahler v. Eby, 264 U. S. 32, 46 (1924) (reviewing on habeas
the question whether the absence of an explicit factual finding that the
aliens were "undesirable" invalidated the warrant of deportation).

30 Indeed, under the pre-1952 regime which provided only what Heikkila

termed the constitutional minimum of review, on habeas lower federal
courts routinely reviewed decisions under the Seventh Proviso, the statutory predecessor to $ 212(c), to ensure the lawful exercise of discretion.
See, e. g., United States ex rel. Devenuto v. Curran, 299 F. 206 (CA2 1924);
Hee Fuk Yuen v. White, 273 F. 10 (CA9 1921); United States ex rel. Patti
v. Curran, 22 F. 2d 314 (SDNY 1926); Gabriel v. Johnson, 29 F. 2d 347
(CA1 1928). During the same period, habeas was also used to review
legal questions that arose in the context of the Government's exercise of
other forms of discretionary relief under the 1917 Act. See, e. g., United
States ex rel. Adel v. Shaughnessy, 183 F. 2d 371 (CA2 1950); United States
ex rel. Kaloudis v. Shaughnessy, 180 F. 2d 489 (CA2 1950); Mastrapasqua

Opinion of the Court
cific statutory standards" provided "a right to a ruling onan applicant's eligibility," even though the actual granting of

relief was "not a matter of right under any circumstances,but rather is in all cases a matter of grace."

Jay v. Boyd,
351 U. S. 345, 353-354 (1956). Thus, even though the actualsuspension of deportation authorized by $ 19(c) of the Immigration Act of 1917 was a matter of grace, in United States
ex rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy, 347 U. S. 260 (1954), we held
that a deportable alien had a right to challenge the Executive's failure to exercise the discretion authorized by the law.
The exercise of the District Court's habeas corpus jurisdiction to answer a pure question of law in this case is entirely
consistent with the exercise of such jurisdiction in Accardi.
See also United States ex rel. Hintopoulos v. Shaughnessy,
353 U. S., at 77.

Thus, under the pre-1996 statutory scheme--and consistent with its common-law antecedents--it is clear that St. Cyr
could have brought his challenge to the BIA's legal determination in a habeas corpus petition under 28 U. S. C. $ 2241.
The INS argues, however, that AEDPA and IIRIRA contain
four provisions that express a clear and unambiguous statement of Congress' intent to bar petitions brought under

$ 2241, despite the fact that none of them mention that section. The first of those provisions is AEDPA's $ 401(e).

While the title of $ 401(e)--"Elimination of Custody
Review by Habeas Corpus"--would seem to support the
INS' submission, the actual text of that provision does not.31
As we have previously noted, a title alone is not controlling.

212 (1998) (" `[T]he title of a statute . . . cannot limit theplain meaning of the text. For interpretive purposes, [it is]

of use only when [it] shed[s] light on some ambiguous wordor phrase' " (quoting Trainmen v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co.,
331 U. S. 519, 528-529 (1947))). The actual text of $ 401(e),unlike its title, merely repeals a subsection of the 1961 statute amending the judicial review provisions of the 1952Immigration and Nationality Act. See n. 31,

supra. Nei-ther the title nor the text makes any mention of 28 U. S. C.

$ 2241.Under the 1952 Act, district courts had broad authority to
grant declaratory and injunctive relief in immigration cases,including orders adjudicating deportability and those denying suspensions of deportability. See Foti v. INS, 375 U. S.217, 225-226 (1963). The 1961 Act withdrew that jurisdiction from the district courts and provided that the pro-cedures set forth in the Hobbs Act would be the "sole and
exclusive procedure" for judicial review of final orders of de-portation, subject to a series of exceptions. See 75 Stat.
651. The last of those exceptions stated that "any alien heldin custody pursuant to an order of deportation may obtain
review thereof by habeas corpus proceedings." See id., at652, codified at 8 U. S. C. $ 1105a(10) (repealed Sept. 30,
1996).The INS argues that the inclusion of that exception in the
1961 Act indicates that Congress must have believed thatit would otherwise have withdrawn the pre-existing habeas
corpus jurisdiction in deportation cases, and that, as a result,the repeal of that exception in AEDPA in 1996 implicitly
achieved that result. It seems to us, however, that the 1961exception is best explained as merely confirming the limited
scope of the new review procedures. In fact, the 1961 HouseReport provides that this section "in no way disturbs the
Habeas Corpus Act." 32 H. R. Rep. No. 1086, 87th Cong., 1st

32 Moreover, the focus of the 1961 amendments appears to have been
the elimination of Administrative Procedure Act (APA) suits that were
brought in the district court and that sought declaratory relief. See, e. g.,

Opinion of the Court
Sess., 29 (1961). Moreover, a number of the courts that con-sidered the interplay between the general habeas provision

and INA $ 106(a)(10) after the 1961 Act and before the enact-ment of AEDPA did not read the 1961 Act's specific habeas
provision as supplanting jurisdiction under $ 2241. Orozcov. INS, 911 F. 2d 539, 541 (CA11 1990); United States ex rel.

grant of habeas jurisdiction or simply as an acknowledgmentof continued jurisdiction pursuant to $ 2241, its repeal cannot
be sufficient to eliminate what it did not originally grant--namely, habeas jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U. S. C. $ 2241.

See Ex parte Yerger, 8 Wall., at 105-106 (concluding that therepeal of "an additional grant of jurisdiction" does not "operate as a repeal of jurisdiction theretofore allowed"); Ex parteMcCardle, 7 Wall. 506, 515 (1869) (concluding that the repeal
of portions of the 1867 statute conferring appellate jurisdic-tion on the Supreme Court in habeas proceedings did "not
affect the jurisdiction which was previously exercised").The INS also relies on three provisions of IIRIRA,
now codified at 8 U. S. C. $$ 1252(a)(1), 1252(a)(2)(C), and
H. R. No. 2478, 85th Cong., 2d Sess., 9 (1958) ("[H]abeas corpus is a far

1252(b)(9) (1994 ed., Supp. V). As amended by $ 306 ofIIRIRA, 8 U. S. C. $ 1252(a)(1) (1994 ed., Supp. V) now provides that, with certain exceptions, including those set outin subsection (b) of the same statutory provision, "[ j]udicial
review of a final order of removal . . . is governed only by"the Hobbs Act's procedures for review of agency orders
in the courts of appeals. Similarly, $ 1252(b)(9), which addresses the "[c]onsolidation of questions for judicial review,"provides that "[ j]udicial review of all questions of law and

fact, including interpretation and application of constitu-tional and statutory provisions, arising from any action
taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien from theUnited States under this subchapter shall be available only
in judicial review of a final order under this section." 34 Fi-nally, $ 1252(a)(2)(C), which concerns "[m]atters not subject
to judicial review," states: "Notwithstanding any other pro-vision of law, no court shall have jurisdiction to review any
final order of removal against an alien who is removable by
reason of having committed" certain enumerated criminal
offenses.

The term "judicial review" or "jurisdiction to review" is
the focus of each of these three provisions. In the immigration context, "judicial review" and "habeas corpus" have
historically distinct meanings. See Heikkila v. Barber, 345
U. S. 229 (1953). In Heikkila, the Court concluded that the
finality provisions at issue "preclud[ed] judicial review" to
the maximum extent possible under the Constitution, and
thus concluded that the APA was inapplicable. Id., at 235.
Nevertheless, the Court reaffirmed the right to habeas

34 Title 8 U. S. C. $ 1252(g) (1994 ed., Supp. V), entitled "Exclusive jurisdiction," is not relevant to our analysis of the jurisdictional issue. In
Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U. S. 471 (1999)
(AADC), we explained that that provision applied only to three types
of discretionary decisions by the Attorney General--specifically, to commence proceedings, to adjudicate cases, or to execute removal orders--
none of which are at issue here.

the judicial review authorized by the APA, the Court con-cluded that "it is the scope of inquiry on habeas corpus that
differentiates" habeas review from "judicial review." Id., at236; see also, e. g., Terlinden v. Ames, 184 U. S. 270, 278
(1902) (noting that under the extradition statute then ineffect there was "no right of review to be exercised by any
court or judicial officer," but that limited review on habeaswas nevertheless available);

inquiry on habeas, it could not be "impeached or reviewed").Both $$ 1252(a)(1) and (a)(2)(C) speak of "judicial review"--
that is, full, nonhabeas review. Neither explicitly mentionshabeas,

35 or 28 U. S. C. $ 2241.36 Accordingly, neither pro35 Contrary to the dissent, see post, at 330 (opinion of Scalia, J.), we do
not think, given the longstanding distinction between "judicial review"
and "habeas," that $ 1252(e)(2)'s mention of habeas in the subsection governing "[j]udicial review of orders under section 1225(b)(1)" is sufficient
to establish that Congress intended to abrogate the historical distinction between two terms of art in the immigration context when enacting
IIRIRA.

"[W]here Congress borrows terms of art in which are accumulated the
legal tradition and meaning of centuries of practice, it presumably knows
and adopts the cluster of ideas that were attached to each borrowed word
in the body of learning from which it was taken and the meaning its
use will convey to the judicial mind unless otherwise instructed. In such
case, absence of contrary direction may be taken as satisfaction with
widely accepted definitions, not as a departure from them." Morissette
v. United States, 342 U. S. 246, 263 (1952).

At most, $ 1252(e)(2) introduces additional statutory ambiguity, but
ambiguity does not help the INS in this case. As we noted above, only
the clearest statement of congressional intent will support the INS' position. See supra, at 305.

36 It is worth noting that in enacting the provisions of AEDPA and

IIRIRA that restricted or altered judicial review, Congress did refer
specifically to several different sources of jurisdiction. See, e. g., $ 381,
110 Stat. 3009-650 (adding to grant of jurisdiction under 8 U. S. C. $ 1329
(1994 ed., Supp. V) a provision barring jurisdiction under that provision

Opinion of the Court
vision speaks with sufficient clarity to bar jurisdiction pur-suant to the general habeas statute.

The INS also makes a separate argument based on 8U. S. C. $ 1252(b)(9) (1994 ed., Supp. V). We have previously described $ 1252(b)(9) as a "zipper clause." AADC,525 U. S. 471, 483 (1999). Its purpose is to consolidate "judicial review" of immigration proceedings into one actionin the court of appeals, but it applies only "[w]ith respect to
review of an order of removal under subsection (a)(1)."8 U. S. C. $ 1252(b) (1994 ed., Supp. V).

37 Accordingly, this

provision, by its own terms, does not bar habeas jurisdic-tion over removal orders

not subject to judicial reviewunder $ 1252(a)(1)--including orders against aliens who are

removable by reason of having committed one or more crimi-nal offenses. Subsection (b)(9) simply provides for the consolidation of issues to be brought in petitions for "[ j]udicialreview," which, as we note above, is a term historically disfor suits against the United States or its officers or agents). Section
401(e), which eliminated supplemental habeas jurisdiction under the
INA, expressly strikes paragraph 10 of $ 106(a) of the INA, not 28 U. S. C.

$ 2241. Similarly, $ 306 of IIRIRA, which enacted the new INA $ 242,
specifically precludes reliance on the provisions of the APA providing for
the taking of additional evidence, and imposes specific limits on the availability of declaratory relief. See, e. g., 8 U. S. C. $ 1535(e)(2) (1994 ed.,
Supp. V) (explicitly barring aliens detained under "alien terrorist removal"
procedures from seeking "judicial review, including application for a writ
of habeas corpus, except for a claim by the alien that continued detention
violates the alien's rights under the Constitution"). At no point, however, does IIRIRA make express reference to $ 2241. Given the historic
use of $ 2241 jurisdiction as a means of reviewing deportation and exclusion orders, Congress' failure to refer specifically to $ 2241 is particularly
significant. Cf. Chisom v. Roemer, 501 U. S. 380, 396, n. 23 (1991).

37 As we noted in AADC, courts construed the 1961 amendments as

channeling review of final orders to the courts of appeals, but still permitting district courts to exercise their traditional jurisdiction over
claims that were viewed as being outside of a "final order." 525 U. S.,
at 485. Read in light of this history, $ 1252(b)(9) ensures that review of
those types of claims will now be consolidated in a petition for review and
considered by the courts of appeals.

tinct from habeas. See Mahadeo v. Reno, 226 F. 3d 3, 12(CA1 2000); Flores-Miramontes v. INS, 212 F. 3d 1133, 1140

(CA9 2000). It follows that $ 1252(b)(9) does not clearlyapply to actions brought pursuant to the general habeas
statute, and thus cannot repeal that statute either in partor in whole.

If it were clear that the question of law could be an-swered in another judicial forum, it might be permissible to
accept the INS' reading of $ 1252. But the absence of sucha forum, coupled with the lack of a clear, unambiguous, and
express statement of congressional intent to preclude judi-cial consideration on habeas of such an important question
of law, strongly counsels against adopting a construction thatwould raise serious constitutional questions.

38 Cf. Felker,

518 U. S., at 660-661. Accordingly, we conclude that habeasjurisdiction under $ 2241 was not repealed by AEDPA and

IIRIRA. III

The absence of a clearly expressed statement of con-gressional intent also pervades our review of the merits of
St. Cyr's claim. Two important legal consequences ensuedfrom respondent's entry of a guilty plea in March 1996: (1) He
became subject to deportation, and (2) he became eligiblefor a discretionary waiver of that deportation under the pre38 The dissent argues that our decision will afford more rights to criminal aliens than to noncriminal aliens. However, as we have noted, the
scope of review on habeas is considerably more limited than on APA-style
review. Moreover, this case raises only a pure question of law as to respondent's statutory eligibility for discretionary relief, not, as the dissent
suggests, an objection to the manner in which discretion was exercised.
As to the question of timing and congruent means of review, we note
that Congress could, without raising any constitutional questions, provide
an adequate substitute through the courts of appeals. See, e. g., Swain v.
Pressley, 430 U. S. 372, 381 (1977) ("[T]he substitution of a collateral remedy which is neither inadequate nor ineffective to test the legality of a
person's detention" does not violate the Suspension Clause).

vailing interpretation of $ 212(c). When IIRIRA went intoeffect in April 1997, the first consequence was unchanged

except for the fact that the term "removal" was substitutedfor "deportation." The issue that remains to be resolved is
whether IIRIRA $ 304(b) changed the second consequenceby eliminating respondent's eligibility for a waiver.

The INS submits that the statute resolves the issue because it unambiguously communicates Congress' intent toapply the provisions of IIRIRA's Title III-A to all removals

initiated after the effective date of the statute, and, in anyevent, its provisions only operate prospectively and not
retrospectively. The Court of Appeals, relying primarilyon the analysis in our opinion in

Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244 (1994), held, contrary to the INS' argu-ments, that Congress' intentions concerning the application

of the "Cancellation of Removal" procedure are ambiguousand that the statute imposes an impermissible retroactive
effect on aliens who, in reliance on the possibility of $ 212(c)relief, pleaded guilty to aggravated felonies. See 229 F. 3d,
at 416, 420. We agree.

Retroactive statutes raise special concerns. See Landgraf, 511 U. S., at 266. "The Legislature's unmatched powers allow it to sweep away settled expectations suddenlyand without individualized consideration. Its responsivity

to political pressures poses a risk that it may be temptedto use retroactive legislation as a means of retribution
against unpopular groups or individuals." 39 Ibid. Accordingly, "congressional enactments . . . will not be construed
to have retroactive effect unless their language requires this

39 The INS appears skeptical of the notion that immigrants might be
considered an " `unpopular group.' " See Brief for Petitioner 15, n. 8.
But see Legomsky, Fear and Loathing in Congress and the Courts: Immigration and Judicial Review, 78 Texas L. Rev. 1615, 1626 (2000) (observing
that, because noncitizens cannot vote, they are particularly vulnerable to
adverse legislation).

result." Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hospital, 488 U. S.204, 208 (1988).

"[This] presumption against retroactive legislation isdeeply rooted in our jurisprudence, and embodies a legal
doctrine centuries older than our Republic. Elemen-tary considerations of fairness dictate that individuals
should have an opportunity to know what the law is andto conform their conduct accordingly; settled expectations should not be lightly disrupted. For that reason,the `principle that the legal effect of conduct should
ordinarily be assessed under the law that existed whenthe conduct took place has timeless and universal human
appeal.' Kaiser, 494 U. S., at 855 (Scalia, J., concurring). In a free, dynamic society, creativity in bothcommercial and artistic endeavors is fostered by a rule

of law that gives people confidence about the legal con-sequences of their actions."

Landgraf, 511 U. S., at
265-266 (footnote omitted).

Despite the dangers inherent in retroactive legislation,it is beyond dispute that, within constitutional limits, Congress has the power to enact laws with retrospective effect.
See id., at 268. A statute may not be applied retroactively,however, absent a clear indication from Congress that it

intended such a result. "Requiring clear intent assures thatCongress itself has affirmatively considered the potential
unfairness of retroactive application and determined that itis an acceptable price to pay for the countervailing benefits."
Id., at 272-273. Accordingly, the first step in determiningwhether a statute has an impermissible retroactive effect is
to ascertain whether Congress has directed with the requisite clarity that the law be applied retrospectively. Martin
v. Hadix, 527 U. S. 343, 352 (1999).

The standard for finding such unambiguous direction is a
demanding one. "[C]ases where this Court has found truly
`retroactive' effect adequately authorized by statute have

Opinion of the Court
involved statutory language that was so clear that it couldsustain only one interpretation." Lindh v. Murphy, 521

U. S. 320, 328, n. 4 (1997). The INS makes several argu-ments in favor of its position that IIRIRA achieves this
high level of clarity.First, the INS points to the comprehensive nature of
IIRIRA's revision of federal immigration law. "Congress'scomprehensive establishment of a new immigration framework," the INS argues, "shows its intent that, after a tran-sition period, the provisions of the old law should no longer
be applied at all." Brief for Petitioner 33-34. We rejecteda similar argument, however, in

Landgraf, a case that, likethis one, involved Congress' comprehensive revision of an

important federal statute. 511 U. S., at 260-261. By itself,the comprehensiveness of a congressional enactment says
nothing about Congress' intentions with respect to the retro-activity of the enactment's individual provisions.

40

The INS also points to the effective date for Title III-Aas providing a clear statement of congressional intent to

apply IIRIRA's repeal of $ 212(c) retroactively. See IIRIRA$ 309(a), 110 Stat. 3009-625. But the mere promulgation of
an effective date for a statute does not provide sufficient as-surance that Congress specifically considered the potential
unfairness that retroactive application would produce. Forthat reason, a "statement that a statute will become effective
on a certain date does not even arguably suggest that it hasany application to conduct that occurred at an earlier date."
Landgraf, 511 U. S., at 257.The INS further argues that any ambiguity in Congress'
intent is wiped away by the "saving provision" in IIRIRA$ 309(c)(1), 110 Stat. 3009-625. Brief for Petitioner 34-36.
That provision states that, for aliens whose exclusion or de-portation proceedings began prior to the Title III-A effec40 The INS' argument that refusing to apply $ 304(b) retroactively creates an unrecognizable hybrid of old and new is, for the same reason,
unconvincing.

tive date, "the amendments made by [Title III-A] shall notapply, and . . . the proceedings (including judicial review

thereof) shall continue to be conducted without regard tosuch amendments."

41 This rule, however, does not communicate with unmistakable clarity Congress' intention toapply its repeal of $ 212(c) retroactively. Nothing in either

$ 309(c)(1) or the statute's legislative history even discussesthe effect of the statute on proceedings based on pre-IIRIRA
convictions that are commenced after its effective date.42Section 309(c)(1) is best read as merely setting out the

proce-dural rules to be applied to removal proceedings pending

on the effective date of the statute. Because "[c]hanges inprocedural rules may often be applied in suits arising before
their enactment without raising concerns about retroactiv-ity," Landgraf, 511 U. S., at 275, it was necessary for Congress to identify which set of procedures would apply inthose circumstances. As the Conference Report expressly
explained, "[$ 309(c)] provides for the transition to new procedures in the case of an alien already in exclusion or depor-tation proceedings on the effective date." H. R. Conf. Rep.

No. 104-828, p. 222 (1996) (emphasis added).Another reason for declining to accept the INS' invitation
to read $ 309(c)(1) as dictating the temporal reach of IIRIRA$ 304(b) is provided by Congress' willingness, in other sections of IIRIRA, to indicate unambiguously its intention

41 "(c) Transition for Aliens in Proceedings.--
"(1) General rule that new rules do not apply.--Subject to the
succeeding provisions of this subsection, in the case of an alien who is in
exclusion or deportation proceedings as of the title III-A effective date--

"(A) the amendments made by this subtitle shall not apply, and
"(B) the proceedings (including judicial review thereof) shall continue
to be conducted without regard to such amendments." $ 309, 110 Stat.
3009-625.

42 The INS' reliance, see Reply Brief for Petitioner 12, on INS v.

Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U. S. 415, 420 (1999), is beside the point because
that decision simply observed that the new rules would not apply to a
proceeding filed before IIRIRA's effective date.

as IIRIRA $ 321(b), which addresses IIRIRA's redefinition of "aggravated

gress made some provisions of IIRIRA expressly applicableto prior convictions, but did not do so in regard to $ 304(b),

is an indication "that Congress did not definitively decidethe issue of $ 304's retroactive application to pre-enactment
convictions." See 229 F. 3d, at 415. The "saving provision"is therefore no more significant than the specification of an
effective date.The presumption against retroactive application of ambiguous statutory provisions, buttressed by "the longstandingprinciple of construing any lingering ambiguities in deportation statutes in favor of the alien," INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca,480 U. S. 421, 449 (1987), forecloses the conclusion that, in
enacting $ 304(b), "Congress itself has affirmatively consid-ered the potential unfairness of retroactive application and
determined that it is an acceptable price to pay for the coun-tervailing benefits."

44 Landgraf, 511 U. S., at 272-273. We

therefore proceed to the second step of Landgraf 's retro-activity analysis in order to determine whether depriving

removable aliens of consideration for $ 212(c) relief pro-duces an impermissible retroactive effect for aliens who,
like respondent, were convicted pursuant to a plea agree-ment at a time when their plea would not have rendered
them ineligible for $ 212(c) relief.45
felony," deal with subjects quite closely related to $ 304(b)'s elimination of

$ 212(c) relief for aliens convicted of aggravated felonies.

44 The legislative history is significant because, despite its comprehensive character, it contains no evidence that Congress specifically considered the question of the applicability of IIRIRA $ 304(b) to pre-IIRIRA
convictions. Cf. Harrison v. PPG Industries, Inc., 446 U. S. 578, 602
(1980) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) (" `In a case where the construction of
legislative language such as this makes so sweeping and so relatively unorthodox a change as that made here, I think judges as well as detectives
may take into consideration the fact that a watchdog did not bark in the
night' "), cited in Chisom v. Roemer, 501 U. S., at 396, n. 23 (citing A. Doyle,
Silver Blaze, in The Complete Sherlock Holmes 335 (1927)).

45 The INS argues that we should extend deference under Chevron

Opinion of the Court
"The inquiry into whether a statute operates retroac-tively demands a commonsense, functional judgment about

`whether the new provision attaches new legal consequencesto events completed before its enactment.' "

Martin, 527
U. S., at 357-358 (quoting Landgraf, 511 U. S., at 270). Astatute has retroactive effect when it " `takes away or impairs vested rights acquired under existing laws, or creates
a new obligation, imposes a new duty, or attaches a new dis-ability, in respect to transactions or considerations already

past . . . .' " 46 Id., at 269 (quoting Society for Propagation
of the Gospel v. Wheeler, 22 F. Cas. 756, 767 (No. 13,156)
(CC NH 1814) (Story, J.)). As we have repeatedly coun-seled, the judgment whether a particular statute acts retroactively "should be informed and guided by `familiar consid-erations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and settled
expectations.' " Martin, 527 U. S., at 358 (quoting Landgraf, 511 U. S., at 270).

IIRIRA's elimination of any possibility of $ 212(c) relief
for people who entered into plea agreements with the expectation that they would be eligible for such relief clearly
" `attaches a new disability, in respect to transactions or
considerations already past.' " Id., at 269. Plea agreements involve a quid pro quo between a criminal defendant
and the government. See Newton v. Rumery, 480 U. S. 386,

portation proceedings initiated after IIRIRA's effective date. We only
defer, however, to agency interpretations of statutes that, applying the
normal "tools of statutory construction," are ambiguous. Id., at 843, n. 9;
INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U. S., at 447-448. Because a statute that
is ambiguous with respect to retroactive application is construed under
our precedent to be unambiguously prospective, Landgraf, 511 U. S., at
264, there is, for Chevron purposes, no ambiguity in such a statute for an
agency to resolve.

46 As we noted in Hughes Aircraft Co. v. United States ex rel. Schumer,

520 U. S. 939 (1997), this language by Justice Story "does not purport
to define the outer limit of impermissible retroactivity." Id., at 947. Instead, it simply describes several "sufficient," as opposed to "necessary,"
conditions for finding retroactivity. Ibid.

without the expenditure of prosecutorial resources." 47 Ibid.There can be little doubt that, as a general matter, alien defendants considering whether to enter into a plea agreementare acutely aware of the immigration consequences of their
convictions.48 See Magana-Pizano v. INS, 200 F. 3d 603,612 (CA9 1999) ("That an alien charged with a crime . . .
would factor the immigration consequences of convictionin deciding whether to plead or proceed to trial is welldocumented"); see also 3 Bender, Criminal Defense Tech-niques $$ 60A.01, 60A.02[2] (1999) (" `Preserving the client's

yers et al. as Amici Curiae 13)). Given the frequency withwhich $ 212(c) relief was granted in the years leading up to

AEDPA and IIRIRA,49 preserving the possibility of such re-lief would have been one of the principal benefits sought by
defendants deciding whether to accept a plea offer or insteadto proceed to trial.

50

The case of Charles Jideonwo, a petitioner in a parallellitigation in the Seventh Circuit, is instructive. Charged in

1994 with violating federal narcotics law, Jideonwo enteredinto extensive plea negotiations with the Government, the
sole purpose of which was to ensure that " `he got lessthan five years to avoid what would have been a statutory bar on 212(c) relief.' " Jideonwo v. INS, 224 F. 3d 692,699 (CA7 2000) (quoting the Immigration Judge's findings of
fact). The potential for unfairness in the retroactive appli-cation of IIRIRA $ 304(b) to people like Jideonwo and St. Cyr
is significant and manifest. Relying upon settled practice,the advice of counsel, and perhaps even assurances in open
court that the entry of the plea would not foreclose $ 212(c)relief, a great number of defendants in Jideonwo's and
St. Cyr's position agreed to plead guilty.51 Now that prose-cutors have received the benefit of these plea agreements,
agreements that were likely facilitated by the aliens' beliefin their continued eligibility for $ 212(c) relief, it would surely
be contrary to "familiar considerations of fair notice, reason-able reliance, and settled expectations," Landgraf, 511 U. S.,

49 See n. 5, supra.
50 Even if the defendant were not initially aware of $ 212(c), competent defense counsel, following the advice of numerous practice guides,
would have advised him concerning the provision's importance. See Brief

324 INS v. ST. CYR

Opinion of the Court
at 270, to hold that IIRIRA's subsequent restrictions deprivethem of any possibility of such relief.

52

The INS argues that deportation proceedings (and theAttorney General's discretionary power to grant relief from

deportation) are "inherently prospective" and that, as aresult, application of the law of deportation can never have
a retroactive effect. Such categorical arguments are not
particularly helpful in undertaking Landgraf 's common-sense, functional retroactivity analysis. See

Martin, 527
U. S., at 359. Moreover, although we have characterizeddeportation as "look[ing] prospectively to the respondent's

right to remain in this country in the future," INS v. LopezMendoza, 468 U. S. 1032, 1038 (1984), we have done so in
order to reject the argument that deportation is punish-ment for past behavior and that deportation proceedings

are therefore subject to the "various protections that applyin the context of a criminal trial."

Ibid. As our cases make
clear, the presumption against retroactivity applies far be-yond the confines of the criminal law. See

Landgraf, 511
U. S., at 272. And our mere statement that deportation is
not punishment for past crimes does not mean that we can-not consider an alien's reasonable reliance on the continued

availability of discretionary relief from deportation whendeciding whether the elimination of such relief has a retroactive effect.53

52 The significance of that reliance is obvious to those who have participated in the exercise of the discretion that was previously available to
delegates of the Attorney General under $ 212(c). See In re Soriano, 16
BIA Immig. Rptr. B1-227, B1-238 to B1-239 (1996) (Rosenberg, Board
Member, concurring and dissenting) ("I find compelling policy and practical reasons to go beyond such a limited interpretation as the one the
majority proposes in this case. All of these people, and no doubt many
others, had settled expectations to which they conformed their conduct").

53 We are equally unconvinced by the INS' comparison of the elimination

of $ 212(c) relief for people like St. Cyr with the Clayton Act's elimination of federal courts' power to enjoin peaceful labor actions. In American Steel Foundries v. Tri-City Central Trades Council, 257 U. S. 184
(1921), and Duplex Printing Press Co. v. Deering, 254 U. S. 443, 464 (1921),

325Cite as: 533 U. S. 289 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
Finally, the fact that $ 212(c) relief is discretionary doesnot affect the propriety of our conclusion. There is a clear

difference, for the purposes of retroactivity analysis, be-tween facing possible deportation and facing certain deportation. Cf. Hughes Aircraft Co. v. United States ex rel.Schumer, 520 U. S. 939, 949 (1997) (an increased likelihood
of facing a qui tam action constitutes an impermissible ret-roactive effect for the defendant);

Lindsey v. Washington,301 U. S. 397, 401 (1937) ("Removal of the possibility of a

sentence of less than fifteen years . . . operates to [de-fendants'] detriment" (emphasis added)). Prior to AEDPA
and IIRIRA, aliens like St. Cyr had a significant likelihoodof receiving $ 212(c) relief.

54 Because respondent, and other

aliens like him, almost certainly relied upon that likelihoodin deciding whether to forgo their right to a trial, the elimination of any possibility of $ 212(c) relief by IIRIRA has anobvious and severe retroactive effect.

55

we applied the Clayton Act's limitations on injunctive relief to cases
pending at the time of the statute's passage. But unlike the elimination
of $ 212(c) relief in this case, which depends upon an alien's decision to
plead guilty to an "aggravated felony," the deprivation of the District
Court's power to grant injunctive relief at issue in Duplex Printing did
not in any way result from or depend on the past action of the party
seeking the injunction. Thus, it could not plausibly have been argued
that the Clayton Act attached a " `new disability, in respect to transactions
or considerations already past.' " Landgraf, 511 U. S., at 269.

54 See n. 5, supra.

55 The INS cites several cases affirming Congress' power to retroactively

unsettle such expectations in the immigration context. See Brief for Petitioner 40-41, and n. 21. But our recognition that Congress has the power
to act retrospectively in the immigration context sheds no light on the
question at issue at this stage of the Landgraf analysis: whether a particular statute in fact has such a retroactive effect. Moreover, our decision
today is fully consistent with a recognition of Congress' power to act retrospectively. We simply assert, as we have consistently done in the past,
that in legislating retroactively, Congress must make its intention plain.

Similarly, the fact that Congress has the power to alter the rights of
resident aliens to remain in the United States is not determinative of the
question whether a particular statute has a retroactive effect. See Chew
Heong v. United States, 112 U. S. 536 (1884). Applying a statute barring

Scalia, J., dissenting
We find nothing in IIRIRA unmistakably indicating thatCongress considered the question whether to apply its repeal

of $ 212(c) retroactively to such aliens. We therefore holdthat $ 212(c) relief remains available for aliens, like respondent, whose convictions were obtained through plea agree-ments and who, notwithstanding those convictions, would
have been eligible for $ 212(c) relief at the time of their pleaunder the law then in effect.

The judgment is affirmed.

It is so ordered.

Justice O'Connor, dissenting.
I join Parts I and III of Justice Scalia's dissenting opin-ion in this case. I do not join Part II because I believe that,

assuming, arguendo, that the Suspension Clause guaranteessome minimum extent of habeas review, the right asserted
by the alien in this case falls outside the scope of that reviewfor the reasons explained by

Justice Scalia in Part II-Bof his dissenting opinion. The question whether the Suspension Clause assures habeas jurisdiction in this particular
case properly is resolved on this ground alone, and there isno need to say more.

Justice Scalia, with whom The Chief Justice and
Justice Thomas join, and with whom Justice O'Connorjoins as to Parts I and III, dissenting.

The Court today finds ambiguity in the utterly clear lan-guage of a statute that forbids the district court (and all

Chinese nationals from reentering the country without a certificate prepared when they left to people who exited the country before the statute
went into effect would have retroactively unsettled their reliance on the
state of the law when they departed. See id., at 559. So too, applying
IIRIRA $ 304(b) to aliens who pleaded guilty or nolo contendere to crimes
on the understanding that, in so doing, they would retain the ability to
seek discretionary $ 212(c) relief would retroactively unsettle their reliance

other courts) to entertain the claims of aliens such as re-spondent St. Cyr, who have been found deportable by reason

of their criminal acts. It fabricates a superclear statement,"magic words" requirement for the congressional expression of such an intent, unjustified in law and unparalleled inany other area of our jurisprudence. And as the fruit of its
labors, it brings forth a version of the statute that affords
criminal aliens more opportunities for delay-inducing judi-cial review than are afforded to noncriminal aliens, or even

than were afforded to criminal aliens prior to this legislationconcededly designed to expedite their removal. Because it
is clear that the law deprives us of jurisdiction to entertainthis suit, I respectfully dissent.

I
In categorical terms that admit of no exception, the IllegalImmigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of

1996 (IIRIRA), 110 Stat. 3009-546, unambiguously repealsthe application of 28 U. S. C. $ 2241 (the general habeas
corpus provision), and of all other provisions for judicial re-view, to deportation challenges brought by certain kinds
of criminal aliens. This would have been readily appar-ent to the reader, had the Court at the outset of its opinion set forth the relevant provisions of IIRIRA and ofits statutory predecessor, the Antiterrorism and Effective
Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214. I willbegin by supplying that deficiency, and explaining IIRIRA's
jurisdictional scheme. It begins with what we have calleda channeling or " `zipper' clause,"

Reno v. American-ArabAnti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U. S. 471, 483 (1999)--

namely, 8 U. S. C. $ 1252(b)(9) (1994 ed., Supp. V). Thisprovision, entitled "Consolidation of questions for judicial
review," provides as follows:

"Judicial review of all questions of law and fact, in-cluding interpretation and application of constitutional

and statutory provisions, arising from any action taken

Scalia, J., dissenting
or proceeding brought to remove an alien from theUnited States under this subchapter shall be available only in judicial review of a final order under thissection." (Emphases added.)

In other words, if any review is available of any "questio[n]of law . . . arising from any action taken or proceeding
brought to remove an alien from the United States underthis subchapter," it is available "only in judicial review of a
final order under this section [$ 1252]." What kind of reviewdoes that section provide? That is set forth in $ 1252(a)(1),
which states:

"Judicial review of a final order of removal (other thanan order of removal without a hearing pursuant to [the

expedited-removal provisions for undocumented aliensarriving at the border found in] section 1225(b)(1) of
this title) is governed only by chapter 158 of title 28[the Hobbs Act], except as provided in subsection (b)
of this section [which modifies some of the Hobbs Actprovisions] and except that the court may not order
the taking of additional evidence under section 2347(c)of [Title 28]."

In other words, if judicial review is available, it consists onlyof the modified Hobbs Act review specified in $ 1252(a)(1).

In some cases (including, as it happens, the one before us),there can be no review at all, because IIRIRA categorically
and unequivocally rules out judicial review of challengesto deportation brought by certain kinds of criminal aliens.
Section 1252(a)(2)(C) provides:

"Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no courtshall have jurisdiction to review

any final order of re-moval against an alien who is removable by reason of

having committed [one or more enumerated] criminaloffense[s] [including drug-trafficking offenses of the sort
of which respondent had been convicted]." (Emphasesadded.)

Finally, the pre-IIRIRA antecedent to the foregoing pro-visions--AEDPA $ 401(e)--and the statutory background

against which that was enacted, confirm that $ 2241 habeasreview, in the district court or elsewhere, has been unequivocally repealed. In 1961, Congress amended the Immigrationand Nationality Act of 1952 (INA), 66 Stat. 163, by directing
that the procedure for Hobbs Act review in the courts ofappeals "shall apply to, and shall be the

sole and exclusiveprocedure for, the judicial review of all final orders of deportation" under the INA. 8 U. S. C. $ 1105a(a) (repealed Sept.30, 1996) (emphasis added). Like 8 U. S. C. $ 1252(a)(2)(C)
(1994 ed., Supp. V), this provision squarely prohibited $ 2241district-court habeas review. At the same time that it enacted this provision, however, the 1961 Congress enacted aspecific exception: "any alien held in custody pursuant to
an order of deportation may obtain judicial review thereofby habeas corpus proceedings," 8 U. S. C. $ 1105a(a)(10) (1994
ed.). (This would of course have been surplusage had $ 2241habeas review not been covered by the "sole and exclusive
procedure" provision.) Section 401(e) of AEDPA repealedthis narrow exception, and there is no doubt what the repeal was thought to accomplish: the provision was entitled"

Elimination of Custody Review by Habeas Corpus."110 Stat. 1268. It gave universal preclusive effect to the

"sole and exclusive procedure" language of $ 1105a(a). Andit is this regime that IIRIRA has carried forward.

The Court's efforts to derive ambiguity from this utmostclarity are unconvincing. First, the Court argues that

$$ 1252(a)(2)(C) and 1252(b)(9) are not as clear as one mightthink--that, even though they are sufficient to repeal the
jurisdiction of the courts of appeals, see Calcano-Martinezv.

ti nc t meani ngs, " an te, at 311, 312, n. 35. Of course$ 1252(a)(2)(C) does not even

use the term "judicial review"
(it says "jurisdiction to review")--but let us make believeit does. The Court's contention that in

this statute it does
not include habeas corpus is decisively refuted by the lan-guage of $ 1252(e)(2), enacted along with $$ 1252(a)(2)(C) and

1252(b)(9): "Judicial review of any determination made
under section 1225(b)(1) of this title [governing review ofexpedited removal orders against undocumented aliens arriving at the border] is available in habeas corpus pro-ceedings . . . ." (Emphases added.) It is hard to imagine
how Congress could have made it any clearer that, when
it used the term "judicial review" in IIRIRA, it included
judicial review through habeas corpus. Research into the
"historical" usage of the term "judicial review" is thus quite
beside the point.

But the Court is demonstrably wrong about that as well.
Before IIRIRA was enacted, from 1961 to 1996, the governing immigration statutes unquestionably treated "judicial
review" as encompassing review by habeas corpus. As discussed earlier, 8 U. S. C. $ 1105a (1994 ed.) made Hobbs Act
review "the sole and exclusive procedure for, the judicial
review of all final orders of deportation" (emphasis added),
but created (in subsection (a)(10)) a limited exception for
habeas corpus review. Section 1105a was entitled "Judicial
review of orders of deportation and exclusion" (emphasis
added), and the exception for habeas corpus stated that "any
alien held in custody pursuant to an order of deportation
may obtain judicial review thereof by habeas corpus proceedings," $ 1105a(a)(10) (emphases added). Apart from this
prior statutory usage, many of our own immigration cases
belie the Court's suggestion that the term "judicial review,"
when used in the immigration context, does not include
review by habeas corpus. See, e. g., United States v.
Mendoza-Lopez, 481 U. S. 828, 836-837 (1987) ("[A]ny alien

U. S. 48, 52 (1955) ("Our holding is that there is a right ofjudicial review of deportation orders other than by habeas
corpus . . ." (emphases added)); see also id., at 49.The only support the Court offers in support of the asserted "longstanding distinction between `judicial review'and `habeas,' "

ante, at 312, n. 35, is language from a singleopinion of this Court, Heikkila v. Barber, 345 U. S. 229

(1953).2 There, we "differentiate[d]" "habeas corpus" from"judicial review as that term is used in the Administrative Procedure Act." Id., at 236 (emphasis added). Butthat simply asserts that habeas corpus review is different
from ordinary APA review, which no one doubts. It doesnot assert that habeas corpus review is not judicial review
at all. Nowhere does Heikkila make such an implausiblecontention.

2 The recent Circuit authorities cited by the Court, which postdate
IIRIRA, see Mahadeo v. Reno, 226 F. 3d 3, 12 (CA1 2000); and FloresMiramontes v. INS, 212 F. 3d 1133, 1140 (CA9 2000)), cited ante, at 314,
hardly demonstrate any historical usage upon which IIRIRA was based.
Anyway, these cases rely for their analysis upon a third Court of Appeals
decision--Sandoval v. Reno, 166 F. 3d 225, 235 (CA3 1999)--which simply
relies on the passage from Heikkila under discussion.

3 The older, pre-1961 judicial interpretations relied upon by the Court,

see ante, at 312, are similarly unavailing. Ekiu v. United States, 142
U. S. 651 (1892), never purported to distinguish "judicial review" from
habeas, and the Court's attempt to extract such a distinction from the
opinion is unpersuasive. Ekiu did state that the statute "prevent[ed]
the question of an alien immigrant's right to land, when once decided
adversely by an inspector, acting within the jurisdiction conferred upon
him, from being impeached or reviewed," id., at 663 (emphasis added; italicized words quoted ante, at 312); but the clear implication was that the
question whether the inspector was "acting within the jurisdiction conferred upon him" was reviewable. The distinction pertained, in short, to
the scope of judicial review on habeas--not to whether judicial review was
available. Terlinden v. Ames, 184 U. S. 270, 278 (1902), likewise drew no
distinction between "judicial review" and habeas; it simply stated that the
extradition statute "gives no right of review to be exercised by any court

The Cour t next contends that the zi pper clause,$ 1252(b)(9), "by its own terms, does not bar" $ 2241 districtcourt habeas review of removal orders, ante, at 313, becausethe opening sentence of subsection (b) states that "[w]ith respect to review of an order of removal under subsection(a)(1) of this section, the following requirements apply . . . ."
(Emphasis added.) But in the broad sense, $ 1252(b)(9) does"apply" "to review of an order of removal under subsection
(a)(1)," because it mandates that "review of all questions oflaw and fact . . . arising from any action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien from the United Statesunder this subchapter" must take place

in connectionwith such review. This is "application" enough--and to insist that subsection (b)(9) be given effect only within thereview of removal orders that takes place under subsection
(a)(1), is to render it meaningless. Moreover, other of thenumbered subparagraphs of subsection (b) make clear that
the introductory sentence does not at all operate as a limita-tion upon what follows. Subsection (b)(7) specifies the procedure by which "a defendant in a criminal proceeding"charged with failing to depart after being ordered to do so
may contest "the validity of [a removal] order" before trial;and subsection (b)(8) prescribes some of the prerogatives
and responsibilities of the Attorney General and the alienafter entry of a final removal order. These provisions have
no effect if they must apply (even in the broad sense thatsubsection (b)(9) can be said to apply) "to review of an order
of removal under subsection (a)(1)."Unquesti onably, unambiguously, and unmistakably,
IIRIRA expressly supersedes $ 2241's general provision forhabeas jurisdiction. The Court asserts that

Far from saying that habeas is not a form of judicial review, it says that
habeas is an indirect means of review.

ante, at 298. They do no such thing. Those cases simplyapplied the general principle--not unique to habeas--that
"[r]epeals by implication are not favored." Felker, supra, at660;

Yerger, supra, at 105. Felker held that a statute which
by its terms prohibited only further review by this Court
(or by an en banc court of appeals) of a court-of-appeals pan-el's " `grant or denial of . . . authorization . . . to file a second

or successive [habeas] application,' " 518 U. S., at 657 (quoting28 U. S. C. $ 2244(b)(3)(E) (1994 ed., Supp. II)), should not
be read to imply the repeal of this Court's separate and
distinct "authority [under 28 U. S. C. $ 2241 and 28 U. S. C.

$ 2254 (1994 ed. and Supp. V)] to hear habeas petitions filed
as original matters in this Court," 518 U. S., at 661. Yerger
held that an 1868 Act that by its terms "repeal[ed] only so
much of the act of 1867 as authorized appeals, or the exercise
of appellate jurisdiction by this court," should be read to
"reach no [further than] the act of 1867," and did not repeal
by implication the appellate jurisdiction conferred by the Judiciary Act of 1789 and other pre-1867 enactments. 8 Wall.,
at 105. In the present case, unlike in Felker and Yerger,
none of the statutory provisions relied upon--$ 1252(a)(2)(C),

$ 1252(b)(9), or 8 U. S. C. $ 1105a(a) (1994 ed.)--requires us to
imply from one statutory provision the repeal of another.
All by their terms prohibit the judicial review at issue in
this case.

The Cour t i nsists, however, that si nce " [n]either

or 28 U. S. C. $ 2241," "neither provision speaks with sufficient clarity to bar jurisdiction pursuant to the general habeas statute." Ante, at 312-313. Even in those areas of
our jurisprudence where we have adopted a "clear statement" rule (notably, the sovereign immunity cases to which
the Court adverts, ante, at 299, n. 10), clear statement has
never meant the kind of magic words demanded by the Court

today--explicit reference to habeas or to $ 2241--rather thanreference to "judicial review" in a statute that explicitly calls

habeas corpus a form of judicial review. In Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 467 (1991), we said:

"This [the Court's clear-statement requirement] doesnot mean that the [Age Discrimination in Employment]

Act must mention [state] judges explicitly, though itdoes not. Cf.

Dellmuth v. Muth, 491 U. S. 223, 233
(1989) (Scalia, J., concurring). Rather, it must be plainto anyone reading the Act that it covers judges."

In Gregory, as in United States v. Nordic Village, Inc., 503U. S. 30, 34-35 (1992), and

Atascadero State Hospital v.
Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234, 241, 246 (1985), we held that theclear-statement requirement was not met, not because there

was no explicit reference to the Eleventh Amendment, butbecause the statutory intent to eliminate state sovereign
immunity was not clear. For the reasons discussed above,the intent to eliminate habeas jurisdiction in the present case
is entirely clear, and that is all that is required.It has happened before--too frequently, alas--that courts
have distorted plain statutory text in order to produce a
"more sensible" result. The unique accomplishment of to-day's opinion is that the result it produces is as far removed

from what is sensible as its statutory construction is fromthe language of the text. One would have to study our statute books for a long time to come up with a more unlikelydisposition. By authorizing $ 2241 habeas review in the district court but foreclosing review in the court of appeals,see

Calcano-Martinez, post, at 351-352, the Court's interpretation routes all legal challenges to removal orders brought
by criminal aliens to the district court, to be adjudicated
under that court's $ 2241 habeas authority, which specifies
no time limits. After review by that court, criminal aliens
will presumably have an appeal as of right to the court of
appeals, and can then petition this Court for a writ of cer533US2 Unit: $U78 [11-05-02 18:53:21] PAGES PGT: OPLG

tiorari. In contrast, noncriminal aliens seeking to challengetheir removal orders--for example, those charged with having been inadmissible at the time of entry, with having failedto maintain their nonimmigrant status, with having procured a visa through a marriage that was not bona fide, orwith having become, within five years after the date of entry,
a public charge, see 8 U. S. C. $$ 1227(a)(1)(A), (a)(1)(C),(a)(1)(G), (a)(5) (1994 ed., Supp. V)--will still presumably
be required to proceed directly to the court of appeals byway of petition for review, under the restrictive modified
Hobbs Act review provisions set forth in $ 1252(a)(1), includ-ing the 30-day filing deadline, see $ 1252(b)(1). In fact, prior
to the enactment of IIRIRA, criminal aliens also had to fol-low this procedure for immediate modified Hobbs Act review
in the court of appeals. See 8 U. S. C. $ 1105a(a) (1994 ed.).The Court has therefore succeeded in perverting a statutory scheme designed to expedite the removal of criminalaliens into one that now affords them

more opportunities for(and layers of) judicial review (and hence more opportunities

for delay) than are afforded non-criminal aliens--and morethan were afforded criminal aliens prior to the enactment of
IIRIRA.4 This outcome speaks for itself; no Congress everimagined it.

To excuse the violence it does to the statutory text, theCourt invokes the doctrine of constitutional doubt, which
it asserts is raised by the Suspension Clause, U. S. Const.,Art. I, $ 9, cl. 2. This uses one distortion to justify another,
transmogrifying a doctrine designed to maintain "a just re4 The Court disputes this conclusion by observing that "the scope of
review on habeas is considerably more limited than on APA-style review,"
ante, at 314, n. 38 (a statement, by the way, that confirms our contention
that habeas is, along with the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), one
form of judicial review). It is more limited, to be sure--but not "considerably more limited" in any respect that would disprove the fact that
criminal aliens are much better off than others. In all the many cases
that (like the present one) involve "question[s] of law," ibid., the Court's
statutory misconstruction gives criminal aliens a preferred position.

spect for the legislature," Ex parte Randolph, 20 F. Cas.
242, 254 (No. 11,558) (CC Va. 1833) (Marshall, C. J., on circuit), into a means of thwarting the clearly expressed intent
of the legislature. The doctrine of constitutional doubt is
meant to effectuate, not to subvert, congressional intent, by
giving ambiguous provisions a meaning that will avoid constitutional peril, and that will conform with Congress's presumed intent not to enact measures of dubious validity. The
condition precedent for application of the doctrine is that the
statute can reasonably be construed to avoid the constitutional difficulty. See, e. g., Miller v. French, 530 U. S. 327,
341 (2000) (" `We cannot press statutory construction "to the
point of disingenuous evasion" even to avoid a constitutional
question' " (quoting United States v. Locke, 471 U. S. 84, 96
(1985), in turn quoting George Moore Ice Cream Co. v. Rose,
289 U. S. 373, 379 (1933))); Salinas v. United States, 522 U. S.
52, 60 (1997) (quoting Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517
U. S. 44, 57, n. 9 (1996)). It is a device for interpreting what
the statute says--not for ignoring what the statute says
in order to avoid the trouble of determining whether what
it says is unconstitutional. For the reasons I have set forth
above, it is crystal clear that the statute before us here
bars criminal aliens from obtaining judicial review, including

$ 2241 district-court review, of their removal orders. It is
therefore also crystal clear that the doctrine of constitutional
doubt has no application.

In the remainder of this opinion I address the question
the Court should have addressed: Whether these provisions
of IIRIRA are unconstitutional.

A

The Suspension Clause of the Constitution, Art. I, $ 9, cl. 2,
provides as follows:

Scalia, J., dissenting
"The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall notbe suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it."
A straightforward reading of this text discloses that it doesnot guarantee any content to (or even the existence of) the

writ of habeas corpus, but merely provides that the writshall not (except in case of rebellion or invasion) be suspended. See R. Fallon, D. Meltzer, & D. Shapiro, Hart &Wechsler's The Federal Courts and the Federal System 1369
(4th ed. 1996) ("[T]he text [of the Suspension Clause] doesnot confer a right to habeas relief, but merely sets forth
when the `Privilege of the Writ' may be suspended"). In-deed, that was precisely the objection expressed by four
of the state ratifying conventions--that the Constitutionfailed affirmatively to guarantee a right to habeas corpus.
See Collings, Habeas Corpus for Convicts--ConstitutionalRight or Legislative Grace?, 40 Calif. L. Rev. 335, 340, and
nn. 39-41 (1952) (citing 1 J. Elliott, Debates on the FederalConstitution 328 (2d ed. 1836) (New York); 3 id., at 658 (Virginia); 4 id., at 243 (North Carolina); 1 id., at 334 (RhodeIsland)).

To "suspend" the writ was not to fail to enact it, muchless to refuse to accord it particular content. Noah Webster,
in his American Dictionary of the English Language, de-fined it--with patriotic allusion to the constitutional text--
as "[t]o cause to cease for a time from operation or effect; as,to

suspend the habeas corpus act." Vol. 2, p. 86 (1828 ed.).See also N. Bailey, An Universal Etymological English Dictionary (1789) ("To Suspend [in Law] signifies a temporalstop of a man's right"); 2 S. Johnson, A Dictionary of the
English Language 1958 (1773) ("to make to stop for a time").This was a distinct abuse of majority power, and one that
had manifested itself often in the Framers' experience: tem-porarily but entirely eliminating the "Privilege of the Writ"
for a certain geographic area or areas, or for a certain class

or classes of individuals. Suspension Acts had been adopted(and many more proposed) both in this country and in England during the late 18th century, see B. Mian, AmericanHabeas Corpus: Law, History, and Politics 109-127 (1984)--
including a 7-month suspension by the Massachusetts As-sembly during Shay's Rebellion in 1787,

id., at 117. Typical
of the genre was the prescription by the Statute of 1794,
34 Geo. 3, c. 54, $ 2, that " `[an Act for preventing wrongousimprisonment, and against undue delays in trials], insofar as

the same may be construed to relate to the cases of Treasonand suspicion of Treason, be suspended [for one year] . . . .' "
Mian, supra, at 110. See also 16 Annals of Cong. 44, 402-425
(1852) (recording the debate on a bill, reported to the House
of Representatives from the Senate on January 26, 1807, and
ultimately rejected, to "suspen[d], for and during the term
of three months," "the privilege of the writ of habeas
corpus" for "any person or persons, charged on oath with
treason, misprision of treason," and other specified offenses
arising out of the Aaron Burr conspiracy).

In the present case, of course, Congress has not temporarily withheld operation of the writ, but has permanently
altered its content. That is, to be sure, an act subject to
majoritarian abuse, as is Congress's framing (or its determination not to frame) a habeas statute in the first place. But
that is not the majoritarian abuse against which the Suspension Clause was directed. It is no more irrational to guard
against the common and well known "suspension" abuse,
without guaranteeing any particular habeas right that enjoys immunity from suspension, than it is, in the Equal Protection Clause, to guard against unequal application of the
laws, without guaranteeing any particular law which enjoys
that protection. And it is no more acceptable for this Court
to write a habeas law, in order that the Suspension Clause
might have some effect, than it would be for this Court to
write other laws, in order that the Equal Protection Clause
might have some effect.

The Court cites many cases which it says establish thatit is a "serious and difficult constitutional issue,"

ante, at 305,
whether the Suspension Clause prohibits the elimination ofhabeas jurisdiction effected by IIRIRA. Every one of those

cases, however, pertains not to the meaning of the Suspen-sion Clause, but to the content of the habeas corpus provision
of the United States Code, which is quite a different matter.
The closest the Court can come is a statement in one of thosecases to the effect that the Immigration Act of 1917 "had

the effect of precluding judicial intervention in deportationcases except insofar as it was required by the Constitution,"
Heikkila, 345 U. S., at 234-235. That statement (1) was
pure dictum, since the Court went on to hold that the judicial review of petitioner's deportation order was unavailable;
(2) does not specify to what extent judicial review was "required by the Constitution," which could (as far as the
Court's holding was concerned) be zero; and, most important
of all, (3) does not refer to the Suspension Clause, so could
well have had in mind the due process limitations upon the
procedures for determining deportability that our later cases
establish, see Part III, infra.

There is, however, another Supreme Court dictum that is
unquestionably in point--an unusually authoritative one at
that, since it was written by Chief Justice Marshall in 1807.
It supports precisely the interpretation of the Suspension
Clause I have set forth above. In Ex parte Bollman,
4 Cranch 75, one of the cases arising out of the Burr conspiracy, the issue presented was whether the Supreme Court
had the power to issue a writ of habeas corpus for the release of two prisoners held for trial under warrant of the
Circuit Court of the District of Columbia. Counsel for the
detainees asserted not only statutory authority for issuance
of the writ, but inherent power. See id., at 77-93. The
Court would have nothing to do with that, whether under
Article III or any other provision. While acknowledging
an inherent power of the courts "over their own officers, or

to protect themselves, and their members, from being dis-turbed in the exercise of their functions," Marshall says that

"the power of taking cognizance of any question betweenindividuals, or between the government and individuals,"

"must be given by written law."The inquiry, therefore, on this motion will be,
whether by any statute compatible with the constitu-tion of the United States, the power to award a writ of
habeas corpus, in such a case as that of Erick Bollmanand Samuel Swartwout, has been given to this court."
Id., at 94.
In the ensuing discussion of the Judiciary Act of 1789, theopinion specifically addresses the Suspension Clause--not

invoking it as a source of habeas jurisdiction, but to thecontrary pointing out that without

legislated habeas juris-diction the Suspension Clause would have no effect.

"It may be worthy of remark, that this act was passedby the first congress of the United States, sitting under
a constitution which had declared `that the privilege ofthe writ of

habeas corpus should not be suspended, un-less when, in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public

safety might require it.'"Acting under the immediate influence of this injunction, they must have felt, with peculiar force, the obli-gation of providing efficient means by which this great
constitutional privilege should receive life and activity;for if the means be not in existence, the privilege itself
would be lost, although no law for its suspension shouldbe enacted. Under the impression of this obligation,
they give to all the courts the power of awarding writsof

habeas corpus." Id., at 95.5

5 The Court claims that I "rea[d] into Chief Justice Marshall's opinion
in Ex parte Bollman . . . support for a proposition that the Chief Justice
did not endorse, either explicitly or implicitly," ante, at 304, n. 24. Its
support for this claim is a highly selective quotation from the opinion,

Scalia, J., dissenting
There is no more reason for us to believe, than there wasfor the Marshall Court to believe, that the Suspension Clause

means anything other than what it says.

B
Even if one were to assume that the Suspension Clause,despite its text and the Marshall Court's understanding,

guarantees some constitutional minimum of habeas relief,that minimum would assuredly not embrace the rarified
right asserted here: the right to judicial compulsion of theexercise of Executive discretion (which may be exercised
favorably or unfavorably) regarding a prisoner's release. Ifone reads the Suspension Clause as a guarantee of habeas
relief, the obvious question presented is: What habeas relief?There are only two alternatives, the first of which is too
absurd to be seriously entertained. It could be contendedthat Congress "suspends" the writ whenever it eliminates
any prior ground for the writ that it adopted. Thus, ifCongress should ever (in the view of this Court) have authorized immediate habeas corpus--without the need toexhaust administrative remedies--for a person arrested as
an illegal alien, Congress would never be able (in the lightof sad experience) to revise that disposition. The Suspensee ibid. There is nothing "implici[t]" whatsoever about Chief Justice
Marshall's categorical statement that "the power to award the writ [of
habeas corpus] by any of the courts of the United States, must be given
by written law," 4 Cranch, at 94. See also ibid., quoted supra, at 340
("[T]he power of taking cognizance of any question between individuals,
or between the government and individuals . . . must be given by written
law"). If, as the Court concedes, "the writ could not be suspended," ante,
at 304, n. 24, within the meaning of the Suspension Clause until Congress
affirmatively provided for habeas by statute, then surely Congress may
subsequently alter what it had initially provided for, lest the Clause become a one-way ratchet, see infra this page and 342. The Court's position
that a permanent repeal of habeas jurisdiction is unthinkable (and hence
a violation of the Suspension Clause) is simply incompatible with its (and
Marshall's) belief that a failure to confer habeas jurisdiction is not
unthinkable.

sion Clause, in other words, would be a one-way ratchetthat enshrines in the Constitution every grant of habeas

jurisdiction. This is, as I say, too absurd to be contem-plated, and I shall contemplate it no further.

The other alternative is that the Suspension Clause guar-antees the common-law right of habeas corpus, as it was
understood when the Constitution was ratified. There is no
doubt whatever that this did not include the right to obtaindiscretionary release. The Court notes with apparent credulity respondent's contention "that there is historical evi-dence of the writ issuing to redress the improper exercise of
official discretion," ante, at 303-304. The only framing-era
or earlier cases it alludes to in support of that contention,
see ante, at 303, n. 23, referred to ante, at 303-304, establish
no such thing. In Ex parte Boggin, 13 East 549, 104 Eng.
Rep. 484 (K. B. 1811), the court did not even bother calling
for a response from the custodian, where the applicant failed
to show that he was statutorily exempt from impressment
under any statute then in force. In Chalacombe's Case, reported in a footnote in Ex parte Boggin, the court did "let
the writ go"--i. e., called for a response from the Admiralty
to Chalacombe's petition--even though counsel for the Admiralty had argued that the Admiralty's general policy of not
impressing "seafaring persons of [Chalacombe's] description"
was "a matter of grace and favour, [and not] of right." But
the court never decided that it had authority to grant the
relief requested (since the Admiralty promptly discharged
Chalacombe of its own accord); in fact, it expressed doubt
whether it had that authority. See 13 East, at 550, n. (b),
104 Eng. Rep., at 484, n. (a)2 (Lord Ellenborough, C. J.)
("[C]onsidering it merely as a question of discretion, is it not
more fit that this should stand over for the consideration of
the Admiralty, to whom the matter ought to be disclosed?").
And in Hollingshead's Case, 1 Salkeld 351, 91 Eng. Rep. 307
(K. B. 1702), the "warrant of commitment" issued by the
"commissioners of bankrupt" was "held naught," since it au533US2 Unit: $U78 [11-05-02 18:53:21] PAGES PGT: OPLG

Scalia, J., dissenting
thorized the bankrupt's continued detention by the commis-sioners until "otherwise discharged by due course of law,"

whereas the statute authorized commitment only "till [thebankrupt] submit himself to be examined by the commissioners." (Emphasis deleted.) There is nothing pertainingto executive discretion here.

All the other framing-era or earlier cases cited in the
Court's opinion--indeed, all the later Supreme Court cases
until United States ex rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy, 347 U. S.
260, in 1954--provide habeas relief from executive detentiononly when the custodian had no legal authority to detain.

See 3 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the
United States $ 1333, p. 206 (1833) (the writ lies to ascertain
whether a "sufficient ground of detention appears"). The
fact is that, far from forming a traditional basis for issuance
of the writ of habeas corpus, the whole "concept of `discretion' was not well developed at common law," Hafetz,
The Untold Story of Noncriminal Habeas Corpus and the
1996 Immigration Acts, 107 Yale L. J. 2509, 2534 (1998),
quoted in Brief for Respondent in Calcano-Martinez v. INS,
O. T. 2000, No. 00-1011, p. 37. An exhaustive search of cases
antedating the Suspension Clause discloses few instances in
which courts even discussed the concept of executive discretion; and on the rare occasions when they did, they
simply confirmed what seems obvious from the paucity of
such discussions--namely, that courts understood executive
discretion as lying entirely beyond the judicial ken. See,
e. g., Chalacombe's Case, supra, at 342. That is precisely
what one would expect, since even the executive's evaluation of the facts--a duty that was a good deal more than
discretionary--was not subject to review on habeas. Both
in this country, until passage of the Habeas Corpus Act of
1867, and in England, the longstanding rule had been that
the truth of the custodian's return could not be controverted.
See, e. g., Opinion on the Writ of Habeas Corpus, Wilm. 77,
107, 97 Eng. Rep. 29, 43 (H. L. 1758); Note, Developments in

the Law--Federal Habeas Corpus, 83 Harv. L. Rev. 1038,
1113-1114, and nn. 9-11 (1970) (quoting Act of Feb. 5, 1867,
ch. 28, $ 1, 14 Stat. 385); Oaks, Legal History in the High
Court--Habeas Corpus, 64 Mich. L. Rev. 451, 453 (1966).
And, of course, going beyond inquiry into the legal authority
of the executive to detain would have been utterly incompatible with the well-established limitation upon habeas relief
for a convicted prisoner: "[O]nce a person had been convicted
by a superior court of general jurisdiction, a court disposing
of a habeas corpus petition could not go behind the conviction
for any purpose other than to verify the formal jurisdiction
of the committing court." Id., at 468, quoted in Swain v.
Pressley, 430 U. S. 372, 384-385 (1977) (Burger, C. J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).

In sum, there is no authority whatever for the proposition
that, at the time the Suspension Clause was ratified--or, for
that matter, even for a century and a half thereafter--habeas
corpus relief was available to compel the Executive's allegedly wrongful refusal to exercise discretion. The striking
proof of that proposition is that when, in 1954, the Warren
Court held that the Attorney General's alleged refusal to
exercise his discretion under the Immigration Act of 1917
could be reviewed on habeas, see United States ex rel.
Accardi v. Shaughnessy, supra, it did so without citation of
any supporting authority, and over the dissent of Justice
Jackson, joined by three other Justices, who wrote:

"Of course, it may be thought that it would be better
government if even executive acts of grace were subject
to judicial review. But the process of the Court seems
adapted only to the determination of legal rights, and
here the decision is thrusting upon the courts the task of
reviewing a discretionary and purely executive function.
Habeas corpus, like the currency, can be debased by
over-issue quite as certainly as by too niggardly use.
We would . . . leave the responsibility for suspension or

III
Given the insubstantiality of the due process and Arti-cle III arguments against barring judicial review of respondent's claim (the Court does not even bother to mentionthem, and the Court of Appeals barely acknowledges them),
I will address them only briefly.The Due Process Clause does not "[r]equir[e] [ j]udicial

Calcano-Martinez v. INS, O. T. 2000, No. 00-1011, p. 34.Respondent has no legal entitlement to suspension of deportation, no matter how appealing his case. "[T]he Attor-ney General's suspension of deportation [is] "an act of grace"
which is accorded pursuant to her `unfettered discretion,'Jay v. Boyd, 351 U. S. 345, 354 (1956) . . . , and [can be likened,

to pardon a convict," 351 U. S., at 354, n. 16 . . . ." INS v.Yueh-Shaio Yang, 519 U. S. 26, 30 (1996). The furthest our
cases have gone in imposing due process requirements uponanalogous exercises of Executive discretion is the following.
(1) We have required "minimal procedural safeguards" fordeath-penalty clemency proceedings, to prevent them from
becoming so capricious as to involve "a state official flipp[ing]a coin to determine whether to grant clemency,"

"death-is-different" jurisprudence, Shafer v. South Carolina,532 U. S. 36, 55 (2001) (

a State's statutory parole procedures prescribe that a pris-oner "shall" be paroled if certain conditions are satisfied, see

Board of Pardons v. Allen, 482 U. S. 369, 370-371, 381 (1987);Greenholtz v. Inmates of Neb. Penal and Correctional Complex, 442 U. S. 1, 12 (1979). There is no such statutoryentitlement to suspension of deportation, no matter what
the facts. Moreover, in neither Woodard, nor Allen, nor
Greenholtz did we intimate that the Due Process Clauseconferred jurisdiction of its own force, without benefit of

statutory authorization. All three cases were broughtunder 42 U. S. C. $ 1983.

Article III, $ 1's investment of the "judicial Power of theUnited States" in the federal courts does not prevent Congress from committing the adjudication of respondent's legalclaim wholly to "non-Article III federal adjudicative bodies,"
Brief for Petitioners in Calcano-Martinez v. INS, O. T. 2000,No. 00-1011, at 38. The notion that Article III requires
every Executive determination, on a question of law or offact, to be subject to judicial review has no support in our
jurisprudence. Were it correct, the doctrine of sovereignimmunity would not exist, and the APA's general permission
of suits challenging administrative action, see 5 U. S. C. $ 702,would have been superfluous. Of its own force, Article III
does no more than commit to the courts matters that are"the stuff of the traditional actions at common law tried
by the courts at Westminster in 1789," Northern Pipeline
Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U. S. 50, 90(1982) (

CALCANO-MARTINEZ et al. v. IMMIGRATION ANDNATURALIZATION SERVICE
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe second circuit

No. 00-1011. Argued April 24, 2001--Decided June 25, 2001
Petitioners are lawful permanent United States residents subject to administratively final removal orders because they were convicted of aggravated felonies. Each filed a petition for review in the Second Circuit pursuant to 8 U. S. C. $ 1252(a)(1) and a habeas corpus petition in
the District Court pursuant to 28 U. S. C. $ 2241 in order to challenge
the Board of Immigration Appeals' determination that, as a matter
of law, they were ineligible to apply for a discretionary waiver of deportation under former $ 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.
The Second Circuit dismissed their petitions for lack of jurisdiction,
holding that they could nevertheless pursue their claims in a $ 2241
action in district court.

Held: The Second Circuit lacked jurisdiction to hear the petitions for

direct review, but petitioners can proceed with their habeas petitions
if they wish to obtain relief. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 expressly precludes courts of appeals
from exercising jurisdiction to review a final removal order against an
alien removable by reason of a conviction for, inter alia, an aggravated
felony. 8 U. S. C. $ 1252(a)(2)(C). This plain language explicitly strips
the courts of appeals of the ability to hear petitioners' claims on direct
review. However, because Congress has not spoken with sufficient clarity to strip the district courts of jurisdiction to hear habeas petitions
raising identical claims, see INS v. St. Cyr, ante, at 314, petitioners may
pursue their claims in a $ 2241 action. Pp. 350-352.

232 F. 3d 328, affirmed.

the Board of Immigration Appeals' determination that, asa matter of law, petitioners were ineligible to apply for a
discretionary waiver of deportation under former $ 212(c) ofthe Immigration and Nationality Act, 66 Stat. 182, 8 U. S. C.

the petitions for lack of jurisdiction, holding that petitionerscould nevertheless pursue their constitutional and statutory
claims in a district court habeas action brought pursuant to

350 CALCANO-MARTINEZ v. INS

Opinion of the Court
the petitions for direct review at issue in this case and that
petitioners must, therefore, proceed with their petitions for
habeas corpus if they wish to obtain relief.

As part of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant
Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), 110 Stat. 3009-546,
Congress adopted new provisions governing the judicial review of immigration orders. See 8 U. S. C. $ 1252 (1994 ed.,
Supp. V) (codifying these procedures). Like the prior statute, the new provision vests the courts of appeals with the
authority to consider petitions challenging "final orders"
commanding the "removal" of aliens from the United States.

$ 1252(a)(1).1 However, unlike the previous provisions, the
new statute expressly precludes the courts of appeals from
exercising "jurisdiction to review any final order of removal
against any alien who is removable by reason of " a conviction for certain criminal offenses, including any aggravated
felony. $ 1252(a)(2)(C).2

1 An additional difference between the old and the new statute with
regard to petitions for review is one of nomenclature. In keeping with
a statute-wide change in terminology, the new provision refers to orders
of "removal" rather than orders of "deportation" or "exclusion." Compare 8 U. S. C. $ 1252(a)(1) (1994 ed., Supp. V), with $ 1105a (1994 ed.).

2 The scope of this preclusion is not entirely clear. Though the text of

the provision is quite broad, it is not without its ambiguities. Throughout
this litigation, the Government has conceded that the courts of appeals
have the power to hear petitions challenging the factual determinations
thought to trigger the jurisdiction-stripping provision (such as whether
an individual is an alien and whether he or she has been convicted of an
"aggravated felony" within the meaning of the statute). See Brief for
Respondent 22-23. In addition, the Government has also conceded that
the courts of appeals retain jurisdiction to review "substantial constitutional challenges" raised by aliens who come within the strictures
of $ 1252(a)(2)(C). See id., at 23-24. As the petitions in this case do
not raise any of these types of issues, we need not address this point
further. Nonetheless, it remains instructive that the Government acknowledges that background principles of statutory construction and
constitutional concerns must be considered in determining the scope of
IIRIRA's jurisdiction-stripping provisions.

Opinion of the Court
As petitioners in this case were convicted of "aggravatedfelonies" within the meaning of the relevant statutes,

3 the

plain language of $ 1252(a)(2)(C) fairly explicitly strips thecourts of appeals of jurisdiction to hear their claims on petitions for direct review. Without much discussion, the Courtof Appeals so held. 232 F. 3d, at 342-343.

Before this Court, petitioners primarily argue that con-stitutional considerations and background principles of statutory interpretation require that they be afforded someforum for the adjudication of the merits of their claims.
They devote the bulk of their briefs to arguing that theCourt of Appeals--motivated by these concerns--properly
interpreted IIRIRA's jurisdiction-stripping provision notto preclude aliens such as petitioners from pursuing habeas
relief pursuant to 28 U. S. C. $ 2241. Brief for Petitioners12-42, 44-49. In the alternative, they argue that we might
construe the same provisions as stripping jurisdiction fromthe courts of appeals over only some matters, leaving in
place their jurisdiction to directly review petitions raisingclaims previously cognizable under $ 2241. Id., at 42-44.

We agree with petitioners that leaving aliens without aforum for adjudicating claims such as those raised in this
case would raise serious constitutional questions. We alsoagree with petitioners--and the Court of Appeals--that
these concerns can best be alleviated by construing thejurisdiction-stripping provisions of that statute not to preclude aliens such as petitioners from pursuing habeas reliefpursuant to $ 2241. See St. Cyr, ante, at 314.

Finding no support in the text or history of $ 1252 for con-cluding that the courts of appeals retain jurisdiction to hear
petitions such as those brought in this case, but concluding

3 All three petitioners were convicted of controlled substance offenses
for which they served between four months and four years in prison.
Each concedes that his or her crime is an "aggravated felony" as defined
in 8 U. S. C. $ 1101(a)(43), which renders him or her removable pursuant
to $ 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii).

NEVADA et al. v. HICKS et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 99-1994. Argued March 21, 2001--Decided June 25, 2001
Respondent Hicks is a member of the Fallon Paiute-Shoshone Tribes of

western Nevada and lives on the Tribes' reservation. After petitioner
state game wardens executed state-court and tribal-court search warrants to search Hicks's home for evidence of an off-reservation crime,
he filed suit in the Tribal Court against, inter alios, the wardens in their
individual capacities and petitioner Nevada, alleging trespass, abuse
of process, and violation of constitutional rights remediable under 42
U. S. C. $ 1983. The Tribal Court held that it had jurisdiction over the
tribal tort and federal civil rights claims, and the Tribal Appeals Court
affirmed. Petitioners then sought, in Federal District Court, a declaratory judgment that the Tribal Court lacked jurisdiction over the claims.
The District Court granted respondents summary judgment on that
issue and held that the wardens would have to exhaust their qualified
immunity claims in the Tribal Court. In affirming, the Ninth Circuit
concluded that the fact that Hicks's home is on tribe-owned reservation
land is sufficient to support tribal jurisdiction over civil claims against
nonmembers arising from their activities on that land.

Held:

1. The Tribal Court did not have jurisdiction to adjudicate the wardens' alleged tortious conduct in executing a search warrant for an offreservation crime. Pp. 357-366.

(a) As to nonmembers, a tribal court's inherent adjudicatory authority is at most as broad as the tribe's regulatory authority. Strate
v. A-1 Contractors, 520 U. S. 438, 453. Pp. 357-358.

(b) The rule that, where nonmembers are concerned, "the exercise of tribal power beyond what is necessary to protect tribal selfgovernment or to control internal relations . . . cannot survive without
express congressional delegation," Montana v. United States, 450 U. S.
544, 564, applies to both Indian and non-Indian land. The land's ownership status is only one factor to be considered, and while that factor
may sometimes be dispositive, tribal ownership is not alone enough to
support regulatory jurisdiction over nonmembers. Pp. 358-360.

(c) Tribal authority to regulate state officers in executing process
related to the off-reservation violation of state laws is not essential to
tribal self-government or internal relations. The State's interest in

executing process is considerable, and it no more impairs the Tribes'
self-government than federal enforcement of federal law impairs state
government. The State's interest is not diminished because this suit
is against officials in their individual capacities. Pp. 360-365.

(d) Congress has not stripped the States of their inherent jurisdiction on reservations with regard to off-reservation violations of state
law. The federal statutory scheme neither prescribes nor suggests that
state officers cannot enter a reservation to investigate or prosecute such
violations. Pp. 365-366.

2. The Tribal Court had no jurisdiction over the $ 1983 claims.
Tribal courts are not courts of "general jurisdiction." The historical
and constitutional assumption of concurrent state-court jurisdiction
over cases involving federal statutes is missing with respect to tribal
courts, and their inherent adjudicative jurisdiction over nonmembers
is at most only as broad as their legislative jurisdiction. Congress has
not purported to grant tribal courts jurisdiction over $ 1983 claims,
and such jurisdiction would create serious anomalies under 28 U. S. C.

$ 1441. Pp. 366-369.

3. Petitioners were not required to exhaust their claims in the Tribal
Court before bringing them in the Federal District Court. Because the
rule that tribal courts lack jurisdiction over state officials for causes of
action relating to their performance of official duties is clear, adherence
to the tribal exhaustion requirement would serve no purpose other than
delay and is therefore unnecessary. P. 369.

4. Various arguments to the contrary lack merit. Pp. 370-375.

sides on the Tribes' reservation of approximately 8,000 acres,established by federal statute in 1908, ch. 53, 35 Stat. 85.

In 1990 Hicks came under suspicion of having killed, offthe reservation, a California bighorn sheep, a gross misdemeanor under Nevada law, see Nev. Rev. Stat. $ 501.376(1999). A state game warden obtained from state court a
search warrant "SUBJECT TO OBTAINING APPROVAL
FROM THE FALLON TRIBAL COURT IN AND FORTHE FALLON PAIUTE-SHOSHONE TRIBES." According to the issuing judge, this tribal-court authorization wasnecessary because "[t]his Court has no jurisdiction on the
Fallon Paiute-Shoshone Indian Reservation." App. G to
Pet. for Cert. 1. A search warrant was obtained from the
tribal court, and the warden, accompanied by a tribal police
officer, searched respondent's yard, uncovering only the head
of a Rocky Mountain bighorn, a different (and unprotected)
species of sheep.

Approximately one year later, a tribal police officer reported to the warden that he had observed two mounted bighorn sheep heads in respondent's home. The warden again
obtained a search warrant from state court; though this
warrant did not explicitly require permission from the
Tribes, see App. F to Pet. for Cert. 2, a tribal-court warrant
was nonetheless secured, and respondent's home was again
(unsuccessfully) searched by three wardens and additional
tribal officers.

Respondent, claiming that his sheep heads had been damaged, and that the second search exceeded the bounds of the
warrant, brought suit against the Tribal Judge, the tribal
officers, the state wardens in their individual and official
capacities, and the State of Nevada in the Tribal Court in and
for the Fallon Paiute-Shoshone Tribes. (His claims against
all defendants except the state wardens and the State of
Nevada were dismissed by directed verdict and are not at
issue here.) Respondent's causes of action included trespass
to land and chattels, abuse of process, and violation of civil

rights--specifically, denial of equal protection, denial of due
process, and unreasonable search and seizure, each remediable under Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983. See App.
8-21, 25-29. Respondent later voluntarily dismissed his
case against the State and against the state officials in their
official capacities, leaving only his suit against those officials
in their individual capacities. See id., at 32-35.

The Tribal Court held that it had jurisdiction over the
claims, a holding affirmed by the Tribal Appeals Court. The
state officials and Nevada then filed an action in Federal District Court seeking a declaratory judgment that the Tribal
Court lacked jurisdiction. The District Court granted summary judgment to respondent on the issue of jurisdiction,
and also held that the state officials would have to exhaust
any claims of qualified immunity in the tribal court. The
Ninth Circuit affirmed, concluding that the fact that respondent's home is located on tribe-owned land within the reservation is sufficient to support tribal jurisdiction over civil
claims against nonmembers arising from their activities on
that land. 196 F. 3d 1020 (1999). We granted certiorari,
531 U. S. 923 (2000).

II

In this case, which involves claims brought under both
tribal and federal law, it is necessary to determine, as to
the former, whether the Tribal Court in and for the Fallon
Paiute-Shoshone Tribes has jurisdiction to adjudicate the
alleged tortious conduct of state wardens executing a search
warrant for evidence of an off-reservation crime; and, as to
the latter, whether the Tribal Court has jurisdiction over
claims brought under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983. We address the former question first.

A

The principle of Indian law central to this aspect of the
case is our holding in Strate v. A-1 Contractors, 520 U. S.
438, 453 (1997): "As to nonmembers . . . a tribe's adjudicative

533US2 Unit: $U80 [11-01-02 19:17:06] PAGES PGT: OPIN
358 NEVADA v. HICKS

Opinion of the Court
jurisdiction does not exceed its legislative jurisdiction . . . ."That formulation leaves open the question whether a tribe's

adjudicative jurisdiction over nonmember defendants equalsits legislative jurisdiction.

2 We will not have to answer that

open question if we determine that the Tribes in any eventlack legislative jurisdiction in this case. We first inquire,

therefore, whether the Fallon Paiute-Shoshone Tribes--either as an exercise of their inherent sovereignty, or under
grant of federal authority--can regulate state wardens exe-cuting a search warrant for evidence of an off-reservation
crime.Indian tribes' regulatory authority over nonmembers is
governed by the principles set forth in Montana v. United
States, 450 U. S. 544 (1981), which we have called the "path-marking case" on the subject, Strate, supra, at 445. In deciding whether the Crow Tribe could regulate hunting andfishing by nonmembers on land held in fee simple by nonmembers, Montana observed that, under our decision in
Oliphant v. Suquamish Tribe, 435 U. S. 191 (1978), tribeslack criminal jurisdiction over nonmembers. Although, it

continued, "Oliphant only determined inherent tribal au-thority in criminal matters, the principles on which it relied
support the general proposition that the inherent sovereign

2 In National Farmers Union Ins. Cos. v. Crow Tribe, 471 U. S. 845,
855-856 (1985), we avoided the question whether tribes may generally
adjudicate against nonmembers claims arising from on-reservation transactions, and we have never held that a tribal court had jurisdiction over a
nonmember defendant. Typically, our cases have involved claims brought
against tribal defendants. See, e. g., Williams v. Lee, 358 U. S. 217 (1959).
In Strate v. A-1 Contractors, 520 U. S. 438, 453 (1997), however, we assumed that "where tribes possess authority to regulate the activities of
nonmembers, civil jurisdiction over disputes arising out of such activities
presumably lies in the tribal courts," without distinguishing between nonmember plaintiffs and nonmember defendants. See also Iowa Mut. Ins.
Co. v. LaPlante, 480 U. S. 9, 18 (1987). Our holding in this case is limited
to the question of tribal-court jurisdiction over state officers enforcing
state law. We leave open the question of tribal-court jurisdiction over
nonmember defendants in general.

powers of an Indian tribe do not extend to the activitiesof nonmembers of the tribe." 450 U. S., at 565 (footnote

omitted). Where nonmembers are concerned, the "exerciseof tribal power beyond what is necessary to protect tribal
self-government or to control internal relations is incon-sistent with the dependent status of the tribes, and so cannot
survive without express congressional delegation." Id., at564 (emphasis added).

3

Both Montana and Strate rejected tribal authority to reg-ulate nonmembers' activities on land over which the tribe

could not "assert a landowner's right to occupy and exclude,"
Strate, supra, at 456; Montana, supra, at 557, 564. Re-spondents and the United States argue that since Hicks's

home and yard are on tribe-owned land within the reserva-tion, the Tribe may make its exercise of regulatory authority
over nonmembers a condition of nonmembers' entry. Notnecessarily. While it is certainly true that the non-Indian
ownership status of the land was central to the analysis inboth

Montana and Strate, the reason that was so was notthat Indian ownership suspends the "general proposition"

derived from Oliphant that "the inherent sovereign powersof an Indian tribe do not extend to the activities of nonmembers of the tribe" except to the extent "necessary toprotect tribal self-government or to control internal relations." 450 U. S., at 564-565. Oliphant itself drew no dis-tinctions based on the status of land. And Montana, after
announcing the general rule of no jurisdiction over non3 Montana recognized an exception to this rule for tribal regulation
of "the activities of nonmembers who enter consensual relationships
with the tribe or its members, through commercial dealing, contracts,
leases, or other arrangements." 450 U. S., at 565. Though the wardens
in this case "consensually" obtained a warrant from the Tribal Court before searching respondent's home and yard, we do not think this qualifies
as an "other arrangement" within the meaning of this passage. Read in
context, an "other arrangement" is clearly another private consensual
relationship, from which the official actions at issue in this case are far
removed.

Opinion of the Court
members, cautioned that "[t]o be sure, Indian tribes retaininherent sovereign power to exercise some forms of civil

jurisdiction over non-Indians on their reservations, evenon non-Indian fee lands," 450 U. S., at 565--clearly implying
that the general rule of Montana applies to both Indianand non-Indian land. The ownership status of land, in other
words, is only one factor to consider in determining whetherregulation of the activities of nonmembers is "necessary to
protect tribal self-government or to control internal rela-tions." It may sometimes be a dispositive factor. Hitherto,
the absence of tribal ownership has been virtually conclusiveof the absence of tribal civil jurisdiction; with one minor exception, we have never upheld under Montana the extensionof tribal civil authority over nonmembers on non-Indian land.
Compare, e. g., Merrion v. Jicarilla Apache Tribe, 455 U. S.130, 137, 142 (1982) (tribe has taxing authority over tribal
lands leased by nonmembers), with Atkinson Trading Co. v.
Shirley, 532 U. S. 645, 659 (2001) (tribe has no taxing author-ity over nonmembers' activities on land held by nonmembers

in fee); but see Brendale v. Confederated Tribes and Bands
of Yakima Nation, 492 U. S. 408, 443-444, 458-459 (1989)(opinions of

Stevens, J., and Blackmun, J.) (tribe can imposezoning regulation on that 3.1% of land within reservation

area closed to public entry that was not owned by the tribe).But the existence of tribal ownership is not alone enough to
support regulatory jurisdiction over nonmembers.We proceed to consider, successively, the following questions: whether regulatory jurisdiction over state officers inthe present context is "necessary to protect tribal selfgovernment or to control internal relations," and, if not,whether such regulatory jurisdiction has been congressionally conferred. B

In Strate, we explained that what is necessary to protecttribal self-government and control internal relations can be
understood by looking at the examples of tribal power to

which Montana referred: tribes have authority "[to punishtribal offenders,] to determine tribal membership, to regulate domestic relations among members, and to prescriberules of inheritance for members," 520 U. S., at 459 (brackets
in original), quoting Montana, supra, at 564. These exam-ples show, we said, that Indians have " `the right . . . to make
their own laws and be ruled by them,' " 520 U. S., at 459,quoting

Williams v. Lee, 358 U. S. 217, 220 (1959). See alsoFisher v. District Court of Sixteenth Judicial Dist. of Mont.,

424 U. S. 382, 386 (1976) (per curiam) ("In litigation betweenIndians and non-Indians arising out of conduct on an Indian
reservation, resolution of conflicts between the jurisdictionof state and tribal courts has depended, absent a governing Act of Congress, on whether the state action infringedon the right of reservation Indians to make their own laws
and be ruled by them" (internal quotation marks and citationomitted)). Tribal assertion of regulatory authority over
nonmembers must be connected to that right of the Indiansto make their own laws and be governed by them. See

Mer-rion, supra, at 137, 142 ("The power to tax is an essential

attribute of Indian sovereignty because it is a necessary in-strument of self-government," at least as to "tribal lands"
on which the tribe "has . . . authority over a nonmember").Our cases make clear that the Indians' right to make their
own laws and be governed by them does not exclude all stateregulatory authority on the reservation. State sovereignty
does not end at a reservation's border. Though tribes areoften referred to as "sovereign" entities, it was "long ago"
that "the Court departed from Chief Justice Marshall's viewthat `the laws of [a State] can have no force' within reservation boundaries. Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515, 561(1832),"

60, 72 (1962).That is not to say that States may exert the same degree
of regulatory authority within a reservation as they do with-out. To the contrary, the principle that Indians have the
right to make their own laws and be governed by them re-quires "an accommodation between the interests of the
Tribes and the Federal Government, on the one hand, andthose of the State, on the other."

Washington v. Confeder-ated Tribes of Colville Reservation, 447 U. S. 134, 156 (1980);

see also id., at 181 (opinion of Rehnquist, J.). "When on-reservation conduct involving only Indians is at issue, state
law is generally inapplicable, for the State's regulatory inter-est is likely to be minimal and the federal interest in encouraging tribal self-government is at its strongest." Bracker,
supra, at 144. When, however, state interests outside thereservation are implicated, States may regulate the activities even of tribe members on tribal land, as exemplified byour decision in Confederated Tribes. In that case, Indians
were selling cigarettes on their reservation to nonmembersfrom off reservation, without collecting the state cigarette
tax. We held that the State could require the Tribes to col-lect the tax from nonmembers, and could "impose at least
`minimal' burdens on the Indian retailer to aid in enforcingand collecting the tax," 447 U. S., at 151. It is also well established in our precedent that States have criminal juris-diction over reservation Indians for crimes committed (as
was the alleged poaching in this case) off the reservation.See

Opinion of the Court
While it is not entirely clear from our precedent whetherthe last mentioned authority entails the corollary right to

enter a reservation (including Indian-fee lands) for enforce-ment purposes, several of our opinions point in that direction. In Confederated Tribes, we explicitly reserved thequestion whether state officials could seize cigarettes held
for sale to nonmembers in order to recover the taxes due.See 447 U. S., at 162. In

Utah & Northern R. Co., however,we observed that "[i]t has . . . been held that process of

[state] courts may run into an Indian reservation of this kind,where the subject-matter or controversy is otherwise within
their cognizance," 116 U. S., at 31.5 Shortly thereafter, weconsidered, in United States v. Kagama, 118 U. S. 375 (1886),
whether Congress could enact a law giving federal courtsjurisdiction over various common-law, violent crimes committed by Indians on a reservation within a State. We ex-pressed skepticism that the Indian Commerce Clause could
justify this assertion of authority in derogation of state ju-risdiction, but ultimately accepted the argument that the law

"does not interfere with the process of the State courtswithin the reservation, nor with the operation of State
laws upon white people found there. Its effect isconfined to the acts of an Indian of some tribe, of a
criminal character, committed within the limits of thereservation.

"It seems to us that this is within the competency ofCongress."

Id., at 383.

The Court's references to "process" in Utah & Northern R.
Co. and Kagama, and the Court's concern in Kagama overpossible federal encroachment on state prerogatives, sug5 Though Utah & Northern R. Co. did not state what it meant by a
"reservation of this kind," the context makes clear that it meant a reservation not excluded from the territory of a State by treaty. See, e. g.,
Harkness v. Hyde, 98 U. S. 476, 478 (1879); The Kansas Indians, 5 Wall.
737, 739-741 (1867).

Opinion of the Court
gest state authority to issue search warrants in cases such
as the one before us. ("Process" is defined as "any means
used by a court to acquire or exercise its jurisdiction over a
person or over specific property," Black's Law Dictionary
1084 (5th ed. 1979), and is equated in criminal cases with a
warrant, id., at 1085.) It is noteworthy that Kagama recognized the right of state laws to "operat[e] . . . upon [nonIndians] found" within a reservation, but did not similarly
limit to non-Indians or the property of non-Indians the scope
of the process of state courts. This makes perfect sense,
since, as we explained in the context of federal enclaves, the
reservation of state authority to serve process is necessary
to "prevent [such areas] from becoming an asylum for fugitives from justice." Fort Leavenworth R. Co. v. Lowe, 114
U. S. 525, 533 (1885).6

We conclude today, in accordance with these prior statements, that tribal authority to regulate state officers in executing process related to the violation, off reservation, of
state laws is not essential to tribal self-government or internal relations--to "the right to make laws and be ruled
by them." The State's interest in execution of process is
considerable, and even when it relates to Indian-fee lands
it no more impairs the tribe's self-government than federal enforcement of federal law impairs state government.
Respondents argue that, even conceding the State's general
interest in enforcing its off-reservation poaching law on the
reservation, Nevada's interest in this suit is minimal, because it is a suit against state officials in their individual

6 That this risk is not purely hypothetical is demonstrated by Arizona
ex rel. Merrill v. Turtle, 413 F. 2d 683 (CA9 1969), a case in which the
Navajo Tribal Court refused to extradite a member to Oklahoma because
tribal law forbade extradition except to three neighboring States. The
Ninth Circuit held that Arizona (where the reservation was located) could
not enter the reservation to seize the suspect for extradition since (among
other reasons) this would interfere with tribal self-government, id., at
685-686.

capacities. We think, however, that the distinction betweenindividual and official capacity suits is irrelevant. To paraphrase our opinion in Tennessee v. Davis, 100 U. S. 257, 263(1880), which upheld a federal statute permitting federal
officers to remove to federal court state criminal proceed-ings brought against them for their official actions, a State
"can act only through its officers and agents," and if atribe can "affix penalties to acts done under the immediate
direction of the [state] government, and in obedience to itslaws," "the operations of the [state] government may at any
time be arrested at the will of the [tribe]." Cf. Anderson v.
Creighton, 483 U. S. 635, 638 (1987) ("[P]ermitting damagessuits against government officials can entail substantial social costs, including the risk that fear of personal monetaryliability and harassing litigation will unduly inhibit officials
in the discharge of their duties").

C
The States' inherent jurisdiction on reservations can ofcourse be stripped by Congress, see

Draper v. United States,164 U. S. 240, 242-243 (1896). But with regard to the jurisdiction at issue here that has not occurred. The Govern-ment's assertion that "[a]s a general matter, although state
officials have jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute crimeson a reservation that exclusively involve non-Indians, . . .
they do not have jurisdiction with respect to crimes in-volving Indian perpetrators or Indian victims," Brief for
United States as Amicus Curiae 12-13, n. 7, is misleading.The statutes upon which it relies, see

id., at 18-19, show thatthe last half of the statement, like the first, is limited to

"crimes on a reservation." Sections 1152 and 1153 ofTitle 18, which give United States and tribal criminal law
generally exclusive application, apply only to crimes com-mitted in Indian country; Public Law 280, codified at 18
U. S. C. $ 1162, which permits some state jurisdiction as anexception to this rule, is similarly limited. And 25 U. S. C.

Opinion of the Court

$ 2804, which permits federal-state agreements enablingstate law enforcement agents to act on reservations, applies

only to deputizing them for the enforcement of federal ortribal criminal law. Nothing in the federal statutory scheme
prescribes, or even remotely suggests, that state officerscannot enter a reservation (including Indian-fee land) to
investigate or prosecute violations of state law occurring offthe reservation. To the contrary, 25 U. S. C. $ 2806 affirms
that "the provisions of this chapter alter neither . . . the lawenforcement, investigative, or judicial authority of any . . .
State, or political subdivision or agency thereof . . . ."

III
We turn next to the contention of respondent and theGovernment that the tribal court, as a court of general jurisdiction, has authority to entertain federal claims under$ 1983.

7 It is certainly true that state courts of "general

jurisdiction" can adjudicate cases invoking federal statutes,such as $ 1983, absent congressional specification to the contrary. "Under [our] system of dual sovereignty, we haveconsistently held that state courts have inherent authority,
and are thus presumptively competent, to adjudicate claimsarising under the laws of the United States,"

Tafflin v.Levitt, 493 U. S. 455, 458 (1990). That this would be the

case was assumed by the Framers, see The Federalist No. 82,pp. 492-493 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961). Indeed, that state courts
could enforce federal law is presumed by Article III of the

7 Justice Stevens questions why it is necessary to consider tribalcourt jurisdiction over $ 1983 claims, since we have already determined
that "tribal courts lack . . . jurisdiction over `state wardens executing a
search warrant for evidence of an off-reservation crime,' " post, at 402, n. 1
(opinion concurring in judgment). It is because the latter determination
is based upon Strate's holding that tribal-court jurisdiction does not exceed
tribal regulatory jurisdiction; and because that holding contained a significant qualifier: "[a]bsent congressional direction enlarging tribal-court

Opinion of the Court
Constitution, which leaves to Congress the decision whetherto create lower federal courts at all. This historical and constitutional assumption of concurrent state-court jurisdictionover federal-law cases is completely missing with respect to
tribal courts.Respondents' contention that tribal courts are courts of
"general jurisdiction" is also quite wrong. A state court'sjurisdiction is general, in that it "lays hold of all subjects
of litigation between parties within its jurisdiction, thoughthe causes of dispute are relative to the laws of the most
distant part of the globe." Id., at 493. Tribal courts, itshould be clear, cannot be courts of general jurisdiction in
this sense, for a tribe's inherent adjudicative jurisdictionover nonmembers is at most only as broad as its legislative
jurisdiction. See supra, at 357-359.8 It is true that somestatutes proclaim tribal-court jurisdiction over certain questions of federal law. See, e. g., 25 U. S. C. $ 1911(a) (authorityto adjudicate child custody disputes under the Indian Child
Welfare Act of 1978); 12 U. S. C. $ 1715z-13(g)(5) ( jurisdic-tion over mortgage foreclosure actions brought by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development against reserva8 Justice Stevens argues that "[a]bsent federal law to the contrary,
the question whether tribal courts are courts of general jurisdiction is
fundamentally one of tribal law." Post, at 402 (emphasis deleted). The
point of our earlier discussion is that Strate is "federal law to the contrary." Justice Stevens thinks Strate cannot fill that role, because it
"merely concerned the circumstances under which tribal courts can exert
jurisdiction over claims against nonmembers," post, at 403, n. 3. But
Strate's limitation on jurisdiction over nonmembers pertains to subjectmatter, rather than merely personal, jurisdiction, since it turns upon
whether the actions at issue in the litigation are regulable by the tribe.
One can of course say that even courts of limited subject-matter jurisdiction have general jurisdiction over those subjects that they can adjudicate
(in the present case, jurisdiction over claims pertaining to activities by
nonmembers that can be regulated)--but that makes the concept of general jurisdiction meaningless, and is assuredly not the criterion that would
determine whether these courts received authority to adjudicate $ 1983
actions.

Opinion of the Court
tion homeowners). But no provision in federal law provides
for tribal-court jurisdiction over $ 1983 actions.

Furthermore, tribal-court jurisdiction would create serious anomalies, as the Government recognizes, because the
general federal-question removal statute refers only to removal from state court, see 28 U. S. C. $ 1441. Were $ 1983
claims cognizable in tribal court, defendants would inexplicably lack the right available to state-court $ 1983 defendants to seek a federal forum. The Government thinks the
omission of reference to tribal courts in $ 1441 unproblematic. Since, it argues, "[i]t is doubtful . . . that Congress
intended to deny tribal court defendants the right given
state court defendants to elect a federal forum for the adjudication of causes of action under federal law," we should
feel free to create that right by permitting the tribalcourt defendant to obtain a federal-court injunction against
the action, effectively forcing it to be refiled in federal
court. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 25-26.
The sole support for devising this extraordinary remedy is
El Paso Natural Gas Co. v. Neztsosie, 526 U. S. 473 (1999),
where we approved a similar procedure with regard to
claims under the Price-Anderson Act brought in tribal court.
In Neztsosie, however, the claims were not initially federal
claims, but Navajo tort claims that the Price-Anderson Act
provided "shall be deemed to be . . . action[s] arising under"
42 U. S. C. $ 2210; there was little doubt that the tribal court
had jurisdiction over such tort claims, see 526 U. S., at 482,
n. 4. And for the propriety of the injunction in Neztsosie,
we relied not on $ 1441, but on the removal provision of the
Price-Anderson Act, 42 U. S. C. $ 2210(n)(2). Although, like

$ 1441, that provision referred only to removal from state
courts, in light of the Act's detailed and distinctive provisions
for the handling of "nuclear incident" cases in federal court,
see 526 U. S., at 486, we thought it clear Congress envisioned
the defendant's ability to get into federal court in all in533US2 Unit: $U80 [11-01-02 19:17:06] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
stances. Not only are there missing here any distinctive
federal-court procedures, but in order even to confront the
question whether an unspecified removal power exists, we
must first attribute to tribal courts jurisdiction that is not
apparent. Surely the simpler way to avoid the removal
problem is to conclude (as other indications suggest anyway)
that tribal courts cannot entertain $ 1983 suits.

IV
The last question before us is whether petitioners were
required to exhaust their jurisdictional claims in Tribal
Court before bringing them in Federal District Court. See
National Farmers Union Ins. Cos. v. Crow Tribe, 471 U. S.
845, 856-857 (1985). In National Farmers Union we recognized exceptions to the exhaustion requirement, where
"an assertion of tribal jurisdiction is motivated by a desire to harass or is conducted in bad faith, . . . or where the
action is patently violative of express jurisdictional prohibitions, or where exhaustion would be futile because of the
lack of an adequate opportunity to challenge the court's jurisdiction," id., at 856, n. 21 (internal quotation marks omitted).
None of these exceptions seems applicable to this case, but
we added a broader exception in Strate: "[w]hen . . . it is
plain that no federal grant provides for tribal governance
of nonmembers' conduct on land covered by Montana's main
rule," so the exhaustion requirement "would serve no purpose other than delay." 520 U. S., at 459-460, and n. 14.
Though this exception too is technically inapplicable, the
reasoning behind it is not. Since it is clear, as we have
discussed, that tribal courts lack jurisdiction over state
officials for causes of action relating to their performance
of official duties, adherence to the tribal exhaustion requirement in such cases "would serve no purpose other than
delay," and is therefore unnecessary.

370 NEVADA v. HICKS

Opinion of the Court

V
Finally, a few words in response to the concurrence of
Justice O'Connor, which is in large part a dissent fromthe views expressed in this opinion.

9

The principal point of the concurrence is that our reason-ing "gives only passing consideration to the fact that the

state officials' activities in this case occurred on land ownedand controlled by the Tribes," post, at 392. According to
Justice O'Connor, "that factor is not prominent in theCourt's analysis," post, at 395. Even a cursory reading of
our opinion demonstrates that this is not so. To the con-trary, we acknowledge that tribal ownership is a factor
in the Montana analysis, and a factor significant enoughthat it "may sometimes be . . . dispositive,"

supra, at 360.We simply do not find it dispositive in the present case,

when weighed against the State's interest in pursuing off-reservation violations of its laws. See supra, at 364 (concluding that "[t]he State's interest in execution of process isconsiderable" enough to outweigh the tribal interest in selfgovernment "even when it relates to Indian-fee lands").The concurrence is of course free to disagree with this judgment; but to say that failure to give tribal ownership deter9 Justice O'Connor claims we have gone beyond the scope of the questions presented in this case by determining whether the Tribes could regulate the state game warden's actions on tribal land, because this is a case
about tribal "civil adjudicatory jurisdiction." See post, at 397 (opinion
concurring in part and concurring in judgment). But the third question
presented, see Pet. for Writ of Cert. i, is as follows: "Is the rule of [Montana], creating a presumption against tribal court jurisdiction over nonmembers, limited to cases in which a cause of action against a nonmember
arises on lands within a reservation which are not controlled by the tribe?"
Montana dealt only with regulatory authority, and is tied to adjudicatory
authority by Strate, which held that the latter at best tracks the former.
As is made clear in the merits briefing, petitioners' argument is that the
Tribes lacked adjudicatory authority because they lacked regulatory authority over the game wardens. See Brief for Petitioners 36-44.

Opinion of the Court
minative effect "fails to consider adequately the Tribe's in-herent sovereign interests in activities on their land," post,

at 401 (opinion of O'Connor, J.), is an exaggeration.The concurrence marshals no authority and scant reasoning to support its judgment that tribal authority over stateofficers pursuing, on tribe-owned land, off-reservation violations of state law may be "necessary to protect tribal self-government or to control internal relations."

Montana, 450U. S., at 564-565. Self-government and internal relations

are not directly at issue here, since the issue is whetherthe Tribes' law will apply, not to their own members, but
to a narrow category of outsiders. And the concurrencedoes not try to explain how allowing state officers to pursue
off-reservation violation of state law "threatens or has somedirect effect on the political integrity, the economic security,
or the health or welfare of the tribe," id., at 566. That theactions of these state officers cannot threaten or affect those
interests is guaranteed by the limitations of federal con-stitutional and statutory law to which the officers are fully
subject.The concurrence exaggerates and distorts the consequences of our conclusion, supra, at 359, n. 3, that the term"other arrangements" in a passage from

Montana referredto other "private consensual" arrangements--so that it did

not include the state officials' obtaining of tribal warrantsin the present case. That conclusion is correct, as a fuller
exposition of the passage from Montana makes clear:

"To be sure, Indian tribes retain inherent sovereign
power to exercise some forms of civil jurisdiction overnon-Indians on their reservations, even on non-Indian

fee lands. A tribe may regulate, through taxation, li-censing, or other means, the activities of nonmembers
who enter consensual relationships with the tribe or itsmembers, through commercial dealing, contracts, leases,
or other arrangements." 450 U. S., at 565.

372 NEVADA v. HICKS

Opinion of the Court
The Court (this is an opinion, bear in mind, not a statute)obviously did not have in mind States or state officers acting in their governmental capacity; it was referring to pri-vate individuals who voluntarily submitted themselves to
tribal regulatory jurisdiction by the arrangements that they(or their employers) entered into. This is confirmed by the
fact that all four of the cases in the immediately following
citation involved private commercial actors. See Confederated Tribes, 447 U. S., at 152 (nonmember purchasers of
cigarettes from tribal outlet); Williams v. Lee, 358 U. S., at217 (general store on the Navajo reservation);

Morris v.
Hitchcock, 194 U. S. 384 (1904) (ranchers grazing livestock
and horses on Indian lands "under contracts with individual
members of said tribes"); Buster v. Wright, 135 F. 947, 950
(CA8 1905) (challenge to the "permit tax" charged by a tribe
to nonmembers for "the privilege . . . of trading within the
borders").

The concurrence concludes from this brief footnote discussion that we would invalidate express or implied cessions of
regulatory authority over nonmembers contained in statetribal cooperative agreements, including those pertaining
to mutual law enforcement assistance, tax administration assistance, and child support and paternity matters. See post,
at 393-394. This is a great overreaching. The footnote
does not assert that "a consensual relationship [between a
tribe and a State] could never exist," post, at 394 (opinion of
O'Connor, J.). It merely asserts that "other arrangements"
in the passage from Montana does not include state officers'
obtaining of an (unnecessary) tribal warrant. Whether contractual relations between State and tribe can expressly or
impliedly confer tribal regulatory jurisdiction over nonmembers--and whether such conferral can be effective to confer
adjudicative jurisdiction as well--are questions that may
arise in another case, but are not at issue here.

Another exaggeration is the concurrence's contention that
we "give nonmembers freedom to act with impunity on tribal

533US2 Unit: $U80 [11-01-02 19:17:06] PAGES PGT: OPIN

373Cite as: 533 U. S. 353 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
land based solely on their status as state law enforcementofficials,"

post, at 401 (opinion of O'Connor, J.). We do not
say state officers cannot be regulated; we say they cannotbe regulated in the performance of their law enforcement

duties. Action unrelated to that is potentially subject totribal control depending on the outcome of

Montana analysis. Moreover, even where the issue is whether the officer
has acted unlawfully in the performance of his duties, thetribe and tribe members are of course able to invoke the

authority of the Federal Government and federal courts(or the state government and state courts) to vindicate constitutional or other federal- and state-law rights.

We must comment upon the final paragraphs of Part II
of the concurrence's opinion--which bring on stage, in classic
fashion, a deus ex machina to extract, from the seemingly
insoluble difficulties that the prior writing has created, a
happy ending. The concurrence manages to have its cake
and eat it too--to hand over state law enforcement officers
to the jurisdiction of tribal courts and yet still assure that
the officers' traditional immunity (and hence the State's law
enforcement interest) will be protected--by simply announcing "that in order to protect government officials, immunity claims should be considered in reviewing tribal court jurisdiction." Post, at 401 (opinion of O'Connor, J.). What
wonderful magic. Without so much as a citation (none is
available) the concurrence declares the qualified immunity

inquiry to be part of the jurisdictional inquiry, thus bringing it within the ken of the federal court at the outset of the
case. There are two problems with this declaration. The
first is that it is not true. There is no authority whatever
for the proposition that absolute- and qualified-immunity defenses pertain to the court's jurisdiction--much less to the
tribe's regulatory jurisdiction, which is what is at issue here.
(If they did pertain to the court's jurisdiction, they would
presumably be nonwaivable. Cf. Idaho v. Coeur d'Alene
Tribe of Idaho, 521 U. S. 261, 267 (1997).) And the second

533US2 Unit: $U80 [11-01-02 19:17:06] PAGES PGT: OPIN
374 NEVADA v. HICKS

Opinion of the Court
problem is that without first determining whether the tribehas regulatory jurisdiction, it is impossible to know which

"immunity defenses" the federal court is supposed to con-sider. The tribe's law on this subject need not be the same
as the State's; indeed, the tribe may decide (as did the com-mon law until relatively recently) that there is no immunity defense whatever without a warrant. See Californiav.

Acevedo, 500 U. S. 565, 581 (1991) (Scalia, J., concurringin judgment). One wonders whether, deprived of its deus

ex machina, the concurrence would not alter the conclusionit reached in Part I of its opinion, and agree with us that
a proper balancing of state and tribal interests would givethe Tribes no jurisdiction over state officers pursuing offreservation violations of state law.Finally, it is worth observing that the concurrence's resolution would, for the first time, hold a non-Indian subject tothe jurisdiction of a tribal court. The question (which we
have avoided) whether tribal regulatory and adjudicatoryjurisdiction are coextensive is simply answered by the concurrence in the affirmative. As Justice Souter's separateopinion demonstrates, it surely deserves more considered
analysis. * * *

Because the Fallon Paiute-Shoshone Tribes lacked legis-lative authority to restrict, condition, or otherwise regulate
the ability of state officials to investigate off-reservation vio-lations of state law, they also lacked adjudicative authority
to hear respondent's claim that those officials violated triballaw in the performance of their duties. Nor can the Tribes
identify any authority to adjudicate respondent's $ 1983claim. And since the lack of authority is clear, there is no
need to exhaust the jurisdictional dispute in tribal court.State officials operating on a reservation to investigate offreservation violations of state law are properly held account-able for tortious conduct and civil rights violations in either
state or federal court, but not in tribal court.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, andthe case remanded for further proceedings consistent with

our opinion. It is so ordered.

Justice Souter, with whom Justice Kennedy and
Justice Thomas join, concurring.

I agree that the Fallon Paiute-Shoshone Tribal Court hadno jurisdiction to entertain Hicks's claims against the petitioning state officers here, and I join the Court's opinion.While I agree with the Court's analysis as well as its conclusion, I would reach that point by a different route. Likethe Court, I take

Montana v. United States, 450 U. S. 544(1981), to be the source of the first principle on tribal-court

civil jurisdiction, see Atkinson Trading Co. v. Shirley, 532U. S. 645, 659 (2001) (

Souter, J., concurring). But while theCourt gives emphasis to measuring tribal authority here

in light of the State's interest in executing its own legalprocess to enforce state law governing off-reservation conduct, ante, at 360-365, I would go right to Montana's rulethat a tribe's civil jurisdiction generally stops short of nonmember defendants, 450 U. S., at 565, subject only to twoexceptions, one turning on "consensual relationships," the
other on respect for "the political integrity, the economicsecurity, or the health or welfare of the tribe," id., at
566.1

Montana applied this presumption against tribal jurisdic-tion to nonmember conduct on fee land within a reservation;

I would also apply it where, as here, a nonmember acts ontribal or trust land, and I would thus make it explicit that
land status within a reservation is not a primary juris1 The virtue of the Court's approach is in laying down a rule that would
be unquestionably applicable even if in a future case the state officials
issuing and executing state process happened to be tribal members (which
they apparently are not here).

dictional fact, but is relevant only insofar as it bears on the
application of one of Montana's exceptions to a particular
case. Insofar as I rest my conclusion on the general jurisdictional presumption, it follows for me that, although the
holding in this case is "limited to the question of tribal-court
jurisdiction over state officers enforcing state law," ante, at
358, n. 2, one rule independently supporting that holding
(that as a general matter "the inherent sovereign powers of
an Indian tribe do not extend to the activities of nonmembers
of the tribe," ante, at 359) is not so confined.

Petitioners are certainly correct that "[t]ribal adjudicatory
jurisdiction over nonmembers is . . . ill-defined," Reply Brief
for Petitioners 16, since this Court's own pronouncements
on the issue have pointed in seemingly opposite directions.
Compare, e. g., Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez, 436 U. S. 49,
65 (1978) ("Tribal courts have repeatedly been recognized as
appropriate forums for the exclusive adjudication of disputes affecting important personal and property interests
of both Indians and non-Indians"), and United States v.
Mazurie, 419 U. S. 544, 557 (1975) ("Indian tribes are unique
aggregations possessing attributes of sovereignty over both
their members and their territory"), with, e. g., Oliphant v.
Suquamish Tribe, 435 U. S. 191, 209 (1978) (" `[T]he limitation upon [tribes'] sovereignty amounts to the right of
governing every person within their limits except themselves' " (quoting Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 87, 147 (1810))).
Oliphant, however, clarified tribal courts' criminal jurisdiction (in holding that they had none as to non-Indians),
and that decision is now seen as a significant step on the
way to Montana, "the pathmarking case concerning tribal
civil authority over nonmembers," Strate v. A-1 Contractors,
520 U. S. 438, 445 (1997). The path marked best is the rule

that, at least as a presumptive matter, tribal courts lack civiljurisdiction over nonmembers.

To be sure, Montana does not of its own force resolvethe jurisdictional issue in this case. There, while recognizing that the parties had "raised broad questions about the
power of the Tribe to regulate [the conduct of] non-Indians
on the reservation," we noted that the issue before us was a
"narrow one." 450 U. S., at 557. Specifically, we said, the
question presented concerned only the power of an Indian
tribe to regulate the conduct of nonmembers "on reservation land owned in fee by nonmembers of the Tribe." Ibid.
Here, it is undisputed, the acts complained of occurred on
reservation land "controlled by a tribe." Pet. for Cert. 24.
But although the distinction between tribal and fee land
(and, accordingly, between Montana and this case) surely
exists, it does not in my mind call for a different result.
I see the legal principles that animated our presumptive
preclusion of tribal jurisdiction in Montana as counseling
a similar rule as to regulatory, and hence adjudicatory, jurisdiction here.

In Montana, the Court began its discussion of tribes' "inherent authority" by noting that "the Indian tribes have lost
many of the attributes of sovereignty." 450 U. S., at 563.

2 The Court in Montana v. United States, 450 U. S. 544 (1981), referred
to "nonmembers" and "non-Indians" interchangeably. In response to our
decision in Duro v. Reina, 495 U. S. 676 (1990), in which we extended
the rule of Oliphant to deny tribal courts criminal jurisdiction over nonmember Indians (i. e., Indians who are members of other tribes), Congress
passed a statute expressly granting tribal courts such jurisdiction, see
105 Stat. 646, 25 U. S. C. $ 1301(2). Because, here, we are concerned with
the extent of tribes' inherent authority, and not with the jurisdiction
statutorily conferred on them by Congress, the relevant distinction, as
we implicitly acknowledged in Strate, is between members and nonmembers of the tribe. In this case, nonmembership means freedom from
tribal-court jurisdiction, since none of the petitioning state officers is
identified as an Indian of any tribe.

378 NEVADA v. HICKS

Souter, J., concurring
In "distinguish[ing] between those inherent powers retainedby the tribe and those divested,"

id., at 564, the Court relied
on a portion of the opinion in United States v. Wheeler, 435U. S. 313, 326 (1978), from which it quoted at length:

" `The areas in which . . . implicit divestiture of sov-ereignty has been held to have occurred are those involving the relations between an Indian tribe and nonmembers of the tribe. . . .

" `These limitations rest on the fact that the depend-ent status of Indian tribes within our territorial jurisdiction is necessarily inconsistent with their freedom in-dependently

to determine their external relations. But
the powers of self-government, including the power to
prescribe and enforce internal criminal laws, are of adifferent type. They involve

only the relations among
members of a tribe. Thus, they are not such powers aswould necessarily be lost by virtue of a tribe's dependent status.' " Montana, supra, at 564.
The emphasis in these passages (supplied by the MontanaCourt, not by me) underscores the distinction between tribal

members and nonmembers, and seems clearly to indicate,
without restriction to the criminal law, that the inherentauthority of the tribes has been preserved over the former but not the latter. In fact, after quoting Wheeler, theCourt invoked

Oliphant, supra, which (as already noted)
had imposed a per se bar to tribal-court criminal jurisdictionover non-Indians, even with respect to conduct occurring on

tribal land. The Montana Court remarked that, "[t]hough
Oliphant only determined inherent tribal authority in criminal matters, the principles on which it relied" support a more
"general proposition" applicable in civil cases as well, namely,
that "the inherent sovereign powers of an Indian tribe do
not extend to the activities of nonmembers of the tribe."
450 U. S., at 565. Accordingly, the Court in Montana repeatedly pressed the member-nonmember distinction, reiter533US2 Unit: $U80 [11-01-02 19:17:06] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ating at one point, for example, that while "the Indian tribesretain their inherent power to determine tribal membership, to regulate domestic relations among members, andto prescribe rules of inheritance for members," the "exercise of tribal power beyond what is necessary to protecttribal self-government or to control internal relations is inconsistent with the dependent status of the tribes, and socannot survive without express congressional delegation."
Id., at 564; cf. Oliphant v. Schlie, 544 F. 2d 1007, 1015 (CA91976) (Kennedy, J., dissenting) ("The concept of sovereignty
applicable to Indian tribes need not include the power toprosecute nonmembers. This power, unlike the ability to
maintain law and order on the reservation and to excludenondesireable nonmembers, is not essential to the tribe's
identity or its self-governing status"), rev'd sub nom. Oliphant v. Suquamish Tribe, 435 U. S. 191 (1978).To Montana's "general proposition" confining the subjects

of tribal jurisdiction to tribal members, the Court appendedtwo exceptions that could support tribal jurisdiction in some
civil matters. First, a tribe may "regulate . . . the activitiesof nonmembers who enter consensual relationships with the
tribe or its members, through commercial dealing, contracts,leases, or other arrangements." And second, a tribe may
regulate nonmember conduct that "threatens or has somedirect effect on the political integrity, the economic security,
or the health or welfare of the tribe." 450 U. S., at 565-566.3But unless one of these exceptions applies, the "general

In Strate, we expressly extended the Montana frame-work, originally applied as a measure of tribes' civil regulatory jurisdiction, to limit tribes' civil adjudicatory juris-diction. We repeated that "absent express authorization by
federal statute or treaty, tribal jurisdiction over the conduct of nonmembers exists only in limited circumstances."520 U. S., at 445. Quoting

Montana, we further explained
that "[i]n the main" (that is, subject to the two exceptionsoutlined in the

Montana opinion), " `the inherent sovereign
powers of an Indian tribe'--those powers a tribe enjoysapart from express provision by treaty or statute--`do not

extend to the activities of nonmembers of the tribe.' " 520U. S., at 445-446. Equally important for purposes here was
our treatment of the following passage from Iowa Mut. Ins.
Co. v. LaPlante, 480 U. S. 9 (1987), which seemed to state a
more expansive jurisdictional position and which had beencited by the Tribal Court in

Strate in support of broad
tribal-court civil jurisdiction over nonmembers:

" `Tribal authority over the activities of non-Indians

The Strate petitioners fastened upon the statement that

We said that the passage "scarcely supports the view thatthe

Montana rule does not bear on tribal-court adjudicatory authority in cases involving nonmember defendants,"520 U. S., at 451-452, and stressed the "three informative

citations" accompanying the statement, which mark the truecontours of inherent tribal authority over nonmembers:

"The first citation points to the passage in Montana inwhich the Court advanced `the general proposition that
the inherent sovereign powers of an Indian tribe do notextend to the activities of nonmembers of the tribe,'
with two prime exceptions. The case cited second is
Washington v. Confederated Tribes of Colville Reservation, a decision the Montana Court listed as illustrative
of the first Montana exception . . . . The third casenoted in conjunction with the

Iowa Mutual statement
is Fisher v. District Court of Sixteenth Judicial Dist.
of Mont., a decision the Montana Court cited in support of the second Montana exception . . . ." Id., at 452(citations omitted).

Accordingly, in explaining and distinguishing Iowa Mutual,
we confirmed in Strate what we had indicated in Montana:
that as a general matter, a tribe's civil jurisdiction doesnot extend to the "activities of non-Indians on reservation

lands," Iowa Mutual, supra, at 18, and that the only suchactivities that trigger civil jurisdiction are those that fit
within one of Montana's two exceptions.After

Strate, it is undeniable that a tribe's remaining
inherent civil jurisdiction to adjudicate civil claims arisingout of acts committed on a reservation depends in the first

instance on the character of the individual over whom jurisdiction is claimed, not on the title to the soil on which
he acted. The principle on which Montana and Strate were
decided (like Oliphant before them) looks first to human
relationships, not land records, and it should make no difference per se whether acts committed on a reservation

II
Limiting tribal-court civil jurisdiction this way not onlyapplies the animating principle behind our precedents, but

fits with historical assumptions about tribal authority andserves sound policy. As for history,

Justice Stevens hasobserved that "[i]n sharp contrast to the tribes' broad powers over their own members, tribal powers over nonmembershave always been narrowly confined." Merrion v. Jicarilla
Apache Tribe, 455 U. S. 130, 171 (1982) (dissenting opinion).His point is exemplified by the early treaties with those
who became known as the five civilized Tribes, which trea-ties "specifically granted the right of self-government to the
tribes [but] specifically excluded jurisdiction over nonmem-bers." Id., at 171, n. 21 (citing Treaty with the Cherokees,
Art. 5, 7 Stat. 481 (1835), Treaty with the Choctaws andChickasaws, Art. 7, 11 Stat. 612 (1855), and Treaty with the
Creeks and Seminoles, Art. 15, 11 Stat. 703 (1856)). In asimilar vein, referring to 19th-century federal statutes setting the jurisdiction of the courts of those five Tribes, thisCourt said in

In re Mayfield, 141 U. S. 107, 116 (1891), thatthe "general object" of such measures was "to vest in the

courts of the [Indian] nation jurisdiction of all controversiesbetween Indians, or where a member of the nation is the
only party to the proceeding, and to reserve to the courts

4 Thus, it is not that land status is irrelevant to a proper Montana calculus, only that it is not determinative in the first instance. Land status,
for instance, might well have an impact under one (or perhaps both) of the
Montana exceptions. See Atkinson Trading Co. v. Shirley, 532 U. S. 645,
659-660 (2001) (Souter, J., concurring); cf. White Mountain Apache Tribe
v. Bracker, 448 U. S. 136, 151 (1980) ("[T]here is a significant geographic
component to tribal sovereignty").

of the United States jurisdiction of all actions to which itsown citizens are parties on either side." And, in fact, to

this very day, general federal law prohibits Courts of IndianOffenses (tribunals established by regulation for tribes that
have not organized their own tribal court systems) from ex-ercising jurisdiction over unconsenting nonmembers. Such
courts have "[c]ivil jurisdiction" only of those actions arising
within their territory "in which the defendant is an Indian,and of all other suits between Indians and non-Indians which

are brought before the court by stipulation of the parties."25 CFR $ 11.103(a) (2000).

A rule generally prohibiting tribal courts from exercising
civil jurisdiction over nonmembers, without looking first to
the status of the land on which individual claims arise, also
makes sense from a practical standpoint, for tying tribes'
authority to land status in the first instance would produce an unstable jurisdictional crazy quilt. Because land on
Indian reservations constantly changes hands (from tribes
to nonmembers, from nonmembers to tribal members, and
so on), a jurisdictional rule under which land status was dispositive would prove extraordinarily difficult to administer
and would provide little notice to nonmembers, whose susceptibility to tribal-court jurisdiction would turn on the most
recent property conveyances. Cf. Hodel v. Irving, 481 U. S.
704, 718 (1987) (noting the difficulties that attend the "extreme fractionation of Indian lands").

The ability of nonmembers to know where tribal jurisdiction begins and ends, it should be stressed, is a matter
of real, practical consequence given "[t]he special nature of
[Indian] tribunals," Duro v. Reina, 495 U. S. 676, 693 (1990),
which differ from traditional American courts in a number
of significant respects. To start with the most obvious one,
it has been understood for more than a century that the Bill
of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment do not of their
own force apply to Indian tribes. See Talton v. Mayes, 163
U. S. 376, 382-385 (1896); F. Cohen, Handbook of Federal In533US2 Unit: $U80 [11-01-02 19:17:06] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Souter, J., concurring
dian Law 664-665 (1982 ed.) (hereinafter Cohen) ("Indian
tribes are not states of the union within the meaning of the
Constitution, and the constitutional limitations on states do
not apply to tribes"). Although the Indian Civil Rights Act
of 1968 (ICRA) makes a handful of analogous safeguards
enforceable in tribal courts, 25 U. S. C. $ 1302, "the guarantees are not identical," Oliphant, 435 U. S., at 194,5 and there
is a "definite trend by tribal courts" toward the view that
they "ha[ve] leeway in interpreting" the ICRA's due process
and equal protection clauses and "need not follow the U. S.
Supreme Court precedents `jot-for-jot,' " Newton, Tribal
Court Praxis: One Year in the Life of Twenty Indian Tribal
Courts, 22 Am. Indian L. Rev. 285, 344, n. 238 (1998). In any
event, a presumption against tribal-court civil jurisdiction
squares with one of the principal policy considerations underlying Oliphant, namely, an overriding concern that citizens who are not tribal members be "protected . . . from
unwarranted intrusions on their personal liberty," 435 U. S.,
at 210.

Tribal courts also differ from other American courts (and
often from one another) in their structure, in the substantive law they apply, and in the independence of their judges.
Although some modern tribal courts "mirror American
courts" and "are guided by written codes, rules, procedures,
and guidelines," tribal law is still frequently unwritten,
being based instead "on the values, mores, and norms of a
tribe and expressed in its customs, traditions, and practices,"
and is often "handed down orally or by example from one
generation to another." Melton, Indigenous Justice Systems and Tribal Society, 79 Judicature 126, 130-131 (1995).
The resulting law applicable in tribal courts is a complex
"mix of tribal codes and federal, state, and traditional
law," National American Indian Court Judges Assn., Indian

federal and state governments are not included in the [ICRA]").

Courts and the Future 43 (1978), which would be unusuallydifficult for an outsider to sort out.

Hence the practical importance of being able to antici-pate tribal jurisdiction by reference to a fact more readily
knowable than the title status of a particular plot of land.One further consideration confirms the point. It is generally accepted that there is no effective review mechanismin place to police tribal courts' decisions on matters of nontribal law, since tribal-court judgments based on state orfederal law can be neither removed nor appealed to state
or federal courts. Cf., e. g., 28 U. S. C. $ 1441(a) (removal of"any civil action brought in a State court of which the district courts of the United States have original jurisdiction");$ 1257(a) (Supreme Court review of "judgments or decrees
rendered by the highest court of a State" where federal lawimplicated). The result, of course, is a risk of substantial
disuniformity in the interpretation of state and federal law,a risk underscored by the fact that "[t]ribal courts are often
`subordinate to the political branches of tribal govern-ments,' " Duro, supra, at 693 (quoting Cohen 334-335).

III
There is one loose end. The panel majority in the NinthCircuit held that "the

Montana presumption against tribalcourt jurisdiction does not apply in this case." 196 F. 3d

1020, 1028 (1999). Since we have held otherwise, should wenow remand for application of the correct law? There is
room for reasonable disagreement on this point, see post,at 396 (O'C

onnor, J., concurring in part and concurring injudgment), but on balance I think a remand is unnecessary.

The Court's analysis of opposing state and tribal interestsanswers the opinion of the Ninth Circuit majority; in substance, the issues subject to the Court of Appeals's prin-cipal concern have been considered here. My own focus on
the Montana presumption was, of course, addressed by thepanel (albeit unsympathetically), and the only question that

might now be considered by the Circuit on my separateapproach to the case is the applicability of the second Montana exception. But as Judge Rymer indicated in her dis-sent, the uncontested fact that the Tribal Court itself authorized service of the state warrant here bars any seriouscontention that the execution of that warrant adversely affected the Tribes' political integrity. See 196 F. 3d, at 1033-1034. Thus, even if my alternative rationale exclusively
governed the outcome, remand would be pure formality.

Justice Ginsburg, concurring.
I join the Court's opinion. As the Court plainly states,and as

Justice Souter recognizes, the "holding in thiscase is limited to the question of tribal-court jurisdiction

over state officers enforcing state law." Ante, at 358, n. 2(opinion of the Court);

ante, at 376 (Souter, J., concurring).The Court's decision explicitly "leave[s] open the question

of tribal-court jurisdiction over nonmember defendants ingeneral," ante, at 358, n. 2, including state officials engaged
on tribal land in a venture or frolic of their own, see ante,at 373 (a state officer's conduct on tribal land "unrelated to
[performance of his law-enforcement duties] is potentially
subject to tribal control").I write separately only to emphasize that

Strate v. A-1
Contractors, 520 U. S. 438 (1997), similarly deferred largerissues.

Strate concerned a highway accident on a rightof-way over tribal land. For nonmember governance pur-poses, the accident site was equivalent to alienated, nonIndian land. Id., at 456. We held that the nonmembercharged with negligent driving in

Strate was not amenable
to the Tribe's legislative or adjudicatory authority. But we"express[ed] no view on the governing law or proper forum"

for cases arising out of nonmember conduct on tribal land.
Id., at 442. The Court's opinion, as I understand it, does not
reach out definitively to answer the jurisdictional questions
left open in Strate.

Today, the Court finally resolves that Montana v. United
States, 450 U. S. 544 (1981), governs a tribe's civil jurisdiction over nonmembers regardless of land ownership. Ante,
at 358-360. This is done with little fanfare, but the holding
is significant because we have equivocated on this question
in the past.

In Montana, we held that the Tribe in that case could not
regulate the hunting and fishing activities of nonmembers
on nontribal land located within the geographical boundaries
of the reservation. 450 U. S., at 557. We explained that
the Tribe's jurisdiction was limited to two instances--where
a consensual relationship exists between the Tribe and nonmembers, or where jurisdiction was necessary to preserve
tribal sovereignty--and we concluded that neither instance
applied. Id., at 565-567; ante, at 358-360.

Given the facts of Montana, it was not clear whether the
status of the persons being regulated, or the status of the
land where the hunting and fishing occurred, led the Court
to develop Montana's jurisdictional rule and its exceptions.
In subsequent cases, we indicated that the nonmember
status of the person being regulated determined Montana's

application, see, e. g., South Dakota v. Bourland, 508 U. S.679, 694-695, and n. 15 (1993), while in other cases we indicated that the fee simple status of the land triggered ap-plication of Montana, see, e. g., Strate v. A-1 Contractors,
supra, at 454, and n. 8. This is the Court's first opportunityin recent years to consider whether Montana applies to nonmember activity on land owned and controlled by the tribe.Cf.

Atkinson Trading Co. v. Shirley, 532 U. S. 645 (2001).The Court of Appeals concluded that Montana did not

apply in this case because the events in question occurredon tribal land. 196 F. 3d 1020, 1028 (CA9 1999). Because
Montana is our best source of "coherence in the variousmanifestations of the general law of tribal jurisdiction over
non-Indians," Atkinson Trading Co. v. Shirley, supra, at 659(

Souter, J., concurring), the majority is quite right that
Montana should govern our analysis of a tribe's civil juris-diction over nonmembers both on and off tribal land. I part

company with the majority, however, because its reasoningis not faithful to

Montana or its progeny.

B
Montana's principles bear repeating. In Montana, theCourt announced the "general proposition that the inherent

sovereign powers of an Indian tribe do not extend to theactivities of nonmembers of the tribe." 450 U. S., at 565.
The Court further explained, however, that tribes do retainsome attributes of sovereignty:

"To be sure, Indian tribes retain inherent sovereignpower to exercise some forms of civil jurisdiction over
non-Indians on their reservations, even on non-Indianfee lands. A tribe may regulate, through taxation, licensing, or other means, the activities of nonmemberswho enter consensual relationships with the tribe or its
members, through commercial dealing, contracts, leases,or other arrangements. A tribe may also retain inherent power to exercise civil authority over the conduct of

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
non-Indians on fee lands within its reservation whenthat conduct threatens or has some direct effect on the

political integrity, the economic security, or the healthor welfare of the tribe." Id., at 565-566 (citations
omitted).
We concluded in that case that hunting and fishing by non-members on reservation land held in fee by nonmembers

of the Tribe did not fit within either of the "Montana ex-ceptions" that permit jurisdiction over nonmembers. The
hunting and fishing in that case did not involve a consensualrelationship and did not threaten the security of the Tribe.
Id., at 557. We "readily agree[d]" with the Court of Appealsin that case, however, that the Tribe "may prohibit nonmembers from hunting or fishing on land belonging to the Tribeor held by the United States in trust for the Tribe," and that
"if the Tribe permits nonmembers to fish or hunt on suchlands, it may condition their entry by charging a fee or establishing . . . limits." Ibid. In the cases that followed, weuniformly regarded land ownership as an important factor in
determining the scope of a tribe's civil jurisdiction.We have held that the tribe's power to impose taxes on
nonmembers doing business on tribal or trust lands of thereservation is "an essential attribute of Indian sovereignty
because it is a necessary instrument of self-governmentand territorial management."

Merrion v. Jicarilla ApacheTribe, 455 U. S. 130, 137 (1982). We held that the tribe's

power to tax derived from two distinct sources: the tribe'spower of self-government and the tribe's power to exclude.
Id., at 137, 149. Recognizing that tribes are " `unique ag-gregations possessing attributes of sovereignty,' " however,
we further explained that the power to tax was "subject toconstraints not imposed on other governmental entities" in
that the Federal Government could take away that power.Id., at 140-141.

At issue in Brendale v. Confederated Tribes and Bands
of Yakima Nation, 492 U. S. 408 (1989), was whether Tribes

had the authority to zone particular tracts of land withinthe boundaries of the reservation owned by nonmembers.

Although no opinion garnered a majority, Members of theCourt determined the Tribes' zoning authority by considering the Tribes' power to exclude and the Tribes' sovereigninterests in preserving the Tribes' political integrity, economic security, and health and welfare. Id., at 423-425,
428-432 (White, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and Scaliaand

Kennedy, JJ.); id., at 433-435, 443-444 (Stevens, J.,
joined by O'Connor, J.); id., at 454-455 (Blackmun, J., joinedby Brennan and Marshall, JJ.). In the end, the Tribes'

power to zone each parcel of land turned on the extent to
which the Tribes maintained ownership and control over the
areas in which the parcels were located. Id., at 438-444,
444-447 (Stevens, J., joined by O'Connor, J.).

In South Dakota v. Bourland, supra, we were again confronted with a Tribe's attempt to regulate hunting and fishing by nonmembers on lands located within the boundaries
of the Tribe's reservation, but not owned by the tribe. In
Bourland, the United States had acquired the land at issue
from the Tribe under the Flood Control Act and the Cheyenne River Act. Id., at 689-690. We concluded that these
congressional enactments deprived the Tribe of "any former
right of absolute and exclusive use and occupation of the conveyed lands." Id., at 689. We considered that Montana's
exceptions might support tribal jurisdiction over nonmembers, but decided to leave that issue for consideration on remand. 508 U. S., at 695-696.

We have also applied Montana to decide whether a tribal
court had civil jurisdiction to adjudicate a lawsuit arising out
of a traffic accident on a state highway that passed through a
reservation. Strate v. A-1 Contractors, 520 U. S. 438 (1997).
We explained that "Montana delineated--in a main rule and
exceptions--the bounds of the power tribes retain to exercise `forms of civil jurisdiction' " over nonmembers. Because our prior cases did not involve jurisdiction of tribal

533US2 Unit: $U80 [11-01-02 19:17:06] PAGES PGT: OPIN

391Cite as: 533 U. S. 353 (2001)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
courts, we clarified that "[a]s to nonmembers . . . a tribe'sadjudicative jurisdiction does not exceed its legislative jurisdiction." Id., at 453. Again, we considered the statusof the land where the nonmember activities occurred. In
accord with Montana, we "readily agree[d]" "that tribes re-tain considerable control over nonmember conduct on tribal
land." 520 U. S., at 454. But we determined that the rightof-way acquired for the State's highway rendered that landequivalent to "alienated, non-Indian land."

Ibid. Applying
Montana, we concluded that the defendant's allegedly tor-tious conduct did not constitute a consensual relationship

that gave rise to tribal court jurisdiction. 520 U. S., at 456-
457. We also found that "[n]either regulatory nor adjudicatory authority over the state highway accident . . . is needed
to preserve `the right of reservation Indians to make their
own laws and be ruled by them.' " Id., at 459.

Just last month, we applied Montana in a case concerning
a Tribe's authority to tax nonmember activity occurring on
non-Indian fee land. Atkinson Trading Co. v. Shirley, 532
U. S. 645 (2001). In that case, the Tribe argued that it had
the power to tax under Merrion, supra. We disagreed, distinguishing Merrion on the ground that the Tribe's inherent
power to tax "only extended to `transactions occurring on
trust lands and significantly involving a tribe or its members.' " 532 U. S., at 653 (quoting Merrion, supra, at 137).
We explained that "Merrion involved a tax that only applied
to activity occurring on the reservation, and its holding is
therefore easily reconcilable with the Montana-Strate line
of authority, which we deem to be controlling." 532 U. S.,
at 653.

Montana and our other cases concerning tribal civil jurisdiction over nonmembers occupy a middle ground between
our cases that provide for nearly absolute tribal sovereignty
over tribe members, see generally Williams v. Lee, 358 U. S.,
at 218-223, and our rule that tribes have no inherent criminal jurisdiction over nonmembers, see Oliphant v. Suqua533US2 Unit: $U80 [11-01-02 19:17:06] PAGES PGT: OPIN
392 NEVADA v. HICKS

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
mish Tribe, 435 U. S. 191 (1978). Montana recognizes that
tribes retain sovereign interests in activities that occur on
land owned and controlled by the tribe, and provides principles that guide our determination of whether particular activities by nonmembers implicate these sovereign interests
to a degree that tribal civil jurisdiction is appropriate.

C
In this case, the Court purports to apply Montana--in
keeping with the above line of cases--to determine whether
the Tribes, "as an exercise of their inherent sovereignty, . . .
can regulate state wardens executing a search warrant for
evidence of an off-reservation crime." Ante, at 358. The
Court's reasoning suffers from two serious flaws: It gives
only passing consideration to the fact that the state officials'
activities in this case occurred on land owned and controlled
by the Tribes, and it treats as dispositive the fact that the
nonmembers in this case are state officials.

Under the first Montana exception, a tribe may exercise
regulatory jurisdiction where a nonmember enters into a
consensual relationship with the tribe. 450 U. S., at 565.
The majority in this case dismisses the applicability of this
exception in a footnote, concluding that any consensual relationship between tribes and nonmembers "clearly" must
be a "private" consensual relationship "from which the official actions at issue in this case are far removed." Ante, at
359, n. 3.

The majority provides no support for this assertion. The
Court's decision in Montana did not and could not have resolved the complete scope of the first exception. We could
only apply the first exception to the activities presented in
that case, namely, hunting and fishing by nonmembers on
land owned in fee simple by nonmembers. 450 U. S., at 557.
To be sure, Montana is "an opinion . . . not a statute," and
therefore it seems inappropriate to speak of what the Mon533US2 Unit: $U80 [11-01-02 19:17:06] PAGES PGT: OPIN

393Cite as: 533 U. S. 353 (2001)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
tana Court intended the first exception to mean in futurecases. See

ante, at 372.
State governments may enter into consensual relation-ships with tribes, such as contracts for services or shared

authority over public resources. Depending upon the na-ture of the agreement, such relationships could provide official consent to tribal regulatory jurisdiction. Some States
have formally sanctioned the creation of state-tribal agree-ments. See,

e. g., Mont. Code Ann. $ 18-11-101 et seq. (1997)
(State-Tribal Cooperative Agreements Act); Neb. Rev. Stat.$ 13-1502

et seq. (1997) (State-Tribal Cooperative Agreements Act); Okla. Stat., Tit. 74, $ 1221 (Supp. 2001) (authorizing Governor to enter into cooperative agreements on behalf
of the State to address issues of mutual interest). In addition, there are a host of cooperative agreements between
tribes and state authorities to share control over tribal
lands, to manage public services, and to provide law enforcement. See, e. g., Cal. Health & Safety Code Ann. $ 25198.1
et seq. (West 1992 and Supp. 2001) (cooperative agreements
for hazardous waste management); Cal. Pub. Res. Code Ann.

$ 44201 et seq. (West 1996) (cooperative agreements for solid
waste management); Minn. Stat. $ 626.90 et seq. (Supp. 2001)
(authorizing cooperative agreements between state law enforcement and tribal peace officers); Nev. Rev. Stat. $ 277.058
(Supp. 1999) (cooperative agreements concerning sites of
archeological or historical significance); N. M. Stat. Ann.

$ 9-11-12.1 (Supp. 2000) (cooperative agreements for tax
administration); Ore. Rev. Stat. $ 25.075 (1999) (cooperative
agreements concerning child support and paternity matters);
Wash. Rev. Code $ 26.25.010 et seq. (1999) (cooperative agreements for child welfare); $ 79.60.010 (cooperative agreements
among federal, state, and tribal governments for timber and
forest management).

Whether a consensual relationship between the Tribes and
the State existed in this case is debatable, compare Brief for

in and for the Fallon Paiute-Shoshone Tribes et al. 23-25,
but our case law provides no basis to conclude that such a
consensual relationship could never exist. Without a full
understanding of the applicable relationships among tribal,
state, and federal entities, there is no need to create a per se
rule that forecloses future debate as to whether cooperative
agreements, or other forms of official consent, could ever be
a basis for tribal jurisdiction. Compare ante, at 359, n. 3,
with ante, at 372.

The second Montana exception states that a tribe may
regulate nonmember conduct where that conduct "threatens
or has some direct effect on the political integrity, the economic security, or the health or welfare of the tribe." 450
U. S., at 566. The majority concentrates on this aspect of
Montana, asking whether "regulatory jurisdiction over state
officers in the present context is `necessary to protect tribal
self-government or to control internal relations,' " and concludes that it is not. Ante, at 360.

At the outset, the Court recites relatively uncontroversial propositions. A tribe's right to make its own laws and
be governed by them "does not exclude all state regulatory
authority on the reservation"; a reservation " `is considered
part of the territory of the State' "; "States may regulate
the activities even of tribe members on tribal land"; and the
" `process of [state] courts may run into [a] . . . reservation.' "
Ante, at 361, 362, 363 (citations omitted).

None of "these prior statements," however, "accord[s]"
with the majority's conclusion that "tribal authority to regulate state officers in executing process related to [an offreservation violation of state law] is not essential to tribal
self-government or internal relations." Ante, at 364. Our
prior decisions are informed by the understanding that
tribal, Federal, and State Governments share authority over
tribal lands. See, e. g., Cotton Petroleum Corp. v. New Mexico, 490 U. S. 163, 176-187 (1989) (concurrent jurisdiction of
state and tribal governments to impose severance taxes

on oil and gas production by nonmembers); Rice v. Rehner,463 U. S. 713 (1983) (concurrent jurisdiction of Federal and

State Governments to issue liquor licenses for transactionson reservations);

Washington v. Confederated Tribes of Colville Reservation, 447 U. S. 134 (1980) (concurrent juris-diction of state and tribal governments to tax cigarette

purchases by nonmembers). Saying that tribal jurisdiction
must "accommodat[e]" various sovereign interests does notmean that tribal interests are to be nullified through a

per se
rule. Id., at 156.The majority's rule undermining tribal interests is all the

more perplexing because the conduct in this case occurredon land owned and controlled by the Tribes. Although the
majority gives a passing nod to land status at the outsetof its opinion,

ante, at 360, that factor is not prominent in
the Court's analysis. This oversight is significant. Montana recognizes that tribes may retain inherent power to
exercise civil jurisdiction when the nonmember conduct"threatens or has some direct effect on the political integrity,

the economic security, or the health or welfare of the tribe."
450 U. S., at 566. These interests are far more likely to beimplicated where, as here, the nonmember activity takes

place on land owned and controlled by the tribe. If Montana is to bring coherence to our case law, we must apply it
with due consideration to land status, which has always figured prominently in our analysis of tribal jurisdiction. See
supra, at 388-392.

This case involves state officials acting on tribal land.
The Tribes' sovereign interests with respect to nonmember
activities on its land are not extinguished simply because
the nonmembers in this case are state officials enforcing
state law. Our cases concerning tribal power often involve
the competing interests of state, federal, and tribal governments. See, e. g., Cotton Petroleum Corp., supra; Confederated Tribes, supra; Rehner, supra. The actions of state
officials on tribal land in some instances may affect tribal
sovereign interests to a greater, not lesser, degree than the

actions of private parties. In this case, for example, it isalleged that state officers, who gained access to Hicks' property by virtue of their authority as state actors, exceededthe scope of the search warrants and damaged Hicks' personal property.Certainly, state officials should be protected from civil
liability for actions undertaken within the scope of their
duties. See infra, at 400-401. The majority, however, doesnot conclude that the officials in this case were acting within

the scope of their duties. Moreover, the majority finds it"irrelevant" that Hicks' lawsuits are against state officials in
their personal capacities. Ante, at 365. The Court instead
announces the rule that state officials "cannot be regulated
in the performance of their law enforcement duties," but
"[a]ction unrelated to that is potentially subject to tribal
control." Ante, at 373. Here, Hicks alleges that state officials exceeded the scope of their authority under the search
warrants. The Court holds that the state officials may not
be held liable in Tribal Court for these actions, but never
explains where these, or more serious allegations involving
a breach of authority, would fall within its new rule of state
official immunity.

The Court's reasoning does not reflect a faithful application of Montana and its progeny. Our case law does not
support a broad per se rule prohibiting tribal jurisdiction
over nonmembers on tribal land whenever the nonmembers
are state officials. If the Court were to remain true to the
principles that have governed in prior cases, the Court
would reverse and remand the case to the Court of Appeals
for a proper application of Montana to determine whether
there is tribal jurisdiction. Compare 196 F. 3d, at 1032-1034
(Rymer, J., dissenting) (concluding that there is no jurisdiction under Montana), with 944 F. Supp. 1455, 1466 (Nev.

Opinion of O'Connor, J.

II
The Court's sweeping analysis gives the impression thatthis case involves a conflict of great magnitude between the

State of Nevada and the Fallon Paiute-Shoshone Tribes.That is not so. At no point did the Tribes attempt to exclude the State from the reservation. At no point did theTribes attempt to obstruct state officials' efforts to secure
or execute the search warrants. Quite the contrary, the rec-ord demonstrates that judicial and law enforcement officials from the State and the Tribes acted in full cooperationto investigate an off-reservation crime.

Ante, at 355-357;944 F. Supp., at 1458-1459.

In this case, Hicks attempts to hold state officials (andtribal officials) liable for allegedly exceeding the scope of the
search warrants and damaging his personal property. Thiscase concerns the Tribes' civil

adjudicatory jurisdiction overstate officials. The Court concludes that it cannot address

adjudicatory jurisdiction without first addressing the Tribes'regulatory jurisdiction. Ante, at 357-358. But there is no
need for the Court to decide the precise scope of a tribe'sregulatory jurisdiction, or to decide in this case whether a
tribe's adjudicatory jurisdiction equals its regulatory juris-diction. Cf. ante, at 358, 373-374.

To resolve this case, it suffices to answer the questionspresented, which concern the civil adjudicatory jurisdiction
of tribal courts. See Pet. for Cert. i. Petitioners contendthat tribal court jurisdiction over state officials should be
determined with reference to officials' claims of immunity.I agree and would resolve this case by applying basic principles of official and qualified immunity.The state officials raised immunity defenses to Hicks'
claims in Tribal Court. The Tribal Court acknowledgedthe officials' claims, but did not consider the immunity defenses in determining its jurisdiction. App. to Pet. for Cert.C1-C8. The Federal District Court ruled that because the
Tribal Court had not decided the immunity issues, the fed533US2 Unit: $U80 [11-01-02 19:17:06] PAGES PGT: OPIN

eral court should stay its hand and not decide the immu-nity issues while reviewing the Tribal Court's jurisdiction.

944 F. Supp., at 1468-1469, and n. 26. The Ninth Circuitaffirmed, concluding that the District Court correctly applied the exhaustion requirement to the immunity issues.196 F. 3d, at 1029-1031. In my view, the Court of Appeals
misunderstood our precedents when it refused to consider
the state officials' immunity claims as it reviewed the TribalCourt's civil jurisdiction.

In determining the relationship between tribal courtsand state and federal courts, we have developed a doctrine
of exhaustion based on principles of comity. See, e. g., Iowa
Mut. Ins. Co. v. LaPlante, 480 U. S. 9 (1987); National Farmers Union Ins. Cos. v. Crow Tribe, 471 U. S. 845 (1985). In
National Farmers Union, a member of the Tribe sued the
local school district, an arm of the State, in a personal injury
action. Id., at 847. The defendants sued in federal court
challenging the Tribal Court's jurisdiction. The District
Court concluded that the Tribal Court lacked jurisdiction and enjoined the Tribal Court proceedings. The Court
of Appeals reversed, holding that the District Court lacked
jurisdiction to enter the injunction.

We reversed the Court of Appeals' conclusion that the
District Court lacked jurisdiction over the federal action.
We explained that the "extent to which Indian tribes have
retained the power to regulate the affairs of non-Indians" is
governed by federal law. Id., at 851-852. Likewise, "[t]he
question whether an Indian tribe retains the power to compel a non-Indian property owner to submit to the civil jurisdiction of a tribal court is one that must be answered by
reference to federal law," and therefore district courts may
determine under 28 U. S. C. $ 1331 whether a tribal court
has exceeded the lawful limits of its jurisdiction. 471 U. S.,
at 852.

We refused to foreclose entirely the civil jurisdiction of
tribal courts over nonmembers as we had foreclosed inherent

criminal jurisdiction over nonmembers in Oliphant v. Suquamish Tribe, 435 U. S. 191 (1978). See National Farmers,
471 U. S., at 854-855. Instead, we reasoned that "the ex-istence and extent of a tribal court's jurisdiction will require

a careful examination of tribal sovereignty, the extent towhich that sovereignty has been altered, divested, or diminished, as well as a detailed study of relevant statutes, Executive Branch policy as embodied in treaties and elsewhere,and administrative or judicial decisions."

Id., at 855-856
(footnote omitted). We concluded that this "examinationshould be conducted in the first instance in the Tribal Court

itself," and that a federal court should "sta[y] its hand" until
after the tribal court has had opportunity to determine its
own jurisdiction. Id., at 856-857.

In Iowa Mutual, an insurance company sued members of
a Tribe in federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction;
at the same time, a civil lawsuit by the tribal members was
pending against the nonmember insurance company in Tribal
Court. 480 U. S., at 11-13. The District Court granted the
tribal members' motion to dismiss the federal action for lack
of jurisdiction on the ground that the Tribal Court should
have had the first opportunity to determine its jurisdiction.
The Court of Appeals affirmed.

We reversed and remanded. We made clear that the
Tribal Court should be given the first opportunity to determine its jurisdiction, but emphasized that "[e]xhaustion is
required as a matter of comity, not as a jurisdictional prerequisite." Id., at 16-17, and n. 8. We explained that tribal
court remedies must be exhausted, but the tribal court's
"determination of tribal jurisdiction is ultimately subject to
review," and may be challenged in district court. Id., at 19.

Later, in Strate, "we reiterate[d] that National Farmers
and Iowa Mutual enunciate only an exhaustion requirement, a prudential rule, based on comity." 520 U. S., at 453

400 NEVADA v. HICKS

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
(1999). Application of that principle in this case leads me toconclude that the District Court and the Court of Appeals

should have considered the state officials' immunity claimsas they determined the Tribal Court's jurisdiction.

The doctrines of official immunity, see, e. g., Westfall v.
Erwin, 484 U. S. 292, 296-300 (1988), and qualified immunity,
see, e. g., Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, 813-819 (1982),
are designed to protect state and federal officials from civilliability for conduct that was within the scope of their duties or conduct that did not violate clearly established law.These doctrines short-circuit civil litigation for officials who
meet these standards so that these officials are not subjected to the costs of trial or the burdens of discovery. 457
U. S., at 817-818. For example, the Federal Employees Liability Reform and Tort Compensation Act of 1988, commonly
known as the Westfall Act, allows the United States to
substitute itself for a federal employee as defendant upon
certifying that the employee was acting within the scope of
his duties. 28 U. S. C. $ 2679(d). Nevada law contains analogous provisions. See Nev. Rev. Stat. $$ 41.032, 41.0335-
41.0339 (1996 and Supp. 1999). The employee who successfully claims official immunity therefore invokes the immunity of the sovereign. When a state or federal official
asserts qualified immunity, he claims that his actions were
reasonable in light of clearly established law. Anderson v.
Creighton, 483 U. S. 635 (1987). In those cases, we allow
that official to take an immediate interlocutory appeal from
an adverse ruling to ensure that the civil proceedings do
not continue if immunity should be granted. Mitchell v.
Forsyth, 472 U. S. 511, 524-530 (1985).

In this case, the state officials raised their immunity defenses in Tribal Court as they challenged that court's subject matter jurisdiction. App. to Pet. for Cert. J5- J6, K8,
K11-K13; 196 F. 3d, at 1029-1031. Thus the Tribal Court
and the Appellate Tribal Court had a full opportunity to
address the immunity claims. These defendants, like other

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
officials facing civil liability, were entitled to have their
immunity defenses adjudicated at the earliest stage possible to avoid needless litigation. It requires no "magic" to
afford officials the same protection in tribal court that they
would be afforded in state or federal court. Ante, at 373.
I would therefore reverse the Court of Appeals in this case
on the ground that it erred in failing to address the state
officials' immunity defenses. It is possible that Hicks' lawsuits would have been easily disposed of on the basis of official and qualified immunity.

* * *
The Court issues a broad holding that significantly alters
the principles that govern determinations of tribal adjudicatory and regulatory jurisdiction. While I agree that
Montana guides our analysis, I do not believe that the Court
has properly applied Montana. I would not adopt a per se
rule of tribal jurisdiction that fails to consider adequately
the Tribes' inherent sovereign interests in activities on their
land, nor would I give nonmembers freedom to act with impunity on tribal land based solely on their status as state
law enforcement officials. I would hold that Montana governs a tribe's civil jurisdiction over nonmembers, and that
in order to protect government officials, immunity claims
should be considered in reviewing tribal court jurisdiction.
Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment of the United
States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and remand
the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Breyer joins,

While I join the Court's disposition of the case for the reasons stated by Justice O'Connor, I do not agree with the
Court's conclusion that tribal courts may not exercise their
jurisdiction over claims seeking the relief authorized by 42

402 NEVADA v. HICKS

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
U. S. C. $ 1983.1 I agree instead with the Solicitor General's
submission that a tribal court may entertain such a claim
unless enjoined from doing so by a federal court. See Brief
for United States as Amicus Curiae 24-30.

The majority's analysis of this question is exactly backwards. It appears to start from the assumption that tribal
courts do not have jurisdiction to hear federal claims unless
federal law expressly grants them the power, see ante, at
367-368, and then concludes that, because no such express
grant of power has occurred with respect to $ 1983, tribal
courts must lack the authority to adjudicate those claims.
Ante, at 368 ("[N]o provision in federal law provides for
tribal-court jurisdiction over $ 1983 actions"). But the
Court's initial assumption is deeply flawed. Absent federal
law to the contrary, the question whether tribal courts are
courts of general jurisdiction is fundamentally one of tribal
law. Cf. Gulf Offshore Co. v. Mobil Oil Corp., 453 U. S. 473,
478 (1981) (State-court subject-matter jurisdiction is "gov1 As an initial matter, it is not at all clear to me that the Court's discussion of the $ 1983 issue is necessary to the disposition of this case. Strate
v. A-1 Contractors, 520 U. S. 438 (1997), discusses the question whether a
tribal court can exercise jurisdiction over nonmembers, irrespective of the
type of claim being raised. See id., at 459, n. 14 ("When . . . it is plain that
no federal grant provides for tribal governance of nonmembers' conduct on
land covered by [the main rule in] Montana [v. United States, 450 U. S.
544 (1981)], . . . it will be equally evident that tribal courts lack adjudicatory authority over disputes arising from such conduct"). Cf. El Paso
Natural Gas Co. v. Neztsosie, 526 U. S. 473, 482, n. 4 (1999) ("Strate dealt
with claims against nonmembers arising on state highways, and `express[ed] no view on the governing law or proper forum when an accident
occurs on a tribal road within a reservation' "). Given the majority's determination in Part II that tribal courts lack such jurisdiction over "state
wardens executing a search warrant for evidence of an off-reservation
crime," ante, at 357, I fail to see why the Court needs to reach out to
discuss the seemingly hypothetical question whether, if the tribal courts
had jurisdiction over claims against "state wardens executing a search
warrant," they could hear $ 1983 claims against those wardens.

erned in the first instance by state laws" (emphasis added)).2Given a tribal assertion of general subject-matter jurisdiction, we should recognize a tribe's authority to adjudicateclaims arising under $ 1983 unless federal law dictates otherwise. Cf. id., at 477-478 ("[S]tate courts may assumesubject-matter jurisdiction over a federal cause of action
absent provision by Congress to the contrary or disablingincompatibility between the federal claim and state-court
adjudication").3I see no compelling reason of federal law to deny tribal
courts the authority, if they have jurisdiction over the par2 This principle is not based upon any mystical attribute of sovereignty,
as the majority suggests, see ante, at 366-367, but rather upon the simple,
commonsense notion that it is the body creating a court that determines
what sorts of claims that court will hear. The questions whether that
court has the power to compel anyone to listen to it and whether its assertion of subject-matter jurisdiction conflicts with some higher law are separate issues.

3 The majority claims that "Strate is [the] `federal law to the contrary' "

that explains its restriction of tribal court subject-matter jurisdiction
over $ 1983 suits. Ante, at 367, n. 8. But Strate merely concerned the
circumstances under which tribal courts can exert jurisdiction over claims
against nonmembers. See 520 U. S., at 447-448. It most certainly does
not address the question whether, assuming such jurisdiction to exist,
tribal courts can entertain $ 1983 suits. Yet the majority's holding that
tribal courts lack subject-matter jurisdiction over $ 1983 suits would, presumably, bar those courts from hearing such claims even if jurisdiction
over nonmembers would be proper under Strate. Accordingly, whatever
else Strate may do, it does not supply the proposition of federal law upon
which the majority purports to rely.

Of course, if the majority, as it suggests, is merely holding that $ 1983
does not enlarge tribal jurisdiction beyond what is permitted by Strate,
its decision today is far more limited than it might first appear from the
Court's sometimes sweeping language. Compare ante, at 369 ("[T]ribal
courts cannot entertain $ 1983 suits"), with ante, at 366, n. 7 ("We conclude
(as we must) that $ 1983 is not . . . an enlargement [of tribal-court jurisdiction]"). After all, if the Court's holding is that $ 1983 merely fails to "enlarg[e]" tribal-court jurisdiction, then nothing would prevent tribal courts
from deciding $ 1983 claims in cases in which they properly exercise jurisdiction under Strate.

ties, to decide claims arising under $ 1983. Section 1983 cre-ates no new substantive rights, see Chapman v. Houston

Welfare Rights Organization, 441 U. S. 600, 617 (1979); itmerely provides a federal cause of action for the violation of
federal rights that are independently established either inthe Federal Constitution or in federal statutory law. Despite the absence of any mention of state courts in $ 1983,we have never questioned the jurisdiction of such courts to
provide the relief it authorizes.4Moreover, as our decision in

El Paso Natural Gas Co. v.Neztsosie, 526 U. S. 473 (1999), demonstrates, the absence

of an express statutory provision for removal to a federalcourt upon the motion of the defendant provides no obstacle
whatsoever to the granting of equivalent relief by a federaldistrict court. See id., at 485 ("Injunction against further
litigation in tribal courts would in practical terms give thesame result as a removal . . ."). "Why, then, the congressional silence on tribal courts? . . . [I]nadvertence seemsthe most likely [explanation] . . . . Now and then silence is
not pregnant." Id., at 487. There is really no more reasonfor treating the silence in $ 1983 concerning tribal courts as
an objection to tribal-court jurisdiction over such claims thanthere is for treating its silence concerning state courts as
an objection to state-court jurisdiction.In sum, I agree with the interpretation of this federal
statute that is endorsed by the Solicitor General of theUnited States.

4 The authority of state courts to hear $ 1983 suits was not always
so uncontroversial. See, e. g., Note, Limiting the Section 1983 Action in
the Wake of Monroe v. Pape, 82 Harv. L. Rev. 1486, 1497, n. 62 (1969)
("State courts have puzzlingly hesitated on whether they have jurisdiction
over $ 1983 claims as such, and no case has been found in which a state
court granted relief under the section. In one case a state supreme court
adopted the expedient of disavowing a position on jurisdiction while denying recovery on the merits").

UNITED STATES et al. v. UNITED FOODS, INC.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe sixth circuit

No. 00-276. Argued April 17, 2001--Decided June 25, 2001
The Mushroom Promotion, Research, and Consumer Information Act mandates that fresh mushroom handlers pay assessments used primarily to
fund advertisements promoting mushroom sales. Respondent refused
to pay the assessment, claiming that it violates the First Amendment.
It filed a petition challenging the assessment with the Secretary of
Agriculture, and the United States filed an enforcement action in
the District Court. After the administrative appeal was denied, respondent sought review in the District Court, which consolidated the
two cases. In granting the Government summary judgment, the court
found dispositive the decision in Glickman v. Wileman Brothers &
Elliott, Inc., 521 U. S. 457, that the First Amendment was not violated
when agricultural marketing orders, as part of a larger regulatory marketing scheme, required producers of California tree fruit to pay assessments for product advertising. The Sixth Circuit reversed, holding
that Glickman did not control because the mandated payments in this
case were not part of a comprehensive statutory agricultural marketing program.

Held: The assessment requirement violates the First Amendment.

Pp. 409-417.

(a) Even viewing the expression here as commercial speech, there
is no basis under Glickman or this Court's other precedents to sustain
the assessments. The First Amendment may prevent the government
from, inter alia, compelling individuals to pay subsidies for speech
to which they object. See Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed., 431 U. S. 209;
Keller v. State Bar of Cal., 496 U. S. 1. Such precedents provide the
beginning point for analysis here. Respondent wants to convey the
message that its brand of mushrooms is superior to those grown by
other producers, and it objects to being charged for a contrary message
which seems to be favored by a majority of producers. First Amendment values are at serious risk if the government can compel a citizen
or group of citizens to subsidize speech on the side that it favors;
and there is no apparent principle distinguishing out of hand minor debates about whether a branded mushroom is better than just any mushroom. Thus, the compelled funding here must pass First Amendment
scrutiny. Pp. 409-411.

406 UNITED STATES v. UNITED FOODS, INC.

Syllabus
(b) The program sustained in Glickman differs from the one at issue
here in a fundamental respect: The mandated assessments for speech
in that case were ancillary to a more comprehensive program restricting marketing autonomy. This Court stressed in Glickman that the
entire regulatory program must be considered in resolving a case.
There, California tree fruits were marketed under detailed marketing
orders that had displaced competition to such an extent that they
had an antitrust exemption; the Court presumed that the producers
compelled to contribute funds for cooperative advertising were bound
together and required by statute to market their products according to
cooperative rules. Those important features are not present here.
Most of the funds at issue are used for generic advertising; and there
are no marketing orders regulating mushroom production and sales,
no antitrust exemption, and nothing preventing individual producers
from making their own marketing decisions. Mushroom growers are
not forced to associate as a group that makes cooperative decisions.
Although respondent is required simply to support speech by others,
not to utter speech itself, that mandated support is contrary to the First
Amendment principles set forth in cases involving expression by groups
which include persons who object to the speech but, nevertheless, must
remain group members by law or necessity. See, e. g., Abood, supra;
Keller, supra. Properly applied, Abood's rule protecting against compelled assessments for some speech requires this scheme to be invalidated. Before addressing whether a conflict with freedom of belief exists, the threshold inquiry must be whether there is some state
imposed obligation making group membership less than voluntary; for
it is only the overriding associational purpose which allows any compelled subsidy for speech in the first place. In Abood, Keller, and
Glickman, the objecting members were required to associate for purposes other than the compelled subsidies for speech. Here, however,
the only program the Government contends the assessments serve is
the very advertising scheme in question. Were it sufficient to say
speech is germane to itself, Abood's and Keller's limits would be empty
of meaning and significance. No corollary to Glickman's cooperative
marketing structure exists here; the expression respondent is required
to support is not germane to an association's purpose independent from
the speech itself; and Abood's rationale extends to the party who objects
to the compelled support for this speech. There is also no suggestion
here that the assessments are necessary to make voluntary advertisements nonmisleading for consumers. Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme Court of Ohio, 471 U. S. 626, distinguished.

Four Terms ago, in Glickman v. Wileman Brothers & Elliott, Inc., 521 U. S. 457 (1997), the Court rejected a FirstAmendment challenge to the constitutionality of a series of

agricultural marketing orders that, as part of a larger regu-latory marketing scheme, required producers of certain California tree fruit to pay assessments for product advertising.In this case a federal statute mandates assessments on handlers of fresh mushrooms to fund advertising for the product.The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit determined the
mandated payments were not part of a more comprehensivestatutory program for agricultural marketing, thus dictating
a different result than in Glickman. It held the assessmentrequirement unconstitutional, and we granted certiorari.
531 U. S. 1009 (2000).The statute in question, enacted by Congress in 1990, is
the Mushroom Promotion, Research, and Consumer Informa-tion Act, 104 Stat. 3854, 7 U. S. C. $ 6101

et seq. The Actauthorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a Mushroom Council to pursue the statute's goals. Mushroom pro-ducers and importers, as defined by the statute, submit nominations from among their group to the Secretary, who then
designates the Council membership. 7 U. S. C. $$ 6104(b)(1)(B), 6102(6), 6102(11). To fund its programs, the Act

allows the Council to impose mandatory assessments uponhandlers of fresh mushrooms in an amount not to exceed
one cent per pound of mushrooms produced or imported.$ 6104(g)(2). The assessments can be used for "projects
of mushroom promotion, research, consumer information,and industry information." $ 6104(c)(4). It is undisputed,
though, that most moneys raised by the assessments arespent for generic advertising to promote mushroom sales.

Respondent United Foods, Inc., is a large agricultural en-terprise based in Tennessee. It grows and distributes many
crops and products, including fresh mushrooms. In 1996 respondent refused to pay its mandatory assessments under

Opinion of the Court
the Act. The forced subsidy for generic advertising, it con-tended, is a violation of the First Amendment. Respondent

challenged the assessments in a petition filed with the Secre-tary. The United States filed an action in the United States
District Court for the Western District of Tennessee, seek-ing an order compelling respondent to pay. Both matters
were stayed pending this Court's decision in Glickman.

After Glickman was decided, the Administrative LawJudge dismissed respondent's petition, and the Judicial Officer of the Department of Agriculture affirmed. Respondentsought review in District Court, and its suit was consolidated
with the Government's enforcement action. The District
Court, holding Glickman dispositive of the First Amendment challenge, granted the Government's motion for summary judgment. App. to Pet. for Cert. 18a.

The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held this case is
not controlled by Glickman and reversed the District Court.
197 F. 3d 221 (1999). We agree with the Court of Appeals
and now affirm.

A quarter of a century ago, the Court held that commercial
speech, usually defined as speech that does no more than
propose a commercial transaction, is protected by the First
Amendment. Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U. S. 748, 762 (1976).
"The commercial marketplace, like other spheres of our
social and cultural life, provides a forum where ideas and
information flourish." Edenfield v. Fane, 507 U. S. 761, 767
(1993).

We have used standards for determining the validity of
speech regulations which accord less protection to commercial speech than to other expression. See, e. g., ibid.; Central Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of
N. Y., 447 U. S. 557 (1980). That approach, in turn, has been
subject to some criticism. See, e. g., Glickman, supra, at
504 (Thomas, J., dissenting); 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode
Island, 517 U. S. 484, 518 (1996) (Thomas, J., concurring in

Opinion of the Court
part and concurring in judgment); Rubin v. Coors Brewing
Co., 514 U. S. 476, 493 (1995) (Stevens, J., concurring in
judgment). We need not enter into the controversy, foreven viewing commercial speech as entitled to lesser protection, we find no basis under either Glickman or our otherprecedents to sustain the compelled assessments sought in
this case. It should be noted, moreover, that the Government itself does not rely upon Central Hudson to challengethe Court of Appeals' decision, Reply Brief for Petitioners 9,

n. 7, and we therefore do not consider whether the Govern-ment's interest could be considered substantial for purposes
of the Central Hudson test. The question is whether the
government may underwrite and sponsor speech with a certain viewpoint using special subsidies exacted from a designated class of persons, some of whom object to the idea
being advanced.

Just as the First Amendment may prevent the government from prohibiting speech, the Amendment may prevent
the government from compelling individuals to express certain views, see Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U. S. 705, 714 (1977);
West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624 (1943), or
from compelling certain individuals to pay subsidies for
speech to which they object. See Abood v. Detroit Bd. of
Ed., 431 U. S. 209 (1977); Keller v. State Bar of Cal., 496
U. S. 1 (1990); see also Glickman, supra, at 469, n. 13. Our

precedents concerning compelled contributions to speech
provide the beginning point for our analysis. The fact that
the speech is in aid of a commercial purpose does not deprive
respondent of all First Amendment protection, as held in the
cases already cited. The subject matter of the speech may
be of interest to but a small segment of the population; yet
those whose business and livelihood depend in some way
upon the product involved no doubt deem First Amendment
protection to be just as important for them as it is for other
discrete, little noticed groups in a society which values the
freedom resulting from speech in all its diverse parts. First

Opinion of the Court
Amendment concerns apply here because of the requirement
that producers subsidize speech with which they disagree.

"[T]he general rule is that the speaker and the audience,
not the government, assess the value of the information presented." Edenfield, supra, at 767. There are some instances in which compelled subsidies for speech contradict
that constitutional principle. Here the disagreement could
be seen as minor: Respondent wants to convey the message
that its brand of mushrooms is superior to those grown by
other producers. It objects to being charged for a message
which seems to be favored by a majority of producers. The
message is that mushrooms are worth consuming whether or
not they are branded. First Amendment values are at serious risk if the government can compel a particular citizen,
or a discrete group of citizens, to pay special subsidies for
speech on the side that it favors; and there is no apparent
principle which distinguishes out of hand minor debates
about whether a branded mushroom is better than just any
mushroom. As a consequence, the compelled funding for the
advertising must pass First Amendment scrutiny.

In the Government's view the assessment in this case is
permitted by Glickman because it is similar in important
respects. It imposes no restraint on the freedom of an objecting party to communicate its own message; the program
does not compel an objecting party (here a corporate entity)
itself to express views it disfavors; and the mandated scheme
does not compel the expression of political or ideological
views. See Glickman, 521 U. S., at 469-470. These points
were noted in Glickman in the context of a different type of
regulatory scheme and are not controlling of the outcome.
The program sustained in Glickman differs from the one
under review in a most fundamental respect. In Glickman
the mandated assessments for speech were ancillary to a
more comprehensive program restricting marketing autonomy. Here, for all practical purposes, the advertising itself,

533US2 Unit: $U81 [10-19-02 13:58:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN
412 UNITED STATES v. UNITED FOODS, INC.

Opinion of the Court
far from being ancillary, is the principal object of the regula-tory scheme.

In Glickman we stressed from the very outset that theentire regulatory program must be considered in resolving
the case. In deciding that case we emphasized "the impor-tance of the statutory context in which it arises."

Id., at
469. The California tree fruits were marketed "pursuant to
detailed marketing orders that ha[d] displaced many aspectsof independent business activity."

Id., at 469. Indeed, the
marketing orders "displaced competition" to such an extentthat they were "expressly exempted from the antitrust

laws." Id., at 461. The market for the tree fruit regulated
by the program was characterized by "[c]ollective action,
rather than the aggregate consequences of independent competitive choices." Ibid. The producers of tree fruit who
were compelled to contribute funds for use in cooperative
advertising "d[id] so as a part of a broader collective enterprise in which their freedom to act independently [wa]s
already constrained by the regulatory scheme." Id., at 469.
The opinion and the analysis of the Court proceeded upon
the premise that the producers were bound together and required by the statute to market their products according to
cooperative rules. To that extent, their mandated participation in an advertising program with a particular message
was the logical concomitant of a valid scheme of economic
regulation.

The features of the marketing scheme found important in
Glickman are not present in the case now before us. As
respondent notes, and as the Government does not contest,
cf. Brief for Petitioners 25, almost all of the funds collected
under the mandatory assessments are for one purpose: generic advertising. Beyond the collection and disbursement
of advertising funds, there are no marketing orders that regulate how mushrooms may be produced and sold, no exemption from the antitrust laws, and nothing preventing individual producers from making their own marketing decisions.

413Cite as: 533 U. S. 405 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
As the Court of Appeals recognized, there is no "heavy regu-lation through marketing orders" in the mushroom market.

197 F. 3d, at 225. Mushroom producers are not forced toassociate as a group which makes cooperative decisions.
"[T]he mushroom growing business . . . is unregulated, ex-cept for the enforcement of a regional mushroom advertising
program," and "the mushroom market has not been collectivized, exempted from antitrust laws, subjected to a uniformprice, or otherwise subsidized through price supports or restrictions on supply." Id., at 222, 223.It is true that the party who protests the assessment here
is required simply to support speech by others, not to utter
the speech itself. We conclude, however, that the mandated
support is contrary to the First Amendment principles set
forth in cases involving expression by groups which include
persons who object to the speech, but who, nevertheless,
must remain members of the group by law or necessity.
See, e. g., Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed., 431 U. S. 209 (1977);
Keller v. State Bar of Cal., 496 U. S. 1 (1990).

The Government claims that, despite the lack of cooperative marketing, the Abood rule protecting against compelled
assessments for some speech is inapplicable. We did say in
Glickman that Abood "recognized a First Amendment interest in not being compelled to contribute to an organization
whose expressive activities conflict with one's `freedom of
belief.' " 521 U. S., at 471 (quoting Abood, 431 U. S., at 235).
We take further instruction, however, from Abood's statement that speech need not be characterized as political before it receives First Amendment protection. Id., at 232.
A proper application of the rule in Abood requires us to invalidate the instant statutory scheme. Before addressing
whether a conflict with freedom of belief exists, a threshold
inquiry must be whether there is some state imposed obligation which makes group membership less than voluntary; for
it is only the overriding associational purpose which allows
any compelled subsidy for speech in the first place. In

533US2 Unit: $U81 [10-19-02 13:58:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN
414 UNITED STATES v. UNITED FOODS, INC.

Opinion of the Court
Abood, the infringement upon First Amendment associa-tional rights worked by a union shop arrangement was "constitutionally justified by the legislative assessment of the im-portant contribution of the union shop to the system of labor
relations established by Congress." Id., at 222. To attainthe desired benefit of collective bargaining, union members
and nonmembers were required to associate with one another, and the legitimate purposes of the group were fur-thered by the mandated association.

A similar situation obtained in Keller v. State Bar of Cal.,
supra. A state-mandated, integrated bar sought to ensure
that "all of the lawyers who derive benefit from the unique
status of being among those admitted to practice before the
courts [were] called upon to pay a fair share of the cost."
Id., at 12. Lawyers could be required to pay moneys in support of activities that were germane to the reason justifying
the compelled association in the first place, for example, expenditures (including expenditures for speech) that related
to "activities connected with disciplining members of the Bar
or proposing ethical codes for the profession." Id., at 16.
Those who were required to pay a subsidy for the speech of
the association already were required to associate for other
purposes, making the compelled contribution of moneys to
pay for expressive activities a necessary incident of a larger
expenditure for an otherwise proper goal requiring the cooperative activity. The central holding in Keller, moreover,
was that the objecting members were not required to give
speech subsidies for matters not germane to the larger regulatory purpose which justified the required association.

The situation was much the same in Glickman. As noted
above, the market for tree fruit was cooperative. To proceed, the statutory scheme used marketing orders that to a
large extent deprived producers of their ability to compete
and replaced competition with a regime of cooperation. The
mandated cooperation was judged by Congress to be necessary to maintain a stable market. Given that producers

Opinion of the Court
were bound together in the common venture, the impositionupon their First Amendment rights caused by using compelled contributions for germane advertising was, as in
Abood and Keller, in furtherance of an otherwise legitimate
program. Though four Justices who join this opinion dis-agreed, the majority of the Court in

Glickman found the
compelled contributions were nothing more than additional
economic regulation, which did not raise First Amendmentconcerns.

Glickman, 521 U. S., at 474; see id., at 477 (Souter, J., dissenting).The statutory mechanism as it relates to handlers of mushrooms is concededly different from the scheme in Glickman;
here the statute does not require group action, save to generate the very speech to which some handlers object. In contrast to the program upheld in Glickman, where the Government argued the compelled contributions for advertising
were "part of a far broader regulatory system that does not
principally concern speech," Reply Brief for Petitioner, O. T.
1996, No. 95-1184, p. 4, there is no broader regulatory system
in place here. We have not upheld compelled subsidies for
speech in the context of a program where the principal object
is speech itself. Although greater regulation of the mushroom market might have been implemented under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, 50 Stat. 246, 7
U. S. C. $ 601 et seq., the compelled contributions for advertising are not part of some broader regulatory scheme. The
only program the Government contends the compelled contributions serve is the very advertising scheme in question.
Were it sufficient to say speech is germane to itself, the limits
observed in Abood and Keller would be empty of meaning
and significance. The cooperative marketing structure relied upon by a majority of the Court in Glickman to sustain
an ancillary assessment finds no corollary here; the expression respondent is required to support is not germane to a
purpose related to an association independent from the
speech itself; and the rationale of Abood extends to the party

Opinion of the Court
who objects to the compelled support for this speech. Forthese and other reasons we have set forth, the assessments

are not permitted under the First Amendment.Our conclusions are not inconsistent with the Court's decision in Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme Court of Ohio, 471 U. S. 626 (1985), a case involving
attempts by a State to prohibit certain voluntary advertising
by licensed attorneys. The Court invalidated the restric-tions in substantial part but did permit a rule requiring that

attorneys who advertised by their own choice and who re-ferred to contingent fees should disclose that clients might
be liable for costs. Noting that substantial numbers of potential clients might be misled by omission of the explanation, the Court sustained the requirement as consistent with
the State's interest in "preventing deception of consumers."
Id., at 651. There is no suggestion in the case now before
us that the mandatory assessments imposed to require one
group of private persons to pay for speech by others are
somehow necessary to make voluntary advertisements nonmisleading for consumers.

The Government argues the advertising here is government speech, and so immune from the scrutiny we would
otherwise apply. As the Government admits in a forthright
manner, however, this argument was "not raised or addressed" in the Court of Appeals. Brief for Petitioners 32,
n. 19. The Government, citing Lebron v. National Railroad
Passenger Corporation, 513 U. S. 374 (1995), suggests that
the question is embraced within the question set forth in the
petition for certiorari. In Lebron, the theory presented by
the petitioner in the brief on the merits was addressed by
the court whose judgment was being reviewed. Id., at 379.
Here, by contrast, it is undisputed that the Court of Appeals
did not mention the government speech theory now put forward for our consideration.

The Government's failure to raise its argument in the
Court of Appeals deprived respondent of the ability to ad533US2 Unit: $U81 [10-19-02 13:58:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Stevens, J., concurring
dress significant matters that might have been difficultpoints for the Government. For example, although the Government asserts that advertising is subject to approval bythe Secretary of Agriculture, respondent claims the approval
is pro forma. This and other difficult issues would have tobe addressed were the program to be labeled, and sustained,
as government speech.

We need not address the question, however. Although insome instances we have allowed a respondent to defend a

judgment on grounds other than those pressed or passedupon below, see,

e. g., United States v. Estate of Romani, 523
U. S. 517, 526, n. 11 (1998), it is quite a different matter toallow a petitioner to assert new substantive arguments attacking, rather than defending, the judgment when those arguments were not pressed in the court whose opinion we are
reviewing, or at least passed upon by it. Just this Term we
declined an invitation by an amicus to entertain new arguments to overturn a judgment, see Lopez v. Davis, 531 U. S.
230, 244, n. 6 (2001), and we consider it the better course to
decline a party's suggestion for doing so in this case.

For the reasons we have discussed, the judgment of the
Court of Appeals is

Affirmed.

Justice Stevens, concurring.
Justice Breyer has correctly noted that the program
at issue in this case, like that in Glickman v. Wileman Brothers & Elliott, Inc., 521 U. S. 457 (1997), "does not compel
speech itself; it compels the payment of money." Post, at
425 (dissenting opinion). This fact suffices to distinguish
these compelled subsidies from the compelled speech in cases
like West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624
(1943), and Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U. S. 705 (1977). It does
not follow, however, that the First Amendment is not implicated when a person is forced to subsidize speech to which
he objects. Keller v. State Bar of Cal., 496 U. S. 1, 13-14

(1990). As we held in Glickman, Keller, and a number ofother cases, such a compelled subsidy is permissible when

it is ancillary, or "germane," to a valid cooperative endeavor.The incremental impact on the liberty of a person who has
already surrendered far greater liberty to the collectiveentity (either voluntarily or as a result of permissible compulsion) does not, in my judgment, raise a significant con-stitutional issue if it is ancillary to the main purpose of the
collective program.This case, however, raises the open question whether
such compulsion is constitutional when nothing more thancommercial advertising is at stake. The naked imposition
of such compulsion, like a naked restraint on speech itself,seems quite different to me.* We need not decide whether
other interests, such as the health or artistic concerns men-tioned by

Justice Breyer, post, at 428, might justify a com-pelled subsidy like this, but surely the interest in making

one entrepreneur finance advertising for the benefit of hiscompetitors, including some who are not required to contribute, is insufficient.

Justice Thomas, concurring.
I agree with the Court that Glickman v. Wileman Broth-ers & Elliott, Inc., 521 U. S. 457 (1997), is not controlling.

I write separately, however, to reiterate my views that"paying money for the purposes of advertising involves
speech," and that "compelling speech raises a First Amend*The Court has held that the First Amendment is implicated by government regulation of contributions and expenditures for political purposes. Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1 (1976) (per curiam). Although it by
no means follows that the reasoning in such cases would apply to the regulation of expenditures for advertising, I think it clear that government
compulsion to finance objectionable speech imposes a greater restraint on
liberty than government regulation of money used to subsidize the speech
of others. Even in the commercial speech context, I think it entirely
proper for the Court to rely on the First Amendment when evaluating the
significance of such compulsion.

(Thomas, J., dissenting). Any regulation that compels the
funding of advertising must be subjected to the most stringent First Amendment scrutiny.

Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins,
and with whom Justice O'Connor joins as to Parts I and
III, dissenting.

The Court, in my view, disregards controlling precedent,
fails properly to analyze the strength of the relevant regulatory and commercial speech interests, and introduces into
First Amendment law an unreasoned legal principle that
may well pose an obstacle to the development of beneficial
forms of economic regulation. I consequently dissent.

I
Only four years ago this Court considered a case very
similar to this one, Glickman v. Wileman Brothers & Elliott,
Inc., 521 U. S. 457 (1997). The issue there, like here, was
whether the First Amendment prohibited the Government
from collecting a fee for collective product advertising from
an objecting grower of those products (nectarines, peaches,
and plums). We held that the collection of the fee did not
"rais[e] a First Amendment issue for us to resolve," but
rather was "simply a question of economic policy for Congress and the Executive to resolve." Id., at 468. We gave
the following reasons in support of our conclusion:

"First, the marketing orders impose no restraint on the
freedom of any producer to communicate any message
to any audience. Second, they do not compel any person to engage in any actual or symbolic speech. Third,
they do not compel the producers to endorse or to finance any political or ideological views." Id., at 469-

Breyer, J., dissenting
This case, although it involves mushrooms rather than fruit,is identical in each of these three critical respects. No one,

including the Court, claims otherwise. And I believe thesesimilar characteristics demand a similar conclusion.

The Court sees an important difference in what it saysis the fact that

Wileman's fruit producers were subject to
regulation (presumably price and supply regulation) that
" `displaced competition,' " to the "extent that they were `ex-pressly exempted from the antitrust laws.' "

Ante, at 412
(quoting 521 U. S., at 461). The mushroom producers here,it says, are not " `subjected to a uniform price, . . . restrictio[n] on supply,' " ante, at 413 (quoting 197 F. 3d 221,
222, 223 (CA6 1999)), or any other "common venture" that
"depriv[es]" them of the "ability to compete," ante, at 414.
And it characterizes this difference as "fundamental."
Ante, at 411.

But the record indicates that the difference to which the
Court points could not have been critical. The Court in
Wileman did not refer to the presence of price or output
regulations. It referred to the fact that Congress had "authorized" that kind of regulation. 521 U. S., at 462 (emphasis added). See also id., at 461 (citing agricultural marketing statute while noting that marketing orders issued under
its authority "may include" price and quantity controls (emphasis added)). Both then-existing federal regulations and
Justice Souter's dissenting opinion make clear that, at
least in respect to some of Wileman's marketing orders,
price and output regulations, while "authorized," were not,
in fact, in place. See 7 CFR pts. 916, 917 (1997) (setting
forth container, packaging, grade, and size regulations, but
not price and output regulations); 521 U. S., at 500, n. 13
(Souter, J., dissenting) (noting that "the extent to which
the Act eliminates competition varies among different marketing orders"). In this case, just as in Wileman, the Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to promulgate price
and supply regulations. See ante, at 415 ("greater regula533US2 Unit: $U81 [10-19-02 13:58:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tion of the mushroom market might have been implementedunder the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937");

7 U. S. C. $$ 608c(2), (6)(A), (7). But in neither case has sheactually done so. Perhaps that is why the Court in

Wileman did not rely heavily upon the existence of the Secre-tary's authority to regulate prices or output. See 521 U. S.,

at 469 (noting statutory scheme in passing).

Regardless, it is difficult to understand why the presenceor absence of price and output regulations could make a

critical First Amendment difference. The Court says thatcollective fruit advertising (unlike mushroom advertising)
was the "logical concomitant" of the more comprehensive
"economic" regulatory "scheme." Ante, at 412. But it does
not explain how that could be so. Producer price-fixing
schemes seek to keep prices higher than market conditions
might otherwise dictate, as do restrictions on supply. Antitrust exemptions are a "logical concomitant," for otherwise the price or output agreement might be held unlawful.
But collective advertising has no obvious comparable connection. As far as Wileman or the record here suggests,
collective advertising might, or might not, help bring about
prices higher than market conditions would otherwise dictate. Certainly nothing in Wileman suggests the contrary.
Cf. 521 U. S., at 477 (Souter, J., dissenting) (criticizing the
Court for not requiring advertising program to be "reasonably necessary to implement the regulation").

By contrast, the advertising here relates directly, not in an
incidental or subsidiary manner, to the regulatory program's
underlying goal of "maintain[ing] and expand[ing] existing
markets and uses for mushrooms." 7 U. S. C. $ 6101(b)(2).
As the Mushroom Act's economic goals indicate, collective
promotion and research is a perfectly traditional form of government intervention in the marketplace. Promotion may
help to overcome inaccurate consumer perceptions about
a product. See Hearings on H. R. 1776 et al. before the
Subcommittee on Domestic Marketing, Consumer Relations,

and Nutrition of the House Committee on Agriculture, 101stCong., 1st Sess., 99 (1989) (hereinafter Hearings) (statement of Rep. Grant) (noting need to overcome consumerfears about safety of eating mushrooms and that per capita
mushroom consumption in Canada was twice that of UnitedStates). Overcoming those perceptions will sometimes
bring special public benefits. See 7 U. S. C. $$ 6101(a)(1)-(3)
(mushrooms are "valuable part of the human diet," andtheir production "benefits the environment"). And compelled payment may be needed to produce those benefitswhere, otherwise, some producers would take a free ride on
the expenditures of others. See Hearings 95-96 (statement
of James Ciarrocchi) ("The . . . industry has embarked on
several voluntary promotion campaigns over the years. . . .
[A] lesson from every one . . . has been unreliability, inefficiency, and inequities of voluntary participation").

Compared with traditional "command and control," price,
or output regulation, this kind of regulation--which relies
upon self-regulation through industry trade associations and
upon the dissemination of information--is more consistent,
not less consistent, with producer choice. It is difficult to
see why a Constitution that seeks to protect individual freedom would consider the absence of "heavy regulation," ante,
at 413, to amount to a special, determinative reason for refusing to permit this less intrusive program. If the Court
classifies the former, more comprehensive regulatory scheme
as "economic regulation" for First Amendment purposes, it
should similarly classify the latter, which does not differ significantly but for the comparatively greater degree of freedom that it allows.

The Court invokes in support of its conclusion other First
Amendment precedent, namely, Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed.,
431 U. S. 209 (1977), Keller v. State Bar of Cal., 496 U. S. 1
(1990), West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624
(1943), and Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U. S. 705 (1977). But
those cases are very different. The first two, Abood and

Breyer, J., dissenting
Keller, involved compelled contributions by employees totrade unions and by lawyers to state bar associations, respectively. This Court held that the compelled contribu-tions were unlawful (1) to the extent that they helped fund
subsidiary activities of the organization, i. e., activities other
than those that legally justified a compelled contribution;
and (2) because the subsidiary activities in question were
political activities that might "conflict with one's `freedomof belief.' "

Wileman, supra, at 471 (quoting Abood, supra,
at 235). See Keller, supra, at 15 (communications involv-ing abortion, prayer in the public schools, and gun control);

Abood, supra, at 213 (communications involving politics and
religion).

By contrast, the funded activities here, like identical activities in Wileman, do not involve this kind of expression.
In Wileman we described the messages at issue as incapable
of "engender[ing] any crisis of conscience" and the producers'
objections as "trivial." 521 U. S., at 471, 472. The messages here are indistinguishable. Compare Brief for Respondent 10-11 (objecting to advertising because it treats
branded and unbranded mushrooms alike, associates mushrooms "with the consumption of alcohol and . . . tout[s] mushrooms as an aphrodisiac") with Wileman, supra, at 467, n. 10
(dismissing objections to advertising that suggested " `all
varieties of California fruit to be of equal quality,' " and
included " `sexually subliminal messages as evidenced by
an ad depicting a young girl in a wet bathing suit' ") (quoting District Court opinion). See also Appendix, infra. The
compelled contribution here relates directly to the regulatory program's basic goal.

Neither does this case resemble either Barnette or Wooley.
Barnette involved compelling children, contrary to their
conscience, to salute the American flag. 319 U. S., at 632.
Wooley involved compelling motorists, contrary to their conscience, to display license plates bearing the State's message "Live Free or Die." 430 U. S., at 707. In Wileman

Breyer, J., dissenting
we found Barnette and Wooley, and all of "our compelledspeech case law . . . clearly inapplicable" to compelled financial support of generic advertising. 521 U. S., at 470. Seealso Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme
Court of Ohio, 471 U. S. 626, 651 (1985) (refusing to applyWooley and Barnette in a commercial context where "the
interests at stake in this case are not of the same order").We explained:

"The use of assessments to pay for advertising doesnot require respondents to repeat an objectionable
message out of their own mouths, cf. West Virginia Bd.
of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624, 632 (1943), require themto use their own property to convey an antagonistic

ideological message, cf. Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U. S.705 (1977); Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. Public Util.
Comm'n of Cal., 475 U. S. 1, 18 (1986) (plurality opinion),force them to respond to a hostile message when they
`would prefer to remain silent,' see ibid., or require themto be publicly identified or associated with another's
message, cf. PruneYard Shopping Center v. Robins, 447U. S. 74, 88 (1980). Respondents are . . . merely required to make contributions for advertising." Wile-man, supra, at 470-471.

These statements are no less applicable to the present case.How can the Court today base its holding on Barnette,
Wooley, Abood, and Keller--the very same cases that weexpressly distinguished in Wileman?

II
Nearly every human action that the law affects, and vir-tually all governmental activity, involves speech. For First

Amendment purposes this Court has distinguished amongcontexts in which speech activity might arise, applying special speech-protective rules and presumptions in some ofthose areas, but not in others. See,

e. g., Board of Regents

Breyer, J., dissenting
of Univ. of Wis. System v. Southworth, 529 U. S. 217, 229(2000) (indicating that less restrictive rules apply to governmental speech); Central Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public
Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 557, 564 (1980) (commercial
speech subject to "mid-level" scrutiny); Pickering v. Board
of Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty., 391
U. S. 563, 568 (1968) (applying special rules applicable to
speech of government employees). Were the Court not todo so--were it to apply the strictest level of scrutiny in every

area of speech touched by law--it would, at a minimum, cre-ate through its First Amendment analysis a serious obstacle
to the operation of well-established, legislatively created,
regulatory programs, thereby seriously hindering the operation of that democratic self-government that the Constitution
seeks to create and to protect. Cf. Post, The Constitutional
Status of Commercial Speech, 48 UCLA L. Rev. 1, 9-10
(2000).

That, I believe, is why it is important to understand that
the regulatory program before us is a "species of economic regulation," Wileman, 521 U. S., at 477, which does
not "warrant special First Amendment scrutiny," id., at 474.
Irrespective of Wileman I would so characterize the program for three reasons.

First, the program does not significantly interfere with
protected speech interests. It does not compel speech itself;
it compels the payment of money. Money and speech are
not identical. Cf. Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government
PAC, 528 U. S. 377, 388-389 (2000); id., at 398 (Stevens, J.,
concurring) ("Money is property; it is not speech"); id., at
400 (Breyer, J., concurring) ("[A] decision to contribute
money to a campaign is a matter of First Amendment concern--not because money is speech (it is not); but because
it enables speech"). Indeed, the contested requirement--
that individual producers make a payment to help achieve
a governmental objective--resembles a targeted tax. See
Southworth, 529 U. S., at 241 (Souter, J., joined by Stevens

and Breyer, JJ., concurring in judgment) ("[T]he universityfee at issue is a tax"). And the "government, as a general

rule, may support valid programs and policies by taxes orother exactions binding on protesting parties."

Id., at 229
(majority opinion). Cf. Regan v. Taxation With Representation of Wash., 461 U. S. 540, 547 (1983) ("Legislatures have
especially broad latitude in creating classifications and distinctions in tax statutes").Second, this program furthers, rather than hinders, the

basic First Amendment "commercial speech" objective. Thespeech at issue amounts to ordinary product promotion
within the commercial marketplace--an arena typically characterized both by the need for a degree of public supervision
and the absence of a special democratic need to protect the
channels of public debate, i. e., the communicative process
itself. Cf. Post, supra, at 14-15. No one here claims that
the mushroom producers are restrained from contributing
to a public debate, moving public opinion, writing literature, creating art, invoking the processes of democratic selfgovernment, or doing anything else more central to the First
Amendment's concern with democratic self-government.

When purely commercial speech is at issue, the Court has
described the First Amendment's basic objective as protection of the consumer's interest in the free flow of truthful commercial information. See, e. g., Edenfield v. Fane,
507 U. S. 761, 766 (1993) ("First Amendment coverage of
commercial speech is designed to safeguard" society's "interes[t] in broad access to complete and accurate commercial information"); Zauderer, supra, at 651 ("[T]he extension
of First Amendment protection to commercial speech is
justified principally by the value to consumers of the information"); Central Hudson, supra, at 563 ("The First Amendment's concern for commercial speech is based on the informational function of advertising"); First Nat. Bank of
Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765, 783 (1978) ("A commercial
advertisement is constitutionally protected not so much

533US2 Unit: $U81 [10-19-02 13:58:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Breyer, J., dissenting
because it pertains to the seller's business as because itfurthers the societal interest in the `free flow of commercial

information' ") (quoting Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U. S. 748, 764
(1976)). Unlike many of the commercial speech restrictionsthis Court has previously addressed, the program before

us promotes the dissemination of truthful information to
consumers. And to sustain the objecting producer's con-stitutional claim will likely make less information, not more

information, available. Perhaps that is why this Court hasnot previously applied "compelled speech" doctrine to strike
down laws requiring provision of additional commercial
speech.

Third, there is no special risk of other forms of speechrelated harm. As I have previously pointed out, and Wileman held, there is no risk of significant harm to an individual's conscience. Supra, at 423-424. The program does
not censor producer views unrelated to its basic regulatory
justification. Supra, at 420-421. And there is little risk of
harming any "discrete, little noticed grou[p]." Ante, at 410.
The Act excludes small producers, 7 U. S. C. $$ 6102(6), (11)
(exempting those who import or produce less than 500,000
pounds of mushrooms annually)--unlike respondent, a large,
influential corporation. The Act contains methods for implementing its requirements democratically. See $$ 6104(b)
(1)(B), (g)(2) (Mushroom Council, which sets assessment rate,
is composed entirely of industry representatives); $$ 6105(a),
(b) (referendum required before Secretary of Agriculture's
order can go into effect and five years thereafter, and producers may request additional referenda). And the Act provides for supervision by the Secretary. $ 6104(d)(3) (requiring Secretary to approve all advertising programs). See
also Wileman, 521 U. S., at 477 (refusing to upset "the judgment of the majority of market participants, bureaucrats,
and legislators who have concluded that [collective advertising] programs are beneficial"). These safeguards protect

428 UNITED STATES v. UNITED FOODS, INC.

Breyer, J., dissenting
against abuse of the program, such as "making one entrepreneur finance advertising for the benefit of his competitors."
Ante, at 418 (Stevens, J., concurring). Indeed, there is no
indication here that the generic advertising promotes some
brands but not others. And any "debat[e]" about branded
versus nonbranded mushrooms, ante, at 411 (majority opinion), is identical to that in Wileman. Supra, at 423-424.

Taken together, these circumstances lead me to classify
this common example of government intervention in the
marketplace as involving a form of economic regulation, not
"commercial speech," for purposes of applying First Amendment presumptions. And seen as such, I cannot find the
program lacks sufficient justification to survive constitutional
scrutiny. Wileman, supra, at 476-477.

The Court, in applying stricter First Amendment standards and finding them violated, sets an unfortunate precedent. That precedent suggests, perhaps requires, striking
down any similar program that, for example, would require
tobacco companies to contribute to an industry fund for
advertising the harms of smoking or would use a portion
of museum entry charges for a citywide campaign to promote
the value of art. Moreover, because of its uncertainty as
to how much governmental involvement will produce a form
of immunity under the "government speech" doctrine, see
ante, at 417, the Court infects more traditional regulatory
requirements--those related, say, to warranties or to health
or safety information--with constitutional doubt.

Alternatively, the Court's unreasoned distinction between
heavily regulated and less heavily regulated speakers could
lead to less First Amendment protection in that it would
deprive the former of protection. But see Consolidated
Edison Co. of N. Y. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U. S.
530, 534, n. 1 (1980) (Even "heavily regulated businesses
may enjoy constitutional protection") (citing, as an example,
Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy, supra, at 763-765).

Breyer, J., dissenting
At a minimum, the holding here, when contrasted with
that in Wileman, creates an incentive to increase the Government's involvement in any information-based regulatory
program, thereby unnecessarily increasing the degree of
that program's restrictiveness. I do not believe the First
Amendment seeks to limit the Government's economic regulatory choices in this way--any more than does the Due
Process Clause. Cf. Lochner v. New York, 198 U. S. 45
(1905).

III

Even if I were to classify the speech at issue here as "commercial speech" and apply the somewhat more stringent
standard set forth in the Court's commercial speech cases,
I would reach the same result. That standard permits restrictions where they "directly advance" a "substantial" government interest that could not "be served as well by a more
limited restriction." Central Hudson, 447 U. S., at 564.
I have already explained why I believe the Government interest here is substantial, at least when compared with many
typical regulatory goals. Supra, at 422. It remains to consider whether the restrictions are needed to advance its
objective.

Several features of the program indicate that its speechrelated aspects, i. e., its compelled monetary contributions,
are necessary and proportionate to the legitimate promotional goals that it seeks. At the legislative hearings that
led to enactment of the Act, industry representatives made
clear that pre-existing efforts that relied upon voluntary contributions had not worked. Thus, compelled contributions
may be necessary to maintain a collective advertising program in that rational producers would otherwise take a free
ride on the expenditures of others. See ibid.; Abood, 431
U. S., at 222 (relying upon "free rider" justification in union
context).

At the same time, those features of the program that ledWileman's dissenters to find its program disproportionately

restrictive are absent here. Wileman's statutory schemecovered various different agricultural commodities and imposed a patchwork of geographically based limitations while"prohibit[ing] orders of national scope"--all for no apparent
reason. 521 U. S., at 499 (Souter, J., dissenting). The lawat issue here, however, applies only to mushrooms, and says
explicitly that "[a]ny" mushroom order "shall be nationalin scope." 7 U. S. C. $ 6103(a). Cf.

Wileman, supra, at 493(
Souter, J., dissenting) ("[I]f the Government were to at-tack these problems across an interstate market for a given

agricultural commodity or group of them, the substantialityof the national interest would not be open to apparent
question . . .").Nor has the Government relied upon "[m]ere speculation" about the effect of the advertising. Wileman, supra,at 501 (

Souter, J., dissenting). Rather, it has provided em-pirical evidence demonstrating the program's effect. See

Food Marketing & Economics Group, Mushroom CouncilProgram Effectiveness Review, 1999, p. 6 (Feb. 2000), lodging for United States (available in Clerk of Court's case file)(finding that "for every million dollars spent by the Mushroom Council . . . the growth rate [of mushroom sales] in-creases by 2.1%"). In consequence, whatever harm the
program may cause First Amendment interests is pro-portionate. Cf.

Bartnicki v. Vopper, 532 U. S. 514, 535(2001) (
Breyer, J., concurring).The Court's decision converts "a question of economic

policy for Congress and the Executive" into a "First Amend-ment issue," contrary to

Wileman. 521 U. S., at 468 (in-ternal quotation marks and citation omitted). Nor can its

holding find support in basic First Amendment principles.For these reasons, I dissent.

FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION v. COLORADO

REPUBLICAN FEDERAL CAMPAIGN

COMMITTEE

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe tenth circuit

No. 00-191. Argued February 28, 2001--Decided June 25, 2001
In Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 12-59, this Court held that the limitations on political campaign contributions in the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 were generally constitutional, but that the Act's
limitations on election expenditures infringed political expression in
violation of the First Amendment. Later cases have respected this
line between contributing and spending. The distinction's simplicity is
qualified, however, by the Act's provision for a functional, not formal,
definition of "contribution," which includes "expenditures made by any
person in cooperation, consultation, or concert, with . . . a candidate,"
2 U. S. C. $ 441a(a)(7)(B)(i). Thus, expenditures coordinated with a candidate are contributions under the Act. The Federal Election Commission (FEC) originally took the position that any expenditure by a
political party in connection with a federal election was presumed to
be coordinated with the party's candidate. See, e. g., Federal Election
Comm'n v. Democratic Senatorial Campaign Comm., 454 U. S. 27, 28-
29, n. 1. The FEC thus assumed that all expenditure limits imposed
on political parties were, in essence, contribution limits and therefore
constitutional. Such limits include $ 441a(d)(3), which imposes spending limits on national and state political parties with respect to United
States Senate elections. In Colorado Republican Federal Campaign
Comm. v. Federal Election Comm'n, 518 U. S. 604 (Colorado I), the
spending limits in $ 441a(d)(3) (referred to as the Party Expenditure
Provision), were held unconstitutional as applied to the independent
expenditures of the Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee
(Party) in connection with a senatorial campaign. The principal opinion
ruled the payments "independent," rather than coordinated, expenditures under this Court's cases because the Party spent the money before
selecting its own senatorial candidate and without any arrangement
with potential nominees. Id., at 613-614. The principal opinion remanded the Party's broader claim that all limits on a party's congressional campaign expenditures are facially unconstitutional and thus un533US2 Unit: $U82 [11-01-02 19:18:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN

REPUBLICAN FEDERAL CAMPAIGN COMM.

Syllabus

enforceable even as to spending coordinated with a candidate. Id., at
623-626. On remand, the District Court held for the Party on that
claim, and a divided Tenth Circuit panel affirmed.

Held: Because a party's coordinated expenditures, unlike expenditures

truly independent, may be restricted to minimize circumvention of
the Act's contribution limits, the Party's facial challenge is rejected.
Pp. 440-465.

(a) Political expenditure limits deserve closer scrutiny than contribution restrictions, e. g., Buckley, 424 U. S., at 14-23, because expenditure restraints generally curb more expressive and associational activity
than contribution limits, e. g., id., at 19-23, and because unlimited contributions are more clearly linked to political corruption than other kinds
of unlimited political spending, at least where the spending is not coordinated with a candidate or his campaign, e. g., id., at 47. Although the
First Amendment line is easy to draw when it falls between independent expenditures by individuals or political action committees (PACs)
without any candidate's approval and contributions in the form of cash
gifts to candidates, see, e. g., id., at 19-23, facts speak less clearly once
the independence of the spending cannot be taken for granted. Congress's functional treatment of coordinated expenditures by individuals
and nonparty groups like contributions prevents attempts to circumvent the Act through coordinated expenditures amounting to disguised
contributions. Id., at 47. Buckley, in fact, enhanced the significance
of this functional treatment by striking down independent expenditure limits on First Amendment grounds while upholding limitations
on contributions (by individuals and nonparty groups), as defined to include coordinated expenditures. Id., at 23-59. Colorado I addressed
the FEC's effort to stretch the functional treatment one step further.
Because Buckley had treated some coordinated expenditures like contributions and upheld their limitation, the FEC's argument went, the
Party Expenditure Provision should stand as applied to all party election spending, see, e. g., 518 U. S., at 619-623. Holding otherwise, the
principal opinion found that, because "independent" party expenditures
are no more likely to serve corruption than independent expenditures
by anyone else, there was no justification for subjecting party election
spending across the board to the kinds of limits previously invalidated
when applied to individuals and nonparty groups. See id., at 616. But
that still left the question whether the First Amendment allows coordinated election expenditures by parties to be treated functionally as
contributions, the way coordinated expenditures by other entities are
treated. The issue in this case is, accordingly, whether a party is in a
different position from other political speakers, giving it a claim to de533US2 Unit: $U82 [11-01-02 19:18:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN

433Cite as: 533 U. S. 431 (2001)
Syllabus
mand a higher standard of scrutiny before its coordinated spending can
be limited. Pp. 440-445.

(b) The Party's argument that its coordinated spending, like its independent spending, should be left free from restriction under the Buckley
line of cases boils down to this: because a party's most important speech
is aimed at electing candidates and is itself expressed through those
candidates, any limit on party support for a candidate imposes a unique
First Amendment burden. Limitation of any party expenditure coordinated with a candidate, the Party contends, is therefore a serious, rather
than incidental, imposition on the party's speech and associative purpose, which justifies a stricter level of scrutiny than has been applied
to analogous limits on individuals and nonparty groups. But whatever
level of scrutiny is applied to such a limit, the Party argues, the burden
on a party reflects a fatal mismatch between the effects of limiting coordinated party expenditures and the prevention of corruption or its appearance. In contrast, the Government's argument for characterizing
coordinated spending like contributions goes back to Buckley, which,
in effect, subjected limits on coordinated expenditures by individuals
and nonparty groups to the same scrutiny it applied to limits on their
cash contributions. The standard of scrutiny requires the limit to be
closely drawn to match a sufficiently important interest, though the
limit's dollar amount need not be fine tuned. See, e. g., Buckley, supra,
at 25, 30. The Government develops this rationale a step further here,
arguing that a party's coordinated spending should be limited not only
because it is like a party contribution, but because giving a party the
right to make unlimited coordinated expenditures would induce those
wishing to support a nominee to contribute to the party in order to
finance coordinated spending for that candidate, thereby increasing
circumvention and bypassing the limits Buckley upheld. Pp. 445-447.

(c) Although each of the competing positions is plausible at first blush,
evaluation of the arguments prompts rejection of the Party's claim
to suffer a burden unique in any way that should make a categorical
difference under the First Amendment. And the Government's contentions are ultimately borne out by evidence, entitling it to prevail
in its characterization of party coordinated spending as the functional
equivalent of contributions. Pp. 447-460.

(1) The Party's argument that unrestricted coordinated spending
is essential to a party's nature because of its unique relationship with
candidates has been rendered implausible by nearly 30 years' history
under the Act. Since 1974, a party's coordinated spending in a given
race has been limited by the provision challenged here (or its predecessor). It was not until the 1996 Colorado I decision that any spending was allowed above that amount, and since then only independent

spending has been unlimited. Thus, the Party's claim that coordinated
spending beyond the Act's limit is essential to its very function as a
party amounts implicitly to saying that for almost three decades political parties have not been quite functional or have been functioning
in systematic violation of the law. The Court cannot accept either implication. Pp. 449-450.

(2) There is a different weakness in the seemingly unexceptionable premise that parties are organized for the purpose of electing candidates, so that imposing on the way parties serve that function is
uniquely burdensome. The fault here is a refusal to see how the power
of money actually works in the political structure. Looking directly at
a party's function in getting and spending money, it would ignore reality
to think that the party role is adequately described by speaking generally of electing particular candidates. Parties are necessarily the
instruments of some contributors, such as PACs, whose object is not
to support the party's message or to elect party candidates, but rather
to support a specific candidate for the sake of a position on one, narrow
issue, or even to support any candidate who will be obliged to contributors. Parties thus perform functions more complex than simply electing their candidates: they act as agents for spending on behalf of those
who seek to produce obligated officeholders. It is this party role, which
functionally unites parties with other self-interested political actors,
that the Party Expenditure Provision targets. Pp. 450-452.

(3) The Court agrees insofar as the Party suggests that its strong
working relationship with candidates and its unique ability to speak
in coordination with them should be taken into account in the First
Amendment analysis. It is the accepted understanding that a party
combines its members' power to speak by aggregating their contributions and broadcasting its messages more widely than its individual
contributors generally could afford to do, and it marshals this power
with greater sophistication than individuals generally could, using such
mechanisms as speech coordinated with a candidate. Cf. Colorado I,
518 U. S., at 637. It does not, however, follow from a party's efficiency
in getting large sums and spending intelligently that limits on a party's
coordinated spending should be scrutinized under an unusually high
standard. In fact, any argument from sophistication and power would
cut both ways. On the one hand, one can seek the benefit of stricter
scrutiny of a law capping party coordinated spending by emphasizing
the heavy burden imposed by limiting the most effective mechanism
of sophisticated spending. And yet it is exactly this efficiency culminating in coordinated spending that (on the Government's view) places
a party in a position to be used to circumvent contribution limits that
apply to individuals and PACs, and thereby to exacerbate the threat of

435Cite as: 533 U. S. 431 (2001)
Syllabus
corruption and apparent corruption that those contribution limits are
aimed at reducing. Pp. 453-454.

(4) The preceding question assumes that parties enjoy a power and
experience that sets them apart from other political spenders. But in
fact the assumption is too crude. Like a party, rich individual donors,
media executives, and PACs have the means to speak loudly and the
capacity to work in tandem with a candidate. Yet all of them are subject to the coordinated spending limits upheld in Buckley, 424 U. S., at
46-47. A party is also like some of these political actors in its right
under Colorado I to spend money in support of a candidate without
legal limit so long as it spends independently. A party is not, therefore, in a unique position, but is in the same position as some individuals
and PACs. Pp. 454-455.

(5) Because the Party's arguments do not pan out, the Court applies to a party's coordinated spending limitation the same scrutiny it
has applied to the other political actors, that is, scrutiny appropriate
for a contribution limit, enquiring whether the restriction is "closely
drawn" to match the "sufficiently important" government interest in
combating political corruption. E. g., Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U. S. 377, 387-388. Pp. 455-456.

(6) Under that standard, adequate evidentiary grounds exist to sustain the coordinated spending limit for parties. Substantial evidence
demonstrates how candidates, donors, and parties test the current law's
limits, and it shows beyond serious doubt how those contribution limits
would be eroded if inducement to circumvent them were enhanced
by declaring parties' coordinated spending wide open. Under the Act,
a donor is limited to $2,000 in contributions to one candidate in a given
election cycle. The same donor may give as much as another $20,000
each year to a national party committee supporting the candidate. The
evidence shows that what a realist would expect to occur has occurred.
Donors give to the party with the tacit understanding that the favored
candidate will benefit. Testimony shows that, although the understanding between donor and party may involve no definite commitment
and may be tacit on the donor's part, the frequency of the practice and
the volume of money involved has required parties to adopt tallying
procedures to connect donors to candidates. If suddenly every dollar
of spending could be coordinated with the candidate, the inducement to
circumvent would almost certainly intensify. Pp. 457-460.

(d) The Party's attempts to minimize the threat of corruption by circumvention are unavailing. Its claim that most contributions to parties
are small, with negligible corrupting momentum to be carried through
the party conduit, is unpersuasive given the evidence that, even under
present law, substantial donations turn the parties into matchmakers

Syllabus

whose special meetings and receptions give donors the chance to get
their points across to the candidates. The fact that incumbent candidates give more excess campaign funds to parties than parties spend on
coordinated expenditures does not defuse concern over circumvention;
if party contributions were not used as a funnel from donors to candidates, there would be no reason for the tallying system described by
the witnesses. Finally, the Court rejects the Party's claim that, even
if there is a circumvention threat, the First Amendment demands a response better tailored to that threat than a limitation on coordinated
spending. First, the Party's suggestion that better crafted safeguards
are already in place in $ 441a(a)(8)--which provides that contributions
that are earmarked or otherwise directed through an intermediary to
a candidate are treated as contributions to the candidate--ignores the
practical difficulty of identifying and directly combating circumvention
when contributions go into a general party treasury and candidatefundraisers are rewarded with something less obvious than dollar-fordollar pass-throughs. Second, although the Party's call for replacing
limits on parties' coordinated expenditures with limits on contributions
to parties is based in part on reasoning in Buckley, supra, at 44, and
Colorado I, supra, at 617, those cases ultimately turned on the understanding that the expenditures at issue were independent and therefore
functionally true expenditures, whereas, here, just the opposite is true.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.
In Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm. v. Federal Election Comm'n, 518 U. S. 604 (1996) (Colorado I), we
held that spending limits set by the Federal Election Campaign Act were unconstitutional as applied to the Colorado
Republican Party's independent expenditures in connection
with a senatorial campaign. We remanded for consideration
of the party's claim that all limits on expenditures by a political party in connection with congressional campaigns are
facially unconstitutional and thus unenforceable even as to
spending coordinated with a candidate. Today we reject
that facial challenge to the limits on parties' coordinated
expenditures.

I

We first examined the Federal Election Campaign Act of
1971 in Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1 (1976) (per curiam),
where we held that the Act's limitations on contributions to
a candidate's election campaign were generally constitutional, but that limitations on election expenditures were
not. Id., at 12-59. Later cases have respected this line
between contributing and spending. See, e. g., Nixon v.
Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U. S. 377, 386-388
(2000); Colorado I, supra, at 610, 614-615; Federal Election

REPUBLICAN FEDERAL CAMPAIGN COMM.

Opinion of the Court

Comm'n v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc., 479 U. S.
238, 259-260 (1986).

The simplicity of the distinction is qualified, however, by
the Act's provision for a functional, not formal, definition of
"contribution," which includes "expenditures made by any
person in cooperation, consultation, or concert, with, or at
the request or suggestion of, a candidate, his authorized
political committees, or their agents," 2 U. S. C. $ 441a(a)
(7)(B)(i).1 Expenditures coordinated with a candidate, that
is, are contributions under the Act.

The Federal Election Commission (FEC or Commission)
originally took the position that any expenditure by a political party in connection with a particular election for federal
office was presumed to be coordinated with the party's candidate. See Federal Election Comm'n v. Democratic Senatorial Campaign Comm., 454 U. S. 27, 28-29, n. 1 (1981); Brief
for Petitioner 6-7. The Commission thus operated on the
assumption that all expenditure limits imposed on political
parties were, in essence, contribution limits and therefore
constitutional. Brief for Respondent in Colorado I, O. T.
1995, No. 95-489, pp. 28-30. Such limits include 2 U. S. C.

$ 441a(d)(3), which provides that in elections for the United
States Senate, each national or state party committee 2 is

1 "Contribution" is otherwise defined as "any gift, subscription, loan, advance, or deposit of money or anything of value made by any person for
the purpose of influencing any election for Federal office"; or "the payment
by any person of compensation for the personal services of another person
which are rendered to a political committee without charge for any purpose." 2 U. S. C. $ 431(8).

The Act defines "expenditure" as "any purchase, payment, distribution,
loan, advance, deposit, or gift of money or anything of value, made by
any person for the purpose of influencing any election for Federal office."

$ 431(9)(A)(i). A "written contract, promise, or agreement to make an
expenditure" also counts as an expenditure. $ 431(9)(A)(ii).

2 A political party's "national committee" is the "organization which, by

virtue of the bylaws of a political party, is responsible for the day-to-day
operation of such political party at the national level, as determined by

limited to spending the greater of $20,000 (adjusted forinflation, $ 441a(c)) or two cents multiplied by the voting

age population of the State in which the election is held,$ 441a(d)(3)(A).

3

Colorado I was an as-applied challenge to $ 441a(d)(3)(which we spoke of as the Party Expenditure Provision), occasioned by the Commission's enforcement action against theColorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee (Party)
for exceeding the campaign spending limit through itspayments for radio advertisements attacking Democratic
Congressman and senatorial candidate Timothy Wirth. 518U. S., at 612-613. The Party defended in part with the
claim that the party expenditure limitations violated theFirst Amendment, and the principal opinion in

Colorado Iagreed that the limitations were unconstitutional as applied

to the advertising expenditures at issue. Unlike the Com-mission, the Members of the Court who joined the principal
opinion thought the payments were "independent expendi-tures" as that term had been used in our prior cases, owing
to the facts that the Party spent the money before select-ing its own senatorial candidate and without any arrangement with potential nominees. Id., at 613-614 (opinion of
Breyer, J.).The Party's broader claim remained: that although prior

decisions of this Court had upheld the constitutionality oflimits on coordinated expenditures by political speakers

the [Federal Election] Commission." $ 431(14). A "state committee" fills
the same role at the state level. $ 431(15).

3 The same limits apply to campaigns for House of Representatives from

States entitled to only one Representative. $ 441a(d)(3)(A). For other
States, the limit on party expenditures in connection with House campaigns is $10,000 preadjustment. $ 441a(d)(3)(B). As adjusted for inflation, the 2000 Senate limits ranged from $67,560 to $1,636,438; House limits
ranged from $33,780 to $67,560. 26 FEC Record 14-15 (Mar. 2000).

The FEC reads the Act to permit parties to make campaign contributions within the otherwise-applicable contribution limits, in addition to the
expenditures permitted by $ 441a(d). See n. 16, infra.

other than parties, the congressional campaign expenditurelimitations on parties themselves are facially unconstitutional, and so are incapable of reaching party spending evenwhen coordinated with a candidate. Id., at 623-626.

remanded that facial challenge, which had not been fullybriefed or considered below. Ibid. On remand the District

Court held for the Party, 41 F. Supp. 2d 1197 (1999), and adivided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit
affirmed, 213 F. 3d 1221 (2000).5 We granted certiorari toresolve the question left open by

Colorado I, see 531 U. S.923 (2000), and we now reverse.

II
Spending for political ends and contributing to politicalcandidates both fall within the First Amendment's protection of speech and political association. Buckley, 424 U. S.,at 14-23. But ever since we first reviewed the 1971 Act, we
have understood that limits on political expenditures deservecloser scrutiny than restrictions on political contributions.
Ibid.; see also, e. g., Shrink Missouri, 528 U. S., at 386-388;
Colorado I, supra, at 610, 614-615; Massachusetts Citizensfor Life, supra, at 259-260. Restraints on expenditures

generally curb more expressive and associational activitythan limits on contributions do. Shrink Missouri, supra, at
386-388; Colorado I, supra, at 615; Buckley, supra, at 19-23.A further reason for the distinction is that limits on contribu4 The limits applicable to Presidential campaigns were not at issue in
Colorado I, 518 U. S. 604, 610-611 (1996), and are not at issue here, Brief
for Respondent 49, n. 30.

5 Along with its constitutional claim, the Party argued to the District

Court that the Party Expenditure Provision's application to independent
expenditures was not severable from the other possible applications of the
provision, a nonconstitutional basis for resolving the case that the Colorado I principal opinion suggested should be explored on remand. Colorado I, supra, at 625-626. The District Court rejected the nonseverability argument, 41 F. Supp. 2d, at 1207, and the Party did not renew it on
appeal, 213 F. 3d, at 1225, n. 3.

Opinion of the Court
tions are more clearly justified by a link to political corrup-tion than limits on other kinds of unlimited political spending

are (corruption being understood not only as quid pro quoagreements, but also as undue influence on an officeholder's
judgment, and the appearance of such influence, Shrink Mis-souri, supra, at 388-389). At least this is so where the
spending is not coordinated with a candidate or his cam-paign.

Colorado I, supra, at 615; Buckley, 424 U. S., at 47.In Buckley we said that:

"[u]nlike contributions, . . . independent expendituresmay well provide little assistance to the candidate's campaign and indeed may prove counterproductive. Theabsence of prearrangement and coordination of an expenditure with the candidate or his agent not only un-dermines the value of the expenditure to the candidate,
but also alleviates the danger that expenditures will begiven as a quid pro quo for improper commitments from
the candidate." Ibid.
Given these differences, we have routinely struck down limi-tations on independent expenditures by candidates, other

individuals, and groups, see Federal Election Comm'n v.
National Conservative Political Action Comm., 470 U. S.480, 490-501 (1985) (political action committees); Buckley,

supra, at 39-58 (individuals, groups, candidates, and cam-paigns),

Shrink Missouri, supra (contributions by political action

6 The expenditure limits invalidated in Buckley applied to candidates
and their campaigns, and to "persons." See 424 U. S., at 39-40, 51, 54, 58.
"Person" was defined as "an individual, partnership, committee, association, corporation, or any other organization or group of persons." 18
U. S. C. $ 591(g) (1970 ed., Supp. IV); see also Buckley, 424 U. S., at 144-
235 (appendix reprinting then-current Act). Although this language is
broad enough to cover political parties, id., at 19, and n. 19, 39, parties
with a candidate on the ballot were covered instead by the special Party
Expenditure Provision, which was not challenged on First Amendment
grounds, id., at 58, n. 66.

committees); California Medical Assn. v. Federal ElectionComm'n, 453 U. S. 182, 193-199 (1981) (contributions by individuals and associations); Buckley, supra, at 23-36 (contribu-tions by individuals, groups, and political committees).

7

The First Amendment line between spending and donatingis easy to draw when it falls between independent expenditures by individuals or political action committees (PACs)without any candidate's approval (or wink or nod), and contributions in the form of cash gifts to candidates. See, e. g.,
Shrink Missouri, supra, at 386-388; Buckley, supra, at 19-23.

8 But facts speak less clearly once the independence of

7 The contribution limits at issue in Buckley applied to "persons" ("person" again defined as "an individual, partnership, committee, association,
corporation or any other organization or group of persons," id., at 23).
Certain groups (referred to under current law as "multicandidate political
committees") that registered with the FEC and met other qualifications,
including making contributions to five or more candidates for federal office, were subject to a higher limit. Id., at 35.

The current contribution limits appear in 2 U. S. C. $ 441a(a). They provide that "persons" (still broadly defined, see $ 431(11)) may contribute no
more than $1,000 to a candidate "with respect to any election for Federal
office," $5,000 to any political committee in any year, and $20,000 to the
national committees of a political party in any year. $ 441a(a)(1). Individuals are limited to a yearly contribution total of $25,000. $ 441a(a)(3).
"[M]ulticandidate political committees" are limited to a $5,000 contribution
to a candidate "with respect to any election," $5,000 to any political committee in any year, and $15,000 to the national committees of a political
party in any year. $ 441a(a)(2). Unlike the party expenditure limits,
these contribution limits are not adjusted for inflation.

8 The Party does not challenge the constitutionality of limits on cash

contributions from parties to candidates, Brief for Respondent 49, n. 31,
which, on the FEC's reading of the Act, are imposed on parties by the
generally applicable contribution limits of 2 U. S. C. $ 441a(a), see n. 16,
infra. And the Party, unlike Justice Thomas, post, at 465 (dissenting
opinion), does not call for the overruling of Buckley. Nor does the FEC
ask us to revisit Buckley's general approach to expenditure limits, although some have argued that such limits could be justified in light of
post-Buckley developments in campaign finance, see, e. g., Blasi, Free
Speech and the Widening Gyre of Fundraising, 94 Colum. L. Rev. 1281
(1994); cf. Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U. S. 377, 409

Opinion of the Court
the spending cannot be taken for granted, and money spentby an individual or PAC according to an arrangement with a

candidate is therefore harder to classify. As already seen,Congress drew a functional, not a formal, line between contributions and expenditures when it provided that coor-dinated expenditures by individuals and nonparty groups
are subject to the Act's contribution limits, 2 U. S. C.$ 441a(a)(7)(B)(i);

Colorado I, 518 U. S., at 611. In Buckley,the Court acknowledged Congress's functional classification,

424 U. S., at 46-47, and n. 53, and observed that treatingcoordinated expenditures as contributions "prevent[s] attempts to circumvent the Act through prearranged or coordi-nated expenditures amounting to disguised contributions,"
id., at 47. Buckley, in fact, enhanced the significance of thisfunctional treatment by striking down independent expenditure limits on First Amendment grounds while upholdinglimitations on contributions (by individuals and nonparty
groups), as defined to include coordinated expenditures, id.,at 23-59.

9

Colorado I addressed the FEC's effort to stretch the func-tional treatment of coordinated expenditures further than

the plain application of the statutory definition. As we said,the FEC argued that parties and candidates are coupled so
closely that all of a party's expenditures on an election cam-paign are coordinated with its candidate; because

Buckleyhad treated some coordinated expenditures like contribu(2000) (Kennedy, J., dissenting) ("I would leave open the possibility that
Congress, or a state legislature, might devise a system in which there
are some limits on both expenditures and contributions, thus permitting officeholders to concentrate their time and efforts on official duties
rather than on fundraising"); id., at 405 (Breyer, J., concurring) ("Suppose Buckley denies the political branches sufficient leeway to enact
comprehensive solutions to the problems posed by campaign finance.
If so, like Justice Kennedy, I believe the Constitution would require
us to reconsider Buckley").

9 As noted, n. 6, supra, the Party Expenditure Provision itself was not

challenged on First Amendment grounds in Buckley, supra, at 58, n. 66.

tions and upheld their limitation, the argument went, theParty Expenditure Provision should stand as applied to all

party election spending. See Brief for Respondent in Colorado I, O. T. 1995, No. 95-489, at 28-30; see also Colorado I,
supra, at 619-623. Colorado I held otherwise, however, theprincipal opinion's view being that some party expenditures

could be seen as "independent" for constitutional purposes.
518 U. S., at 614. The principal opinion found no reason tosee these expenditures as more likely to serve or be seen

as instruments of corruption than independent expendituresby anyone else. So there was no justification for subjecting
party election spending across the board to the kinds of
limits previously invalidated when applied to individuals
and nonparty groups. The principal opinion observed that
"[t]he independent expression of a political party's views is
`core' First Amendment activity no less than is the independent expression of individuals, candidates, or other political
committees." Id., at 616. Since the FEC did not advance
any other convincing reason for refusing to draw the
independent-coordinated line accepted since Buckley, see
National Conservative Political Action Comm., 470 U. S.,
at 497-498; Buckley, supra, at 46-47, that was the end of the
case so far as it concerned independent spending. Colorado
I, supra, at 617-623.

But that still left the question whether the First Amendment allows coordinated election expenditures by parties to
be treated functionally as contributions, the way coordinated
expenditures by other entities are treated. Colorado I
found no justification for placing parties at a disadvantage
when spending independently; but was there a case for leaving them entirely free to coordinate unlimited spending with
candidates when others could not? The principal opinion in
Colorado I noted that coordinated expenditures "share some
of the constitutionally relevant features of independent expenditures." 518 U. S., at 624. But it also observed that
"many [party coordinated expenditures] are . . . virtually in533US2 Unit: $U82 [11-01-02 19:18:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN

445Cite as: 533 U. S. 431 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
distinguishable from simple contributions." Ibid. Coordi-nated spending by a party, in other words, covers a spectrum

of activity, as does coordinated spending by other politicalactors. The issue in this case is, accordingly, whether a
party is otherwise in a different position from other politicalspeakers, giving it a claim to demand a generally higher
standard of scrutiny before its coordinated spending can belimited. The issue is posed by two questions: does limiting
coordinated spending impose a unique burden on parties, andis there reason to think that coordinated spending by a party
would raise the risk of corruption posed when others spendin coordination with a candidate? The issue is best viewed
through the positions developed by the Party and the Gov-ernment in this case.

III
The Party's argument that its coordinated spending, likeits independent spending, should be left free from restriction

under the Buckley line of cases boils down to this: becausea party's most important speech is aimed at electing candidates and is itself expressed through those candidates, anylimit on party support for a candidate imposes a unique First
Amendment burden. See Brief for Respondent 26-31. Thepoint of organizing a party, the argument goes, is to run a
successful candidate who shares the party's policy goals.
Id., at 26. Therefore, while a campaign contribution is onlyone of several ways that individuals and nonparty groups

speak and associate politically, see Shrink Missouri, 528U. S., at 386-387; Buckley, supra, at 20-22, financial support
of candidates is essential to the nature of political parties aswe know them. And coordination with a candidate is a party's natural way of operating, not merely an option that caneasily be avoided. Brief for Respondent 26. Limitation of
any party expenditure coordinated with a candidate, theParty contends, is therefore a serious, rather than incidental,
imposition on the party's speech and associative purpose, andthat justifies a stricter level of scrutiny than we have applied

533US2 Unit: $U82 [11-01-02 19:18:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN
446 FEDERAL ELECTION COMM'N v. COLORADO

REPUBLICAN FEDERAL CAMPAIGN COMM.

Opinion of the Court

to analogous limits on individuals and nonparty groups. Butwhatever level of scrutiny is applied, the Party goes on to

argue, the burden on a party reflects a fatal mismatch be-tween the effects of limiting coordinated party expenditures
and the prevention of corruption or the appearance of it.Brief for Respondent 20-22, 25-32; see also 213 F. 3d, at
1227.

The Government's argument for treating coordinatedspending like contributions goes back to

Buckley. There,
the rationale for endorsing Congress's equation of coordi-nated expenditures and contributions was that the equation

"prevent[s] attempts to circumvent the Act through prearranged or coordinated expenditures amounting to disguised contributions." 424 U. S., at 47. The idea was that
coordinated expenditures are as useful to the candidate as
cash, and that such "disguised contributions" might be given
"as a quid pro quo for improper commitments from the candidate" (in contrast to independent expenditures, which are
poor sources of leverage for a spender because they might
be duplicative or counterproductive from a candidate's point
of view). Ibid. In effect, therefore, Buckley subjected limits on coordinated expenditures by individuals and nonparty
groups to the same scrutiny it applied to limits on their cash
contributions. The standard of scrutiny requires the limit
to be " `closely drawn' to match a `sufficiently important interest,' . . . though the dollar amount of the limit need not be
`fine tun[ed],' " Shrink Missouri, supra, at 387-388 (quoting
Buckley, supra, at 25, 30).

The Government develops this rationale a step further in
applying it here. Coordinated spending by a party should
be limited not only because it is like a party contribution,
but for a further reason. A party's right to make unlimited
expenditures coordinated with a candidate would induce individual and other nonparty contributors to give to the party
in order to finance coordinated spending for a favored candidate beyond the contribution limits binding on them. The

533US2 Unit: $U82 [11-01-02 19:18:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN

447Cite as: 533 U. S. 431 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
Government points out that a degree of circumvention is oc-curring under present law (which allows unlimited independent spending and some coordinated spending). Individualsand nonparty groups who have reached the limit of direct
contributions to a candidate give to a party with the under-standing that the contribution to the party will produce
increased party spending for the candidate's benefit. TheGovernment argues that if coordinated spending were unlimited, circumvention would increase: because coordinatedspending is as effective as direct contributions in supporting
a candidate, an increased opportunity for coordinated spend-ing would aggravate the use of a party to funnel money to a
candidate from individuals and nonparty groups, who wouldthus bypass the contribution limits that

Buckley upheld.

IV
Each of the competing positions is plausible at first blush.Our evaluation of the arguments, however, leads us to reject

the Party's claim to suffer a burden unique in any way thatshould make a categorical difference under the First Amendment. On the other side, the Government's contentions areultimately borne out by evidence, entitling it to prevail in its
characterization of party coordinated spending as the func-tional equivalent of contributions.

A
In assessing the Party's argument, we start with a wordabout what the Party is not saying. First, we do not understand the Party to be arguing that the line betweenindependent and coordinated expenditures is conceptually
unsound when applied to a political party instead of an indi-vidual or other association. See, e. g., Brief for Respondent
29 (describing "independent party speech"). Indeed, thegood sense of recognizing the distinction between independence and coordination was implicit in the principal opinion in
Colorado I, which did not accept the notion of a "metaphysi533US2 Unit: $U82 [11-01-02 19:18:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN
448 FEDERAL ELECTION COMM'N v. COLORADO

REPUBLICAN FEDERAL CAMPAIGN COMM.

Opinion of the Court

cal identity" between party and candidate, 518 U. S., at 622-
623, but rather decided that some of a party's expenditures
could be understood as being independent and therefore immune to limitation just as an individual's independent expenditure would be, id., at 619-623.

Second, we do not understand the Party to be arguing that
associations in general or political parties in particular may
claim a variety of First Amendment protection that is different in kind from the speech and associational rights of their
members.10 The Party's point, rather, is best understood as
a factual one: coordinated spending is essential to parties
because "a party and its candidate are joined at the hip,"
Brief for Respondent 31, owing to the very conception of the
party as an organization formed to elect candidates. Parties, thus formed, have an especially strong working relationship with their candidates, id., at 26, and the speech this
special relationship facilitates is much more effective than
independent speech, id., at 29.

10 We have repeatedly held that political parties and other associations
derive rights from their members. E. g., Norman v. Reed, 502 U. S. 279,
288 (1992); Tashjian v. Republican Party of Conn., 479 U. S. 208, 214-215

bearer); Timmons v. Twin Cities Area New Party, 520 U. S. 351, 373
(1997) (Stevens, J., dissenting), but we have never settled upon the nature
of any such difference and have no reason to do so here.

Opinion of the Court
There are two basic arguments here. The first turns onthe relationship of a party to a candidate: a coordinated relationship between them so defines a party that it cannot func-tion as such without coordinated spending, the object of
which is a candidate's election. We think political historyand political reality belie this argument. The second argument turns on the nature of a party as uniquely able to spendin ways that promote candidate success. We think that this
argument is a double-edged sword, and one hardly limited topolitical parties.

1
The assertion that the party is so joined at the hip to can-didates that most of its spending must necessarily be coordinated spending is a statement at odds with the history ofnearly 30 years under the Act. It is well to remember that
ever since the Act was amended in 1974, coordinated spend-ing by a party committee in a given race has been limited
by the provision challenged here (or its predecessor). See18 U. S. C. $ 608(f) (1970 ed., Supp. IV); see also Buckley, 424
U. S., at 194 (reprinting then-effective Party ExpenditureProvision). It was not until 1996 and the decision in Colorado I that any spending was allowed above that amount,and since then only independent spending has been unlimited. As a consequence, the Party's claim that coordinatedspending beyond the limit imposed by the Act is essential to
its very function as a party amounts implicitly to saying thatfor almost three decades political parties have not been functional or have been functioning in systematic violation of thelaw. The Party, of course, does not in terms make either
statement, and we cannot accept either implication. Thereis no question about the closeness of candidates to parties
and no doubt that the Act affected parties' roles and theirexercise of power. But the political scientists who have
weighed in on this litigation observe that "there is little evi-dence to suggest that coordinated party spending limits
adopted by Congress have frustrated the ability of political

parties to exercise their First Amendment rights to supporttheir candidates," and that "[i]n reality, political parties are

dominant players, second only to the candidates themselves,in federal elections." Brief for Paul Allen Beck et al. as
Amici Curiae 5-6. For the Party to claim after all theseyears of strictly limited coordinated spending that unlimited
coordinated spending is essential to the nature and function-ing of parties is in reality to assert just that "metaphysical
identity," 518 U. S., at 623, between free-spending party andcandidate that we could not accept in

Colorado I.11

2
There is a different weakness in the seemingly unexcep-tionable premise that parties are organized for the purpose

of electing candidates, Brief for Respondent 26 ("Partiesexist precisely to elect candidates that share the goals of
their party"), so that imposing on the way parties serve thatfunction is uniquely burdensome. The fault here is not so
much metaphysics as myopia, a refusal to see how the powerof money actually works in the political structure.

When we look directly at a party's function in getting andspending money, it would ignore reality to think that the
party role is adequately described by speaking generally of

11 To say that history and common sense make us skeptical that parties
are uniquely incapacitated by the challenged limitations is not to deny
that limiting parties' coordinated expenditures while permitting unlimited
independent expenditures prompts parties to structure their spending in
a way that they would not otherwise choose. See post, at 470. And we
acknowledge below, infra, at 453-455, that limiting coordinated expenditures imposes some burden on parties' associational efficiency. But the
very evidence cited by the dissent suggests that it is nonetheless possible
for parties, like individuals and nonparty groups, to speak independently.
E. g., App. 218 (statement of Professor Anthony Corrado) ("[I]t is likely
that parties will allocate an increasing amount of money to independent expenditure efforts in the future"); id., at 159 (affidavit of Donald K.
Bain, Chairman of the Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee) (describing ability to make independent expenditures as "welcome").

electing particular candidates. The money parties spendcomes from contributors with their own personal interests.

PACs, for example, are frequent party contributors who (ac-cording to one of the Party's own experts) "do not pursue
the same objectives in electoral politics" that parties do.App. 180 (statement of Professor Anthony Corrado). PACs
"are most concerned with advancing their narrow interest[s]" and therefore "provide support to candidates whoshare their views, regardless of party affiliation."

fact, many PACs naturally express their narrow interestsby contributing to both parties during the same electoral

cycle,12 and sometimes even directly to two competing candi-dates in the same election, L. Sabato

are thus necessarily the instruments of some contributors
whose object is not to support the party's message or to elect
party candidates across the board, but rather to support a
specific candidate for the sake of a position on one narrow
issue, or even to support any candidate who will be obliged
to the contributors.14

Parties thus perform functions more complex than simply
electing candidates; whether they like it or not, they act as
agents for spending on behalf of those who seek to produce
obligated officeholders. It is this party role, which functionally unites parties with other self-interested political actors,
that the Party Expenditure Provision targets. This party
role, accordingly, provides good reason to view limits on coordinated spending by parties through the same lens applied
to such spending by donors, like PACs, that can use parties
as conduits for contributions meant to place candidates
under obligation.

for the Federal Corrupt Practices Act's restriction of corporate campaign
contributions:

" `We all know . . . that one of the great political evils of the time is
the apparent hold on political parties which business interests and certain
organizations seek and sometimes obtain by reason of liberal campaign
contributions. Many believe that when an individual or association of individuals makes large contributions for the purpose of aiding candidates
of political parties in winning the elections, they expect, and sometimes
demand, and occasionally, at least, receive, consideration by the beneficiaries of their contributions which not infrequently is harmful to the
general public interest.' " Id., at 576 (quoting 65 Cong. Rec. 9507-9508

Insofar as the Party suggests that its strong working rela-tionship with candidates and its unique ability to speak in

coordination with them should be taken into account in theFirst Amendment analysis, we agree. It is the accepted understanding that a party combines its members' power tospeak by aggregating contributions and broadcasting messages more widely than individual contributors generallycould afford to do, and the party marshals this power with
greater sophistication than individuals generally could, usingsuch mechanisms as speech coordinated with a candidate.
In other words, the party is efficient in generating largesums to spend and in pinpointing effective ways to spend
them. Cf. Colorado I, 518 U. S., at 637 (Thomas, J., concur-ring in judgment and dissenting in part) ("Political associations allow citizens to pool their resources and make theiradvocacy more effective").

It does not, however, follow from a party's efficiency ingetting large sums and spending intelligently that limits on
a party's coordinated spending should be scrutinized underan unusually high standard, and in fact any argument from
sophistication and power would cut both ways. On the onehand, one can seek the benefit of stricter scrutiny of a law
capping party coordinated spending by emphasizing theheavy burden imposed by limiting the most effective mechanism of sophisticated spending. And yet it is exactly this
efficiency culminating in coordinated spending that (on theGovernment's view) places a party in a position to be used

to circumvent contribution limits that apply to individualsand PACs, and thereby to exacerbate the threat of corruption and apparent corruption that those contribution limitsare aimed at reducing. As a consequence, what the Party
calls an unusual burden imposed by regulating its spendingis not a simple premise for arguing for tighter scrutiny of
limits on a party; it is the premise for a question pointing in

Opinion of the Court

the opposite direction. If the coordinated spending of other,less efficient and perhaps less practiced political actors can

be limited consistently with the Constitution, why would theConstitution forbid regulation aimed at a party whose very
efficiency in channeling benefits to candidates threatens toundermine the contribution (and hence coordinated spending) limits to which those others are unquestionably subject?

4
The preceding question assumes that parties enjoy apower and experience that sets them apart from other political spenders. But in fact the assumption is too crude.While parties command bigger spending budgets than most
individuals, some individuals could easily rival party commit-tees in spending. Rich political activists crop up, and the
United States has known its Citizens Kane. Their moneyspeaks loudly, too, and they are therefore burdened by restrictions on its use just as parties are. And yet they arevalidly subject to coordinated spending limits, Buckley, 424
U. S., at 46-47, and so are PACs, id., at 35-36, 46-47, whichmay amass bigger treasuries than most party members can
spare for politics.15Just as rich donors, media executives, and PACs have the
means to speak as loudly as parties do, they would also havethe capacity to work effectively in tandem with a candidate,
just as a party can do. While a candidate has no way ofcoordinating spending with every contributor, there is nothing hard about coordinating with someone with a fortune todonate, any more than a candidate would have difficulty in
coordinating spending with an inner circle of personal politi-cal associates or with his own family. Yet all of them are

15 By noting that other political actors are validly burdened by limitations on their coordinated spending, we do not mean to take a position as
to the wisdom of policies that promote one source of campaign funding or
another. Cf. Brief for Respondent 27, n. 17 (citing academic support for
expanding the role of parties in campaign finance).

subject to coordinated spending limits upheld in Buckley,supra, at 53, n. 59. A party, indeed, is now like some of

these political actors in yet another way: in its right underColorado I to spend money in support of a candidate without
legal limit so long as it spends independently. A party mayspend independently every cent it can raise wherever it
thinks its candidate will shine, on every subject and anyviewpoint.

A party is not, therefore, in a unique position. It is in thesame position as some individuals and PACs, as to whom
coordinated spending limits have already been held valid,
Buckley, supra, at 46-47; and, indeed, a party is better off,for a party has the special privilege the others do not enjoy,

of making coordinated expenditures up to the limit of theParty Expenditure Provision.

5
The Party's arguments for being treated differently fromother political actors subject to limitation on political spending under the Act do not pan out. Despite decades of limita-tion on coordinated spending, parties have not been rendered
useless. In reality, parties continue to organize to elect can-didates, and also function for the benefit of donors whose
object is to place candidates under obligation, a fact that par-ties cannot escape. Indeed, parties' capacity to concentrate
power to elect is the very capacity that apparently opensthem to exploitation as channels for circumventing contribution and coordinated spending limits binding on other politi-cal players. And some of these players could marshal the
same power and sophistication for the same electoral objec-tives as political parties themselves.

16 This is the position of the FEC in the aftermath of Colorado I: that a
party committee may make coordinated expenditures up to the amount of
its expenditure limit, in addition to the amount of direct contributions
permitted by the generally applicable contribution limit. Brief for Petitioner 5-6, and n. 3.

REPUBLICAN FEDERAL CAMPAIGN COMM.

Opinion of the Court

We accordingly apply to a party's coordinated spendinglimitation the same scrutiny we have applied to the other

political actors, that is, scrutiny appropriate for a contribu-tion limit, enquiring whether the restriction is "closely
drawn" to match what we have recognized as the "suffi-ciently important" government interest in combating political corruption. Shrink Missouri, 528 U. S., at 387-388(quoting

Buckley, supra, at 25, 30).17 With the standardthus settled, the issue remains whether adequate evidentiary grounds exist to sustain the limit under that stand-ard, on the theory that unlimited coordinated spending by
a party raises the risk of corruption (and its appearance)through circumvention of valid contribution limits. Indeed,
all Members of the Court agree that circumvention is a validtheory of corruption; the remaining bone of contention is
evidentiary.18

17 Whether a different characterization, and hence a different type of
scrutiny, could be appropriate in the context of an as-applied challenge
focused on application of the limit to specific expenditures is a question
that, as Justice Thomas notes, post, at 468, n. 2, we need not reach in
this facial challenge. Cf. Brief for Petitioner 9, n. 5 (noting that the FEC
has solicited comments regarding possible criteria for identifying coordinated expenditures).

The Party appears to argue that even if the Party Expenditure Provision is justified with regard to coordinated expenditures that amount to
no more than payment of the candidate's bills, the limitation is facially
invalid because of its potential application to expenditures that involve
more of the party's own speech. Brief for Respondent 48-49. But the
Party does not tell us what proportion of the spending falls in one category
or the other, or otherwise lay the groundwork for its facial overbreadth
claim. Cf. Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U. S. 601 (1973) (overbreadth
must be substantial to trigger facial invalidation).

18 Apart from circumvention, the FEC also argues that the Party Expenditure Provision is justified by a concern with quid pro quo arrangements and similar corrupting relationships between candidates and parties
themselves, see Brief for Petitioner 33-38. We find no need to reach that
argument because the evidence supports the long-recognized rationale of
combating circumvention of contribution limits designed to combat the
corrupting influence of large contributions to candidates from individuals

Since there is no recent experience with unlimited coordi-nated spending, the question is whether experience under

the present law confirms a serious threat of abuse from theunlimited coordinated party spending as the Government
contends. Cf. Burson v. Freeman, 504 U. S. 191, 208 (1992)(opinion of Blackmun, J.) (noting difficulty of mustering evidence to support long-enforced statutes). It clearly does.Despite years of enforcement of the challenged limits, substantial evidence demonstrates how candidates, donors, andparties test the limits of the current law, and it shows beyond
serious doubt how contribution limits would be eroded if in-ducement to circumvent them were enhanced by declaring
parties' coordinated spending wide open.19
and nonparty groups. The dissent does not take issue with this justification as a theoretical matter. See also 213 F. 3d 1221, 1232 (CA10 2000)
(Court of Appeals acknowledging circumvention as a possible "avenue of
abuse").

19 In Colorado I, the principal opinion suggested that the Party Expenditure Provision was not enacted out of "a special concern about the potentially `corrupting' effect of party expenditures, but rather for the constitutionally insufficient purpose of reducing what [Congress] saw as wasteful
and excessive campaign spending." 518 U. S., at 618. That observation
was relevant to our examination of the Party Expenditure Provision as
applied to independent expenditures, see id., at 617-618, limits on which
were invalidated with regard to other political actors in Buckley in part
because they were justified by concern with wasteful campaign spending,
Buckley, 424 U. S., at 57. Our point in Colorado I was that there was no
evidence that Congress had a special motivation regarding parties that
would justify limiting their independent expenditures after similar limits
imposed on other spenders had been invalidated. As for the Party Expenditure Provision's application to coordinated expenditures, on the other
hand, the evidence discussed in the text suggests that the anticircumvention rationale that justifies other coordinated expenditure limits, see Buckley, supra, at 46-47, is at work here as well. The dissent ignores this
distinction, post, at 475, but neither the dissent nor the Party seriously
argues that Congress was not concerned with circumvention of contribution limits using parties as conduits. All acknowledge that Congress
enacted other measures prompted by just that concern. See post, at 481;

may give as much as another $20,000 each year to a nationalparty committee supporting the candidate.

would expect to occur has occurred. Donors give to theparty with the tacit understanding that the favored candidate will benefit. See App. 247 (declaration of Robert Hick-mott, former Democratic fundraiser and National Finance

Opinion of the Court
Although the understanding between donor and party mayinvolve no definite commitment and may be tacit on the donor's part, the frequency of the practice and the volume ofmoney involved has required some manner of informal bookkeeping by the recipient. In the Democratic Party, at least,the method is known as "tallying," a system that helps to
connect donors to candidates through the accommodation of aparty. See App. 246-247 (Hickmott declaration) ("[The tally
system] is an informal agreement between the DSCC andthe candidates' campaigns that if you help the DSCC raise
contributions, we will turn around and help your campaign");
id., at 268 (declaration of former Senator Paul Simon) ("Do-nors would be told the money they contributed could be credited to any Senate candidate. The callers would make clearthat this was not a direct contribution, but it was fairly close
to direct"); id., at 165-166 (Billings declaration) ("Thereappeared to be an understanding between the DSCC and

22 The dissent dismisses this evidence as describing "legal" practices.

Post, at 479. The dissent may be correct that the FEC considers tallying
legal, see Reply Brief for Petitioner 9, n. 3, but one thing is clear: tallying
is a sign that contribution limits are being diluted and could be diluted
further if the floodgates were open. Why, after all, does a party bother
to tally? The obvious answer is that it wants to know who gets the benefit of the contributions to the party, as the record quotations attest. See
also n. 23, infra. And the fact that the parties may not fund sure losers,
stressed by the dissent (post, at 478-479), is irrelevant. The issue is what
would become of contribution limits if parties could use unlimited coordinated spending to funnel contributions to those serious contenders who
are favored by the donors.

Opinion of the Court

done independently, and thus less desirably from the point ofview of a donor and his favored candidate. If suddenly

every dollar of spending could be coordinated with the candi-date, the inducement to circumvent would almost certainly
intensify. Indeed, if a candidate could be assured that dona-tions through a party could result in funds passed through
to him for spending on virtually identical items as his owncampaign funds, a candidate enjoying the patronage of affluent contributors would have a strong incentive not merelyto direct donors to his party, but to promote circumvention
as a step toward reducing the number of donors requiringtime-consuming cultivation. If a candidate could arrange
for a party committee to foot his bills, to be paid with $20,000contributions to the party by his supporters, the number of
donors necessary to raise $1,000,000 could be reduced from500 (at $2,000 per cycle) to 46 (at $2,000 to the candidate and
$20,000 to the party, without regard to donations outside theelection year).

23

23 Any such dollar-for-dollar pass-through would presumably be too obvious to escape the special provision on earmarking, 2 U. S. C. $ 441a(a)(8),
see infra, at 462. But the example illustrates the undeniable inducement
to more subtle circumvention.

The same enhanced value of coordinated spending that could be expected to promote greater circumvention of contribution limits for the
benefit of the candidate-fundraiser would probably enhance the power of
the fundraiser to use circumvention as a tactic to increase personal power
and a claim to party leadership. The affluent nominee can already do this
to a limited extent, by directing donations to the party and making sure
that the party knows who raised the money, and that the needier candidates who receive the benefit of party spending know whom to thank.
The candidate can thus become a player beyond his own race, and the
donor's influence is multiplied. See generally App. 249 (Hickmott declaration) ("Incumbents who were not raising money for themselves because
they were not up for reelection would sometimes raise money for other
Senators, or for challengers. They would send $20,000 to the DSCC and
ask that this be entered on another candidate's tally. They might do this,
for example, if they were planning to run for a leadership position and
wanted to obtain the support of the Senators they assisted"). If the effectiveness of party spending could be enhanced by limitless coordination,

While this evidence rules out denying the potential for
corruption by circumvention, the Party does try to minimize
the threat. It says that most contributions to parties are
small, with negligible corrupting momentum to be carried
through the party conduit. Brief for Respondent 14. But
some contributions are not small; they can go up to $20,000,
2 U. S. C. $ 441a(a)(1)(B),24 and the record shows that even
under present law substantial donations turn the parties into
matchmakers whose special meetings and receptions give
the donors the chance to get their points across to the candidates.25 The Party again discounts the threat of outflanking
contribution limits on individuals and nonparty groups by
stressing that incumbent candidates give more excess campaign funds to parties than parties spend on coordinated
expenditures. Brief for Respondent 34. But the fact that
parties may do well for themselves off incumbents does not
defuse concern over circumvention; if contributions to a
party were not used as a funnel from donors to candidates,
there would be no reason for using the tallying system the
way the witnesses have described it.

large donors would be reinforced as well. Party officials who control distribution of coordinated expenditures would obviously form an additional
link in this chain. See id., at 164, 168 (Billings declaration) ("[The DSCC's
three-member Executive Committee] basically made the decisions as to
how to distribute the money. . . . Taking away the limits on coordinated
expenditures would result in a fundamental transferal of power to certain
individual Senators").

24 In 1996, 46 percent of itemized (over $200) individual contributions to

462 FEDERAL ELECTION COMM'N v. COLORADO

REPUBLICAN FEDERAL CAMPAIGN COMM.

Opinion of the Court

Finally, the Party falls back to claiming that, even if thereis a threat of circumvention, the First Amendment demands

a response better tailored to that threat than a limitation onspending, even coordinated spending.

Id., at 46-48. The
Party has two suggestions.First, it says that better crafted safeguards are in place

already, in particular the earmarking rule of $ 441a(a)(8),
which provides that contributions that "are in any way ear-marked or otherwise directed through an intermediary or

conduit to [a] candidate" are treated as contributions to thecandidate. The Party says that this provision either suffices
to address any risk of circumvention or would suffice if clarified to cover practices like tallying. Id., at 42, 47; see also
213 F. 3d, at 1232. This position, however, ignores the practical difficulty of identifying and directly combating circumvention under actual political conditions. Donations are
made to a party by contributors who favor the party's candidates in races that affect them; donors are (of course) permitted to express their views and preferences to party officials;
and the party is permitted (as we have held it must be) to
spend money in its own right. When this is the environment for contributions going into a general party treasury,
and candidate-fundraisers are rewarded with something less
obvious than dollar-for-dollar pass-throughs (distributed
through contributions and party spending), circumvention is
obviously very hard to trace. The earmarking provision,
even if it dealt directly with tallying, would reach only the
most clumsy attempts to pass contributions through to candidates. To treat the earmarking provision as the outer limit
of acceptable tailoring would disarm any serious effort to
limit the corrosive effects of what Chief Judge Seymour
called " `understandings' regarding what donors give what
amounts to the party, which candidates are to receive what
funds from the party, and what interests particular donors
are seeking to promote," id., at 1241 (dissenting opinion); see

form, 100 Colum. L. Rev. 620, 652 (2000) (describing "web ofrelations linking major donors, party committees, and

elected officials").26The Party's second preferred prescription for the threat of
an end run calls for replacing limits on coordinated expendi-tures by parties with limits on contributions to parties, the
latter supposedly imposing a lesser First Amendment bur-den. Brief for Respondent 46-48. The Party thus invokes
the general rule that contribution limits take a lesser FirstAmendment toll, expenditure limits a greater one. That
was one strand of the reasoning in Buckley itself, which re-jected the argument that limitations on independent expenditures by individuals, groups, and candidates were justifiablein order to avoid circumvention of contribution limitations.
424 U. S., at 44. It was also one strand of the logic of the
Colorado I principal opinion in rejecting the Party Expendi-ture Provision's application to independent party expenditures. 518 U. S., at 617.27In each of those cases, however, the Court's reasoning contained another strand. The analysis ultimately turned onthe understanding that the expenditures at issue were not
potential alter egos for contributions, but were independentand therefore functionally true expenditures, qualifying for
the most demanding First Amendment scrutiny employedin

accepted by the dissent, post, at 481, would invite a corresponding attack
on all contribution limits. As we said in Buckley, 424 U. S., at 27-28, and
Shrink Missouri, 528 U. S., at 390, the policy supporting contribution limits is the same as for laws against bribery. But we do not throw out the
contribution limits for unskillful tailoring; prohibitions on bribery, like the
earmarking provision here, address only the "most blatant and specific"
attempts at corruption, 424 U. S., at 28.

27 The dissent therefore suggests, post, at 482, and the District Court

mistakenly concluded, see discussion n. 21, supra, that Colorado I disposed
of the tailoring question for purposes of this case.

convincing evidence to the contrary," that the Party's independent expenditures formed a link in a chain of corruptionby-conduit. 518 U. S., at 617. "The absence of prearrangement and coordination of an expenditure with the candidate
or his agent not only undermines the value of the expenditure to the candidate, but also alleviates the danger that
expenditures will be given as a quid pro quo for improper
commitments from the candidate," Buckley, supra, at 47;
therefore, "the constitutionally significant fact" in Colorado
I was "the lack of coordination between the candidate and
the source of the expenditure," 518 U. S., at 617.

Here, however, just the opposite is true. There is no significant functional difference between a party's coordinated
expenditure and a direct party contribution to the candidate, and there is good reason to expect that a party's right
of unlimited coordinated spending would attract increased
contributions to parties to finance exactly that kind of
spending.28 Coordinated expenditures of money donated to
a party are tailor-made to undermine contribution limits.
Therefore the choice here is not, as in Buckley and Colorado
I, between a limit on pure contributions and pure expenditures.29 The choice is between limiting contributions and

28 The dissent notes a superficial tension between this analysis and our
recent statement in Bartnicki v. Vopper, 532 U. S. 514 (2001), that "it
would be quite remarkable to hold that speech by a law-abiding [entity]
can be suppressed in order to deter conduct by a non-law-abiding third
party," id., at 529-530. Unlike Bartnicki, there is no clear dichotomy
here between law abider and lawbreaker. The problem of circumvention
is a systemic one, accomplished only through complicity between donor
and party.

29 Also, again, contrast Bartnicki, where the gulf between the First

Amendment implications of two enforcement options was clear. We rejected the decision to penalize disclosure of lawfully obtained information
of public interest instead of vigorously enforcing prohibitions on intercepting private conversations. Ibid.

We hold that a party's coordinated expenditures, unlikeexpenditures truly independent, may be restricted to minimize circumvention of contribution limits. We therefore re-ject the Party's facial challenge and, accordingly, reverse the
judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for theTenth Circuit.

It is so ordered.

Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Scalia and Justice Kennedy join, and with whom The Chief Justicejoins as to Part II, dissenting.

The Party Expenditure Provision, 2 U. S. C. $ 441a(d)(3),severely limits the amount of money that a national or state
committee of a political party can spend in coordination withits own candidate for the Senate or House of Representatives. See ante, at 438-439, and n. 3. Because this provi-sion sweeps too broadly, interferes with the party-candidate
relationship, and has not been proved necessary to combatcorruption, I respectfully dissent.

Amendment safeguards to filing lawsuits, wearing profane
jackets, and exhibiting drive-in movies with nudity,1 but hasoffered only tepid protection to the core speech and associational rights that our Founders sought to defend.In this case, the Government does not attempt to argue
that the Party Expenditure Provision satisfies strict scru-tiny, see

Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn.,
460 U. S. 37, 45 (1983) (providing that, under strict scrutiny,a restriction on speech is constitutional only if it is narrowly

tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest). Norcould it. For the reasons explained in my separate opinions
in Colorado I, supra, at 641-644, and Shrink Missouri,

strict scrutiny.

We need not, however, overrule Buckley and apply strictscrutiny in order to hold the Party Expenditure Provision

unconstitutional. Even under Buckley, which described the
requisite scrutiny as "exacting" and "rigorous," 424 U. S., at16, 29, the regulation cannot pass constitutional muster. In

practice, Buckley scrutiny has meant that restrictions oncontributions by individuals and political committees do not
violate the First Amendment so long as they are "closelydrawn" to match a "sufficiently important" government interest, Shrink Missouri, supra, at 387-389; see also Buckley,

tures are constitutionally invalid, see Buckley, supra, at
58-59; see also Federal Election Comm'n v. National Conservative Political Action Comm., 470 U. S. 480, 501 (1985).
The rationale for this distinction between contributions and
independent expenditures has been that, whereas ceilings on
contributions by individuals and political committees "entai[l] only a marginal restriction" on First Amendment interests, Buckley, 424 U. S., at 20, limitations on independent
expenditures "impose significantly more severe restrictions
on protected freedoms of political expression and association," id., at 23.

A

The Court notes this existing rationale and attempts simply to treat coordinated expenditures by political parties
as equivalent to contributions by individuals and political
committees. Thus, at least implicitly, the Court draws two
conclusions: coordinated expenditures are no different from
contributions, and political parties are no different from
individuals and political committees. Both conclusions are
flawed.

1

The Court considers a coordinated expenditure to be an
" `expenditur[e] made by any person in cooperation, consultation, or concert, with, or at the request or suggestion of,
a candidate, his authorized political committees, or their
agents.' " Ante, at 438 (quoting 2 U. S. C. $ 441a(a)(7)(B)(i)).
This definition covers a broad array of conduct, some of
which is akin to an independent expenditure. At one extreme, to be sure, are outlays that are "virtually indistinguishable from simple contributions." Colorado I, 518 U. S.,
at 624 (opinion of Breyer, J.). An example would be "a
donation of money with direct payment of a candidate's
media bills." Ibid. But toward the other end of the spectrum are expenditures that largely resemble, and should be
entitled to the same protection as, independent expenditures.

REPUBLICAN FEDERAL CAMPAIGN COMM.

Thomas, J., dissenting

Take, for example, a situation in which the party develops atelevision advertising campaign touting a candidate's record

on education, and the party simply "consult[s]," 2 U. S. C.$ 441a(a)(7)(B)(i), with the candidate on which time slot the
advertisement should run for maximum effectiveness. I seeno constitutional difference between this expenditure and a
purely independent one. In the language of Buckley, theadvertising campaign is not a mere "general expression of
support for the candidate and his views," but a communica-tion of "the underlying basis for the support." 424 U. S., at
21. It is not just "symbolic expression," ibid., but a clearmanifestation of the party's most fundamental political
views. By restricting such speech, the Party ExpenditureProvision undermines parties' "freedom to discuss candidates and issues," ibid., and cannot be reconciled with ourcampaign finance jurisprudence.

2
Even if I were to ignore the breadth of the statutory text,and to assume that all coordinated expenditures are functionally equivalent to contributions,2 I still would strike downthe Party Expenditure Provision. The source of the "contribution" at issue is a political party, not an individual ora political committee, as in Buckley and Shrink Missouri.

2 The Court makes this very assumption. See ante, at 464 ("There is
no significant functional difference between a party's coordinated expenditure and a direct party contribution to the candidate"). To the extent the
Court has not defined the universe of coordinated expenditures and leaves
open the possibility that there are such expenditures that would not be
functionally identical to direct contributions, the constitutionality of the
Party Expenditure Provision as applied to such expenditures remains unresolved. See, e. g., ante, at 456, n. 17. At oral argument, the Government appeared to suggest that the Party Expenditure Provision might not
reach expenditures that are not functionally identical to contributions.
See Tr. of Oral Arg. 15 (stating that the purpose of the Party Expenditure
Provision is simply to prevent someone "from making contributions in the
form of paying the candidate's bills").

Restricting contributions by individuals and political com-mittees may, under

Buckley, entail only a "marginal restriction," Buckley, supra, at 20, but the same cannot be saidabout limitations on political parties.

Political parties and their candidates are "inextricably in-tertwined" in the conduct of an election.

Colorado I, supra,
at 630 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment and dissenting
in part). A party nominates its candidate; a candidate oftenis identified by party affiliation throughout the election and

on the ballot; and a party's public image is largely defined bywhat its candidates say and do. See,

e. g., California Democratic Party v. Jones, 530 U. S. 567, 575 (2000) ("Some political parties--such as President Theodore Roosevelt's Bull
Moose Party, the La Follette Progressives of 1924, the Henry
Wallace Progressives of 1948, and the George Wallace American Independent Party of 1968--are virtually inseparable
from their nominees (and tend not to outlast them"); see also
M. Zak, Back to Basics for the Republican Party 1 (2000)
(noting that the Republican Party has been identified as the
"Party of Lincoln"). Most importantly, a party's success or
failure depends in large part on whether its candidates get
elected. Because of this unity of interest, it is natural for a
party and its candidate to work together and consult with
one another during the course of the election. See, e. g.,
App. 137 (declaration of Herbert E. Alexander, Director of
the Citizens' Research Foundation at the University of
Southern California). Indeed, "it would be impractical and
imprudent . . . for a party to support its own candidates without some form of `cooperation' or `consultation.' " See Colorado I, 518 U. S., at 630 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment and dissenting in part). "[C]andidates are necessary
to make the party's message known and effective, and vice
versa." Id., at 629. Thus, the ordinary means for a party
to provide support is to make coordinated expenditures, see,
e. g., App. 137-138 (declaration of Herbert E. Alexander), as
the Government itself maintained just five years ago, see

Brief for Respondent in Colorado I, O. T. 1995, No. 95-489,p. 27 (contending that Congress had made an "empirical judgment that party officials will as a matter of course consultwith the party's candidates before funding communications
intended to influence the outcome of a federal election");see also FEC Advisory Opinion 1985-14, CCH Fed. Election Camp. Fin. Guide || 5819, p. 11,186, n. 4 (1985) ("Party

As the District Court explained, to break this link betweenthe party and its candidates would impose "additional costs
and burdens to promote the party message." 41 F. Supp. 2d1197, 1210 (Colo. 1999). This observation finds full support
in the record. See, e. g., App. 218 (statement of AnthonyCorrado, Associate Professor of Government, Colby College)
(explaining that, to ensure that expenditures were independ-ent, party organizations had to establish legally separate
entities, which in turn had to "rent and furnish an office, hirestaff, and pay other administrative costs," as well as "engage
additional consulting services" and "duplicate many of the
functions already being undertaken by other party offices");
id., at 52 (statement by Federal Election Commission admitting that national party established separate entities that
made independent expenditures); id., at 217 (statement of

p. 512 (report of Frank J. Sorauf, professor at University

tends to create voter confusion and to undermine the candidate that the party sought to support. App. 220 (statement
of Anthony Corrado); App. in No. 99-1211 (CA10), at 623-624

(deposition of John Heubusch); App. 159 (affidavit of Donald
K. Bain) ("[O]ur communications can be more focused, understandable, and effective if the Party and its candidates can
work together"). Finally, because of the ambiguity in the
term "coordinated expenditure," the Party Expenditure Provision chills permissible speech as well. See, e. g., id., at
159-160 (affidavit of Donald K. Bain). Thus, far from being
a mere "marginal" restraint on speech, Buckley, 424 U. S., at
20, the Party Expenditure Provision has restricted the party's most natural form of communication; has precluded parties "from effectively amplifying the voice of their adherents," id., at 22; and has had a "stifling effect on the ability
of the party to do what it exists to do." 3 Colorado I, supra,
at 630 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment and dissenting
in part).

The Court nevertheless concludes that these concerns of
inhibiting party speech are rendered "implausible" by the
nearly 30 years of history in which coordinated spending has
been statutorily limited. Ante, at 449. Without a single
citation to the record, the Court rejects the assertion "that
for almost three decades political parties have not been func3 The Court contends that, notwithstanding this burden, "it is nonetheless possible for parties, like individuals and nonparty groups, to speak
independently." Ante, at 450, n. 11 (emphasis added). That is correct,
but it does not render the restriction constitutional. If Congress were
to pass a law imposing a $1,000 tax on every political newspaper editorial, the law would surely constitute an unconstitutional restraint on
speech, even though it would still be possible for newspapers to print
such editorials.

The Court's holding presents an additional First Amendment problem.
Because of the close relationship between parties and candidates, lower
courts will face a difficult, if not insurmountable, task in trying to determine whether particular party expenditures are in fact coordinated or independent. As the American Civil Liberties Union points out, "[e]ven if
such an inquiry is feasible, it inevitably would involve an intrusive and
constitutionally troubling investigation of the inner workings of political
parties." Brief for American Civil Liberties Union et al. as Amici Curiae 18.

tional or have been functioning in systematic violation of thelaw." Ibid. I am unpersuaded by the Court's attempts to

downplay the extent of the burden on political parties' FirstAmendment rights. First, the Court does not examine the
record or the findings of the District Court, but instead relieswholly on the "observ[ations]" of the "political scientists"
who happen to have written an amicus brief in support ofthe petitioner.

Ibid. I find more convincing, and more rel-evant, the record evidence that the parties have developed,

which, as noted above, indicates that parties have sufferedas a result of the Party Expenditure Provision.

4 See supra,

at 470-471. Second, we have never before upheld a limita-tion on speech simply because speakers have coped with the

limitation for 30 years. See, e. g., Bartnicki v. Vopper, 532U. S. 514, 517 (2001) (holding unconstitutional under the
First Amendment restrictions on the disclosure of the con-tents of an illegally intercepted communication, even though
federal law had prohibited such disclosure for 67 years).And finally, if the passage of time were relevant to the constitutional inquiry, I would wonder why the Court adopted

4 Moreover, were I to depart from the record, as does the Court, I could
consider sources suggesting that parties in fact have lost power in recent
years. See, e. g., M. Wattenberg, The Decline of American Political Parties, 1952-1996, p. 174 (1998) (indicating that percentage of voters who
identify with a party has declined while percentage of split tickets has
increased); Maisel, American Political Parties: Still Central to a Functioning Democracy?, in American Political Parties: Decline or Resurgence?,
103, 107-111 (J. Cohen, R. Fleisher, & P. Kantor eds. 2001) (describing
weaknesses of modern political parties). I also could explore how political
parties have coped with the restrictions on coordinated expenditures. As
Justice Kennedy has explained, "[t]he Court has forced a substantial
amount of political speech underground, as contributors and candidates
devise ever more elaborate methods of avoiding contribution limits."
Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U. S. 377, 406 (2000)
(dissenting opinion). Perhaps political parties have survived, not because
the regulation at issue imposes less than a substantial burden on speech,
but simply because the parties have found "underground" alternatives
for communication.

a "30-year" rule rather than the possible countervailing"200-year" rule. For nearly 200 years, this country had

congressional elections without limitations on coordinatedexpenditures by political parties. Nowhere does the Court
suggest that these elections were not "functional," ante, at449, or that they were marred by corruption.

The Court's only other response to the argument that parties are linked to candidates and that breaking this linkwould impose significant costs on speech is no response at

all. The Court contends that parties are not organized sim-ply to "elec[t] particular candidates" as evidenced by the fact
that many political action committees donate money to both
parties and sometimes even opposing candidates. Ante, at
451. According to the Court, "[p]arties are thus necessarily
the instruments of some contributors whose object is not to
support the party's message or to elect party candidates
across the board." Ante, at 451-452. There are two flaws
in the Court's analysis. First, no one argues that a party's
role is merely to get particular candidates elected. Surely,
among other reasons, parties also exist to develop and promote a platform. See, e. g., Brief for Respondent 23. The
point is simply that parties and candidates have shared interests, that it is natural for them to work together, and that
breaking the connection between parties and their candidates inhibits the promotion of the party's message. Second, the mere fact that some donors contribute to both parties and their candidates does not necessarily imply that the
donors control the parties or their candidates. It certainly
does not mean that the parties are mere "instruments" or
"agents," ante, at 452, of the donors. Indeed, if a party receives money from donors on both sides of an issue, how can
it be a tool of both donors? If the Green Party were to
receive a donation from an industry that pollutes, would the
Green Party necessarily become, through no choice of its
own, an instrument of the polluters? The Court proffers no
evidence that parties have become pawns of wealthy contrib533US2 Unit: $U82 [11-01-02 19:18:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN

utors. Parties might be the target of the speech of donors,but that does not suggest that parties are influenced (let

alone improperly influenced) by the speech. Thus, the
Court offers no explanation for why political parties should
be treated the same as individuals and political committees.

B
But even if I were to view parties' coordinated expenditures as akin to contributions by individuals and political
committees, I still would hold the Party Expenditure Provision constitutionally invalid. Under Shrink Missouri, a
contribution limit is constitutional only if the Government
demonstrates that the regulation is "closely drawn" to match
a "sufficiently important interest." 528 U. S., at 387-388
(quoting Buckley, 424 U. S., at 25) (internal quotation marks
omitted). In this case, there is no question that the Government has asserted a sufficient interest, that of preventing
corruption. See Shrink Missouri, supra, at 388 (" `[T]he
prevention of corruption and the appearance of corruption'
was found to be a `constitutionally sufficient justification' ")
(quoting Buckley, supra, at 25-26). The question is whether
the Government has demonstrated both that coordinated expenditures by parties give rise to corruption and that the
restriction is "closely drawn" to curb this corruption. I believe it has not.

As this Court made clear just last Term, "[w]e have never
accepted mere conjecture as adequate to carry a First
Amendment burden." Shrink Missouri, 528 U. S., at 392.
Some "quantum of empirical evidence [is] needed to satisfy
heightened judicial scrutiny of legislative judgments." Id.,
at 391. Precisely how much evidence is required will "vary
up or down with the novelty and plausibility of the justification raised." Ibid. Today, the Court has jettisoned this
evidentiary requirement.

Considering that we have never upheld an expenditurelimitation against political parties, I would posit that substantial evidence is necessary to justify the infringement ofparties' First Amendment interests. But we need not accept this high evidentiary standard to strike down the PartyExpenditure Provision for want of evidence. Under the
least demanding evidentiary requirement, the Governmenthas failed to carry its burden, for it has presented no evidence at all of corruption or the perception of corruption.The Government does not, and indeed cannot, point to any
congressional findings suggesting that the Party Expendi-ture Provision is necessary, or even helpful, in reducing corruption or the perception of corruption. In fact, this Courthas recognized that "Congress wrote the Party Expenditure
Provision not so much because of a special concern aboutthe potentially `corrupting' effect of party expenditures, but
rather for the constitutionally insufficient purpose of re-ducing what it saw as wasteful and excessive campaign
spending." 5 Colorado I, 518 U. S., at 618. See also ibid.("[R]ather than indicating a special fear of the corruptive
influence of political parties, the legislative history demon-strates Congress' general desire to enhance what was seen

This "distinction" must have been lost on Congress as well, which made
no finding that the Party Expenditure Provision serves different purposes
for different expenditures. It also was lost on the Court in Colorado I,
which stated in no uncertain terms that Congress was not motivated by
"the potentially `corrupting' effect of party expenditures." 518 U. S., at

record that the parties have since developed, such a departure might be justified. But as the District Court found,
"[t]he facts which [the] FEC contends support its position . . .
do not establish that the limit on party coordinated expenditures is necessary to prevent corruption or the appearance
thereof." 41 F. Supp. 2d, at 1211. Indeed, "[n]one of the
FEC's examples [of alleged corruption] involve[s] coordinated
expenditures." Ibid. See also App. in No. 99-1211 (CA10),
at 346 (declaration of Herbert E. Alexander) ("In the decades
since 1974, when coordinated expenditures were allowed for
both presidential and congressional campaigns, there has not
been any dispute relating to them, no charges of corruption
or the appearance thereof . . ."); id., at 430 (statement of
Anthony Corrado) ("There is no academic analysis or scholarly study conducted to date that demonstrates that parties
are corrupted by the federally regulated contributions, the
so-called `hard-money funds,' they receive from donors.
None of the studies of party finance or party coordinated
spending contend[s] that these funds are corruptive or generate the appearance of corruption in the political process");
id., at 624 (deposition of John Heubusch) (testifying that, in
his experience, political party spending was not a source of
corruption of Members of the United States Senate).6

The dearth of evidence is unsurprising in light of the
unique relationship between a political party and its candidates: "The very aim of a political party is to influence
its candidate's stance on issues and, if the candidate takes
office or is reelected, his votes." Colorado I, 518 U. S., at

Eighth Circuit held that the State of Missouri's restrictions on contributions by political parties violated the First Amendment. In accord with
the Tenth Circuit in this case, the Eighth Circuit concluded that "the record is wholly devoid of any evidence that limiting parties' campaign contributions will either reduce corruption or measurably decrease the number
of occasions on which limitations on individuals' campaign contributions
are circumvented." Id., at 1073.

in part). If coordinated expenditures help achieve this
aim, the achievement "does not . . . constitute `a subversion
of the political process.' " Ibid. (quoting Federal Election
Comm'n, 470 U. S., at 497). It is simply the essence of our
Nation's party system of government. One can speak of an
individual citizen or a political action committee corrupting
or coercing a candidate, but "[w]hat could it mean for a party
to `corrupt' its candidate or to exercise `coercive' influence
over him?" 518 U. S., at 646.

Apparently unable to provide an answer to this question,
the Court relies upon an alternative theory of corruption.
According to the Court, the Party Expenditure Provision
helps combat circumvention of the limits on individual donors' contributions, which limits are necessary to reduce corruption by those donors.7 See ante, at 452-455. The primary problem with this contention, however, is that it too
is plainly contradicted by the findings of the District Court,
see 41 F. Supp. 2d, at 1211, and the overwhelming evidence in the record, see supra, at 475.8 And this contention is particularly surprising in light of Colorado I, in which
we discussed the same opportunity for corruption through
circumvention, and, far from finding it dispositive, concluded

7 The Court does not argue that the Party Expenditure Provision is
necessary to reduce the perception of corruption. Nor could the record
sustain such an argument. See 41 F. Supp. 2d 1197, 1211 (Colo. 1999).

8 Contrary to the Court's suggestion, ante, at 459, n. 21, the District

Court did not simply conclude that "Colorado I had rejected the anticircumvention rationale as a matter of law." Instead, the District Court
first concluded there was no evidence of corruption, 41 F. Supp. 2d, at
1211. Only after the District Court made this factual finding did it, in a
footnote, cite Colorado I to support the legal conclusion. See 41 F. Supp.
2d, at 1211, n. 9 ("Moreover, if the skirting of contribution limits is the
issue with which the FEC is concerned . . . there are more tailored means
of addressing such a concern than limiting the coordinated expenditure
limits" (citing Colorado I)).

that any opportunity for corruption was, "at best, attenu-ated." 518 U. S., at 616.

Without addressing the District Court's determination orreflecting on this Court's understanding in

Colorado I, the
Court today asserts that its newfound position is supportedby "substantial evidence." The best evidence the Court can

come up with, however, is the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee's (DSCC) use of the "tally system," which"connect[s] donors to candidates through the accommodation

of a party." Ante, at 459. The tally system is not evidenceof corruption-by-circumvention. In actuality, the DSCC is
not acting as a mere conduit, allowing donors to contribute
money in excess of the legal limits. The DSCC instead has
allocated money based on a number of factors, including "the
financial strength of the campaign," "what [the candidate's]
poll numbers looked like," and "who had the best chance of
winning or who needed the money most." App. 250-251
(declaration of Robert Hickmott, former Democratic fundraiser and National Finance Director for Timothy Wirth's
Senate campaign); see also App. in No. 99-1211 (CA10), at
430 (statement of Anthony Corrado) ("When parties are deciding whether to spend funds on behalf of a candidate, they
chiefly examine the competitiveness of the district or race,
the political situation of the incumbent, and the strength of
the party contender's candidacy"); id., at 563 (deposition of
Donald Bain) (stating that the party generally did not support someone who has a safe seat or is clearly not going to
win). As the District Court found, "the primary consideration in allocating funds is which races are marginal--that
is, which races are ones where party money could be the
difference between winning and losing." 41 F. Supp. 2d, at
1203. "Maintaining party control over seats is paramount
to the parties' pursuits." Ibid.; see also App. in No. 99-1211
(CA10), at 483 (stating that primary goal of legislative campaign committees is "to win or maintain control of the chamber and the powers of the majority legislative party"). The

"bottom line" of the tally system is that "some candidatesget back more money than they raise, and others get back

less." App. 250 (declaration of Robert Hickmott).Moreover, the Court does not explain how the tally system
could constitute evidence of corruption. Both the initialcontribution to the party and the subsequent expenditure by
the party on the candidate are currently legal. In essence,the Court is asserting that it is corrupt for parties to do what
is legal to enhance their participation in the political process.Each step in the process is permitted, but the combination
of those steps, the Court apparently believes, amounts to corruption sufficient to silence those who wish to support a can-didate. In my view, the First Amendment demands a more

coherent explication of the evidence of corruption.9Finally, even if the tally system were evidence of
corruption-through-circumvention, it is only evidence ofwhat is occurring under the current system, not of additional
"corruption" that would arise in the absence of the Party
Expenditure Provision. The Court speculates that, if we in-validated the Party Expenditure Provision, "the inducement

to circumvent would almost certainly intensify." Ante, at460. But that is nothing more than supposition, which is
insufficient under our precedents to sustain a restrictionon First Amendment interests. See

Shrink Missouri, 528
U. S., at 392 ("We have never accepted mere conjecture asadequate to carry a First Amendment burden"). See also

United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc., 529U. S. 803, 822 (2000) (concluding that the government "must
present more than anecdote and supposition"). And it isweak supposition at that. The Court does not contend that

9 Ironically, earlier this Term, this Court was less willing to uphold a
speech restriction based on inference of circumvention. See, e. g., Bartnicki v. Vopper, 532 U. S. 514, 529-535 (2001) (holding unconstitutional
the prohibition on disclosure of illegally intercepted conversation even
though the initial step in the disclosure process, the interception, was
illegal and harmful to those whose privacy was invaded).

Thomas, J., dissenting

the DSCC's alleged efforts to channel money through the
tally system were restricted in any way by the Party Expenditure Provision. On the contrary, the Court suggests
that a donation to the DSCC was increased by the party; in
other words, the candidate got more than the initial donation.
See ante, at 458 (quoting declaration of Timothy Wirth)
(" `I understood that when I raised funds for the DSCC,
the donors expected that I would receive the amount of
their donations multiplied by a certain number that the
DSCC had determined in advance, assuming the DSCC has
raised other funds' " (emphasis added)). Because I am unpersuaded by weak speculation ungrounded in any evidence,
I disagree with the Court's conclusion that the Party Expenditure Provision furthers the Government interest of reducing corruption.10

10 The other "evidence" on which the Court relies is less compelling than
the tally system. The Court presents four quotations, two of which
do not even support the proposition that donations are funneled through
parties to candidates. See ante, at 458 (quoting declaration of Leon G.
Billings, former Executive Director of the DSCC); ante, at 458. These
comments simply reflect the obvious fact that a candidate benefits
when his party receives money. Neither comment suggests that the candidate is aided through the surreptitious laundering of money, as opposed
to issue advertisements, get-out-the-vote campaigns, and independent
expenditures.

The other two quotations are somewhat suspect in that they are made
by Timothy Wirth, who was the object of the negative advertisements
giving rise to this lawsuit, and by his national finance director. See ibid.
(quoting App. 274 (declaration of Timothy Wirth)); App. 247 (declaration
of Robert Hickmott, former Democratic fundraiser and National Finance
Director for Timothy Wirth's Senate campaign). Moreover, neither
Wirth nor his finance director described how donations were actually
treated by the DSCC, either in general or in Wirth's particular case; instead Wirth and his finance director simply reflected on their understandings of how the money would be used in Wirth's election. As noted above,
the District Court found that "the primary consideration in allocating
funds is which races are marginal." 41 F. Supp. 2d, at 1203. And the
evidence in the record supports this finding. See supra, at 477.

Even if the Government had presented evidence that theParty Expenditure Provision affects corruption, the statute still would be unconstitutional, because there are bettertailored alternatives for addressing the corruption. In addition to bribery laws and disclosure laws, see Shrink Missouri, supra, at 428 (Thomas, J., dissenting), the Govern-ment has two options that would not entail the restriction of

political parties' First Amendment rights.First, the Government could enforce the earmarking rule
of 2 U. S. C. $ 441a(a)(8), under which contributions that "arein any way earmarked or otherwise directed through an
intermediary or conduit to [a] candidate" are treated as con-tributions to the candidate. Vigilant enforcement of this
provision is a precise response to the Court's circumventionconcerns. If a donor contributes $2,000 to a candidate (the
maximum donation in an election cycle), he cannot direct thepolitical party to funnel another dime to the candidate without confronting the Federal Election Campaign Act's civiland criminal penalties, see 2 U. S. C. $ 437g(a)(6)(C) (civil);

$ 437g(d) (criminal).According to the Court, reliance on this earmarking provision "ignores the practical difficulty of identifying and di-rectly combating circumvention" and "would reach only the
most clumsy attempts to pass contributions through to candi-dates." Ante, at 462. The Court, however, does not cite
any evidence to support this assertion. Nor does it articu-late what failed steps the Government already has taken.
Nor does it explain why the burden that the Governmentallegedly would have to bear in uncovering circumvention
justifies the infringement of political parties' First Amend-ment rights. In previous cases, we have not been so willing
to overlook such failures. See, e. g., Bartnicki, 532 U. S., at530-531 ("[T]here is no empirical evidence to support the
assumption that the prohibition against disclosures reducesthe number of illegal interceptions").

482 FEDERAL ELECTION COMM'N v. COLORADO

REPUBLICAN FEDERAL CAMPAIGN COMM.

Thomas, J., dissenting

In any event, there is a second, well-tailored option forcombating corruption that does not entail the reduction of

parties' First Amendment freedoms. The heart of theCourt's circumvention argument is that, whereas individuals
can donate only $2,000 to a candidate in a given electioncycle, they can donate $20,000 to the national committees of
a political party, an amount that is allegedly large enough to
corrupt the candidate. See ante, at 453. If indeed $20,000is enough to corrupt a candidate (an assumption that seems

implausible on its face and is, in any event, unsupported byany evidence), the proper response is to lower the cap. That
way, the speech restriction is directed at the source of the
alleged corruption--the individual donor--and not the party.
"The normal method of deterring unlawful conduct is to impose an appropriate punishment on the person who engages
in it." Bartnicki, 532 U. S., at 529. "[I]t would be quite
remarkable to hold that speech by a law-abiding [entity] can
be suppressed in order to deter conduct by a non-law-abiding
third party." Id., at 529-530. The Court takes that unorthodox path today, a decision that is all the more remarkable considering that the controlling opinion in Colorado I
expressly rejected it just five years ago. 518 U. S., at 617
("We could understand how Congress, were it to conclude
that the potential for evasion of the individual contribution
limits was a serious matter, might decide to change the
statute's limitations on contributions to political parties.
But we do not believe that the risk of corruption present
here could justify the `markedly greater burden on basic
freedoms caused by' the statute's limitations on expenditures" (citations omitted)).

In my view, it makes no sense to contravene a political
party's core First Amendment rights because of what a third
party might unlawfully try to do. Instead of broadly restricting political parties' speech, the Government should
have pursued better-tailored alternatives for combating the
alleged corruption.

NEW YORK TIMES CO., INC., et al. v. TASINI et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe second circuit

No. 00-201. Argued March 28, 2001--Decided June 25, 2001
Respondent freelance authors (Authors) wrote articles (Articles) for newspapers and a magazine published by petitioners New York Times Company (Times), Newsday, Inc. (Newsday), and Time, Inc. (Time). The
Times, Newsday, and Time (Print Publishers) engaged the Authors as
independent contractors under contracts that in no instance secured an
Author's consent to placement of an Article in an electronic database.
The Print Publishers each licensed rights to copy and sell articles to
petitioner LEXIS/NEXIS, owner and operator of NEXIS. NEXIS is
a computerized database containing articles in text-only format from
hundreds of periodicals spanning many years. Subscribers access
NEXIS through a computer, may search for articles using criteria such
as author and subject, and may view, print, or download each article
yielded by the search. An article's display identifies its original print
publication, date, section, initial page number, title, and author, but each
article appears in isolation--without visible link to other stories originally published in the same periodical edition. NEXIS does not reproduce the print publication's formatting features such as headline size
and page placement. The Times also has licensing agreements with
petitioner University Microfilms International (UMI), authorizing reproduction of Times materials on two CD-ROM products. One, the
New York Times OnDisc (NYTO), is a text-only database containing
Times articles presented in essentially the same way they appear in
LEXIS/NEXIS. The other, General Periodicals OnDisc (GPO), is an
image-based system that reproduces the Times' Sunday Book Review
and Magazine exactly as they appeared on the printed pages, complete
with photographs, captions, advertisements, and other surrounding materials. The two CD-ROM products are searchable in much the same
way as LEXIS/NEXIS; in both, articles retrieved by users provide no
links to other articles appearing in the original print publications.

The Authors filed this suit, alleging that their copyrights were infringed when, as permitted and facilitated by the Print Publishers,
LEXIS/NEXIS and UMI (Electronic Publishers) placed the Articles in
NEXIS, NYTO, and GPO (Databases). The Authors sought declaratory and injunctive relief, and damages. In response to the Authors'
complaint, the Print and Electronic Publishers raised the privilege ac533US2 Unit: $U83 [11-01-02 19:20:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Syllabus
corded collective work copyright owners by $ 201(c) of the Copyright
Act. That provision, pivotal in this case, reads: "Copyright in each separate contribution to a collective work is distinct from copyright in the
collective work as a whole, and vests initially in the author of the contribution. In the absence of an express transfer of the copyright or of any
rights under it, the owner of copyright in the collective work is presumed to have acquired only the privilege of reproducing and distributing the contribution as part of that particular collective work, any revision of that collective work, and any later collective work in the same
series." The District Court granted the Publishers summary judgment, holding, inter alia, that the Databases reproduced and distributed
the Authors' works, in $ 201(c)'s words, "as part of . . . [a] revision of
that collective work" to which the Authors had first contributed. The
Second Circuit reversed, granting the Authors summary judgment on
the ground that the Databases were not among the collective works
covered by $ 201(c), and specifically, were not "revisions" of the periodicals in which the Articles first appeared.

Held: Section 201(c) does not authorize the copying at issue here. The

Publishers are not sheltered by $ 201(c) because the Databases reproduce and distribute articles standing alone and not in context, not "as
part of that particular collective work" to which the author contributed,
"as part of . . . any revision" thereof, or "as part of . . . any later collective work in the same series." Pp. 493-506.

(a) Where, as here, a freelance author has contributed an article to a
collective work, copyright in the contribution vests initially in its author.

$ 201(c). Copyright in the collective work vests in the collective author
(here, the Print Publisher) and extends only to the creative material
contributed by that author, not to "the preexisting material employed
in the work," $ 103(b). Congress enacted the provisions of the 1976
revision of the Copyright Act at issue to address the unfair situation
under prior law, whereby authors risked losing their rights when they
placed an article in a collective work. The 1976 Act recast the copyright as a bundle of discrete "exclusive rights," $ 106, each of which
"may be transferred . . . and owned separately," $ 201(d)(2). The Act
also provided, in $ 404(a), that "a single notice applicable to the collective
work as a whole is sufficient" to protect the rights of freelance contributors. Together, $ 404(a) and $ 201(c) preserve the author's copyright in
a contribution to a collective work. Under $ 201(c)'s terms, a publisher
could reprint a contribution from one issue in a later issue of its magazine, and could reprint an article from one edition of an encyclopedia in
a later revision of it, but could not revise the contribution itself or include it in a new anthology or an entirely different collective work. Es533US2 Unit: $U83 [11-01-02 19:20:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN

sentially, $ 201(c) adjusts a publisher's copyright in its collective work to
accommodate a freelancer's copyright in her contribution. If there is
demand for a freelance article standing alone or in a new collection, the
Copyright Act allows the freelancer to benefit from that demand; after
authorizing initial publication, the freelancer may also sell the article to
others. Cf. Stewart v. Abend, 495 U. S. 207, 229, 230. It would scarcely
preserve the author's copyright in a contribution as contemplated by
Congress if a print publisher, without the author's permission, could
reproduce or distribute discrete copies of the contribution in isolation
or within new collective works. Pp. 493-497.

(b) The Publishers' view that inclusion of the Articles in the Databases lies within the "privilege of reproducing and distributing the [Articles] as part of . . . [a] revision of that collective work," $ 201(c), is
unacceptable. In determining whether the Articles have been reproduced and distributed "as part of" a "revision," the Court focuses on
the Articles as presented to, and perceptible by, a Database user. See

$$ 102, 101. Here, the three Databases present articles to users clear
of the context provided either by the original periodical editions or by
any revision of those editions. The Databases first prompt users to
search the universe of their contents: thousands or millions of files containing individual articles from thousands of collective works (i. e., editions), either in one series (the Times, in NYTO) or in scores of series
(the sundry titles in NEXIS and GPO). When the user conducts a
search, each article appears as a separate item within the search result.
In NEXIS and NYTO, an article appears to a user without the graphics,
formatting, or other articles with which it was initially published. In
GPO, the article appears with the other materials published on the same
page or pages, but without any material published on other pages of
the original periodical. In either circumstance, the Database does not
reproduce and distribute the article "as part of" either the original edition or a "revision" of that edition. The articles may be viewed as parts
of a new compendium--namely, the entirety of works in the Database.
Each edition of each periodical, however, represents only a miniscule
fraction of the ever-expanding Database. The massive whole of the
Database is not recognizable as a new version of its every small part.
Furthermore, the Articles in the Databases may be viewed "as part
of" no larger work at all, but simply as individual articles presented
individually. That each article bears marks of its origin in a particular
periodical suggests the article was previously part of that periodical,
not that the article is currently reproduced or distributed as part of the
periodical. The Databases' reproduction and distribution of individual
Articles--simply as individual Articles--would invade the core of the
Authors' exclusive rights. The Publishers' analogy between the Data533US2 Unit: $U83 [11-01-02 19:20:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN
486 NEW YORK TIMES CO. v. TASINI

Syllabus
bases and microfilm and microfiche is wanting: In the Databases, unlike
microfilm, articles appear disconnected from their original context.
Unlike the conversion of newsprint to microfilm, the transfer of articles
to the Databases does not represent a mere conversion of intact periodicals (or revisions of periodicals) from one medium to another. The
Databases offer users individual articles, not intact periodicals. The
concept of "media-neutrality" invoked by the Publishers should therefore protect the Authors' rights, not the Publishers'. The result is not
changed because users can manipulate the Databases to generate search
results consisting entirely of articles from a particular periodical edition.
Under $ 201(c), the question is not whether a user can assemble a revision of a collective work from a database, but whether the database
itself perceptibly presents the author's contribution as part of a revision
of the collective work. That result is not accomplished by these Databases. Pp. 498-504.

(c) The Publishers' warning that a ruling for the Authors will have
"devastating" consequences, punching gaping holes in the electronic record of history, is unavailing. It hardly follows from this decision that
an injunction against the inclusion of these Articles in the Databases
(much less all freelance articles in any databases) must issue. The Authors and Publishers may enter into an agreement allowing continued
electronic reproduction of the Authors' works; they, and if necessary the
courts and Congress, may draw on numerous models for distributing
copyrighted works and remunerating authors for their distribution. In
any event, speculation about future harms is no basis for this Court to
shrink authorial rights created by Congress. The Court leaves remedial issues open for initial airing and decision in the District Court.

This copyright case concerns the rights of freelance authors and a presumptive privilege of their publishers. The
litigation was initiated by six freelance authors and relates
to articles they contributed to three print periodicals (two
newspapers and one magazine). Under agreements with
the periodicals' publishers, but without the freelancers' consent, two computer database companies placed copies of the
freelancers' articles--along with all other articles from the
periodicals in which the freelancers' work appeared--into
three databases. Whether written by a freelancer or staff
member, each article is presented to, and retrievable by, the
user in isolation, clear of the context the original print publication presented.

The freelance authors' complaint alleged that their copyrights had been infringed by the inclusion of their articles in

Opinion of the Court
petitioner The New York Times Company (Times). Tasini,
Garson, Robbins, and Whitford wrote eight Articles for
Newsday, another New York daily paper, published by petitioner Newsday, Inc. (Newsday). Whitford also contributed
one Article to Sports Illustrated, a weekly magazine published by petitioner Time, Inc. (Time). The Authors registered copyrights in each of the Articles. The Times, Newsday, and Time (Print Publishers) registered collective work
copyrights in each periodical edition in which an Article originally appeared. The Print Publishers engaged the Authors
as independent contractors (freelancers) under contracts that
in no instance secured consent from an Author to placement
of an Article in an electronic database.1

At the time the Articles were published, all three Print
Publishers had agreements with petitioner LEXIS/NEXIS
(formerly Mead Data Central Corp.), owner and operator of
NEXIS, a computerized database that stores information
in a text-only format. NEXIS contains articles from hundreds of journals (newspapers and periodicals) spanning
many years. The Print Publishers have licensed to LEXIS/
NEXIS the text of articles appearing in the three periodicals. The licenses authorize LEXIS/NEXIS to copy and sell
any portion of those texts.

Pursuant to the licensing agreements, the Print Publishers
regularly provide LEXIS/NEXIS with a batch of all the articles published in each periodical edition. The Print Publisher codes each article to facilitate computerized retrieval,
then transmits it in a separate file. After further coding,
LEXIS/NEXIS places the article in the central discs of its
database.

1 In the District Court, Newsday and Time contended that the freelancers who wrote for their publications had entered into agreements authorizing reproduction of the Articles in the databases. The Court of Appeals
ruled that Newsday's defense was waived, and rejected Time's argument
on the merits. Neither petitioner presses the contention here.

490 NEW YORK TIMES CO. v. TASINI

Opinion of the Court
Subscribers to NEXIS, accessing the system through a
computer, may search for articles by author, subject, date,
publication, headline, key term, words in text, or other criteria. Responding to a search command, NEXIS scans the
database and informs the user of the number of articles
meeting the user's search criteria. The user then may view,
print, or download each of the articles yielded by the search.
The display of each article includes the print publication
(e. g., The New York Times), date (September 23, 1990), section (Magazine), initial page number (26), headline or title
("Remembering Jane"), and author (Mary Kay Blakely).
Each article appears as a separate, isolated "story"--without
any visible link to the other stories originally published in
the same newspaper or magazine edition. NEXIS does not
contain pictures or advertisements, and it does not reproduce
the original print publication's formatting features such as
headline size, page placement (e. g., above or below the fold
for newspapers), or location of continuation pages.

The Times (but not Newsday or Time) also has licensing
agreements with petitioner University Microfilms International (UMI). The agreements authorize reproduction of
Times materials on two CD-ROM products, the New York
Times OnDisc (NYTO) and General Periodicals OnDisc
(GPO).

Like NEXIS, NYTO is a text-only system. Unlike
NEXIS, NYTO, as its name suggests, contains only the
Times. Pursuant to a three-way agreement, LEXIS/

NEXIS provides UMI with computer files containing each
article as transmitted by the Times to LEXIS/NEXIS.
Like LEXIS/NEXIS, UMI marks each article with special
codes. UMI also provides an index of all the articles in
NYTO. Articles appear in NYTO in essentially the same
way they appear in NEXIS, i. e., with identifying information (author, title, etc.), but without original formatting or
accompanying images.

Opinion of the Court
GPO contains articles from approximately 200 publicationsor sections of publications. Unlike NEXIS and NYTO, GPO

is an image-based, rather than a text-based, system. TheTimes has licensed GPO to provide a facsimile of the Times'
Sunday Book Review and Magazine. UMI "burns" imagesof each page of these sections onto CD-ROMs. The CD-
ROMs show each article exactly as it appeared on printedpages, complete with photographs, captions, advertisements,
and other surrounding materials. UMI provides an indexand abstracts of all the articles in GPO.

Articles are accessed through NYTO and GPO much asthey are accessed through NEXIS. The user enters a
search query using similar criteria (e. g., author, headline,date). The computer program searches available indexes
and abstracts, and retrieves a list of results matching thequery. The user then may view each article within the
search result, and may print the article or download it to adisc. The display of each article provides no links to articles
appearing on other pages of the original print publications.2

On December 16, 1993, the Authors filed this civil actionin the United States District Court for the Southern District

of New York. The Authors alleged that their copyrightswere infringed when, as permitted and facilitated by the
Print Publishers, LEXIS/NEXIS and UMI (Electronic Pub-lishers) placed the Articles in the NEXIS, NYTO, and GPO
databases (Databases). The Authors sought declaratory

2 For example, the GPO user who retrieves Blakely's "Remembering
Jane" article will see the entirety of Magazine page 26, where the article
begins, and Magazine page 78, where the article continues and ends. The
NYTO user who retrieves Blakely's article will see only the text of the
article and its identifying information (author, headline, publication, page
number, etc.). Neither the GPO retrieval nor the NYTO retrieval produces any text on page 27, page 79, or any other page. The user who
wishes to see other pages may not simply "flip" to them. She must conduct a new search.

Opinion of the Court
and injunctive relief, and damages. In response to the Au-thors' complaint, the Print and Electronic Publishers raised

the reproduction and distribution privilege accorded collec-tive work copyright owners by 17 U. S. C. $ 201(c). After
discovery, both sides moved for summary judgment.The District Court granted summary judgment for the
Publishers, holding that $ 201(c) shielded the Database reproductions. 972 F. Supp. 804, 806 (1997). The privilege con-ferred by $ 201(c) is transferable, the court first concluded,

and therefore could be conveyed from the original Print Pub-lishers to the Electronic Publishers.

Id., at 816. Next, the
court determined, the Databases reproduced and distributedthe Authors' works, in $ 201(c)'s words, "as part of . . . [a]

revision of that collective work" to which the Authors hadfirst contributed. To qualify as "revisions," according to the
court, works need only "preserve some significant originalaspect of [collective works]--whether an original selection or
an original arrangement." Id., at 821. This criterion wasmet, in the District Court's view, because the Databases preserved the Print Publishers' "selection of articles" by copying all of the articles originally assembled in the periodicals'daily or weekly issues.

Id., at 823. The Databases "highlight[ed]" the connection between the articles and the print
periodicals, the court observed, by showing for each article
not only the author and periodical, but also the print publication's particular issue and page numbers. Id., at 824 ("[T]he
electronic technologies not only copy the publisher defendants' complete original `selection' of articles, they tag those
articles in such a way that the publisher defendants' original
selection remains evident online.").

The Authors appealed, and the Second Circuit reversed.
206 F. 3d 161 (1999). The Court of Appeals granted summary judgment for the Authors on the ground that the Databases were not among the collective works covered by

$ 201(c), and specifically, were not "revisions" of the periodicals in which the Articles first appeared. Id., at 167-170.
Just as $ 201(c) does not "permit a Publisher to sell a hard

Opinion of the Court
copy of an Author's article directly to the public even if thePublisher also offered for individual sale all of the other articles from the particular edition," the court reasoned, so$ 201(c) does not allow a Publisher to "achieve the same goal
indirectly" through computer databases. Id., at 168. Inthe Second Circuit's view, the Databases effectively achieved
this result by providing multitudes of "individually retriev-able" articles.

Ibid. As stated by the Court of Appeals,the Databases might fairly be described as containing "new

antholog[ies] of innumerable" editions or publications, butthey do not qualify as "revisions" of particular editions of
periodicals in the Databases. Id., at 169. Having con-cluded that $ 201(c) "does not permit the Publishers," acting
without the author's consent, "to license individually copy-righted works for inclusion in the electronic databases," the
court did not reach the question whether the $ 201(c) privi-lege is transferable. Id., at 165, and n. 2.

We granted certiorari to determine whether the copyingof the Authors' Articles in the Databases is privileged by
17 U. S. C. $ 201(c). 531 U. S. 978 (2000). Like the Courtof Appeals, we conclude that the $ 201(c) privilege does not
override the Authors' copyrights, for the Databases do notreproduce and distribute the Articles as part of a collective
work privileged by $ 201(c). Accordingly, and again like theCourt of Appeals, we find it unnecessary to determine
whether the privilege is transferable.

II
Under the Copyright Act, as amended in 1976, "[c]opyrightprotection subsists . . . in original works of authorship fixed

in any tangible medium of expression . . . from which theycan be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated."
17 U. S. C. $ 102(a). When, as in this case, a freelance authorhas contributed an article to a "collective work" such as
a newspaper or magazine, see $ 101 (defining "collectivework"), the statute recognizes two distinct copyrighted
works: "Copyright in each separate contribution to a collec533US2 Unit: $U83 [11-01-02 19:20:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN
494 NEW YORK TIMES CO. v. TASINI

Opinion of the Court
tive work is distinct from copyright in the collective work as
a whole . . . ." $ 201(c) (emphasis added). Copyright in the
separate contribution "vests initially in the author of the con-tribution" (here, the freelancer).

Ibid. Copyright in the
collective work vests in the collective author (here, the news-paper or magazine publisher) and extends only to the creative material contributed by that author, not to "the preexisting material employed in the work," $ 103(b). Seealso

Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co.,
499 U. S. 340, 358 (1991) (copyright in "compilation"--a termthat includes "collective works," 17 U. S. C. $ 101--is limited to the compiler's original "selection, coordination, andarrangement").

Prior to the 1976 revision, as the courts below recognized,see 206 F. 3d, at 168; 972 F. Supp., at 815, authors risked
losing their rights when they placed an article in a collectivework. Pre-1976 copyright law recognized a freelance author's copyright in a published article only when the articlewas printed with a copyright notice in the author's name.
See Copyright Act of 1909, $ 18, 35 Stat. 1079. When publishers, exercising their superior bargaining power over au-thors, declined to print notices in each contributor's name,

the author's copyright was put in jeopardy. See Kaminstein, Divisibility of Copyrights, Study No. 11, in Copyright
Law Revision Studies Nos. 11-13, prepared for the Senate
Committee on the Judiciary, 86th Cong., 2d Sess., 18 (1960).
The author did not have the option to assign only the right
of publication in the periodical; such a partial assignment
was blocked by the doctrine of copyright "indivisibility."
See id., at 11. Thus, when a copyright notice appeared only
in the publisher's name, the author's work would fall into the
public domain, unless the author's copyright, in its entirety,
had passed to the publisher. See id., at 18. Such complete
transfer might be accomplished by a contract, perhaps one
with a provision, not easily enforced, for later retransfer of
rights back to the author. See id., at 20-22. Or, absent a
specific contract, a court might find that an author had tacitly

Rev. 477, 490 (1977)). The intent to enhance the author's position vis-a`-vis
the patron is also evident in the 1976 Act's work-for-hire provisions. See
Community for Creative Non-Violence v. Reid, 490 U. S. 730, 742-750
(1989); see also 17 U. S. C. $ 203(a)(5) (inalienable authorial right to revoke
a copyright transfer). Congress' adjustment of the author/publisher balance is a permissible expression of the "economic philosophy behind the
[Copyright Clause]," i. e., "the conviction that encouragement of individual
effort [motivated] by personal gain is the best way to advance public welfare." Harper & Row, Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enterprises, 471 U. S.
539, 558 (1985) (quoting Mazer v. Stein, 347 U. S. 201, 219 (1954)).

4 As amended, $ 106 now provides: "Subject to sections 107 through 121,

the owner of copyright under this title has the exclusive rights to do and
to authorize any of the following:

"(1) to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords;
"(2) to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work;
"(3) to distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the
public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or
lending;

"(4) in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works,
pantomimes, and motion pictures and other audiovisual works, to perform
the copyrighted work publicly;

Opinion of the Court
ferred . . . and owned separately," $ 201(d)(2).5 Congressalso provided, in $ 404(a), that "a single notice applicable to

the collective work as a whole is sufficient" to protect therights of freelance contributors. And in $ 201(c), Congress
codified the discrete domains of "[c]opyright in each sepa-rate contribution to a collective work" and "copyright in the
collective work as a whole." Together, $ 404(a) and $ 201(c)"preserve the author's copyright in a contribution even if
the contribution does not bear a separate notice in the au-thor's name, and without requiring any unqualified transfer
of rights to the owner of the collective work." H. R. Rep.122.

Section 201(c) both describes and circumscribes the "privi-lege" a publisher acquires regarding an author's contribution
to a collective work:

"In the absence of an express transfer of the copyrightor of any rights under it, the owner of copyright in the

collective work is presumed to have acquired only theprivilege of reproducing and distributing the contribution as part of that particular collective work, any revi-sion of that collective work, and any later collective
work in the same series." (Emphasis added.)
A newspaper or magazine publisher is thus privileged to re-produce or distribute an article contributed by a freelance

author, absent a contract otherwise providing, only "as partof " any (or all) of three categories of collective works: (a)
"that collective work" to which the author contributed herwork, (b) "any revision of that collective work," or (c) "any
later collective work in the same series." In accord withCongress' prescription, a "publishing company could reprint

vidual images of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, to display the
copyrighted work publicly; and

"(6) in the case of sound recordings, to perform the copyrighted work
publicly by means of a digital audio transmission."

5 It bears repetition here, see supra, at 493, that we neither decide nor

express any view on whether the $ 201(c) "privilege" may be transferred.

a contribution from one issue in a later issue of its magazine,and could reprint an article from a 1980 edition of an encyclopedia in a 1990 revision of it; the publisher could not revisethe contribution itself or include it in a new anthology or an
entirely different magazine or other collective work." H. R.Rep. 122-123.

Essentially, $ 201(c) adjusts a publisher's copyright in itscollective work to accommodate a freelancer's copyright in
her contribution. If there is demand for a freelance articlestanding alone or in a new collection, the Copyright Act
allows the freelancer to benefit from that demand; after au-thorizing initial publication, the freelancer may also sell the
article to others. Cf. Stewart v. Abend, 495 U. S. 207, 229(1990) ("[w]hen an author produces a work which later commands a higher price in the market than the original bargainprovided, the copyright statute [

i. e., the separate renewalterm of former 17 U. S. C. $ 24] is designed to provide the

author the power to negotiate for the realized value of thework");

id., at 230 (noting author's "inalienable terminationright" under current 17 U. S. C. $$ 203, 302 (1994 ed. and

Supp. V)). It would scarcely "preserve the author's copy-right in a contribution" as contemplated by Congress, H. R.
Rep. 122, if a newspaper or magazine publisher were per-mitted to reproduce or distribute copies of the author's contribution in isolation or within new collective works. SeeGordon, Fine-Tuning Tasini: Privileges of Electronic Distribution and Reproduction, 66 Brooklyn L. Rev. 473, 484(2000).

6 The dissenting opinion suggests that a ruling for the Publishers today
would maintain, even enhance, authors' "valuable copyright protection."
Post, at 521 (opinion of Stevens, J.). We are not so certain. When the
reader of an article in a periodical wishes to obtain other works by the
article's author, the Databases enable that reader simply to print out
the author's articles, without buying a "new anthology . . . or other collective work," H. R. Rep. 122-123. In years past, books compiling stories
by journalists such as Janet Flanner and Ernie Pyle might have sold less
well had the individual articles been freely and permanently available on

Opinion of the Court

III
In the instant case, the Authors wrote several Articles andgave the Print Publishers permission to publish the Articles

in certain newspapers and magazines. It is undisputed thatthe Authors hold copyrights and, therefore, exclusive rights
in the Articles.7 It is clear, moreover, that the Print andElectronic Publishers have exercised at least some rights
that $ 106 initially assigns exclusively to the Authors:LEXIS/NEXIS' central discs and UMI's CD-ROMs "reproduce . . . copies" of the Articles, $ 106(1); UMI, by sellingthose CD-ROMs, and LEXIS/NEXIS, by selling copies of
the Articles through the NEXIS Database, "distribute cop-ies" of the Articles "to the public by sale," $ 106(3); and the
Print Publishers, through contracts licensing the produc-tion of copies in the Databases, "authorize" reproduction and
distribution of the Articles, $ 106.8
line. In the present, print collections of reviews, commentaries, and reportage may prove less popular because of the Databases. The Register
of Copyrights reports that "freelance authors have experienced significant
economic loss" due to a "digital revolution that has given publishers [new]
opportunities to exploit authors' works." Peters Letter E182.

More to the point, even if the dissent is correct that some authors, in
the long run, are helped, not hurt, by Database reproductions, the fact
remains that the Authors who brought the case now before us have asserted their rights under $ 201(c). We may not invoke our conception of
their interests to diminish those rights.

7 The Publishers do not claim that the Articles are "work[s] made for

hire." 17 U. S. C. $ 201(b). As to such works, the employer or person for
whom a work was prepared is treated as the author. Ibid. The Print
Publishers, however, neither engaged the Authors to write the Articles as
"employee[s]" nor "commissioned" the Articles through "a written instrument signed by [both parties]" indicating that the Articles shall be considered "work[s] made for hire." $ 101 (1994 ed., Supp. V) (defining "work
made for hire").

8 Satisfied that the Publishers exercised rights $ 106 initially assigns exclusively to the Author, we need resolve no more on that score. Thus, we
do not reach an issue the Register of Copyrights has argued vigorously.
The Register maintains that the Databases publicly "display" the Articles,

533US2 Unit: $U83 [11-01-02 19:20:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN

499Cite as: 533 U. S. 483 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
Against the Authors' charge of infringement, the Publish-ers do not here contend the Authors entered into an agreement authorizing reproduction of the Articles in the Data-bases. See supra, at 489, n. 1. Nor do they assert that the
copies in the Databases represent "fair use" of the Authors'Articles. See 17 U. S. C. $ 107 ("fair use of a copyrighted
work . . . is not an infringement"; four factors identifiedamong those relevant to fair use determination). Instead,
the Publishers rest entirely on the privilege described in$ 201(c). Each discrete edition of the periodicals in which
the Articles appeared is a "collective work," the Publishersagree. They contend, however, that reproduction and distribution of each Article by the Databases lie within the"privilege of reproducing and distributing the [Articles] as
part of . . . [a] revision of that collective work," $ 201(c). ThePublishers' encompassing construction of the $ 201(c) privilege is unacceptable, we conclude, for it would diminish theAuthors' exclusive rights in the Articles.

In determining whether the Articles have been repro-duced and distributed "as part of " a "revision" of the collective works in issue, we focus on the Articles as presentedto, and perceptible by, the user of the Databases. See $ 102
(copyright protection subsists in original works fixed in anymedium "from which they can be perceived, reproduced, or
otherwise communicated"); see also $ 101 (1994 ed., Supp. V)(definitions of "copies" and "fixed"); Haemmerli, Commentary: Tasini v. New York Times Co., 22 Colum.-VLA. J. L. &Arts 129, 142-143 (1998). In this case, the three Databases
present articles to users clear of the context provided eitherby the original periodical editions or by any revision of those
editions. The Databases first prompt users to search theuniverse of their contents: thousands or millions of files con$ 106(5); because $ 201(c) does not privilege "display," the Register urges,
the $ 201(c) privilege does not shield the Databases. See Peters Letter
E182-E183.

Opinion of the Court
taining individual articles from thousands of collective works(

i. e., editions), either in one series (the Times, in NYTO) or
in scores of series (the sundry titles in NEXIS and GPO).When the user conducts a search, each article appears as a

separate item within the search result. In NEXIS andNYTO, an article appears to a user without the graphics,
formatting, or other articles with which the article was initially published. In GPO, the article appears with the othermaterials published on the same page or pages, but without

any material published on other pages of the original periodi-cal. In either circumstance, we cannot see how the Database perceptibly reproduces and distributes the article "as
part of " either the original edition or a "revision" of that
edition.

One might view the articles as parts of a new compendium--namely, the entirety of works in the Database. In
that compendium, each edition of each periodical represents
only a miniscule fraction of the ever-expanding Database.
The Database no more constitutes a "revision" of each constituent edition than a 400-page novel quoting a sonnet in
passing would represent a "revision" of that poem. "Revision" denotes a new "version," and a version is, in this setting, a "distinct form of something regarded by its creator
or others as one work." Webster's Third New International
Dictionary 1944, 2545 (1976). The massive whole of the
Database is not recognizable as a new version of its every
small part.

Alternatively, one could view the Articles in the Databases
"as part of " no larger work at all, but simply as individual
articles presented individually. That each article bears
marks of its origin in a particular periodical (less vivid marks
in NEXIS and NYTO, more vivid marks in GPO) suggests
the article was previously part of that periodical. But the
markings do not mean the article is currently reproduced or
distributed as part of the periodical. The Databases' reproduction and distribution of individual Articles--simply as

Opinion of the Court
individual Articles--would invade the core of the Authors'
exclusive rights under $ 106.9

The Publishers press an analogy between the Databases,
on the one hand, and microfilm and microfiche, on the other.
We find the analogy wanting. Microforms typically contain
continuous photographic reproductions of a periodical in the
medium of miniaturized film. Accordingly, articles appear
on the microforms, writ very small, in precisely the position
in which the articles appeared in the newspaper. The
Times, for example, printed the beginning of Blakely's "Remembering Jane" Article on page 26 of the Magazine in the
September 23, 1990, edition; the microfilm version of the
Times reproduces that same Article on film in the very same
position, within a film reproduction of the entire Magazine,
in turn within a reproduction of the entire September 23,
1990, edition. True, the microfilm roll contains multiple editions, and the microfilm user can adjust the machine lens to
focus only on the Article, to the exclusion of surrounding
material. Nonetheless, the user first encounters the Article
in context. In the Databases, by contrast, the Articles appear disconnected from their original context. In NEXIS
and NYTO, the user sees the "Jane" Article apart even from
the remainder of page 26. In GPO, the user sees the Article
within the context of page 26, but clear of the context of page
25 or page 27, the rest of the Magazine, or the remainder of
the day's newspaper. In short, unlike microforms, the Databases do not perceptibly reproduce articles as part of the

9 The dissenting opinion takes as its starting point "what is sent from
the New York Times to the Electronic Databases." See post, at 512-516.
This case, however, is not ultimately about what is sent between Publishers in an intermediate step of Database production; it is about what is
presented to the general public in the Databases. See supra, at 499-500.
Those Databases simply cannot bear characterization as a "revision" of

collective work to which the author contributed or as part of
any "revision" thereof.10

Invoking the concept of "media neutrality," the Publishers
urge that the "transfer of a work between media" does not
"alte[r] the character of " that work for copyright purposes.
Brief for Petitioners 23. That is indeed true. See 17
U. S. C. $ 102(a) (copyright protection subsists in original
works "fixed in any tangible medium of expression"). But
unlike the conversion of newsprint to microfilm, the transfer
of articles to the Databases does not represent a mere conversion of intact periodicals (or revisions of periodicals) from
one medium to another. The Databases offer users individual articles, not intact periodicals. In this case, media neutrality should protect the Authors' rights in the individual
Articles to the extent those Articles are now presented
individually, outside the collective work context, within the
Databases' new media.11

For the purpose at hand--determining whether the Authors' copyrights have been infringed--an analogy to an

10 The Court of Appeals concluded NEXIS was infringing partly because
that Database did "almost nothing to preserve the copyrightable aspects
of the [Print] Publishers' collective works," i. e., their original "selection,
coordination, and arrangement." 206 F. 3d 161, 168 (CA2 1999). We do
not pass on this issue. It suffices to hold that the Databases do not contain "revisions" of the Print Publishers' works "as part of" which the Articles are reproduced and distributed.

11 The dissenting opinion apparently concludes that, under the banner of

"media neutrality," a copy of a collective work, even when considerably
changed, must constitute a "revision" of that collective work so long as the
changes were "necessitated by the . . . medium." Post, at 514. We lack
the dissent's confidence that the current form of the Databases is entirely
attributable to the nature of the electronic media, rather than the nature
of the economic market served by the Databases. In any case, we see no
grounding in $ 201(c) for a "medium-driven" necessity defense, post, at 514,
n. 11, to the Authors' infringement claims. Furthermore, it bears reminder here and throughout that these Publishers and all others can protect their interests by private contractual arrangement.

Opinion of the Court
imaginary library may be instructive.12 Rather than main-taining intact editions of periodicals, the library would contain separate copies of each article. Perhaps these copieswould exactly reproduce the periodical pages from which the
articles derive (if the model is GPO); perhaps the copieswould contain only typescript characters, but still indicate
the original periodical's name and date, as well as the arti-cle's headline and page number (if the model is NEXIS or
NYTO). The library would store the folders containing thearticles in a file room, indexed based on diverse criteria, and
containing articles from vast numbers of editions. In re-sponse to patron requests, an inhumanly speedy librarian
would search the room and provide copies of the articlesmatching patron-specified criteria.

Viewing this strange library, one could not, consistent with
ordinary English usage, characterize the articles "as part of "a "revision" of the editions in which the articles first appeared. In substance, however, the Databases differ fromthe file room only to the extent they aggregate articles in
electronic packages (the LEXIS/NEXIS central discs or
UMI CD-ROMs), while the file room stores articles in spa-tially separate files. The crucial fact is that the Databases,

like the hypothetical library, store and retrieve articles sepa-rately within a vast domain of diverse texts. Such a storage
and retrieval system effectively overrides the Authors' ex12 The Publishers have frequently referred to their products as "electronic libraries." We need not decide whether the Databases come within
the legal coverage of the term "libraries" as used in the Copyright Act.
For even if the Databases are "libraries," the Copyright Act's special authorizations for libraries do not cover the Databases' reproductions. See,
e. g., 17 U. S. C. $ 108(a)(1) (reproduction authorized "without any purpose
of direct or indirect commercial advantage"); $ 108(b) (1994 ed., Supp. V)
(reproduction authorized "solely for purposes of preservation and security
or for deposit for research use"); $ 108(c) (1994 ed., Supp. V) (reproduction
"solely for the purpose of replacement of a copy or phonorecord that is
damaged, deteriorating, lost, or stolen, or if the existing format in which
the work is stored has become obsolete").

clusive right to control the individual reproduction and dis-tribution of each Article, 17 U. S. C. $$ 106(1), (3). Cf. Ryan

v. Carl Corp., 23 F. Supp. 2d 1146 (ND Cal. 1998) (holdingcopy shop in violation of $ 201(c)).

The Publishers claim the protection of $ 201(c) becauseusers can manipulate the Databases to generate search results consisting entirely of articles from a particular periodi-cal edition. By this logic, $ 201(c) would cover the hypothetical library if, in response to a request, that library's expertstaff assembled all of the articles from a particular periodical
edition. However, the fact that a third party can manipulatea database to produce a noninfringing document does not
mean the database is not infringing. Under $ 201(c), thequestion is not whether a user can generate a revision of a
collective work from a database, but whether the databaseitself perceptibly presents the author's contribution as part
of a revision of the collective work. That result is not ac-complished by these Databases.

The Publishers finally invoke Sony Corp. of America v.Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U. S. 417 (1984). That decision, however, does not genuinely aid their argument.Sony held that the "sale of copying equipment" does not constitute contributory infringement if the equipment is "capa-ble of substantial noninfringing uses." Id., at 442. The
Publishers suggest that their Databases could be liable onlyunder a theory of contributory infringement, based on enduser conduct, which the Authors did not plead. The Elec-tronic Publishers, however, are not merely selling "equipment"; they are selling copies of the Articles. And, as wehave explained, it is the copies themselves, without any
manipulation by users, that fall outside the scope of the$ 201(c) privilege.

see also post, at 520 (Stevens, J., dissenting), it hardly fol-lows from today's decision that an injunction against the inclusion of these Articles in the Databases (much less all free-lance articles in any databases) must issue. See 17 U. S. C.

of copyright law are "not always best served by automati-cally granting injunctive relief "). The parties (Authors and
Publishers) may enter into an agreement allowing continuedelectronic reproduction of the Authors' works; they, and if
necessary the courts and Congress, may draw on numerousmodels for distributing copyrighted works and remunerating
authors for their distribution. See, e. g., 17 U. S. C. $ 118(b);

This case raises an issue of first impression concerningthe meaning of the word "revision" as used in $ 201(c) of the
1976 revision of the Copyright Act of 1909 (1976 Act). Ironi-cally, the Court today seems unwilling to acknowledge that
changes in a collective work far less extensive than thosemade to prior copyright law by the 1976 "revision" do not
merit the same characterization.To explain my disagreement with the Court's holding,

works. I will then discuss two analytically separate quesnewspaper-defendant entered into an agreement compensating authors for

tions that are blended together in the Court's discussion ofrevisions. The first is whether the electronic versions of the

collective works created by the owners of the copyright inthose works (Print Publishers or publishers) are "revision[s]"
of those works within the meaning of 17 U. S. C. $ 201(c). Inmy judgment they definitely are. The second is whether the
aggregation by LEXIS/NEXIS and UMI (Electronic Data-bases) of the revisions with other editions of the same periodical or with other periodicals within a single databasechanges the equation. I think it does not. Finally, I will
consider the implications of broader copyright policy for theissues presented in this case.

As the majority correctly observes, prior to 1976, an au-thor's decision to publish her individual article as part of a

collective work was a perilous one. Although pre-1976 copy-right law recognized the author's copyright in an individual
article that was included within a collective work, thoserights could be lost if the publisher refused to print the
article with a copyright notice in the author's name. 3 M.Nimmer & D. Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright $ 10.01[C][2],
p. 10-12 (2000).This harsh rule was, from the author's point of view, exacerbated by the pre-1976 doctrine of copyright "indivisibility,"which prevented an author from assigning only limited publication rights to the publisher of a collective work while hold-ing back all other rights to herself.

1 Ibid. The indivisibility of copyright, in combination with the danger of losingcopyright protection, put significant pressure on an author

1 Contractual attempts to assign such limited rights were deemed by
courts to create mere licenses, such that the failure to accompany the
article with an individual copyright in the author's name allowed the article to pass into the public domain. See 3 M. Nimmer & D. Nimmer, Copyright $ 10.01[A], p. 10-5; $ 10.01[C][2], p. 10-12 (2000).

transfer the entire copyright over to the publisher in trust.See Kaminstein, Divisibility of Copyrights, Study No. 11, in

Copyright Law Revision Studies Nos. 11-13, prepared forthe Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 86th Cong., 2d Sess.,
18-22 (1960) (hereinafter Kaminstein).2 Such authors wereoften at the mercy of publishers when they tried to reclaim
their copyright. Id., at 21.3

The 1976 Act's extensive revisions of the copyright lawhad two principal goals with respect to the rights of freelance authors whose writings appeared as part of larger col-lective works. First, as the legislative history of $ 201(c)
unambiguously reveals, one of its most significant aims wasto "preserve the author's copyright in a contribution even if
the contribution does not bear a separate notice in the au-thor's name, and without requiring any unqualified transfer
of rights to the owner of the collective work." H. R. Rep.No. 94-1476, p. 122 (1976) (hereinafter H. R. Rep.) (discussing
the purpose of $ 201(c)). Indeed, $ 404(a) states that "a single notice applicable to the collective work as a whole is sufficient" to protect the author's rights.

The second significant change effected by the 1976 Act
clarified the scope of the privilege granted to the publisher
of a collective work. While pre-1976 law had the effect of
encouraging an author to transfer her entire copyright to the

2 Cf. Goodis v. United Artists Television, Inc., 425 F. 2d 397 (CA2 1970)
(creating a legal fiction in which the publisher to whom an author gave
first publication rights was considered the legal owner of the author's
copyright, which the publisher was deemed to hold in trust for the "beneficial owner," the author).

3 "Usually, publishers are perfectly willing to return copyright to the

author, at least with respect to everything except enumerated serial or
reprint rights. There have been allegations that smaller publishers sometimes believe that they are entitled to share in the subsidiary rights and
refuse to reassign, or insist upon sharing part of the profits of [the] sales
to motion picture, television or dramatic users. In these cases, the author
must undertake the burden of proving his contract with the publisher and
demonstrating his capacity to sue." Kaminstein 21.

publisher of a collective work, $ 201(c) creates the oppositeincentive, stating that, absent some agreement to the contrary, the publisher acquires from the author only "the privi-lege of reproducing and distributing the contribution as part
of that particular collective work, any revision of that collec-tive work, and any later collective work in the same series."

4

Congress intended this limitation on what the author is pre-sumed to give away primarily to keep publishers from "revis[ing] the contribution itself or includ[ing] it in a new an-thology or an

entirely different magazine or other collectivework." H. R. Rep. 122-123.

4 Respondents Garson and Robbins argue that the $ 201(c) privilege is
completely nontransferable. See Brief for Respondents Garson et al. 26-
29. The District Court properly rejected this argument, see 972 F. Supp.
804, 815-816 (SDNY 1997), which, in my view, is supported by neither the
text nor the legislative history of $ 201(c). Publishers obviously cannot
assign their publication privilege to another publisher such that the author's work appears in a wholly different collective work, but nothing in

$ 201(c) clearly prohibits a publisher from merely farming out the mundane
task of printing or distributing its collective work or its revision of that
collective work. Because neither the majority nor the Court of Appeals
has reached this issue, however, see ante, at 493; 206 F. 3d 161, 165, and
n. 2 (CA2 2000), I will not address it further.

5 As the District Court observed, representatives of authors had objected to an earlier draft of the 1976 Act that might have been read to
give publishers the right to change the text of the contributions. That
version gave publishers the privilege to print the individual article " `as
part of that particular collective work and any revisions of it.' " 972
F. Supp., at 819. Harriet Pilpel, "a prominent author representative," expressed the following concern:

" `I have but one question with reference to the wording, and that is with
respect to the wording at the end of subsection (c) `. . . and any revisions
of it.' If that means `any revision of the collective work' in terms of
changing the contributions, or their order, or including different contributions, obviously the magazine writers and photographers would not object.
But there is an implication, or at least an ambiguity, that somehow the
owner of the collective work has a right to make revisions in the contributions to the collective work. This is not and should not be the law, and
consequently I suggest that the wording at the end of subsection (c) be
changed to make that absolutely clear.' " 1964 Revision Bill with Discus533US2 Unit: $U83 [11-01-02 19:20:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN

The majority is surely correct that the 1976 Act's new approach to collective works was an attempt to " `clarify and
improve the . . . confused and frequently unfair legal situation' " that existed under the prior regime. Id., at 122. It
is also undoubtedly true that the drafters of the 1976 Act
hoped to "enhance the author's position vis-a` -vis the patron."
Ante, at 495, n. 3. It does not follow, however, that Congress' efforts to "preserve the author's copyright in a contribution," H. R. Rep. 122, can only be honored by a finding in
favor of the respondent authors.

Indeed, the conclusion that the petitioners' actions were
lawful is fully consistent with both of Congress' principal
goals for collective works in the 1976 Act. First, neither the
publication of the collective works by the Print Publishers
nor their transfer to the Electronic Databases had any impact on the legal status of the copyrights of the respondents'
individual contributions.6 By virtue of the 1976 Act, respondents remain the owners of the copyright in their individual works. Moreover, petitioners neither modified respondents' individual contributions nor, as I will show in
Part II, published them in a "new anthology or an entirely
different magazine or other collective work." Id., at 122-
123 (emphasis added). Because I do not think it is at all
obvious that the decision the majority reaches today is a result clearly intended by the 1976 Congress, I disagree with
the Court's conclusion that a ruling in petitioners' favor

sions and Comments, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 5, p. 9 (H. Comm. Print
1965), quoted in 972 F. Supp., at 819.

6 Nor is the majority correct that, even if respondents retained copyright

in their individual articles, the conclusion that petitioners could republish
their collective works on the Electronic Databases would drain that copyright of value. See infra, at 521-522. Even on my view of this case,
respondents retain substantial rights over their articles. Only the respondents, for example, could authorize the publication of their articles in
different periodicals or in new topical anthologies wholly apart from the
context of the original collective works in which their articles appeared.

would "shrink authorial rights" that "Congress [has] estab-lished." Ante, at 506 (emphasis added).

II
Not only is petitioners' position consistent with Congress'general goals in the 1976 Act, it is also consistent with the

text of $ 201(c). That provision allows the publisher of a col-lective work to "reproduc[e] and distribut[e] the contribution
as part of that particular collective work, any revision of thatcollective work, and any later collective work in the same
series." The central question in this case, then, is whetherpetitioners are correct when they argue that publication of
the respondents' articles in the various Electronic Databasesat issue in this case is nothing more than "reproduc[tion] and
distribut[ion] [of] the contribution as part of . . . revision[s]of [the original] collective work[s]" in which respondents' articles appeared. I agree with petitioners that neither theconversion of the Print Publishers' collective works from
printed to electronic form, nor the transmission of those elec-tronic versions of the collective works to the Electronic
Databases, nor even the actions of the Electronic Databasesonce they receive those electronic versions does anything to
deprive those electronic versions of their status as mere "re-vision[s]" of the original collective works.

A proper analysis of this case benefits from an incremen-tal approach. Accordingly, I begin by discussing an issue
the majority largely ignores: whether a collection of articlesfrom a single edition of the New York Times (i. e., the batch
of files the Print Publishers periodically send to the Elec-tronic Databases) constitutes a "revision" of an individual
edition of the paper. In other words, does a single articlewithin such a collection exist as "part of " a "revision"? Like
the majority, I believe that the crucial inquiry is whether thearticle appears within the "context" of the original collective
work. Ante, at 502. But this question simply raises thefurther issue of precisely how much "context" is enough.

512 NEW YORK TIMES CO. v. TASINI

Stevens, J., dissenting
The record indicates that what is sent from the New York
Times to the Electronic Databases (with the exception of
General Periodicals OnDisc (GPO)) is simply a collection of
ASCII text files representing the editorial content of the
New York Times for a particular day.7 App. 73a. Each individual ASCII file contains the text of a single article as
well as additional coding intended to help readers identify
the context in which the article originally appeared and to
facilitate database searches. Thus, for example, to the original text of an article, the New York Times adds information
on the article's "headline, byline and title," "the section of
the paper in which the article had originally appeared," and
"the page in the paper or periodical on which the article had
first appeared." Id., at 75a-76a.8

I see no compelling reason why a collection of files corresponding to a single edition of the New York Times, standing
alone, cannot constitute a "revision" of that day's New York
Times. It might be argued, as respondents appear to do,
that the presentation of each article within its own electronic
file makes it impossible to claim that the collection of files as
a whole amounts to a "revision." Brief for Respondents
Tasini et al. 34. But the conversion of the text of the overall
collective work into separate electronic files should not, by
itself, decide the question. After all, one of the hallmarks
of copyright policy, as the majority recognizes, ante, at 502,
is the principle of media neutrality. See H. R. Rep. 53.

No one doubts that the New York Times has the right
to reprint its issues in Braille, in a foreign language, or in

7 ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a
standard means for storing textual data. It assigns a unique binary code
for each letter of the alphabet, as well as for numbers, punctuation,
and other characters. It cannot be used to convey graphical information. See C. Mackenzie, Coded Character Sets: History and Development
211-213 (1980).

to prepare their files for electronic publication. App. 74a.

microform, even though such revisions might look and feelquite different from the original. Such differences, however, would largely result from the different medium beingemployed. Similarly, the decision to convert the single collective work newspaper into a collection of individual ASCIIfiles can be explained as little more than a decision that reflects the different nature of the electronic medium. Just asthe paper version of the New York Times is divided into
"sections" and "pages" in order to facilitate the reader's navi-gation and manipulation of large batches of newsprint, so
too the decision to subdivide the electronic version of thatcollective work into individual article files facilitates the
reader's use of the electronic information. The barebonesnature of ASCII text would make trying to wade through a
single ASCII file containing the entire content of a singleedition of the New York Times an exercise in frustration.

9

Although the Court does not separately discuss the ques-tion whether the groups of files that the New York Times

sends to the Electronic Databases constitute "revision[s]," itsreasoning strongly suggests that it would not accept such a
characterization. The majority, for example, places signifi-cant emphasis on the differences between the various Electronic Databases and microform, a medium that admittedlyqualifies as a revision under $ 201(c).

10 As with the conversion of individual editions into collections of separatearticle files, however, many of the differences between the

9 An ASCII version of the October 31, 2000, New York Times, which
contains 287 articles, would fill over 500 printed pages. Conversely, in the
case of graphical products like GPO, the demands that memory-intensive
graphics files can place on underpowered computers make it appropriate
for electronic publishers to divide the larger collective work into manageably sized subfiles. The individual article is the logical unit. The GPO
version of the April 7, 1996, New York Times Magazine, for example,
would demand in the neighborhood of 200 megabytes of memory if stored
as a single file, whereas individual article files range from 4 to 22 megabytes, depending on the length of the article.

electronic versions and microform are necessitated by theelectronic medium. The Court therefore appears to back

away from principles of media neutrality when it implicitlycriticizes ASCII-text files for their inability to reproduce
"Remembering Jane" "in the very same position, within afilm reproduction of the entire Magazine, in turn within a
reproduction of the entire September 23, 1990, edition."
Ante, at 501.11In contrast, I think that a proper respect for media neutrality suggests that the New York Times, reproduced as acollection of individual ASCII files, should be treated as a
"revision" of the original edition, as long as each article ex-plicitly refers to the original collective work and as long as
substantially the rest of the collective work is, at the sametime, readily accessible to the reader of the individual file.
In this case, no one disputes that the first pieces of informa-tion a user sees when looking at an individual ASCII article
file are the name of the publication in which the article appeared, the edition of that publication, and the location of thearticle within that edition. I agree with the majority that

such labeling alone is insufficient to establish that the in-dividual file exists as "part of " a revision of the original collective work. See ante, at 500-501. But such labeling isnot all there is in the group of files sent to the Electronic
Databases.In addition to the labels, the batch of electronic files contains the entire editorial content of the original edition ofthe New York Times for that day. That is, while I might
agree that a single article, standing alone, even when codedwith identifying information (

headline, etc.), should not be characterized as a "part of " alarger collective work, I would not say the same about an

individual article existing as "part of " a collection of articlescontaining all the editorial content of that day's New York
Times. This is all the more true because, as the DistrictCourt correctly noted, it is the Print Publishers' selection
process, the editorial process by which the staff of the NewYork Times, for example, decides which articles will be included in "All the News That's Fit to Print," that is the mostimportant creative element they contribute to the collective
works they publish. 972 F. Supp. 804, 823 (SDNY 1997).12While such superficial features as page placement and column width are lost in ASCII format, the Print Publishers'all-important editorial selection is wholly preserved in the
collection of individual article files sent to the ElectronicDatabases.

To see why an electronic version of the New York Timesmade up of a group of individual ASCII article files, standing
alone, may be considered a $ 201(c) revision, suppose that,instead of transmitting to NEXIS the articles making up a
particular day's edition, the New York Times saves all of theindividual files on a single floppy disk, labels that disk "New
York Times, October 31, 2000," and sells copies of the diskto users as the electronic version of that day's New York
Times. The disk reproduces the creative, editorial selectionof that edition of the New York Times. The reader, after
all, has at his fingertips substantially all of the relevant con-tent of the October 31 edition of the collective work. Moreover, each individual article makes explicit reference to thatselection by including tags that remind the reader that it is
a part of the New York Times for October 31, 2000. Such adisk might well constitute "that particular collective work";
it would surely qualify as a "revision" of the original collec12 "The New York Times perhaps even represents the paradigm, the epitome of a publication in which selection alone reflects sufficient originality
to merit copyright protection." 972 F. Supp., at 823.

tive work. Yet all the features identified as essential by themajority and by the respondents would still be lacking. An

individual looking at one of the articles contained on the diskwould still see none of the original formatting context and
would still be unable to flip the page.Once one accepts the premise that a disk containing all the
files from the October 31, 2000, New York Times can consti-tute a "revision," there is no reason to treat any differently
the same set of files, stored in a folder on the hard disk of acomputer at the New York Times. Thus, at least before it
is republished by the Electronic Databases, the collection offiles that the New York Times transmits to them constitutes
a revision, in electronic form, of a particular edition of theNew York Times.

III
The next question, then, is whether anything that theElectronic Databases do to the transmitted "revision" strips

it of that status. The heart of the Court's reasoning in thisrespect, as I understand it, is that, once received and processed by Electronic Databases, the data transmitted by theNew York Times cannot be viewed as "revisions" within the
meaning of $ 201(c) because of the way that data is storedand made available to the public by those Databases. First,
the Court points to the fact that "the three Databases pre-sent articles to users clear of the context provided either by
the original periodical editions or by any revision of thoseeditions."

Ante, at 499. I have already addressed theseformatting concerns. Second, and not wholly unrelated

to the first point, however, the Court appears to thinkthat the commingling of my hypothetical collection of ASCII
article files from the October 31, 2000, New York Timeswith similar collections of files from other editions of the
New York Times (or from other periodicals) within one data-base would deprive that collection of revision status. See
ante, at 501, n. 9. Even if my imaginary floppy disk could,in isolation, be considered a revision, the majority might

say, that status would be lost if the floppy disk were to con-tain, not only the files from the October 31, 2000, New York

Times, but also from the New York Times for every otherday in 2000 (and other years) and from hundreds of other
periodicals. I disagree.If my hypothetical October 31, 2000, floppy disk can be a
revision, I do not see why the inclusion of other editions andother periodicals is any more significant than the placement
of a single edition of the New York Times in a large publiclibrary or in a bookstore. Each individual file still reminds
the reader that he is viewing "part of " a particular collectivework. And the

entire editorial content of that work stillexists at the reader's fingertips.

13

It is true that, once the revision of the October 31, 2000,New York Times is surrounded by the additional content, it

can be conceptualized as existing as part of an even largercollective work (e. g., the entire NEXIS database). See
ante, at 500. The question then becomes whether this abil-ity to conceive of a revision of a collective work as existing
within a larger "collective work" changes the status of theoriginal revision. Section 201(c)'s requirement that the article be published only as "part of . . . any revision of that
collective work" does not compel any particular answer tothat question. A microfilm of the New York Times for October 31, 2000, does not cease to be a revision of that individualcollective work simply because it is stored on the same roll
of film as other editions of the Times or on a library shelfcontaining hundreds of other microfilm periodicals. Nor
does $ 201(c) compel the counterintuitive conclusion that themicrofilm version of the Times would cease to be a revision
simply because its publishers might choose to sell it on rollsof film that contained a year's editions of both the New York
Times and the Herald-Tribune. Similarly, the placement of

October 31, 2000, New York Times by conducting the following simple
search in the correct "library": "date (is 10/31/2000)."

our hypothetical electronic revision of the October 31, 2000,New York Times within a larger electronic database does

nothing to alter either the nature of our original electronicrevision or the relationship between that revision and the
individual articles that exist as "part of " it.Finally, the mere fact that an individual user may either
view or print copies of individual articles stored on the Elec-tronic Databases does not change the nature of the revisions
contained within those databases. The same media-specificnecessities that allow the publishers to store and make available the original collective work as a collection of individualdigital files make it reasonable for the Electronic Databases
to enable the user to download or print only those files inwhich the user has a particular interest. But this is no different from microfilm. Just as nothing intrinsic in the na-ture of microfilm dictates to a user how much or how little
of a microform edition of the New York Times she must copy,nothing intrinsic in the Electronic Databases dictates to a
user how much (or how little) of a particular edition of theNew York Times to view or print. It is up to the user in
each instance to decide whether to employ the publisher'sproduct in a manner that infringes either the publisher's or
the author's copyright. And to the extent that the user'sdecision to make a copy of a particular article violates the
author's copyright in that article, such infringing third-partybehavior should not be attributed to the database.

the complex questions presented by this case. It is, never-theless, one that is consistent with the statutory text and

entirely faithful to the statute's purposes. Respect for thepolicies motivating its enactment, to which I now turn,
makes it wrong for the Court to reject this reading of$ 201(c).

It is likely that the Congress that enacted the 1976
revision of the law of copyright did not anticipate the de-velopments that occurred in the 1980's which gave rise

to the practices challenged in this litigation. See Miller,Copyright Protection for Computer Programs, Databases,
and Computer-Generated Works: Is Anything New SinceCONTU?, 106 Harv. L. Rev. 977, 979 (1993) (in 1976, "Congress . . . decided to avoid grappling with technological issuesthat obviously required more study than the legislative process was then willing to give them").15 Thus, in resolvingambiguities in the relevant text of the statute, we should be
mindful of the policies underlying copyright law.Macaulay wrote that copyright is "a tax on readers for
the purpose of giving a bounty to writers." T. Macaulay,
Speeches on Copyright 11 (A. Thorndike ed. 1915). That taxrestricts the dissemination of writings, but only insofar as

necessary to encourage their production, the bounty's basicobjective. See U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 8, cl. 8. In other
words, "[t]he primary purpose of copyright is not to rewardthe author, but is rather to secure `the general benefits
derived by the public from the labors of authors.' " 1 M.Nimmer & D. Nimmer, Copyright $ 1.03[A] (2000) (quoting

copyright law--protecting the reader's desire for access toideas and providing incentives for authors to produce them).
The majority's decision today unnecessarily subverts thisfundamental goal of copyright law in favor of a narrow focus
on "authorial rights." Ante, at 506. Although the desire toprotect such rights is certainly a laudable sentiment,

16 copyright law demands that "private motivation must ultimatelyserve the cause of promoting

broad public availability ofliterature, music, and the other arts." Twentieth Century

Music Corp. v. Aiken, 422 U. S. 151, 156 (1975) (emphasisadded).

The majority discounts the effect its decision will have onthe availability of comprehensive digital databases, ante, at
504-505, but I am not as confident. As petitioners' amicihave persuasively argued, the difficulties of locating individual freelance authors and the potential of exposure to statu-tory damages may well have the effect of forcing electronic
archives to purge freelance pieces from their databases.17"The omission of these materials from electronic collections,
for any reason on a large scale or even an occasional basis,undermines the principal benefits that electronic archives
offer historians--efficiency, accuracy and comprehensive-ness."

17 Indeed, today's decision in favor of authors may have the perverse

consequence of encouraging publishers to demand from freelancers a complete transfer of copyright. If that turns out to be the case, we will have
come full circle back to the pre-1976 situation.

18 If the problem is as important as amici contend, congressional action

may ultimately be necessary to preserve present databases in their entirety. At the least, Congress can determine the nature and scope of the

Stevens, J., dissenting
Moreover, it is far from clear that my position even de-prives authors of much of anything (with the exception of

perhaps the retrospective statutory damages that may wellresult from their victory today).

19 Imagine, for example,

that one of the contributions at issue in this case were acopyrighted version of John Keats' Ode on a Grecian Urn,

published on page 29 of our hypothetical October 31, 2000,
New York Times. Even under my reading of $ 201(c), Keatsretains valuable copyright protection. No matter how well

received his ode might be, it is unlikely--although admit-tedly possible--that it could be marketed as a stand-alone
work of art. The ode, however, would be an obvious candi-date for inclusion in an anthology of works by romantic
poets, in a collection of poems by the same author, or evenin "a 400-page novel quoting a [poem] in passing,"

ante, at
500. The author's copyright would protect his right to com-pensation for any such use. Cf.

Stewart v. Abend, 495 U. S.
207, 228 (1990) (discussing the value to authors of derivativeworks). Moreover, the value of the ode surely would be enhanced, not decreased, by the accessibility and readership of
the October 31, 2000, edition of the New York Times. Theready availability of that edition, both at the time of its first

publication and subsequently in libraries and electronic data-bases, would be a benefit, not an injury, to most authors.
Keats would benefit from the poem's continued availabilityto database users, by his identification as the author of the
piece, and by the database's indication of the fact that the
poem first appeared in a prestigious periodical on a certain
date. He would not care one whit whether the database inproblem and fashion an appropriate licensing remedy far more easily than
can courts. Cf. 17 U. S. C. $ 108(d)(1).

19 It is important to remember that the prospect of payment by the Print

Publishers was sufficient to stimulate each petitioner to create his or her
part of the collective works, presumably with full awareness of its intended inclusion in the Electronic Databases.

Stevens, J., dissenting
dicated the formatting context of the page on which thepoem appeared. What is overwhelmingly clear is that maximizing the readership of the ode would enhance the value ofhis remaining copyright uses.

Nor is it clear that Keats will gain any prospective benefitsfrom a victory in this case. As counsel for petitioners represented at oral argument, since 1995, the New York Timeshas required freelance authors to grant the Times "electronic
rights" to articles. Tr. of Oral Arg. 7. And the inclusion ofsuch a term has had

no effect on the compensation authorsreceive. See ibid. This is understandable because, even if

one accepts the majority's characterization of the ElectronicDatabases as collections of freestanding articles, demand for
databases like NEXIS probably does not reflect a "demandfor a freelance article standing alone," ante, at 497, to which
the publishers are greedily helping themselves. Cf. Ryan v.Carl Corp., 23 F. Supp. 2d 1146, 1150-1151 (ND Cal. 1998)
("[T]he value added by the publisher to a reproduced articleis significant").

Instead, it seems far more likely that demand for the Elec-tronic Databases reflects demand for a product that will provide a user with the means to quickly search through scoresof complete periodicals. The comments of historian Douglas
Brinkley are instructive in this respect:

" `As an historian, when I want to write a biography, ifI'm going to write a biography of Bill Clinton, the first

thing I would do would be to index The New YorkTimes. I would work through [the] microfiche and get
any time Bill Clinton's name ever appeared in The NewYork Times. I'd get a copy of that. So, you'd have
boxes of files. So for each month, here's Clinton thismonth. . . . You then would fill that in with . . . other
obvious books or articles from Foreign Affairs or For-eign Policy or The New Yorker, or the like and you'd
start getting your first biography of Bill Clinton.' "Panel Discussion: The Observer's View (D. Brinkley, M.

Users like Douglas Brinkley do not go to NEXIS because itcontains a score of individual articles by Jonathan Tasini.

20

Rather, they go to NEXIS because it contains a comprehen-sive and easily searchable collection of (intact) periodicals.

20 Even assuming, as the majority does, see ante, at 497-498, n. 6, that
the existence of databases like NEXIS may have some adverse effect on
the market for stand-alone compilations of authors' contributions to collective works, I fail to see how, on that basis, electronic databases are any
different from microform. With respect to effects on the market for
stand-alone works, the only difference between the two products is the
speed with which digital technology allows NEXIS users to retrieve the
desired data. But the 1976 Act was not intended to bar the use of every
conceivable innovation in technology that might " `giv[e] publishers [new]
opportunities to exploit authors' works.' " Ante, at 498, n. 6. Copyright
law is not an insurance policy for authors, but a carefully struck balance
between the need to create incentives for authorship and the interests
of society in the broad accessibility of ideas. See U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 8,
cl. 8 (in order to promote production, Congress should allow authors and
inventors to enjoy "exclusive Right[s]," but only "for limited Times"
(emphasis added)); see also supra, at 519-520. The majority's focus on
authorial incentive comes at the expense of the equally important (at least
from the perspective of copyright policy) public interest.

Moreover, the majority's single-minded focus on "authorial rights" appears to lead it to believe that, because some authors may benefit from its
decision, that decision must be the one intended by Congress. It cites
the " `economic philosophy behind the [Copyright Clause]' " as consistent
with its view that Congress adjusted "the author/publisher balance" precisely to avoid the types of uses embodied in the Electronic Databases.
See ante, at 495, n. 3. But, as I have already argued, see supra, at 519,
there is no indication that Congress ever considered the issue presented
in this case. It thus simply begs the question for the majority to argue
that the right not to have a work included within the Electronic Databases
is an "authorial right" that "Congress [has] established," ante, at 506 (emphasis added), or that--given Congress' failure clearly to address itself to
the question--a decision allowing such inclusion would amount to "diminish[ing]" authorial "rights" on the basis of "our conception of their interests," ante, at 498, n. 6 (emphasis added).

question raised by this case when drafting $ 201(c), becauseI think the District Court's reading of that provision is reasonable and consistent with the statute's purposes, andbecause the principal goals of copyright policy are better
served by that reading, I would reverse the judgment of theCourt of Appeals. The majority is correct that we cannot
know in advance the effects of today's decision on the com-prehensiveness of electronic databases. We can be fairly
certain, however, that it will provide little, if any, benefit toeither authors or readers.

LORILLARD TOBACCO CO. et al. v. REILLY, ATTOR-NEY GENERAL OF MASSACHUSETTS,

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe first circuit

No. 00-596. Argued April 25, 2001--Decided June 28, 2001*
After the Attorney General of Massachusetts (Attorney General) promulgated comprehensive regulations governing the advertising and sale of
cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, and cigars, petitioners, a group of tobacco
manufacturers and retailers, filed this suit asserting, among other
things, the Supremacy Clause claim that the cigarette advertising regulations are pre-empted by the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act (FCLAA), which prescribes mandatory health warnings for
cigarette packaging and advertising, 15 U. S. C. $ 1333, and pre-empts
similar state regulations, $ 1334(b); and a claim that the regulations violate the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Federal Constitution.
In large measure, the District Court upheld the regulations. Among
its rulings, the court held that restrictions on the location of advertising
were not pre-empted by the FCLAA, and that neither the regulations
prohibiting outdoor advertising within 1,000 feet of a school or playground nor the sales practices regulations restricting the location and
distribution of tobacco products violated the First Amendment. The
court ruled, however, that the point-of-sale advertising regulations requiring that indoor advertising be placed no lower than five feet from
the floor were invalid because the Attorney General had not provided
sufficient justification for that restriction. The First Circuit affirmed
the District Court's rulings that the cigarette advertising regulations
are not pre-empted by the FCLAA and that the outdoor advertising
regulations and the sales practices regulations do not violate the First
Amendment under Central Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv.
Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 557, but reversed the lower court's invalidation of the point-of-sale advertising regulations, concluding that the Attorney General is better suited than courts to determine what restrictions are necessary.

Held:

1. The FCLAA pre-empts Massachusetts' regulations governing outdoor and point-of-sale cigarette advertising. Pp. 540-553.

*Together with No. 00-597, Altadis U. S. A. Inc., as Successor to Consolidated Cigar Corp. and Havatampa, Inc., et al. v. Reilly, Attorney
General of Massachusetts, et al., also on certiorari to the same court.

526 LORILLARD TOBACCO CO. v. REILLY

Syllabus
(a) The FCLAA's pre-emption provision, $ 1334, prohibits (a) requiring cigarette packages to bear any "statement relating to smoking
and health, other than the statement required by" $ 1333, and (b) any
"requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health . . . imposed
under state law with respect to the advertising or promotion of any
cigarettes the packages of which are labeled in conformity with" $ 1333.
The Court's analysis begins with the statute's language. Hughes Aircraft Co. v. Jacobson, 525 U. S. 432, 438. The statute's interpretation is
aided by considering the predecessor pre-emption provision and the context in which the current language was adopted. See, e. g., Medtronic,
Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U. S. 470, 486. The original provision simply prohibited any "statement relating to smoking and health . . . in the advertising of any cigarettes the packages of which are labeled in conformity
with the [Act's] provisions." Without question, the current pre-emption
provision's plain language is much broader. Cipollone v. Liggett Group,
Inc., 505 U. S. 504, 520. Rather than preventing only "statements," the
amended provision reaches all "requirement[s] or prohibition[s] . . . imposed under State law." And, although the former statute reached only
statements "in the advertising," the current provision governs "with
respect to the advertising or promotion" of cigarettes. At the same
time that Congress expanded the pre-emption provision with respect to
the States, it enacted a provision prohibiting cigarette advertising in
electronic media altogether. Pp. 540-546.

(b) Congress pre-empted state cigarette advertising regulations
like the Attorney General's because they would upset federal legislative
choices to require specific warnings and to impose the ban on cigarette
advertising in electronic media in order to address concerns about smoking and health. In holding that the FCLAA does not nullify the Massachusetts regulations, the First Circuit concentrated on whether they are
"with respect to" advertising and promotion, concluding that the
FCLAA only pre-empts regulations of the content of cigarette advertising. The court also reasoned that the regulations are a form of zoning,
a traditional area of state power, and, therefore, a presumption against
pre-emption applied, see California Div. of Labor Standards Enforcement v. Dillingham Constr., N. A., Inc., 519 U. S. 316, 325. This Court
rejects the notion that the regulations are not "with respect to" cigarette advertising and promotion. There is no question about an indirect relationship between the Massachusetts regulations and cigarette
advertising: The regulations expressly target such advertising. Id., at
324-325. The Attorney General's argument that the regulations are
not "based on smoking and health" since they do not involve healthrelated content, but instead target youth exposure to cigarette advertising, is unpersuasive because, at bottom, the youth exposure concern is

Syllabus
intertwined with the smoking and health concern. Also unavailing is
the Attorney General's claim that the regulations are not pre-empted
because they govern the location, not the content, of cigarette advertising. The content/location distinction cannot be squared with the preemption provision's language, which reaches all "requirements" and
"prohibitions" "imposed under State law." A distinction between advertising content and location in the FCLAA also cannot be reconciled
with Congress' own location-based restriction, which bans advertising
in electronic media, but not elsewhere. The Attorney General's assertion that a complete state ban on cigarette advertising would not be
pre-empted because Congress did not intend to preclude local control of
zoning finds no support in the FCLAA, whose comprehensive warnings,
advertising restrictions, and pre-emption provision would make little
sense if a State or locality could simply target and ban all cigarette
advertising. Pp. 546-551.

(c) The FCLAA's pre-emption provision does not restrict States'
and localities' ability to enact generally applicable zoning restrictions on
the location and size of advertisements that apply to cigarettes on equal
terms with other products, see, e. g., Metromedia, Inc. v. San Diego, 453
U. S. 490, 507-508, or to regulate conduct as it relates to the sale or use
of cigarettes, as by prohibiting cigarette sales to minors, see 42 U. S. C.

$$ 300x-26(a)(1), 300x-21, as well as common inchoate offenses that attach to criminal conduct, such as solicitation, conspiracy, and attempt,
cf. Central Hudson, supra, at 563-564. Pp. 551-552.

(d) Because the issue was not decided below, the Court declines
to reach the smokeless tobacco petitioners' argument that, if the outdoor and point-of-sale advertising regulations for cigarettes are preempted, then the same regulations for smokeless tobacco must be invalidated because they cannot be severed from the cigarette provisions.
P. 553.

2. Massachusetts' outdoor and point-of-sale advertising regulations
relating to smokeless tobacco and cigars violate the First Amendment,
but the sales practices regulations relating to all three tobacco products
are constitutional. Pp. 553-571.

(a) Under Central Hudson's four-part test for analyzing regulations of commercial speech, the Court must determine (1) whether the
expression is protected by the First Amendment, (2) whether the asserted governmental interest is substantial, (3) whether the regulation
directly advances the governmental interest asserted, and (4) whether
it is not more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest. 447
U. S., at 566. Only the last two steps are at issue here. The Attorney
General has assumed for summary judgment purposes that the First
Amendment protects the speech of petitioners, none of whom contests

the importance of the State's interest in preventing the use of tobacco
by minors. The third step of Central Hudson requires that the government demonstrate that the harms it recites are real and that its restriction will in fact alleviate them to a material degree. Edenfield v. Fane,
507 U. S. 761, 770-771. The fourth step of Central Hudson requires a
reasonable fit between the legislature's ends and the means chosen to
accomplish those ends, a means narrowly tailored to achieve the desired
objective. E. g., Florida Bar v. Went For It, Inc., 515 U. S. 618, 632.
Pp. 553-556.

(b) The outdoor advertising regulations prohibiting smokeless tobacco or cigar advertising within 1,000 feet of a school or playground
violate the First Amendment. Pp. 556-566.

(1) Those regulations satisfy Central Hudson's third step by directly advancing the governmental interest asserted to justify them.
The Court's detailed review of the record reveals that the Attorney
General has provided ample documentation of the problem with underage use of smokeless tobacco and cigars. In addition, the Court disagrees with petitioners' claim that there is no evidence that preventing
targeted advertising campaigns and limiting youth exposure to advertising will decrease underage use of those products. On the record
below and in the posture of summary judgment, it cannot be concluded
that the Attorney General's decision to regulate smokeless tobacco and
cigar advertising in an effort to combat the use of tobacco products by
minors was based on mere "speculation and conjecture." Edenfield,
supra, at 770. Pp. 556-561.

(2) Whatever the strength of the Attorney General's evidence to
justify the outdoor advertising regulations, however, the regulations do
not satisfy Central Hudson's fourth step. Their broad sweep indicates
that the Attorney General did not "carefully calculat[e] the costs and
benefits associated with the burden on speech imposed." Cincinnati v.
Discovery Network, Inc., 507 U. S. 410, 417. The record indicates that
the regulations prohibit advertising in a substantial portion of Massachusetts' major metropolitan areas; in some areas, they would constitute
nearly a complete ban on the communication of truthful information.
This substantial geographical reach is compounded by other factors.
"Outdoor" advertising includes not only advertising located outside an
establishment, but also advertising inside a store if visible from outside.
Moreover, the regulations restrict advertisements of any size, and the
term advertisement also includes oral statements. The uniformly
broad sweep of the geographical limitation and the range of communications restricted demonstrate a lack of tailoring. The governmental interest in preventing underage tobacco use is substantial, and even compelling, but it is no less true that the sale and use of tobacco products by

Syllabus
adults is a legal activity. A speech regulation cannot unduly impinge on
the speaker's ability to propose a commercial transaction and the adult
listener's opportunity to obtain information about products. The Attorney General has failed to show that the regulations at issue are not
more extensive than necessary. Pp. 561-566.

(c) The regulations prohibiting indoor, point-of-sale advertising of
smokeless tobacco and cigars lower than 5 feet from the floor of a retail
establishment located within 1,000 feet of a school or playground fail
both the third and fourth steps of the Central Hudson analysis. The
5-foot rule does not seem to advance the goals of preventing minors
from using tobacco products and curbing demand for that activity by
limiting youth exposure to advertising. Not all children are less than
5 feet tall, and those who are can look up and take in their surroundings.
Nor can the blanket height restriction be construed as a mere regulation
of communicative action under United States v. O'Brien, 391 U. S. 367,
since it is not unrelated to expression, see, e. g., Texas v. Johnson, 491
U. S. 397, 403, but attempts to regulate directly the communicative impact of indoor advertising. Moreover, the restriction does not constitute a reasonable fit with the goal of targeting tobacco advertising that
entices children. Although the First Circuit decided that the restriction's burden on speech is very limited, there is no de minimis exception
for a speech restriction that lacks sufficient tailoring or justification.
Pp. 566-567.

(d) Assuming that petitioners have a cognizable speech interest in
a particular means of displaying their products, cf. Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, Inc., supra, at 410, the regulations requiring retailers to
place tobacco products behind counters and requiring customers to have
contact with a salesperson before they are able to handle such a product
withstand First Amendment scrutiny. The State has demonstrated a
substantial interest in preventing access to tobacco products by minors
and has adopted an appropriately narrow means of advancing that interest. See, e. g., O'Brien, supra, at 382. Because unattended displays of
such products present an opportunity for access without the proper age
verification required by law, the State prohibits self-service and other
displays that would allow an individual to obtain tobacco without direct
contact with a salesperson. It is clear that the regulations leave open
ample communication channels. They do not significantly impede adult
access to tobacco products, and retailers have other means of exercising
any cognizable speech interest in the presentation of their products.
The Court presumes that vendors may place empty tobacco packaging
on open display, and display actual tobacco products so long as that
display is only accessible to sales personnel. As for cigars, there is
no indication that a customer is unable to examine a cigar prior to pur533US2 Unit: $U84 [11-05-02 18:55:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Pp. 567-570.

Opinion of the Court
Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.
In January 1999, the Attorney General of Massachusetts
promulgated comprehensive regulations governing the ad-vertising and sale of cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, and cigars. 940 Code of Mass. Regs. $$ 21.01-21.07, 22.01-22.09(2000). Petitioners, a group of cigarette, smokeless tobacco,
and cigar manufacturers and retailers, filed suit in Federal
District Court claiming that the regulations violate federal
law and the United States Constitution. In large measure,
the District Court determined that the regulations are valid
and enforceable. The United States Court of Appeals for
the First Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part, concluding that the regulations are not pre-empted by federal
law and do not violate the First Amendment. The first
question presented for our review is whether certain cigarette advertising regulations are pre-empted by the Federal
Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act (FCLAA), 79 Stat.
282, as amended, 15 U. S. C. $ 1331 et seq. The second question presented is whether certain regulations governing the
advertising and sale of tobacco products violate the First
Amendment.

Opinion of the Court

I
In November 1998, Massachusetts, along with over 40other States, reached a landmark agreement with major

manufacturers in the cigarette industry. The signatoryStates settled their claims against these companies in exchange for monetary payments and permanent injunctive re-lief. See App. 253-258 (Outline of Terms for Massachusetts
in National Tobacco Settlement); Master Settlement Agree-ment (Nov. 23, 1998), http://www.naag.org. At the press
conference covering Massachusetts' decision to sign theagreement, then-Attorney General Scott Harshbarger announced that as one of his last acts in office, he would createconsumer protection regulations to restrict advertising and
sales practices for tobacco products. He explained that theregulations were necessary in order to "close holes" in the
settlement agreement and "to stop Big Tobacco from recruit-ing new customers among the children of Massachusetts."
App. 251.In January 1999, pursuant to his authority to prevent
unfair or deceptive practices in trade, Mass. Gen. Laws,ch. 93A, $ 2 (1997), the Massachusetts Attorney General (Attorney General) promulgated regulations governing the saleand advertisement of cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, and cigars. The purpose of the cigarette and smokeless tobaccoregulations is "to eliminate deception and unfairness in the
way cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products are marketed, sold and distributed in Massachusetts in order to ad-dress the incidence of cigarette smoking and smokeless tobacco use by children under legal age . . . [and] in order toprevent access to such products by underage consumers."
940 Code of Mass. Regs. $ 21.01 (2000). The similar purposeof the cigar regulations is "to eliminate deception and unfairness in the way cigars and little cigars are packaged, mar-keted, sold and distributed in Massachusetts [so that] . . .
consumers may be adequately informed about the health

Opinion of the Court
risks associated with cigar smoking, its addictive properties,
and the false perception that cigars are a safe alternative to
cigarettes . . . [and so that] the incidence of cigar use by
children under legal age is addressed . . . in order to prevent
access to such products by underage consumers." Ibid.
The regulations have a broader scope than the master settlement agreement, reaching advertising, sales practices, and
members of the tobacco industry not covered by the agreement. The regulations place a variety of restrictions on
outdoor advertising, point-of-sale advertising, retail sales
transactions, transactions by mail, promotions, sampling of
products, and labels for cigars.

The cigarette and smokeless tobacco regulations being
challenged before this Court provide:

"(2) Retail Outlet Sales Practices. Except as otherwise provided in [$ 21.04(4)], it shall be an unfair or
deceptive act or practice for any person who sells or
distributes cigarettes or smokeless tobacco products
through a retail outlet located within Massachusetts
to engage in any of the following retail outlet sales
practices:. . . . .

"(c) Using self-service displays of cigarettes or smokeless tobacco products;

"(d) Failing to place cigarettes and smokeless tobacco
products out of the reach of all consumers, and
in a location accessible only to outlet personnel."

$$ 21.04(2)(c)-(d).

"(5) Advertising Restrictions. Except as provided in
[$ 21.04(6)], it shall be an unfair or deceptive act or practice for any manufacturer, distributor or retailer to engage in any of the following practices:

"(a) Outdoor advertising, including advertising in enclosed stadiums and advertising from within a retail establishment that is directed toward or visible from the

Opinion of the Court
outside of the establishment, in any location that is
within a 1,000 foot radius of any public playground, playground area in a public park, elementary school or secondary school;

"(b) Point-of-sale advertising of cigarettes or smokeless
tobacco products any portion of which is placed lower
than five feet from the floor of any retail establishment
which is located within a one thousand foot radius of
any public playground, playground area in a public park,
elementary school or secondary school, and which is not
an adult-only retail establishment." $$ 21.04(5)(a)-(b).

The cigar regulations that are still at issue provide:

"(1) Retail Sales Practices. Except as otherwise provided in [$ 22.06(4)], it shall be an unfair or deceptive act
or practice for any person who sells or distributes cigars
or little cigars directly to consumers within Massachusetts to engage in any of the following practices:

"(a) sampling of cigars or little cigars or promotional
give-aways of cigars or little cigars." $ 21.06(1)(a).

"(2) Retail Outlet Sales Practices. Except as otherwise provided in [$ 22.06(4)], it shall be an unfair or deceptive act or practice for any person who sells or distributes cigars or little cigars through a retail outlet
located within Massachusetts to engage in any of the
following retail outlet sales practices:. . . . .

"(c) Using self-service displays of cigars or little cigars;
"(d) Failing to place cigars and little cigars out of the
reach of all consumers, and in a location accessible only
to outlet personnel." $$ 22.06(2)(c)-(d).

"(5) Advertising Restrictions. Except as provided in
[$ 22.06(6)], it shall be an unfair or deceptive act or practice for any manufacturer, distributor or retailer to engage in any of the following practices:

Opinion of the Court
"(a) Outdoor advertising of cigars or little cigars, includ-ing advertising in enclosed stadiums and advertising

from within a retail establishment that is directed to-ward or visible from the outside of the establishment,
in any location within a 1,000 foot radius of any publicplayground, playground area in a public park, elementary school or secondary school;
"(b) Point-of-sale advertising of cigars or little cigarsany portion of which is placed lower than five feet from

the floor of any retail establishment which is locatedwithin a one thousand foot radius of any public playground, playground area in a public park, elementaryschool or secondary school, and which is not an adultonly retail establishment." $$ 22.06(5)(a)-(b).
The term "advertisement" is defined as:

"any oral, written, graphic, or pictorial statement orrepresentation, made by, or on behalf of, any person who

manufactures, packages, imports for sale, distributes orsells within Massachusetts [tobacco products], the purpose or effect of which is to promote the use or sale ofthe product. Advertisement includes, without limitation, any picture, logo, symbol, motto, selling message,graphic display, visual image, recognizable color or pattern of colors, or any other indicia of product identifica-tion identical or similar to, or identifiable with, those
used for any brand of [tobacco product]. This includes,without limitation, utilitarian items and permanent or
semi-permanent fixtures with such indicia of productidentification such as lighting fixtures, awnings, display
cases, clocks and door mats, but does not include utilitar-ian items with a volume of 200 cubic inches or less."

$$ 21.03, 22.03.
Before the effective date of the regulations, February 1,2000, members of the tobacco industry sued the Attorney

General in the United States District Court for the District

Opinion of the Court
of Massachusetts. Four cigarette manufacturers (Lorillard
Tobacco Company, Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation, R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, and Philip Morris Incorporated), a maker of smokeless tobacco products (U. S.
Smokeless Tobacco Company), and several cigar manufacturers and retailers claimed that many of the regulations violate
the Commerce Clause, the Supremacy Clause, the First and
Fourteenth Amendments, and Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C.

$ 1983. The parties sought summary judgment. 76 F.
Supp. 2d 124, 127 (1999); 84 F. Supp. 2d 180, 183 (2000).

In its first ruling, the District Court considered the Supremacy Clause claim that the FCLAA, 15 U. S. C. $ 1331
et seq., pre-empts the cigarette advertising regulations. 76
F. Supp. 2d, at 128-134. The FCLAA prescribes the health
warnings that must appear on packaging and in advertisements for cigarettes. The FCLAA contains a pre-emption
provision that prohibits a State from imposing any "requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health . . . with
respect to the advertising or promotion of . . . cigarettes."

$ 1334(b). The FCLAA's pre-emption provision does not
cover smokeless tobacco or cigars.

The District Court explained that the central question for
purposes of pre-emption is whether the regulations create a
predicate legal duty based on smoking and health. The
court reasoned that to read the pre-emption provision to proscribe any state advertising regulation enacted due to health
concerns about smoking would expand Congress' purpose beyond a reasonable scope and leave States powerless to regulate in the area. The court concluded that restrictions on
the location of advertising are not based on smoking and
health and thus are not pre-empted by the FCLAA. The
District Court also concluded that a provision that permitted
retailers to display a black and white "tombstone" sign reading "Tobacco Products Sold Here," 940 Code of Mass. Regs.

$ 21.04(6) (2000), was pre-empted by the FCLAA.

538 LORILLARD TOBACCO CO. v. REILLY

Opinion of the Court
In a separate ruling, the District Court considered theclaim that the Attorney General's regulations violate the

First Amendment. 84 F. Supp. 2d, at 183-196. Rejectingpetitioners' argument that strict scrutiny should apply, the
court applied the four-part test of Central Hudson Gas &
Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 557
(1980), for commercial speech. The court reasoned that the
Attorney General had provided an adequate basis for regu-lating cigars and smokeless tobacco as well as cigarettes because of the similarities among the products. The courtheld that the outdoor advertising regulations, which prohibit
outdoor advertising within 1,000 feet of a school or playground, do not violate the First Amendment because they
advance a substantial government interest and are narrowly
tailored to suppress no more speech than necessary. The
court concluded that the sales practices regulations, which
restrict the location and distribution of tobacco products,
survive scrutiny because they do not implicate a significant
speech interest. The court invalidated the point-of-sale advertising regulations, which require that indoor advertising
be placed no lower than five feet from the floor, finding that
the Attorney General had not provided sufficient justification
for that restriction. The District Court's ruling with respect to the cigar warning requirements and the Commerce
Clause is not before this Court.

The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit
issued a stay pending appeal, App. 8-9, and affirmed in part
and reversed in part the District Court's judgment, Consolidated Cigar Corp. v. Reilly, 218 F. 3d 30 (2000). With
respect to the Supremacy Clause, the Court of Appeals
affirmed the District Court's ruling that the Attorney
General's cigarette advertising regulations are not preempted by the FCLAA. The First Circuit was persuaded
by the reasoning of the Second and Seventh Circuits, which
had concluded that the FCLAA's pre-emption provision is
ambiguous, and held that the provision pre-empts regula533US2 Unit: $U84 [11-05-02 18:55:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN

539Cite as: 533 U. S. 525 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
tions of the content, but not the location, of cigarette advertising. See Greater New York Metropolitan Food Council,
Inc. v. Giuliani, 195 F. 3d 100, 104-110 (CA2 1999); Federation of Advertising Industry Representatives, Inc. v. Chicago, 189 F. 3d 633, 636-640 (CA7 1999).

With respect to the First Amendment, the Court of Appeals applied the Central Hudson test. 447 U. S. 557 (1980).
The court held that the outdoor advertising regulations do
not violate the First Amendment. The court concluded that
the restriction on outdoor advertising within 1,000 feet of a
school or playground directly advances the State's substantial interest in preventing tobacco use by minors. The court
also found that the outdoor advertising regulations restrict
no more speech than necessary, reasoning that the distance
chosen by the Attorney General is the sort of determination
better suited for legislative and executive decisionmakers
than courts. The Court of Appeals reversed the District
Court's invalidation of the point-of-sale advertising regulations, again concluding that the Attorney General is better
suited to determine what restrictions are necessary. The
Court of Appeals also held that the sales practices regulations are valid under the First Amendment. The court
found that the regulations directly advance the State's interest in preventing minors' access to tobacco products and that
the regulations are narrowly tailored because retailers have
a variety of other means to present the packaging of their
products and to allow customers to examine the products.

As for the argument that smokeless tobacco and cigars are
different from cigarettes, the court expressed some misgivings about equating all tobacco products, but ultimately decided that the Attorney General had presented sufficient evidence with respect to all three products to regulate them
similarly. The Court of Appeals' decision with respect to
the cigar warning requirements and the Commerce Clause is
not before this Court.

540 LORILLARD TOBACCO CO. v. REILLY

Opinion of the Court
The Court of Appeals stayed its mandate pending disposi-tion of a petition for a writ of certiorari. App. 13. The cigarette manufacturers and U. S. Smokeless Tobacco Companyfiled a petition, challenging the Court of Appeals' decision
with respect to the outdoor and point-of-sale advertising reg-ulations on pre-emption and First Amendment grounds, and
the sales practices regulations on First Amendment grounds.The cigar companies filed a separate petition, again raising
a First Amendment challenge to the outdoor advertising,point-of-sale advertising, and sales practices regulations.
We granted both petitions, 531 U. S. 1068 (2001), to resolvethe conflict among the Courts of Appeals with respect to
whether the FCLAA pre-empts cigarette advertising regu-lations like those at issue here, cf.

Lindsey v. Tacoma-PierceCounty Health Dept., 195 F. 3d 1065 (CA9 1999), and to decide the important First Amendment issues presented inthese cases.

II
Before reaching the First Amendment issues, we must de-cide to what extent federal law pre-empts the Attorney General's regulations. The cigarette petitioners contend thatthe FCLAA, 15 U. S. C. $ 1331

et seq., pre-empts the Attor-ney General's cigarette advertising regulations.

A
Article VI, cl. 2, of the United States Constitution com-mands that the laws of the United States "shall be the supreme Law of the Land; . . . any Thing in the Constitutionor Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding."
See also McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 427 (1819)("It is of the very essence of supremacy, to remove all obstacles to its action within its own sphere, and so to modifyevery power vested in subordinate governments"). This
relatively clear and simple mandate has generated consider-able discussion in cases where we have had to discern
whether Congress has pre-empted state action in a particu533US2 Unit: $U84 [11-05-02 18:55:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
lar area. State action may be foreclosed by express lan-guage in a congressional enactment, see, e. g., Cipollone v.

Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U. S. 504, 517 (1992), by implicationfrom the depth and breadth of a congressional scheme that
occupies the legislative field, see, e. g., Fidelity Fed. Sav. &Loan Assn. v. De la Cuesta, 458 U. S. 141, 153 (1982), or by
implication because of a conflict with a congressional enact-ment, see,

e. g., Geier v. American Honda Motor Co., 529U. S. 861, 869-874 (2000).

In the FCLAA, Congress has crafted a comprehensivefederal scheme governing the advertising and promotion of
cigarettes. The FCLAA's pre-emption provision provides:

"(a) Additional statements"No statement relating to smoking and health, other

than the statement required by section 1333 of this title,
shall be required on any cigarette package.

"(b) State regulations

"No requirement or prohibition based on smoking andhealth shall be imposed under State law with respect

to the advertising or promotion of any cigarettes thepackages of which are labeled in conformity with the
provisions of this chapter." 15 U. S. C. $ 1334.
The FCLAA's pre-emption provision does not cover smokeless tobacco or cigars.In these cases, our task is to identify the domain expressly

pre-empted, see Cipollone, supra, at 517, because "an ex-press definition of the pre-emptive reach of a statute . . .
supports a reasonable inference . . . that Congress did notintend to pre-empt other matters,"

Myrick, 514 U. S. 280, 288 (1995). Congressional purpose isthe "ultimate touchstone" of our inquiry.

Our analysis begins with the language of the statute.
Hughes Aircraft Co. v. Jacobson, 525 U. S. 432, 438 (1999).In the pre-emption provision, Congress unequivocally precludes the requirement of any additional statements on ciga-rette packages beyond those provided in $ 1333. 15 U. S. C.

$ 1334(a). Congress further precludes States or localities
from imposing any requirement or prohibition based on
smoking and health with respect to the advertising and promotion of cigarettes. $ 1334(b). Without question, the second clause is more expansive than the first; it employs far
more sweeping language to describe the state action that is
pre-empted. We must give meaning to each element of the
pre-emption provision. We are aided in our interpretation
by considering the predecessor pre-emption provision and
the circumstances in which the current language was
adopted. See Medtronic, supra, at 486; McCarthy v. Bronson, 500 U. S. 136, 139 (1991); K mart Corp. v. Cartier, Inc.,
486 U. S. 281, 291 (1988).

In 1964, the groundbreaking Report of the Surgeon General's Advisory Committee on Smoking and Health concluded
that "[c]igarette smoking is a health hazard of sufficient importance in the United States to warrant appropriate remedial action." Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, U. S. Surgeon General's Advisory Committee, Smoking
and Health 33. In 1965, Congress enacted the FCLAA as a
proactive measure in the face of impending regulation by
federal agencies and the States. Pub. L. 89-92, 79 Stat. 282.
See also Cipollone, supra, at 513-515. The purpose of the
FCLAA was twofold: to inform the public adequately about
the hazards of cigarette smoking, and to protect the national

economy from interference due to diverse, nonuniform, andconfusing cigarette labeling and advertising regulations with

respect to the relationship between smoking and health.Pub. L. 89-92, $ 2. The FCLAA prescribed a label for cigarette packages: "Caution: Cigarette Smoking May Be Haz-ardous to Your Health." $ 4. The FCLAA also required
the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) and
the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to report annually toCongress about the health consequences of smoking and the

advertising and promotion of cigarettes. $ 5.Section 5 of the FCLAA included a pre-emption provision
in which "Congress spoke precisely and narrowly." Cipollone, supra, at 518. Subsection (a) prohibited any requirement of additional statements on cigarette packaging. Subsection (b) provided that "[n]o statement relating to smoking
and health shall be required in the advertising of any cigarettes the packages of which are labeled in conformity with
the provisions of this Act." Section 10 of the FCLAA set a
termination date of July 1, 1969, for these provisions. As
we have previously explained, "on their face, [the preemption] provisions merely prohibited state and federal
rulemaking bodies from mandating particular cautionary
statements on cigarette labels [subsection (a)] or in cigarette advertisements [subsection (b)]." Cipollone, supra, at
518.

The FCLAA was enacted with the expectation that Congress would reexamine it in 1969 in light of the developing
information about cigarette smoking and health. H. R. Rep.
No. 586, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., 6 (1965); 111 Cong. Rec. 16541
(1965). In the intervening years, Congress received reports
and recommendations from the HEW Secretary and the
FTC. S. Rep. No. 91-566, pp. 2-6 (1969). The HEW Secretary recommended that Congress strengthen the warning,
require the warning on all packages and in advertisements,
and publish tar and nicotine levels on packages and in advertisements. Id., at 4. The FTC made similar and additional

Opinion of the Court
recommendations. The FTC sought a complete ban on radioand television advertising, a requirement that broadcasters

devote time for health hazard announcements concerningsmoking, and increased funding for public education and research about smoking. Id., at 6. The FTC urged Congressnot to continue to prevent federal agencies from regulating
cigarette advertising. Id., at 10. In addition, the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) had concluded that ad-vertising which promoted the use of cigarettes created a

duty in broadcast stations to provide information about thehazards of cigarette smoking.

Id., at 6-7.
In 1969, House and Senate committees held hearingsabout the health effects of cigarette smoking and advertising by the cigarette industry. The bill that emerged fromthe House of Representatives strengthened the warning
and maintained the pre-emption provision. The Senateamended that bill, adding the ban on radio and television
advertising, and changing the pre-emption language to itspresent form. H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 91-897, pp. 4-5 (1970).

The final result was the Public Health Cigarette Smoking
Act of 1969, in which Congress, following the Senate'samendments, made three significant changes to the FCLAA.

Pub. L. 91-222, $ 2, 84 Stat. 87. First, Congress drafted a
new label that read: "Warning: The Surgeon General Has
Determined That Cigarette Smoking Is Dangerous to Your
Health." FCLAA, $ 4. Second, Congress declared it unlawful to advertise cigarettes on any medium of electronic
communication subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC. $ 6.
Finally, Congress enacted the current pre-emption provision,
which proscribes any "requirement or prohibition based on
smoking and health . . . imposed under State law with respect to the advertising or promotion" of cigarettes. $ 5(b).
The new subsection (b) did not pre-empt regulation by federal agencies, freeing the FTC to impose warning requirements in cigarette advertising. See Cipollone, 505 U. S., at
515. The new pre-emption provision, like its predecessor,
only applied to cigarettes, and not other tobacco products.

Opinion of the Court
In 1984, Congress again amended the FCLAA in the Com-prehensive Smoking Education Act. Pub. L. 98-474, 98

Stat. 2200. The purpose of the Act was to "provide a newstrategy for making Americans more aware of any adverse
health effects of smoking, to assure the timely and wide-spread dissemination of research findings and to enable individuals to make informed decisions about smoking." $ 2.
The Act established a series of warnings to appear on a ro-tating basis on cigarette packages and in cigarette advertising, $ 4, and directed the Health and Human Services Secre-tary to create and implement an educational program about
the health effects of cigarette smoking, $ 3.The FTC has continued to report on trade practices in the
cigarette industry. In 1999, the first year since the mastersettlement agreement, the FTC reported that the cigarette
industry expended $8.24 billion on advertising and promo-tions, the largest expenditure ever. FTC, Cigarette Report
for 1999, p. 1 (2000). Substantial increases were found inpoint-of-sale promotions, payments made to retailers to facilitate sales, and retail offers such as buy one, get one free,
or product giveaways. Id., at 4-5. Substantial decreases,however, were reported for outdoor advertising and transit

advertising. Id., at 2. Congress and federal agencies continue to monitor advertising and promotion practices in the
cigarette industry.

The scope and meaning of the current pre-emption provision become clearer once we consider the original preemption language and the amendments to the FCLAA.
Without question, "the plain language of the pre-emption
provision in the 1969 Act is much broader." Cipollone, 505
U. S., at 520. Rather than preventing only "statements,"
the amended provision reaches all "requirement[s] or
prohibition[s] . . . imposed under State law." And, although
the former statute reached only statements "in the advertising," the current provision governs "with respect to the advertising or promotion" of cigarettes. See ibid. Congress
expanded the pre-emption provision with respect to the

Opinion of the Court
States, and at the same time, it allowed the FTC to regulatecigarette advertising. Congress also prohibited cigarette

advertising in electronic media altogether. Viewed in lightof the context in which the current pre-emption provision
was adopted, we must determine whether the FCLAA pre-empts Massachusetts' regulations governing outdoor and
point-of-sale advertising of cigarettes.

B
The Court of Appeals acknowledged that the FCLAApre-empts any "requirement or prohibition based on smoking

and health . . . with respect to the advertising or promotionof . . . cigarettes," 15 U. S. C. $ 1334(b), but concluded that
the FCLAA does not nullify Massachusetts' cigarette adver-tising regulations. The court concentrated its analysis on
whether the regulations are "with respect to" advertisingand promotion, relying on two of its sister Circuits to conclude that the FCLAA only pre-empts regulations of thecontent of cigarette advertising. The Court of Appeals also
reasoned that the Attorney General's regulations are a formof zoning, a traditional area of state power; therefore the
presumption against pre-emption applied.The cigarette petitioners maintain that the Court of Appeals' "with respect to" analysis is inconsistent with theFCLAA's statutory text and legislative history, and gives
the States license to prohibit almost all cigarette advertising.Petitioners also maintain that there is no basis for construing
the pre-emption provision to prohibit only content-based ad-vertising regulations.

Although they support the Court of Appeals' result, theAttorney General and United States as

amicus curiae do notfully endorse that court's textual analysis of the pre-emption

provision. Instead, they assert that the cigarette advertis-ing regulations are not pre-empted because they are not
"based on smoking and health." The Attorney General and

533US2 Unit: $U84 [11-05-02 18:55:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN

547Cite as: 533 U. S. 525 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
the United States also contend that the regulations are not
pre-empted because they do not prescribe the content of cigarette advertising and they fall squarely within the State's
traditional powers to control the location of advertising and
to protect the welfare of children.

Turning first to the language in the pre-emption provision
relied upon by the Court of Appeals, we reject the notion
that the Attorney General's cigarette advertising regulations
are not "with respect to" advertising and promotion. We
disagree with the Court of Appeals' analogy to the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). In some
cases concerning ERISA's pre-emption of state law, the
Court has had to decide whether a particular state law "relates to" an employee benefit plan covered by ERISA even
though the state law makes no express reference to such a
plan. See, e. g., California Div. of Labor Standards Enforcement v. Dillingham Constr., N. A., Inc., 519 U. S., at
324-325. Here, however, there is no question about an indirect relationship between the regulations and cigarette advertising because the regulations expressly target cigarette
advertising. 940 Code of Mass. Regs. $ 21.04(5) (2000).

Before this Court, the Attorney General focuses on a different phrase in the pre-emption provision: "based on smoking and health." The Attorney General argues that the cigarette advertising regulations are not "based on smoking
and health," because they do not involve health-related content in cigarette advertising but instead target youth exposure to cigarette advertising. To be sure, Members of this
Court have debated the precise meaning of "based on smoking and health," see Cipollone, supra, at 529, n. 7 (plurality
opinion), but we cannot agree with the Attorney General's
narrow construction of the phrase.

As Congress enacted the current pre-emption provision,
Congress did not concern itself solely with health warnings
for cigarettes. In the 1969 amendments, Congress not only

548 LORILLARD TOBACCO CO. v. REILLY

Opinion of the Court
enhanced its scheme to warn the public about the hazardsof cigarette smoking, but also sought to protect the public,

including youth, from being inundated with images of ciga-rette smoking in advertising. In pursuit of the latter goal,
Congress banned electronic media advertising of cigarettes.And to the extent that Congress contemplated additional
targeted regulation of cigarette advertising, it vested that
authority in the FTC.The context in which Congress crafted the current preemption provision leads us to conclude that Congress prohib-ited state cigarette advertising regulations motivated by
concerns about smoking and health. Massachusetts has
attempted to address the incidence of underage cigarette
smoking by regulating advertising, see 940 Code of Mass.
Regs. $ 21.01 (2000), much like Congress' ban on cigarette
advertising in electronic media. At bottom, the concern
about youth exposure to cigarette advertising is intertwined
with the concern about cigarette smoking and health. Thus
the Attorney General's attempt to distinguish one concern
from the other must be rejected.

The Attorney General next claims that the State's outdoor
and point-of-sale advertising regulations for cigarettes are
not pre-empted because they govern the location, and not
the content, of advertising. This is also Justice Stevens'
main point with respect to pre-emption. Post, at 595 (opinion concurring in part, concurring in judgment in part, and
dissenting in part).

The content versus location distinction has some surface
appeal. The pre-emption provision immediately follows the
section of the FCLAA that prescribes warnings. See 15
U. S. C. $$ 1333, 1334. The pre-emption provision itself refers to cigarettes "labeled in conformity with" the statute.

$ 1334(b). But the content/ location distinction cannot be
squared with the language of the pre-emption provision,
which reaches all "requirements" and "prohibitions" "imposed under State law." A distinction between the content

549Cite as: 533 U. S. 525 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
of advertising and the location of advertising in the FCLAAalso cannot be reconciled with Congress' own location-based

restriction, which bans advertising in electronic media, butnot elsewhere. See $ 1335. We are not at liberty to pick
and choose which provisions in the legislative scheme we willconsider, see

post, at 596, n. 5 (opinion of Stevens, J.), but
must examine the FCLAA as a whole.

Moreover, any distinction between the content and loca-tion of cigarette advertising collapses once the implications

of that approach are fully considered. At oral argument, theAttorney General was pressed to explain what types of state
regulations of cigarette advertising, in his view, are preempted by the FCLAA. The Attorney General maintained
that a state law that required cigarette retailers to remove
the word "tobacco" from advertisements, or required cigarette billboards to be blank, would be pre-empted if it were
a regulation of "health-related content." Tr. of Oral Arg. 41,
42. The Attorney General also maintained, however, that a
complete ban on all cigarette advertising would not be preempted because Congress did not intend to invade local control over zoning. Id., at 42-44. The latter position clearly
follows from the factual distinction between content and location, but it finds no support in the text of the FCLAA's
pre-emption provision. We believe that Congress wished to
ensure that "a State could not do through negative mandate
(e. g., banning all cigarette advertising) that which it already
was forbidden to do through positive mandate (e. g., mandating particular cautionary statements)." Cipollone, 505
U. S., at 539 (Blackmun, J., joined by Kennedy and Souter,
JJ., concurring in part and dissenting in part). See also
Vango Media, Inc. v. New York, 34 F. 3d 68 (CA2 1994) (holding pre-empted a regulation that required one public health
message for every four cigarette advertisements).

Justice Stevens, post, at 595-598, maintains that Congress did not intend to displace state regulation of the location of cigarette advertising. There is a critical distinction,

533US2 Unit: $U84 [11-05-02 18:55:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN
550 LORILLARD TOBACCO CO. v. REILLY

Opinion of the Court
however, between generally applicable zoning regulations,see

infra, at 551-552, and regulations targeting cigarette
advertising. The latter type of regulation, which is inev-itably motivated by concerns about smoking and health,

squarely contradicts the FCLAA. The FCLAA's compre-hensive warnings, advertising restrictions, and pre-emption
provision would make little sense if a State or locality could
simply target and ban all cigarette advertising.

Justice Stevens finds it ironic that we conclude that
"federal law precludes States and localities from protectingchildren from dangerous products within 1,000 feet of a

school," in light of our prior conclusion that the "Federal
Government lacks the constitutional authority to impose a
similarly motivated ban" in United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S.
549 (1995). Post, at 598-599, n. 8. Our holding is not as
broad as Justice Stevens states; we hold only that the
FCLAA pre-empts state regulations targeting cigarette advertising. States remain free to enact generally applicable
zoning regulations, and to regulate conduct with respect to
cigarette use and sales. Infra, at 552. The reference to
Lopez is also inapposite. In Lopez, we held that Congress
exceeded the limits of its Commerce Clause power in the
Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990, which made it a federal
crime to possess a firearm in a school zone. 514 U. S., at
553-568. These cases, by contrast, concern the Supremacy
Clause and the doctrine of pre-emption as applied in a case
where Congress expressly precluded certain state regulations of cigarette advertising. Massachusetts did not raise
a constitutional challenge to the FCLAA, and we are not
confronted with whether Congress exceeded its constitutionally delegated authority in enacting the FCLAA.

In sum, we fail to see how the FCLAA and its pre-emption
provision permit a distinction between the specific concern
about minors and cigarette advertising and the more general
concern about smoking and health in cigarette advertising,
especially in light of the fact that Congress crafted a legisla533US2 Unit: $U84 [11-05-02 18:55:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN

551Cite as: 533 U. S. 525 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
tive solution for those very concerns. We also conclude thata distinction between state regulation of the location as opposed to the content of cigarette advertising has no founda-tion in the text of the pre-emption provision. Congress
pre-empted state cigarette advertising regulations like theAttorney General's because they would upset federal legislative choices to require specific warnings and to impose theban on cigarette advertising in electronic media in order to
address concerns about smoking and health. Accordingly,we hold that the Attorney General's outdoor and point-ofsale advertising regulations targeting cigarettes are pre-empted by the FCLAA.

C
Although the FCLAA prevents States and localities fromimposing special requirements or prohibitions "based on

smoking and health" "with respect to the advertising or pro-motion" of cigarettes, that language still leaves significant
power in the hands of States to impose generally applicablezoning regulations and to regulate conduct. As we noted
in Cipollone, "each phrase within [the provision] limits theuniverse of [state action] pre-empted by the statute." 505
U. S., at 524 (plurality opinion).For instance, the FCLAA does not restrict a State or locality's ability to enact generally applicable zoning restric-tions. We have recognized that state interests in traffic
safety and esthetics may justify zoning regulations for adver-tising. See

Metromedia, Inc. v. San Diego, 453 U. S. 490,507-508 (1981). See also St. Louis Poster Advertising Co.

v. St. Louis, 249 U. S. 269, 274 (1919); Thomas Cusack Co. v.Chicago, 242 U. S. 526, 529-531 (1917). Although Congress
has taken into account the unique concerns about cigarettesmoking and health in advertising, there is no indication that
Congress intended to displace local community interests ingeneral regulations of the location of billboards or large marquee advertising, or that Congress intended cigarette adver-tisers to be afforded special treatment in that regard. Re533US2 Unit: $U84 [11-05-02 18:55:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN
552 LORILLARD TOBACCO CO. v. REILLY

Opinion of the Court
strictions on the location and size of advertisements thatapply to cigarettes on equal terms with other products appear to be outside the ambit of the pre-emption provision.Such restrictions are not "based on smoking and health."

The FCLAA also does not foreclose all state regulation ofconduct as it relates to the sale or use of cigarettes. The
FCLAA's pre-emption provision explicitly governs state reg-ulations of "advertising or promotion." * Accordingly, the
FCLAA does not pre-empt state laws prohibiting cigarettesales to minors. To the contrary, there is an established
congressional policy that supports such laws; Congress has
required States to prohibit tobacco sales to minors as a con-dition of receiving federal block grant funding for substance

abuse treatment activities. 106 Stat. 394, 388, 42 U. S. C.$$ 300x-26(a)(1), 300x-21.

In Massachusetts, it is illegal to sell or distribute tobaccoproducts to persons under the age of 18. Mass. Gen. Laws,
ch. 270, $ 6 (2000). Having prohibited the sale and distribu-tion of tobacco products to minors, the State may prohibit
common inchoate offenses that attach to criminal conduct,
such as solicitation, conspiracy, and attempt. Cf. Central
Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of New
York, 447 U. S., at 563-564; Carey v. Population Servs. Int'l,431 U. S. 678, 701 (1977);

Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U. S. 748, 772(1976); 60 Fed. Reg. 41330-41332 (1995) (citing evidence that

industry may be attempting to induce individuals under 18to smoke cigarettes). States and localities also have at their
disposal other means of regulating conduct to ensure thatminors do not obtain cigarettes. See Part III-D,

infra.

*The Senate Report explained that the pre-emption provision "would in
no way affect the power of any State or political subdivision of any State
with respect to the taxation or the sale of cigarettes to minors, or the
prohibition of smoking in public buildings, or similar police regulations.
It is limited entirely to State or local requirements or prohibitions in the
advertising of cigarettes." S. Rep. No. 91-566, p. 12 (1969).

Opinion of the Court

D
The smokeless tobacco petitioners argue that if the State'soutdoor and point-of-sale advertising regulations for cigarettes are pre-empted, then the same advertising regulationswith respect to smokeless tobacco must be invalidated because they cannot be severed from the cigarette provisions.Brief for Petitioner U. S. Smokeless Tobacco Co. in Nos. 00-
596 and 00-597, p. 4, n. 5. The District Court did not reachthe severability issue with respect to the advertising provisions that are before this Court. 76 F. Supp. 2d, at 134,n. 11. The Court of Appeals also did not reach severability
because that court likewise concluded that the cigarette ad-vertising regulations were not pre-empted. 218 F. 3d, at 37,
n. 3. We decline to reach an issue that was not decidedbelow. National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v. Smith, 525
U. S. 459, 470 (1999). III

By its terms, the FCLAA's pre-emption provision onlyapplies to cigarettes. Accordingly, we must evaluate the
smokeless tobacco and cigar petitioners' First Amendmentchallenges to the State's outdoor and point-of-sale advertising regulations. The cigarette petitioners did not raise apre-emption challenge to the sales practices regulations.
Thus, we must analyze the cigarette as well as the smoke-less tobacco and cigar petitioners' claim that certain sales
practices regulations for tobacco products violate the FirstAmendment.

A
For over 25 years, the Court has recognized that commercial speech does not fall outside the purview of the FirstAmendment. See,

e. g., Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy, supra,
at 762. Instead, the Court has afforded commercial speecha measure of First Amendment protection " `commensurate' "

with its position in relation to other constitutionally guaranteed expression. See, e. g., Florida Bar v. Went For It, Inc.,

554 LORILLARD TOBACCO CO. v. REILLY

Opinion of the Court
515 U. S. 618, 623 (1995) (quoting Board of Trustees of State
Univ. of N. Y. v. Fox, 492 U. S. 469, 477 (1989)). In recognition of the "distinction between speech proposing a commer-cial transaction, which occurs in an area traditionally subject

to government regulation, and other varieties of speech,"
Central Hudson, supra, at 562 (internal quotation marks
omitted), we developed a framework for analyzing regulations of commercial speech that is "substantially similar" tothe test for time, place, and manner restrictions,

Board of
Trustees of State Univ. of N. Y. v. Fox, supra, at 477. Theanalysis contains four elements:

"At the outset, we must determine whether the expression is protected by the First Amendment. For commercial speech to come within that provision, it at leastmust concern lawful activity and not be misleading.

Next, we ask whether the asserted governmental inter-est is substantial. If both inquiries yield positive answers, we must determine whether the regulation di-rectly advances the governmental interest asserted, and
whether it is not more extensive than is necessary toserve that interest."

Central Hudson, supra, at 566.

Petitioners urge us to reject the Central Hudson analysisand apply strict scrutiny. They are not the first litigants to

do so. See, e. g., Greater New Orleans Broadcasting Assn.,
Inc. v. United States, 527 U. S. 173, 184 (1999). Admittedly,
several Members of the Court have expressed doubts aboutthe

Central Hudson analysis and whether it should apply in
particular cases. See, e. g., Greater New Orleans, supra, at197 (

Thomas, J., concurring in judgment); 44 Liquormart,
Inc. v. Rhode Island, 517 U. S. 484, 501, 510-514 (1996) ( joint
opinion of Stevens, Kennedy, and Ginsburg, JJ.); id., at
517 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); id., at 518 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). But here, as in Greater New Orleans,
we see "no need to break new ground. Central Hudson, as

533US2 Unit: $U84 [11-05-02 18:55:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN

555Cite as: 533 U. S. 525 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
applied in our more recent commercial speech cases, providesan adequate basis for decision." 527 U. S., at 184.

Only the last two steps of Central Hudson's four-part anal-ysis are at issue here. The Attorney General has assumed
for purposes of summary judgment that petitioners' speechis entitled to First Amendment protection. 218 F. 3d, at 43;
84 F. Supp. 2d, at 185-186. With respect to the second step,
none of the petitioners contests the importance of the State'sinterest in preventing the use of tobacco products by minors. Brief for Petitioners Lorillard Tobacco Co. et al. inNo. 00-596, p. 41; Brief for Petitioner U. S. Smokeless Tobacco Co. in Nos. 00-596 and 00-597, at 16; Brief for Petition-ers Altadis U. S. A. Inc. et al. in No. 00-597, p. 8.

The third step of Central Hudson concerns the relation-ship between the harm that underlies the State's interest
and the means identified by the State to advance that inter-est. It requires that

"the speech restriction directly and materially advanc[e]the asserted governmental interest. `This burden is
not satisfied by mere speculation or conjecture; rather,a governmental body seeking to sustain a restriction on
commercial speech must demonstrate that the harms itrecites are real and that its restriction will in fact alleviate them to a material degree.' " Greater New Orleans,
supra, at 188 (quoting Edenfield v. Fane, 507 U. S. 761,770-771 (1993)).

We do not, however, require that "empirical data come . . .
accompanied by a surfeit of background information. . . . [W]ehave permitted litigants to justify speech restrictions by

reference to studies and anecdotes pertaining to different
locales altogether, or even, in a case applying strict scrutiny, to justify restrictions based solely on history, consensus,
and `simple common sense.' " Florida Bar v. Went For It,
Inc., supra, at 628 (citations and internal quotation marks

556 LORILLARD TOBACCO CO. v. REILLY

Opinion of the Court
The last step of the Central Hudson analysis "comple-ments" the third step, "asking whether the speech restriction is not more extensive than necessary to serve the inter-ests that support it." Greater New Orleans, supra, at 188.
We have made it clear that "the least restrictive means" isnot the standard; instead, the case law requires a reasonable
" `fit between the legislature's ends and the means chosen toaccomplish those ends, . . . a means narrowly tailored to
achieve the desired objective.' " Went For It, Inc., supra, at632 (quoting

Board of Trustees of State Univ. of N. Y. v. Fox,supra, at 480). Focusing on the third and fourth steps of

the Central Hudson analysis, we first address the outdooradvertising and point-of-sale advertising regulations for
smokeless tobacco and cigars. We then address the salespractices regulations for all tobacco products.

B
The outdoor advertising regulations prohibit smokelesstobacco or cigar advertising within a 1,000-foot radius

of a school or playground. 940 Code of Mass. Regs.$$ 21.04(5)(a), 22.06(5)(a) (2000). The District Court and
Court of Appeals concluded that the Attorney General hadidentified a real problem with underage use of tobacco products, that limiting youth exposure to advertising would com-bat that problem, and that the regulations burdened no more
speech than necessary to accomplish the State's goal. 218F. 3d, at 44-53; 84 F. Supp. 2d, at 186-193. The smokeless
tobacco and cigar petitioners take issue with all of theseconclusions.

The smokeless tobacco and cigar petitioners contend thatthe Attorney General's regulations do not satisfy Central

Hudson's third step. They maintain that although the At-torney General may have identified a problem with underage
cigarette smoking, he has not identified an equally severeproblem with respect to underage use of smokeless tobacco

In previous cases, we have acknowledged the theory that
product advertising stimulates demand for products, while
suppressed advertising may have the opposite effect. See
Rubin, 514 U. S., at 487; United States v. Edge Broadcasting
Co., 509 U. S. 418, 434 (1993); Central Hudson, 447 U. S., at
568-569. The Attorney General cites numerous studies to
support this theory in the case of tobacco products.

The Attorney General relies in part on evidence gathered
by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in its attempt
to regulate the advertising of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. See Regulations Restricting the Sale and Distribution of Cigarettes and Smokeless Tobacco Products to Protect Children and Adolescents, FDA Proposed Rule, 60 Fed.
Reg. 41314 (1995); Regulations Restricting the Sale and Distribution of Cigarettes and Smokeless Tobacco to Protect
Children and Adolescents, FDA Final Rule, 61 Fed. Reg.
44396 (1996). The FDA promulgated the advertising regulations after finding that the period prior to adulthood is
when an overwhelming majority of Americans first decide to
use tobacco products, and that advertising plays a crucial

role in that decision. Id., at 44398-44399. We later heldthat the FDA lacks statutory authority to regulate tobacco

products. See FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp.,529 U. S. 120 (2000). Nevertheless, the Attorney General
relies on the FDA's proceedings and other studies to supporthis decision that advertising affects demand for tobacco
products. Cf. Erie v. Pap's A. M., 529 U. S. 277, 296 (2000)
(plurality opinion) (cities and localities may rely on evidencefrom other jurisdictions to demonstrate harmful secondary

effects of adult entertainment and to justify regulation);
Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U. S. 560, 583-584 (1991)
(Souter, J., concurring in judgment) (same); Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U. S. 41, 50-52 (1986) (same). See
also Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U. S.
377, 393, and n. 6 (2000) (discussing evidence of corruption
and the appearance of corruption in campaign finance).

In its rulemaking proceeding, the FDA considered several
studies of tobacco advertising and trends in the use of various tobacco products. The Surgeon General's report and
the Institute of Medicine's report found that "there is sufficient evidence to conclude that advertising and labeling play
a significant and important contributory role in a young person's decision to use cigarettes or smokeless tobacco products." 60 Fed. Reg. 41332. See also Pierce et al., Tobacco
Industry Promotion of Cigarettes and Adolescent Smoking,
279 JAMA 511, 514 (1998).

For instance, children smoke fewer brands of cigarettes
than adults, and those choices directly track the most heavily
advertised brands, unlike adult choices, which are more dispersed and related to pricing. FDA Proposed Rule, 60 Fed.
Reg. 41332. Another study revealed that 72% of 6 year olds
and 52% of children ages 3 to 6 recognized "Joe Camel," the
cartoon anthropomorphic symbol of R. J. Reynolds' Camel
brand cigarettes. Id., at 41333. After the introduction of
Joe Camel, Camel cigarettes' share of the youth market rose
from 4% to 13%. Id., at 41330. The FDA also identified

Opinion of the Court
trends in tobacco consumption among certain populations,such as young women, that correlated to the introduction and

marketing of products geared toward that population. Id.,at 41333.

The FDA also made specific findings with respect tosmokeless tobacco. The FDA concluded that "[t]he recent
and very large increase in the use of smokeless tobacco products by young people and the addictive nature of these prod-ucts has persuaded the agency that these products must be

included in any regulatory approach that is designed to helpprevent future generations of young people from becoming
addicted to nicotine-containing tobacco products." Id., at
41318. Studies have analyzed smokeless tobacco use by
young people, discussing trends based on gender, school
grade, and locale. See, e. g., Boyd et al., Use of Smokeless
Tobacco among Children and Adolescents in the United
States, 16 Preventative Medicine 402-418 (1987), Record,
Doc. No. 38, Exh. 63.

Researchers tracked a dramatic shift in patterns of smokeless tobacco use from older to younger users over the past
30 years. See, e. g., FDA Proposed Rule, 60 Fed. Reg.
41317; Tomar, Giovano, & Erickson, Smokeless tobacco brand
preference and brand switching among US adolescents and
young adults, 4 Tobacco Control 67 (1995), Record, Doc.

Opinion of the Court
Monograph No. 8, pp. 87-93 (1989), Record, Doc. No. 38,Exh. 66.

The Attorney General presents different evidence with re-spect to cigars. There was no data on underage cigar use
prior to 1996 because the behavior was considered "uncom-mon enough not to be worthy of examination." Smoking
and Tobacco Control Monograph No. 9, at 13; FTC Report
to Congress: Cigar Sales and Advertising and PromotionalExpenses for Calendar Years 1996 and 1997, p. 9 (1999), Record, Doc. No. 39, Exh. 71. In 1995, the FDA decided not toinclude cigars in its attempted regulation of tobacco product
advertising, explaining that "the agency does not currently
have sufficient evidence that these products are drug delivery devices . . . . FDA has focused its investigation of its
authority over tobacco products on cigarettes and smokeless
tobacco products, and not on pipe tobacco or cigars, because
young people predominantly use cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products." 60 Fed. Reg. 41322.

More recently, however, data on youth cigar use has
emerged. The National Cancer Institute concluded in its
1998 Monograph that the rate of cigar use by minors is increasing and that, in some States, the cigar use rates are
higher than the smokeless tobacco use rates for minors.
Smoking and Tobacco Control Monograph No. 9, at 19, 42-51.
In its 1999 Report to Congress, the FTC concluded that "substantial numbers of adolescents are trying cigars." FTC
Report to Congress, at 9. See also Department of Health
and Human Services, Office of Inspector General, Youth Use
of Cigars: Patterns of Use and Perceptions of Risk (1999),
Record, Doc. No. 39, Exh. 78.

Studies have also demonstrated a link between advertising
and demand for cigars. After Congress recognized the
power of images in advertising and banned cigarette advertising in electronic media, television advertising of small cigars "increased dramatically in 1972 and 1973," "filled the
void left by cigarette advertisers," and "sales . . . soared."

Smoking and Tobacco Control Monograph No. 9, at 24. In1973, Congress extended the electronic media advertising

ban for cigarettes to little cigars. Little Cigar Act, Pub. L.93-109, $ 3, 87 Stat. 352, as amended, 15 U. S. C. $ 1335. In
the 1990's, cigar advertising campaigns triggered a boost insales. Smoking and Tobacco Control Monograph No. 9, at
215.Our review of the record reveals that the Attorney General has provided ample documentation of the problem withunderage use of smokeless tobacco and cigars. In addition,
we disagree with petitioners' claim that there is no evidencethat preventing targeted campaigns and limiting youth exposure to advertising will decrease underage use of smokelesstobacco and cigars. On this record and in the posture of
summary judgment, we are unable to conclude that the At-torney General's decision to regulate advertising of smokeless tobacco and cigars in an effort to combat the use of to-bacco products by minors was based on mere "speculation
[and] conjecture." Edenfield v. Fane, 507 U. S., at 770.

2
Whatever the strength of the Attorney General's evidenceto justify the outdoor advertising regulations, however, we

conclude that the regulations do not satisfy the fourth step ofthe

Central Hudson analysis. The final step of the CentralHudson analysis, the "critical inquiry in this case," requires

a reasonable fit between the means and ends of the regula-tory scheme. 447 U. S., at 569. The Attorney General's
regulations do not meet this standard. The broad sweep ofthe regulations indicates that the Attorney General did not
"carefully calculat[e] the costs and benefits associated withthe burden on speech imposed" by the regulations. Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, Inc., 507 U. S. 410, 417 (1993)(internal quotation marks omitted).

The outdoor advertising regulations prohibit any smoke-less tobacco or cigar advertising within 1,000 feet of schools

Opinion of the Court
or playgrounds. In the District Court, petitioners main-tained that this prohibition would prevent advertising in

87% to 91% of Boston, Worcester, and Springfield, Massachu-setts. 84 F. Supp. 2d, at 191. The 87% to 91% figure appears to include not only the effect of the regulations, butalso the limitations imposed by other generally applicable
zoning restrictions. See App. 161-167. The Attorney General disputed petitioners' figures but "concede[d] that thereach of the regulations is substantial." 218 F. 3d, at 50.

Thus, the Court of Appeals concluded that the regulationsprohibit advertising in a substantial portion of the major
metropolitan areas of Massachusetts. Ibid.

The substantial geographical reach of the Attorney General's outdoor advertising regulations is compounded by other
factors. "Outdoor" advertising includes not only advertising located outside an establishment, but also advertising inside a store if that advertising is visible from outside the
store. The regulations restrict advertisements of any size
and the term advertisement also includes oral statements.
940 Code of Mass. Regs. $$ 21.03, 22.03 (2000).

In some geographical areas, these regulations would constitute nearly a complete ban on the communication of truthful information about smokeless tobacco and cigars to adult
consumers. The breadth and scope of the regulations, and
the process by which the Attorney General adopted the regulations, do not demonstrate a careful calculation of the
speech interests involved.

First, the Attorney General did not seem to consider the
impact of the 1,000-foot restriction on commercial speech in
major metropolitan areas. The Attorney General apparently selected the 1,000-foot distance based on the FDA's decision to impose an identical 1,000-foot restriction when it
attempted to regulate cigarette and smokeless tobacco advertising. See FDA Final Rule, 61 Fed. Reg. 44399; Brief
for Respondents 45, and n. 23. But the FDA's 1,000-foot
regulation was not an adequate basis for the Attorney Gen533US2 Unit: $U84 [11-05-02 18:55:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN

563Cite as: 533 U. S. 525 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
eral to tailor the Massachusetts regulations. The degree to
which speech is suppressed--or alternative avenues for
speech remain available--under a particular regulatory
scheme tends to be case specific. See, e. g., Renton, 475
U. S., at 53-54. And a case specific analysis makes sense,
for although a State or locality may have common interests
and concerns about underage smoking and the effects of tobacco advertisements, the impact of a restriction on speech
will undoubtedly vary from place to place. The FDA's regulations would have had widely disparate effects nationwide.
Even in Massachusetts, the effect of the Attorney General's
speech regulations will vary based on whether a locale is
rural, suburban, or urban. The uniformly broad sweep of
the geographical limitation demonstrates a lack of tailoring.

In addition, the range of communications restricted seems
unduly broad. For instance, it is not clear from the regulatory scheme why a ban on oral communications is necessary
to further the State's interest. Apparently that restriction
means that a retailer is unable to answer inquiries about its
tobacco products if that communication occurs outdoors.
Similarly, a ban on all signs of any size seems ill suited to
target the problem of highly visible billboards, as opposed
to smaller signs. To the extent that studies have identified
particular advertising and promotion practices that appeal
to youth, tailoring would involve targeting those practices
while permitting others. As crafted, the regulations make
no distinction among practices on this basis.

The Court of Appeals recognized that the smokeless tobacco and cigar petitioners' concern about the amount of
speech restricted was "valid," but reasoned that there was
an "obvious connection to the state's interest in protecting
minors." 218 F. 3d, at 50. Even on the premise that Massachusetts has demonstrated a connection between the outdoor
advertising regulations and its substantial interest in preventing underage tobacco use, the question of tailoring re533US2 Unit: $U84 [11-05-02 18:55:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN
564 LORILLARD TOBACCO CO. v. REILLY

Opinion of the Court
mains. The Court of Appeals failed to follow through withan analysis of the countervailing First Amendment interests.

The State's interest in preventing underage tobacco use issubstantial, and even compelling, but it is no less true that
the sale and use of tobacco products by adults is a legal activ-ity. We must consider that tobacco retailers and manufacturers have an interest in conveying truthful information
about their products to adults, and adults have a correspond-ing interest in receiving truthful information about tobacco

products. In a case involving indecent speech on the In-ternet we explained that "the governmental interest in protecting children from harmful materials . . . does not justify
an unnecessarily broad suppression of speech addressed to
adults." Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U. S.
844, 875 (1997) (citations omitted). See, e. g., Bolger v.
Youngs Drug Products Corp., 463 U. S. 60, 74 (1983) ("The
level of discourse reaching a mailbox simply cannot be limited to that which would be suitable for a sandbox"); Butler
v. Michigan, 352 U. S. 380, 383 (1957) ("The incidence of this
enactment is to reduce the adult population . . . to reading
only what is fit for children"). As the State protects children from tobacco advertisements, tobacco manufacturers
and retailers and their adult consumers still have a protected
interest in communication. Cf. American Civil Liberties
Union, supra, at 886-889 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (discussing the creation
of "adult zones" on the Internet).

In some instances, Massachusetts' outdoor advertising
regulations would impose particularly onerous burdens on
speech. For example, we disagree with the Court of Appeals' conclusion that because cigar manufacturers and retailers conduct a limited amount of advertising in comparison
to other tobacco products, "the relative lack of cigar advertising also means that the burden imposed on cigar advertisers is correspondingly small." 218 F. 3d, at 49. If some
retailers have relatively small advertising budgets, and use

565Cite as: 533 U. S. 525 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
few avenues of communication, then the Attorney General'soutdoor advertising regulations potentially place a greater,

not lesser, burden on those retailers' speech. Furthermore,to the extent that cigar products and cigar advertising differ from that of other tobacco products, that differenceshould inform the inquiry into what speech restrictions are
necessary.

In addition, a retailer in Massachusetts may have nomeans of communicating to passersby on the street that it

sells tobacco products because alternative forms of adver-tisement, like newspapers, do not allow that retailer to propose an instant transaction in the way that onsite advertising does. The ban on any indoor advertising that is visible
from the outside also presents problems in establishments
like convenience stores, which have unique security concerns
that counsel in favor of full visibility of the store from the
outside. It is these sorts of considerations that the Attorney General failed to incorporate into the regulatory scheme.

We conclude that the Attorney General has failed to show
that the outdoor advertising regulations for smokeless tobacco and cigars are not more extensive than necessary to
advance the State's substantial interest in preventing underage tobacco use. Justice Stevens urges that the Court
remand the case for further development of the factual record. Post, at 601-603. We believe that a remand is inappropriate in these cases because the State had ample opportunity to develop a record with respect to tailoring (as it had
to justify its decision to regulate advertising), and additional
evidence would not alter the nature of the scheme before the
Court. See Greater New Orleans, 527 U. S., at 189, n. 6.

A careful calculation of the costs of a speech regulation
does not mean that a State must demonstrate that there is
no incursion on legitimate speech interests, but a speech regulation cannot unduly impinge on the speaker's ability to
propose a commercial transaction and the adult listener's
opportunity to obtain information about products. After

Opinion of the Court
reviewing the outdoor advertising regulations, we find the
calculation in these cases insufficient for purposes of the
First Amendment.

C

Massachusetts has also restricted indoor, point-of-sale advertising for smokeless tobacco and cigars. Advertising
cannot be "placed lower than five feet from the floor of any
retail establishment which is located within a one thousand
foot radius of " any school or playground. 940 Code of Mass.
Regs. $$ 21.04(5)(b), 22.06(5)(b) (2000). The District Court
invalidated these provisions, concluding that the Attorney
General had not provided a sufficient basis for regulating
indoor advertising. 84 F. Supp. 2d, at 192-193, 195. The
Court of Appeals reversed. 218 F. 3d, at 50-51. The court
explained: "We do have some misgivings about the effectiveness of a restriction that is based on the assumption that
minors under five feet tall will not, or will less frequently,
raise their view above eye-level, but we find that such [a]
determination falls within that range of reasonableness in
which the Attorney General is best suited to pass judgment."
Id., at 51.

We conclude that the point-of-sale advertising regulations
fail both the third and fourth steps of the Central Hudson
analysis. A regulation cannot be sustained if it " `provides
only ineffective or remote support for the government's purpose,' " Edenfield, 507 U. S., at 770 (quoting Central Hudson,
447 U. S., at 564), or if there is "little chance" that the restriction will advance the State's goal, Greater New Orleans,
supra, at 193 (internal quotation marks omitted). As outlined above, the State's goal is to prevent minors from using
tobacco products and to curb demand for that activity by
limiting youth exposure to advertising. The 5-foot rule does
not seem to advance that goal. Not all children are less than
5 feet tall, and those who are certainly have the ability to
look up and take in their surroundings.

Opinion of the Court
By contrast to Justice Stevens, post, at 604-605, we donot believe this regulation can be construed as a mere regulation of conduct under United States v. O'Brien, 391 U. S.367 (1968). To qualify as a regulation of communicative
action governed by the scrutiny outlined in O'Brien, theState's regulation must be unrelated to expression. Texas
v. Johnson, 491 U. S. 397, 403 (1989). See also Erie v. Pap's
A. M., 529 U. S., at 289-296 (plurality opinion). Here, Mas-sachusetts' height restriction is an attempt to regulate directly the communicative impact of indoor advertising.Massachusetts may wish to target tobacco advertisements
and displays that entice children, much like floor-level candydisplays in a convenience store, but the blanket height restriction does not constitute a reasonable fit with that goal.The Court of Appeals recognized that the efficacy of the regulation was questionable, but decided that, "[i]n any event,the burden on speech imposed by the provision is very limited." 218 F. 3d, at 51. There is no de minimis exceptionfor a speech restriction that lacks sufficient tailoring or justification. We conclude that the restriction on the height ofindoor advertising is invalid under

Central Hudson's thirdand fourth prongs.

D
The Attorney General also promulgated a number of regu-lations that restrict sales practices by cigarette, smokeless

tobacco, and cigar manufacturers and retailers. Amongother restrictions, the regulations bar the use of self-service
displays and require that tobacco products be placed out ofthe reach of all consumers in a location accessible only to
salespersons. 940 Code of Mass. Regs. $$ 21.04(2)(c)-(d),22.06(2)(c)-(d) (2000). The cigarette petitioners do not
challenge the sales practices regulations on pre-emptiongrounds. Brief for Petitioners Lorillard Tobacco Co. et al.

pany, and the cigar petitioners challenge the sales practicesregulations on First Amendment grounds. The cigar petitioners additionally challenge a provision that prohibits sam-pling or promotional giveaways of cigars or little cigars.
940 Code of Mass. Regs. $ 22.06(1)(a) (2000).The District Court concluded that these restrictions implicate no cognizable speech interest, 84 F. Supp. 2d, at 195-196,
but the Court of Appeals did not fully adopt that reasoning.The Court of Appeals recognized that self-service displays

"often do have some communicative commercial function,"but noted that the restriction in the regulations "is not on
speech, but rather on the physical location of actual tobacco
products." 218 F. 3d, at 53. The court reasoned that nothing in the regulations would prevent the display of empty
tobacco product containers, so long as no actual tobacco product was displayed, much like movie jackets at a video store.
Ibid. With respect to cigar products, the court observed
that retailers traditionally allow access to those products, so
that the consumer may make a selection on the basis of a
number of objective and subjective factors including the
aroma and feel of the cigars. Ibid. Even assuming a
speech interest, however, the court concluded that the regulations were narrowly tailored to serve the State's substantial interest in preventing access to tobacco products by minors. Id., at 54. The court also noted that the restrictions
do not apply to adult-only establishments. Ibid.

Petitioners devoted little of their briefing to the sales practices regulations, and our understanding of the regulations
is accordingly limited by the parties' submissions. As we
read the regulations, they basically require tobacco retailers
to place tobacco products behind counters and require customers to have contact with a salesperson before they are
able to handle a tobacco product.

The cigarette and smokeless tobacco petitioners contend
that "the same First Amendment principles that require invalidation of the outdoor and indoor advertising restrictions

require invalidation of the display regulations at issue in thiscase." Brief for Petitioners Lorillard Tobacco Co. et al. in

No. 00-596, at 46, n. 7. See also Reply Brief for PetitionerU. S. Smokeless Tobacco Co. in Nos. 00-596 and 00-597, at
12, n. 7. The cigar petitioners contend that self-service dis-plays for cigars cannot be prohibited because each brand of
cigar is unique and customers traditionally have sought to
handle and compare cigars at the time of purchase. Brieffor Petitioners Altadis U. S. A. Inc. et al. in No. 00-597, at

23, n. 9; Reply Brief for Petitioners Altadis U. S. A. Inc. et al.in No. 00-597, p. 10, n. 7.

We reject these contentions. Assuming that petitioners
have a cognizable speech interest in a particular means
of displaying their products, cf. Cincinnati v. Discovery
Network, Inc., 507 U. S. 410 (1993) (distribution of a magazine through newsracks), these regulations withstand First
Amendment scrutiny.

Massachusetts' sales practices provisions regulate conduct
that may have a communicative component, but Massachusetts seeks to regulate the placement of tobacco products
for reasons unrelated to the communication of ideas. See
O'Brien, supra, at 382. See also Pap's A. M., 529 U. S., at
289 (plurality opinion); id., at 310 (Souter, J., concurring in
part and dissenting in part); Johnson, supra, at 403. We
conclude that the State has demonstrated a substantial interest in preventing access to tobacco products by minors and
has adopted an appropriately narrow means of advancing
that interest. See O'Brien, supra, at 382.

Unattended displays of tobacco products present an opportunity for access without the proper age verification required
by law. Thus, the State prohibits self-service and other displays that would allow an individual to obtain tobacco products without direct contact with a salesperson. It is clear
that the regulations leave open ample channels of communication. The regulations do not significantly impede adult
access to tobacco products. Moreover, retailers have other

means of exercising any cognizable speech interest in thepresentation of their products. We presume that vendors

may place empty tobacco packaging on open display, and dis-play actual tobacco products so long as that display is only
accessible to sales personnel. As for cigars, there is no indi-cation in the regulations that a customer is unable to examine a cigar prior to purchase, so long as that examinationtakes place through a salesperson.

The cigar petitioners also list Massachusetts' prohibitionon sampling and free giveaways among the regulations they
challenge on First Amendment grounds. See 940 Code ofMass. Regs. $ 22.06(1)(a) (2000); Brief for Petitioners Altadis
U. S. A. Inc. et al. in No. 00-597, at 2. At no point in theirbriefs or at oral argument, however, did the cigar petitioners
argue the merits of their First Amendment claim with re-spect to the sampling and giveaway regulation. We decline
to address an issue that was not sufficiently briefed and ar-gued before this Court. See

Northwest Airlines, Inc. v.
County of Kent, 510 U. S. 355, 366, n. 10 (1994); Williams v.United States, 503 U. S. 193, 206 (1992); Granfinanciera,

S. A. v. Nordberg, 492 U. S. 33, 38-40 (1989).We conclude that the sales practices regulations withstand
First Amendment scrutiny. The means chosen by the Stateare narrowly tailored to prevent access to tobacco products
by minors, are unrelated to expression, and leave open alter-native avenues for vendors to convey information about
products and for would-be customers to inspect products be-fore purchase.

for themselves the risks and potential benefits of tobacco use,and other adult activities. Federal law, however, places limits on policy choices available to the States.In these cases, Congress enacted a comprehensive scheme
to address cigarette smoking and health in advertising andpre-empted state regulation of cigarette advertising that attempts to address that same concern, even with respect toyouth. The First Amendment also constrains state efforts
to limit advertising of tobacco products, because so long asthe sale and use of tobacco is lawful for adults, the tobacco
industry has a protected interest in communicating informa-tion about its products and adult customers have an interest
in receiving that information.To the extent that federal law and the First Amendment
do not prohibit state action, States and localities remain freeto combat the problem of underage tobacco use by appropriate means. The judgment of the United States Court ofAppeals for the First Circuit is therefore affirmed in part
and reversed in part, and the cases are remanded for furtherproceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

The obvious overbreadth of the outdoor advertising re-strictions suffices to invalidate them under the fourth part
of the test in Central Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public
Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 557 (1980). As a result, in
my view, there is no need to consider whether the restric-tions satisfy the third part of the test, a proposition about

which there is considerable doubt. Cf. post, at 583-584(

Justice Thomas, concurring in part and concurring inthe judgment.
I join the opinion of the Court (with the exception of PartIII-B-1) because I agree that the Massachusetts cigarette
advertising regulations are pre-empted by the Federal Ciga-rette Labeling and Advertising Act, 15 U. S. C. $ 1331

et seq.I also agree with the Court's disposition of the First Amendment challenges to the other regulations at issue here, andI share the Court's view that the regulations fail even the
intermediate scrutiny of Central Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp.v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 557 (1980). At
the same time, I continue to believe that when the govern-ment seeks to restrict truthful speech in order to suppress
the ideas it conveys, strict scrutiny is appropriate, whetheror not the speech in question may be characterized as "commercial." See 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 517U. S. 484, 518 (1996) (

At the heart of this litigation is a Massachusetts regulationthat imposes a sweeping ban on speech about tobacco products. 940 Code of Mass. Regs. $ 21.04(5) (2000), which gov-erns cigarettes and smokeless tobacco, and $ 22.06(5), which
governs cigars, prohibit all outdoor advertising, all indooradvertising that can be seen from outdoors, and all point-ofsale advertising (even if not visible from outdoors) that is

lower than five feet from the floor.1 These restrictions are
superficially limited in their geographic scope: They apply
only within 1,000 feet of "any public playground, playground
area in a public park, elementary school or secondary
school." $ 21.04(5)(a). But the Court of Appeals acknowledged that the zone of prohibition covers as much as 90 percent of the three largest cities in Massachusetts, Consolidated Cigar Corp. v. Reilly, 218 F. 3d 30, 50 (CA1 2000), so
the practical effect is little different from that of a total ban.
Cf. United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc., 529
U. S. 803, 812 (2000) ("The Government's content-based burdens must satisfy the same rigorous scrutiny as its contentbased bans").

Respondents suggest in passing that the regulations are
"zoning-type restrictions" that should receive "the intermediate level of scrutiny traditionally associated with various
forms of `time, place, and manner' regulations." Brief for
Respondents 31. We have indeed upheld time, place, and
manner regulations that prohibited certain kinds of outdoor
signs, see, e. g., Members of City Council of Los Angeles v.
Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U. S. 789 (1984), and we have
similarly upheld zoning laws that had the effect of restricting
certain kinds of sexually explicit expression, see, e. g., Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U. S. 41 (1986). But the
abiding characteristic of valid time, place, and manner regulations is their content neutrality. See Ward v. Rock
Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781, 791-796 (1989). In Vincent
the city prohibited all signs on public property, not to sup1 Other regulations prohibit the sale of tobacco products "in any manner

sampling and promotional giveaways. See $$ 21.04(1), 22.06(1). I agree
with the Court, see ante, at 567-570, that these regulations, which govern
conduct rather than expression, should be upheld under the test of United
States v. O'Brien, 391 U. S. 367 (1968).

press the message conveyed by any of the signs, but simply
to minimize the esthetic effect of visual clutter. Likewise,
the ordinance in Renton was aimed not at expression, but at
the "secondary effects" caused by adult businesses.

The regulations here are very different. Massachusetts
is not concerned with any "secondary effects" of tobacco advertising--it is concerned with the advertising's primary effect, which is to induce those who view the advertisements
to purchase and use tobacco products. Cf. Boos v. Barry,
485 U. S. 312, 321 (1988) ("Listeners' reactions to speech are
not the type of `secondary effects' we referred to in Renton"). In other words, it seeks to suppress speech about
tobacco because it objects to the content of that speech. We
have consistently applied strict scrutiny to such contentbased regulations of speech. See, e. g., Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. 622, 641-643 (1994).

There was once a time when this Court declined to give
any First Amendment protection to commercial speech. In
Valentine v. Chrestensen, 316 U. S. 52 (1942), the Court went
so far as to say that "the Constitution imposes [no] restraint
on government as respects purely commercial advertising."
Id., at 54. That position was repudiated in Virginia Bd. of
Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425
U. S. 748 (1976), which explained that even speech "which
does `no more than propose a commercial transaction' " is
protected by the First Amendment. Id., at 762 (quoting
Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Pittsburgh Comm'n on Human Relations, 413 U. S. 376, 385 (1973)). Since then, the Court has
followed an uncertain course--much of the uncertainty being
generated by the malleability of the four-part balancing test
of Central Hudson. See 44 Liquormart, 517 U. S., at 520-
522 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in
judgment).

Opinion of Thomas, J.
I have observed previously that there is no "philosophicalor historical basis for asserting that `commercial' speech is

of `lower value' than `noncommercial' speech." Id., at 522.Indeed, I doubt whether it is even possible to draw a coherent distinction between commercial and noncommercialspeech. See id., at 523, n. 4 (citing Kozinski & Banner,
Who's Afraid of Commercial Speech, 76 Va. L. Rev. 627(1990)).

It should be clear that if these regulations targeted any-thing other than advertising for commercial products--if, for

example, they were directed at billboards promoting politicalcandidates--all would agree that the restrictions should be
subjected to strict scrutiny. In my view, an asserted gov-ernment interest in keeping people ignorant by suppressing
expression "is per se illegitimate and can no more justifyregulation of `commercial' speech than it can justify regulation of `noncommercial' speech." 517 U. S., at 518 (Thomas,J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). That is
essentially the interest asserted here, and, adhering to theviews I expressed in 44 Liquormart, I would subject the
Massachusetts regulations to strict scrutiny.

Even if one accepts the premise that commercial speechgenerally is entitled to a lower level of constitutional protection than are other forms of speech, it does not follow thatthe regulations here deserve anything less than strict scrutiny. Although we have recognized several categories of

products is the subject of considerable political controversy, and not surprisingly, some tobacco advertisements both promote a product and take
a stand in this political debate. See Brief for National Association of Convenience Stores as Amicus Curiae 20-22. A recent cigarette advertisement, for example, displayed a brand logo next to text reading, "Why
do politicians smoke cigars while taxing cigarettes?" App. to Brief for

Opinion of Thomas, J.
speech that normally receive reduced First Amendment pro-tection, or no First Amendment protection at all, we have

never held that the government may regulate speech withinthose categories in any way that it wishes. Rather, we have
said "that these areas of speech can, consistently with theFirst Amendment, be regulated because of their constitutionally proscribable content." R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505U. S. 377, 383 (1992). Even when speech falls into a category
of reduced constitutional protection, the government maynot engage in content discrimination for reasons unrelated
to those characteristics of the speech that place it within thecategory. For example, a city may ban obscenity (because
obscenity is an unprotected category, see, e. g., Roth v.
United States, 354 U. S. 476 (1957)), but it may not ban "onlythose legally obscene works that contain criticism of the city

government." R. A. V., supra, at 384.In explaining the distinction between commercial speech
and other forms of speech, we have emphasized that commer-cial speech is both "more easily verifiable by its disseminator" and less likely to be "chilled by proper regulation."
Virginia Bd., 425 U. S., at 772, n. 24. These characteristicsled us to conclude that, in the context of commercial speech,

it is "less necessary to tolerate inaccurate statements for fearof silencing the speaker," and also that it is more "appropriate to require that a commercial message appear in sucha form, or include such additional information, warnings, and
disclaimers, as are necessary to prevent its being deceptive."Ibid. Whatever the validity of this reasoning, it is limited
to the peculiarly commercial harms that commercial speechcan threaten--i. e., the risk of deceptive or misleading advertising. As we observed in R. A. V.:

"[A] State may choose to regulate price advertising inone industry but not in others, because the risk of fraud

(one of the characteristics of commercial speech that jus-tifies depriving it of full First Amendment protection) is
in its view greater there. But a State may not prohibit

only that commercial advertising that depicts men in ademeaning fashion." 505 U. S., at 388-389 (citations

omitted).
In 44 Liquormart, several Members of the Court saidmuch the same thing:

"[W]hen a State entirely prohibits the dissemination oftruthful, nonmisleading commercial messages for reasons unrelated to the preservation of a fair bargain-ing process, there is far less reason to depart from the
rigorous review that the First Amendment generallydemands." 517 U. S., at 501 (opinion of

Stevens, J.,joined by
Kennedy and Ginsburg, JJ.).

Whatever power the State may have to regulate commercialspeech, it may not use that power to limit the content of

commercial speech, as it has done here, "for reasons unre-lated to the preservation of a fair bargaining process." Such
content-discriminatory regulation--like all other content-based regulation of speech--must be subjected to strict
scrutiny. C

In an effort to avoid the implications of these basic princi-ples of First Amendment law, respondents make two principal claims. First, they argue that the regulations target de-ceptive and misleading speech. See Brief for Respondents
33 ("Petitioners' advertising clearly engenders `the potentialfor deception or confusion' that allows for regulation of commercial speech based on its content" (quoting Bolger v.
Youngs Drug Products Corp., 463 U. S. 60, 65 (1983))). Sec-ond, they argue that the regulations restrict speech that promotes an illegal transaction--i. e., the sale of tobacco to mi-nors. See Brief for Respondents 15 ("The regulations . . .
exhibit a close connection to a commercial transaction theState has prohibited").

Neither theory is properly before the Court. For pur-poses of summary judgment, respondents were willing to as533US2 Unit: $U84 [11-05-02 18:55:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of Thomas, J.
sume "that the tobacco advertisements at issue here aretruthful, nonmisleading speech about a lawful activity." 218

F. 3d, at 43. Although respondents now claim that theyhave not conceded this point, see Brief for Respondents 35,
n. 17, the fact remains that they did not urge their theoriesin the lower courts, and in general, we do not consider arguments for affirmance that were not presented below. See,
e. g., Glover v. United States, 531 U. S. 198, 205 (2001).These concessions should make this an easy case, one clearly

controlled by 44 Liquormart and by Greater New Orleans
Broadcasting Assn., Inc. v. United States, 527 U. S. 173
(1999). At all events, even if we were to entertain these
arguments, neither is persuasive.

Respondents suggest that tobacco advertising is misleading because "its youthful imagery and . . . sheer ubiquity"
leads children to believe "that tobacco use is desirable and
pervasive." Brief for Respondents 33; see also Brief for
United States as Amicus Curiae 7 ("[S]o many children lack
the maturity in judgment to resist the tobacco industry's appeals to excitement, glamour, and independence"). This justification is belied, however, by the sweeping overinclusivity
of the regulations. Massachusetts has done nothing to target its prohibition to advertisements appealing to "excitement, glamour, and independence"; the ban applies with
equal force to appeals to torpor, homeliness, and servility.
It has not focused on "youthful imagery"; smokers depicted
on the sides of buildings may no more play shuffleboard than
they may ride skateboards.

The regulations even prohibit a store from accurately stating the prices at which cigarettes are sold. Such a display
could not possibly be misleading, unless one accepts the
State's apparent view that the simple existence of tobacco
advertisements misleads people into believing that tobacco
use is more pervasive than it actually is. The State misunderstands the purpose of advertising. Promoting a product
that is not yet pervasively used (or a cause that is not yet

Opinion of Thomas, J.
widely supported) is a primary purpose of advertising. To-bacco advertisements would be no more misleading for suggesting pervasive use of tobacco products than are any otheradvertisements that attempt to expand a market for a product, or to rally support for a political movement. Any infer-ence from the advertisements that businesses would like for
tobacco use to be pervasive is entirely reasonable, and advertising that gives rise to that inference is in no way deceptive.The State also contends that tobacco advertisements may

be restricted because they propose an illegal sale of tobaccoto minors. A direct solicitation of unlawful activity may of
course be proscribed, whether or not it is commercial in nature. See Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U. S. 444 (1969) (per
curiam). The State's power to punish speech that solicits
or incites crime has nothing to do with the commercial character of the speech. After all, it is often the case that solicitation to commit a crime is entirely noncommercial. The
harm that the State seeks to prevent is the harm caused by
the unlawful activity that is solicited; it is unrelated to the
commercial transaction itself. Thus there is no reason to
apply anything other than our usual rule for evaluating solicitation and incitement simply because the speech in question
happens to be commercial. See Carey v. Population Services Int'l, 431 U. S. 678, 701-702 (1977).

Viewed as an effort to proscribe solicitation to unlawful
conduct, these regulations clearly fail the Brandenburg test.
A State may not "forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of
force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and
is likely to incite or produce such action." Brandenburg,
supra, at 447. Even if Massachusetts could prohibit advertisements reading, "Hey kids, buy cigarettes here," these
regulations sweep much more broadly than that. They
cover "any . . . statement or representation . . . the purpose
or effect of which is to promote the use or sale" of tobacco
products, whether or not the statement is directly or indi533US2 Unit: $U84 [11-05-02 18:55:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN

rectly addressed to minors. 940 Code of Mass. Regs. $ 21.03(2000). On respondents' theory,

all tobacco advertising may
be limited because some of its viewers may not legally acton it.

It is difficult to see any stopping point to a rule that wouldallow a State to prohibit all speech in favor of an activity in
which it is illegal for minors to engage. Presumably, the
State could ban car advertisements in an effort to enforce itsrestrictions on underage driving. It could regulate advertisements urging people to vote, because children are notpermitted to vote. And, although the Solicitor General resisted this implication of her theory, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 55-
56, the State could prohibit advertisements for adult businesses, which children are forbidden to patronize.

At bottom, respondents' theory rests on the premise that
an indirect solicitation is enough to empower the State to
regulate speech, and that, as petitioners put it, even an advertisement directed at adults "will give any children who
may happen to see it the wrong idea and therefore must be
suppressed from public view." Brief for Petitioners Lorillard Tobacco Co. et al. in No. 00-596, p. 36. This view is
foreign to the First Amendment. "Every idea is an incitement," Gitlow v. New York, 268 U. S. 652, 673 (1925) (Holmes,
J., dissenting), and if speech may be suppressed whenever it
might inspire someone to act unlawfully, then there is no
limit to the State's censorial power. Cf. American Booksellers Assn., Inc. v. Hudnut, 771 F. 2d 323 (CA7 1985), aff 'd,
475 U. S. 1001 (1986).

There is a deeper flaw in the State's argument. Even if
Massachusetts has a valid interest in regulating speech directed at children--who, it argues, may be more easily misled, and to whom the sale of tobacco products is unlawful--
it may not pursue that interest at the expense of the free
speech rights of adults.

The theory that public debate should be limited in order
to protect impressionable children has a long historical pedi533US2 Unit: $U84 [11-05-02 18:55:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN

gree: Socrates was condemned for being "a doer of evil, inas-much as he corrupts the youth." 1 Dialogues of Plato, Apology 348 (B. Jowett transl., 4th ed. 1953). But the theory hasmet with a less enthusiastic reception in this Court than it
did in the Athenian assembly. In Butler v. Michigan, 352U. S. 380 (1957), we struck down a statute restricting the
sale of materials " `tending to incite minors to violent or depraved or immoral acts.' " Id., at 381 (quoting then Mich.Penal Code $ 343). The effect of the law, we observed, was

"to reduce the adult population of Michigan to reading onlywhat is fit for children." 352 U. S., at 383. As Justice
Frankfurter colorfully put it, "Surely, this is to burn the
house to roast the pig." Ibid.

We have held consistently that speech "cannot be suppressed solely to protect the young from ideas or images that
a legislative body thinks unsuitable for them." Erznoznik
v. Jacksonville, 422 U. S. 205, 213-214 (1975); accord, Bolger,
463 U. S., at 74 ("The level of discourse reaching a mailbox
simply cannot be limited to that which would be suitable for
a sandbox"). To be sure, in FCC v. Pacifica Foundation,
438 U. S. 726 (1978), we upheld the Federal Communications
Commission's power to regulate indecent but nonobscene
radio broadcasts. But Pacifica relied heavily on what it
considered to be the "special justifications for regulation of
the broadcast media that are not applicable to other speakers." Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U. S.
844, 868 (1997). It emphasized that radio is "uniquely

pervasive" and "uniquely accessible to children, even those
too young to read." Pacifica, supra, at 748-749 (emphasis
added).

Outside of the broadcasting context, we have adhered to
the view that "the governmental interest in protecting children from harmful materials" does not "justify an unnecessarily broad suppression of speech addressed to adults."

suffice to support a blanket ban if the protection can be ac-complished by a less restrictive alternative"). Massachusetts may not avoid the application of strict scrutiny simply
because it seeks to protect children.

II
Under strict scrutiny, the advertising ban may be saved
only if it is narrowly tailored to promote a compelling government interest. See, e. g., id., at 813. If that interest
could be served by an alternative that is less restrictive of
speech, then the State must use that alternative instead.
See ibid.; Reno, supra, at 874. Applying this standard, the
regulations here must fail.

Massachusetts asserts a compelling interest in reducing
tobacco use among minors. Applied to adults, an interest in
manipulating market choices by keeping people ignorant
would not be legitimate, let alone compelling. See supra,
at 575. But assuming that there is a compelling interest
in reducing underage smoking, and that the ban on outdoor
advertising promotes this interest, I doubt that the same is
true of the ban on point-of-sale advertising below five feet.
See 940 Code of Mass. Regs. $$ 21.04(5)(b), 22.06(5)(b) (2000).
The Court of Appeals admitted to having "some misgivings
about the effectiveness of a restriction that is based on the
assumption that minors under five feet tall will not, or will
less frequently, raise their view above eye-level," 218 F. 3d,
at 51, as well it might have, since respondents have produced
no evidence to support this counterintuitive assumption.
Obviously even short children can see objects that are taller
than they are. Anyway, by the time they are 121/2 years old,
both the median girl and the median boy are over five feet
tall. See U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
Growth Charts (2000). Thus, there is no reason to believe
that this regulation does anything to protect minors from

Opinion of Thomas, J.
exposure to tobacco advertising.3 Far from serving a compelling interest, the ban on displays below five feet seems to
lack even a minimally rational relationship to any conceivable interest.

There is also considerable reason to doubt that the restrictions on cigar and smokeless tobacco outdoor advertising
promote any state interest. Outdoor advertising for cigars,
after all, is virtually nonexistent. Cigar makers use no billboards in Massachusetts, and in fact their nationwide outdoor advertising budget is only about $50,000 per year. See
218 F. 3d, at 49. To the extent outdoor advertising exists,
there is no evidence that it is targeted at youth or has a
significant effect on youth. The Court of Appeals focused
on the State's evidence of a relationship between "tobacco
advertising and tobacco use," id., at 48, thus eliding the
dearth of evidence showing any relationship between cigar
advertising and cigar use by minors. Respondents principally rely on a National Cancer Institute report on cigar
smoking, see Brief for Respondents 39, n. 19. But that report contains only the conclusory assertion that cigars are
being "heavily promoted in ways likely to influence adolescent use," and it does not even discuss outdoor advertising,
instead focusing on "[e]ndorsements by celebrities," "the re3 This is not to say that the regulation does nothing at all. As the Court
points out, see ante, at 565, security concerns require that convenience
stores be designed so that the interior of the store is visible from the
street. See also Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Recommendations for Workplace Violence Prevention Programs in Late-Night
Retail Establishments 6 (1998) ("Shelves should be low enough to assure
good visibility throughout the store"). The $ 21.04(5)(b) ban on displays
below five feet and the $ 21.04(5)(a) ban on displays visible from outside
the store, combined with these security concerns, would prevent many
convenience stores from displaying any tobacco products at all. Thus,
despite the State's disclaimers, see Brief for Respondents 30 ("The State,
quite clearly, is not trying to suppress altogether the communication of
product information to interested consumers"), the restrictions effectively
produce a total ban.

Institute, Cigars: Health Effects and Trends, Smoking andTobacco Control Monograph No. 9, pp. 14-15 (1998), Record,
Doc. No. 39, Exh. 67. The report candidly acknowledgesthat "[a]dditional information is needed to better characterize marketing efforts for cigars" and "to learn the extent towhich advertising and promotion for cigars . . . reaches and
affects kids." Id., at 216-217. In other words, respondentshave adduced no evidence that a ban on cigar advertising
will do anything to promote their asserted interest.Much the same is true of smokeless tobacco. Here respondents place primary reliance on evidence that, in the late1960's, the U. S. Smokeless Tobacco Company increased its
sales through advertising targeted at young males. SeeBrief for Respondents 39, n. 19. But this does nothing to
show that advertising affecting minors is a problem today.The Court invokes the Food and Drug Administration's findings, see ante, at 559-560, but the report it cites based itsconclusions on the observed "very large increase in the use
of smokeless tobacco products by young people." 60 Fed.Reg. 41318 (1995). This premise is contradicted by one of
respondents' own studies, which reports a large, steady de-crease in smokeless tobacco use among Massachusetts high
school students during the 1990's. See App. 292. Thisfinding casts some doubt on whether the State's interest in
additional regulation is truly compelling. More importantly,because cigarette smoking among high school students has
not exhibited such a trend, see ibid., it indicates that re-spondents' effort to aggregate cigarettes and smokeless tobacco is misguided. B

In any case, even assuming that the regulations advance acompelling state interest, they must be struck down because
they are not narrowly tailored. The Court is correct, see
ante, at 561-563, that the arbitrary 1,000-foot radius demon533US2 Unit: $U84 [11-05-02 18:55:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of Thomas, J.
strates a lack of narrow tailoring, but the problem goesdeeper than that. A prohibited zone defined solely by circles drawn around schools and playgrounds is necessarilyoverinclusive, regardless of the radii of the circles. Consider, for example, a billboard located within 1,000 feet of aschool but visible only from an elevated freeway that runs
nearby. Such a billboard would not threaten any of the interests respondents assert, but it would be banned anyway,because the regulations take no account of whether the advertisement could even be seen by children. The prohibitedzone is even more suspect where, as here, it includes all but
10 percent of the area in the three largest cities in the State.

The loose tailoring of the advertising ban is displayed not
only in its geographic scope but also in the nature of the
advertisements it affects. The regulations define "advertisement" very broadly; the term includes any "written . . .
statement or representation, made by" a person who sells
tobacco products, "the purpose or effect of which is to promote the use or sale of the product." 940 Code of Mass.
Regs. $ 21.03 (2000). Almost everything a business does has
the purpose of promoting the sale of its products, so this
definition would cover anything a tobacco retailer might say.
Some of the prohibited speech would not even be commercial.
If a store displayed a sign promoting a candidate for Attorney General who had promised to repeal the tobacco regulations if elected, it probably would be doing so with the longterm purpose of promoting sales, and the display of such a
sign would be illegal.

Even if the definition of "advertisement" were read more
narrowly so as to require a specific reference to tobacco products, it still would have Draconian effects. It would, for example, prohibit a tobacconist from displaying a sign reading
"Joe's Cigar Shop." The effect of this rule is not to make
cigars impossible to find; retailers are after all allowed to
display a 576-square-inch black-and-white sign reading "Tobacco Products Sold Here." $ 22.06(6). Rather, it is to

make individual cigar retailers more difficult to identify bymaking them change their names. Respondents assert no

interest in cigar retailer anonymity, and it is difficult to con-ceive of any other interest to which this rule could be said
to be narrowly tailored.The regulations fail the narrow tailoring inquiry for another, more fundamental reason. In addition to examininga narrower advertising ban, the State should have examined
ways of advancing its interest that do not require limitingspeech at all. Here, respondents had several alternatives.
Most obviously, they could have directly regulated the con-duct with which they were concerned. See,

e. g., Rubin v.Coors Brewing Co., 514 U. S. 476, 490-491 (1995) (invalidating ban on disclosure of alcohol content on beer labels, inpart because the Government could have pursued alternatives such as "directly limiting the alcohol content of beers");see also 44 Liquormart, 517 U. S., at 524 (

Thomas, J., concur-ring in part and concurring in judgment) ("[I]t would seem

that directly banning a product (or . . . otherwise restrictingits sale in specific ways) would virtually always be at least as
effective in discouraging consumption as merely restrictingadvertising"). Massachusetts already prohibits the sale of
tobacco to minors, but it could take steps to enforce thatprohibition more vigorously. It also could enact laws prohibiting the purchase, possession, or use of tobacco by mi-nors. And, if its concern is that tobacco advertising communicates a message with which it disagrees, it could seek tocounteract that message with "more speech, not enforced
silence," Whitney v. California, 274 U. S. 357, 377 (1927)(Brandeis, J., concurring).

Underlying many of the arguments of respondents andtheir

amici is the idea that tobacco is in some sense sui gene-ris--that it is so special, so unlike any other object of regulation, that application of normal First Amendment principlesshould be suspended. See,

e. g., Brief for Respondents 50

(referring to tobacco use as "one of the State's--and indeed
the Nation's--most urgent problems"); Brief for United
States as Amicus Curiae 19-20 (cataloging the prevalence
and the effects of tobacco use); Brief for American Medical
Association et al. as Amici Curiae 24 (advocating "the authority of governments to protect children from uniquely
dangerous messages"). Smoking poses serious health risks,
and advertising may induce children (who lack the judgment
to make an intelligent decision about whether to smoke) to
begin smoking, which can lead to addiction. The State's assessment of the urgency of the problem posed by tobacco is
a policy judgment, and it is not this Court's place to secondguess it. Nevertheless, it seems appropriate to point out
that to uphold the Massachusetts tobacco regulations would
be to accept a line of reasoning that would permit restrictions on advertising for a host of other products.

Tobacco use is, we are told, "the single leading cause of
preventable death in the United States." Brief for United
States as Amicus Curiae 19. The second largest contributor to mortality rates in the United States is obesity.
Koplan & Dietz, Caloric Imbalance and Public Health Policy,
282 JAMA 1579 (1999). It is associated with increased incidence of diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease,
ibid., and it represents a public health problem that is rapidly
growing worse. See Mokdad et al., The Spread of the Obesity Epidemic in the United States, 1991-1998, 282 JAMA
1519 (1999). Although the growth of obesity over the last
few decades has had many causes, a significant factor has
been the increased availability of large quantities of highcalorie, high-fat foods. See Hill, Environmental Contributions to the Obesity Epidemic, 280 Science 1371 (1998).
Such foods, of course, have been aggressively marketed and
promoted by fast food companies. See Nestle & Jacobson,

Human Services, 115 Public Health Reports 12, 18 (2000).

588 LORILLARD TOBACCO CO. v. REILLY

Opinion of Thomas, J.
Respondents say that tobacco companies are covertly targeting children in their advertising. Fast food companies do
so openly. See, e. g., Kramer, McD's Steals Another Toy
from BK, Advertising Age, Nov. 15, 1999, p. 1 (describing a
McDonald's promotional campaign); Lucas, BK Takes Choice
Message to Kids, Adweek, June 29, 1998, p. 4 (describing a
Burger King promotional campaign). Moreover, there is
considerable evidence that they have been successful in
changing children's eating behavior. See Borzekowski &
Robinson, The 30-Second Effect, 101 J. Am. Dietetic Assn. 42
(2001); Taras, Sallis, Patterson, Nader, & Nelson, Television's
Influence on Children's Diet and Physical Activity, 10 J.
Dev. & Behav. Pediatrics 176 (1989). The effect of advertising on children's eating habits is significant for two reasons.
First, childhood obesity is a serious health problem in its
own right. Troiano & Flegal, Overweight Children and Adolescents, 101 Pediatrics 497 (1998). Second, eating preferences formed in childhood tend to persist in adulthood.
Birch & Fisher, Development of Eating Behaviors Among
Children and Adolescents, 101 Pediatrics 539 (1998). So
even though fast food is not addictive in the same way tobacco is, children's exposure to fast food advertising can have
deleterious consequences that are difficult to reverse.

To take another example, the third largest cause of preventable deaths in the United States is alcohol. McGinnis &
Foege, Actual Causes of Death in the United States, 270
JAMA 2207, 2208 (1993). Alcohol use is associated with tens
of thousands of deaths each year from cancers and digestive
diseases. Id., at 2208-2209. And the victims of alcohol use
are not limited to those who drink alcohol. In 1996, over
17,000 people were killed, and over 321,000 people were injured, in alcohol-related car accidents. U. S. Dept. of Justice, Alcohol and Crime 13 (1998). Each year, alcohol is involved in several million violent crimes, including almost
200,000 sexual assaults. Id., at 3-4.

Opinion of Thomas, J.
Although every State prohibits the sale of alcohol to thoseunder age 21, much alcohol advertising is viewed by children.

Federal Trade Commission, J. Evans & R. Kelly, Self-Regulation in the Alcohol Industry (Sept. 1999); Grube &
Wallack, Television Beer Advertising and Drinking Knowl-edge, Beliefs, and Intentions among Schoolchildren, 84 Am.
J. Pub. Health 254 (1994). Not surprisingly, there is considerable evidence that exposure to alcohol advertising is asso-ciated with underage drinking. See Atkin, Survey and Experimental Research on Effects of Alcohol Advertising, inThe Effects of the Mass Media on the Use and Abuse of Alcohol 39 (S. Martin ed. 1995); Madden & Grube, The Frequency
and Nature of Alcohol and Tobacco Advertising in Televised
Sports, 1990 through 1992, 84 Am. J. Pub. Health 297 (1994).

Like underage tobacco use, underage drinking has effects
that cannot be undone later in life. Those who begin drinking early are much more likely to become dependent on alcohol. Indeed, the probability of lifetime alcohol dependence
decreases approximately 14 percent with each additional
year of age at which alcohol is first used. Grant & Dawson,
Age at Onset of Alcohol Use and its Association with
DSM-IV Alcohol Abuse and Dependence, 9 J. Substance
Abuse 103, 108 (1997). And obviously the effects of underage drinking are irreversible for the nearly 1,700 Americans
killed each year by teenage drunk drivers. See National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 1998 Youth Fatal
Crash and Alcohol Facts.

Respondents have identified no principle of law or logic
that would preclude the imposition of restrictions on fast
food and alcohol advertising similar to those they seek to
impose on tobacco advertising. Cf. Tr. of Oral Arg. 56-57.
In effect, they seek a "vice" exception to the First Amendment. No such exception exists. See 44 Liquormart, 517
U. S., at 513-514 (opinion of Stevens, J., joined by Kennedy, Thomas, and Ginsburg, JJ.). If it did, it would have
almost no limit, for "any product that poses some threat to

public health or public morals might reasonably be character-ized by a state legislature as relating to `vice activity.' " Id.,

at 514. That is why "a `vice' label that is unaccompanied bya corresponding prohibition against the commercial behavior
at issue fails to provide a principled justification for the regu-lation of commercial speech about that activity." Ibid.

No legislature has ever sought to restrict speech about anactivity it regarded as harmless and inoffensive. Calls for
limits on expression always are made when the specter ofsome threatened harm is looming. The identity of the harm
may vary. People will be inspired by totalitarian dogmasand subvert the Republic. They will be inflamed by racial
demagoguery and embrace hatred and bigotry. Or they willbe enticed by cigarette advertisements and choose to smoke,
risking disease. It is therefore no answer for the State tosay that the makers of cigarettes are doing harm: perhaps
they are. But in that respect they are no different fromthe purveyors of other harmful products, or the advocates of
harmful ideas. When the State seeks to silence them, theyare all entitled to the protection of the First Amendment.

involving the First Amendment--is more complex. BecauseI strongly disagree with the Court's conclusion that the

Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act of 1965(FCLAA or Act), 15 U. S. C. $ 1331 et seq., as amended, precludes States and localities from regulating the location ofcigarette advertising, I dissent from Parts II-A and II-B
of the Court's opinion. On the First Amendment questions,I agree with the Court both that the outdoor advertising
restrictions imposed by Massachusetts serve legitimate andimportant state interests and that the record does not indicate that the measures were properly tailored to serve thoseinterests. Because the present record does not enable us to
adjudicate the merits of those claims on summary judgment,I would vacate the decision upholding those restrictions and
remand for trial on the constitutionality of the outdoor ad-vertising regulations. Finally, because I do not believe that
either the point-of-sale advertising restrictions or the salespractice restrictions implicate significant First Amendment
concerns, I would uphold them in their entirety.

As the majority acknowledges, ante, at 541-542, underprevailing principles, any examination of the scope of a preemption provision must " `start with the assumption that thehistoric police powers of the States [are] not to be superseded by . . . Federal Act unless that [is] the clear and mani-fest purpose of Congress.' "

issue in this suit implicate two powers that lie at the heartof the States' traditional police power--the power to regulate land usage and the power to protect the health andsafety of minors--our precedents require that the Court construe the pre-emption provision "narrow[ly]." Id., at 485;

see also Cipollone, 505 U. S., at 518. If Congress' intent topre-empt a particular category of regulation is ambiguous,

such regulations are not pre-empted.1The text of the pre-emption provision must be viewed in
context, with proper attention paid to the history, structure,and purpose of the regulatory scheme in which it appears.
See, e. g., Medtronic, 518 U. S., at 484-486; New York State
Conference of Blue Cross & Blue Shield Plans v. TravelersIns. Co., 514 U. S. 645, 655-656 (1995); Cipollone, 505 U. S.,

at 513-515, 519-520, 529, 530, n. 27; accord, ante, at 542.2An assessment of the scope of a pre-emption provision must
give effect to a "reasoned understanding of the way in whichCongress intended the statute and its surrounding regulatory scheme to affect business, consumers, and the law."Medtronic, 518 U. S., at 486.

This task, properly performed, leads inexorably to the con-clusion that Congress did not intend to pre-empt state and
local regulations of the location of cigarette advertising whenit adopted the provision at issue in this suit. In both 1965
and 1969, Congress made clear the purposes of its regulatory

congressional mandate to that effect"); Cipollone, 505 U. S., at 533 (Blackmun, J., joined by Kennedy and Souter, JJ., concurring in part, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part) ("The principles of federalism and respect for state sovereignty that underlie the Court's

Opinion of Stevens, J.
endeavor, explaining with precision the federal policies moti-vating its actions. According to the Acts, Congress adopted

a "comprehensive Federal Program to deal with cigarettelabeling and advertising with respect to any relationship between smoking and health," for two reasons: (1) to informthe public that smoking may be hazardous to health and (2)
to ensure that commerce and the interstate economy not be
"impeded by diverse, nonuniform, and confusing cigarette la-beling and advertising regulations with respect to any relationship between smoking and health." 15 U. S. C. $ 1331.In order to serve the second purpose it was necessary to
pre-empt state regulation of the content of both cigarette
labels and cigarette advertising. If one State required the
inclusion of a particular warning on the package of cigarettes
while another State demanded a different formulation, cigarette manufacturers would have been forced into the difficult
and costly practice of producing different packaging for use
in different States. To foreclose the waste of resources that
would be entailed by such a patchwork regulatory system,
Congress expressly precluded other regulators from requiring the placement on cigarette packaging of any "statement
relating to smoking and health." $ 1334(a). Similar concerns applied to cigarette advertising. If different regulatory bodies required that different warnings or statements
be used when cigarette manufacturers advertised their products, the text and layout of a company's ads would have had
to differ from locale to locale. The resulting costs would
have come with little or no health benefit. Moreover, given
the nature of publishing, it might well have been the case
that cigarette companies would not have been able to advertise in national publications without violating the laws of
some jurisdictions. In response to these concerns, Congress
adopted a parallel provision pre-empting state and local regulations requiring inclusion in cigarette advertising of any
"statement relating to smoking and health." $ 1334(b) (1970
ed.) (amended 1970).

594 LORILLARD TOBACCO CO. v. REILLY

Opinion of Stevens, J.
There was, however, no need to interfere with state or
local zoning laws or other regulations prescribing limitations
on the location of signs or billboards. Laws prohibiting a
cigarette company from hanging a billboard near a school in
Boston in no way conflict with laws permitting the hanging
of such a billboard in other jurisdictions. Nor would such
laws even impose a significant administrative burden on
would-be advertisers, as the great majority of localities impose general restrictions on signage, thus requiring advertisers to examine local law before posting signs whether or not
cigarette-specific laws are pre-empted. See Greater N. Y.
Metropolitan Food Council, Inc. v. Giuliani, 195 F. 3d 100,
109 (CA2 1999) ("Divergent local zoning restrictions on the
location of sign advertising are a commonplace feature of the
national landscape and cigarette advertisers have always
been bound to observe them"). Hence, it is unsurprising
that Congress did not include any provision in the 1965 Act
pre-empting location restrictions.

The Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969 (1969
Act), $ 2, 84 Stat. 87, made two important changes in the
pre-emption provision. First, it limited the applicability of
the advertising prong to States and localities, paving the
way for further federal regulation of cigarette advertising.
FCLAA, $ 4. Second, it expanded the scope of the advertising pre-emption provision. Where previously States were
prohibited from requiring particular statements in cigarette
advertising based on health concerns, they would henceforth
be prohibited from imposing any "requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health . . . with respect to the
advertising or promotion" of cigarettes. $ 5(b), 15 U. S. C.

$ 1334(b).3

3 In Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U. S. 504, 521 (1992), we held
that one of the consequences of this change in language was that after
1969 the statute pre-empts some common-law actions.

Opinion of Stevens, J.
Ripped from its context, this provision could theoreticallybe read as a breathtaking expansion of the limitations imposed by the 1965 Act. However, both our precedents andcommon sense require us to read statutory provisions--and,
in particular, pre-emption clauses--in the context of boththeir neighboring provisions and of the history and purpose
of the statutory scheme. See supra, at 592. When soviewed, it is quite clear that the 1969 amendments were intended to expand the provision to capture a narrow set ofcontent regulations that would have escaped pre-emption
under the prior provision, not to fundamentally reorder thedivision of regulatory authority between the Federal and
State Governments.All signs point inescapably to the conclusion that Congress
only intended to pre-empt content regulations in the 1969Act. It is of crucial importance that, in making modifications of the pre-emption provision, Congress did not alterthe statement laying out the federal policies the provision
was intended to serve. See 15 U. S. C. $ 1331. To this day,the stated federal policies in this area are (1) to inform the
public of the dangers of cigarette smoking and (2) to protectthe cigarette companies from the burdens of confusing and
contradictory state regulations of their labels and advertise-ments. See ibid. The retention of this provision unchanged is strong evidence that Congress' only intention inexpanding the pre-emption clause was to capture forms of
content regulation that had fallen through the cracks of theprior provision--for example, state laws prohibiting cigarette manufacturers from making particular claims in theiradvertising or requiring them to utilize specified layouts or
include particular graphics in their marketing.4

4 Because of the nature of magazine publishing and distribution, it is
conceivable that a State or locality might cause the kind of regulatory
confusion the statute was drafted to prevent by adopting a law prohibiting
the advertising of cigarettes in any publication distributed within its

596 LORILLARD TOBACCO CO. v. REILLY

Opinion of Stevens, J.
The legislative history of the provision also supports sucha reading. The record does not contain any evidence that

Congress intended to expand the scope of pre-emption be-yond content restrictions.

5 To the contrary, the Senate Report makes it clear that the changes merely "clarified" thescope of the original provision. S. Rep. No. 91-566, p. 12

(1969). Even as amended, Congress perceived the provisionas "narrowly phrased" and emphasized that its purpose is
to "avoid the chaos created by a multiplicity of conflictingregulations."

Ibid. According to the Senate Report, thechanges "in no way affect the power of any state or political

subdivision of any state with respect to . . . the sale ofcigarettes to minors . . . or similar police regulations."
Ibid.In analyzing the scope of the pre-emption provision, the
Courts of Appeals have almost uniformly concluded thatstate and local laws regulating the location of billboards and
signs are not pre-empted. See Consolidated Cigar Corp. v.
Reilly, 218 F. 3d 30, 39-41 (CA1 2000) (case below); GreaterNew York Metropolitan Food Council, Inc. v. Giuliani, 195

F. 3d 100, 104-110 (CA2 1999); Federation of AdvertisingIndustry Representatives, Inc. v. Chicago, 189 F. 3d 633,

boundaries. There is at least a modicum of support for the suggestion
that Congress may have intended the pre-emption of such restrictions.
See id., at 515, n. 11 (noting that California was considering such a ban at
the time Congress was considering the 1969 Act). However, the concerns
posed by the diverse regulation of national publications are not present
with regard to the local regulation of the location of signs and billboards.

5 At one point, the Court briefly argues that it would be wrong to conclude that Congress intended to preclude only content restrictions, because it imposed a location restriction (a ban on television and radio advertising) in another provision of the same bill. See ante, at 548-549. This
argument is something of a non sequitur. The fact that Congress, in
adopting a comprehensive legislative package, chose to impose a federal
location restriction for a national medium has no bearing on whether, in a
separate provision, the Legislature intended to strip States and localities
of the authority to impose location restrictions for purely local advertising media.

636-640 (CA7 1999); Penn Advertising of Baltimore, Inc. v.Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, 63 F. 3d 1318 (CA4

1995); contra, Lindsey v. Tacoma-Pierce Cty. Health Dept.,195 F. 3d 1065 (CA9 1999). The decisions in those cases
relied heavily upon our discussion of the same pre-emptionprovision in Cipollone, 505 U. S., at 515-524. In Cipollone,
while the Members of the Court expressed three differentopinions concerning the scope of pre-emption mandated by
the provision, those differences related entirely to which, ifany, of the plaintiff 's claims based on the

content of the de-fendants' advertising were pre-empted by $ 5. Nary a word

in any of the three Cipollone opinions supports the thesisthat $ 5 should be interpreted to pre-empt state regulation
of the location of signs advertising cigarettes. Indeed,seven of the nine Justices subscribed to opinions that explicitly tethered the scope of the pre-emption provision to Con-gress' concern with "diverse, nonuniform, and confusing cigarette labeling and advertising regulations." Id., at 519; id.,at 534, 541 (opinion of Blackmun, J., joined by

Kennedy and
Souter, JJ.).I am firmly convinced that, when Congress amended the

pre-emption provision in 1969, it did not intend to expandthe application of the provision beyond content regulations.

No. 00-596, p. 22, and thus is a de facto regulation of the content of cigarette ads. But we need not consider today the circumstances in which
location restrictions approximating a total ban might constitute regulation
of content and thus be pre-empted by the Act, because petitioners have
failed to introduce sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue as to that
claim. Petitioners introduced maps purporting to show that cigarette advertising is barred in 90.6% of Boston proper, 87.8% of Worcester, and
88.8% of Springfield. See App. 165-167. But the maps do not distinguish between the area restricted due to the regulation at issue here and
the area restricted due to pre-existing regulations, such as general zoning
requirements applicable to all outdoor advertising. Nor do the maps
show the percentage (with respect to either area or population) of the
State that is off limits to cigarette advertising; they cover only three cities

Opinion of Stevens, J.
I, therefore, find the conclusion inescapable that the zoning
regulation at issue in this suit is not a "requirement or
prohibition . . . with respect to . . . advertising" within the
meaning of the 1969 Act.7 Even if I were not so convinced,
however, I would still dissent from the Court's conclusion
with regard to pre-emption, because the provision is, at the
very least, ambiguous. The historical record simply does
not reflect that it was Congress' " `clear and manifest purpose,' " id., at 516, to pre-empt attempts by States to utilize
their traditional zoning authority to protect the health and
welfare of minors. Absent such a manifest purpose, Massachusetts and its sister States retain their traditional police
powers.8

containing approximately 14% of the State's population. See U. S. Census
Bureau, Statistical Abstract of the United States 28, 47, 49 (1999) (providing population figures for 1998). The area in which cigarette advertising
is restricted is likely to be considerably less in less densely populated
portions of the State. And even on the interpretation of this data most
favorable to petitioners, the Massachusetts regulation still permits indoor
and outdoor cigarette advertising in at least 10% of the geographical area
of the State. In short, the regulation here is not the equivalent of a total
ban on cigarette advertising.

7 Hence, while I agree in large part with the substance of the arguments

proffered by the respondents and the United States on the pre-emption
issue, I reject their conclusion that the content/location distinction finds
expression in the limiting phrase "based on smoking and health." See
Brief for Respondents 20; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 5;
accord, Penn Advertising of Baltimore, Inc. v. Mayor and City Council
of Baltimore, 63 F. 3d 1318 (CA4 1995). Instead, I would follow the First,
Second, and Seventh Circuits in concluding that a statute regulating the
location of advertising is not a "requirement or prohibition . . . with respect to . . . advertising" within the meaning of the 1969 Act. See Consolidated Cigar Corp. v. Reilly, 218 F. 3d 30, 39-41 (CA1 2000) (case below);
Greater N. Y. Metropolitan Food Council, Inc. v. Giuliani, 195 F. 3d 100,
104-110 (CA2 1999); Federation of Advertising Industry Representatives,
Inc. v. Chicago, 189 F. 3d 633, 636-640 (CA7 1999).

8 The Court's holding that federal law precludes States and localities

from protecting children from dangerous products within 1,000 feet of a
school is particularly ironic given the Court's conclusion six years ago that

Opinion of Stevens, J.

II
On the First Amendment issues raised by petitioners, mydisagreements with the majority are less significant. I

would, however, reach different dispositions as to the 1,000-foot rule and the height restrictions for indoor advertising,
and my evaluation of the sales practice restrictions differsfrom the Court's.

The 1,000-Foot RuleI am in complete accord with the Court's analysis of the
importance of the interests served by the advertising re-strictions. As the Court lucidly explains, few interests are
more "compelling," ante, at 564, than ensuring that minorsdo not become addicted to a dangerous drug before they are
able to make a mature and informed decision as to the healthrisks associated with that substance. Unlike other products
sold for human consumption, tobacco products are addictiveand ultimately lethal for many long-term users. When that
interest is combined with the State's concomitant concern forthe effective enforcement of its laws regarding the sale of
tobacco to minors, it becomes clear that Massachusetts' regu-lations serve interests of the highest order and are, therefore, immune from any ends-based challenge, whatever levelof scrutiny one chooses to employ.

Nevertheless, noble ends do not save a speech-restrictingstatute whose means are poorly tailored. Such statutes

the Federal Government lacks the constitutional authority to impose a
similarly motivated ban. See United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549 (1995).
Despite the absence of any identified federal interest in creating "an invisible federal zone extending 1,000 feet beyond the (often irregular) boundaries of the school property," as the majority construes it today, the "statute now before us forecloses the States from experimenting and exercising
their own judgment in an area to which States lay claim by right of history
and expertise," id., at 583 (Kennedy, J., concurring). I wonder why a
Court sensitive to federalism concerns would adopt such a strange construction of statutory language whose quite different purpose Congress
took pains to explain.

600 LORILLARD TOBACCO CO. v. REILLY

Opinion of Stevens, J.
may be invalid for two different reasons. First, the means
chosen may be insufficiently related to the ends they purportedly serve. See, e. g., Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 514
U. S. 476 (1995) (striking a statute prohibiting beer labels
from displaying alcohol content because the provision did not
significantly forward the government's interest in the health,
safety, and welfare of its citizens). Alternatively, the statute may be so broadly drawn that, while effectively achieving its ends, it unduly restricts communications that are
unrelated to its policy aims. See, e. g., United States v.
Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc., 529 U. S. 803, 812 (2000)
(striking a statute intended to protect children from indecent
television broadcasts, in part because it constituted "a significant restriction of communication between speakers and
willing adult listeners"). The second difficulty is most frequently encountered when government adopts measures
for the protection of children that impose substantial restrictions on the ability of adults to communicate with one
another. See, e. g., Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc.,
supra; Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U. S.
844 (1997); Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492
U. S. 115 (1989).

To my mind, the 1,000-foot rule does not present a tailoring problem of the first type. For reasons cogently explained in our prior opinions and in the opinion of the Court,
we may fairly assume that advertising stimulates consumption and, therefore, that regulations limiting advertising will
facilitate efforts to stem consumption.9 See, e. g., Rubin,
514 U. S., at 487; United States v. Edge Broadcasting Co.,
509 U. S. 418, 434 (1993); ante, at 557. Furthermore, if the
government's intention is to limit consumption by a particular segment of the community--in this case, minors--it is

9 Moreover, even if it were our practice to require a particularized showing of the effects of advertising on consumption, the respondents have met
that burden in this suit. See ante, at 557-561 (summarizing the evidence).

Opinion of Stevens, J.
appropriate, indeed necessary, to tailor advertising restric-tions to the areas where that segment of the community congregates--in this case, the area surrounding schools andplaygrounds.

However, I share the majority's concern as to whether the1,000-foot rule unduly restricts the ability of cigarette manufacturers to convey lawful information to adult consumers.
This, of course, is a question of line-drawing. While a banon all communications about a given subject would be the

most effective way to prevent children from exposure to suchmaterial, the State cannot by fiat reduce the level of discourse to that which is "fit for children." Butler v. Michigan, 352 U. S. 380, 383 (1957); cf. Bolger v. Youngs Drug
Products Corp., 463 U. S. 60, 74 (1983) ("The level of discourse reaching a mailbox simply cannot be limited to that
which would be suitable for a sandbox"). On the other hand,
efforts to protect children from exposure to harmful material
will undoubtedly have some spillover effect on the free
speech rights of adults. See, e. g., FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U. S. 726, 749-750, and n. 28 (1978).

Finding the appropriate balance is no easy matter.
Though many factors plausibly enter the equation when calculating whether a child-directed location restriction goes
too far in regulating adult speech, one crucial question is
whether the regulatory scheme leaves available sufficient
"alternative avenues of communication." Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U. S. 41, 50 (1986); Members of City
Council of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U. S.
789, 819 (1984) (Brennan, J., dissenting); accord, ante, at 563.
Because I do not think the record contains sufficient information to enable us to answer that question, I would vacate the
award of summary judgment upholding the 1,000-foot rule
and remand for trial on that issue. Therefore, while I agree
with the majority that the Court of Appeals did not sufficiently consider the implications of the 1,000-foot rule for
the lawful communication of adults, see ante, at 561-566,

602 LORILLARD TOBACCO CO. v. REILLY

Opinion of Stevens, J.
I dissent from the disposition reflected in Part III-B-2 ofthe Court's opinion.

There is no doubt that the 1,000-foot rule prohibits ciga-rette advertising in a substantial portion of Massachusetts'
largest cities. Even on that question, however, the partiesremain in dispute as to the percentage of these urban areas
that is actually off limits to tobacco advertising. See ante,at 562. Moreover, the record is entirely silent on the impact
of the regulation in other portions of the Commonwealth.The dearth of reliable statistical information as to the scope
of the ban is problematic.More importantly, the Court lacks sufficient qualitative information as to the areas where cigarette advertising is pro-hibited and those where it is permitted. The fact that 80%
or 90% of an urban area is unavailable to tobacco advertise-ments may be constitutionally irrelevant if the available
areas are so heavily trafficked or so central to the city's cul-tural life that they provide a sufficient forum for the propagation of a manufacturer's message. One electric sign inTimes Square or at the foot of the Golden Gate Bridge may
be seen by more potential customers than a hundred signsdispersed in residential neighborhoods.

Finally, the Court lacks information as to other avenuesof communication available to cigarette manufacturers and
retailers. For example, depending on the answers to empir-ical questions on which we lack data, the ubiquity of print
advertisements hawking particular brands of cigarettesmight suffice to inform adult consumers of the special advantages of the respective brands. Similarly, print advertise-ments, circulars mailed to people's homes, word of mouth,
and general information may or may not be sufficient toimbue the adult population with the knowledge that particular stores, chains of stores, or types of stores sell tobaccoproducts.

10

10 As the above observations indicate, the analysis as to whether the
1,000-foot rule impermissibly curtails speech between adults will require
a particularized analysis that may well ask slightly different questions--

603Cite as: 533 U. S. 525 (2001)
Opinion of Stevens, J.
In granting summary judgment for the respondents, theDistrict Judge treated the First Amendment issues in this

suit as pure questions of law and stated that "there areno material facts in dispute concerning these issues." 84
F. Supp. 2d 180, 183 (Mass. 2000). With due respect, Idisagree. While the ultimate question before us is one of
law, the answer to that question turns on complicated factual
questions relating to the practical effects of the regulations.
As the record does not reveal the answer to these disputed
questions of fact, the court should have denied summary
judgment to both parties and allowed the parties to present
further evidence.

I note, moreover, that the alleged "overinclusivity" of the
advertising regulations, ante, at 578 (Thomas, J., concurring
in part and concurring in judgment), while relevant to whether
the regulations are narrowly tailored, does not "beli[e]" the
claim that tobacco advertising imagery misleads children
into believing that smoking is healthy, glamorous, or sophisticated, ibid. See Brief for American Legacy Foundation as
Amicus Curiae 4-5, and nn. 9, 10; Brief for City of Los
Angeles et al. as Amici Curiae 4 (documenting charge that
advertisements for cigarettes and smokeless tobacco target
underage smokers). For purposes of summary judgment,
the State conceded that the tobacco companies' advertising
concerns lawful activity and is not misleading. Under the
Court's disposition of the cases today, the State remains free
to proffer evidence that the advertising is in fact misleading.
See Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U. S. 748, 771 (1976) ("[M]uch commercial speech is not provably false, or even wholly false, but
only deceptive or misleading. We foresee no obstacle to a
State's dealing effectively with this problem"). I would vacate the grant of summary judgment to respondents on this
issue and remand for further proceedings.

and conceivably could reach different results--with regard to the constitutionality of the restrictions as applied to manufacturers and retailers.

604 LORILLARD TOBACCO CO. v. REILLY

Opinion of Stevens, J.
The Sales Practice and Indoor Advertising RestrictionsAfter addressing petitioners' challenge to the sales practice restrictions imposed by the Massachusetts statute, theCourt concluded that these provisions did not violate the
First Amendment. I concur in that judgment, but writeseparately on this issue to make two brief points.

First, I agree with the District Court and the Court ofAppeals that the sales practice restrictions are best analyzed
as regulating conduct, not speech. See 218 F. 3d, at 53.While the decision how to display one's products no doubt
serves a marginal communicative function, the same can besaid of virtually any human activity performed with the hope
or intention of evoking the interest of others. This Courthas long recognized the need to differentiate between legislation that targets expression and legislation that targetsconduct for legitimate non-speech-related reasons but imposes an incidental burden on expression. See, e. g., United
States v. O'Brien, 391 U. S. 367 (1968). However difficultthat line may be to draw, it seems clear to me that laws

requiring that stores maintain items behind counters andprohibiting self-service displays fall squarely on the conduct
side of the line. Restrictions as to the accessibility of dan-gerous or legally restricted products are a common feature
of the regulatory regime governing American retail stores.I see nothing the least bit constitutionally problematic in requiring individuals to ask for the assistance of a salesclerkin order to examine or purchase a handgun, a bottle of penicillin, or a package of cigarettes.Second, though I admit the question is closer, I would, for
similar reasons, uphold the regulation limiting tobacco ad-vertising in certain retail establishments to the space five
feet or more above the floor.11 When viewed in isolation,this provision appears to target speech. Further, to the ex11 This ban only applies to stores located within 1,000 feet of a school or
playground and contains an exception for adult-only establishments. See
ante, at 535, 536.

Opinion of Stevens, J.
tent that it does target speech it may well run into constitu-tional problems, as the connection between the ends the statute purports to serve and the means it has chosen aredubious. Nonetheless, I am ultimately persuaded that the
provision is unobjectionable because it is little more than anadjunct to the other sales practice restrictions. As the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts can properly legislate theplacement of products and the nature of displays in its convenience stores, I would not draw a distinction between suchrestrictions and height restrictions on related product advertising. I would accord the Commonwealth some latitude inimposing restrictions that can have only the slightest impact
on the ability of adults to purchase a poisonous product andmay save some children from taking the first step on the
road to addiction. III

Because I strongly disagree with the Court's conclusion onthe pre-emption issue, I dissent from Parts II-A and II-B of
its opinion. Though I agree with much of what the Courthas to say about the First Amendment, I ultimately disagree
with its disposition or its reasoning on each of the regula-tions before us.

12

12 Reflecting my partial agreement with the Court, I join Parts I, II-C,
II-D, and III-B-1 and concur in the judgment reflected in Part III-D.

PALAZZOLO v. RHODE ISLAND et al.
certiorari to the supreme court of rhode island

No. 99-2047. Argued February 26, 2001--Decided June 28, 2001
In order to acquire the waterfront parcel of Rhode Island land that is here

at issue, petitioner and associates formed Shore Gardens, Inc. (SGI),
in 1959. After SGI purchased the property petitioner bought out his
associates and became the sole shareholder. Most of the property was
then, and is now, salt marsh subject to tidal flooding. The wet ground
and permeable soil would require considerable fill before significant
structures could be built. Over the years, SGI's intermittent applications to develop the property were rejected by various government
agencies. After 1966, no further applications were made for over a decade. Two intervening events, however, become important to the issues
presented. First, in 1971, the State created respondent Rhode Island
Coastal Resources Management Council (Council) and charged it with
protecting the State's coastal properties. The Council's regulations,
known as the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Program
(CRMP), designated salt marshes like those on SGI's property as protected "coastal wetlands" on which development is greatly limited.
Second, in 1978, SGI's corporate charter was revoked, and title to the
property passed to petitioner as the corporation's sole shareholder. In
1983, petitioner applied to the Council for permission to construct a
wooden bulkhead and fill his entire marshland area. The Council rejected the application, concluding, inter alia, that it would conflict with
the CRMP. In 1985, petitioner filed a new application with the Council,
seeking permission to fill 11 of the property's 18 wetland acres in order
to build a private beach club. The Council rejected this application as
well, ruling that the proposal did not satisfy the standards for obtaining
a "special exception" to fill salt marsh, whereby the proposed activity
must serve a compelling public purpose. Subsequently, petitioner filed
an inverse condemnation action in Rhode Island Superior Court, asserting that the State's wetlands regulations, as applied by the Council to
his parcel, had taken the property without compensation in violation of
the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The suit alleged the Council's
action deprived him of "all economically beneficial use" of his property,
resulting in a total taking requiring compensation under Lucas v. South
Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U. S. 1003, and sought $3,150,000 in damages, a figure derived from an appraiser's estimate as to the value of a
74-lot residential subdivision on the property. The court ruled against

Syllabus
petitioner, and the State Supreme Court affirmed, holding that (1) petitioner's takings claim was not ripe; (2) he had no right to challenge
regulations predating 1978, when he succeeded to legal ownership of the
property; (3) he could not assert a takings claim based on the denial of
all economic use of his property in light of undisputed evidence that he
had $200,000 in development value remaining on an upland parcel of the
property; and (4) because the regulation at issue predated his acquisition
of title, he could have had no reasonable investment-backed expectation
that he could develop his property, and, therefore, he could not recover
under Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City, 438 U. S. 104, 124.

Held:

1. This case is ripe for review. Pp. 617-626.

(a) A takings claim challenging application of land-use regulations
is not ripe unless the agency charged with implementing the regulations
has reached a final decision regarding their application to the property
at issue. Williamson County Regional Planning Comm'n v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, 473 U. S. 172, 186. A final decision does
not occur until the responsible agency determines the extent of permitted development on the land. MacDonald, Sommer & Frates v. Yolo
County, 477 U. S. 340, 351. Petitioner obtained such a final decision
when the Council denied his 1983 and 1985 applications. The State Supreme Court erred in ruling that, notwithstanding those denials, doubt
remained as to the extent of development the Council would allow on
petitioner's parcel due to his failure to explore other uses for the property that would involve filling substantially less wetlands. This is belied by the unequivocal nature of the wetland regulations at issue and
by the Council's application of the regulations to the subject property.
The CRMP permits the Council to grant a special exception to engage
in a prohibited use only where a "compelling public purpose" is served.
The proposal to fill the entire property was not accepted under Council
regulations and did not qualify for the special exception. The Council
determined the use proposed in the second application (the beach club)
did not satisfy the "compelling public purpose" standard. There is no
indication the Council would have accepted the application had the proposed club occupied a smaller surface area. To the contrary, it ruled
that the proposed activity was not a "compelling public purpose." Although a landowner may not establish a taking before the land-use authority has the opportunity, using its own reasonable procedures, to decide and explain the reach of a challenged regulation, e. g., MacDonald,
supra, at 342, once it becomes clear that the permissible uses of the
property are known to a reasonable degree of certainty, a takings claim
is likely to have ripened. Here, the Council's decisions make plain that

533US2 Unit: $U85 [10-19-02 15:38:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN
608 PALAZZOLO v. RHODE ISLAND

Syllabus
it interpreted its regulations to bar petitioner from engaging in any
filling or development on the wetlands. Further permit applications
were not necessary to establish this point. Pp. 618-621.

(b) Contrary to the State Supreme Court's ruling, petitioner's claim
is not unripe by virtue of his failure to seek permission for a use of the
property that would involve development only of its upland portion. It
is true that there was uncontested testimony that an upland site would
have an estimated value of $200,000 if developed. And, while the
CRMP requires Council approval to develop upland property lying
within 200 feet of protected waters, the strict "compelling public purpose" test does not govern proposed land uses on property in this classification. Council officials testified at trial, moreover, that they would
have allowed petitioner to build a residence on the upland parcel. Nevertheless, this Court's ripeness jurisprudence requires petitioner to explore development opportunities on his upland parcel only if there is
uncertainty as to the land's permitted use. The State's assertion that
the uplands' value is in doubt comes too late for the litigation before
this Court. It was stated in the certiorari petition that the uplands
were worth an estimated $200,000. The figure not only was uncontested but also was cited as fact in the State's brief in opposition. In
this circumstance ripeness cannot be contested by saying that the value
of the nonwetland parcels is unknown. See Lucas, supra, at 1020,
and n. 9. Nor is there genuine ambiguity in the record as to the extent
of permitted development on petitioner's property, either on the wetlands or the uplands. Pp. 621-624.

(c) Nor is petitioner's takings claim rendered unripe, as the State
Supreme Court held, by his failure to apply for permission to develop
the 74-lot subdivision that was the basis for the damages sought in his
inverse condemnation suit. It is difficult to see how this concern is
relevant to the inquiry at issue here. The Council informed petitioner
that he could not fill the wetlands; it follows of necessity that he could
not fill and then build 74 single-family dwellings there. Petitioner's
submission of this proposal would not have clarified the extent of development permitted by the wetlands regulations, which is the inquiry required under the Court's ripeness decisions. Pp. 624-626.

2. Petitioner's acquisition of title after the regulations' effective date
did not bar his takings claims. This Court rejects the State Supreme
Court's sweeping rule that a purchaser or a successive title holder like
petitioner is deemed to have notice of an earlier-enacted restriction and
is barred from claiming that it effects a taking. Were the Court to
accept that rule, the postenactment transfer of title would absolve the
State of its obligation to defend any action restricting land use, no matter how extreme or unreasonable. A State would be allowed, in effect,
to put an expiration date on the Takings Clause. This ought not to be

609Cite as: 533 U. S. 606 (2001)
Syllabus
the rule. Future generations, too, have a right to challenge unreasonable limitations on the use and value of land. The State's notice justification does not take into account the effect on owners at the time of
enactment, who are prejudiced as well. Should an owner attempt to
challenge a new regulation, but not survive the process of ripening his
or her claim (which, as this case demonstrates, will often take years),
under the State's rule the right to compensation may not be asserted
by an heir or successor, and so may not be asserted at all. The State's
rule also would work a critical alteration to the nature of property, as
the newly regulated landowner is stripped of the ability to transfer the
interest which was possessed prior to the regulation. The State may
not by this means secure a windfall for itself. See, e. g., Webb's Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc. v. Beckwith, 449 U. S. 155, 164. The rule is, furthermore, capricious in effect. The young owner contrasted with the
older owner, the owner with the resources to hold contrasted with the
owner with the need to sell, would be in different positions. The Takings Clause is not so quixotic. A blanket rule that purchasers with
notice have no compensation right when a claim becomes ripe is too
blunt an instrument to accord with the duty to compensate for what is
taken. Nollan v. California Coastal Comm'n, 483 U. S. 825, 834, n. 2,
is controlling precedent for the Court's conclusion. Lucas, 505 U. S., at
1029, did not overrule Nollan, which is based on essential Takings
Clause principles. On remand the state court must address the merits
of petitioner's Penn Central claim, which is not barred by the mere fact
that his title was acquired after the effective date of the state-imposed
restriction. Pp. 626-630.

3. The State Supreme Court did not err in finding that petitioner
failed to establish a deprivation of all economic use, for it is undisputed
that his parcel retains significant development value. Petitioner is correct that, assuming a taking is otherwise established, a State may not
evade the duty to compensate on the premise that the landowner is left
with a token interest. This is not the situation in this case, however.
A regulation permitting a landowner to build a substantial residence on
an 18-acre parcel does not leave the property "economically idle."
Lucas, supra, at 1019. Petitioner attempts to revive this part of his
claim by arguing, for the first time, that the upland parcel is distinct
from the wetlands portions, so he should be permitted to assert a deprivation limited to the latter. The Court will not explore the point here.
Petitioner did not press the argument in the state courts, and the issue
was not presented in his certiorari petition. The case comes to the
Court on the premise that petitioner's entire parcel serves as the basis
for his takings claim, and, so framed, the total deprivation argument
fails. Pp. 630-632.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.
Petitioner Anthony Palazzolo owns a waterfront parcel ofland in the town of Westerly, Rhode Island. Almost all of

the property is designated as coastal wetlands under RhodeIsland law. After petitioner's development proposals were
rejected by respondent Rhode Island Coastal ResourcesManagement Council (Council), he sued in state court, asserting the Council's application of its wetlands regulationstook the property without compensation in violation of the
Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment, binding uponthe State through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment. Petitioner sought review in this Court,contending the Supreme Court of Rhode Island erred in rejecting his takings claim. We granted certiorari. 531 U. S.923 (2000).

612 PALAZZOLO v. RHODE ISLAND

Opinion of the Court
Island and Connecticut. Situated on land purchased fromthe Narragansett Indian Tribe, the town was incorporated

in 1669 and had a precarious, though colorful, early his-tory. Both Connecticut and Massachusetts contested the
boundaries--and indeed the validity--of Rhode Island'sroyal charter; and Westerly's proximity to Connecticut invited encroachments during these jurisdictional squabbles.See M. Best, The Town that Saved a State--Westerly 60-83
(1943); see also W. McLoughlin, Rhode Island: A BicentennialHistory 39-57 (1978). When the borders of the Rhode
Island Colony were settled by compact in 1728, the town'sdevelopment was more orderly, and with some historical
distinction. For instance, Watch Hill Point, the peninsulaat the southwestern tip of the town, was of strategic importance in the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812. SeeBest,

supra, at 190; F. Denison, Westerly and its Witnesses118-119 (1878).

In later times Westerly's coastal location had a new sig-nificance: It became a popular vacation and seaside destination. One of the town's historians gave this happy account:

"After the Civil War the rapid growth of manufactureand expansion of trade had created a spending class on

pleasure bent, and Westerly had superior attractions tooffer, surf bathing on ocean beaches, quieter bathing in
salt and fresh water ponds, fishing, annual sail and latermotor boat races. The broad beaches of clean white
sand dip gently toward the sea; there are no odorousmarshes at low tide, no railroad belches smoke, and the
climate is unrivalled on the coast, that of Newport onlyexcepted. In the phenomenal heat wave of 1881 ocean
resorts from northern New England to southern NewJersey sweltered as the thermometer climbed to 95 and
104 degrees, while Watch Hill enjoyed a comfortable 80.When Providence to the north runs a temperature of 90,
the mercury in this favored spot remains at 77." Best,
supra, at 192.

Opinion of the Court
Westerly today has about 20,000 year-round residents, andthousands of summer visitors come to enjoy its beaches and

coastal advantages.One of the more popular attractions is Misquamicut State
Beach, a lengthy expanse of coastline facing Block IslandSound and beyond to the Atlantic Ocean. The primary point
of access to the beach is Atlantic Avenue, a well-traveled
3-mile stretch of road running along the coastline within thetown's limits. At its western end, Atlantic Avenue is something of a commercial strip, with restaurants, hotels, arcades,and other typical seashore businesses. The pattern of development becomes more residential as the road winds eastward onto a narrow spine of land bordered to the south by
the beach and the ocean, and to the north by Winnapaug
Pond, an intertidal inlet often used by residents for boating,
fishing, and shellfishing.

In 1959 petitioner, a lifelong Westerly resident, decided
to invest in three undeveloped, adjoining parcels along this
eastern stretch of Atlantic Avenue. To the north, the property faces, and borders upon, Winnapaug Pond; the south of
the property faces Atlantic Avenue and the beachfront
homes abutting it on the other side, and beyond that the
dunes and the beach. To purchase and hold the property,
petitioner and associates formed Shore Gardens, Inc. (SGI).
After SGI purchased the property petitioner bought out his
associates and became the sole shareholder. In the first decade of SGI's ownership of the property the corporation submitted a plat to the town subdividing the property into 80
lots; and it engaged in various transactions that left it with
74 lots, which together encompassed about 20 acres. During
the same period SGI also made initial attempts to develop
the property and submitted intermittent applications to
state agencies to fill substantial portions of the parcel. Most
of the property was then, as it is now, salt marsh subject to
tidal flooding. The wet ground and permeable soil would
require considerable fill--as much as six feet in some

Opinion of the Court
places--before significant structures could be built. SGI'sproposal, submitted in 1962 to the Rhode Island Division of

Harbors and Rivers (DHR), sought to dredge from Winna-paug Pond and fill the entire property. The application was
denied for lack of essential information. A second, similarproposal followed a year later. A third application, submitted in 1966 while the second application was pending, proposed more limited filling of the land for use as a privatebeach club. These latter two applications were referred to

the Rhode Island Department of Natural Resources, whichindicated initial assent. The agency later withdrew approval, however, citing adverse environmental impacts.
SGI did not contest the ruling.

No further attempts to develop the property were made
for over a decade. Two intervening events, however, become important to the issues presented. First, in 1971,
Rhode Island enacted legislation creating the Council, an
agency charged with the duty of protecting the State's
coastal properties. 1971 R. I. Pub. Laws, ch. 279, $ 1 et seq.
Regulations promulgated by the Council designated salt
marshes like those on SGI's property as protected "coastal
wetlands," Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management
Program (CRMP) $ 210.3 (as amended, June 28, 1983) (lodged
with the Clerk of this Court), on which development is limited to a great extent. Second, in 1978, SGI's corporate
charter was revoked for failure to pay corporate income
taxes; and title to the property passed, by operation of state
law, to petitioner as the corporation's sole shareholder.

In 1983, petitioner, now the owner, renewed the efforts to
develop the property. An application to the Council, resembling the 1962 submission, requested permission to construct
a wooden bulkhead along the shore of Winnapaug Pond and
to fill the entire marshland area. The Council rejected the
application, noting it was "vague and inadequate for a project of this size and nature." App. 16. The agency also
found that "the proposed activities will have significant im533US2 Unit: $U85 [10-19-02 15:38:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN

615Cite as: 533 U. S. 606 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
pacts upon the waters and wetlands of Winnapaug Pond,"and concluded that "the proposed alteration . . . will conflict

with the Coastal Resources Management Plan presently ineffect."

Id., at 17. Petitioner did not appeal the agency's
determination.Petitioner went back to the drawing board, this time hiring counsel and preparing a more specific and limited proposal for use of the property. The new application, submit-ted to the Council in 1985, echoed the 1966 request to build

a private beach club. The details do not tend to inspire thereader with an idyllic coastal image, for the proposal was to
fill 11 acres of the property with gravel to accommodate "50
cars with boat trailers, a dumpster, port-a-johns, picnic tables, barbecue pits of concrete, and other trash receptacles."
Id., at 25.

The application fared no better with the Council than previous ones. Under the agency's regulations, a landowner
wishing to fill salt marsh on Winnapaug Pond needed a "special exception" from the Council. CRMP $ 130. In a short
opinion the Council said the beach club proposal conflicted
with the regulatory standard for a special exception. See
App. 27. To secure a special exception the proposed activity
must serve "a compelling public purpose which provides benefits to the public as a whole as opposed to individual or
private interests." CRMP $ 130A(1). This time petitioner
appealed the decision to the Rhode Island courts, challenging
the Council's conclusion as contrary to principles of state administrative law. The Council's decision was affirmed. See
App. 31-42.

Petitioner filed an inverse condemnation action in Rhode
Island Superior Court, asserting that the State's wetlands
regulations, as applied by the Council to his parcel, had taken
the property without compensation in violation of the Fifth
and Fourteenth Amendments. See id., at 45. The suit alleged the Council's action deprived him of "economically,
beneficial use" of his property, ibid., resulting in a total tak533US2 Unit: $U85 [10-19-02 15:38:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN
616 PALAZZOLO v. RHODE ISLAND

Opinion of the Court
ing requiring compensation under Lucas v. South Carolina
Coastal Council, 505 U. S. 1003 (1992). He sought damages
in the amount of $3,150,000, a figure derived from an appraiser's estimate as to the value of a 74-lot residential subdivision. The State countered with a host of defenses. After
a bench trial, a justice of the Superior Court ruled against
petitioner, accepting some of the State's theories. App. to
Pet. for Cert. B-1 to B-13.

The Rhode Island Supreme Court affirmed. 746 A. 2d 707
(2000). Like the Superior Court, the State Supreme Court
recited multiple grounds for rejecting petitioner's suit. The
court held, first, that petitioner's takings claim was not ripe,
id., at 712-715; second, that petitioner had no right to challenge regulations predating 1978, when he succeeded to legal
ownership of the property from SGI, id., at 716; and third,
that the claim of deprivation of all economically beneficial
use was contradicted by undisputed evidence that he had
$200,000 in development value remaining on an upland parcel
of the property, id., at 715. In addition to holding petitioner
could not assert a takings claim based on the denial of all
economic use, the court concluded he could not recover under
the more general test of Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New
York City, 438 U. S. 104 (1978). On this claim, too, the date
of acquisition of the parcel was found determinative, and the
court held he could have had "no reasonable investmentbacked expectations that were affected by this regulation"
because it predated his ownership, 746 A. 2d, at 717; see also
Penn Central, supra, at 124.

We disagree with the Supreme Court of Rhode Island as
to the first two of these conclusions; and, we hold, the court
was correct to conclude that the owner is not deprived of all
economic use of his property because the value of upland
portions is substantial. We remand for further consideration of the claim under the principles set forth in Penn
Central.

Opinion of the Court

II
The Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment, applicable tothe States through the Fourteenth Amendment,

Chicago,B. & Q. R. Co. v. Chicago, 166 U. S. 226 (1897), prohibits the

government from taking private property for public usewithout just compensation. The clearest sort of taking occurs when the government encroaches upon or occupies pri-vate land for its own proposed use. Our cases establish that
even a minimal "permanent physical occupation of real prop-erty" requires compensation under the Clause. Loretto v.
Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U. S. 419, 427(1982). In

Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U. S. 393(1922), the Court recognized that there will be instances

when government actions do not encroach upon or occupythe property yet still affect and limit its use to such an extent that a taking occurs. In Justice Holmes' well-known, ifless than self-defining, formulation, "while property may be
regulated to a certain extent, if a regulation goes too far itwill be recognized as a taking." Id., at 415.

Since Mahon, we have given some, but not too specific,guidance to courts confronted with deciding whether a particular government action goes too far and effects a regula-tory taking. First, we have observed, with certain qualifications, see infra, at 629-630, that a regulation which"denies all economically beneficial or productive use of
land" will require compensation under the Takings Clause.
Lucas, 505 U. S., at 1015; see also id., at 1035 (Kennedy, J.,concurring); Agins v. City of Tiburon, 447 U. S. 255, 261

(1980). Where a regulation places limitations on land thatfall short of eliminating all economically beneficial use, a taking nonetheless may have occurred, depending on a complexof factors including the regulation's economic effect on the
landowner, the extent to which the regulation interfereswith reasonable investment-backed expectations, and the
character of the government action. Penn Central, supra,at 124. These inquiries are informed by the purpose of the

Opinion of the Court
Takings Clause, which is to prevent the government from"forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which, in

all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as awhole." Armstrong v. United States, 364 U. S. 40, 49 (1960).

Petitioner seeks compensation under these principles. Atthe outset, however, we face the two threshold considerations invoked by the state court to bar the claim: ripeness,and acquisition which postdates the regulation.

A
In Williamson County Regional Planning Comm'n v.
Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, 473 U. S. 172 (1985), theCourt explained the requirement that a takings claim must

be ripe. The Court held that a takings claim challengingthe application of land-use regulations is not ripe unless "the
government entity charged with implementing the regula-tions has reached a final decision regarding the application
of the regulations to the property at issue." Id., at 186. Afinal decision by the responsible state agency informs the
constitutional determination whether a regulation has de-prived a landowner of "all economically beneficial use" of the
property, see Lucas, supra, at 1015, or defeated the reason-able investment-backed expectations of the landowner to the
extent that a taking has occurred, see Penn Central, supra,at 124. These matters cannot be resolved in definitive
terms until a court knows "the extent of permitted develop-ment" on the land in question.

MacDonald, Sommer &Frates v. Yolo County, 477 U. S. 340, 351 (1986). Drawing

on these principles, the Rhode Island Supreme Court heldthat petitioner had not taken the necessary steps to ripen
his takings claim.The central question in resolving the ripeness issue, under
Williamson County and other relevant decisions, is whetherpetitioner obtained a final decision from the Council determining the permitted use for the land. As we have noted,SGI's early applications to fill had been granted at one point,

533US2 Unit: $U85 [10-19-02 15:38:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN

619Cite as: 533 U. S. 606 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
though that assent was later revoked. Petitioner then sub-mitted two proposals: the 1983 proposal to fill the entire parcel, and the 1985 proposal to fill 11 of the property's 18 wet-land acres for construction of the beach club. The court
reasoned that, notwithstanding the Council's denials of theapplications, doubt remained as to the extent of development
the Council would allow on petitioner's parcel. We cannot
agree.The court based its holding in part upon petitioner's failure

to explore "any other use for the property that would involvefilling substantially less wetlands." 746 A. 2d, at 714. It
relied upon this Court's observations that the final decision
requirement is not satisfied when a developer submits, and a
land-use authority denies, a grandiose development proposal,
leaving open the possibility that lesser uses of the property
might be permitted. See MacDonald, supra, at 353, n. 9.
The suggestion is that while the Council rejected petitioner's
effort to fill all of the wetlands, and then rejected his proposal to fill 11 of the wetland acres, perhaps an application
to fill (for instance) 5 acres would have been approved.
Thus, the reasoning goes, we cannot know for sure the extent
of permitted development on petitioner's wetlands.

This is belied by the unequivocal nature of the wetland
regulations at issue and by the Council's application of the
regulations to the subject property. Winnapaug Pond is
classified under the CRMP as a Type 2 body of water. See
CRMP $ 200.2. A landowner, as a general rule, is prohibited
from filling or building residential structures on wetlands
adjacent to Type 2 waters, see id., Table 1, p. 22, and

$ 210.3(C)(4), but may seek a special exception from the
Council to engage in a prohibited use, see id., $ 130. The
Council is permitted to allow the exception, however, only
where a "compelling public purpose" is served. Id.,

$ 130A(2). The proposal to fill the entire property was not
accepted under Council regulations and did not qualify for
the special exception. The Council determined the use pro533US2 Unit: $U85 [10-19-02 15:38:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN
620 PALAZZOLO v. RHODE ISLAND

Opinion of the Court
posed in the second application (the beach club) did not sat-isfy the "compelling public purpose" standard. There is no

indication the Council would have accepted the applicationhad petitioner's proposed beach club occupied a smaller surface area. To the contrary, it ruled that the proposed activ-ity was not a "compelling public purpose." App. 27; cf.

id.,
at 17 (1983 application to fill wetlands proposed an "activity"
conflicting with the CRMP).

Williamson County's final decision requirement "responds
to the high degree of discretion characteristically possessedby land-use boards in softening the strictures of the general

regulations they administer." Suitum v. Tahoe Regional
Planning Agency, 520 U. S. 725, 738 (1997). While a landowner must give a land-use authority an opportunity to exercise its discretion, once it becomes clear that the agency lacks
the discretion to permit any development, or the permissible
uses of the property are known to a reasonable degree of
certainty, a takings claim is likely to have ripened. The case
is quite unlike those upon which respondents place principal
reliance, which arose when an owner challenged a land-use
authority's denial of a substantial project, leaving doubt
whether a more modest submission or an application for a
variance would be accepted. See MacDonald, supra, at 342
(denial of 159-home residential subdivision); Williamson
County, supra, at 182 (476-unit subdivision); cf. Agins v. City
of Tiburon, 447 U. S. 255 (1980) (case not ripe because no
plan to develop was submitted).

These cases stand for the important principle that a landowner may not establish a taking before a land-use authority
has the opportunity, using its own reasonable procedures, to
decide and explain the reach of a challenged regulation.
Under our ripeness rules a takings claim based on a law or
regulation which is alleged to go too far in burdening property depends upon the landowner's first having followed reasonable and necessary steps to allow regulatory agencies to
exercise their full discretion in considering development

533US2 Unit: $U85 [10-19-02 15:38:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN

621Cite as: 533 U. S. 606 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
plans for the property, including the opportunity to grantany variances or waivers allowed by law. As a general rule,

until these ordinary processes have been followed the extentof the restriction on property is not known and a regulatory
taking has not yet been established. See Suitum, supra, at736, and n. 10 (noting difficulty of demonstrating that "mere
enactment" of regulations restricting land use effects a taking). Government authorities, of course, may not burdenproperty by imposition of repetitive or unfair land-use procedures in order to avoid a final decision. Monterey v. Del
Monte Dunes at Monterey, Ltd., 526 U. S. 687, 698 (1999).

With respect to the wetlands on petitioner's property, the
Council's decisions make plain that the agency interpreted
its regulations to bar petitioner from engaging in any filling
or development activity on the wetlands, a fact reinforced by
the Attorney General's forthright responses to our questioning during oral argument in this case. See Tr. of Oral Arg.
26, 31. The rulings of the Council interpreting the regulations at issue, and the briefs, arguments, and candid statements by counsel for both sides, leave no doubt on this point:
On the wetlands there can be no fill for any ordinary land
use. There can be no fill for its own sake; no fill for a beach
club, either rustic or upscale; no fill for a subdivision; no fill
for any likely or foreseeable use. And with no fill there can
be no structures and no development on the wetlands. Further permit applications were not necessary to establish
this point.

As noted above, however, not all of petitioner's parcel constitutes protected wetlands. The trial court accepted uncontested testimony that an upland site located at the eastern end of the property would have an estimated value of
$200,000 if developed. App. to Pet. for Cert. B-5. While
Council approval is required to develop upland property
which lies within 200 feet of protected waters, see CRMP

$ 100.1(A), the strict "compelling public purpose" test does
not govern proposed land uses on property in this classifica533US2 Unit: $U85 [10-19-02 15:38:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN
622 PALAZZOLO v. RHODE ISLAND

Opinion of the Court
tion, see id., $ 110, Table 1A, $ 120. Council officials testifiedat trial, moreover, that they would have allowed petitioner

to build a residence on the upland parcel. App. to Pet. forCert. B-5. The State Supreme Court found petitioner's
claim unripe for the further reason that he "has not soughtpermission for any . . . use of the property that would
involve . . . development only of the upland portion of the
parcel." 746 A. 2d, at 714.In assessing the significance of petitioner's failure to submit applications to develop the upland area it is important tobear in mind the purpose that the final decision requirement
serves. Our ripeness jurisprudence imposes obligations on
landowners because "[a] court cannot determine whether a
regulation goes `too far' unless it knows how far the regulation goes." MacDonald, 477 U. S., at 348. Ripeness doctrine does not require a landowner to submit applications for
their own sake. Petitioner is required to explore development opportunities on his upland parcel only if there is uncertainty as to the land's permitted use.

The State asserts the value of the uplands is in doubt. It
relies in part on a comment in the opinion of the Rhode Island Supreme Court that "it would be possible to build at
least one single-family home on the upland portion of the
parcel." 746 A. 2d, at 714. It argues that the qualification
"at least" indicates that additional development beyond the
single dwelling was possible. The attempt to interject ambiguity as to the value or use of the uplands, however, comes
too late in the day for purposes of litigation before this
Court. It was stated in the petition for certiorari that the
uplands on petitioner's property had an estimated worth of
$200,000. See Pet. for Cert. 21. The figure not only was
uncontested but also was cited as fact in the State's brief in
opposition. See Brief in Opposition 4, 19. In this circumstance ripeness cannot be contested by saying that the value
of the nonwetland parcels is unknown. See Lucas, 505 U. S.,
at 1020, and n. 9.

623Cite as: 533 U. S. 606 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
The State's prior willingness to accept the $200,000 figure,furthermore, is well founded. The only reference to upland

property in the trial court's opinion is to a single parcelworth an estimated $200,000. See App. to Pet. for Cert.
B-5. There was, it must be acknowledged, testimony attrial suggesting the existence of an additional upland parcel
elsewhere on the property. See Tr. 190-191, 199-120 (testimony of Dr. Grover Fugate, Council Executive Director);see also

id., at 610 (testimony of Steven Clarke). The testimony indicated, however, that the potential, second uplandparcel was on an "island" which required construction of

a road across wetlands, id., at 610, 623-624 (testimony of
Mr. Clarke)--and, as discussed above, the filling of wetlands
for such a purpose would not justify a special exception
under Council regulations. See supra, at 619-621; see also
Brief for Respondents 10 ("Residential construction is not
the basis of such a `special exception' "). Perhaps for this
reason, the State did not maintain in the trial court that
additional uplands could have been developed. To the contrary, its post-trial memorandum identified only the single parcel that petitioner concedes retains a development
value of $200,000. See State's Post-Trial Memorandum in
No. 88-0297 (Super. Ct. R. I.), pp. 25, 81. The trial court
accepted the figure. So there is no genuine ambiguity in the
record as to the extent of permitted development on petitioner's property, either on the wetlands or the uplands.

Nonetheless, there is some suggestion that the use permitted on the uplands is not known, because the State accepted
the $200,000 value for the upland parcel on the premise that
only a Lucas claim was raised in the pleadings in the state
trial court. See Brief for Respondents 29-30. Since a
Penn Central argument was not pressed at trial, it is argued,
the State had no reason to assert with vigor that more than
a single-family residence might be placed on the uplands.
We disagree; the State was aware of the applicability of
Penn Central. The issue whether the Council's decisions

Opinion of the Court
amounted to a taking under Penn Central was discussed inthe trial court, App. to Pet. for Cert. B-7, the State Supreme

Court, 746 A. 2d, at 717, and the State's own post-trial sub-missions, see State's Post-Trial Supplemental Memorandum
7-10. The state-court opinions cannot be read as indicatingthat a

Penn Central claim was not properly presented from
the outset of this litigation.

A final ripeness issue remains. In concluding that Williamson County's final decision requirement was not satisfied, the State Supreme Court placed emphasis on petition-er's failure to "appl[y] for permission to develop [the]

seventy-four-lot subdivision" that was the basis for the damages sought in his inverse condemnation suit. 746 A. 2d,
at 714. The court did not explain why it thought this fact
significant, but respondents and amici defend the ruling.
The Council's practice, they assert, is to consider a proposal
only if the applicant has satisfied all other regulatory preconditions for the use envisioned in the application. The subdivision proposal that was the basis for petitioner's takings
claim, they add, could not have proceeded before the Council
without, at minimum, zoning approval from the town of
Westerly and a permit from the Rhode Island Department
of Environmental Management allowing the installation of
individual sewage disposal systems on the property. Petitioner is accused of employing a hide the ball strategy of
submitting applications for more modest uses to the Council,
only to assert later a takings action predicated on the purported inability to build a much larger project. Brief for
the National Wildlife Federation et al. as Amici Curiae 9.

It is difficult to see how this concern is relevant to the
inquiry at issue here. Petitioner was informed by the Council that he could not fill the wetlands; it follows of necessity
that he could not fill and then build 74 single-family dwellings upon it. Petitioner's submission of this proposal would
not have clarified the extent of development permitted by
the wetlands regulations, which is the inquiry required

Opinion of the Court
under our ripeness decisions. The State's concern may bethat landowners could demand damages for a taking based

on a project that could not have been constructed underother, valid zoning restrictions quite apart from the regulation being challenged. This, of course, is a valid concern ininverse condemnation cases alleging injury from wrongful
refusal to permit development. The instant case does not
require us to pass upon the authority of a State to insist insuch cases that landowners follow normal planning procedures or to enact rules to control damages awards based onhypothetical uses that should have been reviewed in the normal course, and we do not intend to cast doubt upon such
rules here. The mere allegation of entitlement to the value
of an intensive use will not avail the landowner if the project
would not have been allowed under other existing, legitimate
land-use limitations. When a taking has occurred, under accepted condemnation principles the owner's damages will be
based upon the property's fair market value, see, e. g., Olson
v. United States, 292 U. S. 246, 255 (1934); 4 J. Sackman, Nichols on Eminent Domain $ 12.01 (rev. 3d ed. 2000)--an inquiry
which will turn, in part, on restrictions on use imposed by
legitimate zoning or other regulatory limitations, see id.,

$ 12C.03[1].

The state court, however, did not rely upon state-law ripeness or exhaustion principles in holding that petitioner's takings claim was barred by virtue of his failure to apply for a
74-lot subdivision; it relied on Williamson County. As we
have explained, Williamson County and our other ripeness
decisions do not impose further obligations on petitioner, for
the limitations the wetland regulations imposed were clear
from the Council's denial of his applications, and there is no
indication that any use involving any substantial structures
or improvements would have been allowed. Where the
state agency charged with enforcing a challenged land-use
regulation entertains an application from an owner and its
denial of the application makes clear the extent of develop533US2 Unit: $U85 [10-19-02 15:38:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ment permitted, and neither the agency nor a reviewing
state court has cited noncompliance with reasonable statelaw exhaustion or pre-permit processes, see Felder v. Casey,
487 U. S. 131, 150-151 (1988), federal ripeness rules do not
require the submission of further and futile applications with
other agencies.

We turn to the second asserted basis for declining to address petitioner's takings claim on the merits. When the
Council promulgated its wetlands regulations, the disputed
parcel was owned not by petitioner but by the corporation
of which he was sole shareholder. When title was transferred to petitioner by operation of law, the wetlands regulations were in force. The state court held the postregulation
acquisition of title was fatal to the claim for deprivation of
all economic use, 746 A. 2d, at 716, and to the Penn Central
claim, 746 A. 2d, at 717. While the first holding was couched
in terms of background principles of state property law, see
Lucas, 505 U. S., at 1015, and the second in terms of petitioner's reasonable investment-backed expectations, see Penn
Central, 438 U. S., at 124, the two holdings together amount
to a single, sweeping, rule: A purchaser or a successive title
holder like petitioner is deemed to have notice of an earlierenacted restriction and is barred from claiming that it effects
a taking.

The theory underlying the argument that postenactment
purchasers cannot challenge a regulation under the Takings
Clause seems to run on these lines: Property rights are created by the State. See, e. g., Phillips v. Washington Legal
Foundation, 524 U. S. 156, 163 (1998). So, the argument
goes, by prospective legislation the State can shape and define property rights and reasonable investment-backed expectations, and subsequent owners cannot claim any injury
from lost value. After all, they purchased or took title with
notice of the limitation.

Opinion of the Court
The State may not put so potent a Hobbesian stick intothe Lockean bundle. The right to improve property, of

course, is subject to the reasonable exercise of state author-ity, including the enforcement of valid zoning and land-use
restrictions. See Pennsylvania Coal Co., 260 U. S., at 413("Government hardly could go on if to some extent values
incident to property could not be diminished without paying
for every such change in the general law"). The TakingsClause, however, in certain circumstances allows a landowner to assert that a particular exercise of the State's regu-latory power is so unreasonable or onerous as to compel compensation. Just as a prospective enactment, such as a new
zoning ordinance, can limit the value of land without effecting a taking because it can be understood as reasonable by
all concerned, other enactments are unreasonable and do not
become less so through passage of time or title. Were we
to accept the State's rule, the postenactment transfer of title
would absolve the State of its obligation to defend any action
restricting land use, no matter how extreme or unreasonable.
A State would be allowed, in effect, to put an expiration date
on the Takings Clause. This ought not to be the rule. Future generations, too, have a right to challenge unreasonable
limitations on the use and value of land.

Nor does the justification of notice take into account the
effect on owners at the time of enactment, who are prejudiced as well. Should an owner attempt to challenge a new
regulation, but not survive the process of ripening his or her
claim (which, as this case demonstrates, will often take
years), under the proposed rule the right to compensation
may not be asserted by an heir or successor, and so may not
be asserted at all. The State's rule would work a critical
alteration to the nature of property, as the newly regulated
landowner is stripped of the ability to transfer the interest
which was possessed prior to the regulation. The State
may not by this means secure a windfall for itself. See
Webb's Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc. v. Beckwith, 449 U. S.

533US2 Unit: $U85 [10-19-02 15:38:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN
628 PALAZZOLO v. RHODE ISLAND

Opinion of the Court
155, 164 (1980) ("[A] State, by ipse dixit, may not transformprivate property into public property without compensation"); cf. Ellickson, Property in Land, 102 Yale L. J. 1315,1368-1369 (1993) (right to transfer interest in land is a defining characteristic of the fee simple estate). The proposedrule is, furthermore, capricious in effect. The young owner
contrasted with the older owner, the owner with the resources to hold contrasted with the owner with the need tosell, would be in different positions. The Takings Clause is

not so quixotic. A blanket rule that purchasers with noticehave no compensation right when a claim becomes ripe is too
blunt an instrument to accord with the duty to compensate
for what is taken.

Direct condemnation, by invocation of the State's power of
eminent domain, presents different considerations from cases
alleging a taking based on a burdensome regulation. In a
direct condemnation action, or when a State has physically
invaded the property without filing suit, the fact and extent
of the taking are known. In such an instance, it is a general
rule of the law of eminent domain that any award goes to
the owner at the time of the taking, and that the right to
compensation is not passed to a subsequent purchaser. See
Danforth v. United States, 308 U. S. 271, 284 (1939); 2 Sackman, Eminent Domain, at $ 5.01[5][d][i] ("It is well settled
that when there is a taking of property by eminent domain
in compliance with the law, it is the owner of the property
at the time of the taking who is entitled to compensation").
A challenge to the application of a land-use regulation, by
contrast, does not mature until ripeness requirements have
been satisfied, under principles we have discussed; until this
point an inverse condemnation claim alleging a regulatory
taking cannot be maintained. It would be illogical, and unfair, to bar a regulatory takings claim because of the postenactment transfer of ownership where the steps necessary
to make the claim ripe were not taken, or could not have
been taken, by a previous owner.

Opinion of the Court
There is controlling precedent for our conclusion. Nollanv.

California Coastal Comm'n, 483 U. S. 825 (1987), presented the question whether it was consistent with the Tak-ings Clause for a state regulatory agency to require oceanfront landowners to provide lateral beach access to the publicas the condition for a development permit. The principal
dissenting opinion observed it was a policy of the California
Coastal Commission to require the condition, and that theNollans, who purchased their home after the policy went into

effect, were "on notice that new developments would be ap-proved only if provisions were made for lateral beach access." Id., at 860 (Brennan, J., dissenting). A majority of
the Court rejected the proposition. "So long as the Commission could not have deprived the prior owners of the
easement without compensating them," the Court reasoned,
"the prior owners must be understood to have transferred
their full property rights in conveying the lot." Id., at 834,
n. 2.

It is argued that Nollan's holding was limited by the later
decision in Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 505
U. S. 1003 (1992). In Lucas the Court observed that a landowner's ability to recover for a government deprivation of
all economically beneficial use of property is not absolute but
instead is confined by limitations on the use of land which
"inhere in the title itself." Id., at 1029. This is so, the
Court reasoned, because the landowner is constrained by
those "restrictions that background principles of the State's
law of property and nuisance already place upon land ownership." Ibid. It is asserted here that Lucas stands for the
proposition that any new regulation, once enacted, becomes
a background principle of property law which cannot be challenged by those who acquire title after the enactment.

We have no occasion to consider the precise circumstances
when a legislative enactment can be deemed a background
principle of state law or whether those circumstances are
present here. It suffices to say that a regulation that other533US2 Unit: $U85 [10-19-02 15:38:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
wise would be unconstitutional absent compensation is nottransformed into a background principle of the State's law

by mere virtue of the passage of title. This relative stand-ard would be incompatible with our description of the concept in Lucas, which is explained in terms of those common,shared understandings of permissible limitations derived
from a State's legal tradition, see id., at 1029-1030. A regu-lation or common-law rule cannot be a background principle
for some owners but not for others. The determinationwhether an existing, general law can limit all economic use
of property must turn on objective factors, such as the na-ture of the land use proscribed. See

id., at 1030 ("The `totaltaking' inquiry we require today will ordinarily entail . . .

analysis of, among other things, the degree of harm to publiclands and resources, or adjacent private property, posed by
the claimant's proposed activities"). A law does not becomea background principle for subsequent owners by enactment
itself. Lucas did not overrule our holding in Nollan, which,as we have noted, is based on essential Takings Clause
principles.For reasons we discuss next, the state court will not find
it necessary to explore these matters on remand in connec-tion with the claim that all economic use was deprived; it
must address, however, the merits of petitioner's claim under
Penn Central. That claim is not barred by the mere factthat title was acquired after the effective date of the stateimposed restriction. III

As the case is ripe, and as the date of transfer of titledoes not bar petitioner's takings claim, we have before us the
alternative ground relied upon by the Rhode Island SupremeCourt in ruling upon the merits of the takings claims. It
held that all economically beneficial use was not deprivedbecause the uplands portion of the property can still be improved. On this point, we agree with the court's decision.Petitioner accepts the Council's contention and the state trial

court's finding that his parcel retains $200,000 in develop-ment value under the State's wetlands regulations. He asserts, nonetheless, that he has suffered a total taking andcontends the Council cannot sidestep the holding in

Lucas
"by the simple expedient of leaving a landowner a fewcrumbs of value." Brief for Petitioner 37.

Assuming a taking is otherwise established, a State may
not evade the duty to compensate on the premise that thelandowner is left with a token interest. This is not the situation of the landowner in this case, however. A regulationpermitting a landowner to build a substantial residence on
an 18-acre parcel does not leave the property "economically
idle." Lucas, supra, at 1019.

In his brief submitted to us petitioner attempts to revive
this part of his claim by reframing it. He argues, for the
first time, that the upland parcel is distinct from the wetlands portions, so he should be permitted to assert a deprivation limited to the latter. This contention asks us to
examine the difficult, persisting question of what is the
proper denominator in the takings fraction. See Michelman,
Property, Utility, and Fairness: Comments on the Ethical
Foundations of "Just Compensation Law," 80 Harv. L. Rev.
1165, 1192 (1967). Some of our cases indicate that the extent
of deprivation effected by a regulatory action is measured
against the value of the parcel as a whole, see, e. g., Keystone
Bituminous Coal Assn. v. DeBenedictis, 480 U. S. 470, 497
(1987); but we have at times expressed discomfort with the
logic of this rule, see Lucas, supra, at 1016-1017, n. 7, a sentiment echoed by some commentators, see, e. g., Epstein, Takings: Descent and Resurrection, 1987 S. Ct. Rev. 1, 16-17
(1987); Fee, Unearthing the Denominator in Regulatory Takings Claims, 61 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1535 (1994). Whatever the
merits of these criticisms, we will not explore the point here.
Petitioner did not press the argument in the state courts,
and the issue was not presented in the petition for certiorari.
The case comes to us on the premise that petitioner's entire

parcel serves as the basis for his takings claim, and, soframed, the total deprivation argument fails.

* * *
For the reasons we have discussed, the State SupremeCourt erred in finding petitioner's claims were unripe and

in ruling that acquisition of title after the effective date ofthe regulations barred the takings claims. The court did
not err in finding that petitioner failed to establish a depriva-tion of all economic value, for it is undisputed that the parcel
retains significant worth for construction of a residence.The claims under the

Penn Central analysis were not exam-ined, and for this purpose the case should be remanded.

The judgment of the Rhode Island Supreme Court is af-firmed in part and reversed in part, and the case is remanded
for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.
Justice O'Connor, concurring.
I join the opinion of the Court but with my understandingof how the issues discussed in Part II-B of the opinion must

be considered on remand.Part II-B of the Court's opinion addresses the circumstance, present in this case, where a takings claimant hasacquired title to the regulated property after the enactment
of the regulation at issue. As the Court holds, the RhodeIsland Supreme Court erred in effectively adopting the
sweeping rule that the preacquisition enactment of the userestriction

ipso facto defeats any takings claim based on thatuse restriction. Accordingly, the Court holds that petitioner's claim under Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City,438 U. S. 104 (1978), "is not barred by the mere fact that title
was acquired after the effective date of the state-imposedrestriction." Ante, at 630.

The more difficult question is what role the temporal rela-tionship between regulatory enactment and title acquisition

533US2 Unit: $U85 [10-19-02 15:38:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN

633Cite as: 533 U. S. 606 (2001)
O'Connor, J., concurring
plays in a proper Penn Central analysis. Today's holdingdoes not mean that the timing of the regulation's enactment

relative to the acquisition of title is immaterial to the Penn
Central analysis. Indeed, it would be just as much error to
expunge this consideration from the takings inquiry as itwould be to accord it exclusive significance. Our polestar

instead remains the principles set forth in Penn Central
itself and our other cases that govern partial regulatorytakings. Under these cases, interference with investmentbacked expectations is one of a number of factors that a courtmust examine. Further, the regulatory regime in place at
the time the claimant acquires the property at issue helps to
shape the reasonableness of those expectations.

The Fifth Amendment forbids the taking of private property for public use without just compensation. We have recognized that this constitutional guarantee is " `designed to
bar Government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne
by the public as a whole.' " Penn Central, supra, at 123-124
(quoting Armstrong v. United States, 364 U. S. 40, 49 (1960)).
The concepts of "fairness and justice" that underlie the Takings Clause, of course, are less than fully determinate. Accordingly, we have eschewed "any `set formula' for determining when `justice and fairness' require that economic injuries
caused by public action be compensated by the government,
rather than remain disproportionately concentrated on a few
persons." Penn Central, supra, at 124 (quoting Goldblatt v.
Hempstead, 369 U. S. 590, 594 (1962)). The outcome instead
"depends largely `upon the particular circumstances [in that]
case.' " Penn Central, supra, at 124 (quoting United States
v. Central Eureka Mining Co., 357 U. S. 155, 168 (1958)).

We have "identified several factors that have particular
significance" in these "essentially ad hoc, factual inquiries."
Penn Central, 438 U. S., at 124. Two such factors are "[t]he
economic impact of the regulation on the claimant and, particularly, the extent to which the regulation has interfered

with distinct investment-backed expectations." Ibid. An-other is "the character of the governmental action."

Ibid.
The purposes served, as well as the effects produced, by aparticular regulation inform the takings analysis.

Id., at
127 ("[A] use restriction on real property may constitute a`taking' if not reasonably necessary to the effectuation of a

substantial public purpose, [citations omitted], or perhaps if
it has an unduly harsh impact upon the owner's use of theproperty"); see also

Yee v. Escondido, 503 U. S. 519, 523
(1992) (Regulatory takings cases "necessarily entai[l] com-plex factual assessments of the purposes and economic effects of government actions"). Penn Central does not supply mathematically precise variables, but instead provides
important guideposts that lead to the ultimate determination
whether just compensation is required.

The Rhode Island Supreme Court concluded that, because
the wetlands regulations predated petitioner's acquisition
of the property at issue, petitioner lacked reasonable
investment-backed expectations and hence lacked a viable
takings claim. 746 A. 2d 707, 717 (2000). The court erred
in elevating what it believed to be "[petitioner's] lack of
reasonable investment-backed expectations" to "dispositive"
status. Ibid. Investment-backed expectations, though important, are not talismanic under Penn Central. Evaluation
of the degree of interference with investment-backed expectations instead is one factor that points toward the answer
to the question whether the application of a particular regulation to particular property "goes too far." Pennsylvania
Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U. S. 393, 415 (1922).

Further, the state of regulatory affairs at the time of acquisition is not the only factor that may determine the extent
of investment-backed expectations. For example, the nature and extent of permitted development under the regulatory regime vis-a` -vis the development sought by the claimant may also shape legitimate expectations without vesting
any kind of development right in the property owner. We

also have never held that a takings claim is defeated simplyon account of the lack of a personal financial investment by a

postenactment acquirer of property, such as a donee, heir, ordevisee. Cf. Hodel v. Irving, 481 U. S. 704, 714-718 (1987).
Courts instead must attend to those circumstances which areprobative of what fairness requires in a given case.

If investment-backed expectations are given exclusive sig-nificance in the

Penn Central analysis and existing regula-tions dictate the reasonableness of those expectations in

every instance, then the State wields far too much power toredefine property rights upon passage of title. On the other
hand, if existing regulations do nothing to inform the analy-sis, then some property owners may reap windfalls and an
important indicium of fairness is lost.* As I understand it,our decision today does not remove the regulatory backdrop
against which an owner takes title to property from the pur-view of the Penn Central inquiry. It simply restores balance to that inquiry. Courts properly consider the effect ofexisting regulations under the rubric of investment-backed
expectations in determining whether a compensable taking

*Justice Scalia's inapt "government-as-thief " simile is symptomatic
of the larger failing of his opinion, which is that he appears to conflate two
questions. The first question is whether the enactment or application of
a regulation constitutes a valid exercise of the police power. The second
question is whether the State must compensate a property owner for a
diminution in value effected by the State's exercise of its police power.
We have held that "[t]he `public use' requirement [of the Takings Clause]
is . . . coterminous with the scope of a sovereign's police powers." Hawaii
Housing Authority v. Midkiff, 467 U. S. 229, 240 (1984). The relative
timing of regulatory enactment and title acquisition, of course, does not
affect the analysis of whether a State has acted within the scope of these
powers in the first place. That issue appears to be the one on which
Justice Scalia focuses, but it is not the matter at hand. The relevant
question instead is the second question described above. It is to this inquiry that "investment-backed expectations" and the state of regulatory
affairs upon acquisition of title are relevant under Penn Central. Justice
Scalia's approach therefore would seem to require a revision of the Penn
Central analysis that this Court has not undertaken.

has occurred. As before, the salience of these facts cannotbe reduced to any "set formula." Penn Central, 438 U. S.,

at 124 (internal quotation marks omitted). The temptationto adopt what amount to per se rules in either direction must
be resisted. The Takings Clause requires careful exami-nation and weighing of all the relevant circumstances in
this context. The court below therefore must consider onremand the array of relevant factors under

Penn Centralbefore deciding whether any compensation is due.

Justice Scalia, concurring.
I write separately to make clear that my understanding ofhow the issues discussed in Part II-B of the Court's opinion

must be considered on remand is not Justice O'Connor's.The principle that underlies her separate concurrence is
that it may in some (unspecified) circumstances be "[un]-fai[r]," and produce unacceptable "windfalls," to allow a
subsequent purchaser to nullify an unconstitutional partialtaking (though, inexplicably, not an unconstitutional total
taking) by the government. Ante, at 635. The polar horri-ble, presumably, is the situation in which a sharp real estate
developer, realizing (or indeed, simply gambling on) the unconstitutional excessiveness of a development restriction that anai"ve landowner assumes to be valid, purchases property at

what it would be worth subject to the restriction, and thendevelops it to its full value (or resells it at its full value) after
getting the unconstitutional restriction invalidated.This can, I suppose, be called a windfall--though it is not
much different from the windfalls that occur every day atstock exchanges or antique auctions, where the knowledgeable (or the venturesome) profit at the expense of the igno-rant (or the risk averse). There is something to be said
(though in my view not much) for pursuing abstract "fair-ness" by requiring part or all of that windfall to be returned
to the nai"ve original owner, who presumably is the "rightful"
owner of it. But there is nothing to be said for giving

Opinion of Stevens, J.
it instead to the government--which not only did not losesomething it owned, but is both the cause of the miscarriage

of "fairness" and the only one of the three parties involvedin the miscarriage (government, nai"ve original owner, and
sharp real estate developer) which acted unlawfully--indeedunconstitutionally.

Justice O'Connor would eliminatethe windfall by giving the malefactor the benefit of its malefaction. It is rather like eliminating the windfall that ac-crued to a purchaser who bought property at a bargain rate
from a thief clothed with the indicia of title, by making himturn over the "unjust" profit to the thief.*

In my view, the fact that a restriction existed at the timethe purchaser took title (other than a restriction forming
part of the "background principles of the State's law of prop-erty and nuisance," Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U. S. 1003, 1029 (1992)) should have no bearing uponthe determination of whether the restriction is so substantial
as to constitute a taking. The "investment-backed expecta-tions" that the law will take into account do not include the
assumed validity of a restriction that in fact deprives prop-erty of so much of its value as to be unconstitutional. Which
is to say that a Penn Central taking, see Penn Central
Transp. Co. v. New York City, 438 U. S. 104 (1978), no lessthan a total taking, is not absolved by the transfer of title.

Justice Stevens, concurring in part and dissenting inpart.

exceeded its police powers by ignoring the "public use" requirement of the
Takings Clause, see Hawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff, 467 U. S. 229,

public use, without tendering just compensation.

lenge regulations adopted prior to her acquisition of thatproperty without ever discussing the particular facts or legal

claims at issue in this case. See ante, at 626-630. While Iagree with some of what the Court has to say on this issue,
an examination of the issue in the context of the facts of thiscase convinces me that the Court has oversimplified a complex calculus and conflated two separate questions. There-fore, while I join Part II-A of the opinion, I dissent from the
judgment and, in particular, from Part II-B.

I
Though States and local governments have broad powerto adopt regulations limiting land usage, those powers are

constrained by the Constitution and by other provisions ofstate law. In adopting land-use restrictions, local authorities must follow legally valid and constitutionally sufficientprocedures and must adhere to whatever substantive requirements are imposed by the Constitution and superveninglaw. If a regulating body fails to adhere to its procedural or
substantive obligations in developing land-use restrictions,anyone adversely impacted by the restrictions may challenge
their validity in an injunctive action. If the application ofsuch restriction to a property owner would cause her a "direct and substantial injury," e. g., Chicago v. Atchison, T. &
S. F. R. Co., 357 U. S. 77, 83 (1958), I have no doubt that shehas standing to challenge the restriction's validity whether

she acquired title to the property before or after the regula-tion was adopted. For, as the Court correctly observes,
even future generations "have a right to challenge unrea-sonable limitations on the use and value of land." Ante,
at 627.It by no means follows, however, that, as the Court assumes, a succeeding owner may obtain compensation for ataking of property from her predecessor in interest. A taking is a discrete event, a governmental acquisition of privateproperty for which the State is required to provide just compensation. Like other transfers of property, it occurs at a

particular time, that time being the moment when the rele-vant property interest is alienated from its owner.

1

Precise specification of the moment a taking occurred andof the nature of the property interest taken is necessary in

order to determine an appropriately compensatory remedy.For example, the amount of the award is measured by the
value of the property at the time of taking, not the value atsome later date. Similarly, interest on the award runs from
that date. Most importantly for our purposes today, it is theperson who owned the property at the time of the taking
that is entitled to the recovery. See, e. g., Danforth v.
United States, 308 U. S. 271, 284 (1939) ("For the reason thatcompensation is due at the time of taking, the owner at that

time, not the owner at an earlier or later date, receives thepayment"). The rationale behind that rule is true whether
the transfer of ownership is the result of an arm's-lengthnegotiation, an inheritance, or the dissolution of a bankrupt
debtor. Cf. United States v. Dow, 357 U. S. 17, 20-21 (1958).2

1 A regulation that goes so "far" that it violates the Takings Clause may
give rise to an award of compensation or it may simply be invalidated
as it would be if it violated any other constitutional principle (with the
consequence that the State must choose between adopting a new regulatory scheme that provides compensation or forgoing regulation). While
some recent Court opinions have focused on the former remedy, Justice
Holmes appears to have had a regime focusing on the latter in mind in the
opinion that began the modern preoccupation with "regulatory takings."
See Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U. S. 393, 414 (1922) (because
the statute in question takes private property without just compensation
"the act cannot be sustained").

2 The Court argues, ante, at 628, that a regulatory taking is different

from a direct state appropriation of property and that the rules this Court
has developed for identifying the time of the latter do not apply to the
former. This is something of an odd conclusion, in that the entire rationale for allowing compensation for regulations in the first place is the somewhat dubious proposition that some regulations go so "far" as to become
the functional equivalent of a direct taking. Ultimately, the Court's
regulations-are-different principle rests on the confusion of two dates: the
time an injury occurs and the time a claim for compensation for that injury
becomes cognizable in a judicial proceeding. That we require plaintiffs
making the claim that a regulation is the equivalent of a taking to go

Opinion of Stevens, J.

Much of the difficulty of this case stems from genuine confusion as to when the taking Palazzolo alleges actually oc-curred. According to Palazzolo's theory of the case, the

owners of his Westerly, Rhode Island, property possessedthe right to fill the wetland portion of the property at some
point in the not-too-distant past.3 In 1971, the State ofRhode Island passed a statute creating the Rhode Island
Coastal Resources Management Council (Council) and dele-gating the Council the authority to promulgate regulations
restricting the usage of coastal land. See 1971 R. I. Pub.
through certain prelitigation procedures to clarify the scope of the allegedly infringing regulation does not mean that the injury did not occur
before those procedures were completed. To the contrary, whenever the
relevant local bodies construe their regulations, their construction is assumed to reflect "what the [regulation] meant before as well as after the
decision giving rise to that construction." Rivers v. Roadway Express,
Inc., 511 U. S. 298, 312-313 (1994).

3 This point is the subject of significant dispute, as the State of Rhode

Island has presented substantial evidence that limitations on coastal development have always precluded or limited schemes such as Palazzolo's.
See Brief for Respondents 11-12, 41-46. Nonetheless, we must assume
that it is true for the purposes of deciding this question.

Likewise, we must assume for the purposes of deciding the discrete
threshold questions before us that petitioner's complaint states a potentially valid regulatory takings claim. Nonetheless, for the sake of clarity
it is worth emphasizing that, on my view, even a newly adopted regulation that diminishes the value of property does not produce a significant
Takings Clause issue if it (1) is generally applicable and (2) is directed
at preventing a substantial public harm. Cf. Lucas v. South Carolina
Coastal Council, 505 U. S. 1003, 1029 (1992) (owner of a powerplant astride
an earthquake fault does not state a valid takings claim for regulation
requiring closure of plant); id., at 1035 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment) (explaining that the government's power to regulate against harmful uses of property without paying compensation is not limited by the
common law of nuisance because that doctrine is "too narrow a confine
for the exercise of regulatory power in a complex and interdependent
society"). It is quite likely that a regulation prohibiting the filling of
wetlands meets those criteria.

Laws, ch. 279, $ 1 et seq. The Council promptly adoptedregulations that, inter alia, effectively foreclosed petitioner

from filling his wetlands. See ante, at 614; cf. App. to Brieffor Respondents 11-22 (current version of regulations). As
the regulations nonetheless provided for a process throughwhich petitioner might seek permission to fill the wetlands,
he filed two applications for such permission during the1980's, both of which were denied. See

ante, at 614-615.The most natural reading of petitioner's complaint is that

the regulations in and of themselves precluded him from fill-ing the wetlands, and that their adoption therefore constituted the alleged taking. This reading is consistent withthe Court's analysis in Part II-A of its opinion (which I join)
in which the Court explains that petitioner's takings claimsare ripe for decision because respondents' wetlands regulations unequivocally provide that there can be "no fill for anylikely or foreseeable use." Ante, at 621.

4 If it is the regulations themselves of which petitioner complains, and if theydid, in fact, diminish the value of his property, they did so

when they were adopted.To the extent that the adoption of the regulations constitute the challenged taking, petitioner is simply the wrongparty to be bringing this action. If the regulations imposed
a compensable injury on anyone, it was on the owner of theproperty at the moment the regulations were adopted.
Given the trial court's finding that petitioner did not own theproperty at that time,

5 in my judgment it is pellucidly clear

4 At oral argument, petitioner's counsel stated: "I think the key here is
understanding that no filling of any wetland would be allowed for any
reason that was lawful under the local zoning code. No structures of any
kind would be permitted by Mr. Palazzolo to construct. So we know that
he cannot use his wetland." Tr. of Oral Arg. 14.

5 See App. to Pet. for Cert. A-13 ("[T]he trial justice found that Palazzolo could not have become the owner of the property before 1978, at
which time the regulations limiting his ability to fill the wetlands were

that he has no standing to claim that the promulgation of theregulations constituted a taking of any part of the property

that he subsequently acquired.His lack of standing does not depend, as the Court seems
to assume, on whether or not petitioner "is deemed to havenotice of an earlier-enacted restriction," ante, at 626. If
those early regulations changed the character of the owner'stitle to the property, thereby diminishing its value, petitioner
acquired only the net value that remained after that dimin-ishment occurred. Of course, if, as respondents contend, see
n. 3, supra, even the prior owner never had any right to fillwetlands, there never was a basis for the alleged takings
claim in the first place. But accepting petitioner's theory ofthe case, he has no standing to complain that preacquisition
events may have reduced the value of the property that heacquired. If the regulations are invalid, either because improper procedures were followed when they were adopted,or because they have somehow gone "too far,"

Pennsylvania
Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U. S. 393, 415 (1922), petitioner mayseek to enjoin their enforcement, but he has no right to recover compensation for the value of property taken fromsomeone else. A new owner may maintain an ejectment action against a trespasser who has lodged himself in the own-er's orchard but surely could not recover damages for fruit
a trespasser spirited from the orchard before he acquiredthe property.

The Court's holding in Nollan v. California CoastalComm'n, 483 U. S. 825 (1987), is fully consistent with this
analysis. In that case the taking occurred when the stateagency compelled the petitioners to provide an easement of
public access to the beach as a condition for a developmentpermit. That event--a compelled transfer of an interest in
property--occurred after the petitioners had become theowner of the property and unquestionably diminished the

value of petitioners' property. Even though they had noticewhen they bought the property that such a taking might

occur, they never contended that any action taken by theState before their purchase gave rise to any right to compensation. The matter of standing to assert a claim for justcompensation is determined by the impact of the event that
is alleged to have amounted to a taking rather than the sortof notice that a purchaser may or may not have received
when the property was transferred. Petitioners in Nollanowned the property at the time of the triggering event.
Therefore, they and they alone could claim a right to com-pensation for the injury.

6 Their successors in interest, like

petitioner in this case, have no standing to bring such aclaim.

III
At oral argument, petitioner contended that the taking inquestion occurred in 1986, when the Council denied his final

application to fill the land. Tr. of Oral Arg. 16. Though thistheory, to the extent that it was embraced within petitioner's
actual complaint, complicates the issue, it does not altermy conclusion that the prohibition on filling the wetlands
does not take from Palazzolo any property right he everpossessed.

The title Palazzolo took by operation of law in 1978 waslimited by the regulations then in place to the extent that
such regulations represented a valid exercise of the policepower. For the reasons expressed above, I think the regulations barred petitioner from filling the wetlands on hisproperty. At the very least, however, they established a
rule that such lands could not be filled unless the Council

6 In cases such as Nollan--in which landowners have notice of a regulation when they purchase a piece of property but the regulatory event
constituting the taking does not occur until after they take title to the
property--I would treat the owners' notice as relevant to the evaluation
of whether the regulation goes "too far," but not necessarily dispositive.

exercised its authority to make exceptions to that rule undercertain circumstances. Cf. App. to Brief for Respondents

A-13 (laying out narrow circumstances under which theCouncil retains the discretion to grant a "special exception").
Under the reading of the regulations most favorable to Pa-lazzolo, he acquired no more than the right to a discretionary
determination by the Council as to whether to permit him tofill the wetlands. As his two hearings before that body attest, he was given the opportunity to make a presentationand receive such a determination. Thus, the Council properly respected whatever limited rights he may have retainedwith regard to filling the wetlands. Cf.

Lujan v. G & G FireSprinklers, Inc., 532 U. S. 189 (2001) (holding, in a different

context, that, if a party's only relevant property interest is aclaim of entitlement to bring an action, the provision of a
forum for hearing that action is all that is required to vindi-cate that property interest);

Lopez v. Davis, 531 U. S. 230
(2001) (involving a federal statute that created an entitle-ment to a discretionary hearing without creating any entitlement to relief).7

Though the majority leaves open the possibility that thescope of today's holding may prove limited, see

land-use decisions from the Takings Clause simply by referencing longstanding statutory provisions. If the determination by the regulators to
reject the project involves such an unforseeable interpretation or extension of the regulation as to amount to a change in the law, then it is appropriate to consider the decision of that body, rather than the adoption of the
regulation, as the discrete event that deprived the owner of a pre-existing
interest in property. But, if that is petitioner's theory, his claim is not
ripe for the reasons stated by Justice Ginsburg in her dissenting opinion, post, p. 645. As I read petitioner's complaint and the Court's disposition of the ripeness issue, it is the regulations themselves that allegedly
deprived the owner of the parcel of the right to fill the wetlands.

Breyer, J., dissenting) (same), the extension ofthe right to compensation to individuals other than the direct

victim of an illegal taking admits of no obvious limiting prin-ciple. If the existence of valid land-use regulations does not
limit the title that the first postenactment purchaser of theproperty inherits, then there is no reason why such regulations should limit the rights of the second, the third, or thethirtieth purchaser. Perhaps my concern is unwarranted,
but today's decision does raise the spectre of a tremendous--and tremendously capricious--one-time transfer of wealth
from society at large to those individuals who happen to holdtitle to large tracts of land at the moment this legal question
is permanently resolved. IV

In the final analysis, the property interest at stake in thislitigation is the right to fill the wetlands on the tract that
petitioner owns. Whether either he or his predecessors intitle ever owned such an interest, and if so, when it was acquired by the State, are questions of state law. If it isclear--as I think it is and as I think the Court's disposition
of the ripeness issue assumes--that any such taking occurredbefore he became the owner of the property, he has no standing to seek compensation for that taking. On the otherhand, if the only viable takings claim has a different predicate that arose later, that claim is not ripe and the discussionin Part II-B of the Court's opinion is superfluous dictum.
In either event, the judgment of the Rhode Island SupremeCourt should be affirmed in its entirety.

Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Souter and
Justice Breyer join, dissenting.

A regulatory takings claim is not ripe for adjudication, thisCourt has held, until the agency administering the regulations at issue, proceeding in good faith, "has arrived at afinal, definitive position regarding how it will apply [those

of Johnson City, 473 U. S. 172, 191 (1985). Absent such afinal decision, a court cannot "kno[w] the nature and extent

of permitted development" under the regulations, and there-fore cannot say "how far the regulation[s] g[o]," as regulatory
takings law requires. MacDonald, Sommer & Frates v.
Yolo County, 477 U. S. 340, 348, 351 (1986). Therefore, evenwhen a landowner seeks and is denied permission to develop

property, if the denial does not demonstrate the effective im-pact of the regulations on the land, the denial does not represent the "final decision" requisite to generate a ripe dispute.
Williamson County, 473 U. S., at 190.

MacDonald illustrates how a highly ambitious application
may not ripen a takings claim. The landowner in that case
proposed a 159-home subdivision. 477 U. S., at 342. When
that large proposal was denied, the owner complained that
the State had appropriated "all beneficial use of its property." Id., at 352, n. 8; see also id., at 344. This Court concluded, however, that the landowner's claim was not ripe,
for the denial of the massive development left "open the possibility that some development [would] be permitted." Id.,
at 352. "Rejection of exceedingly grandiose development
plans," the Court observed, "does not logically imply that
less ambitious plans will receive similarly unfavorable reviews." Id., at 353, n. 9.

As presented to the Rhode Island Supreme Court, Anthony Palazzolo's case was a close analogue to MacDonald.
Palazzolo's land has two components. Approximately 18
acres are wetlands that sustain a rich but delicate ecosystem.
See 746 A. 2d 707, 710, and n. 1 (R. I. 2000). Additional
acres are less environmentally sensitive "uplands." (The
number of upland acres remains in doubt, see ibid., because
Palazzolo has never submitted "an accurate or detailed survey" of his property, see Tr. 190 (June 18-19, 1997).) Rhode

thority over the wetlands, the Coastal Resources Manage-ment Council (CRMC), bars residential development of the

wetlands, but not the uplands.Although Palazzolo submitted several applications to develop his property, those applications uniformly sought per-mission to fill most or all of the wetlands portion of the property. None aimed to develop only the uplands.1 Upondenial of the last of Palazzolo's applications, Palazzolo filed
suit claiming that Rhode Island had taken his property byrefusing "to allow any development." App. 45 (Complaint
|| 17).As the Rhode Island Supreme Court saw the case, Palazzolo's claim was not ripe for several reasons, among them,that Palazzolo had not sought permission for "development
only of the upland portion of the parcel." 746 A. 2d, at 714.The Rhode Island court emphasized the "undisputed evidence in the record that it would be possible to build at leastone single-family home on the existing upland area, with no
need for additional fill." Ibid.Today, the Court rejects the Rhode Island court's determination that the case is unripe, finding no "uncertainty as to

1 Moreover, none proposed the 74-lot subdivision Palazzolo advances as
the basis for the compensation he seeks. Palazzolo's first application
sought to fill all 18 acres of wetlands for no stated purpose whatever. See
App. 11 (Palazzolo's sworn 1983 answer to the question why he sought to
fill uplands) ("Because it's my right to do if I want to to look at it it is my
business."). Palazzolo's second application proposed a most disagreeable
"beach club." See ante, at 615 ("trash bins" and "port-a-johns" sought);
Tr. 650 (June 25-26, 1997) (testimony of engineer Steven M. Clarke) (to
get to the club's water, i. e., Winnapaug Pond rather than the nearby Atlantic Ocean, "you'd have to walk across the gravel fill, but then work
your way through approximately 70, 75 feet of marsh land or conservation
grasses"). Neither of the CRMC applications supplied a clear map of the
proposed development. See App. 7, 16 (1983 application); Tr. 190 (June
18-19, 1997) (1985 application). The Rhode Island Supreme Court ultimately concluded that the 74-lot development would have been barred by
zoning requirements, apart from CRMC regulations, requirements Palazzolo never explored. See 746 A. 2d 707, 715, n. 7 (2000).

the [uplands'] permitted use." Ante, at 622. The Court'sconclusion is, in my view, both inaccurate and inequitable.

It is inaccurate because the record is ambiguous. And it isinequitable because, given the claim asserted by Palazzolo in
the Rhode Island courts, the State had no cause to pursuefurther inquiry into potential upland development. But Palazzolo presses other claims here, and at his behest, theCourt not only entertains them, but also turns the State's
legitimate defense against the claim Palazzolo originallystated into a weapon against the State. I would reject Palazzolo's bait-and-switch ploy and affirm the judgment of theRhode Island Supreme Court.

Where physical occupation of land is not at issue, theCourt's cases identify two basic forms of regulatory taking.

Ante, at 617. In Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council,505 U. S. 1003 (1992), the Court held that, subject to "certain
qualifications," ante, at 617, 629, denial of "all economicallybeneficial or productive use of land" constitutes a taking.
505 U. S., at 1015 (emphasis added). However, if a regula-tion does not leave the property "economically idle,"

Co. v. New York City, 438 U. S. 104, 123-125 (1978).Like the landowner in MacDonald, Palazzolo sought federal constitutional relief only under a straightforward appli-cation of Lucas. See ante, at 615-616; App. 45 (Complaint

by the State to prove, intimate or even suggest a theoreticalpossibility of

any use for this property--never mind a beneficial use. Not once did the State claim that there is, in fact,some use available for the Palazzolo parcel."); Brief of Appellant in No. 98-0333, pp. 5, 7, 9-10 (hereinafter Brief of Appel-lant) (restating, verbatim, assertions of Post Trial Memorandum quoted above).

Responding to Palazzolo's Lucas claim, the State urged asa sufficient defense this now uncontested point: CRMC

"would [have been] happy to have [Palazzolo] situate a home"on the uplands, "thus allowing [him] to realize 200,000
dollars." State's Post-Trial Memorandum in No. 88-0297
(Super. Ct., R. I.), p. 81; see also Brief of Appellees in
No. 98-0333A, p. 25 (hereinafter Brief of Appellees) (Palazzolo "never even applied for the realistic alternative of using
the entire parcel as a single unitary home-site"). The State
did present some evidence at trial that more than one lot
could be developed. See infra, at 653-654. And, in a supplemental post-trial memorandum addressing a then new
Rhode Island Supreme Court decision, the State briefly
urged that Palazzolo's claims would fail even under Penn
Central. See ante, at 624. The evidence of additional uses
and the post-trial argument directed to Penn Central, however, were underdeveloped and unnecessary, for Palazzolo
himself, in his pleadings and at trial, pressed only a Lucasbased claim that he had been denied all economically viable
use of his property. Once the State demonstrated that an
"economically beneficial" development was genuinely plausible, Lucas, 505 U. S., at 1015, the State had established the
analogy to MacDonald: The record now showed "valuable
use might still be made of the land." 477 U. S., at 352, n. 8;
see Brief of Appellees 24-25 (relying on MacDonald). The
prospect of real development shown by the State warranted
a ripeness dismissal of Palazzolo's complaint.

Addressing the State's Lucas defense in Lucas terms, Palazzolo insisted that his land had "no use . . . as a result of

CRMC's application of its regulations." Brief of Appellant11. The Rhode Island Supreme Court rejected Palazzolo's

argument, identifying in the record evidence that Palazzolocould build at least one home on the uplands. 746 A. 2d, at
714. The court therefore concluded that Palazzolo's failureto seek permission for "development only of the upland portion of the parcel" meant that Palazzolo could not "maintain
a claim that the CRMC ha[d] deprived him of all beneficialuse of the property."

Ibid.
It is true that the Rhode Island courts, in the course ofruling for the State, briefly touched base with

Penn Central.
Cf. ante, at 624. The critical point, however, underplayed
by the Court, is that Palazzolo never raised or argued the
Penn Central issue in the state system: not in his complaint;
not in his trial court submissions; not--even after the trial
court touched on the Penn Central issue--in his briefing on
appeal. The state high court decision, raising and quickly
disposing of the matter, unquestionably permits us to consider the Penn Central issue. See Raley v. Ohio, 360 U. S.
423, 436-437 (1959). But the ruling below does not change
the reality essential here: Palazzolo litigated his takings
claim, and it was incumbent on the State to defend against
that claim, only under Lucas.

If Palazzolo's arguments in this Court had tracked his arguments in the state courts, his petition for certiorari would
have argued simply that the Rhode Island courts got it
wrong in failing to see that his land had "no use" at all because of CRMC's rules. Brief of Appellant 11. This Court
likely would not have granted certiorari to review the application of MacDonald and Lucas to the facts of Palazzolo's
case. However, aided by new counsel, Palazzolo sought--
and in the exercise of this Court's discretion obtained--review of two contentions he did not advance below. The first
assertion is that the state regulations take the property
under Penn Central. See Pet. for Cert. 20; Brief for Petitioner 47-50. The second argument is that the regulations

533US2 Unit: $U85 [10-19-02 15:38:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
amount to a taking under an expanded rendition of Lucascovering cases in which a landowner is left with property

retaining only a "few crumbs of value." Ante, at 631 (quot-ing Brief for Petitioner 37); Pet. for Cert. 20-22. Again, it
bears repetition, Palazzolo never claimed in the courts belowthat, if the State were correct that his land could be used for
a residence, a taking nonetheless occurred.2

In support of his new claims, Palazzolo has conceded thevery point on which the State properly relied to resist the

simple Lucas claim presented below: that Palazzolo can ob-tain approval for one house of substantial economic value.
Palazzolo does not merely accept the argument that theState advanced below. He now contends that the evidence
proffered by the State in the Rhode Island courts supportsthe claims he presents here, by demonstrating that

only one
house would be approved. See Brief for Petitioner 13("[T]he uncontradicted evidence was that CRMC . . . would

not deny [Palazzolo] permission to build one single-family
home on the small upland portion of his property." (emphasis
deleted)); Pet. for Cert. 15 (the extent of development permitted on the land is "perfectly clear: one single-family home
and nothing more").

As a logical matter, Palazzolo's argument does not stand
up. The State's submissions in the Rhode Island courts
hardly establish that Palazzolo could obtain approval for
only one house of value. By showing that Palazzolo could
have obtained approval for a $200,000 house (rather than,
say, two houses worth $400,000), the State's submissions established only a floor, not a ceiling, on the value of permissi2 After this Court granted certiorari, in his briefing on the merits, Palazzolo presented still another takings theory. That theory, in tension with
numerous holdings of this Court, see, e. g., Concrete Pipe & Products of
Cal., Inc. v. Construction Laborers Pension Trust for Southern Cal., 508
U. S. 602, 643-644 (1993), was predicated on treatment of his wetlands as

reach this claim. Ante, at 631.

ble development. For a floor value was all the State neededto defeat Palazzolo's simple

Lucas claim.
Furthermore, Palazzolo's argument is unfair: The argu-ment transforms the State's legitimate defense to the only

claim Palazzolo stated below into offensive support for otherclaims he states for the first time here. Casting away fairness (and fairness to a State, no less), the Court indulges
Palazzolo's bait-and-switch maneuver. The Court concludesthat "there is no genuine ambiguity in the record as to

the extent of permitted development on . . . the uplands."
Ante, at 623. Two theories are offered to support this
conclusion.

First, the Court asserts, it is "too late in the day" for the
State to contend the uplands give the property more than
$200,000 in value; Palazzolo "stated" in his petition for certiorari that the property has "an estimated worth of $200,000,"
and the State cited that contention "as fact" in its Brief
in Opposition. Ante, at 622. But in the cited pages of its
Brief in Opposition, the State simply said it "would" approve
a "single home" worth $200,000. Brief in Opposition 4, 19.
That statement does not foreclose the possibility that the
State would also approve another home, adding further
value to the property.

To be sure, the Brief in Opposition did overlook Palazzolo's
change in his theory of the case, a change that, had it been
asserted earlier, could have rendered insufficient the evidence the State intelligently emphasized below. But the
State's failure to appreciate that Palazzolo had moved the
pea to a different shell hardly merits the Court's waiver
finding. The only precedent cited for the waiver, a footnote
in Lucas, is not remotely on point. Ante, at 622. The landowner in Lucas had invoked a "finding" of fact by the state
court, and this Court deemed the State's challenge to that
finding waived because the challenge was not timely raised.
505 U. S., at 1020-1022, n. 9. There is nothing extraordinary
about this Court's deciding a case on the findings made by a

state court. Here, however, the "fact" this Court hasstopped the State from contesting--that the property has

value of only $200,000--was never found by any court.That valuation was simply asserted, inaccurately, see

infra
this page and 654, in Palazzolo's petition for certiorari. ThisCourt's waiver ruling thus amounts to an unsavory invitation

to unscrupulous litigants: Change your theory and misrepresent the record in your petition for certiorari; if the respond-ent fails to note your machinations, you have created a different record on which this Court will review the case.The Court bolsters its waiver finding by asserting that the
$200,000 figure is "well founded" in the record. Ante, at 623.
But, as earlier observed, an absence of multiple valuation
possibilities in the record cannot be held against the State,
for proof of more than the $200,000 development was unnecessary to defend against the Lucas claim singularly pleaded
below. And in any event, the record does not warrant the
Court's conclusion.

The Court acknowledges "testimony at trial suggesting
the existence of an additional upland parcel elsewhere on the
property" on which a second house might be built. Ante,
at 623. The Court discounts that prospect, however, on the
ground that development of the additional parcel would require a new road forbidden under CRMC's regulations.
Ibid. Yet the one witness on whose testimony the Court
relies, Steven M. Clarke, himself concluded that it would be
"realistic to apply for" development at more than one location. Tr. 612 (June 25-26, 1997). Clarke added that a state
official, Russell Chateauneuf, "gave [Clarke] supporting information saying that [multiple applications] made sense."
Ibid. The conclusions of Clarke and Chateauneuf are confirmed by the testimony of CRMC's executive director,
Grover Fugate, who agreed with Palazzolo's counsel during
cross-examination that Palazzolo might be able to build "on
two, perhaps three, perhaps four of the lots." Id., at 211
(June 20-23, 1997); see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 27 ("[T]here

The ambiguities in the record thus are substantial. Theypersist in part because their resolution was not required to
address the claim Palazzolo presented below, and in part be-cause Palazzolo failed ever to submit an accurate survey of
his property. Under the circumstances, I would not stepinto the role of supreme topographical factfinder to resolve
ambiguities in Palazzolo's favor. Instead, I would look to,and rely on, the opinion of the state court whose decision
we now review. That opinion states: "There was undisputedevidence in the record that it would be possible to build

atleast one single-family home on the existing upland area."

In sum, as I see this case, we still do not know "the natureand extent of permitted development" under the regulation

Justice Breyer, dissenting.
I agree with Justice Ginsburg that Palazzolo's takingsclaim is not ripe for adjudication, and I join her opinion in

full. Ordinarily I would go no further. But because theCourt holds the takings claim to be ripe and goes on to address some important issues of substantive takings law, I addthat, given this Court's precedents, I would agree with

Justice O'Connor that the simple fact that a piece of propertyhas changed hands (for example, by inheritance) does not

always and automatically bar a takings claim. Here, forexample, without in any way suggesting that Palazzolo has

any valid takings claim, I believe his postregulatory acquisi-tion of the property (through automatic operation of law) by
itself should not prove dispositive.As

Justice O'Connor explains, under Penn Central
Transp. Co. v. New York City, 438 U. S. 104 (1978), muchdepends upon whether, or how, the timing and circumstances of a change of ownership affect whatever reasonableinvestment-backed expectations might otherwise exist. Ordinarily, such expectations will diminish in force and signifi-cance--rapidly and dramatically--as property continues to
change hands over time. I believe that such factors canadequately be taken into account within the

Penn Centralframework.

Several amici have warned that to allow complete regula-tory takings claims, see Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal
Council, 505 U. S. 1003 (1992), to survive changes in landownership could allow property owners to manufacture such
claims by strategically transferring property until only anonusable portion remains. See,

e. g., Brief for Daniel W.Bromley et al. as Amici Curiae 7-8. But I do not see how

a constitutional provision concerned with " `fairness and jus-tice,' " Penn Central, supra, at 123-124 (quoting Armstrong
v. United States, 364 U. S. 40, 49 (1960)), could reward anysuch strategic behavior.

TYLER v. CAIN, WARDEN
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 00-5961. Argued April 16, 2001--Decided June 28, 2001
After petitioner Tyler was convicted of second-degree murder and his conviction was affirmed on appeal, he filed five Louisiana state-court petitions for postconviction relief and a federal habeas petition, all of which
were denied. After this Court decided Cage v. Louisiana, 498 U. S.
39--under which a jury instruction is unconstitutional if there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury understood it to allow conviction without
proof beyond a reasonable doubt--Tyler filed a sixth state petition,
claiming that a jury instruction in his trial was substantively identical
to the one condemned in Cage. The State District Court denied relief,
and the State Supreme Court affirmed. Seeking to pursue his Cage
claim in federal court, Tyler moved the Fifth Circuit for permission to
file a second habeas application, as required by the Antiterrorism and
Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). The court granted the
motion. The District Court then proceeded to the merits of Tyler's
claim and denied relief. Although the Fifth Circuit affirmed, it stated
that the District Court had erred by failing first to determine whether
Tyler had satisfied AEDPA's successive habeas standard, which requires
a district court to dismiss a claim in a second or successive application
unless, as relevant here, the applicant "shows" that the "claim relies on
a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral
review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable." 28
U. S. C. $ 2244(b)(2)(A) (emphasis added). Relying on Circuit precedent,
the court concluded that Tyler did not meet this standard.

Held: The Cage rule was not "made retroactive to cases on collateral

review by the Supreme Court," within the meaning of $ 2244(b)(2)(A).
Pp. 661-668.

(a) Based on $ 2244(b)(2)(A)'s plain meaning when read as a whole,
"made" means "held." Under the statute, this Court is the only entity
that can "ma[k]e" a new rule retroactive. The new rule becomes retroactive, not by the decisions of the lower court or by the combined action
of the Supreme Court and the lower courts, but simply by the action of
the Supreme Court. The only way the Supreme Court can, by itself,
lay out and construct a rule's retroactive effect is through a holding.
This Court does not "ma[k]e" a rule retroactive when it merely estab533US2 Unit: $U86 [10-19-02 15:45:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN

lishes principles of retroactivity and leaves their application to lower
courts. In such an event, the lower court (or perhaps a combination of
courts), not the Supreme Court, develops any legal conclusion derived
from those principles. Although the statute uses the word "made," not
"held," Congress is permitted to use synonyms in a statute, see Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, and "made" and "held" are synonyms
in the $ 2244(b)(2)(A) context. This interpretation is necessary for the
proper implementation of AEDPA's collateral review structure. The
stringent 30-day time period that $ 2244(b)(3)(D) imposes on courts of
appeals determining whether an application "makes a prima facie showing that [it] satisfies the [second habeas standard]," $ 2244(b)(3)(C), suggests that those courts do not have to engage in the difficult legal analysis that can be required to determine questions of retroactivity in the
first instance, but need only rely on Supreme Court retroactivity holdings. Pp. 662-664.

(b) The Cage rule has not been "made retroactive . . . by the Supreme
Court." Cage did not make itself retroactive, and neither did Sullivan
v. Louisiana, 508 U. S. 275, 279. Tyler contends that Sullivan's reasoning makes it clear that retroactive application of Cage is warranted by
the principles of Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288, 311-313, in which the
Court held that a new rule can be retroactive to cases on collateral
review only if it falls within one of two narrow exceptions to the general
rule of nonretroactivity. However, the most Tyler can claim is that,
based on Teague's principles, this Court should make Cage retroactive
to cases on collateral review. It is clear, however, that the Court has
not done so. Although the Court can make a rule retroactive over the
course of two cases, it has not done so here. Pp. 664-667.

(c) This Court declines to make Cage retroactive today. Because
Tyler's habeas application was his second, the District Court was required to dismiss it unless Tyler showed that this Court already had
made Cage retroactive. This Court cannot decide today whether Cage
is retroactive to cases on collateral review, because that decision will not
help Tyler in this case. Any statement on Cage's retroactivity would
be dictum, so this Court declines to comment further on the issue.
Pp. 667-668.

During a fight with his estranged girlfriend in March 1975,petitioner Melvin Tyler shot and killed their 20-day-old

daughter. A jury found Tyler guilty of second-degree mur-der, and his conviction was affirmed on appeal. After sentencing, Tyler assiduously sought postconviction relief. By1986, he had filed five state petitions, all of which were denied. See State ex rel. Tyler v. Blackburn, 494 So. 2d 1171(La. 1986); State v. Tyler, 446 So. 2d 1226 (La. 1984); State
ex rel. Tyler v. State, 437 So. 2d 1142 (La. 1983); State v.Tyler, 430 So. 2d 92 (La. 1983); State ex rel. Tyler v. Maggio,
428 So. 2d 483 (La. 1982). He next filed a federal habeaspetition, which was unsuccessful as well. Tyler v. Butler,
No. 88cv4929 (ED La.), aff 'd, Tyler v. Whitley, 920 F. 2d 929(CA5 1990). After this Court's decision in Cage, Tyler continued his efforts. Because the jury instruction definingreasonable doubt at Tyler's trial was substantively identical
to the instruction condemned in Cage, Tyler filed a sixthstate postconviction petition, this time raising a

Cage claim.The State District Court denied relief, and the Louisiana

Supreme Court affirmed. State ex rel. Tyler v. Cain, 684So. 2d 950 (1996).

In early 1997, Tyler returned to federal court. Seekingto pursue his Cage claim, Tyler moved the United States

and n. 4 (1991), however, this Court made clear that the proper inquiry is
not whether the instruction "could have" been applied unconstitutionally,
but whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury did so apply
it. See also Victor v. Nebraska, 511 U. S. 1, 6 (1994) ("The constitutional
question in the present cases . . . is whether there is a reasonable likelihood
that the jury understood the instructions to allow conviction based on
proof insufficient to meet the [constitutional] standard").

Opinion of the Court
Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit for permission to filea second habeas corpus application, as required by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA),110 Stat. 1214.

2 The Court of Appeals recognized that it

could not grant the motion unless Tyler made "a prima facieshowing," $ 2244(b)(3)(C), that his "claim relies on a new rule

of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateralreview by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable," $ 2244(b)(2)(A). Finding that Tyler had made the req-uisite prima facie showing, the Court of Appeals granted the
motion, thereby allowing Tyler to file a habeas petition inDistrict Court.

The District Court proceeded to the merits of Tyler's claimand held that, although

Cage should apply retroactively, App.5-7 (citing Humphrey v. Cain, 138 F. 3d 552 (CA5 1998)

(en banc)), Tyler was not entitled to collateral relief. UnderAEDPA, a state prisoner can prevail only if the state court's
decision "was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable ap-plication of, clearly established Federal law, as determined
by the Supreme Court of the United States." $ 2254(d)(1).Concluding that Tyler could not overcome this barrier, the
District Court denied his petition.The Court of Appeals affirmed. Judgt. order reported at
218 F. 3d 744 (CA5 2000). It stated, however, that the Dis-trict Court erred by failing first to determine whether Tyler
"satisfied AEDPA's successive habeas standard." App. 15.AEDPA requires a district court to dismiss a claim in a second or successive application unless, as relevant here, theapplicant "shows" that the "claim relies on a new rule of
constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral

is filed in the district court, the applicant shall move in the appropriate

able," 3 $ 2244(b)(2)(A) (emphasis added); $ 2244(b)(4). Rely-ing on Circuit precedent, see Brown v. Lensing, 171 F. 3d

1031 (CA5 1999); In re Smith, 142 F. 3d 832 (CA5 1998), theCourt of Appeals concluded that Tyler did not meet this
standard because he "could not show that any SupremeCourt decision renders the Cage decision retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review." App. 15.The Courts of Appeals are divided on the question
whether Cage was "made retroactive to cases on collateralreview by the Supreme Court," as required by 28 U. S. C.

$ 2244(b)(2)(A). Compare Rodriguez v. Superintendent, 139F. 3d 270 (CA1 1998) (holding that

Cage has not been maderetroactive by the Supreme Court); Brown, supra (same);

In re Hill, 113 F. 3d 181 (CA11 1997) (same), with West v.Vaughn, 204 F. 3d 53 (CA3 2000) (holding that Cage has been
made retroactive to cases on collateral review). To resolvethis conflict, we granted certiorari. 531 U. S. 1051 (2000).

AEDPA greatly restricts the power of federal courts toaward relief to state prisoners who file second or successive

habeas corpus applications. If the prisoner asserts a claimthat he has already presented in a previous federal habeas petition, the claim must be dismissed in all cases.$ 2244(b)(1). And if the prisoner asserts a claim that was
not presented in a previous petition, the claim must be dis-missed unless it falls within one of two narrow exceptions.
One of these exceptions is for claims predicated on newly

3 This requirement differs from the one that applicants must satisfy in
order to obtain permission from a court of appeals to file a second or
successive petition. As noted above, a court of appeals may authorize
such a filing only if it determines that the applicant makes a "prima
facie showing" that the application satisfies the statutory standard.

$ 2244(b)(3)(C). But to survive dismissal in district court, the applicant
must actually "sho[w]" that the claim satisfies the standard.

Opinion of the Court
discovered facts that call into question the accuracy ofa guilty verdict. $ 2244(b)(2)(B). The other is for certain claims relying on new rules of constitutional law.$ 2244(b)(2)(A).

It is the latter exception that concerns us today. Specifi-cally, $ 2244(b)(2)(A) covers claims that "rel[y] on a new rule
of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateralreview by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable." This provision establishes three prerequisites to ob-taining relief in a second or successive petition: First, the
rule on which the claim relies must be a "new rule" of consti-tutional law; second, the rule must have been "made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court";and third, the claim must have been "previously unavailable." In this case, the parties ask us to interpret only thesecond requirement; respondent does not dispute that

Cagecreated a "new rule" that was "previously unavailable."

Based on the plain meaning of the text read as a whole, weconclude that "made" means "held" and, thus, the requirement is satisfied only if this Court has held that the new ruleis retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.

A
As commonly defined, "made" has several alternativemeanings, none of which is entirely free from ambiguity.

See, e. g., Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 718-719 (1991) (defining "to make" as "to cause to happen," "to
cause to exist, occur or appear," "to lay out and construct,"and "to cause to act in a certain way"). Out of context, it
may thus be unclear which meaning should apply in$ 2244(b)(2)(A), and how the term should be understood. We
do not, however, construe the meaning of statutory terms ina vacuum. Rather, we interpret the words "in their context
and with a view to their place in the overall statutoryscheme."

Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U. S.803, 809 (1989). In $ 2244(b)(2)(A), the word "made" falls

within a clause that reads as follows: "[A] new rule of consti533US2 Unit: $U86 [10-19-02 15:45:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN

663Cite as: 533 U. S. 656 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
tutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review
by the Supreme Court." (Emphasis added.) Quite significantly, under this provision, the Supreme Court is the only
entity that can "ma[k]e" a new rule retroactive. The new
rule becomes retroactive, not by the decisions of the lower
court or by the combined action of the Supreme Court and
the lower courts, but simply by the action of the Supreme
Court.

The only way the Supreme Court can, by itself, "lay out
and construct" a rule's retroactive effect, or "cause" that effect "to exist, occur, or appear," is through a holding. The
Supreme Court does not "ma[k]e" a rule retroactive when it
merely establishes principles of retroactivity and leaves the
application of those principles to lower courts. In such an
event, any legal conclusion that is derived from the principles
is developed by the lower court (or perhaps by a combination
of courts), not by the Supreme Court.4 We thus conclude
that a new rule is not "made retroactive to cases on collateral
review" unless the Supreme Court holds it to be retroactive.5

4 Similarly, the Supreme Court does not make a rule retroactive through
dictum, which is not binding. Cf. Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517
U. S. 44, 67 (1996) (contrasting dictum with holdings, which include the
final disposition of a case as well as the preceding determinations "necessary to that result" (emphasis added)).

5 Tyler argues that defining "made" to mean "held" would create an

anomaly: When it is obvious that a rule should be retroactive, the courts
of appeals will not be in conflict, and this Court will never decide to hear
the case and will never make the rule retroactive. Thus, Tyler concludes,
we should construe $ 2244(b)(2)(A) to allow for retroactive application
whenever the "principles" of our decisions, as interpreted by the courts of
appeals, indicate that retroactivity is appropriate. This argument is
flawed, however. First, even if we disagreed with the legislative decision
to establish stringent procedural requirements for retroactive application
of new rules, we do not have license to question the decision on policy
grounds. See Connecticut Nat. Bank v. Germain, 503 U. S. 249, 253-254
(1992). Second, the "anomalous" result that Tyler predicts is speculative
at best, because AEDPA does not limit our discretion to grant certiorari
to cases in which the courts of appeals have reached divergent results.

664 TYLER v. CAIN

Opinion of the Court
To be sure, the statute uses the word "made," not "held."But we have already stated, in a decision interpreting another provision of AEDPA, that Congress need not use theword "held" to require as much. In Williams v. Taylor, 529
U. S. 362 (2000), we concluded that the phrase "clearly estab-lished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of
the United States," $ 2254(d)(1) (emphasis added), "refers tothe holdings, as opposed to the dicta, of this Court's decisions," id., at 412. The provision did not use the word"held," but the effect was the same. Congress, needless to
say, is permitted to use synonyms in a statute. And justas "determined" and "held" are synonyms in the context of

$ 2254(d)(1), "made" and "held" are synonyms in the contextof $ 2244(b)(2)(A).

We further note that our interpretation is necessary forthe proper implementation of the collateral review structure
created by AEDPA. Under the statute, before a state pris-oner may file a second or successive habeas application, he
"shall move in the appropriate court of appeals for an orderauthorizing the district court to consider the application."

$ 2244(b)(3)(A). The court of appeals must make a decisionon the application within 30 days. $ 2244(b)(3)(D). In this
limited time, the court of appeals must determine whetherthe application "makes a prima facie showing that [it] satisfies the [second habeas standard]." $ 2244(b)(3)(C). It isunlikely that a court of appeals could make such a determination in the allotted time if it had to do more than simply relyon Supreme Court holdings on retroactivity. The stringent
time limit thus suggests that the courts of appeals do nothave to engage in the difficult legal analysis that can be
required to determine questions of retroactivity in the firstinstance.

Because "made" means " held" for purposes of$ 2244(b)(2)(A), it is clear that the

Cage rule has not been"made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court." Cage itself does not hold that it is retroac533US2 Unit: $U86 [10-19-02 15:45:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
tive. The only holding in Cage is that the particular juryinstruction violated the Due Process Clause.

Tyler argues, however, that a subsequent case, Sullivanv.

Louisiana, 508 U. S. 275 (1993), made the Cage rule retroactive. But Sullivan held only that a Cage error is struc-tural--

i. e., it is not amenable to harmless-error analysis and
"will always invalidate the conviction." 508 U. S., at 279.
Conceding that the holding in Sullivan does not render Cageretroactive to cases on collateral review, Tyler contends that

the reasoning in Sullivan makes clear that retroactive appli-cation is warranted by the principles of

Teague v. Lane, 489
U. S. 288 (1989). Under Teague, a new rule can be retroac-tive to cases on collateral review if, and only if, it falls within

one of two narrow exceptions to the general rule of nonretro-activity.

Id., at 311-313 (plurality opinion). See also O'Dell
v. Netherland, 521 U. S. 151, 156-157 (1997). The exceptionrelevant here is for "watershed rules of criminal procedure

implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of thecriminal proceeding."

Graham v. Collins, 506 U. S. 461, 478
(1993). To fall within this exception, a new rule must meet
two requirements: Infringement of the rule must "seriouslydiminish the likelihood of obtaining an accurate conviction,"

and the rule must " ` "alter our understanding of the bedrock
procedural elements" ' essential to the fairness of a proceeding." Sawyer v. Smith, 497 U. S. 227, 242 (1990) (quoting
Teague, supra, at 311 (plurality opinion), in turn quoting
Mackey v. United States, 401 U. S. 667, 693 (1971) (Harlan,
J., concurring in judgments in part and dissenting in part)).

According to Tyler, the reasoning of Sullivan demonstrates that the Cage rule satisfies both prongs of this Teague
exception. First, Tyler notes, Sullivan repeatedly emphasized that a Cage error fundamentally undermines the reliability of a trial's outcome. And second, Tyler contends, the
central point of Sullivan is that a Cage error deprives a defendant of a bedrock element of procedural fairness: the right
to have the jury make the determination of guilt beyond a
reasonable doubt. Tyler's arguments fail to persuade, how533US2 Unit: $U86 [10-19-02 15:45:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
ever. The most he can claim is that, based on the principlesoutlined in

Teague, this Court should make Cage retroactive
to cases on collateral review. What is clear, however, is thatwe have not "made"

Cage retroactive to cases on collateral
review.6

Justice Breyer observes that this Court can make a rule
retroactive over the course of two cases. See post, at 672-
673 (dissenting opinion). We do not disagree that, with theright combination of holdings, the Court could do this. But

even so, the Court has not made Cage retroactive. Multiplecases can render a new rule retroactive only if the holdings
in those cases necessarily dictate retroactivity of the newrule. The only holding in

Sullivan is that a Cage error is
structural error. There is no second case that held thatall structural-error rules apply retroactively or that all

structural-error rules fit within the second Teague exception.The standard for determining whether an error is structural,
see generally Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U. S. 279 (1991),
is not coextensive with the second Teague exception,7 and a

6 We also reject Tyler's attempt to find support in our disposition in
Adams v. Evatt, 511 U. S. 1001 (1994). In Adams, we vacated an opinion
of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which had held that Cage
was not retroactive, and remanded for further consideration in light of
Sullivan. Our order, however, was not a "final determination on the merits." Henry v. Rock Hill, 376 U. S. 776, 777 (1964) (per curiam). It simply indicated that, in light of "intervening developments," there was a
"reasonable probability" that the Court of Appeals would reject a legal
premise on which it relied and which may affect the outcome of the litigation. Lawrence v. Chater, 516 U. S. 163, 167 (1996) (per curiam).

7 As explained above, the second Teague exception is available only if

the new rule " ` "alter[s] our understanding of the bedrock procedural
elements" ' essential to the fairness of a proceeding." Sawyer v. Smith,
497 U. S. 227, 242 (1990) (quoting Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288, 311 (1989)
(plurality opinion), in turn quoting Mackey v. United States, 401 U. S. 667,
693 (1971) (Harlan, J., concurring in judgments in part and dissenting in
part) (emphasis added)). Classifying an error as structural does not necessarily alter our understanding of these bedrock procedural elements.
Nor can it be said that all new rules relating to due process (or even

Opinion of the Court
holding that a particular error is structural does not logicallydictate the conclusion that the second Teague exception has

been met. III

Finally, Tyler suggests that, if Cage has not been maderetroactive to cases on collateral review, we should make it
retroactive today. We disagree. Because Tyler's habeasapplication was his second, the District Court was required
to dismiss it unless Tyler showed that this Court already hadmade Cage retroactive. $ 2244(b)(4) ("A district court shall
dismiss any claim presented in a second or successive appli-cation that the court of appeals has authorized to be filed
unless the applicant shows that the claim satisfies the re-quirements of this section"); $ 2244(b)(2)(A) ("A claim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus applicationunder section 2254 that was not presented in a prior application shall be dismissed unless . . . the applicant shows that
the "fundamental requirements of due process," see post, at 674 (dissenting opinion)) alter such understanding. See, e. g., Sawyer, supra, at 244
(holding that the rule in Caldwell v. Mississippi, 472 U. S. 320 (1985), did
not fit within the second Teague exception even though it "added to an
existing guarantee of due process protection against fundamental unfairness"); O'Dell v. Netherland, 521 U. S. 151, 167 (1997) (holding that the
rule in Simmons v. South Carolina, 512 U. S. 154 (1994), which has been
described as serving "one of the hallmarks of due process," id., at 175
(O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment), did not fit within the second
Teague exception). On the contrary, the second Teague exception is reserved only for truly "watershed" rules. See O'Dell, supra, at 167; see
also Caspari v. Bohlen, 510 U. S. 383, 396 (1994) (describing such rules as
"groundbreaking"); Graham v. Collins, 506 U. S. 461, 478 (1993) (explaining that the exception is limited to "a small core of rules," which not
only seriously enhance accuracy but also "requir[e] `observance of those
procedures that . . . are implicit in the concept of ordered liberty' ") (quoting Teague, supra, at 311 (internal quotation marks omitted)); Saffle v.
Parks, 494 U. S. 484, 495 (1990) (focusing on "primacy and centrality" of
the rule). As we have recognized, it is unlikely that any of these watershed rules "ha[s] yet to emerge." Sawyer, supra, at 243 (quoting Teague,

the claim relies on a new rule of constitutional law, maderetroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme

Court, that was previously unavailable"). We cannot decidetoday whether Cage is retroactive to cases on collateral review, because that decision would not help Tyler in this case.Any statement on Cage's retroactivity would be dictum, so
we decline to comment further on the issue.

* * *
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.

It is so ordered.
Justice O'Connor, concurring.
I join the Court's opinion and write separately to explainmore fully the circumstances in which a new rule is "made

retroactive to cases on collateral review by the SupremeCourt." 28 U. S. C. $ 2244(b)(2)(A) (1994 ed., Supp. V).

It is only through the holdings of this Court, as opposedto this Court's dicta and as opposed to the decisions of any
other court, that a new rule is "made retroactive . . . by theSupreme Court" within the meaning of $ 2244(b)(2)(A). See
ante, at 663; cf. Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 412 (2000).The clearest instance, of course, in which we can be said to
have "made" a new rule retroactive is where we expresslyhave held the new rule to be retroactive in a case on collateral review and applied the rule to that case. But, as theCourt recognizes, a single case that expressly holds a rule to
be retroactive is not a sine qua non for the satisfaction ofthis statutory provision. Ante, at 666. This Court instead
may "ma[k]e" a new rule retroactive through multiple hold-ings that logically dictate the retroactivity of the new rule.
Ibid. To apply the syllogistic relationship described by Justice Breyer, post, at 672-673 (dissenting opinion), if wehold in Case One that a particular type of rule applies retroactively to cases on collateral review and hold in Case Two

533US2 Unit: $U86 [10-19-02 15:45:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN

669Cite as: 533 U. S. 656 (2001)
O'Connor, J., concurring
that a given rule is of that particular type, then it necessarilyfollows that the given rule applies retroactively to cases on

collateral review. In such circumstances, we can be said tohave "made" the given rule retroactive to cases on collateral review.The relationship between the conclusion that a new rule is
retroactive and the holdings that "ma[k]e" this rule retroactive, however, must be strictly logical--i. e., the holdingsmust

dictate the conclusion and not merely provide principles from which one may conclude that the rule applies ret-roactively. As the Court observes, "[t]he Supreme Court

does not `ma[k]e' a rule retroactive when it merely establishes principles of retroactivity and leaves the application of
those principles to lower courts." Ante, at 663. The Court
instead can be said to have "made" a rule retroactive within
the meaning of $ 2244(b)(2)(A) only where the Court's holdings logically permit no other conclusion than that the rule
is retroactive.

It is relatively easy to demonstrate the required logical
relationship with respect to the first exception articulated in
Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989). Under this exception,
"a new rule should be applied retroactively if it places `certain kinds of primary, private individual conduct beyond the
power of the criminal law-making authority to proscribe.' "
Id., at 307 (plurality opinion) (quoting Mackey v. United
States, 401 U. S. 667, 692 (1971) (Harlan, J., concurring in
judgments in part and dissenting in part)). When the Court
holds as a new rule in a subsequent case that a particular
species of primary, private individual conduct is beyond the
power of the criminal lawmaking authority to proscribe, it
necessarily follows that this Court has "made" that new rule
retroactive to cases on collateral review. The Court has
done so through its holdings alone, without resort to dicta
and without any application of principles by lower courts.

The matter is less straightforward with respect to the second Teague exception, which is reserved for "watershed

rules of criminal procedure," 489 U. S., at 311 (plurality opinion). A case announcing a new rule could conceivably hold
that infringement of the rule "seriously diminish[es] the likelihood of obtaining an accurate conviction," id., at 315, and
that the rule " `alter[s] our understanding of the bedrock procedural elements essential to the fairness of a proceeding,' "
id., at 311 (plurality opinion) (quoting Mackey, supra, at 693
(Harlan, J., concurring in judgments in part and dissenting
in part)); see also Sawyer v. Smith, 497 U. S. 227, 242 (1990),
without holding in so many words that the rule "applies retroactively" and without actually applying that rule retroactively to a case on collateral review. The "precise contours"
of this Teague exception, of course, "may be difficult to discern," Saffle v. Parks, 494 U. S. 484, 495 (1990), and the judgment involved in our "ma[king]" a new rule retroactive
under this exception is likely to be more subjective and selfconscious than is the case with Teague's first exception. But
the relevant inquiry is not whether the new rule comes
within the Teague exception at all, but the more narrow and
manageable inquiry of whether this Court's holdings, by
strict logical necessity, "ma[k]e" the new rule retroactive
within the meaning of $ 2244(b)(2)(A). While such logical
necessity does not obtain in this particular case, ante, at 665-
667, this Court could "ma[k]e" a new rule retroactive under
Teague's second exception in this manner.

Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice
Souter, and Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.

In Cage v. Louisiana, 498 U. S. 39 (1990) (per curiam),
this Court held that a certain jury instruction violated the
Constitution because it inaccurately defined "reasonable
doubt," thereby permitting a jury to convict "based on a
degree of proof below that required by the Due Process
Clause." Id., at 41. Here we must decide whether this
Court has "made" Cage "retroactive to cases on collateral

Breyer, J., dissenting
review." 28 U. S. C. $ 2244(b)(2)(A) (1994 ed., Supp. V). Ibelieve that it has.

The Court made Cage retroactive in two cases taken to-gether. Case One is

Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989).
That case, as the majority says, held (among other things)that a new rule is applicable retroactively to cases on collateral review if (1) infringement of the new rule will "seriously
diminish the likelihood of obtaining an accurate conviction,"
id., at 315 (plurality opinion), and (2) the new rule " `alter[s]
our understanding of the bedrock procedural elements thatmust be found to vitiate the fairness of a particular conviction,' " id., at 311 (plurality opinion) (quoting Mackey v.
United States, 401 U. S. 667, 693 (1971) (Harlan, J., concurring in judgments in part and dissenting in part)) (emphasis deleted).

Case Two is Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508 U. S. 275 (1993).
This Court decided Sullivan after several lower courts had
held that Cage's rule did not fall within the Teague "watershed" exception I have just mentioned. See, e. g., Adams v.
Aiken, 965 F. 2d 1306, 1312 (CA4 1992), vacated, 511 U. S.
1001 (1994); Skelton v. Whitley, 950 F. 2d 1037, 1045 (CA5),
cert. denied, 506 U. S. 833 (1992). The question in Sullivan
was whether a violation of the Cage rule could ever count as
harmless error. The Court answered that question in the
negative. In so concluding, the Court reasoned that an instruction that violated Cage by misdescribing the concept of
reasonable doubt "vitiates all the jury's findings," and deprives a criminal defendant of a "basic protection . . . without
which a criminal trial cannot reliably serve its function."
Sullivan, supra, at 281 (emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted). It renders the situation as if "there
has been no jury verdict within the meaning of the Sixth
Amendment." 508 U. S., at 280.

To reason as the Court reasoned in Sullivan is to hold
(in Teague's language) (1) that infringement of the Cage rule
"seriously diminish[es] the likelihood of obtaining an accurate

conviction," Teague, supra, at 315 (plurality opinion), and(2) that

Cage "alter[s] our understanding of the bedrock
procedural elements" that are essential to the fairness of acriminal trial, 489 U. S., at 311 (plurality opinion) (internal

quotation marks omitted; emphasis deleted). That is be-cause an instruction that makes "

all the jury's findings"
untrustworthy, Sullivan, supra, at 281, must "diminish
the likelihood of obtaining an accurate conviction," Teague,
supra, at 315 (plurality opinion). It is because a deprivation
of a "basic protection" needed for a trial to "serve its func-tion,"

Sullivan, supra, at 281 (internal quotation marks
omitted), is a deprivation of a "bedrock procedural elemen[t]," Teague, supra, at 311 (plurality opinion) (internal
quotation marks omitted). And it is because Cage significantly "alter[ed]" pre-existing law. 489 U. S., at 311. That
is what every Court of Appeals to have considered the matter has concluded. See Tillman v. Cook, 215 F. 3d 1116,
1122 (CA10), cert. denied, 531 U. S. 1055 (2000); West v.
Vaughn, 204 F. 3d 53, 61, and n. 9 (CA3 2000); Gaines v. Kelly,
202 F. 3d 598, 604-605 (CA2 2000); Humphrey v. Cain, 138
F. 3d 552, 553 (CA5) (en banc), cert. denied, 525 U. S. 935
(1998); Adams v. Aiken, 41 F. 3d 175, 178-179 (CA4 1994),
cert. denied, 515 U. S. 1124 (1995); Nutter v. White, 39 F. 3d
1154, 1158 (CA11 1994). But cf. In re Smith, 142 F. 3d 832,
835-836 (CA5 1998) (concluding that explicit Supreme Court
statement is necessary to make Cage retroactive for second
or successive habeas purposes); Rodriguez v. Superintendent, Bay State Correctional Ctr., 139 F. 3d 270, 275-276 (CA1
1998) (same); In re Hill, 113 F. 3d 181, 184 (CA11 1997)
(same). And I do not see how the majority can deny that
this is so.

Consequently, Sullivan, in holding that a Cage violation
can never be harmless because it leaves the defendant with
no jury verdict known to the Sixth Amendment, also holds
that Cage falls within Teague's "watershed" exception. The
matter is one of logic. If Case One holds that all men are

533US2 Unit: $U86 [10-19-02 15:45:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Breyer, J., dissenting
mortal and Case Two holds that Socrates is a man, we do notneed Case Three to hold that Socrates is mortal. It is also a

matter of law. If Case One holds that a party's expectationmeasures damages for breach of contract and Case Two holds
that Circumstances X, Y, and Z create a binding contract,we do not need Case Three to hold that in those same circumstances expectation damages are awarded for breach. Ordinarily, in law, to hold that a set of circumstances falls withina particular legal category is simultaneously to hold that,

other things being equal, the normal legal characteristics ofmembers of that category apply to those circumstances.

The majority says that Sullivan's only "holding" is that
Cage error is structural, and that this "holding" does not
dictate the "watershed" nature of the Cage rule. See ante,
at 665-666. But the majority fails to identify a meaningful
difference between the definition of a watershed rule under
Teague and the standard that we have articulated in the
handful of instances in which we have held errors structural,
namely, that structural errors deprive a defendant of a
" `basic protectio[n]' " without which a " `trial cannot reliably
serve its function as a vehicle for determination of guilt or
innocence' " to the point where " `no criminal punishment
may be regarded as fundamentally fair.' " Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U. S. 279, 310 (1991) (quoting Rose v. Clark, 478
U. S. 570, 577-578 (1986)); see also Neder v. United States,
527 U. S. 1, 8 (1999) (identifying the six kinds of error, including Cage error, that have been held structural). In principle
Teague also adds an element that "structural error" alone
need not encompass, namely, the requirement that a violation
of the rule must undermine accuracy. But that additional
accuracy requirement poses no problem here, for our language in Sullivan could not have made clearer that Cage
error seriously undermines the accuracy and reliability of a
guilty verdict.

Of course, as the majority points out, identifying an error
as structural need not "alter our understanding of th[e] fun533US2 Unit: $U86 [10-19-02 15:45:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN
674 TYLER v. CAIN

Breyer, J., dissenting
damental procedural elements" that are essential to a fairtrial. See

ante, at 666, n. 7. But this "altering" requirement is not a problem here. No one denies that Cage's rulewas a new one. "Whether a trial court's unconstitutional

misdescription of the burden of proof in a criminal caseviolates the Due Process Clause was certainly an open
question before Cage." Adams, 41 F. 3d, at 178; see also
Gaines, supra, at 606-607 (noting that Cage led to reversalsof numerous convictions that had been based on similar

reasonable-doubt instruction); State v. Humphrey, 544 So. 2d1188, 1192 (La. App.) (citing multiple decisions by Louisiana
Supreme Court which had upheld reasonable-doubt instruc-tions like that invalidated in

Cage), cert. denied, 550 So. 2d
627 (1989). And our holding that such a misdescription ofthe burden of proof means that "there has been no jury verdict within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment," Sullivan,508 U. S., at 280, certainly altered the understanding of the
significance of such an error.Insofar as the majority means to suggest that a rule may
be sufficiently "new" that it does not apply retroactively but
not "new enough" to qualify for the watershed exception,I note only that the cases establishing this exception suggest

no such requirement. Rather than focus on the "degree of
newness" of a new rule, these decisions emphasize that
watershed rules are those that form part of the fundamental requirements of due process. See Teague, 489 U. S., at
311-312 (plurality opinion); Mackey, 401 U. S., at 693-694
(Harlan, J., concurring in judgments in part and dissenting
in part); cf. O'Dell v. Netherland, 521 U. S. 151, 167 (1997)
(holding that "narrow right of rebuttal" established by Simmons v. South Carolina, 512 U. S. 154 (1994), "has hardly

accuracy); Sawyer v. Smith, 497 U. S. 227, 242-244 (1990)(holding that rule which "provid[ed] an additional measure

of protection" to existing prohibition on prosecutorial re-marks that render a proceeding "fundamentally unfair" was
not "an `absolute prerequisite to fundamental fairness' " thatwould fall within the second

Teague exception) (quoting
Teague, supra, at 314 (plurality opinion)).

Nor does the majority explain why the reasoning that wasnecessary to our holding in

Sullivan (and is therefore binding upon all courts) lacks enough legal force to "make" the
Cage rule retroactive. Cf. Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44, 67 (1996) ("We adhere . . . not to mere obiter
dicta, but rather to the well-established rationale upon which
the Court based the results of its earlier decisions. Whenan opinion issues for the Court, it is not only the result but

also those portions of the opinion necessary to that result bywhich we are bound");

Burnham v. Superior Court of Cal.,
County of Marin, 495 U. S. 604, 613, n. 2 (1990) (pluralityopinion) (exclusive basis for judgment is not dicta). In any

event, technical issues about what constitutes a "holding"
are beside the point. The statutory provision before us doesnot use the words "holding" or "held." But cf.

ante, at 664
(majority opinion) (stating without explanation that "made"
means "held"). It uses the word "made." It refers to instances in which the Supreme Court has "made" a rule of
law "retroactive to cases on collateral review." 28 U. S. C.

$ 2244(b)(2)(A) (1994 ed., Supp. V) (emphasis added). And
that is just what the Supreme Court, through Teague and
Sullivan, has done with respect to the rule of Cage.

I agree with Justice O'Connor--as does a majority of
the Court--when (in describing a different Teague exception) she says that "[w]hen the Court holds as a new rule in a
subsequent case that a particular species of primary, private
individual conduct is beyond the power of the criminal lawmaking authority to proscribe, it necessarily follows that this
Court has `made' that new rule retroactive to cases on collateral review." Ante, at 669 (concurring opinion). But I do

Breyer, J., dissenting
not understand why a decision by this Court which makesit apparent that a rule is retroactive under

Teague's second
exception will necessarily be "more subjective and self-conscious."

Ante, at 670 (concurring opinion). Of course, it
will sometimes be difficult to decide whether an earlier Su-preme Court case has satisfied the watershed rule's requirements. But that is not so here. In Sullivan, this Court
used language that unmistakably stated that a defectivereasonable-doubt instruction undermines the accuracy of a

trial and deprives the defendant of a bedrock element thatis essential to the fairness of a criminal proceeding. That is
sufficient to make Teague's watershed exception applicable.

I would add two further points. First, nothing in the
statute's purpose favors, let alone requires, the majority's
conclusion. That purpose, as far as I can surmise, is to bar
successive petitions when lower courts, but not the Supreme
Court, have held a rule not to be "new" under Teague because dictated by their own precedent, cf. Dyer v. Calderon,
151 F. 3d 970, 993-995 (CA9) (en banc) (O'Scannlain, J., dissenting) (rejecting proposition that lower court decisions can
establish rule for Teague purposes), cert. denied, 525 U. S.
1033 (1998); Clemmons v. Delo, 124 F. 3d 944, 955, n. 11 (CA8
1997) (assuming, without deciding, that only Supreme Court
precedent may dictate rule so that it is not new for Teague
purposes), cert. denied, 523 U. S. 1088 (1998), or when lower
courts have themselves adopted new rules and then determined that the Teague retroactivity factors apply, see Smith

Breyer, J., dissenting
Second, the most likely consequence of the majority's hold-ing is further procedural complexity. After today's opinion,

the only way in which this Court can make a rule such asCage's retroactive is to repeat its Sullivan reasoning in a
case triggered by a prisoner's filing a first habeas petition(a "second or successive" petition itself being barred by the
provision here at issue) or in some other case that presentsthe issue in a posture that allows such language to have the
status of a "holding." Then, after the Court takes the caseand says that it meant what it previously said, prisoners
could file "second or successive" petitions to take advantageof the now-clearly-made-applicable new rule. We will be required to restate the obvious, case by case, even when wehave explicitly said, but not "held," that a new rule is retroactive. See, e. g., Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302, 330(1989) (stating that, if Court were to hold that Eighth
Amendment prohibits execution of persons with mentalretardation, this rule would be retroactively applicable on
collateral review).Even this complex route will remain open only if the relevant statute of limitations is interpreted to permit its 1-yearfiling period to run from the time that this Court has "made"
a new rule retroactive, not from the time it initially recog-nized that new right. See 28 U. S. C. $ 2244(d)(1)(C) (1994
ed., Supp. V) (limitations period runs from "the date onwhich the constitutional right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court, if the right has been newlyrecognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively
applicable to cases on collateral review"). Otherwise, theCourt's approach will generate not only complexity, along
with its attendant risk of confusion, but also serious addi-tional unfairness.

I do not understand the basis for the Court's approach.I fear its consequences. For these reasons, with respect,
I dissent.

ZADVYDAS v. DAVIS et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 99-7791. Argued February 21, 2001--Decided June 28, 2001*
After a final removal order is entered, an alien ordered removed is held

in custody during a 90-day removal period. If the alien is not removed
in those 90 days, the post-removal-period detention statute authorizes
further detention or supervised release, subject to administrative review. Kestutis Zadvydas, petitioner in No. 99-7791--a resident alien
born, apparently of Lithuanian parents, in a German displaced persons
camp--was ordered deported based on his criminal record. Germany
and Lithuania refused to accept him because he was not a citizen of
their countries; efforts to send him to his wife's native country also
failed. When he remained in custody after the removal period expired,
he filed a habeas action under 28 U. S. C. $ 2241. The District Court
granted the writ, reasoning that, because the Government would never
remove him, his confinement would be permanent, in violation of the
Constitution. In reversing, the Fifth Circuit concluded that Zadvydas'
detention did not violate the Constitution because eventual deportation
was not impossible, good-faith efforts to remove him continued, and his
detention was subject to administrative review. Kim Ho Ma, respondent in No. 00-38, is a resident alien born in Cambodia who was ordered
removed based on his aggravated felony conviction. When he remained
in custody after the removal period expired, he filed a $ 2241 habeas
petition. In ordering his release, the District Court held that the Constitution forbids post-removal-period detention unless there is a realistic
chance that an alien will be removed, and that no such chance existed
here because Cambodia has no repatriation treaty with the United
States. The Ninth Circuit affirmed, concluding that detention was not
authorized for more than a reasonable time beyond the 90-day period,
and that, given the lack of a repatriation agreement, that time had
expired.

Held:

basic method for obtaining review of continued custody after a deportation order becomes final, and none of the statutory provisions limiting
judicial review of removal decisions applies here. Pp. 687-688.

2. The post-removal-period detention statute, read in light of the Constitution's demands, implicitly limits an alien's detention to a period reasonably necessary to bring about that alien's removal from the United
States, and does not permit indefinite detention. Pp. 688-699.

(a) A statute permitting indefinite detention would raise serious
constitutional questions. Freedom from imprisonment lies at the heart
of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause. Government detention violates the Clause unless it is ordered in a criminal proceeding
with adequate procedural safeguards or a special justification outweighs
the individual's liberty interest. The instant proceedings are civil and
assumed to be nonpunitive, and the Government proffers no sufficiently
strong justification for indefinite civil detention under this statute. The
first justification--preventing flight--is weak or nonexistent where removal seems a remote possibility. Preventive detention based on the
second justification--protecting the community--has been upheld only
when limited to specially dangerous individuals and subject to strong
procedural protections. When preventive detention is potentially indefinite, this dangerousness rationale must also be accompanied by some
other special circumstance, such as mental illness, that helps to create
the danger. The civil confinement here is potentially permanent, and
once the flight risk justification evaporates, the only special circumstance is the alien's removable status, which bears no relation to dangerousness. Moreover, the sole procedural protections here are found in
administrative proceedings, where the alien bears the burden of proving
he is not dangerous, without (according to the Government) significant
later judicial review. The Constitution may well preclude granting an
administrative body unreviewable authority to make determinations implicating fundamental rights. Pp. 690-692.

(b) Shaughnessy v. United States ex rel. Mezei, 345 U. S. 206--in
which an alien was indefinitely detained as he attempted to reenter the
country--does not support the Government's argument that alien status
itself can justify indefinite detention. Once an alien enters the country,
the legal circumstance changes, for the Due Process Clause applies to
all persons within the United States, including aliens, whether their
presence is lawful, unlawful, temporary, or permanent. Nor do cases
holding that, because Congress has plenary power to create immigration
law, the Judicial Branch must defer to Executive and Legislative Branch
decisionmaking in that area help the Government, because that power
is subject to constitutional limits. Finally, the aliens' liberty interest is
not diminished by their lack of a legal right to live at large, for the
choice at issue here is between imprisonment and supervision under

Syllabus
release conditions that may not be violated and their liberty interest is
strong enough to raise a serious constitutional problem with indefinite
detention. Pp. 692-696.

(c) Despite the constitutional problem here, if this Court were to
find a clear congressional intent to grant the Attorney General the
power to indefinitely detain an alien ordered removed, the Court would
be required to give it effect. But this Court finds no clear indication
of such intent. The statute's use of "may" is ambiguous and does not
necessarily suggest unlimited discretion. Similar related statutes requiring detention of criminal aliens during removal proceedings and the
removal period do not show that Congress authorized indefinite detention here. Finally, nothing in the statute's legislative history clearly
demonstrates a congressional intent to authorize indefinite, perhaps permanent, detention. Pp. 696-699.

3. The application of the "reasonable time" limitation is subject to
federal-court review. The basic federal habeas statute grants the federal courts authority to determine whether post-removal-period detention is pursuant to statutory authority. In answering that question,
the court must ask whether the detention exceeds a period reasonably
necessary to secure removal. It should measure reasonableness primarily in terms of the statute's purpose of assuring the alien's presence
at the moment of removal. Thus, if removal is not reasonably foreseeable, the court should hold continued detention unreasonable and no
longer authorized. If it is foreseeable, the court should consider the
risk of the alien's committing further crimes as a factor potentially justifying continued confinement. Without abdicating their responsibility
to review the detention's lawfulness, the courts can take appropriate
account of such matters as the Executive Branch's greater immigrationrelated expertise, the Immigration and Naturalization Service's administrative needs and concerns, and the Nation's need to speak with one
voice on immigration. In order to limit the occasions when courts will
need to make the difficult judgments called for by the recognition of
this necessary Executive leeway, it is practically necessary to recognize
a presumptively reasonable period of detention. It is unlikely that Congress believed that all reasonably foreseeable removals could be accomplished in 90 days, but there is reason to believe that it doubted the
constitutionality of more than six months' detention. Thus, for the sake
of uniform administration in the federal courts, six months is the appropriate period. After the 6-month period, once an alien provides good
reason to believe that there is no significant likelihood of removal in the
reasonably foreseeable future, the Government must furnish evidence
sufficient to rebut that showing. Pp. 699-701.

4. The standard that the Fifth Circuit applied in holding Zadvydas'
continued detention lawful seems to require an alien seeking release to
show the absence of any prospect of removal--no matter how unlikely
or unforeseeable--and thus demands more than the statute can bear.
The Ninth Circuit's conclusion that Ma should be released may have
rested solely upon the absence of a repatriation agreement without
giving due weight to the likelihood of successful future negotiations.

682 ZADVYDAS v. DAVIS

Opinion of the Court
Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.
When an alien has been found to be unlawfully present
in the United States and a final order of removal has been
entered, the Government ordinarily secures the alien's
removal during a subsequent 90-day statutory "removal
period," during which time the alien normally is held in
custody.

A special statute authorizes further detention if the Government fails to remove the alien during those 90 days. It
says:

"An alien ordered removed [1] who is inadmissible . . .
[2] [or] removable [as a result of violations of status requirements or entry conditions, violations of criminal
law, or reasons of security or foreign policy] or [3] who
has been determined by the Attorney General to be a
risk to the community or unlikely to comply with the
order of removal, may be detained beyond the removal
period and, if released, shall be subject to [certain] terms
of supervision . . . ." 8 U. S. C. $ 1231(a)(6) (1994 ed.,
Supp. V).

In these cases, we must decide whether this postremoval-period statute authorizes the Attorney General to
detain a removable alien indefinitely beyond the removal
period or only for a period reasonably necessary to secure
the alien's removal. We deal here with aliens who were
admitted to the United States but subsequently ordered
removed. Aliens who have not yet gained initial admission
to this country would present a very different question.
See infra, at 693-694. Based on our conclusion that indefinite detention of aliens in the former category would raise
serious constitutional concerns, we construe the statute to
contain an implicit "reasonable time" limitation, the application of which is subject to federal-court review.

Opinion of the Court

I
A

The post-removal-period detention statute is one of a related set of statutes and regulations that govern detention
during and after removal proceedings. While removal proceedings are in progress, most aliens may be released on
bond or paroled. 66 Stat. 204, as added and amended, 110
Stat. 3009-585, 8 U. S. C. $$ 1226(a)(2), (c) (1994 ed., Supp. V).
After entry of a final removal order and during the 90-day
removal period, however, aliens must be held in custody.

$ 1231(a)(2). Subsequently, as the post-removal-period statute provides, the Government "may" continue to detain an
alien who still remains here or release that alien under supervision. $ 1231(a)(6).

Related Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)
regulations add that the INS District Director will initially
review the alien's records to decide whether further detention or release under supervision is warranted after the
90-day removal period expires. 8 CFR $$ 241.4(c)(1), (h),
(k)(1)(i) (2001). If the decision is to detain, then an INS
panel will review the matter further, at the expiration of a
3-month period or soon thereafter. $ 241.4(k)(2)(ii). And
the panel will decide, on the basis of records and a possible
personal interview, between still further detention or release
under supervision. $ 241.4(i). In making this decision, the
panel will consider, for example, the alien's disciplinary record, criminal record, mental health reports, evidence of rehabilitation, history of flight, prior immigration history, and favorable factors such as family ties. $ 241.4(f ). To authorize
release, the panel must find that the alien is not likely to be
violent, to pose a threat to the community, to flee if released,
or to violate the conditions of release. $ 241.4(e). And the
alien must demonstrate "to the satisfaction of the Attorney General" that he will pose no danger or risk of flight.

We consider two separate instances of detention. Thefirst concerns Kestutis Zadvydas, a resident alien who was

born, apparently of Lithuanian parents, in a displaced per-sons camp in Germany in 1948. When he was eight years
old, Zadvydas immigrated to the United States with his par-ents and other family members, and he has lived here ever
since.Zadvydas has a long criminal record, involving drug
crimes, attempted robbery, attempted burglary, and theft.He has a history of flight, from both criminal and deportation
proceedings. Most recently, he was convicted of possessing,with intent to distribute, cocaine; sentenced to 16 years' imprisonment; released on parole after two years; taken intoINS custody; and, in 1994, ordered deported to Germany.
See 8 U. S. C. $ 1251(a)(2) (1988 ed., Supp. V) (delineatingcrimes that make alien deportable).

In 1994, Germany told the INS that it would not acceptZadvydas because he was not a German citizen. Shortly
thereafter, Lithuania refused to accept Zadvydas because hewas neither a Lithuanian citizen nor a permanent resident.
In 1996, the INS asked the Dominican Republic (Zadvydas'wife's country) to accept him, but this effort proved unsuccessful. In 1998, Lithuania rejected, as inadequately docu-mented, Zadvydas' effort to obtain Lithuanian citizenship
based on his parents' citizenship; Zadvydas' reapplication isapparently still pending.

The INS kept Zadvydas in custody after expiration of theremoval period. In September 1995, Zadvydas filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U. S. C. $ 2241 chal533US2 Unit: $U87 [10-21-02 18:35:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN

685Cite as: 533 U. S. 678 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
lenging his continued detention. In October 1997, a FederalDistrict Court granted that writ and ordered him released

under supervision. Zadvydas v. Caplinger, 986 F. Supp.1011, 1027-1028 (ED La.). In its view, the Government
would never succeed in its efforts to remove Zadvydas fromthe United States, leading to his permanent confinement,
contrary to the Constitution. Id., at 1027.The Fifth Circuit reversed this decision.

Zadvydas v.Underdown, 185 F. 3d 279 (1999). It concluded that

Zadvydas' detention did not violate the Constitution becauseeventual deportation was not "impossible," good-faith efforts
to remove him from the United States continued, and hisdetention was subject to periodic administrative review.
Id., at 294, 297. The Fifth Circuit stayed its mandate pend-ing potential review in this Court.

2
The second case is that of Kim Ho Ma. Ma was born inCambodia in 1977. When he was two, his family fled, taking

him to refugee camps in Thailand and the Philippines andeventually to the United States, where he has lived as a resident alien since the age of seven. In 1995, at age 17, Mawas involved in a gang-related shooting, convicted of manslaughter, and sentenced to 38 months' imprisonment. Heserved two years, after which he was released into INS
custody.In light of his conviction of an "aggravated felony,"
Ma was ordered removed. See 8 U. S. C. $$ 1101(a)(43)(F)(defining certain violent crimes as aggravated felonies),
1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (1994 ed., Supp. IV) (aliens convicted of ag-gravated felonies are deportable). The 90-day removal period expired in early 1999, but the INS continued to keep
Ma in custody, because, in light of his former gang member-ship, the nature of his crime, and his planned participation

in a prison hunger strike, it was "unable to conclude that

Opinion of the Court
Mr. Ma would remain nonviolent and not violate the condi-tions of release." App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 00-38, p. 87a.

In 1999, Ma filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpusunder 28 U. S. C. $ 2241. A panel of five judges in the Federal District Court for the Western District of Washington,considering Ma's and about 100 similar cases together, issued
a joint order holding that the Constitution forbids post-removal-period detention unless there is "a realistic chance
that [the] alien will be deported" (thereby permitting classi-fication of the detention as "in aid of deportation").

BinhPhan v. Reno, 56 F. Supp. 2d 1149, 1156 (1999). The District

Court then held an evidentiary hearing, decided that therewas no "realistic chance" that Cambodia (which has no repatriation treaty with the United States) would accept Ma, andordered Ma released. App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 00-38,
at 60a-61a.The Ninth Circuit affirmed Ma's release. Kim Ho Ma v.
Reno, 208 F. 3d 815 (2000). It concluded, based in part onconstitutional concerns, that the statute did not authorize
detention for more than a "reasonable time" beyond the90-day period authorized for removal.

Id., at 818. And,given the lack of a repatriation agreement with Cambodia,

that time had expired upon passage of the 90 days. Id., at830-831.

Zadvydas asked us to review the decision of the Fifth Circuit authorizing his continued detention. The Governmentasked us to review the decision of the Ninth Circuit forbidding Ma's continued detention. We granted writs in bothcases, agreeing to consider both statutory and related constitutional questions. See also Duy Dac Ho v. Greene, 204F. 3d 1045, 1060 (CA10 2000) (upholding Attorney General's
statutory and constitutional authority to detain alien indefi-nitely). We consolidated the two cases for argument; and
we now decide them together.

Opinion of the Court

II
We note at the outset that the primary federal habeas cor-pus statute, 28 U. S. C. $ 2241, confers jurisdiction upon

the federal courts to hear these cases. See $ 2241(c)(3)(authorizing any person to claim in federal court that he
or she is being held "in custody in violation of the Con-stitution or laws . . . of the United States"). Before 1952,
the federal courts considered challenges to the lawfulnessof immigration-related detention, including challenges to
the validity of a deportation order, in habeas proceedings.See

Heikkila v. Barber, 345 U. S. 229, 230, 235-236 (1953).Beginning in 1952, an alternative method for review of

de-portation orders, namely, actions brought in federal district

court under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), be-came available. See Shaughnessy v. Pedreiro, 349 U. S. 48,
51-52 (1955). And in 1961 Congress replaced district courtAPA review with initial deportation order review in courts
of appeals. See Act of Sept. 26, 1961, $ 5, 75 Stat. 651 (for-merly codified at 8 U. S. C. $ 1105a(a)) (repealed 1996). The
1961 Act specified that federal habeas courts were also avail-able to hear statutory and constitutional challenges to deportation (and exclusion) orders. See 8 U. S. C. $$ 1105a(a)(10),(b) (repealed 1996). These statutory changes left habeas untouched as the basic method for obtaining review of contin-ued

custody after a deportation order had become final. SeeCheng Fan Kwok v. INS, 392 U. S. 206, 212, 215-216 (1968)

(holding that $ 1105a(a) applied only to challenges to determi-nations made during deportation proceedings and motions to
reopen those proceedings).More recently, Congress has enacted several statutory
provisions that limit the circumstances in which judicial re-view of deportation decisions is available. But none applies
here. One provision, 8 U. S. C. $ 1231(h) (1994 ed., Supp. V),simply forbids courts to construe

that section "to create
any . . . procedural right or benefit that is legally enforce533US2 Unit: $U87 [10-21-02 18:35:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN
688 ZADVYDAS v. DAVIS

Opinion of the Court
able"; it does not deprive an alien of the right to rely on 28U. S. C. $ 2241 to challenge detention that is without statutory authority.Another provision, 8 U. S. C. $ 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) (1994 ed.,
Supp. V), says that "no court shall have jurisdiction to re-view" decisions "specified . . . to be in the discretion of the
Attorney General." The aliens here, however, do not seekreview of the Attorney General's exercise of discretion;
rather, they challenge the extent of the Attorney General'sauthority under the post-removal-period detention statute.
And the extent of that authority is not a matter of discretion.See also,

e. g., $ 1226(e) (applicable to certain detention-related decisions in period preceding entry of final removal

order); $ 1231(a)(4)(D) (applicable to assertion of causes orclaims under $ 1231(a)(4), which is not at issue here);

$$ 1252(a)(1), (a)(2)(C) (applicable to judicial review of "finalorder[s] of removal"); $ 1252(g) (applicable to decisions "to
commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute re-moval orders").

We conclude that $ 2241 habeas corpus proceedings remainavailable as a forum for statutory and constitutional challenges to post-removal-period detention. And we turn tothe merits of the aliens' claims.

III
The post-removal-period detention statute applies to cer-tain categories of aliens who have been ordered removed,

namely, inadmissible aliens, criminal aliens, aliens who haveviolated their nonimmigrant status conditions, and aliens removable for certain national security or foreign relationsreasons, as well as any alien "who has been determined by
the Attorney General to be a risk to the community or
unlikely to comply with the order of removal." 8 U. S. C.$ 1231(a)(6) (1994 ed., Supp. V); see also 8 CFR $ 241.4(a)

(2001). It says that an alien who falls into one of these cate533US2 Unit: $U87 [10-21-02 18:35:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN

689Cite as: 533 U. S. 678 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
gories "may be detained beyond the removal period and, if
released, shall be subject to [certain] terms of supervision."
8 U. S. C. $ 1231(a)(6) (1994 ed., Supp. V).

The Government argues that the statute means what it
literally says. It sets no "limit on the length of time beyond
the removal period that an alien who falls within one of the
Section 1231(a)(6) categories may be detained." Brief for
Petitioners in No. 00-38, p. 22. Hence, "whether to continue
to detain such an alien and, if so, in what circumstances and
for how long" is up to the Attorney General, not up to the
courts. Ibid.

"[I]t is a cardinal principle" of statutory interpretation,
however, that when an Act of Congress raises "a serious
doubt" as to its constitutionality, "this Court will first ascertain whether a construction of the statute is fairly possible
by which the question may be avoided." Crowell v. Benson,
285 U. S. 22, 62 (1932); see also United States v. X-Citement
Video, Inc., 513 U. S. 64, 78 (1994); United States v. Jin Fuey
Moy, 241 U. S. 394, 401 (1916); cf. Almendarez-Torres v.
United States, 523 U. S. 224, 238 (1998) (construction of statute that avoids invalidation best reflects congressional will).
We have read significant limitations into other immigration
statutes in order to avoid their constitutional invalidation.
See United States v. Witkovich, 353 U. S. 194, 195, 202 (1957)
(construing a grant of authority to the Attorney General to
ask aliens whatever questions he "deem[s] fit and proper"
as limited to questions "reasonably calculated to keep the
Attorney General advised regarding the continued availability for departure of aliens whose deportation is overdue").
For similar reasons, we read an implicit limitation into the
statute before us. In our view, the statute, read in light of
the Constitution's demands, limits an alien's post-removalperiod detention to a period reasonably necessary to bring

Opinion of the Court

A
A statute permitting indefinite detention of an alien wouldraise a serious constitutional problem. The Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause forbids the Government to "de-priv[e]" any "person . . . of . . . liberty . . . without due process
of law." Freedom from imprisonment--from governmentcustody, detention, or other forms of physical restraint--lies
at the heart of the liberty that Clause protects. See Fouchav.

Louisiana, 504 U. S. 71, 80 (1992). And this Court hassaid that government detention violates that Clause unless

the detention is ordered in a criminal proceeding with ade-quate procedural protections, see

United States v. Salerno,481 U. S. 739, 746 (1987), or, in certain special and "narrow"

nonpunitive "circumstances," Foucha, supra, at 80, where aspecial justification, such as harm-threatening mental illness,
outweighs the "individual's constitutionally protected inter-est in avoiding physical restraint." Kansas v. Hendricks,
521 U. S. 346, 356 (1997).The proceedings at issue here are civil, not criminal, and
we assume that they are nonpunitive in purpose and effect.There is no sufficiently strong special justification here for
indefinite civil detention--at least as administered under thisstatute. The statute, says the Government, has two regulatory goals: "ensuring the appearance of aliens at future im-migration proceedings" and "[p]reventing danger to the community." Brief for Respondents in No. 99-7791, p. 24. But
by definition the first justification--preventing flight--isweak or nonexistent where removal seems a remote possibility at best. As this Court said in Jackson v. Indiana, 406U. S. 715 (1972), where detention's goal is no longer practically attainable, detention no longer "bear[s] [a] reasonablerelation to the purpose for which the individual [was] committed." Id., at 738.The second justification--protecting the community--does
not necessarily diminish in force over time. But we have

Opinion of the Court
upheld preventive detention based on dangerousness only
when limited to specially dangerous individuals and subject
to strong procedural protections. Compare Hendricks,
supra, at 368 (upholding scheme that imposes detention upon
"a small segment of particularly dangerous individuals" and
provides "strict procedural safeguards"), and Salerno, supra,
at 747, 750-752 (in upholding pretrial detention, stressing
"stringent time limitations," the fact that detention is reserved for the "most serious of crimes," the requirement of
proof of dangerousness by clear and convincing evidence, and
the presence of judicial safeguards), with Foucha, supra, at
81-83 (striking down insanity-related detention system that
placed burden on detainee to prove nondangerousness). In
cases in which preventive detention is of potentially indefinite duration, we have also demanded that the dangerousness rationale be accompanied by some other special circumstance, such as mental illness, that helps to create the
danger. See Hendricks, supra, at 358, 368.

The civil confinement here at issue is not limited, but potentially permanent. Cf. Salerno, supra, at 747 (noting that
"maximum length of pretrial detention is limited" by "stringent" requirements); Carlson v. Landon, 342 U. S. 524, 545-
546 (1952) (upholding temporary detention of alien during
deportation proceeding while noting that "problem of . . .
unusual delay" was not present). The provision authorizing
detention does not apply narrowly to "a small segment of
particularly dangerous individuals," Hendricks, supra, at
368, say, suspected terrorists, but broadly to aliens ordered
removed for many and various reasons, including tourist visa
violations. See 8 U. S. C. $ 1231(a)(6) (1994 ed., Supp. V)
(referencing $ 1227(a)(1)(C)); cf. Hendricks, 521 U. S., at 357-
358 (only individuals with "past sexually violent behavior
and a present mental condition that creates a likelihood of
such conduct in the future" may be detained). And, once
the flight risk justification evaporates, the only special cir533US2 Unit: $U87 [10-21-02 18:35:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
cumstance present is the alien's removable status itself,which bears no relation to a detainee's dangerousness. Cf.

id., at 358; Foucha, supra, at 82.Moreover, the sole procedural protections available to the
alien are found in administrative proceedings, where thealien bears the burden of proving he is not dangerous, without (in the Government's view) significant later judicial review. Compare 8 CFR $ 241.4(d)(1) (2001) (imposing burdenof proving nondangerousness upon alien) with

Foucha,
supra, at 82 (striking down insanity-related detention forthat very reason). This Court has suggested, however, that

the Constitution may well preclude granting "an administrative body the unreviewable authority to make determinations implicating fundamental rights." Superintendent,
Mass. Correctional Institution at Walpole v. Hill, 472 U. S.
445, 450 (1985) (O'Connor, J.); see also Crowell, 285 U. S., at
87 (Brandeis, J., dissenting) ("[U]nder certain circumstances,
the constitutional requirement of due process is a requirement of judicial process"). The Constitution demands
greater procedural protection even for property. See South
Carolina v. Regan, 465 U. S. 367, 393 (1984) (O'Connor, J.,
concurring in judgment); Phillips v. Commissioner, 283 U. S.
589, 595-597 (1931) (Brandeis, J.). The serious constitutional problem arising out of a statute that, in these circumstances, permits an indefinite, perhaps permanent, deprivation of human liberty without any such protection is obvious.

The Government argues that, from a constitutional perspective, alien status itself can justify indefinite detention,
and points to Shaughnessy v. United States ex rel. Mezei,
345 U. S. 206 (1953), as support. That case involved a once
lawfully admitted alien who left the United States, returned
after a trip abroad, was refused admission, and was left on
Ellis Island, indefinitely detained there because the Government could not find another country to accept him. The
Court held that Mezei's detention did not violate the Constitution. Id., at 215-216.

693Cite as: 533 U. S. 678 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
Although Mezei, like the present cases, involves indefinitedetention, it differs from the present cases in a critical respect. As the Court emphasized, the alien's extended de-parture from the United States required him to seek entry
into this country once again. His presence on Ellis Islanddid not count as entry into the United States. Hence, he
was "treated," for constitutional purposes, "as if stopped
at the border." Id., at 213, 215. And that made all thedifference.

The distinction between an alien who has effected an entryinto the United States and one who has never entered runs
throughout immigration law. See Kaplan v. Tod, 267 U. S.
228, 230 (1925) (despite nine years' presence in the United
States, an "excluded" alien "was still in theory of law at the
boundary line and had gained no foothold in the United
States"); Leng May Ma v. Barber, 357 U. S. 185, 188-190
(1958) (alien "paroled" into the United States pending admissibility had not effected an "entry"). It is well established
that certain constitutional protections available to persons
inside the United States are unavailable to aliens outside of
our geographic borders. See United States v. VerdugoUrquidez, 494 U. S. 259, 269 (1990) (Fifth Amendment's protections do not extend to aliens outside the territorial boundaries); Johnson v. Eisentrager, 339 U. S. 763, 784 (1950)
(same). But once an alien enters the country, the legal
circumstance changes, for the Due Process Clause applies
to all "persons" within the United States, including aliens,
whether their presence here is lawful, unlawful, temporary,
or permanent. See Plyler v. Doe, 457 U. S. 202, 210 (1982);
Mathews v. Diaz, 426 U. S. 67, 77 (1976); Kwong Hai Chew
v. Colding, 344 U. S. 590, 596-598, and n. 5 (1953); Yick Wo
v. Hopkins, 118 U. S. 356, 369 (1886); cf. Mezei, supra, at 212
("[A]liens who have once passed through our gates, even illegally, may be expelled only after proceedings conforming to
traditional standards of fairness encompassed in due process
of law"). Indeed, this Court has held that the Due Process

533US2 Unit: $U87 [10-21-02 18:35:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN
694 ZADVYDAS v. DAVIS

Opinion of the Court
Clause protects an alien subject to a final order of deporta-tion, see

Wong Wing v. United States, 163 U. S. 228, 238
(1896), though the nature of that protection may vary de-pending upon status and circumstance, see

Landon v. Plasencia, 459 U. S. 21, 32-34 (1982); Johnson, supra, at 770.In

Wong Wing, supra, the Court held unconstitutional a
statute that imposed a year of hard labor upon aliens subject
to a final deportation order. That case concerned substan-tive protections for aliens who had been ordered removed,

not procedural protections for aliens whose removability wasbeing determined. Cf.

post, at 704 (Scalia, J., dissenting).
The Court held that punitive measures could not be imposed
upon aliens ordered removed because "all persons within the
territory of the United States are entitled to the protection"
of the Constitution. 163 U. S., at 238 (citing Yick Wo, supra,
at 369 (holding that equal protection guarantee applies to
Chinese aliens)); see also Witkovich, 353 U. S., at 199, 201
(construing statute which applied to aliens ordered deported
in order to avoid substantive constitutional problems). And
contrary to Justice Scalia's characterization, see post, at
703-705, in Mezei itself, both this Court's rejection of Mezei's
challenge to the procedures by which he was deemed excludable and its rejection of his challenge to continued detention
rested upon a basic territorial distinction. See Mezei,
supra, at 215 (holding that Mezei's presence on Ellis Island
was not "considered a landing" and did "not affec[t]" his legal
or constitutional status (internal quotation marks omitted)).

In light of this critical distinction between Mezei and the
present cases, Mezei does not offer the Government significant support, and we need not consider the aliens' claim that
subsequent developments have undermined Mezei's legal
authority. See Brief for Petitioner in No. 99-7791, p. 23;
Brief for Respondent in No. 00-38, pp. 16-17; Brief for
Lawyers' Committee for Human Rights as Amicus Curiae

Opinion of the Court
due process protection for removable aliens to freedom fromdetention that is arbitrary or capricious. See

post, at 717-
722 (dissenting opinion).The Government also looks for support to cases holding

that Congress has "plenary power" to create immigrationlaw, and that the Judicial Branch must defer to Executive
and Legislative Branch decisionmaking in that area. Brief
for Respondents in No. 99-7791, at 17, 20 (citing Harisiadesv.

Shaughnessy, 342 U. S. 580, 588-589 (1952)). But that
power is subject to important constitutional limitations.See

INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919, 941-942 (1983) (Congress
must choose "a constitutionally permissible means of implementing" that power); The Chinese Exclusion Case, 130
U. S. 581, 604 (1889) (congressional authority limited "by the
Constitution itself and considerations of public policy and
justice which control, more or less, the conduct of all civilized
nations"). In these cases, we focus upon those limitations.
In doing so, we nowhere deny the right of Congress to remove aliens, to subject them to supervision with conditions
when released from detention, or to incarcerate them where
appropriate for violations of those conditions. See 8 U. S. C.

$ 1231(a)(3) (1994 ed., Supp. V) (granting authority to Attorney General to prescribe regulations governing supervision of aliens not removed within 90 days); $ 1253 (imposing
penalties for failure to comply with release conditions).
The question before us is not one of " `confer[ring] on those
admitted the right to remain against the national will' "
or " `sufferance of aliens' " who should be removed. Post,
at 703 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (emphasis deleted) (quoting Mezei, 345 U. S., at 222-223 (Jackson, J., dissenting)).
Rather, the issue we address is whether aliens that the Government finds itself unable to remove are to be condemned to
an indefinite term of imprisonment within the United States.

Nor do the cases before us require us to consider the political branches' authority to control entry into the United
States. Hence we leave no "unprotected spot in the Na533US2 Unit: $U87 [10-21-02 18:35:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tion's armor." Kwong Hai Chew, 344 U. S., at 602. Neitherdo we consider terrorism or other special circumstances

where special arguments might be made for forms of preven-tive detention and for heightened deference to the judgments of the political branches with respect to matters ofnational security. The sole foreign policy consideration the
Government mentions here is the concern lest courts inter-fere with "sensitive" repatriation negotiations. Brief for
Respondents in No. 99-7791, at 21. But neither the Govern-ment nor the dissents explain how a habeas court's efforts
to determine the likelihood of repatriation, if handled withappropriate sensitivity, could make a significant difference in
this respect. See infra, at 699-700.Finally, the Government argues that, whatever liberty interest the aliens possess, it is "greatly diminished" by theirlack of a legal right to "liv[e] at large in this country." Brief
for Respondents in No. 99-7791, at 47; see also post, at 703(

Scalia, J., dissenting) (characterizing right at issue as"right to release into this country"). The choice, however,

is not between imprisonment and the alien "living at large."Brief for Respondents in No. 99-7791, at 47

. It is betweenimprisonment and supervision under release conditions that

may not be violated. See supra, at 695 (citing 8 U. S. C.$$ 1231(a)(3), 1253 (1994 ed., Supp. V)); 8 CFR $ 241.5 (2001)
(establishing conditions of release after removal period).And, for the reasons we have set forth, we believe that an
alien's liberty interest is, at the least, strong enough to raisea serious question as to whether, irrespective of the procedures used, cf. post, at 722-724 (Kennedy, J., dissenting), theConstitution permits detention that is indefinite and potentially permanent. B

Despite this constitutional problem, if "Congress has madeits intent" in the statute "clear, `we must give effect to that
intent.' " Miller v. French, 530 U. S. 327, 336 (2000) (quoting
Sinclair Refining Co. v. Atkinson, 370 U. S. 195, 215 (1962)).

Opinion of the Court
We cannot find here, however, any clear indication of con-gressional intent to grant the Attorney General the power

to hold indefinitely in confinement an alien ordered removed.And that is so whether protecting the community from dangerous aliens is a primary or (as we believe) secondary statu-tory purpose. Cf.

post, at 706, 708-709 (Kennedy, J., dissenting). After all, the provision is part of a statute that
has as its basic purpose effectuating an alien's removal.Why should we assume that Congress saw the alien's dangerousness as unrelated to this purpose?The Government points to the statute's word "may." But
while "may" suggests discretion, it does not necessarily suggest unlimited discretion. In that respect the word "may"
is ambiguous. Indeed, if Congress had meant to authorize
long-term detention of unremovable aliens, it certainly could
have spoken in clearer terms. Cf. 8 U. S. C. $ 1537(b)(2)(C)
(1994 ed., Supp. V) ("If no country is willing to receive" a
terrorist alien ordered removed, "the Attorney General may,
notwithstanding any other provision of law, retain the alien
in custody" and must review the detention determination
every six months).

The Government points to similar related statutes that require detention of criminal aliens during removal proceedings and the removal period, and argues that these show that
mandatory detention is the rule while discretionary release
is the narrow exception. See Brief for Petitioners in
No. 00-38, at 26-28 (citing 8 U. S. C. $$ 1226(c), 1231(a)(2)).
But the statute before us applies not only to terrorists and
criminals, but also to ordinary visa violators, see supra, at
691; and, more importantly, post-removal-period detention,
unlike detention pending a determination of removability or
during the subsequent 90-day removal period, has no obvious
termination point.

The Government also points to the statute's history. That
history catalogs a series of changes, from an initial period
(before 1952) when lower courts had interpreted statutory

Opinion of the Court
We have found nothing in the history of these statutesthat clearly demonstrates a congressional intent to authorize indefinite, perhaps permanent, detention. Consequently,interpreting the statute to avoid a serious constitutional
threat, we conclude that, once removal is no longer reason-ably foreseeable, continued detention is no longer authorized
by statute. See 1 E. Coke, Institutes *70b ("Cessante ratione legis cessat ipse lex") (the rationale of a legal rule nolonger being applicable, that rule itself no longer applies).

IV
The Government seems to argue that, even under our in-terpretation of the statute, a federal habeas court would

have to accept the Government's view about whether theimplicit statutory limitation is satisfied in a particular case,
conducting little or no independent review of the matter. Inour view, that is not so. Whether a set of particular circumstances amounts to detention within, or beyond, a period rea-sonably necessary to secure removal is determinative of
whether the detention is, or is not, pursuant to statutoryauthority. The basic federal habeas corpus statute grants
the federal courts authority to answer that question. See 28U. S. C. $ 2241(c)(3) (granting courts authority to determine
whether detention is "in violation of the . . . laws . . . of theUnited States"). In doing so the courts carry out what this
Court has described as the "historic purpose of the writ,"namely, "to relieve detention by executive authorities without judicial trial." Brown v. Allen, 344 U. S. 443, 533 (1953)(Jackson, J., concurring in result).

In answering that basic question, the habeas court mustask whether the detention in question exceeds a period reasonably necessary to secure removal. It should measurereasonableness primarily in terms of the statute's basic purpose, namely, assuring the alien's presence at the moment ofremoval. Thus, if removal is not reasonably foreseeable, the
court should hold continued detention unreasonable and no

700 ZADVYDAS v. DAVIS

Opinion of the Court
longer authorized by statute. In that case, of course, thealien's release may and should be conditioned on any of the

various forms of supervised release that are appropriate inthe circumstances, and the alien may no doubt be returned
to custody upon a violation of those conditions. See supra,at 695 (citing 8 U. S. C. $$ 1231(a)(3), 1253 (1994 ed., Supp. V);
8 CFR $ 241.5 (2001)). And if removal is reasonably foreseeable, the habeas court should consider the risk of the alien'scommitting further crimes as a factor potentially justifying

confinement within that reasonable removal period. See
supra, at 690-692.

We recognize, as the Government points out, that review
must take appropriate account of the greater immigrationrelated expertise of the Executive Branch, of the serious administrative needs and concerns inherent in the necessarily
extensive INS efforts to enforce this complex statute, and
the Nation's need to "speak with one voice" in immigration
matters. Brief for Respondents in No. 99-7791, at 19. But
we believe that courts can take appropriate account of such
matters without abdicating their legal responsibility to review the lawfulness of an alien's continued detention.

Ordinary principles of judicial review in this area recognize primary Executive Branch responsibility. They counsel
judges to give expert agencies decisionmaking leeway in
matters that invoke their expertise. See Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation v. LTV Corp., 496 U. S. 633, 651-652
(1990). They recognize Executive Branch primacy in foreign policy matters. See Container Corp. of America v.
Franchise Tax Bd., 463 U. S. 159, 196 (1983). And they consequently require courts to listen with care when the Government's foreign policy judgments, including, for example,
the status of repatriation negotiations, are at issue, and to
grant the Government appropriate leeway when its judgments rest upon foreign policy expertise.

We realize that recognizing this necessary Executive leeway will often call for difficult judgments. In order to limit

533US2 Unit: $U87 [10-21-02 18:35:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN

701Cite as: 533 U. S. 678 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
the occasions when courts will need to make them, we think
it practically necessary to recognize some presumptively reasonable period of detention. We have adopted similar presumptions in other contexts to guide lower court determinations. See Cheff v. Schnackenberg, 384 U. S. 373, 379-380
(1966) (plurality opinion) (adopting rule, based on definition
of "petty offense" in United States Code, that right to jury
trial extends to all cases in which sentence of six months or
greater is imposed); County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500
U. S. 44, 56-58 (1991) (O'Connor, J.) (adopting presumption,
based on lower court estimate of time needed to process arrestee, that 48-hour delay in probable-cause hearing after
arrest is reasonable, hence constitutionally permissible).

While an argument can be made for confining any presumption to 90 days, we doubt that when Congress shortened the removal period to 90 days in 1996 it believed that
all reasonably foreseeable removals could be accomplished
in that time. We do have reason to believe, however, that
Congress previously doubted the constitutionality of detention for more than six months. See Juris. Statement in
United States v. Witkovich, O. T. 1956, No. 295, pp. 8-9.
Consequently, for the sake of uniform administration in the
federal courts, we recognize that period. After this 6-
month period, once the alien provides good reason to believe
that there is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future, the Government must respond
with evidence sufficient to rebut that showing. And for detention to remain reasonable, as the period of prior postremoval confinement grows, what counts as the "reasonably
foreseeable future" conversely would have to shrink. This
6-month presumption, of course, does not mean that every
alien not removed must be released after six months. To
the contrary, an alien may be held in confinement until it
has been determined that there is no significant likelihood of
removal in the reasonably foreseeable future.

V
The Fifth Circuit held Zadvydas' continued detention lawful as long as "good faith efforts to effectuate . . . deportation
continue" and Zadvydas failed to show that deportation will
prove "impossible." 185 F. 3d, at 294, 297. But this standard would seem to require an alien seeking release to show
the absence of any prospect of removal--no matter how unlikely or unforeseeable--which demands more than our reading of the statute can bear. The Ninth Circuit held that the
Government was required to release Ma from detention because there was no reasonable likelihood of his removal in
the foreseeable future. 208 F. 3d, at 831. But its conclusion
may have rested solely upon the "absence" of an "extant or
pending" repatriation agreement without giving due weight
to the likelihood of successful future negotiations. See id.,
at 831, and n. 30. Consequently, we vacate the judgments
below and remand both cases for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

I join Part I of Justice Kennedy's dissent, which establishes the Attorney General's clear statutory authority to detain criminal aliens with no specified time limit. I write
separately because I do not believe that, as Justice Kennedy suggests in Part II of his opinion, there may be some
situations in which the courts can order release. I believe
that in both Zadvydas v. Davis, No. 99-7791, and Ashcroft v.
Ma, No. 00-38, a "careful description" of the substantive
right claimed, Reno v. Flores, 507 U. S. 292, 302 (1993), suffices categorically to refute its existence. A criminal alien
under final order of removal who allegedly will not be accepted by any other country in the reasonably foreseeable

from "physical restraint" or freedom from "indefinite deten-tion,"

ante, at 689, 690, but it is at bottom a claimed right of
release into this country by an individual who concededlyhas no legal right to be here. There is no such constitutional

right.Like a criminal alien under final order of removal, an inadmissible alien at the border has no right to be in the United
States. The Chinese Exclusion Case, 130 U. S. 581, 603(1889). In

Shaughnessy v. United States ex rel. Mezei, 345
U. S. 206 (1953), we upheld potentially indefinite detention ofsuch an inadmissible alien whom the Government was unable

to return anywhere else. We said that "we [did] not thinkthat respondent's continued exclusion deprives him of any
statutory or constitutional right." Id., at 215. While fourMembers of the Court thought that Mezei deserved greater
procedural protections (the Attorney General had refused todivulge any information as to why Mezei was being detained,
id., at 209), no Justice asserted that Mezei had a substantiveconstitutional right to release into this country. And Justice
Jackson's dissent, joined by Justice Frankfurter, affirmatively asserted the opposite, with no contradiction from theCourt: "Due process does not invest any alien with a right

to enter the United States, nor confer on those admitted the
right to remain against the national will. Nothing in the
Constitution requires admission or sufferance of aliens hostile to our scheme of government." Id., at 222-223 (emphasis added). Insofar as a claimed legal right to release into
this country is concerned, an alien under final order of removal stands on an equal footing with an inadmissible alien
at the threshold of entry: He has no such right.

The Court expressly declines to apply or overrule Mezei,
ante, at 694, but attempts to distinguish it--or, I should
rather say, to obscure it in a legal fog. First, the Court
claims that "[t]he distinction between an alien who has effected an entry into the United States and one who has never
entered runs throughout immigration law." Ante, at 693.
True enough, but only where that distinction makes perfect

sense: with regard to the question of what procedures arenecessary to prevent entry, as opposed to what procedures

are necessary to eject a person already in the United States.See, e. g., Landon v. Plasencia, 459 U. S. 21, 32 (1982) ("Our
cases have frequently suggested that a continuously presentresident alien is entitled to a fair hearing when threatened
with deportation" (emphasis added)). The Court's citationof

Wong Wing v. United States, 163 U. S. 228 (1896), for theproposition that we have "held that the Due Process Clause

protects an alien subject to a final order of deportation,"ante, at 693-694, is arguably relevant. That case at least involved aliens under final order of deportation.* But all itheld is that they could not be subjected to the punishment
of hard labor without a judicial trial. I am sure they cannotbe tortured, as well--but neither prohibition has anything to
do with their right to be released into the United States.Nor does Wong Wing show that the rights of detained aliens
subject to final order of deportation are different from therights of aliens arrested and detained at the border--unless
the Court believes that the detained alien in Mezei couldhave been set to hard labor.

Mezei thus stands unexplained and undistinguished by theCourt's opinion. We are offered no justification why an alien
under a valid and final order of removal--which has totally
extinguished whatever right to presence in this country hepossessed--has any greater due process right to be released

into the country than an alien at the border seeking entry.

*The Court also cites Landon v. Plasencia, 459 U. S. 21 (1982), as
oblique support for the claim that the due process protection afforded
aliens under final order of removal "may vary depending upon status and
circumstance." Ante, at 694. But that case is entirely inapt because it
did not involve an alien subject to a final order of deportation. The Court
also cites Johnson v. Eisentrager, 339 U. S. 763, 770 (1950), ante, at 694,
but that case is doubly irrelevant: because it dealt not with deportation
but with the military's detention of enemy aliens outside the territorial
jurisdiction of the United States, and because it rejected habeas corpus
jurisdiction anyway.

Congress undoubtedly thought that both groups of aliens--inadmissible aliens at the threshold and criminal aliens under

final order of removal--could be constitutionally detained onthe same terms, since it provided the authority to detain
both groups in the very same statutory provision, see 8U. S. C. $ 1231(a)(6). Because I believe Mezei controls these
cases, and, like the Court, I also see no reason to reconsider
Mezei, I find no constitutional impediment to the discretionCongress gave to the Attorney General.

Justice Kennedy's dissent explains the clarity of the detention provision,and I see no obstacle to following the statute's plain meaning.

Justice Kennedy, with whom The Chief Justice joins,and with whom

Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas joinas to Part I, dissenting.

The Court says its duty is to avoid a constitutional ques-tion. It deems the duty performed by interpreting a statute
in obvious disregard of congressional intent; curing the re-sulting gap by writing a statutory amendment of its own;
committing its own grave constitutional error by arrogatingto the Judicial Branch the power to summon high officers of
the Executive to assess their progress in conducting some of
the Nation's most sensitive negotiations with foreign powers;and then likely releasing into our general population at least

hundreds of removable or inadmissible aliens who have beenfound by fair procedures to be flight risks, dangers to the
community, or both. Far from avoiding a constitutionalquestion, the Court's ruling causes systemic dislocation in
the balance of powers, thus raising serious constitutionalconcerns not just for the cases at hand but for the Court's
own view of its proper authority. Any supposed respect theCourt seeks in not reaching the constitutional question is
outweighed by the intrusive and erroneous exercise of itsown powers. In the guise of judicial restraint the Court
ought not to intrude upon the other branches. The constitutional question the statute presents, it must be acknowl533US2 Unit: $U87 [10-21-02 18:35:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN

edged, may be a significant one in some later case; but itought not to drive us to an incorrect interpretation of the

statute. The Court having reached the wrong result for thewrong reason, this respectful dissent is required.

I
The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U. S. C.$ 1101 et seq. (1994 ed. and Supp. V), is straightforward

enough. It provides:

"An alien ordered removed who is inadmissible undersection 1182 of this title, removable under section

1227(a)(1)(C), 1227(a)(2), or 1227(a)(4) of this title or whohas been determined by the Attorney General to be a
risk to the community or unlikely to comply with theorder of removal, may be detained beyond the removal
period and, if released, shall be subject to the terms ofsupervision in paragraph (3)." 8 U. S. C. $ 1231(a)(6)
(1994 ed., Supp. V).
By this statute, Congress confers upon the Attorney Gen-eral discretion to detain an alien ordered removed. It gives

express authorization to detain "beyond the removal pe-riod." Ibid. The class of removed aliens detainable under
the section includes aliens who were inadmissible and alienssubject to final orders of removal, provided they are a risk
to the community or likely to flee. The issue to be deter-mined is whether the authorization to detain beyond the removal period is subject to the implied, nontextual limitationthat the detention be no longer than reasonably necessary to
effect removal to another country. The majority invokes thecanon of constitutional doubt to read that implied term into
the statute. One can accept the premise that a substantialconstitutional question is presented by the prospect of
lengthy, even unending, detention in some instances; but thestatutory construction the Court adopts should be rejected
in any event. The interpretation has no basis in the lan533US2 Unit: $U87 [10-21-02 18:35:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Kennedy, J., dissenting
guage or structure of the INA and in fact contradicts anddefeats the purpose set forth in the express terms of the

statutory text.The Court, it is submitted, misunderstands the principle
of constitutional avoidance which it seeks to invoke. Themajority gives a brief bow to the rule that courts must
respect the intention of Congress, ante, at 696, but then
waltzes away from any analysis of the language, structure,or purpose of the statute. Its analysis is not consistent with

our precedents explaining the limits of the constitutionaldoubt rule. The rule allows courts to choose among constructions which are "fairly possible," Crowell v. Benson, 285
U. S. 22, 62 (1932), not to " `press statutory construction to
the point of disingenuous evasion even to avoid a constitutional question,' " Salinas v. United States, 522 U. S. 52, 60
(1997) (quoting Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S.
44, 57, n. 9 (1996)). Were a court to find two interpretations
of equal plausibility, it should choose the construction that
avoids confronting a constitutional question. The majority's
reading of the statutory authorization to "detai[n] beyond
the removal period," however, is not plausible. An interpretation which defeats the stated congressional purpose does
not suffice to invoke the constitutional doubt rule, for it is
"plainly contrary to the intent of Congress." United States
v. X-Citement Video, Inc., 513 U. S. 64, 78 (1994). The majority announces it will reject the Government's argument
"that the statute means what it literally says," ante, at 689,
but then declines to offer any other acceptable textual interpretation. The majority does not demonstrate an ambiguity
in the delegation of the detention power to the Attorney
General. It simply amends the statute to impose a time
limit tied to the progress of negotiations to effect the aliens'
removal. The statute cannot be so construed. The requirement the majority reads into the law simply bears
no relation to the text; and in fact it defeats the statutory
purpose and design.

708 ZADVYDAS v. DAVIS

Kennedy, J., dissenting
Other provisions in $ 1231 itself do link the requirement ofa reasonable time period to the removal process. See,

e. g.,

$ 1231(c)(1)(A) (providing that an alien who arrives at a portof entry "shall be removed immediately on a vessel or aircraft" unless "it is impracticable" to do so "within a reasonable time" (emphasis added)); $ 1231(c)(3)(A)(ii)(II) (requiring
the "owner of a vessel or aircraft bringing an alien to the
United States [to] pay the costs of detaining and maintainingthe alien . . . for the period of time

reasonably necessary
for the owner to arrange for repatriation" (emphasis added)).That Congress chose to impose the limitation in these sections and not in $ 1231(a)(6) is evidence of its intent to measure the detention period by other standards. When Congress has made express provisions for the contingency that
repatriation might be difficult or prolonged in other portions
of the statute, it should be presumed that its omission of the
same contingency in the detention section was purposeful.
Indeed, the reasonable time limits in the provisions just
mentioned simply excuse the duty of early removal. They
do not mandate release. An alien within one of these categories, say, a ship stowaway, would be subject as well to
detention beyond the removal period under $ 1231(a)(6), if
the statute is read as written. Under the majority's view,
however, it appears the alien must be released in six months
even if presenting a real danger to the community.

The 6-month period invented by the Court, even when
modified by its sliding standard of reasonableness for certain
repatriation negotiations, see ante, at 701, makes the statutory purpose to protect the community ineffective. The risk
to the community exists whether or not the repatriation negotiations have some end in sight; in fact, when the negotiations end, the risk may be greater. The authority to detain
beyond the removal period is to protect the community, not
to negotiate the aliens' return. The risk to the community
survives repatriation negotiations. To a more limited, but
still significant, extent, so does the concern with flight. It

Kennedy, J., dissenting
is a fact of international diplomacy that governments andtheir policies change; and if repatriation efforts can be revived, the Attorney General has an interest in ensuring thealien can report so the removal process can begin again.

Congress, moreover, was well aware of the difficulties con-fronting aliens who are removable but who cannot be repatriated. It made special provisions allowing them to be employed, a privilege denied to other deportable aliens. See$ 1231(a)(7) (providing an "alien [who] cannot be removed due

to the refusal of all countries designated by the alien orunder this section to receive the alien" still remains eligible
for employment in the United States). Congress' decision
to ameliorate the condition of aliens subject to a final order
of removal who cannot be repatriated, but who need not be
detained, illustrates a balance in the statutory design. Yet
the Court renders the other side of the balance meaningless.
The risk to the community posed by a removable alien is
a function of a variety of circumstances, circumstances that
do not diminish just because the alien cannot be deported
within some foreseeable time. Those circumstances include
the seriousness of the alien's past offenses, his or her efforts
at rehabilitation, and some indication from the alien that,
given the real prospect of detention, the alien will conform
his or her conduct. This is the purpose for the periodic review of detention status provided for by the regulations.
See 8 CFR $ 241.4 (2001). The Court's amendment of the
statute reads out of the provision the congressional decision
that dangerousness alone is a sufficient basis for detention,
see ante, at 699 (citing 1 E. Coke, Institutes *70b), and reads
out as well any meaningful structure for supervised release.

The majority is correct to observe that in United States v.
Witkovich, 353 U. S. 194 (1957), the Court "read significant
limitations into" a statute, ante, at 689, but that does not
permit us to avoid the proper reading of the enactment
now before us. In Witkovich, the Court construed former

$ 1252(d), which required an alien under a final order of de533US2 Unit: $U87 [10-21-02 18:35:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN
710 ZADVYDAS v. DAVIS

Kennedy, J., dissenting
portation "to give information under oath . . . as the Attor-ney General may deem fit and proper." 353 U. S., at 195.

The Court held that although the plain language "appears toconfer upon the Attorney General unbounded authority to
require whatever information he deems desirable of alienswhose deportation has not been effected within six months,"
id., at 199, the constitutional doubt this interpretation would
raise meant the language would be construed as limited tothe provision of information "reasonably calculated to keep

the Attorney General advised regarding the continued avail-ability for departure of aliens whose deportation is overdue,"
id., at 202. In Witkovich the interpretation of the text was
in aid of the statutory purpose; in the instant cases the interpretation nullifies the statutory purpose. Here the statute
by its own terms permits the Attorney General to consider
factors the Court now makes irrelevant.

The majority's unanchored interpretation ignores another
indication that the Attorney General's detention discretion
was not limited to this truncated period. Section 1231(a)(6)
permits continued detention not only of removable aliens but
also of inadmissible aliens, for instance those stopped at the
border before entry. Congress provides for detention of
both categories within the same statutory grant of authority.
Accepting the majority's interpretation, then, there are two
possibilities, neither of which is sustainable. On the one
hand, it may be that the majority's rule applies to both categories of aliens, in which case we are asked to assume that
Congress intended to restrict the discretion it could confer
upon the Attorney General so that all inadmissible aliens
must be allowed into our community within six months. On
the other hand, the majority's logic might be that inadmissible and removable aliens can be treated differently. Yet it
is not a plausible construction of $ 1231(a)(6) to imply a time
limit as to one class but not to another. The text does
not admit of this possibility. As a result, it is difficult to
see why "[a]liens who have not yet gained initial admission

Kennedy, J., dissenting
to this country would present a very different question."
Ante, at 682.

Congress' power to detain aliens in connection with re-moval or exclusion, the Court has said, is part of the Legislature's considerable authority over immigration matters.See,

e. g., Wong Wing v. United States, 163 U. S. 228, 235
(1896) ("Proceedings to exclude or expel would be vain if
those accused could not be held in custody pending the in-quiry into their true character and while arrangements were

being made for their deportation"). It is reasonable to as-sume, then, and it is the proper interpretation of the INA
and $ 1231(a)(6), that when Congress provided for detention
"beyond the removal period," it exercised its considerable
power over immigration and delegated to the Attorney General the discretion to detain inadmissible and other removable aliens for as long as they are determined to be either a
flight risk or a danger to the Nation.

The majority's interpretation, moreover, defeats the very
repatriation goal in which it professes such interest. The
Court rushes to substitute a judicial judgment for the Executive's discretion and authority. As the Government represents to us, judicial orders requiring release of removable
aliens, even on a temporary basis, have the potential to undermine the obvious necessity that the Nation speak with
one voice on immigration and foreign affairs matters. Brief
for Respondents in No. 99-7791, p. 49. The result of the
Court's rule is that, by refusing to accept repatriation of
their own nationals, other countries can effect the release
of these individuals back into the American community.
Ibid. If their own nationals are now at large in the United
States, the nation of origin may ignore or disclaim responsibility to accept their return. Ibid. The interference with
sensitive foreign relations becomes even more acute where
hostility or tension characterizes the relationship, for other
countries can use the fact of judicially mandated release to
their strategic advantage, refusing the return of their nation533US2 Unit: $U87 [10-21-02 18:35:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Kennedy, J., dissenting
als to force dangerous aliens upon us. One of the morealarming aspects of the Court's new venture into foreign

affairs management is the suggestion that the district courtcan expand or contract the reasonable period of detention based on its own assessment of the course of nego-tiations with foreign powers. The Court says it will allow
the Executive to perform its duties on its own for six months;
after that, foreign relations go into judicially supervisedreceivership.

The cases which the Court relies upon to support the im-position of presumptions are inapposite. The rule announced in Cheff v. Schnackenberg, 384 U. S. 373 (1966)--
"that sentences exceeding six months for criminal contempt
may not be imposed by federal courts absent a jury trial"--
was based on the definition of a "petty offense" that was still
operable in the United States Code, and was proper "under
the peculiar power of the federal courts to revise sentences
in contempt cases." Id., at 380. The majority can point to
no similar statutory or judicial source for its authority to
create its own time-based rule in these cases. It cites only
an observation in a brief filed by the Government in United
States v. Witkovich, O. T. 1956, No. 295, pp. 8-9, see ante, at
701, relying, in turn, on doubts expressed in a 1952 Senate
Report concerning detention for longer than six months
under an Act with standards different from, and far less precise than, those applicable here. In County of Riverside v.
McLaughlin, 500 U. S. 44 (1991), our reasonableness presumption for delays of less than 48 hours between an arrest
and a probable-cause hearing was, as the majority recognizes, ante, at 701, based on the "Court of Appeals' determination of the time required to complete those procedures."
500 U. S., at 57. Here, as far as we know, the 6-month period
bears no particular relationship to how long it now takes to
deport any group of aliens, or, for that matter, how long it
took in the past to remove. Zadvydas' case itself demonstrates that the repatriation process may often take years to

Kennedy, J., dissenting
negotiate, involving difficult issues of establishing citizenshipand the like. See Brief for Petitioner in No. 99-7791,

pp. 17-20.It is to be expected that from time to time a foreign power
will adopt a truculent stance with respect to the UnitedStates and other nations. Yet the Court by its time limit,
or presumptive time limit, goes far to undercut the position
of the Executive in repatriation negotiations, thus ill servingthe interest of all foreign nationals of the country concerned.

Law-abiding aliens might wish to return to their home coun-try, for instance, but the strained relationship caused by the
difficult repatriation talks might prove to be a substantial
obstacle for these aliens as well.

In addition to weakening the hand of our Government,
court ordered release cannot help but encourage dilatory and
obstructive tactics by aliens who, emboldened by the Court's
new rule, have good reason not to cooperate by making their
own repatriation or transfer seem foreseeable. An alien ordered deported also has less incentive to cooperate or to facilitate expeditious removal when he has been released, even
on a supervised basis, than does an alien held at an Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) detention facility.
Neither the alien nor his family would find any urgency in
assisting with a petition to other countries to accept the alien
back if the alien could simply remain in the United States
indefinitely.

The risk to the community posed by the mandatory release
of aliens who are dangerous or a flight risk is far from insubstantial; the motivation to protect the citizenry from aliens
determined to be dangerous is central to the immigration
power itself. The Government cites statistical studies showing high recidivism rates for released aliens. One Government Accounting Office study cited by Congress in floor debates on the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act
of 1996, 110 Stat. 1214, put the figure as high as 77 percent.

Kennedy, J., dissenting
No. 99-7791, at 27, n. 13. It seems evident a criminal recordaccumulated by an admitted alien during his or her time in

the United States is likely to be a better indicator of riskthan factors relied upon during the INS's initial decision to
admit or exclude. Aliens ordered deported as the result ofhaving committed a felony have proved to be dangerous.

Any suggestion that aliens who have completed prison
terms no longer present a danger simply does not accordwith the reality that a significant risk may still exist, as determined by the many factors set forth in the regulations.See 8 CFR $ 241.4(f) (2001). Underworld and terrorist links
are subtle and may be overseas, beyond our jurisdiction to
impose felony charges. Furthermore, the majority's rationale seems to apply to an alien who flees prosecution or escapes from custody in some other country. The fact an alien
can be deemed inadmissible because of fraud at the time of
entry does not necessarily distinguish his or her case from
an alien whose entry was legal. Consider, for example, a
fugitive alien who enters by fraud or stealth and resides here
for five years with significant ties to the community, though
still presenting a danger; contrast him with an alien who
entered lawfully but a month later committed an act making
him removable. Why the Court's rationale should apply to
the second alien but not the first is not apparent.

The majority cannot come to terms with these distinctions
under its own rationale. The rule the majority creates permits consideration of nothing more than the reasonable foreseeability of removal. See ante, at 699-700. That standard
is not only without sound basis in the statutory structure,
but also is not susceptible to customary judicial inquiry.
Cf. INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U. S. 415, 425 (1999) ("The
judiciary is not well positioned to shoulder primary responsibility for assessing the likelihood and importance of such
diplomatic repercussions"). The majority does say that the
release of terrorists or other "special circumstances" might
justify "heightened deference to the judgments of the politi533US2 Unit: $U87 [10-21-02 18:35:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Kennedy, J., dissenting
cal branches with respect to matters of national security."
Ante, at 696. Here the Court appears to rely on an assessment of risk, but this is the very premise it finds inadequateto sustain the natural reading of the statute. The Court

ought not to reject a rationale in order to deny power to theAttorney General and then invoke the same rationale to save
its own analysis.

This rule of startling breadth invites potentially perverseresults. Because other nations may refuse to admit aliens

who have committed certain crimes--see, e. g., Brief for Pe-titioner in No. 99-7791, at 19 ("Lithuanian law precludes
granting of citizenship to persons who, before coming to
Lithuania, have been sentenced in another state to imprisonment for a deliberate crime for which criminal liability is
imposed by the laws of the Republic of Lithuania" (citations
and internal quotation marks omitted))--often the aliens
who have committed the most serious crimes will be those
who may be released immediately under the majority's rule.
An example is presented in the case of Saroeut Ourk, a Cambodian alien determined to be removable and held pending
deportation. See Ourk v. INS, No. 00-35645 (CA9, Sept. 18,
2000), cert. pending, No. 00-987. Ourk was convicted of
rape by use of drugs in conjunction with the kidnaping of a
13-year-old girl; after serving 18 months of his prison term,
he was released on parole but was returned to custody twice
more for parole violations. Pet. for Cert. in No. 00-987,
pp. 4-5. When he was ordered deported and transferred to
the custody of the INS, it is no surprise the INS determined
he was both a flight risk and a danger to the community.
Yet the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit concluded,
based on its earlier decision in Kim Ho Ma v. Reno, 208 F. 3d
815 (2000), that Ourk could no longer be held pending deportation, since removal to Cambodia was not reasonably foreseeable. App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 00-987, pp. 3a-4a.

Vietnamese citizen convicted of voluntary manslaughter in acrime involving the attempted murder of two other persons).
Today's result will ensure these dangerous individuals, andhundreds more like them, will remain free while the Executive Branch tries to secure their removal. By contrast,aliens who violate mere tourist visa requirements,

ante, at
691, can in the typical case be held pending deportation ongrounds that a minor offender is more likely to be removed.

There is no reason to suppose Congress intended this odd
result.

The majority's rule is not limited to aliens once lawfully
admitted. Today's result may well mandate the release of
those aliens who first gained entry illegally or by fraud,
and, indeed, is broad enough to require even that inadmissible and excludable aliens detained at the border be set free
in our community. In Rosales-Garcia v. Holland, 238 F. 3d
704, 725 (CA6 2001), for example, Rosales, a Cuban citizen,
arrived in this country during the 1980 Mariel boatlift. Id.,

released into the custody of a relative under the Attorney
General's authority to parole illegal aliens, see 8 U. S. C.

for which he ultimately served time. Id., at 708. The INSeventually revoked Rosales' immigration parole, ordered him

deported, and held him pending deportation, subject to peri-odic consideration for parole under the Cuban Review Plan.
See 8 CFR $ 212.12(g)(2) (2001). In reasoning remarkablysimilar to the majority's, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth
Circuit held that the indefinite detention of Rosales violated
Fifth Amendment due process rights, because "the govern-ment has offered . . . no credible proof that there is any possibility that Cuba may accept Rosales's return anytime in theforeseeable future." 238 F. 3d, at 725. This result--that
Mariel Cubans and other illegal, inadmissible aliens will be
released notwithstanding their criminal history and obvious
flight risk--would seem a necessary consequence of the majority's construction of the statute.

The majority's confidence that the Judiciary will handle
these matters "with appropriate sensitivity," ante, at 696,
700, allows no meaningful category to confine or explain its
own sweeping rule, provides no justification for wresting this
sovereign power away from the political branches in the first
place, and has no support in judicially manageable standards
for deciding the foreseeability of removal.

It is curious that the majority would approve of continued
detention beyond the 90-day period, or, for that matter, during the 90-day period, where deportation is not reasonably
foreseeable. If the INS cannot detain an alien because he
is dangerous, it would seem irrelevant to the Constitution or
to the majority's presumption that the INS has detained the
alien for only a little while. The reason detention is permitted at all is that a removable alien does not have the same
liberty interest as a citizen does. The Court cannot bring
itself to acknowledge this established proposition. Likewise, it is far from evident under the majority's theory why
the INS can condition and supervise the release of aliens
who are not removable in the reasonably foreseeable future,
or why "the alien may no doubt be returned to custody upon

a violation of those conditions." Ante, at 700. It is truethat threat of revocation of supervised release is necessary

to make the supervised release itself effective, a fact evencounsel for Zadvydas acknowledged. Brief for Petitioner
in No. 99-7791, at 20-21. If that is so, however, the wholefoundation for the Court's position collapses.

The Court today assumes a role in foreign relations whichis unprecedented, unfortunate, and unwise. Its misstep results in part from a misunderstanding of the liberty intereststhese aliens retain, an issue next to be discussed.

II
The aliens' claims are substantial; their plight is real.They face continued detention, perhaps for life, unless it is

shown they no longer present a flight risk or a danger to thecommunity. In a later case the specific circumstances of a
detention may present a substantial constitutional question.That is not a reason, however, for framing a rule which
ignores the law governing alien status.As persons within our jurisdiction, the aliens are entitled
to the protection of the Due Process Clause. Liberty underthe Due Process Clause includes protection against unlawful
or arbitrary personal restraint or detention. The libertyrights of the aliens before us here are subject to limitations
and conditions not applicable to citizens, however. See, e. g.,Mathews v. Diaz, 426 U. S. 67, 79-80 (1976) ("In the exercise
of its broad power over naturalization and immigration, Con-gress regularly makes rules that would be unacceptable if
applied to citizens"). No party to this proceeding conteststhe initial premise that the aliens have been determined to
be removable after a fair hearing under lawful and properprocedures. Section 1229a sets forth the proceedings required for deciding the inadmissibility or removability of analien, including a hearing before an immigration judge, at
which the INS carries "the burden of establishing by clearand convincing evidence that . . . the alien is deportable." 8

Kennedy, J., dissenting
U. S. C. $ 1229a(c)(3)(A); see also Berenyi v. District Director, INS, 385 U. S. 630, 636 (1967) ("When the Government
seeks to . . . deport a resident alien and send him from ourshores, it carries the heavy burden of proving its case by

clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence" (internal quo-tation marks and footnotes omitted)). Aliens ordered removed pursuant to these procedures are given notice of their
right to appeal the decision, 8 U. S. C. $ 1229a(c)(4), maymove the immigration judge to reconsider, $ 1229a(c)(5), can

seek discretionary cancellation of removal, $ 1229b, and canobtain habeas review of the Attorney General's decision not
to consider waiver of deportation. See INS v. St. Cyr, ante,
at 314. As a result, aliens like Zadvydas and Ma do not
arrive at their removable status without thorough, substantial procedural safeguards.

The majority likely is correct to say that the distinction
between an alien who entered the United States, as these
aliens did, and one who has not, "runs throughout immigration law." Ante, at 693. The distinction is not so clear as
it might seem, however, and I doubt it will suffice to confine
the rationale adopted by the majority. The case which often
comes to mind when one tests the distinction is Shaughnessy
v. United States ex rel. Mezei, 345 U. S. 206 (1953), where
the Court considered the situation of an alien denied entry
and detained on Ellis Island. The detention had no foreseeable end, for though Mezei was inadmissible to the United
States it seemed no other country would have him. Id., at
209. The case presented a line-drawing problem, asking
whether the alien was in our country; or whether his situation was the same as if he were still on foreign shores; or
whether he fell in a legal category somewhere in between,
though if this were true, it still would not be clear how to
resolve the case. The Court held the alien had no right to
a hearing to secure his release. Id., at 212-213. (Approximately 17 months after this Court denied Mezei relief, the
Attorney General released him on parole. It appears Mezei

never returned to INS custody, though he was not admittedto the United States as a citizen or lawful permanent resident. See Weisselberg, The Exclusion and Detention ofAliens: Lessons From the Lives of Ellen Knauff and Ignatz
Mezei, 143 U. Pa. L. Rev. 933, 979-984 (1995).)Here the majority says the earlier presence of these aliens
in the United States distinguishes the cases from Mezei.
For reasons given here it is submitted the majority is incor-rect in its major conclusions in all events, so even if it were

assumed these aliens are in a class with more rights than
Mezei, it makes no difference. For purposes of this dissent
it is not necessary to rely upon Mezei.

That said, it must be made clear these aliens are in a position far different from aliens with a lawful right to remain
here. They are removable, and their rights must be defined
in accordance with that status. The due process analysis
must begin with a "careful description of the asserted right."
Reno v. Flores, 507 U. S. 292, 302 (1993). We have "long
held that an alien seeking initial admission to the United
States requests a privilege and has no constitutional rights
regarding his application, for the power to admit or exclude
aliens is a sovereign prerogative." Landon v. Plasencia,
459 U. S. 21, 32 (1982). The same is true for those aliens
like Zadvydas and Ma, who face a final order of removal.
When an alien is removable, he or she has no right under
the basic immigration laws to remain in this country. The
removal orders reflect the determination that the aliens'
ties to this community are insufficient to justify their continued presence in the United States. An alien's admission to this country is conditioned upon compliance with our

laws, and removal is the consequence of a breach of that
understanding.

It is true the Court has accorded more procedural protections to those aliens admitted to the country than those
stopped at the border, observing that "a continuously present alien is entitled to a fair hearing when threatened with

533US2 Unit: $U87 [10-21-02 18:35:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Kennedy, J., dissenting
deportation." Ibid.; Mezei, supra, at 212 ("[A]liens whohave once passed through our gates, even illegally, may be

expelled only after proceedings conforming to traditionalstandards of fairness encompassed in due process of law. . . .
But an alien on the threshold of initial entry stands on adifferent footing: `Whatever the procedure authorized by
Congress is, it is due process as far as an alien denied entry
is concerned' " (quoting United States ex rel. Knauff v.
Shaughnessy, 338 U. S. 537, 544 (1950))). Removable and
excludable aliens are situated differently before an order ofremoval is entered; the removable alien, by virtue of his

continued presence here, possesses an interest in remaining, while the excludable alien seeks only the privilege of
entry.

Still, both removable and inadmissible aliens are entitled
to be free from detention that is arbitrary or capricious.
Where detention is incident to removal, the detention cannot
be justified as punishment nor can the confinement or its conditions be designed in order to punish. See Wong Wing v.
United States, 163 U. S. 228 (1896). This accords with international views on detention of refugees and asylum seekers.
See Report of the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, U. N. Doc. E/CN.4/2000/4 (Dec. 28, 1999);
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Guidelines
on Applicable Criteria and Standards Relating to the Detention on Asylum-Seekers (Feb. 10, 1999). It is neither arbitrary nor capricious to detain the aliens when necessary to
avoid the risk of flight or danger to the community.

Whether a due process right is denied when removable
aliens who are flight risks or dangers to the community are
detained turns, then, not on the substantive right to be free,
but on whether there are adequate procedures to review
their cases, allowing persons once subject to detention to
show that through rehabilitation, new appreciation of their
responsibilities, or under other standards, they no longer
present special risks or danger if put at large. The proce533US2 Unit: $U87 [10-21-02 18:35:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Kennedy, J., dissenting
dures to determine and to review the status-required deten-tion go far toward this objective.

By regulations, promulgated after notice and comment,the Attorney General has given structure to the discretion
delegated by the INA in order to ensure fairness and regu-larity in INS detention decisions. First, the INS provides
for an initial postcustody review, before the expiration of the
90-day removal period, at which a district director conductsa record review. 8 CFR $ 241.4 (2001). The alien is entitled

to present any relevant information in support of release,and the district director has the discretion to interview the
alien for a personal evaluation. $ 241.4(h)(1). At the end of
the 90-day period, the alien, if held in custody, is transferred
to a postorder detention unit at INS headquarters, which in
the ordinary course will conduct an initial custody review
within three months of the transfer. $ 241.4(k)(2)(ii). If the
INS determines the alien should remain in detention, a twomember panel of INS officers interviews the alien and makes
a recommendation to INS headquarters. $$ 241.4(i)(1)-(3).
The regulations provide an extensive, nonexhaustive list of
factors that should be considered in the recommendation to
release or further detain. Those include: "[t]he nature and
number of disciplinary infractions"; "the detainee's criminal
conduct and criminal convictions, including consideration of
the nature and severity of the alien's convictions, sentences
imposed and time actually served, probation and criminal parole history, evidence of recidivism, and other criminal history"; "psychiatric and psychological reports pertaining to
the detainee's mental health"; "[e]vidence of rehabilitation";
"[f]avorable factors, including ties to the United States such
as the number of close relatives"; "[p]rior immigration violations and history"; "[t]he likelihood that the alien is a significant flight risk or may abscond to avoid removal, including
history of escapes"; and any other probative information.

$ 241.4(f). Another review must occur within one year, with
mandatory evaluations each year thereafter; if the alien re533US2 Unit: $U87 [10-21-02 18:35:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN

723Cite as: 533 U. S. 678 (2001)
Kennedy, J., dissenting
quests, the INS has the discretion to grant more frequentreviews. $ 241.4(k)(2)(iii). The INS must provide the alien

30-days advance, written notice of custody reviews; and itmust afford the alien an opportunity to submit any relevant
materials for consideration. $ 241.4(i)(3)(ii). The alien maybe assisted by a representative of his choice during the review, $$ 241.4(i)(3)(i), (ii), and the INS must provide the alien
with a copy of its decision, including a brief statement of thereasons for any continued detention, $ 241.4(d).

In this context the proper analysis can be informed by ourcases involving parole-eligibility or parole-revocation determinations. In Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U. S. 471 (1972),
for example, we held some amount of process was due an
individual whose parole was revoked, for "the liberty of a
parolee, although indeterminate, includes many of the core
values of unqualified liberty." Id., at 482; see also Board
of Pardons v. Allen, 482 U. S. 369 (1987). We rejected in
Morrissey the suggestion that the State could justify parole
revocation "without some informal procedural guarantees,"
408 U. S., at 483, but "[g]iven the previous conviction and
the proper imposition of conditions," we recognized that "the
State has an overwhelming interest in being able to return
the individual to imprisonment without the burden of a new
adversary criminal trial," ibid. We held the review process
need not include a judicial officer or formal court proceeding,
but could be conducted by a neutral administrative official.
Id., at 486.

While the majority expresses some concern that the regulations place the burden on the alien to show he is no longer
dangerous, that question could be adjudicated in a later case
raising the issue. It should be noted the procedural protection here is real, not illusory; and the criteria for obtaining
release are far from insurmountable. Statistics show that
between February 1999 and mid-November 2000 some 6,200
aliens were provided custody reviews before expiration of
the 90-day removal period, and of those aliens about 3,380

Kennedy, J., dissenting
were released. 65 Fed. Reg. 80285 (2000); Reply Brief forPetitioners in No. 00-38, p. 15. As a result, although the

alien carries the burden to prove detention is no longer justi-fied, there is no showing this is an unreasonable burden.

Like the parolee in Morrissey, who was aware of the con-ditions of his release, the aliens in the instant cases have
notice, constructive or actual, that the INA imposes as a consequence of the commission of certain crimes not only depor-tation but also the possibility of continued detention in cases

where deportation is not immediately feasible. And like theprisoner in

Board of Pardons v. Allen, who sought federalcourt review of the discretionary decision denying him parole eligibility, removable aliens held pending deportation
have a due process liberty right to have the INS conduct the
review procedures in place. See 482 U. S., at 381. Were
the INS, in an arbitrary or categorical manner, to deny an
alien access to the administrative processes in place to review continued detention, habeas jurisdiction would lie to
redress the due process violation caused by the denial of the
mandated procedures under 8 CFR $ 241.4 (2001).

This is not the posture of the instant cases, however. Neither Zadvydas nor Ma argues that the Attorney General has
applied the procedures in an improper manner; they challenge only the Attorney General's authority to detain at all
where removal is no longer foreseeable. The Government
has conceded that habeas jurisdiction is available under 28
U. S. C. $ 2241 to review an alien's challenge to detention following entry of a final order of deportation, Brief for Respondents in No. 99-7791, at 9-10, n. 7; Tr. of Oral Arg. 59,
although it does not detail what the nature of the habeas
review would be. As a result, we need not decide today
whether, and to what extent, a habeas court could review
the Attorney General's determination that a detained alien
continues to be dangerous or a flight risk. Given the undeniable deprivation of liberty caused by the detention, there
might be substantial questions concerning the severity nec533US2 Unit: $U87 [10-21-02 18:35:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN

725Cite as: 533 U. S. 678 (2001)
Kennedy, J., dissenting
essary for there to be a community risk; the adequacy ofjudicial review in specific cases where it is alleged there is

no justification for concluding an alien is dangerous or a flightrisk; and other issues. These matters are not presented to
us here.In all events, if judicial review is to be available, the inquiry required by the majority focuses on the wrong factors.Concepts of flight risk or future dangerousness are manageable legal categories. See, e. g., Kansas v. Hendricks, 521U. S. 346 (1997);

Foucha v. Louisiana, 504 U. S. 71 (1992).The majority instead would have the Judiciary review the

status of repatriation negotiations, which, one would havethought, are the paradigmatic examples of nonjusticiable inquiry. See INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U. S., at 425. Theinquiry would require the Executive Branch to surrender its
primacy in foreign affairs and submit reports to the courtsrespecting its ongoing negotiations in the international
sphere. High officials of the Department of State could becalled on to testify as to the status of these negotiations.
The Court finds this to be a more manageable, more appro-priate role for the Judiciary than to review a single, discrete
case deciding whether there were fair procedures and ade-quate judicial safeguards to determine whether an alien is
dangerous to the community so that long-term detention isjustified. The Court's rule is a serious misconception of the
proper judicial function, and it is not what Congress enacted.For these reasons, the Court should reverse the judgment
of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and affirm thejudgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. I

Tewksbury. Byrd's conviction and sentence were upheld on di-rect appeal, and we denied certiorari. Byrd v. Ohio, 484 U. S.
1037 (1988). In 1988, Byrd filed a petition for state postconvictionrelief. The Ohio courts denied the petition. In 1994, Byrd filed
a petition for writ of habeas corpus in federal court. The DistrictCourt and Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit dismissed the
petition, and we again denied certiorari. Byrd v. Collins, 531U. S. 1082 (2001). Byrd filed another petition for state postconviction relief on April 9, 2001. The trial court and Ohio Courtof Appeals dismissed the petition, and the Ohio Supreme Court
denied review. State v. Byrd, No. 01-1515, Aug. 29, 2001. Byrdthen sought permission to file a second federal habeas petition.
The Court of Appeals denied Byrd's request on September 10,but stayed the execution until September 18, 2001. On September 11, the Court of Appeals issued an order stating that a mem-ber of the court had requested that the en banc court determine
whether to vacate the stay issued the day before. The orderstated that less than a majority of the court voted in favor
of vacating the stay, and "a majority of the active judges havevoted to extend the stay of execution until October 8, 2001."
No. 01-3927 (CA6, Sept. 11, 2001). The State has filed in thisCourt an application to vacate the stay granted by the Court
of Appeals.The Court of Appeals has stayed the execution of John Byrd
without any explanation of a constitutional defect that wouldwarrant the issuance of a stay by a federal court. The only
opinion it has written convincingly concludes that there is nobasis for a stay. The only reason the Court of Appeals has
provided for granting the stay is to give "a panel member . . .additional time to consider the matter." In extending the stay
until October 8, 2001, the court provided no additional justifica-tion. Byrd surmises that the Court of Appeals extended the
stay to October 8 "in order to consider John Byrd's Petition forRehearing En Banc." Response to State's Application Seeking
Lifting of Stay 4. But the Court of Appeals' order does notoffer this as a reason for granting the stay; the order only adds
that "the clerk of the court is directed to file and submit to thecourt any petition offered by a party seeking en banc review of
the decision of the panel." In any event, en banc considerationwould not warrant granting a stay until October 8. As Judge

Batchelder points out in her opinion, under the Antiterrorismand Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, the panel's decision
denying Byrd's successive habeas application is not "permittedto be the subject of a petition for rehearing." No. 01-3927 (CA6,
Sept. 10, 2001), p. 26 (citing 28 U. S. C. $ 2244(b)(3)(E) (1994 ed.,Supp. V)). And even if Byrd could seek en banc review, the
Court of Appeals would be able to rule on the petition wellbefore October 8. Indeed, the Court of Appeals issued the stay
on September 10, and by the very next day the court hadconsidered and rejected a judge's request for en banc reconsideration of the stay order. That leaves the rationale that apanel member needed "additional time to consider the matter."
Of course, however, the panel has already issued its opinion.Seeing no justification for the stay, I would grant the State's
application to vacate the stay. See Bowersox v. Williams, 517U. S. 345 (1996) (per curiam) ("[I]t is `particularly egregious' to
enter a stay absent substantial grounds for relief " (citing Delov. Blair, 509 U. S. 823 (1993) (per curiam)).

OPINION OF INDIVIDUAL JUSTICE

IN CHAMBERS

BROWN et al. v. GILMORE, GOVERNOR OF

VIRGINIA, et al.

on application for injunction
No. 01A194 (01-384). Decided September 12, 2001
The application of Virginia public school students and their parents for an

injunction against enforcement of a Virginia statute requiring public
schools to observe a "minute of silence" each schoolday, pending this
Court's disposition of their petition for certiorari, is denied. Applicants,
who claim that the statute establishes religion in violation of the First
Amendment, have been unsuccessful in their repeated attempts to obtain injunctive relief from both the District Court and the Court of
Appeals and in their attack on the statute's merits. The All Writs Act,
this Court's only authority to issue an injunction against enforcement of
a presumptively valid state statute, is appropriate only if the legal
rights at issue are indisputably clear, Ohio Citizens for Responsible
Energy, Inc. v. NRC, 479 U. S. 1312, 1313, which is not the case here.
Finding that Virginia's statute has a clear secular purpose--namely, to
provide a moment for quiet reflection in the wake of instances of violence in the public schools--the Court of Appeals distinguished the present case from Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U. S. 38, in which this Court struck
down a similar Alabama statute that was conceded to have the purpose
of returning prayer to the public schools. At the very least, the lower
court's finding places some doubt on the question whether Virginia's
statute establishes religion in violation of the First Amendment. Justice Powell stayed a District Court order dissolving a preliminary injunction in Wallace when the plaintiffs there alleged that teachers led
their classes in prayer daily. Here, by contrast, after more than a year
in operation, the minute of silence seems to have meant just that. Also,
that applicants did not make an immediate application to a Justice in
September 2000, after the Court of Appeals denied their request for an
injunction pending appeal, is somewhat inconsistent with the urgency
they now assert.

Ann. $ 22.1-203 (2000), pending this Court's disposition oftheir petition for certiorari which has been filed contemporaneously with this application. The petition for certiorariseeks review of a decision of the Court of Appeals affirming
the constitutionality of $ 22.1-203. See 258 F. 3d 265 (CA42001). For the reasons that follow, I conclude that an injunction should not issue.Applicants are Virginia public school students and their
parents who challenge the constitutionality of a state statute,effective as of July 1, 2000, that requires all of Virginia's
public schools to observe a minute of silence at the start ofeach schoolday. They challenge the statute on its face, contending that it establishes religion in violation of the FirstAmendment. For the past year, applicants have repeatedly
sought temporary and permanent injunctive relief from boththe District Court and the Court of Appeals to enjoin Virginia's enforcement and implementation of this statute. On August 31, 2000, the District Court for the Eastern District ofVirginia held a hearing on applicants' motion for preliminary

injunctive relief in light of the approaching school year.This motion was denied. Applicants then requested that
the District Court enter an injunction pending appeal, whichwas also denied. They then moved in the Court of Appeals
for an injunction pending appeal. This motion was deniedas well.

Applicants have been no more successful on the merits.On October 26, 2000, the District Court granted respondents'
motion for summary judgment and dismissed applicants'challenge in its entirety. Applicants then sought expedited
review in the Court of Appeals, which was denied. On July
24, 2001, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed the

1303Cite as: 533 U. S. 1301 (2001)
Opinion in Chambers
District Court's dismissal of applicants' complaint, as well asits earlier denial of applicants' motion for injunctive relief.

This application to me followed.I note first that applicants are seeking not merely a stay
of a lower court judgment, but an injunction against the en-forcement of a presumptively valid state statute. The All
Writs Act, 28 U. S. C. $ 1651(a), is the only source of this
Court's authority to issue such an injunction. It is estab-lished, and our own rules require, that injunctive relief under

the All Writs Act is to be used " `sparingly and only in themost critical and exigent circumstances.' "

Ohio Citizens
for Responsible Energy, Inc. v. NRC, 479 U. S. 1312, 1313
(1986) (Scalia, J., in chambers) (quoting Fishman v. Schaffer, 429 U. S. 1325, 1326 (1976) (Marshall, J., in chambers)).
Such an injunction is appropriate only if "the legal rights at
issue are `indisputably clear.' " 479 U. S., at 1313 (quoting
Communist Party of Ind. v. Whitcomb, 409 U. S. 1235 (1972)
(Rehnquist, J., in chambers)).

Whatever else may be said about the issues and equities
in this case, the rights of the applicants are not "indisputably
clear." The pros and cons of the applicants' claim on the
merits are fully set forth in the majority and dissenting opinions in the Court of Appeals. Applicants contend that this
case is virtually a replay of Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U. S. 38
(1985), in which we struck down a similar Alabama statute.
But the majority opinion in the Court of Appeals took pains
to distinguish the present case from Wallace. It noted our
statement that the statute at issue there was " `quite different from [a statute] merely protecting every student's right
to engage in voluntary prayer during an appropriate moment
of silence during the schoolday.' " Id., at 59, as quoted in
258 F. 3d, at 279. It further found ample evidence that

$ 22.1-203 had a clear secular purpose, namely, to provide a
moment for quiet reflection in the wake of high-profile instances of violence in our public schools. Id., at 276-277.
This alone may distinguish Wallace, in which Alabama ex533US2IC1H 12-07-01 12:00:51 PAGES IC13PGT
1304 BROWN v. GILMORE

Opinion in Chambers
plicitly conceded that the sole purpose of its moment of si-lence law was to return prayer to the Alabama schools. We

in fact emphasized in Wallace that the Alabama statute "had
no secular purpose." 472 U. S., at 56 (emphasis in original).
At the very least the lower court's finding of a clear secu-lar purpose in this case casts some doubt on the question

whether $ 22.1-203 establishes religion in violation of the
First Amendment. See, e. g., id., at 66 (Powell, J., con-curring) ("[A] straightforward moment-of-silence statute is

unlikely to `advance or inhibit religion' "); id., at 73(O'C

onnor, J., concurring in judgment) ("Even if a statute
specifies that a student may choose to pray silently during a
quiet moment, the State has not thereby encouraged prayer
over other specified alternatives").

Without expressing any view of my own, or attempting to
predict the views of my colleagues as to the ultimate merit
of applicants' First Amendment claim, I can say with some
confidence that their position is less than indisputable.

Applicants point out that Justice Powell stayed the order
of the District Court dissolving a preliminary injunction in
Wallace. See Jaffree v. Board of School Comm'rs of Mobile
Cty., 459 U. S. 1314 (1983) (opinion in chambers). But there
the plaintiffs alleged that "teachers had `on a daily basis' led
their classes in saying certain prayers in unison." Wallace,
supra, at 42. Here, by contrast, after more than a year of
operation, the Virginia statute providing for a minute of silence seems to have meant just that. There is no allegation
that Virginia schoolteachers have used the minute of silence,
or any other occasion, to lead students in collective prayer.
To the contrary, the Court of Appeals noted that between
1976 and 2000 at least 20 local school divisions in Virginia
established a minute of silence in their classrooms, yet there
is no evidence of the practice having ever been used as a
government prayer exercise.

I also note that applicants could have made an immediate
application to a Justice of this Court under 28 U. S. C.

$ 1651(a) in September 2000, after the Court of Appeals de-nied their request for an injunction pending appeal. That

they did not do so is somewhat inconsistent with the urgencythey now assert.

For these reasons, I decline to issue an injunction pendingcertiorari in this case.
