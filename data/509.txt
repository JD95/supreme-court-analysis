RETIREMENT OF JUSTICE WHITE
Supreme Court of the United States

MONDAY, JUNE 28, 1993

Present: Chief Justice Rehnquist, Justice White,
Justice Blackmun, Justice Stevens, Justice O'Connor,
Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy, Justice Souter, and
Justice Thomas.

The Chief Justice said:
As most of you know, our esteeemed colleague, Justice
White, is retiring from this bench and his colleagues have
sent him this letter on this occasion which I will now read.

Supreme Court of the United States,

Chambers of The Chief Justice,

Washington, D. C., June 23, 1993.

Dear Byron:
Your decision to retire from the Court has brought to each
of us a profound sense of sadness. You came here more than
thirty-one years ago, and have played a pivotal part in the
deliberations and decisions of this institution with three different Chief Justices during the administration of eight different Presidents.

You brought to the Court a reputation for excellence in
many fields--scholar-athlete, combat intelligence officer in
the South Pacific during World War II, successful private
lawyer, Deputy Attorney General. Your long service here
has greatly enhanced that reputation, as you have exhibited

ix

509bv$$$ix 03-16-97 18:32:34 PGT * frt
x RETIREMENT OF JUSTICE WHITE
a firm resolve not to be classified in any one doctrinal pigeon-hole. The important opinions which you have authored for

the Court in virtually every field of law with which we dealwill remain as a testament to your years of service here.

Every cloud, they say, has a silver lining; for us the silverlining to your retirement is that you leave in good health,
and plan to remain here in the Washington area, at least forthe time being. You will be missed at our Conferences, but
we will continue to enjoy your friendship which means somuch to each of us.

Affectionately,

William H. Rehnquist
Harry A. Blackmun
John Paul Stevens
Sandra Day O'Connor
Antonin Scalia
Anthony M. Kennedy
David H. Souter
Clarence Thomas

Justice White replied as follows:

Supreme Court of the United States
Chambers of Justice Byron R. White (Retired),

Washington, D. C., June 28, 1993.

Dear Colleagues,
I am grateful for your very generous letter on the occasionof my retirement, which is now upon me. There is no doubt

that I shall miss the Court very much, primarily because Ishall no longer have the pleasure and excitement of working
in a small group of nine Justices, all of whom day after dayand year after year are together dealing with the same issues and cases in an attempt to arrive at satisfactory deci-sions. I have sat with 20 Justices in my time here and have
had great respect for the ability and integrity of each ofthem. I have treasured their friendship. Of course, Jus509bv$$$ix 03-16-97 18:32:34 PGT * frt

xiRETIREMENT OF JUSTICE WHITE
tices differ with one another on all sorts of issues, but wehave not held grudges and have gotten along remarkably

well. That is how it should be.This Court is a very small organization for the freight it
carries, and its work is made possible only by the competentand dedicated service of those who work here. I shall always be grateful to all of them for their willing, friendly andreliable help down through the years.

Since I remain a federal judge and will likely sit on Courtsof Appeals from time to time, it will be necessary for me to
follow the Court's work. No longer will I be able to agreewith or dissent from a Court's opinion. Hence, like any
other Court of Appeals judge, I hope the Court's mandateswill be clear, crisp, and leave those of us below with as little
room as possible for disagreement about their meaning.The Court is a great institution, and I wish it well. It has
been good to me. Cheers,

Byron

CASES ADJUDGED

IN THE

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

AT
OCTOBER TERM, 1992

ZOBREST et al. v. CATALINA FOOTHILLSSCHOOL DISTRICT
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 92-94. Argued February 24, 1993--Decided June 18, 1993
Petitioners, a deaf child and his parents, filed this suit after respondent

school district refused to provide a sign-language interpreter to accompany the child to classes at a Roman Catholic high school. They alleged
that the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and the
Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment required respondent to
provide the interpreter and that the Establishment Clause did not bar
such relief. The District Court granted respondent summary judgment
on the ground that the interpreter would act as a conduit for the child's
religious inculcation, thereby promoting his religious development at
government expense in violation of the Establishment Clause. The
Court of Appeals affirmed.

Held:

1. The prudential rule of avoiding constitutional questions if there is
a nonconstitutional ground for decision is inapplicable here, since respondent did not urge upon the District Court or the Court of Appeals
any of the nonconstitutional grounds it now raises in this Court.
Pp. 6-8.

2. The Establishment Clause does not prevent respondent from
furnishing a disabled child enrolled in a sectarian school with a signlanguage interpreter in order to facilitate his education. Government
programs that neutrally provide benefits to a broad class of citizens
defined without reference to religion are not readily subject to an Establishment Clause challenge just because sectarian institutions may also

Syllabus
receive an attenuated financial benefit. Mueller v. Allen, 463 U. S. 388;
Witters v. Washington Dept. of Services for Blind, 474 U. S. 481. The
same reasoning used in Mueller and Witters applies here. The service
in this case is part of a general government program that distributes
benefits neutrally to any child qualifying as disabled under the IDEA,
without regard to the sectarian-nonsectarian, or public-nonpublic nature
of the school the child attends. By according parents freedom to select
a school of their choice, the statute ensures that a government-paid
interpreter will be present in a sectarian school only as a result of individual parents' private decisions. Since the IDEA creates no financial
incentive for parents to choose a sectarian school, an interpreter's
presence there cannot be attributed to state decisionmaking. The fact
that a public employee will be physically present in a sectarian school
does not by itself make this the same type of aid that was disapproved
in Meek v. Pittenger, 421 U. S. 349, and School Dist. of Grand Rapids
v. Ball, 473 U. S. 373. In those cases, the challenged programs gave
direct grants of government aid--instructional equipment and material,
teachers, and guidance counselors--which relieved sectarian schools of
costs they otherwise would have borne in educating their students.
Here, the child is the primary beneficiary, and the school receives only
an incidental benefit. In addition, an interpreter, unlike a teacher or
guidance counselor, neither adds to nor subtracts from the sectarian
school's environment but merely interprets whatever material is presented to the class as a whole. There is no absolute bar to the placing
of a public employee in a sectarian school. Pp. 8-14.

Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of theCourt.
Petitioner James Zobrest, who has been deaf since birth,asked respondent school district to provide a sign-language

4 ZOBREST v. CATALINA FOOTHILLS SCHOOL DIST.

Opinion of the Court
James Zobrest attended grades one through five in aschool for the deaf, and grades six through eight in a public

school operated by respondent. While he attended publicschool, respondent furnished him with a sign-language interpreter. For religious reasons, James' parents (also petition-ers here) enrolled him for the ninth grade in Salpointe Catholic High School, a sectarian institution.1 When petitionersrequested that respondent supply James with an interpreter
at Salpointe, respondent referred the matter to the countyattorney, who concluded that providing an interpreter on the
school's premises would violate the United States Constitu-tion. App. 10-18. Pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 15-
253(B) (1991), the question next was referred to the Arizonaattorney general, who concurred in the county attorney's
opinion. App. to Pet. for Cert. A-137. Respondent accord-ingly declined to provide the requested interpreter.

Petitioners then instituted this action in the United StatesDistrict Court for the District of Arizona under 20 U. S. C.

$ 1415(e)(4)(A), which grants the district courts jurisdictionover disputes regarding the services due disabled children
under the IDEA.2 Petitioners asserted that the IDEA andthe Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment require
respondent to provide James with an interpreter at Sal-pointe, and that the Establishment Clause does not bar such
relief. The complaint sought a preliminary injunction and"such other and further relief as the Court deems just and
proper." App. 25.3 The District Court denied petitioners'

1 The parties have stipulated: "The two functions of secular education
and advancement of religious values or beliefs are inextricably intertwined throughout the operations of Salpointe." App. 92.

2 The parties agreed that exhaustion of administrative remedies would

be futile here. Id., at 94-95.

3 During the pendency of this litigation, James completed his high school

studies and graduated from Salpointe on May 16, 1992. This case nonetheless presents a continuing controversy, since petitioners seek reimbursement for the cost they incurred in hiring their own interpreter, more
than $7,000 per year. Id., at 65.

Opinion of the Court
request for a preliminary injunction, finding that the provision of an interpreter at Salpointe would likely offend the
Establishment Clause. Id., at 52-53. The court thereafter
granted respondent summary judgment, on the ground that
"[t]he interpreter would act as a conduit for the religious
inculcation of James--thereby, promoting James' religious
development at government expense." App. to Pet. for
Cert. A-35. "That kind of entanglement of church and
state," the District Court concluded, "is not allowed." Ibid.

The Court of Appeals affirmed by a divided vote, 963 F. 2d
1190 (CA9 1992), applying the three-part test announced in
Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602, 613 (1971). It first found
that the IDEA has a clear secular purpose: " `to assist States
and Localities to provide for the education of all handicapped
children.' " 963 F. 2d, at 1193 (quoting 20 U. S. C. $ 1400(c)).4
Turning to the second prong of the Lemon inquiry, though,
the Court of Appeals determined that the IDEA, if applied
as petitioners proposed, would have the primary effect of
advancing religion and thus would run afoul of the Establishment Clause. "By placing its employee in the sectarian
school," the Court of Appeals reasoned, "the government
would create the appearance that it was a `joint sponsor' of
the school's activities." 963 F. 2d, at 1194-1195. This, the
court held, would create the "symbolic union of government
and religion" found impermissible in School Dist. of Grand
Rapids v. Ball, 473 U. S. 373, 392 (1985).5 In contrast, the
dissenting judge argued that "[g]eneral welfare programs
neutrally available to all children," such as the IDEA, pass
constitutional muster, "because their benefits diffuse over
the entire population." 963 F. 2d, at 1199 (opinion of Tang,

4 Respondent now concedes that "the IDEA has an appropriate `secular
purpose.' " Brief for Respondent 16.

5 The Court of Appeals also rejected petitioners' Free Exercise Clause

claim. 963 F. 2d, at 1196-1197. Petitioners have not challenged that part
of the decision below. Pet. for Cert. 10, n. 9.

6 ZOBREST v. CATALINA FOOTHILLS SCHOOL DIST.

Opinion of the Court
J.). We granted certiorari, 506 U. S. 813 (1992), and now
reverse.

Respondent has raised in its brief in opposition to certiorari and in isolated passages in its brief on the merits several
issues unrelated to the Establishment Clause question.6
Respondent first argues that 34 CFR $ 76.532(a)(1) (1992), a
regulation promulgated under the IDEA, precludes it from
using federal funds to provide an interpreter to James at
Salpointe. Brief in Opposition 13.7 In the alternative, respondent claims that even if there is no affirmative bar to the
relief, it is not required by statute or regulation to furnish
interpreters to students at sectarian schools. Brief for Respondent 4, n. 4.8 And respondent adds that providing such

6 Respondent may well have waived these other defenses. For in response to an interrogatory asking why it had refused to provide the requested service, respondent referred only to the putative Establishment
Clause bar. App. 59-60.

7 That regulation prohibits the use of federal funds to pay for "[r]eligious

worship, instruction, or proselytization." 34 CFR $ 76.532(a)(1) (1992).
The United States asserts that the regulation merely implements the Secretary of Education's understanding of (and thus is coextensive with) the
requirements of the Establishment Clause. Brief for United States as
Amicus Curiae 23; see also Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae
in Witters v. Dept. of Services for Blind, O. T. 1985, No. 84-1070, p. 21,
n. 11 ("These regulations are based on the Department's interpretation of
constitutional requirements"). This interpretation seems persuasive to
us. The only authority cited by the Secretary for issuance of the regulation is his general rulemaking power. See 34 CFR $ 76.532 (1992) (citing
20 U. S. C. $$ 1221e-3(a)(1), 2831(a), and 2974(b)). Though the Fourth Circuit placed a different interpretation on $ 76.532 in Goodall v. Stafford
County School Board, 930 F. 2d 363, 369 (holding that the regulation prohibits the provision of an interpreter to a student in a sectarian school),
cert. denied, 502 U. S. 864 (1991), that court did not have the benefit of the
United States' views.

8 In our view, this belated contention is entitled to little, if any, weight

here given respondent's repeated concession that, but for the perceived
federal constitutional bar, it would have willingly provided James with an
interpreter at Salpointe as a matter of local policy. See, e. g., Tr. of
Oral Arg. 31 ("We don't deny that . . . we would have voluntarily done

7Cite as: 509 U. S. 1 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
a service would offend Art. II, $ 12, of the Arizona Constitu-tion. Tr. of Oral Arg. 28.

It is a familiar principle of our jurisprudence that federalcourts will not pass on the constitutionality of an Act of Congress if a construction of the Act is fairly possible by whichthe constitutional question can be avoided. See,

e. g., UnitedStates v. Locke, 471 U. S. 84, 92 (1985), and cases cited

therein. In Locke, a case coming here by appeal under 28U. S. C. $ 1252 (1982 ed.), we said that such an appeal "brings
before this Court not merely the constitutional question de-cided below, but the entire case." 471 U. S., at 92. "The
entire case," we explained, "includes nonconstitutional ques-tions actually decided by the lower court as well as nonconstitutional grounds presented to, but not passed on, by thelower court."

Ibid. Therefore, in that case, we turned"first to the nonconstitutional questions pressed below."

Ibid.Here, in contrast to Locke and other cases applying the
prudential rule of avoiding constitutional questions, onlyFirst Amendment questions were pressed in the Court of
Appeals. In the opening paragraph of its opinion, the Courtof Appeals noted that petitioners' appeal raised only First
Amendment issues:

"The Zobrests appeal the district court's ruling thatprovision of a state-paid sign language interpreter to

James Zobrest while he attends a sectarian high schoolwould violate the Establishment Clause. The Zobrests
also argue that denial of such assistance violates theFree Exercise Clause." 963 F. 2d, at 1191.

Respondent did not urge any statutory grounds for affirm-ance upon the Court of Appeals, and thus the Court of Appeals decided only the federal constitutional claims raised bypetitioners. In the District Court, too, the parties chose to

that. The only concern that came up at the time was the Establishment
Clause concern").

509us1$98H 05-04-97 15:56:39 PAGES OPINPGT
8 ZOBREST v. CATALINA FOOTHILLS SCHOOL DIST.

Opinion of the Court
litigate the case on the federal constitutional issues alone.
"Both parties' motions for summary judgment raised only
federal constitutional issues." Brief for Respondent 4, n. 4.
Accordingly, the District Court's order granting respondent
summary judgment addressed only the Establishment
Clause question. App. to Pet. for Cert. A-35.

Given this posture of the case, we think the prudential
rule of avoiding constitutional questions has no application.
The fact that there may be buried in the record a nonconstitutional ground for decision is not by itself enough to invoke
this rule. See, e. g., Board of Airport Comm'rs of Los
Angeles v. Jews for Jesus, Inc., 482 U. S. 569, 572 (1987).
"Where issues are neither raised before nor considered by
the Court of Appeals, this Court will not ordinarily consider
them." Adickes v. S. H. Kress & Co., 398 U. S. 144, 147,
n. 2 (1970). We therefore turn to the merits of the constitutional claim.

We have never said that "religious institutions are disabled by the First Amendment from participating in publicly
sponsored social welfare programs." Bowen v. Kendrick,
487 U. S. 589, 609 (1988). For if the Establishment Clause
did bar religious groups from receiving general government
benefits, then "a church could not be protected by the police
and fire departments, or have its public sidewalk kept in repair." Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S. 263, 274-275 (1981) (internal quotation marks omitted). Given that a contrary rule
would lead to such absurd results, we have consistently held
that government programs that neutrally provide benefits to
a broad class of citizens defined without reference to religion
are not readily subject to an Establishment Clause challenge
just because sectarian institutions may also receive an attenuated financial benefit. Nowhere have we stated this principle more clearly than in Mueller v. Allen, 463 U. S. 388
(1983), and Witters v. Washington Dept. of Services for
Blind, 474 U. S. 481 (1986), two cases dealing specifically

9Cite as: 509 U. S. 1 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
with government programs offering general educationalassistance.

In Mueller, we rejected an Establishment Clause chal-lenge to a Minnesota law allowing taxpayers to deduct certain educational expenses in computing their state income
tax, even though the vast majority of those deductions (per-haps over 90%) went to parents whose children attended sectarian schools. See 463 U. S., at 401; id., at 405 (Marshall,J., dissenting). Two factors, aside from States' traditionally
broad taxing authority, informed our decision. See Witters,
supra, at 491 (Powell, J., concurring) (discussing Mueller).
We noted that the law "permits all parents--whether their
children attend public school or private--to deduct their children's educational expenses." 463 U. S., at 398 (emphasis in
original). See also Widmar, supra, at 274 ("The provision
of benefits to so broad a spectrum of groups is an important
index of secular effect"); Board of Ed. of Westside Community Schools (Dist. 66) v. Mergens, 496 U. S. 226, 248 (1990)
(plurality opinion) (same). We also pointed out that under
Minnesota's scheme, public funds become available to sectarian schools "only as a result of numerous private choices of
individual parents of school-age children," thus distinguishing Mueller from our other cases involving "the direct transmission of assistance from the State to the schools themselves." 463 U. S., at 399.

Witters was premised on virtually identical reasoning. In
that case, we upheld against an Establishment Clause challenge the State of Washington's extension of vocational assistance, as part of a general state program, to a blind person
studying at a private Christian college to become a pastor,
missionary, or youth director. Looking at the statute as a
whole, we observed that "[a]ny aid provided under Washington's program that ultimately flows to religious institutions
does so only as a result of the genuinely independent and
private choices of aid recipients." 474 U. S., at 487. The
program, we said, "creates no financial incentive for students

10 ZOBREST v. CATALINA FOOTHILLS SCHOOL DIST.

Opinion of the Court
to undertake sectarian education." Id., at 488. We also re-marked that, much like the law in

Mueller, "Washington's
program is `made available generally without regard to thesectarian-nonsectarian, or public-nonpublic nature of the institution benefited.' " Witters, supra, at 487 (quoting Committee for Public Ed. & Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, 413U. S. 756, 782-783, n. 38 (1973)). In light of these factors,

we held that Washington's program--even as applied to astudent who sought state assistance so that he could become
a pastor--would not advance religion in a manner inconsist-ent with the Establishment Clause.

Witters, supra, at 489.
That same reasoning applies with equal force here. The
service at issue in this case is part of a general government
program that distributes benefits neutrally to any child qualifying as "disabled" under the IDEA, without regard to the
"sectarian-nonsectarian, or public-nonpublic nature" of the
school the child attends. By according parents freedom to
select a school of their choice, the statute ensures that a
government-paid interpreter will be present in a sectarian
school only as a result of the private decision of individual
parents. In other words, because the IDEA creates no financial incentive for parents to choose a sectarian school,
an interpreter's presence there cannot be attributed to state
decisionmaking. Viewed against the backdrop of Mueller
and Witters, then, the Court of Appeals erred in its decision.
When the government offers a neutral service on the premises of a sectarian school as part of a general program that
"is in no way skewed towards religion," Witters, supra, at
488, it follows under our prior decisions that provision of
that service does not offend the Establishment Clause. See
Wolman v. Walter, 433 U. S. 229, 244 (1977). Indeed, this is
an even easier case than Mueller and Witters in the sense

that, under the IDEA, no funds traceable to the government
ever find their way into sectarian schools' coffers. The only
indirect economic benefit a sectarian school might receive by
dint of the IDEA is the disabled child's tuition--and that is,

11Cite as: 509 U. S. 1 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
of course, assuming that the school makes a profit on eachstudent; that, without an IDEA interpreter, the child would

have gone to school elsewhere; and that the school, then,would have been unable to fill that child's spot.

Respondent contends, however, that this case differs from
Mueller and Witters, in that petitioners seek to have a publicemployee physically present in a sectarian school to assist

in James' religious education. In light of this distinction,respondent argues that this case more closely resembles
Meek v. Pittenger, 421 U. S. 349 (1975), and School Dist. ofGrand Rapids v. Ball, 473 U. S. 373 (1985). In Meek, we
struck down a statute that, inter alia, provided "massiveaid" to private schools--more than 75% of which were church
related--through a direct loan of teaching material andequipment. 421 U. S., at 364-365. The material and equipment covered by the statute included maps, charts, and taperecorders.

Id., at 355. According to respondent, if the gov-ernment could not place a tape recorder in a sectarian school

in Meek, then it surely cannot place an interpreter in Sal-pointe. The statute in

Meek also authorized state-paid per-sonnel to furnish "auxiliary services"--which included remedial and accelerated instruction and guidance counseling--onthe premises of religious schools. We determined that this
part of the statute offended the First Amendment as well.Id., at 372. Ball similarly involved two public programs
that provided services on private school premises; there,public employees taught classes to students in private school
classrooms.9 473 U. S., at 375. We found that those pro-grams likewise violated the Constitution, relying largely on
Meek. 473 U. S., at 386-389. According to respondent, ifthe government could not provide educational services on
the premises of sectarian schools in Meek and Ball, then itsurely cannot provide James with an interpreter on the
premises of Salpointe.

9 Forty of the forty-one private schools involved in Ball were pervasively sectarian. 473 U. S., at 384-385.

12 ZOBREST v. CATALINA FOOTHILLS SCHOOL DIST.

Opinion of the Court
Respondent's reliance on Meek and Ball is misplaced fortwo reasons. First, the programs in

Meek and Ball--
through direct grants of government aid--relieved sectarianschools of costs they otherwise would have borne in educating their students. See Witters, 474 U. S., at 487 ("[T]he
State may not grant aid to a religious school, whether cashor in kind, where the effect of the aid is `that of a direct

subsidy to the religious school' from the State") (quoting
Ball, supra, at 394). For example, the religious schools in
Meek received teaching material and equipment from theState, relieving them of an otherwise necessary cost of performing their educational function. 421 U. S., at 365-366.
"Substantial aid to the educational function of such schools,"
we explained, "necessarily results in aid to the sectarian
school enterprise as a whole," and therefore brings about
"the direct and substantial advancement of religious activity." Id., at 366. So, too, was the case in Ball: The programs challenged there, which provided teachers in addition
to instructional equipment and material, "in effect subsidize[d] the religious functions of the parochial schools by taking over a substantial portion of their responsibility for
teaching secular subjects." 473 U. S., at 397. "This kind of
direct aid," we determined, "is indistinguishable from the
provision of a direct cash subsidy to the religious school."
Id., at 395. The extension of aid to petitioners, however,
does not amount to "an impermissible `direct subsidy' " of
Salpointe, Witters, supra, at 487, for Salpointe is not relieved
of an expense that it otherwise would have assumed in educating its students. And, as we noted above, any attenuated
financial benefit that parochial schools do ultimately receive
from the IDEA is attributable to "the private choices of individual parents." Mueller, 463 U. S., at 400. Disabled children, not sectarian schools, are the primary beneficiaries of
the IDEA; to the extent sectarian schools benefit at all from
the IDEA, they are only incidental beneficiaries. Thus, the
function of the IDEA is hardly " `to provide desired financial

Opinion of the Court
support for nonpublic, sectarian institutions.' " Witters,
supra, at 488 (quoting Nyquist, supra, at 783).

Second, the task of a sign-language interpreter seems to
us quite different from that of a teacher or guidance counselor. Notwithstanding the Court of Appeals' intimations
to the contrary, see 963 F. 2d, at 1195, the Establishment
Clause lays down no absolute bar to the placing of a public
employee in a sectarian school.10 Such a flat rule, smacking
of antiquated notions of "taint," would indeed exalt form
over substance.11 Nothing in this record suggests that a
sign-language interpreter would do more than accurately interpret whatever material is presented to the class as a
whole. In fact, ethical guidelines require interpreters to
"transmit everything that is said in exactly the same way it
was intended." App. 73. James' parents have chosen of
their own free will to place him in a pervasively sectarian
environment. The sign-language interpreter they have requested will neither add to nor subtract from that environment, and hence the provision of such assistance is not
barred by the Establishment Clause.

The IDEA creates a neutral government program dispensing aid not to schools but to individual handicapped children.
If a handicapped child chooses to enroll in a sectarian school,

10 For instance, in Wolman v. Walter, 433 U. S. 229, 242 (1977), we made
clear that "the provision of health services to all schoolchildren--public
and nonpublic--does not have the primary effect of aiding religion," even
when those services are provided within sectarian schools. We accordingly rejected a First Amendment challenge to the State's providing diagnostic speech and hearing services on sectarian school premises. Id., at
244; see also Meek v. Pittenger, 421 U. S. 349, 371, n. 21 (1975).

11 Indeed, respondent readily admits, as it must, that there would be no

problem under the Establishment Clause if the IDEA funds instead went
directly to James' parents, who, in turn, hired the interpreter themselves.
Brief for Respondent 11 ("If such were the case, then the sign language
interpreter would be the student's employee, not the School District's, and
governmental involvement in the enterprise would end with the disbursement of funds").

Today, the Court unnecessarily addresses an important
constitutional issue, disregarding longstanding principles of
constitutional adjudication. In so doing, the Court holds
that placement in a parochial school classroom of a public

does not violate the Establishment Clause of the First

reach this question and with its disposition on the merits. I

principles regarding the institution of judicial review and
this Court's proper role in our federal system, ibid.

Respondent School District makes two arguments that
could provide grounds for affirmance, rendering consideration of the constitutional question unnecessary. First, respondent maintains that the Individuals with Disabilities
Education Act (IDEA), 20 U. S. C. $ 1400 et seq., does not
require it to furnish James Zobrest with an interpreter at
any private school so long as special education services are
made available at a public school. The United States endorses this interpretation of the statute, explaining that "the
IDEA itself does not establish an individual entitlement to
services for students placed in private schools at their parents' option." Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 13.
And several courts have reached the same conclusion. See,
e. g., Goodall v. Stafford County School Bd., 930 F. 2d 363
(CA4), cert. denied, 502 U. S. 864 (1991); McNair v. Cardimone, 676 F. Supp. 1361 (SD Ohio 1987), aff 'd sub nom. McNair v. Oak Hills Local School Dist., 872 F. 2d 153 (CA6
1989); Work v. McKenzie, 661 F. Supp. 225 (DC 1987). Second, respondent contends that 34 CFR $ 76.532(a)(1) (1992),
a regulation promulgated under the IDEA, which forbids the
use of federal funds to pay for "[r]eligious worship, instruction, or proselytization," prohibits provision of a signlanguage interpreter at a sectarian school. The United
States asserts that this regulation does not preclude the relief petitioners seek, Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 23, but at least one federal court has concluded otherwise. See Goodall, supra. This Court could easily refrain
from deciding the constitutional claim by vacating and remanding the case for consideration of the statutory and regulatory issues. Indeed, the majority's decision does not eliminate the need to resolve these remaining questions. For,
regardless of the Court's views on the Establishment Clause,
petitioners will not obtain what they seek if the federal stat509us1$98H 05-04-97 15:56:40 PAGES OPINPGT

Blackmun, J., dissenting
ute does not require or the federal regulations prohibit pro-vision of a sign-language interpreter in a sectarian school.

1

The majority does not deny the existence of these alterna-tive grounds, nor does it dispute the venerable principle that

constitutional questions should be avoided when there arenonconstitutional grounds for a decision in the case. Instead, in its zeal to address the constitutional question, the
majority casts aside this "time-honored canon of constitu-tional adjudication,"

Spector Motor Service, 323 U. S., at 105,
with the cursory observation that "the prudential rule ofavoiding constitutional questions has no application" in light

of the "posture" of this case, ante, at 8. Because the partieschose not to litigate the federal statutory issues in the District Court and in the Court of Appeals, the majority blithely
proceeds to the merits of their constitutional claim.But the majority's statements are a non sequitur. From

the rule against deciding issues not raised or considered
below, it does not follow that the Court should consider constitutional issues needlessly. The obligation to avoid unnecessary adjudication of constitutional questions does not depend upon the parties' litigation strategy, but rather is a
"self-imposed limitation on the exercise of this Court's jurisdiction [that] has an importance to the institution that transcends the significance of particular controversies." City of
Mesquite v. Aladdin's Castle, Inc., 455 U. S. 283, 294 (1982).
It is a rule whose aim is to protect not parties but the law
and the adjudicatory process. Indeed, just a few days ago,
we expressed concern that "litigants, by agreeing on the
legal issue presented, [could] extract the opinion of a court

1 Respondent also argues that public provision of a sign-language interpreter would violate the Arizona Constitution. Article II, $ 12, of the Arizona Constitution provides: "No public money or property shall be appropriated for or applied to any religious worship, exercise, or instruction,
or to the support of any religious establishment." The Arizona attorney
general concluded that, under this provision, interpreter services could
not be furnished to James. See App. 9.

447 (1993). See United States v. CIO, 335 U. S. 106, 126
(1948) (Frankfurter, J., concurring).That the federal statutory and regulatory issues have

not been properly briefed or argued does not justify theCourt's decision to reach the constitutional claim. The very
posture of this case should have alerted the courts thatthe parties were seeking what amounts to an advisory opinion. After the Arizona attorney general concluded that
provision of a sign-language interpreter would violate the
Federal and State Constitutions, the parties bypassed the
federal statutes and regulations and proceeded directly to
litigate the constitutional issue. Under such circumstances,
the weighty nonconstitutional questions that were left unresolved are hardly to be described as "buried in the record."
Ante, at 8. When federal- and state-law questions similarly
remained open in Wheeler v. Barrera, 417 U. S. 402 (1974),
this Court refused to pass upon the scope or constitutionality
of a federal statute that might have required publicly employed teachers to provide remedial instruction on the premises of sectarian schools. Prudence counsels that the Court
follow a similar practice here by vacating and remanding this
case for consideration of the nonconstitutional questions,
rather than proceeding directly to the merits of the constitutional claim. See Youakim v. Miller, 425 U. S. 231 (1976)

Blackmun, J., dissenting

II
Despite my disagreement with the majority's decision
to reach the constitutional question, its arguments on the
merits deserve a response. Until now, the Court never
has authorized a public employee to participate directly in
religious indoctrination. Yet that is the consequence of
today's decision.

Let us be clear about exactly what is going on here. The
parties have stipulated to the following facts. James Zobrest requested the State to supply him with a sign-language
interpreter at Salpointe High School, a private Roman Catholic school operated by the Carmelite Order of the Catholic
Church. App. 90. Salpointe is a "pervasively religious" institution where "[t]he two functions of secular education and
advancement of religious values or beliefs are inextricably
intertwined." Id., at 92. Salpointe's overriding "objective"
is to "instill a sense of Christian values." Id., at 90. Its
"distinguishing purpose" is "the inculcation in its students of
the faith and morals of the Roman Catholic Church." Religion is a required subject at Salpointe, and Catholic students
are "strongly encouraged" to attend daily Mass each morning. Ibid. Salpointe's teachers must sign a Faculty Employment Agreement which requires them to promote the
relationship among the religious, the academic, and the extracurricular.2 They are encouraged to do so by "assist[ing]
students in experiencing how the presence of God is manifest
in nature, human history, in the struggles for economic and
political justice, and other secular areas of the curriculum."
Id., at 92. The agreement also sets forth detailed rules of

2 The Faculty Employment Agreement provides: " `Religious programs
are of primary importance in Catholic educational institutions. They are
not separate from the academic and extracurricular programs, but are instead interwoven with them and each is believed to promote the other.' "
App. 90-91.

conduct teachers must follow in order to advance the school'sChristian mission.

3

At Salpointe, where the secular and the sectarian are "in-extricably intertwined," governmental assistance to the educational function of the school necessarily entails governmen-tal participation in the school's inculcation of religion. A
state-employed sign-language interpreter would be requiredto communicate the material covered in religion class, the
nominally secular subjects that are taught from a religiousperspective, and the daily Masses at which Salpointe encourages attendance for Catholic students. In an environmentso pervaded by discussions of the divine, the interpreter's
every gesture would be infused with religious significance.Indeed, petitioners willingly concede this point: "That the
interpreter conveys religious messages is a given in thecase." Brief for Petitioners 22. By this concession, petitioners would seem to surrender their constitutional claim.The majority attempts to elude the impact of the record
by offering three reasons why this sort of aid to petitionerssurvives Establishment Clause scrutiny. First, the majority observes that provision of a sign-language interpreter

3 The Faculty Employment Agreement sets forth the following detailed
rules of conduct:

" `1. Teacher shall at all times present a Christian image to the students
by promoting and living the school philosophy stated herein, in the
School's Faculty Handbook, the School Catalog and other published statements of this School. In this role the teacher shall support all aspects of
the School from its religious programs to its academic and social functions.
It is through these areas that a teacher administers to mind, body and
spirit of the young men and women who attend Salpointe Catholic High
School.. . . . .

" `3. The School believes that faithful adherence to its philosophical principles by its teachers is essential to the School's mission and purpose.
Teachers will therefore be expected to assist in the implementation of the
philosophical policies of the School, and to compel proper conduct on the
part of the students in the areas of general behavior, language, dress and
attitude toward the Christian ideal.' " Id., at 91.

occurs as "part of a general government program thatdistributes benefits neutrally to any child qualifying as `disabled' under the IDEA, without regard to the `sectarian-nonsectarian, or public-nonpublic nature' of the school the
child attends." Ante, at 10. Second, the majority finds significant the fact that aid is provided to pupils and their par-ents, rather than directly to sectarian schools. As a result,

" `[a]ny aid . . . that ultimately flows to religious institutionsdoes so only as a result of the genuinely independent and
private choices of aid recipients.' " Ante, at 9, quoting
Witters v. Washington Dept. of Services for Blind, 474 U. S.
481, 487 (1986). And, finally, the majority opines that "the
task of a sign-language interpreter seems to us quite different from that of a teacher or guidance counselor." Ante,
at 13.

But the majority's arguments are unavailing. As to the
first two, even a general welfare program may have specific
applications that are constitutionally forbidden under the Establishment Clause. See Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U. S. 589
(1988) (holding that Adolescent Family Life Act on its face
did not violate the Establishment Clause, but remanding for
examination of the constitutionality of particular applications). For example, a general program granting remedial
assistance to disadvantaged schoolchildren attending public
and private, secular and sectarian schools alike would clearly
offend the Establishment Clause insofar as it authorized the
provision of teachers. See Aguilar v. Felton, 473 U. S. 402,
410 (1985); School Dist. of Grand Rapids v. Ball, 473 U. S.
373, 385 (1985); Meek v. Pittenger, 421 U. S. 349, 371 (1975).
Such a program would not be saved simply because it supplied teachers to secular as well as sectarian schools. Nor
would the fact that teachers were furnished to pupils and
their parents, rather than directly to sectarian schools, immunize such a program from Establishment Clause scrutiny.
See Witters, 474 U. S., at 487 ("Aid may have [unconstitutional] effect even though it takes the form of aid to students

or parents"); Wolman v. Walter, 433 U. S. 229, 250 (1977) (itwould "exalt form over substance if this distinction [between

equipment loaned to the pupil or his parent and equipmentloaned directly to the school] were found to justify a . . .
different" result); Ball, 473 U. S., at 395 (rejecting "fiction
that a . . . program could be saved by masking it as aid toindividual students"). The majority's decision must turn,

then, upon the distinction between a teacher and a sign-language interpreter.

"Although Establishment Clause jurisprudence is charac-terized by few absolutes," at a minimum "the Clause does
absolutely prohibit government-financed or governmentsponsored indoctrination into the beliefs of a particular religious faith." Id., at 385. See Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U. S.,
at 623 (O'Connor, J., concurring) ("[A]ny use of public funds
to promote religious doctrines violates the Establishment
Clause") (emphasis in original); Meek, 421 U. S., at 371 (" `The
State must be certain, given the Religion Clauses, that subsidized teachers do not inculcate religion,' " quoting Lemon
v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602, 619 (1971)); Levitt v. Committee
for Public Ed. & Religious Liberty, 413 U. S. 472, 480 (1973)
("[T]he State is constitutionally compelled to assure that the
state-supported activity is not being used for religious indoctrination"). In keeping with this restriction, our cases consistently have rejected the provision by government of any
resource capable of advancing a school's religious mission.
Although the Court generally has permitted the provision of
"secular and nonideological services unrelated to the primary, religion-oriented educational function of the sectarian
school," Meek, 421 U. S., at 364, it has always proscribed the
provision of benefits that afford even the "opportunity for
the transmission of sectarian views," Wolman, 433 U. S., at
244.

Thus, the Court has upheld the use of public school buses
to transport children to and from school, Everson v. Board
of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U. S. 1 (1947), while striking down the

509us1$98H 05-04-97 15:56:40 PAGES OPINPGT
22 ZOBREST v. CATALINA FOOTHILLS SCHOOL DIST.

Blackmun, J., dissenting
employment of publicly funded buses for field trips controlledby parochial school teachers,

Wolman, 433 U. S., at 254. Similarly, the Court has permitted the provision of secular text-books whose content is immutable and can be ascertained in

advance, Board of Ed. of Central School Dist. No. 1 v. Allen,
392 U. S. 236 (1968), while prohibiting the provision of anyinstructional materials or equipment that could be used to

convey a religious message, such as slide projectors, taperecorders, record players, and the like,

Wolman, 433 U. S.,
at 249. State-paid speech and hearing therapists have beenallowed to administer diagnostic testing on the premises of

parochial schools, id., at 241-242, whereas state-paid remedial teachers and counselors have not been authorized to
offer their services because of the risk that they may inculcate religious beliefs, Meek, 421 U. S., at 371.

These distinctions perhaps are somewhat fine, but " `lines
must be drawn.' " Ball, 473 U. S., at 398 (citation omitted).
And our cases make clear that government crosses the
boundary when it furnishes the medium for communication of a religious message. If petitioners receive the relief
they seek, it is beyond question that a state-employed signlanguage interpreter would serve as the conduit for James'
religious education, thereby assisting Salpointe in its mission
of religious indoctrination. But the Establishment Clause
is violated when a sectarian school enlists "the machinery of
the State to enforce a religious orthodoxy." Lee v. Weisman, 505 U. S. 577, 592 (1992).

Witters, supra, and Mueller v. Allen, 463 U. S. 388 (1983),
are not to the contrary. Those cases dealt with the payment
of cash or a tax deduction, where governmental involvement
ended with the disbursement of funds or lessening of tax.
This case, on the other hand, involves ongoing, daily, and
intimate governmental participation in the teaching and
propagation of religious doctrine. When government dispenses public funds to individuals who employ them to finance private choices, it is difficult to argue that government

is actually endorsing religion. But the graphic symbol ofthe concert of church and state that results when a public

employee or instrumentality mouths a religious message islikely to "enlis[t]--at least in the eyes of impressionable
youngsters--the powers of government to the support ofthe religious denomination operating the school."

Ball, 473U. S., at 385. And the union of church and state in pursuit

of a common enterprise is likely to place the imprimatur ofgovernmental approval upon the favored religion, conveying
a message of exclusion to all those who do not adhere toits tenets.

Moreover, this distinction between the provision of fundsand the provision of a human being is not merely one of form.
It goes to the heart of the principles animating the Estab-lishment Clause. As

amicus Council on Religious Freedompoints out, the provision of a state-paid sign-language interpreter may pose serious problems for the church as well asfor the state. Many sectarian schools impose religiously
based rules of conduct, as Salpointe has in this case. A tra-ditional Hindu school would be likely to instruct its students
and staff to dress modestly, avoiding any display of their bod-ies. And an orthodox Jewish yeshiva might well forbid all
but kosher food upon its premises. To require public em-ployees to obey such rules would impermissibly threaten individual liberty, but to fail to do so might endanger religiousautonomy. For such reasons, it long has been feared that "a
union of government and religion tends to destroy govern-ment and to degrade religion." Engel v. Vitale, 370 U. S.
421, 431 (1962). The Establishment Clause was designed toavert exactly this sort of conflict.

lofty aims if each is left free from the other within its respec-tive sphere." Illinois ex rel. McCollum v. Board of Ed. of

HELLING et al. v. McKINNEY
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 91-1958. Argued January 13, 1993--Decided June 18, 1993
Respondent McKinney, a Nevada state prisoner, filed suit against petitioner prison officials, claiming that his involuntary exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) from his cellmate's and other inmates' cigarettes posed an unreasonable risk to his health, thus subjecting him to
cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment.
A federal magistrate granted petitioners' motion for a directed verdict,
but the Court of Appeals reversed in part, holding that McKinney
should have been permitted to prove that his ETS exposure was sufficient to constitute an unreasonable danger to his future health. It reaffirmed its decision after this Court remanded for further consideration
in light of Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U. S. 294, in which the Court held that
Eighth Amendment claims arising from confinement conditions not formally imposed as a sentence for a crime require proof of a subjective
component, and that where the claim alleges inhumane confinement conditions or failure to attend to a prisoner's medical needs, the standard
for that state of mind is the "deliberate indifference" standard of Estelle
v. Gamble, 429 U. S. 97. The Court of Appeals held that Seiter's subjective component did not vitiate that court's determination that it would
be cruel and unusual punishment to house a prisoner in an environment
exposing him to ETS levels that pose an unreasonable risk of harming
his health--the objective component of McKinney's claim.

Held:

1. It was not improper for the Court of Appeals to decide the question
whether McKinney's claim could be based on possible future effects of
ETS. From its examination of the record, the court was apparently
of the view that the claimed entitlement to a smoke-free environment
subsumed the claim that ETS exposure could endanger one's future, not
just current, health. Pp. 30-31.

2. By alleging that petitioners have, with deliberate indifference, exposed him to ETS levels that pose an unreasonable risk to his future
health, McKinney has stated an Eighth Amendment claim on which relief could be granted. An injunction cannot be denied to inmates who
plainly prove an unsafe, life-threatening condition on the ground that
nothing yet has happened to them. See Hutto v. Finney, 437 U. S. 678,
682. Thus, petitioners' central thesis that only deliberate indifference

to inmates' current serious health problems is actionable is rejected.
Since the Court cannot at this juncture rule that McKinney cannot possibly prove an Eighth Amendment violation based on ETS exposure, it
also would be premature to base a reversal on the Federal Government's
argument that the harm from ETS exposure is speculative, with no risk
sufficiently grave to implicate a serious medical need, and that the exposure is not contrary to current standards of decency. On remand, the
District Court must give McKinney the opportunity to prove his allegations, which will require that he establish both the subjective and objective elements necessary to prove an Eighth Amendment violation.
With respect to the objective factor, he may have difficulty showing that
he is being exposed to unreasonably high ETS levels, since he has been
moved to a new prison and no longer has a cellmate who smokes, and
since a new state prison policy restricts smoking to certain areas and
makes reasonable efforts to respect nonsmokers' wishes with regard to
double bunking. He must also show that the risk of which he complains
is not one that today's society chooses to tolerate. The subjective factor, deliberate indifference, should be determined in light of the prison
authorities' current attitudes and conduct, which, as evidenced by the
new smoking policy, may have changed considerably since the Court
of Appeals' judgment. The inquiry into this factor also would be an
appropriate vehicle to consider arguments regarding the realities of
prison administration. Pp. 31-37.

Opinion of the Court
mental tobacco smoke (ETS) can form the basis of a claimfor relief under the Eighth Amendment.

I
Respondent is serving a sentence of imprisonment in theNevada prison system. At the time that this case arose,

respondent was an inmate in the Nevada State Prison inCarson City, Nevada. Respondent filed a pro se civil rights
complaint in United States District Court under Rev. Stat.$ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, naming as defendants the director
of the prison, the warden, the associate warden, a unit coun-selor, and the manager of the prison store. The complaint,
dated December 18, 1986, alleged that respondent was as-signed to a cell with another inmate who smoked five packs
of cigarettes a day. App. 6. The complaint also stated thatcigarettes were sold to inmates without properly informing
of the health hazards a nonsmoking inmate would encounterby sharing a room with an inmate who smoked, id., at 7-8,
and that certain cigarettes burned continuously, releasingsome type of chemical, id., at 9. Respondent complained
of certain health problems allegedly caused by exposure tocigarette smoke. Respondent sought injunctive relief and
damages for, inter alia, subjecting him to cruel and unusualpunishment by jeopardizing his health.

Id., at 14.The parties consented to a jury trial before a Magistrate.

The Magistrate viewed respondent's suit as presenting twoissues of law: (1) whether respondent had a constitutional
right to be housed in a smoke-free environment, and (2)whether defendants were deliberately indifferent to respondent's serious medical needs. App. to Pet. for Cert. D2-D3.The Magistrate, after citing applicable authority, concluded
that respondent had no constitutional right to be free fromcigarette smoke: While "society may be moving toward an
opinion as to the propriety of non-smoking and a smoke-freeenvironment," society cannot yet completely agree on the
resolution of these issues. Id., at D3, D6. The Magistrate

Opinion of the Court
found that respondent nonetheless could state a claim fordeliberate indifference to serious medical needs if he could

prove the underlying facts, but held that respondent hadfailed to present evidence showing either medical problems
that were traceable to cigarette smoke or deliberate indiffer-ence to them.

Id., at D6-D10. The Magistrate thereforegranted petitioners' motion for a directed verdict and

granted judgment for the defendants. Id., at D10.The Court of Appeals affirmed the Magistrate's grant of
a directed verdict on the issue of deliberate indifference torespondent's immediate medical symptoms. McKinney v.
Anderson, 924 F. 2d 1500, 1512 (CA9 1991). The Court ofAppeals also held that the defendants were immune from
liability for damages since there was at the time no clearlyestablished law imposing liability for exposing prisoners to
ETS.* Although it agreed that respondent did not have aconstitutional right to a smoke-free prison environment, the
court held that respondent had stated a valid cause of actionunder the Eighth Amendment by alleging that he had been
involuntarily exposed to levels of ETS that posed an unrea-sonable risk of harm to his future health. Id., at 1509. In
support of this judgment, the court noticed scientific opinionsupporting respondent's claim that sufficient exposure to
ETS could endanger one's health. Id., at 1505-1507. Thecourt also concluded that society's attitude had evolved to
the point that involuntary exposure to unreasonably danger-ous levels of ETS violated current standards of decency.
Id., at 1508. The court therefore held that the Magistrateerred by directing a verdict without permitting respondent
to prove that his exposure to ETS was sufficient to constitutean unreasonable danger to his future health.

Petitioners sought review in this Court. In the mean-time, this Court had decided

Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U. S. 294(1991), which held that, while the Eighth Amendment applies

Estelle v. Gamble,429 U. S. 97 (1976). We granted certiorari in this case, vacated the judgment below, and remanded the case to theCourt of Appeals for further consideration in light of Seiter.
502 U. S. 903 (1991).On remand, the Court of Appeals noted that Seiter added
an additional subjective element that respondent had toprove to make out an Eighth Amendment claim, but did not
vitiate its determination that it would be cruel and unusualpunishment to house a prisoner in an environment exposing
him to levels of ETS that pose an unreasonable risk of harm-ing his health--the objective component of respondent's
Eighth Amendment claim. McKinney v. Anderson, 959F. 2d 853, 854 (CA9 1992). The Court of Appeals therefore
reinstated its previous judgment and remanded for proceed-ings consistent with its prior opinion and with Seiter. 959
F. 2d, at 854.Petitioners again sought review in this Court, contending
that the decision below was in conflict with the en banc deci-sion of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in Clemmons v. Bohannon, 956 F. 2d 1523 (1992). We granted cer-tiorari. 505 U. S. 1218 (1992). We affirm.

Court of Appeals to decide the question at all. Pet. for Cert.25-29. Petitioners claim that respondent's complaint rested
only on the alleged current effects of exposure to cigarette

smoke, not on the possible future effects; that the issuesframed for trial were likewise devoid of such an issue; and

that such a claim was not presented, briefed, or argued onappeal and that the Court of Appeals erred in sua sponte
deciding it. Ibid. Brief for Petitioners 46-49. The Courtof Appeals was apparently of the view that the claimed entitlement to a smoke-free environment subsumed the claimthat exposure to ETS could endanger one's future health.
From its examination of the record, the court stated that"[b]oth before and during trial, McKinney sought to litigate
the degree of his exposure to ETS and the actual and poten-tial effects of such exposure on his health," 924 F. 2d, at 1503;
stated that the Magistrate had excluded evidence relating tothe potential health effects of exposure to ETS; and noted
that two of the issues on appeal addressed whether the Mag-istrate erred in holding as a matter of law that compelled
exposure to ETS does not violate a prisoner's rights andwhether it was error to refuse to appoint an expert witness
to testify about the health effects of such exposure. Whilethe record is ambiguous and the Court of Appeals might well
have affirmed the Magistrate, we hesitate to dispose of thiscase on the basis that the court misread the record before
it. We passed over the same claim when we vacated thejudgment below and remanded when the case was first before us, Pet. for Cert., O. T. 1991, No. 91-269, pp. 23-26, andthe primary question on which certiorari was granted, and
the question to which petitioners have devoted the bulk oftheir briefing and argument, is whether the court below
erred in holding that McKinney had stated an EighthAmendment claim on which relief could be granted by alleging that his compelled exposure to ETS poses an unreason-able risk to his health.

III
It is undisputed that the treatment a prisoner receives inprison and the conditions under which he is confined are subject to scrutiny under the Eighth Amendment. As we said

32 HELLING v. McKINNEY

Opinion of the Court
in DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dept. of Social Services,489 U. S. 189, 199-200 (1989):

"[W]hen the State takes a person into its custody andholds him there against his will, the Constitution imposes upon it a corresponding duty to assume some re-sponsibility for his safety and general well being. . . .
The rationale for this principle is simple enough: whenthe State by the affirmative exercise of its power so restrains an individual's liberty that it renders him unableto care for himself, and at the same time fails to provide
for his basic human needs--e. g., food, clothing, shelter,
medical care, and reasonable safety--it transgresses thesubstantive limits on state action set by the Eighth

Amendment . . . ."
Contemporary standards of decency require no less. Estelle
v. Gamble, 429 U. S., at 103-104. In Estelle, we concludedthat although accidental or inadvertent failure to provide adequate medical care to a prisoner would not violate theEighth Amendment, "deliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners" violates the Amendment because itconstitutes the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain contrary to contemporary standards of decency. Id., at 104.
Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U. S. 294 (1991), later held that a claim
that the conditions of a prisoner's confinement violate the
Eighth Amendment requires an inquiry into the prison offi-cials' state of mind. " `Whether one characterizes the treatment received by [the prisoner] as inhuman conditions ofconfinement, failure to attend to his medical needs, or a
combination of both, it is appropriate to apply the "deliberate
indifference" standard articulated in Estelle.' " Id., at 303.

Petitioners are well aware of these decisions, but they
earnestly submit that unless McKinney can prove that he
is currently suffering serious medical problems caused by
exposure to ETS, there can be no violation of the Eighth
Amendment. That Amendment, it is urged, does not pro509us1$99D 05-05-97 17:02:34 PAGES OPINPGT

33Cite as: 509 U. S. 25 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
tect against prison conditions that merely threaten to causehealth problems in the future, no matter how grave and imminent the threat.We have great difficulty agreeing that prison authorities
may not be deliberately indifferent to an inmate's current
health problems but may ignore a condition of confinementthat is sure or very likely to cause serious illness and needless suffering the next week or month or year. In Hutto v.
Finney, 437 U. S. 678, 682 (1978), we noted that inmates in
punitive isolation were crowded into cells and that some ofthem had infectious maladies such as hepatitis and venereal

disease. This was one of the prison conditions for which the
Eighth Amendment required a remedy, even though it was
not alleged that the likely harm would occur immediately
and even though the possible infection might not affect all of
those exposed. We would think that a prison inmate also
could successfully complain about demonstrably unsafe
drinking water without waiting for an attack of dysentery.
Nor can we hold that prison officials may be deliberately indifferent to the exposure of inmates to a serious, communicable disease on the ground that the complaining inmate shows
no serious current symptoms.

That the Eighth Amendment protects against future harm
to inmates is not a novel proposition. The Amendment, as
we have said, requires that inmates be furnished with the
basic human needs, one of which is "reasonable safety."
DeShaney, supra, at 200. It is "cruel and unusual punishment to hold convicted criminals in unsafe conditions."
Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U. S. 307, 315-316 (1982). It
would be odd to deny an injunction to inmates who plainly
proved an unsafe, life-threatening condition in their prison
on the ground that nothing yet had happened to them. The
Courts of Appeals have plainly recognized that a remedy for
unsafe conditions need not await a tragic event. Two of
them were cited with approval in Rhodes v. Chapman, 452
U. S. 337, 352, n. 17 (1981). Gates v. Collier, 501 F. 2d 1291

34 HELLING v. McKINNEY

Opinion of the Court
(CA5 1974), held that inmates were entitled to relief underthe Eighth Amendment when they proved threats to personal safety from exposed electrical wiring, deficient fire-fighting measures, and the mingling of inmates with serious
contagious diseases with other prison inmates. Ramos v.
Lamm, 639 F. 2d 559, 572 (CA10 1980), stated that a prisonerneed not wait until he is actually assaulted before obtaining

relief. As respondent points out, the Court of Appeals casesto the effect that the Eighth Amendment protects against
sufficiently imminent dangers as well as current unnecessaryand wanton infliction of pain and suffering are legion. See
Brief for Respondent 24-27. We thus reject petitioners'
central thesis that only deliberate indifference to current serious health problems of inmates is actionable under the
Eighth Amendment.

The United States as amicus curiae supporting petitioners does not contend that the Amendment permits "even
those conditions of confinement that truly pose a significant
risk of proximate and substantial harm to an inmate, so long
as the injury has not yet occurred and the inmate does not
yet suffer from its effects." Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 19. Hutto v. Finney, the United States observes, teaches as much. The Government recognizes that
there may be situations in which exposure to toxic or similar
substances would "present a risk of sufficient likelihood or
magnitude--and in which there is a sufficiently broad consensus that exposure of anyone to the substance should
therefore be prevented--that" the Amendment's protection
would be available even though the effects of exposure might
not be manifested for some time. Brief for United States as
Amicus Curiae 19. But the United States submits that the
harm to any particular individual from exposure to ETS is
speculative, that the risk is not sufficiently grave to implicate
a " `serious medical nee[d],' " and that exposure to ETS is not
contrary to current standards of decency. Id., at 20-22. It
would be premature for us, however, as a matter of law to

Opinion of the Court
reverse the Court of Appeals on the basis suggested by theUnited States. The Court of Appeals has ruled that McKinney's claim is that the level of ETS to which he has beeninvoluntarily exposed is such that his future health is unreasonably endangered and has remanded to permit McKinneyto attempt to prove his case. In the course of such proof,
he must also establish that it is contrary to current standardsof decency for anyone to be so exposed against his will and
that prison officials are deliberately indifferent to his plight.We cannot rule at this juncture that it will be impossible
for McKinney, on remand, to prove an Eighth Amendmentviolation based on exposure to ETS.

IV
We affirm the holding of the Court of Appeals that McKin-ney states a cause of action under the Eighth Amendment by

alleging that petitioners have, with deliberate indifference,exposed him to levels of ETS that pose an unreasonable risk
of serious damage to his future health. We also affirm theremand to the District Court to provide an opportunity for
McKinney to prove his allegations, which will require him toprove both the subjective and objective elements necessary
to prove an Eighth Amendment violation. The DistrictCourt will have the usual authority to control the order of
proof, and if there is a failure of proof on the first elementthat it chooses to consider, it would not be an abuse of discretion to give judgment for petitioners without taking furtherevidence. McKinney must also prove that he is entitled to
the remedy of an injunction.With respect to the objective factor, McKinney must show
that he himself is being exposed to unreasonably high levelsof ETS. Plainly relevant to this determination is the fact
that McKinney has been moved from Carson City to ElyState Prison and is no longer the cellmate of a five-pack-aday smoker. While he is subject to being moved back toCarson City and to being placed again in a cell with a heavy

36 HELLING v. McKINNEY

Opinion of the Court
smoker, the fact is that at present he is not so exposed.Moreover, the director of the Nevada State Prisons adopted

a formal smoking policy on January 10, 1992. This policyrestricts smoking in "program, food preparation/serving, recreational and medical areas" to specifically designated areas.
It further provides that wardens may, contingent on spaceavailability, designate nonsmoking areas in dormitory settings, and that institutional classification committees maymake reasonable efforts to respect the wishes of nonsmokers
where double bunking obtains. See App. to Brief for UnitedStates as

Amicus Curiae A1-A2. It is possible that the
new policy will be administered in a way that will minimize
the risk to McKinney and make it impossible for him to prove
that he will be exposed to unreasonable risk with respect to
his future health or that he is now entitled to an injunction.

Also with respect to the objective factor, determining
whether McKinney's conditions of confinement violate the
Eighth Amendment requires more than a scientific and statistical inquiry into the seriousness of the potential harm and
the likelihood that such injury to health will actually be
caused by exposure to ETS. It also requires a court to assess whether society considers the risk that the prisoner
complains of to be so grave that it violates contemporary
standards of decency to expose anyone unwillingly to such a
risk. In other words, the prisoner must show that the risk
of which he complains is not one that today's society chooses
to tolerate.

On remand, the subjective factor, deliberate indifference,
should be determined in light of the prison authorities' current attitudes and conduct, which may have changed considerably since the judgment of the Court of Appeals. Indeed,
the adoption of the smoking policy mentioned above will bear
heavily on the inquiry into deliberate indifference. In this
respect we note that at oral argument McKinney's counsel
was of the view that depending on how the new policy was
administered, it could be very difficult to demonstrate that

prison authorities are ignoring the possible dangers posedby exposure to ETS. Tr. of Oral Arg. 33. The inquiry into

this factor also would be an appropriate vehicle to considerarguments regarding the realities of prison administration.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed, and thecase is remanded for further proceedings consistent with

this opinion.

So ordered.

Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Scalia joins,dissenting.

Last Term, in Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U. S. 1 (1992),the Court held that the Eighth Amendment prohibits the use
of force that causes a prisoner only minor injuries. Believ-ing that the Court had expanded the Eighth Amendment
"beyond all bounds of history and precedent," id., at 28, Idissented. Today the Court expands the Eighth Amendment in yet another direction, holding that it applies to aprisoner's mere

risk of injury. Because I find this holdingno more acceptable than the Court's holding in

Hudson, Iagain dissent.

I
The Eighth Amendment provides that "[e]xcessive bailshall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel

and unusual punishments inflicted." The Court holds that aprisoner states a cause of action under the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause by alleging that prison officials,with deliberate indifference, have exposed him to an unreasonable risk of harm. This decision, like every other "condi-tions of confinement" case since

Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U. S.97 (1976), rests on the premise that deprivations suffered by

a prisoner constitute "punishmen[t]" for Eighth Amendmentpurposes, even when the deprivations have not been inflicted
as part of a criminal sentence. As I suggested in Hudson,

509us1$99D 05-05-97 17:02:35 PAGES OPINPGT
38 HELLING v. McKINNEY

Thomas, J., dissenting
see 503 U. S., at 18-20, I have serious doubts about thispremise.

A
At the time the Eighth Amendment was ratified, the word"punishment" referred to the penalty imposed for the commission of a crime. See 2 T. Cunningham, A New and Com-plete Law-Dictionary (1771) ("the penalty of transgressing
the laws"); 2 T. Sheridan, A General Dictionary of the Eng-lish Language (1780) ("[a]ny infliction imposed in vengeance
of a crime"); J. Walker, A Critical Pronouncing Dictionary(1791) (same); 4 G. Jacob, The Law-Dictionary: Explaining
the Rise, Progress, and Present State, of the English Law343 (1811) ("[t]he penalty for transgressing the Law"); 2 N.
Webster, American Dictionary of the English Language(1828) ("[a]ny pain or suffering inflicted on a person for a
crime or offense"). That is also the primary definition of theword today. As a legal term of art, "punishment" has always meant a "fine, penalty, or confinement inflicted upon aperson by the authority of the law and the judgment and
sentence of a court, for some crime or offense committed byhim." Black's Law Dictionary 1234 (6th ed. 1990). And
this understanding of the word, of course, does not encom-pass a prisoner's injuries that bear no relation to his
sentence.Nor, as far as I know, is there any historical evidence indicating that the Framers and ratifiers of the Eighth Amend-ment had anything other than this common understanding of
"punishment" in mind. There is "no doubt" that the EnglishDeclaration of Rights of 1689 is the "antecedent of our constitutional text," Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U. S. 957, 966
(1991) (opinion of Scalia, J.), and "the best historical evi-dence" suggests that the "cruell and unusuall Punishments"

provision of the Declaration of Rights was a response to sentencing abuses of the King's Bench, id., at 968. Just as
there was no suggestion in English constitutional history

Thomas, J., dissenting
that harsh prison conditions might constitute cruel and unusual (or otherwise illegal) "punishment," the debates surrounding the framing and ratification of our own Constitution
and Bill of Rights were silent regarding this possibility. See
2 J. Elliot, Debates on the Federal Constitution 111 (2d ed.
1854) (Congress should be prevented from "inventing the
most cruel and unheard-of punishments, and annexing them
to crimes") (emphasis added); 1 Annals of Cong. 753-754
(1789). The same can be said of the early commentaries.
See 3 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the
United States 750-751 (1833); T. Cooley, Constitutional Limitations 694 (8th ed. 1927).

To the extent that there is any affirmative historical evidence as to whether injuries sustained in prison might constitute "punishment" for Eighth Amendment purposes, that
evidence is consistent with the ordinary meaning of the
word. As of 1792, the Delaware Constitution's analogue of
the Eighth Amendment provided that "Excessive bail shall
not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel or
unusual punishments inflicted; and in the construction of
jails a proper regard shall be had to the health of prisoners."
Del. Declaration of Rights, Art. I, $ XI (1792) (emphasis
added). This provision suggests that when members of the
founding generation wished to make prison conditions a matter of constitutional guarantee, they knew how to do so.

Judicial interpretations of the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause were, until quite recently, consistent with its
text and history. As I observed in Hudson, see 503 U. S.,
at 19, lower courts routinely rejected "conditions of confinement" claims well into this century, see, e. g., Negrich v.
Hohn, 246 F. Supp. 173, 176 (WD Pa. 1965) ("Punishment is
a penalty inflicted by a judicial tribunal in accordance with
law in retribution for criminal conduct"), and this Court did
not so much as intimate that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause might reach prison conditions for the first 185

years of the provision's existence. It was not until the1960's that lower courts began applying the Eighth Amendment to prison deprivations, see, e. g., Wright v. McMann,387 F. 2d 519, 525-526 (CA2 1967); Bethea v. Crouse,
417 F. 2d 504, 507-508 (CA10 1969), and it was not until1976, in

Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U. S. 97, that this Court firstdid so.

Thus, although the evidence is not overwhelming, I believethat the text and history of the Eighth Amendment, together
with the decisions interpreting it, support the view thatjudges or juries--but not jailers--impose "punishment." At
a minimum, I believe that the original meaning of "punish-ment," the silence in the historical record, and the 185 years
of uniform precedent shift the burden of persuasion to thosewho would apply the Eighth Amendment to prison conditions. In my view, that burden has not yet been discharged.It was certainly not discharged in

Estelle v. Gamble.

B
The inmate in Estelle claimed that inadequate treatmentof a back injury constituted cruel and unusual punishment.

The Court ultimately rejected this claim, but not before rec-ognizing that "deliberate indifference to serious medical
needs of prisoners" violates the Eighth Amendment. Id.,at 104. In essence, however, this extension of the Eighth
Amendment to prison conditions rested on little more thanan ipse dixit. There was no analysis of the text of the
Eighth Amendment in Estelle, and the Court's discussion ofthe provision's history consisted of the following single sentence: "It suffices to note that the primary concern of thedrafters was to proscribe `torture[s]' and other `barbar[ous]'
methods of punishment." Id., at 102. And although theCourt purported to rely upon "our decisions interpreting"
the Eighth Amendment, ibid., none of the six cases it cited,see

id., at 102-103, held that the Eighth Amendment appliesto prison deprivations--or, for that matter, even addressed

a claim that it does. All of those cases involved challenges
to a sentence imposed for a criminal offense.1

The only authorities cited in Estelle that supported the
Court's extension of the Eighth Amendment to prison deprivations were lower court decisions (virtually all of which had
been decided within the previous 10 years), see id., at 102,
104-105, nn. 10-12, 106, n. 14, and the only one of those decisions upon which the Court placed any substantial reliance
was Jackson v. Bishop, 404 F. 2d 571 (CA8 1968). But Jackson, like Estelle itself, simply asserted that the Eighth
Amendment applies to prison deprivations; the Eighth Circuit's discussion of the problem consisted of a two-sentence
paragraph in which the court was content to state the opposing view and then reject it: "Neither do we wish to draw . . .
any meaningful distinction between punishment by way of
sentence statutorily prescribed and punishment imposed for
prison disciplinary purposes. It seems to us that the Eighth
Amendment's proscription has application to both." 404
F. 2d, at 580-581. As in Estelle, there was no analysis of
the text or history of the Cruel and Unusual Punishments
Clause.2

1 Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153 (1976), was a death penalty case, as
were Wilkerson v. Utah, 99 U. S. 130 (1879), In re Kemmler, 136 U. S. 436
(1890), and Louisiana ex rel. Francis v. Resweber, 329 U. S. 459 (1947).
Weems v. United States, 217 U. S. 349 (1910), involved a challenge to a
sentence imposed for the crime of falsifying a document, and Trop v.
Dulles, 356 U. S. 86 (1958), presented the question whether revocation of
citizenship amounts to cruel and unusual punishment when imposed upon
those who desert the military.

2 Jackson may in any event be distinguishable. That case involved an

Eighth Amendment challenge to the use of the "strap" as a disciplinary
measure in Arkansas prisons, and it is at least arguable that whipping a
prisoner who has violated a prison rule is sufficiently analogous to imposing a sentence for violation of a criminal law that the Eighth Amendment
is implicated. But disciplinary measures for violating prison rules are
quite different from inadequate medical care or housing a prisoner with a
heavy smoker.

42 HELLING v. McKINNEY

Thomas, J., dissenting

II
To state a claim under the Cruel and Unusual PunishmentsClause, a party must prove not only that the challenged conduct was both cruel and unusual, but also that it constitutes
punishment. The text and history of the Eighth Amend-ment, together with pre-Estelle precedent, raise substantial

doubts in my mind that the Eighth Amendment proscribes aprison deprivation that is not inflicted as part of a sentence.
And Estelle itself has not dispelled these doubts. Were theissue squarely presented, therefore, I might vote to overrule
Estelle. I need not make that decision today, however, be-cause this case is not a straightforward application of

Estelle.It is, instead, an extension.

In Hudson, the Court extended Estelle to cases in whichthe prisoner has suffered only minor injuries; here, it extends Estelle to cases in which there has been no injury atall.

3 Because I seriously doubt that Estelle was correctly

decided, I decline to join the Court's holding. Stare decisismay call for hesitation in overruling a dubious precedent,

but it does not demand that such a precedent be expandedto its outer limits. I would draw the line at actual, serious
injuries and reject the claim that exposure to the risk ofinjury can violate the Eighth Amendment.

Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment of the Courtof Appeals.

3 None of our prior decisions, including the three that are cited by the
Court today, see ante, at 33, held that the mere threat of injury can violate
the Eighth Amendment. In Hutto v. Finney, 437 U. S. 678 (1978), the
defendants challenged the district court's remedy; they did not dispute the
court's conclusion that "conditions in [the] prisons . . . constituted cruel
and unusual punishment." Id., at 685. Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U. S.
307 (1982), involved the liberty interests (under the Due Process Clause)
of an involuntarily committed mentally retarded person, and DeShaney v.
Winnebago County Dept. of Social Services, 489 U. S. 189 (1989), involved
the due process rights of a child who had been beaten by his father in
the home.

RENO, ATTORNEY GENERAL, et al. v. CATHOLICSOCIAL SERVICES, INC.,

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 91-1826. Argued January 11, 1993--Decided June 18, 1993
Under the alien legalization program created by Title II of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, an alien unlawfully present in the
United States who sought permission to reside permanently had to
apply first for temporary resident status by establishing, inter alia, that
he had resided continuously in this country in an unlawful status and
had been physically present here continuously for specified periods.
After the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) issued regulations construing particular aspects of, respectively, the "continuous
physical presence" and "continuous unlawful residence" requirements,
two separate class actions were brought, each challenging one of the
regulations on behalf of aliens whom it would render ineligible for legalization. In each instance, the District Court struck down the challenged regulation as inconsistent with the Reform Act and issued a
remedial order directing the INS to accept legalization applications
beyond the statutory deadline. The Court of Appeals, among other rulings, consolidated the INS's appeals from the remedial orders, rejected
the INS's argument that the Reform Act's restrictive judicial review
provisions barred district court jurisdiction in each case, and affirmed
the District Courts' judgments.

Held: The record is insufficient to allow this Court to decide all issues

necessary to determine whether the District Courts had jurisdiction.
Pp. 53-67.

(a) The Reform Act's exclusive review scheme--which applies to "determination[s] respecting an application for adjustment of status," 8
U. S. C. $ 1255a(f)(1), and specifies that "a denial" of such adjustment
may be judicially scrutinized "only in the . . . review of an order of
deportation" in the courts of appeals, $ 1255a(f)(4)(A)--does not preclude district court jurisdiction over an action which, in challenging the
legality of an INS regulation, does not refer to or rely on the denial
of any individual application. The statutory language delimiting the
jurisdictional bar refers only to review of such an individual denial. McNary v. Haitian Refugee Center, Inc., 498 U. S. 479, 494. Pp. 53-56.

(b) However, the promulgation of the challenged regulations did not
itself affect each of the plaintiff class members concretely enough to

509us1100I 05-09-97 08:11:11 PAGES OPINPGT
44 RENO v. CATHOLIC SOCIAL SERVICES, INC.

Syllabus
render his claim "ripe" for judicial review, as is required by, e. g., Abbott
Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U. S. 136, 148-149. The regulations impose no penalties for violating any newly imposed restriction, but limit
access to a benefit created by the Reform Act but not automatically
bestowed on eligible aliens. Rather, the Act requires each alien desiring the benefit to take further affirmative steps, and to satisfy criteria
beyond those addressed by the disputed regulations. It delegates to
the INS the task of determining on a case-by-case basis whether each
applicant has met all of the Act's conditions, not merely those interpreted by the regulations in question. In these circumstances, a class
member's claim would ripen only once he took the affirmative steps that
he could take before the INS blocked his path by applying a regulation
to him. Ordinarily, that barrier would appear when the INS formally
denied the alien's application on the ground that a regulation rendered
him ineligible for legalization. But a plaintiff who sought to rely on
such a denial to satisfy the ripeness requirement would then still find
himself at least temporarily barred by the Reform Act's exclusive review provisions, since he would be seeking "judicial review of a determination respecting an application" under $ 1255a(f)(1). Pp. 56-61.

(c) Nevertheless, the INS's "front-desking" policy--which directs employees to reject applications at a Legalization Office's front desk if the
applicant is statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status--may well
have left some of the plaintiffs with ripe claims that are outside the
scope of $ 1255a(f)(1). A front-desked class member whose application
was rejected because one of the regulations at issue rendered him ineligible for legalization would have felt the regulation's effects in a particularly concrete manner, for his application would have been blocked then
and there; his challenge to the regulation should not fail for lack of
ripeness. Front-desking would also have the untoward consequence for
jurisdictional purposes of effectively excluding such an applicant from
access even to the Reform Act's limited administrative and judicial review procedures, since he would have no formal denial to appeal administratively nor any opportunity to build an administrative record on
which judicial review might be based. Absent clear and convincing evidence of a congressional intent to preclude judicial review entirely, it
must be presumed that front-desked applicants may obtain district
court review of the regulations in these circumstances. See McNary,
supra, at 496-497. However, as there is also no evidence that particular class members were actually subjected to front-desking, the jurisdictional issue cannot be resolved on the records below. Because, as the
cases have been presented to this Court, only those class members (if
any) who were front-desked have ripe claims over which the District
Courts should exercise jurisdiction, the cases must be remanded for

I
On November 6, 1986, the President signed the Immigra-tion Reform and Control Act of 1986, Pub. L. 99-603, 100

Stat. 3359, Title II of which established a scheme underwhich certain aliens unlawfully present in the United States
could apply, first, for the status of a temporary resident andthen, after a 1-year wait, for permission to reside permanently.1 An applicant for temporary resident status musthave resided continuously in the United States in an unlawful status since at least January 1, 1982, 8 U. S. C.$ 1255a(a)(2)(A); must have been physically present in the
United States continuously since November 6, 1986, the datethe Reform Act was enacted, $ 1255a(a)(3)(A); and must have
been otherwise admissible as an immigrant, $ 1255a(a)(4).The applicant must also have applied during the 12-month
period beginning on May 5, 1987. $ 1255a(a)(1).2

1 The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 amended the Immigration and Nationality Act, 66 Stat. 163, as amended, 8 U. S. C. $ 1101 et
seq. Section 201(a)(1) of the Reform Act created the alien legalization
program at issue in this case by adding $ 245A to the Immigration and
Nationality Act, codified at 8 U. S. C. $ 1255a. For the sake of convenience, we will refer to the sections of the Act as they have been codified.

2 The Reform Act requires the 12-month period to "begi[n] on a date (not

later than 180 days after November 6, 1986) designated by the Attorney
General." 8 U. S. C. $ 1255a(a)(1)(A). The Attorney General set the period to begin on May 5, 1987, the latest date the Reform Act authorized
him to designate. See 8 CFR $ 245a.2(a)(1) (1992). A separate provision
of the Act requires "[a]n alien who, at any time during the first 11 months
of the 12-month period . . . , is the subject of an order to show cause [why
he should not be deported]" to "make application . . . not later than the
end of the 30-day period beginning either on the first day of such 12-month
period or on the date of the issuance of such order, whichever day is

Opinion of the Court
The two separate suits joined before us challenge regu-lations addressing, respectively, the first two of these four

requirements. The first, Reno v. Catholic Social Services,Inc. (CSS), et al., focuses on an INS interpretation of 8
U. S. C. $ 1255a(a)(3), the Reform Act's requirement that ap-plicants for temporary residence prove "continuous physical
presence" in the United States since November 6, 1986. Tomitigate this requirement, the Reform Act provides that
"brief, casual, and innocent absences from the United States"will not break the required continuity. $ 1255a(a)(3)(B). In
a telex sent to its regional offices on November 14, 1986,however, the INS treated the exception narrowly, stating
that it would consider an absence "brief, casual, and inno-cent" only if the alien had obtained INS permission, known
as "advance parole," before leaving the United States; alienswho left without it would be "ineligible for legalization."
App. 186. The INS later softened this limitation somewhatby regulations issued on May 1, 1987, forgiving a failure
to get advance parole for absences between November 6,1986, and May 1, 1987. But the later regulation confirmed
that any absences without advance parole on or after May 1,1987, would not be considered "brief, casual, and innocent"
and would therefore be taken to have broken the requiredcontinuity. See 8 CFR $ 245a.1(g) (1992) ("Brief, casual, and
innocent means a departure authorized by [the INS] (ad-vance parole) subsequent to May 1, 1987 of not more than
thirty (30) days for legitimate emergency or humanitarianpurposes").

The CSS plaintiffs challenged the advance parole regula-tion as an impermissible construction of the Reform Act.
After certifying the case as a class action, the District Courteventually defined a class comprising "persons prima facie
eligible for legalization under [8 U. S. C. $ 1255a] who delater." $ 1255a(a)(1)(B); see $ 1255a(e)(1) (providing further relief for certain aliens "apprehended before the beginning of the application period").

3 The CSS lawsuit originally challenged various aspects of the INS's
administration of both the legalization program created by Title II of the
Reform Act and the "Special Agricultural Workers" (SAW) legalization
program created by Part A of Title III of the Reform Act (codified at 8
U. S. C. $ 1160). The challenge to the SAW program eventually took its
own procedural course, and was resolved by a district court order that
neither party appealed. No. Civ. S-86-1343 LKK (ED Cal., Aug. 11, 1988)
(App. 3, Record, Doc. No. 188). With respect to the Title II challenge,
the District Court originally certified a broad class comprising all persons
believed by the Government to be deportable aliens who could establish a
prima facie claim for adjustment of status to temporary resident under 8
U. S. C. $ 1255a. No. Civ. S-86-1343 LKK (ED Cal., Nov. 24, 1986) (App.
15). After further proceedings, the District Court narrowed the class
definition to that set out in the text.

4 The District Court chose November 30, 1988, to coincide with the deadline for legalization applications under the Reform Act's SAW program.
See No. Civ. S-86-1343 LKK (ED Cal., June 10, 1988) (App. to Pet. for

(ED Cal., June 10, 1988) (App. to Pet. for Cert. 25a). Two
further remedial orders issued on August 11, 1988, provided,
respectively, an alternative remedy if the extension of the
application period should be invalidated on appeal, and further specific relief for any class members who had been
detained or apprehended by the INS or who were in deportation proceedings.6 No. Civ. S-86-1343 LKK (ED Cal.) (Record, Doc. Nos. 187, 189). The INS appealed all three of the
remedial orders.7

The second of the two lawsuits, styled INS v. League of
United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) et al., goes to
the INS's interpretation of 8 U. S. C. $ 1255a(a)(2)(A), the Reform Act's "continuous unlawful residence" requirement.
The Act provides that certain brief trips abroad will not
break an alien's continuous unlawful residence ( just as

5 The order also required the INS to identify all class members whose
applications had been denied or recommended for denial on the basis of
the advance parole regulation, and to "rescind such denials . . . and readjudicate such applications in a manner consistent with the court's order."
No. Civ. S-86-1343 LKK (ED Cal., June 10, 1988) (App. to Pet. for Cert.
24a). The INS did not appeal this part of the order. See Brief for Petitioners 11, n. 11.

6 The latter order required the INS to provide apprehended and detained aliens, and those in deportation proceedings, with "a reasonable
opportunity, of not less than thirty (30) days, to submit an application [for
legalization]." See n. 2, supra (describing the Act's provisions regarding
such aliens); n. 12, infra (describing the LULAC court's relief for such
aliens in INS v. League of United Latin American Citizens).

7 The CSS plaintiffs cross-appealed, challenging the District Court's denial of their request for an injunction ordering the INS to permit class
members outside the United States to enter the United States so that
they could file applications for adjustment of status. The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's denial, see Catholic Social Services,
Inc. v. Thornburgh, 956 F. 2d 914, 923 (CA9 1992), and the plaintiffs did
not petition this Court for review of the Court of Appeals' judgment; thus,
the issues presented by the cross-appeal are not before us.

Opinion of the Court
certain brief absences from the United States would not vio-late the "continuous physical presence" requirement). See

$ 1255a(g)(2)(A). Under an INS regulation, however, analien would fail the "continuous unlawful residence" requirement if he had gone abroad and reentered the United States
by presenting "facially valid" documentation to immigrationauthorities. 8 CFR $ 245a.2(b)(8) (1992).

8 On the INS's

reasoning, an alien's use of such documentation made his sub-sequent presence "lawful" for purposes of $ 1255a(a)(2)(A),

thereby breaking the continuity of his unlawful residence.Thus, an alien who had originally entered the United States
under a valid nonimmigrant visa, but had become an unlaw-ful resident by violating the terms of that visa in a way
known to the Government before January 1, 1982, was eligi-ble for relief under the Reform Act. If, however, the same
alien left the United States briefly and then used the same
visa to get back in (a facially valid visa that had in fact become invalid after his earlier violation of its terms), he rendered himself ineligible.

In July 1987, the LULAC plaintiffs brought suit challenging the reentry regulation as inconsistent both with the Act
and the equal protection limitation derived from Fifth
Amendment due process. With this suit still pending, on
November 17, 1987, some seven months into the Reform

8 This regulation expresses the INS policy in signally cryptic form, stating that an alien's eligibility "shall not be affected by entries to the United
States subsequent to January 1, 1982 that were not documented on Service
Form I-94, Arrival-Departure Record." By negative implication, an alien
would be rendered ineligible by an entry that was documented on an I-94
form. An entry is documented on an I-94 form when it occurs through a
normal, official port of entry, at which an alien must present some validlooking document (for example, a nonimmigrant visa) to get into the
United States. See 8 CFR $ 235.1(f) (1992). Under the INS policy, an
alien who reentered by presenting such a "facially valid" document broke
the continuity of his unlawful residence, whereas an alien who reentered
the United States by crossing a desolate portion of the border, thus avoiding inspection altogether, maintained that continuity.

Opinion of the Court
Act's 12-month application period, the INS modified its re-entry policy by issuing two new regulations.

9 The first,

codified at 8 CFR $ 245a.2(b)(9) (1992), specifically acknowl-edged the eligibility of an alien who "reentered the United

States as a nonimmigrant . . . in order to return to an unrelin-quished unlawful residence," so long as he "would be otherwise eligible for legalization and . . . was present in theUnited States in an unlawful status prior to January 1, 1982."
52 Fed. Reg. 43845 (1987). The second, codified at 8 CFR$ 245a.2(b)(10) (1992), qualified this expansion of eligibility by
obliging such an alien to obtain a waiver of a statutory pro-vision requiring exclusion of aliens who enter the United
States by fraud. Ibid.Although the LULAC plaintiffs then amended their complaint, they pressed their claim that 8 CFR $ 245a.2(b)(8)(1992), the reentry regulation originally challenged, had been
invalid prior to its modification. As to that claim, the Dis-trict Court certified the case as a class action, with a class
including

"all persons who qualify for legalization but who weredeemed ineligible for legalization under the original

[reentry] policy, who learned of their ineligibility follow-ing promulgation of the policy and who, relying upon
information that they were ineligible, did not apply forlegalization before the May 4, 1988 deadline."

10 No. 87-

4757-WDK (JRx) (CD Cal., July 15, 1988) (App. 216).

9 The INS first announced its intention to modify its policy in a statement issued by then-INS Commissioner Alan Nelson on October 8, 1987,
see Record, Addendum to Doc. No. 8; however, it did not issue the new
regulations until November 17 following.

10 The LULAC plaintiffs also challenged the modified policy, claiming

that aliens should not have to comply with the requirement of 8 CFR

$ 245a.2(b)(10) (1992) to obtain a waiver of excludability for having fraudulently procured entry into the United States. With respect to this challenge, the District Court certified a second class comprising persons adversely affected by the modified policy. See No. 87-4757-WDK (JRx) (CD
Cal., July 15, 1988) (App. 216). However, the District Court ultimately

effectively truncated the 12-month application period by en-forcing the invalid regulation, by publicizing the regulation
so as to dissuade potential applicants, and by failing to givesufficient publicity to its change in policy. On August 12,
1988, the District Court granted the plaintiffs' request forinjunctive relief.

12 No. 87-4757-WDK (JRx) (CD Cal., Aug.

12, 1988) (App. to Pet. for Cert. 50a). The INS appealed
this remedial order.

In its appeals in both CSS and LULAC, the INS raisedtwo challenges to the orders of the respective District

Courts. First, it argued that the restrictive judicial reviewprovisions of the Reform Act barred district court jurisdiction over the claim in each case. It contended, second, thateach District Court erred in ordering an extension of the 12-
month application period, the 12-month limit being, it main-tained, a substantive statutory restriction on relief beyond
the power of a court to alter.
rejected the challenge to the modified policy, see ibid. (App. 234), and the
LULAC plaintiffs did not appeal the grant of summary judgment to the
INS on this issue.

for legalization applications under the Reform Act's SAW program. No.
87-4757-WDK (JRx) (CD Cal., Aug. 12, 1988) (App. to Pet. for Cert. 50a);

provisions regarding such aliens); n. 6, supra (describing the CSS court's

The Reform Act not only sets the qualifications for ob-taining temporary resident status, but also provides an exclusive scheme for administrative and judicial review of "de-termination[s] respecting . . . application[s] for adjustment of
status" under the Title II legalization program. 8 U. S. C.$ 1255a(f )(1). Section 1255a(f)(3)(A) directs the Attorney
General to "establish an appellate authority to provide for asingle level of administrative appellate review" of such deter13 While the appeals were pending in the Ninth Circuit, the orders of
the District Courts were each subject to a stay order. Under the terms
of each stay order, the INS was obliged to grant a stay of deportation and
temporary work authorization to any class member whose application
made a prima facie showing of eligibility for legalization, but was not
obliged to process the applications. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 63a-64a.
Because the Court of Appeals has stayed its mandate pending this Court's
disposition of the case, see Nos. 88-15046, 88-15127, 88-15128, 88-6447
(CA9, May 1, 1992) (staying the mandate); Nos. 88-15046, 88-15127, 88-
15128, 88-6447 (CA9, Sept. 17, 1992) (denying the INS's motion to dissolve
the stay and issue its mandate), the INS is still operating under these
stay orders. By March 1992, it had received some 300,000 applications
for temporary resident status under the stay orders. See App. to Pet. for
Cert. 83a.

minations. Section 1255a(f)(4)(A) provides that a denial ofadjustment of status is subject to review by a court "only in

the judicial review of an order of deportation under [8U. S. C. $ 1105a]"; under $ 1105a, this review takes place in
the courts of appeals. Section 1255a(f)(1) closes the circleby explicitly rendering the scheme exclusive: "There shall
be no administrative or judicial review of a determinationrespecting an application for adjustment of status under this
section except in accordance with this subsection."Under this scheme, an alien denied adjustment of status by the INS in the first instance may appeal to theAssociate Commissioner for Examinations, the "appellate
authority" designated by the Attorney General pursuant to$ 1255a(f )(3)(A). See 8 CFR $$ 103.1(f)(1)(xxvii), 245a.2(p)
(1992). Although the Associate Commissioner's decision isthe final agency action on the application, an adverse decision
does not trigger deportation proceedings. On the contrary,because the Reform Act generally allows the INS to use information in a legalization application only to make a deter-mination on the application, see 8 U. S. C. $ 1255a(c)(5),

14 an

alien whose appeal has been rejected by the Associate Com-missioner stands (except for a latent right to judicial review

of that rejection) in the same position he did before he ap-plied: he is residing in the United States in an unlawful status, but the Government has not found out about him yet.15

14 The INS may also use the information to enforce a provision penalizing the filing of fraudulent applications, and to prepare statistical reports
to Congress. $ 1255a(c)(5)(A).

15 This description excludes the alien who was already in deportation

proceedings before he applied for legalization under $ 1255a. Once his
application is denied, however, such an alien must also continue with deportation proceedings as if he had never applied, and may obtain further
review of the denial of his application only upon review of a final order of
deportation entered against him. See 8 U. S. C. $ 1255a(f)(4)(A). The
Act's provisions regarding aliens who have been issued an order to show
cause before applying are described at n. 2, supra; the provisions of the

55Cite as: 509 U. S. 43 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
We call the right to judicial review "latent" because$ 1255a(f )(4)(A) allows judicial review of a denial of adjustment of status only on appeal of "an order of deportation."Hence, the alien must first either surrender to the INS for
deportation 16 or wait for the INS to catch him and commencea deportation proceeding, and then suffer a final adverse decision in that proceeding, before having an opportunity to
challenge the INS's denial of his application in court.The INS takes these provisions to preclude the District

Courts from exercising jurisdiction over the claims in boththe

CSS and LULAC cases, reasoning that the regulations
it adopted to elaborate the qualifications for temporary resi-dent status are "determination[s] respecting an application

for adjustment of status" within the meaning of $ 1255a(f )(1);because the claims in

CSS and LULAC attack the validity of
those regulations, they are subject to the limitations contained in $ 1255a(f ), foreclosing all jurisdiction in the districtcourts, and granting it to the courts of appeals only on review of a deportation order. The INS recognizes, however,that this reasoning is out of line with our decision in

McNary
v. Haitian Refugee Center, Inc., supra, where we construeda virtually identical set of provisions governing judicial review within a separate legalization program for agricultural
workers created by Title III of the Reform Act.17 There, as

District Court orders regarding such aliens are described at nn. 6 and
12, supra.

16 Although aliens have no explicit statutory right to force the INS to

commence a deportation proceeding, the INS has represented that "any
alien who wishes to challenge an adverse determination on his legalization
application may secure review by surrendering for deportation at any INS
district office." Reply Brief for Petitioners 9-10 (footnote omitted).

17 The single difference between the two sets of provisions is the addition, in the provisions now before us, of a further specific jurisdictional
bar: "No denial of adjustment of status under this section based on a late
filing of an application for such adjustment may be reviewed by a court of
the United States or of any State or reviewed in any administrative pro509us1100I 05-09-97 08:11:11 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
here, the critical language was "a determination respectingan application for adjustment of status." We said that "the

reference to `a determination' describes a single act ratherthan a group of decisions or a practice or procedure employed
in making decisions." Id., at 492. We noted that the pro-vision permitting judicial review only in the context of a deportation proceeding also defined its scope by referenceto a single act: " `judicial review of

such a denial.' " Ibid.(emphasis in original) (quoting 8 U. S. C. $ 1160(e)(3)); see

$ 1255a(f )(4)(A) (using identical language). We therefore de-cided that the language setting the limits of the jurisdictional
bar "describes the denial of an individual application," 498U. S., at 492, and thus "applies only to review of denials of
individual . . . applications." Id., at 494. The INS gives usno reason to reverse course, and we reject its argument that

$ 1255a(f )(1) precludes district court jurisdiction over an ac-tion challenging the legality of a regulation without referring to or relying on the denial of any individual application.Section 1255a(f)(1), however, is not the only jurisdictional
hurdle in the way of the CSS and LULAC plaintiffs, whoseclaims still must satisfy the jurisdictional and justiciability
requirements that apply in the absence of a specific congres-sional directive. To be sure, a statutory source of jurisdiction is not lacking, since 28 U. S. C. $ 1331, generally grantingfederal-question jurisdiction, "confer[s] jurisdiction on federal courts to review agency action." Califano v. Sanders,430 U. S. 99, 105 (1977). Neither is it fatal that the Reform
Act is silent about the type of judicial review those plaintiffsseek. We customarily refuse to treat such silence "as a denial of authority to [an] aggrieved person to seek appropriaterelief in the federal courts,"

Stark v. Wickard, 321 U. S. 288,309 (1944), and this custom has been "reinforced by the enactment of the Administrative Procedure Act, which embodceeding of the United States Government." 8 U. S. C. $ 1255a(f)(2). As
the INS appears to concede, see Brief for Petitioners 19, the claims at
issue in this case do not fall within the scope of this bar.

ies the basic presumption of judicial review to one `sufferinglegal wrong because of agency action, or adversely affected

or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a rele-vant statute.' " Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U. S.
136, 140 (1967) (quoting 5 U. S. C. $ 702).As we said in

Abbott Laboratories, however, the presump-tion of available judicial review is subject to an implicit limitation: "injunctive and declaratory judgment remedies,"what the respondents seek here, "are discretionary, and
courts traditionally have been reluctant to apply them to ad-ministrative determinations unless these arise in the context
of a controversy `ripe' for judicial resolution," 18 387 U. S., at148, that is to say, unless the effects of the administrative
action challenged have been "felt in a concrete way by thechallenging parties," id., at 148-149. In some cases, the
promulgation of a regulation will itself affect parties con-cretely enough to satisfy this requirement, as it did in

AbbottLaboratories itself. There, for example, as well as in Gardner v. Toilet Goods Assn., Inc., 387 U. S. 167 (1967), the pro-mulgation of the challenged regulations presented plaintiffs
with the immediate dilemma to choose between complyingwith newly imposed, disadvantageous restrictions and risking serious penalties for violation. Abbott Laboratories,
supra, at 152-153; Gardner, supra, at 171-172. But that willnot be so in every case. In Toilet Goods Assn., Inc. v. Gardner, 387 U. S. 158 (1967), for example, we held that a chal18 We have noted that ripeness doctrine is drawn both from Article III
limitations on judicial power and from prudential reasons for refusing to
exercise jurisdiction. See, e. g., Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 114 (1976)
(per curiam); Socialist Labor Party v. Gilligan, 406 U. S. 583, 588 (1972).
Even when a ripeness question in a particular case is prudential, we may
raise it on our own motion, and "cannot be bound by the wishes of the
parties." Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases, 419 U. S. 102, 138
(1974). Although the issue of ripeness is not explicitly addressed in the
questions presented in the INS's petition, it is fairly included and both
parties have touched on it in their briefs before this Court. See Brief for
Petitioners 20; Brief for Respondents 17, n. 23.

lenge to another regulation, the impact of which could not"be said to be felt immediately by those subject to it in conducting their day-to-day affairs," id., at 164, would not beripe before the regulation's application to the plaintiffs in
some more acute fashion, since "no irremediabl[y] adverseconsequences flow[ed] from requiring a later challenge,"

ibid.See Lujan v. National Wildlife Federation, 497 U. S. 871,

891 (1990) (a controversy concerning a regulation is not ordi-narily ripe for review under the Administrative Procedure
Act until the regulation has been applied to the claimant'ssituation by some concrete action).

The regulations challenged here fall on the latter side ofthe line. They impose no penalties for violating any newly
imposed restriction, but limit access to a benefit created bythe Reform Act but not automatically bestowed on eligible
aliens. Rather, the Act requires each alien desiring the ben-efit to take further affirmative steps, and to satisfy criteria
beyond those addressed by the disputed regulations.19 It

19 Justice O'Connor contends that "if the court can make a firm prediction that the plaintiff will apply for the benefit, and that the agency will
deny the application by virtue of the [challenged] rule[,] then there may
well be a justiciable controversy that the court may find prudent to resolve." Post, at 69. Even if this is true, however, we do not see how
such a "firm prediction" could be made in this case. As for the prediction
that the plaintiffs "will apply for the benefit," we are now considering only
the cases of those plaintiffs who, in fact, failed to file timely applications.
As for the prediction that "the agency will deny the application by virtue
of the [challenged] rule," we reemphasize that in this case, access to the
benefit in question is conditioned on several nontrivial rules other than
the two challenged. This circumstance makes it much more difficult to
predict firmly that the INS would deny a particular application "by virtue
of the [challenged] rule," and not by virtue of some other, unchallenged
rule that it determined barred an adjustment of status.

Similarly distinguishable is our decision in Northeastern Fla. Chapter,
Associated Gen. Contractors of America v. Jacksonville, 508 U. S. 656
(1993), the factual and legal setting of which Justice Stevens appears to
equate with that of the present cases, see post, at 81-82. In Associated
General Contractors, the plaintiff association alleged that "many of its
members regularly bid on and perform construction work for the [defendant city]," 508 U. S., at 659 (internal quotation marks omitted), thus pro509us1100I 05-09-97 08:11:11 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
delegates to the INS the task of determining on a case-by-case basis whether each applicant has met all of the Act's

conditions, not merely those interpreted by the regulationsin question. In these circumstances, the promulgation of
the challenged regulations did not itself give each CSS and
LULAC class member a ripe claim; a class member's claimwould ripen only once he took the affirmative steps that he

could take before the INS blocked his path by applying the
regulation to him.20

viding a historical basis for the further unchallenged allegation that the
members "would have . . . bid on . . . designated set aside contracts but
for the restrictions imposed by the [challenged] ordinance," ibid. (internal
quotation marks omitted). A plaintiff in these cases can point to no similar history of application behavior to support a claim that "she would have
applied . . . but for the invalid regulations," post, at 85; and we think the
mere fact that she may have heard of the invalid regulations through a
Qualified Designated Entity, a private attorney, or "word of mouth," post,
at 80, insufficient proof of this counterfactual. Further, we defined the
"injury in fact" in Associated General Contractors as "the inability to
compete on an equal footing in the bidding process, not the loss of a contract," 508 U. S., at 666; thus, whether the association's members would
have been awarded contracts but for the challenged ordinance was not
immediately relevant. Here, the plaintiffs seek, not an equal opportunity
to compete for adjustments of status, but the adjustments of status themselves. Under this circumstance, it becomes important to know whether
they would be eligible for the adjustments but for the challenged
regulations.

20 Justice O'Connor maintains that the plaintiffs' actions are now ripe

because they have amended their complaints to seek the additional remedy
of extending the application period, and the application period is now over.
Post, at 71-72. We do not see how these facts establish ripeness. In
both cases before us, the plaintiffs' underlying claim is that an INS regulation implementing the Reform Act is invalid. Because the Act requires
each alien desiring legalization to take certain affirmative steps, and because the Act's conditions extend beyond those addressed by the challenged regulations, one cannot know whether the challenged regulation
actually makes a concrete difference to a particular alien until one knows
that he will take those affirmative steps and will satisfy the other conditions. Neither the fact that the application period is now over, nor the
fact that the plaintiffs would now like the period to be extended, tells us
anything about the willingness of the class members to take the required

60 RENO v. CATHOLIC SOCIAL SERVICES, INC.

Opinion of the Court
Ordinarily, of course, that barrier would appear when the
INS formally denied the alien's application on the ground
that the regulation rendered him ineligible for legalization.
A plaintiff who sought to rely on the denial of his application
to satisfy the ripeness requirement, however, would then
still find himself at least temporarily barred by the Reform
Act's exclusive review provisions, since he would be seeking
"judicial review of a determination respecting an application." 8 U. S. C. $ 1255a(f )(1). The ripeness doctrine and
the Reform Act's jurisdictional provisions would thus dovetail neatly, and not necessarily by mere coincidence. Congress may well have assumed that, in the ordinary case, the
courts would not hear a challenge to regulations specifying
limits to eligibility before those regulations were actually
applied to an individual, whose challenge to the denial of an
individual application would proceed within the Reform Act's
limited scheme. The CSS and LULAC plaintiffs do not

affirmative steps, or about their satisfaction of the Reform Act's other
conditions. The end of the application period may mean that the plaintiffs
no longer have an opportunity to take the steps that could make their
claims ripe; but this fact is significant only for those plaintiffs who can
claim that the Government prevented them from filing a timely application. See infra, at 61-64 (discussing the INS's "front-desking" practice).

Justice O'Connor's ripeness analysis encounters one further difficulty.
In her view, the plaintiffs' claims are ripe because "[i]t is certain that an
alien who now applies to the INS for legalization will be denied that benefit because the period has closed." Post, at 72 (emphasis in original). In
these circumstances, she suggests, it would make no sense to require "the
would-be beneficiary [to] make the wholly futile gesture of submitting an
application." Ibid. But a plaintiff who, to establish ripeness, relies on
the certainty that his application would be denied on grounds of untimeliness, must confront $ 1255a(f)(2), which flatly bars all "court[s] of the
United States" from reviewing "denial[s] of adjustment of status . . . based
on a late filing of an application for such adjustment." We would almost
certainly interpret this provision to bar such reliance, since otherwise
plaintiffs could always entangle the INS in litigation over application timing claims simply by suing without filing an application, a result we believe

$ 1255a(f)(2) was intended to foreclose in the ordinary case.

Opinion of the Court
argue that this limited scheme would afford them inadequatereview of a determination based on the regulations they

challenge, presumably because they would be able to obtainsuch review on appeal from a deportation order, if they become subject to such an order; their situation is thus differ-ent from that of the "17 unsuccessful individual SAW applicants" in McNary, 498 U. S., at 487, whose proceduralobjections, we concluded, could receive no practical judicial
review within the scheme established by 8 U. S. C. $ 1160(e),
id., at 496-497.This is not the end of the matter, however, because the

plaintiffs have called our attention to an INS policy that maywell have placed some of them outside the scope of

$ 1255a(f )(1). The INS has issued a manual detailing proce-dures for its offices to follow in implementing the Reform
Act's legalization programs and instructing INS employeescalled "Legalization Assistants" to review certain applications in the presence of the applicants before accepting themfor filing. See Procedures Manual for the Legalization and
Special Agricultural Worker Programs of the ImmigrationReform and Control Act of 1986 (Legalization Manual or
Manual).21 According to the Manual, "[m]inor correctabledeficiencies such as incomplete responses or typographical
errors may be corrected by the [Legalization Assistant]."
Id., at IV-6. "[I]f the applicant is statutorily ineligible,"however, the Manual provides that "the application will be

rejected by the [Legalization Assistant]." Ibid. (emphasisadded). Because this prefiling rejection of applications oc21 Under the Manual's procedures, only those applications that were not
prepared with the assistance of a "Qualified Designated Entity" (the Reform Act's designation for private organizations that serve as intermediaries between applicants and the INS, see 8 U. S. C. $ 1255a(c)(1)) are subject
to review by Legalization Assistants. The applications that were prepared with the help of Qualified Designated Entities skip this step. See
Legalization Manual, at IV-5, IV-6. There is no evidence in the record
indicating how many CSS and LULAC class members were assisted by
Qualified Designated Entities in preparing their applications.

Opinion of the Court
curs at the front desk of an INS office, it has come to be
called "front-desking." 22 While the regulations challenged
in CSS and LULAC were in force, Legalization Assistants
who applied both the regulations and the Manual's instructions may well have "front-desked" the applications of class
members who disclosed the circumstances of their trips outside the United States, and affidavits on file in the LULAC
case represent that they did exactly that.23 See n. 26, infra.

22 The INS forwards a different interpretation of the policy set forth in
the Legalization Manual. According to the INS, the Manual reflects a
policy, motivated by "charitable concern," of "inform[ing] aliens of [the
INS's] view that their applications are deficient before it accepts the filing
fee, so that they can make an informed choice about whether to pay the
fee if they are not going to receive immediate relief." Reply Brief for
Petitioners 9 (emphasis omitted). The "rejection" policy, argues the INS,
did not really bar applicants from filing applications; another sentence in
the Manual proves that the door remains open, for it provides that "[i]f an
applicant whose application has been rejected by the [Legalization Assistant] insists on filing, the application will be routed through a fee clerk to
an adjudicator with a routing slip from the [Legalization Assistant] stating
the noted deficiency(ies)." Legalization Manual, at IV-6.

We cannot find, in either of the two sentences the parties point to, the
policy now articulated by the INS. The first sentence does not say that
applicants will be informed; it says that applications will be rejected. The
second sentence contains no hint that the Legalization Assistant should
tell the applicant that he has a right to file an application despite the
"rejection," or that he should file an application if he wants to preserve
his rights. Rather, it seems to provide little more than a procedure for
dealing with the pesky applicant who "won't take `no' for an answer."
Neither of the sentences preserves a realistic path to judicial review.

23 In its reply brief in this Court, see Reply Brief for Petitioners 14, the

INS argues that those individuals who were front-desked fall outside the
classes defined by the District Courts, since the CSS class included only
those who "knew of [INS's] unlawful regulation and thereby concluded
that they were ineligible for legalization and by reason of that conclusion
did not file an application," App. to Pet. for Cert. 25a, and the LULAC
class included only those "who learned of their ineligibility following promulgation of the policy and who, relying upon information that they were
ineligible, did not apply for legalization before the May 4, 1988 deadline,"
App. 216. The language in CSS that the INS points to, however, is not

63Cite as: 509 U. S. 43 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
As respondents argue, see Brief for Respondents 17, n. 23,a class member whose application was "front-desked" would

have felt the effects of the "advance parole" or "facially validdocument" regulation in a particularly concrete manner, for
his application for legalization would have been blocked then
and there; his challenge to the regulation should not fail forlack of ripeness. Front-desking would also have a further,

and untoward, consequence for jurisdictional purposes, for itwould effectively exclude an applicant from access even to
the limited administrative and judicial review proceduresestablished by the Reform Act. He would have no formal
denial to appeal to the Associate Commissioner for Exam-inations, nor would he have an opportunity to build an
administrative record on which judicial review might be
based.24 Hence, to construe $ 1255a(f )(1) to bar districtcourt jurisdiction over his challenge, we would have to impute to Congress an intent to preclude judicial review of the
legality of INS action entirely under those circumstances.
As we stated recently in McNary, however, there is a "wellthe class definition, which is much broader, see supra, at 48-49; rather, it
is part of the requirements class members must meet to obtain one of the
forms of relief ordered by the District Court. We understand the
LULAC class definition to use the word "apply" to mean "have an application accepted for filing by the INS," as under this reading the definition
encompasses all those whom the INS refuses to treat as having timely
applied (which is the refusal that lies at the heart of the parties' dispute),
and as the definition then includes those who "learned of their ineligibility" by being front-desked, since it would be odd to exclude those who
learned of their ineligibility in the most direct way possible from this description. As we note below, however, see n. 29, infra, we believe that
the word "applied" as used in $ 1255a(a)(1)(A) has a broader meaning than
that given to the word in the LULAC class definition.

24 The Reform Act limits judicial review to "the administrative record

established at the time of the review by the appellate authority." 8
U. S. C. $ 1255a(f)(4)(B). In addition, an INS regulation provides that a
legalization application may not "be filed or reopened before an immigration judge or the Board of Immigration Appeals during exclusion or deportation proceedings." 8 CFR $ 103.3(a)(3)(iii) (1992).

settled presumption favoring interpretations of statutes that
allow judicial review of administrative action," 498 U. S., at
496; and we will accordingly find an intent to preclude such
review only if presented with " `clear and convincing evidence,' " Abbott Laboratories, 387 U. S., at 141 (quoting Rusk
v. Cort, 369 U. S. 367, 379-380 (1962)). See generally Bowen
v. Michigan Academy of Family Physicians, 476 U. S. 667,
670-673 (1986) (discussing the presumption in favor of judicial review).

There is no such clear and convincing evidence in the statute before us. Although the phrase "a determination respecting an application for adjustment of status" could conceivably encompass a Legalization Assistant's refusal to
accept the application for filing at the front desk of a Legalization Office, nothing in the statute suggests, let alone demonstrates, that Congress was using "determination" in such
an extended and informal sense. Indeed, at least one related statutory provision suggests just the opposite. Section 1255a(f)(3)(B) limits administrative appellate review to
"the administrative record established at the time of the determination on the application"; because there obviously can
be no administrative record in the case of a front-desked application, the term "determination" is best read to exclude
front-desking. Thus, just as we avoided an interpretation
of 8 U. S. C. $ 1160(e) in McNary that would have amounted
to "the practical equivalent of a total denial of judicial review
of generic constitutional and statutory claims," McNary,
supra, at 497, so here we avoid an interpretation of

$ 1255a(f )(1) that would bar front-desked applicants from
ever obtaining judicial review of the regulations that rendered them ineligible for legalization.

Unfortunately, however, neither the CSS record nor the
LULAC record contains evidence that particular class members were actually subjected to front-desking. None of the
named individual plaintiffs in either case alleges that he or

Opinion of the Court
she was front-desked,25 and while a number of affidavits in
the LULAC record contain the testimony of immigration attorneys and employees of interested organizations that the
INS has "refused," "rejected," or "den[ied] individuals the
right to file" applications,26 the testimony is limited to such
general assertions; none of the affiants refers to any specific
incident that we can identify as an instance of frontdesking.27

25 In LULAC, the one named individual plaintiff who represents the subclass challenging the INS's original "facially-valid document" policy never
attempted to file an application, because he was advised by an attorney
over the telephone that he was ineligible. See LULAC, First Amended
Complaint 11-12 (Record, Doc. No. 56) (describing plaintiff John Doe). In
CSS, none of the named plaintiffs challenging the "advance parole" regulation allege that they attempted to file applications. See CSS Sixth
Amended Complaint 12-18 (Record, Doc. No. 140).

26 See App. 204 (affidavit of Pilar Cuen) (legalization counselor states

that "INS has refused applications for legalization because our clients entered after January 1, 1982 with a non-immigrant visa and an I-94 was
issued at the time of reentry"); App. 209 (affidavit of Joanne T. Stark)
(immigration lawyer in private practice states that she is "aware that the
Service has discouraged application in the past by [LULAC class members] or has rejected applications made"); Record, Doc. No. 16, Exh. H,
p. 135 (affidavit of Isabel Garcia Gallegos) (immigration attorney states
that "the legalization offices in Southern Arizona [have] rejected, and otherwise, discouraged individuals who had, in fact entered the United States
with an I-94 after January 1, 1982"); App. 200 (affidavit of Marc Van Der
Hout) (immigration attorney states that "[i]t has been the practice of the
San Francisco District legalization office to deny individuals the right to
file an application for legalization under the [Reform Act] if the individual
had been in unlawful status prior to January 1, 1982, departed the United
States post January 1, 1982, and re-entered on a non-immigrant visa").

27 Only one affiant refers to a specific incident. He recounts: "[I]n August [1987] I was at the San Francisco legalization office when an individual came in seeking to apply for legalization. She was met at the reception desk by a clerk and when she explained the facts of her case, [that
she had departed and re-entered the United States after January 1, 1982,
on a non-immigrant visa], she was told that she did not qualify for legalization and could not file." App. 200-201 (affidavit of Marc Van Der Hout).
The significance of this incident is unclear, however, since there is no way

66 RENO v. CATHOLIC SOCIAL SERVICES, INC.

Opinion of the Court
This lack of evidence precludes us from resolving the jurisdictional issue here, because, on the facts before us, the
front-desking of a particular class member is not only sufficient to make his legal claims ripe, but necessary to do so.
As the case has been presented to us, there seems to be no
reliable way of determining whether a particular class member, had he applied at all (which, we assume, he did not),
would have applied in a manner that would have subjected
him to front-desking. As of October 16, 1987, the INS had
certified 977 Qualified Designated Entities which could have
aided class members in preparing applications that would not
have been front-desked, see 52 Fed. Reg. 44812 (1987); n. 21,
supra, and there is no prior history of application behavior
on the basis of which we could predict who would have applied without Qualified Designated Entity assistance and
therefore been front-desked. Hence, we cannot say that the
mere existence of a front-desking policy involved a "concrete
application" of the invalid regulations to those class members
who were not actually front-desked.28 Because only those
class members (if any) who were front-desked have ripe
claims over which the District Courts should exercise jurisdiction, we must vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and remand with directions to remand to the respecof telling whether this individual was a LULAC class member (that is,
whether she would otherwise have been eligible for legalization), nor
whether she had a completed application ready for filing and payment
in hand.

28 The record reveals relatively little about the application of the frontdesking policy and surrounding circumstances. Although we think it unlikely, we cannot rule out the possibility that further facts would allow
class members who were not front-desked to demonstrate that the frontdesking policy was nevertheless a substantial cause of their failure to
apply, so that they can be said to have had the "advanced parole" or "facially valid document" regulation applied to them in a sufficiently concrete
manner to satisfy ripeness concerns.

tive District Courts for proceedings to determine which classmembers were front-desked.

29

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and thecase is remanded for further proceedings consistent with

this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice O'Connor, concurring in the judgment.
I agree that the District Courts in these two cases, Reno
v. Catholic Social Services, Inc. (CSS), and INS v. League
of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), erred in extending the application period for legalization beyond May
4, 1988, the end of the 12-month interval specified by the
Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. I would not,
however, reach this result on ripeness grounds. The Court
holds that a member of the plaintiff class in CSS or LULAC
who failed to apply to the INS during the 12-month period
does not now have a ripe claim to extend the application
deadline. In my view, that claim became ripe after May 4,
1988, even if it was not ripe before. The claim may well lack
merit, but it is no longer premature.

The Court of Appeals did not consider the problem of ripeness, and the submissions to this Court have not discussed

29 Although we do not reach the question of remedy on this disposition
of the case, we note that, by definition, each CSS and LULAC class member who was front-desked presented at an INS office to an INS employee
an application that under the terms of the Reform Act (as opposed to the
terms of the invalid regulation) entitled him to an adjustment of status.
Under any reasonable interpretation of the word, such an individual "applied" for an adjustment of status within the 12-month period under

$ 1255a(a)(1)(A). Because that individual timely applied, the INS need
only readjudicate the application, and grant the individual the relief to
which he is entitled. Since there is no statutory deadline for processing
the applications, and since a front-desked individual need not await a deportation order before obtaining judicial review, there is no reason to
think that a district court would lack the power to order such relief.

that problem except in passing. See Pet. for Cert. 11, n. 13;Brief for Petitioners 20; Brief for Respondents 17, n. 23.

Rather, certiorari was granted on two questions, to whichthe parties rightly have adhered: first, whether the District Courts had jurisdiction under 8 U. S. C. $ 1255a(f), the
judicial-review provision of Title II of the Reform Act; andsecond, whether the courts properly extended the application period. See Pet. for Cert. i. The Court finds the juris-dictional challenge meritless under

McNary v. Haitian Refugee Center, Inc., 498 U. S. 479 (1991), see ante, at 53-56, asdo I. But instead of proceeding to consider the second question presented, the Court sua sponte attempts to resolve the
case on ripeness grounds. It reaches out to hold that "the
promulgation of the challenged regulations did not itself give
each CSS and LULAC class member a ripe claim; a class
member's claim would ripen only once he took the affirmative steps that he could take before the INS blocked his path
by applying the regulation to him." Ante, at 59. This is
new and, in my view, incorrect law. Moreover, even if it is
correct, the new ripeness doctrine propounded by the Court
is irrelevant to the case at hand.

Our prior cases concerning anticipatory challenges to
agency rules do not specify when an anticipatory suit may
be brought against a benefit-conferring rule, such as the INS
regulations here. An anticipatory suit by a would-be beneficiary, who has not yet applied for the benefit that the rule
denies him, poses different ripeness problems than a preenforcement suit against a duty-creating rule, see Abbott
Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U. S. 136, 148-156 (1967) (permitting pre-enforcement suit). Even if he succeeds in his
anticipatory action, the would-be beneficiary will not receive
the benefit until he actually applies for it; and the agency
might then deny him the benefit on grounds other than his
ineligibility under the rule. By contrast, a successful suit
against the duty-creating rule will relieve the plaintiff immediately of a burden that he otherwise would bear.

69Cite as: 509 U. S. 43 (1993)
O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
Yet I would not go so far as to state that a suit challenging
a benefit-conferring rule is necessarily unripe simply because
the plaintiff has not yet applied for the benefit. "Where the
inevitability of the operation of a statute against certain individuals is patent, it is irrelevant to the existence of a justiciable controversy that there will be a time delay before the
disputed provisions will come into effect." Regional Rail
Reorganization Act Cases, 419 U. S. 102, 143 (1974). If it is
"inevitable" that the challenged rule will "operat[e]" to the
plaintiff 's disadvantage--if the court can make a firm prediction that the plaintiff will apply for the benefit, and that the
agency will deny the application by virtue of the rule--then
there may well be a justiciable controversy that the court
may find prudent to resolve.

I do not mean to suggest that a simple anticipatory challenge to the INS regulations would be ripe under the approach I propose. Cf. ante, at 58-59, n. 19. That issue need
not be decided because, as explained below, these cases are
not a simple anticipatory challenge. See infra, at 71-74.
My intent is rather to criticize the Court's reasoning--its
reliance on a categorical rule that would-be beneficiaries cannot challenge benefit-conferring regulations until they apply
for benefits.

Certainly the line of cases beginning with Abbott Laboratories does not support this categorical approach. That
decision itself discusses with approval an earlier case that
involved an anticipatory challenge to a benefit-conferring
rule.

"[I]n United States v. Storer Broadcasting Co., 351
U. S. 192, the Court held to be a final agency action . . .

it would not issue a television license to an applicant
already owning five such licenses, even though no specific application was before the Commission." 387
U. S., at 151 (emphasis added).

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
More recently, in EPA v. National Crushed Stone Assn., 449
U. S. 64 (1980), the Court held that a facial challenge to the
variance provision of an EPA pollution-control regulation
was ripe even "prior to application of the regulation to a
particular [company's] request for a variance." Id., at 72,
n. 12. And in Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Comm'n, 461 U. S.
190 (1983), the Court permitted utilities to challenge a state
law imposing a moratorium on the certification of nuclear
power plants, even though the utilities had not yet applied
for a certificate. See id., at 200-202. To be sure, all of
these decisions involved licenses, certificates, or variances,
which exempt the bearer from otherwise-applicable duties;
but the same is true of the instant cases. The benefit conferred by the Reform Act--an adjustment in status to lawful
temporary resident alien, see 8 U. S. C. $ 1255a(a)--readily
can be conceptualized as a "license" or "certificate" to remain
in the United States, or a "variance" from the immigration
laws.

As for Lujan v. National Wildlife Federation, 497 U. S.
871 (1990), the Court there stated:

"Absent [explicit statutory authorization for immediate
judicial review], a regulation is not ordinarily considered
the type of agency action `ripe' for judicial review under
the APA until the scope of the controversy has been
reduced to more manageable proportions, and its factual
components fleshed out, by some concrete action applying the regulation to the claimant's situation in a fashion
that harms or threatens to harm him. (The major exception, of course, is a substantive rule which as a practical matter requires the plaintiff to adjust his conduct
immediately. Such agency action is `ripe' for review at
once, whether or not explicit statutory review apart
from the APA is provided.)" Id., at 891-892 (citations
omitted).

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
This language does not suggest that an anticipatory chal-lenge to a benefit-conferring rule will of necessity be constitutionally unripe, for otherwise an "explicit statutory re-view" provision would not help cure the ripeness problem.
Rather, Lujan points to the prudential considerations that
weigh in the ripeness calculus: the need to "fles[h] out" thecontroversy and the burden on the plaintiff who must "adjust

his conduct immediately." These are just the kinds of fac-tors identified in the two-part, prudential test for ripeness
that Abbott Laboratories articulated. "The problem is bestseen in a twofold aspect, requiring us to evaluate both the
fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to
the parties of withholding court consideration." 387 U. S.,
at 149. See Thomas v. Union Carbide Agricultural Products Co., 473 U. S. 568, 581-582 (1985) (relying upon Abbott
Laboratories test); Pacific Gas, supra, at 200-203 (same);
National Crushed Stone, supra, at 72-73, n. 12 (same). At
the very least, where the challenge to the benefit-conferring
rule is purely legal, and where the plaintiff will suffer hardship if he cannot raise his challenge until later, a justiciable,
anticipatory challenge to the rule may well be ripe in the
prudential sense. Thus I cannot agree with the Court that
ripeness will never obtain until the plaintiff actually applies
for the benefit.

But this new rule of ripeness law, even if correct, is irrelevant here. These cases no longer fall in the above-described
category of anticipatory actions, where a would-be beneficiary simply seeks to invalidate a benefit-conferring rule before he applies for benefits. As the cases progressed in the
District Courts, respondents amended their complaints to request an additional remedy beyond the invalidation of the
INS regulations: an extension of the 12-month application
period. Compare Sixth Amended Complaint in CSS (Record, Doc. No. 140) and First Amended Complaint in LULAC
(Record, Doc. No. 56) with Third Amended Complaint in CSS
(Record, Doc. No. 69) and Complaint in LULAC (Record,

Doc. No. 1). That period expired on May 4, 1988, and theDistrict Courts

thereafter granted an extension. See App.
to Pet. for Cert. 22a-28a, 50a-60a (orders dated June andAugust 1988). The only issue before us is whether these

orders should have been entered. See ante, at 48-49, 52-53.
Even if the Court is correct that a plaintiff cannot seek toinvalidate an agency's benefit-conferring rule before applying to the agency for the benefit, it is a separate questionwhether the would-be beneficiary must make the wholly futile gesture of submitting an application when the application period has expired and he is seeking to extend it.

In the instant cases, I do not see why a class member who
failed to apply to the INS within the 12-month period lacks
a ripe claim to extend the application deadline, now that the
period actually has expired. If Congress in the Reform Act
had provided for an 18-month application period, and the
INS had closed the application period after only 12 months,
no one would argue that court orders extending the period
for 6 more months should be vacated on ripeness grounds.
The orders actually before us are not meaningfully distinguishable. Of course, respondents predicate their argument
for extending the period on the invalidity of the INS regulations, see infra, at 75-77, not on a separate statutory provision governing the length of the period, but this difference
does not change the ripeness calculus. The "basic rationale"
behind our ripeness doctrine "is to prevent the courts,
through premature adjudication, from entangling themselves
in abstract disagreements," when those "disagreements" are
premised on "contingent future events that may not occur as
anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all." Union Carbide, supra, at 580-581 (internal quotation marks omitted).
There is no contingency to the closing of the 12-month application period. It is certain that an alien who now applies to
the INS for legalization will be denied that benefit because
the period has closed. Nor does prudence justify this Court
in postponing an alien's claim to extend the period, since that

73Cite as: 509 U. S. 43 (1993)
O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
claim is purely legal and since a delayed opportunity to seeklegalization will cause grave uncertainty.

The Court responds to this point by reiterating that classmembers who failed to apply to the INS have not yet suffered a "concrete" injury, because the INS has not denied
them legalization by virtue of the challenged regulations.See

ante, at 59-60, n. 20. At present, however, class members
are seeking to redress a different, and logically prior, injury:the denial of the very opportunity to apply for legalization.

The Court's ripeness analysis focuses on the wrong ques-tion: whether "the

promulgation of the challenged regulations [gave] each CSS and LULAC class member a ripe
claim." Ante, at 59 (emphasis added). But the question is
not whether the class members' claims were ripe at the inception of these suits, when respondents were seeking simply to invalidate the INS regulations and the 12-month application period had not yet closed. Whatever the initial
status of those claims, they became ripe once the period had
in fact closed and respondents had amended their complaints
to seek an extension. In the Regional Rail Reorganization
Act Cases, this Court held that "since ripeness is peculiarly
a question of timing, it is the situation now rather than the
situation at the time of the District Court's decision that
must govern." 419 U. S., at 140. Accord, Buckley v. Valeo,
424 U. S. 1, 114-118 (1976) (per curiam). Similarly, in the
cases before us, it is the situation now (and, as it happens, at
the time of the District Courts' orders), rather than at the
time of the initial complaints, that must govern.

The Court also suggests that respondents' claim to extend
the application period may well be "flatly" barred by 8
U. S. C. $ 1255a(f)(2), which provides: "No denial of adjustment of status [under Title II of the Reform Act] based on a
late filing of an application for such adjustment may be reviewed by [any] court . . . ." See ante, at 60, n. 20. I find
it remarkable that the Court might construe $ 1255a(f)(2)
as barring any suit seeking to extend the application dead509us1100I 05-09-97 08:11:12 PAGES OPINPGT
74 RENO v. CATHOLIC SOCIAL SERVICES, INC.

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
line set by the INS, while at the same time interpreting

$ 1255a(f )(1) not to bar respondents' substantive challenge
to the INS regulations, see ante, at 53-56. As the INS
itself observes, the preclusive language in $ 1255a(f )(1) is
"broader" than in $ 1255a(f)(2), because the latter provision
uses the word "denial" instead of "determination." See
Brief for Petitioners 19. If Congress in the Reform Act had
provided for an 18-month application period, and the INS
had closed the period after only 12 months, I cannot believe
that $ 1255a(f)(2) would preclude a suit seeking to extend the
period by 6 months. Nor do I think that $ 1255a(f )(2) bars
respondents' claim to extend the period, because that claim
is predicated on their substantive challenge to the INS regulations, which in turn is permitted by $ 1255a(f )(1). In any
event, $ 1255a(f)(2) concerns reviewability, not ripeness;
whether or not that provision precludes the instant actions,
the Court's ripeness analysis remains misguided.

Of course, the closing of the application period was not an
unalloyed benefit for class members who had failed to apply.
After May 4, 1988, those aliens had ripe claims, but they also
became statutorily ineligible for legalization. The Reform
Act authorizes the INS to adjust the status of an illegal alien
only if he "appl[ies] for such adjustment during the 12-month
period beginning on a date . . . designated by the Attorney
General." 8 U. S. C. $ 1255a(a)(1)(A). As the INS rightly
argues, this provision precludes the legalization of an alien
who waited to apply until after the 12-month period had
ended. The District Courts' orders extending the application period were not unripe, either constitutionally or prudentially, but they were impermissible under the Reform
Act. "A court is no more authorized to overlook the valid
[requirement] that applications be [submitted] than it is to
overlook any other valid requirement for the receipt of
benefits." Schweiker v. Hansen, 450 U. S. 785, 790 (1981)
(per curiam).

Respondents assert that equity requires an extension ofthe time limit imposed by $ 1255a(a)(1)(A). Whether that

provision is seen as a limitations period subject to equitabletolling, see

Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, 498
U. S. 89, 95-96 (1990), or as a substantive requirement subject perhaps to equitable estoppel, see Office of Personnel
Management v. Richmond, 496 U. S. 414, 419-424 (1990), the
District Courts needed some special reason to exercise thatequitable power against the United States. The only reason

respondents adduce is supposed "affirmative misconduct" bythe INS. See

Irwin, supra, at 96 ("We have allowed equitable tolling in situations . . . where the complainant has been
induced or tricked by his adversary's misconduct into allowing the filing deadline to pass"); Richmond, supra, at 421
("Our own opinions have continued to mention the possibility,
in the course of rejecting estoppel arguments, that some
type of `affirmative misconduct' might give rise to estoppel
against the Government"). Respondents argue that the
INS engaged in "affirmative misconduct" by promulgating
the invalid regulations, which deterred aliens who were ineligible under those regulations from applying for legalization.
See Plaintiffs' Submission Re Availability of Remedies for
the Plaintiff Class in CSS, pp. 6-15 (Record, Doc. No. 164),
Plaintiffs' Memorandum on Remedies in LULAC (Record,
Doc. No. 40). The District Courts essentially accepted the
argument, ordering remedies coextensive with the INS' supposed "misconduct." The CSS court extended the application period for those class members who "knew of [the INS']
unlawful regulation and thereby concluded that they were
ineligible for legalization and by reason of that conclusion did
not file an application," App. to Pet. for Cert. 25a; the
LULAC court provided an almost identical remedy, see id.,
at 59a.

I cannot agree that a benefit-conferring agency commits
"affirmative misconduct," sufficient to justify an equitable
extension of the statutory time period for application, simply

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
by promulgating a regulation that incorrectly specifies the
eligibility criteria for the benefit. When Congress passes a
benefits statute that includes a time period, it has two goals.
It intends both that eligible claimants receive the benefit and
that they promptly assert their claims. The broad definition
of "misconduct" that respondents propose would give the
first goal absolute priority over the second, but I would
not presume that Congress intends such a prioritization.
Rather, absent evidence to the contrary, Congress presumably intends that the two goals be harmonized as best possible, by requiring would-be beneficiaries to make a timely application and concurrently to contest the invalid regulation.
"We have generally been much less forgiving in receiving
late filings where the claimant failed to exercise due diligence in preserving his legal rights." Irwin, supra, at 96.
The broad equitable remedy entered by the District Courts
in these cases is contrary to Congress' presumptive intent in
the Reform Act, and thus is error. " `Courts of equity can
no more disregard statutory . . . requirements and provisions
than can courts of law.' " INS v. Pangilinan, 486 U. S. 875,
883 (1988) (quoting Hedges v. Dixon County, 150 U. S. 182,
192 (1893)).

I therefore agree with the Court that the District Courts'
orders extending the application period must be vacated. I
also agree that "front-desked" aliens already have "applied"
within the meaning of $ 1255a(a)(1)(A). See ante, at 67,
n. 29. On remand, respondents may be able to demonstrate
particular instances of "misconduct" by the INS, beyond the
promulgation of the invalid regulations, that might perhaps
justify an extension for certain members of the LULAC class
or the CSS class. See Brief for Respondents 16-20, 35-42.
I would not preclude the possibility of a narrower order requiring the INS to adjudicate the applications of both "frontdesked" aliens and some aliens who were not "front-desked,"
but neither would I endorse that possibility, because at this

point respondents have made only the most general sugges-tions of "misconduct."

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice White and
Justice Blackmun join, dissenting.

After Congress authorized a major amnesty program in
1986, the Government promulgated two regulations severely
restricting access to that program. If valid, each regulationwould have rendered ineligible for amnesty the members of

the respective classes of respondents in this case. The Gov-ernment, of course, no longer defends either regulation.
See ante, at 48, 52. Nevertheless, one of the regulationswas in effect for all but 12 days of the period in which applications for legalization were accepted; the other, for over halfof that period. See

ante, at 48, 50-51. Accordingly, after
holding the regulations invalid, the District Courts entered
orders extending the time for filing applications for certain
class members. See ante, at 48-49, 52.

On appeal, the Government argued that the District
Courts lacked jurisdiction both to entertain the actions and
to provide remedies in the form of extended application periods. The Court of Appeals rejected the first argument on
the authority of our decision in McNary v. Haitian Refugee
Center, Inc., 498 U. S. 479 (1991). Catholic Social Services,
Inc. v. Thornburgh, 956 F. 2d 914, 919-921 (CA9 1992). As
the Court holds today, ante, at 53-56, that ruling was plainly
correct. The Court of Appeals also correctly rejected the
second argument advanced by the Government, noting that
extension of the filing deadline effectuated Congress' intent
to provide "meaningful opportunities to apply for adjustments of status," which would otherwise have been frustrated by enforcement of the invalid regulations. 956 F. 2d,
at 921-922. We should, accordingly, affirm the judgment of
the Court of Appeals.

This Court, however, finds a basis for prolonging the litigation on a theory that was not argued in either the District

Courts or the Court of Appeals, and was barely mentionedin this Court: that respondents' challenges are not, for the

most part, "ripe" for adjudication. Ante, at 57-61. I agreewith

Justice O'Connor, ante, p. 67 (opinion concurring injudgment), that the Court's rationale is seriously flawed.

Unlike Justice O'Connor, however, see ante, at 73, I haveno doubt that respondents' claims were ripe as soon as the
concededly invalid regulations were promulgated.Our test for ripeness is two pronged, "requiring us to evaluate both the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and thehardship to the parties of withholding court consideration."
Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U. S. 136, 149 (1967).Whether an issue is fit for judicial review, in turn, often depends on "the degree and nature of [a] regulation's presenteffect on those seeking relief,"

Toilet Goods Assn., Inc. v.Gardner, 387 U. S. 158, 164 (1967), or, put differently, on

whether there has been some "concrete action applying theregulation to the claimant's situation in a fashion that harms
or threatens to harm him," Lujan v. National Wildlife Federation, 497 U. S. 871, 891 (1990). As Justice O'Connornotes, we have returned to this two-part test for ripeness

time and again, see ante, at 71, and there is no question butthat the Abbott Laboratories formulation should govern

this case.As to the first Abbott Laboratories factor, I think it clear
that the challenged regulations have an impact on respond-ents sufficiently "direct and immediate," 387 U. S., at 152,
that they are fit for judicial review. My opinion rests, inpart, on the unusual character of the amnesty program in
question. As we explained in McNary:

"The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986(Reform Act) constituted a major statutory response to

the vast tide of illegal immigration that had produced a`shadow population' of literally millions of undocumented aliens in the United States. . . . [I]n recognitionthat a large segment of the shadow population played a

useful and constructive role in the American economy,but continued to reside in perpetual fear, the Reform

Act established two broad amnesty programs to allowexisting undocumented aliens to emerge from the shadows." 498 U. S., at 481-483 (footnotes omitted).1
A major purpose of this ambitious effort was to eliminatethe fear in which these immigrants lived, " `afraid to seek

help when their rights are violated, when they are victimizedby criminals, employers or landlords or when they become
ill.' " Ayuda, Inc. v. Thornburgh, 292 U. S. App. D. C. 150,168, 948 F. 2d 742, 760 (1991) (Wald, J., dissenting) (quoting
H. R. Rep. No. 99-682, pt. 1, p. 49 (1986)). Indeed, in recog-nition of this fear of governmental authority, Congress established a special procedure through which "qualified desig-nated entities," or "QDE's," would serve as a channel of
communication between undocumented aliens and the INS,providing reasonable assurance that "emergence from the
shadows" would result in amnesty and not deportation. 8U. S. C. $ 1255a(c)(2); see

Ayuda, 292 U. S. App. D. C., at 168,and n. 1, 948 F. 2d, at 760, and n. 1.

Under these circumstances, official advice that specifiedaliens were ineligible for amnesty was certain to convince
those aliens to retain their "shadow" status rather than comeforward. At the moment that decision was made--at the
moment respondents conformed their behavior to the invalidregulations--those regulations concretely and directly affected respondents, consigning them to the shadow worldfrom which the Reform Act was designed to deliver them,
and threatening to deprive them of the statutory entitlementthat would otherwise be theirs.

(concrete application threatening harm as basis for ripeness).

1 This case involves the first, and more important, of the two amnesty
programs; McNary involved the second.

2 As the majority explains, the classes certified in both actions were

limited to persons otherwise eligible for legalization. See ante, at 47-

80 RENO v. CATHOLIC SOCIAL SERVICES, INC.

Stevens, J., dissenting
The majority concedes, of course, that class memberswhose applications were "front-desked" felt the effects of the

invalid regulations concretely, because their applicationswere "blocked then and there." See

ante, at 63. Why
"then and there," as opposed to earlier and elsewhere, should
be dispositive remains unclear to me; whether a potentialapplication is thwarted by a front-desk Legalization Assistant, by advice from a QDE, by consultation with a privateattorney, or even by word of mouth regarding INS policies,
the effect on the potential applicant is equally concrete, andequally devastating. In my view, there is no relevant difference, for purposes of ripeness, between respondents whowere "front-desked" and those who can demonstrate, like the
LULAC class, that they " `learned of their ineligibility following promulgation of the policy and who, relying upon in-formation that they were ineligible, did not apply,' "

ante, at
51, or, like the class granted relief in CSS, that they " `knewof [the INS'] unlawful regulation and thereby concluded that

they were ineligible for legalization and by reason of thatconclusion did not file an application,' "

ante, at 48-49. As
Judge Wald explained in Ayuda:

"[T]he majority admits that if low level INS officials
had refused outright to accept legalization applicationsfor filing, the district court could hear the suit. Even if

the plaintiffs' affidavits are read to allege active discour-agement rather than outright refusal to accept, this is a
subtle distinction indeed, and one undoubtedly lost on
the illegal aliens involved, upon which to grant or denyjurisdiction to challenge the practice." 292 U. S. App.

D. C., at 169, n. 3, 948 F. 2d, at 761, n. 3 (dissenting opinion) (citation omitted).

The second Abbott Laboratories factor, which focuses on
the cost to the parties of withholding judicial review, also
weighs heavily in favor of ripeness in this case. Every day
during which the invalid regulations were effective meant

Stevens, J., dissenting
another day spent in the shadows for respondents, with the
attendant costs of that way of life. See supra, at 78-79.
Even more important, with each passing day, the clock on
the application period continued to run, increasing the risk
that review, when it came, would be meaningless because
the application period had already expired. See Ayuda, 292
U. S. App. D. C., at 178, 948 F. 2d, at 770 (Wald, J., dissenting).3 Indeed, the dilemma respondents find themselves in
today speaks volumes about the costs of deferring review
in this situation. Cf. Toilet Goods Assn., 387 U. S., at 164
(challenge not ripe where "no irremediable adverse consequences flow from requiring a later challenge").

Under Abbott Laboratories, then, I think it plain that respondents' claims were ripe for adjudication at the time they
were filed. The Court's contrary holding, which seems to
rest on the premise that respondents cannot challenge a condition of legalization until they have satisfied all other conditions, see ante, at 58-59, is at odds not only with our ripeness
case law, but also with our more general understanding of
the way in which government regulation affects the regulated. In Northeastern Fla. Chapter, Associated Gen. Contractors of America v. Jacksonville, 508 U. S. 656 (1993), for
instance, we held that a class of contractors could challenge
an ordinance making it more difficult for them to compete
for public business without making any showing that class
members were actually in a position to receive such business,

3 "Absent judicial action, the period for filing for IRCA legalization
would have ended and thousands of persons would have lost their chance
for amnesty. In purely human terms, it is difficult--perhaps impossible--
for those of us fortunate enough to have been born in this country to
appreciate fully the value of that lost opportunity. For undocumented
aliens, IRCA offered a one-time chance to come out of hiding, to stop
running, to `belong' to America. The hardship of withholding judicial review is as severe as any that I have encountered in more than a decade of
administrative review." 292 U. S. App. D. C., at 178, 948 F. 2d, at 770
(Wald, J., dissenting).

absent the challenged regulation. We announced the follow-ing rule:

"When the government erects a barrier that makes itmore difficult for members of one group to obtain a benefit than it is for members of another group, a memberof the former group seeking to challenge the barrier
need not allege that he would have obtained the benefitbut for the barrier in order to establish standing. The
`injury in fact' in an equal protection case of this varietyis the denial of equal treatment resulting from the imposition of the barrier, not the ultimate inability to obtainthe benefit."

Id., at 666.4

Our decision in the Jacksonville case is well supported byprecedent; the Court's ripeness holding today is notable for

its originality.Though my approach to the ripeness issue differs from
that of Justice O'Connor, we are in agreement in conclud-ing that respondents' claims are ripe for adjudication. We
also agree that the validity of the relief provided by the Dis-trict Courts, in the form of extended application periods,
turns on whether that remedy is consistent with congres-sional intent. See

ante, at 76 (opinion concurring in judg-ment); American Pipe & Constr. Co. v. Utah, 414 U. S. 538,

557-558 (1974) (equitable relief must be "consonant with thelegislative scheme");

Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, 456U. S. 305, 313 (1982) (courts retain broad equity powers to

enter remedial orders absent clear statutory restriction);INS v. Pangilinan, 486 U. S. 875, 883 (1988) (courts of equity
bound by statutory requirements). Where I differ from

4 Jacksonville is, of course, an equal protection case, while respondents
in this case are seeking a statutory benefit. If this distinction has any
relevance to a ripeness analysis, then it should mitigate in favor of finding
ripeness here; I assume we should be more reluctant to overcome jurisdictional hurdles to decide constitutional issues than to effectuate statutory
programs.

Justice O'Connor is in my determination that extensionsof the application period in this case were entirely consistent

with legislative intent, and hence well within the authorityof the District Courts.

It is no doubt true that "[w]hen Congress passes a benefits
statute that includes a time period, it has two goals." See
ante, at 76 (opinion concurring in judgment). Here, Congress' two goals were finality in its one-time amnesty pro-gram, and the integration of productive aliens into the American mainstream. See Perales v. Thornburgh, 967 F. 2d 798,813 (CA2 1992). To balance both ends, and to achieve each,
Congress settled on a 12-month application period. Twelve
months, Congress determined, would be long enough for
frightened aliens to come to understand the program and to
step forward with applications, especially when the full period was combined with the special outreach efforts mandated by the Reform Act. Ibid.; see 8 U. S. C. $ 1255a(i) (requiring broad dissemination of information about amnesty
program); $ 1255a(c)(2) (establishing QDE's). The generous
12-month period would also serve the goal of finality, by
" `ensur[ing] true resolution of the problem and . . . that the
program will be a one-time-only program.' " 967 F. 2d, at
813 (quoting H. R. Rep. No. 99-682, pt. 1, at 72.

The problem, of course, is that the full 12-month period
was never made available to respondents. For the CSS
class, the 12-month period shrank to precisely 12 days during
which they were eligible for legalization; for the LULAC
class, to roughly 5 months. See supra, at 77. Accordingly,
congressional intent required an extension of the filing deadline, in order to make effective the 12-month application period critical to the balance struck by Congress. See 956
F. 2d, at 922; Perales, 967 F. 2d, at 813.

That congressional intent is furthered, not frustrated, by
the equitable relief granted here distinguishes this case from
Pangilinan, in which we held that a court lacked the authority to order naturalization for certain persons after expira509us1100I 05-09-97 08:11:12 PAGES OPINPGT

tion of a statutory deadline. 486 U. S., at 882-885. In Pan-gilinan, we were faced with a "congressional command [that]

could not be more manifest" specifically precluding the reliefgranted. Id., at 884. The Reform Act, on the other hand,
contains no such explicit limitation.5 Indeed, the ReformAct does not itself contain a statutory deadline at all, leaving
it largely to the Attorney General to delineate a 12-monthperiod. 8 U. S. C. $ 1255a(a)(1)(A). This delegation highlights the relative insignificance to Congress of the applica-tion cutoff date, as opposed to the length of the application
period itself. See Perales, 967 F. 2d, at 813, n. 4.Finally, I can see no reason to limit otherwise available
relief to those class members who experienced "front-desking," on the theory that they have "applied" for legalization. Cf. ante, at 67, n. 29; ante, at 76-77 (O'Connor, J.,concurring in judgment). It makes no sense to condition relief on the filing of a futile application. Indeed, we have al-ready rejected the proposition that such an application is
necessary for receipt of an equitable remedy. In Teamstersv. United States, 431 U. S. 324 (1977), a case involving discriminatory employment practices under Title VII of theCivil Rights Act of 1964, we held that those who had been
deterred from applying for jobs by an employer's practiceof rejecting applicants like themselves were eligible for relief along with those who had unsuccessfully applied. Wereasoned:

"A consistently enforced discriminatory policy cansurely deter job applications from those who are aware
of it and are unwilling to subject themselves to thehumiliation of explicit and certain rejection.

5 There is no language in the Reform Act prohibiting an extension of the
application period. Section 1255a(f)(2), relied on by the Government, see
Brief for Petitioners 28-29, precludes review of individual late-filed applications; like $ 1255a(f)(1), it has no bearing on the kind of broad-based
challenge and remedy at issue here. See ante, at 55, and n. 17; ante, at
73-74 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment).

". . . When a person's desire for a job is not translatedinto a formal application solely because of his unwillingness to engage in a futile gesture he is as much a victimof discrimination as is he who goes through the motions
of submitting an application." 431 U. S., at 365-366.
The same intelligent principle should control this case. Arespondent who can show that she would have applied for

legalization but for the invalid regulations is "in a positionanalogous to that of an applicant," and entitled to the same
relief. See id., at 368.In my view, then, the Court of Appeals was correct on
both counts when it affirmed the District Court orders inthis case: Respondents' claims were justiciable when filed,
and the relief ordered did not exceed the authority of theDistrict Courts. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.

HARPER et al. v. VIRGINIA DEPARTMENT OF

TAXATION

certiorari to the supreme court of virginia
No. 91-794. Argued December 2, 1992--Decided June 18, 1993
In Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U. S. 803, this Court invalidated Michigan's practice of taxing retirement benefits paid by the Federal Government while exempting retirement benefits paid by the State
or its political subdivisions. Because Michigan conceded that a refund
to federal retirees was the appropriate remedy, the Court remanded for
entry of judgment against the State. Virginia subsequently amended
a similar statute that taxed federal retirees while exempting state and
local retirees. Petitioners, federal civil service and military retirees,
sought a refund of taxes assessed by Virginia before the revision of this
statute. Applying the factors set forth in Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson,
404 U. S. 97, 106-107, a state trial court denied relief to petitioners as
to all taxable events occurring before Davis was decided. In affirming,
the Virginia Supreme Court concluded that Davis should not be applied
retroactively under Chevron Oil and American Trucking Assns., Inc.
v. Smith, 496 U. S. 167 (plurality opinion). It also held, as matters of
state law, that the assessments were neither erroneous nor improper
and that a decision declaring a tax scheme unconstitutional has solely
prospective effect. In James B. Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia, 501
U. S. 529, however, six Members of this Court required the retroactive
application of Bacchus Imports, Ltd. v. Dias, 468 U. S. 263--which prohibited States from imposing higher excise taxes on imported alcoholic
beverages than on locally produced beverages--to claims arising from
facts predating that decision. Those Justices disagreed with the Georgia Supreme Court's use of Chevron Oil's retroactivity analysis. After
this Court ordered reevaluation of petitioners' suit in light of Beam, the
Virginia Supreme Court reaffirmed its decision in all respects. It held
that Beam did not foreclose the use of Chevron Oil's analysis because
Davis did not decide whether its rule applied retroactively.

Held:

1. When this Court applies a rule of federal law to the parties before
it, that rule is the controlling interpretation of federal law and must be
given full retroactive effect in all cases still open on direct review and
as to all events, regardless of whether such events predate or postdate
the announcement of the rule. Pp. 94-99.

(a) This rule fairly reflects the position of a majority of Justices in
Beam and extends to civil cases the ban against "selective application
of new rules" in criminal cases. Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314,
323. Mindful of the "basic norms of constitutional adjudication" animating the Court's view of retroactivity in criminal cases, id., at 322--that
the nature of judicial review strips the Court of the quintessentially
legislative prerogative to make rules of law retroactive or prospective
as it sees fit and that selective application of new rules violates the
principle of treating similarly situated parties the same, id., at 322,
323--the Court prohibits the erection of selective temporal barriers to
the application of federal law in noncriminal cases. When the Court
does not reserve the question whether its holding should be applied to
the parties before it, the opinion is properly understood to have followed
the normal rule of retroactive application, Beam, 501 U. S., at 540 (opinion of Souter, J.), and the legal imperative to apply such a rule prevails
"over any claim based on a Chevron Oil analysis," ibid. Pp. 94-98.

(b) This Court applied the rule of law announced in Davis to the
parties before the Court. The Court's response to Michigan's concession that a refund would be appropriate in Davis, far from reserving
the retroactivity question, constituted a retroactive application of the
rule. A decision to accord solely prospective effect to Davis would
have foreclosed any discussion of remedial issues. Pp. 98-99.

2. The decision below does not rest on independent and adequate
state-law grounds. In holding that state-law retroactivity doctrine permitted the solely prospective application of the ruling, the State Supreme Court simply incorporated into state law the analysis of Chevron
Oil and criminal retroactivity cases overruled by Griffith. The Supremacy Clause, however, does not allow federal retroactivity doctrine
to be supplanted by the invocation of a contrary approach to retroactivity under state law. Similarly, the state court's conclusion that the challenged assessments were not erroneous or improper under state law
rested solely on its determination that Davis did not apply retroactively. Pp. 99-100.

3. Virginia is free to choose the form of relief it will provide, so long
as that relief is consistent with federal due process principles. A State
retains flexibility in responding to the determination that it has imposed
an impermissibly discriminatory tax. The availability of a predeprivation hearing constitutes a procedural safeguard sufficient to satisfy due
process, but if no such relief exists, the State must provide meaningful
backward-looking relief either by awarding full refunds or by issuing
some other order that creates in hindsight a nondiscriminatory scheme.
Since any remedy's constitutional sufficiency turns (at least initially) on
whether Virginia law provides an adequate form of predeprivation proc509us1101L 05-04-97 16:52:44 PAGES OPINPGT

taxes imposed before Davis was decided. In accord withGriffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314 (1987), and James B.

Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia, 501 U. S. 529 (1991), we holdthat this Court's application of a rule of federal law to the
parties before the Court requires every court to give retro-active effect to that decision. We therefore reverse.

I
The Michigan tax scheme at issue in Davis "exempt[ed]from taxation all retirement benefits paid by the State or its

political subdivisions, but levie[d] an income tax on retire-ment benefits paid by . . . the Federal Government." 489
U. S., at 805. We held that the United States had not con-sented under 4 U. S. C. $ 111

1 to this discriminatory imposition of a heavier tax burden on federal benefits than on stateand local benefits. 489 U. S., at 808-817. Because Michigan

"conceded that a refund [was] appropriate," we recognizedthat federal retirees were entitled to a refund of taxes "paid
. . . pursuant to this invalid tax scheme." Id., at 817.2Like Michigan, Virginia exempted state and local employees' retirement benefits from state income taxation whiletaxing federal retirement benefits. Va. Code Ann. $ 58.1-
322(c)(3) (Supp. 1988). In response to Davis, Virginia re-pealed its exemption for state and local government employees. 1989 Va. Acts, Special Sess. II, ch. 3. It also enacteda special statute of limitations for refund claims made in light
of Davis. Under this statute, taxpayers may seek a refund

1 "The United States consents to the taxation of pay or compensation
for personal service as an officer or employee of the United States . . . by
a duly constituted taxing authority having jurisdiction, if the taxation does
not discriminate against the officer or employee because of the source of
the pay or compensation." 4 U. S. C. $ 111.

2 We have since followed Davis and held that a State violates intergovernmental tax immunity and 4 U. S. C. $ 111 when it "taxes the benefits
received from the United States by military retirees but does not tax
the benefits received by retired state and local government employees."

Petitioners, 421 federal civil service and military retirees,
sought a refund of taxes "erroneously or improperly assessed" in violation of Davis' nondiscrimination principle.
Va. Code Ann. $ 58.1-1826 (1991). The trial court denied
relief. Law No. CL891080 (Va. Cir. Ct., Mar. 12, 1990).
Applying the factors set forth in Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson,
supra, at 106-107,4 the court reasoned that "Davis decided
an issue of first impression whose resolution was not clearly
foreshadowed," that "prospective application of Davis will
not retard its operation," and that "retroactive application
would result in inequity, injustice and hardship." App. to
Pet. for Cert. 20a.

The Supreme Court of Virginia affirmed. Harper v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation, 241 Va. 232, 401 S. E. 2d 868 (1991).
It too concluded, after consulting Chevron and the plurality
opinion in American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, 496
U. S. 167 (1990), that "the Davis decision is not to be applied
retroactively." 241 Va., at 240, 401 S. E. 2d, at 873. The
court also rejected petitioners' contention that "refunds

3 Applications for tax refunds generally must be made within three
years of the assessment. Va. Code Ann. $ 58.1-1825 (1991). As of the
date we decided Davis, this statute of limitations would have barred all
actions seeking refunds from taxes imposed before 1985.

4 "First, the decision to be applied nonretroactively must establish a new

principle of law, either by overruling clear past precedent on which litigants may have relied, or by deciding an issue of first impression whose
resolution was not clearly foreshadowed. Second, it has been stressed
that `we must . . . weigh the merits and demerits in each case by looking to the prior history of the rule in question, its purpose and effect,
and whether retrospective operation will further or retard its operation.'
Finally, we have weighed the inequity imposed by retroactive application . . . ." Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, 404 U. S., at 106-107 (citations

[were] due as a matter of state law." Ibid. It concluded
that "because the Davis decision is not to be applied retroactively, the pre-Davis assessments were neither erroneous
nor improper" under Virginia's tax refund statute. Id., at
241, 401 S. E. 2d, at 873. As a matter of Virginia law, the
court held, a "ruling declaring a taxing scheme unconstitutional is to be applied prospectively only." Ibid. This
rationale supplied "another reason" for refusing relief.
Ibid.

Even as the Virginia courts were denying relief to petitioners, we were confronting a similar retroactivity problem
in James B. Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia, 501 U. S. 529
(1991). At issue was Bacchus Imports, Ltd. v. Dias, 468
U. S. 263 (1984), which prohibited States from imposing
higher excise taxes on imported alcoholic beverages than on
local products. The Supreme Court of Georgia had used the
analysis described in Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson to deny retroactive effect to a decision of this Court. Six Members of
this Court disagreed, concluding instead that Bacchus must
be applied retroactively to claims arising from facts predating that decision. Beam, 501 U. S., at 532 (opinion of Souter, J.); id., at 544-545 (White, J., concurring in judgment);
id., at 547-548 (Blackmun, J., concurring in judgment);
id., at 548-549 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment). After
deciding Beam, we vacated the judgment in Harper and
remanded for further consideration. 501 U. S. 1247 (1991).

On remand, the Supreme Court of Virginia again denied
tax relief. 242 Va. 322, 410 S. E. 2d 629 (1991). It reasoned
that because Michigan did not contest the Davis plaintiffs'
entitlement to a refund, this Court "made no . . . ruling"
regarding the retroactive application of its rule "to the litigants in that case." 242 Va., at 326, 410 S. E. 2d, at 631.
Concluding that Beam did not foreclose application of Chevron's retroactivity analysis because "the retroactivity issue
was not decided in Davis," 242 Va., at 326, 410 S. E. 2d, at

631, the court "reaffirm[ed] [its] prior decision in all re-spects," id., at 327, 410 S. E. 2d, at 632.

When we decided Davis, 23 States gave preferential taxtreatment to benefits received by employees of state and
local governments relative to the tax treatment of benefitsreceived by federal employees.

5 Like the Supreme Court of

Virginia, several other state courts have refused to accordfull retroactive effect to

Davis as a controlling statementof federal law.
6 Two of the courts refusing to apply Davis

retroactively have done so after this Court remanded for re-consideration in light of

Beam. See Bass v. South Carolina,

Lewy v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation,
decided with Harper v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation, 501 U. S.1247 (1991). By contrast, the Supreme Court of Arkansas

has concluded as a matter of federal law that Davis applies
retroactively. Pledger v. Bosnick, 306 Ark. 45, 54-56, 811S. W. 2d 286, 292-293 (1991), cert. pending, No. 91-375.

"[B]oth the common law and our own decisions" have "rec-ognized a general rule of retrospective effect for the constitutional decisions of this Court." Robinson v. Neil, 409U. S. 505, 507 (1973). Nothing in the Constitution alters the

618 (1965), however, we developed a doctrine under whichwe could deny retroactive effect to a newly announced rule
of criminal law. Under Linkletter, a decision to confine anew rule to prospective application rested on the purpose of
the new rule, the reliance placed upon the previous view ofthe law, and "the effect on the administration of justice of a
retrospective application" of the new rule. Id., at 636 (limit-ing

Cipriano v. City of Houma, 395
U. S. 701, 706 (1969)).9We subsequently overruled

Linkletter in Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314 (1987), and eliminated limits on retro-activity in the criminal context by holding that all "newly

declared . . . rule[s]" must be applied retroactively to all
"criminal cases pending on direct review." Id., at 322.This holding rested on two "basic norms of constitutional

adjudication." Ibid. First, we reasoned that "the natureof judicial review" strips us of the quintessentially "legislat[ive]" prerogative to make rules of law retroactive or pro-spective as we see fit.

Ibid. Second, we concluded that
"selective application of new rules violates the principle oftreating similarly situated [parties] the same."

Id., at 323.
Dicta in Griffith, however, stated that "civil retroactivity
. . . . continue[d] to be governed by the standard announced
in Chevron Oil." Id., at 322, n. 8. We divided over the
meaning of this dicta in American Trucking Assns., Inc. v.
Smith, 496 U. S. 167 (1990). The four Justices in the plurality used "the Chevron Oil test" to consider whether to confine "the application of [American Trucking Assns., Inc. v.
Scheiner, 483 U. S. 266 (1987),] to taxation of highway use
prior to June 23, 1987, the date we decided Scheiner." Id.,

9 We need not debate whether Chevron Oil represents a true "choice-oflaw principle" or merely "a remedial principle for the exercise of equitable
discretion by federal courts." American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith,
496 U. S. 167, 220 (1990) (Stevens, J., dissenting). Compare id., at 191-
197 (plurality opinion) (treating Chevron Oil as a choice-of-law rule), with
id., at 218-224 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (treating Chevron Oil as a remedial doctrine). Regardless of how Chevron Oil is characterized, our decision today makes it clear that "the Chevron Oil test cannot determine the
choice of law by relying on the equities of the particular case" and that
the federal law applicable to a particular case does not turn on "whether
[litigants] actually relied on [an] old rule [or] how they would suffer from
retroactive application" of a new one. James B. Beam Distilling Co. v.
Georgia, 501 U. S. 529, 543 (1991) (opinion of Souter, J.).

Opinion of the Court
at 179 (opinion of O'Connor, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J.,and

White and Kennedy, JJ.). Four other Justices rejected the plurality's "anomalous approach" to retroactivityand declined to hold that "the law applicable to a particular

case is that law which the parties believe in good faith to be
applicable to the case." Id., at 219 (Stevens, J., dissenting,joined by Brennan, Marshall, and

Blackmun, JJ.). Finally,
despite concurring in the judgment, Justice Scalia"share[d]" the dissent's "perception that prospective decisionmaking is incompatible with the judicial role." Id., at201.

Griffith and American Trucking thus left unresolved the
precise extent to which the presumptively retroactive effect
of this Court's decisions may be altered in civil cases. But
we have since adopted a rule requiring the retroactive application of a civil decision such as Davis. Although James B.
Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia, 501 U. S. 529 (1991), did not
produce a unified opinion for the Court, a majority of Justices
agreed that a rule of federal law, once announced and applied
to the parties to the controversy, must be given full retroactive effect by all courts adjudicating federal law. In announcing the judgment of the Court, Justice Souter laid
down a rule for determining the retroactive effect of a civil
decision: After the case announcing any rule of federal law
has "appl[ied] that rule with respect to the litigants" before
the court, no court may "refuse to apply [that] rule . . . retroactively." Id., at 540 (opinion of Souter, J., joined by Stevens, J.). Justice Souter's view of retroactivity superseded "any claim based on a Chevron Oil analysis." Ibid.
Justice White likewise concluded that a decision "extending the benefit of the judgment" to the winning party "is to
be applied to other litigants whose cases were not final at
the time of the [first] decision." Id., at 544 (opinion concurring in judgment). Three other Justices agreed that "our
judicial responsibility . . . requir[es] retroactive application
of each . . . rule we announce." Id., at 548 (Blackmun, J.,

joined by Marshall and Scalia, JJ., concurring in judgment).See also

id., at 548-549 (Scalia, J., joined by Marshall and
Blackmun, JJ., concurring in judgment).

Beam controls this case, and we accordingly adopt a rule
that fairly reflects the position of a majority of Justices in
Beam: When this Court applies a rule of federal law to theparties before it, that rule is the controlling interpretation

of federal law and must be given full retroactive effect in allcases still open on direct review and as to all events, regardless of whether such events predate or postdate our an-nouncement of the rule. This rule extends

Griffith's ban
against "selective application of new rules." 479 U. S., at
323. Mindful of the "basic norms of constitutional adjudication" that animated our view of retroactivity in the criminal
context, id., at 322, we now prohibit the erection of selective
temporal barriers to the application of federal law in noncriminal cases. In both civil and criminal cases, we can
scarcely permit "the substantive law [to] shift and spring"
according to "the particular equities of [individual parties']
claims" of actual reliance on an old rule and of harm from a
retroactive application of the new rule. Beam, supra, at 543
(opinion of Souter, J.). Our approach to retroactivity heeds
the admonition that "[t]he Court has no more constitutional
authority in civil cases than in criminal cases to disregard
current law or to treat similarly situated litigants differently." American Trucking, supra, at 214 (Stevens, J.,
dissenting).

The Supreme Court of Virginia "appl[ied] the threepronged Chevron Oil test in deciding the retroactivity issue"
presented by this litigation. 242 Va., at 326, 410 S. E. 2d,
at 631. When this Court does not "reserve the question
whether its holding should be applied to the parties before
it," however, an opinion announcing a rule of federal law "is
properly understood to have followed the normal rule of retroactive application" and must be "read to hold . . . that its
rule should apply retroactively to the litigants then before

id., at 544-545 (White, J., concurring in judgment);
id., at 550 (O'Connor, J., dissenting). Furthermore, thelegal imperative "to apply a rule of federal law retroactively

after the case announcing the rule has already done so" must
"prevai[l] over any claim based on a Chevron Oil analysis."
Id., at 540 (opinion of Souter, J.).

In an effort to distinguish Davis, the Supreme Court ofVirginia surmised that this Court had "made no . . . ruling"

about the application of the rule announced in Davis "retro-actively to the litigants in that case." 242 Va., at 326, 410
S. E. 2d, at 631. "[B]ecause the retroactivity issue was not
decided in Davis," the court believed that it was "not foreclosed by precedent from applying the three-pronged Chevron Oil test in deciding the retroactivity issue in the present
case." Ibid.

We disagree. Davis did not hold that preferential state
tax treatment of state and local employee pensions, though
constitutionally invalid in the future, should be upheld as to
all events predating the announcement of Davis. The governmental appellee in Davis "conceded that a refund [would
have been] appropriate" if we were to conclude that "the
Michigan Income Tax Act violate[d] principles of intergovernmental tax immunity by favoring retired state and local
governmental employees over retired federal employees."
489 U. S., at 817. We stated that "to the extent appellant
has paid taxes pursuant to this invalid tax scheme, he is entitled to a refund." Ibid. Far from reserving the retroactivity question, our response to the appellee's concession constituted a retroactive application of the rule announced in
Davis to the parties before the Court. Because a decision
to accord solely prospective effect to Davis would have foreclosed any discussion of remedial issues, our "consideration
of remedial issues" meant "necessarily" that we retroactively
applied the rule we announced in Davis to the litigants
before us. Beam, supra, at 539 (opinion of Souter, J.).

Opinion of the Court
Therefore, under Griffith, Beam, and the retroactivity ap-proach we adopt today, the Supreme Court of Virginia must

apply Davis in petitioners' refund action.

III
Respondent Virginia Department of Taxation defends thejudgment below as resting on an independent and adequate

state ground that relieved the Supreme Court of Virginia ofany obligation to apply

Davis to events occurring before ourannouncement of that decision. Petitioners had contended

that "even if the Davis decision applie[d] prospectively only,"they were entitled to relief under Virginia's tax refund statute, Va. Code Ann. $ 58.1-1826 (1991). Harper v. Virginia
Dept. of Taxation, 241 Va., at 241, 401 S. E. 2d, at 873. TheVirginia court rejected their argument. It first reasoned

that because Davis did not apply retroactively, tax assess-ments predating

Davis were "neither erroneous nor im-proper within the meaning" of Virginia's tax statute. Ibid.

The court then offered "another reason" for rejecting peti-tioners' "state-law contention": "We previously have held
that this Court's ruling declaring a taxing scheme unconsti-tutional is to be applied prospectively only." Ibid. (citing
Perkins v. Albemarle County, 214 Va. 240, 198 S. E. 2d 626,aff 'd and modified on rehearing, 214 Va. 416, 200 S. E. 2d 566
(1973); Capehart v. City of Chesapeake, No. 5459 (Va. Cir.Ct., Oct. 16, 1974), appeal denied, 215 Va. xlvii, cert. denied,
423 U. S. 875 (1975)). The formulation of this state-law ret-roactivity doctrine--that "consideration should be given to
the purpose of the new rule, the extent of the reliance on theold rule, and the effect on the administration of justice of a
retroactive application of the new rule," Fountain v. Foun-tain, 214 Va. 347, 348, 200 S. E. 2d 513, 514 (1973), cert. denied, 416 U. S. 939 (1974), quoted in 241 Va., at 241, 401S. E. 2d, at 874--suggests that the Supreme Court of Virginia has simply incorporated into state law the three-pronged analysis of Chevron Oil, 404 U. S., at 106-107, and

Opinion of the Court
the criminal retroactivity cases overruled by Griffith, see,
e. g., Stovall v. Denno, 388 U. S. 293, 297 (1967).

We reject the department's defense of the decision below.The Supremacy Clause, U. S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2, does not

allow federal retroactivity doctrine to be supplanted by the
invocation of a contrary approach to retroactivity understate law. Whatever freedom state courts may enjoy to

limit the retroactive operation of their own interpretationsof state law, see

Great Northern R. Co. v. Sunburst Oil &
Refining Co., 287 U. S. 358, 364-366 (1932), cannot extendto their interpretations of federal law. See

National Mines
Corp. v. Caryl, 497 U. S. 922, 923 (1990) (per curiam); Ashland Oil, Inc. v. Caryl, 497 U. S. 916, 917 (1990) (per
curiam).

We also decline the Department of Taxation's invitation to
affirm the judgment as resting on the independent and adequate ground that Virginia's law of remedies offered no "retrospective refund remedy for taxable years concluded before
Davis" was announced. Brief for Respondent 33. The Virginia Supreme Court's conclusion that the challenged tax assessments were "neither erroneous nor improper within the
meaning" of the refund statute rested solely on the court's
determination that Davis did not apply retroactively.
Harper v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation, supra, at 241, 401
S. E. 2d, at 873.

Because we have decided that Davis applies retroactively
to the tax years at issue in petitioners' refund action, we
reverse the judgment below. We do not enter judgment for
petitioners, however, because federal law does not necessarily entitle them to a refund. Rather, the Constitution requires Virginia "to provide relief consistent with federal due
process principles." American Trucking, 496 U. S., at 181
(plurality opinion). Under the Due Process Clause, U. S.
Const., Amdt. 14, $ 1, "a State found to have imposed an impermissibly discriminatory tax retains flexibility in responding to this determination." McKesson Corp. v. Division of

Opinion of the Court
Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, Fla. Dept. of Business
Regulation, 496 U. S. 18, 39-40 (1990). If Virginia "offers a
meaningful opportunity for taxpayers to withhold contestedtax assessments and to challenge their validity in a predeprivation hearing," the "availability of a predeprivation hearing
constitutes a procedural safeguard . . . sufficient by itself tosatisfy the Due Process Clause."

Id., at 38, n. 21. On the
other hand, if no such predeprivation remedy exists, "theDue Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment obligates

the State to provide meaningful backward-looking relief torectify any unconstitutional deprivation."

Id., at 31 (footnotes omitted).10 In providing such relief, a State mayeither award full refunds to those burdened by an unlawful

tax or issue some other order that "create[s] in hindsighta nondiscriminatory scheme."

Id., at 40. Cf. Davis, 489
U. S., at 818 (suggesting that a State's failure to respectintergovernmental tax immunity could be cured "either by

extending [a discriminatory] tax exemption to retired federal
employees . . . or by eliminating the exemption for retired

state and local government employees").

The constitutional sufficiency of any remedy thus turns (at
least initially) on whether Virginia law "provide[s] a[n] [adequate] form of `predeprivation process,' for example, by authorizing taxpayers to bring suit to enjoin imposition of a tax

10 A State incurs this obligation when it "places a taxpayer under duress
promptly to pay a tax when due and relegates him to a postpayment refund action in which he can challenge the tax's legality." McKesson, 496
U. S., at 31. A State that "establish[es] various sanctions and summary
remedies designed" to prompt taxpayers to "tender . . . payments before
their objections are entertained and resolved" does not provide taxpayers
"a meaningful opportunity to withhold payment and to obtain a predeprivation determination of the tax assessment's validity." Id., at 38 (emphasis in original). Such limitations impose constitutionally significant " `duress' " because a tax payment rendered under these circumstances must
be treated as an effort "to avoid financial sanctions or a seizure of real or
personal property." Id., at 38, n. 21. The State accordingly may not confine a taxpayer under duress to prospective relief.

leave to Virginia courts this question of state law and theperformance of other tasks pertaining to the crafting of any
appropriate remedy. Virginia "is free to choose which formof relief it will provide, so long as that relief satisfies the

I am surprised to see an appeal to stare decisis in today'sdissent. In Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989),

Justice
O'Connor wrote for a plurality that openly rejected settledprecedent controlling the scope of retroactivity on collateral

review. "This retroactivity determination," the opinionsaid, "would normally entail application of the

Linkletter [v.Walker, 381 U. S. 618 (1965),] standard, but we believe that

our approach to retroactivity for cases on collateral reviewrequires modification." Id., at 301. The dissent in Teague
was a sort of anticipatory echo of today's dissent, criticizingthe plurality for displaying "infidelity to the doctrine of

staredecisis," id., at 331 (Brennan, J., dissenting), for "upset[ting]

. . . our time-honored precedents," id., at 333, for "repudiat-ing our familiar approach without regard for the doctrine of
stare decisis," id., at 345, and for failing "so much as [to]mention stare decisis," id., at 333.

I joined the plurality opinion in Teague. Not only did I
believe the rule it announced was correct, see Withrow v.
Williams, 507 U. S. 680, 717 (1993) (Scalia, J., concurring in
part and dissenting in part), but I also believed that abandonment of our prior collateral-review retroactivity rule was
fully in accord with the doctrine of stare decisis, which as
applied by our Court has never been inflexible. The Teague
plurality opinion set forth good reasons for abandoning Linkletter--reasons justifying a similar abandonment of Chevron
Oil Co. v. Huson, 404 U. S. 97 (1971). It noted, for example,
that Linkletter "ha[d] not led to consistent results," Teague,
supra, at 302; but neither has Chevron Oil. Proof that what
it means is in the eye of the beholder is provided quite nicely
by the separate opinions filed today: Of the four Justices who
would still apply Chevron Oil, two find Davis v. Michigan
Dept. of Treasury, 489 U. S. 803 (1989), retroactive, see post,
at 111 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in
judgment), two find it not retroactive, see post, at 122
(O'Connor, J., dissenting). Second, the Teague plurality
opinion noted that Linkletter had been criticized by commentators, Teague, supra, at 303; but the commentary cited in
the opinion criticized not just Linkletter, but the Court's retroactivity jurisprudence in general, of which it considered
Chevron Oil an integral part, see Beytagh, Ten Years of
Non-Retroactivity: A Critique and a Proposal, 61 Va. L. Rev.
1557, 1558, 1581-1582, 1606 (1975). Other commentary, of
course, has also regarded the issue of retroactivity as a general problem of jurisprudence. See, e. g., Fallon & Meltzer,
New Law, Non-Retroactivity, and Constitutional Remedies,
104 Harv. L. Rev. 1731 (1991); Schaefer, Prospective Rulings:
Two Perspectives, 1982 S. Ct. Rev. 1; Schaefer, The Control

Finally, the plurality opinion in Teague justified the depar-ture from Linkletter by implicitly relying on the well-settled

proposition that stare decisis has less force where inter-vening decisions "have removed or weakened the conceptual underpinnings from the prior decision." Patterson v.
McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 173 (1989). Justice
O'Connor endorsed the reasoning expressed by Justice Har-lan in his separate opinions in

Mackey v. United States,401 U. S. 667 (1971), and Desist v. United States, 394 U. S.

244 (1969), and noted that the Court had already adopted thefirst part of Justice Harlan's retroactivity views in Griffith
v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314 (1987). See Teague, supra, at303-305. Again, this argument equally--indeed, even more
forcefully--supports reconsideration of Chevron Oil. Griffith returned this Court, in criminal cases, to the traditionalview (which I shall discuss at greater length below) that

prospective decisionmaking "violates basic norms of consti-tutional adjudication." Griffith, supra, at 322. One of the
conceptual underpinnings of Chevron Oil was that retroac-tivity presents a

similar problem in both civil and criminalcontexts. See Chevron Oil, supra, at 106; see also Beytagh,

supra, at 1606. Thus, after Griffith, Chevron Oil can be ad-hered to only by rejecting the reasoning of Chevron Oil--
that is, only by asserting that the issue of retroactivity isdifferent in the civil and criminal settings. That is a particularly difficult proof to make, inasmuch as Griffith restedon "basic norms of constitutional adjudication" and "the nature of judicial review." 479 U. S., at 322; see also Teague,
supra, at 317 (White, J., concurring in part and concurringin judgment) (Griffith "appear[s] to have constitutional

underpinnings").1

1 The dissent attempts to distinguish between retroactivity in civil and
criminal settings on three grounds, none of which has ever been adopted
by this Court. The dissent's first argument begins with the observation that "nonretroactivity in criminal cases historically has favored
the government's reliance interests over the rights of criminal defend509us1101L 05-04-97 16:52:45 PAGES OPINPGT

What most provokes comment in the dissent, however, isnot its insistence that today a rigid doctrine of stare decisis

forbids tinkering with retroactivity, which four Terms agodid not; but rather the irony of its invoking stare decisis in
defense of prospective decisionmaking at all. Prospectivedecisionmaking is the handmaid of judicial activism, and
the born enemy of stare decisis. It was formulated in theheyday of legal realism and promoted as a "techniqu[e] of
judicial lawmaking" in general, and more specifically asa means of making it easier to overrule prior precedent.

ants." Post, at 121. But while it is true that prospectivity was usually
employed in the past (during the brief period when it was used in criminal
cases) to favor the government, there is no basis for the implicit suggestion that it would usually favor the government in the future. That phenomenon was a consequence, not of the nature of the doctrine, cf. James
v. United States, 366 U. S. 213 (1961), but of the historical "accident" that
during the period prospectivity was in fashion legal rules favoring the
government were more frequently overturned. But more fundamentally,
to base a rule of full retroactivity in the criminal-law area upon what
the dissent calls "the generalized policy of favoring individual rights over
governmental prerogative," post, at 121, makes no more sense than to
adopt, because of the same "generalized policy," a similarly gross rule that
no decision favoring criminal defendants can ever be overruled. The law
is more discerning than that. The dissent's next argument is based on
the dubious empirical assumption that civil litigants, but not criminal
defendants, will often receive some benefit from a prospective decision.
That assumption does not hold even in this case: Prospective invalidation
of Virginia's taxing scheme would afford petitioners the enormous future
"benefit," ibid., of knowing that others in the State are being taxed more.
But empirical problems aside, the dissent does not explain why, if a
receipt-of-some-benefit principle is important, we should use such an inaccurate proxy as the civil/criminal distinction, or how this newly discovered
principle overcomes the "basic norms of constitutional adjudication" on
which Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314, 322 (1987), rested. Finally, the
dissent's "equal treatment" argument ably distinguishes between cases in
which a prospectivity claim is properly raised, and those in which it is not.
See post, at 122. But that does nothing to distinguish between civil and
criminal cases; obviously, a party may procedurally default on a claim in
either context.

109 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1 (1960). Thus, the dissent is saying, ineffect, that

stare decisis demands the preservation of methods of destroying stare decisis recently invented in violationof

stare decisis.
Contrary to the dissent's assertion that Chevron Oil articulated "our traditional retroactivity analysis," post, at 113,the jurisprudence it reflects "came into being," as Justice

Harlan observed, less than 30 years ago with Linkletter v.
Walker, 381 U. S. 618 (1965). Mackey, supra, at 676. It is
so unancient that one of the current Members of this Courtwas sitting when it was invented. The true

traditional
view is that prospective decisionmaking is quite incompatible
with the judicial power, and that courts have no authority
to engage in the practice. See ante, at 94; James B. Beam
Distilling Co. v. Georgia, 501 U. S. 529, 534 (1991) (opinion of
Souter, J.); American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, 496
U. S. 167, 201 (1990) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment);
Desist, supra, at 258-259 (Harlan, J., dissenting); Great
Northern R. Co. v. Sunburst Oil & Refining Co., 287 U. S.
358, 365 (1932). Linkletter itself recognized that "[a]t common law there was no authority for the proposition that judicial decisions made law only for the future." 381 U. S., at
622-623. And before Linkletter, the academic proponents
of prospective judicial decisionmaking acknowledged that
their proposal contradicted traditional practice. See, e. g.,
Levy, supra, at 2, and n. 2; Carpenter, Court Decisions and

the Common Law, 17 Colum. L. Rev. 593, 594 (1917). Indeed, the roots of the contrary tradition are so deep that
Justice Holmes was prepared to hazard the guess that "[ j]udicial decisions have had retrospective operation for near a
thousand years." Kuhn v. Fairmont Coal Co., 215 U. S. 349,
372 (1910) (dissenting opinion).

Justice O'Connor asserts that " `[w]hen the Court
changes its mind, the law changes with it.' " Post, at 115
(quoting Beam, supra, at 550 (O'Connor, J., dissenting)).
That concept is quite foreign to the American legal and con509us1101L 05-04-97 16:52:45 PAGES OPINPGT

stitutional tradition. It would have struck John Marshall asan extraordinary assertion of raw power. The conception of

the judicial role that he possessed, and that was shared bysucceeding generations of American judges until very recent
times, took it to be "the province and duty of the judicial
department to say what the law is," Marbury v. Madison, 1Cranch 137, 177 (1803) (emphasis added)--not what the law

shall be. That original and enduring American perceptionof the judicial role sprang not from the philosophy of Nietzsche but from the jurisprudence of Blackstone, which viewedretroactivity as an inherent characteristic of the judicial
power, a power "not delegated to pronounce a new law, but
to maintain and expound the old one." 1 W. Blackstone,
Commentaries 69 (1765). Even when a "former determination is most evidently contrary to reason . . . [or] contrary to
the divine law," a judge overruling that decision would "not
pretend to make a new law, but to vindicate the old one from
misrepresentation." Id., at 69-70. "For if it be found that
the former decision is manifestly absurd or unjust, it is declared, not that such a sentence was bad law, but that it was
not law." Id., at 70 (emphases in original). Fully retroactive decisionmaking was considered a principal distinction
between the judicial and the legislative power: "[I]t is said
that that which distinguishes a judicial from a legislative act
is, that the one is a determination of what the existing law
is in relation to some existing thing already done or happened, while the other is a predetermination of what the law
shall be for the regulation of all future cases." T. Cooley,
Constitutional Limitations *91. The critics of the traditional rule of full retroactivity were well aware that it
was grounded in what one of them contemptuously called
"another fiction known as the Separation of powers."

a Proposal, 17 A. B. A. J. 180, 181 (1931).

gard for stare decisis. In the eyes of its enemies, the doc-trine "smack[ed] of the legislative process," Mishkin, 79

Harv. L. Rev., at 65, "encroach[ed] on the prerogatives of thelegislative department of government," Von Moschzisker,
Stare Decisis in Courts of Last Resort, 37 Harv. L. Rev. 409,
428 (1924), removed "one of the great inherent restraintsupon this Court's depart[ing] from the field of interpretation

to enter that of lawmaking," James v. United States, 366U. S. 213, 225 (1961) (Black, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), caused the Court's behavior to become "assimi-lated to that of a legislature," Kurland, Toward a Political
Supreme Court, 37 U. Chi. L. Rev. 19, 34 (1969), and tended
"to cut [the courts] loose from the force of precedent, allowing [them] to restructure artificially those expectations legitimately created by extant law and thereby mitigate the practical force of stare decisis," Mackey, 401 U. S., at 680 (Harlan,
J., concurring in judgment). All this was not denied by the
doctrine's friends, who also viewed it as a device to "augmen[t] the power of the courts to contribute to the growth of
the law in keeping with the demands of society," Mallamud,
Prospective Limitation and the Rights of the Accused, 56
Iowa L. Rev. 321, 359 (1970), as "a deliberate and conscious
technique of judicial lawmaking," Levy, 109 U. Pa. L. Rev.,
at 6, as a means of "facilitating more effective and defensible
judicial lawmaking," id., at 28.

Justice Harlan described this Court's embrace of the prospectivity principle as "the product of the Court's disquietude
with the impacts of its fast-moving pace of constitutional innovation," Mackey, supra, at 676. The Court itself, however, glowingly described the doctrine as the cause rather
than the effect of innovation, extolling it as a "technique"
providing the "impetus . . . for the implementation of long
overdue reforms." Jenkins v. Delaware, 395 U. S. 213, 218
(1969). Whether cause or effect, there is no doubt that the
era which gave birth to the prospectivity principle was
marked by a newfound disregard for stare decisis. As one

commentator calculated, "[b]y 1959, the number of instances
in which the Court had reversals involving constitutional issues had grown to sixty; in the two decades which followed,
the Court overruled constitutional cases on no less than
forty-seven occasions." Maltz, Some Thoughts on the Death
of Stare Decisis in Constitutional Law, 1980 Wis. L. Rev. 467.
It was an era when this Court cast overboard numerous
settled decisions, and indeed even whole areas of law, with
an unceremonious "heave-ho." See, e. g., Mapp v. Ohio, 367
U. S. 643 (1961) (overruling Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U. S. 25
(1949)); Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 (1963) (overruling Betts v. Brady, 316 U. S. 455 (1942)); Miranda v. Arizona,
384 U. S. 436, 479, n. 48 (1966) (overruling Crooker v. California, 357 U. S. 433 (1958), and Cicenia v. Lagay, 357 U. S. 504
(1958)); Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347 (1967) (overruling Olmstead v. United States, 277 U. S. 438 (1928), and Goldman v. United States, 316 U. S. 129 (1942)). To argue now
that one of the jurisprudential tools of judicial activism from
that period should be extended on grounds of stare decisis
can only be described as paradoxical.2

In sum, I join the opinion of the Court because the doctrine of prospective decisionmaking is not in fact protected

2 Contrary to the suggestion in the dissent, I am not arguing that we
should "cast overboard our entire retroactivity doctrine with . . . [an] unceremonious heave-ho." Post, at 116 (emphasis added; internal quotation
marks omitted). There is no need. We cast over the first half six Terms
ago in Griffith, and deep-sixed most of the rest two Terms ago in James
B. Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia, 501 U. S. 529 (1991)--in neither case
unceremoniously (in marked contrast to some of the overrulings cited in
text). What little, if any, remains is teetering at the end of the plank and
needs no more than a gentle nudge. But if the entire doctrine had been
given a quick and unceremonious end, there could be no complaint on the
grounds of stare decisis; as it was born, so should it die. I do not know
the basis for the dissent's contention that I find the jurisprudence of the
era that produced the doctrine of prospectivity "distasteful." Post, at
116. Much of it is quite appetizing. It is only the cavalier treatment of
stare decisis and the invention of prospectivity that I have criticized here.

by our flexible rule of stare decisis; and because no friend of
stare decisis would want it to be.

Justice Kennedy, with whom Justice White joins,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.

I remain of the view that it is sometimes appropriate in
the civil context to give only prospective application to a
judicial decision. "[P]rospective overruling allows courtsto respect the principle of

stare decisis even when they are
impelled to change the law in light of new understanding."
American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, 496 U. S. 167, 197
(1990) (plurality opinion). When a court promulgates a newrule of law, prospective application functions "to avoid injustice or hardship to civil litigants who have justifiably reliedon prior law."

Id., at 199 (internal quotation marks omitted). See Phoenix v. Kolodziejski, 399 U. S. 204, 213-215
(1970); Cipriano v. City of Houma, 395 U. S. 701, 706 (1969)
(per curiam); England v. Louisiana Bd. of Medical Examiners, 375 U. S. 411, 422 (1964). And in my view retroactivity in civil cases continues to be governed by the standard
announced in Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, 404 U. S. 97, 106-107
(1971). Thus, for the reasons explained by Justice O'Connor, post, at 113-117, I cannot agree with the Court's broad
dicta, ante, at 95-97, that appears to embrace in the civil
context the retroactivity principles adopted for criminal
cases in Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314 (1987). As Justice O'Connor has demonstrated elsewhere, the differences
between the civil and criminal contexts counsel strongly
against adoption of Griffith for civil cases. See American
Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, supra, at 197-199. I also
cannot accept the Court's conclusion, ante, at 96-99, which
is based on Justice Souter's opinion in James B. Beam
Distilling Co. v. Georgia, 501 U. S. 529, 540-543 (1991), that
a decision of this Court must be applied in a retroactive manner simply because the rule of law there announced happened to be applied to the parties then before the Court.

See post, at 117-122 (O'Connor, J., dissenting); James B.
Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia, supra, at 550-552 (O'Connor, J., dissenting). For these reasons, I do not join Part IIof the Court's opinion.

I nonetheless agree with the Court that Davis v. Michigan
Dept. of Treasury, 489 U. S. 803 (1989), must be given retro-active effect. The first condition for prospective application

of any decision is that it must announce a new rule of law.
Ashland Oil, Inc. v. Caryl, 497 U. S. 916, 918 (1990) (per
curiam); American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, supra,at 179;

United States v. Johnson, 457 U. S. 537, 550, n. 12
(1982); Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, 404 U. S., at 106-107. The
decision must "overrul[e] clear past precedent on which litigants may have relied" or "decid[e] an issue of first impression whose resolution was not clearly foreshadowed." Id.,
at 106. Because Davis did neither, it did not announce new
law and therefore must be applied in a retroactive manner.

Respondent argues that two new principles of law were
established in Davis. First, it points to the holding that 4
U. S. C. $ 111, in which the United States consents to state
taxation of the compensation of "an officer or employee of
the United States," applies to federal retirees as well as current federal employees. Brief for Respondent 16-18. See
Davis, 489 U. S., at 808-810. In Davis, however, we indicated that this holding was "dictate[d]" by "the plain language of the statute," id., at 808, and we added for good
measure our view that the language of the statute was
"unambiguous," "unmistakable," and "leaves no room for
doubt," id., at 809, n. 3, 810. Given these characterizations,
it is quite implausible to contend that in this regard Davis
decided "an issue of first impression whose resolution was
not clearly foreshadowed." Chevron Oil, supra, at 106.

The second new rule respondent contends the Court announced in Davis was that the state statute at issue discriminated against federal retirees even though the statute
treated them like all other state taxpayers except state em509us1101L 05-04-97 16:52:45 PAGES OPINPGT

ployees. Brief for Respondent 18-26. See Davis, supra, at
814, 815, n. 4. The Davis Court, however, anchored its decision in precedent. We observed that in Phillips Chemical
Co. v. Dumas Independent School Dist., 361 U. S. 376 (1960),
"we faced th[e] precise situation" confronting us in Davis,
and so Phillips Chemical controlled our holding. 489 U. S.,
at 815, n. 4. To be sure, Justice Stevens in dissent disagreed with these contentions and attempted to distinguish
Phillips Chemical. 489 U. S., at 824-826. The Court, however, was not persuaded at the time, and I remain convinced
that the Court had the better reading of Phillips Chemical.
A contrary holding in Davis, in my view, would have created
a clear inconsistency in our jurisprudence. Under Chevron
Oil, application of precedent which directly controls is not
the stuff of which new law is made.

Far from being "revolutionary," Ashland Oil Co. v. Caryl,
supra, at 920, or "an avulsive change which caused the current of the law thereafter to flow between new banks," Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. United Shoe Machinery Co., 392 U. S. 481,
499 (1968), Davis was a mere application of plain statutory
language and existing precedent. In these circumstances,
this Court is not free to mitigate any financial hardship that
might befall Virginia's taxpayers as a result of their state
government's failure to reach a correct understanding of the
unambiguous dictates of federal law.

Because I do not believe that Davis v. Michigan Dept. of
Treasury, supra, announced a new principle of law, I have
no occasion to consider Justice O'Connor's argument, post,
at 131-136, that equitable considerations may inform the
formulation of remedies when a new rule is announced. In
any event, I do not read Part III of the Court's opinion as
saying anything inconsistent with what Justice O'Connor
proposes.

On this understanding, I join Parts I and III of the Court's
opinion and concur in its judgment.

Justice O'Connor, with whom The Chief Justicejoins, dissenting.

Today the Court applies a new rule of retroactivity toimpose crushing and unnecessary liability on the States,
precisely at a time when they can least afford it. Were theCourt's decision the product of statutory or constitutional
command, I would have no choice but to join it. But nothingin the Constitution or statute requires us to adopt the retroactivity rule the majority now applies. In fact, longstandingprecedent requires the opposite result. Because I see no
reason to abandon our traditional retroactivity analysis asarticulated in

Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, 404 U. S. 97, 106-107 (1971), and because I believe the Supreme Court of Virginia correctly applied Chevron Oil in this case, I would af-firm the judgment below.

I
This Court's retroactivity jurisprudence has become some-what chaotic in recent years. Three Terms ago, the case

of American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, 496 U. S. 167(1990), produced three opinions, none of which garnered a
majority. One Term later, James B. Beam Distilling Co. v.Georgia, 501 U. S. 529 (1991), yielded five opinions; there, no
single writing carried more than three votes. As a result,the Court today finds itself confronted with such disarray
that, rather than relying on precedent, it must resort to votecounting: Examining the various opinions in

Jim Beam, itdiscerns six votes for a single proposition that, in its view,

controls this case. Ante, at 96-97.If we had given appropriate weight to the principle of
stare decisis in the first place, our retroactivity jurispru-dence never would have become so hopelessly muddled.
After all, it was not that long ago that the law of retroactiv-ity for civil cases was considered well settled. In

ChevronOil Co., we explained that whether a decision will be nonretroactive depends on whether it announces a new rule,whether prospectivity would undermine the purposes of the

rule, and whether retroactive application would produceinjustice. 404 U. S., at 106-107. Even when this Court

adjusted the retroactivity rule for criminal cases on directreview some six years ago, we reaffirmed the vitality of
Chevron Oil, noting that retroactivity in civil cases "continues to be governed by the standard announced in Chevron
Oil Co. v. Huson." Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314, 322,
n. 8 (1987). In American Trucking Assns., supra, however,a number of Justices expressed a contrary view, and the jurisprudential equivalent of entropy immediately took over.Whatever the merits of any retroactivity test, it cannot be
denied that resolution of the case before us would be simplified greatly had we not disregarded so needlessly our obligation to follow precedent in the first place.

I fear that the Court today, rather than rectifying that
confusion, reinforces it still more. In the usual case, of
course, retroactivity is not an issue; the courts simply apply
their best understanding of current law in resolving each
case that comes before them. James B. Beam, 501 U. S., at
534, 535-536 (Souter, J.). But where the law changes in
some respect, the courts sometimes may elect not to apply
the new law; instead, they apply the law that governed when
the events giving rise to the suit took place, especially where
the change in law is abrupt and the parties may have relied
on the prior law. See id., at 534. This can be done in one
of two ways. First, a court may choose to make the decision
purely prospective, refusing to apply it not only to the parties before the court but also to any case where the relevant
facts predate the decision. Id., at 536. Second, a court may
apply the rule to some but not all cases where the operative
events occurred before the court's decision, depending on the
equities. See id., at 537. The first option is called "pure
prospectivity" and the second "selective prospectivity."

As the majority notes, ante, at 96-97, six Justices in James
B. Beam, supra, expressed their disagreement with selective
prospectivity. Thus, even though there was no majority

opinion in that case, one can derive from that case the propo-sition the Court announces today: Once "this Court applies

a rule of federal law to the parties before it, that rule . . .must be given full retroactive effect in all cases still open on
direct review." Ante, at 97. But no decision of this Court
forecloses the possibility of pure prospectivity--refusal toapply a new rule in the very case in which it is announced

and every case thereafter. As Justice White explained inhis concurrence in

James B. Beam, "[t]he propriety of prospective application of decision in this Court, in both consti-tutional and statutory cases, is settled by our prior decisions." 501 U. S., at 546 (opinion concurring in judgment).Rather than limiting its pronouncements to the question
of selective prospectivity, the Court intimates that pure
prospectivity may be prohibited as well. See ante, at 97(referring to our lack of " `constitutional authority . . . to disregard current law' "); ibid. (relying on " `basic norms of con-stitutional adjudication' " (quoting

Griffith, supra, at 322));
see also ante, at 94 (touting the "fundamental rule of `retro-spective operation' " of judicial decisions). The intimation is

incorrect. As I have explained before and will touch upononly briefly here:

"[W]hen the Court changes its mind, the law changeswith it. If the Court decides, in the context of a civil
case or controversy, to change the law, it must make[a] determination whether the new law or the old is
to apply to conduct occurring before the law-changing
decision. Chevron Oil describes our long-establishedprocedure for making this inquiry."

James B. Beam,
supra, at 550 (O'Connor, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks omitted).

Nor can the Court's suggestion be squared with our cases,
which repeatedly have announced rules of purely prospective
effect. See, e. g., Northern Pipeline Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U. S. 50, 88 (1982); Chevron Oil, 404

In any event, the question of pure prospectivity is not im-plicated here. The majority first holds that once a rule

hasbeen applied retroactively, the rule must be applied retroactively to all cases thereafter. Ante, at 97. Then it holdsthat Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U. S. 803
(1989), in fact retroactively applied the rule it announced.
Ante, at 98-99. Under the majority's approach, that shouldend the matter: Because the Court applied the rule retroactively in Davis, it must do so here as well. Accordingly,there is no reason for the Court's careless dictum regarding
pure prospectivity, much less dictum that is contrary toclear precedent.

Plainly enough, Justice Scalia would cast overboard ourentire retroactivity doctrine with precisely the "unceremonious `heave-ho' " he decries in his concurrence. See ante, at109. Behind the undisguised hostility to an era whose jurisprudence he finds distasteful, Justice Scalia raises but twosubstantive arguments, both of which were raised in

JamesB. Beam, 501 U. S., at 549 (
Scalia, J., concurring in judg-ment), and neither of which has been adopted by a majority

of this Court. Justice White appropriately responded tothose arguments then, see

id., at 546 (opinion concurring in
judgment), and there is no reason to repeat the responsesnow. As Justice Frankfurter explained more than 35 years

ago:

"We should not indulge in the fiction that the law now
announced has always been the law . . . . It is muchmore conducive to law's self-respect to recognize candidly the considerations that give prospective content to

II
I dissented in James B. Beam because I believed that theabsolute prohibition on selective prospectivity was not only

contrary to precedent, but also so rigid that it produced un-conscionable results. I would have adhered to the traditional equitable balancing test of Chevron Oil as the appro-priate method of deciding the retroactivity question in
individual cases. But even if one believes the prohibition onselective prospectivity desirable, it seems to me that the
Court today takes that judgment to an illogical--and inequi-table--extreme. It is one thing to say that, where we have
considered prospectivity in a prior case and rejected it, wemust reject it in every case thereafter. But it is quite another to hold that, because we did not consider the possibilityof prospectivity in a prior case and instead applied a rule
retroactively through inadvertence, we are foreclosed fromconsidering the issue forever thereafter. Such a rule is both
contrary to established precedent and at odds with anynotion of fairness or sound decisional practice. Yet that
is precisely the rule the Court appears to adopt today.
Ante, at 96-97. A

Under the Court's new approach, we have neither author-ity nor discretion to consider the merits of applying Davis v.
Michigan Dept. of Treasury, supra, retroactively. Instead,we must inquire whether any of our previous decisions happened to have applied the Davis rule retroactively to theparties before the Court. Deciding whether we in fact have
applied Davis retroactively turns out to be a rather difficultmatter. Parsing the language of the

Davis opinion, theCourt encounters a single sentence it declares determinative:

"The State having conceded that a refund is appropriate in

O'Connor, J., dissenting
these circumstances, see Brief for Appellee 63, to the extentappellant has paid taxes pursuant to this invalid tax scheme,

he is entitled to a refund." Id., at 817 (quoted in part, ante,at 98). According to the majority, that sentence constitutes
" `consideration of remedial issues' " and therefore " `necessarily' " indicates that we applied the rule in Davis retroac-tively to the parties before us.

Ante, at 98 (quoting James
B. Beam, supra, at 539 (opinion of Souter, J.)). Ironically,respondent and its

amici draw precisely the opposite conclusion from the same sentence. According to them, the factthat Michigan conceded that it would offer relief meant that

we had no reason to decide the question of retroactivity in
Davis. Michigan was willing to provide relief whether or
not relief was required. The Court simply accepted that
offer and preserved the retroactivity question for another
day.

One might very well debate the meaning of the single sentence on which everyone relies. But the debate is as meaningless as it is indeterminate. In Brecht v. Abrahamson,
507 U. S. 619 (1993), we reaffirmed our longstanding rule
that, if a decision does not "squarely addres[s] [an] issue,"
this Court remains "free to address [it] on the merits" at
a later date. Id., at 631. Accord, United States v. L. A.
Tucker Truck Lines, Inc., 344 U. S. 33, 38 (1952) (issue not
"raised in briefs or argument nor discussed in the opinion of
the Court" cannot be taken as "a binding precedent on th[e]
point"); Webster v. Fall, 266 U. S. 507, 511 (1925) ("Questions
which merely lurk in the record, neither brought to the attention of the court nor ruled upon, are not considered as
having been so decided as to constitute precedents"). The
rule can be traced back to some of the earliest of this Court's
decisions. See statement of Marshall, C. J., as reported in
the arguments of counsel in United States v. More, 3 Cranch

159, 172 (1805) ("No question was made, in that case, as to
the jurisdiction. It passed sub silentio, and the court does
not consider itself as bound by that case"). Regardless of

O'Connor, J., dissenting
how one reads the solitary sentence upon which the Courtrelies, surely it does not "squarely address" the question of

retroactivity; it does not even mention retroactivity. Atbest, by addressing the question of remedies, the sentence
implicitly "assumes" the rule in Davis to be retroactive.
Our decision in Brecht, however, makes it quite clear thatunexamined assumptions do not bind this Court.

Brecht,
supra, at 631 (That the Court "assumed the applicability of "a rule does not bind the Court to the assumption).

In fact, there is far less reason to consider ourselves boundby precedent today than there was in

Brecht. In Brecht,
the issue was not whether a legal question was resolved by
a single case; it was whether our consistent practice of applying a particular rule, Chapman v. California, 386 U. S. 18,
24 (1967), to cases on collateral review precluded us from
limiting the rule's application to cases on direct review. Because none of our prior cases directly had addressed the applicability of Chapman to cases on collateral review--each
had only assumed it applied--the Court held that those cases
did not bind us to any particular result. See Brecht, supra,
at 630-631. I see no reason why a single retroactive application of the Davis rule, inferred from the sparse and ambiguous language of Davis itself, should carry more weight here
than our consistent practice did in Brecht.

The Court offers no justification for disregarding the settled rule we so recently applied in Brecht. Nor do I believe
it could, for the rule is not a procedural nicety. On the contrary, it is critical to the soundness of our decisional processes. It should go without saying that any decision of this
Court has wide-ranging applications; nearly every opinion
we issue has effects far beyond the particular case in which
it issues. The rule we applied in Brecht, which limits the

stare decisis effect of our decisions to questions actually considered and passed on, ensures that this Court does not decide important questions by accident or inadvertence. By
adopting a contrary rule in the area of retroactivity, the

120 HARPER v. VIRGINIA DEPT. OF TAXATION

O'Connor, J., dissenting
Court now permanently binds itself to its every unexaminedassumption or inattention. Any rule that creates a grave

risk that we might resolve important issues of national con-cern

sub silentio, without thought or consideration, cannot
be a wise one.

This case demonstrates the danger of such a rule. Thequestion of retroactivity was never briefed in

Davis. It had
not been passed upon by the court below. And it was notwithin the question presented. Indeed, at oral argument

we signaled that we would not pass upon the retroactivityof the rule

Davis would announce. After conceding that the
Michigan Department of Taxation would give Davis himselfa refund if he prevailed, counsel for the department argued

that it would be unfair to require Michigan to provide refunds to the 24,000 taxpayers who were not before the Court.The following colloquy ensued:

"[Court]: So why do we have to answer that at all?
"[Michigan]: --if, if this Court issues an opinion stating that the current Michigan classification is unconstitu-tional or in violation of the statute, there are these

24,000 taxpayers out there.. . . . .

"[Court]: But that's not--it's not here, is it? Is thatquestion here?
"[Michigan]: It is not specifically raised, no." Tr. ofOral Arg., O. T. 1988, No. 87-1020, pp. 37-38.

Now, however, the Court holds that the question was implic-itly before us and that, even though the

Davis opinion does
not even discuss the question of retroactivity, it resolved the
issue conclusively and irretrievably.

If Davis somehow did decide that its rule was to be retroactive, it was by chance and not by design. The absence of
briefing, argument, or even mention of the question belies
any suggestion that the issue was given thoughtful consideration. Even the author of the Davis opinion refuses to ac509us1101L 05-04-97 16:52:45 PAGES OPINPGT

O'Connor, J., dissenting
cept the notion that Davis resolved the question of retroac-tivity. Instead,

Justice Kennedy applies the analysis of
Chevron Oil to resolve the retroactivity question today.See

ante, at 110-112 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).

The Court's decision today cannot be justified by compari-son to our decision in

Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314
(1987), which abandoned selective prospectivity in the crimi-nal context.

Ante, at 97. As I explained in American
Trucking Assns., 496 U. S., at 197-200, there are significantdifferences between criminal and civil cases that weigh

against such an extension. First, nonretroactivity in criminal cases historically has favored the government's reliance
interests over the rights of criminal defendants. As a result, the generalized policy of favoring individual rights over
governmental prerogative can justify the elimination of prospectivity in the criminal arena. The same rationale cannot
apply in civil cases, as nonretroactivity in the civil context
does not necessarily favor plaintiffs or defendants; "nor is
there any policy reason for protecting one class of litigants
over another." Id., at 198. More important, even a party
to civil litigation who is "deprived of the full retroactive benefit of a new decision may receive some relief." Id., at 198-
199. Here, for example, petitioners received the benefit of
prospective invalidation of Virginia's taxing scheme. From
this moment forward, they will be treated on an equal basis
with all other retirees, the very treatment our intergovernmental immunity cases require. The criminal defendant, in
contrast, is usually interested only in one remedy--reversal
of his conviction. That remedy can be obtained only if the
rule is applied retroactively. See id., at 199.

Nor can the Court's rejection of selective retroactivity in
the civil context be defended on equal treatment grounds.
See Griffith, supra, at 323 (selective retroactivity accords a
benefit to the defendant in whose case the decision is announced but not to any defendant thereafter). It may well

122 HARPER v. VIRGINIA DEPT. OF TAXATION

O'Connor, J., dissenting
be that there is little difference between the criminal defend-ant in whose case a decision is announced and the defendant

who seeks certiorari on the same question two days later.But in this case there is a tremendous difference between
the defendant in whose case the Davis rule was announcedand the defendant who appears before us today: The latter
litigated and preserved the retroactivity question while theformer did not. The Michigan Department of Taxation did
not even brief the question of retroactivity in Davis. Re-spondent, in contrast, actually prevailed on the question in
the court below.If the Court is concerned with equal treatment, that difference should be dispositive. Having failed to demand the un-usual, prospectivity, respondent in Davis got the usual--
namely, retroactivity. Respondent in this case has asked forthe unusual. In fact, respondent here defends a judgment
below that awarded it just that. I do not see how the princi-ples of equality can support forcing the Commonwealth of
Virginia to bear the harsh consequences of retroactivity sim-ply because, years ago, the Michigan Department of Taxation
failed to press the issue--and we neglected to consider it.Instead, the principles of fairness favor addressing the contentions the Virginia Department of Taxation presses beforeus by applying

Chevron Oil today. It is therefore to Chev-ron Oil that I now turn.

B
Under Chevron Oil, whether a decision of this Court willbe applied nonretroactively depends on three factors. First,

as a threshold matter, "the decision to be applied nonretroac-tively must establish a new principle of law." 404 U. S., at
106. Second, nonretroactivity must not retard the newrule's operation in light of its history, purpose, and effect.
Id., at 107. Third, nonretroactivity must be necessary toavoid the substantial injustice and hardship that a holding
of retroactivity might impose. Ibid. In my view, all threefactors favor holding our decision in Davis nonretroactive.

As Justice Kennedy points out in his concurrence, ante,
at 111, a decision cannot be made nonretroactive unless it
announces "a new principle of law." Chevron Oil, 404 U. S.,
at 106. For purposes of civil retroactivity, Chevron Oil
identifies two types of decisions that can be new. First, a
decision is new if it overturns "clear past precedent on which
litigants may have relied." Ibid.; ante, at 111 (Kennedy, J.,
concurring in part and concurring in judgment). I agree
with Justice Kennedy that Davis did not represent such a
" `revolutionary' " or " `avulsive change' " in the law. Ante,
at 112 (quoting Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 392 U. S. 481, 499 (1968)).

Nonetheless, Chevron also explains that a decision may be
"new" if it resolves "an issue of first impression whose resolution was not clearly foreshadowed." Chevron Oil, supra,
at 106 (emphasis added). Thus, even a decision that is "controlled by the . . . principles" articulated in precedent may
announce a new rule, so long as the rule was "sufficiently
debatable" in advance. Arizona Governing Comm. for Tax
Deferred Annuity and Deferred Compensation Plans v.
Norris, 463 U. S. 1073, 1109 (1983) (O'Connor, J., concurring). Reading the Davis opinion alone, one might get the
impression that it did not announce a new rule even of that
variety. The opinion's emphatic language suggests that the
outcome was not even debatable. See ante, at 111 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).
In my view, however, assertive language is not itself determinative. As The Chief Justice explained for the Court
in a different context:

"[T]he fact that a court says that its decision . . . is `controlled' by a prior decision, is not conclusive for purposes
of deciding whether the current decision is a `new
rule' . . . . Courts frequently view their decisions as
being `controlled' or `governed' by prior opinions even

when aware of reasonable contrary conclusions reachedby other courts." Butler v. McKellar, 494 U. S. 407,

415 (1990).
In Butler, we determined that the rule announced in Arizona v. Roberson, 486 U. S. 675 (1988), was "new" for pur-poses of Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989), despite Roberson's repeated assertions that its rule was "directlycontrolled" by precedent. Indeed, we did not even feel
bound by the opinion's statement that it was not announcinga new rule at all but rather declining to create an exception
to an existing rule. While Teague and its progeny may notprovide the appropriate standard of novelty for

Chevron Oilpurposes, their teaching--that whether an opinion is new depends not on its language or tone but on the legal landscapefrom which it arose--obtains nonetheless.

In any event, Justice Stevens certainly thought that
Davis announced a new rule. In fact, he thought that therule was not only unprecedented, but wrong: "The Court's

holding is not supported by the rationale for the intergovern-mental immunity doctrine and is not compelled by our previous decisions. I cannot join the unjustified, court-imposedrestriction on a State's power to administer its own affairs."
489 U. S., at 818-819 (dissenting opinion). And just lastTerm two Members of this Court expressed their disagreement with the decision in Davis, labeling its application ofthe doctrine of intergovernmental immunity "perverse."

Barker v. Kansas, 503 U. S. 594, 606 (1992) (Stevens, J.,joined by

Thomas, J., concurring). Although I would notcall our decision in Davis perverse, I agree that its rule was

sufficiently debatable in advance as to fall short of being"clearly foreshadowed." The great weight of authority is
in accord.*

*Swanson v. Powers, 937 F. 2d 965, 968, 970, 971 (CA4 1991) ("The most

In fact, before Davis was announced, conventional wisdom
seemed to be directly to the contrary. One would think
that, if Davis was "clearly foreshadowed," some taxpayer
might have made the intergovernmental immunity argument
before. No one had. Twenty-three States had taxation
schemes just like the one at issue in Davis; and some of those
schemes were established as much as half a century before
Davis was decided. See Harper v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation, 241 Va. 232, 237, 401 S. E. 2d 868, 871 (1991). Yet not
a single taxpayer ever challenged one of those schemes on
intergovernmental immunity grounds until Davis challenged
Michigan's in 1984. If Justice Holmes is correct that "[t]he
prophecies of what the courts will do in fact, and nothing
more pretentious" are "law," O. Holmes, The Path of the
Law, in Collected Legal Papers 167, 173 (1920), then surely
Davis announced new law; the universal "prophecy" before
Davis seemed to be that such taxation schemes were valid.

An examination of the decision in Davis and its predecessors reveals that Davis was anything but clearly foreshadowed. Of course, it was well established long before Davis
that the nondiscrimination principle of 4 U. S. C. $ 111 and
the doctrine of intergovernmental immunity prohibit a State
from imposing a discriminatory tax on the United States or

sult in [Davis itself]"; "how the intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine
and 4 U. S. C. $ 111 applied to [plans like the one at issue in Davis] was
anything but clearly established prior to Davis"); Harper v. Virginia
Dept. of Taxation, 241 Va. 232, 238, 401 S. E. 2d 868, 872 (1991) ("[T]he

those who do business with it. The income tax at issue in
Davis, however, did not appear discriminatory on its face.
Like the Virginia income tax at issue here, it did not singleout federal employees or retirees for disfavored treatment.

Instead, federal retirees were treated identically to all other
retirees, with a single and numerically insignificant excep-tion--retirees whose retirement benefits were paid by the

State. Whether such an exception rendered the tax "dis-criminatory" within the meaning of the intergovernmental
immunity doctrine, it seems to me, was an open question.On the one hand, the tax scheme did distinguish between
federal retirees and state retirees: The former were required
to pay state taxes on their retirement income, while the latter were not. But it was far from clear that such was the
proper comparison. In fact, there were strong arguments
that it was not.

As Justice Stevens explained more thoroughly in his
Davis dissent, 489 U. S., at 819--and as we have recognized
since McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316 (1819)--intergovernmental immunity is necessary to prevent the States
from interfering with federal interests through taxation. Because the National Government has no recourse to the state
ballot box, it has only a limited ability to protect itself
against excessive state taxes. But the risk of excessive taxation of federal interests is eliminated, and "[a] `political
check' is provided, when a state tax falls" not only on the
Federal Government, but also "on a significant group of
state citizens who can be counted upon to use their votes
to keep the State from raising the tax excessively, and
thus placing an unfair burden on the Federal Government."
Washington v. United States, 460 U. S. 536, 545 (1983) (emphasis added). Accord, United States v. County of Fresno,
429 U. S. 452, 462-464 (1977); South Carolina v. Baker, 485
U. S. 505, 526, n. 15 (1988).

There can be no doubt that the taxation scheme at issue
in Davis and the one employed by the Commonwealth of

O'Connor, J., dissenting
Virginia provided that necessary "political check." Theyexempted only a small group of citizens, state retirees, while

subjecting the remainder of their citizens--federal retirees,retirees who receive income from private sources, and nonretirees alike--to a uniform income tax. As a result, any
attempt to increase income taxes excessively so as to inter-fere with federal interests would have caused the similarly

taxed populace to "use their votes" to protect their interests,thereby protecting the interests of the Federal Government
as well. There being no risk of abusive taxation of the Na-tional Government, there was a good argument that there
should have been no intergovernmental immunity problem
either. See Davis, 489 U. S., at 821-824 (Stevens, J.,
dissenting).

In addition, distinguishing between taxation of state retirees and all others, including private and federal retirees, was
justifiable from an economic standpoint. The State, after
all, does not merely collect taxes from its retirees; it pays
their benefits as well. As a result, it makes no difference to
the State or the retirees whether the State increases state
retirement benefits in an amount sufficient to cover taxes it
imposes, or whether the State offers reduced benefits and
makes them tax free. The net income level of the retirees
and the impact on the state fisc is the same. Thus, the Michigan Department of Taxation had a good argument that its
differential treatment of state and federal retirees was "directly related to, and justified by, [a] significant differenc[e]
between the two classes," id., at 816 (internal quotation
marks omitted): Taxing federal retirees enhances the State's
fisc, whereas taxing state retirees does not.

I recite these arguments not to show that the decision in
Davis was wrong--I joined the opinion then and remain of
the view that it was correct--but instead to point out that
the arguments on the other side were substantial. Of
course, the Court was able to "ancho[r] its decision in precedent," ante, at 112 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and con509us1101L 05-04-97 16:52:45 PAGES OPINPGT

curring in judgment). But surely that cannot be dispositive.Few decisions are so novel that there is no precedent to

which they may be moored. What is determinative is thatthe decision was "sufficiently debatable" ex ante that, under
Chevron Oil, nonretroactivity cannot be precluded. Arizona Governing Committee v. Norris, 463 U. S., at 1109(

O'Connor, J., concurring). That, it seems to me, is thecase here.

The second Chevron Oil factor is whether denying the ruleretroactive application will retard its operation in light

of the rule's history, purpose, and effect. 404 U. S., at107. That factor overwhelmingly favors respondent. The
purpose of the intergovernmental immunity doctrine is toprotect the rights of the Federal Sovereign against state
interference. It does not protect the private rights ofindividuals:

"[T]he purpose of the immunity was not to confer bene-fits on the employees by relieving them from contributing their share of the financial support of the other gov-ernment . . . , but to prevent undue interference with
the one government by imposing on it the tax burdensof the other."

Graves v. New York ex rel. O'Keefe, 306U. S. 466, 483-484 (1939) (footnote omitted).

Accord, Davis, supra, at 814 ("[I]ntergovernmental taximmunity is based on the need to protect each sovereign's
governmental operations from undue interference by theother"). Affording petitioners retroactive relief in this case
would not vindicate the interests of the Federal Government.Instead, it lines the pockets of the Government's former employees. It therefore comes as no surprise that the UnitedStates, despite its consistent participation in intergovernmental immunity cases in the past, has taken no positionhere. Because retroactive application of the rule in

ernmental immunity was meant to protect--the FederalGovernment's--denying Davis retroactive application would

not undermine the decision's purpose or effect.

The final factor under Chevron Oil is whether the decision" `could produce substantial inequitable results if applied retroactively.' " Chevron Oil, supra, at 107 (quoting Ciprianov.

City of Houma, 395 U. S., at 706). We repeatedly havedeclined to give our decisions retroactive effect where doing

so would be unjust. In Arizona Governing Committee v.
Norris, supra, for example, we declined to apply a Title VIIdecision retroactively, noting that the resulting "unanticipated financial burdens would come at a time when manyStates and local governments are struggling to meet substantial fiscal deficits." Id., at 1106-1107 (Powell, J., joinedby Burger, C. J.,

Blackmun, Rehnquist, and O'Connor,JJ.). There was "no justification" for "impos[ing] this magnitude of burden retroactively on the public," we concluded.Id., at 1107. Accord, id., at 1107-1111 (

O'Connor, J., concur-ring); see
id., at 1075 (per curiam). Similarly, we declinedto afford the plaintiff full retroactive relief in Los Angeles

Dept. of Water and Power v. Manhart, 435 U. S. 702, 718-723(1978) (

Stevens, J.). There, too, we explained that "[r]etro-active liability could be devastating" and that "[t]he harm

would fall in large part on innocent third parties." Id., at722-723.

Those same considerations exist here. Retroactive ap-plication of rulings that invalidate state tax laws have the
potential for producing "disruptive consequences for theState[s] and [their] citizens. A refund, if required by state
or federal law, could deplete the state treasur[ies], thusthreatening the State[s'] current operations and future
plans." American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, 496 U. S.,at 182 (plurality opinion). Retroactive application of

Davisis no exception. "The fiscal implications of Davis for the

[S]tates," one commentator has noted, "are truly stagger-ing." Hellerstein, Preliminary Reflections on McKesson and

American Trucking Associations, 48 Tax Notes 325, 336(1990). The States estimate that their total liability will exceed $1.8 billion. Brief for Respondent SA-1; Brief for
State of Utah et al. as Amici Curiae 12-13. Virginia's sharealone exceeds $440 million. Brief for Respondent SA-1;

Brief for State of Utah et al. as Amici Curiae 12-13. Thismassive liability could not come at a worse time. See Wall
Street Journal, July 27, 1992, p. A2 ("Most states are in direfiscal straits, and their deteriorating tax base is making it
harder for them to get out, a survey of legislatures indicates"). Accord, Harper v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation, 241
Va., at 239-240, 401 S. E. 2d, at 873 (such massive liability
"would have a potentially disruptive and destructive impact
on the Commonwealth's planning, budgeting, and delivery of
essential state services"); Swanson v. State, 329 N. C. 576,
583, 407 S. E. 2d 791, 794 (1991) ("this State is in dire financial straits" and $140 million in refunds would exacerbate it);
Bass v. State, 302 S. C. 250, 256, 395 S. E. 2d 171, 174 (1990)
($200 million in refunds "would impose a severe financial burden on the State and its citizens [and] endanger the financial
integrity of the State"). To impose such liability on Virginia
and the other States that relied in good faith on their taxation laws, "at a time when most States are struggling to fund
even the most basic services, is the height of unfairness."
James B. Beam, 501 U. S., at 558 (O'Connor, J., dissenting).

It cannot be contended that such a burden is justified by
the States' conduct, for the liability is entirely disproportionate to the offense. We do not deal with a State that willfully
violated the Constitution but rather one that acted entirely
in good faith on the basis of an unchallenged statute. Moreover, during the four years in question, the constitutional
violation produced a benefit of approximately $8 million to
$12 million per year, Tr. of Oral Arg. 33, 36, and that benefit
accrued not to the Commonwealth but to individual retirees.

131Cite as: 509 U. S. 86 (1993)
O'Connor, J., dissenting
Yet, for that $32 million to $48 million error, the Court nowallows the imposition of liability well in excess of $400 million

dollars. Such liability is more than just disproportionate; itis unconscionable. Finally and perhaps most important, this
burden will not fall on some thoughtless government officialor even the group of retirees that benefited from the offending exemption. Instead the burden falls squarely on thebacks of the blameless and unexpecting taxpayers of the affected States who, although they profited not at all from theexemption, will now be forced to pay higher taxes and be
deprived of essential services.Petitioners, in contrast, would suffer no hardship if the
Court refused to apply Davis retroactively. For years, 23States enforced taxation schemes like the Commonwealth's
in good faith, and for years not a single taxpayer objectedon intergovernmental immunity grounds. No one put the
States on notice that their taxing schemes might be consti-tutionally suspect. Denying Davis retroactive relief thus
would not deny petitioners a benefit on which they had re-lied. It merely would deny them an unanticipated windfall.
Because that windfall would come only at the cost of impos-ing hurtful consequences on innocent taxpayers and the communities in which they live, I believe the substantial inequityof imposing retroactive relief in this case, like the other
Chevron factors, weighs in favor of denying Davis retroac-tive application.

III
Even if the Court is correct that Davis must be appliedretroactively in this case, there is the separate question of

the remedy that must be given. The questions of retroactiv-ity and remedy are analytically distinct.

American Truck-ing Assns., Inc. v. Smith, supra, at 189 (plurality opinion)

("[T]he Court has never equated its retroactivity principleswith remedial principles"). As

Justice Souter explainedin
James B. Beam, supra, at 534, retroactivity is a matterof choice of law "[s]ince the question is whether the court

509us1101L 05-04-97 16:52:45 PAGES OPINPGT
132 HARPER v. VIRGINIA DEPT. OF TAXATION

O'Connor, J., dissenting
should apply the old rule or the new one." When the retro-activity of a decision of this Court is in issue, the choice-oflaw issue is a federal question. Ashland Oil, Inc. v. Caryl,497 U. S. 916, 918 (1990)

(per curiam).
The question of remedy, however, is quite different. The
issue is not whether to apply new law or old law, but whatrelief should be afforded once the prevailing party has been

determined under applicable law. See James B. Beam, 501U. S., at 535 (

Souter, J.) ("Once a rule is found to apply
`backward,' there may then be a further issue of remedies,
i. e., whether the party prevailing under a new rule should
obtain the same relief that would have been awarded if the
rule had been an old one"). The question of remedies is in
the first instance a question of state law. See ibid. ("[T]he
remedial inquiry is one governed by state law, at least where
the case originates in state court"). In fact, the only federal
question regarding remedies is whether the relief afforded is
sufficient to comply with the requirements of due process.
See McKesson Corp. v. Division of Alcoholic Beverages and
Tobacco, Fla. Dept. of Business Regulation, 496 U. S. 18,
31-52 (1990).

While the issue of retroactivity is properly before us, the
question of remedies is not. It does not appear to be within
the question presented, which asks only if Davis may be
applied "nonretroactively so as to defeat federal retirees' entitlement to refunds." Pet. for Cert. i. Moreover, our consideration of the question at this juncture would be inappropriate, as the Supreme Court of Virginia has yet to consider
what remedy might be available in light of Davis' retroactivity and applicable state law. The Court inexplicably discusses the question at length nonetheless, noting that if the
Commonwealth of Virginia provides adequate predeprivation remedies, it is under no obligation to provide full retroactive refunds today. Ante, at 100-102.

When courts take it upon themselves to issue helpful guidance in dictum, they risk creating additional confusion by

509us1101L 05-04-97 16:52:45 PAGES OPINPGT

133Cite as: 509 U. S. 86 (1993)
O'Connor, J., dissenting
inadvertently suggesting constitutional absolutes that donot exist. The Court's dictum today follows that course.

Amidst its discussion of predeprivation and postdeprivationremedies, the Court asserts that a plaintiff who has been
deprived a predeprivation remedy cannot be "confine[d] . . .
to prospective relief." Ante, at 101, n. 10. I do not believethe Court's assertion to be correct.

Over 20 years ago, Justice Harlan recognized that theequities could be taken into account in determining the
appropriate remedy when the Court announces a new ruleof constitutional law:

"To the extent that equitable considerations, for ex-ample, `reliance,' are relevant, I would take this into account in the determination of what relief is appropriatein any given case. There are, of course, circumstances
when a change in the law will jeopardize an edifice whichwas reasonably constructed on the foundation of prevailing legal doctrine." United States v. Estate of Donnelly, 397 U. S. 286, 296 (1970) (concurring opinion).

The commentators appear to be in accord. See Fallon &Meltzer, New Law, Non-Retroactivity, and Constitutional

Remedies, 104 Harv. L. Rev. 1733 (1991) (urging consider-ation of novelty and hardship as part of the remedial framework rather than as a question of whether to apply old law
or new). In my view, and in light of the Court's revisionsto the law of retroactivity, it should be constitutionally permissible for the equities to inform the remedial inquiry. Ina particularly compelling case, then, the equities might permit a State to deny taxpayers a full refund despite having
refused them predeprivation process.

Indeed, some Members of this Court have argued that
we recognized as much long ago. In American Trucking
Assns., 496 U. S., at 219-224 (dissenting opinion), Justice
Stevens admitted that this Court repeatedly had applied
the Chevron Oil factors to preclude the provision of mone509us1101L 05-04-97 16:52:46 PAGES OPINPGT
134 HARPER v. VIRGINIA DEPT. OF TAXATION

O'Connor, J., dissenting
tary relief. In Justice Stevens' view, however, Chevron
Oil determined the question of remedy rather than which
law would apply, new or old. See 496 U. S., at 220 (Chevron
Oil and its progeny "establish a remedial principle for the
exercise of equitable discretion by federal courts and not, as
the plurality states, a choice-of-law principle applicable to allcases on direct review"); see also

ante, at 95, n. 9 (reserving
the possibility that Chevron Oil governs the question ofremedies in federal court). If

Justice Stevens' view or
something like it has prevailed today--and it seems that ithas--then state and federal courts still retain the ability to

exercise their "equitable discretion" in formulating appro-priate relief on a federal claim. After all, it would be wholly
anomalous to suggest that federal courts are permitted to
determine the scope of the remedy by reference to Chevron
Oil, but that state courts are barred from considering the
equities altogether. Not only would that unduly restrictstate court "flexibility in the law of remedies,"

Estate of
Donnelly, supra, at 297 (Harlan, J., concurring), but it alsowould turn federalism on its head. I know of no principle

of law that permits us to restrict the remedial discretion ofstate courts without imposing similar restrictions on federal
courts. Quite the opposite should be true, as the question
of remedies in state court is generally a question of state
law in the first instance. James B. Beam, 501 U. S., at 535
(Souter, J.).

The Court cites only a single case that might be read as
precluding courts from considering the equities when selecting the remedy for the violation of a novel constitutional
rule. That case is McKesson Corp. v. Division of Alcoholic
Beverages and Tobacco, supra. Ante, at 101-102. But, as
the controlling opinion in James B. Beam explains, McKesson cannot be so read. 501 U. S., at 544 ("Nothing we say
here [precludes the right] to raise procedural bars to recovery under state law or demonstrate reliance interests entitled to consideration in determining the nature of the
remedy that must be provided, a matter with which McKes509us1101L 05-04-97 16:52:46 PAGES OPINPGT

O'Connor, J., dissenting
son did not deal" (emphases added)). Accord, id., at 543("[N]othing we say here precludes consideration of individual equities when deciding remedial issues in particularcases"). It is true that the Court in

McKesson rejected, on
due process grounds, the State of Florida's equitable arguments against the requirement of a full refund. But theopinion did not hold that those arguments were irrelevant as

a categorical matter. It simply held that the equities in thatcase were insufficient to support the decision to withhold a
remedy. The opinion expressly so states, rejecting theState's equitable arguments as insufficiently "weighty

in
these circumstances." McKesson, 496 U. S., at 45 (empha-sis added).

The circumstances in McKesson were quite different than
those here. In McKesson, the tax imposed was patently un-constitutional: The State of Florida collected taxes under its

Liquor Tax statute even though this Court already had inval-idated a "virtually identical" tax.

Id., at 46. Given that the
State could "hardly claim surprise" that its statute was de-clared invalid, this Court concluded that the State's reliance

on the presumptive validity of its statute was insufficient topreclude monetary relief.

Ibid. As we explained in American Trucking Assns., the large burden of retroactive relief
is "largely irrelevant when a State violates constitutional
norms well established under existing precedent." We cited
McKesson as an example. 496 U. S., at 183 (plurality
opinion).

A contrary reading of McKesson would be anomalous in
light of this Court's immunity jurisprudence. The Federal
Government, for example, is absolutely immune from suit absent an express waiver of immunity; and federal officers
enjoy at least qualified immunity when sued in a Bivens action. Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403
U. S. 388 (1971). As a result, an individual who suffers a
constitutional deprivation at the hands of a federal officer
very well may have no access to backwards-looking (monetary) relief. I do not see why the Due Process Clause would

509us1101L 05-04-97 16:52:46 PAGES OPINPGT
136 HARPER v. VIRGINIA DEPT. OF TAXATION

O'Connor, J., dissenting
require a full, backwards-looking compensatory remedy
whenever a governmental official reasonably taxes a citizen
under what later turns out to be an unconstitutional statute
but not where the officer deprives a citizen of her bodily
integrity or her life.

In my view, if the Court is going to restrict authority to
temper hardship by holding our decisions nonretroactive
through the Chevron Oil factors, it must afford courts the
ability to avoid injustice by taking equity into account when
formulating the remedy for violations of novel constitutional
rules. See Fallon & Meltzer, 104 Harv. L. Rev. 1733 (1991).
Surely the Constitution permits this Court to refuse plaintiffs full backwards-looking relief under Chevron Oil; we
repeatedly have done so in the past. American Trucking
Assns., supra, at 188-200 (canvassing the Court's practice);
see also supra, at 115-116, 129. I therefore see no reason
why it would not similarly permit state courts reasonably to
consider the equities in the exercise of their sound remedial
discretion.

IV

In my view, the correct approach to the retroactivity question before us was articulated in Chevron Oil some 22 years
ago. By refusing to apply Chevron Oil today, the Court not
only permits the imposition of grave and gratuitous hardship
on the States and their citizens, but also disregards settled
precedents central to the fairness and accuracy of our decisional processes. Nor does the Court cast any light on the
nature of the regime that will govern from here on. To the
contrary, the Court's unnecessary innuendo concerning pure
prospectivity and ill-advised dictum regarding remedial issues introduce still greater uncertainty and disorder into this
already chaotic area. Because I cannot agree with the
Court's decision or the manifestly unjust results it appears
to portend, I respectfully dissent.

DARBY et al. v. CISNEROS, SECRETARY

OF HOUSING AND URBAN

DEVELOPMENT, et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fourth circuit

No. 91-2045. Argued March 22, 1993--Decided June 21, 1993
In a consolidated appeal from decisions by the Department of Housing and

Urban Development (HUD) to initiate administrative sanctions against
petitioners, an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) concluded that petitioners should be debarred from participating in federal programs for 18
months. Under HUD regulations, an ALJ's determination "shall be
final unless . . . the Secretary . . . within 30 days of receipt of a request
decides as a matter of discretion to review the [ALJ's] finding . . . ." 24
CFR $ 24.314(c). Neither party sought further administrative review,
but petitioners filed suit in the District Court, seeking an injunction and
declaration that the sanctions were not in accordance with law within
the meaning of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Respondents
moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that petitioners, by forgoing the option to seek review by the Secretary, had failed to exhaust
their administrative remedies. The court denied the motion and
granted summary judgment to petitioners on the merits of the case.
The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the District Court had
erred in denying the motion to dismiss.

Held: Federal courts do not have the authority to require a plaintiff to

exhaust available administrative remedies before seeking judicial review under the APA, where neither the relevant statute nor agency
rules specifically mandate exhaustion as a prerequisite to judicial review. The language of $ 10(c) of the APA is explicit that an appeal to
"superior agency authority" is a prerequisite to judicial review only
when "expressly required by statute" or when the agency requires an
appeal "by rule and provides that the [administrative] action is . . .
inoperative" pending that review. Since neither the National Housing
Act nor applicable HUD regulations mandate further administrative appeals, the ALJ's decision was a "final" agency action subject to judicial
review under $ 10(c). The lower courts were not free to require further
exhaustion of administrative remedies, although the exhaustion doctrine
continues to apply as a matter of judicial discretion in cases not gov509us1102F 05-04-97 16:56:34 PAGES OPINPGT

This case presents the question whether federal courtshave the authority to require that a plaintiff exhaust available administrative remedies before seeking judicial reviewunder the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U. S. C.

$ 701 et seq., where neither the statute nor agency rules spe-cifically mandate exhaustion as a prerequisite to judicial review. At issue is the relationship between the judicially cre-ated doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies and

1 Section 10(c), 80 Stat. 392-393, 5 U. S. C. $ 704, provides:

"Agency action made reviewable by statute and final agency action for
which there is no other adequate remedy in a court are subject to judicial
review. A preliminary, procedural, or intermediate agency action or ruling not directly reviewable is subject to review on the review of the final
agency action. Except as otherwise expressly required by statute,
agency action otherwise final is final for the purposes of this section
whether or not there has been presented or determined an application for
a declaratory order, for any form of reconsideration, or, unless the agency
otherwise requires by rule and provides that the action meanwhile is inoperative, for an appeal to superior agency authority."

Opinion of the Court

I
Petitioner R. Gordon Darby 2 is a self-employed South Car-olina real estate developer who specializes in the development and management of multifamily rental projects. Inthe early 1980's, he began working with Lonnie Garvin, Jr.,
a mortgage banker, who had developed a plan to enablemultifamily developers to obtain single-family mortgage insurance from respondent Department of Housing and UrbanDevelopment (HUD). Respondent Secretary of HUD (Secretary) is authorized to provide single-family mortgage in-surance under $ 203(b) of the National Housing Act, 48 Stat.
1249, as amended, 12 U. S. C. $ 1709(b).3 Although HUDalso provides mortgage insurance for multifamily projects
under $ 207 of the National Housing Act, 12 U. S. C. $ 1713,the greater degree of oversight and control over such projects makes it less attractive for investors than the single-family mortgage insurance option.

The principal advantage of Garvin's plan was that it prom-ised to avoid HUD's "Rule of Seven." This rule prevented
rental properties from receiving single-family mortgage insurance if the mortgagor already had financial interests inseven or more similar rental properties in the same project

ral. The version of $ 10(c) as currently enacted, however, uses the singular "reconsideration." See this note, supra, at 138. We quote the text
as enacted in the Statutes at Large. See Stephan v. United States, 319
U. S. 423, 426 (1943) ("[T]he Code cannot prevail over the Statutes at
Large when the two are inconsistent").

2 Petitioners include R. Gordon Darby and his affiliate companies: Darby

Development Company; Darby Realty Company; Darby Management
Company, Inc.; MD Investment; Parkbrook Acres Associates; and Parkbrook Developers.

3 Although the primary purpose of the $ 203(b) insurance program was

to facilitate home ownership by owner-occupants, investors were permitted in the early 1980's to obtain single-family insurance under certain conditions. Private investor-owners are no longer eligible for single-family
mortgage insurance. See Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989, $ 143(b), 103 Stat. 2036.

Opinion of the Court
or subdivision. See 24 CFR $ 203.42(a) (1992).4 Under Gar-vin's plan, a person seeking financing would use straw purchasers as mortgage insurance applicants. Once the loanswere closed, the straw purchasers would transfer title back
to the development company. Because no single purchaserat the time of purchase would own more than seven rental
properties within the same project, the Rule of Seven ap-peared not to be violated. HUD employees in South Carolina apparently assured Garvin that his plan was lawful andthat he thereby would avoid the limitation of the Rule of
Seven.Darby obtained financing for three separate multiunit
projects, and, through Garvin's plan, Darby obtained single-family mortgage insurance from HUD. Although Darby
successfully rented the units, a combination of low rents, fall-ing interest rates, and a generally depressed rental market
forced him into default in 1988. HUD became responsiblefor the payment of over $6.6 million in insurance claims.

HUD had become suspicious of Garvin's financing plan asfar back as 1983. In 1986, HUD initiated an audit but concluded that neither Darby nor Garvin had done anythingwrong or misled HUD personnel. Nevertheless, in June
1989, HUD issued a limited denial of participation (LDP)that prohibited petitioners for one year from participating in
any program in South Carolina administered by respondentAssistant Secretary of Housing.

5 Two months later, the Assistant Secretary notified petitioners that HUD was also pro-posing to debar them from further participation in all HUD

4 Prior to August 31, 1955, the Rule of Seven apparently had been the
Rule of Eleven. See 24 CFR $ 203.42 (1982) and 56 Fed. Reg. 27692
(1991).

5 An LDP precludes its recipient from participating in any HUD "program," which includes "receipt of any benefit or financial assistance
through grants or contractual arrangements; benefits or assistance in the
form of loan guarantees or insurance; and awards of procurement contracts, notwithstanding any quid pro quo given and whether [HUD] gives
anything in return." 24 CFR $ 24.710(a)(2) (1992).

Opinion of the Court
procurement contracts and in any nonprocurement transac-tion with any federal agency. See 24 CFR $ 24.200 (1992).

Petitioners' appeals of the LDP and of the proposed debar-ment were consolidated, and an Administrative Law Judge
(ALJ) conducted a hearing on the consolidated appeals inDecember 1989. The judge issued an "Initial Decision and
Order" in April 1990, finding that the financing method usedby petitioners was "a sham which improperly circumvented
the Rule of Seven." App. to Pet. for Cert. 69a. The ALJconcluded, however, that most of the relevant facts had been
disclosed to local HUD employees, that petitioners lackedcriminal intent, and that Darby himself "genuinely cooperated with HUD to try [to] work out his financial dilemma andavoid foreclosure." Id., at 88a. In light of these mitigating
factors, the ALJ concluded that an indefinite debarmentwould be punitive and that it would serve no legitimate purpose; 6 good cause existed, however, to debar petitioners fora period of 18 months.

7 Id., at 90a.

Under HUD regulations,

"The hearing officer's determination shall be final un-less, pursuant to 24 CFR part 26, the Secretary or the

Secretary's designee, within 30 days of receipt of a re-quest decides as a matter of discretion to review the
finding of the hearing officer. The 30 day period fordeciding whether to review a determination may be extended upon written notice of such extension by the Sec-retary or his designee. Any party may request such a
review in writing within 15 days of receipt of the hear-ing officer's determination." 24 CFR $ 24.314(c) (1992).

6 According to HUD regulations, "[d]ebarment and suspension are serious actions which shall be used only in the public interest and for the
Federal Government's protection and not for purposes of punishment."
24 CFR $ 24.115(b) (1992).

7 The ALJ calculated the 18-month debarment period from June 19, 1989,

the date on which the LDP was imposed. The debarment would last until
December 19, 1990.

142 DARBY v. CISNEROS

Opinion of the Court
Neither petitioners nor respondents sought further administrative review of the ALJ's "Initial Decision and Order."

On May 31, 1990, petitioners filed suit in the United States
District Court for the District of South Carolina. They
sought an injunction and a declaration that the administrative sanctions were imposed for purposes of punishment, in
violation of HUD's own debarment regulations, and therefore were "not in accordance with law" within the meaning
of $ 10(e)(B)(1) of the APA, 5 U. S. C. $ 706(2)(A).

Respondents moved to dismiss the complaint on the
ground that petitioners, by forgoing the option to seek review by the Secretary, had failed to exhaust administrative
remedies. The District Court denied respondents' motion
to dismiss, reasoning that the administrative remedy was inadequate and that resort to that remedy would have been
futile. App. to Pet. for Cert. 29a. In a subsequent opinion,
the District Court granted petitioners' motion for summary
judgment, concluding that the "imposition of debarment in
this case encroached too heavily on the punitive side of the
line, and for those reasons was an abuse of discretion and not
in accordance with the law." Id., at 19a.

The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed.
Darby v. Kemp, 957 F. 2d 145 (1992). It recognized that
neither the National Housing Act nor HUD regulations expressly mandate exhaustion of administrative remedies prior
to filing suit. The court concluded, however, that the District Court had erred in denying respondents' motion to dismiss, because there was no evidence to suggest that further
review would have been futile or that the Secretary would
have abused his discretion by indefinitely extending the time
limitations for review.

The court denied petitioners' petition for rehearing with
suggestion for rehearing en banc. See App. to Pet. for Cert.
93a. In order to resolve the tension between this and the

Section 10(c) of the APA bears the caption "Actions re-viewable." It provides in its first two sentences that judicial review is available for "final agency action for whichthere is no other adequate remedy in a court," and that "preliminary, procedural, or intermediate agency action . . . issubject to review on the review of the final agency action."
The last sentence of $ 10(c) reads:

"Except as otherwise expressly required by statute,agency action otherwise final is final for the purposes of

this section whether or not there has been presented ordetermined an application for a declaratory order, for
any form of reconsideration [see n. 1, supra], or, unlessthe agency otherwise requires by rule and provides that
the action meanwhile is inoperative, for an appeal tosuperior agency authority." 80 Stat. 392-393, 5 U. S. C.

$ 704.
Petitioners argue that this provision means that a litigantseeking judicial review of a final agency action under the

APA need not exhaust available administrative remediesunless such exhaustion is expressly required by statute or
agency rule. According to petitioners, since $ 10(c) containsan explicit exhaustion provision, federal courts are not free
to require further exhaustion as a matter of judicialdiscretion.

8 The Fourth Circuit's ruling in this case appears to be consistent with
Montgomery v. Rumsfeld, 572 F. 2d 250, 253-254 (CA9 1978), and Missouri v. Bowen, 813 F. 2d 864 (CA8 1987), but is in considerable tension

144 DARBY v. CISNEROS

Opinion of the Court
Respondents contend that $ 10(c) is concerned solely withtiming, that is, when agency actions become "final," and that

Congress had no intention to interfere with the courts' abil-ity to impose conditions on the timing of their exercise of
jurisdiction to review final agency actions. Respondentsconcede that petitioners' claim is "final" under $ 10(c), for neither the National Housing Act nor applicable HUD regula-tions require that a litigant pursue further administrative
appeals prior to seeking judicial review. However, eventhough nothing in $ 10(c) precludes judicial review of petitioners' claim, respondents argue that federal courts remainfree under the APA to impose appropriate exhaustion
requirements.9We have recognized that the judicial doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies is conceptually distinct fromthe doctrine of finality:

"[T]he finality requirement is concerned with whetherthe initial decisionmaker has arrived at a definitive position on the issue that inflicts an actual, concrete injury;the exhaustion requirement generally refers to administrative and judicial procedures by which an injuredparty may seek review of an adverse decision and obtain
a remedy if the decision is found to be unlawful or other-wise inappropriate." Williamson County Regional
Planning Comm'n v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City,473 U. S. 172, 193 (1985).

Whether courts are free to impose an exhaustion require-ment as a matter of judicial discretion depends, at least in
part, on whether Congress has provided otherwise, for "[o]f

9 Respondents also have argued that under HUD regulations, petitioners' debarment remains "inoperative" pending review by the Secretary.
See 48 Fed. Reg. 43304 (1983). But this fact alone is insufficient under

$ 10(c) to mandate exhaustion prior to judicial review, for the agency also
must require such exhaustion by rule. Respondents concede that HUD
imposes no such exhaustion requirement. Brief for Respondents 31.

Opinion of the Court
`paramount importance' to any exhaustion inquiry is congres-sional intent,"

McCarthy v. Madigan, 503 U. S. 140, 144
(1992), quoting Patsy v. Board of Regents of Florida, 457U. S. 496, 501 (1982). We therefore must consider whether

$ 10(c), by providing the conditions under which agency action becomes "final for the purposes of " judicial review, lim-its the authority of courts to impose additional exhaustion

requirements as a prerequisite to judicial review.It perhaps is surprising that it has taken over 45 years
since the passage of the APA for this Court definitively toaddress this question. Professor Davis noted in 1958 that

$ 10(c) had been almost completely ignored in judicial opinions, see 3 K. Davis, Administrative Law Treatise $ 20.08,
p. 101 (1958); he reiterated that observation 25 years later,
noting that the "provision is relevant in hundreds of cases
and is customarily overlooked." 4 K. Davis, Administrative
Law Treatise $ 26.12, pp. 468-469 (2d ed. 1983). Only a
handful of opinions in the Courts of Appeals have considered
the effect of $ 10(c) on the general exhaustion doctrine. See
n. 8, supra.

This Court has had occasion, however, to consider $ 10(c)
in other contexts. For example, in ICC v. Locomotive Engineers, 482 U. S. 270 (1987), we recognized that the plain language of $ 10(c), which provides that an agency action is final
"whether or not there has been presented or determined an
application" for any form of reconsideration, could be read to
suggest that the agency action is final regardless whether a
motion for reconsideration has been filed. We noted, however, that $ 10(c) "has long been construed by this and other
courts merely to relieve parties from the requirement of petitioning for rehearing before seeking judicial review (unless,
of course, specifically required to do so by statute--see, e. g.,
15 U. S. C. $$ 717r, 3416(a)), but not to prevent petitions for
reconsideration that are actually filed from rendering the orders under reconsideration nonfinal" (emphasis in original).

146 DARBY v. CISNEROS

Opinion of the Court
In Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U. S. 879 (1988), we wereconcerned with whether relief available in the Claims Court

was an "adequate remedy in a court" so as to preclude re-view in Federal District Court of a final agency action under
the first sentence of $ 10(c). We concluded that "although
the primary thrust of [$ 10(c)] was to codify the exhaustionrequirement,"

id., at 903, Congress intended by that provision simply to avoid duplicating previously established spe-cial statutory procedures for review of agency actions.

While some dicta in these cases might be claimed to lendsupport to respondents' interpretation of $ 10(c), the text of
the APA leaves little doubt that petitioners are correct.
Under $ 10(a) of the APA, "[a] person suffering legal wrong
because of agency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved
by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute,
is entitled to judicial review thereof." 5 U. S. C. $ 702 (emphasis added). Although $ 10(a) provides the general right
to judicial review of agency actions under the APA, $ 10(c)
establishes when such review is available. When an aggrieved party has exhausted all administrative remedies expressly prescribed by statute or agency rule, the agency action is "final for the purposes of this section" and therefore
"subject to judicial review" under the first sentence. While
federal courts may be free to apply, where appropriate, other
prudential doctrines of judicial administration to limit the
scope and timing of judicial review, $ 10(c), by its very terms,
has limited the availability of the doctrine of exhaustion of
administrative remedies to that which the statute or rule
clearly mandates.

The last sentence of $ 10(c) refers explicitly to "any form
of reconsideration" and "an appeal to superior agency authority." Congress clearly was concerned with making the
exhaustion requirement unambiguous so that aggrieved parties would know precisely what administrative steps were
required before judicial review would be available. If courts
were able to impose additional exhaustion requirements be509us1102F 05-04-97 16:56:34 PAGES OPINPGT

147Cite as: 509 U. S. 137 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
yond those provided by Congress or the agency, the last sentence of $ 10(c) would make no sense. To adopt respondents'
reading would transform $ 10(c) from a provision designed to
" `remove obstacles to judicial review of agency action,' "
Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U. S., at 904, quoting Shaughnessy v. Pedreiro, 349 U. S. 48, 51 (1955), into a trap for unwary litigants. Section 10(c) explicitly requires exhaustion
of all intra-agency appeals mandated either by statute or by
agency rule; it would be inconsistent with the plain language
of $ 10(c) for courts to require litigants to exhaust optional
appeals as well.

III

Recourse to the legislative history of $ 10(c) is unnecessary
in light of the plain meaning of the statutory text. Nevertheless, we consider that history briefly because both sides have
spent much of their time arguing about its implications. In
its report on the APA, the Senate Judiciary Committee explained that the last sentence of $ 10(c) was "designed to implement the provisions of section 8(a)." Section 8(a), now
codified, as amended, as 5 U. S. C. $ 557(b), provides, unless
the agency requires otherwise, that an initial decision made
by a hearing officer "becomes the decision of the agency
without further proceedings unless there is an appeal to, or
review on motion of, the agency within time provided by
rule." The Judiciary Committee explained:

"[A]n agency may permit an examiner to make the initial
decision in a case, which becomes the agency's decision
in the absence of an appeal to or review by the agency.
If there is such review or appeal, the examiner's initial
decision becomes inoperative until the agency determines the matter. For that reason this subsection
[$ 10(c)] permits an agency also to require by rule that,
if any party is not satisfied with the initial decision of a
subordinate hearing officer, the party must first appeal
to the agency (the decision meanwhile being inopera509us1102F 05-04-97 16:56:34 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
tive) before resorting to the courts. In no case may ap-peal to `superior agency authority' be required by rule

unless the administrative decision meanwhile is inopera-tive, because otherwise the effect of such a requirement
would be to subject the party to the agency action andto repetitious administrative process without recourse.
There is a fundamental inconsistency in requiring aperson to continue `exhausting' administrative processes
after administrative action has become, and while it re-mains, effective." S. Rep. No. 752, 79th Cong., 1st Sess.,
27 (1945); Administrative Procedure Act: LegislativeHistory 1944-1946, S. Doc. No. 248, 79th Cong., 2d Sess.,
213 (1946) (hereinafter Leg. Hist.).
In a statement appended to a letter dated October 19,1945, to the Judiciary Committee, Attorney General Tom C.

Clark set forth his understanding of the effect of $ 10(c):

"This subsection states (subject to the provisions of sec-tion 10(a)) the acts which are reviewable under section

10. It is intended to state existing law. The lastsentence makes it clear that the doctrine of exhaustion
of administrative remedies with respect to finality ofagency action is intended to be applied only (1) where
expressly required by statute . . . or (2) where theagency's rules require that decisions by subordinate officers must be appealed to superior agency authority be-fore the decision may be regarded as final for purposes
of judicial review." Id., at 44, Leg. Hist. 230.10
10 In his manual on the APA, prepared in 1947, to which we have given
some deference, see, e. g., Steadman v. SEC, 450 U. S. 91, 103, n. 22 (1981);
Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Resources Defense
Council, Inc., 435 U. S. 519, 546 (1978), Attorney General Clark reiterated
the Department of Justice's view that $ 10(c) "embodies the doctrine of
exhaustion of administrative remedies. . . . Agency action which is finally
operative and decisive is reviewable." Attorney General's Manual on the
Administrative Procedure Act 103 (1947). See also H. R. Rep. No. 1980,

Opinion of the Court
Respondents place great weight on the Attorney General'sstatement that $ 10(c) "is intended to state existing law."

That law, according to respondents, "plainly permitted fed-eral courts to require exhaustion of adequate administrative
remedies." Brief for Respondents 19-20. We cannot agree
with this categorical pronouncement. With respect to theexhaustion of motions for administrative reconsideration or

rehearing, the trend in pre-APA cases was in the oppositedirection. In

Vandalia R. Co. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of
Ind., 242 U. S. 255 (1916), for example, this Court invokedthe "general rule" that "one aggrieved by the rulings of such

an administrative tribunal may not complain that the Consti-tution of the United States has been violated if he has not
availed himself of the remedies prescribed by the state law
for a rectification of such rulings." Id., at 261. The statelaw provided only that the Railroad Commission had the authority to grant a rehearing; it did not require that a rehear-ing be sought. Nevertheless, "since the record shows that
plaintiff in error and its associates were accorded a rehearingupon the very question of modification, but abandoned it,
nothing more need be said upon that point." Ibid.Seven years later, in

Prendergast v. New York Telephone
Co., 262 U. S. 43, 48 (1923), without even mentioning the Vandalia case, the Court stated:

"It was not necessary that the Company should applyto the Commission for a rehearing before resorting to

the court. While under the Public Service Commission
Law any person interested in an order of the Commis-sion has the right to apply for a rehearing, the Commission is not required to grant such rehearing unless in itsjudgment sufficient reasons therefor appear . . . . As
the law does not require an application for a rehearing
agency's authority to adopt rules requiring a party to take a timely appeal
to the agency prior to seeking judicial review as "an application of the
time-honored doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies").

to be made and its granting is entirely within the discretion of the Commission, we see no reason for requiring
it to be made as a condition precedent to the bringing
of a suit to enjoin the enforcement of the order."

Accord, Banton v. Belt Line R. Corp., 268 U. S. 413, 416-417
(1925) ("No application to the commission for relief was required by the state law. None was necessary as a condition
precedent to the suit").

Shortly before Congress adopted the APA, the Court, in
Levers v. Anderson, 326 U. S. 219 (1945), held that where a
federal statute provides that a district supervisor of the Alcohol Tax Unit of the Bureau of Internal Revenue "may hear
the application" for a rehearing of an order denying certain
liquor permits, such an application was not a prerequisite to
judicial review. Nothing "persuades us that the `may'
means must, or that the Supervisors were required to hear
oral argument." Id., at 223 (emphasis added). Despite the
fact that the regulations permitted a stay pending the motion for reconsideration, the Court concluded that "the motion is in its effect so much like the normal, formal type of
motion for rehearing that we cannot read into the Act an
intention to make it a prerequisite to the judicial review specifically provided by Congress." Id., at 224.

Respondents in effect concede that the trend in the law
prior to the enactment of the APA was to require exhaustion
of motions for administrative reconsideration or rehearing
only when explicitly mandated by statute. Respondents
argue, however, that the law governing the exhaustion of
administrative appeals prior to the APA was significantly
different from $ 10(c) as petitioners would have us interpret
it. Brief for Respondents 23. Respondents rely on United
States v. Sing Tuck, 194 U. S. 161 (1904), in which the Court
considered whether, under the relevant statute, an aggrieved
party had to appeal an adverse decision by the Inspector of
Immigration to the Secretary of Commerce and Labor before

judicial review would be available.11 It recognized that therelevant statute "points out a mode of procedure which must

be followed before there can be a resort to the courts," id.,at 167, and that a party must go through "the preliminary
sifting process provided by the statutes," id., at 170. Ac-cord,

Nothing in this pre-APA history, however, supports re-spondents' argument that initial decisions that were "final"

for purposes of judicial review were nonetheless unreview-able unless and until an administrative appeal was taken.
The pre-APA cases concerning judicial review of federalagency action stand for the simple proposition that, until an
administrative appeal was taken, the agency action was un-reviewable because it was not yet "final." This is hardly
surprising, given the fact that few, if any, administrativeagencies authorized hearing officers to make final agency decisions prior to the enactment of the APA. See Federal Ad-ministrative Law Developments--1971, 1972 Duke L. J. 115,
295, n. 22 ("[P]rior to the passage of the APA, the existingagencies ordinarily lacked the authority to make binding de11 The Act of August 18, 1894, 28 Stat. 390, provided: "In every case
where an alien is excluded from admission into the United States under
any law or treaty now existing or hereafter made, the decision of the

of such alien, shall be final, unless reversed on appeal to the Secretary of
[Commerce and Labor]."

12 In an address to the American Bar Association in 1940, Dean Stason

of the University of Michigan Law School summarized the law on exhaustion of administrative appeals: "In the event that a statute setting up an
administrative tribunal also creates one or more appellate administrative
tribunals, it is almost invariably held that a party who is aggrieved by
action of the initial agency must first seek relief by recourse to the appellate agency or agencies." Stason, Timing of Judicial Redress from Erroneous Administrative Action, 25 Minn. L. Rev. 560, 570 (1941). See also
4 K. Davis, Administrative Law Treatise $ 26.12, p. 469 (2d ed. 1983) ("The
pre-1946 law was established that an appeal to higher administrative authorities was a prerequisite to judicial review").

Opinion of the Court
terminations at a level below that of the agency board orcommission, so that section 10(c) would be expected to affect

the exhaustion doctrine in only a very limited number ofinstances").

The purpose of $ 10(c) was to permit agencies to requirean appeal to "superior agency authority" before an examiner's initial decision became final. This was necessary be-cause, under $ 8(a), initial decisions could become final agency
decisions in the absence of an agency appeal. See 5 U. S. C.$ 557(b). Agencies may avoid the finality of an initial decision, first, by adopting a rule that an agency appeal be takenbefore judicial review is available, and, second, by providing
that the initial decision would be "inoperative" pending ap-peal. Otherwise, the initial decision becomes final and the
aggrieved party is entitled to judicial review.Respondents also purport to find support for their view in
the text and legislative history of the 1976 amendments ofthe APA. After eliminating the defense of sovereign immunity in APA cases, Congress provided: "Nothing herein . . .affects other limitations on judicial review or the power or
duty of the court to dismiss any action or deny relief on anyother appropriate legal or equitable ground," Pub. L. 94-574,

$ 1, 90 Stat. 2721 (codified as 5 U. S. C. $ 702). According torespondents, Congress intended by this proviso to ensure
that the judicial doctrine of exhaustion of administrativeremedies would continue to apply under the APA to permit
federal courts to refuse to review agency actions that werenonetheless final under $ 10(c). See S. Rep. No. 94-996, p. 11
(1976) (among the limitations on judicial review that re-mained unaffected by the 1976 amendments was the "failure
to exhaust administrative remedies").13

13 Respondents also rely on then-Assistant Attorney General Scalia's letter to the Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Administrative Practice and Procedure where he wrote that the Department of Justice supported the amendment in large part because it expected that many (or
most) of the cases disposed of on the basis of sovereign immunity could

153Cite as: 509 U. S. 137 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
Putting to one side the obvious problems with relying onpostenactment legislative history, see, e. g., United States v.

Texas, 507 U. S. 529, 535, n. 4 (1993); Pension Benefit Guar-anty Corporation v. LTV Corp., 496 U. S. 633, 650 (1990), the
proviso was added in 1976 simply to make clear that "[a]llother than the law of sovereign immunity remain unchanged," S. Rep. No. 94-996, at 11. The elimination of thedefense of sovereign immunity did not affect any other limitation on judicial review that would otherwise apply underthe APA. As already discussed, the exhaustion doctrine
continues to exist under the APA to the extent that it isrequired by statute or by agency rule as a prerequisite to
judicial review. Therefore, there is nothing inconsistent be-tween the 1976 amendments to the APA and our reading
of $ 10(c). IV

We noted just last Term in a non-APA case that

"appropriate deference to Congress' power to prescribethe basic procedural scheme under which a claim may

be heard in a federal court requires fashioning of ex-haustion principles in a manner consistent with congressional intent and any applicable statutory scheme."
McCarthy v. Madigan, 503 U. S., at 144.

Appropriate deference in this case requires the recognitionthat, with respect to actions brought under the APA, Congress effectively codified the doctrine of exhaustion of ad-ministrative remedies in $ 10(c). Of course, the exhaustion

have been decided the same way on other legal grounds such as the failure
to exhaust administrative remedies. S. Rep. No. 94-996, pp. 25-26 (1976).
See also 1 Recommendations and Reports of the Administrative Conference of the United States 222 (1968-1970) (urging Congress to adopt the
very language that was eventually incorporated verbatim into the 1976
amendment so that "the abolition of sovereign immunity will not result
in undue judicial interference with governmental operations or a flood of
burdensome litigation").

Opinion of the Court
doctrine continues to apply as a matter of judicial discretionin cases not governed by the APA. But where the APA

applies, an appeal to "superior agency authority" is a prereq-uisite to judicial review only when expressly required by
statute or when an agency rule requires appeal before re-view and the administrative action is made inoperative pending that review. Courts are not free to impose an exhaus-tion requirement as a rule of judicial administration where
the agency action has already become "final" under $ 10(c).The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and
the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent withthis opinion.

It is so ordered.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe second circuit

No. 92-344. Argued March 2, 1993--Decided June 21, 1993
An Executive Order directs the Coast Guard to intercept vessels illegally

transporting passengers from Haiti to the United States and to return
those passengers to Haiti without first determining whether they qualify as refugees, but "authorize[s] [such forced repatriation] to be undertaken only beyond the territorial sea of the United States." Respondents, organizations representing interdicted Haitians and a number of
Haitians, sought a temporary restraining order, contending that the Executive Order violates $ 243(h)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality
Act of 1952 (INA or Act) and Article 33 of the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. The District Court denied
relief, concluding that $ 243(h)(1) does not protect aliens in international
waters and that the Convention's provisions are not self-executing. In
reversing, the Court of Appeals held, inter alia, that $ 243(h)(1) does
not apply only to aliens within the United States and that Article 33,
like the statute, covers all refugees, regardless of location.

Held: Neither $ 243(h) nor Article 33 limits the President's power to order

the Coast Guard to repatriate undocumented aliens intercepted on the
high seas. Pp. 170-188.

(a) The INA's text and structure demonstrate that $ 243(h)(1)--which
provides that "[t]he Attorney General shall not deport or return any
alien . . . to a country if the Attorney General determines that such
alien's life or freedom would be threatened in such country . . ."--applies
only in the context of the domestic procedures by which the Attorney
General determines whether deportable and excludable aliens may remain in the United States. In the light of other INA provisions that
expressly confer upon the President and other officials certain responsibilities under the immigration laws, $ 243(h)(1)'s reference to the Attorney General cannot reasonably be construed to describe either the President or the Coast Guard. Moreover, the reference suggests that the
section applies only to the Attorney General's normal responsibilities
under the INA, particularly her conduct of deportation and exclusion
hearings in which requests for asylum or for withholding of deportation
under $ 243(h) are ordinarily advanced. Since the INA nowhere pro509us1u103 05-04-97 17:10:21 PAGES OPINPGT
156 SALE v. HAITIAN CENTERS COUNCIL, INC.

Syllabus
vides for the conduct of such proceedings outside the United States,
since Part V of the Act, in which $ 243 is located, obviously contemplates
that they be held in this country, and since it is presumed that Acts of
Congress do not ordinarily apply outside the borders, see, e. g., EEOC
v. Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244, $ 243(h)(1) must be construed to apply only within United States territory. That the word
"return" in $ 243(h)(1) is not limited to aliens in this country does not
render the section applicable extraterritorially, since it must reasonably
be concluded that Congress used the phrase "deport or return" only to
make the section's protection available both in proceedings to deport
aliens already in the country and proceedings to exclude those already
at the border. Pp. 171-174.

(b) The history of the Refugee Act of 1980--which amended

$ 243(h)(1) by adding the phrase "or return" and deleting the phrase
"within the United States" following "any alien"--confirms that $ 243(h)
does not have extraterritorial application. The foregoing are the only
relevant changes made by the 1980 amendment, and they are fully explained by the intent, plainly identified in the legislative history, to apply

$ 243(h) to exclusion as well as to deportation proceedings. There is no
change in the 1980 amendment, however, that could only be explained by
an assumption that Congress also intended to provide for the statute's
extraterritorial application. It would have been extraordinary for Congress to make such an important change in the law without any mention
of that possible effect. Pp. 174-177.

(c) Article 33's text--which provides that "[n]o . . . State shall expel
or return (`refouler') a refugee . . . to . . . territories where his life or
freedom would be threatened . . . ," Article 33.1, and that "[t]he benefit
of the present provision may not . . . be claimed by a refugee whom
there are reasonable grounds for regarding as a danger to the security
of the country in which he is [located]," Article 33.2--affirmatively indicates that it was not intended to have extraterritorial effect. First, if
Article 33.1 applied on the high seas, Article 33.2 would create an absurd
anomaly: Dangerous aliens in extraterritorial waters would be entitled
to 33.1's benefits because they would not be in any "country" under 33.2,
while dangerous aliens residing in the country that sought to expel them
would not be so entitled. It is more reasonable to assume that 33.2's
coverage was limited to those already in the country because it was
understood that 33.1 obligated the signatory state only with respect to
aliens within its territory. Second, Article 33.1's use of the words
"expel or return" as an obvious parallel to the words "deport or return"
in $ 243(h)(1) suggests that "return" in 33.1 refers to exclusion proceedings, see Leng May Ma v. Barber, 357 U. S. 185, 187, and therefore has
a legal meaning narrower than its common meaning. This suggestion is
reinforced by the parenthetical reference to the French word "refouler,"

Syllabus
which is not an exact synonym for the English word "return," but has
been interpreted by respected dictionaries to mean, among other things,
"expel." Although gathering fleeing refugees and returning them to
the one country they had desperately sought to escape may violate the
spirit of Article 33, general humanitarian intent cannot impose uncontemplated obligations on treaty signatories. Pp. 179-183.

(d) Although not dispositive, the Convention's negotiating history--
which indicates, inter alia, that the right of non-refoulement applies
only to aliens physically present in the host country, that the term "refouler" was included in Article 33 to avoid concern about an inappropriately broad reading of the word "return," and that the Convention's
limited reach resulted from a hard-fought bargain--solidly supports the
foregoing conclusion. Pp. 184-187.

Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court.
The President has directed the Coast Guard to interceptvessels illegally transporting passengers from Haiti to the

United States and to return those passengers to Haiti with-out first determining whether they may qualify as refugees.
The question presented in this case is whether such forcedrepatriation, "authorized to be undertaken only beyond the
territorial sea of the United States," 1 violates $ 243(h)(1) ofthe Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (INA or Act).

$ 203(e) of the Refugee Act of 1980, Pub. L. 96-212, 94 Stat. 107. Section
243(h)(1) provides:

"(h) Withholding of deportation or return. (1) The Attorney General
shall not deport or return any alien (other than an alien described in section 1251(a)(4)(D) of this title) to a country if the Attorney General determines that such alien's life or freedom would be threatened in such country
on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social
group, or political opinion."

"(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any alien if the Attorney General

We hold that neither $ 243(h) nor Article 33 of the UnitedNations Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees

to action taken by the Coast Guard on the high seas.

I
Aliens residing illegally in the United States are subjectto deportation after a formal hearing.

4 Aliens arriving at

the border, or those who are temporarily paroled into thecountry, are subject to an exclusion hearing, the less formal

process by which they, too, may eventually be removed fromthe United States.

5 In either a deportation or exclusion

proceeding the alien may seek asylum as a political refugeefor whom removal to a particular country may threaten his

life or freedom. Requests that the Attorney General grantasylum or withhold deportation to a particular country are
typically, but not necessarily, advanced as parallel claims ineither a deportation or an exclusion proceeding.

6 When an

alien proves that he is a "refugee," the Attorney General hasdiscretion to grant him asylum pursuant to $ 208 of the Act.

If the proof shows that it is more likely than not that thealien's life or freedom would be threatened in a particular
country because of his political or religious beliefs, under$ 243(h) the Attorney General must not send him to that

States, the INA (in its use of the term exclusion) treats them as though
they had never been admitted; $ 1226(a), for example, says that the special
inquiry officer shall determine "whether an arriving alien . . . shall be
allowed to enter or shall be excluded and deported." Aliens subject to
either deportation or exclusion are eventually subjected to a physical act
referred to as "deportation," but we shall refer, as immigration law generally refers, to the former as "deportables" and the latter as "excludables."

country.7 The INA offers these statutory protections onlyto aliens who reside in or have arrived at the border of the

United States. For 12 years, in one form or another, theinterdiction program challenged here has prevented Haitians
such as respondents from reaching our shores and invoking
those protections.

On September 23, 1981, the United States and the Republic of Haiti entered into an agreement authorizing the United
States Coast Guard to intercept vessels engaged in the illegal transportation of undocumented aliens to our shores.
While the parties agreed to prosecute "illegal traffickers,"
the Haitian Government also guaranteed that its repatriated
citizens would not be punished for their illegal departure.8
The agreement also established that the United States Government would not return any passengers "whom the United
States authorities determine[d] to qualify for refugee status." App. 382.

On September 29, 1981, President Reagan issued a proclamation in which he characterized "the continuing illegal migration by sea of large numbers of undocumented aliens
into the southeastern United States" as "a serious national
problem detrimental to the interests of the United States."
Presidential Proclamation No. 4865, 3 CFR 50-51 (1981-1983

Guard to intercept vessels carrying such aliens and to return
them to their point of origin. His Executive Order expressly "provided, however, that no person who is a refu7 Id., at 424-425, 426, n. 20.

In the ensuing decade, the Coast Guard interdictedapproximately 25,000 Haitian migrants.

10 After interviews

conducted on board Coast Guard cutters, aliens who were
identified as economic migrants were "screened out" and
promptly repatriated. Those who made a credible showing
of political refugee status were "screened in" and trans9 That proviso reflected an opinion of the Office of Legal Counsel that
Article 33 of the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of
Refugees imposed some procedural obligations on the United States with
respect to refugees outside United States territory. That opinion was
later withdrawn after consideration was given to the contrary views expressed by the legal adviser to the State Department. See App. 202-230.

10 Id., at 231. In 1985 the District Court for the District of Columbia

upheld the interdiction program, specifically finding that $ 243(h) provided
relief only to Haitians in the United States. Haitian Refugee Center, Inc.
v. Gracey, 600 F. Supp. 1396, 1406. On appeal from that holding, the Court
of Appeals noted that "over 78 vessels carrying more than 1800 Haitians
have been interdicted. The government states that it has interviewed all
interdicted Haitians and none has presented a bona fide claim to refugee
status. Accordingly, to date all interdictees have been returned to Haiti."

794, 797 (1987). The Court affirmed the judgment of the District Court
on the ground that the plaintiffs in that case did not have standing, but
in a separate opinion Judge Edwards agreed with the District Court on
the merits. He concluded that neither the United Nations Protocol
nor $ 243(h) was "intended to govern parties' conduct outside of their
national borders.. . . . .

"The other best evidence of the meaning of the Protocol may be found
in the United States' understanding of it at the time of accession. There
can be no doubt that the Executive and the Senate decisions to adhere
were made in the belief that the Protocol worked no substantive change
in existing immigration law. At that time `[t]he relief authorized by

$ 243(h) [8 U. S. C. $ 1253(h)] was not . . . available to aliens at the border
seeking refuge in the United States due to persecution.' " Id., at 413-414,

On September 30, 1991, a group of military leadersdisplaced the government of Jean Bertrand Aristide, the

first democratically elected president in Haitian history. Asthe District Court stated in an uncontested finding of fact,
since the military coup "hundreds of Haitians have been
killed, tortured, detained without a warrant, or subjected toviolence and the destruction of their property because of

their political beliefs. Thousands have been forced into hid-ing." App. to Pet. for Cert. 144a. Following the coup the
Coast Guard suspended repatriations for a period of severalweeks, and the United States imposed economic sanctions
on Haiti.

On November 18, 1991, the Coast Guard announced that itwould resume the program of interdiction and forced repatriation. The following day, the Haitian Refugee Center, Inc.,
representing a class of interdicted Haitians, filed a complaint
in the United States District Court for the Southern District

11 A "refugee" as defined in 8 U. S. C. $ 1101(a)(42)(A), is entitled to apply
for a discretionary grant of asylum pursuant to 8 U. S. C. $ 1158. The
term "refugee" includes "any person who is outside any country of such
person's nationality or, in the case of a person having no nationality, is
outside any country in which such person last habitually resided, and who
is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail
himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political
opinion . . . ."

Section 1158(a) provides: "The Attorney General shall establish a procedure for an alien physically present in the United States or at a land
border or port of entry, irrespective of such alien's status, to apply for
asylum, and the alien may be granted asylum in the discretion of the Attorney General if the Attorney General determines that such alien is a
refugee within the meaning of section 1101(a)(42)(A) of this title." (Emphasis added.) This standard for asylum is similar to, but not quite as strict
as, the standard applicable to a withholding of deportation pursuant to

$ 243(h)(1). See generally INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U. S. 421 (1987).

of Florida alleging that the Government had failed to estab-lish and implement adequate procedures to protect Haitians

who qualified for asylum. The District Court granted tem-porary relief that precluded any repatriations until February
4, 1992, when a reversal on appeal in the Court of Appeals
for the Eleventh Circuit and a denial of certiorari by thisCourt effectively terminated that litigation. See

Haitian
Refugee Center, Inc. v. Baker, 949 F. 2d 1109 (1991) (per curiam), cert. denied, 502 U. S. 1122 (1992).

In the meantime the Haitian exodus expanded dramati-cally. During the six months after October 1991, the Coast

Guard interdicted over 34,000 Haitians. Because so many
interdicted Haitians could not be safely processed on Coast
Guard cutters, the Department of Defense established temporary facilities at the United States Naval Base in Guantanamo, Cuba, to accommodate them during the screening
process. Those temporary facilities, however, had a capacity of only about 12,500 persons. In the first three weeks of
May 1992, the Coast Guard intercepted 127 vessels (many
of which were considered unseaworthy, overcrowded, and
unsafe); those vessels carried 10,497 undocumented aliens.
On May 22, 1992, the United States Navy determined that
no additional migrants could safely be accommodated at
Guantanamo. App. 231-233.

With both the facilities at Guantanamo and available
Coast Guard cutters saturated, and with the number of
Haitian emigrants in unseaworthy craft increasing (many
had drowned as they attempted the trip to Florida), the
Government could no longer both protect our borders and
offer the Haitians even a modified screening process. It had
to choose between allowing Haitians into the United States
for the screening process or repatriating them without giving them any opportunity to establish their qualifications
as refugees. In the judgment of the President's advisers,
the first choice not only would have defeated the original
purpose of the program (controlling illegal immigration),

but also would have impeded diplomatic efforts to restore
democratic government in Haiti and would have posed a

life-threatening danger to thousands of persons embarking
on long voyages in dangerous craft.12 The second choice
would have advanced those policies but deprived the fleeing
Haitians of any screening process at a time when a significant minority of them were being screened in. See id., at
66.

On May 23, 1992, President Bush adopted the second
choice.13 After assuming office, President Clinton decided

Respondents filed this lawsuit in the United States Dis-trict Court for the Eastern District of New York on March

18, 1992--before the promulgation of Executive Order No.12807. The plaintiffs include organizations that represent
interdicted Haitians as well as Haitians who were then beingdetained at Guantanamo. They sued the Commissioner of
the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the AttorneyGeneral, the Secretary of State, the Commandant of the
Coast Guard, and the Commander of the Guantanamo NavalBase, complaining that the screening procedures provided on
Coast Guard cutters and at Guantanamo did not adequatelyprotect their statutory and treaty rights to apply for refugee
status and avoid repatriation to Haiti.They alleged that the September 1991 coup had "triggered
a continuing widely publicized reign of terror in Haiti"; thatover 1,500 Haitians were believed to "have been killed or
subjected to violence and destruction of their property be-cause of their political beliefs and affiliations"; and that thousands of Haitian refugees "have set out in small boats that
tinued orderly processing of more than 12,000 Haitians presently at
Guantanamo.

"Through broadcasts on the Voice of America and public statements in
the Haitian media we continue to urge Haitians not to attempt the dangerous sea journey to the United States. Last week alone eighteen Haitians
perished when their vessel capsized off the Cuban coast.

"Under current circumstances, the safety of Haitians is best assured by
remaining in their country. We urge any Haitians who fear persecution
to avail themselves of our refugee processing service at our Embassy in
Port-au-Prince. The Embassy has been processing refugee claims since
February. We utilize this special procedure in only four countries in the
world. We are prepared to increase the American embassy staff in Haiti
for refugee processing if necessary." App. 327.

the hazards of a prolonged journey over high seas in searchof safety and freedom." App. 24.

In April, the District Court granted the plaintiffs a prelim-inary injunction requiring defendants to give Haitians on
Guantanamo access to counsel for the screening process.We stayed that order on April 22, 1992, 503 U. S. 1000, and,
while the defendants' appeal from it was pending, the Presi-dent issued the Executive Order now under attack. Plaintiffs then applied for a temporary restraining order to enjoinimplementation of the Executive Order. They contended
that it violated $ 243(h) of the Act and Article 33 of theUnited Nations Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees.
The District Court denied the application because it con-cluded that $ 243(h) is "unavailable as a source of relief
for Haitian aliens in international waters," and that such astatutory provision was necessary because the Protocol's
provisions are not "self-executing." App. to Pet. for Cert.166a-168a.

such as INS v. Cardoza Fonseca, 480 U. S. 421 (1987) and INS v. Stevic,

16 "Before 1980, $ 243(h) distinguished between two groups of aliens:

those `within the United States', and all others. After 1980, $ 243(h)(1)
no longer recognized that distinction, although $ 243(h)(2)(C) preserves it
for the limited purposes of the `serious nonpolitical crime' exception. The
government's reading would require us to rewrite $ 243(h)(1) into its pre1980 status, but we may not add terms or provisions where congress has
omitted them, see Gregory v. Ashcroft, [501 U. S. 452, 467] (1991); West
Virginia Univ. Hosps., Inc. v. Casey, [499 U. S. 83, 101] (1991), and this
restraint is even more compelling when congress has specifically removed
a term from a statute: `Few principles of statutory construction are more
compelling than the proposition that Congress does not intend sub silentio
to enact statutory language that it has earlier discarded.' Nachman

17 "The statute's location in Part V reflects its original placement there

before 1980--when $ 243(h) applied by its terms only to `deportation'.
Since 1980, however, $ 243(h)(1) has applied to more than just `deportation'--it applies to `return' as well (the former is necessarily limited to
aliens `in the United States', the latter applies to all aliens). Thus, $ 243,
which applies to all aliens, regardless of whereabouts, has broader application than most other portions of Part V, each of which is limited by its
terms to aliens `in' or `within' the United States; but the fact that $ 243 is
surrounded by sections more limited in application has no bearing on the
proper reading of $ 243 itself." Id., at 1360.

aliens intercepted on the high seas.

Nor did the Court of Appeals accept the Government's reliance on Article 33 of the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees.18 It recognized that the 1980
amendment to the INA had been intended to conform our
statutory law to the provisions of the Convention,19 but it
read Article 33.1's prohibition against return, like the statute's, "plainly" to cover "all refugees, regardless of location."
969 F. 2d, at 1362. This reading was supported by the "object and purpose" not only of that Article but also of the
Convention as a whole.20 While the Court of Appeals recognized that the negotiating history of the Convention disclosed that the representatives of at least six countries 21 construed the Article more narrowly, it thought that those views
might have represented a dissenting position and that, in any
event, it would "turn statutory construction on its head" to

19 See INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U. S., at 436-437. Although the

United States is not a signatory to the Convention itself, in 1968 it acceded
to the United Nations Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, which
bound the parties to comply with Articles 2 through 34 of the Convention
as to persons who had become refugees because of events taking place
after January 1, 1951. See INS v. Stevic, 467 U. S., at 416. Because the
Convention established Article 33, and the Protocol merely incorporated
it, we shall refer throughout this opinion to the Convention, even though
it is the Protocol that applies here.

20 "One of the considerations stated in the Preamble to the Convention

is that the United Nations has `endeavored to assure refugees the widest
possible exercise of . . . fundamental rights and freedoms.' The government's offered reading of Article 33.1, however, would narrow the exercise
of those freedoms, since refugees in transit, but not present in a sovereign
area, could freely be returned to their persecutors. This would hardly
provide refugees with `the widest possible exercise' of fundamental human
rights, and would indeed render Article 33.1 `a cruel hoax.' " 969 F. 2d,

Both parties argue that the plain language of $ 243(h)(1) isdispositive. It reads as follows:

"The Attorney General shall not deport or returnany alien (other than an alien described in section
1251(a)(4)(D) of this title) to a country if the AttorneyGeneral determines that such alien's life or freedom
would be threatened in such country on account of race,religion, nationality, membership in a particular social
group, or political opinion." 8 U. S. C. $ 1253(h)(1) (1988ed., Supp. IV).

Respondents emphasize the words "any alien" and "return";neither term is limited to aliens within the United States.
Respondents also contend that the 1980 amendment deletingthe words "within the United States" from the prior text
of $ 243(h), see n. 2, supra, obviously gave the statute an

Walker dissented, noting that the 1980 amendment eliminating the phrase
"within the United States" evidenced only an intent to extend the coverage of $ 243(h) to exclusion proceedings because the Court had previously
interpreted those words as limiting the section's coverage to deportation
proceedings, id., at 1375-1377. See Leng May Ma v. Barber, 357 U. S. 185,

extraterritorial effect. This change, they further argue,was required in order to conform the statute to the text of

Article 33.1 of the Convention, which they find as unambigu-ous as the present statutory text.

Petitioners' response is that a fair reading of the INA asa whole demonstrates that $ 243(h) does not apply to actions
taken by the President or Coast Guard outside the UnitedStates; that the legislative history of the 1980 amendment
supports their reading; and that both the text and the negoti-ating history of Article 33 of the Convention indicate that it
was not intended to have any extraterritorial effect.We shall first review the text and structure of the statute
and its 1980 amendment, and then consider the text and ne-gotiating history of the Convention.

A. The Text and Structure of the INA

Although $ 243(h)(1) refers only to the Attorney General,the Court of Appeals found it "difficult to believe that the

proscription of $ 243(h)(1)--returning an alien to his persecu-tors--was forbidden if done by the attorney general but permitted if done by some other arm of the executive branch."969 F. 2d, at 1360. Congress "understood" that the Attorney General is the "President's agent for dealing with immi-gration matters," and would intend any reference to her to
restrict similar actions of any Government official. Ibid.As evidence of this understanding, the court cited 8 U. S. C.

$ 1103(a). That section, however, conveys to us a differentmessage. It provides, in part:

"The Attorney General shall be charged with the ad-ministration and enforcement of this chapter and all
other laws relating to the immigration and naturaliza-tion of aliens, except insofar as this chapter or such
laws relate to the powers, functions, and duties con-ferred upon the President, the Secretary of State, the
officers of the Department of State, or diplomatic orconsular officers . . . ." (Emphasis added.)

172 SALE v. HAITIAN CENTERS COUNCIL, INC.

Opinion of the Court
Other provisions of the Act expressly confer certain responsibilities on the Secretary of State,24 the President,25
and, indeed, on certain other officers as well.26 The 1981 and
1992 Executive Orders expressly relied on statutory provisions that confer authority on the President to suspend the
entry of "any class of aliens" or to "impose on the entry of
aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate." 27
We cannot say that the interdiction program created by the
President, which the Coast Guard was ordered to enforce,
usurped authority that Congress had delegated to, or implicated responsibilities that it had imposed on, the Attorney
General alone.28

24 See 8 U. S. C. $$ 1104, 1105, 1153, 1201, and 1202 (1988 ed. and Supp.
IV).

25 See 8 U. S. C. $$ 1157(a), (b), and (d); $ 1182(f); $$ 1185(a) and (b); and

$ 1324a(d) (1988 ed. and Supp. IV).

26 See $$ 1161(a), (b), and (c) (Secretaries of Agriculture and Labor);

$ 1188 (Secretary of Labor); $ 1421 (federal courts).

27 Title 8 U. S. C. $ 1182(f) provides: "Whenever the President finds that

the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States
would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by
proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the
entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrant or nonimmigrants,
or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be
appropriate."

28 It is true that Executive Order No. 12807, 57 Fed. Reg. 23133, 23134

(1992), grants the Attorney General certain authority under the interdiction program ("The Secretary of the Department in which the Coast Guard
is operating, in consultation, where appropriate, with the . . . Attorney
General . . . shall issue appropriate instructions to the Coast Guard," and
"the Attorney General, in his unreviewable discretion, may decide that a
person who is a refugee will not be returned without his consent"). Under
the first phrase, however, any authority the Attorney General retains is
subsidiary to that of the Coast Guard's leaders, who give the appropriate
commands, and of the Coast Guard itself, which carries them out. As for
the second phrase, under neither President Bush nor President Clinton
has the Attorney General chosen to exercise those discretionary powers.
Even if she had, she would have been carrying out an executive, rather
than a legislative, command, and therefore would not necessarily have

Opinion of the Court
The reference to the Attorney General in the statutorytext is significant not only because that term cannot reasonably be construed to describe either the President or theCoast Guard, but also because it suggests that it applies only
to the Attorney General's normal responsibilities under theINA. The most relevant of those responsibilities for our
purposes are her conduct of the deportation and exclusionhearings in which requests for asylum or for withholding of
deportation under $ 243(h) are ordinarily advanced. Sincethere is no provision in the statute for the conduct of such
proceedings outside the United States, and since Part V andother provisions of the INA

29 obviously contemplate that

such proceedings would be held in the country, we cannotreasonably construe $ 243(h) to limit the Attorney General's

actions in geographic areas where she has not been author-ized to conduct such proceedings. Part V of the INA contains no reference to a possible extraterritorial application.Even if Part V of the Act were not limited to strictly domestic procedures, the presumption that Acts of Congress donot ordinarily apply outside our borders would support an
interpretation of $ 243(h) as applying only within UnitedStates territory. See, e. g., EEOC v. Arabian American Oil
Co., 499 U. S. 244, 248 (1991) (citing Foley Bros., Inc. v. Filardo, 336 U. S. 281, 285 (1949)); Lujan v. Defenders of Wild-life, 504 U. S. 555, 585-589, and n. 4 (1992) (

Stevens, J.,concurring in judgment); see also
Argentine Republic v.Amerada Hess Shipping Corp., 488 U. S. 428, 440 (1989)

("When it desires to do so, Congress knows how to place thehigh seas within the jurisdictional reach of a statute"). The
Court of Appeals held that the presumption against extrater-ritoriality had "no relevance in the present context" because
there was no risk that $ 243(h), which can be enforced only
been bound by $ 243(h)(1). Respondents challenge a program of interdiction and repatriation established by the President and enforced by the
Coast Guard.

in United States courts against the United States AttorneyGeneral, would conflict with the laws of other nations. 969

F. 2d, at 1358. We have recently held, however, that thepresumption has a foundation broader than the desire to
avoid conflict with the laws of other nations. Smith v.
United States, 507 U. S. 197, 206-207, n. 5 (1993).Respondents' expansive interpretation of the word "return" raises another problem: It would make the word "de-port" redundant. If "return" referred solely to the destination to which the alien is to be removed, it alone would havebeen sufficient to encompass aliens involved in both deportation and exclusion proceedings. And if Congress had meantto refer to all aliens who might be sent back to potential
oppressors, regardless of their location, the word "deport"
would have been unnecessary. By using both words, thestatute implies an exclusively territorial application, in the

context of both kinds of domestic immigration proceedings.The use of both words reflects the traditional division between the two kinds of aliens and the two kinds of hearings.We can reasonably conclude that Congress used the two
words "deport" and "return" only to make $ 243(h)'s protection available in both deportation and exclusion proceedings.
Indeed, the history of the 1980 amendment confirms that
conclusion.

B. The History of the Refugee Act of 1980

As enacted in 1952, $ 243(h) authorized the Attorney General to withhold deportation of aliens "within the United
States." 30 Six years later we considered the question
whether it applied to an alien who had been paroled into the
country while her admissibility was being determined. We
held that even though she was physically present within our
borders, she was not "within the United States" as those
words were used in $ 243(h). Leng May Ma v. Barber, 357

Opinion of the Court
U. S. 185, 186 (1958).31 We explained the important distinc-tion between "deportation" or "expulsion," on the one hand,

and "exclusion," on the other:

"It is important to note at the outset that our immi-gration laws have long made a distinction between those

aliens who have come to our shores seeking admission,such as petitioner, and those who are within the United
States after an entry, irrespective of its legality. In thelatter instance the Court has recognized additional
rights and privileges not extended to those in the formercategory who are merely `on the threshold of initial
entry.' Shaughnessy v. United States ex rel. Mezei, 345U. S. 206, 212 (1953). See Kwong Hai Chew v. Colding,
344 U. S. 590, 596 (1953). The distinction was carefullypreserved in Title II of the Immigration and Nationality
Act." Id., at 187.
Under the INA, both then and now, those seeking "admis-sion" and trying to avoid "exclusion" were already within

our territory (or at its border), but the law treated them asthough they had never entered the United States at all; they
were within United States territory but not "within theUnited States." Those who had been admitted (or found
their way in) but sought to avoid "expulsion" had the addedbenefit of "deportation proceedings"; they were both within
United States territory and "within the United States."Ibid. Although the phrase "within the United States" presumed the alien's actual presence in the United States, it hadmore to do with an alien's legal status than with his location.

The 1980 amendment erased the long-maintained distinc-tion between deportable and excludable aliens for purposes
of $ 243(h). By adding the word "return" and removing thewords "within the United States" from $ 243(h), Congress ex31 "We conclude that petitioner's parole did not alter her status as an
excluded alien or otherwise bring her `within the United States' in the
meaning of $ 243(h)." 357 U. S., at 186.

176 SALE v. HAITIAN CENTERS COUNCIL, INC.

Opinion of the Court
tended the statute's protection to both types of aliens, but itdid nothing to change the presumption that both types of

aliens would continue to be found only within United Statesterritory. The removal of the phrase "within the United
States" cured the most obvious drawback of $ 243(h): As in-terpreted in

Leng May Ma, its protection was available onlyto aliens subject to deportation proceedings.

Of course, in addition to this most obvious purpose, it ispossible that the 1980 amendment also removed any territorial limitation of the statute, and Congress might haveintended a double-barreled result.

32 That possibility, however, is not a substitute for the affirmative evidence of in-tended extraterritorial application that our cases require.

Moreover, in our review of the history of the amendment, wehave found no support whatsoever for that latter, alternative, purpose.

The addition of the phrase "or return" and the deletion ofthe phrase "within the United States" are the only relevant

changes made by the 1980 amendment to $ 243(h)(1), andthey are fully explained by the intent to apply $ 243(h) to
exclusion as well as to deportation proceedings. That intentis plainly identified in the legislative history of the amendment.33 There is no change in the 1980 amendment, how-ever, that could only be explained by an assumption that
Congress also intended to provide for the statute's extrater-ritorial application. It would have been extraordinary for
Congress to make such an important change in the law with-out any mention of that possible effect. Not a scintilla of
evidence of such an intent can be found in the legislative
history.

32 Even respondents acknowledge that $ 243(h) did not apply extraterritorially before its amendment. See Brief for Respondents 9, 12.

33 See H. R. Rep. No. 96-608, p. 30 (1979) (the changes "require . . . the

Attorney General to withhold deportation of aliens who qualify as refugees and who are in exclusion as well as deportation, proceedings"); see
also S. Rep. No. 96-256, p. 17 (1979).

Opinion of the Court
In sum, all available evidence about the meaning of$ 243(h)--the Government official at whom it is directed, its

location in the Act, its failure to suggest any extraterritorialapplication, the 1980 amendment that gave it a dual reference to "deport or return," and the relevance of that dualstructure to immigration law in general--leads unerringly to
the conclusion that it applies in only one context: the domes-tic procedures by which the Attorney General determines
whether deportable and excludable aliens may remain in theUnited States.

IV
Although the protection afforded by $ 243(h) did not applyin exclusion proceedings before 1980, other provisions of the

Act did authorize relief for aliens at the border seeking pro-tection as refugees in the United States. See

INS v. Stevic,467 U. S., at 415-416. When the United States acceded to

the Protocol in 1968, therefore, the INA already offeredsome protection to both classes of refugees. It offered no
such protection to any alien who was beyond the territorialwaters of the United States, though, and we would not expect the Government to assume a burden as to those alienswithout some acknowledgment of its dramatically broadened
scope. Both Congress and the Executive Branch gave ex-tensive consideration to the Protocol before ratifying it in
1968; in all of their published consideration of it there ap-pears no mention of the possibility that the United States
was assuming any extraterritorial obligations.34 Neverthe34 "The President and the Senate believed that the Protocol was largely
consistent with existing law. There are many statements to that effect
in the legislative history of the accession to the Protocol. E. g., S. Exec.
Rep. No. 14, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 4 (1968) (`refugees in the United States
have long enjoyed the protection and the rights which the protocol calls
for'); id., at 6, 7 (`the United States already meets the standards of the
Protocol'); see also, id., at 2; S. Exec. K, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., III, VII
(1968); 114 Cong. Rec. 29391 (1968) (remarks of Sen. Mansfield); id., at

Protocol would not `requir[e] the United States to admit new categories or

Opinion of the Court
less, because the history of the 1980 Act does disclose a gen-eral intent to conform our law to Article 33 of the Convention, it might be argued that the extraterritorial obligationsimposed by Article 33 were so clear that Congress, in acceding to the Protocol, and then in amending the statute to har-monize the two, meant to give the latter a correspondingly
extraterritorial effect. Or, just as the statute might haveimposed an extraterritorial obligation that the Convention
does not (the argument we have just rejected), the Conven-tion might have established an extraterritorial obligation
which the statute does not; under the Supremacy Clause,that broader treaty obligation might then provide the controlling rule of law.35 With those possibilities in mind weshall consider both the text and negotiating history of the
Convention itself.Like the text and the history of $ 243(h), the text and negotiating history of Article 33 of the United Nations Conven-tion are both completely silent with respect to the Article's
possible application to actions taken by a country outside itsown borders. Respondents argue that the Protocol's broad
remedial goals require that a nation be prevented from repa-triating refugees to their potential oppressors whether or
not the refugees are within that nation's borders. In spite
numbers of aliens.' S. Exec. Rep. No. 14, supra, at 19. It was also believed that apparent differences between the Protocol and existing statutory law could be reconciled by the Attorney General in administration
and did not require any modification of statutory language. See, e. g.,
S. Exec. K, supra, at VIII." INS v. Stevic, 467 U. S., at 417-418.

Opinion of the Court
of the moral weight of that argument, both the text and ne-gotiating history of Article 33 affirmatively indicate that it

was not intended to have extraterritorial effect.
A. The Text of the Convention

Two aspects of Article 33's text are persuasive. The first
is the explicit reference in Article 33.2 to the country in
which the alien is located; the second is the parallel use ofthe terms "expel or return," the latter term explained by the

French word "refouler."The full text of Article 33 reads as follows:

"Article 33.--Prohibition of Expulsion or Return

(`refoulement')
"1. No Contracting State shall expel or return (`refouler') a refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would bethreatened on account of his race, religion, nationality,

membership of a particular social group or politicalopinion.

"2. The benefit of the present provision may not, however, be claimed by a refugee whom there are reasonablegrounds for regarding as a danger to the security of

the
country in which he is, or who, having been convictedby a final judgment of a particularly serious crime,

constitutes a danger to the community of that country."Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees,
July 28, 1951, 19 U. S. T. 6259, 6276, T. I. A. S. No. 6577(emphasis added).

Under the second paragraph of Article 33 an alien may notclaim the benefit of the first paragraph if he poses a danger
to the country in which he is located. If the first paragraphdid apply on the high seas, no nation could invoke the second
paragraph's exception with respect to an alien there: An
alien intercepted on the high seas is in no country at all. If
Article 33.1 applied extraterritorially, therefore, Article 33.2

509us1u103 05-04-97 17:10:21 PAGES OPINPGT
180 SALE v. HAITIAN CENTERS COUNCIL, INC.

Opinion of the Court
would create an absurd anomaly: Dangerous aliens on the
high seas would be entitled to the benefits of 33.1 while those
residing in the country that sought to expel them would not.
It is more reasonable to assume that the coverage of 33.2
was limited to those already in the country because it was
understood that 33.1 obligated the signatory state only with
respect to aliens within its territory.36

Article 33.1 uses the words "expel or return (`refouler')"
as an obvious parallel to the words "deport or return" in

$ 243(h)(1). There is no dispute that "expel" has the same
meaning as "deport"; it refers to the deportation or expulsion
of an alien who is already present in the host country. The
dual reference identified and explained in our opinion in Leng
May Ma v. Barber suggests that the term "return (`refouler')" refers to the exclusion of aliens who are merely " `on
the threshold of initial entry.' " 357 U. S., at 187 (quoting
Shaughnessy v. United States ex rel. Mezei, 345 U. S. 206,
212 (1953)).

This suggestion--that "return" has a legal meaning narrower than its common meaning--is reinforced by the parenthetical reference to "refouler," a French word that is not
an exact synonym for the English word "return." Indeed,
neither of two respected English-French dictionaries mentions "refouler" as one of many possible French translations

36 Although the parallel provision in $ 243(h)(2)(D), 8 U. S. C. $ 243(h)
(2)(D), that was added to the INA in 1980 does not contain the "country
in which he is" language, the general understanding that it was intended
to conform the statute to the Protocol leads us to give it that reading,
particularly since its text is otherwise so similar to Article 33.2. It provides that $ 243(h)(1) "shall not apply" to an alien if the Attorney General
determines that "there are reasonable grounds for regarding the alien as
a danger to the security of the United States." Thus the statutory term
"security of the United States" replaces the Protocol's term "security of
the country in which he is." The parallel surely implies that for statutory
purposes "the United States" is "the country in which he is."

translations imply that "return" means a defensive act of re-sistance or exclusion at a border rather than an act of transporting someone to a particular destination. In the contextof the Convention, to "return" means to "repulse" rather
than to "reinstate." 39The text of Article 33 thus fits with Judge Edwards' understanding that " `expulsion' would refer to a `refugee alreadyadmitted into a country' and that `return' would refer to a
`refugee already within the territory but not yet residentthere.' Thus, the Protocol was not intended to govern parties' conduct outside of their national borders." Haitian
Refugee Center v. Gracey, 257 U. S. App. D. C., at 413, 809F. 2d, at 840 (footnotes omitted). From the time of the Convention, commentators have consistently agreed with thisview.

39 Under Article 33, after all, a nation is not prevented from sending a
threatened refugee back only to his homeland, or even to the country that
he has most recently departed; in some cases Article 33 would even prevent a nation from sending a refugee to a country where he had never
been. Because the word "return," in its common meaning, would make
no sense in that situation (one cannot return, or be returned, to a place
one has never been), we think it means something closer to "exclude" than
"send back."

40 See, e. g., N. Robinson, Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees:

Its History, Contents and Interpretation 162-163 (1953) ("The Study on
Statelessness[, U. N. Dept. of Social Affairs 60 (1949),] defined `expulsion'
as `the juridical decision taken by the judicial or administrative authorities
whereby an individual is ordered to leave the territory of the country' and
`reconduction' (which is the equivalent of `refoulement' and was changed
by the Ad Hoc Committee to the word `return') as `the mere physical act
of ejecting from the national territory a person residing therein who has
gained entry or is residing regularly or irregularly.' . . . Art. 33 concerns
refugees who have gained entry into the territory of a Contracting State,
legally or illegally, but not to refugees who seek entrance into [the] territory"); 2 A. Grahl-Madsen, The Status of Refugees in International Law

Opinion of the Court
The drafters of the Convention and the parties to the Pro-tocol--like the drafters of $ 243(h)--may not have contemplated that any nation would gather fleeing refugees and re-turn them to the one country they had desperately sought to
escape; such actions may even violate the spirit of Article 33;but a treaty cannot impose uncontemplated extraterritorial
obligations on those who ratify it through no more than itsgeneral humanitarian intent. Because the text of Article 33

not prohibit such actions.41
cution; it does not obligate the Contracting State to admit any person who
has not already set foot on their respective territories"). A more recent
work describes the evolution of non-refoulement into the international
(and possibly extraterritorial) duty of nonreturn relied on by respondents,
but it also admits that in 1951 non-refoulement had a narrower meaning,
and did not encompass extraterritorial obligations. Moreover, it describes both "expel" and "return" as terms referring to one nation's transportation of an alien out of its own territory and into another. See G.
Goodwin-Gill, The Refugee in International Law 74-76 (1983).

Even the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has implicitly acknowledged that the Convention has no extraterritorial application.
While conceding that the Convention does not mandate any specific procedure by which to determine whether an alien qualifies as a refugee, the
"basic requirements" his office has established impose an exclusively territorial burden, and announce that any alien protected by the Convention
(and by its promise of non-refoulement) will be found either " `at the border or in the territory of a Contracting State.' " Office of United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees, Handbook on Procedures and Criteria
for Determining Refugee Status 46 (Geneva, Sept. 1979) (quoting Official
Records of the General Assembly, Thirty-second Session, Supplement No.
12 (A/32/12/Add.1), paragraph 53(6)(e)). Those basic requirements also establish the right of an applicant for refugee status " `to remain in the country pending a decision on his initial request.' " Handbook on Refugee Status, at 460 (emphasis added).

of aliens has been generally acknowledged (and regretted). See Aga

B. The Negotiating History of the Convention

In early drafts of the Convention, what finally emerged asArticle 33 was numbered 28. At a negotiating conference of

plenipotentiaries held in Geneva, Switzerland, on July 11,1951, the Swiss delegate explained his understanding that
the words "expel" and "return" covered only refugees whohad entered the host country. He stated:

"Mr. ZUTTER (Switzerland) said that the Swiss Fed-eral Government saw no reason why article 28 should
not be adopted as it stood; for the article was a neces-sary one. He thought, however, that its wording left
room for various interpretations, particularly as to themeaning to be attached to the words `expel' and `return'.
In the Swiss Government's view, the term "expulsion"applied to a refugee who had already been admitted to
the territory of a country. The term `refoulement', onthe other hand, had a vaguer meaning;

it could not, how-ever, be applied to a refugee who had not yet entered the

territory of a country. The word `return', used in theEnglish text, gave that idea exactly. Yet article 28 implied the existence of two categories of refugee: refugeeswho were liable to be expelled, and those who were liable to be returned. In any case, the States representedat the Conference should take a definite position with
regard to the meaning to be attached to the word `re-turn'. The Swiss Government considered that in the

territory of the Contracting State? . . . There is thus a serious gap in
refugee law as established by the 1951 Convention and other related instruments and it is high time that this gap should be filled"); Robinson,
Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, at 163 ("[I]f a refugee has
succeeded in eluding the frontier guards, he is safe; if he has not, it is his
hard luck. It cannot be said that this is a satisfactory solution of the
problem of asylum"); Goodwin-Gill, The Refugee in International Law, at
87 ("A categorical refusal of disembarkation cannot be equated with breach
of the principle of non-refoulement, even though it may result in serious
consequences for asylum-seekers").

Opinion of the Court
present instance the word applied solely to refugees whohad already entered a country, but were not yet resident

there. According to that interpretation, States werenot compelled to allow large groups of persons claiming
refugee status to cross its frontiers. He would be gladto know whether the States represented at the Conference accepted his interpretations of the two terms inquestion. If they did, Switzerland would be willing to
accept article 28, which was one of the articles in respectof which States could not, under article 36 of the draft
Convention, enter a reservation." (Emphases added.) 42
No one expressed disagreement with the position of theSwiss delegate on that day or at the session two weeks later

when Article 28 was again discussed. At that session, thedelegate of the Netherlands recalled the Swiss delegate's
earlier position:

"Baron van BOETZELAER (Netherlands) recalledthat at the first reading the Swiss representative had

expressed the opinion that the word `expulsion' relatedto a refugee already admitted into a country, whereas
the word `return' (`refoulement') related to a refugee
already within the territory but not yet resident there.According to that interpretation, article 28 would not

have involved any obligations in the possible case ofmass migrations across frontiers or of attempted mass
migrations."He wished to revert to that point, because the Netherlands Government attached very great importance tothe scope of the provision now contained in article 33.
The Netherlands could not accept any legal obligationsin respect of large groups of refugees seeking access to
its territory.

Opinion of the Court
"At the first reading the representatives of Belgium,
the Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, the Netherlands
and Sweden had supported the Swiss interpretation.
From conversations he had since had with other representatives, he had gathered that the general consensus
of opinion was in favour of the Swiss interpretation.

"In order to dispel any possible ambiguity and to reassure his Government, he wished to have it placed on
record that the Conference was in agreement with the
interpretation that the possibility of mass migrations
across frontiers or of attempted mass migrations was
not covered by article 33.

"There being no objection, the PRESIDENT ruled
that the interpretation given by the Netherlands representative should be placed on record.

"Mr. HOARE (United Kingdom) remarked that the
Style Committee had considered that the word `return'
was the nearest equivalent in English to the French
term `refoulement'. He assumed that the word `return'
as used in the English text had no wider meaning.

"The PRESIDENT suggested that in accordance with
the practice followed in previous Conventions, the
French word `refoulement' (`refouler' in verbal uses)

should be included in brackets and between inverted
commas after the English word `return' wherever the
latter occurred in the text." (Emphasis added.) 43

Although the significance of the President's comment that
the remarks should be "placed on record" is not entirely
clear, this much cannot be denied: At one time there was
a "general consensus," and in July 1951 several delegates
understood the right of non-refoulement to apply only to

aliens physically present in the host country.44 There is norecord of any later disagreement with that position. Moreover, the term "refouler" was included in the English ver-sion of the text to avoid the expressed concern about an inappropriately broad reading of the English word "return."Therefore, even if we believed that Executive Order No.
12807 violated the intent of some signatory states to protectall aliens, wherever they might be found, from being transported to potential oppressors, we must acknowledge thatother signatory states carefully--and successfully--sought
to avoid just that implication. The negotiating history,which suggests that the Convention's limited reach resulted
from a deliberate bargain, is not dispositive, but it solidlysupports our reluctance to interpret Article 33 to impose obligations on the contracting parties that are broader than thetext commands. We do not read that text to apply to aliens

otherwise face a long and dangerous return voyage is irrele-vant to the scope of his authority to take action that neither
the Convention nor the statute clearly prohibits. As wehave already noted, Acts of Congress normally do not have
extraterritorial application unless such an intent is clearlymanifested. That presumption has special force when we
are construing treaty and statutory provisions that may in-volve foreign and military affairs for which the President has
unique responsibility. Cf. United States v. Curtiss-Wright
Export Corp., 299 U. S. 304 (1936). We therefore find our-selves in agreement with the conclusion expressed in Judge

Edwards' concurring opinion in Gracey, 257 U. S. App. D. C.,at 414, 809 F. 2d, at 841:

"This case presents a painfully common situation inwhich desperate people, convinced that they can no
longer remain in their homeland, take desperate meas-ures to escape. Although the human crisis is compelling, there is no solution to be found in a judicialremedy."

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.

the opposite of "within the United States" is not outside theUnited States, ante, at 175, and because the official charged

ante, at 171-173.I believe that the duty of nonreturn expressed in both the

Protocol and the statute is clear. The majority finds it "ex-traordinary," ante, at 176, that Congress would have intended the ban on returning "any alien" to apply to aliens atsea. That Congress would have meant what it said is not
remarkable. What is extraordinary in this case is that theExecutive, in disregard of the law, would take to the seas
to intercept fleeing refugees and force them back to theirpersecutors--and that the Court would strain to sanction
that conduct. I

I begin with the Convention,1 for it is undisputed that theRefugee Act of 1980 was passed to conform our law to Article
33, and that "the nondiscretionary duty imposed by $ 243(h)parallels the United States' mandatory

nonrefoulement obli-gations under Article 33.1 . . . ." INS v. Doherty, 502 U. S.

Article 33.1 of the Convention states categorically andwithout geographical limitation:

"No Contracting State shall expel or return (`refouler')a refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of
territories where his life or freedom would be threat-ened on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion."
The terms are unambiguous. Vulnerable refugees shallnot be returned. The language is clear, and the command is

straightforward; that should be the end of the inquiry. In-deed, until litigation ensued, see Haitian Refugee Center v.
Gracey, 257 U. S. App. D. C. 367, 809 F. 2d 794 (1987), theGovernment consistently acknowledged that the Convention

of the term "return (`refouler')." "Return," it claims, doesnot mean return, but instead has a distinctive legal meaning.

standing that the obligations imposed by treaty and the statute are
coextensive, I do not find it necessary to rely on the Protocol standing
alone. As the majority suggests, however, ante, at 178, to the extent that
the treaty is more generous than the statute, the latter should not be read
to limit the former.

Ante, at 180. For this proposition the Court relies almost
entirely on the fact that American law makes a general distinction between deportation and exclusion. Without explanation, the majority asserts that in light of this distinction
the word "return" as used in the treaty somehow must refer
only to "the exclusion of aliens who are . . . `on the threshold
of initial entry.' " Ibid. (citation omitted).

Setting aside for the moment the fact that respondents in
this case seem very much "on the threshold of initial
entry"--at least in the eyes of the Government that has ordered them seized for "attempting to come to the United
States by sea without necessary documentation," Preamble
to Exec. Order No. 12807, 57 Fed. Reg. 23133 (1992)--I find
this tortured reading unsupported and unnecessary. The
text of the Convention does not ban the "exclusion" of aliens
who have reached some indeterminate "threshold"; it bans
their "return." It is well settled that a treaty must first be
construed according to its "ordinary meaning." Article 31.1
of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, 1155
U. N. T. S. 331, T. S. No. 58 (1980), 8 I. L. M. 679 (1969). The
ordinary meaning of "return" is "to bring, send, or put (a
person or thing) back to or in a former position." Webster's
Third New International Dictionary 1941 (1986). That describes precisely what petitioners are doing to the Haitians.
By dispensing with ordinary meaning at the outset, and by
taking instead as its starting point the assumption that "return," as used in the treaty, "has a legal meaning narrower
than its common meaning," ante, at 180, the majority leads
itself astray.

The straightforward interpretation of the duty of nonreturn is strongly reinforced by the Convention's use of the
French term "refouler." The ordinary meaning of "refouler," as the majority concedes, ante, at 181-182, is "[t]o repulse, . . . ; to drive back, to repel." Larousse Modern French509us1u103 05-04-97 17:10:22 PAGES OPINPGT

English Dictionary 631 (1981).4 Thus construed, Article
33.1 of the Convention reads: "No contracting state shall
expel or [repulse, drive back, or repel] a refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life
or freedom would be threatened . . . ." That, of course, is
exactly what the Government is doing. It thus is no surprise that when the French press has described the very
policy challenged here, the term it has used is "refouler."
See, e. g., Le bourbier hai"tien, Le Monde, May 31-June 1,
1992 ("[L]es Etats-Unis ont de' cide' de refouler directement
les re' fugie' s recueillis par la garde cotie` re' ." (The United

States has decided [de refouler] directly the refugees picked
up by the Coast Guard)).

And yet the majority insists that what has occurred is not,
in fact, "refoulement." It reaches this conclusion in a peculiar fashion. After acknowledging that the ordinary meaning of "refouler" is "repulse," "repel," and "drive back," the
majority without elaboration declares: "To the extent that
they are relevant, these translations imply that `return'
means a defensive act of resistance or exclusion at a
border . . . ." Ante, at 181-182. I am at a loss to find the
narrow notion of "exclusion at a border" in broad terms like
"repulse," "repel," and "drive back." Gage was repulsed
(initially) at Bunker Hill. Lee was repelled at Gettysburg.
Rommel was driven back across North Africa. The majority's puzzling progression ("refouler" means repel or drive
back; therefore "return" means only exclude at a border;
therefore the treaty does not apply) hardly justifies a departure from the path of ordinary meaning. The text of Article

4 The Court seems no more convinced than I am by petitioners' argument that "refouler" is best translated as "expel." See Brief for Petitioners 38-39. That interpretation, as the Second Circuit observed, would
leave the treaty redundantly forbidding a nation to "expel" or "expel" a
refugee. Haitian Centers Council, Inc. v. McNary, 969 F. 2d 1350, 1363

33.1 is clear, and whether the operative term is "return" or"refouler," it prohibits the Government's actions.

Article 33.1 is clear not only in what it says, but also inwhat it does not say: It does not include any geographical

limitation. It limits only where a refugee may be sent "to,"not where he may be sent from. This is not surprising,
given that the aim of the provision is to protect refugeesagainst persecution.

Article 33.2, by contrast, does contain a geographical refer-ence, and the majority seizes upon this as evidence that the
section as a whole applies only within a signatory's borders.That inference is flawed. Article 33.2 states that the benefit

"may not . . . be claimed by a refugee whom there arereasonable grounds for regarding as a danger to the security of the country in which he is, or who, having beenconvicted by a final judgment of a particularly serious
crime, constitutes a danger to the community of thatcountry."

The signatories' understandable decision to allow nations todeport criminal aliens who have entered their territory
hardly suggests an intent to permit the apprehension andreturn of noncriminal aliens who have not entered their territory, and who may have no desire ever to enter it. Onewonders what the majority would make of an exception that

5 I am surprised by the majority's apparent belief that (a) the translations of "refouler" are of uncertain relevance ("To the extent that they
are relevant, these translations imply . . ."), and (b) the term "refouler" is
pertinent only as an aid to understanding the meaning of the English word
"return" ("these translations imply that `return' means . . ."). Ante, at
181-182. The first assumption suggests disregard for the basic rule that
consideration of a treaty's ordinary meaning must be the first step in its
interpretation. The second assumption, by neglecting to treat the term
"refouler" as significant in and of itself, overlooks the fact that under
Article 46 the French and English versions of the Convention's text are
equally authoritative.

removed from the Article's protection all refugees who "con-stitute a danger to their families." By the majority's logic,

the inclusion of such an exception presumably would renderArticle 33.1 applicable only to refugees with families.

Far from constituting "an absurd anomaly," ante, at 180,the fact that a state is permitted to "expel or return" a small
class of refugees found within its territory but may not seizeand return refugees who remain outside its frontiers expresses precisely the objectives and concerns of the Conven-tion. Nonreturn is the rule; the sole exception (neither applicable nor invoked here) is that a nation endangered by arefugee's very presence may "expel or return" him to an unsafe country if it chooses. The tautological observation thatonly a refugee already in a country can pose a danger to the
country "in which he is" proves nothing.

The majority further relies on a remark by Baron vanBoetzelaer, the Netherlands' delegate at the Convention's

negotiating conference, to support its contention that Ar-ticle 33 does not apply extraterritorially. This reliance, for

two reasons, is misplaced. First, the isolated statement of adelegate to the Convention cannot alter the plain meaning
of the treaty itself. Second, placed in its proper context,Van Boetzelaer's comment does not support the majority's
position.It is axiomatic that a treaty's plain language must control

The pitfalls of relying on the negotiating record are underscored by the fact that Baron van Boetzelaer's remarks almost certainly represent, in the words of the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees, a mere "parliamentary
gesture by a delegate whose views did not prevail upon the
negotiating conference as a whole" (emphasis in original).
Brief for Office of United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees as Amicus Curiae 24. The Baron, like the Swiss
delegate whose sentiments he restated, expressed a desire
to reserve the right to close borders to large groups of refugees. "According to [the Swiss delegate's] interpretation,
States were not compelled to allow large groups of persons
claiming refugee status to cross [their] frontiers." Conference of Plenipotentiaries on the Status of Refugees and
Stateless Persons, Summary Record of the Sixteenth Meeting, U. N. Doc. A/CONF.2/SR.16, p. 6 (July 11, 1951). Article 33, Van Boetzelaer maintained, "would not have involved
any obligations in the possible case of mass migrations across
frontiers or of attempted mass migrations" and this was important because "[t]he Netherlands could not accept any
legal obligations in respect of large groups of refugees seeking access to its territory." Conference of Plenipotentiaries

Yet no one seriously contends that the treaty's protections
depend on the number of refugees who are fleeing persecution. Allowing a state to disavow "any obligations" in the
case of mass migrations or attempted mass migrations would
eviscerate Article 33, leaving it applicable only to "small"
migrations and "small" attempted migrations.

There is strong evidence as well that the Conference rejected the right to close land borders where to do so would
trap refugees in the persecutors' territory.6 Indeed, the
majority agrees that the Convention does apply to refugees
who have reached the border. Ante, at 181-182. The majority thus cannot maintain that Van Boetzelaer's interpretation prevailed.

6 In proceedings prior to that at which Van Boetzelaer made his remarks, the Ad Hoc Committee delegates from France, Belgium, and the
United Kingdom had made clear that the principle of non-refoulement,
which existed only in France and Belgium, did proscribe the rejection of
refugees at a country's frontier. Ad Hoc Committee on Statelessness and
Related Problems, Summary Record of the Twenty-First Meeting, U. N.
Doc. E/AC.32/SR.21, pp. 4-5 (1950). Consistent with the United States'
historically strong support of nonreturn, the United States delegate to the
Committee, Louis Henkin, confirmed this:

"Whether it was a question of closing the frontier to a refugee who
asked admittance, or of turning him back after he had crossed the frontier,
or even of expelling him after he had been admitted to residence in the
territory, the problem was more or less the same.

"Whatever the case might be . . . he must not be turned back to a
country where his life or freedom could be threatened. No consideration
of public order should be allowed to overrule that guarantee, for if the
State concerned wished to get rid of the refugee at all costs, it could send
him to another country or place him in an internment camp." Ad Hoc
Committee on Statelessness and Related Problems, Summary Record of
the Twentieth Meeting, U. N. Doc. E/AC.32/SR.20, |||| 54 and 55, pp. 11-
12 (1950).

Speaking next, the Israeli delegate to the Ad Hoc Committee concluded:
"The Committee had already settled the humanitarian question of sending
any refugee . . . back to a territory where his life or liberty might be in
danger." Id., || 61, at 13.

That it did not is evidenced by the fact that Baron vanBoetzelaer's interpretation was merely "placed on record,"

unlike formal amendments to the Convention which were"agreed to" or "adopted."

7 It should not be assumed that

other delegates agreed with the comment simply becausethey did not object to their colleague's request to memorialize it, and the majority's statement that "this much cannot bedenied: At one time there was a `general consensus,' "

ante,at 186, is wrong. All that can be said is that at one time

Baron van Boetzelaer remarked that "he had gathered" thatthere was a general consensus, and that his interpretation
was placed on record.In any event, even if Van Boetzelaer's statement

had been"agreed to" as reflecting the dominant view, this is not a

case about the right of a nation to close its borders. This isa case in which a Nation has gone forth to seize aliens who
are not at its borders and return them to persecution. Noth-ing in the comments relied on by the majority even hints at
an intention on the part of the drafters to countenance acourse of conduct so at odds with the Convention's basic
purpose.8

7 See, e. g., A/Conf.2/SR.35, at 22 ("adopt[ing] unanimously" the proposal
to place the word "refouler" alongside the word "return"; ibid. ("adopt[ing] unanimously" the suggestion that the words "membership of a particular social group" be inserted); ibid. ("agree[ing]" to changes in the actual
wording of Article 33).

8 The majority also cites secondary sources that, it claims, share its

reading of the Convention. See ante, at 182-184, nn. 40 and 41. Not one
of these authorities suggests that any signatory nation sought to reserve
the right to seize refugees outside its territory and forcibly return them
to their persecutors. Indeed, the first work cited explains that the entire
reason for the drafting of Article 33 was "the consideration that the
turning back of a refugee to the frontiers of a country where his life or
freedom is threatened on account of race or similar grounds would be
tantamount to delivering him into the hands of his persecutors." N.

Like the treaty whose dictates it embodies, $ 243(h) of theImmigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (INA) is unambiguous. It reads:

"The Attorney General shall not deport or return anyalien . . . to a country if the Attorney General determines that such alien's life or freedom would be threat-ened in such country on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group,or political opinion." 8 U. S. C. $ 1253(h)(1) (1988 ed.,
Supp. IV).
"With regard to this very statutory scheme, we have consid-ered ourselves bound to assume that the legislative purpose

is expressed by the ordinary meaning of the words used."
Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U. S., at 431 (internal quotation marksomitted). Ordinary, but not literal. The statement that

"the Attorney General shall not deport or return any alien"obviously does not mean simply that the person who is the
Attorney General at the moment is forbidden personally todeport or return any alien, but rather that her agents may
not do so. In the present case the Coast Guard withoutquestion is acting as the agent of the Attorney General.
"The officers of the Coast Guard insofar as they are engaged. . . in enforcing any law of the United States shall . . . be
deemed to be acting as agents of the particular executivedepartment . . . charged with the administration of the
particular law . . . and . . . be subject to all the rules andregulations promulgated by such department . . . with respect to the enforcement of that law." 14 U. S. C. $ 89(b).The Coast Guard is engaged in enforcing the immigration
laws. The sole identified purpose of Executive Order No.12807 is to address the "serious problem of persons attempting to come to the United States by sea without necessarydocumentation and otherwise illegally." 57 Fed. Reg. 23133

(1992). The Coast Guard's task under the order is "to en-force the suspension of the entry of undocumented aliens by

sea and the interdiction of any defined vessel carrying suchaliens." Ibid. The Coast Guard is authorized to return a
vessel and its passengers only "when there is reason to be-lieve that an offense is being committed against the United
States immigration laws, or appropriate laws of a foreigncountry with which we have an arrangement to assist."

Id.,at 23134.

The majority suggests indirectly that the law which theCoast Guard enforces when it carries out the order to return
a vessel reasonably believed to be violating the immigrationlaws is somehow not a law that the Attorney General is
charged with administering. Ante, at 171-173. That sug-gestion is baseless. Under 8 U. S. C. $ 1103(a), the Attorney
General, with some exceptions, "shall be charged with theadministration and enforcement of this chapter and all other
laws relating to the immigration and naturalization ofaliens . . . ." The majority acknowledges this designation,
but speculates that the particular enforcement of immigra-tion laws here may be covered by the exception for laws
relating to " `the powers, functions, and duties conferredupon the President, the Secretary of State, the officers of the
Department of State, or diplomatic or consular officers . . . .' "Ante, at 171.

9 The majority fails to point out the proviso

9 The Executive Order at issue cited as authority 8 U. S. C. $ 1182(f),
which allows the President to restrict or "for such period as he shall deem
necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrant or nonimmigrants." The Haitians, of course, do not claim a right
of entry.

Indeed, the very invocation of this section in this context is somewhat
of a stretch. The section pertains to the President's power to interrupt
for as long as necessary legal entries into the United States. Illegal entries cannot be "suspended"--they are already disallowed. Nevertheless,
the Proclamation on which the Order relies declares, solemnly and hopefully: "The entry of undocumented aliens from the high seas is hereby

that directly follows the exception: "Provided, however, That
. . . the Attorney General . . . . shall have the power and duty
to control and guard the boundaries and borders of the
United States against the illegal entry of aliens . . . ." There
can be no doubt that the Coast Guard is acting as the Attorney General's agent when it seizes and returns undocumented aliens.

Even the challenged Executive Order places the Attorney
General "on the boat" with the Coast Guard.10 The Order
purports to give the Attorney General "unreviewable discretion" to decide that an alien will not be returned.11 Discretion not to return an alien is of course discretion to return
him. Such discretion cannot be given; Congress removed it
in 1980 when it amended the INA to make mandatory ("shall
not deport or return") what had been a discretionary function ("The Attorney General is authorized to withhold deportation"). The Attorney General may not decline to follow
the command of $ 243(h). If she encounters a refugee, she
must not return him to persecution.

The laws that the Coast Guard is engaged in enforcing
when it takes to the seas under orders to prevent aliens from
illegally crossing our borders are laws whose administration
has been assigned to the Attorney General by Congress,
which has plenary power over immigration matters. Kleindienst v. Mandel, 408 U. S. 753, 766 (1972). Accordingly,
there is no merit to the argument that the concomitant legal
restrictions placed on the Attorney General by Congress do
not apply with full force in this case.

suspended . . . ." Presidential Proclamation No. 4865, 3 CFR 50, 51 (1981-

10 Of course the Attorney General's authority is not dependent on its

recognition in the Order.

11 "[T]he Attorney General, in his unreviewable discretion, may decide

that a person who is a refugee will not be returned without his consent."

Comparison with the pre-1980 version of $ 243(h) confirms
that the statute means what it says. Before 1980, $ 243(h)
provided:

"The Attorney General is authorized to withhold deportation of any alien . . . within the United States to
any country in which in his opinion the alien would be
subject to persecution on account of race, religion, or
political opinion and for such period of time as he deems
to be necessary for such reason." 8 U. S. C. $ 1253(h)
(1976 ed., Supp. III) (emphasis added).

The Refugee Act of 1980 explicitly amended this provision
in three critical respects. Congress (1) deleted the words
"within the United States"; (2) barred the Government from
"return[ing]," as well as "deport[ing]," alien refugees; and
(3) made the prohibition against return mandatory, thereby
eliminating the discretion of the Attorney General over
such decisions.

The import of these changes is clear. Whether "within
the United States" or not, a refugee may not be returned to
his persecutors. To read into $ 243(h)'s mandate a territorial
restriction is to restore the very language that Congress removed. "Few principles of statutory construction are more
compelling than the proposition that Congress does not intend sub silentio to enact statutory language that it has earlier discarded in favor of other language." INS v. CardozaFonseca, 480 U. S., at 442-443 (citations omitted). Moreover, as all parties to this case acknowledge, the 1980
changes were made in order to conform our law to the United
Nations Protocol. As has been shown above, that treaty's
absolute ban on refoulement is similarly devoid of territorial restrictions.

The majority, however, downplays the significance of the
deletion of "within the United States" to improvise a unique

meaning for "return." 12 It does so not by analyzing Article33, the provision that inspired the 1980 amendments,

13 but

by reference to a lone case from this Court that is not evenmentioned in the legislative history and that had been on the

books a full 22 years before the amendments' enactment.In

Leng May Ma v. Barber, 357 U. S. 185 (1958), this Courtdecided that aliens paroled into the United States from detention at the border were not "within the United States"for purposes of the former $ 243(h) and thus were not entitled
to its benefits. Pointing to this decision, the majority offersthe negative inference that Congress' removal of the words
"within the United States" was meant only to extend a rightof nonreturn to those in exclusion proceedings. But nothing
in Leng May Ma even remotely suggests that the only per-sons not "within the United States" are those involved in
exclusion proceedings. Indeed, such a suggestion wouldhave been ridiculous. Nor does the narrow concept of exclusion relate in any obvious way to the amendment's broadphrase "return any alien."

The problems with the majority's Leng May Ma theoryrun deeper, however. When Congress in 1980 removed the

12 The word "return" is used throughout the INA; in no instance is there
any indication that the word has a specialized meaning. See, e. g., 8
U. S. C. $$ 1101(a)(27)(A) ("special immigrant" is one lawfully admitted
"who is returning from a temporary visit abroad" (emphasis added));

revoked and the alien "returned to custody" (emphasis added)); 1353
(travel expenses will be paid for INS officers who "become eligible for

It is axiomatic that "identical words used in different parts of the same
act are intended to have the same meaning." Atlantic Cleaners & Dyers,
Inc. v. United States, 286 U. S. 427, 433 (1932).

13 Indeed, reasoning backwards, the majority actually looks to the American scheme to illuminate the treaty. See ante, at 180-181.

phrase "within the United States," it did not substitute any
other geographical limitation. This failure is exceedingly
strange in light of the majority's hypothesis that the deletion
was intended solely to work the particular technical adjustment of extending protection to those physically present in,
yet not legally admitted to, the United States. It is even
stranger given what Congress did elsewhere in the Act.
The Refugee Act revised the immigration code to establish
a comprehensive, tripartite system for the protection of refugees fleeing persecution.14 Section 207 governs overseas
refugee processing. Section 208, in turn, governs asylum
claims by aliens "physically present in the United States, or
at a land border or port of entry." Unlike these sections,
however, which explicitly apply to persons present in specific
locations, the amended $ 243(h) includes no such limiting language. The basic prohibition against forced return to persecution applies simply to "any alien." The design of all three
sections is instructive, and it undermines the majority's assertion that $ 243(h) was meant to apply only to aliens physically present in the United States or at one of its borders.
When Congress wanted a provision to apply only to aliens
"physically present in the United States, or at a land border
or port of entry," it said so. See $ 208(a).15 An examination

14 For this reason, the majority is mistaken to find any significance in
the fact that the ban on return is located in the part of the INA that deals
as well with the deportation and exclusion hearings in which requests for
asylum or for withholding of deportation "are ordinarily advanced."
Ante, at 173.

15 Congress used the words "physically present within the United

States" to delimit the reach not just of $ 208 but of sections throughout
the INA. See, e. g., 8 U. S. C. $$ 1159 (adjustment of refugee status);
1101(a)(27)(I) (defining "special immigrant" for visa purposes); 1254(a)(1)-

of the carefully designed provisions of the INA--not an elab-orate theory about a 1958 case regarding the rights of aliens

in exclusion proceedings--is the proper basis for an analysisof the statute.

C
That the clarity of the text and the implausibility of itstheories do not give the majority more pause is due, I think,

to the majority's heavy reliance on the presumption againstextraterritoriality. The presumption runs throughout the
majority's opinion, and it stacks the deck by requiring theHaitians to produce "affirmative evidence" that when Congress prohibited the return of "any" alien, it indeed meantto prohibit the interception and return of aliens at sea.

The judicially created canon of statutory constructionagainst extraterritorial application of United States law has
no role here, however. It applies only where congressionalintent is "unexpressed."

EEOC v. Arabian American OilCo., 499 U. S. 244, 248-259 (1991); Foley Bros., Inc. v. Filardo, 336 U. S. 281, 285 (1949). Here there is no room for
porary protected status). The majority offers no hypothesis for why Congress would not have done so here as well.

16 Even if the majority's Leng May Ma proposition were correct, it would

not support today's result. Leng May Ma was an excludable alien who
had been in custody but was paroled into the United States. The Court
determined that her parole did not change her legal status, and therefore
that her case should be analyzed as if she were still "in custody." The
Court then explained that "the detention of an alien in custody pending
determination of his admissibility does not legally constitute an entry
though the alien is physically within the United States," and stated: "It
seems quite clear that an alien so confined would not be `within the United
States' for purposes of $ 243(h)." 357 U. S., at 188. Leng May Ma stands
for the proposition that aliens in custody who have not made legal entries--including, but not limited to, those who are granted the privilege of
parole--are legally outside the United States. According to the majority,
Congress deleted the territorial reference in order to extend protection to
such aliens. By the majority's own reasoning, then, $ 243(h) applies to
unadmitted aliens held in United States custody. That, of course, is exactly the position in which the interdicted Haitians find themselves.

doubt: A territorial restriction has been deliberately deletedfrom the statute.

Even where congressional intent is unexpressed, however,a statute must be assessed according to its intended scope.
The primary basis for the application of the presumption (besides the desire--not relevant here--to avoid conflict withthe laws of other nations) is "the commonsense notion that

Congress generally legislates with domestic concerns inmind."

Smith v. United States, 507 U. S. 197, 204, n. 5

subject matters are routinely applied extraterritorially.

extraterritoriality).

In this case we deal with a statute that regulates a distinctively international subject matter: immigration, nationalities, and refugees. Whatever force the presumption may
have with regard to a primarily domestic statute evaporates
in this context. There is no danger that the Congress that
enacted the Refugee Act was blind to the fact that the laws it
was crafting had implications beyond this Nation's borders.
The "commonsense notion" that Congress was looking inwards--perfectly valid in a case involving the Federal Tort
Claims Act, such as Smith,--cannot be reasonably applied to
the Refugee Act of 1980.

In this regard, the majority's dictum that the presumption
has "special force" when we construe "statutory provisions
that may involve foreign and military affairs for which the
President has unique responsibility," ante, at 188, is completely wrong. The presumption that Congress did not in509us1u103 05-04-97 17:10:22 PAGES OPINPGT

tend to legislate extraterritorially has less force--perhaps,indeed, no force at all--when a statute on its face relates to

foreign affairs. What the majority appears to be getting at,as its citation to

United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export
Corp., 299 U. S. 304 (1936), suggests, ante, at 188, is that in
some areas, the President, and not Congress, has sole consti-tutional authority. Immigration is decidedly not one of

those areas. " `[O]ver no conceivable subject is the legisla-tive power of Congress more complete . . . .' "

Fiallo v. Bell,
430 U. S. 787, 792 (1977), quoting Oceanic Steam Navigation
Co. v. Stranahan, 214 U. S. 320, 339 (1909). And the suggestion that the President somehow is acting in his capacity asCommander in Chief is thwarted by the fact that nowhere

among Executive Order No. 12807's numerous references to
the immigration laws is that authority even once invoked.17

If any canon of construction should be applied in this
case, it is the well-settled rule that "an act of congress ought
never to be construed to violate the law of nations if any
other possible construction remains." Murray v. Schooner
Charming Betsy, 2 Cranch 64, 117-118 (1804). The majority's improbable construction of $ 243(h), which flies in the
face of the international obligations imposed by Article 33 of
the Convention, violates that established principle.

III
The Convention that the Refugee Act embodies was
enacted largely in response to the experience of Jewish refugees in Europe during the period of World War II. The
tragic consequences of the world's indifference at that time
are well known. The resulting ban on refoulement, as broad
as the humanitarian purpose that inspired it, is easily appli17 Indeed, petitioners are hard pressed to argue that restraints on the
Coast Guard infringe upon the Commander in Chief's power when the President himself has placed that agency under the direct control of the Department of Transportation. See Declaration of Admiral Leahy, App. 233.

BROOKE GROUP LTD. v. BROWN &WILLIAMSON TOBACCO CORP.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fourth circuit

No. 92-466. Argued March 29, 1993--Decided June 21, 1993
Cigarette manufacturing is a concentrated industry dominated by only six

firms, including the two parties here. In 1980, petitioner (hereinafter
Liggett) pioneered the economy segment of the market by developing a
line of generic cigarettes offered at a list price roughly 30% lower than
that of branded cigarettes. By 1984, generics had captured 4% of the
market, at the expense of branded cigarettes, and respondent Brown &
Williamson entered the economy segment, beating Liggett's net price.
Liggett responded in kind, precipitating a price war, which ended, according to Liggett, with Brown & Williamson selling its generics at a
loss. Liggett filed this suit, alleging, inter alia, that volume rebates by
Brown & Williamson to wholesalers amounted to price discrimination
that had a reasonable possibility of injuring competition in violation of

$ 2(a) of the Clayton Act, as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act. Liggett claimed that the rebates were integral to a predatory pricing
scheme, in which Brown & Williamson set below-cost prices to pressure
Liggett to raise list prices on its generics, thus restraining the economy
segment's growth and preserving Brown & Williamson's supracompetitive profits on branded cigarettes. After a jury returned a verdict in
favor of Liggett, the District Court held that Brown & Williamson was
entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Among other things, it found
a lack of injury to competition because there had been no slowing of the
generics' growth rate and no tacit coordination of prices in the economy
segment by the various manufacturers. In affirming, the Court of Appeals held that the dynamic of conscious parallelism among oligopolists
could not produce competitive injury in a predatory pricing setting.

Held: Brown & Williamson is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

Pp. 219-243.

(a) The Robinson-Patman Act, by its terms, condemns price discrimination only to the extent that it threatens to injure competition. A
claim of primary-line competitive injury under the Act, the type alleged
here, is of the same general character as a predatory pricing claim under

$ 2 of the Sherman Act: A business rival has priced its products in an
unfair manner with an object to eliminate or retard competition and
thereby gain and exercise control over prices in the relevant market.

Utah Pie Co. v. Continental Baking Co., 386 U. S. 685, distinguished.
Accordingly, two prerequisites to recovery are also the same. A plaintiff must prove (1) that the prices complained of are below an appropriate measure of its rival's costs and (2) that the competitor had a
reasonable prospect of recouping its investment in below-cost prices.
Without recoupment, even if predatory pricing causes the target painful
losses, it produces lower aggregate prices in the market, and consumer
welfare is enhanced. For recoupment to occur, the pricing must be capable, as a threshold matter, of producing the intended effects on the
firm's rivals. This requires an understanding of the extent and duration of the alleged predation, the relative financial strength of the predator and its intended victim, and their respective incentives and will.
The inquiry is whether, given the aggregate losses caused by the belowcost pricing, the intended target would likely succumb. If so, then
there is the further question whether the below-cost pricing would
likely injure competition in the relevant market. The plaintiff must
demonstrate that there is a likelihood that the scheme alleged would
cause a rise in prices above a competitive level sufficient to compensate
for the amounts expended on the predation, including the time value of
the money invested in it. Evidence of below-cost pricing is not alone
sufficient to permit an inference of probable recoupment and injury to
competition. The determination requires an estimate of the alleged
predation's cost and a close analysis of both the scheme alleged and
the relevant market's structure and conditions. Although not easy to
establish, these prerequisites are essential components of real market
injury. Pp. 219-227.

(b) An oligopoly's interdependent pricing may provide a means for
achieving recoupment and thus may form the basis of a primary-line
injury claim. Predatory pricing schemes, in general, are implausible,
see Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U. S.
574, 588-590, and are even more improbable when they require coordinated action among several firms, id., at 590. They are least likely to
occur where, as alleged here, the cooperation among firms is tacit, since
effective tacit coordination is difficult to achieve; since there is a high
likelihood that any attempt by one oligopolist to discipline a rival by
cutting prices will produce an outbreak of competition; and since a predator's present losses fall on it alone, while the later supracompetitive
profits must be shared with every other oligopolist in proportion to
its market share, including the intended victim. Nonetheless, the
Robinson-Patman Act suggests no exclusion from coverage when
primary-line injury occurs in an oligopoly setting, and this Court declines to create a per se rule of nonliability. In order for all of the Act's
words to carry adequate meaning, competitive injury under the Act
must extend beyond the monopoly setting. Pp. 227-230.

(c) The record in this case demonstrates that the scheme Liggett alleged, when judged against the market's realities, does not provide an
adequate basis for a finding of liability. While a reasonable jury could
conclude that Brown & Williamson envisioned or intended an anticompetitive course of events and that the price of its generics was below its
costs for 18 months, the evidence is inadequate to show that in pursuing
this scheme, it had a reasonable prospect of recovering its losses from
below-cost pricing through slowing the growth of generics. No inference of recoupment is sustainable on this record, because no evidence
suggests that Brown & Williamson was likely to obtain the power to
raise the prices for generic cigarettes above a competitive level, which
is an indispensable aspect of Liggett's own proffered theory. The
output and price information does not indicate that oligopolistic price
coordination in fact produced supracompetitive prices in the generic
segment. Nor does the evidence about the market and Brown &
Williamson's conduct indicate that the alleged scheme was likely to have
brought about tacit coordination and oligopoly pricing in that segment.

TOBACCO CORP.

Opinion of the Court

Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case stems from a market struggle that erupted inthe domestic cigarette industry in the mid-1980's. Petitioner Brooke Group Ltd., whom we, like the parties to thecase, refer to as Liggett because of its former corporate
name, charges that to counter its innovative development ofgeneric cigarettes, respondent Brown & Williamson Tobacco
Corporation introduced its own line of generic cigarettes inan unlawful effort to stifle price competition in the economy
segment of the national cigarette market. Liggett contendsthat Brown & Williamson cut prices on generic cigarettes
below cost and offered discriminatory volume rebates towholesalers to force Liggett to raise its own generic cigarette prices and introduce oligopoly pricing in the economysegment. We hold that Brown & Williamson is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law.

I
In 1980, Liggett pioneered the development of the econ-omy segment of the national cigarette market by introducing

a line of "black and white" generic cigarettes. The economysegment of the market, sometimes called the generic segment, is characterized by its bargain prices and comprises avariety of different products: black and whites, which are
true generics sold in plain white packages with simple blacklettering describing their contents; private label generics,
which carry the trade dress of a specific purchaser, usually aretail chain; branded generics, which carry a brand name but
which, like black and whites and private label generics, aresold at a deep discount and with little or no advertising; and
"Value-25s," packages of 25 cigarettes that are sold to theconsumer some 12.5% below the cost of a normal 20-cigarette
pack. By 1984, when Brown & Williamson entered the ge-neric segment and set in motion the series of events giving
rise to this suit, Liggett's black and whites represented 97%of the generic segment, which in turn accounted for a little

213Cite as: 509 U. S. 209 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
more than 4% of domestic cigarette sales. Prior to Liggett's
introduction of black and whites in 1980, sales of generic cigarettes amounted to less than 1% of the domestic cigarette
market.

Because of the procedural posture of this case, we view
the evidence in the light most favorable to Liggett. The
parties are in basic agreement, however, regarding the central, historical facts. Cigarette manufacturing has long
been one of America's most concentrated industries, see F.
Scherer & D. Ross, Industrial Market Structure and Economic Performance 250 (3d ed. 1990) (hereinafter Scherer &
Ross); App. 495-498, and for decades, production has been
dominated by six firms: R. J. Reynolds, Philip Morris, American Brands, Lorillard, and the two litigants involved here,
Liggett and Brown & Williamson. R. J. Reynolds and Philip
Morris, the two industry leaders, enjoyed respective market
shares of about 28% and 40% at the time of trial. Brown &
Williamson ran a distant third, its market share never exceeding 12% at any time relevant to this dispute. Liggett's
share of the market was even less, from a low of just over
2% in 1980 to a high of just over 5% in 1984.

The cigarette industry also has long been one of America's
most profitable, in part because for many years there was
no significant price competition among the rival firms. See
Scherer & Ross 250-251; R. Tennant, American Cigarette
Industry 86-87 (1950); App. 128, 500-509, 531. List prices
for cigarettes increased in lockstep, twice a year, for a number of years, irrespective of the rate of inflation, changes
in the costs of production, or shifts in consumer demand.
Substantial evidence suggests that in recent decades, the industry reaped the benefits of prices above a competitive
level, though not through unlawful conduct of the type that
once characterized the industry. See Tennant, supra, at
275, 342; App. 389-392, 514-519, 658-659; cf. American Tobacco Co. v. United States, 328 U. S. 781 (1946); United States

Opinion of the Court

v. American Tobacco Co., 221 U. S. 106 (1911); Scherer &Ross 451.

By 1980, however, broad market trends were workingagainst the industry. Overall demand for cigarettes in the
United States was declining, and no immediate prospect of
recovery existed. As industry volume shrank, all firmsdeveloped substantial excess capacity. This decline in demand, coupled with the effects of nonprice competition, hada severe negative impact on Liggett. Once a major force in
the industry, with market shares in excess of 20%, Liggett'smarket share had declined by 1980 to a little over 2%. With
this meager share of the market, Liggett was on the verge
of going out of business.

At the urging of a distributor, Liggett took an unusual
step to revive its prospects: It developed a line of black and
white generic cigarettes. When introduced in 1980, black
and whites were offered to consumers at a list price roughly
30% lower than the list price of full-priced, branded cigarettes. They were also promoted at the wholesale level by
means of rebates that increased with the volume of cigarettes ordered. Black and white cigarettes thus represented a new marketing category. The category's principal
competitive characteristic was low price. Liggett's black
and whites were an immediate and considerable success,
growing from a fraction of a percent of the market at their
introduction to over 4% of the total cigarette market by
early 1984.

As the market for Liggett's generic cigarettes expanded,
the other cigarette companies found themselves unable to
ignore the economy segment. In general, the growth of generics came at the expense of the other firms' profitable sales
of branded cigarettes. Brown & Williamson was hardest
hit, because many of Brown & Williamson's brands were favored by consumers who were sensitive to changes in cigarette prices. Although Brown & Williamson sold only 11.4%
of the market's branded cigarettes, 20% of the converts to

215Cite as: 509 U. S. 209 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
Liggett's black and whites had switched from a Brown &Williamson brand. Losing volume and profits in its branded

products, Brown & Williamson determined to enter thegeneric segment of the cigarette market. In July 1983,
Brown & Williamson had begun selling Value-25s, and in the
spring of 1984, it introduced its own black and whitecigarette.

Brown & Williamson was neither the first nor the onlycigarette company to recognize the threat posed by Liggett's
black and whites and to respond in the economy segment.R. J. Reynolds had also introduced a Value-25 in 1983. And
before Brown & Williamson introduced its own black and
whites, R. J. Reynolds had repriced its "Doral" branded cigarette at generic levels. To compete with Liggett's black and
whites, R. J. Reynolds dropped its list price on Doral about
30% and used volume rebates to wholesalers as an incentive
to spur orders. Doral was the first competition at Liggett's
price level.

Brown & Williamson's entry was an even graver threat to
Liggett's dominance of the generic category. Unlike R. J.
Reynolds' Doral, Brown & Williamson's product was also a
black and white and so would be in direct competition with
Liggett's product at the wholesale level and on the retail
shelf. Because Liggett's and Brown & Williamson's black
and whites were more or less fungible, wholesalers had little
incentive to carry more than one line. And unlike R. J.
Reynolds, Brown & Williamson not only matched Liggett's
prices but beat them. At the retail level, the suggested list
price of Brown & Williamson's black and whites was the
same as Liggett's, but Brown & Williamson's volume discounts to wholesalers were larger. Brown & Williamson's
rebate structure also encompassed a greater number of volume categories than Liggett's, with the highest categories
carrying special rebates for orders of very substantial size.
Brown & Williamson marketed its black and whites to Liggett's existing distributors as well as to its own full list of

TOBACCO CORP.

Opinion of the Court

buyers, which included a thousand wholesalers who had notyet carried any generic products.

Liggett responded to Brown & Williamson's introductionof black and whites in two ways. First, Liggett increased
its own wholesale rebates. This precipitated a price war at
the wholesale level, in which Liggett five times attempted tobeat the rebates offered by Brown & Williamson. At the

end of each round, Brown & Williamson maintained a realadvantage over Liggett's prices. Although it is undisputed
that Brown & Williamson's original net price for its blackand whites was above its costs, Liggett contends that by the
end of the rebate war, Brown & Williamson was selling its
black and whites at a loss. This rebate war occurred before
Brown & Williamson had sold a single black and white
cigarette.

Liggett's second response was to file a lawsuit. Two
weeks after Brown & Williamson announced its entry into
the generic segment, again before Brown & Williamson had
sold any generic cigarettes, Liggett filed a complaint in the
United States District Court for the Middle District of North
Carolina alleging trademark infringement and unfair competition. Liggett later amended its complaint to add an antitrust claim under $ 2(a) of the Clayton Act, as amended by
the Robinson-Patman Act, 49 Stat. 1526, 15 U. S. C. $ 13(a),
which alleged illegal price discrimination between Brown
& Williamson's full-priced branded cigarettes and its lowpriced generics. See Liggett Group, Inc. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 1989-1 Trade Cas. (CCH) || 68,583,
p. 61,099 (MDNC 1988). These claims were either dismissed
on summary judgment, see ibid., or rejected by the jury.
They were not appealed.

Liggett also amended its complaint to add a second
Robinson-Patman Act claim, which is the subject of the present controversy. Liggett alleged that Brown & Williamson's
volume rebates to wholesalers amounted to price discrimination that had a reasonable possibility of injuring competition,

509us1u104 05-04-97 17:18:22 PAGES OPINPGT

217Cite as: 509 U. S. 209 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
in violation of $ 2(a). Liggett claimed that Brown & Wil-liamson's discriminatory volume rebates were integral to

a scheme of predatory pricing, in which Brown & William-son reduced its net prices for generic cigarettes below average variable costs. According to Liggett, these below-cost
prices were not promotional but were intended to pressureit to raise its list prices on generic cigarettes, so that the

percentage price difference between generic and brandedcigarettes would narrow. Liggett explained that it would
have been unable to reduce its wholesale rebates withoutlosing substantial market share to Brown & Williamson; its
only choice, if it wished to avoid prolonged losses on its principal product line, was to raise retail prices. The resulting
reduction in the list price gap, it was said, would restrain
the growth of the economy segment and preserve Brown
& Williamson's supracompetitive profits on its branded
cigarettes.

The trial began in the fall of 1989. By that time, all six
cigarette companies had entered the economy segment.
The economy segment was the fastest growing segment of
the cigarette market, having increased from about 4% of the
market in 1984, when the rebate war in generics began, to
about 15% in 1989. Black and white generics had declined
as a force in the economy segment as consumer interest
shifted toward branded generics, but Liggett's overall volume had increased steadily to 9 billion generic cigarettes
sold. Overall, the 2.8 billion generic cigarettes sold in 1981
had become 80 billion by 1989.

The consumer price of generics had increased along with
output. For a year, the list prices for generic cigarettes established at the end of the rebate war remained stable. But
in June 1985, Liggett raised its list price, and the other firms
followed several months later. The precise effect of the list
price increase is difficult to assess, because all of the cigarette firms offered a variety of discounts, coupons, and
other promotions directly to consumers on both generic and

TOBACCO CORP.

Opinion of the Court

branded cigarettes. Nonetheless, at least some portion ofthe list price increase was reflected in a higher net price to

the consumer.In December 1985, Brown & Williamson attempted to increase its list prices, but retracted the announced increase
when the other firms adhered to their existing prices. Thus,after Liggett's June 1985 increase, list prices on generics did

not change again until the summer of 1986, when a patternof twice yearly increases in tandem with the full-priced
branded cigarettes was established. The dollar amount ofthese increases was the same for generic and full-priced cigarettes, which resulted in a greater percentage price increase
in the less expensive generic cigarettes and a narrowing of
the percentage gap between the list price of branded and
black and white cigarettes, from approximately 38% at the
time Brown & Williamson entered the segment to approximately 27% at the time of trial. Also by the time of trial,
five of the six manufacturers, including Liggett, had introduced so-called "subgenerics," a category of branded generic
cigarettes that sold at a discount of 50% or more off the list
price of full-priced branded cigarettes.

After a 115-day trial involving almost 3,000 exhibits and
over a score of witnesses, the jury returned a verdict in favor
of Liggett, finding on the special verdict form that Brown &
Williamson had engaged in price discrimination that had a
reasonable possibility of injuring competition in the domestic
cigarette market as a whole. The jury awarded Liggett
$49.6 million in damages, which the District Court trebled
to $148.8 million. After reviewing the record, however, the
District Court held that Brown & Williamson was entitled
to judgment as a matter of law on three separate grounds:
lack of injury to competition, lack of antitrust injury to Liggett, and lack of a causal link between the discriminatory
rebates and Liggett's alleged injury. Liggett Group, Inc. v.
Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 748 F. Supp. 344
(MDNC 1990). With respect to the first issue, which is the

only one before us, the District Court found that no slowingof the growth rate of generics, and thus no injury to competition, was possible unless there had been tacit coordination ofprices in the economy segment of the cigarette market by
the various manufacturers. Id., at 354-355. The DistrictCourt held that a reasonable jury could come to but one conclusion about the existence of such coordination among thefirms contending for shares of the economy segment: it did
not exist, and Brown & Williamson therefore had no reason-able possibility of limiting the growth of the segment.

Id.,at 356-358.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuitaffirmed.

Liggett Group, Inc. v. Brown & Williamson To-bacco Corp., 964 F. 2d 335 (1992). The Court of Appeals held

that the dynamic of conscious parallelism among oligopolistscould not produce competitive injury in a predatory pricing
setting, which necessarily involves a price cut by one of theoligopolists. Id., at 342. In the Court of Appeals' view,
"[t]o rely on the characteristics of an oligopoly to assure re-coupment of losses from a predatory pricing scheme after
one oligopolist has made a competitive move is . . . economi-cally irrational."

Price discrimination is made unlawful by $ 2(a) of the Clay-ton Act, 38 Stat. 730, as amended by the Robinson-Patman

Act, which provides:

"It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in com-merce, in the course of such commerce, either directly

or indirectly, to discriminate in price between differentpurchasers of commodities of like grade and quality . . .

competition with any person who either grants or know-ingly receives the benefit of such discrimination, or with

customers of either of them." 15 U. S. C. $ 13(a).
Although we have reiterated that " `a price discriminationwithin the meaning of [this] provision is merely a price difference,' " Texaco Inc. v. Hasbrouck, 496 U. S. 543, 558 (1990)(quoting

FTC v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., 363 U. S. 536, 549(1960)), the statute as a practical matter could not, and does

not, ban all price differences charged to "different purchas-ers of commodities of like grade and quality." Instead, the
statute contains a number of important limitations, one ofwhich is central to evaluating Liggett's claim: By its terms,
the Robinson-Patman Act condemns price discriminationonly to the extent that it threatens to injure competition.
The availability of statutory defenses permitting price dis-crimination when it is based on differences in costs, $ 13(a),
"changing conditions affecting the market for or the market-ability of the goods concerned," ibid., or conduct undertaken
"in good faith to meet an equally low price of a competitor,"$ 13(b); Standard Oil Co. v. FTC, 340 U. S. 231, 250 (1951),
confirms that Congress did not intend to outlaw price differ-ences that result from or further the forces of competition.
Thus, "the Robinson-Patman Act should be construed con-sistently with broader policies of the antitrust laws."

Liggett contends that Brown & Williamson's discrimina-tory volume rebates to wholesalers threatened substantial
competitive injury by furthering a predatory pricing schemedesigned to purge competition from the economy segment
of the cigarette market. This type of injury, which harmsdirect competitors of the discriminating seller, is known as
primary-line injury. See FTC v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc.,
supra, at 538. We last addressed primary-line injury over25 years ago, in Utah Pie Co. v. Continental Baking Co.,

Opinion of the Court
386 U. S. 685 (1967). In Utah Pie, we reviewed the suffi-ciency of the evidence supporting jury verdicts against three

national pie companies that had engaged in a variety of pred-atory practices in the market for frozen pies in Salt Lake
City, with the intent to drive a local pie manufacturer out of
business. We reversed the Court of Appeals and held thatthe evidence presented was adequate to permit a jury to find

a likelihood of injury to competition. Id., at 703.

Utah Pie has often been interpreted to permit liability for
primary-line price discrimination on a mere showing that thedefendant intended to harm competition or produced a declining price structure. The case has been criticized on the
ground that such low standards of competitive injury are at
odds with the antitrust laws' traditional concern for consumer welfare and price competition. See Bowman, Restraint of Trade by the Supreme Court: The Utah Pie Case,
77 Yale L. J. 70 (1967); R. Posner, Antitrust Law: An Economic Perspective 193-194 (1976); L. Sullivan, Antitrust 687
(1977); 3 P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law || 720c (1978)
(hereinafter Areeda & Turner); R. Bork, The Antitrust Paradox 386-387 (1978); H. Hovenkamp, Economics and Federal
Antitrust Law 188-189 (1985). We do not regard the Utah
Pie case itself as having the full significance attributed to
it by its detractors. Utah Pie was an early judicial inquiry

in this area and did not purport to set forth explicit, general standards for establishing a violation of the RobinsonPatman Act. As the law has been explored since Utah Pie,
it has become evident that primary-line competitive injury
under the Robinson-Patman Act is of the same general character as the injury inflicted by predatory pricing schemes
actionable under $ 2 of the Sherman Act. See, e. g., Henry v.
Chloride, Inc., 809 F. 2d 1334, 1345 (CA8 1987); D. E. Rogers

1992) (hereinafter Areeda & Hovenkamp). There are, to besure, differences between the two statutes. For example,
we interpret $ 2 of the Sherman Act to condemn predatorypricing when it poses "a dangerous probability of actual monopolization," Spectrum Sports, Inc. v. McQuillan, 506 U. S.
447, 455 (1993), whereas the Robinson-Patman Act requiresonly that there be "a reasonable possibility" of substantial injury to competition before its protections are trig-gered,

Falls City Industries, Inc. v. Vanco Beverage, Inc.,
460 U. S. 428, 434 (1983). But whatever additional flexibilitythe Robinson-Patman Act standard may imply, the essence

of the claim under either statute is the same: A businessrival has priced its products in an unfair manner with an
object to eliminate or retard competition and thereby gain
and exercise control over prices in the relevant market.Accordingly, whether the claim alleges predatory pricing

under $ 2 of the Sherman Act or primary-line price discrimi-nation under the Robinson-Patman Act, two prerequisites to
recovery remain the same. First, a plaintiff seeking to es-tablish competitive injury resulting from a rival's low prices
must prove that the prices complained of are below an appro-priate measure of its rival's costs.

v. Monfort of Colorado, Inc., 479 U. S. 104, 117 (1986); Mat1 Because the parties in this case agree that the relevant measure of cost

Cargill and Matsushita reserved as a formal matter the ques-tion " `whether recovery should

ever be available . . . when
the pricing in question is above some measure of incrementalcost,' "

Cargill, supra, at 117-118, n. 12 (quoting Matsushita,
supra, at 585, n. 9), the reasoning in both opinions suggests
that only below-cost prices should suffice, and we have rejected elsewhere the notion that above-cost prices that are
below general market levels or the costs of a firm's competitors inflict injury to competition cognizable under the antitrust laws. See Atlantic Richfield Co. v. USA Petroleum
Co., 495 U. S. 328, 340 (1990). "Low prices benefit consumers regardless of how those prices are set, and so long as
they are above predatory levels, they do not threaten
competition. . . . We have adhered to this principle regardless
of the type of antitrust claim involved." Ibid. As a general
rule, the exclusionary effect of prices above a relevant measure of cost either reflects the lower cost structure of the
alleged predator, and so represents competition on the merits, or is beyond the practical ability of a judicial tribunal to
control without courting intolerable risks of chilling legitimate price cutting. See Areeda & Hovenkamp |||| 714.2,
714.3. "To hold that the antitrust laws protect competitors
from the loss of profits due to such price competition would,
in effect, render illegal any decision by a firm to cut prices
in order to increase market share. The antitrust laws require no such perverse result." Cargill, supra, at 116.

Even in an oligopolistic market, when a firm drops its
prices to a competitive level to demonstrate to a maverick
the unprofitability of straying from the group, it would be

Opinion of the Court

illogical to condemn the price cut: The antitrust laws thenwould be an obstacle to the chain of events most conducive

to a breakdown of oligopoly pricing and the onset of competi-tion. Even if the ultimate effect of the cut is to induce or
reestablish supracompetitive pricing, discouraging a price
cut and forcing firms to maintain supracompetitive prices,thus depriving consumers of the benefits of lower prices in

the interim, does not constitute sound antitrust policy. Cf.Areeda & Hovenkamp |||| 714.2d, 714.2f; Areeda & Turner,
Predatory Pricing and Related Practices under Section 2 ofthe Sherman Act, 88 Harv. L. Rev. 697, 708-709 (1975);
Posner, Antitrust Law: An Economic Perspective, at 195,
n. 39.

The second prerequisite to holding a competitor liable
under the antitrust laws for charging low prices is a demonstration that the competitor had a reasonable prospect, or,
under $ 2 of the Sherman Act, a dangerous probability, of
recouping its investment in below-cost prices. See Matsushita, supra, at 589; Cargill, supra, at 119, n. 15. "For the
investment to be rational, the [predator] must have a reasonable expectation of recovering, in the form of later monopoly
profits, more than the losses suffered." Matsushita, supra,
at 588-589. Recoupment is the ultimate object of an unlawful predatory pricing scheme; it is the means by which a
predator profits from predation. Without it, predatory pricing produces lower aggregate prices in the market, and consumer welfare is enhanced. Although unsuccessful predatory pricing may encourage some inefficient substitution
toward the product being sold at less than its cost, unsuccessful predation is in general a boon to consumers.

That below-cost pricing may impose painful losses on its
target is of no moment to the antitrust laws if competition is
not injured: It is axiomatic that the antitrust laws were
passed for "the protection of competition, not competitors."
Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U. S. 294, 320 (1962).

Opinion of the Court
that it was not enough to inquire "whether the defendant has
engaged in `unfair' or `predatory' tactics"; rather, we insisted
that the plaintiff prove "a dangerous probability that [the
defendant] would monopolize a particular market." Spectrum Sports, 506 U. S., at 459. Even an act of pure malice
by one business competitor against another does not, without
more, state a claim under the federal antitrust laws; those
laws do not create a federal law of unfair competition or
"purport to afford remedies for all torts committed by or
against persons engaged in interstate commerce." Hunt v.
Crumboch, 325 U. S. 821, 826 (1945).

For recoupment to occur, below-cost pricing must be capable, as a threshold matter, of producing the intended effects
on the firm's rivals, whether driving them from the market,
or, as was alleged to be the goal here, causing them to raise
their prices to supracompetitive levels within a disciplined
oligopoly. This requires an understanding of the extent and
duration of the alleged predation, the relative financial
strength of the predator and its intended victim, and their
respective incentives and will. See 3 Areeda & Turner
|| 711b. The inquiry is whether, given the aggregate losses
caused by the below-cost pricing, the intended target would
likely succumb.

If circumstances indicate that below-cost pricing could
likely produce its intended effect on the target, there is still
the further question whether it would likely injure competition in the relevant market. The plaintiff must demonstrate
that there is a likelihood that the predatory scheme alleged
would cause a rise in prices above a competitive level that
would be sufficient to compensate for the amounts expended
on the predation, including the time value of the money invested in it. As we have observed on a prior occasion, "[i]n
order to recoup their losses, [predators] must obtain enough
market power to set higher than competitive prices, and then
must sustain those prices long enough to earn in excess

profits what they earlier gave up in below-cost prices."
Matsushita, 475 U. S., at 590-591.

Evidence of below-cost pricing is not alone sufficient topermit an inference of probable recoupment and injury to

competition. Determining whether recoupment of predatory losses is likely requires an estimate of the cost of thealleged predation and a close analysis of both the scheme

alleged by the plaintiff and the structure and conditions ofthe relevant market. Cf.,

e. g., Elzinga & Mills, Testing for
Predation: Is Recoupment Feasible?, 34 Antitrust Bull. 869(1989) (constructing one possible model for evaluating recoupment). If market circumstances or deficiencies in proof
would bar a reasonable jury from finding that the scheme
alleged would likely result in sustained supracompetitive
pricing, the plaintiff 's case has failed. In certain situations--for example, where the market is highly diffuse and
competitive, or where new entry is easy, or the defendant
lacks adequate excess capacity to absorb the market shares
of his rivals and cannot quickly create or purchase new
capacity--summary disposition of the case is appropriate.
See, e. g., Cargill, 479 U. S., at 119-120, n. 15.

These prerequisites to recovery are not easy to establish,
but they are not artificial obstacles to recovery; rather, they
are essential components of real market injury. As we have
said in the Sherman Act context, "predatory pricing schemes
are rarely tried, and even more rarely successful," Matsushita, supra, at 589, and the costs of an erroneous finding of
liability are high. "[T]he mechanism by which a firm engages in predatory pricing--lowering prices--is the same
mechanism by which a firm stimulates competition; because
`cutting prices in order to increase business often is the very
essence of competition . . . [;] mistaken inferences . . . are
especially costly, because they chill the very conduct the antitrust laws are designed to protect.' " Cargill, supra, at
122, n. 17 (quoting Matsushita, supra, at 594). It would be
ironic indeed if the standards for predatory pricing liability

were so low that antitrust suits themselves became a tool forkeeping prices high.

B
Liggett does not allege that Brown & Williamson soughtto drive it from the market but that Brown & Williamson

sought to preserve supracompetitive profits on branded ciga-rettes by pressuring Liggett to raise its generic cigarette
prices through a process of tacit collusion with the other cig-arette companies. Tacit collusion, sometimes called oligopolistic price coordination or conscious parallelism, describesthe process, not in itself unlawful, by which firms in a concentrated market might in effect share monopoly power, settingtheir prices at a profit-maximizing, supracompetitive level by
recognizing their shared economic interests and their inter-dependence with respect to price and output decisions. See
2 Areeda & Turner || 404; Scherer & Ross 199-208.In

Matsushita, we remarked upon the general implausibil-ity of predatory pricing. See 475 U. S., at 588-590. Matsushita observed that such schemes are even more improbablewhen they require coordinated action among several firms.
Id., at 590. Matsushita involved an allegation of an expressconspiracy to engage in predatory pricing. The Court noted
that in addition to the usual difficulties that face a singlefirm attempting to recoup predatory losses, other problems
render a conspiracy "incalculably more difficult to execute."
Ibid. In order to succeed, the conspirators must agree onhow to allocate present losses and future gains among the

firms involved, and each firm must resist powerful incentivesto cheat on whatever agreement is reached. Ibid.

However unlikely predatory pricing by multiple firms maybe when they conspire, it is even less likely when, as here,
there is no express coordination. Firms that seek to recouppredatory losses through the conscious parallelism of oligopoly must rely on uncertain and ambiguous signals to achieveconcerted action. The signals are subject to misinterpretation and are a blunt and imprecise means of ensuring smooth

Opinion of the Court

cooperation, especially in the context of changing or un-precedented market circumstances. This anticompetitive

minuet is most difficult to compose and to perform, even fora disciplined oligopoly.

From one standpoint, recoupment through oligopolistic
price coordination could be thought more feasible than re-coupment through monopoly: In the oligopoly setting, the

victim itself has an economic incentive to acquiesce in thescheme. If forced to choose between cutting prices and sustaining losses, maintaining prices and losing market share,or raising prices and enjoying a share of supracompetitive
profits, a firm may yield to the last alternative. Yet on the
whole, tacit cooperation among oligopolists must be considered the least likely means of recouping predatory losses.
In addition to the difficulty of achieving effective tacit coordination and the high likelihood that any attempt to discipline will produce an outbreak of competition, the predator's
present losses in a case like this fall on it alone, while the
later supracompetitive profits must be shared with every
other oligopolist in proportion to its market share, including
the intended victim. In this case, for example, Brown &
Williamson, with its 11-12% share of the cigarette market,
would have had to generate around $9 in supracompetitive
profits for each $1 invested in predation; the remaining $8
would belong to its competitors, who had taken no risk.

Liggett suggests that these considerations led the Court
of Appeals to rule out its theory of recovery as a matter
of law. Although the proper interpretation of the Court of
Appeals' opinion is not free from doubt, there is some indication that it held as a matter of law that the Robinson-Patman
Act does not reach a primary-line injury claim in which tacit
coordination among oligopolists provides the alleged basis
for recoupment. The Court of Appeals' opinion does not
contain the traditional apparatus of fact review; rather, it
focuses on theoretical and legal arguments. The final paragraph appears to state the holding: Brown & Williamson

may not be held liable because oligopoly pricing does not" `provide an economically rational basis' " for recouping

predatory losses. 964 F. 2d, at 342.To the extent that the Court of Appeals may have held
that the interdependent pricing of an oligopoly may never
provide a means for achieving recoupment and so may notform the basis of a primary-line injury claim, we disagree.

A predatory pricing scheme designed to preserve or createa stable oligopoly, if successful, can injure consumers in the
same way, and to the same extent, as one designed to bringabout a monopoly. However unlikely that possibility may be
as a general matter, when the realities of the market and the
record facts indicate that it has occurred and was likely to
have succeeded, theory will not stand in the way of liability.
See Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Services, Inc.,
504 U. S. 451, 466-467 (1992).

The Robinson-Patman Act, which amended $ 2 of the original Clayton Act, suggests no exclusion from coverage when
primary-line injury occurs in an oligopoly setting. Unlike
the provisions of the Sherman Act, which speak only of various forms of express agreement and monopoly, see 15 U. S. C.

$$ 1, 2, the Robinson-Patman Act is phrased in broader, disjunctive terms, prohibiting price discrimination "where the
effect of such discrimination may be substantially to lessen
competition or tend to create a monopoly," 15 U. S. C. $ 13(a).
For all the words of the Act to carry adequate meaning, competitive injury under the Act must extend beyond the monopoly setting. Cf. Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U. S. 330,
339 (1979) ("Canons of construction ordinarily suggest that
terms connected by a disjunctive be given separate meanings, unless the context dictates otherwise"). The language
referring to a substantial lessening of competition was part
of the original Clayton Act $ 2, see Act of Oct. 15, 1914, ch.
322, 38 Stat. 730, and the same phrasing appears in $ 7 of
that Act. In the $ 7 context, it has long been settled that
excessive concentration, and the oligopolistic price coordina509us1u104 05-04-97 17:18:22 PAGES OPINPGT

tion it portends, may be the injury to competition the Actprohibits. See, e. g., United States v. Philadelphia Nat.

Bank, 374 U. S. 321 (1963). We adhere to "the normal ruleof statutory construction that identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the samemeaning."

Sullivan v. Stroop, 496 U. S. 478, 484 (1990) (in-ternal quotation marks omitted). See also J. Truett Payne

Co. v. Chrysler Motors Corp., 451 U. S. 557, 562 (1981) (evalu-ating the competitive injury requirement of RobinsonPatman Act $ 2(a) in light of analogous interpretations ofClayton Act $ 7). We decline to create a per se rule of nonliability for predatory price discrimination when recoupmentis alleged to take place through supracompetitive oligopoly
pricing. Cf. Cargill, 479 U. S., at 121.

III
Although Liggett's theory of liability, as an abstract mat-ter, is within the reach of the statute, we agree with the

Court of Appeals and the District Court that Liggett wasnot entitled to submit its case to the jury. It is not customary for this Court to review the sufficiency of the evidence,but we will do so when the issue is properly before us and
the benefits of providing guidance concerning the proper ap-plication of a legal standard and avoiding the systemic costs
associated with further proceedings justify the required ex-penditure of judicial resources. See, e. g., Aspen Skiing Co.
v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., 472 U. S. 585, 605-611(1985); Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Service Corp., 465 U. S.
752, 765-768 (1984); United States v. Pabst Brewing Co., 384U. S. 546, 550-552 (1966). The record in this case demonstrates that the anticompetitive scheme Liggett alleged,when judged against the realities of the market, does not
provide an adequate basis for a finding of liability.

A
Liggett's theory of competitive injury through oligopolisticprice coordination depends upon a complex chain of cause

Opinion of the Court
and effect: Brown & Williamson would enter the generic seg-ment with list prices matching Liggett's but with massive,

discriminatory volume rebates directed at Liggett's biggestwholesalers; as a result, the net price of Brown & Williamson's generics would be below its costs; Liggett would suffer
losses trying to defend its market share and wholesale cus-tomer base by matching Brown & Williamson's rebates; to

avoid further losses, Liggett would raise its list prices ongenerics or acquiesce in price leadership by Brown & Williamson; higher list prices to consumers would shrink thepercentage gap in retail price between generic and branded
cigarettes; and this narrowing of the gap would make generics less appealing to the consumer, thus slowing the growth
of the economy segment and reducing cannibalization of
branded sales and their associated supracompetitive profits.

Although Brown & Williamson's entry into the generic
segment could be regarded as procompetitive in intent as
well as effect, the record contains sufficient evidence from
which a reasonable jury could conclude that Brown &
Williamson envisioned or intended this anticompetitive
course of events. See, e. g., App. 57-58, 67-68, 89-91, 99,
112-114, 200, 241, 253, 257, 262-263, 279-280, 469-470, 664-
666. There is also sufficient evidence in the record from
which a reasonable jury could conclude that for a period of
approximately 18 months, Brown & Williamson's prices on
its generic cigarettes were below its costs, see id., at 338-
339, 651, 740, and that this below-cost pricing imposed losses
on Liggett that Liggett was unwilling to sustain, given its
corporate parent's effort to locate a buyer for the company,
see id., at 74, 92, 200, 253, 596-597. Liggett has failed to
demonstrate competitive injury as a matter of law, however,
because its proof is flawed in a critical respect: The evidence
is inadequate to show that in pursuing this scheme, Brown &
Williamson had a reasonable prospect of recovering its losses
from below-cost pricing through slowing the growth of generics. As we have noted, "[t]he success of any predatory

scheme depends on maintaining monopoly power for longenough both to recoup the predator's losses and to harvest

some additional gain." Matsushita, 475 U. S., at 589 (em-phasis omitted).

No inference of recoupment is sustainable on this record,because no evidence suggests that Brown & Williamson--
whatever its intent in introducing black and whites may havebeen--was likely to obtain the power to raise the prices for
generic cigarettes above a competitive level. Recoupmentthrough supracompetitive pricing in the economy segment of
the cigarette market is an indispensable aspect of Liggett'sown proffered theory, because a slowing of growth in the
economy segment, even if it results from an increase ingeneric prices, is not itself anticompetitive. Only if those
higher prices are a product of nonmarket forces has compe-tition suffered. If prices rise in response to an excess of
demand over supply, or segment growth slows as patterns ofconsumer preference become stable, the market is functioning in a competitive manner. Consumers are not injuredfrom the perspective of the antitrust laws by the price increases; they are in fact causing them. Thus, the linchpin
of the predatory scheme alleged by Liggett is Brown &Williamson's ability, with the other oligopolists, to raise

prices above a competitive level in the generic segment ofthe market. Because relying on tacit coordination among
oligopolists as a means of recouping losses from predatorypricing is "highly speculative," Areeda & Hovenkamp
|| 711.2c, at 647, competent evidence is necessary to allow a
reasonable inference that it poses an authentic threat to com-petition. The evidence in this case is insufficient to demonstrate the danger of Brown & Williamson's alleged scheme.

B
Based on Liggett's theory of the case and the record it
created, there are two means by which one might infer that

233Cite as: 509 U. S. 209 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
Brown & Williamson had a reasonable prospect of producingsustained supracompetitive pricing in the generic segment

adequate to recoup its predatory losses: first, if generic out-put or price information indicates that oligopolistic price coordination in fact produced supracompetitive prices in thegeneric segment; or second, if evidence about the market and
Brown & Williamson's conduct indicate that the allegedscheme was likely to have brought about tacit coordination
and oligopoly pricing in the generic segment, even if it didnot actually do so.

1
In this case, the price and output data do not support areasonable inference that Brown & Williamson and the other

cigarette companies elevated prices above a competitive levelfor generic cigarettes. Supracompetitive pricing entails a
restriction in output. See National Collegiate Athletic
Assn. v. Board of Regents of Univ. of Okla., 468 U. S. 85,104-108 (1984);

Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 441 U. S. 1, 19-20 (1979); P. Samuel-son & W. Nordhaus, Economics 516 (12th ed. 1985); Sullivan,

Antitrust, at 32; Bork, The Antitrust Paradox, at 178-179; 2Areeda & Turner || 403a; Easterbrook, The Limits of Antitrust, 63 Texas L. Rev. 1, 20, 31 (1984). In the present set-ting, in which output expanded at a rapid rate following
Brown & Williamson's alleged predation, output in the generic segment can only have been restricted in the sensethat it expanded at a slower rate than it would have absent

Brown & Williamson's intervention. Such a counterfactualproposition is difficult to prove in the best of circumstances;
here, the record evidence does not permit a reasonable infer-ence that output would have been greater without Brown &
Williamson's entry into the generic segment.

Following Brown & Williamson's entry, the rate at whichgeneric cigarettes were capturing market share did not slow;

indeed, the average rate of growth doubled. During the

four years from 1980 to 1984 in which Liggett was alone in
the generic segment, the segment gained market share at an
average rate of 1% of the overall market per year, from 0.4%
in 1980 to slightly more than 4% of the cigarette market in
1984. In the next five years, following the alleged predation, the generic segment expanded from 4% to more than
15% of the domestic cigarette market, or greater than 2%
per year.

While this evidence tends to show that Brown & Williamson's participation in the economy segment did not restrict
output, it is not dispositive. One could speculate, for example, that the rate of segment growth would have tripled, instead of doubled, without Brown & Williamson's alleged predation. But there is no concrete evidence of this. Indeed,
the only industry projection in the record estimating what
the segment's growth would have been without Brown &
Williamson's entry supports the opposite inference. In 1984,
Brown & Williamson forecast in an important planning document that the economy segment would account for 10% of
the total cigarette market by 1988 if it did not enter the
segment. App. 133, 135. In fact, in 1988, after what Liggett alleges was a sustained and dangerous anticompetitive
campaign by Brown & Williamson, the generic segment accounted for over 12% of the total market. Id., at 354-356.
Thus the segment's output expanded more robustly than
Brown & Williamson had estimated it would had Brown &
Williamson never entered.

Brown & Williamson did note in 1985, a year after introducing its black and whites, that its presence within
the generic segment "appears to have resulted in . . . a
slowing in the segment's growth rate." Id., at 257. But
this statement was made in early 1985, when Liggett
itself contends the below-cost pricing was still in effect and
before any anticompetitive contraction in output is alleged
to have occurred.

Opinion of the Court
Whatever it may mean,2 this statement has little value inevaluating the competitive implications of Brown & Williamson's later conduct, which was alleged to provide the basisfor recouping predatory losses.

In arguing that Brown & Williamson was able to exertmarket power and raise generic prices above a competitive
level in the generic category through tacit price coordinationwith the other cigarette manufacturers, Liggett places its
principal reliance on direct evidence of price behavior. Thisevidence demonstrates that the list prices on all cigarettes,
generic and branded alike, rose to a significant degree duringthe late 1980's.

Id., at 325. From 1986 to 1989, list priceson both generic and branded cigarettes increased twice a

year by similar amounts. Liggett's economic expert testi-fied that these price increases outpaced increases in costs,
taxes, and promotional expenditures. Id., at 525. The listprices of generics, moreover, rose at a faster rate than the
prices of branded cigarettes, thus narrowing the list pricedifferential between branded and generic products.

Id., at325. Liggett argues that this would permit a reasonable

jury to find that Brown & Williamson succeeded in bringingabout oligopolistic price coordination and supracompetitive
prices in the generic category sufficient to slow its growth,thereby preserving supracompetitive branded profits and recouping its predatory losses.A reasonable jury, however, could not have drawn the inferences Liggett proposes. All of Liggett's data are basedupon the list prices of various categories of cigarettes. Yet
the jury had before it undisputed evidence that during theperiod in question, list prices were not the actual prices paid
by consumers. 100 Tr. 227-229. As the market became un2 This statement could well have referred to the rate at which the segment was growing relative to prior years' generic volume; this "internal"
rate of growth would inevitably slow as the base volume against which it
was measured grew.

settled in the mid-1980's, the cigarette companies investedsubstantial sums in promotional schemes, including coupons,

stickers, and giveaways, that reduced the actual cost of ciga-rettes to consumers below list prices. 33 Tr. 206-209, 51
Tr. 130. This promotional activity accelerated as the decade
progressed. App. 509, 672. Many wholesalers also passedportions of their volume rebates on to the consumer, which

had the effect of further undermining the significance of theretail list prices.

Id., at 672, 687-692, 761-763. Especially
in an oligopoly setting, in which price competition is mostlikely to take place through less observable and less regulable means than list prices, it would be unreasonable to draw
conclusions about the existence of tacit coordination or supracompetitive pricing from data that reflect only list prices.

Even on its own terms, the list price data relied upon by
Liggett to demonstrate a narrowing of the price differential
between generic and full-priced branded cigarettes could not
support the conclusion that supracompetitive pricing had
been introduced into the generic segment. Liggett's gap
data ignore the effect of "subgeneric" cigarettes, which were
priced at discounts of 50% or more from the list prices of
normal branded cigarettes. See, e. g., id., at 682-686. Liggett itself, while supposedly under the sway of oligopoly
power, pioneered this development in 1988 with the introduction of its "Pyramid" brand. Id., at 326. By the time of
trial, five of the six major manufacturers offered a cigarette
in this category at a discount from the full list price of at
least 50%. Id., at 685-686; 147 Tr. 107. Thus, the price difference between the highest priced branded cigarette and
the lowest price cigarettes in the economy segment, instead
of narrowing over the course of the period of alleged predation as Liggett would argue, grew to a substantial extent.
In June 1984, before Brown & Williamson entered the generic segment, a consumer could obtain a carton of black and
white generic cigarettes from Liggett at a 38% discount from
the list price of a leading brand; after the conduct Liggett

Opinion of the Court
complains of, consumers could obtain a branded generic fromLiggett for 52% off the list price of a leading brand. See

App. 325-326, 685.It may be that a reasonable jury could conclude that the
cumulative discounts attributable to subgenerics and thevarious consumer promotions did not cancel out the full effect of the increases in list prices, see id., at 508-509, andthat actual prices to the consumer did indeed rise, but rising
prices do not themselves permit an inference of a collusivemarket dynamic. Even in a concentrated market, the occurrence of a price increase does not in itself permit a rationalinference of conscious parallelism or supracompetitive pricing. Where, as here, output is expanding at the same timeprices are increasing, rising prices are equally consistent
with growing product demand. Under these conditions, ajury may not infer competitive injury from price and output
data absent some evidence that tends to prove that outputwas restricted or prices were above a competitive level. Cf.
Monsanto, 465 U. S., at 763.Quite apart from the absence of any evidence of that sort,
an inference of supracompetitive pricing would be particu-larly anomalous in this case, as the very party alleged to
have been coerced into pricing through oligopolistic coordi-nation denied that such coordination existed: Liggett's own
officers and directors consistently denied that they or otherfirms in the industry priced their cigarettes through tacit
collusion or reaped supracompetitive profits. App. 394-399,623-631; 11 Tr. 170-174, 64 Tr. 51-56. Liggett seeks to explain away this testimony by arguing that its officers anddirectors are businesspeople who do not ascribe the same
meaning to words like "competitive" and "collusion" that aneconomist would. This explanation is entitled to little, if
any, weight. As the District Court found:

"This argument was considered at the summary judg-ment stage since these executives gave basically the

same testimony at their depositions. The court allowed

the case to go to trial in part because the Liggett execu-tives were not economists and in part because of affidavits from the Liggett executives stating that they wereconfused by the questions asked by B[rown] & W[illiamson] lawyers and did not mean to contradict the testi-mony of [their economic expert] Burnett. However, at
trial, despite having consulted extensively with Burnettand having had adequate time to familiarize themselves
with concepts such as tacit collusion, oligopoly, andmonopoly profits, these Liggett executives again contradicted Burnett's theory." 748 F. Supp., at 356.

Not only does the evidence fail to show actual supracom-petitive pricing in the generic segment, it also does not demonstrate its likelihood. At the time Brown & Williamsonentered the generic segment, the cigarette industry as a
whole faced declining demand and possessed substantial ex-cess capacity. App. 82-84. These circumstances tend to
break down patterns of oligopoly pricing and produce pricecompetition. See Scherer & Ross 294, 315; 2 Areeda &
Turner || 404b2, at 275-276; 6 P. Areeda, Antitrust Law|| 1430e, p. 181 (1986). The only means by which Brown &
Williamson is alleged to have established oligopoly pricing inthe face of these unusual competitive pressures is through
tacit price coordination with the other cigarette firms.Yet the situation facing the cigarette companies in the
1980's would have made such tacit coordination unmanage-able. Tacit coordination is facilitated by a stable market
environment, fungible products, and a small number of vari-ables upon which the firms seeking to coordinate their pricing may focus. See generally Scherer & Ross 215-315; 6 P.Areeda,

supra, |||| 1428-1430. Uncertainty is an oligopoly'sgreatest enemy. By 1984, however, the cigarette market

was in an obvious state of flux. The introduction of genericcigarettes in 1980 represented the first serious price com509us1u104 05-04-97 17:18:22 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
petition in the cigarette market since the 1930's. SeeScherer & Ross 250-251; App. 128. This development was

bound to unsettle previous expectations and patterns of mar-ket conduct and to reduce the cigarette firms' ability to predict each other's behavior.

The larger number of product types and pricing variablesalso decreased the probability of effective parallel pricing.

When Brown & Williamson entered the economy segment in1984, the segment included Value-25s, black and whites, and
branded generics. With respect to each product, the netprice in the market was determined not only by list prices,
but also by a wide variety of discounts and promotions to
consumers and by rebates to wholesalers. In order to coordinate in an effective manner and eliminate price competition, the cigarette companies would have been required,
without communicating, to establish parallel practices with
respect to each of these variables, many of which, like consumer stickers or coupons, were difficult to monitor. Liggett has not even alleged parallel behavior with respect to
these other variables, and the inherent limitations of tacit
collusion suggest that such multivariable coordination is
improbable. See R. Dorfman, The Price System 99-100,
and n. 10 (1964); Scherer & Ross 279.

In addition, R. J. Reynolds had incentives that, in some
respects, ran counter to those of the other cigarette companies. It is implausible that without a shared interest in retarding the growth of the economy segment, Brown & Williamson and its fellow oligopolists could have engaged in
parallel pricing and raised generic prices above a competitive
level. "[C]oordination will not be possible when any significant firm chooses, for any reason, to `go it alone.' " 2
Areeda & Turner || 404b2, at 276. It is undisputed--indeed
it was conceded by Liggett's expert--that R. J. Reynolds
acted without regard to the supposed benefits of oligopolistic
coordination when it repriced Doral at generic levels in the
spring of 1984 and that the natural and probable consequence

240 BROOKE GROUP LTD. v. BROWN & WILLIAMSON

TOBACCO CORP.

Opinion of the Court

of its entry into the generic segment was procompetitive.55 Tr. 15-16; 51 Tr. 128. Indeed, Reynolds' apparent objective in entering the segment was to capture a significantamount of volume in order to regain its number one sales
position in the cigarette industry from Philip Morris. App.
75, 130, 209-211. There is no evidence that R. J. Reynoldsaccomplished this goal during the period relevant to this

case, or that its commitment to achieving that goal changed.Indeed, R. J. Reynolds refused to follow Brown & Williamson's attempt to raise generic prices in June 1985. The jurythus had before it undisputed evidence that contradicts the
suggestion that the major cigarette companies shared a goal
of limiting the growth of the economy segment; one of the
industry's two major players concededly entered the segment to expand volume and compete.

Even if all the cigarette companies were willing to participate in a scheme to restrain the growth of the generic
segment, they would not have been able to coordinate their
actions and raise prices above a competitive level unless they
understood that Brown & Williamson's entry into the segment was not a genuine effort to compete with Liggett. If
even one other firm misinterpreted Brown & Williamson's
entry as an effort to expand share, a chain reaction of competitive responses would almost certainly have resulted, and
oligopoly discipline would have broken down, perhaps irretrievably. "[O]nce the trust among rivals breaks down, it is
as hard to put back together again as was Humpty-Dumpty,
and non-collusive behavior is likely to take over." Samuelson & Nordhaus, Economics, at 534.

Liggett argues that the means by which Brown & Williamson signaled its anticompetitive intent to its rivals was
through its pricing structure. According to Liggett, maintaining existing list prices while offering substantial rebates
to wholesalers was a signal to the other cigarette firms that
Brown & Williamson did not intend to attract additional
smokers to the generic segment by its entry. But a reason509us1u104 05-04-97 17:18:22 PAGES OPINPGT

241Cite as: 509 U. S. 209 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
able jury could not conclude that this pricing structure elimi-nated or rendered insignificant the risk that the other firms

might misunderstand Brown & Williamson's entry as a com-petitive move. The likelihood that Brown & Williamson's
rivals would have regarded its pricing structure as an important signal is low, given that Liggett itself, the purportedtarget of the predation, was already using similar rebates,

as was R. J. Reynolds in marketing its Doral branded ge-neric. A Reynolds executive responsible for Doral testified
that given its and Liggett's use of wholesaler rebates,Brown & Williamson could not have competed effectively
without them. App. 756. And despite extensive discovery
of the corporate records of R. J. Reynolds and Philip Morris,
no documents appeared that indicated any awareness of
Brown & Williamson's supposed signal by its principal rivals.
Without effective signaling, it is difficult to see how the
alleged predation could have had a reasonable chance of
success through oligopoly pricing.

Finally, although some of Brown & Williamson's corporate
planning documents speak of a desire to slow the growth of
the segment, no objective evidence of its conduct permits a
reasonable inference that it had any real prospect of doing so
through anticompetitive means. It is undisputed that when
Brown & Williamson introduced its generic cigarettes, it offered them to a thousand wholesalers who had never before
purchased generic cigarettes. Record, Plaintiff 's Exh. No.
4079; 87 Tr. 191; 88 Tr. 143-147. The inevitable effect of
this marketing effort was to expand the segment, as the new
wholesalers recruited retail outlets to carry generic cigarettes. Even with respect to wholesalers already carrying
generics, Brown & Williamson's unprecedented volume rebates had a similar expansionary effect. Unlike many
branded cigarettes, generics came with no sales guarantee
to the wholesaler; any unsold stock represented pure loss
to the wholesaler. By providing substantial incentives for
wholesalers to place large orders, Brown & Williamson cre509us1u104 05-04-97 17:18:22 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court

ated strong pressure for them to sell more generic cigarettes.In addition, as we have already observed, see

supra, at 236,
many wholesalers passed portions of the rebates about whichLiggett complains on to consumers, thus dropping the retail

price of generics and further stimulating demand. Brown &
Williamson provided a further, direct stimulus, through some$10 million it spent during the period of alleged predation

placing discount stickers on its generic cartons to reduceprices to the ultimate consumer. 70 Tr. 246. In light of
these uncontested facts about Brown & Williamson's con-duct, it is not reasonable to conclude that Brown & Williamson threatened in a serious way to restrict output, raise
prices above a competitive level, and artificially slow the
growth of the economy segment of the national cigarette
market.

To be sure, Liggett's economic expert explained Liggett's
theory of predatory price discrimination and testified that
he believed it created a reasonable possibility that Brown
& Williamson could injure competition in the United States
cigarette market as a whole. App. 600-614. But this does
not alter our analysis. When an expert opinion is not supported by sufficient facts to validate it in the eyes of the law,
or when indisputable record facts contradict or otherwise
render the opinion unreasonable, it cannot support a jury's
verdict. Cf. J. Truett Payne Co., Inc., 451 U. S., at 564-565
(referring to expert economic testimony not based on "documentary evidence as to the effect of the discrimination on
retail prices" as "weak" at best). Expert testimony is useful
as a guide to interpreting market facts, but it is not a substitute for them. As we observed in Matsushita, "expert opinion evidence . . . has little probative value in comparison with
the economic factors" that may dictate a particular conclusion. 475 U. S., at 594, n. 19. Here, Liggett's expert based
his opinion that Brown & Williamson had a reasonable prospect of recouping its predatory losses on three factors:
Brown & Williamson's black and white pricing structure, cor509us1u104 05-04-97 17:18:22 PAGES OPINPGT

Stevens, J., dissenting
porate documents showing an intent to shrink the price dif-ferential between generic and branded cigarettes, and evidence of below-cost pricing. App. 601-602. Because, as wehave explained, this evidence is insufficient as a matter of
law to support a finding of primary-line injury under theRobinson-Patman Act, the expert testimony cannot sustain
the jury's verdict. IV

We understand that the chain of reasoning by which wehave concluded that Brown & Williamson is entitled to judgment as a matter of law is demanding. But a reasonablejury is presumed to know and understand the law, the facts
of the case, and the realities of the market. We hold thatthe evidence cannot support a finding that Brown & Williamson's alleged scheme was likely to result in oligopolistic pricecoordination and sustained supracompetitive pricing in the
generic segment of the national cigarette market. Withoutthis, Brown & Williamson had no reasonable prospect of recouping its predatory losses and could not inflict the injuryto competition the antitrust laws prohibit. The judgment of
the Court of Appeals is Affirmed.

day trial, the jury agreed, and awarded Liggett substantial
damages. The Court of Appeals, however, found that Liggett could not succeed on its claim, because B&W, as an independent actor controlling only 12% of the national cigarette
market, could not injure competition. Liggett Group, Inc. v.
Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 964 F. 2d 335, 340-342

Today, the Court properly rejects that holding. See ante,

Appeals to resolve the other issues raised by the parties,
however, the Court goes on to review portions of the voluminous trial record, and comes to the conclusion that the evidence does not support the jury's finding that B&W's price

to support that finding.

or knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination, or with customers of either of them . . . ." 15 U. S. C. $ 13(a).

2 The jury gave an affirmative answer to the following special issue:

"1. Did Brown & Williamson engage in price discrimination that had a
reasonable possibility of injuring competition in the cigarette market as a
whole in the United States?" App. 27.

The jury made its finding after being instructed that "injury to competition" means "the injury to consumer welfare which results when a competitor is able to raise and to maintain prices in a market or well-defined
submarket above competitive levels. In order to injure competition in
the cigarette market as a whole, Brown & Williamson must be able to
create a real possibility of both driving out rivals by loss-creating price
cutting and then holding on to that advantage to recoup losses by raising
and maintaining prices at higher than competitive levels.

"You must remember that the Robinson-Patman Act was designed to
protect competition rather than just competitors and, therefore, injury to
competition does not mean injury to a competitor. Liggett & Myers can
not satisfy this element simply by showing that they were injured by
Brown & Williamson's conduct. To satisfy this element, Liggett & Myers
must show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Brown & Williamson's
conduct had a reasonable possibility of injuring competition in the cigarette market and not just a reasonable possibility of injuring a competitor
in the cigarette market." Id., at 829-830.

The fact that a price war may not have accomplished itspurpose as quickly or as completely as originally intended

does not immunize conduct that was illegal when it occurred.A proper understanding of this case therefore requires a

Background

B&W is the third largest firm in a highly concentratedindustry.

Ante, at 213. For decades, the industry has beenmarked by the same kind of supracompetitive pricing that is

characteristic of the textbook monopoly.4 Without the ne-cessity of actual agreement among the six major manufacturers, "prices for cigarettes increased in lockstep, twice a year,for a number of years, irrespective of the rate of inflation,
changes in the costs of production, or shifts in consumer de-mand."

Ibid. Notwithstanding the controversy over thehealth effects of smoking and the increase in the federal excise tax, profit margins improved "handsomely" during theperiod between 1972 and 1983.

3 As the majority notes, the procedural posture of this case requires that
we view the evidence in the light most favorable to Liggett. Ante, at
213. On review of a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, the party
against whom the judgment is entered "must be given the benefit of every
legitimate inference that can be drawn from the evidence." See C.
Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure $ 2528, pp. 563-564
(1971).

4 When the Court states that "[s]ubstantial evidence suggests that in

recent decades, the industry reaped the benefits of prices above a competitive level," ante, at 213, I assume it accepts the proposition that a reasonable jury could find abnormally high prices characteristic of this industry.

5 An internal B&W memorandum, dated May 15, 1984, states in part:

"Manufacturer's price increases generally were below the rate of inflation but margins improved handsomely due to favorable leaf prices and

Stevens, J., dissenting

The early 1980's brought two new developments to the cigarette market. First, in 1980, when its share of the market
had declined to 2.3%, Liggett introduced a new line of generic cigarettes in plain black and white packages, offered at
an effective price of approximately 30% less than branded
cigarettes. Ante, at 214. A B&W memorandum described
this action as "the first time that a [cigarette] manufacturer
has used pricing as a strategic marketing weapon in the U. S.
since the depression era." App. 128. This novel tactic
proved successful; by 1984, Liggett's black and whites represented about 4% of the total market and generated substantial profits. The next development came in 1984, when R. J.
Reynolds (RJR), the second largest company in the industry,
"repositioned" one of its established brands, Doral, by selling
it at discount prices comparable to Liggett's black and
whites. App. 117-118; ante, at 215.

B&W executives prepared a number of internal memoranda planning responses to these two market developments.
See App. 120, 127, 157, 166. With respect to RJR, B&W
decided to "follo[w] precisely the pathway" of that company,
id., at 121, reasoning that "introduction of a branded generic
by B&W now appears to be feasible as RJR has the clout
and sales force coverage to maintain the price on branded
generics," id., at 145. Accordingly, B&W planned to introduce a new "branded generic" of its own, known as Hallmark, to be sold at the same prices as RJR's Doral. Id., at
124, 142-144.

cost reductions associated with automation. For example, Brown & Williamson's variable margin increased from $2.91/M in 1972 to $8.78/M in
1981, an increase of over 200%. In 1982, the industry became much more
aggressive on the pricing front, fueled by a 100% increase in the Federal
Excise Tax. Brown & Williamson's variable margin increased from
$10.78/M in 1982 and [sic] to $12.61/M in 1983.

"The impact of these pricing activities on the smoking public was dramatic. The weighted average retail price of a pack of cigarettes increased
56% between 1980 and 1983 (from $.63 to $.98)." App. 127.

B&W took a more aggressive approach to Liggett's blackand whites. It decided to launch its own line of black and

white cigarettes with the "[s]ame style array" and list priceas Liggett's, but with "[s]uperior discounts/allowances."
Id., at 124. B&W estimated that its own black and whites
would generate a "trading profit" of $5.1 million for the sec-ond half of 1984 and $43.6 million for 1985.

Id., at 125. At
the same time, however, B&W, anticipating "competitivecounterattacks," was "prepared to redistribute this entire

amount in the form of additional trade allowances." Ibid.B&W's competitive stance was confined to Liggett; the memorandum outlining B&W's plans made no reference to the
possibility of countermoves by RJR, or to the use of B&W's
trading profits to increase allowances on any product other
than black and whites.

This "dual approach" was designed to "provide B&W more
influence to manage up the prices of branded generics to improve profitability," id., at 123, and also the opportunity to
participate in the economy market, with a view toward
"manag[ing] down generic volume," id., at 109. Notwithstanding its ultimate aim to "limit generic segment growth,"
id., at 113, B&W estimated an aggregate potential trading
profit on black and whites of $342 million for 1984 to 1988,
id., at 146. Though B&W recognized that it might be required to use "some or all of this potential trading profit" to
maintain its market position, it also believed that it would
recoup its losses as the segment became "more profitable,
particularly as it approaches maturity." Ibid.

B&W began to implement its plan even before it made its
first shipment of black and whites in July 1984, with a series
of price announcements in June of that year. When B&W
announced its first volume discount schedule for distributors,
Liggett responded by increasing its own discounts. Though
Liggett's discounts remained lower than B&W's, B&W responded in turn by increasing its rebates still further.
After four or five moves and countermoves, the dust settled

with B&W's net prices to distributors lower than Liggett's.6
B&W's deep discounts not only forfeited all of its $48.7 million in projected trading profits for the next 18 months, but
actually resulted in sales below B&W's average variable
cost. Id., at 338-339.

Assessing the pre-July 1984 evidence tending to prove that
B&W was motivated by anticompetitive intent, the District
Court observed that the documentary evidence was "more
voluminous and detailed than any other reported case. This
evidence not only indicates B&W wanted to injure Liggett,
it also details an extensive plan to slow the growth of

the generic cigarette segment." Liggett Group, Inc. v.

The volume rebates offered by B&W to its wholesalers
during the 18-month period from July 1984 to December 1985
unquestionably constituted price discrimination covered by

$ 2(a) of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 730, as amended by the
Robinson-Patman Act, 49 Stat. 1526, 15 U. S. C. $ 13(a).7
Nor were the discounts justified by any statutory or affirmative defense: They were not cost justified,8 App. 525, were

6 On June 4, 1984, B&W announced a maximum rebate of $0.30 per carton for purchases of over 8,000 cases per quarter; a week later, Liggett
announced a rebate of $0.20 on comparable volumes. On June 21, B&W
increased its rebate to $0.50, and a day later, Liggett went to $0.43. After
three more increases, B&W settled at $0.80 per carton, while Liggett remained at $0.73. See App. 327, 420-421.

7 That quantity discounts are covered by the Act, and prohibited when

they have the requisite effect on competition, has been firmly established
since our decision in FTC v. Morton Salt Co., 334 U. S. 37, 42-44 (1948).

which make only due allowance for differences in the cost of manufacture,
sale, or delivery resulting from the differing methods or quantities in
which such commodities are to such purchasers sold or delivered."

not good-faith efforts to meet the equally low price of a com-petitor,

9 and were not mere introductory or promotional discounts, 91 Tr. 42.The rebate program was intended to harm Liggett and in

fact caused it serious injury.10 The jury found that Liggetthad suffered actual damages of $49.6 million, App. 28, an
amount close to, but slightly larger than, the $48.7 million
trading profit B&W had indicated it would forgo in order todiscipline Liggett. See

supra, at 247. To inflict this injury,
B&W sustained a substantial loss. During the full 18-monthperiod, B&W's revenues ran consistently below its total variable costs, with an average deficiency of approximately $0.30per carton and a total loss on B&W black and whites of almost $15 million. App. 338-339. That B&W executiveswere willing to accept losses of this magnitude during the
entire 18 months is powerful evidence of their belief that
prices ultimately could be "managed up" to a level that wouldallow B&W to recoup its investment.

The Aftermath

At the end of 1985, the list price of branded cigarettes was
$33.15 per carton, and the list price of black and whites,
$19.75 per carton. App. 325. Over the next four years, the
list price on both branded and black and white cigarettes

9 "Provided, however, That nothing herein contained shall prevent a
seller rebutting the prima-facie case thus made by showing that his lower
price or the furnishing of services or facilities to any purchaser or purchasers was made in good faith to meet an equally low price of a competitor,
or the services or facilities furnished by a competitor." $ 13(b).

The jury gave a negative answer to the following special issue:
"3. Did Brown & Williamson engage in price discrimination in good
faith with the intention to meet, but not beat, the equally low net prices
of Liggett Group, Inc.?" App. 27-28.

10 By offering its largest discounts to Liggett's 14 largest customers,

App. 168-169, 174, B&W not only put its "money where the volume is,"
id., at 402, but also applied maximum pressure to Liggett at a lesser cost
to itself than would have resulted from a nondiscriminatory price cut.

increased twice a year, by identical amounts. The June 1989increases brought the price of branded cigarettes to $46.15

per carton, and the price of black and whites to $33.75--anamount even higher than the price for branded cigarettes
when the war ended in December 1985. Ibid.11 Becausethe rate of increase was higher on black and whites than
on brandeds, the price differential between the two types ofcigarettes narrowed,

ibid., from roughly 40% in 1985 to 27%in 1989. See 964 F. 2d, at 338.

The expert economist employed by Liggett testified thatthe post-1985 price increases were unwarranted by increases
in manufacturing or other costs, taxes, or promotional ex-penditures. App. 525. To be sure, some portion of the volume rebates granted distributors was passed on to consum-ers in the form of promotional activity, so that consumers did
not feel the full brunt of the price increases. Nevertheless,the record amply supports the conclusion that the post-1985
price increases in list prices produced higher consumerprices, as well as higher profits for the manufacturers.

12

The legal question presented by this evidence is whetherthe facts as they existed during and at the close of the 18-

month period, and all reasonable inferences to be drawn from

11 It is also true that these same years, other major manufacturers entered the generic market and expanded their generic sales. Ante, at 217.
Their entry is entirely consistent with the possibility that lockstep increases in the price of generics brought them to a level that was supracompetitive, though lower than that charged on branded cigarettes.

12 "Q Does this mean that the price increases, which you testified are

happening twice a year, are used up in these consumer promotions?

"A Not by any stretch of the imagination. Although there has been an
increase in the use of this type of promotional activity over the last four
or five years, the increase in that promotional activity has been far outstripped by the list price increases. The prices go up by a lot; the promotional activity, indeed, does go up. But the promotional activity has not
gone up by anywhere near the magnitude of the list price increases. Further, those price increases are not warranted by increasing costs, since
the manufacturing costs of making cigarettes have remained roughly constant over the last five years." App. 509.

those facts, see n. 3, supra, justified the finding by the jurythat B&W's discriminatory pricing campaign "had a reasonable possibility of injuring competition," see supra, at 244,and n. 2.

II
The Sherman Act, 26 Stat. 209, enacted in 1890, the Clay-ton Act, 38 Stat. 730, enacted in 1914, and the RobinsonPatman Act, which amended the Clayton Act in 1936, allserve the purpose of protecting competition. Because they
have a common goal, the statutes are similar in many re-spects. All three prohibit the predatory practice of deliberately selling below cost to discipline a competitor, either todrive the competitor out of business or to raise prices to a
level that will enable the predator to recover its losses and,in the long run, earn additional profits. Sales below cost

and anticompetitive intent are elements of the violation ofall three statutes. Neither of those elements, however, is at
issue in this case. See ante, at 231 (record contains sufficientevidence of anticompetitive intent and below-cost pricing).

The statutes do differ significantly with respect to one ele-ment of the violation, the competitive consequences of predatory conduct. Even here, however, the three statutes haveone thing in common: Not one of them requires proof that a
predatory plan has actually succeeded in accomplishing itsobjective. Section 1 of the Sherman Act requires proof of a
conspiracy. It is the joint plan to restrain trade, however,and not its success, that is prohibited by $ 1. Nash v. United
States, 229 U. S. 373, 378 (1913). Section 2 of the ShermanAct applies to independent conduct, and may be violated
when there is a "dangerous probability" that an attempt toachieve monopoly power will succeed.

Swift & Co. v. UnitedStates, 196 U. S. 375, 396 (1905). The Clayton Act goes beyond the "dangerous probability" standard to cover pricediscrimination "where the effect of such discrimination may
be to substantially lessen competition or tend to create amonopoly in any line of commerce." $ 2, 38 Stat. 730.

The element of competitive injury as defined in the
Robinson-Patman Act is broader still.13 See S. Rep. No.
1502, 74th Cong., 2d Sess., 4 (1936) (Act substantially broadens similar clause of Clayton Act).14 The Robinson-Patman
Act was designed to reach discriminations "in their incipiency, before the harm to competition is effected. It is
enough that they `may' have the prescribed effect." Corn
Products Refining Co. v. FTC, 324 U. S. 726, 738 (1945) (internal quotation marks omitted). Or, as the Report of the
Senate Judiciary Committee on the proposed Act explained,
"to catch the weed in the seed will keep it from coming to
flower." S. Rep. No. 1502, at 4.

Accordingly, our leading case concerning discriminatory
volume rebates described the scope of the Act as follows:

13 See text of statute, n. 1, supra.
14 One of the purposes of broadening the Clayton Act's competitive injury language in the Robinson-Patman Act was to provide more effective
protection against predatory price cutting. As the Attorney General's
National Committee to Study the Antitrust Laws explained in its 1955
report:

"In some circumstances, to be sure, injury to even a single competitor
should bring the Act into play. Predatory price cutting designed to eliminate a smaller business rival, for example, is a practice which inevitably
frustrates competition by excluding competitors from the market or deliberately impairing their competitive strength. The invalidation of such
deliberate price slashes for the purpose of destroying even a single competitor, moreover, accords distinct recognition to the narrower tests of
`injury' added to the price discrimination provisions of the Clayton Act
through the 1936 Robinson-Patman amendments. The discrimination
provisions in the original Clayton Act were feared by the legislators as
inadequate to check the victimization of individual businessmen by predatory price cuts that nevertheless created no general impairment of competitive conditions in a wider market. To reach such destructive price
cuts endangering the survival of smaller rivals of a powerful seller was an
express objective of the liberalizing amendments in the `injury' clause of
the Robinson-Patman Act." Report of the Attorney General's National
Committee to Study the Antitrust Laws 165-166 (1955) (footnotes
omitted).

"There are specific findings that such injuries had re-sulted from respondent's discounts, although the statute

does not require the Commission to find that injury hasactually resulted. The statute requires no more than
that the effect of the prohibited price discriminations`may be substantially to lessen competition . . . or to
injure, destroy, or prevent competition.' After a care-ful consideration of this provision of the RobinsonPatman Act, we have said that `the statute does not re-quire that the discrimination must in fact have harmed
competition, but only that there is a reasonable possibil-ity that they "may" have such an effect.'

Corn Products Co. v. Federal Trade Comm'n, 324 U. S. 726, 742."FTC v. Morton Salt Co., 334 U. S. 37, 46 (1948).

See also Falls City Industries, Inc. v. Vanco Beverage, Inc.,460 U. S. 428, 435 (1983) ("In keeping with the RobinsonPatman Act's prophylactic purpose, $ 2(a) does not requirethat the discriminations must in fact have harmed competition" (internal quotation marks omitted)).In this case, then, Liggett need not show any actual harm
to competition, but only the reasonable possibility that suchharm would flow from B&W's conduct. The evidence presented supports the conclusion that B&W's price war wasintended to discipline Liggett for its unprecedented use of
price competition in an industry that had enjoyed handsomesupracompetitive profits for about half a century. The evidence also demonstrates that B&W executives were confi-dent enough in the feasibility of their plan that they were
willing to invest millions of company dollars in its outcome.And all of this, of course, must be viewed against a background of supracompetitive, parallel pricing, in which "pricesfor cigarettes increased in lockstep, twice a year . . . irrespective of the rate of inflation, changes in the cost of production,or shifts in consumer demand," ante, at 213, bringing with
them dramatic increases in profit margins, see n. 5, supra.In this context, it is surely fair to infer that B&W's discipli509us1u104 05-04-97 17:18:23 PAGES OPINPGT

nary program had a reasonable prospect of persuading Lig-gett to forgo its maverick price reductions and return to parallel pricing policies, and thus to restore the same kind ofsupracompetitive pricing that had characterized the industry
in the past. When the facts are viewed in the light mostfavorable to Liggett, I think it clear that there is sufficient
evidence in the record that the "reasonable possibility" ofcompetitive injury required by the statute actually existed.

III
After 115 days of trial, during which it considered 2,884exhibits, 85 deposition excerpts, and testimony from 23 live

witnesses, the jury deliberated for nine days and then re-turned a verdict finding that B&W engaged in price discrimination with a "reasonable possibility of injuring competi-tion." 748 F. Supp., at 348, n. 4; n. 2,

supra. The Court'scontrary conclusion rests on a hodgepodge of legal, factual,

and economic propositions that are insufficient, alone or to-gether, to overcome the jury's assessment of the evidence.

First, as a matter of law, the Court reminds us that theRobinson-Patman Act is concerned with consumer welfare
and competition, as opposed to protecting individual compet-itors from harm; "the antitrust laws were passed for the protection of competition, not competitors." See ante, at 224(internal quotations marks and emphasis omitted). For that
reason, predatory price cutting is not unlawful unless thepredator has a reasonable prospect of recouping his investment from supracompetitive profits. Ibid. The jury, ofcourse, was so instructed, see n. 2, supra, and no one questions that proposition here.As a matter of fact, the Court emphasizes the growth in
the generic segment following B&W's entry. As the Courtnotes, generics' expansion to over 12% of the total market
by 1988 exceeds B&W's own forecast that the segment wouldgrow to only about 10%, assuming no entry by B&W.

Ante,at 234. What these figures do not do, however, is answer the

relevant question: whether the prices of generic cigarettesduring the late 1980's were competitive or supracompetitive.

On this point, there is ample, uncontradicted evidence thatthe list prices on generic cigarettes, as well as the prices on
branded cigarettes, rose regularly and significantly duringthe late 1980's, in a fashion remarkably similar to the price
change patterns that characterized the industry in the 1970'swhen supracompetitive, oligopolistic pricing admittedly prevailed. See supra, at 245; ante, at 213. Given its knowl-edge of the industry's history of parallel pricing, I think the
jury plainly was entitled to draw an inference that these in-creased prices were supracompetitive.

The Court responds to this evidence dismissively, suggest-ing that list prices have no bearing on the question because
promotional activities of the cigarette manufacturers mayhave offset such price increases. Ante, at 235-236. That
response is insufficient for three reasons. First, the promo-tions to which the majority refers related primarily to
branded cigarettes; accordingly, while they narrowed the dif-ferential between branded prices and black and white prices,
they did not reduce the consumer price of black and whites.See 33 Tr. 208-210. Second, the Court's speculation is inconsistent with record evidence that the semiannual listprice increases were not offset by consumer promotions.
See n. 12, supra. See also ante, at 218 ("at least some por-tion of the list price increase was reflected in a higher net
price to the consumer"). Finally, to the extent there is adispute regarding the effect of promotional activities on consumer prices for generics, the jury presumably resolved thatdispute in Liggett's favor, and the Court's contrary speculation is an insufficient basis for setting aside that verdict.15

15 In finding an absence of actual supracompetitive pricing, the Court
also relies on the testimony of Liggett executives, who stated that industry prices were fair. Illustrative is the following exchange:

"Q I want to know--yes or no--sir, whether or not you say that the
price you charged for branded cigarettes, which is the same price you say

Stevens, J., dissenting

As a matter of economics, the Court reminds us that pricecutting is generally procompetitive, and hence a "boon to

consumers." Ante, at 224. This is true, however, onlyso long as reduced prices do not fall below cost, as the
cases cited by the majority make clear.16 When a predator
deliberately engages in below-cost pricing targeted at a particular competitor over a sustained period of time, then
price cutting raises a credible inference that harm to compeeverybody else charged, was a fair and equitable price for that product to
the American consumer.

"A It's what the industry set, and based on that it's a fair price."
App. 396.

The problem with this testimony, and testimony like it, is that it relates
to the period before the price war, as well as after, see id., at 392, when
there is no real dispute but that prices were supracompetitive. ("[T]he
profits in the cigarette industry are the best of any industry I've been
associated with, very much so." Ibid.) Some of the testimony cited by
the Court, for instance, is that of an outside director who served only from
1977 or 1978 until 1980, see 64 Tr. 51-56, cited ante, at 237; his belief in the
competitiveness of his industry must be viewed against the "[s]ubstantial
evidence suggest[ing] that in recent decades, the industry reaped the benefits of prices above a competitive level" to which the majority itself refers,
ante, at 213.

The jury was, of course, entitled to discount the probative force of testimony from executives to the effect that there was no collusion among
tobacco manufacturers, App. 397-398, and that they had appeared before
a congressional committee to vouch for the competitive nature of their
industry, id., at 623-631. The jury was also free to give greater weight
to the documentary evidence presented, the inferences to be drawn therefrom, and the testimony of experts who agreed with the textbook characterization of the industry. See App. 640-645; R. Tennant, American Cigarette Industry 342 (1950).

16 In Atlantic Richfield Co. v. USA Petroleum Co., 495 U. S. 328, 339-340

(1990), for example, we noted that low prices benefit consumers "so long
as they are above predatory levels." In Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colorado, Inc., 479 U. S. 104, 118 (1986), we recognized that price cutting of a
predatory nature is "inimical" to competition, and limited our approving
comments to pricing that is "above some measure of incremental costs."

tition is likely to ensue.17 None of our cases disputes thatproposition.

Also as a matter of economics, the Court insists that apredatory pricing program in an oligopoly is unlikely to succeed absent actual conspiracy. Though it has rejected asomewhat stronger version of this proposition as a rule of
decision, see ante, at 229-230, the Court comes back to thesame economic theory, relying on the supposition that an "anticompetitive minuet is most difficult to compose and to per-form, even for a disciplined oligopoly,"

ante, at 228. Seeante, at 238-243 (implausibility of tacit coordination among

cigarette oligopolists in 1980's). I would suppose, however,that the professional performers who had danced the minuet
for 40 to 50 years would be better able to predict whethertheir favorite partners would follow them in the future than
would an outsider, who might not know the difference be-tween Haydn and Mozart.

surely entitled to infer that at the time of the price war itself,B&W reasonably believed that it could signal its intentions

to its fellow oligopolists, see App. 61, assuring their contin-ued cooperation.

Perhaps the Court's most significant error is the assump-tion that seems to pervade much of the final sections of its
opinion: that Liggett had the burden of proving either theactuality of supracompetitive pricing, or the actuality of tacit
collusion. See ante, at 233-237 (finding absence of actualsupracompetitive pricing), 238-243 (finding absence of evidence suggesting actual coordination). In my opinion, thejury was entitled to infer from the succession of price increases after 1985--when the prices for branded and genericcigarettes increased every six months from $33.15 and $19.75,
respectively, to $46.15 and $33.75--that B&W's below-costpricing actually produced supracompetitive prices, with the
help of tacit collusion among the players. See supra, at 255.But even if that were not so clear, the jury would surely be
entitled to infer that B&W's predatory plan, in which itinvested millions of dollars for the purpose of achieving an
admittedly anticompetitive result, carried a "reasonablepossibility" of injuring competition.

Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.

BUCKLEY v. FITZSIMMONS et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe seventh circuit

No. 91-7849. Argued February 22, 1993--Decided June 24, 1993
Petitioner Buckley sought damages, under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, from respondent prosecutors for fabricating evidence during the preliminary
investigation of a highly publicized rape and murder in Illinois and making false statements at a press conference announcing the return of an
indictment against him. He claimed that when three separate lab studies failed to make a reliable connection between a bootprint at the murder site and his boots, respondents obtained a positive identification
from one Robbins, who allegedly was known for her willingness to fabricate unreliable expert testimony. Thereafter, they convened a grand
jury for the sole purpose of investigating the murder, and 10 months
later, respondent Fitzsimmons, the State's Attorney, announced the indictment at the news conference. Buckley was arrested and, unable to
meet the bond, held in jail. Robbins provided the principal evidence
against him at trial, but the jury was unable to reach a verdict. When
Robbins died before Buckley's retrial, all charges were dropped and he
was released after three years of incarceration. In the $ 1983 action,
the District Court held that respondents were entitled to absolute immunity for the fabricated evidence claim but not for the press conference
claim. However, the Court of Appeals ruled that they had absolute
immunity on both claims, theorizing that prosecutors are entitled to absolute immunity when out-of-court acts cause injury only to the extent
a case proceeds in court, but are entitled only to qualified immunity if
the constitutional wrong is complete before the case begins. On remand from this Court, it found that nothing in Burns v. Reed, 500 U. S.
478--in which the Court held that prosecutors had absolute immunity
for their actions in participating in a probable-cause hearing but not in
giving advice to the police--undermined its initial holding.

Held: Respondents are not entitled to absolute immunity. Pp. 267-278.

(a) Certain immunities were so well established when $ 1983 was enacted that this Court presumes that Congress would have specifically
so provided had it wished to abolish them. Most public officials are
entitled only to qualified immunity. However, sometimes their actions
fit within a common-law tradition of absolute immunity. Whether they
do is determined by the nature of the function performed, not the identity of the actor who performed it, Forrester v. White, 484 U. S. 219, 229,

and it is available for conduct of prosecutors that is "intimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process." Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U. S. 409, 430. Pp. 267-271.

(b) Acts undertaken by a prosecutor in preparing for the initiation of
judicial proceedings or for trial, and which occur in the course of his role
as an advocate for the State, are entitled to the protections of absolute
immunity. However, in endeavoring to determine whether the bootprint had been made by Buckley, respondents were acting not as advocates but as investigators searching for clues and corroboration that
might give them probable cause to recommend an arrest. Such activities were not immune from liability at common law. If performed by
police officers and detectives, such actions would be entitled to only
qualified immunity; the same immunity applies to prosecutors performing those actions. Convening a grand jury to consider the evidence
their work produced does not retroactively transform that work from
the administrative into the prosecutorial. Pp. 271-276.

(c) Fitzsimmons' statements to the media also are not entitled to absolute immunity. There was no common-law immunity for prosecutor's
out-of-court statements to the press, and, under Imbler, such comments
have no functional tie to the judicial process just because they are made
by a prosecutor. Nor do policy considerations support extending absolute immunity to press statements, since this Court has no license to
establish immunities from $ 1983 actions in the interests of what it
judges to be sound public policy, and since the presumption is that qualified, rather than absolute, immunity is sufficient to protect government
officials in the exercise of their duties. Pp. 276-278.

Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court.
In an action brought under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, petitionerseeks damages from respondent prosecutors for allegedly

fabricating evidence during the preliminary investigation ofa crime and making false statements at a press conference
announcing the return of an indictment. The questions pre-sented are whether respondents are absolutely immune from
liability on either or both of these claims.As the case comes to us, we have no occasion to consider
whether some or all of respondents' conduct may be pro-tected by qualified immunity. Moreover, we make two important assumptions about the case: first, that petitioner'sallegations are entirely true; and, second, that they allege
constitutional violations for which $ 1983 provides a remedy.Our statement of facts is therefore derived entirely from
petitioner's complaint and is limited to matters relevant torespondents' claim to absolute immunity.

Petitioner commenced this action on March 4, 1988, follow-ing his release from jail in Du Page County, Illinois. He had

been incarcerated there for three years on charges growing
out of the highly publicized murder of Jeanine Nicarico, an11-year-old child, on February 25, 1983. The complaint

named 17 defendants, including Du Page County, its sheriffand seven of his assistants, two expert witnesses and the
estate of a third, and the five respondents.Respondent Fitzsimmons was the duly elected Du Page
County State's Attorney from the time of the Nicarico

Opinion of the Court
murder through December 1984, when he was succeeded
by respondent Ryan, who had defeated him in a Republican
primary election on March 21, 1984. Respondent Knight
was an assistant state's attorney under Fitzsimmons and
served as a special prosecutor in the Nicarico case under
Ryan. Respondents Kilander (who came into office with
Ryan) and King were assistant prosecutors, also assigned to
the case.

The theory of petitioner's case is that in order to obtain
an indictment in a case that had engendered "extensive publicity" and "intense emotions in the community," the prosecutors fabricated false evidence, and that in order to gain votes,
Fitzsimmons made false statements about petitioner in a
press conference announcing his arrest and indictment 12
days before the primary election. Petitioner claims that
respondents' misconduct created a "highly prejudicial and
inflamed atmosphere" that seriously impaired the fairness of
the judicial proceedings against an innocent man and caused
him to suffer a serious loss of freedom, mental anguish, and
humiliation.

The fabricated evidence related to a bootprint on the door
of the Nicarico home apparently left by the killer when he
kicked in the door. After three separate studies by experts
from the Du Page County Crime Lab, the Illinois Department of Law Enforcement, and the Kansas Bureau of Identification, all of whom were unable to make a reliable connection between the print and a pair of boots that petitioner
had voluntarily supplied, respondents obtained a "positive
identification" from one Louise Robbins, an anthropologist in
North Carolina who was allegedly well known for her willingness to fabricate unreliable expert testimony. Her opinion was obtained during the early stages of the investigation,
which was being conducted under the joint supervision and
direction of the sheriff and respondent Fitzsimmons, whose

Opinion of the Court
police officers and assistant prosecutors were performingessentially the same investigatory functions.

Thereafter, having failed to obtain sufficient evidence tosupport petitioner's (or anyone else's) arrest, respondents

convened a special grand jury for the sole purpose of investi1 The relevant period and prosecutorial functions are described in petitioner's first amended complaint:

"28) Defendant Knight, and various others [sic] Defendants, including
Doria, Fitzsimmons, and Burandt, apparently not satisfied with Defendant
German's conclusions, contacted anthropologist Louise Robbins and Defendant Olsen of the Kansas Bureau of Indentification [sic] Crime Lab in
search of a positive boot identification.. . . . .

"31) Confronted with three different expert reports which failed to
match Plaintiff's boot with the footprint on the door, the Defendants, including Knight, Burandt, and German, procured their `positive identification' from Louise Robbins, whose theories and reputation in the forensic
community were generally discredited and viewed with great skepticism,
a fact these Defendants knew or should have known.

"32) Defendants Knight and King were involved with the Sheriff's police in all the early stages of their investigation, including the interrogation of witnesses and potential suspects. Specifically, Sheriff's detectives,
including defendants Wilkosz and Kurzawa, at the direction and under the
supervision, and sometimes in the presence and with the assistance of
Defendants Knight, King, Soucek and Lepic, repeatedly interrogated alleged suspects, including Plaintiff Buckley and Alex Hernandez, who were
not represented by counsel. Despite intense pressure and intimidation,
Plaintiff Buckley steadfastly maintained his innocence and demonstrated
no knowledge of the crime, while Hernandez told such wild and palpably
false stories that his mental instability was obvious to the Defendants.

"33) As a result of these interrogations, at least one experienced Sheriff's detective who participated[,] concluded that Buckley and Hernandez
were not involved in the Nicarico crime. This conclusion was buttressed
by his general knowledge of the bootprint `evidence.'

"34) He repeatedly communicated his conclusion, and its basis, to the
Defendants named herein, including Defendants Doria, Knight, King,
Soucek, Lepic, and Wilkosz.

"35) Unable to solve the case, Defendants Doria, Fitzsimmons, Knight
and King convened a special Du Page County `investigative' grand jury,
devoted solely to investigating the Nicarico case." App. 8-10.

Opinion of the Court
gating the Nicarico case. After an 8-month investigation,during which the grand jury heard the testimony of over 100

witnesses, including the bootprint experts, it was still unableto return an indictment. On January 27, 1984, respondent
Fitzsimmons admitted in a public statement that there wasinsufficient evidence to indict anyone for the rape and murder of Jeanine Nicarico. Although no additional evidencewas obtained in the interim, the indictment was returned in
March, when Fitzsimmons held the defamatory press confer-ence so shortly before the primary election. Petitioner was
then arrested, and because he was unable to meet the bond(set at $3 million), he was held in jail.

Petitioner's trial began 10 months later, in January 1985.The principal evidence against him was provided by Robbins, the North Carolina anthropologist. Because the jurywas unable to reach a verdict on the charges against petitioner, the trial judge declared a mistrial. Petitioner re-mained in prison for two more years, during which a third
party confessed to the crime and the prosecutors preparedfor petitioner's retrial. After Robbins died, however, all
charges against him were dropped. He was released, andfiled this action.

II
We are not concerned with petitioner's actions against thepolice officers (who have asserted the defense of qualified

immunity), against the expert witnesses (whose trial testi-mony was granted absolute immunity by the District Court,
App. 53-57), and against Du Page County (whose motion todismiss on other grounds was granted in part, id., at 57-61).
At issue here is only the action against the prosecutors, whomoved to dismiss based on their claim to absolute immunity.
The District Court held that respondents were entitled toabsolute immunity for all claims except the claim against
Fitzsimmons based on his press conference. Id., at 53.With respect to the claim based on the alleged fabrication of
evidence, the District Court framed the question as whether

509us2105K 05-04-97 17:29:14 PAGES OPINPGT

265Cite as: 509 U. S. 259 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
the effort "to obtain definitive boot evidence linking [peti-tioner to the crime] was in the nature of acquisition of

evidence or in the nature of evaluation of evidence for thepurpose of initiating the criminal process." Id., at 45.
The Court concluded that it "appears" that it was moreevaluative than acquisitive.

Both petitioner and Fitzsimmons appealed, and a dividedpanel of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit ruled
that the prosecutors had absolute immunity on both claims.
Buckley v. Fitzsimmons, 919 F. 2d 1230 (1990). In theCourt of Appeals' view, "damages remedies are unnecessary," id., at 1240, when "[c]ourts can curtail the costs ofprosecutorial blunders . . . by cutting short the prosecution
or mitigating its effects," id., at 1241. Thus, when "out-of-court acts cause injury only to the extent a case proceeds"
in court, id., at 1242, the prosecutor is entitled to absolute
immunity and "the defendant must look to the court in whichthe case pends to protect his interests,"

id., at 1241. By
contrast, if "a constitutional wrong is complete before the
case begins," the prosecutor is entitled only to qualified im-munity.

Id., at 1241-1242. Applying this unprecedented
theory to petitioner's allegations, the Court of Appeals con-cluded that neither the press conference nor the fabricated

evidence caused any constitutional injury independent of theindictment and trial.

Id., at 1243, 1244.2

2 With respect to an issue not before us, petitioner's claims that he was
subject to coercive interrogations by some of the respondent prosecutors,
the court found that the extent of immunity depended on the nature of
those claims. The court reasoned that, because claims based on Miranda
v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966), and the Self-Incrimination Clause of the
Fifth Amendment depend on what happens at trial, prosecutors are entitled to absolute immunity for those claims; by contrast, only qualified immunity is available against petitioner's claims as to "coercive tactics that
are independently wrongful." 919 F. 2d, at 1244. Because it could not
characterize the nature of those claims, the court remanded for further
proceedings concerning Fitzsimmons, King, and Knight on this issue. Id.,
at 1245.

266 BUCKLEY v. FITZSIMMONS

Opinion of the Court
Judge Fairchild dissented in part. He agreed with theDistrict Court that Fitzsimmons was entitled only to qualified immunity for his press statements. He noted that themajority had failed to examine the particular function that
Fitzsimmons was performing, and concluded that conducting
a press conference was not among "the functions that entitlejudges and prosecutors in the judicial branch to absolute immunity." Id., at 1246 (opinion dissenting in part and concur-ring in part). Responding directly to the majority's reasoning, he wrote:

"It is true that procedures afforded in our system of
justice give a defendant a good chance to avoid such re-sults of prejudicial publicity as excessive bail, difficulty

or inability of selecting an impartial jury, and the like.These procedures reduce the cost of impropriety by a
prosecutor, but I do not find that the courts have recog-nized their availability as a sufficient reason for conferring immunity." Ibid.
We granted Buckley's petition for certiorari, vacated the
judgment, and remanded the case for further proceedings inlight of our intervening decision in

Burns v. Reed, 500 U. S.
478 (1991). 502 U. S. 801 (1991). On remand, the samepanel, again divided, reaffirmed its initial decision, with one

modification not relevant here. 952 F. 2d 965 (CA7 1992)
(per curiam). The Court of Appeals held that "[n]othing in
Burns undermine[d]" its initial holding that prosecutors are
absolutely immune for "normal preparatory steps"; unlikethe activities at issue in

Burns, "[t]alking with (willing) experts is trial preparation." 952 F. 2d, at 966-967. In similar fashion, the court adhered to its conclusion that Fitzsimmons was entitled to absolute immunity for conducting the
press conference. The court recognized that the press conference bore some similarities to the conduct in Burns (advising the police as to the propriety of an arrest). It did not
take place in court, and it was not part of the prosecutor's

Opinion of the Court
trial preparation. 952 F. 2d, at 967. The difference, accord-ing to the court, is that "[a]n arrest causes injury whether or

not a prosecution ensues," whereas the only constitutionalinjury caused by the press conference depends on judicial
action. Ibid.Judge Fairchild again dissented. He adhered to his earlier conclusion that Fitzsimmons was entitled to only quali-fied immunity for the press conference, but he was also
persuaded that Burns had drawn a line between " `conductclosely related to the judicial process' " and conduct in the
role of " `administrator or investigative officer.' " He agreedthat trial preparation falls on the absolute immunity side of
that line, but felt otherwise about the search for favorableevidence that might link the bootprint to petitioner during
"a year long pre-arrest and pre-indictment investigation"aggressively supervised by Fitzsimmons. 952 F. 2d, at
969 (opinion dissenting in part).We granted certiorari for a second time, limited to issues
relating to prosecutorial immunity. 506 U. S. 814 (1992).3We now reverse.

III
The principles applied to determine the scope of immunityfor state officials sued under Rev. Stat. $ 1979, as amended,

3 Although petitioner also alleged that respondents violated his constitutional rights in presenting the fabricated evidence to the grand jury and
his trial jury, see App. 10-11, 14-15, we are not presented with any question regarding those claims. The Court of Appeals agreed with the District Court, see id., at 45-47, and held that those actions were protected
by absolute immunity. Buckley v. Fitzsimmons, 919 F. 2d 1230, 1243
(CA7 1990) ("The selection of evidence to present to the grand jurors, and
the manner of questioning witnesses, can no more be the basis of liability
than may the equivalent activities before the petit jury"). That decision
was made according to traditional principles of absolute immunity under

$ 1983, however, and did not depend on the original, injury-focused theory
of absolute prosecutorial immunity with which we are concerned here;
nor was it included within the questions presented in petitioner's petition
for certiorari.

268 BUCKLEY v. FITZSIMMONS

Opinion of the Court
42 U. S. C. $ 1983, are by now familiar. Section 1983 on its
face admits of no defense of official immunity. It subjects to
liability "[e]very person" who, acting under color of state law,
commits the prohibited acts. In Tenney v. Brandhove, 341
U. S. 367, 376 (1951), however, we held that Congress did
not intend $ 1983 to abrogate immunities "well grounded in
history and reason." Certain immunities were so well established in 1871, when $ 1983 was enacted, that "we presume that Congress would have specifically so provided had
it wished to abolish" them. Pierson v. Ray, 386 U. S. 547,
554-555 (1967). See also Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc., 453
U. S. 247, 258 (1981). Although we have found immunities
in $ 1983 that do not appear on the face of the statute, "[w]e
do not have a license to establish immunities from $ 1983
actions in the interests of what we judge to be sound public policy." Tower v. Glover, 467 U. S. 914, 922-923 (1984).
"[O]ur role is to interpret the intent of Congress in enacting

$ 1983, not to make a freewheeling policy choice." Malley v.
Briggs, 475 U. S. 335, 342 (1986).

Since Tenney, we have recognized two kinds of immunities
under $ 1983. Most public officials are entitled only to qualified immunity. Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, 807
(1982); Butz v. Economou, 438 U. S. 478, 508 (1978). Under
this form of immunity, government officials are not subject to
damages liability for the performance of their discretionary
functions when "their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known." Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457
U. S., at 818. In most cases, qualified immunity is sufficient
to "protect officials who are required to exercise their discretion and the related public interest in encouraging the vigorous exercise of official authority." Butz v. Economou, 438
U. S., at 506.

We have recognized, however, that some officials perform
"special functions" which, because of their similarity to func509us2105K 05-04-97 17:29:14 PAGES OPINPGT

269Cite as: 509 U. S. 259 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
tions that would have been immune when Congress enacted

$ 1983, deserve absolute protection from damages liability.
Id., at 508. "[T]he official seeking absolute immunity bears
the burden of showing that such immunity is justified for
the function in question." Burns v. Reed, 500 U. S., at 486;
Antoine v. Byers & Anderson, Inc., 508 U. S. 429, 432, and
n. 4 (1993). Even when we can identify a common-law tradition of absolute immunity for a given function, we have considered "whether $ 1983's history or purposes nonetheless
counsel against recognizing the same immunity in $ 1983
actions." Tower v. Glover, 467 U. S., at 920. Not surprisingly, we have been "quite sparing" in recognizing absolute
immunity for state actors in this context. Forrester v.
White, 484 U. S. 219, 224 (1988).

In determining whether particular actions of government
officials fit within a common-law tradition of absolute immunity, or only the more general standard of qualified immunity,
we have applied a "functional approach," see, e. g., Burns,
500 U. S., at 486, which looks to "the nature of the function
performed, not the identity of the actor who performed it,"
Forrester v. White, 484 U. S., at 229. We have twice applied
this approach in determining whether the functions of contemporary prosecutors are entitled to absolute immunity.

In Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U. S. 409 (1976), we held that
a state prosecutor had absolute immunity for the initiation
and pursuit of a criminal prosecution, including presentation
of the State's case at trial. Noting that our earlier cases
had been "predicated upon a considered inquiry into the immunity historically accorded the relevant official at common
law and the interests behind it," id., at 421, we focused on
the functions of the prosecutor that had most often invited
common-law tort actions. We concluded that the commonlaw rule of immunity for prosecutors was "well settled" and
that "the same considerations of public policy that underlie
the common-law rule likewise countenance absolute immu509us2105K 05-04-97 17:29:14 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
nity under $ 1983." Id., at 424. Those considerations 4 sup-ported a rule of absolute immunity for conduct of prosecutors

that was "intimately associated with the judicial phase ofthe criminal process."

Id., at 430. In concluding that "in
initiating a prosecution and in presenting the State's case,
the prosecutor is immune from a civil suit for damages under$ 1983," we did not attempt to describe the line between a

prosecutor's acts in preparing for those functions, some ofwhich would be absolutely immune, and his acts of investigation or "administration," which would not. Id., at 431, andn. 33.

We applied the Imbler analysis two Terms ago in Burnsv.

Reed, 500 U. S. 478 (1991). There the $ 1983 suit challenged two acts by a prosecutor: (1) giving legal advice to
the police on the propriety of hypnotizing a suspect and onwhether probable cause existed to arrest that suspect, and

(2) participating in a probable-cause hearing. We held that
only the latter was entitled to absolute immunity. Immunity for that action under $ 1983 accorded with the commonlaw absolute immunity of prosecutors and other attorneys
for eliciting false or defamatory testimony from witnesses or
for making false or defamatory statements during, and related to, judicial proceedings. Id., at 489-490; id., at 501
(Scalia, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in

4 In particular, we expressed concern that fear of potential liability
would undermine a prosecutor's performance of his duties by forcing him
to consider his own potential liability when making prosecutorial decisions
and by diverting his "energy and attention . . . from the pressing duty of
enforcing the criminal law." Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U. S., at 424-425.
Suits against prosecutors would devolve into "a virtual retrial of the criminal offense of a new forum," id., at 425, and would undermine the vigorous
enforcement of the law by providing a prosecutor an incentive not "to go
forward with a close case where an acquittal likely would trigger a suit
against him for damages," id., at 426, and n. 24. We also expressed concern that the availability of a damages action might cause judges to be
reluctant to award relief to convicted defendants in post-trial motions.
Id., at 427.

Opinion of the Court
part). Under that analysis, appearing before a judge andpresenting evidence in support of a motion for a search warrant involved the prosecutor's " `role as advocate for theState.' " Id., at 491, quoting Imbler, 424 U. S., at 431, n. 33.
Because issuance of a search warrant is a judicial act, appear-ance at the probable-cause hearing was " `intimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process,' " Burns,500 U. S., at 492, quoting

Imbler, 424 U. S., at 430.We further decided, however, that prosecutors are not

entitled to absolute immunity for their actions in giving legaladvice to the police. We were unable to identify any historical or common-law support for absolute immunity in theperformance of this function. 500 U. S., at 492-493. We
also noted that any threat to the judicial process from "theharassment and intimidation associated with litigation"
based on advice to the police was insufficient to overcome the"[a]bsen[ce] [of] a tradition of immunity comparable to the
common-law immunity from malicious prosecution, whichformed the basis for the decision in

Imbler." Id., at 493, 494.And though we noted that several checks other than civil

litigation prevent prosecutorial abuses in advising the police,"one of the most important checks, the judicial process," will
not be effective in all cases, especially when in the end thesuspect is not prosecuted.

Id., at 496. In sum, we heldthat providing legal advice to the police was not a function

"closely associated with the judicial process." Id., at 495.

IV
In this case the Court of Appeals held that respondentsare entitled to absolute immunity because the injuries suffered by petitioner occurred during criminal proceedings.That holding is contrary to the approach we have consistently followed since Imbler. As we have noted, the Imblerapproach focuses on the conduct for which immunity is
claimed, not on the harm that the conduct may have causedor the question whether it was lawful. The location of the

509us2105K 05-04-97 17:29:14 PAGES OPINPGT
272 BUCKLEY v. FITZSIMMONS

Opinion of the Court
injury may be relevant to the question whether a complainthas adequately alleged a cause of action for damages (a question that this case does not present, see supra, at 261). Itis irrelevant, however, to the question whether the conduct
of a prosecutor is protected by absolute immunity. Accord-ingly, although the Court of Appeals' reasoning may be relevant to the proper resolution of issues that are not before us,it does not provide an acceptable basis for concluding that
either the preindictment fabrication of evidence or the post-indictment press conference was a function protected by
absolute immunity. We therefore turn to consider each ofrespondents' claims of absolute immunity.

A
We first address petitioner's argument that the prosecu-tors are not entitled to absolute immunity for the claim that

they conspired to manufacture false evidence that would linkhis boot with the bootprint the murderer left on the front
door. To obtain this false evidence, petitioner submits, theprosecutors shopped for experts until they found one who
would provide the opinion they sought. App. 7-9. At thetime of this witness shopping the assistant prosecutors were
working hand in hand with the sheriff 's detectives underthe joint supervision of the sheriff and State's attorney
Fitzsimmons.Petitioner argues that

Imbler's protection for a prosecu-tor's conduct "in initiating a prosecution and in presenting

the State's case," 424 U. S., at 431, extends only to the act ofinitiation itself and to conduct occurring in the courtroom.
This extreme position is plainly foreclosed by our opinion in
Imbler itself. We expressly stated that "the duties of theprosecutor in his role as advocate for the State involve actions preliminary to the initiation of a prosecution and ac-tions apart from the courtroom," and are nonetheless entitled to absolute immunity. Id., at 431, n. 33. We noted inparticular that an out-of-court "effort to control the presen509us2105K 05-04-97 17:29:14 PAGES OPINPGT

273Cite as: 509 U. S. 259 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
tation of [a] witness' testimony" was entitled to absolute im-munity because it was "fairly within [the prosecutor's] function as an advocate." Id., at 430, n. 32. To be sure, Burnsmade explicit the point we had reserved in

Imbler, 424 U. S.,
at 430-431, and n. 33: A prosecutor's administrative duties
and those investigatory functions that do not relate to anadvocate's preparation for the initiation of a prosecution or

for judicial proceedings are not entitled to absolute immu-nity. See

Burns, 500 U. S., at 494-496. We have not retreated, however, from the principle that acts undertaken bya prosecutor in preparing for the initiation of judicial proceedings or for trial, and which occur in the course of his role
as an advocate for the State, are entitled to the protections
of absolute immunity. Those acts must include the professional evaluation of the evidence assembled by the police and
appropriate preparation for its presentation at trial or before
a grand jury after a decision to seek an indictment has
been made.

On the other hand, as the function test of Imbler recognizes, the actions of a prosecutor are not absolutely immune
merely because they are performed by a prosecutor. Qualified immunity " `represents the norm' " for executive officers,
Malley v. Briggs, 475 U. S., at 340, quoting Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 807, so when a prosecutor "functions as
an administrator rather than as an officer of the court" he is
entitled only to qualified immunity. Imbler, 424 U. S., at
431, n. 33. There is a difference between the advocate's role
in evaluating evidence and interviewing witnesses as he prepares for trial, on the one hand, and the detective's role in
searching for the clues and corroboration that might give
him probable cause to recommend that a suspect be arrested,
on the other hand. When a prosecutor performs the investigative functions normally performed by a detective or police
officer, it is "neither appropriate nor justifiable that, for the
same act, immunity should protect the one and not the
other." Hampton v. Chicago, 484 F. 2d 602, 608 (CA7 1973)

509us2105K 05-04-97 17:29:14 PAGES OPINPGT
274 BUCKLEY v. FITZSIMMONS

Opinion of the Court
(internal quotation marks omitted), cert. denied, 415 U. S.
917 (1974). Thus, if a prosecutor plans and executes a raid
on a suspected weapons cache, he "has no greater claim to
complete immunity than activities of police officers allegedly
acting under his direction." 484 F. 2d, at 608-609.

The question, then, is whether the prosecutors have carried their burden of establishing that they were functioning
as "advocates" when they were endeavoring to determine
whether the bootprint at the scene of the crime had been
made by petitioner's foot. A careful examination of the allegations concerning the conduct of the prosecutors during the
period before they convened a special grand jury to investigate the crime provides the answer. See supra, at 263, n. 1.
The prosecutors do not contend that they had probable cause
to arrest petitioner or to initiate judicial proceedings during
that period. Their mission at that time was entirely investigative in character. A prosecutor neither is, nor should consider himself to be, an advocate before he has probable cause
to have anyone arrested.5

5 Of course, a determination of probable cause does not guarantee a
prosecutor absolute immunity from liability for all actions taken afterwards. Even after that determination, as the opinion dissenting in part
points out, post, at 290, a prosecutor may engage in "police investigative
work" that is entitled to only qualified immunity.

Furthermore, there is no "true anomaly," post, at 286, in denying absolute immunity for a state actor's investigative acts made before there is
probable cause to have a suspect arrested just because a prosecutor would
be entitled to absolute immunity for the malicious prosecution of someone
whom he lacked probable cause to indict. That criticism ignores the essence of the function test. The reason that lack of probable cause allows
us to deny absolute immunity to a state actor for the former function
(fabrication of evidence) is that there is no common-law tradition of immunity for it, whether performed by a police officer or prosecutor. The reason that we grant it for the latter function (malicious prosecution) is that
we have found a common-law tradition of immunity for a prosecutor's decision to bring an indictment, whether he has probable cause or not. By
insisting on an equation of the two functions merely because a prosecutor

275Cite as: 509 U. S. 259 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
It was well after the alleged fabrication of false evidenceconcerning the bootprint that a special grand jury was empaneled. And when it finally was convened, its immediatepurpose was to conduct a more thorough investigation of the
crime--not to return an indictment against a suspect whomthere was already probable cause to arrest. Buckley was
not arrested, in fact, until 10 months after the grand jury hadbeen convened and had finally indicted him. Under these
circumstances, the prosecutors' conduct occurred well beforethey could properly claim to be acting as advocates. Respondents have not cited any authority that supports an argumentthat a prosecutor's fabrication of false evidence during the
preliminary investigation of an unsolved crime was immunefrom liability at common law, either in 1871 or at any date
before the enactment of $ 1983. It therefore remains pro-tected only by qualified immunity.

After Burns, it would be anomalous, to say the least, togrant prosecutors only qualified immunity when offering
legal advice to police about an unarrested suspect, but thento endow them with absolute immunity when conducting investigative work themselves in order to decide whether asuspect may be arrested.

6 That the prosecutors later called

might be subject to liability for one but not the other, the dissent allows its
particular policy concerns to erase the function test it purports to respect.

In general, the dissent's distress over the denial of absolute immunity
for prosecutors who fabricate evidence regarding unsolved crimes, post,
at 283-285, like the holding of the Court of Appeals, seems to conflate the
question whether a $ 1983 plaintiff has stated a cause of action with the
question whether the defendant is entitled to absolute immunity for his
actions.

6 Cf. Burns v. Reed, 500 U. S. 478, 495 (1991): "Indeed, it is incongruous

to allow prosecutors to be absolutely immune from liability for giving advice to the police, but to allow police officers only qualified immunity for
following the advice. . . . Almost any action by a prosecutor, including his
or her direct participation in purely investigative activity, could be said to
be in some way related to the ultimate decision whether to prosecute, but
we have never indicated that absolute immunity is that expansive." If
the police, under the guidance of the prosecutors, had solicited the alleg509us2105K 05-04-97 17:29:14 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
a grand jury to consider the evidence this work produceddoes not retroactively transform that work from the administrative into the prosecutorial.7 A prosecutor may not shieldhis investigative work with the aegis of absolute immunity
merely because, after a suspect is eventually arrested, in-dicted, and tried, that work may be retrospectively described
as "preparation" for a possible trial; every prosecutor mightthen shield himself from liability for any constitutional
wrong against innocent citizens by ensuring that they go totrial. When the functions of prosecutors and detectives are
the same, as they were here, the immunity that protectsthem is also the same.

B
We next consider petitioner's claims regarding Fitzsim-mons' statements to the press. Petitioner alleged that, during the prosecutor's public announcement of the indictment,Fitzsimmons made false assertions that numerous pieces of
evidence, including the bootprint evidence, tied Buckley to a
burglary ring that committed the Nicarico murder. App. 12.Petitioner also alleged that Fitzsimmons released mug shots

of him to the media, "which were prominently and repeatedlydisplayed on television and in the newspapers."

Ibid. Petiedly "fabricated" testimony, of course, they would not be entitled to anything more than qualified immunity.

7 See Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U. S. 409, 431, n. 33 (1976): "Preparation,

both for the initiation of the criminal process and for a trial, may require
the obtaining, reviewing, and evaluating of evidence. At some point, and
with respect to some decisions, the prosecutor no doubt functions as an
administrator rather than as an officer of the court. Drawing a proper
line between these functions may present difficult questions, but this case
does not require us to anticipate them." Although the respondents rely
on the first sentence of this passage to suggest that a prosecutor's actions
in "obtaining, reviewing, and evaluating" evidence are always protected
by absolute immunity, the sentence that follows qualifies that suggestion.
It confirms that some of these actions may fall on the administrative,
rather than the judicial, end of the prosecutor's activities, and therefore
be entitled only to qualified immunity.

tioner's legal theory is that "[t]hese false and prejudicialstatements inflamed the populace of DuPage County against"

to deadlock rather than acquit, id., at 19.Fitzsimmons' statements to the media are not entitled to
absolute immunity. Fitzsimmons does not suggest that in1871 there existed a common-law immunity for a prosecutor's, or attorney's, out-of-court statement to the press. TheCourt of Appeals agreed that no such historical precedent
exists. 952 F. 2d, at 967. Indeed, while prosecutors, likeall attorneys, were entitled to absolute immunity from defamation liability for statements made during the courseof judicial proceedings and relevant to them, see Burns,
500 U. S., at 489-490; Imbler, 424 U. S., at 426, n. 23; id., at439 (

made out of court received only good-faith immunity. Thecommon-law rule was that "[t]he speech of a counsel is privileged by the occasion on which it is spoken . . . ." Flint v.

The functional approach of Imbler, which conforms to the
common-law theory, leads us to the same conclusion. Com-ments to the media have no functional tie to the judicial process just because they are made by a prosecutor. At the

defamatory matter before the commencement, or after the termination of
the judicial proceeding (unless such publication is an act incidental to the
proper initiation thereof, or giving legal effect thereto); nor does it apply
to or include any publication of defamatory matter to any person other
than those to whom, or in any place other than that in which, such publication is required or authorized by law to be made for the proper conduct
of the judicial proceedings." Veeder, Absolute Immunity in Defamation:

press conference, Fitzsimmons did not act in " `his role asadvocate for the State,' " Burns v. Reed, 500 U. S., at 491,

quoting Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U. S., at 431, n. 33. Theconduct of a press conference does not involve the initiation
of a prosecution, the presentation of the State's case in court,or actions preparatory for these functions. Statements to
the press may be an integral part of a prosecutor's job, seeNational District Attorneys Assn., National Prosecution
Standards 107, 110 (2d ed. 1991), and they may serve a vitalpublic function. But in these respects a prosecutor is in no
different position than other executive officials who deal withthe press, and, as noted,

supra, at 268, 277, qualified immu-nity is the norm for them.

Fitzsimmons argues nonetheless that policy considerationssupport extending absolute immunity to press statements.
Brief for Respondents 30-33. There are two responses tohis submissions. First, "[w]e do not have a license to establish immunities from $ 1983 actions in the interests of whatwe judge to be sound public policy."

Tower v. Glover, 467U. S., at 922-923. When, as here, the prosecutorial function

is not within the advocate's role and there is no historicaltradition of immunity on which we can draw, our inquiry is
at an end. Second, "[t]he presumption is that qualifiedrather than absolute immunity is sufficient to protect government officials in the exercise of their duties." Burns v.
Reed, 500 U. S., at 486-487. Even if policy considerationsallowed us to carve out new absolute immunities to liability

for constitutional wrongs under $ 1983, we see little reasonto suppose that qualified immunity would provide adequate
protection to prosecutors in their provision of legal advice tothe police, see

id., at 494-496, yet would fail to provide suffi-cient protection in the present context.

9 The Circuits other than the Seventh Circuit that have addressed this
issue have applied only qualified immunity to press statements, see, e. g.,
Powers v. Coe, 728 F. 2d 97, 103 (CA2 1984); Marrero v. Hialeah, 625 F. 2d

In his complaint, petitioner also charged that the prosecu-tors violated his rights under the Due Process Clause

through extraction of statements implicating him by coerc-ing two witnesses and paying them money. App. 9-11, 19.
The precise contours of these claims are unclear, and theywere not addressed below; we leave them to be passed on in
the first instance by the Court of Appeals on remand.As we have stated, supra, at 261, 264, 265, n. 2, petitioner
does not challenge many aspects of the Court of Appeals'decision, and we have not reviewed them; they remain undisturbed by this opinion. As to the two challenged rulings onabsolute immunity, however, the judgment of the United
States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit is reversed,and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent
with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice Scalia, concurring.
As the Court observes, respondents have not demon-strated that the function either of fabricating evidence during the preliminary investigation of a crime, or of makingout-of-court statements to the press, was protected by a
well-established common-law privilege in 1871, when $ 1983was enacted. See ante, at 275, 277. It follows that respondents' alleged performance of such acts is not absolutely

331, 345-346 (CA3 1989), yet Fitzsimmons has not suggested that prosecutors in those Circuits have been unduly constrained in keeping the public
informed of pending criminal prosecutions. We also do not perceive why
anything except a firm common-law rule should entitle a prosecutor to
absolute immunity for his statements to the press when nonprosecutors
who make similar statements, for instance, an attorney general's press
spokesperson or a police officer announcing the return of an indictment,
receive only qualified immunity.

immune from suit under $ 1983, since "the presumed legisla-tive intent not to eliminate traditional immunities is our only

justification for limiting the categorical language of the stat-ute."

Burns v. Reed, 500 U. S. 478, 498 (1991) (Scalia, J.,
concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part); accord, ante, at 267-269. The policy reasons for extendingprotection to such conduct may seem persuasive, see

post, at
283-286 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and dissenting inpart), but we simply "do not have a license to establish immunities from $ 1983 actions in the interests of what wejudge to be sound public policy,"

Tower v. Glover, 467 U. S.
914, 922-923 (1984). This is therefore an easy case, in my
view, and I have no difficulty joining the Court's judgment.

I join the Court's opinion as well, though I have some reservation about the historical authenticity of the "principle
that acts undertaken by a prosecutor in preparing for the
initiation of judicial proceedings or for trial, and which occur
in the course of his role as an advocate for the State, are
entitled to the protections of absolute immunity," ante, at
273. By the early years of this century, there was some authority for the proposition that the traditional defamation
immunity extends to "act[s] incidental to the proper initiation" or pursuit of a judicial proceeding, such as "[s]tatements
made by counsel to proposed witnesses," Veeder, Absolute
Immunity in Defamation: Judicial Proceedings, 9 Colum. L.
Rev. 463, 489, and n. 82 (1909). See, e. g., G. Bower, Actionable Defamation 103-105, and n. h (1908); Youmans v. Smith,
153 N. Y. 214, 47 N. E. 265 (1897). I have not found any
previous expression of such a principle, but accede to the
Court's judgment that it existed several decades earlier,
when $ 1983 was enacted, at least in the sense that it could
be logically derived from then-existing decisions, cf. Burns,
supra, at 505 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment in part and
dissenting in part). In future cases, I trust the Court (aided
by briefing on the point) will look to history to determine
more precisely the outlines of this principle. It is certainly

281Cite as: 509 U. S. 259 (1993)
Scalia, J., concurring
in accord with the principle to say that prosecutors cannot"properly claim to be acting as advocates"

before they have
"probable cause to have anyone arrested," ante, at 274, 275--but reference to the common-law cases will be indispensable

to show when they can properly claim to be acting "as advocates" after that point, though not yet "during the course ofjudicial proceedings,"

ante, at 277.
I believe, moreover, that the vagueness of the "acting-as-advocate" principle may be less troublesome in practice than

it seems in theory, for two reasons. First, the Court reaf-firms that the defendant official bears the burden of showing
that the conduct for which he seeks immunity would have
been privileged at common law in 1871. See ante, at 269,
275, 277-278. Thus, if application of the principle is unclear,
the defendant simply loses. Second, many claims directed
at prosecutors, of the sort that are based on acts not plainly
covered by the conventional malicious-prosecution and defamation privileges, are probably not actionable under $ 1983,
and so may be dismissed at the pleading stage without regard to immunity--undermining the dissent's assertion that
we have converted absolute prosecutorial immunity into "little more than a pleading rule," post, at 283. I think petitioner's false-evidence claims in the present case illustrate this
point. Insofar as they are based on respondents' supposed
knowing use of fabricated evidence before the grand jury
and at trial, see ante, at 267, n. 3--acts which might state a
claim for denial of due process, see, e. g., Mooney v. Holohan,
294 U. S. 103, 112 (1935) (per curiam)--the traditional defamation immunity provides complete protection from suit
under $ 1983. If "reframe[d] . . . to attack the preparation" of
that evidence, post, at 283, the claims are unlikely to be cognizable under $ 1983, since petitioner cites, and I am aware
of, no authority for the proposition that the mere preparation
of false evidence, as opposed to its use in a fashion that deprives someone of a fair trial or otherwise harms him, violates the Constitution. See Buckley v. Fitzsimmons, 919

As the Court is correct to observe, the rules determining
whether particular actions of government officials are entitled to immunity have their origin in historical practice and
have resulted in a functional approach. Ante, at 267-268.
See also Burns v. Reed, 500 U. S. 478, 484-486 (1991); Forrester v. White, 484 U. S. 219, 224 (1988); Malley v. Briggs, 475

U. S. 409, 420-425 (1976). I share the Court's unwillingness
to accept Buckley's argument "that Imbler's protection for a
prosecutor's conduct `in initiating a prosecution and in presenting the State's case,' 424 U. S., at 431, extends only to
the act of initiation itself and to conduct occurring in the
courtroom." Ante, at 272. In Imbler, we acknowledged
that "the duties of the prosecutor in his role as advocate for
the State involve actions preliminary to the initiation of a
prosecution and actions apart from the courtroom," and we
explained that these actions of the prosecutor, undertaken in

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
his functional role as an advocate, were entitled to absoluteimmunity, 424 U. S., at 431, n. 33. See

ante, at 269-270.
There is a reason even more fundamental than that statedby the Court for rejecting Buckley's argument that

Imbler
applies only to the commencement of a prosecution and to
in-court conduct. This formulation of absolute prosecutorialimmunity would convert what is now a substantial degree of

protection for prosecutors into little more than a pleadingrule. Almost all decisions to initiate prosecution are preceded by substantial and necessary out-of-court conduct bythe prosecutor in evaluating the evidence and preparing for
its introduction, just as almost every action taken in the
courtroom requires some measure of out-of-court preparation. Were preparatory actions unprotected by absolute immunity, a criminal defendant turned civil plaintiff could simply reframe a claim to attack the preparation instead of the
absolutely immune actions themselves. Imbler v. Pachtman, supra, at 431, n. 34. Cf. Eastland v. United States
Servicemen's Fund, 421 U. S. 491, 503-507 (1975). Allowing
the avoidance of absolute immunity through that pleading
mechanism would undermine in large part the protections
that we found necessary in Imbler and would discourage trial
preparation by prosecutors. In this way, Buckley's proffered standard would have the perverse effect of encouraging, rather than penalizing, carelessness, cf. Forrester v.
White, supra, at 223, and it would discourage early participation by prosecutors in the criminal justice process.

Applying these principles to the case before us, I believe
that the conduct relating to the expert witnesses falls on the
absolute immunity side of the divide. As we recognized in
Imbler and Burns, and do recognize again today, the functional approach does not dictate that all actions of a prosecutor are accorded absolute immunity. "When a prosecutor
performs the investigative functions normally performed by
a detective or police officer, it is `neither appropriate nor justifiable that, for the same act, immunity should protect the

one and not the other.' " Ante, at 273, quoting Hampton v.
Chicago, 484 F. 2d 602, 608 (CA7 1973), cert. denied, 415 U. S.
917 (1974). Nonetheless, while Buckley labels the prosecu-tors' actions relating to the bootprint experts as "investigative," I believe it is more accurate to describe the prosecutors' conduct as preparation for trial. A prosecutor mustconsult with a potential trial witness before he places the

witness on the stand, and if the witness is a critical one,consultation may be necessary even before the decision
whether to indict. It was obvious from the outset that thebootprint was critical to the prosecution's case, and the
prosecutors' consultation with experts is best viewed as a
step to ensure the bootprint's admission in evidence and to
bolster its probative value in the eyes of the jury.

Just as Imbler requires that the decision to use a witness
must be insulated from liability, 424 U. S., at 426, it requires
as well that the steps leading to that decision must be free
of the distortive effects of potential liability, at least to the
extent that the prosecutor is engaged in trial preparation.
Actions in "obtaining, reviewing, and evaluating" witness
testimony, id., at 431, n. 33, are a classic function of the prosecutor as advocate. Pretrial and even preindictment consultation can be "intimately associated with the judicial phase
of the criminal process," id., at 430. Potential liability
premised on the prosecutor's early consultation would have
"an adverse effect upon the functioning of the criminal justice system," id., at 426. Concern about potential liability
arising from pretrial consultation with a witness might
"hampe[r]" a prosecutor's exercise of his judgment as to
whether a certain witness should be used. Id., at 426, and
n. 24. The prospect of liability may "induc[e] [a prosecutor]
to act with an excess of caution or otherwise to skew [his]
decisions in ways that result in less than full fidelity to the
objective and independent criteria that ought to guide [his]
conduct." Forrester v. White, supra, at 223. Moreover,
"[e]xposing the prosecutor to liability for the initial phase of

his prosecutorial work could interfere with his exercise ofindependent judgment at every phase of his work, since the

prosecutor might come to see later decisions in terms of theireffect on his potential liability."

Malley v. Briggs, 475 U. S.,
at 343. That distortion would frustrate the objective of
accuracy in the determination of guilt or innocence. See
Imbler v. Pachtman, supra, at 426.

Furthermore, the very matter the prosecutors were con-sidering, the decision to use particular expert testimony, was

"subjected to the `crucible of the judicial process.' " Burnsv.

Reed, 500 U. S., at 496, quoting Imbler v. Pachtman,
supra, at 440 (White, J., concurring in judgment). Indeed,
it appears that the only constitutional violations these actions are alleged to have caused occurred within the judicial process. The question Buckley presented in his petition
for certiorari itself makes this point: "Whether prosecutors
are entitled to absolute prosecutorial immunity for supervision of and participation in a year long pre-arrest and preindictment investigation because the injury suffered by the
criminal defendant occurred during the later criminal proceedings?" Pet. for Cert. i. Remedies other than prosecutorial liability, for example, a pretrial ruling of inadmissibility or a rejection by the trier of fact, are more than adequate
"to prevent abuses of authority by prosecutors." Burns v.
Reed, supra, at 496. See also Butz v. Economou, 438 U. S.,
at 512; Imbler v. Pachtman, supra, at 429.

Our holding in Burns v. Reed, supra, is not to the contrary.
There we cautioned that prosecutors were not entitled to
absolute immunity for "every litigation-inducing conduct,"
id., at 494, or for every action that "could be said to be in
some way related to the ultimate decision whether to prosecute," id., at 495. The premise of Burns was that, in providing advice to the police, the prosecutor acted to guide the
police, not to prepare his own case. See id., at 482 (noting
that the police officers sought the prosecutor's advice first to
find out whether hypnosis was "an unacceptable investiga509us2105K 05-04-97 17:29:14 PAGES OPINPGT

tive technique" and later to determine whether there was abasis to "plac[e] [a suspect] under arrest"). In those circumstances, we found an insufficient link to the judicial processto warrant absolute immunity. But the situation here is
quite different. For the reasons already explained, subject-ing a prosecutor's pretrial or preindictment witness consultation and preparation to damages actions would frustrateand impede the judicial process, the result

Imbler is de-signed to avoid.

II
The Court reaches a contrary conclusion on the issue ofthe bootprint evidence by superimposing a bright-line standard onto the functional approach that has guided our pastdecisions. According to the Court, "[a] prosecutor neither
is, nor should consider himself to be, an advocate before hehas probable cause to have anyone arrested."

Ante, at 274.To allow otherwise, the Court tells us, would create an anomalous situation whereby prosecutors are granted only quali-fied immunity when offering legal advice to the police regarding an unarrested suspect, see Burns, supra, at 492-496,but are endowed with absolute immunity when conducting
their own legal work regarding an unarrested suspect.
Ante, at 275-276.I suggest that it is the Court's probable-cause demarcation

between when conduct can be considered absolutely immuneadvocacy and when it cannot that creates the true anomaly
in this case. We were quite clear in Imbler that if absoluteimmunity for prosecutors meant anything, it meant that
prosecutors were not subject to suit for malicious prosecu-tion. 424 U. S., at 421-422, 424, 428. See also

Burns,
supra, at 493 ("[T]he common-law immunity from maliciousprosecution . . . formed the basis for the decision in Imbler").

Yet the central component of a malicious prosecution claimis that the prosecutor in question acted maliciously and without probable cause. See Wyatt v. Cole, 504 U. S. 158, 165(1992); id., at 170 (

Kennedy, J., concurring); id., at 177

(Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting); W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Kee-ton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts $ 119

(5th ed. 1984). If the Court means to withhold absolute im-munity whenever it is alleged that the injurious actions of a
prosecutor occurred before he had probable cause to believe
a specified individual committed a crime, then no longer is aclaim for malicious prosecution subject to ready dismissal on

absolute immunity grounds, at least where the claimant isclever enough to include some actions taken by the prosecutor prior to the initiation of prosecution. I find it ratherstrange that the classic case for the invocation of absolute
immunity falls on the unprotected side of the Court's new
dividing line. I also find it hard to accept any line that can
be so easily manipulated by criminal defendants turned civil
plaintiffs, allowing them to avoid a dismissal on absolute immunity grounds by throwing in an allegation that a prosecutor acted without probable cause. See supra, at 283.

Perhaps the Court means to draw its line at the point
where an appropriate neutral third party, in this case the
Illinois special grand jury, makes a determination of probable
cause. This line, too, would generate anomalous results.
To begin, it could have the perverse effect of encouraging
prosecutors to seek indictments as early as possible in an
attempt to shelter themselves from liability, even in cases
where they would otherwise prefer to wait on seeking an
indictment to ensure that they do not accuse an innocent
person. Given the stigma and emotional trauma attendant
to an indictment and arrest, promoting premature indictments and arrests is not a laudable accomplishment.

Even assuming these premature actions would not be induced by the Court's rule, separating absolute immunity
from qualified immunity based on a third-party determination of probable cause makes little sense when a civil plaintiff
claims that a prosecutor falsified evidence or coerced confessions. If the false evidence or coerced confession served as
the basis for the third party's determination of probable

cause, as was alleged here, it is difficult to fathom why securing such a fraudulent determination transmogrifies unprotected conduct into protected conduct. Finally, the Court
does not question our conclusion in Burns that absolute immunity attached to a prosecutor's conduct before a grand
jury because it " `perform[s] a judicial function.' " 500 U. S.,
at 490, quoting W. Prosser, Law of Torts $ 94, pp. 826-827
(1941). See also Yaselli v. Goff, 12 F. 2d 396 (CA2 1926),
aff 'd, 275 U. S. 503 (1927). It is unclear to me, then, why
preparing for grand jury proceedings, which obviously occur
before an indictment is handed down, cannot be "intimately
associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process"
and subject to absolute immunity. Burns, supra, at 492,
quoting Imbler, supra, at 430.

As troubling as is the line drawn by the Court, I find the
reasons for its line-drawing to be of equal concern. The
Court advances two reasons for distinguishing between preprobable-cause and post-probable-cause activity by prosecutors. First, the distinction is needed to ensure that prosecutors receive no greater protection than do police officers
when engaged in identical conduct. Ante, at 276. Second,
absent some clear distinction between investigation and advocacy, the Court fears, "every prosecutor might . . . shield
himself from liability for any constitutional wrong against
innocent citizens by ensuring that they go to trial." Ibid.
This step, it is alleged, would enable any prosecutor to "retrospectively describ[e]" his investigative work "as `preparation' for a possible trial" and therefore request the benefits
of absolute immunity. Ibid. I find neither of these justifications persuasive.

The Court's first concern, I take it, is meant to be a restatement of one of the unquestioned goals of our $ 1983 immunity jurisprudence: ensuring parity in treatment among
state actors engaged in identical functions. Forrester v.
White, 484 U. S., at 229; Cleavinger v. Saxner, 474 U. S., at

289Cite as: 509 U. S. 259 (1993)
Opinion of Kennedy, J.
201. But it was for the precise reason of advancing this goal
that we adopted the functional approach to absolute immunity in the first place, and I do not see a need to augment
that approach by developing bright-line rules in cases where
determining whether different actors are engaged in identical functions involves careful attention to subtle details.
The Court, moreover, perceives a danger of disparate treatment because it assumes that before establishing probable
cause, police and prosecutors perform the same functions.
Ante, at 276. This assumption seem to me unwarranted. I
do not understand the art of advocacy to have an inherent
temporal limitation, so I cannot say that prosecutors are
never functioning as advocates before the determination of
probable cause. More to the point, the Court's assumption
further presumes that when both prosecutors and police
officers engage in the same conduct, they are of necessity
engaged in the same function. With this I must disagree.
Two actors can take part in similar conduct and similar inquiries while doing so for different reasons and to advance
different functions. It may be that a prosecutor and a police
officer are examining the same evidence at the same time,
but the prosecutor is examining the evidence to determine
whether it will be persuasive at trial and of assistance to the
trier of fact, while the police officer examines the evidence
to decide whether it provides a basis for arresting a suspect.
The conduct is the same but the functions distinct. See
Buchanan, Police-Prosecutor Teams, 23 The Prosecutor 32
(summer 1989).

Advancing to the second reason provided for the Court's
line-drawing, I think the Court overstates the danger of
allowing pre-probable-cause conduct to constitute advocacy
entitled to absolute immunity. I agree with the Court that
the institution of a prosecution "does not retroactively transform . . . work from the administrative into the prosecutorial," ante, at 276, but declining to institute a prosecution

290 BUCKLEY v. FITZSIMMONS

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
likewise should not "retroactively transform" work from theprosecutorial into the administrative. Cf. Imbler, 424 U. S.,

at 431, n. 33 ("We recognize that the duties of the prosecutorin his role as advocate for the State involve actions preliminary to the initiation of a prosecution . . . . These includequestions of whether to present a case to a grand jury,
whether to file an information, [and] whether and when toprosecute"). In either case, the primary question, one
which I have confidence the federal courts are able to answerwith some accuracy, is whether a prosecutor was acting as
an advocate, an investigator, or an administrator when hetook the actions called into question in a subsequent $ 1983
action. As long as federal courts center their attention onthis question, a concern that prosecutors can disguise their
investigative and administrative actions as early forms ofadvocacy seems to be unfounded.

III
In recognizing a distinction between advocacy and investi-gation, the functional approach requires the drawing of difficult and subtle distinctions, and I understand the necessityfor a workable standard in this area. But the rule the Court
adopts has created more problems than it has solved. Forexample, even after there is probable cause to arrest a suspect or after a suspect is indicted, a prosecutor might act tofurther police investigative work, say by finding new leads,
in which case only qualified immunity should apply. Theconverse is also true: Even before investigators are satisfied
that probable cause exists or before an indictment is secured,a prosecutor might begin preparations to present testimony
before a grand jury or at trial, to which absolute immunitymust apply. In this case, respondents functioned as advocates, preparing for prosecution before investigatorsare alleged to have amassed probable cause and before an
indictment was deemed appropriate. In my judgment

respondents are entitled to absolute immunity for theirinvolvement with the expert witnesses in this case. With

respect, I dissent from that part of the Court's decisionreversing the Court of Appeals judgment of absolute immunity for respondents' conduct in relation to the bootprintevidence.

SHALALA, SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN

SERVICES v. SCHAEFER

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eighth circuit

No. 92-311. Argued March 31, 1993--Decided June 24, 1993
In 1986, respondent Schaefer filed a claim for Social Security disability

benefits, which was denied by petitioner Secretary at the administrative
level. Schaefer sought judicial review and, on April 4, 1989, the District
Court reversed the administrative denial of benefits and remanded the
case to the Secretary pursuant to the fourth sentence of 42 U. S. C.

$ 405(g). Schaefer was awarded benefits on remand and, in July 1990,
he returned to the District Court and filed for attorney's fees under
the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA). In opposing the motion, the
Secretary noted that the EAJA required Schaefer to file his application
within 30 days of "final judgment" in the action, 28 U. S. C. $ 2412(d)
(1)(B), and argued that the 30-day clock began running when the District Court's sentence-four remand order of April 4, 1989, became final,
which would have occurred at the end of the 60 days for appeal provided
under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a). The District Court
awarded fees to Schaefer, holding that a sentence-four remand order is
not a final judgment where a court retains jurisdiction and plans to
enter a judgment after remand proceedings are complete. The Court
of Appeals affirmed on the same basis.

Held:

1. The 30-day period for filing an application for EAJA fees begins
immediately upon expiration of the time for appeal of a "sentence-four
remand order." Pp. 295-302.

(a) A district court remanding a case pursuant to sentence four of

$ 405(g) must enter judgment in the case and may not retain jurisdiction
over the administrative proceedings on remand. Sentence four's plain
language authorizes a court to enter a judgment "with or without remanding the cause for a rehearing," not a remand order "with or without" a judgment. Pp. 295-297.

(b) The Court's decision in Sullivan v. Hudson, 490 U. S. 877, 892--
that fees incurred during administrative proceedings held pursuant to a
district court's remand order may be recovered under the EAJA--does
not apply where the remand is ordered pursuant to sentence four of

$ 405(g). Pp. 298-300.

Opinion of the Court
(c) Contrary to dicta in Sullivan v. Hudson, a Social Security
claimant who obtains a sentence-four judgment reversing the Secretary's denial of benefits meets the description of a "prevailing party" set
out in Texas State Teachers Assn. v. Garland Independent School Dist.,
489 U. S. 782, 791-792. Pp. 300-302.

2. Schaefer's application for EAJA fees was nonetheless timely under

$ 2412(d)(1) because the District Court failed to comply with Federal
Rule of Civil Procedure 58 in entering its sentence-four remand order
of April 4, 1989. The EAJA's 30-day time limit runs from the end of
the period for appeal, and that period does not begin until a judgment
is entered in compliance with the formalities of Rule 58. Because the
District Court never entered formal judgment, neither the time for
appeal nor the EAJA's 30-day clock had run when Schaefer filed his
application. Pp. 302-303.

960 F. 2d 1053, affirmed.

Scalia, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Rehnquist,
C. J., and White, O'Connor, Kennedy, Souter, and Thomas, JJ., joined.

Opinion of the Court
decision of the Secretary of Health and Human Servicesdenying Social Security benefits. One possible outcome of

such a suit is that the district court, pursuant to sentencefour of $ 405(g), will enter "a judgment . . . reversing the
decision of the Secretary . . . [and] remanding the cause fora rehearing." The issue here is whether the 30-day period
for filing an application for EAJA fees begins immediatelyupon expiration of the time for appeal of such a "sentencefour remand order," or sometime after the administrativeproceedings on remand are complete.

I
In 1986, respondent Richard Schaefer filed an applicationfor disability benefits under Title II of the Social Security

Act, 49 Stat. 622, as amended, 42 U. S. C. $ 401 et seq. (1988ed. and Supp. III). He was denied benefits at the administrative level, and sought judicial review by filing suit againstthe Secretary as authorized by $ 405(g). Schaefer and the
Secretary filed cross-motions for summary judgment. OnApril 4, 1989, the District Court held that the Secretary had
committed three errors in ruling on Schaefer's case and en-tered an order stating that "the Secretary's decision denying
disability insurance benefits to [Schaefer] is reversed, thatthe parties' cross-motions for summary judgment are denied,
and that the case is remanded to the Secretary for furtherconsideration in light of this Order." App. to Pet. for Cert.
27a.In accordance with this order, Schaefer's application for
benefits was reconsidered at the administrative level, andwas granted. On July 18, 1990, Schaefer returned to the
District Court and filed an application for attorney's feespursuant to EAJA. In response, the Secretary noted that
Schaefer was required to file any application for EAJA fees"within thirty days of final judgment in the action," 28
U. S. C. $ 2412(d)(1)(B), and argued that the relevant "finaljudgment" in the case was the administrative decision on

Opinion of the Court
remand, which had become final on April 2, 1990. The Dis-trict Court stayed action on Schaefer's EAJA application

pending this Court's imminent ruling in Melkonyan v. Sulli-van, 501 U. S. 89 (1991).

Melkonyan was announced shortly thereafter, holdingthat a final administrative decision could not constitute a
"final judgment" for purposes of $ 2412(d)(1)(B). Id., at 96.In light of

Melkonyan, the Secretary changed positions toargue that EAJA's 30-day clock began running when the

District Court's April 4, 1989 order (not the administrativeruling on remand) became final, which would have occurred
at the end of the 60 days for appeal provided under FederalRule of Appellate Procedure 4(a). Thus, the Secretary concluded, Schaefer's time to file his EAJA application expiredon July 3, 1989, over a year before the application was filed.
The District Court, however, found Schaefer's EAJA appli-cation timely under the controlling Circuit precedent of

Wel-ter v. Sullivan, 941 F. 2d 674 (CA8 1991), which held that a

sentence-four remand order is not a final judgment where"the district court retain[s] jurisdiction . . . and plan[s] to
enter dispositive sentence four judgmen[t]" after the admin-istrative proceedings on remand are complete.

Id., at 675.The District Court went on to rule that Schaefer was entitled to $1,372.50 in attorney's fees.The Secretary fared no better on appeal. The Eighth Circuit declined the Secretary's suggestion for en banc reconsid-eration of

Welter, and affirmed the District Court in an un-published per curiam opinion. Judgt. order reported at 960

F. 2d 1053 (1992). The Secretary filed a petition for certio-rari, urging us to reverse the Court of Appeals summarily.
We granted certiorari, 506 U. S. 997 (1992), and set the casefor oral argument.

II
The first sentence of 28 U. S. C. $ 2412(d)(1)(B) provides:

"A party seeking an award of fees and other expensesshall,

within thirty days of final judgment in the action,

509us2106K 05-04-97 17:33:53 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
submit to the court an application for fees and other ex-penses which shows that the party is a prevailing party

and is eligible to receive an award under this subsection,and the amount sought, including an itemized statement
from any attorney or expert witness representing or ap-pearing in behalf of the party stating the actual time
expended and the rate at which fees and other expenseswere computed." (Emphasis added.)

In Melkonyan v. Sullivan, we held that the term "final judg-ment" in the highlighted phrase above "refers to judgments
entered by a court of law, and does not encompass decisionsrendered by an administrative agency." See 501 U. S., at
96. Thus, the only order in this case that could have re-sulted in the starting of EAJA's 30-day clock was the District Court's April 4, 1989, order, which reversed the Secre-tary's decision denying disability benefits and remanded the
case to the Secretary for further proceedings.In cases reviewing final agency decisions on Social Security benefits, the exclusive methods by which district courtsmay remand to the Secretary are set forth in sentence four
and sentence six of $ 405(g), which are set forth in the mar-gin.

1 See Melkonyan, supra, at 99-100. Schaefer correctly

1 Sentences four and six of 42 U. S. C. $ 405(g) provide:
"[4] The [district] court shall have power to enter, upon the pleadings and
transcript of the record, a judgment affirming, modifying, or reversing
the decision of the Secretary, with or without remanding the cause for a
rehearing. . . . [6] The court may, on motion of the Secretary made for
good cause shown before he files his answer, remand the case to the Secretary for further action by the Secretary, and it may at any time order
additional evidence to be taken before the Secretary, but only upon a
showing that there is new evidence which is material and that there is
good cause for the failure to incorporate such evidence into the record in
a prior proceeding; and the Secretary shall, after the case is remanded,
and after hearing such additional evidence if so ordered, modify or affirm
his findings of fact or his decision, or both, and shall file with the court
any such additional and modified findings of fact and decision, and a tran509us2106K 05-04-97 17:33:53 PAGES OPINPGT

297Cite as: 509 U. S. 292 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
concedes that the District Court's remand order in this casewas entered pursuant to sentence four.

2 He argues, however, that a district court proceeding under that provisionneed not enter a judgment at the time of remand, but may

postpone it and retain jurisdiction pending completion of theadministrative proceedings. That argument, however, is inconsistent with the plain language of sentence four, whichauthorizes a district court to enter a judgment "with or without" a remand order, not a remand order "with or without"a judgment. See

Sullivan v. Finkelstein, 496 U. S. 617, 629(1990). Immediate entry of judgment (as opposed to entry

of judgment after postremand agency proceedings have beencompleted and their results filed with the court) is in fact the
principal feature that distinguishes a sentence-four remandfrom a sentence-six remand. See

Melkonyan, supra, at101-102.

Nor is it possible to argue that the judgment authorizedby sentence four, if it includes a remand, does not become a
"final judgment"--as required by $ 2412(d)--upon expirationof the time for appeal. If that were true, there would never
be any final judgment in cases reversed and remanded forfurther agency proceedings (including those which suffer
that fate after the Secretary has filed the results of asentence-six remand). Sentence eight of $ 405(g) states that
"[t]he judgment of the court"--which must be a reference toa sentence-four judgment, since that is the

only judgmentauthorized by $ 405(g)--"shall be final except that it shall be

script of the additional record and testimony upon which his action in
modifying or affirming was based."

2 Sentence-six remands may be ordered in only two situations: where

the Secretary requests a remand before answering the complaint, or
where new, material evidence is adduced that was for good cause not presented before the agency. See $ 405(g) (sentence six); Melkonyan v. Sullivan, 501 U. S. 89, 99-100, and n. 2 (1991); cf. Sullivan v. Finkelstein, 496
U. S. 617, 626 (1990). The District Court's April 4, 1989, remand order
clearly does not fit within either situation.

509us2106K 05-04-97 17:33:53 PAGES OPINPGT
298 SHALALA v. SCHAEFER

Opinion of the Court
subject to review in the same manner as a judgment in othercivil actions." Thus, when the time for seeking appellate

review has run, the sentence-four judgment fits squarelywithin the term "final judgment" as used in $ 2412(d), which
is defined to mean "a judgment that is final and not appealable." 28 U. S. C. $ 2412(d)(2)(G). We described the lawwith complete accuracy in

Melkonyan, when we said:

"In sentence four cases, the filing period begins after
the final judgment (`affirming, modifying, or reversing')is entered by the court and the appeal period has run,

so that the judgment is no longer appealable. . . . In
sentence six cases, the filing period does not begin untilafter the postremand proceedings are completed, the

Secretary returns to court, the court enters a final judg-ment, and the appeal period runs." 501 U. S., at 102.

Schaefer raises two arguments that merit further discus-sion. The first is based on our decision in

Sullivan v. Hudson, 490 U. S. 877, 892 (1989), which held that fees incurredduring administrative proceedings held pursuant to a district

court's remand order could be recovered under EAJA. Inorder "to effectuate

Hudson," Schaefer contends, a district
court entering a sentence-four remand order may properlyhold its judgment in abeyance (and thereby delay the start

of EAJA's 30-day clock) until postremand administrative
proceedings are complete; otherwise, as far as fees incurredduring the yet-to-be-held administrative proceedings are

concerned, the claimant would be unable to comply with therequirement of $ 2412(d)(1)(B) that the fee application include
"the amount sought" and "an itemized statement . . . [of] the
actual time expended" by attorneys and experts. In response, the Secretary argues that Hudson applies only to
cases remanded pursuant to sentence six of $ 405(g), where
there is no final judgment and the clock does not begin to
run. The difficulty with that, Schaefer contends, is that
Hudson itself clearly involved a sentence-four remand.

299Cite as: 509 U. S. 292 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
On the last point, Schaefer is right. Given the facts re-cited by the Court in Hudson, the remand order there could

have been authorized only under sentence four. See 490U. S., at 880-881; cf. n. 2, supra. However, the facts in Hudson also show that the District Court had not terminated thecase, but had retained jurisdiction during the remand. And
that was a central element in our decision, as the penultimatesentence of the opinion shows:

"We conclude that where a court orders a remand tothe Secretary in a benefits litigation

and retains contin-uing jurisdiction over the case pending a decision from

the Secretary which will determine the claimant's enti-tlement to benefits, the proceedings on remand are an
integral part of the `civil action' for judicial review, andthus attorney's fees for representation on remand are
available subject to the other limitations in the EAJA."490 U. S., at 892 (emphasis added).

We have since made clear, in Finkelstein, that that retentionof jurisdiction, that failure to terminate the case, was error:
Under $ 405(g), "each final decision of the Secretary [is] re-viewable by a

separate piece of litigation," and a sentence-four remand order "terminate[s] the civil action" seeking

judicial review of the Secretary's final decision. 496 U. S.,at 624-625 (emphases added). What we adjudicated in Hudson, in other words, was a hybrid: a sentence-four remandthat the District Court had improperly (but without objection) treated like a sentence-six remand.3 We specifically

3 The Secretary not only failed to object to the District Court's retention
of jurisdiction, but affirmatively endorsed the practice as a means of accommodating the lower court cases holding that a $ 405(g) plaintiff does
not become a prevailing party until Social Security benefits are actually
awarded. Reply Brief for Petitioner in Sullivan v. Hudson, O. T. 1988,
No. 616, pp. 12-13. Those precedents were highly favorable to the Government, of course, because they relieved the Secretary of liability for
EAJA fees in all cases where Social Security benefits were ultimately
denied. But they were also at war with the view--expressed later in the

509us2106K 05-04-97 17:33:53 PAGES OPINPGT
300 SHALALA v. SCHAEFER

Opinion of the Court
noted in Melkonyan that Hudson was limited to a "narrowclass of qualifying administrative proceedings" where "the

district court retains jurisdiction of the civil action" pendingthe completion of the administrative proceedings. 501 U. S.,
at 97. We therefore do not consider the holding of Hudsonbinding as to sentence-four remands that are ordered (as
they should be) without retention of jurisdiction, or that areordered with retention of jurisdiction that is challenged.

4

Schaefer's second argument is that a sentence-four remandorder cannot be considered a "final judgment" for purposes

of $ 2412(d)(1)(B) because that provision requires the partyseeking fees to submit an application "show[ing] that [he] is
a prevailing party." That showing, Schaefer contends, can-not be made until the proceedings on remand are complete,
since a Social Security claimant does not "prevail" until he isawarded Social Security benefits. The premise of this argument is wrong. No holding of this Court has ever deniedprevailing-party status (under $ 2412(d)(1)(B)) to a plaintiff
who won a remand order pursuant to sentence four of$ 405(g). Dicta in Hudson stated that "a Social Security

Secretary's Hudson reply brief--that a sentence-four remand order is a
"final judgment" in the civil action. Id., at 16. Essentially, the Secretary
in Hudson wanted it both ways: He wanted us to regard retention of
jurisdiction as proper for purposes of determining prevailing-party status,
but as improper for purposes of awarding fees on remand.

4 Justice Stevens says that our holding "overrul[es]" Sullivan v. Hudson, 490 U. S. 877 (1989). Post, at 304, 311. We do not think that is an
accurate characterization. Hudson remains good law as applied to remands ordered pursuant to sentence six. And since the distinction between sentence-four and sentence-six remands was neither properly presented nor considered in Hudson, see supra, at 299, and n. 3, and infra
this page and 301, limiting Hudson to sentence-six cases does not "overrule" the decision even in part. See Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U. S. 619,
631 (1993). We agree with Justice Stevens that until today there has
been some contradiction in our case law on this subject. In resolving it,
however, we have not simply chosen Melkonyan's dicta over Hudson, but

have grounded our decision in the text and structure of the relevant statutes, particularly $ 405.

claimant would not, as a general matter, be a prevailingparty within the meaning of the EAJA merely because a

court had remanded the action to the agency for further pro-ceedings." 490 U. S., at 887. But that statement (like the
holding of the case) simply failed to recognize the distinctionbetween a sentence-four remand, which terminates the litigation with victory for the plaintiff, and a sentence-six re-mand, which does not. The sharp distinction between the
two types of remand had not been made in the lower courtopinions in

Hudson, see Hudson v. Secretary of Health andHuman Services, 839 F. 2d 1453 (CA11 1988); App. to Pet. for

Cert. in Sullivan v. Hudson, O. T. 1988, No. 616, pp. 17a-20a(setting forth unpublished District Court opinion), was not
included in the question presented for decision,5 and wasmentioned for the first time in the closing pages of the Secretary's reply brief, see Reply Brief for Petitioner in Sullivanv.

Hudson, O. T. 1988, No. 616, pp. 14-17. It is only decisionsafter Hudson--specifically Finkelstein and Melkonyan--

which establish that the sentence-four, sentence-six distinc-tion is crucial to the structure of judicial review established
under $ 405(g). See Finkelstein, 496 U. S., at 626; Melkon-yan, 501 U. S., at 97-98.

Hudson's dicta that remand does not generally conferprevailing-party status relied on three cases, none of which
supports that proposition as applied to sentence-four re-mands.

Hanrahan v. Hampton, 446 U. S. 754, 758-759(1980), rejected an assertion of prevailing-party status, not

by virtue of having secured a remand, but by virtue of hav-ing obtained a favorable procedural ruling (the reversal on
appeal of a directed verdict) during the course of the judicialproceedings.

Hewitt v. Helms, 482 U. S. 755 (1987), held

5 As formulated in the Secretary's petition, the question on which the
Court granted certiorari in Hudson was: "Whether Social Security administrative proceedings conducted after a remand from the courts are `adversary adjudications' for which attorney fees are available under the
[EAJA]." Pet. for Cert. in Sullivan v. Hudson, O. T. 1988, No. 616, p. I.

supports the proposition that a party who wins a sentence-four remand order is a prevailing party. Garland held that
status to have been obtained "[i]f the plaintiff has succeededon any significant issue in litigation which achieve[d] some of
the benefit . . . sought in bringing suit." Id., at 791-792 (ci-tation and internal quotation marks omitted). Obtaining a
sentence-four judgment reversing the Secretary's denial ofbenefits certainly meets this description. See also

Farrarv. Hobby, 506 U. S. 103 (1992).

Finally, Schaefer argues that, even if the District Courtshould have entered judgment in connection with its April

4, 1989 order remanding the case to the Secretary, the factremains that it did not. And since no judgment was entered, he contends, the 30-day time period for filing an appli-cation for EAJA fees cannot have run. We agree.

An EAJA application may be filed until 30 days after ajudgment becomes "not appealable"--

i. e., 30 days after thetime for appeal has ended. See $$ 2412(d)(1)(B), (d)(2)(G);

see also Melkonyan, 501 U. S., at 102. Rule 4(a) of the Fed-eral Rules of Appellate Procedure establishes that, in a civil
case to which a federal officer is a party, the time for appealdoes not end until 60 days after "entry of judgment," and
that a judgment is considered entered for purposes of theRule only if it has been "entered in compliance with Rul[e]
58 . . . of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure." Fed. RulesApp. Proc. 4(a)(1), (7). Rule 58, in turn, requires a district
court to set forth every judgment "on a separate document"and provides that "[a] judgment is effective only when so set

forth." See United States v. Indrelunas, 411 U. S. 216, 220(1973) (per curiam).

Since the District Court's April 4 remand order was a finaljudgment, see supra, at 299, a "separate document" of judgment should have been entered. It is clear from the recordthat this was not done. The Secretary does not dispute that,
but argues that a formal "separate document" of judgmentis not needed for an order of a district court to

become ap-pealable. That is quite true, see 28 U. S. C. $ 1291; Bankers

Trust Co. v. Mallis, 435 U. S. 381 (1978) (per curiam); Fink-elstein, supra, at 628, n. 7, but also quite irrelevant. EAJA's
30-day time limit runs from the end of the period for appeal,not the

beginning. Absent a formal judgment, the DistrictCourt's April 4 order remained "appealable" at the time that

Schaefer filed his application for EAJA fees, and thus theapplication was timely under $ 2412(d)(1).

6 We disagree with Justice Stevens' assertion that "the respondent
has prevailed precisely because the District Court in this case did enter a
remand order without entering a judgment." Post, at 305, n. 2 (emphasis
in original). By entering a sentence-four remand order, the District
Court did enter a judgment; it just failed to comply with the formalities
of Rule 58 in doing so. That was error but, as detailed in the text, the
relevant rules and statutes impose the burden of that error on the party
seeking to assert an untimeliness defense, here the Secretary. Thus, contrary to Justice Stevens' suggestion, see ibid., our ruling in favor of
respondent is not at all inconsistent with the proposition that sentence
four and sentence six provide the exclusive methods by which district
courts may remand a $ 405 case to the Secretary.

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
Health and Human Services' claims determination and re-manded the case to the Social Security Administration

(Agency) for reconsideration (a so-called "sentence-four" re-mand), we held that claimants who are otherwise eligible for
attorney's fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act
(EAJA), 28 U. S. C. $ 2412(d), are entitled to reimbursementfor fees incurred on remand. In so holding, it was our understanding, consistent with "prevailing party" jurispru-dence in other areas of the law, 490 U. S., at 886-887, that
"[n]o fee award at all would have been available to [the claim-ant] absent successful conclusion of the remand proceedings,"
id., at 889.

Two Terms later, in Melkonyan v. Sullivan, 501 U. S. 89
(1991), we stated in dicta that in sentence-four remand cases,
the 30-day period in which claimants must submit their
EAJA fee applications begins to run when the district court
issues its remand order. Id., at 101-102. That statement
was in obvious tension with the holding of Hudson; for it
makes little sense to start the 30-day EAJA clock running
before a claimant even knows whether he or she will be a
"prevailing party" under EAJA by securing benefits on
remand.

The question presented in this case is how best to reconcile
this tension in our cases. If we reject the Government's
rather bizarre proposal of requiring all Social Security
claimants who achieve a sentence-four remand to file a protective EAJA application within 30 days of the remand
order, and then update or amend their applications if they
are successful on remand, see Brief for Petitioner 26-30, we
are left with essentially two alternatives. We can overrule
Hudson and endorse Melkonyan's dicta that the 30-day clock
under EAJA begins to run once the district court issues a
sentence-four remand order. That is the path followed by
the majority. Alternatively, we can repudiate the dicta in
Melkonyan and reaffirm the understanding of EAJA that
we had at the time we decided Hudson: that fees are avail509us2106K 05-04-97 17:33:54 PAGES OPINPGT

able for services rendered on remand before the Agency, and
the 30-day EAJA clock begins to run when the district court
enters a final, dispositive judgment for EAJA purposes once
the proceedings on remand have been completed. That is
the path followed by the Court of Appeals in this case and
several Courts of Appeals that have struggled with the tension between Hudson and Melkonyan.1 Because that approach accords with a proper understanding of the purposes
underlying EAJA and, in my view, common sense, I would
affirm not only the judgment of the Court of Appeals, but its
reasoning as well.

The major premise underlying the Court's contrary decision today is that there is sharp distinction, for purposes of
EAJA, between remands ordered pursuant to sentence four
and sentence six of 42 U. S. C. $ 405(g).2 Legal expenses incurred in a "sentence-six" remand may be recoverable under
EAJA, the Court suggests, whereas such expenses incurred
in a sentence-four remand, the far more common of the two,
are most definitely not recoverable. Ante, at 298-300.
While this dichotomy has the superficial appeal of purporting
to "harmoniz[e] the remand provisions of $ 405(g) with the
EAJA requirement that a `final judgment' be entered in the
civil action in order to trigger the EAJA filing period," Mel1 See, e. g., Hafner v. Sullivan, 972 F. 2d 249, 252 (CA8 1992); Labrie v.
Secretary of Health and Human Services, 976 F. 2d 779, 785 (CA1 1992);
Gutierrez v. Sullivan, 953 F. 2d 579, 584 (CA10 1992).

2 See ante, at 296-297, n. 1. The Court reasons that remands can be

ordered only pursuant to sentence six or sentence four, and that Congress
left no room for hybrids or for cases that did not fit neatly into either
category. Thus, referring to "the plain language of sentence four," ante,
at 297, the Court assumes that the sentence "authorizes a district court to
enter a judgment `with or without' a remand order, not a remand order
`with or without' a judgment," ibid. Ironically, when we come to the end
of the Court's opinion, we learn that the respondent has prevailed precisely because the District Court in this case did enter a remand order
without entering a judgment.

konyan, 501 U. S., at 102,3 it directly contradicts, in my view,the admonition repeated in our cases that "the language of

[EAJA] must be construed with reference to the purpose of. . . EAJA and the realities of litigation against the Government." Sullivan v. Finkelstein, 496 U. S. 617, 630 (1990).See also

Sullivan v. Hudson, 490 U. S., at 889-890.As explained above, our decision in Hudson was based in

part on the premise that prevailing party status for purposesof EAJA could not be determined until after proceedings
on remand were completed. I find unpersuasive the Court'sattempt to distinguish cases relied upon in Hudson that we
previously characterized as "for all intents and purposesidentical."

Id., at 886; see ante, at 301-302.4 Nevertheless,

3 The EAJA, 28 U. S. C. $ 2412, provides in relevant part:
"(d)(1)(A) [A] court shall award to a prevailing party other than the United
States fees and other expenses . . . incurred by that party in any civil
action . . . brought by or against the United States in any court having
jurisdiction of that action, unless the court finds that the position of the
United States was substantially justified or that special circumstances
make an award unjust.

"(B) A party seeking an award of fees and other expenses shall, within
thirty days of final judgment in the action, submit to the court an application for fees and other expenses which shows that the party is a prevailing
party and is eligible to receive an award under this subsection, and the
amount sought . . . . The party shall also allege that the position of the
United States was not substantially justified."

4 As we explained in Hudson:

"[I]n a case such as this one, where a court's remand to the agency for
further administrative proceedings does not necessarily dictate the receipt
of benefits, the claimant will not normally attain `prevailing party' status
within the meaning of $ 2412(d)(1)(A) until after the result of the administrative proceedings is known. The situation is for all intents and purposes identical to that we addressed in Hanrahan v. Hampton, 446 U. S.
754 (1980). There we held that the reversal of a directed verdict for defendants on appeal did not render the plaintiffs in that action `prevailing
parties' such that an interim award of attorney's fees would be justified
under 42 U. S. C. $ 1988. We found that such `procedural or evidentiary
rulings' were not themselves `matters on which a party could "prevail"
for purposes of shifting his counsel fees to the opposing party under

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
the Court's holding today that a claimant who secures noth-ing more than an order instructing the Secretary to try again

is a "prevailing party" does undermine one premise of ourdecision in Hudson. It is, however, only one premise. Hudson stood on broader grounds, and I continue to believe thatour opinion in that case correctly explained why legal services performed in agency proceedings on remand are prop-erly within the coverage of EAJA:

"We think the principles we found persuasive in[
Pennsylvania v.] Delaware Valley [Citizens' Coun-cil, 478 U. S. 546 (1986),] and [New York Gaslight Club,

Inc. v.] Carey[, 447 U. S. 54 (1980),] are controlling here.As in Delaware Valley, the administrative proceedings
on remand in this case were `crucial to the vindicationof [respondent's] rights.' Delaware Valley, supra, at
561. . . . [T]he services of an attorney may be necessaryboth to ensure compliance with the District Court's
order in the administrative proceedings themselves, andto prepare for any further proceedings before the District Court to verify such compliance. In addition, aswe did in

Carey, we must endeavor to interpret the feestatute in light of the statutory provisions it was designed to effectuate. Given the `mandatory' nature ofthe administrative proceedings at issue here, and their

$ 1988.' Id., at 759. More recently in Texas State Teachers Assn. v. Garland Independent School Dist., 489 U. S. 782 (1989), we indicated that in
order to be considered a prevailing party, a plaintiff must achieve some of
the benefit sought in bringing the action. Id., at 791-793. We think it
clear that under these principles a Social Security claimant would not, as
a general matter, be a prevailing party within the meaning of the EAJA
merely because a court had remanded the action to the agency for further
proceedings. See Hewitt v. Helms, 482 U. S. 755, 760 (1987). Indeed, the
vast majority of the Courts of Appeals have come to this conclusion. See,
e. g., Paulson v. Bowen, 836 F. 2d 1249, 1252 (CA9 1988); Swedberg v.
Bowen, 804 F. 2d 432, 434 (CA8 1986); Brown v. Secretary of Health and
Human Services, [747 F. 2d 878, 880-881 (CA3 1984)]." Hudson, 490
U. S., at 886-887.

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
close relation in law and fact to the issues before theDistrict Court on judicial review, we find it difficult to

ascribe to Congress an intent to throw the Social Secu-rity claimant a lifeline that it knew was a foot short.
Indeed, the incentive which such a system would createfor attorneys to abandon claimants after judicial remand
runs directly counter to long established ethical canonsof the legal profession. See American Bar Association, Model Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 1.16,pp. 53-55 (1984). Given the anomalous nature of this
result, and its frustration of the very purposes behindthe EAJA itself, Congress cannot lightly be assumed to
have intended it. See Christiansburg Garment Co. v.EEOC, 434 U. S. 412, 418-419 (1978). Since the judicial
review provisions of the Social Security Act contemplatean ongoing civil action of which the remand proceedings
are but a part, and the EAJA allows `any court havingjurisdiction of that action' to award fees, 28 U. S. C.

$ 2412(d)(1)(A), we think the statute, read in light of itspurpose `to diminish the deterrent effect of seeking review of, or defending against, governmental action,' 94Stat. 2325, permits a court to award fees for services
performed on remand before the Social Security Admin-istration." 490 U. S., at 889-890.

Hudson was not based on a distinction between a remandordered pursuant to sentence four and one ordered pursuant
to sentence six of $ 405(g), and it was not based solely on ourunderstanding of "prevailing party" jurisprudence in other
areas of the law. It was based also on the commonsenseconclusion that allowing for the recovery of legal fees incurred on remand before the Agency was necessary to effec-tuate the purposes underlying EAJA, and that permitting
the awarding of such fees accorded with Congress' intent inpassing that statute.

That sound and eminently reasonable conclusion was notundermined by our decision in Sullivan v. Finkelstein, 496

309Cite as: 509 U. S. 292 (1993)
Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
U. S. 617 (1990), the case that first drew the distinction be-tween sentence-four and sentence-six remands. To be sure,

there is language in Finkelstein that supports the Court'sconclusion today that a final judgment must accompany a
sentence-four remand order and that such a judgment starts
the 30-day clock for filing a fee application under EAJA.But

Finkelstein, unlike Hudson, was not a case interpreting
EAJA. The question presented was whether the DistrictCourt order invalidating Agency regulations as inconsistent

with the Social Security Act was a "final decision" within themeaning of 28 U. S. C. $ 1291 and thus subject to immediate
appeal by the Secretary. In holding that it was, we were
careful to note that the issue presented was "appealability,"
not "the proper time period for filing a petition for attorney's
fees under EAJA." 496 U. S., at 628-629, n. 8. More directly, we expressly declined respondent's invitation to import into our analysis of appealability under $ 1291 our
reasoning and analysis of the EAJA in Hudson. See 496
U. S., at 630.

In Melkonyan, we changed course. The distinction that
we had drawn between the question of appealability under

$ 1291 and eligibility for fees under EAJA was blurred; in
Melkonyan, we imported wholecloth our analysis from Finkelstein, which, again, concerned $ 1291, into our analysis of
when the 30-day limitations period for filing an EAJA fee
application began to run. It was in that case that we first
crafted the rigid distinction between a sentence-four remand
and a sentence-six remand for purposes of EAJA, and stated
in dicta that the "final judgment in the action" referred to in

$ 2412(d)(1)(B) of EAJA was the judgment entered concomitantly with a sentence-four remand order.

In my opinion, we should abandon that dicta. While the
distinction between a sentence-four and a sentence-six remand may have some force for purposes of appealability, it
is a distinction without a difference when viewed, as it
should be, "with reference to the purpose of the EAJA and

the realities of litigation against the Government." Finkelstein, 496 U. S., at 630. Regardless of whether the remand
is ordered pursuant to sentence four or sentence six, theclaimant will be dependent on the lawyer's services on remand in order to secure the benefits to which he or she may
be entitled. If anything, recovery of fees in cases remandedpursuant to sentence four is more important for purposes

of effectuating the goals of EAJA than the recovery of feesin sentence-six cases. As we explained in

Finkelstein, a
sentence-six remand frequently occurs because the claimantseeks to present new evidence of which neither the Agency

nor the claimant was aware at the time the Secretary's benefits determination was made. Id., at 626. Thus, in many
sentence-six cases the added expenses incurred by the claimant on remand cannot be attributed to any wrongful or unjustified decisions by the Secretary. That is not the case, of
course, with a sentence-four remand; a court's order to remand a case pursuant to sentence four of $ 405(g) necessarily
means that the Secretary has committed legal error. The
claimant is sent back to the administrative proceedings, with
all the expenses incurred therein, precisely because of decisions made by the Secretary. For the reasons we articulated in Hudson, fees incurred under these circumstances
should be covered under EAJA.

Claimants have 30 days from "final judgment in the action"
to file an application for fees. 28 U. S. C. $ 2412(d)(1)(B). In
Hudson, the Government conceded that the "final judgment"
referred to in $ 2412(d)(1)(B) was a judgment entered in the
district court after the proceedings on remand were completed. Hudson, 490 U. S., at 887. In my view, nothing in
Finkelstein, a case interpreting a different statute, undermined that commonsense understanding of the procedural
steps that must be taken to become eligible for a fee award:
(1) secure a remand order; (2) prevail on remand; and (3)
have an appropriate judgment entered. I would therefore
disavow the dicta in Melkonyan and hold, as did the court

"[w]hen a judicial remand order in Social Security dis-ability cases contemplates additional administrative proceedings that will determine the merits of the claimant'sapplication for benefits, and thus will determine whether

purposes after the proceedings on remand have beencompleted."

Hafner v. Sullivan, 972 F. 2d 249, 252(CA8 1992).

Thus, while I agree with the Court's judgment in this case,I respectfully disagree with its decision to overrule Sullivan

HELLER, SECRETARY, KENTUCKY CABINET FORHUMAN RESOURCES

v. DOE, by his mother and
next friend, DOE, et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe sixth circuit

No. 92-351. Argued March 22, 1993--Decided June 24, 1993
Kentucky permits the involuntary commitment of mentally retarded or

mentally ill individuals who present a threat of danger to themselves,
family, or others, who can reasonably benefit from the available treatment, and for whom the least restrictive alternative is placement in the
relevant facility. However, the statutory procedures for the commitment of the two groups differ in the two respects at issue here. First,
the applicable burden of proof in mental retardation commitment proceedings is clear and convincing evidence while the standard in mental
illness proceedings is beyond a reasonable doubt. Second, guardians
and immediate family members of the subject of a mental retardation
proceeding may participate as if parties to those proceedings, with all
attendant rights. In this action, respondents, a class of involuntarily
committed mentally retarded persons, claimed that the distinctions are
irrational and therefore violate the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, and that granting close family members and guardians
the status of parties violates the Due Process Clause. The District
Court granted them summary judgment, and the Court of Appeals
affirmed.

Held:

1. Respondents' claim that the statutes should be reviewed under a
heightened scrutiny standard is not properly presented, since it was not
raised below and the lower courts ruled only on the ground of rationalbasis review. Pp. 318-319.

2. The distinctions between the two proceedings are consistent with
the Equal Protection Clause. Pp. 319-330.

(a) Classifications neither involving fundamental rights nor proceeding along suspect lines do not run afoul of the Equal Protection
Clause if there is a rational relationship between the disparity of treatment and a legitimate governmental purpose. A legislature need not
articulate its rationale, and a State need not produce evidence to sustain
the classification's rationality. Moreover, courts are compelled to accept a legislature's generalization even when there is an imperfect fit
between means and ends. Pp. 319-321.

(b) Kentucky has proffered more than adequate justifications for its
burden of proof scheme. Mental retardation, which is a developmental
disability usually well documented throughout childhood, is easier to
diagnose than is mental illness, which may have a sudden onset in adulthood. Thus, it could have assigned a higher burden of proof to mental
illness to equalize the risk of erroneous determination that the subject
of a commitment proceeding has the condition in question. Ease of diagnosis could also result in a more accurate dangerousness determination for the mentally retarded, who have a relatively static condition
and a well-documented record of previous behavior. In contrast, since
manifestations of mental illness may be sudden, past behavior may not
be an adequate predictor of future actions. A higher standard for the
mentally ill is also justified on the ground that, in general, their treatment is much more intrusive than that received by the mentally retarded. Pp. 321-328.

(c) There is also a rational basis for Kentucky to allow immediate
family members and guardians to participate as parties in proceedings
to commit the mentally retarded but not the mentally ill. Kentucky
could rationally conclude that close relatives and guardians may have
intimate knowledge of the subject's abilities and experiences which provides valuable insights that should be considered during the involuntary
commitment process. By contrast, mental illness may arise only after
minority, when the afflicted person's immediate family members have
ceased to provide care and support, and the proper course of treatment
may depend on matters not related to observations made in a household
setting. In addition, adults previously of sound mental health who are
diagnosed as mentally ill may have a need for privacy that justifies
confining a commitment proceeding to the smallest group possible.
Whether Kentucky could have chosen a less-restrictive means than
party status for achieving its legislative end is irrelevant in rationalbasis review. Pp. 328-330.

3. Allowing close relatives and legal guardians to participate as
parties does not violate due process. Consideration of the factors set
out in Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319, 335--the private interest that
will be affected, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest,
and the government's interest--compels this conclusion. Rather than
increasing the risk of an erroneous deprivation, allowing close relatives
and guardians to participate as parties actually increases a proceeding's
accuracy by putting valuable information before the court. It also
implements the State's interest in providing family members a voice
in such proceedings. And even if they favor commitment, their participation does not undermine the interest of the individual facing
commitment. The only individual interest that is protected by the

Opinion of the Court
a final commitment hearing, the applicable burden of prooffor involuntary commitment based on mental retardation

is clear and convincing evidence, Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann.$ 202B.160(2) (Michie 1991), while the standard for involuntary commitment based on mental illness is beyond a rea-sonable doubt, $ 202A.076(2). Second, in commitment proceedings for mental retardation, unlike for mental illness,"[g]uardians and immediate family members" of the subject
of the proceedings "may participate . . . as if a party to theproceedings," with all attendant rights, including the right
to present evidence and to appeal. $ 202B.160(3). Respond-ents are a class of mentally retarded persons committed
involuntarily to Kentucky institutions. They argue thatthese distinctions are irrational and violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. They claimalso that granting close family members and guardians the
status of parties violates the Due Process Clause. Wereject these contentions and hold the Kentucky statutes
constitutional. I

This case has a long and complicated history. It beganin 1982 when respondents filed suit against petitioner, the
Kentucky Secretary of the Cabinet for Human Resources,claiming that Kentucky's failure to provide certain procedural protections before institutionalizing people on the basisof mental retardation violated the Constitution. Kentucky
has amended its civil commitment statutes several timessince 1982, with each new statute being attacked in court by
respondents. As the previous incarnations of this lawsuithave little effect on the issues currently before this Court,
we limit our discussion to the current round of the litigation.See Doe v. Cowherd, 770 F. Supp. 354, 355-356 (WD Ky. 1991)
(recounting the procedural history).At issue here are elements of Kentucky's statutory procedures, enacted in 1990, for the involuntary commitment ofthe mentally retarded. In many respects the procedures

Opinion of the Court
governing commitment of the mentally retarded and the
mentally ill are parallel. The statutes recognize a large
class of persons who can petition for an individual's involuntary commitment, whether on grounds of mental retardation or mental illness. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 202B.100(3)
(Michie 1991) (mental retardation); $ 202A.051 (mental illness). Upon filing of the petition, the trial court must appoint counsel to represent the individual in question, unless
he retains private counsel. $ 202B.210 (mental retardation);

$ 202A.121 (mental illness). The trial court also must examine the person who filed the petition and, if there is probable
cause to believe that the individual who is the subject of the
petition should be involuntarily committed, the court must
order his examination by two qualified professionals.

$$ 202B.100(5), (6)(c) (mental retardation); $$ 202A.051(5),
(6)(c) (mental illness). The subject of the proceeding has the
right to retain a professional of his own choosing, who may
"witness and participate in any examination" of him.

$ 202B.140 (mental retardation); $ 202A.066 (mental illness).
In cases of commitment for mental retardation, a professional retained by the subject's "parent or guardian" also
must be permitted to witness and participate in any examination. $ 202B.140.

If both qualified professionals certify that the individual
meets the criteria for involuntary commitment, the trial
court must conduct a preliminary hearing. $ 202B.130 (mental retardation); $ 202A.061 (mental illness). At the hearing,
the court must receive as evidence the reports of these two
professionals and any other professional retained under the
statute. $ 202B.160(1) (mental retardation); $ 202A.076(1)
(mental illness). The individual whose commitment is
sought may testify and may call and cross-examine witnesses. $ 202B.160(1) (mental retardation); $ 202A.076(1)
(mental illness). In cases of mental retardation, at both the
preliminary hearing and, if there is one, the final hearing,

Opinion of the Court
Kentucky law provides particular rights to guardians andimmediate family members:

"Guardians and immediate family members of the re-spondent shall be allowed to attend all hearings, conferences or similar proceedings; may be representedby private counsel, if desired; may participate in the
hearings or conferences as if a party to the proceedings;may cross-examine witnesses if desired; and shall have
standing to appeal any adverse decision." $ 202B.160(3)
See also $ 202B.230. If the trial court determines that there
is probable cause to believe that the subject should beinvoluntarily committed, it proceeds to a final hearing.

$ 202B.100(8) (mental retardation); $ 202A.051(9) (mentalillness).

At the final hearing, the State, through the county attorney for the county in which the person subject to the pro-ceeding lives, prosecutes the petition, $ 202B.019 (mental retardation); $ 202A.016 (mental illness); Tr. of Oral Arg. 33-35,and counsel for the person defends against institutionalization, id., at 31, 34, 54. At this hearing, "[t]he manner of pro-ceeding and the rules of evidence shall be the same as those
in any criminal proceeding." $ 202B.160(2) (mental retarda-tion); $ 202A.076(2) (mental illness). As in the preliminary
hearing, the subject of the proceedings may testify and call
and cross-examine witnesses. $ 202B.160(2) (mental retar-dation); $ 202A.076(2) (mental illness). In proceedings for

commitment based on mental retardation, the standard ofproof is clear and convincing evidence, $ 202B.160(2); for mental illness, the standard is proof beyond a reasonable doubt,

$ 202A.076(2). For commitment of the mentally retarded,
four propositions must be proved by clear and convincing
evidence: "(1) The person is a mentally retarded person; (2)
The person presents a danger or a threat of danger to self,
family, or others; (3) The least restrictive alternative mode
of treatment presently available requires placement in [a

Opinion of the Court
residential treatment center]; and (4) Treatment that canreasonably benefit the person is available in [a residential

treatment center]." $ 202B.040. The criteria for commit-ment of the mentally ill are in substance identical, requiring proof beyond a reasonable doubt that an individual "is amentally ill person: (1) Who presents a danger or threat of
danger to self, family or others as a result of the mentalillness; (2) Who can reasonably benefit from treatment; and
(3) For whom hospitalization is the least restrictive alter-native mode of treatment presently available." $ 202A.026.
Appeals from involuntary commitment proceedings aretaken in the same manner as other appeals from the trial
court. $ 202B.230 (mental retardation); $ 202A.141 (mentalillness).

After enactment of the 1990 modifications, respondentsmoved for summary judgment in their pending lawsuit
against petitioner. They argued, among other things, thatthe differences in treatment between the mentally retarded
and the mentally ill--the different standards of proof and theright of immediate family members and guardians to participate as parties in commitment proceedings for the mentallyretarded but not the mentally ill--violated the Equal Protection Clause's prohibition of distinctions that lack a rationalbasis, and that participation by family members and guardians violated the Due Process Clause. The District Courtfor the Western District of Kentucky accepted these arguments and granted summary judgment to respondents onthese and other grounds not at issue here, 770 F. Supp. 354
(1991), and the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit af-firmed, Doe v. Cowherd, 965 F. 2d 109 (1992). We granted
Kentucky's petition for certiorari, 506 U. S. 939 (1992), andnow reverse.

II
Respondents contend that, in evaluating the constitution-ality of the distinctions drawn by Kentucky's statutes, we

should apply not rational-basis review, but some form of

Opinion of the Court
heightened scrutiny. Brief for Respondents 23-32. Thisclaim is not properly presented. Respondents argued before the District Court and the Court of Appeals only thatKentucky's statutory scheme was subject to rational-basis
review, and the courts below ruled on that ground. Indeed,respondents have conceded that they pressed their heightened scrutiny argument for the first time in their meritsbrief in this Court.

Id., at 23 ("[R]espondents did notargue this particular issue below . . ."). Even if respondents

were correct that heightened scrutiny applies, it would beinappropriate for us to apply that standard here. Both parties have been litigating this case for years on the theory ofrational-basis review, which, as noted below, see

infra, at 320,does not require the State to place any evidence in the record, let alone the extensive evidentiary showing that wouldbe required for these statutes to survive heightened scrutiny.
It would be imprudent and unfair to inject a new standardat this stage in the litigation. See Tennessee v. Dunlap, 426
U. S. 312, 316, n. 3 (1976); Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425U. S. 185, 215 (1976). We therefore decide this case as it has
been presented to the courts whose judgments are beingreviewed.

III
We many times have said, and but weeks ago repeated,that rational-basis review in equal protection analysis "is not

a license for courts to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic oflegislative choices." FCC v. Beach Communications, Inc.,
508 U. S. 307, 313 (1993). See also, e. g., Dandridge v. Wil-liams, 397 U. S. 471, 486 (1970). Nor does it authorize "the
judiciary [to] sit as a superlegislature to judge the wisdomor desirability of legislative policy determinations made in
areas that neither affect fundamental rights nor proceedalong suspect lines."

New Orleans v. Dukes, 427 U. S. 297,303 (1976) (per curiam). For these reasons, a classification

neither involving fundamental rights nor proceeding alongsuspect lines is accorded a strong presumption of validity.

Opinion of the Court
See, e. g., Beach Communications, supra, at 314-315;
Kadrmas v. Dickinson Public Schools, 487 U. S. 450, 462
(1988); Hodel v. Indiana, 452 U. S. 314, 331-332 (1981); Massachusetts Bd. of Retirement v. Murgia, 427 U. S. 307, 314
(1976) (per curiam). Such a classification cannot run afoul
of the Equal Protection Clause if there is a rational relation-ship between the disparity of treatment and some legitimate

governmental purpose. See, e. g., Nordlinger v. Hahn, 505U. S. 1, 11 (1992);

Dukes, supra, at 303. Further, a legislature that creates these categories need not "actually articu-late at any time the purpose or rationale supporting its classification." Nordlinger, supra, at 15. See also, e. g., United
States Railroad Retirement Bd. v. Fritz, 449 U. S. 166, 179
(1980); Allied Stores of Ohio, Inc. v. Bowers, 358 U. S. 522,
528 (1959). Instead, a classification "must be upheld against
equal protection challenge if there is any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for
the classification." Beach Communications, supra, at 313.
See also, e. g., Nordlinger, supra, at 11; Sullivan v. Stroop,
496 U. S. 478, 485 (1990); Fritz, supra, at 174-179; Vance v.
Bradley, 440 U. S. 93, 111 (1979); Dandridge v. Williams,
supra, at 484-485.

A State, moreover, has no obligation to produce evidence
to sustain the rationality of a statutory classification. "[A]
legislative choice is not subject to courtroom factfinding and
may be based on rational speculation unsupported by evidence or empirical data." Beach Communications, supra,
at 315. See also, e. g., Vance v. Bradley, supra, at 111;
Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp., 426 U. S. 794, 812 (1976);
Locomotive Firemen v. Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co., 393 U. S.
129, 139 (1968). A statute is presumed constitutional, see
supra, at 319, and "[t]he burden is on the one attacking the
legislative arrangement to negative every conceivable basis
which might support it," Lehnhausen v. Lake Shore Auto
Parts Co., 410 U. S. 356, 364 (1973) (internal quotation marks
omitted), whether or not the basis has a foundation in the

record. Finally, courts are compelled under rational-basisreview to accept a legislature's generalizations even when

there is an imperfect fit between means and ends. A classi-fication does not fail rational-basis review because it " `is not
made with mathematical nicety or because in practice it re-sults in some inequality.' "

Dandridge v. Williams, supra,at 485, quoting Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co., 220

U. S. 61, 78 (1911). "The problems of government arepractical ones and may justify, if they do not require,
rough accommodations--illogical, it may be, and unscien-tific." Metropolis Theatre Co. v. Chicago, 228 U. S. 61, 69-70
(1913). See also, e. g., Burlington Northern R. Co. v. Ford,504 U. S. 648, 651 (1992);

Vance v. Bradley, supra, at 108,and n. 26; New Orleans v. Dukes, supra, at 303; Schweiker

v. Wilson, 450 U. S. 221, 234 (1981). We have appliedrational-basis review in previous cases involving the mentally retarded and the mentally ill. See Cleburne v. Cle-burne Living Center, Inc., 473 U. S. 432 (1985); Schweiker v.
Wilson, supra. In neither case did we purport to apply adifferent standard of rational-basis review from that just
described.True, even the standard of rationality as we so often have
defined it must find some footing in the realities of the sub-ject addressed by the legislation. That requirement is satisfied here. Kentucky has proffered more than adequatejustifications for the differences in treatment between the
mentally retarded and the mentally ill.

A
Kentucky argues that a lower standard of proof in commit-ments for mental retardation follows from the fact that mental retardation is easier to diagnose than is mental illness.That general proposition should cause little surprise, for
mental retardation is a developmental disability that be-comes apparent before adulthood. See American Psychiatric Assn., Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Dis509us2107J 05-09-97 08:14:00 PAGES OPINPGT

Retardation: Definition, Classification, and Systems of Sup-port 5, 16-18 (9th ed. 1992) (hereinafter Mental Retardation);
S. Brakel, J. Parry, & B. Weiner, The Mentally Disabled andthe Law 16-17, 37 (3d ed. 1985) (hereinafter Mentally Disabled); Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 202B.010(9) (Michie 1991). Bythe time the person reaches 18 years of age the documentation and other evidence of the condition have been accumu-lated for years. Mental illness, on the other hand, may be
sudden and may not occur, or at least manifest itself, untiladulthood. See,

e. g., Manual of Mental Disorders 190 (onsetof schizophrenia may occur any time during adulthood);

id.,at 220, 229 (onset of depression usually is during adulthood).

Furthermore, as we recognized in an earlier case, diagnosisof mental illness is difficult. See Addington v. Texas, 441
U. S. 418, 430 (1979). See also Mentally Disabled 18. Ken-tucky's basic premise that mental retardation is easier to diagnose than is mental illness has a sufficient basis in fact.See,

e. g., id., at 16; Ellis & Luckasson, Mentally RetardedCriminal Defendants, 53 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 414, 438-439

(1985).This difference between the two conditions justifies Kentucky's decision to assign a lower standard of proof in com-mitment proceedings involving the mentally retarded. In
assigning the burden of proof, Kentucky was determiningthe "risk of error" faced by the subject of the proceedings.
Addington v. Texas, supra, at 423. If diagnosis is more dif-ficult in cases of mental illness than in instances of mental
retardation, a higher burden of proof for the former tends toequalize the risks of an erroneous determination that the
subject of a commitment proceeding has the condition inquestion.

1 See G. Keppel, Design and Analysis 65-68 (1973).

1 Justice Souter suggests that this description of the function of burdens of proof is inconsistent with Addington v. Texas, 441 U. S. 418 (1979).
See post, at 339-341 (dissenting opinion). His reasoning, however, would

323Cite as: 509 U. S. 312 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
From the diagnostic standpoint alone, Kentucky's differen-tial burdens of proof (as well as the other statutory distinction at issue, see infra, at 328-329) are rational.There is, moreover, a "reasonably conceivable state of
facts," Beach Communications, 508 U. S., at 313, from whichKentucky could conclude that the second prerequisite to
commitment--that "[t]he person presents a danger or athreat of danger to self, family, or others," Ky. Rev. Stat.
Ann. $ 202B.040 (Michie 1991)--is established more easily, asa general rule, in the case of the mentally retarded. Previous instances of violent behavior are an important indicatorof future violent tendencies. See,

e. g., J. Monahan, TheClinical Prediction of Violent Behavior 71-72 (1981) (hereinafter Monahan); Kozol, Boucher, & Garofalo, The Diagnosisand Treatment of Dangerousness, 18 Crime & Delinquency
371, 384 (1972). Mental retardation is a permanent, relatively static condition, see Mentally Disabled 37, so a deter-mination of dangerousness may be made with some accuracy

based on previous behavior. We deal here with adults only,
so almost by definition in the case of the retarded there isan 18-year record upon which to rely.

This is not so with the mentally ill. Manifestations ofmental illness may be sudden, and past behavior may not
be an adequate predictor of future actions. Prediction offuture behavior is complicated as well by the difficulties inimpose the due process conception of burdens of proof on a State's policy
decision as to which standard is most appropriate in the circumstances.
The Due Process Clause sets the minimum standard of proof required in
particular contexts, based on consideration both of the respective interests
of the State and individual and of the risk of erroneous decisions. Addington, supra, at 425. A State is free to adopt any burden of proof that
meets or exceeds the constitutional minimum required by due process, and
a State may select a standard of proof based on any rational policy of its
choice. It may seek, as Justice Souter would require, to balance the
respective interests of the affected parties. See post, at 339. But it may
also calibrate its standard of proof in an effort to establish the risk of
error at a certain level.

herent in diagnosis of mental illness. Developments in theLaw--Civil Commitment of the Mentally Ill, 87 Harv. L. Rev.

1190, 1242-1243 (1974). It is thus no surprise that manypsychiatric predictions of future violent behavior by the
mentally ill are inaccurate. See, e. g., Steadman, Employing Psychiatric Predictions of Dangerous Behavior: Policyvs. Fact, in Dangerous Behavior: A Problem in Law and

Mental Health 123, 125-128 (C. Frederick ed. 1978); Monahan47-49. For these reasons, it would have been plausible for
Kentucky to conclude that the dangerousness determinationwas more accurate as to the mentally retarded than the mentally ill.

A statutory classification fails rational-basis review only
when it " `rests on grounds wholly irrelevant to the achievement of the State's objective.' " Holt Civic Club v. Tuscaloosa, 439 U. S. 60, 71 (1978), quoting McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U. S. 420, 425 (1961). See also, e. g., McDonald v.
Board of Election Comm'rs of Chicago, 394 U. S. 802, 809
(1969); Kotch v. Board of River Port Pilot Comm'rs for Port
of New Orleans, 330 U. S. 552, 556 (1947). Because ease of
diagnosis is relevant to two of the four inquiries, it is not
"wholly irrelevant" to the achievement of Kentucky's objective, and thus the statutory difference in the applicable burden of proof survives rational-basis review. In any event, it
is plausible for Kentucky to have found that, for purposes
of determining the acceptable risk of error, diagnosis and
dangerousness are the most critical factors in the commitment decision, so the appropriate burden of proof should be
tied to them.

There is a further, more far-reaching rationale justifying
the different burdens of proof: The prevailing methods of
treatment for the mentally retarded, as a general rule, are
much less invasive than are those given the mentally ill.
The mentally ill are subjected to medical and psychiatric
treatment which may involve intrusive inquiries into the patient's innermost thoughts, see Meissner & Nicholi, The Psy509us2107J 05-09-97 08:14:00 PAGES OPINPGT

Amicus Curiae in Washington v.
Harper, O. T. 1988, No. 88-599, pp. 10-11. By contrast, thementally retarded in general are not subjected to these medical treatments. Rather, " `because mental retardation is . . .a learning disability and training impairment rather than an
illness,' " Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U. S. 307, 309, n. 1 (1982),
quoting Brief for American Psychiatric Association as Amicus Curiae in Youngberg v. Romeo, O. T. 1981, No. 80-1429,
p. 4, n. 1, the mentally retarded are provided "habilitation,"
which consists of education and training aimed at improving
self-care and self-sufficiency skills. See Youngberg, supra,
at 309, n. 1; M. Rosen, G. Clark, & M. Kivitz, Habilitation of
the Handicapped 47-59 (1977); Mentally Disabled 332.

It is true that the loss of liberty following commitment for
mental illness and mental retardation may be similar in
many respects; but the different treatment to which a committed individual is subjected provides a rational basis for
Kentucky to decide that a greater burden of proof is needed
before a person may be committed for mental illness. The
procedures required before the government acts often depend on the nature and extent of the burden or deprivation
to be imposed. See Addington v. Texas, 441 U. S., at 423-
424. For example, because confinement in prison is punitive
and hence more onerous than confinement in a mental hospital, id., at 428, the Due Process Clause subjects the former
to proof beyond a reasonable doubt, In re Winship, 397 U. S.
358 (1970), whereas it requires in the latter case only clear
and convincing evidence, Addington v. Texas, supra. It
may also be true that some persons committed for mental
retardation are subjected to more intrusive treatments while

326 HELLER v. DOE

Opinion of the Court
confined. See post, at 342-346 (Souter, J., dissenting).
Nonetheless, it would have been plausible for the Kentucky
Legislature to believe that most mentally retarded individuals who are committed receive treatment that is different
from, and less invasive than, that to which the mentally ill
are subjected. "States are not required to convince the
courts of the correctness of their legislative judgments."
Minnesota v. Clover Leaf Creamery Co., 449 U. S. 456, 464
(1981). Thus, since " `the question is at least debatable,' "
Western & Southern Life Ins. Co. v. State Bd. of Equalization of Cal., 451 U. S. 648, 674 (1981), quoting United States
v. Carolene Products Co., 304 U. S. 144, 154 (1938), rationalbasis review permits a legislature to use just this sort of
generalization.

These distinctions may explain, too, the differences in
treatment between the mentally retarded and the mentally
ill that have long existed in Anglo-American law. At English common law there was a "marked distinction" in the
treatment accorded "idiots" (the mentally retarded) and "lunatics" (the mentally ill). 1 F. Pollock & F. Maitland, The
History of English Law 481 (2d ed. 1909) (hereinafter Pollack
and Maitland). As Blackstone explained, a retarded person
became a ward of the King, who had a duty to preserve the
individual's estate and provide him with "necessaries," but
the King could profit from the wardship. In contrast, the
King was required to "provide for the custody and sustentation of [the mentally ill], and preserve their lands and the
profits of them," but the King was prohibited from profiting
thereby. 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *302-*304. See
Pollack and Maitland 481; S. Herr, Rights and Advocacy for
Retarded People 9-10 (1983).

Ancient lineage of a legal concept does not give it immunity from attack for lacking a rational basis. That the law
has long treated the classes as distinct, however, suggests
that there is a commonsense distinction between the men509us2107J 05-09-97 08:14:00 PAGES OPINPGT

Kentucky's burden of proof scheme, then, can be explainedby differences in the ease of diagnosis and the accuracy of

the prediction of future dangerousness and by the nature ofthe treatment received after commitment. Each of these
rationales, standing on its own, would suffice to establisha rational basis for the distinction in question.

and guardians to participate as parties in proceedings tocommit the mentally retarded but not the mentally ill. As

we have noted, see supra, at 321-322, by definition, mentalretardation has its onset during a person's developmental period. Mental retardation, furthermore, results in "deficits
or impairments in adaptive functioning," that is to say, "theperson's effectiveness in areas such as social skills, communication, and daily living skills, and how well the person meetsthe standards of personal independence and social responsibility expected of his or her age by his or her cultural group."Manual of Mental Disorders 28-29. See also Mental Retardation 5-6, 15-16, 38-41. Based on these facts, Kentucky
may have concluded that close relatives and guardians, both
of whom likely have intimate knowledge of a mentally retarded person's abilities and experiences, have valuable insights that should be considered during the involuntary commitment process.

Mental illness, by contrast, may arise or manifest itself
with suddenness only after minority, see supra, at 322, when
the afflicted person's immediate family members have no
knowledge of the medical condition and have long ceased to
provide care and support. Further, determining the proper
course of treatment may be far less dependent upon observations made in a household setting. Indeed, we have noted
the severe difficulties inherent in psychiatric diagnosis conducted by experts in the field. Addington v. Texas, 441
U. S., at 430. See also Mentally Disabled 18. In addition,
adults previously of sound mental health who are diagnosed
as mentally ill may have a need for privacy that justifies the
State in confining a commitment proceeding to the smallest
group compatible with due process. Based on these facts,
Kentucky may have concluded that participation as parties
by relatives and guardians of the mentally ill would not in
most cases have been of sufficient help to the trier of fact to
justify the additional burden and complications of granting
party status. To be sure, Kentucky could have provided rel509us2107J 05-09-97 08:14:00 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
atives and guardians of the mentally retarded some participation in commitment proceedings by methods short of providing them status as parties. That, however, is irrelevant
in rational-basis review. We do not require Kentucky to
have chosen the least restrictive means of achieving its legislative end. San Antonio Independent School Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 1, 51 (1973). As long as Kentucky "rationally advances a reasonable and identifiable governmental
objective, we must disregard" the existence of alternative
methods of furthering the objective "that we, as individuals,
perhaps would have preferred." Schweiker v. Wilson, 450
U. S., at 235.

IV

We turn now to respondents' claim that one aspect of the
involuntary commitment procedures violates procedural due
process. We note at the outset that respondents challenge
as violative of due process only those provisions of Kentucky's comprehensive involuntary commitment procedures
that allow participation in the proceedings by guardians
and immediate family members. See Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann.

$$ 202B.140, 202B.160(3), 202B.230 (Michie 1991). Respondents claim that by allowing the participation of persons
whose interests may be adverse to those of the individual
facing possible involuntary commitment, the statute "skews
the balance" against the retarded individual and therefore
imposes a burden on him. Brief for Respondents 32-36.
Both courts below apparently accepted this argument, almost without explanation. See 965 F. 2d, at 113; 770
F. Supp., at 358. In our view, the claim is without merit.

We evaluate the sufficiency of this procedural rule under
Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319 (1976). There we held
that determining the dictates of due process requires consideration of three factors:

"First, the private interest that will be affected by the
official action; second, the risk of an erroneous depriva509us2107J 05-09-97 08:14:00 PAGES OPINPGT

331Cite as: 509 U. S. 312 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
tion of such interest through the procedures used, andthe probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government's inter-est, including the function involved and the fiscal and
administrative burdens that the additional or substituteprocedural requirement would entail."

Id., at 335.

We think that application of the Mathews v. Eldridge fac-tors compels the conclusion that participation as parties by

close relatives and legal guardians is not a deprivation ofdue process. Even if parents, close family members, or legal
guardians can be said in certain instances to have interests"adverse to [those of] the person facing commitment," 965
F. 2d, at 113, we simply do not understand how their partici-pation as formal parties in the commitment proceedings increases "the risk of an erroneous deprivation," 424 U. S., at335, of respondents' liberty interest. Rather, for the reasons explained, supra, at 329, these parties often will havevaluable information that, if placed before the court, will increase the accuracy of the commitment decision. Kentuckylaw, moreover, does not allow intervention by persons who
lack a personal stake in the outcome of the adjudication.Guardians have a legal obligation to further the interests of
their wards, and parents and other close relatives of a men-tally retarded person, after living with and caring for the
individual for 18 years or more, have an interest in his wel-fare that the State may acknowledge. See

Parham v. J. R.,442 U. S. 584, 602-603 (1979). For example, parents who for

18 years or longer have cared for a retarded child can facechanged circumstances resulting from their own advancing
age, when the physical, emotional, and financial costs of car-ing for the adult child may become too burdensome for the
child's best interests to be served by care in their home.There is no support whatever in our cases or our legal tradition for the "statist notion," id., at 603, that the State's ex-pertise and concern in these matters is so superior to that of
parents and other close family members that the State must

Opinion of the Court
slam the courthouse door against those interested enough tointervene. Finally, "the state has a legitimate interest

under its parens patriae powers in providing care to its citi-zens who are unable . . . to care for themselves," as well as
"authority under its police power to protect the community"
from any dangerous mentally retarded persons. Addington, 441 U. S., at 426.

To be sure, if the additional parties involved in the pro-ceedings favor commitment, their participation may increase

the chances that the result of the proceeding will be a deci-sion to commit. That fact, however, is beside the point.
"The Due Process Clause does not . . . require a State toadopt one procedure over another on the basis that it may
produce results more favorable to" the party challenging the
existing procedures. Medina v. California, 505 U. S. 437,451 (1992).

"The function of legal process, as that concept is embodied in the Constitution, and in the realm of factfinding,
is to minimize the risk of erroneous decisions. Becauseof the broad spectrum of concerns to which the term

must apply, flexibility is necessary to gear the processto the particular need; the quantum and quality of the
process due in a particular situation depend upon theneed to serve the purpose of minimizing the risk of
error." Greenholtz v. Inmates of Neb. Penal and Correctional Complex, 442 U. S. 1, 13 (1979).

See also Fuentes v. Shevin, 407 U. S. 67, 97 (1972) (due proc-ess functions to "prevent unfair and mistaken deprivations").

At least to the extent protected by the Due Process Clause,
the interest of a person subject to governmental action is in
the accurate determination of the matters before the court,
not in a result more favorable to him. So long as the accuracy of the adjudication is unaffected, therefore, the Due
Process Clause does not prevent a State from allowing the
intervention of immediate family members and legal guard509us2107J 05-09-97 08:14:00 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
ians, even if in some instances these parties will have inter-ests adverse to those of the subject of the proceedings. Neither respondents nor their amici have suggested thataccuracy would suffer from the intervention allowed by Kentucky law, and as noted above we think quite the oppositeis true.

Because allowing guardians and immediate family mem-bers to participate as parties in commitment proceedings increases the accuracy of those proceedings and implementsthe State's interest in providing family members a voice in
the proceedings, without undermining those interests of theindividual protected by the Due Process Clause, these Kentucky statutes do not run afoul of due process. "We dealhere with issues of unusual delicacy, in an area where professional judgments regarding desirable procedures are con-stantly and rapidly changing. In such a context, restraint is
appropriate on the part of courts called upon to adjudicatewhether a particular procedural scheme is adequate under
the Constitution." Smith v. Organization of Foster Families for Equality & Reform, 431 U. S. 816, 855-856 (1977).

V
In sum, there are plausible rationales for each of the statu-tory distinctions challenged by respondents in this case. It

could be that "[t]he assumptions underlying these rationales[are] erroneous, but the very fact that they are `arguable' is
sufficient, on rational-basis review, to `immunize' the [legisla-tive] choice from constitutional challenge."

U. S., at 112.4

4 Under a previous version of Kentucky's laws relating to the commitment of the mentally retarded, application by the parents or guardian of a
mentally retarded person for placement in a mental retardation treatment
center was treated as a voluntary commitment to which the procedural
requirements of involuntary commitments were inapplicable. See Ky.

I agree with Justice Souter that Kentucky's differentialstandard of proof for committing the mentally ill and the
mentally retarded is irrational and therefore join Part II ofhis opinion. I conclude, however, that there is a rational
basis for permitting close relatives and guardians to partici-pate as parties in proceedings to commit the mentally retarded but not the mentally ill. As the Court points out,there are sufficiently plausible and legitimate reasons for the
legislative determination in this area. I also agree with theCourt that allowing guardians and immediate family members to participate as parties in commitment proceedingsdoes not violate procedural due process. Like my colleagues, I would not reach the question whether heightenedequal protection scrutiny should be applied to the Kentucky scheme.

Justice Blackmun, dissenting.
I join Justice Souter's dissenting opinion, for I agreewith him that this statute is not even rational. I write sepadecision, the Court of Appeals held that persons committed upon application of parents or guardians must be considered to have been admitted
involuntarily. Doe v. Austin, 848 F. 2d 1386, 1391-1392 (CA6 1988). We
denied Kentucky's petition for certiorari from this decision, 488 U. S. 967
(1988), and Kentucky subsequently amended its statutes to remove this
provision. In its brief, however, Kentucky again attacks this prior holding of the Court of Appeals. See Brief for Petitioner 20-28. Even were
this issue not mooted by the repeal of the provision at issue, see, e. g.,
Department of Treasury v. Galioto, 477 U. S. 556, 559-560 (1986); Kremens v. Bartley, 431 U. S. 119, 128-129 (1977), it is not "fairly included"

Foucha v. Louisiana, 504 U. S. 71, 84-86 (1992) (pluralityopinion of

Justice Souter, with whom Justice Blackmun and
Justice Stevens join, and with whom Justice O'Connorjoins as to Part II, dissenting.

Because I conclude that Kentucky's provision of differentprocedures for the institutionalization of the mentally retarded and the mentally ill is not supported by any rationaljustification, I respectfully dissent.

I
To begin with, the Court declines to address Doe's argu-ment that we should employ strict or heightened scrutiny

in assessing the disparity of treatment challenged here.1

1 Doe relies, first, on the nature of the right at stake, citing our decision
last Term in Foucha v. Louisiana, 504 U. S. 71 (1992). There we were
faced with an equal protection challenge to a Louisiana statute authorizing
continued commitment of currently sane insanity acquittees under standards that were not applied to criminal convicts who had completed their
prison terms or were about to do so. The insanity acquittee was kept
incarcerated in a mental institution unless he could prove he was not
dangerous, see La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 657 (West Supp. 1993),
whereas "Louisiana law," as Justice White wrote, did "not provide for
similar confinement for other classes of persons who have committed criminal acts and who cannot later prove they would not be dangerous. Criminals who have completed their prison terms, or are about to do so, are an
obvious and large category of such persons . . . . However, state law does
not allow for th[e] continuing confinement [of criminals who may be unable
to prove they would not be dangerous] based merely on dangerousness.
. . . Freedom from physical restraint being a fundamental right, the State
must have a particularly convincing reason, which it has not put forward,

Souter, J., dissenting
While I may disagree with the Court's basis for its conclusion
that this argument is not "properly presented," ante, at 319,
I too would decline to address the contention that strict or
heightened scrutiny applies. I conclude that the distinctions wrought by the Kentucky scheme cannot survive even
that rational-basis scrutiny, requiring a rational relationship

for such discrimination against insanity acquittees who are no longer mentally ill." Foucha, 504 U. S., at 85-86 (plurality opinion of White, J.,
joined by Blackmun, Stevens, and Souter, JJ.); see also id., at 88
(O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) ("Although
I think it unnecessary to reach equal protection issues on the facts before
us, the permissibility of holding an acquittee who is not mentally ill longer
than a person convicted of the same crimes could be imprisoned is open
to serious question"). Because of the " `massive curtailment of liberty' "
undoubtedly involved in involuntary civil commitment and institutionalization, see Vitek v. Jones, 445 U. S. 480, 491 (1980) (quoting Humphrey v.
Cady, 405 U. S. 504, 509 (1972)), Doe argues that heightened scrutiny applies under Foucha when those alleged to be mentally retarded are denied
the protection afforded another "obvious and large category" of potential
civil committees, those said to be mentally ill.

Doe also argues that the discrimination here has a second aspect that
justifies application of strict or heightened scrutiny, in its classification on
the basis of mental retardation. Although he recognizes that this Court
held in 1985 that retarded individuals are not a quasi-suspect class, see
Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc., 473 U. S. 432, 442-447 (1985),
he argues that the subsequently enacted Americans With Disabilities Act
of 1990 (ADA) amounts to an exercise of Congress's power under $ 5 of the
Fourteenth Amendment to secure the guarantees of the Equal Protection
Clause to the disabled. See Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U. S. 641, 651
(1966). The ADA includes findings that people with disabilities (among
whom are included those with mental impairments that Doe argues include mental retardation, see 42 U. S. C. $ 12102(2)(A) (1988 ed., Supp. III))
"are a discrete and insular minority who have been faced with restrictions
and limitations, subjected to a history of purposeful unequal treatment,
and relegated to a position of political powerlessness in our society . . . ."

$ 12101(a)(7). Doe argues that this and other findings, together with expressions of purpose contained in the ADA, amount to a clear indication
from Congress "that all individuals with disabilities, including individuals
with mental retardation should be treated as a suspect class." Brief for
Respondents 29-30.

between the disparity of treatment and some legitimategovernmental purpose, which we have previously applied to

a classification on the basis of mental disability, see Cleburnev. Cleburne Living Center, Inc., 473 U. S. 432, 446-447
(1985), and therefore I need not reach the question ofwhether scrutiny more searching than

Cleburne's should beapplied.
2 Cleburne was the most recent instance in which

we addressed a classification on the basis of mental disability,as we did by enquiring into record support for the State's

proffered justifications, and examining the distinction intreatment in light of the purposes put forward to support it.
See id., at 450. While the Court cites Cleburne once, anddoes not purport to overrule it, neither does the Court apply
it, and at the end of the day Cleburne's status is left uncer-tain. I would follow

Cleburne here.

II
Obviously there are differences between mental retarda-tion and mental illness. They are distinct conditions, they

have different manifestations, they require different formsof care or treatment, and the course of each differs. It is
without doubt permissible for the State to treat those whoare mentally retarded differently in some respects from
those who are mentally ill. The question here, however, iswhether some difference between the two conditions ration2 This approach complies with "two of the cardinal rules governing the
federal courts: one, never to anticipate a question of constitutional law in
advance of the necessity of deciding it; the other never to formulate a rule
of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which
it is to be applied," Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472 U. S. 491, 501
(1985) (citations, internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted), and is
consistent with our past practice. See, e. g., Hooper v. Bernalillo County
Assessor, 472 U. S. 612, 618 (1985) (declining to decide whether to apply
heightened scrutiny where classification failed rational-basis test); cf. Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U. S. 718, 724, n. 9 (1982) (declining
to decide whether to apply strict scrutiny where classification could not
survive heightened scrutiny).

ally can justify the particular disparate treatment accorded
under this Kentucky statute.

The first distinction wrought by the statute is the imposition of a lesser standard of proof for involuntary institutionalization where the alleged basis of a need for confinement
is mental retardation rather than mental illness. As the
Court observes, four specific propositions must be proven before a person may be involuntarily institutionalized on the
basis of mental retardation: "that: (1) [t]he person is a mentally retarded person; (2) [t]he person presents a danger or
a threat of danger to self, family, or others; (3) [t]he least
restrictive alternative mode of treatment presently available
requires placement in [a state-run institution]; and (4) [t]reatment that can reasonably benefit the person is available in
[a state-run institution]." Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 202B.040
(Michie 1991). At issue in this case is only the application
of this provision to adults who have not been shown to be
mentally retarded, but who are simply alleged to be. The
subject of such a proceeding retains as full an interest in
liberty as anyone else. The State of Kentucky has deemed
this liberty interest so precious that, before one may be institutionalized on the basis of mental illness, the statutory
prerequisites must be shown "beyond a reasonable doubt."

$ 202A.076(2).3 However, when the allegation against the
individual is one of mental retardation, he is deprived of the
protection of that high burden of proof. The first question
here, then, is whether, in light of the State's decision to provide that high burden of proof in involuntary commitment

3 As the Court notes, the statutory prerequisites are substantially identical for commitment on the basis of illness and retardation. Commitment
on the ground of mental illness requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt
that an individual "is a mentally ill person: (1) [w]ho presents a danger or
threat of danger to self, family or others as a result of the mental illness;
(2) [w]ho can reasonably benefit from treatment; and (3) [f]or whom hospitalization is the least restrictive alternative mode of treatment presently
available." Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 202A.026 (Michie 1991).

proceedings where illness is alleged, there is somethingabout mental retardation that can rationally justify provision

of less protection.In upholding this disparate treatment, the Court relies
first on the State's assertion that mental retardation is easier
to diagnose than mental illness. It concludes that the dis-crimination in burdens of proof is rational because the lessened " `risk of error' " resulting from the higher burden ofproof, see

ante, at 322 (quoting Addington v. Texas, 441 U. S.
418, 423 (1979)), can be understood to offset a greater "ris[k]of an erroneous determination that the subject of a commitment proceeding has the condition in question" when the allegation is one of mental illness rather than mental retardation, ante, at 322. The Court reaches essentially the same
conclusion with respect to the second prerequisite, that the
individual present a danger or threat of danger to himself or
others. See ante, at 324 (a determination of dangerousness
may be made with "more accura[cy]" with respect to the
mentally retarded than the mentally ill).

In concluding, however, that the demands of minimal rationality are satisfied if burdens of proof rise simply with
difficulties of proof, the Court misunderstands the principal
object in setting burdens. It is no coincidence that difficult
issues in civil cases are not subject to proof beyond a reasonable doubt and that even the most garden variety elements
in criminal cases are not to be satisfied by a preponderance
of evidence. The reason for this is that burdens of proof are
assigned and risks of error are allocated not to reflect the
mere difficulty of avoiding error, but the importance of
avoiding it as judged after a thorough consideration of those
respective interests of the parties that will be affected by
the allocation. See Addington, 441 U. S., at 425.

In a civil commitment proceeding, on the State's side of
the balance, are the interests of protecting society from
those posing dangers and protecting the ill or helpless individual from his own incapacities. Id., at 426. On the other

side, it is clear that "[i]n cases involving individual rights,whether criminal or civil, `[t]he standard of proof [at a minimum] reflects the value society places on individual liberty,' "id., at 425 (brackets in original and citation omitted), which
encompasses both freedom from restraint and freedom fromthe stigma that restraint and its justifications impose on an
institutionalized person, id., at 425-426.The question whether a lower burden of proof is rationally
justified, then, turns not only on whether ease of diagnosisand proof of dangerousness differ as between cases of illness
and retardation, but also on whether there are differences inthe respective interests of the public and the subjects of the
commitment proceedings, such that the two groups subjectto commitment can rationally be treated differently by imposing a lower standard of proof for commitment of theretarded.

4 The answer is clearly that they cannot. While

difficulty of proof, and of interpretation of evidence, couldlegitimately counsel against setting the standard so high that

the State may be unable to satisfy it (thereby effectivelythwarting efforts to satisfy legitimate interests in protection, care, and treatment), see id., at 429, that would at mostjustify a lower standard in the allegedly more difficult cases
of illness, not in the easier cases of retardation. We do notlower burdens of proof merely because it is easy to prove the
proposition at issue, nor do we raise them merely because itis difficult.

5 Nor do any other reasonably conceivable facts

4 In addition to the two prerequisites mentioned in the text, the State
must also prove that commitment would be beneficial and the least restrictive alternative method of treatment. The Court does not contend that
there is any rational justification for imposition of a lowered burden of
proof with respect to these prerequisites for institutionalization in those
cases where the allegation is one of retardation and not illness. See ante,
at 324.

5 And indeed, to the extent Addington v. Texas, 441 U. S. 418 (1979),

does discuss the difficulty of diagnosing mental illness, see id., at 429-430,
it supports use only of a lesser standard of proof because of the practical
problems created by a supposed "serious question as to whether a state

cut in favor of the distinction in treatment drawn by theKentucky statute. Both the ill and the retarded may be

dangerous, each may require care, and the State's interestis seemingly of equal strength in each category of cases.
No one has or would argue that the value of liberty variessomehow depending on whether one is alleged to be ill or
retarded, and a mentally retarded person has as much tolose by civil commitment to an institution as a mentally ill
counterpart, including loss of liberty to "choos[e] his ownfriends and companions, selec[t] daily activities, decid[e] what
to eat, and retai[n] a level of personal privacy," among otherthings. Brief for American Association on Mental Retardation (AAMR) et al. as Amici Curiae 12 (AAMR Br.). Wedo not presume that a curtailment of the liberty of those who
are disabled is, because of their disability, less severe thanthe same loss to those who are ill. Even if the individuals
subject to involuntary commitment proceedings previouslyhad been shown to be mentally retarded, they would thus
still retain their "strong," legally cognizable interest in theirliberty. Cf.

Foucha, 504 U. S., at 88 (O'Connor, J., concur-ring in part and concurring in judgment). Even assuming,

then, that the assertion of different degrees of difficulty ofproof both of mental illness and mental retardation and of
the dangerousness inherent in each condition is true (an as-sertion for which there is no support in the record), it lends
not a shred of rational support to the decision to discriminateagainst the retarded in allocating the risk of erroneous curtailment of liberty.The Court also rests its conclusion on the view that "it
would have been plausible for the Kentucky Legislature tobelieve that most mentally retarded individuals who are

could ever prove beyond a reasonable doubt that an individual is both
mentally ill and likely to be dangerous," id., at 429. Of course, in this
case Kentucky has determined that the liberty of those alleged to be mentally ill is sufficiently precious that the State should assume the risk inherent in use of that higher standard.

committed receive treatment that is . . . less invasive tha[n]that to which the mentally ill are subjected."

Ante, at 326.
Nothing cited by the Court, however, demonstrates that sucha belief would have been plausible for the Kentucky Legislature, nor does the Court's discussion render it plausible now.
Cf. United States Railroad Retirement Bd. v. Fritz, 449 U. S.166, 179 (1980) (under rational-basis scrutiny disparate treatment must be justified by "plausible reasons"). One exam-ple of the invasiveness to which the Court refers is the use
of (and the results of the administration of) psychotropicdrugs. I take no exception to the proposition that they are
extensively used in treating mental illness. See ante, at
325 (citing authorities for the proposition that drugs are
used in treating mental illness). Nor do I except to the
proposition that the appropriate and perhaps characteristic
response to mental retardation, but not to mental illness, is
that kind of training in the necessities of self-sufficiency
known as "habilitation." See ibid. (citing authorities describing such training).

Neither of these propositions tells us, however, that the
same invasive mind-altering medication prescribed for mental illness is not also used in responding to mental retardation. And in fact, any apparent plausibility in the Court's
suggestion that "the mentally retarded in general are not
subjected to th[is] medical treatmen[t]," ibid., dissipates the
moment we examine readily available material on the subject, including studies of institutional practices affecting the
retarded comparable to those studies concerning the treatment of mental illness cited by the Court. One recent examination of institutions for the mentally retarded in Kentucky's neighboring State of Missouri, for example, found
that 76% of the institutionalized retarded receive some type
of psychoactive drug and that fully 54% receive psychotropic
drugs. See Intagliata & Rinck, Psychoactive Drug Use in
Public and Community Residential Facilities for Mentally
Retarded Persons, 21 Psychopharmacology Bull. 268, 272-

273 (1985). Another study, this one national in scope, foundthat 38% of the residents of institutions for the mentally retarded receive psychotropic drugs. See Hill, Balow, & Bru-ininks, A National Study of Prescribed Drugs in Institutions
and Community Residential Facilities for Mentally Retarded
People, 21 Psychopharmacology Bull. 279, 283 (1985). "Sur-veys conducted within institutions [for the mentally retarded] have generally shown prevalences in the range of30% to 50% of residents receiving psychotropic drugs at any
given time." Aman & Singh, Pharmacological Intervention,in Handbook of Mental Retardation 347, 348 (J. Matson & J.
Mulick eds., 2d ed. 1991) (hereinafter Handbook of Mental
Retardation).

Psychotropic drugs, according to the available material,
are not only used to treat the institutionalized retarded, but
are often misused. Indeed, the findings of fact by a United
States District Court in North Carolina, another State
nearby Kentucky, show that in three hospitals, 73% of persons committed as mentally retarded were receiving antipsychotic drugs. Less than half of these individuals had been
diagnosed as mentally ill as well as mentally retarded following their commitment on the latter ground. See Thomas S.
v. Flaherty, 699 F. Supp. 1178, 1187 (WDNC 1988), aff 'd, 902
F. 2d 250 (CA4), cert. denied, 498 U. S. 951-952 (1990). The
District Court found that the institutionalized retarded
plaintiffs "have been seriously endangered and injured by
the inappropriate use of antipsychotic drugs." Flaherty,

Medications for Institutionalized Mentally Retarded Per-sons, 90 Am. J. Mental Deficiency 363 (1986) (finding that

between 39% and 54% of medications prescribed to men-tally retarded persons are inappropriate for the conditions
diagnosed).

These facts are consistent with a law review study ofdrugs employed in treating retardation, which observed that

the reduction in the need for institutional staff resultingfrom the use of sedating drugs has promoted drug use in
responding to retardation despite "frightening adverse ef-fects [including the suppression of] learning and intellectual
development." Plotkin & Gill, Invisible Manacles: Drugging
Mentally Retarded People, 31 Stan. L. Rev. 637, 638 (1979).
There being nothing in the record to suggest that Kentucky's
institutions are free from these practices, and no reason
whatever to assume so, there simply is no plausible basis
for the Court's assumption that the institutional response to
mental retardation is in the main less intrusive in this way
than treatment of mental illness.

The Court also suggests that medical treatment for the
mentally retarded is less invasive than in the case of the
mentally ill because the mentally ill are subjected to psychiatric treatment that may involve intrusive enquiries into the
patient's innermost thoughts. See ante, at 324-325. Again,
I do not disagree that the mentally ill are often subject to intrusive psychiatric therapy. But the mentally retarded too
are subject to intrusive therapy, as the available material on
the medical treatment of the mentally retarded demonstrates.
The mentally retarded are often subjected to behavior modification therapy to correct, among other things, anxiety disorders, phobias, hyperactivity, and antisocial behavior, therapy
that may include aversive conditioning as well as forced exposure to objects that trigger severe anxiety reactions. See

Handbook of Mental Retardation 397-412; Gardner, Use ofBehavior Therapy with the Mentally Retarded, in Psychiatric Approaches to Mental Retardation 250-275 (F. Menolas-cino ed. 1970). Like drug therapy, psychiatric therapy for
the mentally retarded can be, and has been, misused. In
one recent case, a Federal District Court found that "aver-sive procedures [including seclusion and physical restraints

were] being inappropriately used with no evidence for theireffectiveness and no relationship between the choice of the
procedure and the analysis of the cause of the problem[,] . . .plac[ing] clients at extreme risk for maltreatment."

supra, at 413-423;
Mulick, Hammer, & Dura, supra, at 397-412.

The same sorts of published authorities on which the
Court relies, in sum, refute the contention that "[t]he prevailing methods of treatment for the mentally retarded, as a
general rule, are much less invasive than are those given the
mentally ill." Ante, at 324.6 The available literature indicates that psychotropic drugs and invasive therapy are routinely administered to the retarded as well as the mentally

6 I also see little point in the Court's excursion into the historical difference in treatment between so-called "idiots," and so-called "lunatics."
See ante, at 326. Surely the Court does not intend to suggest that the
irrational and scientifically unsupported beliefs of pre-19th-century England can support any distinction in treatment between the mentally ill
and the mentally retarded today. At that time, "lunatics" were "[s]een as
demonically possessed or the products of parental sin [and] were often
punished or left to perish." See S. Herr, Rights and Advocacy for Retarded People 9 (1983). The primary purpose of an adjudication of "idiocy" appears to have been to "depriv[e] [an individual] of [his] property
and its profits." Id., at 10. Those without wealth "were dealt with like
other destitute or vagrant persons through workhouses and houses of
correction." Id., at 11.

ill, and there are no apparent differences of therapeutic re-gimes that would plausibly explain less rigorous commitment

standards for those alleged to be mentally retarded than forthose alleged to be mentally ill.

7

III
With respect to the involvement of family members andguardians in the commitment proceeding, the Court holds it

to be justified by the fact that mental retardation "has itsonset during a person's developmental period," while mental
illness "may arise or manifest itself with suddenness onlyafter minority."

Ante, at 329. The Court suggests that amentally ill person's parents may have "ceased to provide

care and support" for him well before the onset of illness,whereas parents are more likely to have retained connection
with a retarded son or daughter, whose "proper course oftreatment" may depend on matters related to "observations
made in a household setting." Ibid.These suggested distinctions, if true, would apparently not
apply to guardians, whose legal obligations to protect thepersons and estates of their wards would seem to require as
much connection to the one class of people as to the other.

7 Petitioner also argues that mental retardation is different from most
cases of mental illness in being a permanent condition that may require a
lifetime of care. See Brief for Petitioner 31. But petitioner completely
fails to explain how the permanence of the condition or the likely need of
lifetime care can rationally justify a regime in which those alleged to require institutionalization based on mental retardation face a greater risk
of erroneous curtailment of liberty than those who are alleged to require
it based on mental illness. The distinction proffered by the State (accepting it to be factually accurate and not based merely on stereotype) cuts
quite the other way. The possibility that a condition once thought to justify commitment will last a lifetime suggests that a person committed to
an institution on the basis of mental retardation is less likely to regain
his liberty than one institutionalized on some other basis. If this could
rationally justify any disparity in commitment standards, it could only be
in requiring stricter protection in mental retardation cases than in those
based on mental illness, not the other way around.

Souter, J., dissenting
In any event, although these differences might justify a
scheme in which immediate relatives and guardians were automatically called as witnesses in cases seeking institutionalization on the basis of mental retardation,8 they are completely unrelated to those aspects of the statute to which
Doe objects: permitting these immediate relatives and
guardians to be involved "as parties" so as to give them,
among other things, the right to appeal as "adverse" a decision not to institutionalize the individual who is subject to
the proceedings. Where the third party supports commitment, someone who is alleged to be retarded is faced not only
with a second advocate for institutionalization, but with a
second prosecutor with the capacity to call and crossexamine witnesses, to obtain expert testimony and to raise
an appeal that might not otherwise be taken, whereas a person said to require commitment on the basis of mental illness
is not. This is no mere theoretical difference, and my suggestion that relatives or guardians may support curtailment
of liberty finds support in the record in this case. It indicates that of the 431 commitments to Kentucky's state-run
institutions for the mentally retarded during a period between 1982 and the middle of 1985, all but one were achieved
through the application or consent of family members or
guardians. See Record, State's Answers to Plaintiff 's First
Set of Interrogatories 2, 17.

The Court simply points to no characteristic of mental retardation that could rationally justify imposing this burden
of a second prosecutor on those alleged to be mentally retarded where the State has decided not to impose it upon
those alleged to be mentally ill. Even if we assumed a generally more regular connection between the relatives and
guardians of those alleged to be retarded than those said to

8 Of course both guardians and relatives can already act as witnesses
in each kind of proceeding subject only to the limitations of relevance
and interest.

be mentally ill, it would not explain why the former shouldbe subject to a second prosecutor when the latter are not.

The same may be said about the Court's second suggestedjustification, that the mentally ill may have a need for privacy not shown by the retarded. Even assuming the ill needsome additional privacy, and that participation of others in
the commitment proceeding should therefore be limited "tothe smallest group compatible with due process,"

ante, at329, why should the retarded be subject to a second prosecutor? The Court provides no answer.9Without plausible justification, Kentucky is being allowed
to draw a distinction that is difficult to see as resting onanything other than the stereotypical assumption that the
retarded are "perpetual children," an assumption that hashistorically been taken to justify the disrespect and "grotesque mistreatment" to which the retarded have been sub-jected. See

Cleburne, 473 U. S., at 454 (Stevens, J., con-curring) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).

As we said in Cleburne, the mentally retarded are not "allcut from the same pattern: . . . they range from those whose
disability is not immediately evident to those who must beconstantly cared for." Id., at 442. In recent times, at least
when imposing the responsibilities of citizenship, our juris-prudence has seemed to reject the analogy between mentally retarded adults and nondisabled children. See, e. g.,
Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302, 338 (1989) (controlling opin-ion of

O'Connor, J.) (not "all mentally retarded people . . .--by virtue of their mental retardation alone, and apart from

any individualized consideration of their personal responsi-bility--inevitably lack the cognitive, volitional, and moral capacity to act with the degree of culpability associated withthe death penalty"); see also id., at 340 ("reliance on mental

9 I also note that the Court provides no support for its speculation that
an adult who develops mental illness will have a greater need or desire
for privacy in an involuntary commitment proceeding than an adult who
is mentally retarded.

effect if applied in other areas of the law"). But cf. ante, at331 (citing Parham v. J. R., 442 U. S. 584 (1979), a case about
parents' rights over their minor children). When the Stateof Kentucky sets up its respective schemes for institutionalization on the basis of mental illness and mental retardation,it too is obliged to reject that analogy, and to rest any difference in standards for involuntary commitment as betweenthe ill and the retarded on some plausible reason.

IV
In the absence of any rational justification for the dispar-ate treatment here either with respect to the burdens of

proof or the participation of third parties in institutionaliza-tion proceedings, I would affirm the judgment of the Court
of Appeals. Because of my conclusion, that the statute vio-lates equal protection, I do not reach the question of its validity under the Due Process Clause.

JOHNSON v. TEXAS
certiorari to the court of criminal appeals of texas

No. 92-5653. Argued April 26, 1993--Decided June 24, 1993
A jury found petitioner Johnson guilty of capital murder for a crime he

committed when he was 19 years old. In conformity with the Texas
capital sentencing statute then in effect, the trial court instructed the
jury during the trial's penalty phase to answer two special issues: (1)
whether Johnson's conduct was committed deliberately and with the reasonable expectation that death would result, and (2) whether there was
a probability that he would commit criminal acts of violence that would
constitute a continuing threat to society. The jury was also instructed,
inter alia, that in determining each of these issues, it could take into
consideration all the evidence submitted to it, whether aggravating or
mitigating, in either phase of the trial. A unanimous jury answered
yes to both special issues, and the trial court sentenced Johnson to
death, as required by law. Shortly after the State Court of Criminal
Appeals affirmed the conviction and sentence, this Court issued Penry
v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302. In denying Johnson's motion for rehearing,
the state appellate court rejected his contentions that the special issues
did not allow his jury to give adequate mitigating effect to evidence
of his youth and that Penry required a separate instruction on the
question.

Held: The Texas procedures as applied in this case were consistent with

the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments under this Court's precedents. Pp. 359-373.

(a) A review of the Court's relevant decisions demonstrates the constitutional requirements regarding consideration of mitigating circumstances by sentencers in capital cases. Although the sentencer cannot
be precluded from considering, as a mitigating factor, any aspect of the
defendant's character or record and any of the circumstances of the particular offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less
than death, see, e. g., Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586, 604 (plurality opinion); Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104, States are free to structure
and shape consideration of mitigating evidence in an effort to achieve a
more rational and equitable administration of the death penalty, see,
e. g., Boyde v. California, 494 U. S. 370, 377. Pp. 359-362.

(b) The Texas law under which Johnson was sentenced has been the
principal concern of a series of opinions in this Court. Although, in
Jurek v. Texas, 428 U. S. 262, 276, 277, six Justices agreed that, as a

509us2108K 05-04-97 17:51:50 PAGES OPINPGT

351Cite as: 509 U. S. 350 (1993)
Syllabus
general matter, the special issues system satisfied the foregoing constitutional requirements, the Court later held, in Penry v. Lynaugh, supra,
that the system did not allow for sufficient consideration of the defendant's mitigating evidence of his mental retardation and childhood abuse
in light of his particular circumstances, id., at 320-323, and that the trial
court erred in not instructing the jury that it could consider and give
effect to that mitigating evidence by declining to impose the death penalty, id., at 328. However, the Court concluded that it was not creating
a new rule, and characterized its holding as a straightforward application of Jurek, Lockett, and Eddings, making it clear that these cases
can stand together with Penry, see 492 U. S., at 314-318. The Court
confirmed this limited view of Penry and its scope in Graham v. Collins,
506 U. S. 461, 474, and held that the defendant's mitigating evidence of
his youth, family background, and positive character traits was not
placed beyond the jury's effective reach by the Texas scheme, id., at
475. Pp. 362-366.

(c) The Texas special issues allowed adequate consideration of Johnson's youth. There is no reasonable likelihood, see Boyde, supra, at
380, that Johnson's jury would have found itself foreclosed from considering the relevant aspects of his youth, since it received the second
special issue instruction and was told to consider all mitigating evidence.
That there is ample room in the future dangerousness assessment for a
juror to take account of youth as a mitigating factor is what distinguishes this case from Penry, supra, at 323. There, the second special
issue did not allow the jury to give mitigating effect to expert medical
testimony that the defendant's mental retardation prevented him from
learning from experience, since that evidence could only logically be
considered within the future dangerousness inquiry as an aggravating
factor. In contrast, youth's ill effects are subject to change as a defendant ages and, as a result, are readily comprehended as a mitigating
factor in consideration of the second special issue. Because such consideration is a comprehensive inquiry that is more than a question of historical fact, the Court rejects Johnson's related arguments that the second
special issue's forward-looking perspective and narrowness prevented
the jury from, respectively, taking account of how his youth bore upon
his personal culpability and making a "reasoned moral response" to the
evidence of his youth. For the Court to find a constitutional defect in
Johnson's sentence, it would have to overrule Jurek by requiring a further instruction whenever a defendant introduced mitigating evidence
that had some arguable relevance beyond the special issues; alter the
rule of Lockett and Eddings to require that a jury be able to give effect
to mitigating evidence in every conceivable manner in which it might be

Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.
For the second time this Term, we consider a constitu-tional challenge to the former Texas capital sentencing system. Like the condemned prisoner in Graham v. Collins,506 U. S. 461 (1993), the petitioner here claims that the Texas
special issues system in effect until 1991 did not allow hisjury to give adequate mitigating effect to evidence of his
youth. Graham was a federal habeas corpus proceedingwhere the petitioner had to confront the rule of Teague v.
Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989), barring the application of newrules of law on federal habeas corpus. In part because the
relief sought by Graham would have required a new rulewithin the meaning of

Teague, we denied relief. The instantcase comes to us on direct review of petitioner's conviction

and sentence, so we consider it without the constraints ofTeague, though of course with the customary respect for the

Petitioner, then 19 years of age, and his companion,Amanda Miles, decided to rob Allsup's convenience store in

Snyder, Texas, on March 23, 1986. After agreeing thatthere should be no witnesses to the crime, the pair went to
the store to survey its layout and, in particular, to determinethe number of employees working in the store that evening.
They found that the only employee present during the pre-dawn hours was a clerk, Jack Huddleston. Petitioner and
Miles left the store to make their final plans.They returned to Allsup's a short time later. Petitioner,
a handgun in his pocket, reentered the store with Miles.After waiting for other customers to leave, petitioner asked
Huddleston whether the store had any orange juice in onegallon plastic jugs because there were none on the shelves.
Saying he would check, Huddleston went to the store'scooler. Petitioner followed Huddleston there, told Huddleston the store was being robbed, and ordered him to lie onthe floor. After Huddleston complied with the order and
placed his hands behind his head, petitioner shot him in theback of the neck, killing him. When petitioner emerged
from the cooler, Miles had emptied the cash registers ofabout $160. They each grabbed a carton of cigarettes and
fled.In April 1986, a few weeks after this crime, petitioner was
arrested for a subsequent robbery and attempted murder ofa store clerk in Colorado City, Texas. He confessed to the
murder of Jack Huddleston and the robbery of Allsup's andwas tried and convicted of capital murder. The homicide
qualified as a capital offense under Texas law because peti-tioner intentionally or knowingly caused Huddleston's death

After the jury determined that petitioner was guilty of
capital murder, a separate punishment phase of the proceedings was conducted in which petitioner's sentence was determined. In conformity with the Texas capital sentencing
statute then in effect, see Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art.
37.071(b) (Vernon 1981),1 the trial court instructed the jury
that it was to answer two special issues:

that the death of the deceased or another would result?. . . . .

"[(2)] Is there a probability that the Defendant, Dorsie
Lee Johnson, Jr., would commit criminal acts of violence
that would constitute a continuing threat to society?" 2
App. 148-149.

The trial court made clear to the jury the consequences of
its answers to the special issues:

"You are further instructed that if the jury returns
affirmative or `yes' answer [sic] to all the Issues submitted, this Court shall sentence the Defendant to death.
If the jury returns a negative or `no' answer to any Issue
submitted, the Court shall sentence the Defendant to
life in prison." Id., at 146.

1 The Texas Legislature amended the statute in 1991. See Art.
37.071(2) (Vernon Supp. 1992-1993).

2 The statute also required that a third special issue, asking whether the

defendant's act was "unreasonable in response to the provocation, if any,
by the deceased," be submitted to the jury "if raised by the evidence."
Art. 37.071(b)(3) (Vernon 1981). Petitioner does not contest the trial
court's decision not to submit the third special issue in this case.

Opinion of the Court
The jury was instructed not to consider or discuss the possi-bility of parole.

Id., at 147. The trial court also instructed
the jury as follows concerning its consideration of mitigat-ing evidence:

"In determining each of these Issues, you may takeinto consideration all the evidence submitted to you in
the trial of this case, whether aggravating or mitigatingin nature, that is, all the evidence in the first part of the
trial when you were called upon to determine the guiltor innocence of the Defendant and all the evidence, if
any, in the second part of the trial wherein you are
called upon to determine the answers to the SpecialIssues."

Ibid.

Although petitioner's counsel filed various objections to the
jury charge, there was no request that a more expansive
instruction be given concerning any particular mitigatingcircumstance, including petitioner's youth.

In anticipation of the trial court's instructions, the Stateduring the punishment phase of the proceedings presented
numerous witnesses who testified to petitioner's violenttendencies. The most serious evidence related to the April
convenience store robbery in Colorado City. Witnesses tes-tified that petitioner had shot that store clerk in the face,
resulting in the victim's permanent disfigurement and brain
damage. Other witnesses testified that petitioner had firedtwo shots at a man outside a restaurant in Snyder only six

days after the murder of Huddleston, and a sheriff 's deputywho worked in the jail where petitioner was being held testified that petitioner had threatened to "get" the deputy when
he got out of jail.

Petitioner's acts of violence were not limited to strangers.
A longtime friend of petitioner, Beverly Johnson, testified
that in early 1986 petitioner had hit her, thrown a large rock
at her head, and pointed a gun at her on several occasions.
Petitioner's girlfriend, Paula Williams, reported that, after

509us2108K 05-04-97 17:51:50 PAGES OPINPGT
356 JOHNSON v. TEXAS

Opinion of the Court
petitioner had become angry with her one afternoon in 1986,he threatened her with an axe. There were other incidents,

of less gravity, before 1986. One of petitioner's classmatestestified that petitioner cut him with a piece of glass while
they were in the seventh grade. Another classmate testifiedthat petitioner also cut him with glass just a year later, and
there was additional evidence presented that petitioner hadstabbed a third classmate with a pencil.

The State established that the crimes committed in 1986were not petitioner's first experience with the criminal justice system. Petitioner had been convicted in 1985 of a storeburglary in Waco, Texas. Petitioner twice violated the
terms of probation for that offense by smoking marijuana.Petitioner was still on probation when he committed the
Huddleston murder.The defense presented petitioner's father, Dorsie Johnson,
Sr., as its only witness. The elder Johnson attributed hisson's criminal activities to his drug use and his youth.
When asked by defense counsel whether his son at the age of19 was "a real mature person," petitioner's father answered:

"No, no. Age of nineteen? No, sir. That, also, I findto be a foolish age. That's a foolish age. They tend to
want to be macho, built-up, trying to step into manhood.You're not mature-lized for it."

Id., at 27.

At the close of his testimony, Johnson summarized the rolethat he thought youth had played in his son's crime:

"[A]ll I can say is I still think that a kid eighteen ornineteen years old has an undeveloped mind, undeveloped sense of assembling not--I don't say what is rightor wrong, but the evaluation of it, how much, you know,
that might be--well, he just don't--he just don't evalu-ate what is worth--what's worth and what's isn't like he
should like a thirty or thirty-five year old man would.He would take under consideration a lot of things that a
younger person that age wouldn't." Id., at 47.

357Cite as: 509 U. S. 350 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
The father also testified that his son had been a regularchurchgoer and his problems were attributable in large part

to the death of his mother following a stroke in 1984 andthe murder of his sister in 1985. Finally, the senior Johnson
testified to his son's remorse over the killing of Huddleston.At the voir dire phase of the proceedings, during which
more than 90 prospective jurors were questioned over thecourse of 15 days, petitioner's counsel asked the venirepersons whether they believed that people were capable ofchange and whether the venirepersons had ever done things
as youths that they would not do now. See, e. g., Tr. of VoirDire in No. 5575 (132d Jud. Dist. Ct., Scurry County, Tex.),
pp. 1526-1529 (Juror Swigert); id., at 1691-1692 (Juror Free-man); id., at 2366 (Juror Witte); id., at 2630-2632 (Juror
Raborn).3 Petitioner's counsel returned to this theme in hisclosing argument:

"The question--the real question, I think, is whetheryou believe that there is a possibility that he can change.
You will remember that that was one thing every one ofyou told me you agreed--every one of you agreed with
me that people can change. If you agree that peoplecan change, then that means that Dorsie can change and
that takes question two [regarding future dangerous-ness] out of the realm of probability and into possibility,

3 The colloquy on this point between petitioner's counsel and Juror Raborn is illustrative of the discussions had with the other jurors:

"Q. Okay. Do you feel that--let me ask you this. Do you feel a person
who is--or a young person will do things that they will not do in later
years, thirty or forty--

"A. I believe that.
"Q. Do you believe that people can change?
"A. Yes, I believe they can. I've known some that have.
"Q. Do you think that the way a person acts in the present or the past
or how he has acted in the past is an absolute indicator of what he will do
in the future, thirty or forty years down the road?

"A. No, not on down the line. Like I say, you can change." Tr. of Voir
Dire, at 2630-2631.

you see, because if he can change, then it is no longerprobable that he will do these things, but only possible

that he can and will do these things, you see."If people couldn't change, if you could say I know
people cannot change, then you could say probably. Butevery one of you knows in your heart and in your mind
that people can and people do change and Dorsie John-son can change and, therefore, the answer to question
two should be no." App. 81.
Counsel also urged the jury to remember the testimony ofpetitioner's father. Id., at 73-74.

The jury was instructed that the State bore the burden ofproving each special issue beyond a reasonable doubt. Id.,
at 145. A unanimous jury found that the answer to bothspecial issues was yes, and the trial court sentenced petitioner to death, as required by law. Tex. Code Crim. Proc.Ann., Art. 37.071(e) (Vernon 1981).

On appeal, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals affirmedthe conviction and sentence after rejecting petitioner's seven
allegations of error, none of which involved a challenge tothe punishment-phase jury instructions. 773 S. W. 2d 322
(1989). Five days after that state court ruling, we issuedour opinion in

Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302 (1989). Peti-tioner filed a motion for rehearing in the Texas Court of

Criminal Appeals arguing, among other points, that the spe-cial issues did not allow for adequate consideration of his
youth. Citing Penry, petitioner claimed that a separate in-struction should have been given that would have allowed
the jury to consider petitioner's age as a mitigating factor.Although petitioner had not requested such an instruction at
trial and had not argued the point prior to the rehearingstage on appeal, no procedural bar was interposed. Instead,
the Court of Criminal Appeals considered the argument onthe merits and rejected it. After noting that it had already
indicated in Lackey v. State, 819 S. W. 2d 111, 134 (Tex. Crim.App. 1989), that youth was relevant to the jury's consider509us2108K 05-04-97 17:51:50 PAGES OPINPGT

ation of the second special issue, the court reasoned that "[i]f
a juror believed that [petitioner's] violent actions were a result of his youth, that same juror would naturally believe
that [petitioner] would cease to behave violently as he grew
older." App. 180. The court concluded that "the jury was
able to express a reasoned moral response to [petitioner's]
mitigating evidence within the scope of the art. 37.071 instructions given to them by the trial court." Id., at 180-181.

Petitioner filed a petition for certiorari, which we granted.
506 U. S. 1090 (1993).

II

A

This is the latest in a series of decisions in which the Court
has explained the requirements imposed by the Eighth and
Fourteenth Amendments regarding consideration of mitigating circumstances by sentencers in capital cases. The earliest case in the decisional line is Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S.
238 (1972). At the time of Furman, sentencing juries had
almost complete discretion in determining whether a given
defendant would be sentenced to death, resulting in a system
in which there was "no meaningful basis for distinguishing
the few cases in which [death was] imposed from the many
cases in which it [was] not." Id., at 313 (White, J., concurring). Although no two Justices could agree on a single rationale, a majority of the Court in Furman concluded that
this system was "cruel and unusual" within the meaning
of the Eighth Amendment. The guiding principle that
emerged from Furman was that States were required to
channel the discretion of sentencing juries in order to avoid
a system in which the death penalty would be imposed in
a "wanto[n]" and "freakis[h]" manner. Id., at 310 (Stewart,
J., concurring).

Four Terms after Furman, we decided five cases, in opinions issued on the same day, concerning the constitutionality
of various capital sentencing systems. Gregg v. Georgia,

509us2108K 05-04-97 17:51:50 PAGES OPINPGT
360 JOHNSON v. TEXAS

Opinion of the Court
428 U. S. 153 (1976); Proffitt v. Florida, 428 U. S. 242 (1976);
Jurek v. Texas, 428 U. S. 262 (1976); Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U. S. 280 (1976); Roberts v. Louisiana, 428 U. S.
325 (1976). In the wake of Furman, at least 35 States had
abandoned sentencing schemes that vested complete discretion in juries in favor of systems that either (i) "specif[ied]
the factors to be weighed and the procedures to be followed
in deciding when to impose a capital sentence," or (ii)
"ma[de] the death penalty mandatory for certain crimes."
Gregg, supra, at 179-180 (opinion of Stewart, Powell, and
Stevens, JJ.). In the five cases, the controlling joint opinion of three Justices reaffirmed the principle of Furman that
"discretion must be suitably directed and limited so as to
minimize the risk of wholly arbitrary and capricious action."
428 U. S., at 189; accord, Proffitt, supra, at 258 (opinion of
Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.).

Based upon this principle, it might have been thought that
statutes mandating imposition of the death penalty if a defendant was found guilty of certain crimes would be consistent with the Constitution. But the joint opinions of Justices
Stewart, Powell, and Stevens indicated that there was a
second principle, in some tension with the first, to be considered in assessing the constitutionality of a capital sentencing
scheme. According to the three Justices, "consideration of
the character and record of the individual offender and the
circumstances of the particular offense [is] a constitutionally
indispensable part of the process of inflicting the penalty of
death." Woodson, supra, at 304 (plurality opinion); accord,
Gregg, supra, at 189-190, n. 38 (opinion of Stewart, Powell,
and Stevens, JJ.); Jurek, supra, at 273-274 (opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.); Roberts, supra, at 333 (plurality opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.). Based
upon this second principle, the Court struck down mandatory
imposition of the death penalty for specified crimes as inconsistent with the requirements of the Eighth and Fourteenth

361Cite as: 509 U. S. 350 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
Amendments. See Woodson, supra, at 305; Roberts, supra,
at 335-336.

Two Terms later, a plurality of the Court in Lockett v.
Ohio, 438 U. S. 586 (1978), refined the requirements related
to the consideration of mitigating evidence by a capital
sentencer. Unlike the mandatory schemes struck down in
Woodson and Roberts in which all mitigating evidence was
excluded, the Ohio system at issue in Lockett permitted a
limited range of mitigating circumstances to be considered
by the sentencer.4 The plurality nonetheless found this
system to be unconstitutional, holding that "the Eighth and
Fourteenth Amendments require that the sentencer . . . not
be precluded from considering, as a mitigating factor, any
aspect of a defendant's character or record and any of the
circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a
basis for a sentence less than death." 438 U. S., at 604. A
majority of the Court adopted the Lockett rule in Eddings
v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104 (1982); accord, Hitchcock v. Dugger, 481 U. S. 393, 398-399 (1987); Skipper v. South Carolina,
476 U. S. 1, 4 (1986), and we have not altered the rule's central requirement. "Lockett and its progeny stand only for
the proposition that a State may not cut off in an absolute
manner the presentation of mitigating evidence, either by
statute or judicial instruction, or by limiting the inquiries to
which it is relevant so severely that the evidence could never
be part of the sentencing decision at all." McKoy v. North
Carolina, 494 U. S. 433, 456 (1990) (Kennedy, J., concurring

4 Once an Ohio defendant was found guilty of aggravated murder involving at least one of seven aggravating circumstances, the judge was required to sentence the defendant to death unless at least one of three
mitigating circumstances was present: (1) the victim induced or facilitated
the offense; (2) it is unlikely the crime would have been committed but for
the fact that the defendant was acting under duress, coercion, or strong
provocation; or (3) the offense was primarily the product of the defendant's
psychosis or mental deficiency. See Lockett, 438 U. S., at 607-608.

in judgment); see also Graham, 506 U. S., at 475; Saffle v.Parks, 494 U. S. 484, 490-491 (1990).

Although Lockett and Eddings prevent a State from plac-ing relevant mitigating evidence "beyond the effective reach
of the sentencer," Graham, supra, at 475, those cases andothers in that decisional line do not bar a State from guiding
the sentencer's consideration of mitigating evidence. In-deed, we have held that "there is no . . . constitutional requirement of unfettered sentencing discretion in the jury,and States are free to structure and shape consideration of
mitigating evidence `in an effort to achieve a more rationaland equitable administration of the death penalty,' "

California, 494 U. S. 370, 377 (1990) (quoting Franklin v.Lynaugh, 487 U. S. 164, 181 (1988) (plurality opinion)); see

also Saffle, supra, at 490. B

The Texas law under which petitioner was sentenced hasbeen the principal concern of four previous opinions in our
Court. See Jurek v. Texas, supra; Franklin v. Lynaugh,supra; Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302 (1989); Graham,
supra. As we have mentioned, Jurek was included in thegroup of five cases addressing the post-Furman statutes in
1976.In

Jurek, the joint opinion of Justices Stewart, Powell, and
Stevens first noted that there was no constitutional defi-ciency in the means used to narrow the group of offenders

subject to capital punishment, the statute having adoptedfive different classifications of murder for that purpose. See
Jurek, 428 U. S., at 270-271. Turning to the mitigation sideof the sentencing system, the three Justices said: "[T]he constitutionality of the Texas procedures turns on whether theenumerated [special issues] allow consideration of particularized mitigating factors." Id., at 272. In assessing the con-stitutionality of the mitigation side of this scheme, the three
Justices examined in detail only the second special issue,which asks whether " `there is a probability that the defend509us2108K 05-04-97 17:51:50 PAGES OPINPGT

363Cite as: 509 U. S. 350 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
ant would commit criminal acts of violence that would consti-tute a continuing threat to society.' " Although the statute

did not define these terms, the joint opinion noted that theTexas Court of Criminal Appeals had indicated that it would
interpret the question in a manner that allowed the defendant to bring all relevant mitigating evidence to the jury'sattention:

" `In determining the likelihood that the defendant
would be a continuing threat to society, the jury couldconsider whether the defendant had a significant criminal record. It could consider the range and severity of
his prior criminal conduct. It could further look to theage of the defendant and whether or not at the time of

the commission of the offense he was acting under du-ress or under the domination of another. It could also
consider whether the defendant was under an extremeform of mental or emotional pressure, something less,
perhaps, than insanity, but more than the emotions of
the average man, however inflamed, could withstand.'[

Jurek v. State,] 522 S. W. 2d [934], 939-940 [(Tex. Crim.
App. 1975)]." Id., at 272-273.

The joint opinion determined that the Texas system satisfiedthe requirements of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments

concerning the consideration of mitigating evidence: "By
authorizing the defense to bring before the jury at the sepa-rate sentencing hearing whatever mitigating circumstances

relating to the individual defendant can be adduced, Texashas ensured that the sentencing jury will have adequate
guidance to enable it to perform its sentencing function."
Id., at 276. Three other Justices agreed that the Texas
system satisfied constitutional requirements. See id., at
277 (White, J., concurring in judgment).

We next considered a constitutional challenge involving
the Texas special issues in Franklin v. Lynaugh, supra.
Although the defendant in that case recognized that we had

509us2108K 05-04-97 17:51:50 PAGES OPINPGT
364 JOHNSON v. TEXAS

Opinion of the Court
upheld the constitutionality of the Texas system as a generalmatter in

Jurek, he claimed that the special issues did not
allow the jury to give adequate weight to his mitigating evi-dence concerning his good prison disciplinary record and that

the jury, therefore, should have been instructed that it could
consider this mitigating evidence independent of the specialissues. 487 U. S., at 171-172. A plurality of the Court rejected the defendant's claim, holding that the second specialissue provided an adequate vehicle for consideration of the
defendant's prison record as it bore on his character. Id.,at 178. The plurality also noted that

Jurek foreclosed the
defendant's argument that the jury was still entitled to cast
an "independent" vote against the death penalty even if it
answered yes to the special issues. 487 U. S., at 180. The
plurality concluded that, with its special issues system, Texas
had guided the jury's consideration of mitigating evidence
while still providing for sufficient jury discretion. See id.,
at 182. Although Justice O'Connor expressed reservations about the Texas scheme for other cases, she agreed that
the special issues had not inhibited the jury's consideration
of the defendant's mitigating evidence in that case. See id.,
at 183-186 (opinion concurring in judgment).

The third case in which we considered the Texas statute
is the pivotal one from petitioner's point of view, for there
we set aside a capital sentence because the Texas special
issues did not allow for sufficient consideration of the defendant's mitigating evidence. Penry v. Lynaugh, supra. In
Penry, the condemned prisoner had presented mitigating evidence of his mental retardation and childhood abuse. We
agreed that the jury instructions were too limited for the
appropriate consideration of this mitigating evidence in light
of Penry's particular circumstances. We noted that "[t]he
jury was never instructed that it could consider the evidence
offered by Penry as mitigating evidence and that it could
give mitigating effect to that evidence in imposing sentence."
492 U. S., at 320. Absent any definition for the term "delib509us2108K 05-04-97 17:51:50 PAGES OPINPGT

365Cite as: 509 U. S. 350 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
erately," we could not "be sure that the jury was able to giveeffect to the mitigating evidence . . . in answering the first

special issue," id., at 323, so we turned to the second specialissue, future dangerousness. The evidence in the case suggested that Penry's mental retardation rendered him unable
to learn from his mistakes. As a consequence, we decidedthe mitigating evidence was relevant to the second special

issue "only as an aggravating factor because it suggestsa `yes' answer to the question of future dangerousness."
Ibid. The Court concluded that the trial court had erred innot instructing the jury that it could "consider and give effect to the mitigating evidence of Penry's mental retardation
and abused background by declining to impose the death
penalty." Id., at 328. The Court was most explicit in rejecting the dissent's concern that Penry was seeking a new
rule, in contravention of Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288
(1989). Indeed, the Court characterized its holding in Penry
as a straightforward application of our earlier rulings in
Jurek, Lockett, and Eddings, making it clear that these
cases can stand together with Penry. See Penry, 492 U. S.,
at 314-318.

We confirmed this limited view of Penry and its scope in
Graham v. Collins. There we confronted a claim by a defendant that the Texas system had not allowed for adequate
consideration of mitigating evidence concerning his youth,
family background, and positive character traits. In rejecting the contention that Penry dictated a ruling in the defendant's favor, we stated that Penry did not "effec[t] a sea
change in this Court's view of the constitutionality of the
former Texas death penalty statute," 506 U. S., at 474, and
we noted that a contrary view of Penry would be inconsistent with the Penry Court's conclusion that it was not creating a "new rule," 506 U. S., at 474. We also did not accept
the view that the Lockett and Eddings line of cases, upon
which Penry rested, compelled a holding for the defendant
in Graham:

509us2108K 05-04-97 17:51:50 PAGES OPINPGT
366 JOHNSON v. TEXAS

Opinion of the Court
"In those cases, the constitutional defect lay in the factthat relevant mitigating evidence was placed beyond the

effective reach of the sentencer. In Lockett, Eddings,Skipper, and Hitchcock, the sentencer was precluded
from even considering certain types of mitigating evi-dence. In

Penry, the defendant's evidence was placedbefore the sentencer but the sentencer had no reliable

means of giving mitigating effect to that evidence. Inthis case, however, Graham's mitigating evidence was
not placed beyond the jury's effective reach." Graham,506 U. S., at 475.

In addition, we held that Graham's case differed from Penryin that "Graham's evidence--unlike Penry's--had mitigating
relevance to the second special issue concerning his likelyfuture dangerousness." 506 U. S., at 475. We concluded
that, even with the benefit of the subsequent Penry decision,reasonable jurists at the time of Graham's sentencing "would
[not] have deemed themselves compelled to accept Graham'sclaim." 506 U. S., at 477. Thus, we held that a ruling in
favor of Graham would have required the impermissibleapplication of a new rule under

Teague. 506 U. S., at 477.

III
Today we are asked to take the step that would have beena new rule had we taken it in

Graham. Like Graham, peti-tioner contends that the Texas sentencing system did not

allow the jury to give adequate mitigating effect to the evi-dence of his youth. Unlike Graham, petitioner comes here
on direct review, so Teague presents no bar to the rule heseeks. The force of

stare decisis, though, which rests onconsiderations parallel in many respects to Teague, is applicable here. The interests of the State of Texas, and of thevictims whose rights it must vindicate, ought not to be
turned aside when the State relies upon an interpretationof the Eighth Amendment approved by this Court, absent
demonstration that our earlier cases were themselves a mis509us2108K 05-04-97 17:51:50 PAGES OPINPGT

367Cite as: 509 U. S. 350 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
interpretation of some constitutional command. See, e. g.,
Vasquez v. Hillery, 474 U. S. 254, 265-266 (1986); Arizona v.
Rumsey, 467 U. S. 203, 212 (1984).There is no dispute that a defendant's youth is a relevant

mitigating circumstance that must be within the effective
reach of a capital sentencing jury if a death sentence is tomeet the requirements of

Lockett and Eddings. See, e. g.,
Sumner v. Shuman, 483 U. S. 66, 81-82 (1987); Eddings, 455U. S., at 115;

Lockett, 438 U. S., at 608 (plurality opinion).
Our cases recognize that "youth is more than a chronologicalfact. It is a time and condition of life when a person may be

most susceptible to influence and to psychological damage."
Eddings, supra, at 115. A lack of maturity and an underdeveloped sense of responsibility are found in youth more often
than in adults and are more understandable among the
young. These qualities often result in impetuous and illconsidered actions and decisions. A sentencer in a capital
case must be allowed to consider the mitigating qualities of
youth in the course of its deliberations over the appropriate
sentence.

The question presented here is whether the Texas special
issues allowed adequate consideration of petitioner's youth.
An argument that youth can never be given proper mitigating force under the Texas scheme is inconsistent with our
holdings in Jurek, Graham, and Penry itself. The standard
against which we assess whether jury instructions satisfy
the rule of Lockett and Eddings was set forth in Boyde
v. California, 494 U. S. 370 (1990). There we held that a
reviewing court must determine "whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury has applied the challenged
instruction in a way that prevents the consideration of
constitutionally relevant evidence." Id., at 380. Although
the reasonable likelihood standard does not require that the
defendant prove that it was more likely than not that the
jury was prevented from giving effect to the evidence, the
standard requires more than a mere possibility of such a bar.

509us2108K 05-04-97 17:51:50 PAGES OPINPGT
368 JOHNSON v. TEXAS

Opinion of the Court
Ibid. In evaluating the instructions, we do not engage in a
technical parsing of this language of the instructions, but
instead approach the instructions in the same way that the
jury would--with a "commonsense understanding of the instructions in the light of all that has taken place at the trial."
Id., at 381.

We decide that there is no reasonable likelihood that the
jury would have found itself foreclosed from considering the
relevant aspects of petitioner's youth. Pursuant to the second special issue, the jury was instructed to decide whether
there was "a probability that [petitioner] would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat
to society." App. 149. The jury also was told that, in answering the special issues, it could consider all the mitigating
evidence that had been presented during the guilt and punishment phases of petitioner's trial. Id., at 147. Even on
a cold record, one cannot be unmoved by the testimony of
petitioner's father urging that his son's actions were due in
large part to his youth. It strains credulity to suppose that
the jury would have viewed the evidence of petitioner's
youth as outside its effective reach in answering the second
special issue. The relevance of youth as a mitigating factor
derives from the fact that the signature qualities of youth
are transient; as individuals mature, the impetuousness and
recklessness that may dominate in younger years can subside. We believe that there is ample room in the assessment
of future dangerousness for a juror to take account of the
difficulties of youth as a mitigating force in the sentencing
determination. As we recognized in Graham, the fact that
a juror might view the evidence of youth as aggravating, as
opposed to mitigating, does not mean that the rule of Lockett
is violated. Graham, 506 U. S., at 475-476. As long as the
mitigating evidence is within "the effective reach of the
sentencer," the requirements of the Eighth Amendment are
satisfied. Ibid.

Opinion of the Court
That the jury had a meaningful basis to consider the rele-vant mitigating qualities of petitioner's youth is what distinguishes this case from Penry. In Penry, there was expertmedical testimony that the defendant was mentally retarded
and that his condition prevented him from learning from experience. 492 U. S., at 308-309. Although the evidence ofthe mental illness fell short of providing Penry a defense to

prosecution for his crimes, the Court held that the secondspecial issue did not allow the jury to give mitigating effect
to this evidence. Penry's condition left him unable to learnfrom his mistakes, and the Court reasoned that the only logical manner in which the evidence of his mental retardation
could be considered within the future dangerousness inquiry
was as an aggravating factor. Id., at 323. Penry remains
the law and must be given a fair reading. The evidence of
petitioner's youth, however, falls outside Penry's ambit.
Unlike Penry's mental retardation, which rendered him unable to learn from his mistakes, the ill effects of youth that
a defendant may experience are subject to change and, as a
result, are readily comprehended as a mitigating factor in
consideration of the second special issue.

Petitioner does not contest that the evidence of youth
could be given some effect under the second special issue.
Instead, petitioner argues that the forward-looking perspective of the future dangerousness inquiry did not allow the
jury to take account of how petitioner's youth bore upon his
personal culpability for the murder he committed. According to petitioner, "[a] prediction of future behavior is not the
same thing as an assessment of moral culpability for a crime
already committed." Brief for Petitioner 38. Contrary to
petitioner's suggestion, however, this forward-looking inquiry is not independent of an assessment of personal culpability. It is both logical and fair for the jury to make its
determination of a defendant's future dangerousness by asking the extent to which youth influenced the defendant's conduct. See Skipper, 476 U. S., at 5 ("Consideration of a de509us2108K 05-04-97 17:51:50 PAGES OPINPGT
370 JOHNSON v. TEXAS

Opinion of the Court
fendant's past conduct as indicative of his probable futurebehavior is an inevitable and not undesirable element of

criminal sentencing"). If any jurors believed that the tran-sient qualities of petitioner's youth made him less culpable
for the murder, there is no reasonable likelihood that those
jurors would have deemed themselves foreclosed from con-sidering that in evaluating petitioner's future dangerousness.

It is true that Texas has structured consideration of the rele-vant qualities of petitioner's youth, but in so doing, the State
still "allow[s] the jury to give effect to [this] mitigating evi-dence in making the sentencing decision."

Saffle, 494 U. S.,
at 491. Although Texas might have provided other vehicles
for consideration of petitioner's youth, no additional instruction beyond that given as to future dangerousness was required in order for the jury to be able to consider the mitigating qualities of youth presented to it.

In a related argument, petitioner, quoting a portion of our
decision in Penry, supra, at 328, claims that the jurors were
not able to make a "reasoned moral response" to the evidence
of petitioner's youth because the second special issue called
for a narrow factual inquiry into future dangerousness. We,
however, have previously interpreted the Texas special
issues system as requiring jurors to "exercise a range of
judgment and discretion." Adams v. Texas, 448 U. S. 38, 46
(1980). This view accords with a "commonsense understanding" of how the jurors were likely to view their instructions and to implement the charge that they were entitled
to consider all mitigating evidence from both the trial and
sentencing phases. Boyde, 494 U. S., at 381. The crucial
term employed in the second special issue--"continuing
threat to society"--affords the jury room for independent
judgment in reaching its decision. Indeed, we cannot forget
that "a Texas capital jury deliberating over the Special Issues is aware of the consequences of its answers, and is likely
to weigh mitigating evidence as it formulates these answers
in a manner similar to that employed by capital juries in

Opinion of the Court
`pure balancing' States." Franklin, 487 U. S., at 182, n. 12(plurality opinion). In

Blystone v. Pennsylvania, 494 U. S.
299 (1990), four Members of the Court in dissent used theTexas statute as an example of a capital sentencing system

that permitted the exercise of judgment. That opinion
stated:

"[The two special issues] require the jury to do morethan find facts supporting a legislatively defined aggravating circumstance. Instead, by focusing on the delib-erateness of the defendant's actions and his future dangerousness, the questions compel the jury to make a
moral judgment about the severity of the crime and thedefendant's culpability. The Texas statute directs the

imposition of the death penalty only after the jury hasdecided that the defendant's actions were sufficiently
egregious to warrant death." Id., at 322 (Brennan, J.,dissenting).

The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals' view of the futuredangerousness inquiry supports our conclusion that consideration of the second special issue is a comprehensive inquirythat is more than a question of historical fact. In reviewing
death sentences imposed under the former Texas system,that court has consistently looked to a nonexclusive list of
eight factors, which includes the defendant's age, in deciding
whether there was sufficient evidence to support a yes an-swer to the second special issue. See,

e. g., Ellason v. State,
815 S. W. 2d 656, 660 (1991); Brasfield v. State, 600 S. W. 2d288 (1980).

There might have been a juror who, on the basis solely of
sympathy or mercy, would have opted against the death
penalty had there been a vehicle to do so under the Texas
special issues scheme. But we have not construed the Lockett line of cases to mean that a jury must be able to dispense
mercy on the basis of a sympathetic response to the defendant. Indeed, we have said that "[i]t would be very difficult

Opinion of the Court
to reconcile a rule allowing the fate of a defendant to turnon the vagaries of particular jurors' emotional sensitivities

with our longstanding recognition that, above all, capitalsentencing must be reliable, accurate, and nonarbitrary."
Saffle v. Parks, 494 U. S., at 493; see also California v.
Brown, 479 U. S. 538, 542-543 (1987) (permitting an instruc-tion that the jury could not base its sentencing decision on

sympathy).For us to find a constitutional defect in petitioner's death
sentence, we would have to alter in significant fashion thisCourt's capital sentencing jurisprudence. The first casualty
of a holding in petitioner's favor would be Jurek. The inevi-table consequence of petitioner's argument is that the Texas
special issues system in almost every case would have to
be supplemented by a further instruction. As we said in
Graham:

"[H]olding that a defendant is entitled to special instructions whenever he can offer mitigating evidence that has
some arguable relevance beyond the special issues . . .would be to require in all cases that a fourth `special

issue' be put to the jury: ` "Does any mitigating evidencebefore you, whether or not relevant to the above [three]
questions, lead you to believe that the death penaltyshould not be imposed?" ' " 506 U. S., at 476 (quoting
Franklin, supra, at 180, n. 10).
In addition to overruling Jurek, accepting petitioner's arguments would entail an alteration of the rule of Lockett and
Eddings. Instead of requiring that a jury be able to consider in some manner all of a defendant's relevant mitigating
evidence, the rule would require that a jury be able to give
effect to mitigating evidence in every conceivable manner in
which the evidence might be relevant.

The fundamental flaw in petitioner's position is its failure
to recognize that "[t]here is a simple and logical difference
between rules that govern what factors the jury must be

permitted to consider in making its sentencing decision andrules that govern how the State may guide the jury in considering and weighing those factors in reaching a decision."
Saffle, supra, at 490. To rule in petitioner's favor, we would
have to require that a jury be instructed in a manner that
leaves it free to depart from the special issues in every case.This would, of course, remove all power on the part of the

States to structure the consideration of mitigating evi-dence--a result we have been consistent in rejecting. See,
e. g., Boyde, 494 U. S., at 377; Saffle, supra, at 493; Franklin,
supra, at 181 (plurality opinion).

The reconciliation of competing principles is the functionof law. Our capital sentencing jurisprudence seeks to reconcile two competing, and valid, principles in Furman, which
are to allow mitigating evidence to be considered and to
guide the discretion of the sentencer. Our holding in Jurek
reflected the understanding that the Texas sentencing
scheme "accommodates both of these concerns." Franklin,
supra, at 182 (plurality opinion). The special issues structure in this regard satisfies the Eighth Amendment and our
precedents that interpret its force. There was no constitutional infirmity in its application here.

The judgment of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals is
affirmed.

It is so ordered.

Justice Scalia, concurring.
In my view the Lockett-Eddings principle that the sentencer must be allowed to consider "all relevant mitigating
evidence" is quite incompatible with the Furman principle
that the sentencer's discretion must be channeled. See
Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639, 656 (1990) (Scalia, J.,
concurring in part and concurring in judgment). That will
continue to be true unless and until the sort of "channeling"
of mitigating discretion that Texas has engaged in here is not
merely permitted (as the Court today holds), but positively

required--a further elaboration of our intricate EighthAmendment jurisprudence that I neither look forward to nor

would support.Today's decision, however, is simply a clarification (and I
think a plainly correct one) of this Court's opinions in Franklin v. Lynaugh, 487 U. S. 164 (1988) (plurality opinion), and
Boyde v. California, 494 U. S. 370 (1990), which I joined. In
fact, the essence of today's holding (to the effect that dis-cretion

may constitutionally be channeled) was set forth in
my dissent in Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302, 350 (1989)(

Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Accordingly, I join the opinion of the Court.

Justice Thomas, concurring.
Although Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302 (1989), "remains
the law," ante, at 369, in the sense that it has not been expressly overruled, I adhere to my view that it was wronglydecided.

Graham v. Collins, 506 U. S. 461, 478 (1993)
(Thomas, J., concurring). I also continue to believe it has
been substantially narrowed by later opinions. Id., at 497,
n. 10. Because petitioner's youth had mitigating relevance
to the second special issue, however, this case is readily distinguishable from Penry and does not compel its reconsideration. I therefore join the Court's opinion.

Justice O'Connor, with whom Justice Blackmun,
Justice Stevens, and Justice Souter join, dissenting.

Dorsie Lee Johnson was 19 years old when he committed
the murder that led to his death sentence. Today, the Court
upholds that sentence, even though the jurors who considered Johnson's case were not allowed to give full effect to
his strongest mitigating evidence: his youth. The Court
reaches this result only by invoking a highly selective
version of stare decisis and misapplying our habeas precedents to a case on direct review. Therefore, I respectfully
dissent.

I
By all accounts, Dorsie Johnson was not a model youth.As an adolescent he frequently missed school, and when he

did attend, he often was disruptive. He was drinking andusing drugs by the time he was 16, habits that had intensified
by the time he was 19. Johnson's father testified that thedeaths of Johnson's mother and sister in 1984 and 1985 had
affected Johnson deeply, but he primarily attributed John-son's behavior to drug use and youth. A jury hearing this
evidence easily could conclude, as Johnson's jury did, thatthe answer to the second Texas special question--whether it
was probable that Johnson "would commit criminal acts ofviolence that would constitute a continuing threat to society," Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 37.071(b)(2) (Vernon1981)--was yes. It is possible that the jury thought Johnson
might outgrow his temper and violent behavior as he ma-tured, but it is more likely that the jury considered the pattern of escalating violence to be an indication that Johnsonwould become even more dangerous as he grew older. Even
if the jurors viewed Johnson's youth as a transient circum-stance, the dangerousness associated with that youth would
not dissipate until sometime in the future, and it is reason-ably likely that the jurors still would have understood the
second question to require an affirmative answer. SeeGraham v. Collins, 506 U. S. 461, 519-520 (1993) (

Souter,
J., dissenting). Thus, to the extent that Johnson's youth wasrelevant at all to the second Texas special issue, there is a

reasonable likelihood that it was an aggravating factor.But even if the jury could give some mitigating effect to
youth under the second special issue, the Constitution stillwould require an additional instruction in this case. The
additional instruction would be required because not one ofthe special issues under the former Texas scheme, see Art.
37.071, allows a jury to give effect to the most relevant miti-gating aspect of youth: its relation to a defendant's "culpability for the crime he committed." Skipper v. South Caro509us2108K 05-04-97 17:51:51 PAGES OPINPGT

lina, 476 U. S. 1, 4 (1986). A violent and troubled youngperson may or may not grow up to be a violent and troubled

adult, but what happens in the future is unrelated to theculpability of the defendant at the time he committed the
crime. A jury could conclude that a young person acted "de-liberately," Art. 37.071(b)(1), and that he will be dangerous
in the future, Art. 37.071(b)(2), yet still believe that he wasless culpable

because of his youth than an adult. I hadthought we made clear in Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S.

104 (1982), that the vicissitudes of youth bear directly on theyoung offender's culpability and responsibility for the crime:

"[Y]outh is more than a chronological fact. It is a timeand condition of life when a person may be most susceptible to influence and to psychological damage. Our his-tory is replete with laws and judicial recognition that
minors, especially in their earlier years, generally areless mature and responsible than adults. Particularly
during the formative years of childhood and adolescence,minors often lack the experience, perspective, and judgment expected of adults." Id., at 115-116 (footnotesand internal quotation marks omitted).

See also Graham, supra, at 518 (Souter, J., dissenting)("Youth may be understood to mitigate by reducing a defendant's moral culpability for the crime, for which emotional andcognitive immaturity and inexperience with life render him

In Graham v. Collins, supra, the Court held that the reliefJohnson seeks today was not " `

debate among reasonable minds." 506 U. S., at 476 (internalquotation marks omitted). I did not agree with the Court's
conclusion in Graham, see id., at 504-505 (Souter, J., dis-senting), but even if I had, I would not find

Graham control-ling today.

rality opinion), however, and cases that reject a claim as re-quiring a new rule cannot constitute

stare decisis on direct
review. The purpose of Teague is to accommodate the com-peting demands of constitutional imperatives and the "principle of finality which is essential to the operation of our criminal justice system," id., at 309. See Desist v. United States,394 U. S. 244, 260-269 (1969) (Harlan, J., dissenting). But

the finality concerns of Teague come into play only after thisCourt has denied certiorari or the time for filing a petition
for certiorari from the judgment affirming the conviction hasexpired. See

Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314, 321, n. 6
(1987). Until that time, the interests of finality and comitythat caused us to implement the

Teague standards of retroactivity are not at issue. The only demands with which we
need, indeed, must, concern ourselves are those of the Con-stitution. On direct review, it is our constitutionally imposed duty to resolve "all cases before us . . . in light of ourbest understanding of governing constitutional principles,"
Mackey v. United States, 401 U. S. 667, 679 (1971) (Harlan,J., concurring in judgment), without regard to reliance interests of the State.The analysis of our collateral review doctrine, as well as
its purpose, makes the majority's emphasis on cases decided
under Teague inappropriate in a direct review case. When
determining whether a rule is new, we do not ask whether
it fairly can be discerned from our precedents; we do not
even ask if most reasonable jurists would have discerned it
from our precedents. We ask only whether the result was
dictated by past cases, or whether it is "susceptible to debate
among reasonable minds," Butler v. McKellar, 494 U. S. 407,
415 (1990). And we have recognized that answering this
question is difficult, especially when we are faced with the
application of settled law to new facts. Id., at 414-415.

If the rule the petitioner sought in Graham was a new
rule, it was one only because we had never squarely held
that the former Texas special issues required an additional
instruction regarding youth. That we have not addressed

this particular combination of circumstances on direct review
until today, however, cannot create an insurmountable reliance interest in the State of Texas, as the Court suggests.
See ante, at 366-367. To allow our failure to address an
issue to create such an interest would elevate our practice of
letting issues "percolate" in the 50 States in the interests of
federalism over our responsibility to resolve emerging constitutional issues. On direct review, the question is what
the Constitution, read in light of our precedents, requires.
In my view, the Eighth Amendment requires an additional
instruction in this case.

III

A

There is considerable support in our early cases for the
proposition that the sentencer in a capital case must be able
to give full effect to all mitigating evidence concerning the
defendant's character and record and the circumstances of
the crime. The Court first recognized the need to give effect to mitigating circumstances in the group of capital cases
decided after Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238 (1972). In
three of those cases, Justices Stewart, Powell, and Stevens
upheld capital sentencing laws against facial challenges, in
large part because they believed that the statutes narrowed
the category of defendants subject to the death penalty at
the same time that they allowed for consideration of the mitigating circumstances regarding the individual defendant and
the particular crime. See Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153,
196-197 (1976) ( joint opinion); Proffitt v. Florida, 428 U. S.
242, 250-253 (1976) ( joint opinion); Jurek v. Texas, 428 U. S.
262, 270-274 (1976) ( joint opinion). In two other cases, the
joint opinions found mandatory death penalty statutes unconstitutional. See Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U. S.
280, 303-305 (1976) (plurality opinion); Roberts v. Louisiana,
428 U. S. 325, 333-336 (1976) (plurality opinion). A mandatory death penalty certainly limited the discretion of the
sentencer, but it was not "consistent with the Constitution."

380 JOHNSON v. TEXAS

O'Connor, J., dissenting
Ante, at 360. The plurality opinion in Woodson recognizedthat allowing a sentencer to consider, but not to give effect

to, mitigating circumstances would result in the arbitraryand capricious jury nullification that prevailed prior to

Furman. See Woodson, 428 U. S., at 303. Furthermore, "[a]
process that accords no significance to relevant facets of thecharacter and record of the individual offender or the circumstances of the particular offense excludes from considerationin fixing the ultimate punishment of death the possibility
of compassionate or mitigating factors stemming from thediverse frailties of humankind."

Id., at 304.
We returned to the issue of mitigating circumstances two
Terms later. The Ohio death penalty statute required the
sentencer to impose the death penalty on a death-eligible
defendant unless one of three mitigating circumstances was
established by a preponderance of the evidence. See Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586, 599, n. 7, and 607 (1978) (plurality
opinion). In determining the existence of the three circumstances, the sentencer was to consider " `the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history, character, and condition of the offender.' " Id., at 612 (quoting Ohio Rev. Code
Ann. $ 2929.04(B) (1975)). The Ohio Supreme Court had held
that the mitigating circumstances were to be construed liberally, but a plurality of this Court nevertheless found the statute too narrow to pass constitutional muster. 438 U. S., at
608. The Lockett plurality concluded from the post-Furman
cases that "the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments require
that the sentencer, in all but the rarest kind of capital case,
not be precluded from considering, as a mitigating factor,
any aspect of a defendant's character or record and any
of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death." 438 U. S.,
at 604 (footnote omitted). The statute at issue specifically
directed the sentencer to consider those very factors. Nevertheless, the plurality found the statute unconstitutional because it provided no method by which such consideration

could "affect the sentencing decision." Id., at 608. Accord,
Bell v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 637, 641-642 (1978) (petitioner's counsel offered a wide range of mitigating evidence at the penalty
phase, and according to the Ohio statute, the sentencer was
to consider that evidence; petitioner's death sentence reversed nevertheless because the statute unconstitutionally
limited consideration of the evidence as mitigating factors).

The Court next addressed the constitutional requirement
that a sentencer be allowed to give full consideration and
full effect to mitigating circumstances in Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104 (1982). Although the Oklahoma death
penalty statute contained no specific restrictions on the
types of mitigating evidence that could be considered, neither the Oklahoma trial court nor the Court of Criminal Appeals believed that it could consider, as mitigating factors,
the evidence of petitioner's unhappy upbringing and emotional disturbance. See id., at 109-110. The Court reversed petitioner's death sentence. In so doing, it reaffirmed the rule of Lockett: The sentencer in a capital case
must be permitted to consider relevant mitigating factors in
ways that can affect the sentencing decision. This rule, the
Court explained, accommodated the twin objectives of our
Eighth Amendment jurisprudence: "measured, consistent
application and fairness to the accused." 455 U. S., at 111.

Four years later, the Court again made plain that Lockett
and Eddings meant what they said. In Skipper v. South
Carolina, 476 U. S. 1 (1986), we reiterated that evidence,
even if not "relate[d] specifically to petitioner's culpability
for the crime he committed," id., at 4, must be treated as
relevant mitigating evidence if it serves " `as a basis for a
sentence less than death,' " id., at 5 (quoting Lockett, supra,
at 604). We summarized the "constitutionally permissible
range of discretion in imposing the death penalty" the following Term in McCleskey v. Kemp, 481 U. S. 279, 305-306
(1987):

O'Connor, J., dissenting
"First, there is a required threshold below which thedeath penalty cannot be imposed. In this context,

the State must establish rational criteria that narrowthe decisionmaker's judgment as to whether the circumstances of a particular defendant's case meet the
threshold. . . . Second, States cannot limit the sen-tencer's consideration of any relevant circumstance that

could cause it to decline to impose the penalty. In thisrespect,

the State cannot channel the sentencer's discretion, but must allow it to consider any relevant information offered by the defendant." Id., at 305-306 (emphases added).

We have adhered to this "constitutionally permissible
range of discretion" again and again in the years since wedecided

McCleskey, most recently in McKoy v. North Carolina, 494 U. S. 433 (1990). Accord, Hitchcock v. Dugger, 481U. S. 393, 398-399 (1987);

Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302,
319-328 (1989). The Court attempts to limit these casesby relying on plurality opinions, concurrences, and dicta,

see, e. g., ante, at 361-362, but until today a majority of this
Court has declined to upset our settled Eighth Amendmentjurisprudence.

B
Despite the long line of precedent supporting Johnson's
argument that the State impermissibly limited the effectthat could be given to his youth, the Court, like respondent

and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, clings doggedlyto

Jurek v. Texas, 428 U. S. 262 (1976) ( joint opinion). The
interpretation on which the Court today relies, however, has
nothing to do with what the Court actually decided in Jurek.
Jurek was one of five cases in which this Court evaluated
the States' attempts after Furman to enact constitutional
death penalty statutes. The statutes at issue had been
applied a limited number of times, and, of necessity, the
challenges were all facial. The Texas Court of Criminal

383Cite as: 509 U. S. 350 (1993)
O'Connor, J., dissenting
Appeals, for example, had examined the application of theTexas statute only twice: in

Jurek itself, and in one other
case. 428 U. S., at 273. Because of the posture of the caseand the limited history of the statute's application, the Court

could not, and did not, determine the statute's constitutionality in all circumstances. Instead, the joint opinion, whichcontained the narrowest ground of decision in the case, read

the Texas court's interpretation of the statute as allowingthe jury to consider the "particularized circumstances of the
individual offense and the individual offender" before deathis imposed.

Id., at 274. Therefore, the joint opinion held
that the statute fell within what we later called the "constitutionally permissible range of discretion in imposing the
death penalty," McCleskey v. Kemp, supra, at 305. Jurek,
supra, at 276.

Because Jurek involved only a facial challenge to the Texas
statute, the constitutionality of the statute as implemented
in particular instances was not at issue. Nor was the "asapplied" constitutionality of the statute implicated in any of
our cases until Franklin v. Lynaugh, 487 U. S. 164 (1988).
In Adams v. Texas, 448 U. S. 38 (1980), for example, the
Court still expressed the view that the statute allowed members of the jury to consider all relevant evidence, and to use
that evidence in answering the special questions, "while remaining true to their instructions and their oaths." Id., at
46. The same is true of the plurality opinion in Lockett,
which stated that the joint opinion in Jurek had approved
the Texas statute because it "concluded that the Texas Court
of Criminal Appeals had broadly interpreted the second
question--despite its facial narrowness." 438 U. S., at 607.

When the Court addressed its first as-applied challenge to
the Texas death penalty statute in Franklin, it was clear
that any statements in Jurek regarding the statute's constitutionality were conditioned on a particular understanding
of state law. Jurek simply had not upheld the Texas death
penalty statute in all circumstances. In fact, five Members

509us2108K 05-04-97 17:51:51 PAGES OPINPGT
384 JOHNSON v. TEXAS

O'Connor, J., dissenting
of the Court rejected the Franklin plurality's reliance on
Jurek and disagreed with the plurality's suggestion that a
State constitutionally could limit the "ability of the sentencing authority to give effect to mitigating evidence relevant
to a defendant's character or background or to the circumstances of the offense." 487 U. S., at 183-185 (O'Connor, J.,
joined by Blackmun, J., concurring in judgment) (emphasis
added); id., at 194-200 (Stevens, J., joined by Brennan and
Marshall, JJ., dissenting). See also Penry v. Lynaugh, 492
U. S., at 320-321 ("[B]oth the concurrence and the dissent [in
Franklin] understood Jurek as resting fundamentally on the

express assurance that the special issues would permit the
jury to fully consider all the mitigating evidence a defendant introduced").

The view of the five concurring and dissenting Justices
that the facial review in Jurek did not decide the issue presented in Franklin is not surprising. After all, the same
day we approved the Texas death penalty statute in Jurek,
we also approved the death penalty statutes of Georgia and
Florida. See Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153 (1976) ( joint
opinion); Proffitt v. Florida, 428 U. S. 242 (1976) ( joint opinion). Yet after Gregg and Proffitt and prior to Franklin, we
held unconstitutional specific applications of the same Georgia and Florida statutes we earlier had approved. See Godfrey v. Georgia, 446 U. S. 420 (1980) (vague and overly broad
construction of aggravating factor rendered death sentence
unconstitutional); Hitchcock v. Dugger, supra (holding it unconstitutional to restrict jury's consideration of mitigating
factors to those enumerated in the statute). Despite this
majority view of Jurek and the Texas death penalty statute,
the Court today relies on the minority view in Franklin. It
goes so far as to note with approval the minority position
that "Jurek foreclosed the defendant's argument that the
jury was still entitled to cast an `independent' vote against
the death penalty even if it answered yes to the special is509us2108K 05-04-97 17:51:51 PAGES OPINPGT

O'Connor, J., dissenting
sues." Ante, at 364 (citing Franklin, supra, at 180). Thisreading of

Franklin turns stare decisis on its head.
Although the majority of Justices in Franklin did not ac-cept the contention that the State constitutionally could limit

a sentencer's ability to give effect to mitigating evidence,
two Justices concurred in the judgment because they be-lieved that on the facts of that case the State had not limited

the effect the evidence could be given. 487 U. S., at 185(

O'Connor, J., joined by Blackmun, J., concurring in judgment). Thus, resolution of the issue was left open. Thefollowing Term, however, the Court squarely addressed the

constitutionality of limiting the effect a Texas jury could give
to relevant mitigating evidence, and contrary to the majority
opinion today, we plainly held that the Texas special issues
violated the Eighth Amendment to the extent they prevented the jury from giving full consideration and effect
to a defendant's relevant mitigating evidence. Penry v.
Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302 (1989).

Penry was in no way limited to evidence that is only
aggravating under the "future dangerousness" issue. We
stated there that "Eddings makes clear that it is not enough
simply to allow the defendant to present mitigating evidence
to the sentencer. The sentencer must also be able to consider and give effect to that evidence in imposing sentence."
Id., at 319. That we meant "full effect" is evident from the
remainder of our discussion. We first determined that Penry's evidence of mental retardation and his abused childhood
was relevant to the question whether he acted deliberately
under the first special issue. Id., at 322. But having some
relevance to an issue was not sufficient, and the problem was
not, as the Court today suggests, see ante, at 364-365, simply
that no jury instruction defined the term "deliberately." Instead, we noted that the jury must be able to give effect to
the evidence as it related to Penry's "[p]ersonal culpability,"
which "is not solely a function of a defendant's capacity to
act `deliberately.' " 492 U. S., at 322. The jury could not

509us2108K 05-04-97 17:51:51 PAGES OPINPGT
386 JOHNSON v. TEXAS

O'Connor, J., dissenting
give full effect to Penry's evidence under the first specialissue because "deliberately" was not defined "in a way that

would clearly direct the jury to consider fully Penry's miti-gating evidence as it bears on his personal culpability."
Id., at 323 (emphasis added). That is, the evidence had rele-vance beyond the scope of the first issue.

Id., at 322.We concluded that the second special issue, like the first,

did not allow a jury to give effect to a mitigating aspectof mental retardation: the diminution of culpability. Id., at
323-324. The Court today makes much of our finding thatthe "only" relevance of Penry's evidence to the second issue
was as an aggravating factor, see id., at 323. Ante, at 365.But in so doing, it takes our factual description of Penry's
evidence as a "two-edged sword" out of context. The sec-ond special issue was not inadequate because the evidence
worked only against Penry; it was inadequate because it didnot allow the jury to give full effect to Penry's mitigating
evidence. Penry, 492 U. S., at 323. Our discussion of thethird special issue--whether the defendant's conduct was
unreasonable in response to the provocation--also focused onthe inability of a juror to express the view that Penry lacked
"the moral culpability to be sentenced to death" in answer-ing the question. Id., at 324-325. The point of Penry is
clear: A death sentence resulting from application of theTexas special issues cannot be upheld unless the jurors are
able to consider fully a defendant's mitigating evidence. Ac-cord,

id., at 355 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissentingin part) (The Court today holds that "the constitutionality

turns on whether the [special] questions allow mitigating fac-tors not only to be considered . . . , but also to be given effect
in all possible ways, including ways that the questions donot permit").

C
Our recent cases are not to the contrary. In Boyde v.
California, 494 U. S. 370 (1990), for example, the Court re-lied on two straightforward propositions to reject petition509us2108K 05-04-97 17:51:51 PAGES OPINPGT

387Cite as: 509 U. S. 350 (1993)
O'Connor, J., dissenting
er's claim that the California death penalty was unconstitu-tional. First, we rejected the argument that requiring the

jury to weigh aggravating and mitigating factors, and thensentence petitioner accordingly, violated the requirement of
individualized sentencing. The petitioner in Boyde did not
allege that the instruction interfered with the jury's consid-eration of mitigating evidence; instead, he essentially argued

for the constitutional right to an instruction on jury nullifi-cation. See

id., at 377. We also addressed (and rejected)
petitioner's challenge to a "catch-all" instruction that toldthe jury to consider "[a]ny other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime even though it is not a legal
excuse for the crime." Id., at 374 (internal quotation marks
omitted). We reiterated our long-time understanding that
the "Eighth Amendment requires that the jury be able to
consider and give effect to all relevant mitigating evidence
offered by petitioner," id., at 377-378, but found that the
challenged instruction did not "restrict impermissibly [the]
jury's consideration of relevant evidence," id., at 378. Accord, id., at 382-384. Our holding in Boyde did not constrict
or limit our prior cases on the requirements of the Eighth
Amendment.

The Court's reliance on Saffle v. Parks, 494 U. S. 484
(1990), also is misplaced. In Saffle, the only issue was
whether it would be a new rule under the standards of
Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989), for a defendant to be
entitled to an instruction allowing the jury to decline to impose the death penalty based on mere sympathy. We held
that it would. 494 U. S., at 489. To be sure, there is language in Saffle suggesting that a State may limit a sentencer's consideration of mitigating evidence so long as the
sentencer may give some effect to the evidence. See, e. g.,
id., at 490-491. But to the extent Saffle suggests anything
more than that the State may prevent the sentencer from
declining to impose the death penalty based on mere sympathy, the language is dictum and cannot be construed as over509us2108K 05-04-97 17:51:51 PAGES OPINPGT
388 JOHNSON v. TEXAS

O'Connor, J., dissenting
ruling 17 years of precedent. Limiting a sentencer's discre-tion to react based on unfocused sympathy is not the

equivalent of preventing a sentencer from giving a "reasonedmoral response," id., at 493 (internal quotation marks omitted), based on "any aspect of a defendant's character or rec-ord and any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death,"
id., at 489 (internal quotation marks omitted). This Courthas reaffirmed continually since 1976 that the Constitution

prohibits the latter limitation.

* * *
"[Y]outh is more than a chronological fact." Eddings,455 U. S., at 115. The emotional and mental immaturity

of young people may cause them to respond to events inways that an adult would not. Because the jurors in Johnson's case could not give effect to this aspect of Johnson'syouth, I would vacate Johnson's sentence and remand for
resentencing.

389OCTOBER TERM, 1992
Syllabus

GODINEZ, WARDEN v. MORAN
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 92-725. Argued April 21, 1993--Decided June 24, 1993
After respondent Moran pleaded not guilty to three counts of first-degree

murder and two psychiatrists concluded that he was competent to stand
trial, he informed the Nevada trial court that he wished to discharge his
attorneys and change his pleas to guilty. The court found that Moran
understood "the nature of the criminal charges against him" and was
"able to assist in his defense"; that he was "knowingly and intelligently"
waiving his right to the assistance of counsel; and that his guilty pleas
were "freely and voluntarily" given. He was ultimately sentenced to
death. When Moran subsequently sought state postconviction relief,
the trial court held an evidentiary hearing before rejecting his claim
that he was mentally incompetent to represent himself, and the State
Supreme Court dismissed his appeal. A Federal District Court denied
his petition for a writ of habeas corpus, but the Court of Appeals reversed. It concluded that due process required the trial court to hold
a hearing to evaluate and determine Moran's competency before it accepted his decisions to waive counsel and plead guilty. It also found
that the postconviction hearing did not cure the error, holding that the
trial court's ruling was premised on the wrong legal standard because
competency to waive constitutional rights requires a higher level of
mental functioning than that required to stand trial. The court reasoned that, while a defendant is competent to stand trial if he has a
rational and factual understanding of the proceedings and is capable of
assisting his counsel, he is competent to waive counsel or plead guilty
only if he has the capacity for reasoned choice among the available
alternatives.

Held: The competency standard for pleading guilty or waiving the right

to counsel is the same as the competency standard for standing trial:
whether the defendant has "sufficient present ability to consult with his
lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding" and a "rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him,"
Dusky v. United States, 362 U. S. 402 (per curiam). There is no reason
for the competency standard for either of those decisions to be higher
than that for standing trial. The decision to plead guilty, though profound, is no more complicated than the sum total of decisions that a
defendant may have to make during the course of a trial, such as

509us2109L 05-09-97 08:15:09 PAGES OPINPGT
390 GODINEZ v. MORAN

Syllabus
whether to testify, whether to waive a jury trial, and whether to crossexamine witnesses for the prosecution. Nor does the decision to waive
counsel require an appreciably higher level of mental functioning than
the decision to waive other constitutional rights. A higher standard is
not necessary in order to ensure that a defendant is competent to represent himself, because the ability to do so has no bearing upon his competence to choose self-representation, Faretta v. California, 422 U. S. 806,
836. When, in Westbrook v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 150 (per curiam), this
Court vacated a lower court ruling because there had been no "hearing
or inquiry into the issue of [the petitioner's] competence to waive his
constitutional right to the assistance of counsel," it did not mean to
suggest that the Dusky formulation is not a high enough standard in
cases in which the defendant seeks to waive counsel. Rather, the "competence to waive" language was simply a shorthand for the "intelligent
and competent waiver" requirement of Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458,
468. Thus, Westbrook stands only for the unremarkable proposition
that when a defendant seeks to waive his right to counsel, a determination that he is competent to stand trial is not enough; the waiver must
also be intelligent and voluntary before it can be accepted. While
States are free to adopt competency standards that are more elaborate
than the Dusky formulation, the Due Process Clause does not impose
them. Pp. 396-402.

brief was Edward M. Chikofsky.*

Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case presents the question whether the competencystandard for pleading guilty or waiving the right to counsel

is higher than the competency standard for standing trial.We hold that it is not.

I
On August 2, 1984, in the early hours of the morning,respondent entered the Red Pearl Saloon in Las Vegas,

Nevada, and shot the bartender and a patron four times eachwith an automatic pistol. He then walked behind the bar
and removed the cash register. Nine days later, respondentarrived at the apartment of his former wife and opened fire
on her; five of his seven shots hit their target. Respondentthen shot himself in the abdomen and attempted, without
success, to slit his wrists. Of the four victims of respond-ent's gunshots, only respondent himself survived. On August 13, respondent summoned police to his hospital bed andconfessed to the killings.

After respondent pleaded not guilty to three counts offirst-degree murder, the trial court ordered that he be examined by a pair of psychiatrists, both of whom concluded thathe was competent to stand trial.

1 The State thereafter an*Kent S. Scheidegger and Charles L. Hobson filed a brief for the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation as amicus curiae urging reversal.

Briefs of amici curiae urging affirmance were filed for the American

that respondent was "in full control of his faculties" insofar as he had the
"ability to aid counsel, assist in his own defense, recall evidence and . . .

Opinion of the Court
nounced its intention to seek the death penalty. On Novem-ber 28, 1984, 2

1/2 months after the psychiatric evaluations,

respondent again appeared before the trial court. At thistime respondent informed the court that he wished to discharge his attorneys and change his pleas to guilty. Thereason for the request, according to respondent, was to
prevent the presentation of mitigating evidence at hissentencing.

On the basis of the psychiatric reports, the trial courtfound that respondent

"is competent in that he knew the nature and quality ofhis acts, had the capacity to determine right from
wrong; that he understands the nature of the criminalcharges against him and is able to assist in his defense
of such charges, or against the pronouncement of thejudgment thereafter; that he knows the consequences of
entering a plea of guilty to the charges; and that he canintelligently and knowingly waive his constitutional
right to assistance of an attorney." App. 21.
The court advised respondent that he had a right both to theassistance of counsel and to self-representation, warned him

of the "dangers and disadvantages" of self-representation,
id., at 22, inquired into his understanding of the proceedingsand his awareness of his rights, and asked why he had chosen

to represent himself. It then accepted respondent's waiverof counsel. The court also accepted respondent's guilty
pleas, but not before it had determined that respondent wasnot pleading guilty in response to threats or promises, that
he understood the nature of the charges against him and theconsequences of pleading guilty, that he was aware of the

give testimony if called upon to do so." App. 8. The other psychiatrist
believed that respondent was "knowledgeable of the charges being made
against him"; that he had the ability to "assist his attorney, in his own
defense, if he so desire[d]"; and that he was "fully cognizant of the penalties if convicted." Id., at 17.

rights he was giving up, and that there was a factual basisfor the pleas. The trial court explicitly found that respondent was "knowingly and intelligently" waiving his right tothe assistance of counsel,

ibid., and that his guilty pleas were
"freely and voluntarily" given, id., at 64.2On January 21, 1985, a three-judge court sentenced respondent to death for each of the murders. The Supreme
Court of Nevada affirmed respondent's sentences for the RedPearl Saloon murders, but reversed his sentence for the murder of his ex-wife and remanded for imposition of a life sen-tence without the possibility of parole.

Moran v. State, 103
Nev. 138, 734 P. 2d 712 (1987).On July 30, 1987, respondent filed a petition for postconviction relief in state court. Following an evidentiaryhearing, the trial court rejected respondent's claim that he
was "mentally incompetent to represent himself," concluding
that "the record clearly shows that he was examined by two
psychiatrists both of whom declared [him] competent."
App. to Pet. for Cert. D-8. The Supreme Court of Nevada
dismissed respondent's appeal, Moran v. Warden, 105 Nev.
1041, 810 P. 2d 335, and we denied certiorari, 493 U. S. 874
(1989).

Respondent then filed a habeas petition in the United
States District Court for the District of Nevada. The District Court denied the petition, but the Ninth Circuit reversed. 972 F. 2d 263 (1992). The Court of Appeals concluded that the "record in this case" should have led the trial
court to "entertai[n] a good faith doubt about [respondent's]

respondent answered as follows: "Just what they give me in, you know,
medications." Id., at 33. The court made no further inquiry. The "medications" to which respondent referred had been prescribed to control his
seizures, which were a byproduct of his cocaine use. See App. to Pet. for

waiver of constitutional rights," id., at 265,3 and that the DueProcess Clause therefore "required the court to hold a hearing to evaluate and determine [respondent's] competency . . .before it accepted his decision to discharge counsel and
change his pleas," ibid. Rejecting petitioner's argumentthat the trial court's error was "cured by the postconviction
hearing," ibid., and that the competency determination thatfollowed the hearing was entitled to deference under 28
U. S. C. $ 2254(d), the Court of Appeals held that "the statecourt's postconviction ruling was premised on the wrong
legal standard of competency," 972 F. 2d, at 266. "Compe-tency to waive constitutional rights," according to the Court
of Appeals, "requires a higher level of mental functioningthan that required to stand trial"; while a defendant is competent to stand trial if he has "a rational and factual under-standing of the proceedings and is capable of assisting his
counsel," a defendant is competent to waive counsel or pleadguilty only if he has "the capacity for `reasoned choice'
among the alternatives available to him." Ibid. The Courtof Appeals determined that the trial court had "erroneously
applied the standard for evaluating competency to standtrial, instead of the correct `reasoned choice' standard,"

id.,at 266-267, and further concluded that when examined "in

light of the correct legal standard," the record did not sup-port a finding that respondent was "mentally capable of the
reasoned choice required for a valid waiver of constitutionalrights,"

id., at 267.4 The Court of Appeals accordingly in3 The specific features of the record upon which the Court of Appeals
relied were respondent's suicide attempt; his desire to discharge his attorneys so as to prevent the presentation of mitigating evidence at sentencing; his "monosyllabic" responses to the trial court's questions; and the
fact that he was on medication at the time he sought to waive his right to
counsel and plead guilty. 972 F. 2d, at 265.

4 In holding that respondent was not competent to waive his constitutional rights, the court placed heavy emphasis on the fact that respondent
was on medication at the time he sought to discharge his attorneys and
plead guilty. See id., at 268.

structed the District Court to issue the writ of habeas corpus
within 60 days, "unless the state court allows [respondent]
to withdraw his guilty pleas, enter new pleas, and proceed

Whether the competency standard for pleading guilty
or waiving the right to counsel is higher than the competency
standard for standing trial is a question that has divided the
Federal Courts of Appeals 5 and state courts of last re5 While the Ninth Circuit and the District of Columbia Circuit, see

every other Circuit that has considered the issue has determined that the
competency standard for pleading guilty is identical to the competency

so "competently and intelligently," Johnson v. Zerbst, 304U. S. 458, 468 (1938); accord,

Brady v. United States, 397 U. S.742, 758 (1970). In Dusky v. United States, 362 U. S. 402

(1960) (per curiam), we held that the standard for compe-tence to stand trial is whether the defendant has "sufficient
present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonabledegree of rational understanding" and has "a rational as well
as factual understanding of the proceedings against him."
Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). Accord, Drope v.Missouri, 420 U. S. 162, 171 (1975) ("[A] person whose mental

condition is such that he lacks the capacity to understand thenature and object of the proceedings against him, to consult

standard for competence to stand trial, however, we havenever expressly articulated a standard for competence to
plead guilty or to waive the right to the assistance of counsel.Relying in large part upon our decision in

Westbrook v.Arizona, 384 U. S. 150 (1966) (per curiam), the Ninth Circuit

adheres to the view that the competency standard for plead-ing guilty or waiving the right to counsel is higher than the

decision applying heightened standard). In Westbrook, atwo-paragraph

per curiam opinion, we vacated the lower
court's judgment affirming the petitioner's conviction, be-cause there had been "a hearing on the issue of [the petitioner's] competence to stand trial," but "no hearing or inquiry
into the issue of his competence to waive his constitutionalright to the assistance of counsel." 384 U. S., at 150. The

Ninth Circuit has reasoned that the "clear implication" of
Westbrook is that the Dusky formulation is not "a high
enough standard" for determining whether a defendant iscompetent to waive a constitutional right.

Sieling, supra,
at 214.7 We think the Ninth Circuit has read too much into
Westbrook, and we think it errs in applying two different
competency standards.8

A

The standard adopted by the Ninth Circuit is whether a
defendant who seeks to plead guilty or waive counsel has
the capacity for "reasoned choice" among the alternatives
available to him. How this standard is different from (much
less higher than) the Dusky standard--whether the defendant has a "rational understanding" of the proceedings--is not
readily apparent to us. In fact, respondent himself opposed
certiorari on the ground that the difference between the two
standards is merely one of "terminology," Brief in Opposition
4, and he devotes little space in his brief on the merits to a
defense of the Ninth Circuit's standard, see, e. g., Brief for

7 A criminal defendant waives three constitutional rights when he pleads
guilty: the privilege against self-incrimination, the right to a jury trial,
and the right to confront one's accusers. Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U. S.
238, 243 (1969).

8 Although this case comes to us by way of federal habeas corpus, we do

not dispose of it on the ground that the heightened competency standard is
a "new rule" for purposes of Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989), because
petitioner did not raise a Teague defense in the lower courts or in his
petition for certiorari. See Parke v. Raley, 506 U. S. 20, 26 (1992); Collins

Opinion of the Court
Respondent 17-18, 27, 32; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 33 ("Dueprocess does not require [a] higher standard, [it] requires a

separate inquiry").9 But even assuming that there is somemeaningful distinction between the capacity for "reasoned
choice" and a "rational understanding" of the proceedings,we reject the notion that competence to plead guilty or to
waive the right to counsel must be measured by a standardthat is higher than (or even different from) the

Duskystandard.

We begin with the guilty plea. A defendant who standstrial is likely to be presented with choices that entail relinquishment of the same rights that are relinquished by a de-fendant who pleads guilty: He will ordinarily have to decide
whether to waive his "privilege against compulsory self-incrimination,"

Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U. S. 238, 243 (1969),by taking the witness stand; if the option is available, he may

have to decide whether to waive his "right to trial by jury,"ibid.; and, in consultation with counsel, he may have to decide whether to waive his "right to confront [his] accusers,"
ibid., by declining to cross-examine witnesses for the prose-cution. A defendant who pleads not guilty, moreover, faces

still other strategic choices: In consultation with his attor-ney, he may be called upon to decide, among other things,
whether (and how) to put on a defense and whether to raiseone or more affirmative defenses. In sum, all criminal defendants--not merely those who plead guilty--may be re-quired to make important decisions once criminal proceedings have been initiated. And while the decision to pleadguilty is undeniably a profound one, it is no more complicated
than the sum total of decisions that a defendant may becalled upon to make during the course of a trial. (The decision to plead guilty is also made over a shorter period of

9 We have used the phrase "rational choice" in describing the competence necessary to withdraw a certiorari petition, Rees v. Peyton, 384 U. S.
312, 314 (1966) (per curiam), but there is no indication in that opinion that
the phrase means something different from "rational understanding."

Opinion of the Court
time, without the distraction and burden of a trial.) Thisbeing so, we can conceive of no basis for demanding a higher

level of competence for those defendants who choose to pleadguilty. If the

Dusky standard is adequate for defendants
who plead not guilty, it is necessarily adequate for those who
plead guilty.Nor do we think that a defendant who waives his right to

the assistance of counsel must be more competent than adefendant who does not, since there is no reason to believe
that the decision to waive counsel requires an appreciablyhigher level of mental functioning than the decision to waive
other constitutional rights. Respondent suggests that ahigher competency standard is necessary because a defendant who represents himself " `must have greater powers of
comprehension, judgment, and reason than would be neces-sary to stand trial with the aid of an attorney.' " Brief for

a flawed premise; the competence that is required of a defendant seeking to waive his right to counsel is the competence to waive the right, not the competence to represent
himself.10 In Faretta v. California, 422 U. S. 806 (1975), we

10 It is for this reason that the dissent's reliance on Massey v. Moore,
348 U. S. 105 (1954), is misplaced. When we said in Massey that "[o]ne
might not be insane in the sense of being incapable of standing trial and
yet lack the capacity to stand trial without benefit of counsel," id., at 108,
we were answering a question that is quite different from the question
presented in this case. Prior to our decision in Gideon v. Wainwright,
372 U. S. 335 (1963), the appointment of counsel was required only in those
state prosecutions in which "special circumstances" were present, see id.,
at 350-351 (Harlan, J., concurring), and the question in Massey was
whether a finding that a defendant is competent to stand trial compels a
conclusion that there are no "special circumstances" justifying the appointment of counsel. The question here is not whether a defendant who is
competent to stand trial has no right to have counsel appointed; it is

Opinion of the Court
held that a defendant choosing self-representation must doso "competently and intelligently," id., at 835, but we made

it clear that the defendant's "technical legal knowledge"is "not relevant" to the determination whether he is competent to waive his right to counsel, id., at 836, and weemphasized that although the defendant "may conduct his
own defense ultimately to his own detriment, his choicemust be honored,"

id., at 834. Thus, while "[i]t is undeniablethat in most criminal prosecutions defendants could better

defend with counsel's guidance than by their own unskilledefforts," ibid., a criminal defendant's ability to represent
himself has no bearing upon his competence to choose selfrepresentation.11 B

A finding that a defendant is competent to stand trial,
however, is not all that is necessary before he may be permit-ted to plead guilty or waive his right to counsel. In addition

to determining that a defendant who seeks to plead guilty orwaive counsel is competent, a trial court must satisfy itself
that the waiver of his constitutional rights is knowing andvoluntary.

Parke v. Raley, 506 U. S. 20, 28-29 (1992) (guilty
plea); Faretta, supra, at 835 (waiver of counsel). In this

whether such a defendant is competent to waive the right to counsel that
(after Gideon) he under all circumstances has.

11 We note also that the prohibition against the trial of incompetent defendants dates back at least to the time of Blackstone, see Medina v. California, 505 U. S. 437, 446 (1992); Drope v. Missouri, 420 U. S. 162, 171-172
(1975); Youtsey v. United States, 97 F. 937, 940 (CA6 1899) (collecting "common law authorities"), and that "[b]y the common law of that time,
it was not representation by counsel but self-representation that was
the practice in prosecutions for serious crime," Faretta v. California,
422 U. S., at 823; accord, id., at 850 (Blackmun, J., dissenting) ("selfrepresentation was common, if not required, in 18th century English and
American prosecutions"). It would therefore be "difficult to say that a
standard which was designed to determine whether a defendant was capable of defending himself" is "inadequate when he chooses to conduct his
own defense." People v. Reason, 37 N. Y. 2d, at 354, 334 N. E. 2d, at 574.

Opinion of the Court
sense there is a "heightened" standard for pleading guilty
and for waiving the right to counsel, but it is not a heightened standard of competence.12

This two-part inquiry 13 is what we had in mind in Westbrook. When we distinguished between "competence to
stand trial" and "competence to waive [the] constitutional
right to the assistance of counsel," 384 U. S., at 150, we were
using "competence to waive" as a shorthand for the "intelligent and competent waiver" requirement of Johnson v.
Zerbst. This much is clear from the fact that we quoted that
very language from Zerbst immediately after noting that the

trial court had not determined whether the petitioner was
competent to waive his right to counsel. See 384 U. S., at
150 (" `This protecting duty imposes the serious and weighty
responsibility upon the trial judge of determining whether
there is an intelligent and competent waiver by the accused' ") (quoting Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U. S., at 465).
Thus, Westbrook stands only for the unremarkable proposi12 The focus of a competency inquiry is the defendant's mental capacity;
the question is whether he has the ability to understand the proceedings.
See Drope v. Missouri, supra, at 171 (defendant is incompetent if he "lacks
the capacity to understand the nature and object of the proceedings
against him") (emphasis added). The purpose of the "knowing and voluntary" inquiry, by contrast, is to determine whether the defendant actually
does understand the significance and consequences of a particular decision
and whether the decision is uncoerced. See Faretta v. California, supra,
at 835 (defendant waiving counsel must be "made aware of the dangers
and disadvantages of self-representation, so that the record will establish
that `he knows what he is doing and his choice is made with eyes open' ")
(quoting Adams v. United States ex rel. McCann, 317 U. S. 269, 279 (1942));
Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U. S., at 244 (defendant pleading guilty must have
"a full understanding of what the plea connotes and of its consequence").

13 We do not mean to suggest, of course, that a court is required to make

a competency determination in every case in which a defendant seeks to
plead guilty or to waive his right to counsel. As in any criminal case, a
competency determination is necessary only when a court has reason to
doubt the defendant's competence. See Drope v. Missouri, supra, at 180-
181; Pate v. Robinson, 383 U. S. 375, 385 (1966).

tion that when a defendant seeks to waive his right to coun-sel, a determination that he is competent to stand trial is not

enough; the waiver must also be intelligent and voluntarybefore it can be accepted.

III
Requiring that a criminal defendant be competent has amodest aim: It seeks to ensure that he has the capacity to

understand the proceedings and to assist counsel. Whilepsychiatrists and scholars may find it useful to classify the
various kinds and degrees of competence, and while Statesare free to adopt competency standards that are more elaborate than the Dusky formulation, the Due Process Clausedoes not impose these additional requirements. Cf.

So ordered.
Justice Kennedy, with whom Justice Scalia joins,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.

I am in full agreement with the Court's decision that thecompetency standard for pleading guilty and waiving the
right to counsel is the same as the test of competency tostand trial. As I have some reservations about one part of
the Court's opinion and take a somewhat different path toreach my conclusion, it is appropriate to make some further
observations.The Court compares the types of decisions made by one
who goes to trial with the decisions required to plead guiltyand waive the right to counsel. This comparison seems to
suggest that there may have been a heightened standard of

competent and that his waivers were knowing and voluntary. See supra,

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
competency required by the Due Process Clause if the deci-sions were not equivalent. I have serious doubts about that

proposition. In discussing the standard for a criminal de-fendant's competency to make decisions affecting his case,
we should not confuse the content of the standard with the
occasions for its application.We must leave aside in this case any question whether a

defendant is absolved of criminal responsibility due to hismental state at the time he committed criminal acts and any
later question about whether the defendant has the minimumcompetence necessary to undergo his sentence. What is at
issue here is whether the defendant has sufficient competence to take part in a criminal proceeding and to make the
decisions throughout its course. This is not to imply that
mental competence is the only aspect of a defendant's state of
mind that is relevant during criminal proceedings. Whether
the defendant has made a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary decision to make certain fundamental choices during the
course of criminal proceedings is another subject of judicial
inquiry. That both questions might be implicated at any
given point, however, does not mean that the inquiries cease
to be discrete. And as it comes to us, this case involves only
the standard for determining competency.

This Court set forth the standard for competency to stand
trial in Dusky v. United States, 362 U. S. 402 (1960) (per curiam): "[T]he `test must be whether [the defendant] has sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding--and whether he
has a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.' " Ibid. In my view, both the Court
of Appeals and respondent read "competency to stand trial"
in too narrow a fashion. We have not suggested that the
Dusky competency standard applies during the course of,
but not before, trial. Instead, that standard is applicable
from the time of arraignment through the return of a verdict.
Although the Dusky standard refers to "ability to consult

509us2109L 05-09-97 08:15:10 PAGES OPINPGT
404 GODINEZ v. MORAN

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
with [a] lawyer," the crucial component of the inquiry is the
defendant's possession of "a reasonable degree of rational
understanding." In other words, the focus of the Dusky
formulation is on a particular level of mental functioning,
which the ability to consult counsel helps identify. The possibility that consultation will occur is not required for the
standard to serve its purpose. If a defendant elects to stand
trial and to take the foolish course of acting as his own counsel, the law does not for that reason require any added degree of competence. See ante, at 399-400, n. 10.

The Due Process Clause does not mandate different standards of competency at various stages of or for different decisions made during the criminal proceedings. That was
never the rule at common law, and it would take some extraordinary showing of the inadequacy of a single standard
of competency for us to require States to employ heightened
standards. See Medina v. California, 505 U. S. 437, 446-
447 (1992). Indeed, we should only overturn Nevada's use
of a single standard if it " `offends some principle of justice
so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as
to be ranked as fundamental.' " Ibid. (quoting Patterson v.
New York, 432 U. S. 197, 202 (1977)).

The historical treatment of competency that supports Nevada's single standard has its roots in English common law.
Writing in the 18th century, Blackstone described the effect
of a defendant's incompetence on criminal proceedings:

"[I]f a man in his sound memory commits a capital offence, and before arraignment for it, he becomes mad,
he ought not to be arraigned for it; because he is not
able to plead to it with that advice and caution that he
ought. And if, after he has pleaded, the prisoner becomes mad, he shall not be tried; for how can he make
his defence?" 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *24.

405Cite as: 509 U. S. 389 (1993)
Opinion of Kennedy, J.
Blackstone drew no distinction between madness for pur-poses of pleading and madness for purposes of going to trial.

An English case arising in the Crown Court in 1865 indicatesthat a single standard was applied to assess competency at
the time of arraignment, the time of pleading, and throughout the course of trial. See Regina v. Southey, 4 Fos. & Fin.864, 872, n. a, 176 Eng. Rep. 825, 828, n. a (N. P. 1865) ("Assuming the prisoner to be insane at the time of arraignment,he cannot be tried

at all, with or without counsel, for, even
assuming that he has appointed counsel at a time when hewas sane, it is not fit that he should be tried, as he cannot

understand the evidence, nor the proceedings, and so is unable to instruct counsel, or to withdraw his authority if he
acts improperly, as a prisoner may always do"); id., at 877,
n. a, 176 Eng. Rep., at 831, n. a ("[I]f [the defendant] be so
insane as not to understand the nature of the proceedings,
he cannot plead").

A number of 19th-century American cases also referred to
insanity in a manner that suggested there was a single standard by which competency was to be assessed throughout
legal proceedings. See, e. g., Underwood v. People, 32 Mich.
1, 3 (1875) ("[I]nsanity, when discovered, was held at common
law to bar any further steps against a prisoner, at whatever
stage of the proceedings"); Crocker v. State, 60 Wis. 553, 556,
19 N. W. 435, 436 (1884) ("At common law, if a person, after
committing a crime, became insane, he was not arraigned
during his insanity, but was remitted to prison until such
incapacity was removed. The same was true where he became insane after his plea of not guilty and before trial");
State v. Reed, 41 La. Ann. 581, 582, 7 So. 132 (1889) ("It is
elementary that a man cannot plead, or be tried, or convicted, or sentenced, while in a state of insanity"). See also

406 GODINEZ v. MORAN

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
Other American cases describe the standard by whichcompetency is to be measured in a way that supports the

idea that a single standard, parallel to that articulated in
Dusky, is applied no matter at what point during legal proceedings a competency question should arise. For example,
in Freeman v. People, 4 Denio 2 (N. Y. 1847), it was held: "If. . . a person arraigned for a crime, is capable of understanding the nature and object of the proceedings going on againsthim; if he rightly comprehends his own condition in reference
to such proceedings, and can conduct his defence in a rationalmanner, he is, for the purpose of being tried, to be deemed
sane." Id., at 24-25. Because the competency questionwas posed in

Freeman at the time the defendant was to be
arraigned, id., at 19, the Freeman court's conception of competency to stand trial was that of a single standard to beapplied throughout.

An even more explicit recitation of this common-law prin-ciple is found in

Hunt v. State, 27 So. 2d 186 (Ala. 1946). In
the course of the opinion in that case, there was a discussionof the common-law rule regarding a defendant's competency

to take part in legal proceedings:

"The rule at common law . . . is that if at any time while
criminal proceedings are pending against a person ac-cused of a crime, the trial court either from observation

or upon suggestion of counsel has facts brought to hisattention which raise a doubt of the sanity of defendant,
the question should be settled before further steps are
taken. . . . The broad question to be determined then iswhether the defendant is capable of understanding the

proceedings and of making his defense, and whether he
may have a full, fair and impartial trial." Id., at 191
(citation omitted).

At common law, therefore, no attempt was made to apply
different competency standards to different stages of criminal proceedings or to the variety of decisions that a defend509us2109L 05-09-97 08:15:10 PAGES OPINPGT

ant must make during the course of those proceedings. See
Commonwealth v. Woelfel, 88 S. W. 1061, 1062 (Ky. 1905);
Jordan v. State, 135 S. W. 327, 328-329 (Tenn. 1911); State
v. Seminary, 115 So. 370, 371-372 (La. 1927); State ex

407, 408 (1946) (per curiam); Moss v. Hunter, 167 F. 2d 683,
684-685 (CA10 1948). Commentators have agreed that the
common-law standard of competency to stand trial, which
parallels the Dusky standard, has been applied throughout
criminal proceedings, not just to the formal trial. See
H. Weihofen, Mental Disorder as a Criminal Defense 428-
429, 431 (1954) ("It has long been the rule of the common law
that a person cannot be required to plead to an indictment
or be tried for a crime while he is so mentally disordered as
to be incapable of making a rational defense"); S. Brakel,
J. Parry, and A. Weiner, The Mentally Disabled and the Law
695-696 (3d ed. 1985) ("It has traditionally been presumed
that competency to stand trial means competency to participate in all phases of the trial process, including such pretrial
activities as deciding how to plead, participating in plea bargaining, and deciding whether to assert or waive the right
to counsel").

That the common law did not adopt heightened competency standards is readily understood when one considers
the difficulties that would be associated with more than one
standard. The standard applicable at a given point in a trial
could be difficult to ascertain. For instance, if a defendant
decides to change his plea to guilty after a trial has commenced, one court might apply the competency standard for
undergoing trial while another court might use the standard
for pleading guilty. In addition, the subtle nuances among
different standards are likely to be difficult to differentiate,
as evidenced by the lack of any clear distinction between
a "rational understanding" and a "reasoned choice" in this
case. See ante, at 398.

408 GODINEZ v. MORAN

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
It is true, of course, that if a defendant stands trial insteadof pleading guilty, there will be more occasions for the trial

court to observe the condition of the defendant to determinehis mental competence. Trial courts have the obligation of
conducting a hearing whenever there is sufficient doubt concerning a defendant's competence. See Drope v. Missouri,420 U. S. 162, 180-181 (1975). The standard by which competency is assessed, however, does not change. Respond-ent's counsel conceded as much during oral argument, making no attempt to defend the contrary position of the Courtof Appeals. See,

e. g., Tr. of Oral Arg. 22 ("This is not a
case of heightened standards"); id., at 31 ("We didn't argue
a heightened standard. We did not argue a heightened
standard to the Ninth Circuit, nor did we necessarily argue
a heightened standard at any juncture in this case"); id., at
33 ("Due process does not require this higher standard, but
requires a separate inquiry").

A single standard of competency to be applied throughout
criminal proceedings does not offend any " `principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people
as to be ranked as fundamental.' " Medina, 505 U. S., at 446.
Nothing in our case law compels a contrary conclusion, and
adoption of a rule setting out varying competency standards
for each decision and stage of a criminal proceeding would
disrupt the orderly course of trial and, from the standpoint
of all parties, prove unworkable both at trial and on appellate review.

I would avoid the difficult comparisons engaged in by the
Court. In my view, due process does not preclude Nevada's
use of a single competency standard for all aspects of the
criminal proceeding. Respondent's decision to plead guilty
and his decision to waive counsel were grave choices for him
to make, but as the Court demonstrates in Part II-B, there
is a heightened standard, albeit not one concerned with competence, that must be met before a defendant is allowed to
make those decisions.

Blackmun, J., dissenting
With these observations, I concur in the judgment and inParts I, II-B, and III of the Court's opinion.

Justice Blackmun, with whom Justice Stevens joins,dissenting.
Today, the majority holds that a standard of competencedesigned to measure a defendant's ability to consult with
counsel and to assist in preparing his defense is constitution-ally adequate to assess a defendant's competence to waive
the right to counsel and represent himself. In so doing, themajority upholds the death sentence for a person whose decision to discharge counsel, plead guilty, and present no de-fense well may have been the product of medication or mental illness. I believe the majority's analysis is contrary toboth common sense and longstanding case law. Therefore,
I dissent. I

As a preliminary matter, the circumstances under whichrespondent Richard Allan Moran waived his right to an attorney and pleaded guilty to capital murder bear elaboration.For, although the majority's exposition of the events is accurate, the most significant facts are omitted or relegated tofootnotes.

In August 1984, after killing three people and woundinghimself in an attempt to commit suicide, Moran was charged
in a Nevada state court with three counts of capital murder.He pleaded not guilty to all charges, and the trial court
ordered a psychiatric evaluation. At this stage, Moran'scompetence to represent himself was not at issue.

The two psychiatrists who examined him therefore fo-cused solely upon his capacity to stand trial with the assistance of counsel. Dr. Jack A. Jurasky found Moran to be "infull control of his faculties insofar as his ability to aid counsel, assist in his own defense, recall evidence and to givetestimony if called upon to do so." App. 8. Dr. Jurasky,
however, did express some reservations, observing: "Psy509us2109L 05-09-97 08:15:10 PAGES OPINPGT

Blackmun, J., dissenting
chologically, and perhaps legally speaking, this man, because
he is expressing and feeling considerable remorse and guilt,
may be inclined to exert less effort towards his own defense." Ibid. Nevertheless, under the circumstances, Dr.
Jurasky felt that Moran's depressed state of mind was not
"necessarily a major consideration." Ibid. Dr. William D.
O'Gorman also characterized Moran as "very depressed,"
remarking that he "showed much tearing in talking about
the episodes that led up to his present incarceration, particularly in talking about his ex-wife." Id., at 15-16. But
Dr. O'Gorman ultimately concluded that Moran "is knowledgeable of the charges being made against him" and "can
assist his attorney, in his own defense, if he so desires." Id.,
at 17.

In November 1984, just three months after his suicide attempt, Moran appeared in court seeking to discharge his
public defender, waive his right to counsel, and plead guilty
to all three charges of capital murder. When asked to explain the dramatic change in his chosen course of action,
Moran responded that he wished to represent himself because he opposed all efforts to mount a defense. His purpose, specifically, was to prevent the presentation of any mitigating evidence on his behalf at the sentencing phase of the
proceeding. The trial judge inquired whether Moran was
"presently under the influence of any drug or alcohol," and
Moran replied: "Just what they give me in, you know, medications." Id., at 33. Despite Moran's affirmative answer,
the trial judge failed to question him further regarding the
type, dosage, or effect of the "medications" to which he referred. Had the trial judge done so, he would have discovered that Moran was being administered simultaneously four
different prescription drugs--phenobarbital, dilantin, inderal, and vistaril. Moran later testified to the numbing effect
of these drugs, stating: "I guess I really didn't care about
anything . . . . I wasn't very concerned about anything that

was going on . . . as far as the proceedings and everything
were going." Id., at 92.1

Disregarding the mounting evidence of Moran's disturbed
mental state, the trial judge accepted Moran's waiver of
counsel and guilty pleas after posing a series of routine questions regarding his understanding of his legal rights and the
offenses, to which Moran gave largely monosyllabic answers.
In a string of affirmative responses, Moran purported to acknowledge that he knew the import of waiving his constitutional rights, that he understood the charges against him,
and that he was, in fact, guilty of those charges. One part
of this exchange, however, highlights the mechanical character of Moran's answers to the questions. When the trial
judge asked him whether he killed his ex-wife "deliberately,
with premeditation and malice aforethought," Moran unexpectedly responded: "No. I didn't do it--I mean, I wasn't
looking to kill her, but she ended up dead." Id., at 58. Instead of probing further, the trial judge simply repeated the
question, inquiring again whether Moran had acted deliberately. Once again, Moran replied: "I don't know. I mean, I
don't know what you mean by deliberately. I mean, I pulled
the trigger on purpose, but I didn't plan on doing it; you
know what I mean?" Id., at 59. Ignoring the ambiguity of
Moran's responses, the trial judge reframed the question to
elicit an affirmative answer, stating: "Well, I've previously
explained to you what is meant by deliberation and premeditation. Deliberate means that you arrived at or determined
as a result of careful thought and weighing the consideration

1 Moran's medical records, read in conjunction with the Physician's Desk
Reference (46 ed. 1992), corroborate his testimony concerning the medications he received and their impact upon him. The records show that
Moran was administered dilantin, an antiepileptic medication that may
cause confusion; inderal, a beta-blocker antiarrhythmic that may cause
light-headedness, mental depression, hallucinations, disorientation, and
short-term memory loss; and vistaril, a depressant that may cause drowsiness, tremors, and convulsions. App. 97-98.

Blackmun, J., dissenting
for and against the proposed action. Did you do that?"This time, Moran responded: "Yes." Ibid.

It was only after prodding Moran through the plea collo-quy in this manner that the trial judge concluded that he
was competent to stand trial and that he voluntarily andintelligently had waived his right to counsel. Accordingly,
Moran was allowed to plead guilty and appear without coun-sel at his sentencing hearing. Moran presented no defense,
called no witness, and offered no mitigating evidence on hisown behalf. Not surprisingly, he was sentenced to death.

II
It is axiomatic by now that criminal prosecution of an in-competent defendant offends the Due Process Clause of the

Fourteenth Amendment. See Medina v. California, 505U. S. 437 (1992);

Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U. S. 127, 138 (1992)(
Kennedy, J., concurring); Drope v. Missouri, 420 U. S. 162,171 (1975); Pate v. Robinson, 383 U. S. 375, 378 (1966). The

majority does not deny this principle, nor does it dispute thestandard that has been set for competence to stand trial with
the assistance of counsel: whether the accused possesses "thecapacity to understand the nature and object of the proceedings against him, to consult with counsel, and to assist inpreparing his defense."

Drope, 420 U. S., at 171. Accord,Dusky v. United States, 362 U. S. 402 (1960). My disagreement with the majority turns, then, upon another standard--the one for assessing a defendant's competence to waive
counsel and represent himself.The majority "reject[s] the notion that competence to
plead guilty or to waive the right to counsel must be meas-ured by a standard that is higher than (or even different
from)" the standard for competence to stand trial articulatedin

Dusky and Drope. Ante, at 398. But the standard forcompetence to stand trial is specifically designed to measure

a defendant's ability to "consult with counsel" and to "assistin preparing his defense." A finding that a defendant is

413Cite as: 509 U. S. 389 (1993)
Blackmun, J., dissenting
competent to stand trial establishes only that he is capableof aiding his attorney in making the critical decisions required at trial or in plea negotiations. The reliability oreven relevance of such a finding vanishes when its basic
premise--that counsel will be present--ceases to exist. The
question is no longer whether the defendant can proceedwith an attorney, but whether he can proceed alone and uncounseled. I do not believe we place an excessive burdenupon a trial court by requiring it to conduct a specific inquiry
into that question at the juncture when a defendant whosecompetency already has been questioned seeks to waive
counsel and represent himself.

The majority concludes that there is no need for such a
hearing because a defendant who is found competent to stand
trial with the assistance of counsel is, ipso facto, competent
to discharge counsel and represent himself. But the majority cannot isolate the term "competent" and apply it in a
vacuum, divorced from its specific context. A person who is
"competent" to play basketball is not thereby "competent"
to play the violin. The majority's monolithic approach to
competency is true to neither life nor the law. Competency
for one purpose does not necessarily translate to competency
for another purpose. See Bonnie, The Competence of Criminal Defendants: A Theoretical Reformulation, 10 Behav.
Sci. & L. 291, 299 (1992); R. Roesch & S. Golding, Competency to Stand Trial 10-13 (1980). Consistent with this
commonsense notion, our cases always have recognized that
"a defendant's mental condition may be relevant to more
than one legal issue, each governed by distinct rules reflecting quite different policies." Drope, 420 U. S., at 176. See
Jackson v. Indiana, 406 U. S. 715, 739 (1972). To this end,
this Court has required competency evaluations to be specifically tailored to the context and purpose of a proceeding.
See Rees v. Peyton, 384 U. S. 312, 314 (1966) (directing court
"to determine [petitioner's] mental competence in the present posture of things").

414 GODINEZ v. MORAN

Blackmun, J., dissenting
In Massey v. Moore, 348 U. S. 105, 108 (1954), for example,the Court ruled that a defendant who had been found competent to stand trial with the assistance of counsel should havebeen given a hearing as to his competency to represent himself because "[o]ne might not be insane in the sense of beingincapable of standing trial and yet lack the capacity to stand
trial without benefit of counsel." 2 And in Westbrook v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 150 (1966), the Court reiterated the require-ment that the determination of a defendant's competency be

tailored to the particular capacity in question, observing:"Although petitioner received a hearing on the issue of his
competence to stand trial, there appears to have been nohearing or inquiry into the issue of his competence to waive
his constitutional right to the assistance of counsel and pro-ceed, as he did, to conduct his own defense." See also

Me-dina, 505 U. S., at 446-448 (distinguishing between a claim of

incompetence and a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity);Riggins, 504 U. S., at 140-144 (

Kennedy, J., concurring) (dis-tinguishing between functional competence and competence

to stand trial).Although the Court never has articulated explicitly the
standard for determining competency to represent oneself,it has hinted at its contours. In Rees v. Peyton, supra, it
required an evaluation of competence that was designed tomeasure the abilities necessary for a defendant to make a
decision under analogous circumstances. In that case, a cap-ital defendant who had filed a petition for certiorari ordered
his attorney to withdraw the petition and forgo further legalproceedings. The petitioner's counsel advised the Court
that he could not conscientiously do so without a psychiatricexamination of his client because there was some doubt as to

2 The majority's attempt to distinguish Massey as a pre-Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 (1963), case, ante, at 399-400, n. 10, is simply irrelevant. For, as the majority itself concedes, Massey stands only for the proposition that the two inquiries are different--competency to stand trial with
the assistance of counsel is not equivalent to competency to proceed alone.

his client's mental competency. Under those circumstances,this Court directed the lower court to conduct an inquiry as

to whether the defendant possessed the "capacity to appreci-ate his position and make a rational choice with respect to
continuing or abandoning further litigation or on the otherhand whether he is suffering from a mental disease, disorder,
or defect which may substantially affect his capacity in thepremises." 384 U. S., at 314 (emphasis added). Certainly
the competency required for a capital defendant to proceed
without the advice of counsel at trial or in plea negotiationsshould be no less than the competency required for a capital

defendant to proceed against the advice of counsel to with-draw a petition for certiorari. The standard applied by the
Ninth Circuit in this case--the "reasoned choice" standard--closely approximates the "rational choice" standard set forth
in Rees.3Disregarding the plain language of Westbrook and Massey,
the majority in effect overrules those cases sub silentio.4From the constitutional right of self-representation established in Faretta v. California, 422 U. S. 806 (1975), the ma-jority extrapolates that "a criminal defendant's ability to represent himself has no bearing upon his competence to choose

3 According to the majority, "there is no indication . . . that the phrase
[`rational choice'] means something different from `rational understanding.' " Ante, at 398, n. 9. What the majority fails to recognize is that, in
the distinction between a defendant who possesses a "rational understanding" of the proceedings and one who is able to make a "rational choice,"
lies the difference between the capacity for passive and active involvement
in the proceedings.

4 According to the majority, "Westbrook stands only for the unremarkable proposition" that a determination of competence to stand trial is not
sufficient to waive the right to counsel; "the waiver must also be intelligent and voluntary before it can be accepted." Ante, at 401-402. But
the majority's attempt to transform a case about the competency to waive
counsel into a case about the voluntariness of a waiver needlessly complicates this area of the law. Perhaps competence to waive rights is incorporated into a voluntariness inquiry, but there is no necessary link between
the two concepts.

self-representation." Ante, at 400. But Faretta does notconfer upon an

incompetent defendant a constitutional right
to conduct his own defense. Indeed, Faretta himself was"literate, competent, and understanding," and the record

showed that "he was voluntarily exercising his informed free
will." 422 U. S., at 835. "Although a defendant need nothimself have the skill and experience of a lawyer,"

Faretta's
right of self-representation is confined to those who are ableto choose it "competently and intelligently."

Ibid. The
Faretta Court was careful to emphasize that the record mustestablish that the defendant " `knows what he is doing and

his choice is made with eyes open.' " Ibid., quoting Adams
v. United States ex rel. McCann, 317 U. S. 269, 279 (1942).

The majority asserts that "the competence that is required
of a defendant seeking to waive his right to counsel is the
competence to waive the right, not the competence to represent himself." Ante, at 399. But this assertion is simply
incorrect. The majority's attempt to extricate the competence to waive the right to counsel from the competence to
represent oneself is unavailing, because the former decision
necessarily entails the latter. It is obvious that a defendant
who waives counsel must represent himself. Even Moran,
who pleaded guilty, was required to defend himself during
the penalty phase of the proceedings. And a defendant who
is utterly incapable of conducting his own defense cannot be
considered "competent" to make such a decision, any more
than a person who chooses to leap out of a window in the
belief that he can fly can be considered "competent" to make
such a choice.

The record in this case gives rise to grave doubts regarding respondent Moran's ability to discharge counsel and represent himself. Just a few months after he attempted to
commit suicide, Moran essentially volunteered himself for
execution: He sought to waive the right to counsel, to plead
guilty to capital murder, and to prevent the presentation of
any mitigating evidence on his behalf. The psychiatrists' re509us2109L 05-09-97 08:15:10 PAGES OPINPGT

ports supplied one explanation for Moran's self-destructivebehavior: his deep depression. And Moran's own testimony

suggested another: the fact that he was being administeredsimultaneously four different prescription medications. It
has been recognized that such drugs often possess side ef-fects that may "compromise the right of a medicated criminal
defendant to receive a fair trial . . . by rendering him unableor unwilling to assist counsel."

Riggins, 504 U. S., at 142(
Kennedy, J., concurring). Moran's plea colloquy only aug-ments the manifold causes for concern by suggesting that his

waivers and his assent to the charges against him were notrendered in a truly voluntary and intelligent fashion. Upon
this evidence, there can be no doubt that the trial judgeshould have conducted another competency evaluation to determine Moran's capacity to waive the right to counsel andrepresent himself, instead of relying upon the psychiatrists'
reports that he was able to stand trial with the assistanceof counsel.

5

To try, convict, and punish one so helpless to defend him-self contravenes fundamental principles of fairness and impugns the integrity of our criminal justice system. I cannotcondone the decision to accept, without further inquiry, the
self-destructive "choice" of a person who was so deeply medi-cated and who might well have been severely mentally ill.
I dissent.

5 Whether this same evidence implies that Moran's waiver of counsel and
guilty pleas were also involuntary remains to be seen. Cf. Miller v. Fenton, 474 U. S. 104 (1985) (voluntariness is a mixed question of law and fact
entitled to independent federal review).

UNITED STATES et al. v. EDGE BROADCASTINGCO.,

t/a POWER 94

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fourth circuit

No. 92-486. Argued April 21, 1993--Decided June 25, 1993
Congress has enacted federal lottery legislation to assist States in their

efforts to control this form of gambling. Among other things, the
scheme generally prohibits the broadcast of any lottery advertisements,
18 U. S. C. $ 1304, but allows broadcasters to advertise state-run lotteries on stations licensed to a State which conducts such lotteries, $ 1307.
This exemption was enacted to accommodate the operation of legally
authorized state-run lotteries consistent with continued federal protection to nonlottery States' policies. North Carolina is a nonlottery State,
while Virginia sponsors a lottery. Respondent broadcaster (Edge)
owns and operates a radio station licensed by the Federal Communications Commission to serve a North Carolina community, and it broadcasts from near the Virginia-North Carolina border. Over 90% of its
listeners are in Virginia, but the remaining listeners live in nine North
Carolina counties. Wishing to broadcast Virginia lottery advertisements, Edge filed this action, alleging that, as applied to it, the restriction violated the First Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause.
The District Court assessed the restriction under the four-factor test
for commercial speech set forth in Central Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp.
v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 557, 566--(1) whether the
speech concerns lawful activity and is not misleading and (2) whether
the asserted governmental interest is substantial; and if so, (3) whether
the regulation directly advances the asserted interest and (4) whether
it is not more extensive than is necessary to serve the interest--concluding that the statutes, as applied to Edge, did not directly advance the
asserted governmental interest. The Court of Appeals affirmed.

Held: The judgment is reversed.
956 F. 2d 263, reversed.

Justice White delivered the opinion of the Court as to all but Part
III-D, concluding that the statutes regulate commercial speech in a manner that does not violate the First Amendment. Pp. 426-435, 436.

(a) Since the statutes are constitutional under Central Hudson, this
Court will not consider the Government's argument that the Court need
not proceed with a Central Hudson analysis because gambling implicates

Syllabus
no constitutionally protected right and the greater power to prohibit it
necessarily includes the lesser power to ban its advertisement. This
Court assumes that Central Hudson's first factor is met. As to the second factor, the Government has a substantial interest in supporting the
policy of nonlottery States and not interfering in the policy of lottery
States. Pp. 426-427.

(b) The question raised by the third Central Hudson factor cannot be
answered by limiting the inquiry to whether the governmental interest is
directly advanced as applied to a single entity, for even if it were not,
there would remain the matter of a regulation's general application to
others. Thus, the statutes' validity as applied to Edge, although relevant,
is properly addressed under the fourth factor. The statutes directly advance the governmental interest at stake as required by the third factor.
Rather than favoring lottery or nonlottery States, Congress chose to
support nonlottery States' antigambling policy without unduly interfering
with the policy of lottery States. Although Congress surely knew that
stations in one State could be heard in another, it made a commonsense
judgment that each North Carolina station would have an audience in that
State, even if its signal reached elsewhere, and that enforcing the restriction would insulate each station's listeners from lottery advertising and
advance the governmental purpose in supporting North Carolina's gambling laws. Pp. 427-429.

(c) Under the fourth Central Hudson factor, the statutes are valid as
applied to Edge. The validity of commercial speech restrictions should
be judged by standards no more stringent than those applied to expressive
conduct entitled to full First Amendment protection or to relevant time,
place, or manner restrictions, Board of Trustees of State Univ. of N. Y.
v. Fox, 492 U. S. 469, 477-478; the fit between the restriction and the
government interest need only be reasonable, id., at 480. Here, the fit is
reasonable. Allowing Edge to carry the lottery advertisements to North
Carolina counties would be in derogation of the federal interest in supporting the State's antilottery laws and would permit Virginia's lottery
laws to dictate what stations in a neighboring State may air. The restriction's validity is judged by the relation it bears to the general problem of
accommodating both lottery and nonlottery States, not by the extent to
which it furthers the Government's interest in an individual case. Ward
v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781, 801. Nothing in Edenfield v.
Fane, 507 U. S. 761, suggested that an individual could challenge a commercial speech regulation as applied only to himself or his own acts.
Pp. 429-431.

(d) The courts below also erred in holding that the restriction as applied
to Edge was ineffective and gave only remote support to the Government's

interest. The exclusion of gambling invitations from an estimated 11% of
the radio listening time in the nine-county area could hardly be called
"ineffective," "remote," or "conditional." See Central Hudson, supra, at
564, 569. Nor could it be called only "limited incremental support,"
Bolger v. Youngs Drug Products Corp., 463 U. S. 60, 73, for the Goverment
interest, or thought to furnish only speculative or marginal support. The
restriction is not made ineffective by the fact that Virginia radio and television stations with lottery advertising can be heard in North Carolina.
Many residents of the nine-county area will still be exposed to very few
or no such advertisements. Moreover, the Government may be said to
advance its purpose by substantially reducing lottery advertising, even
where it is not wholly eradicated. Pp. 431-435.

In this case we must decide whether federal statutes thatprohibit the broadcast of lottery advertising by a broadcaster

While lotteries have existed in this country since its found-ing, States have long viewed them as a hazard to their citizens and to the public interest, and have long engaged inlegislative efforts to control this form of gambling. Congress has, since the early 19th century, sought to assist theStates in controlling lotteries. See,

e. g., Act of Mar. 2, 1827,$ 6, 4 Stat. 238; Act of July 27, 1868, $ 13, 15 Stat. 196; Act of

June 8, 1872, $ 149, 17 Stat. 302. In 1876, Congress madeit a crime to deposit in the mails any letters or circulars
concerning lotteries, whether illegal or chartered by state
legislatures. See Act of July 12, 1876, ch. 186, $ 2, 19 Stat.90, codified at Rev. Stat. $ 3894 (2d ed. 1878). This Court

rejected a challenge to the 1876 Act on First Amendmentgrounds in

Ex parte Jackson, 96 U. S. 727 (1878). In response to the persistence of lotteries, particularly the Louisi-ana Lottery, Congress closed a loophole allowing the advertisement of lotteries in newspapers in the Anti-Lottery Act
of 1890, ch. 908, $ 1, 26 Stat. 465, codified at Supp. to Rev.Stat. $ 3894 (2d ed. 1891), and this Court upheld that Act

against a First Amendment challenge in In re Rapier, 143

424 UNITED STATES v. EDGE BROADCASTING CO.

Opinion of the Court
Power 94. Because Edge is licensed to serve a North Caro-lina community, the federal statute prohibits it from broadcasting advertisements for the Virginia lottery. Edge de-rives 95% of its advertising revenue from Virginia sources,
and claims that it has lost large sums of money from itsinability to carry Virginia lottery advertisements.

Edge entered federal court in the Eastern District of Virginia, seeking a declaratory judgment that, as applied to it,$$ 1304 and 1307, together with corresponding FCC regulations, violated the First Amendment to the Constitution andthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth, as well as
injunctive protection against the enforcement of those stat-utes and regulations.

The District Court recognized that Congress has greater
latitude to regulate broadcasting than other forms of commu-nication. App. to Pet. for Cert. 14a-15a. The District

Court construed the statutes not to cover the broadcast ofnoncommercial information about lotteries, a construction
that the Government did not oppose. With regard to therestriction on advertising, the District Court evaluated the
statutes under the established four-factor test for commercial speech set forth in Central Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v.
Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 557, 566 (1980):

"At the outset, we must determine whether the expression is protected by the First Amendment. [1] Forcommercial speech to come within that provision, it at

least must concern lawful activity and not be misleading.
Next, we ask [2] whether the asserted governmentalinterest is substantial. If both inquiries yield positive

answers, we must determine [3] whether the regulationdirectly advances the governmental interest asserted,
and [4] whether it is not more extensive than is neces-sary to serve that interest."

Assuming that the advertising Edge wished to air woulddeal with the Virginia lottery, a legal activity, and would not
be misleading, the court went on to hold that the second and

Opinion of the Court
fourth Central Hudson factors were satisfied: the statuteswere supported by a substantial governmental interest, and

the restrictions were no more extensive than necessary toserve that interest, which was to discourage participating in
lotteries in States that prohibited lotteries. The court held,however, that the statutes, as applied to Edge, did not directly advance the asserted governmental interest, failed the
Central Hudson test in this respect, and hence could not beconstitutionally applied to Edge. A divided Court of Appeals, in an unpublished per curiam opinion,3 affirmed in allrespects, also rejecting the Government's submission that
the District Court had erred in judging the validity of thestatutes on an "as applied" standard, that is, determining
whether the statutes directly served the governmental in-terest in a substantial way solely on the effect of applying
them to Edge. Judgt. order reported at 956 F. 2d 263(CA4 1992).

Because the court below declared a federal statute uncon-stitutional and applied reasoning that was questionable
under our cases relating to the regulation of commercialspeech, we granted certiorari. 506 U. S. 1032 (1992). We
reverse. II

The Government argues first that gambling implicates noconstitutionally protected right, but rather falls within a category of activities normally considered to be "vices," andthat the greater power to prohibit gambling necessarily includes the lesser power to ban its advertisement; it arguesthat we therefore need not proceed with a Central Hudson
analysis. The Court of Appeals did not address this issueand neither do we, for the statutes are not unconstitutional
under the standards of Central Hudson applied by thecourts below.

3 We deem it remarkable and unusual that although the Court of Appeals
affirmed a judgment that an Act of Congress was unconstitutional as applied, the court found it appropriate to announce its judgment in an unpublished per curiam opinion.

Opinion of the Court

III
For most of this Nation's history, purely commercial adver-tising was not considered to implicate the constitutional protection of the First Amendment. See Valentine v. Chrestensen, 316 U. S. 52, 54 (1942). In 1976, the Court extendedFirst Amendment protection to speech that does no more

than propose a commercial transaction. See Virginia StateBd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council,
Inc., 425 U. S. 748 (1976). Our decisions, however, haverecognized the " `common-sense' distinction between speech
proposing a commercial transaction, which occurs in an areatraditionally subject to government regulation, and other
varieties of speech." Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Assn., 436U. S. 447, 455-456 (1978). The Constitution therefore affords a lesser protection to commercial speech than to otherconstitutionally guaranteed expression.

Board of Trustees
of State Univ. of N. Y. v. Fox, 492 U. S. 469, 477 (1989);Central Hudson, supra, at 563; Ohralik, supra, at 456.

In Central Hudson, we set out the general scheme for as-sessing government restrictions on commercial speech. 447
U. S., at 566. Like the courts below, we assume that Edge,if allowed to, would air nonmisleading advertisements about
the Virginia lottery, a legal activity. As to the second Central Hudson factor, we are quite sure that the Governmenthas a substantial interest in supporting the policy of nonlottery States, as well as not interfering with the policy ofStates that permit lotteries. As in Posadas de Puerto Rico
Associates v. Tourism Co. of P. R., 478 U. S. 328 (1986), theactivity underlying the relevant advertising--gambling--
implicates no constitutionally protected right; rather, itfalls into a category of "vice" activity that could be,
and frequently has been, banned altogether. As willlater be discussed, we also agree that the statutes are no
broader than necessary to advance the Government's inter-est and hence the fourth part of the

Central Hudson testis satisfied.

427Cite as: 509 U. S. 418 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
The Court of Appeals, however, affirmed the DistrictCourt's holding that the statutes were invalid because, as

applied to Edge, they failed to advance directly the govern-mental interest supporting them. According to the Court
of Appeals, whose judgment we are reviewing, this was be-cause the 127,000 people who reside in Edge's nine-county
listening area in North Carolina receive most of their radio,newspaper, and television communications from Virginiabased media. These North Carolina residents who mightlisten to Edge "are inundated with Virginia's lottery advertisements" and hence, the court stated, prohibiting Edgefrom advertising Virginia's lottery "is ineffective in shielding
North Carolina residents from lottery information." This"ineffective or remote measure to support North Carolina's
desire to discourage gambling cannot justify infringementupon commercial free speech." App. to Pet. for Cert. 6a, 7a.
In our judgment, the courts below erred in that respect.

A
The third Central Hudson factor asks whether the "regu-lation directly advances the governmental interest asserted." 447 U. S., at 566. It is readily apparent that thisquestion cannot be answered by limiting the inquiry to
whether the governmental interest is directly advanced asapplied to a single person or entity. Even if there were no
advancement as applied in that manner--in this case, as ap-plied to Edge--there would remain the matter of the regulation's general application to others--in this case, to all otherradio and television stations in North Carolina and countrywide. The courts below thus asked the wrong question inruling on the third

Central Hudson factor. This is not tosay that the validity of the statutes' application to Edge is

an irrelevant inquiry, but that issue properly should be dealtwith under the fourth factor of the Central Hudson test.
As we have said, "[t]he last two steps of the Central Hudsonanalysis basically involve a consideration of the `fit' between

Opinion of the Court
the legislature's ends and the means chosen to accomplishthose ends."

Posadas, supra, at 341.
We have no doubt that the statutes directly advanced thegovernmental interest at stake in this case. In response to

the appearance of state-sponsored lotteries, Congress might
have continued to ban all radio or television lottery adver-tisements, even by stations in States that have legalized lotteries. This it did not do. Neither did it permit stationssuch as Edge, located in a nonlottery State, to carry lottery
ads if their signals reached into a State that sponsors lotter-ies; similarly, it did not forbid stations in a lottery State such
as Virginia from carrying lottery ads if their signals reached
into an adjoining State such as North Carolina where lotteries were illegal. Instead of favoring either the lottery or
the nonlottery State, Congress opted to support the antigambling policy of a State like North Carolina by forbidding stations in such a State to air lottery advertising. At the same
time it sought not to unduly interfere with the policy of a
lottery-sponsoring State such as Virginia. Virginia could
advertise its lottery through radio and television stations licensed to Virginia locations, even if their signals reached
deep into North Carolina. Congress surely knew that stations in one State could often be heard in another but expressly prevented each and every North Carolina station,
including Edge, from carrying lottery ads. Congress plainly
made the commonsense judgment that each North Carolina
station would have an audience in that State, even if its signal reached elsewhere and that enforcing the statutory restriction would insulate each station's listeners from lottery
ads and hence advance the governmental purpose of supporting North Carolina's laws against gambling. This congressional policy of balancing the interests of lottery and nonlottery States is the substantial governmental interest that
satisfies Central Hudson, the interest which the courts
below did not fully appreciate. It is also the interest that is
directly served by applying the statutory restriction to all

429Cite as: 509 U. S. 418 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
stations in North Carolina; and this would plainly be the caseeven if, as applied to Edge, there were only marginal advancement of that interest. B

Left unresolved, of course, is the validity of applying thestatutory restriction to Edge, an issue that we now address
under the fourth Central Hudson factor, i. e., whether theregulation is more extensive than is necessary to serve the
governmental interest. We revisited that aspect of Central
Hudson in Board of Trustees of State Univ. of N. Y. v. Fox,492 U. S. 469 (1989), and concluded that the validity of restrictions on commercial speech should not be judged bystandards more stringent than those applied to expressive
conduct entitled to full First Amendment protection or torelevant time, place, or manner restrictions. Id., at 477-

478. We made clear in Fox that our commercial speechcases require a fit between the restriction and the government interest that is not necessarily perfect, but reasonable.
Id., at 480. This was also the approach in Posadas, 478U. S., at 344.

We have no doubt that the fit in this case was a reasonableone. Although Edge was licensed to serve the Elizabeth
City area, it chose to broadcast from a more northerly posi-tion, which allowed its signal to reach into the Hampton
Roads, Virginia, metropolitan area. Allowing it to carry lot-tery ads reaching over 90% of its listeners, all in Virginia,
would surely enhance its revenues. But just as surely, be-cause Edge's signals with lottery ads would be heard in the
nine counties in North Carolina that its broadcasts reached,this would be in derogation of the substantial federal interest
in supporting North Carolina's laws making lotteries illegal.In this posture, to prevent Virginia's lottery policy from dictating what stations in a neighboring State may air, it isreasonable to require Edge to comply with the restriction
against carrying lottery advertising. In other words, apply-ing the restriction to a broadcaster such as Edge directly

509us2110D 05-04-97 18:09:09 PAGES OPINPGT
430 UNITED STATES v. EDGE BROADCASTING CO.

Opinion of the Court
advances the governmental interest in enforcing the restriction in nonlottery States, while not interfering with the policy of lottery States like Virginia. We think this would be
the case even if it were true, which it is not, that applying
the general statutory restriction to Edge, in isolation, would
no more than marginally insulate the North Carolinians in
the North Carolina counties served by Edge from hearing
lottery ads.

In Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781 (1989), we
dealt with a time, place, or manner restriction that required
the city to control the sound level of musical concerts in a
city park, concerts that were fully protected by the First
Amendment. We held there that the requirement of narrow
tailoring was met if "the . . . regulation promotes a substantial government interest that would be achieved less effectively absent the regulation," provided that it did not burden
substantially more speech than necessary to further the government's legitimate interests. Id., at 799 (internal quotation marks omitted). In the course of upholding the restriction, we went on to say that "the validity of the regulation
depends on the relation it bears to the overall problem the
government seeks to correct, not on the extent to which it
furthers the government's interest in an individual case."
Id., at 801.

The Ward holding is applicable here, for we have observed
that the validity of time, place, or manner restrictions is determined under standards very similar to those applicable in
the commercial speech context and that it would be incompatible with the subordinate position of commercial speech
in the scale of First Amendment values to apply a more rigid
standard to commercial speech than is applied to fully protected speech. Fox, supra, at 477, 478. Ward thus teaches
us that we judge the validity of the restriction in this case
by the relation it bears to the general problem of accommodating the policies of both lottery and nonlottery States, not

431Cite as: 509 U. S. 418 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
by the extent to which it furthers the Government's interestin an individual case.

This is consistent with the approach we have taken in thecommercial speech context. In Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar
Assn., 436 U. S., at 462, for example, an attorney attackedthe validity of a rule against solicitation "not facially, but as
applied to his acts of solicitation." We rejected the appel-lant's view that his "as applied" challenge required the State
to show that his particular conduct in fact trenched on theinterests that the regulation sought to protect. We stated
that in the general circumstances of the appellant's acts, theState had "a strong interest in adopting and enforcing rules
of conduct designed to protect the public." Id., at 464.This having been established, the State was entitled to protect its interest by applying a prophylactic rule to those cir-cumstances generally; we declined to require the State to go
further and to prove that the state interests supporting therule actually were advanced by applying the rule in Ohralik's
particular case.

Edenfield v. Fane, 507 U. S. 761 (1993), is not to the con-trary. While treating Fane's claim as an as applied challenge to a broad category of commercial solicitation, we didnot suggest that Fane could challenge the regulation on commercial speech as applied only to himself or his own actsof solicitation.

C
We also believe that the courts below were wrong in hold-ing that as applied to Edge itself, the restriction at issue was

ineffective and gave only remote support to the Govern-ment's interest.

As we understand it, both the Court of Appeals and theDistrict Court recognized that Edge's potential North Carolina audience was the 127,000 residents of nine North Caro-lina counties, that enough of them regularly or from time to
time listen to Edge to account for 11% of all radio listeningin those counties, and that while listening to Edge they heard

509us2110D 05-04-97 18:09:09 PAGES OPINPGT
432 UNITED STATES v. EDGE BROADCASTING CO.

Opinion of the Court
no lottery advertisements. It could hardly be denied, and
neither court below purported to deny, that these facts,
standing alone, would clearly show that applying the statutory restriction to Edge would directly serve the statutory
purpose of supporting North Carolina's antigambling policy
by excluding invitations to gamble from 11% of the radio
listening time in the nine-county area. Without more, this
result could hardly be called either "ineffective," "remote,"
or "conditional," see Central Hudson, 447 U. S., at 564, 569.
Nor could it be called only "limited incremental support,"
Bolger v. Youngs Drug Products Corp., 463 U. S. 60, 73
(1983), for the Government interest, or thought to furnish
only speculative or marginal support. App. to Pet. for Cert.
24a, 25a. Otherwise, any North Carolina radio station with
127,000 or fewer potential listeners would be permitted to
carry lottery ads because of its marginal significance in serving the State's interest.

Of course, both courts below pointed out, and rested their
judgment on the fact, that the 127,000 people in North Carolina who might listen to Edge also listened to Virginia radio
stations and television stations that regularly carried lottery
ads. Virginia newspapers carrying such material also were
available to them. This exposure, the courts below thought,
was sufficiently pervasive to prevent the restriction on Edge
from furnishing any more than ineffective or remote support
for the statutory purpose. We disagree with this conclusion
because in light of the facts relied on, it represents too limited a view of what amounts to direct advancement of the
governmental interest that is present in this case.

Even if all of the residents of Edge's North Carolina service area listen to lottery ads from Virginia stations, it would
still be true that 11% of radio listening time in that area
would remain free of such material. If Edge is allowed to
advertise the Virginia lottery, the percentage of listening
time carrying such material would increase from 38% to 49%.

433Cite as: 509 U. S. 418 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
We do not think that Central Hudson compels us to considerthis consequence to be without significance.

The Court of Appeals indicated that Edge's potential audi-ence of 127,000 persons were "inundated" by the Virginia
media carrying lottery advertisements. But the DistrictCourt found that only 38% of all radio listening in the ninecounty area was directed at stations that broadcast lotteryadvertising.

4 With respect to television, the District Court

observed that American adults spend 60% of their media con-sumption time listening to, or watching, television. The evidence before it also indicated that in four of the nine countiesserved by Edge, 75% of all television viewing was directed
at Virginia stations; in three others, the figure was between50 and 75%; and in the remaining two counties, between 25
and 50%. Even if it is assumed that all of these stationscarry lottery advertising, it is very likely that a great many
people in the nine-county area are exposed to very little orno lottery advertising carried on television. Virginia newspapers are also circulated in Edge's area, 10,400 daily and12,500 on Sundays, hardly enough to constitute a pervasive
exposure to lottery advertising, even on the unlikely assump-tion that the readers of those newspapers always look for
and read the lottery ads. Thus the District Court observedonly that "a

significant number of residents of [the nine-county] area listens to" Virginia radio and television stations

and read Virginia newspapers. App. to Pet. for Cert. 25a(emphasis added).

Moreover, to the extent that the courts below assumedthat $$ 1304 and 1307 would have to effectively shield North
Carolina residents from information about lotteries to ad-vance their purpose, they were mistaken. As the Government asserts, the statutes were not "adopt[ed] . . . to keep

4 It would appear, then, that 51% of the radio listening time in the relevant nine counties is attributable to other North Carolina stations or other
stations not carrying lottery advertising.

North Carolina residents ignorant of the Virginia Lottery

interest in discouraging public participation in lotteries, even
as they accommodate the countervailing interests of lottery
States. Reply Brief for Petitioners 11. Within the bounds
of the general protection provided by the Constitution to
commercial speech, we allow room for legislative judgments.
Fox, 492 U. S., at 480. Here, as in Posadas de Puerto Rico,
the Government obviously legislated on the premise that
the advertising of gambling serves to increase the demand
for the advertised product. See Posadas, 478 U. S., at 344.
See also Central Hudson, supra, at 569. Congress clearly
was entitled to determine that broadcast of promotional advertising of lotteries undermines North Carolina's policy
against gambling, even if the North Carolina audience is not
wholly unaware of the lottery's existence. Congress has, for
example, altogether banned the broadcast advertising of cigarettes, even though it could hardly have believed that this
regulation would keep the public wholly ignorant of the
availability of cigarettes. See 15 U. S. C. $ 1335. See also
Queensgate Investment Co. v. Liquor Control Comm'n, 69
Ohio St. 2d 361, 366, 433 N. E. 138, 142 (alcohol advertising),
app. dism'd for want of a substantial federal question, 459
U. S. 807 (1982). Nor do we require that the Government
make progress on every front before it can make progress
on any front. If there is an immediate connection between
advertising and demand, and the federal regulation decreases advertising, it stands to reason that the policy of decreasing demand for gambling is correspondingly advanced.
Accordingly, the Government may be said to advance its
purpose by substantially reducing lottery advertising, even
where it is not wholly eradicated.

Thus, even if it were proper to conduct a Central Hudson
analysis of the statutes only as applied to Edge, we would
not agree with the courts below that the restriction at issue

Opinion of White, J.
here, which prevents Edge from broadcasting lottery advertising to its sizable radio audience in North Carolina, is rendered ineffective by the fact that Virginia radio and television programs can be heard in North Carolina. In our view,
the restriction, even as applied only to Edge, directly advances the governmental interest within the meaning of
Central Hudson.

D

Nor need we be blind to the practical effect of adopting
respondent's view of the level of particularity of analysis appropriate to decide its case. Assuming for the sake of argument that Edge had a valid claim that the statutes violated
Central Hudson only as applied to it, the piecemeal approach
it advocates would act to vitiate the Government's ability
generally to accommodate States with differing policies.
Edge has chosen to transmit from a location near the border
between two jurisdictions with different rules, and rests its
case on the spillover from the jurisdiction across the border.
Were we to adopt Edge's approach, we would treat a station
that is close to the line as if it were on the other side of it,
effectively extending the legal regime of Virginia inside
North Carolina. One result of holding for Edge on this basis
might well be that additional North Carolina communities,
farther from the Virginia border, would receive broadcast
lottery advertising from Edge. Broadcasters licensed to
these communities, as well as other broadcasters serving
Elizabeth City, would then be able to complain that lottery
advertising from Edge and other similar broadcasters renders the federal statute ineffective as applied to them. Because the approach Edge advocates has no logical stopping
point once state boundaries are ignored, this process might
be repeated until the policy of supporting North Carolina's
ban on lotteries would be seriously eroded. We are unwilling to start down that road.

speech in a manner that does not violate the First Amend-ment, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is

Reversed.
Justice Souter, with whom Justice Kennedy joins,
concurring in part.

I agree with the Court that the restriction at issue here is
constitutional under our decision in Central Hudson Gas &
Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 557
(1980), even if that restriction is judged "as applied to Edgeitself."

Ante, at 431. I accordingly believe it unnecessary
to decide whether the restriction might appropriately be re-viewed at a more lenient level of generality, and I take no

position on that question.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Blackmun joins,
dissenting.

Three months ago this Court reaffirmed that the proponents of a restriction on commercial speech bear the burden
of demonstrating a "reasonable fit" between the legislature's
goals and the means chosen to effectuate those goals. See
Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, Inc., 507 U. S. 410, 416
(1993). While the " `fit' " between means and ends need not
be perfect, an infringement on constitutionally protected
speech must be " `in proportion to the interest served.' "
Id., at 417, n. 12 (quoting Board of Trustees of State Univ.
of N. Y. v. Fox, 492 U. S. 469, 480 (1989)). In my opinion, the
Federal Government's selective ban on lottery advertising
unquestionably flunks that test; for the means chosen by the
Government, a ban on speech imposed for the purpose of
manipulating public behavior, is in no way proportionate
to the Federal Government's asserted interest in protecting
the antilottery policies of nonlottery States. Accordingly,
I respectfully dissent.

As the Court acknowledges, the United States does notassert a general interest in restricting state-run lotteries.

Indeed, it could not, as it has affirmatively removed restric-tions on use of the airwaves and mails for the promotion of
such lotteries. See ante, at 421-423. Rather, the federalinterest in this case is entirely derivative. By tying the
right to broadcast advertising regarding a state-run lotteryto whether the State in which the broadcaster is located itself sponsors a lottery, Congress sought to support nonlot-tery States in their efforts to "discourag[e] public participation in lotteries." Ante, at 422-423, 434.1Even assuming that nonlottery States desire such assistance from the Federal Government--an assumption thatmust be made without any supporting evidence--I would
hold that suppressing truthful advertising regarding a neigh-boring State's lottery, an activity which is, of course, perfectly legal, is a patently unconstitutional means of effectuat-ing the Government's asserted interest in protecting the
policies of nonlottery States. Indeed, I had thought that wehad so held almost two decades ago.

In Bigelow v. Virginia, 421 U. S. 809 (1975), this Courtrecognized that a State had a legitimate interest in protecting the welfare of its citizens as they ventured outside theState's borders.

Id., at 824. We flatly rejected the notion,however, that a State could effectuate that interest by suppressing truthful, nonmisleading information regarding alegal activity in another State. We held that a State "may

1 At one point in its opinion, the Court identifies the relevant federal
interest as "supporting North Carolina's laws making lotteries illegal."
Ante, at 429. Of course, North Carolina law does not, and, presumably,
could not, bar its citizens from traveling across the state line and participating in the Virginia lottery. North Carolina law does not make the
Virginia lottery illegal. I take the Court to mean that North Carolina's
decision not to institute a state-run lottery reflects its policy judgment
that participation in such lotteries, even those conducted by another State,
is detrimental to the public welfare, and that 18 U. S. C. $ 1307 (1988 ed.
and Supp. III) represents a federal effort to respect that policy judgment.

not, under the guise of exercising internal police powers, bara citizen of another State from disseminating information

about an activity that is legal in that State." Id., at 824-825.To be sure, the advertising in Bigelow related to abortion, a
constitutionally protected right, and the Court in Posadas de
Puerto Rico Associates v. Tourism Co. of P. R., 478 U. S. 328(1986), relied on that fact in dismissing the force of our holding in that case, see id., at 345. But even a casual readingof Bigelow demonstrates that the case cannot fairly be read
so narrowly. The fact that the information in the advertise-ment related to abortion was only one factor informing the
Court's determination that there were substantial FirstAmendment interests at stake in the State's attempt to suppress truthful advertising about a legal activity in anotherState:

"Viewed in its entirety, the advertisement conveyedinformation of potential interest and value to a diverse
audience--not only to readers possibly in need of theservices offered, but also to those with a general curiosity about, or genuine interest in, the subject matter orthe law of another State and its development, and to
readers seeking reform in Virginia. The mere exist-ence of the [organization advertising abortion-related
services] in New York City, with the possibility of itsbeing typical of other organizations there, and the availability of the services offered, were not unnewsworthy.Also the activity advertised pertained to constitutional
interests." Bigelow, 421 U. S., at 822.2
2 The analogy to Bigelow and this case is even closer than one might
think. The North Carolina General Assembly is currently considering
whether to institute a state-operated lottery. See 1993 N. C. S. Bill No.
11, 140th Gen. Assembly. As with the advertising at issue in Bigelow,
then, advertising relating to the Virginia lottery may be of interest to
those in North Carolina who are currently debating whether that State
should join the ranks of the growing number of States that sponsor a
lottery. See infra, at 441.

Bigelow is not about a woman's constitutionally protected
right to terminate a pregnancy.3 It is about paternalism,
and informational protectionism. It is about one State's interference with its citizens' fundamental constitutional right
to travel in a state of enlightenment, not governmentinduced ignorance. Cf. Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U. S. 618,
629-631 (1969).4 I would reaffirm this basic First Amendment principle. In seeking to assist nonlottery States in
their efforts to shield their citizens from the perceived dangers emanating from a neighboring State's lottery, the Federal Government has not regulated the content of such advertisements to ensure that they are not misleading, nor has
it provided for the distribution of more speech, such as warnings or educational information about gambling. Rather,
the United States has selected the most intrusive, and dangerous, form of regulation possible--a ban on truthful information regarding a lawful activity imposed for the purpose
of manipulating, through ignorance, the consumer choices of
some of its citizens. Unless justified by a truly substantial
governmental interest, this extreme, and extremely paternalistic, measure surely cannot withstand scrutiny under the
First Amendment.

3 If anything, the fact that underlying conduct is not constitutionally
protected increases, not decreases, the value of unfettered exchange of
information across state lines. When a State has proscribed a certain
product or service, its citizens are all the more dependent on truthful
information regarding the policies and practices of other States. Cf. Bray
v. Alexandria Women's Health Clinic, 506 U. S. 263, 332 (1993) (Stevens,
J., dissenting). The alternative is to view individuals as more in the
nature of captives of their respective States than as free citizens of a
larger polity.

4 "For all the great purposes for which the Federal government was

formed, we are one people, with one common country. We are all citizens
of the United States; and, as members of the same community, must have
the right to pass and repass through every part of it without interruption, as freely as in our own States." Passenger Cases, 7 How. 283, 492

440 UNITED STATES v. EDGE BROADCASTING CO.

Stevens, J., dissenting
No such interest is asserted in this case. With barely awhisper of analysis, the Court concludes that a State's interest in discouraging lottery participation by its citizens issurely "substantial"--a necessary prerequisite to sustain a
restriction on commercial speech, see Central Hudson Gas &
Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 557,566 (1980)--because gambling "falls into a category of `vice'

activity that could be, and frequently has been, banned alto-gether," ante, at 426.

I disagree. While a State may indeed have an interestin discouraging its citizens from participating in state-run
lotteries,5 it does not necessarily follow that its interest is"substantial" enough to justify an infringement on constitutionally protected speech,6 especially one as draconian as theregulation at issue in this case. In my view, the sea change
in public attitudes toward state-run lotteries that this coun-try has witnessed in recent years undermines any claim that
a State's interest in discouraging its citizens from participat-ing in state-run lotteries is so substantial as to outweigh respondent's First Amendment right to distribute, and thepublic's right to receive, truthful, nonmisleading information
about a perfectly legal activity conducted in a neighboringState.

While the Court begins its opinion with a discussion ofthe federal and state efforts in the 19th century to restrict
lotteries, it largely ignores the fact that today hostility tostate-run lotteries is the exception rather than the norm.

5 A State might reasonably conclude, for example, that lotteries play on
the hopes of those least able to afford to purchase lottery tickets, and
that its citizens would be better served by spending their money on more
promising investments. The fact that I happen to share these concerns
regarding state-sponsored lotteries is, of course, irrelevant to the proper
analysis of the legal issue.

6 See, e. g., Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, Inc., 507 U. S. 410, 417,

n. 13 (1993) (noting that restrictions on commercial speech are subject to
more searching scrutiny than mere "rational basis" review).

Thirty-four States and the District of Columbia now sponsora lottery.

7 Three more States will initiate lotteries this

year.8 Of the remaining 13 States, at least 5 States haverecently considered or are currently considering establishing

a lottery.9 In fact, even the State of North Carolina, whoseantilottery policies the Federal Government's advertising
ban are purportedly buttressing in this case, is consideringestablishing a lottery. See 1993 N. C. S. Bill No. 11, 140th
Gen. Assembly. According to one estimate, by the end ofthis decade all but two States (Utah and Nevada) will have
state-run lotteries.10The fact that the vast majority of the States currently
sponsor a lottery, and that soon virtually all of them will doso, does not, of course, preclude an outlier State from following a different course and attempting to discourage its citi-zens from partaking of such activities. But just as the fact
that "the vast majority of the 50 States . . . prohibit[ed] ca-sino gambling" purported to inform the Court's conclusion
in Posadas de Puerto Rico Associates v. Tourism Co. ofP. R., 478 U. S., at 341, that Puerto Rico had a "substantial"
interest in discouraging such gambling, the national trend inthe opposite direction in this case surely undermines the
United States' contention that nonlottery States have a "sub-stantial" interest in discouraging their citizens from traveling across state lines and participating in a neighboringState's lottery. The Federal Government and the States
simply do not have an overriding or "substantial" interest in

TXO PRODUCTION CORP. v. ALLIANCERESOURCES CORP.

et al.

certiorari to the supreme court of appeals ofwest virginia

No. 92-479. Argued March 31, 1993--Decided June 25, 1993
In a common-law slander of title action in West Virginia state court, respondents obtained a judgment against petitioner TXO Production
Corp. for $19,000 in actual damages and $10 million in punitive damages.
Accepting respondents' version of disputed issues of fact, the record
shows, inter alia, that TXO knew that respondent Alliance Resources
Corp. had good title to the oil and gas development rights at issue; that
TXO acted in bad faith by advancing a claim on those rights on the
basis of a worthless quitclaim deed in an effort to renegotiate its royalty
arrangement with Alliance; that the anticipated gross revenues from oil
and gas development--and therefore the amount of royalties that TXO
sought to renegotiate--were substantial; that TXO was a large, wealthy
company; and that TXO had engaged in similar nefarious activities in
other parts of the country. In affirming, the State Supreme Court of
Appeals, among other things, rejected TXO's contention that the punitive damages award violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment as interpreted in Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Haslip, 499
U. S. 1.

Held: The judgment is affirmed.
187 W. Va. 457, 419 S. E. 2d 870, affirmed.

Justice Stevens, joined by The Chief Justice and Justice
Blackmun, concluded in Parts II and III that the punitive damages
award did not violate the substantive component of the Due Process
Clause. Pp. 453-462.

(a) With respect to the question whether a particular punitive award
is so "grossly excessive" as to violate the Due Process Clause, WatersPierce Oil Co. v. Texas (No. 1), 212 U. S. 86, 111, this Court need not,
and indeed cannot, draw a mathematical bright line between the constitutionally acceptable and the constitutionally unacceptable that would
fit every case. It can be said, however, that a general concern of
reasonableness properly enters into the constitutional calculus. See
Haslip, 499 U. S., at 18. Although the parties' desire to formulate a
"test" is understandable, neither respondents' proposed rational-basis
standard nor TXO's proposed heightened-scrutiny standard is satisfactory. Pp. 453-458.

(b) The punitive award in this case was not so "grossly excessive"
as to violate due process. The dramatic disparity between the actual
damages and the punitive award is not controlling in a case of this character. On the record, the jury may reasonably have determined that
TXO set out on a malicious and fraudulent course to win back, either in
whole or in part, the lucrative stream of royalties that it had ceded to
Alliance. The punitive award is certainly large, but in light of the millions of dollars potentially at stake, TXO's bad faith, the fact that TXO's
scheme was part of a larger pattern of fraud, trickery, and deceit, and
TXO's wealth, the award cannot be said to be beyond the power of the
State to allow. Pp. 459-462.

Justice Stevens, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice Blackmun, and Justice Kennedy, concluded in Part IV that TXO's procedural due process arguments--that the jury was not adequately instructed, that the punitive damages award was not adequately reviewed
by the trial or the appellate court, and that TXO had no advance notice
that the jury might be allowed to return such a large award or to rely
on potential harm as a basis for the award--must be rejected. The first
argument need not be addressed as it was not presented or passed on
below, and the remaining arguments are meritless. Pp. 462-466.

Justice Kennedy concluded that the plurality's "reasonableness"
formulation is unsatisfactory, since it does not provide a standard by
which to compare the punishment to the malefaction that gave rise to it.
A more manageable constitutional inquiry focuses not on the amount of
money a jury awards in a particular case but on its reasons for doing
so. When a punitive damages award reflects bias, passion, or prejudice
by the jury, rather than a rational concern for deterrence and retribution, the Constitution has been violated, no matter what the absolute or
relative size of the award. The record in this case, when viewed as a
whole, demonstrates that it was rational for the jury to place great
weight on the evidence of TXO's deliberate and wrongful conduct, and
makes it probable that the verdict was motivated by a legitimate concern for punishment and deterrence. Pp. 466-469.

Justice Scalia, joined by Justice Thomas, concluded that, although
"procedural due process" requires judicial review of punitive damages
awards for reasonableness, there is no federal constitutional right to
a substantively correct "reasonableness" determination. If the Due
Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment were the secret repository for such an unenumerated right, it would surely also contain the
substantive right not to be subjected to excessive fines, which would
render the Eighth Amendment's Excessive Fines Clause superfluous.
The Constitution gives federal courts no business in this area, except to
assure that due process (i. e., traditional procedure) has been observed.

Opinion of Stevens, J.

I
On August 23, 1985, TXO Production Corp. (TXO) commenced this litigation by filing a complaint in the Circuit
Court of McDowell County, West Virginia, for a declaratory
judgment removing a cloud on title to an interest in oil and
gas development rights. Respondents, including Alliance
Resources Corp. (Alliance), filed a counterclaim for slander
of title that went to trial before a jury in June 1990. The
jury verdict in respondents' favor, which has been affirmed
by the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia, makes it
appropriate to accept respondents' version of disputed issues
of fact.

In 1984, geologists employed by TXO concluded that the
recovery of oil and gas under the surface of a 1,002.74-
acre tract of land known as the "Blevins Tract" would be
extremely profitable. They strongly recommended that
TXO--a large company that was engaged in oil and gas
production in 25 States--obtain the rights to develop the
oil and gas resources on the Blevins Tract.

Those rights were then controlled by Alliance.1 Prodded
by its geologists, TXO approached Alliance with what Alliance considered to be a " `phenomenal offer.' " 187 W. Va.
457, 462, 419 S. E. 2d 870, 875 (1992). TXO would pay Alliance $20 per acre in cash, pay 22 percent of the oil and gas
revenues in royalties, and pay all of the development costs.
On April 2, 1985, Alliance accepted TXO's offer, agreeing to
assign its interest in the Tract to TXO. With respect to
title to the property, Alliance agreed to return the consider1 Alliance was the assignee of a leasehold interest that respondents
George King and Grover C. Goode, doing business as Georgia Fuels, had
obtained from respondent Tug Fork Land Company. Georgia Fuels reserved an overriding royalty interest in the lease.

ation paid to it if TXO's attorney determined that "title
had failed." 2

Shortly after the agreement was signed, TXO's attorneys
discovered a 1958 deed conveying certain mineral rights in
the Tract from respondent Tug Fork Land Company, a predecessor in interest of Alliance, to a coal operator named Leo
J. Signaigo, Jr., who had later conveyed those rights to the
Hawley Coal Mines Company, which had, in turn, reconveyed
them to the Virginia Crews Coal Company (Virginia Crews).
Interviews with Signaigo, and with representatives of Hawley and Virginia Crews, established that the parties all understood that only the right to mine coal had been involved
in those transactions; none of them claimed any interest in
oil or gas development rights. Moreover, the text of the
1958 deed made it "perfectly clear" that the grantor had reserved "all the oil and gas underlying" the Blevins Tract.3

TXO first advised Alliance of the "distinct possibility or
probability" that its "leasehold title fails" in July 1985.4 In
the meantime, despite its knowledge that any claim that the
1958 deed created a cloud on title to the oil and gas develop2 The agreement provided, in pertinent part:
"Assignor [Alliance] hereby warrants title to the extent that in the event
of conducting title examination of the assigned acreage, Assignee's examining attorney determines that title has failed to all or any part of the
assigned acreage, Assignor will reimburse to Assignee the consideration
paid to it for any such lands to which title is determined to have failed."
See 187 W. Va., at 463, n. 1, 419 S. E. 2d, at 876, n. 1.

3 The West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals "unequivocally [found]

that the deed was unambiguous," id., at 464, 419 S. E. 2d, at 877, stating
that "[a]lthough the deed does not demonstrate the most artful drafting,
it does clearly reserve all of the oil and gas under the Blevins Tract to
Tug Fork Land Company," id., at 463-464, 419 S. E. 2d, at 876-877 (emphasis in original). The entire deed is reprinted as Appendix A to the
opinion of the State Supreme Court of Appeals. See id., at 467-471, 419

ment rights would have been "frivolous," 5 TXO made two
attempts to lend substance to such a claim. First, after unsuccessfully trying to convince Virginia Crews that it had an
interest in the oil and gas, TXO paid the company $6,000 for
a quitclaim deed conveying whatever interest it might have
to TXO. TXO recorded the deed without advising Alliance.6
Second, TXO unsuccessfully attempted to induce Mr. Signaigo to execute a false affidavit indicating that the 1958
deed might have included oil and gas rights.

On July 12, after having recorded the quitclaim deed, TXO
wrote to Alliance asserting that there was a title objection
and implying that TXO might well have acquired the oil and
gas rights from Virginia Crews. It then arranged a meeting
in August and attempted to renegotiate the royalty arrangement. When the negotiations were unsuccessful, TXO commenced this litigation. According to the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals, TXO "knowingly and intentionally
brought a frivolous declaratory judgment action" when its
"real intent" was "to reduce the royalty payments under a
1,002.74 acre oil and gas lease," and thereby "increas[e] its
interest in the oil and gas rights." 7

TXO's declaratory judgment action was decided on the
basis of the parties' written submissions. The court granted

5 In the words of the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals: "In this
case, TXO Production Corporation, a subsidiary of USX, knowingly and
intentionally brought a frivolous declaratory judgment action against the
appellees to clear a purported cloud on title." 187 W. Va., at 462, 419
S. E. 2d, at 875.

6 According to an internal TXO memorandum, TXO viewed the quitclaim

respondents' motion to prohibit TXO from introducing ex-pert and extrinsic evidence concerning the meaning of the

1958 deed to Signaigo because the deed itself was unambigu-ous. On the basis of the written record, the court found that
TXO had asserted a claim to title to the oil and gas underthe Blevins Tract by virtue of the quitclaim deed from
Virginia Crews, App. 15, but that the deed was a "nullity." 8The counterclaim for slander of title was subsequently
tried to a jury. In addition to the evidence that TXO knewthat Alliance had good title to the oil and gas and that TXO
had acted in bad faith when it advanced a claim on the basisof the worthless quitclaim deed in an effort to renegotiate
its royalty arrangement, Alliance introduced evidence show-ing that TXO was a large company in its own right and a
wholly owned subsidiary of an even larger company; 9 thatthe anticipated gross revenues from oil and gas development--and therefore the amount of royalties that TXOsought to renegotiate--were substantial;

10 and that TXO had

8 "The Court further finds, as a matter of law, that TXO Production
Corp. obtained no interest or title to the oil and gas underlying the
1,002.74 acres in question from Virginia Crews Coal Company by reason
of the quit claim deed in question. The quit claim deed of Virginia Crews
Coal Company conveyed no title to TXO Production Corp. because Virginia Crews Coal Company obtained no title to the oil and gas from Hawley Coal Mining Corporation and said quit claim deed is, therefore, a nullity." App. 18.

9 Because TXO had refused to disclose any financial records in response

to Alliance's discovery requests, Alliance employed an expert witness who
analyzed public financial statements of TXO's parent, USX Corporation;
he estimated that the TXO division of USX had a net worth of between
"$2.2 billion and $2.5 billion." 187 W. Va., at 477, 419 S. E. 2d, at 890.
Although TXO objected to the evidence as including assets of affiliates, it
did not offer any rebuttal testimony on that issue. Ibid.

engaged in similar nefarious activities in its business deal-ings in other parts of the country. 187 W. Va., at 468-470,

419 S. E. 2d, at 881-883.The jury's verdict of $19,000 in actual damages was based
on Alliance's cost of defending the declaratory judgment ac-tion. It is fair to infer that the punitive damages award of
$10 million was based on other evidence.In support of motions for judgment notwithstanding the
verdict and for remittitur, TXO argued that the punitivedamages award violated the Due Process Clause. Counsel
contended that under the "general punitive damage instruc-tion given in this case, the jury was left to their own devices
without any yardstick as to what was a reasonable punitivedamage award. And for that reason, a vagueness, lack of
guideline and the lack of any requirement of a reasonablerelationship between the actual injury and the punitive damage award, in essence, would cause the Court or should causethe Court to set it aside on Constitutional grounds."

11 In

response, counsel for Alliance argued that the constitutionalobjection had been waived, that the misconduct was particularly egregious,12 and that the award was not excessive.
Mcf. Trial testimony demonstrated that TXO was optimistic that the
Blevins Tract would be quite profitable. See Tr. 672-673 (testimony of
TXO official that the Blevins Tract was a good prospect, that it presented
a "reasonably good opportunity," and that it offered the potential for the
development of numerous wells).

Putting these figures together, respondents contend that TXO anticipated revenues of as high as $1.5 million for each well developed on the
Tract. Brief for Respondents 3. Further extrapolating, respondents
contend that "the value of the total income stream that TXO would expect
from the Blevins Tract was somewhere between $22.5 million (with 15
wells) and $37.5 million (with 25 wells)." Id., at 4.

that he knew all along that this property belonged to Tug Fork?" Id.,

452 TXO PRODUCTION CORP. v. ALLIANCE

RESOURCES CORP.

Opinion of Stevens, J.

The trial court denied the motions without opinion andTXO appealed.

13

On appeal, TXO assigned three primary errors: (1) that nocause of action for slander of title existed in West Virginia

or had been established by the evidence; (2) that the West
Virginia Rules of Evidence were violated by the admission
of testimony of lawyers involved in litigation against TXO in
other States to show TXO's wrongful intent; and (3) that the
award of punitive damages violated the Due Process Clause
as interpreted in our opinion in Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. v.
Haslip, 499 U. S. 1 (1991), and in the West Virginia Supreme
Court of Appeals' recent decision in Garnes v. Fleming
Landfill, Inc., 186 W. Va. 656, 413 S. E. 2d 897 (1991). The
State Supreme Court of Appeals affirmed.

The court first disposed of the state-law issues.14 It introduced its discussion of the federal issue by describing the
kinds of defendants against whom punitive damages had
been awarded after our decision in Haslip.15 Turning to the

13 Id., at 71a-72a.
14 "Slander of title," the court noted, "long has been recognized as a

common law cause of action." 187 W. Va., at 465, 419 S. E. 2d, at 878.
The court found that respondents had demonstrated all the elements of the
tort: that TXO, by recording the frivolous quitclaim deed, had published a
false statement derogatory to respondents' title, had done so with "malice," and had caused special damages, here the attorney's fees, as a result
of its attack on respondents' interest in the oil and gas development rights.
See id., at 466-468, 419 S. E. 2d, at 879-881.

15 "We have examined all of the punitive damages opinions issued since

Haslip was decided in an attempt to find some pattern in what courts find
reasonable. Generally, the cases fall into three categories: (1) really stupid defendants; (2) really mean defendants; and, (3) really stupid defendants who could have caused a great deal of harm by their actions but who
actually caused minimal harm." Id., at 474-475, 419 S. E. 2d, at 887-888.
In a concurring opinion two justices criticized that categorization and
stated that West Virginia's traditional rule summarizing the type of conduct that would give rise to punitive damages was better stated in the
following syllabus:

" `In actions of tort, where gross fraud, malice, oppression, or wanton, willful, or reckless conduct or criminal indifference to civil obligations affect509us2111J 05-09-97 16:19:04 PAGES OPINPGT

facts of this case, the court stated that the application of its
"reasonable relationship" test required it to consider these
three factors:

"(1) the potential harm that TXO's actions could have
caused; (2) the maliciousness of TXO's actions; and (3)
the penalty necessary to discourage TXO from undertaking such endeavors in the future." 187 W. Va., at
476, 419 S. E. 2d, at 889.

It held that each of those factors supported the award in this
case, stating:

"The type of fraudulent action intentionally undertaken by TXO in this case could potentially cause millions of dollars in damages to other victims. As for the
reprehensibility of TXO's conduct, we can say no more
than we have already said, and we believe the jury's
verdict says more than we could say in an opinion twice
this length. Just as important, an award of this magnitude is necessary to discourage TXO from continuing

its pattern and practice of fraud, trickery and deceit."
Ibid. (emphasis in original).

We granted certiorari, 506 U. S. 997 (1992), and now affirm.

II
TXO first argues that a $10 million punitive damages
award--an award 526 times greater than the actual damages
awarded by the jury--is so excessive that it must be deemed
an arbitrary deprivation of property without due process of
law.

TXO correctly points out that several of our opinions have
stated that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth

ing the rights of others appear, or where legislative enactment authorizes,
it, the jury may assess exemplary, punitive, or vindictive damages. . . .' "

Amendment imposes substantive limits "beyond which pen-alties may not go." Seaboard Air Line R. Co. v. Seegers, 207

U. S. 73, 78 (1907). See also St. Louis, I. M. & S. R. Co. v.Williams, 251 U. S. 63, 66-67 (1919); Standard Oil Co. of
Ind. v. Missouri, 224 U. S. 270, 286 (1912).16 Moreover, inSouthwestern Telegraph & Telephone Co. v. Danaher, 238
U. S. 482 (1915), the Court actually set aside a penalty im-posed on a telephone company on the ground that it was so
"plainly arbitrary and oppressive" as to violate the Due Proc-ess Clause.

Id., at 491.17 In an earlier case the Court hadstated that it would not review state action fixing the penalties for unlawful conduct unless "the fines imposed are sogrossly excessive as to amount to a deprivation of property
without due process of law." Waters-Pierce Oil Co. v. Texas(No. 1), 212 U. S. 86, 111 (1909).

16 In each of those cases, the Court actually found no constitutional violation. Thus, in the Seaboard Air Line R. Co. case, the Court concluded:
"We know there are limits beyond which penalties may not go--even in
cases where classification is legitimate--but we are not prepared to hold
that the amount of penalty imposed is so great or the length of time within
which the adjustment and payment are to be made is so short that the act
imposing the penalty and fixing the time is beyond the power of the
State." 207 U. S., at 78-79.

17 In doing so, however, the Court emphasized the fact that the company

was punished for conduct that had been undertaken in complete good faith.
It noted:

"There was no intentional wrongdoing; no departure from any prescribed
or known standard of action, and no reckless conduct. Some regulation
establishing a mode of inducing prompt payment of the monthly rentals
was necessary. It is not as if the company had been free to act or not as
it chose. It was engaged in a public service which could not be neglected.
The protection of its own revenues and justice to its paying patrons required that something be done. It acted by adopting the regulation and
then impartially enforcing it. There was no mode of judicially testing the
regulation's reasonableness in advance of acting under it, and, as we have
seen, it had the support of repeated adjudications in other jurisdictions.
In these circumstances to inflict upon the company penalties aggregating
$6,300 was so plainly arbitrary and oppressive as to be nothing short of a
taking of its property without due process of law." 238 U. S., at 490-491.

While respondents "unabashedly" denigrate those cases as"Lochner-era precedents,"

18 they overlook the fact that the

Justices who had dissented in the Lochner case itself joinedthose opinions.

19 More importantly, respondents do not dispute the proposition that the Fourteenth Amendment im-poses a substantive limit on the amount of a punitive damages award. Brief for Respondents 17. They contend,however, that the standard of review should be the same
standard of rational-basis scrutiny that is appropriate forreviewing state economic legislation.

TXO, on the other hand, argues that punitive damagesawards should be scrutinized more strictly than legislative
penalties because they are typically assessed without anylegislative guidance expressing the considered judgment of
the elected representatives of the community.20 TXO urgesthat we apply a form of heightened scrutiny, the first step of
which is to apply certain "objective" criteria to determinewhether a punitive award presumptively violates those notions of "fundamental fairness" inherent in the concept ofdue process of law. Relying heavily on the plurality opinion
in Schad v. Arizona, 501 U. S. 624 (1991), petitioner arguesthat " `history and widely shared practice [are] concrete indicators of what fundamental fairness and rationality re-quire,' " Brief for Petitioner 15-16 (quoting Schad, 501 U. S.,

damages upheld against other defendants in the same juris-diction, (2) awards upheld for similar conduct in other jurisdictions, (3) legislative penalty decisions with respect to sim-ilar conduct, and (4) the relationship of prior punitive awards
to the associated compensatory awards, Brief for Petitioner16.

21 Under petitioner's proposed framework, when this

inquiry demonstrates that an award "exceeds the boundsof contemporary and historical practice by

orders of magni-tude," id., at 21 (emphasis in original), that award must be

struck down as arbitrary and excessive unless there is a"compelling and particularized justification" for an award of
such size.22The parties' desire to formulate a "test" for determining
whether a particular punitive award is "grossly excessive" isunderstandable. Nonetheless, we find neither formulation
satisfactory. Under respondents' rational-basis standard,apparently

any award that would serve the legitimate stateinterest in deterring or punishing wrongful conduct, no matter how large, would be acceptable. On the other hand, wereject the premise underlying TXO's invocation of heightened scrutiny. The review of a jury's award for arbitrari-ness and the review of legislation surely are significantly different. Still, it is not correct to assume that the safeguardsin the legislative process have no counterpart in the judicial
process. The members of the jury were determined to beimpartial before they were allowed to sit, their assessment
of damages was the product of collective deliberation based

21 As counsel for petitioner noted at oral argument, these objective criteria in part track the analysis of Justice Powell's opinion for the Court in
Solem v. Helm, 463 U. S. 277, 290-292 (1983). See Tr. of Oral Arg. 26.

22 Applying this "test," TXO concludes (not surprisingly) that the award

in this case exceeds prior awards given both within the State of West
Virginia and in other jurisdictions in allegedly comparable circumstances,
and cannot be defended as rationally related to a state interest in either
retribution or deterrence. The punitive award in this case, petitioner contends, is thus supported only by West Virginia's patently illegitimate interest in redistributing wealth away from a large, out-of-state corporation.

Opinion of Stevens, J.
on evidence and the arguments of adversaries, their awardwas reviewed and upheld by the trial judge who also heard

the testimony, and it was affirmed by a unanimous decisionof the State Supreme Court of Appeals. Assuming that fair
procedures were followed, a judgment that is a product of
that process is entitled to a strong presumption of validity.Indeed, there are persuasive reasons for suggesting that the

presumption should be irrebuttable, see Haslip, 499 U. S., at24-40 (

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment), or virtually so,
id., at 40-42 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment).Nor are we persuaded that reliance on petitioner's "objective" criteria is the proper course to follow. We have, of
course, relied on history and "widely shared practice" as a
guide to determining whether a particular state practice so
departs from an accepted norm as to be presumptively violative of due process, see Schad, 501 U. S., at 637-643 (plurality
opinion), and whether a term of imprisonment under certain
circumstances is cruel and unusual punishment, see Solem v.
Helm, 463 U. S. 277, 290-292 (1983). We question, however,
the utility of such a comparative approach as a test for assessing whether a particular punitive award is presumptively unconstitutional.

It is a relatively straightforward task to draw intrajurisdictional and interjurisdictional comparisons on such matters
as the definition of first-degree murder (Schad) or the penalty imposed on nonviolent repeat offenders (Solem). The
same cannot be said of the task of drawing such comparisons
with regard to punitive damages awards by juries. Such
awards are the product of numerous, and sometimes intangible, factors; a jury imposing a punitive damages award must
make a qualitative assessment based on a host of facts and
circumstances unique to the particular case before it. Because no two cases are truly identical, meaningful comparisons of such awards are difficult to make. Cf. Haslip, supra,
at 41-42 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment). Such analysis might be useful in considering whether a state practice

509us2111J 05-09-97 16:19:05 PAGES OPINPGT
458 TXO PRODUCTION CORP. v. ALLIANCE

RESOURCES CORP.

Opinion of Stevens, J.

of permitting juries to rely on a particular factor, such as thedefendant's out-of-state status, would violate due process.

23

As an analytical approach to assessing a particular award,however, we are skeptical. Thus, while we do not rule out

the possibility that the fact that an award is significantly
larger than those in apparently similar circumstances might,in a given case, be one of many relevant considerations, we

are not prepared to enshrine petitioner's comparative ap-proach in a "test" for assessing the constitutionality of punitive damages awards.In the end, then, in determining whether a particular
award is so "grossly excessive" as to violate the Due ProcessClause of the Fourteenth Amendment,

Waters-Pierce Oil
Co., 212 U. S., at 111, we return to what we said two Terms
ago in Haslip: "We need not, and indeed we cannot, draw amathematical bright line between the constitutionally acceptable and the constitutionally unacceptable that would fitevery case. We can say, however, that [a] general concer[n]
of reasonableness . . . properly enter[s] into the constitutionalcalculus." 499 U. S., at 18. And, to echo

Haslip once again,
it is with this concern for reasonableness in mind that weturn to petitioner's argument that the punitive award in this

case was so "grossly excessive" as to violate the substantive
component of the Due Process Clause.24

23 Of course, such a state policy would likely be subject to challenge on
other grounds as well.

24 Justice Scalia's assertion notwithstanding, see post, at 471, we do

not suggest that a defendant has a substantive due process right to a
correct determination of the "reasonableness" of a punitive damages
award. As Justice O'Connor points out, state law generally imposes a
requirement that punitive damages be "reasonable." See post, at 475-
479. A violation of a state law "reasonableness" requirement would not,
however, necessarily establish that the award is so "grossly excessive" as
to violate the Federal Constitution. Furthermore, the fact that our cases
have recognized for almost a century that the Due Process Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment imposes an outer limit on such an award does not,

In support of its submission that this award is "grosslyexcessive," TXO places its primary emphasis on the fact that

it is over 526 times as large as the actual damages award.TXO correctly notes that state courts have long held that
"exemplary damages allowed should bear some proportionto the real damage sustained."

25 Moreover, in our recent

decision in Haslip, supra, in which we upheld a punitivedamages award of four times the amount of compensatory

damages, we noted that that award "may be close to the line"of constitutional permissibility. Id., at 23. Following that
decision, the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals hadalso observed that as "a matter of fundamental fairness, punitive damages should bear a reasonable relationship to com-pensatory damages." Garnes v. Fleming Landfill, Inc., 186
W. Va., at 668, 413 S. E. 2d, at 909.That relationship, however, was only one of several factors
that the state court mentioned in its Garnes opinion. Ear-lier in its opinion it gave this example:

"For instance, a man wildly fires a gun into a crowd.By sheer chance, no one is injured and the only damage
is to a $10 pair of glasses. A jury reasonably could findonly $10 in compensatory damages, but thousands of dollars in punitive damages to teach a duty of care. We
of course, make that Clause "the secret repository of all sorts of other,
unenumerated, substantive rights," post, at 470 (Scalia, J., concurring in
judgment). Indeed, it is ironic that Justice Scalia acknowledges that
the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates substantive guarantees of the Bill of Rights while relying on the enumeration
of one of those rights (the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment) as evidence that such a right has no counterpart in the Due Process
Clause. Post, at 470-471.

would allow a jury to impose substantial punitive damages in order to discourage future bad acts." Id., at
661, 413 S. E. 2d, at 902 (citing C. Morris, Punitive Damages in Tort Cases, 44 Harv. L. Rev. 1173, 1181 (1931)).

When the court identified the several factors that should be
mentioned in instructions to the jury, the first one that it
mentioned reflected that example. It said:

"Punitive damages should bear a reasonable relationship
to the harm that is likely to occur from the defendant's
conduct as well as to the harm that actually has occurred. If the defendant's actions caused or would
likely cause in a similar situation only slight harm, the
damages should be relatively small. If the harm is
grievous, the damages should be much greater." 186
W. Va., at 668, 413 S. E. 2d, at 909 (emphasis added).

Taking account of the potential harm that might result
from the defendant's conduct in calculating punitive damages
was consistent with the views we expressed in Haslip,
supra. In that case we endorsed the standards that the
Alabama Supreme Court had previously announced, one
of which was "whether there is a reasonable relationship
between the punitive damages award and the harm likely to
result from the defendant's conduct as well as the harm that
actually has occurred," id., at 21 (emphasis added).

Thus, both State Supreme Courts and this Court have eschewed an approach that concentrates entirely on the relationship between actual and punitive damages. It is appropriate to consider the magnitude of the potential harm that
the defendant's conduct would have caused to its intended
victim if the wrongful plan had succeeded, as well as the
possible harm to other victims that might have resulted if
similar future behavior were not deterred. In this case
the State Supreme Court of Appeals concluded that TXO's
pattern of behavior "could potentially cause millions of dol509us2111J 05-09-97 16:19:05 PAGES OPINPGT

lars in damages to other victims." 26 Moreover, respondentsargue that the record evidence would support a finding that

Alliance's 22 percent share of the projected revenues fromthe full development of the oil and gas rights amounted to
between $5 million and $8.3 million, depending on how manywells were developed.

27 Even if these figures are exaggerated--as TXO persuasively argues, see Reply Brief for Peti-tioner 9-12--the jury could well have believed that TXO was

seeking a multimillion dollar reduction in its potential roy-alty obligation. In fact, in making their closing arguments
to the jury, counsel for respondents stressed, in addition toTXO's vast wealth, the tremendous financial gains that TXO
hoped to achieve through its "elaborate scheme." Counselfor Alliance argued:

"They wouldn't have gone to this elaborate scheme--No,they wouldn't now, because they thought this was a
huge, gonna be a huge money-making lease. Gonnaputs lots of wells on it. That's why it was worth the
scheme. And the punishment should fit it, and fit thewealth." App. to Brief for Petitioner 23a.

Echoing the same theme, counsel for respondent Tug ForkLand Company argued:

"You have to go on what TXO thought when theywere going into this well. They thought it was going
to be a better well than it was. But, see, it got caughtup in this litigation and now, I submit to you, they are
saying that it is not as good a well as it was. And that'sa fact that is in some contention here. But regardless
of how good it was, when they went in and did theiroperation back in May, June, July and August of 1985,
they had projected that this would be a 20 year well andwould produce a lot of money." Tr. 748-749.

Opinion of Stevens, J.

While petitioner stresses the shocking disparity betweenthe punitive award and the compensatory award, that shock

dissipates when one considers the potential loss to respond-ents, in terms of reduced or eliminated royalties payments,
had petitioner succeeded in its illicit scheme. Thus, even ifthe actual value of the "potential harm" to respondents is
not between $5 million and $8.3 million, but is closer to $4million, or $2 million, or even $1 million, the disparity between the punitive award and the potential harm does not,in our view, "jar one's constitutional sensibilities."

Haslip,499 U. S., at 18.

In sum, we do not consider the dramatic disparity betweenthe actual damages and the punitive award controlling in a
case of this character. On this record, the jury may reason-ably have determined that petitioner set out on a malicious
and fraudulent course to win back, either in whole or in part,the lucrative stream of royalties that it had ceded to Alliance.
The punitive damages award in this case is certainly large,but in light of the amount of money potentially at stake, the

28 TXO also contends that the admission of evidence of its alleged
wrongdoing in other parts of the country, as well as the evidence of its
impressive net worth, led the jury to base its award on impermissible
passion and prejudice. Brief for Petitioner 22-23. Under well-settled
law, however, factors such as these are typically considered in assessing
punitive damages. Indeed, the Alabama factors we approved in Haslip
included both. See Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Haslip, 499 U. S. 1, 21-22
(1991) ("(b) . . . the existence and frequency of similar past conduct; . . .
(d) the `financial position' of the defendant").

was not adequately instructed, because its award was notadequately reviewed by the trial or the appellate court, and

because TXO had no advance notice that the jury might beallowed to return such a large award or to rely on potential
harm as a basis for its calculation. We decline to addressthe first argument as it was not argued or passed on below.
We find the remaining arguments meritless.The instruction to the jury on punitive damages differed
from that found adequate in Haslip, see 499 U. S., at 6, n. 1,in two significant respects. It authorized the jury to take
account of "the wealth of the perpetrator" in recognition ofthe fact that effective deterrence of wrongful conduct "may
require a larger fine upon one of large means than it wouldupon one of ordinary means under the same or similar circumstances." 29 It also stated that one of the purposes ofpunitive damages is "to provide additional compensation for

29 The instruction on punitive damages, to which TXO objected, read
as follows:

"In addition to actual or compensatory damages, the law permits the
jury, under certain circumstances, to make an award of punitive damages,
in order to punish the wrongdoer for his misconduct, to serve as an example or warning to others not to engage in such conduct and to provide
additional compensation for the conduct to which the injured parties have
been subjected.

"If you find from a preponderance of the evidence that TXO Production
Corp. is guilty of wanton, wilful, malicious or reckless conduct which
shows an indifference to the right of others, then you may make an award
of punitive damages in this case.

"In assessing punitive damages, if any, you should take into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the particular occurrence, including the nature of the wrongdoing, the extent of the harm inflicted, the
intent of the party committing the act, the wealth of the perpetrator, as
well as any mitigating circumstances which may operate to reduce the
amount of the damages. The object of such punishment is to deter TXO
Production Corp. and others from committing like offenses in the future.
Therefore the law recognizes that to in fact deter such conduct may require a larger fine upon one of large means than it would upon one of
ordinary means under the same or similar circumstances." App. 34-35.

TXO did not propose a different instruction.

the conduct to which the injured parties have been sub-jected." See n. 29, supra.

We agree with TXO that the emphasis on the wealth ofthe wrongdoer increased the risk that the award may have
been influenced by prejudice against large corporations, arisk that is of special concern when the defendant is a nonresident. We also do not understand the reference in the in-struction to "additional compensation." We note, however,
that in Haslip we referred to the "financial position" of thedefendant as one factor that could be taken into account in
assessing punitive damages, see n. 28, supra. We also notethat TXO did not squarely argue in the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals that these aspects of the jury in-struction violated the Due Process Clause, see Brief for
Appellant in No. 20281 (W. Va. Sup. Ct.), pp. 44-48,30 pos-sibly because many States permit the jury to take account
of the defendant's wealth.31 Because TXO's constitutionalattack on the jury instructions was not properly presented
to the highest court of the State, Bankers Life & CasualtyCo. v. Crenshaw, 486 U. S. 71, 77-80 (1988), we do not pass
on it.The only basis for criticizing the trial judge's review of the
punitive damages award is that he did not articulate his rea-sons for upholding it. He did, however, give counsel an adequate hearing on TXO's postverdict motions, and during onecolloquy indicated his agreement with the jury's appraisal of

30 In fact, in its brief before that court, petitioner stated that "[i]t is
clear under West Virginia law that the financial standing of the defendant
is an element to be taken into consideration in determining the proper
measure of punitive or exemplary damages." Brief for Appellant in No.
20281 (W. Va. Sup. Ct.), p. 37 (emphasis in original). There is no hint in
that brief that petitioner thought that this state rule violated due process.

the egregious character of the conduct of TXO's executives.See n. 12, supra. While it is always helpful for trial judges

to explain the basis for their rulings as thoroughly as is con-sistent with the efficient dispatch of their duties, we certainly are not prepared to characterize the trial judge's fail-ure to articulate the basis for his denial of the motions for
judgment notwithstanding the verdict and for remittitur asa constitutional violation.

Petitioner's criticism of the West Virginia Supreme Courtof Appeals' opinion is based largely on the court's colorful
reference to classes of "really mean" and "really stupid" de-fendants. That those terms played little, if any, part in its
actual evaluation of the propriety of the damages award isevident from the reasoning in its thorough opinion, succinctly
summarized in passages we have already quoted. More-over, two members of the court who wrote separately to
disassociate themselves from the "really mean" and "reallystupid" terminology shared the views of the rest of the members of the court on the merits. See 187 W. Va., at 484, 419S. E., at 895 (McHugh, C. J., concurring). The opinion was
unanimous and gave careful attention to the relevant prece-dents, including our decision in

Haslip and their own priordecision in Garnes.

Finally, we find no merit in TXO's argument that the pro-cedure followed in this case "was unconstitutionally vague"
because petitioner had no notice of the possibility that theaward of punitive damages might be divorced from an award
of compensatory damages. In Wells v. Smith, 171 W. Va. 97,105, 297 S. E. 2d 872, 880 (1982), the West Virginia Supreme
Court of Appeals held that a defendant could be liable forpunitive damages even if the jury did not award the plaintiff
any compensatory damages.32 In any event, the notice com32 In Garnes v. Fleming Landfill, Inc., 186 W. Va. 656, 413 S. E. 2d 897

ponent of the Due Process Clause is satisfied if prior lawfairly indicated that a punitive damages award might be imposed in response to egregiously tortious conduct. Haslip,499 U. S., at 24, n. 12. Prior law, in West Virginia and elsewhere, unquestionably did so.The judgment of the West Virginia Supreme Court of
Appeals is affirmed.

It is so ordered.

Justice Kennedy, concurring in part and concurring inthe judgment.

I concur in the plurality's statement of the case and in PartIV of the plurality opinion, in which the plurality holds that
the judicial procedures that were followed in awarding puni-tive damages against TXO fulfilled the constitutional requirement of due process of law. I am not in full agreement,however, with the plurality's discussion of the substantive
requirements of the Due Process Clause in Parts II and III,in which it concentrates on whether the punitive damages
award was " `grossly excessive.' " Ante, at 458, 462. Iagree that the approaches proposed by the parties to this
case are unsatisfactory, see ante, at 456-458, but I do notbelieve that the plurality's replacement, a general focus on
the " `reasonableness' " of the award, ante, at 458, quotingPacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Haslip, 499 U. S. 1, 18 (1991), is
a significant improvement. To ask whether a particularaward of punitive damages is grossly excessive begs the
question: excessive in relation to what? The answer ex-cessive in relation to the conduct of the tortfeasor may be
correct, but it is unhelpful, for we are still bereft ofany standard by which to compare the punishment to the
malefaction that gave rise to it. A reviewing court employ-ing this formulation comes close to relying upon nothing
more than its own subjective reaction to a particular punitive
satory damages before it can award punitive damages. See 186 W. Va.,
at 667, 413 S. E. 2d, at 908.

damages award in deciding whether the award violates theConstitution. This type of review, far from imposing

meaningful, law-like restraints on jury excess, could becomeas fickle as the process it is designed to superintend. Furthermore, it might give the illusion of judicial certainty
where none in fact exists, and, in so doing, discourage leg-islative intervention that might prevent unjust punitive

awards.As I have suggested before, see

id., at 41 (opinion concurring in judgment), a more manageable constitutional inquiryfocuses not on the amount of money a jury awards in a particular case but on its reasons for doing so. The Constitution identifies no particular multiple of compensatory damages as an acceptable limit for punitive awards; it does not
concern itself with dollar amounts, ratios, or the quirks of
juries in specific jurisdictions. Rather, its fundamental
guarantee is that the individual citizen may rest secure
against arbitrary or irrational deprivations of property.
When a punitive damages award reflects bias, passion, or
prejudice on the part of the jury, rather than a rational concern for deterrence and retribution, the Constitution has
been violated, no matter what the absolute or relative size
of the award. Justice O'Connor is correct in observing
that in implementing this principle, courts have often looked
to the size of the award as one indication that it resulted
from bias, passion, or prejudice, see post, at 476-478, but that
is not the sole, or even necessarily the most important, sign.
Other objective indicia of the type discussed by the plurality,
see ante, at 455-457, as well as direct evidence from the trial
record, are also helpful in ascertaining whether a jury
stripped a party of its property in an arbitrary way and not
in accordance with the standards of rationality and fairness
the Constitution requires.

The plurality suggests that the jury in this case acted in
conformance with these standards of rationality in large part
on the basis of what it perceives to be the rational relation

between the size of the award and the degree of harm threatened by TXO's conduct. See ante, at 460-462. I do not
agree that this provides a constitutionally adequate foundation for concluding that the punitive damages verdict against
TXO was rational. It is a commonplace that a jury verdict
must be reviewed in relation to the record before it. See,
e. g., Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307 (1979). Unlike a legislature, whose judgments may be predicated on educated
guesses and need not necessarily be grounded in facts adduced in a hearing, see, e. g., Heller v. Doe, ante, at 320; FCC
v. Beach Communications, Inc., 508 U. S. 307, 315 (1993);
Vance v. Bradley, 440 U. S. 93, 111 (1979), a jury is bound to
consider only the evidence presented to it in arriving at a
judgment. Justice O'Connor demonstrates that the record in this case does not contain evidence, argument, or instructions regarding the potential harm from TXO's conduct
and so would not have permitted a reasonable jury to render
its verdict on this basis. See post, at 484-489. We must
therefore look for other explanations of the jury verdict to
decide whether it may stand.

On its facts, this case is close and difficult; Justice
O'Connor makes a plausible argument, based on the record and the trial court's instructions, that the size of the
punitive award is explained by the jury's raw, redistributionist impulses stemming from antipathy to a wealthy, outof-state, corporate defendant. See post, at 492-494. There
is, however, another explanation for the jury verdict, one
supported by the record and relied upon by the state
courts, that persuades me that I cannot say with sufficient
confidence that the award was unjustified or improper on
this record: TXO acted with malice. This was not a case of
negligence, strict liability, or respondeat superior. TXO
was found to have committed, through its senior officers, the
intentional tort of slander of title. The evidence at trial
demonstrated that it acted, in the West Virginia Supreme

Court of Appeals' words, through a "pattern and practice
of fraud, trickery and deceit" and employed "unsavory and
malicious practices" in the course of its business dealings
with respondent. 187 W. Va. 457, 477, 467, 419 S. E. 2d 870,
890, 880 (1992). "[T]he record shows that this was not an
isolated incident on TXO's part--a mere excess of zeal by
poorly supervised, low level employees--but rather part of a
pattern and practice by TXO to defraud and coerce those in
positions of unequal bargaining power." Id., at 468, 419
S. E. 2d, at 881.

Although in many respects this case represents an odd
application of an already unusual tort, it was rational for the
jury to place great weight on the evidence of TXO's deliberate, wrongful conduct in determining that a substantial
award was required in order to serve the goals of punishment and deterrence. I confess to feeling a certain
degree of disquiet in affirming this award, but the record,
when viewed as a whole, makes it probable that the jury's
verdict was motivated by a legitimate concern for punishing
and deterring TXO, rather than by bias, passion, or prejudice. There was ample evidence of willful and malicious
conduct by TXO in this case; the jury heard evidence concerning several prior lawsuits filed against TXO accusing it
of similar misdeeds; and respondents' attorneys informed the
jury of TXO's vast financial resources and argued that TXO
would suffer only as a result of a large judgment. Compared with this evidence and argumentation, which dominates the record of the trial, the subtler and more isolated
appeals based on TXO's out-of-state status on which Justice
O'Connor focuses were of lesser importance. A case involving vicarious liability, negligence, or strict liability might
present different issues. But given the record here, I am
satisfied that the jury's punitive damages award did not
amount to an unfair, arbitrary, or irrational seizure of
TXO's property.

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment

Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas joins,concurring in the judgment.

The jury in this case was instructed on the purposes ofpunitive damages under West Virginia law, and its award
was reviewed for reasonableness by the trial court and theWest Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals. Traditional
American practice governing the imposition of punitive dam-ages requires no more. See

Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. v.Haslip, 499 U. S. 1, 15 (1991); id., at 26-27 (

Scalia, J., concur-ring in judgment). It follows, in my view, that petitioner's

claims under the Due Process Clause of the FourteenthAmendment must fail. See

id., at 31. I therefore have nodifficulty joining the Court's judgment.

I do not, however, join the plurality opinion, since it makesexplicit what was implicit in

Haslip: the existence of a so-called "substantive due process" right that punitive damages

be reasonable, see ante, at 458.* I am willing to accept theproposition that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment, despite its textual limitation to procedure, in-corporates certain substantive guarantees specified in the
Bill of Rights; but I do not accept the proposition that itis the secret repository of all sorts of other, unenumerated,
substantive rights--however fashionable that propositionmay have been (even as to economic rights of the sort involved here) at the time of the Lochner-era cases the plural*Justice Stevens asserts that there is a difference between the constitutional standard that he today proposes, which he describes as "grossly
excessive" (a term used in one of the Lochner-era cases he relies upon,
Waters-Pierce Oil Co. v. Texas (No. 1), 212 U. S. 86, 111 (1909)), and
the standard of "reasonableness" that state courts have traditionally
applied. Ante, at 458-459, n. 24. I doubt whether there is a difference
between the two. As Justice O'Connor points out, see post, at 476-478,
state courts often used terms like "grossly excessive" to describe the sort
of award that could not stand. But if there is a difference, then one
must wonder--since it is not based upon any common-law tradition--
where the standard of "grossly-excessive-that-means-something-evenworse-than-unreasonable" comes from.

471Cite as: 509 U. S. 443 (1993)
Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
ity relies upon, see ante, at 453-454. It is particularly diffi-cult to imagine that "due process" contains the substantive

right not to be subjected to excessive punitive damages,since if it contains

that it would surely also contain the substantive right not to be subjected to excessive fines, which
would make the Excessive Fines Clause of the EighthAmendment superfluous in light of the Due Process Clause

of the Fifth Amendment.To say (as I do) that "procedural due process" requires
judicial review of punitive damages awards for reasonable-ness is not to say that there is a federal constitutional right
to a substantively correct "reasonableness" determination--
which is, in my view, what the plurality tries to assure today.
Procedural due process also requires, I am certain, judicial
review of the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a civil
jury verdict, and judicial review of the reasonableness of
jury-awarded compensatory damages (including damages for
pain and suffering); but no one would claim (or at least no
one has yet claimed) that a substantively correct determination of sufficiency of evidence and reasonableness of compensatory damages is a federal constitutional right. So too, I
think, with punitive damages: Judicial assessment of their
reasonableness is a federal right, but a correct assessment of
their reasonableness is not.

Today's reprise of Haslip, despite the widely divergent
opinions it has produced, has not been a waste. The procedures approved here, ante, at 463-466 (plurality opinion), are
far less detailed and restrictive than those upheld in Haslip,
supra, at 19-23, suggesting that if the Court ever does
invent new procedural requirements, they will not deviate
significantly from the traditional ones that ought to govern.
And the disposition of the "substantive due process" claim
demonstrates that the Court's " `constitutional sensibilities' "
are far more resistant to " `jar[ring],' " ante, at 462 (plurality
opinion) (quoting Haslip, supra, at 18), than one might have
imagined after Haslip. There the Court said a 4-to-1 ratio

between punitive damages and actual damages "may be closeto the line" of "constitutional impropriety,"

Haslip, supra, at
23-24; today we decide that a 10-to-1 ratio between punitivedamages and

the potential harm of petitioner's conduct
passes muster--calculating that potential harm, very generously, to be more than 50 times the $19,000 in actual dam-ages that respondents suffered, see

ante, at 460-462 (plurality opinion).The plurality's decision is valuable, then, in that the great

majority of due process challenges to punitive damagesawards can henceforth be disposed of simply with the observation that "this is no worse than TXO." I would go fur-ther, to shut the door the plurality leaves slightly ajar. As
I said in Haslip, the Constitution gives federal courts no
business in this area, except to assure that due process (i. e.,
traditional procedure) has been observed. 499 U. S., at
27-28 (opinion concurring in judgment). State legislatures
and courts have ample authority to eliminate any perceived
"unfairness" in the common-law punitive damages regime,
and have frequently exercised that authority in recent years.
See id., at 39; Brief for Attorney General of Alabama et al.
as Amici Curiae 14-17 (collecting state statutes and cases);
Brief for National Association of Securities and Commercial
Law Attorneys as Amicus Curiae 16-30 (same). The plurality's continued assertion that federal judges have some,
almost-never-usable, power to impose a standard of "reasonable punitive damages" through the clumsy medium of the
Due Process Clause serves only to spawn wasteful litigation,
and to reduce the incentives for the proper institutions of
our society to undertake that task.

In Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Haslip, 499 U. S. 1 (1991),
this Court held out the promise that punitive damages

awards would receive sufficient constitutional scrutiny to re-store fairness in what is rapidly becoming an arbitrary and

oppressive system. Today the Court's judgment rendersHaslip's promise a false one. The procedures that converted this commercial dispute into a $10 million punitiveverdict were wholly inadequate. Rather than producing a
judgment founded on verifiable criteria, they produced amonstrous award--526 times actual damages and over 20
times greater than any punitive award in West Virginia his-tory. Worse, the State Supreme Court of Appeals rejected
petitioner's challenge with only cursory analysis, observingthat petitioner, rather than being "really stupid," had been
"really mean." 187 W. Va. 457, 474-475, 419 S. E. 2d 870,887-889 (1992). The court similarly refused to consider the
possibility of remittitur because petitioner "and its agentsand servants failed to conduct themselves as gentlemen."
Id., at 462, 419 S. E. 2d, at 875. In my view, due processdoes not tolerate such cavalier standards when so much is at
stake. Because I believe that neither this award's size northe procedures that produced it are consistent with the principles this Court articulated in Haslip, I respectfully dissent.

Our system of justice entrusts jurors--ordinary citizenswho need not have any training in the law--with profoundly

important determinations. Jurors decide not only civil mat-ters, where the financial consequences may be great, but also
criminal cases, where the liberty or perhaps life of the de-fendant hangs in the balance. Our abiding faith in the jury
system is founded on longstanding tradition reflected in con-stitutional text, see U. S. Const., Art. III, $ 2, Amdts. 6, 7,
and is supported by sound considerations of justice and dem-ocratic theory. The jury system long has been a guarantor
of fairness, a bulwark against tyranny, and a source of civicvalues. See 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *379-*381;

W. Olson, The Litigation Explosion 175 (1991); Hyman & Tar-rant, Aspects of American Trial Jury History, in The Jury

System in America 23, 27-28 (R. Simon ed. 1975).But jurors are not infallible guardians of the public good.
They are ordinary citizens whose decisions can be shaped by
influences impermissible in our system of justice. In fact,they are more susceptible to such influences than judges.

See H. Kalven & H. Zeisel, The American Jury 497-498(1966) ("The judge very often perceives the stimulus that
moves the jury, but does not yield to it. . . . The perennialamateur, layman jury cannot be so quickly domesticated to
official role and tradition; it remains accessible to stimuli
which the judge will exclude"). Arbitrariness, caprice, passion, bias, and even malice can replace reasoned judgment
and law as the basis for jury decisionmaking. Modern judicial systems therefore incorporate safeguards against such
influences. Rules of evidence limit what the parties may
present to the jury. Careful instructions direct the jury's
deliberations. Trial judges diligently supervise proceedings, watchful for potential sources of error. And courts of
appeals stand ready to overturn judgments when efforts to
ensure fairness have failed.

In the usual case, this elaborate but necessary judicial machinery functions well, ensuring that our jury system is an
engine of liberty and justice rather than a source of oppression and arbitrary imposition. As Justice Kennedy has
explained, "[e]lements of whim and caprice do not predominate when the jury reaches a consensus based upon arguments of counsel, the presentation of evidence, and instructions from the trial judge, subject to review by the trial and
appellate courts." Haslip, 499 U. S., at 40 (opinion concurring in judgment). But the risk of prejudice, bias, and caprice remains a real one in every case nonetheless.

This is especially true in the area of punitive damages,
where juries sometimes receive only vague and amorphous
guidance. Jurors may be told that punitive damages are im509us2111J 05-09-97 16:19:05 PAGES OPINPGT

posed to punish and deter, but rarely are they instructed onhow to effectuate those goals or whether any limiting principles exist. See, e. g., id., at 39. Although this Court hasnot held such instructions constitutionally inadequate, it cannot be denied that the lack of clear guidance heightens the
risk that arbitrariness, passion, or bias will replace dispas-sionate deliberation as the basis for the jury's verdict. See

id., at 43, 63 (O'Connor, J., dissenting); id., at 41 (Kennedy,J., concurring in judgment) ("[T]he generality of the instructions may contribute to a certain lack of predictability");
Browning-Ferris Industries of Vt., Inc. v. Kelco Disposal,
Inc., 492 U. S. 257, 281 (1989) (Brennan, J., concurring) (Such"skeletal" guidance is "scarcely better than no guidance at

all," creating a need for more careful review); Smith v. Wade,
461 U. S. 30, 88 (1983) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) (elasticstandards applicable to punitive awards "giv[e] free reign to

the biases and prejudices of juries"). As one commentatorhas explained:

"Like everyone else in the court system, juries needand deserve objective rules for decision. Deprived of
any fixed landmarks and guideposts, any of us can bedistracted, played on, and befuddled to the point where
our best guess is far from reliable." Olson, supra, at175.

It is therefore no surprise that, time and again, this Courtand its Members have expressed concern about punitive
damages awards " `run wild,' " inexplicable on any basis butcaprice or passion.

cases); see also Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U. S. 323, 350
(1974) ("[J]uries assess punitive damages in wholly unpredictable amounts bearing no necessary relation to the actual
harm caused").

Influences such as caprice, passion, bias, and prejudice are
antithetical to the rule of law. If there is a fixture of due
process, it is that a verdict based on such influences cannot

jury no doubt violates due process"). Of course, determin-ing whether a verdict resulted from improper influences is
no easy matter. By tradition and necessity, the circum-stances in which jurors may impeach their own verdict are
quite limited. See Tanner v. United States, 483 U. S. 107,117-121, 127 (1987); 11 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure $ 2810, pp. 71-72 (1973); 2 W. Tidd, Prac-tice of Courts of King's Bench and Common Pleas *908-*909.
But fundamental fairness requires that impermissible influ-ences such as bias and prejudice be discovered nonetheless,
by inference if not by direct proof. As a result, courts atcommon law in England traditionally would strike any award
that appeared so grossly disproportionate as to evidence ca-price, passion, or bias.

Judicial intervention in cases of excessive awards also hasthe critical function of ensuring that another ancient and fundamental principle of justice is observed--that the punish-ment be proportionate to the offense. As we have observed,

Because punitive damages are designed as punishmentrather than compensation,

tions. Ante, at 455. It is thus common ground that anaward may be so excessive as to violate due process.

Ibid.
We part company, however, on how to determine if this issuch an award.

In Solomonic fashion, the plurality rejects both petitioner's and respondents' proffered approaches, instead selectinga seemingly moderate course. See

ante, at 456-458. But
the course the plurality chooses is, in fact, no course at all.The plurality opinion erects not a single guidepost to help

other courts find their way through this area. Rather,quoting

Haslip's observation that there is no " `mathematical bright line between the constitutionally acceptable and
the constitutionally unacceptable,' " ante, at 458 (quoting 499
U. S., at 18), the plurality abandons all pretense of providing
instruction and moves directly into the specifics of this case.

I believe that the plurality errs not only in its result but
also in its approach. Our inability to discern a mathematical
formula does not liberate us altogether from our duty to provide guidance to courts that, unlike this one, must address
jury verdicts such as this on a regular basis. On the contrary, the difficulty of the matter imposes upon us a correspondingly greater obligation to provide the most coherent
explanation we can. I agree with the plurality that we
ought not adopt TXO's or respondents' suggested approach
as a rigid formula for determining the constitutionality of
punitive damages verdicts. But it does not follow that, in
the course of deciding this case, we should avoid offering
even a clue as to our own.

TXO's suggestion that this Court should rely on objective
criteria has much to commend it. As an initial matter, constitutional judgments " `should not be, or appear to be,
merely the subjective views of individual Justices.' " Rummel v. Estelle, 445 U. S. 263, 274 (1980) (quoting Coker v.
Georgia, 433 U. S. 584, 592 (1977) (opinion of White, J.)).
Without objective criteria on which to rely, almost any decision regarding proportionality will be a matter of personal

preference. One judge's excess very well may be another'smoderation. To avoid that element of subjectivity, our

" `judgment[s] should be informed by objective factors to themaximum possible extent.' " 445 U. S., at 274-275 (quoting
same). As the plurality points out, ante, at 455-456, TXOdirects our attention to various objective indicators, including the relationship between the punitive damages awardand compensatory damages, awards of punitive damages
upheld against other defendants in the same jurisdiction,awards upheld for similar torts in other jurisdictions, and
legislatively designated penalties for similar misconduct.While these factors by no means exhaust the due process
inquiry, they are quite probative. It is to their proper appli-cation that I now turn.

A
In my view, due process at least requires judges to engagein searching review where the verdict discloses such great

disproportions as to suggest the possibility of bias, caprice,or passion. As

Justice Stevens observed in a differentcontext, "[o]ne need not use Justice Stewart's classic definition of obscenity--`I know it when I see it'--as an ultimatestandard for judging" the constitutionality of a punitive
damages verdict "to recognize that the dramatically irregu-lar" size and nature of an award "may have sufficient probative force to call for an explanation." Cf. Karcher v. Daggett, 462 U. S. 725, 755 (1983) (concurring opinion) (footnotesomitted).

This $10 million punitive award, returned in a case involv-ing only $19,000 in compensatory damages, is a dramatically
irregular, if not shocking, verdict by any measure. At thevery least it should raise a suspicious judicial eyebrow. Not
only does the punitive award represent over 500 times actualdamages, but it also exceeds economic harm by over $9.98
million. Thus, it cannot be accepted as bearing the "under-standable relationship to compensatory damages," 499 U. S.,
at 22, the Court found sufficient in Haslip. Indeed, in Has509us2111J 05-09-97 16:19:05 PAGES OPINPGT

lip the Court observed that an $840,000 punitive award, rep-resenting four times compensatory damages, may have been

"close to the line" of "constitutional impropriety." Id., at23-24. If the quadruple damages, $840,000 award in

Haslip
was "close to the line," absent a convincing explanation, this
$10 million award--over 500 times actual damages--surelymust cross it.

A comparison of this award and prior ones in West Vir-ginia confirms its unusual nature: It is 20 times larger than
the highest punitive damages award ever upheld in WestVirginia history for any misconduct. See App. to Brief for
Petitioner 1a-3a (listing punitive damages awards affirmed
on appeal in West Virginia). That figure is particularly
surprising if one considers the nature of the offense at issue.
This is not a case involving grave physical injury imposed on
a helpless citizen by a callous malefactor. Rather, it is a
business dispute between two companies in the oil and gas
industry. TXO was accused of slandering respondents' title
to a tract of land--that is, impugning their claim of ownership--in an attempt to win concessions on a pre-existing contract. Although TXO's conduct was clearly wrongful, calculated, and improper, the award in this case cannot be upheld
as a reasoned retributive response. Not only is it greatly in
excess of the actual harm caused, but it is 10 times greater
than the largest punitive damages award for the same tort
in any jurisdiction, id., at 5a-8a (listing all recorded punitive
damages awards for slander of title affirmed on appeal), and
orders of magnitude larger than authorized civil and criminal
penalties for similar offenses, see Brief for Petitioner 19,
nn. 17-18, and App. to Brief for Petitioner 9a-21a (collecting
statutes). By any "objective criteria," Haslip, 499 U. S., at
23, the award is "grossly out of proportion to the severity
of the offense" and bears no "understandable relationship to
compensatory damages," id., at 22. It is, at first blush, an
"extreme resul[t] that jar[s] one's constitutional sensibilities."
Id., at 18.

That these disproportions might implicate due process con-cerns the plurality does not deny. Nonetheless, it refuses to

"enshrine petitioner's comparative approach in a `test' forassessing the constitutionality of punitive damages awards."
Ante, at 458. I agree with the plurality that, although it
might be convenient to establish a multipart test and imposeit upon the States, the principles of federalism counsel

against such a course. The States should be permitted to"experiment with different methods" of ferreting out impermissible awards "and to adjust these methods over time."
Haslip, supra, at 64 (O'Connor, J., dissenting). Nonetheless, I see no reason why this Court or any other would wish
to disregard such probative evidence. For example, although retribution is a permissible consideration in assessing
punitive damages awards, it is quite difficult to determine
whether a particular award can be attributed to that goal;
retribution resists quantification. Nonetheless, jury awards
in similar cases and the civil and criminal penalties created
by the legislature for like conduct can give us some idea of
the limits on retribution. Thus, a $5,000 punitive damages
award on actual damages of $1 may not seem well proportioned at first blush; but if the legislature has seen fit to
impose a $50,000 penalty for that very same conduct, the
award might be deemed a reasoned retributive response.

This approach, of course, has its limits. Because no two
cases are alike, not all comparisons will be enlightening.
See ante, at 457-458 (plurality opinion). But recognizing the
limits of an approach does not compel us to discard it entirely.
I do not see what can be gained by blinding ourselves to the
few clear guideposts in an area so painfully bereft of objective criteria. Indeed, Justice Stevens joined in proposing
precisely such an approach to punitive damages under the
Eighth Amendment in Browning-Ferris, see 492 U. S., at 301
(O'Connor, J., joined by Stevens, J., concurring in part and
dissenting in part). Moreover, courts at common law engaged in similar comparisons. See, e. g., Travis v. Barger,

24 Barb. 614, 629 (N. Y. 1857) (comparing verdicts for similartorts); International & Great Northern R. Co. v. Telephone & Telegraph Co., 69 Tex. 277, 282, 5 S. W. 517, 518(1887) (comparing ratios). In any event, what the comparisons demonstrate in this case is what one might have sus-pected from the beginning. This award cannot be justified
as a reasoned retributive response, for it is notably out ofline with the punishment previously imposed by juries or
established by statute for similar conduct.

B
That, however, does not end our inquiry. In some cases,the unusual nature of the award will be explained by the

peculiar considerations placed before the jury. Indeed, theplurality asserts that such an explanation exists in this case.
The award, the plurality explains, may have been based onthe profit TXO anticipated or the harm TXO would have imposed on respondents had its scheme been successful. Ante,at 459-462.

I have no quarrel with the plurality that, in the abstract,punitive damages may be predicated on the potential but unrealized harm to the victim, or even on the defendant's antici-pated gain. Linking the punitive award to those factors not
only substantially furthers the State's weighty interests indeterrence and retribution, but also can be traced well back
in the common law. See, e. g., Benson v. Frederick, 3 Burr.1846, 97 Eng. Rep. 1130 (K. B. 1766) (Wilmot, J.) (damages
for ordering the plaintiff flogged by two drummers not ex-cessive even though disproportionate to plaintiff 's actual suffering, as "it was rather owing to the lenity of the drummersthan of the [defendant] that the [plaintiff] did not suffer
more"). The plurality's theory, however, bears little rela-tionship to what actually happened in this case.

1
The record demonstrates that the potential harm theory islittle more than an after-the-fact rationalization invented by

counsel to defend this startling award on appeal. The $5 to$8.3 million estimate of potential loss that respondents proffer today appears nowhere in the record. No expert or laywitness testified to the jury about any such figure. No one
directed the jury's attention to the technical documents or
scattered testimony on which respondents now rely. See
ante, at 450-451, n. 10 (plurality opinion). No one told the
jury how to pull all those numbers together to calculate sucha figure. In fact, the jury never was told that it was permitted to do so.Respondents did not even present their $5 to $8.3 million
estimate to defend the verdict before the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals. Nor did that court rely on such
an estimate. Its opinion, which the plurality applauds as
"thorough," ante, at 465, nowhere suggests that the jury
might have based the award on the potential harm to respondents or on TXO's anticipated profit. Rather, its sole
reference to potential harm is the "millions of dollars of damages" that might result if TXO repeated its misdeeds against
"other victims." 187 W. Va., at 476, 419 S. E. 2d, at 889
(emphasis added). Virtually any tort, however, can cause
millions of dollars of harm if imposed against a sufficient
number of victims.

Respondents' $5 to $8.3 million estimate appeared for the
first time after this Court granted certiorari, having been
produced exclusively for our consumption. As the plurality
notes, there is every reason to believe that the figure, derived as it is from a series of extrapolations and economic
assumptions never presented to the jury and yet untested
by adversary presentation, is unrealistic. See ante, at 461.
Consequently, the plurality refuses to rely on the figure, instead offering a series of its own estimates. See ante, at
462. These estimates also are speculative, however, as the
plurality does not indicate how they were derived or where
they are supported in the record. The little evidence regarding potential harm the record does yield, it turns out, is

509us2111J 05-09-97 16:19:05 PAGES OPINPGT

RESOURCES CORP.

O'Connor, J., dissenting

so uncertain and ambiguous that the plurality cannot rely onit, either; to the extent it demonstrates anything at all, it

shows respondents' estimate to be exaggerated. See Tr.100, 103-104.

2
But even if we assume that the plurality's estimates ofpotential harm are plausible or supported by the evidence,

they are, on this record, entirely irrelevant. The questionis not simply whether

this Court might think the award ap-propriate in light of its estimate of potential harm. The

question is also whether the jury might have relied on suchan estimate rather than some impermissible factor, such as
a personal preference for the primarily local plaintiffs ascompared to the unsympathetic and wealthy out-of-state defendant, as TXO contends. After all, due process does notsimply require that a particular result be substantively acceptable; it also requires that it be reached on the basis ofpermissible considerations. See Haslip, 499 U. S., at 41
(Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment). In this case, thejury instructions precluded the jury from relying on the potential harm theory the plurality endorses. As a result, thattheory can neither explain nor justify the otherwise astonishing verdict the jury returned.At trial, the jury was instructed to consider numerous
factors when setting the punitive damages award, including" `the nature of the wrongdoing, the extent of the harm inflicted, the intent of the party committing the act, the wealthof the perpetrator, as well as any mitigating circumstances.' "
Ante, at 463, n. 29 (plurality opinion) (quoting App. 34-35).Nowhere do the instructions mention the alternative measure of potential harm to respondents upon which the plural-ity relies today.

Of course, the instructions do mention that the goal of pu-nitive damages is deterrence. One therefore might hypothesize that a particularly sophisticated jury would realize thatimposing damages in an amount linked to potential harm or

487Cite as: 509 U. S. 443 (1993)
O'Connor, J., dissenting
the defendant's expected gain might provide appropriate de-terrence. One might even go so far as to suppose that the

jury would be daring enough to apply that measure, eventhough the trial court listed numerous factors, including

actual harm, but made no mention of potential harm. But
such speculation has no application in this case, for the juryinstructions made it quite clear that deterrence was linked

not to an unmentioned factor like potential gain but to afactor the trial court

did mention--TXO's wealth:

" `The object of [punitive damages] is to deter TXO Production Corp. and others from committing like offenses
in the future. Therefore the law recognizes that to infact deter such conduct may require a larger fine upon

one of large means than it would upon one of ordinarymeans under the same or similar circumstances.' "
Ante, at 463, n. 29 (plurality opinion) (quoting App. 35)(emphasis added).

A reasonable juror hearing these instructions would nothave felt free to consider the potential harm or expected gain
measures the plurality proposes today.The two passages the plurality excerpts from closing arguments, see ante, at 461, do not support the plurality'stheory. Respondent Tug Fork Land Company's closing
argument does mention that TXO thought the wells would
produce " `lot[s] of money.' " Ibid. (quoting Tr. 748-749).But that remark had nothing to do with punitive damages.

Instead, counsel was addressing the issue of liability: Accord-ing to him, TXO's desire to obtain all the royalties was the
motive for its bad faith conduct. See Tr. 746-749 (TXO slandered respondents' title to lower the value of the property
so it could exact concessions or win 100% of royalties by
means of a lawsuit). When counsel did discuss the appropriate measure of punitive damages, not once did he mention
the potential harm to respondents. Instead, he relied exclusively on TXO's vast wealth:

"His Honor has instructed you that you may awardpunitive damages and I've indicated to you what punitive damages [are]. Now, just consider the wealth ofthis corporation. [T]he reason for putting in [expert

attempt to quantify TXO's potential gain. Nor did he en-courage the jury to base the punitive damages award on
TXO's expected profit. Instead, counsel argued only onemeasure for punitive damages--TXO's wealth:

"A two billion dollar company. Ha[s] earnings of$225,000,000, average. Last year made $125,000,000.00
alone. Last year. Now, what's a good fine for acompany like that? A hundred thousand? A million?
You can do that if you think it's fair . . . ." Tr. 781.
The portion of counsel's argument the plurality relies upon,ante, at 461, turns out to be a transition between a discussion

of TXO's conduct and a plea for the jury to award punitivedamages based exclusively on TXO's wealth. Immediately
after delivering the portion of the argument the pluralityreproduces--in which counsel told the jury that the punishment should " `fit' " the scheme and " `fit the wealth,' " ibid.--he asked rhetorically, "Now, how much is the wealth?" Tr.
780. It was then that he told the jury, in great detail, about

TXO's vast resources. At no point, however, did counsel askrhetorically, "Now, how much was the potential profit?" At

no point did he answer that question. Nor did he eversuggest that the jury calculate potential harm or base its
punitive damages award thereon. Instead, like cocounselbefore him, he relied exclusively on TXO's wealth. See

id., at 781-782.I am therefore unpersuaded by the plurality's assertion
that this award may be upheld based on the potential harmto respondents or TXO's potential gain. That theory was
not available to the jury under the court's instructions. Itwas not one supported by evidence on which the jury might
have relied. And it is not one that trial counsel chose topromote. It was instead an after-the-fact rationalization invented by appellate counsel who could not otherwise explainthis disproportionate award.

C
There is another explanation for the verdict, but it is notone that permits affirmance. As I read the record in this

case, it seems quite likely that the jury in fact was undulyinfluenced by the fact that TXO is a very large, out-of-state
corporation.In

Haslip, this Court considered jury instructions that dif-fered from those used here in two material respects. First,

unlike the instructions in Haslip, which did not permit thejury to consider the defendant's wealth, the instructions in
this case specifically directed the jury to take TXO's wealthinto account. The plurality concedes that introducing TXO's
wealth into the calculus "increased the risk that the awardmay have been influenced by prejudice against large corporations, a risk that is of special concern when the defendantis," as here, "a nonresident."

Ante, at 464. Second, the in-structions directed the jury to impose punitive damages " `to

provide additional compensation for the conduct to which theinjured parties have been subjected.' " Ante, at 463, n. 29

(plurality opinion) (quoting App. 34). The latter instruction,of course, is without legal meaning.

Ante, at 464 (plurality
opinion) (We do "not understand the reference . . . to `ad-ditional compensation' "). Plaintiffs are compensated for

injuries they have suffered; one cannot speak of "additional
compensation" unless it is linked to some additional harm.To a juror, however, compensation is the money it awards

the plaintiff; "additional compensation," if not linked to aparticular measure of harm, is simply additional money the
jury gives to the plaintiff. As a result, the "additional com-pensation" instruction, considered together with the instruction directing the jury's attention to TXO's massive wealth,
encouraged the jury to transfer some of TXO's impressive
wealth to the smaller and more sympathetic respondents as
undifferentiated "additional compensation"--for any reason,
or no reason at all. In fact, the instructions practically ensured that this would occur. They provided the jury with
only two objective factors on which to rely. See supra, at
486 (citing jury instructions). The first was actual harm, a
relatively small sum on which the jury obviously did not rely;
the second was TXO's wealth, a factor that obviously impressed the jury a great deal. Thus, unlike the instructions in
Haslip, these instructions did not prevent respondents from
"enjoy[ing] a windfall because they have the good fortune
to have a defendant with a deep pocket." 499 U. S., at 22.
Instead, they ensured that a windfall verdict would result
by inviting the jury to redistribute wealth to respondents as
undifferentiated "additional compensation," based solely on
TXO's financial position.

That a jury might have such inclinations should come
as no surprise. Courts long have recognized that jurors
may view large corporations with great disfavor. See,
e. g., Illinois Central R. Co. v. Welch, 52 Ill. 183, 188 (1869)
("[J]uries may generally assess an amount of damages
against railway corporations which, in similar cases between
individuals, would be considered unjust in the extreme. It

is lamentable that the popular prejudice against these corpo-rations should be so powerful as to taint the administration

of justice, but we cannot close our eyes to the fact"). Corpora-tions are mere abstractions and, as such, are unlikely to be
viewed with much sympathy. Moreover, they often represent a large accumulation of productive resources; jurors nat-urally think little of taking an otherwise large sum of money

out of what appears to be an enormously larger pool ofwealth. Finally, juries may feel privileged to correct perceived social ills stemming from unequal wealth distributionby transferring money from "wealthy" corporations to comparatively needier plaintiffs. Brickman, The Asbestos Litigation Crisis, 13 Cardozo L. Rev. 1819, 1849, n. 128 (1992);
Ellis, Fairness and Efficiency in the Law of Punitive Damages, 56 S. Cal. L. Rev. 1, 61-62 (1982); Owen, Problems in
Assessing Punitive Damages Against Manufacturers of
Defective Products, 49 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1, 45-46 (1982) ( jury
assessing punitive damages against multimillion dollar corporation forced to think of an award measuring seven, eight,
or nine figures); see also supra, at 474-475 ( juror discretion
in awarding punitive damages not limited); cf. Smith v. Covell, 100 Cal. App. 3d 947, 960, 161 Cal. Rptr. 377, 385 (1980)
( juror impressed with idea that plaintiffs had money and
" `didn't need anymore' ").

This is not to say that consideration of a defendant's
wealth is unconstitutional. To be sure, there are strong economic arguments that permitting juries to consider wealth
is unwise if not irrational, see Abraham & Jeffries, Punitive
Damages and the Rule of Law: The Role of Defendant's
Wealth, 18 J. Legal Studies 415 (1989), especially where the
defendant is a corporation, id., at 421-422; cf. Zazu' Designs

Economics school either. As a historical matter, the wealthof the perpetrator long has been thought relevant. See

Browning-Ferris, 492 U. S., at 300 (O'Connor, J., concurringin part and dissenting in part) (citing the Magna Carta and
Blackstone's Commentaries). Moreover, Haslip itself suggests that the defendant's wealth is a permissible consider-ation,

ante, at 462, n. 28, 464 (plurality opinion), although it
does so only in the context of appellate review. See 499U. S., at 22.

Nonetheless, courts must have authority to recognize thespecial danger of bias that such considerations create. The
plurality does just that today, ante, at 464, as this Court,
other tribunals, and numerous commentators have before.
See, e. g., Morris, Punitive Damages in Tort Cases, 44 Harv.
L. Rev. 1173, 1191 (1931) ("It is a good guess that rich men
do not fare well before juries, and the more emphasis placed
on their riches, the less well they fare. Such evidence may
do more harm than good; jurymen may be more interested in
divesting vested interests than in attempting to fix penalties
which will make for effective working of the admonitory
function"); Abraham & Jeffries, supra, at 424; Illinois Central R. Co., supra, at 188 (bias against railroads); McConnell
v. Hampton, 12 Johns. 234, 236 (N. Y. 1815) (Thompson, C. J.)
( jury unduly influenced by defendant's great wealth); cf.
Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc., 453 U. S. 247, 270-271 (1981)
("[E]vidence of a [municipality's wealth, inasmuch as it has
unlimited taxing power], may have a prejudicial impact on
the jury, in effect encouraging it to impose a sizable award.
The impact of such a windfall recovery is likely to be both
unpredictable and, at times, substantial"); see also Haslip,
499 U. S., at 43 (O'Connor, J., dissenting) ( jurors, if not
properly guided, may "target unpopular defendants . . . and
redistribute wealth").

The risk of prejudice was especially grave here. The jury
repeatedly was told of TXO's extraordinary resources, which
respondents estimated at $2 billion. To make matters

O'Connor, J., dissenting
worse, unlike the jurors or the primary plaintiffs, TXO wasnot from West Virginia. It was an interloper, from the large

State of Texas. As the Supreme Court of Appeals of WestVirginia has recognized, the temptation to transfer wealth
from out-of-state corporate defendants to in-state plaintiffscan be quite strong. See

Garnes v. Fleming Landfill, Inc.,186 W. Va. 656, 665, 413 S. E. 2d 897, 906 (1991) (Excess

jury discretion "[i]nevitably . . . leads to increasing efforts toredistribute wealth from without the state to within"; cases
involving large awards typically pit local plaintiffs against"out-of-state (often faceless, publicly held) corporations").
That court speaks from experience. The three highestpunitive damages awards ever affirmed in West Virginia, including this one, were assessed against relatively wealthyout-of-state defendants.

Jarvis v. Modern Woodmen ofAmerica, 185 W. Va. 305, 406 S. E. 2d 736 (1991); Berry v.

Nationwide Mutual Fire Ins. Co., 181 W. Va. 168, 381S. E. 2d 367 (1989).

Counsels' arguments, however, converted that grave riskof prejudice into a near certainty. Repeatedly they reminded the jury that TXO was from another State. Repeat-edly they told the jury about TXO's massive wealth. And
repeatedly they told the jury that it could do anything itthought "fair." The opening line from rebuttal set the tone.
"Ladies and gentleman of the jury," one attorney began,"this greedy bunch from down in Texas still doesn't understand this case." Tr. 773. Playing on images of Texans asoverrich gamblers who profit by chance rather than work, he
referred to TXO shortly thereafter as a bunch of "Texas highrollers, wildcatters." Id., at 777. Finally, counsel drove
the point home yet one more time, comparing TXO to anobviously wealthy out-of-town visitor who refuses to put
money in the parking meter to help pay for communityservice:

"Well, what is fair? . . . If someone comes to town andintentionally doesn't put a quarter in the meter, stays

here all day, [in this] town that needs it to pay for the
police force and the fire department, they give [him] a
fine. And at the end of the day [he] may have to pay a
dollar. That person reaches in his billfold at the end of
the day and maybe he's got a hundred bucks in there.
He doesn't want to have to pay that dollar, but he does,
because he knows if he doesn't [he'll have legal
problems]. . . . The town didn't take everything from the
individual, didn't ruin [him], just took one percent of
what that person had in cash. One percent. You can
fine TXO one percent if you want, you can fine them
one dollar if you want. But I submit to you a one percent fine, the same as John Doe on this street, would be
fair. That's twelve and a half million dollars, based
on what they had left over. And their earnings w[ere]
$225,000,000.00 [per year]. I mean, yeah, their cash
flow. Their surplus. So anything between twelve and
a half million and twenty-two million is only one percent--the same as this poor guy who just tried to cheat
a little bit. Now that's a lot of money. I hope, like I
said, you don't analyze this on a lot or a little, but
fair." Id., at 781-782 (emphases added).

Over and over respondents' lawyers reminded the jury that
there were virtually no substantive limits on its discretion.
Time and again they told the jury of TXO's great wealth and
that it could take away any amount it wanted, as long as
it seemed "fair." Id., at 781 ("It isn't really whether the
verdict is too large or too small, too big or too little. It's
whether it's fair"); ibid. ("A two billion dollar company.
Have earnings of $225,000,000.00, average. Last year made
$125,000,000.00 alone. Last year. Now, what's a good fine
for a company like that? A hundred thousand? A million?
You can do that if you think it's fair . . ."). And each time
the argument found solid support in the trial court's instructions, which not only licensed the jury to afford respondents

any "additional compensation" they believed appropriate, butalso encouraged them to do so based on TXO's wealth alone.

Given the absence of another plausible explanation for thismonumentally large punitive damages award, I believe it
likely, if not inescapable, that the jury was influenced undulyby TXO's out-of-state status and its large resources. The
plurality acknowledges this possibility, see ante, at 464, butrefuses to address it. TXO, the plurality contends, failed to
press its objections to the jury instructions in the state courtbelow.

Ibid. I disagree. TXO's brief specifically arguedthat the jury instructions did not meet the "Haslip standards

and [were] not constitutionally permissible." Brief for Ap-pellant in No. 20281 (W. Va.), p. 48; see

id., at 44-46 ( juryinstructions insufficient under Garnes v. Fleming Landfill,

Inc., supra, a recent West Virginia Supreme Court of Ap-peals decision interpreting Haslip). The State Supreme
Court of Appeals so understood TXO's challenge. See 187W. Va., at 473-477, 419 S. E. 2d, at 886-890.

Of course, TXO did not make precisely the same argu-ments it makes here. But it was not required to. "Once a
federal claim is properly presented, a party can make anyargument in support of that claim; parties are not limited to
the precise arguments they made below." Yee v. Escondido,503 U. S. 519, 534 (1992). There can be little doubt that TXO
argued below that the punitive damages award was exces-sive; there can be little doubt that TXO identified the jury
instructions as being partially responsible. TXO ought notbe precluded from fully presenting its arguments here. Because those arguments demonstrate that this award wasbased on considerations inconsistent with due process, I
would reverse the judgment below so the matter could besubmitted to the consideration of a second jury.

Confronted by a $10 million verdict on damages of $19,000,the State Supreme Court of Appeals in this case did not en509us2111J 05-09-97 16:19:06 PAGES OPINPGT

gage in searching review. Instead it added insult to injury,applying cavalier standards in the course of a cursory examination of the case. Because the review afforded TXO wasinsufficient to conform with the criteria this Court approved
in Haslip, the case at least should be remanded for constitu-tionally adequate postverdict review.

A
Two Terms ago, this Court in Haslip upheld Alabama'spunitive damages regime against constitutional challenge.

Although the Court recognized that juries in Alabama re-ceive limited instructions regarding punitive damages, see
499 U. S., at 6, n. 1, 19-20, it was reassured by the fact thatthe Alabama courts subject punitive verdicts to exacting
postverdict review at two different levels. First, Alabamatrial courts must indicate on the record their " `reasons for
interfering with a jury verdict, or refusing to do so, ongrounds of excessiveness.' " Id., at 20 (quoting Hammond
v. Gadsden, 493 So. 2d 1374, 1379 (1986)). Second, the Ala-bama Supreme Court itself provides an additional "check"
by conducting comparative analysis and applying detailedsubstantive standards--seven in all--thereby "ensur[ing]
that the award does not exceed an amount that will accom-plish society's goals of punishment and deterrence." 499
U. S., at 21 (internal quotation marks omitted). Specifically,the Alabama Supreme Court examines:

"(a) whether there is a reasonable relationship betweenthe punitive damages award and the harm likely to result from the defendant's conduct as well as the harmthat actually has occurred; (b) the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant's conduct, the duration of thatconduct, the defendant's awareness, any concealment,
and the existence and frequency of similar past conduct;(c) the profitability to the defendant of the wrongful conduct and the desirability of removing that profit and ofhaving the defendant also sustain a loss; (d) the `financial

position' of the defendant; (e) all the costs of litigation;(f) the imposition of criminal sanctions on the defendant

for its conduct, these to be taken in mitigation; and(g) the existence of other civil awards against the defendant for the same conduct, these also to be taken inmitigation."

Id., at 21-22.

In Haslip, the Court concluded that application of thosestandards "imposes a sufficiently definite and meaningful

constraint" on factfinder discretion. Id., at 22. Because thestandards had a "real effect,"

ibid., the Court upheld Ala-bama's regime against constitutional challenge despite the

relatively sparse guidance it afforded juries.As the plurality admits, ante, at 463-464, the jury instructions used here were not dissimilar to those employed inHaslip. Unlike Haslip, however, the verdict they produced
was not subjected to post-trial review sufficient to impose a"meaningful constraint" on factfinder discretion. Indeed,
the post-trial review offered here bears no resemblance tothat approved in

Haslip. In contrast to the trial judge inHaslip, the trial judge here made no written findings. Nor

did he announce why he believed--or even if he believed--that the amount of damages bore a reasonable or recognizable relationship to actual damages or any other relevantmeasure. Instead, ruling from the bench, the trial judge
summarily denied TXO's motions seeking reduction or elimi-nation of the punitive damages award.

More important, the Supreme Court of Appeals of WestVirginia did not do much better. At the outset, it refused
to consider the possibility of remittitur because TXO "andits agents and servants failed to conduct themselves as gentlemen." 187 W. Va., at 462, 419 S. E. 2d, at 875. Proceed-ing to the question whether the award of punitive damages
should be stricken as excessive, the court distinguished be-tween two categories of defendants: those who are "really
stupid" and those who are "really mean." Id., at 474-476,419 S. E. 2d, at 887-889. If the defendant is "really stupid,"

509us2111J 05-09-97 16:19:06 PAGES OPINPGT
498 TXO PRODUCTION CORP. v. ALLIANCE

RESOURCES CORP.

O'Connor, J., dissenting

the court explained, "the outer limit of punitive damages is"generally about "five to one." Id., at 476, 419 S. E. 2d, at

889. For the "really mean" defendant, however, "even puni-tive damages 500 times greater than compensatory damages
are not per se unconstitutional." Ibid. TXO, it seems, wasnot really stupid but "really mean." The Supreme Court of
Appeals affirmed the $10 million punitive award even thoughit was 526 times greater than compensatory damages.

Reference to categories like "really stupid" and "reallymean" are a caricature of the difficult task of determining
whether an award may be upheld consistent with due proc-ess. It is simply not enough to observe that the conduct
was malicious and conclude that, as a result, the sky (or 500times compensatory damages) is the limit. But cf. ante, at
468-469 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring injudgment) (so concluding solely because the conduct was malicious and the defendant rich). Instead, post-trial reviewmust be sufficient to "ensur[e] that punitive damages awards
are not grossly out of proportion to the severity of the of-fense and have some understandable relationship to" some
measure of harm. Haslip, supra, at 22. Aside from itstwo-page dissertation on the difference between "really stupid" and "really mean," however, the State Supreme Courtof Appeals offered only three conclusory sentences in a single
paragraph to bolster its conclusion that the damages herewere not excessive. See

ante, at 453 (plurality opinion) (cit-ing 187 W. Va., at 476, 419 S. E. 2d, at 889). Because I believe

that such cursory review is inconsistent with this Court'sdecision in

Haslip, I cannot join my colleagues in affirming.

B
That the Supreme Court of Appeals would engage in suchcursory review is something of a surprise. In

Garnes v.Fleming Landfill, Inc., 186 W. Va. 656, 413 S. E. 2d 897

(1991), that court demonstrated concern for the due processimplications of punitive awards. Holding that West Virgin509us2111J 05-09-97 16:19:06 PAGES OPINPGT

O'Connor, J., dissenting
ia's previous punitive damages regime was constitutionallysuspect in light of

Haslip, it required trial courts to instruct
juries on numerous factors relevant to the measure of puni-tive damages, see 186 W. Va., at 667-668, 413 S. E. 2d, at

908-909; it mandated that trial courts conduct extensive review and articulate reasons for their decisions on the record,
id., at 668-669, 413 S. E. 2d, at 909-910; and it announced
that it would apply the factors approved in Haslip in its ownreview, 186 W. Va., at 669, 413 S. E. 2d, at 910.

Unfortunately for TXO, Garnes was decided after TXO'strial took place. Although the Supreme Court of Appeals
recognized that TXO had not received the benefit of Garnes'
and Haslip's protections, it refused to remand the case. Instead, the court indicated that it would be "especially diligent" in reviewing this award; it went on to recite language
from both Haslip and Garnes. It is therefore clear that
Haslip still governs punitive damages awards in West Virginia. As a result, the plurality perhaps declines to reverse
because it believes that the Supreme Court of Appeals' failure to follow Haslip here is of little consequence to anyone
but TXO. After all, a decision of this Court requiring more
searching review would alter only the result in this particular case and perhaps a few like it, without changing the law,
even in West Virginia.

If the plurality is in fact proceeding on such an assumption,
I believe it is mistaken. While this Court has the ultimate
power to interpret the Constitution, we grant review in only
a small number of cases. We therefore rely primarily on
state courts to fulfill the constitutional role as primary guarantors of federal rights. But the state courts must do more
than recite the constitutional rule. They also must apply it,
faithful to its letter and cognizant of the principles underlying it. Unfortunately, such review is not always forthcoming. Amici recite case after case in which review has been
inadequate or absent altogether. See, e. g., Brief for Phillips
Petroleum Co. et al. as Amici Curiae 20-27. The Supreme

Court of Appeals of West Virginia, at the same time it recog-nized Haslip as law, itself warned:

"[W]e understand as well as the next court how to . . .articulate the correct legal principle, and then perversely fit into that principle a set of facts to which theprinciple obviously does not apply. [All judges] know
how to mouth the correct legal rules with ironic solem-nity while avoiding those rules' logical consequences."
Garnes, supra, at 666, 413 S. E. 2d, at 907 (footnoteomitted).

I fear that the Supreme Court of Appeals followed such acourse in this case. By affirming the judgment nonetheless,
today's decision renders the meaningful appellate reviewcontemplated in

Haslip illusory; courts now may disregardthe post-trial review required by due process at whim or

will, so long as they do not deny its necessity openly oraltogether.

IV
As little as 30 years ago, punitive damages awards were"rarely assessed" and usually "small in amount." Ellis, 56

S. Cal. L. Rev., at 2. Recently, however, the frequency andsize of such awards have been skyrocketing. One commentator has observed that "hardly a month goes by withouta multimillion-dollar punitive damages verdict in a product
liability case." Wheeler, A Proposal for Further CommonLaw Development of the Use of Punitive Damages in Modern Product Liability Litigation, 40 Ala. L. Rev. 919 (1989).And it appears that the upward trajectory continues unabated. See Volz & Fayz, Punitive Damages and the DueProcess Clause: The Search for Constitutional Standards, 69
U. Det. Mercy L. Rev. 459, 462, n. 17 (1992). The increasedfrequency and size of punitive awards, however, has not been
matched by a corresponding expansion of procedural protec-tions or predictability. On the contrary, although some
courts have made genuine efforts at reform, many courts

continue to provide jurors with skeletal guidance that per-mits the traditional guarantor of fairness--the jury itself--to

be converted into a source of caprice and bias. This Court'sdecision in Haslip promised that, even if juries occasionally
failed to fulfill their function faithfully, trial and appellatecourts would provide meaningful review sufficient to discern
impermissible influences and guarantee constitutional re-sults. In my view, today's decision fails to make good on
that promise. I therefore respectfully dissent.

ST. MARY'S HONOR CENTER et al. v. HICKS
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eighth circuit

No. 92-602. Argued April 20, 1993--Decided June 25, 1993
Petitioner halfway house employed respondent Hicks as a correctional officer and later a shift commander. After being demoted and ultimately
discharged, Hicks filed suit, alleging that these actions had been taken
because of his race in violation of, inter alia, $ 703(a)(1) of Title VII of
the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Adhering to the allocation of the burden
of production and the order for the presentation of proof in Title VII
discriminatory-treatment cases that was established in McDonnell
Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U. S. 792, the District Court found that
Hicks had established, by a preponderance of the evidence, a prima facie
case of racial discrimination; that petitioners had rebutted that presumption by introducing evidence of two legitimate, nondiscriminatory
reasons for their actions; and that petitioners' reasons were pretextual.
It nonetheless held that Hicks had failed to carry his ultimate burden
of proving that the adverse actions were racially motivated. In setting
aside this determination, the Court of Appeals held that Hicks was entitled to judgment as a matter of law once he proved that all of petitioners' proffered reasons were pretextual.

Held: The trier of fact's rejection of an employer's asserted reasons for

(a) Under McDonnell Douglas, once Hicks established, by a preponderance of the evidence, a prima facie case of discrimination, Texas
Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U. S. 248, 252-253, a presumption arose that petitioners unlawfully discriminated against him,
id., at 254, requiring judgment in his favor unless petitioners came forward with an explanation. This presumption placed upon petitioners
the burden of producing evidence that the adverse actions were taken
for legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons, which, if believed by the trier
of fact, would support a finding that unlawful discrimination did not
cause their actions. Id., at 254-255, and n. 8. However, as in the case
of all presumptions, see Fed. Rule Evid. 301, the ultimate burden of
persuasion remained at all times with Hicks, 450 U. S., at 253. The
Court of Appeals erred when it concluded that the trier of fact's disbelief
of petitioners' proffered reasons placed petitioners in the same position
as if they had remained silent in the face of Hicks' prima facie case of

racial discrimination. Petitioners' production of evidence of nondiscriminatory reasons, whether ultimately persuasive or not, satisfied
their burden of production and rebutted the presumption of intentional
discrimination. The McDonnell Douglas framework then became irrelevant, and the trier of fact was required to decide the ultimate question
of fact: whether Hicks had proved that petitioners intentionally discriminated against him because of his race. Compelling judgment for Hicks
would disregard the fundamental principle of Rule 301 that a presumption does not shift the burden of proof, and would ignore the admonition
that the Title VII plaintiff at all times bears the ultimate burden of
persuasion. Pp. 505-512.

(b) This Court has no authority to impose liability upon an employer
for alleged discriminatory employment practices unless the factfinder
determines that the employer has unlawfully discriminated. Nor may
the Court substitute for that required finding the much different and
much lesser finding that the employer's explanation of its action was not
believable. Any doubt created by a dictum in Burdine that falsity of
the employer's explanation is alone enough to sustain a plaintiff's case
was eliminated by Postal Service Bd. of Governors v. Aikens, 460 U. S.

Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.
We granted certiorari to determine whether, in a suitagainst an employer alleging intentional racial discrimination in violation of $ 703(a)(1) of Title VII of the Civil RightsAct of 1964, 78 Stat. 255, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-2(a)(1), the trier
of fact's rejection of the employer's asserted reasons for itsactions mandates a finding for the plaintiff.

I
Petitioner St. Mary's Honor Center (St. Mary's) is a half-way house operated by the Missouri Department of Corrections and Human Resources (MDCHR). Respondent MelvinHicks, a black man, was hired as a correctional officer at
St. Mary's in August 1978 and was promoted to shift com-mander, one of six supervisory positions, in February 1980.

In 1983 MDCHR conducted an investigation of the admin-istration of St. Mary's, which resulted in extensive supervisory changes in January 1984. Respondent retained hisposition, but John Powell became the new chief of custody

Opinion of the Court
Long the new superintendent. Prior to these personnel
changes respondent had enjoyed a satisfactory employment
record, but soon thereafter became the subject of repeated,
and increasingly severe, disciplinary actions. He was suspended for five days for violations of institutional rules by
his subordinates on March 3, 1984. He received a letter of
reprimand for alleged failure to conduct an adequate investigation of a brawl between inmates that occurred during his
shift on March 21. He was later demoted from shift commander to correctional officer for his failure to ensure that
his subordinates entered their use of a St. Mary's vehicle into
the official logbook on March 19, 1984. Finally, on June 7,
1984, he was discharged for threatening Powell during an
exchange of heated words on April 19.

Respondent brought this suit in the United States District
Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, alleging that petitioner St. Mary's violated $ 703(a)(1) of Title VII of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-2(a)(1), and that petitioner Long violated Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, by
demoting and then discharging him because of his race.
After a full bench trial, the District Court found for petitioners. 756 F. Supp. 1244 (ED Mo. 1991). The United States
Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed and remanded, 970 F. 2d 487 (1992), and we granted certiorari, 506

506 ST. MARY'S HONOR CENTER v. HICKS

Opinion of the Court
With the goal of "progressively . . . sharpen[ing] the inquiry
into the elusive factual question of intentional discrimination," Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450
U. S. 248, 255, n. 8 (1981), our opinion in McDonnell Douglas
Corp. v. Green, 411 U. S. 792 (1973), established an allocation
of the burden of production and an order for the presentation
of proof in Title VII discriminatory-treatment cases.1 The
plaintiff in such a case, we said, must first establish, by a
preponderance of the evidence, a "prima facie" case of racial
discrimination. Burdine, supra, at 252-253. Petitioners do
not challenge the District Court's finding that respondent
satisfied the minimal requirements of such a prima facie case
(set out in McDonnell Douglas, supra, at 802) by proving (1)
that he is black, (2) that he was qualified for the position of
shift commander, (3) that he was demoted from that position
and ultimately discharged, and (4) that the position remained
open and was ultimately filled by a white man. 756 F. Supp.,
at 1249-1250.

Under the McDonnell Douglas scheme, "[e]stablishment
of the prima facie case in effect creates a presumption that
the employer unlawfully discriminated against the employee." Burdine, supra, at 254. To establish a "presumption" is to say that a finding of the predicate fact (here, the
prima facie case) produces "a required conclusion in the absence of explanation" (here, the finding of unlawful discrimination). 1 D. Louisell & C. Mueller, Federal Evidence $ 67,
p. 536 (1977). Thus, the McDonnell Douglas presumption
places upon the defendant the burden of producing an expla1 The Court of Appeals held that the purposeful-discrimination element
of respondent's $ 1983 claim against petitioner Long is the same as the
purposeful-discrimination element of his Title VII claim against petitioner
St. Mary's. 970 F. 2d 487, 490-491 (CA8 1992). Neither side challenges
that proposition, and we shall assume that the McDonnell Douglas framework is fully applicable to racial-discrimination-in-employment claims
under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983. Cf. Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S.
164, 186 (1989) (applying framework to claims under 42 U. S. C. $ 1981).

Opinion of the Court
nation to rebut the prima facie case--i. e., the burden of "pro-ducing evidence" that the adverse employment actions were

taken "for a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason." Burdine, 450 U. S., at 254. "[T]he defendant must clearly set
forth, through the introduction of admissible evidence," reasons for its actions which, if believed by the trier of fact,would support a finding that unlawful discrimination was not

the cause of the employment action. Id., at 254-255, andn. 8. It is important to note, however, that although the
McDonnell Douglas presumption shifts the burden of production to the defendant, "[t]he ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that the defendant intentionally discrimi-nated against the plaintiff remains at all times with the

plaintiff." 450 U. S., at 253. In this regard it operates like
all presumptions, as described in Federal Rule of Evidence301:

"In all civil actions and proceedings not otherwise
provided for by Act of Congress or by these rules, a
presumption imposes on the party against whom it isdirected the burden of going forward with evidence to

rebut or meet the presumption, but does not shift tosuch party the burden of proof in the sense of the risk
of nonpersuasion, which remains throughout the trialupon the party on whom it was originally cast."

Respondent does not challenge the District Court's findingthat petitioners sustained their burden of production by introducing evidence of two legitimate, nondiscriminatory rea-sons for their actions: the severity and the accumulation of
rules violations committed by respondent. 756 F. Supp., at
1250. Our cases make clear that at that point the shifted
burden of production became irrelevant: "If the defendant
carries this burden of production, the presumption raised by
the prima facie case is rebutted," Burdine, 450 U. S., at 255,
and "drops from the case," id., at 255, n. 10. The plaintiff
then has "the full and fair opportunity to demonstrate,"

Opinion of the Court
through presentation of his own case and through cross-examination of the defendant's witnesses, "that the proffered

reason was not the true reason for the employment decision,"
id., at 256, and that race was. He retains that "ultimate
burden of persuading the [trier of fact] that [he] has been the
victim of intentional discrimination." Ibid.The District Court, acting as trier of fact in this bench

trial, found that the reasons petitioners gave were not thereal reasons for respondent's demotion and discharge. It
found that respondent was the only supervisor disciplinedfor violations committed by his subordinates; that similar
and even more serious violations committed by respondent'sco-workers were either disregarded or treated more leniently; and that Powell manufactured the final verbal confrontation in order to provoke respondent into threateninghim. 756 F. Supp., at 1250-1251. It nonetheless held that

respondent had failed to carry his ultimate burden of provingthat

his race was the determining factor in petitioners' decision first to demote and then to dismiss him.2 In short, theDistrict Court concluded that "although [respondent] has

proven the existence of a crusade to terminate him, he hasnot proven that the crusade was racially rather than personally motivated." Id., at 1252.The Court of Appeals set this determination aside on the
ground that "[o]nce [respondent] proved all of [petitioners']proffered reasons for the adverse employment actions to
be pretextual, [respondent] was entitled to judgment as a
matter of law." 970 F. 2d, at 492. The Court of Appeals
reasoned:

2 Various considerations led it to this conclusion, including the fact that
two blacks sat on the disciplinary review board that recommended disciplining respondent, that respondent's black subordinates who actually
committed the violations were not disciplined, and that "the number of
black employees at St. Mary's remained constant." 756 F. Supp., at
1252.

Opinion of the Court
"Because all of defendants' proffered reasons were discredited, defendants were in a position of having offered
no legitimate reason for their actions. In other words,
defendants were in no better position than if they had
remained silent, offering no rebuttal to an established
inference that they had unlawfully discriminated against
plaintiff on the basis of his race." Ibid.

That is not so. By producing evidence (whether ultimately
persuasive or not) of nondiscriminatory reasons, petitioners
sustained their burden of production, and thus placed themselves in a "better position than if they had remained silent."

In the nature of things, the determination that a defendant
has met its burden of production (and has thus rebutted any
legal presumption of intentional discrimination) can involve
no credibility assessment. For the burden-of-production determination necessarily precedes the credibility-assessment
stage. At the close of the defendant's case, the court is
asked to decide whether an issue of fact remains for the trier
of fact to determine. None does if, on the evidence presented, (1) any rational person would have to find the existence of facts constituting a prima facie case, and (2) the defendant has failed to meet its burden of production--i. e., has
failed to introduce evidence which, taken as true, would permit the conclusion that there was a nondiscriminatory reason
for the adverse action. In that event, the court must award
judgment to the plaintiff as a matter of law under Federal
Rule of Civil Procedure 50(a)(1) (in the case of jury trials) or
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(c) (in the case of bench
trials). See F. James & G. Hazard, Civil Procedure $ 7.9,
p. 327 (3d ed. 1985); 1 Louisell & Mueller, Federal Evidence

$ 70, at 568. If the defendant has failed to sustain its burden
but reasonable minds could differ as to whether a preponderance of the evidence establishes the facts of a prima facie

510 ST. MARY'S HONOR CENTER v. HICKS

Opinion of the Court
case, then a question of fact does remain, which the trier of
fact will be called upon to answer.3

If, on the other hand, the defendant has succeeded in
carrying its burden of production, the McDonnell Douglas
framework--with its presumptions and burdens--is no
longer relevant. To resurrect it later, after the trier of fact
has determined that what was "produced" to meet the
burden of production is not credible, flies in the face of our
holding in Burdine that to rebut the presumption "[t]he defendant need not persuade the court that it was actually
motivated by the proffered reasons." 450 U. S., at 254.
The presumption, having fulfilled its role of forcing the de3 If the finder of fact answers affirmatively--if it finds that the prima
facie case is supported by a preponderance of the evidence--it must find
the existence of the presumed fact of unlawful discrimination and must,
therefore, render a verdict for the plaintiff. See Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U. S. 248, 254, and n. 7 (1981); F. James & G.
Hazard, Civil Procedure $ 7.9, p. 327 (3d ed. 1985); 1 D. Louisell & C. Mueller, Federal Evidence $ 70, pp. 568-569 (1977). Thus, the effect of failing
to produce evidence to rebut the McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411
U. S. 792 (1973), presumption is not felt until the prima facie case has been
established, either as a matter of law (because the plaintiff's facts are
uncontested) or by the factfinder's determination that the plaintiff's facts
are supported by a preponderance of the evidence. It is thus technically
accurate to describe the sequence as we did in Burdine: "First, the plaintiff has the burden of proving by the preponderance of the evidence a
prima facie case of discrimination. Second, if the plaintiff succeeds in
proving the prima facie case, the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the employee's rejection." 450 U. S., at 252-253 (internal quotation marks omitted). As a
practical matter, however, and in the real-life sequence of a trial, the defendant feels the "burden" not when the plaintiff's prima facie case is
proved, but as soon as evidence of it is introduced. The defendant then
knows that its failure to introduce evidence of a nondiscriminatory reason
will cause judgment to go against it unless the plaintiff's prima facie case
is held to be inadequate in law or fails to convince the factfinder. It is
this practical coercion which causes the McDonnell Douglas presumption
to function as a means of "arranging the presentation of evidence," Watson v. Fort Worth Bank & Trust, 487 U. S. 977, 986 (1988).

Opinion of the Court
fendant to come forward with some response, simply drops
out of the picture. Id., at 255. The defendant's "production" (whatever its persuasive effect) having been made, the
trier of fact proceeds to decide the ultimate question:
whether plaintiff has proved "that the defendant intentionally discriminated against [him]" because of his race, id., at
253. The factfinder's disbelief of the reasons put forward by
the defendant (particularly if disbelief is accompanied by a
suspicion of mendacity) may, together with the elements of
the prima facie case, suffice to show intentional discrimination. Thus, rejection of the defendant's proffered reasons
will permit the trier of fact to infer the ultimate fact of intentional discrimination,4 and the Court of Appeals was correct
when it noted that, upon such rejection, "[n]o additional proof
of discrimination is required," 970 F. 2d, at 493 (emphasis
added). But the Court of Appeals' holding that rejection of
the defendant's proffered reasons compels judgment for the
plaintiff disregards the fundamental principle of Rule 301
that a presumption does not shift the burden of proof, and
ignores our repeated admonition that the Title VII plaintiff
at all times bears the "ultimate burden of persuasion." See,
e. g., Postal Service Bd. of Governors v. Aikens, 460 U. S.
711, 716 (1983) (citing Burdine, supra, at 256); Patterson v.
McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 187 (1989); Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U. S. 228, 245-246 (1989) (plurality
opinion of Brennan, J., joined by Marshall, Blackmun, and
Stevens, JJ.); id., at 260 (White, J., concurring in judgment); id., at 270 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment);

4 Contrary to the dissent's confusion-producing analysis, post, at 535-
536, there is nothing whatever inconsistent between this statement and
our later statements that (1) the plaintiff must show "both that the reason
was false, and that discrimination was the real reason," infra, at 515, and
(2) "it is not enough . . . to disbelieve the employer," infra, at 519. Even
though (as we say here) rejection of the defendant's proffered reasons is
enough at law to sustain a finding of discrimination, there must be a finding of discrimination.

answer the dissent's accusations in detail, by examining ourcases, but at the outset it is worth noting the utter implausibility that we would ever have held what the dissent says
we held.

As we have described, Title VII renders it unlawful "for
an employer . . . to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any
individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or
privileges of employment, because of such individual's race,
color, religion, sex, or national origin." 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-
2(a)(1). Here (in the context of the now-permissible jury
trials for Title VII causes of action) is what the dissent asserts we have held to be a proper assessment of liability for
violation of this law: Assume that 40% of a business' work
force are members of a particular minority group, a group
which comprises only 10% of the relevant labor market. An
applicant, who is a member of that group, applies for an
opening for which he is minimally qualified, but is rejected
by a hiring officer of that same minority group, and the
search to fill the opening continues. The rejected applicant
files suit for racial discrimination under Title VII, and before
the suit comes to trial, the supervisor who conducted the
company's hiring is fired. Under McDonnell Douglas, the
plaintiff has a prima facie case, see 411 U. S., at 802, and
under the dissent's interpretation of our law not only must
the company come forward with some explanation for the
refusal to hire (which it will have to try to confirm out of the

Opinion of the Court
mouth of its now antagonistic former employee), but the jurymust be instructed that, if they find that explanation to be

incorrect, they must assess damages against the company,
whether or not they believe the company was guilty of racial
discrimination. The disproportionate minority makeup of
the company's work force and the fact that its hiring officerwas of the same minority group as the plaintiff will be irrelevant, because the plaintiff 's case can be proved "indirectlyby showing that the employer's proffered explanation is unworthy of credence." 5 450 U. S., at 256. Surely nothingshort of inescapable prior

holdings (the dissent does not pretend there are any) should make one assume that this is thelaw we have created.

We have no authority to impose liability upon an employerfor alleged discriminatory employment practices unless an
appropriate factfinder determines, according to proper procedures, that the employer has unlawfully discriminated.
We may, according to traditional practice, establish certain
modes and orders of proof, including an initial rebuttable
presumption of the sort we described earlier in this opinion,
which we believe McDonnell Douglas represents. But
nothing in law would permit us to substitute for the required
finding that the employer's action was the product of unlawful discrimination, the much different (and much lesser) find5 The dissent has no response to this (not at all unrealistic) hypothetical,
except to assert that surely the employer must have "personnel records"
to which it can resort to demonstrate the reason for the failure to hire.
The notion that every reasonable employer keeps "personnel records" on
people who never became personnel, showing why they did not become
personnel (i. e., in what respects all other people who were hired were
better) seems to us highly fanciful--or for the sake of American business
we hope it is. But more fundamentally, the dissent's response misses the
point. Even if such "personnel records" do exist, it is a mockery of justice
to say that if the jury believes the reason they set forth is probably not
the "true" one, all the other utterly compelling evidence that discrimination was not the reason will then be excluded from the jury's
consideration.

ing that the employer's explanation of its action was not be-lievable. The dissent's position amounts to precisely this,

unless what is required to establish the McDonnell Douglasprima facie case is a degree of proof so high that it would, in
absence of rebuttal, require a directed verdict for the plaintiff (for in that case proving the employer's rebuttal noncred-ible would leave the plaintiff 's directed-verdict case in place,

and compel a judgment in his favor). Quite obviously, how-ever, what is required to establish the

McDonnell Douglas
prima facie case is infinitely less than what a directed verdictdemands. The dissent is thus left with a position that has

no support in the statute, no support in the reason of the
matter, no support in any holding of this Court (that is not
even contended), and support, if at all, only in the dicta of
this Court's opinions. It is to those that we now turn--begrudgingly, since we think it generally undesirable, where
holdings of the Court are not at issue, to dissect the sentences of the United States Reports as though they were the
United States Code.

The principal case on which the dissent relies is Burdine.
While there are some statements in that opinion that could
be read to support the dissent's position, all but one of them
bear a meaning consistent with our interpretation, and the
one exception is simply incompatible with other language in
the case. Burdine describes the situation that obtains after
the employer has met its burden of adducing a nondiscriminatory reason as follows: "Third, should the defendant carry
this burden, the plaintiff must then have an opportunity to
prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the legitimate
reasons offered by the defendant were not its true reasons,
but were a pretext for discrimination." 450 U. S., at 253.
The dissent takes this to mean that if the plaintiff proves the
asserted reason to be false, the plaintiff wins. But a reason
cannot be proved to be "a pretext for discrimination" unless
it is shown both that the reason was false, and that discrimination was the real reason. Burdine's later allusions to

516 ST. MARY'S HONOR CENTER v. HICKS

Opinion of the Court
proving or demonstrating simply "pretext," e. g., id., at 258,are reasonably understood to refer to the previously described pretext, i. e., "pretext for discrimination." 6Burdine also says that when the employer has met its burden of production "the factual inquiry proceeds to a newlevel of specificity."

Id., at 255. The dissent takes this tomean that the factual inquiry reduces to whether the employer's asserted reason is true or false--if false, the defend-ant loses. But the "new level of specificity" may also (as we
believe) refer to the fact that the inquiry now turns from thefew generalized factors that establish a prima facie case to
the specific proofs and rebuttals of discriminatory motivationthe parties have introduced.

In the next sentence, Burdine says that "[p]lacing this burden of production on the defendant thus serves . . . to framethe factual issue with sufficient clarity so that the plaintiff

will have a full and fair opportunity to demonstrate pretext."
Id., at 255-256. The dissent thinks this means that the only
factual issue remaining in the case is whether the employer'sreason is false. But since in our view "pretext" means "pretext for discrimination," we think the sentence must be un-derstood as addressing the form rather than the substance
of the defendant's production burden: The requirement that
the employer "clearly set forth" its reasons, id., at 255, givesthe plaintiff a "full and fair" rebuttal opportunity.

A few sentences later, Burdine says: "[The plaintiff] nowmust have the opportunity to demonstrate that the proffered
reason was not the true reason for the employment decision.This burden now merges with the ultimate burden of
persuading the court that she has been the victim of inten6 The same is true of McDonnell Douglas's concluding summary of the
framework it created (relied upon by the dissent, post, at 530) to the effect
that if the plaintiff fails to show "pretext," the challenged employment
action "must stand." 411 U. S., at 807. There, as in Burdine, "pretext"
means the pretext required earlier in the opinion, viz., "pretext for the
sort of discrimination prohibited by [Title VII]," 411 U. S., at 804.

Opinion of the Court
tional discrimination." Id., at 256. The dissent takes this"merger" to mean that "the ultimate burden of persuading

the court that she has been the victim of intentional discrimi-nation" is

replaced by the mere burden of "demonstrat[ing]
that the proffered reason was not the true reason for the
employment decision." But that would be a merger inwhich the little fish swallows the big one. Surely a more

reasonable reading is that proving the employer's reasonfalse becomes part of (and often considerably assists) the
greater enterprise of proving that the real reason was inten-tional discrimination.

Finally, in the next sentence Burdine says: "[The plaintiff]
may succeed in this [i. e., in persuading the court that she
has been the victim of intentional discrimination] either directly by persuading the court that a discriminatory reason
more likely motivated the employer or indirectly by showing
that the employer's proffered explanation is unworthy of
credence. See McDonnell Douglas, 411 U. S., at 804-805."
Ibid. We must agree with the dissent on this one: The
words bear no other meaning but that the falsity of the employer's explanation is alone enough to compel judgment for
the plaintiff. The problem is that that dictum contradicts
or renders inexplicable numerous other statements, both in
Burdine itself and in our later case law--commencing with
the very citation of authority Burdine uses to support the
proposition. McDonnell Douglas does not say, at the cited
pages or elsewhere, that all the plaintiff need do is disprove
the employer's asserted reason. In fact, it says just the opposite: "[O]n the retrial respondent must be given a full and
fair opportunity to demonstrate by competent evidence that
the presumptively valid reasons for his rejection were in

fact a coverup for a racially discriminatory decision." 411
U. S., at 805 (emphasis added). "We . . . insist that respondent under $ 703(a)(1) must be given a full and fair opportunity to demonstrate by competent evidence that whatever the
stated reasons for his rejection, the decision was in reality

Opinion of the Court
racially premised." Id., at 805, n. 18 (emphasis added).The statement in question also contradicts Burdine's repeated assurance (indeed, its holding) regarding the burdenof persuasion: "The ultimate burden of persuading the trier
of fact that the defendant intentionally discriminated againstthe plaintiff remains at all times with the plaintiff." 450
U. S., at 253. "The plaintiff retains the burden of persua-sion."

Id., at 256.7 And lastly, the statement renders inex-plicable Burdine's explicit reliance, in describing the shifting

burdens of McDonnell Douglas, upon authorities settingforth the classic law of presumptions we have described earlier, including Wigmore's Evidence, 450 U. S., at 253, 254,n. 7, 255, n. 8, James' and Hazard's Civil Procedure, id., at
255, n. 8, Federal Rule of Evidence 301, ibid., Maguire's Evi-dence, Common Sense and Common Law,

ibid., and Thayer'sPreliminary Treatise on Evidence, id., at 255, n. 10. In light

of these inconsistencies, we think that the dictum at issuehere must be regarded as an inadvertence, to the extent that
it describes disproof of the defendant's reason as a totallyindependent, rather than an auxiliary, means of proving unlawful intent.In sum, our interpretation of

Burdine creates difficultywith one sentence; the dissent's interpretation causes many

portions of the opinion to be incomprehensible or deceptive.But whatever doubt Burdine might have created was eliminated by Aikens. There we said, in language that cannotreasonably be mistaken, that "the ultimate question [is] discrimination vel non." 460 U. S., at 714. Once the defend7 The dissent's reading leaves some burden of persuasion on the plaintiff,
to be sure: the burden of persuading the factfinder that the employer's
explanation is not true. But it would be beneath contempt for this Court,
in a unanimous opinion no less, to play such word games with the concept
of "leaving the burden of persuasion upon the plaintiff." By parity of
analysis, it could be said that holding a criminal defendant guilty unless
he comes forward with a credible alibi does not shift the ultimate burden
of persuasion, so long as the Government has the burden of persuading
the factfinder that the alibi is not credible.

ant "responds to the plaintiff 's proof by offering evidence ofthe reason for the plaintiff 's rejection, the factfinder must

then decide" not (as the dissent would have it) whether thatevidence is credible, but "whether the rejection was discriminatory within the meaning of Title VII." Id., at 714-715.
At that stage, we said, "[t]he District Court was . . . in aposition to decide the ultimate factual issue in the case,"

which is "whether the defendant intentionally discriminatedagainst the plaintiff."

Id., at 715 (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted). The McDonnell Douglas methodol-ogy was " `never intended to be rigid, mechanized, or ritualistic.' " 460 U. S., at 715 (quoting Furnco, 438 U. S., at 577).
Rather, once the defendant has responded to the plaintiff 's
prima facie case, "[t]he district court has before it all the
evidence it needs to decide" not (as the dissent would have
it) whether defendant's response is credible, but "whether
the defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff." 460 U. S., at 715 (internal quotation marks omitted).
"On the state of the record at the close of the evidence, the
District Court in this case should have proceeded to this specific question directly, just as district courts decide disputed
questions of fact in other civil litigation." Id., at 715-716.
In confirmation of this (rather than in contradiction of it),
the Court then quotes the problematic passage from Burdine, which says that the plaintiff may carry her burden
either directly " `or indirectly by showing that the employer's
proffered explanation is unworthy of credence.' " 460 U. S.,
at 716. It then characterizes that passage as follows: "In
short, the district court must decide which party's explanation of the employer's motivation it believes." Ibid. It
is not enough, in other words, to disbelieve the employer;
the factfinder must believe the plaintiff 's explanation of
intentional discrimination. It is noteworthy that Justice
Blackmun, although joining the Court's opinion in Aikens,
wrote a separate concurrence for the sole purpose of saying
that he understood the Court's opinion to be saying what the

dissent today asserts. That concurrence was joined only byJustice Brennan. Justice Marshall would have none of that,

but simply refused to join the Court's opinion, concurringwithout opinion in the judgment. We think there is little
doubt what Aikens meant.

IV
We turn, finally, to the dire practical consequences that therespondents and the dissent claim our decision today will

produce. What appears to trouble the dissent more thananything is that, in its view, our rule is adopted "for the
benefit of employers who have been found to have given falseevidence in a court of law," whom we "favo[r]" by "exempting
them from responsibility for lies." Post, at 537. As weshall explain, our rule in no way gives special favor to those
employers whose evidence is disbelieved. But initially wemust point out that there is no justification for assuming (as
the dissent repeatedly does) that those employers whoseevidence is disbelieved are perjurers and liars. See

ante,at 536-537 ("the employer who lies"; "the employer's lie";

"found to have given false evidence"; "lies"); post, at 540("benefit from lying"; "must lie"; "offering false evidence"),
540, n. 13 ("employer who lies"; "employer caught in a lie";"rewarded for its falsehoods"), 540 ("requires a party to lie").
Even if these were typically cases in which an individualdefendant's sworn assertion regarding a physical occurrence
was pitted against an individual plaintiff 's sworn assertionregarding the same physical occurrence, surely it would be
imprudent to call the party whose assertion is (by a merepreponderance of the evidence) disbelieved, a perjurer and
a liar. And in these Title VII cases, the defendant is ordi-narily not an individual but a company, which must rely upon
the statement of an employee--often a relatively low-levelemployee--as to the central fact; and that central fact is not
a physical occurrence, but rather that employee's stateof mind. To say that the company which in good faith

521Cite as: 509 U. S. 502 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
introduces such testimony, or even the testifying employeehimself, becomes a liar and a perjurer when the testimony

is not believed, is nothing short of absurd.Undoubtedly some employers (or at least their employees)
will be lying. But even if we could readily identify these
perjurers, what an extraordinary notion, that we "exemptthem from responsibility for their lies" unless we enter Title

VII judgments for the plaintiffs! Title VII is not a cause ofaction for perjury; we have other civil and criminal remedies
for that. The dissent's notion of judgment-for-lying is seento be not even a fair and evenhanded punishment for vice,
when one realizes how strangely selective it is: The employer
is free to lie to its heart's content about whether the plaintiff
ever applied for a job, about how long he worked, how much
he made--indeed, about anything and everything except the
reason for the adverse employment action. And the plaintiff is permitted to lie about absolutely everything without
losing a verdict he otherwise deserves. This is not a major,
or even a sensible, blow against fibbery.

The respondent's argument based upon the employer's
supposed lying is a more modest one: "A defendant which
unsuccessfully offers a `phony reason' logically cannot be in
a better legal position [i. e., the position of having overcome
the presumption from the plaintiff 's prima facie case] than a
defendant who remains silent, and offers no reasons at all
for its conduct." Brief for Respondent 21; see also Brief for
United States as Amicus Curiae 11, 17-18. But there is no
anomaly in that, once one recognizes that the McDonnell
Douglas presumption is a procedural device, designed only
to establish an order of proof and production. The books
are full of procedural rules that place the perjurer (initially,
at least) in a better position than the truthful litigant who
makes no response at all. A defendant who fails to answer
a complaint will, on motion, suffer a default judgment that a
deceitful response could have avoided. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.
55(a). A defendant whose answer fails to contest critical

522 ST. MARY'S HONOR CENTER v. HICKS

Opinion of the Court
averments in the complaint will, on motion, suffer a judgment on the pleadings that untruthful denials could have
avoided. Rule 12(c). And a defendant who fails to submit
affidavits creating a genuine issue of fact in response to a
motion for summary judgment will suffer a dismissal that
false affidavits could have avoided. Rule 56(e). In all of
those cases, as under the McDonnell Douglas framework,
perjury may purchase the defendant a chance at the factfinder--though there, as here, it also carries substantial
risks, see Rules 11 and 56(g); 18 U. S. C. $ 1621.

The dissent repeatedly raises a procedural objection that
is impressive only to one who mistakes the basic nature of
the McDonnell Douglas procedure. It asserts that "the
Court now holds that the further enquiry [i. e., the inquiry
that follows the employer's response to the prima facie case]
is wide open, not limited at all by the scope of the employer's
proffered explanation." Post, at 533. The plaintiff cannot
be expected to refute "reasons not articulated by the employer, but discerned in the record by the factfinder." Ante,
at 534. He should not "be saddled with the tremendous
disadvantage of having to confront, not the defined task of
proving the employer's stated reasons to be false, but the
amorphous requirement of disproving all possible nondiscriminatory reasons that a factfinder might find lurking

in the record." Post, at 534-535. "Under the scheme announced today, any conceivable explanation for the employer's actions that might be suggested by the evidence, however unrelated to the employer's articulated reasons, must
be addressed by [the] plaintiff." Post, at 537. These statements imply that the employer's "proffered explanation," his
"stated reasons," his "articulated reasons," somehow exist
apart from the record--in some pleading, or perhaps in
some formal, nontestimonial statement made on behalf of
the defendant to the factfinder. ("Your honor, pursuant to
McDonnell Douglas the defendant hereby formally asserts,

523Cite as: 509 U. S. 502 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
as its reason for the dismissal at issue here, incompetence of
the employee.") Of course it does not work like that. The
reasons the defendant sets forth are set forth "through the
introduction of admissible evidence." Burdine, 450 U. S., at
255. In other words, the defendant's "articulated reasons"
themselves are to be found "lurking in the record." It thus
makes no sense to contemplate "the employer who is caught
in a lie, but succeeds in injecting into the trial an unarticulated reason for its actions." Post, at 540, n. 13 (emphasis
added). There is a "lurking-in-the-record" problem, but it
exists not for us but for the dissent. If, after the employer
has met its preliminary burden, the plaintiff need not prove
discrimination (and therefore need not disprove all other
reasons suggested, no matter how vaguely, in the record)
there must be some device for determining which particular
portions of the record represent "articulated reasons" set
forth with sufficient clarity to satisfy McDonnell Douglas--
since it is only that evidence which the plaintiff must refute.
But of course our McDonnell Douglas framework makes no
provision for such a determination, which would have to be
made not at the close of the trial but in medias res, since
otherwise the plaintiff would not know what evidence to
offer. It makes no sense.

Respondent contends that "[t]he litigation decision of the
employer to place in controversy only . . . particular explanations eliminates from further consideration the alternative
explanations that the employer chose not to advance."
Brief for Respondent 15. The employer should bear, he contends, "the responsibility for its choices and the risk that
plaintiff will disprove any pretextual reasons and therefore
prevail." Id., at 30 (emphasis added). It is the "therefore"
that is problematic. Title VII does not award damages
against employers who cannot prove a nondiscriminatory
reason for adverse employment action, but only against employers who are proven to have taken adverse employment

Opinion of the Court
action by reason of (in the context of the present case) race.That the employer's proffered reason is unpersuasive, or

even obviously contrived, does not necessarily establish thatthe plaintiff 's proffered reason of race is correct. That remains a question for the factfinder to answer, subject, ofcourse, to appellate review--which should be conducted on
remand in this case under the "clearly erroneous" standardof Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a), see,

e. g., Andersonv. Bessemer City, 470 U. S. 564, 573-576 (1985).

Finally, respondent argues that it "would be particularlyill-advised" for us to come forth with the holding we pronounce today "just as Congress has provided a right to jurytrials in Title VII" cases. Brief for Respondent 31. See

$ 102 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, 105 Stat. 1073, 42U. S. C. $ 1981a(c) (1988 ed., Supp. III) (providing jury trial
right in certain Title VII suits). We think quite the oppo-site is true. Clarity regarding the requisite elements of
proof becomes all the more important when a jury must beinstructed concerning them, and when detailed factual findings by the trial court will not be available upon review.

* * *We reaffirm today what we said in Aikens:

"[T]he question facing triers of fact in discriminationcases is both sensitive and difficult. The prohibitions
against discrimination contained in the Civil Rights Actof 1964 reflect an important national policy. There will
seldom be `eyewitness' testimony as to the employer'smental processes. But none of this means that trial
courts or reviewing courts should treat discriminationdifferently from other ultimate questions of fact. Nor
should they make their inquiry even more difficult byapplying legal rules which were devised to govern `the
basic allocation of burdens and order of presentation ofproof,'

It is so ordered.

Justice Souter, with whom Justice White, Justice
Blackmun, and Justice Stevens join, dissenting.

Twenty years ago, in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,411 U. S. 792 (1973), this Court unanimously prescribed a

"sensible, orderly way to evaluate the evidence" in a TitleVII disparate-treatment case, giving both plaintiff and
defendant fair opportunities to litigate "in light of commonexperience as it bears on the critical question of discrimination." Furnco Constr. Corp. v. Waters, 438 U. S. 567, 577(1978). We have repeatedly reaffirmed and refined the

McDonnell Douglas framework, most notably in Texas Dept. of
Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U. S. 248 (1981), another
unanimous opinion. See also Postal Service Bd. of Governors v. Aikens, 460 U. S. 711 (1983); Furnco, supra. But
today, after two decades of stable law in this Court and only
relatively recent disruption in some of the Circuits, see ante,
at 512-513, the Court abandons this practical framework together with its central purpose, which is "to sharpen the
inquiry into the elusive factual question of intentional discrimination," Burdine, supra, at 255, n. 8. Ignoring language to the contrary in both McDonnell Douglas and Burdine, the Court holds that, once a Title VII plaintiff succeeds
in showing at trial that the defendant has come forward with
pretextual reasons for its actions in response to a prima facie
showing of discrimination, the factfinder still may proceed
to roam the record, searching for some nondiscriminatory
explanation that the defendant has not raised and that the
plaintiff has had no fair opportunity to disprove. Because
the majority departs from settled precedent in substituting
a scheme of proof for disparate-treatment actions that promises to be unfair and unworkable, I respectfully dissent.

526 ST. MARY'S HONOR CENTER v. HICKS

Souter, J., dissenting
The McDonnell Douglas framework that the Court in-explicably casts aside today was summarized neatly in

Burdine:

"First, the plaintiff has the burden of proving by the
preponderance of the evidence a prima facie case of dis-crimination. Second, if the plaintiff succeeds in proving

the prima facie case, the burden shifts to the defendantto articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason
for the employee's rejection. Third, should the defend-ant carry this burden, the plaintiff must then have an
opportunity to prove by a preponderance of the evidence
that the legitimate reasons offered by the defendantwere not its true reasons, but were a pretext for

discrimination." 450 U. S., at 252-253 (citations andinternal quotation marks omitted).

We adopted this three-step process to implement, in an or-derly fashion, "[t]he language of Title VII," which "makes
plain the purpose of Congress to assure equality of employ-ment opportunities and to eliminate those discriminatory
practices and devices which have fostered racially stratifiedjob environments to the disadvantage of minority citizens."
411 U. S., at 800. Because "Title VII tolerates no racial dis-crimination, subtle or otherwise,"

id., at 801, we devised a
framework that would allow both plaintiffs and the courts to
deal effectively with employment discrimination revealedonly through circumstantial evidence. See

Aikens, supra,
at 716 ("There will seldom be `eyewitness' testimony as tothe employer's mental processes"). This framework has

gained wide acceptance, not only in cases alleging discrimination on the basis of "race, color, religion, sex, or national
origin" under Title VII, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-2, but also in similar cases, such as those alleging age discrimination under
the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967. See,
e. g., Halsell v. Kimberly-Clark Corp., 683 F. 2d 285, 289
(CA8 1982), cert. denied, 459 U. S. 1205 (1983); see also Brief

Curiae 3-4.

At the outset, under the McDonnell Douglas framework,a plaintiff alleging disparate treatment in the workplace in

violation of Title VII must provide the basis for an inference
of discrimination. In this case, as all agree, Melvin Hicksmet this initial burden by proving by a preponderance of

the evidence that he was black and therefore a member of aprotected class; he was qualified to be a shift commander; he
was demoted and then terminated; and his position remainedavailable and was later filled by a qualified applicant.

1 See

970 F. 2d 487, 491, and n. 7 (CA8 1992). Hicks thus provedwhat we have called a "prima facie case" of discrimination,

and it is important to note that in this context a prima faciecase is indeed a proven case. Although, in other contexts, a
prima facie case only requires production of enough evidenceto raise an issue for the trier of fact, here it means that the
plaintiff has actually established the elements of the prima
facie case to the satisfaction of the factfinder by a preponderance of the evidence. See Burdine, 450 U. S., at 253, 254,
n. 7. By doing so, Hicks "eliminat[ed] the most common
nondiscriminatory reasons" for demotion and firing: that he
was unqualified for the position or that the position was no
longer available. Id., at 254. Given our assumption that
"people do not act in a totally arbitrary manner, without any
underlying reasons, especially in a business setting," we
have explained that a prima facie case implies discrimination
"because we presume [the employer's] acts, if otherwise unexplained, are more likely than not based on the consider1 The majority, following the courts below, mentions that Hicks's position
was filled by a white male. Ante, at 506 (citing the District Court's opinion); see 970 F. 2d 487, 491, n. 7 (CA8 1992). This Court has not directly
addressed the question whether the personal characteristics of someone
chosen to replace a Title VII plaintiff are material, and that issue is not
before us today. Cf. Cumpiano v. Banco Santander Puerto Rico, 902
F. 2d 148, 154-155 (CA1 1990) (identity of replacement is not relevant).

ation of impermissible factors." Furnco, 438 U. S., at 577;see also

Burdine, supra, at 254.
Under McDonnell Douglas and Burdine, however, proofof a prima facie case not only raises an inference of discrimination; in the absence of further evidence, it also creates a
mandatory presumption in favor of the plaintiff. 450 U. S.,at 254, n. 7. Although the employer bears no trial burden

at all until the plaintiff proves his prima facie case, once theplaintiff does so the employer must either respond or lose.
As we made clear in Burdine, "[I]f the employer is silent inthe face of the presumption, the court must enter judgment
for the plaintiff." Id., at 254; see ante, at 510, n. 3 (in these
circumstances, the factfinder "must find the existence of the
presumed fact of unlawful discrimination and must, therefore, render a verdict for the plaintiff ") (emphasis in original). Thus, if the employer remains silent because it acted
for a reason it is too embarrassed to reveal, or for a reason
it fails to discover, see ante, at 513, the plaintiff is entitled
to judgment under Burdine.

Obviously, it would be unfair to bar an employer from coming forward at this stage with a nondiscriminatory explanation for its actions, since the lack of an open position and
the plaintiff 's lack of qualifications do not exhaust the set
of nondiscriminatory reasons that might explain an adverse
personnel decision. If the trier of fact could not consider
other explanations, employers' autonomy would be curtailed
far beyond what is needed to rectify the discrimination identified by Congress. Cf. Furnco, supra, at 577-578 (Title VII
"does not impose a duty to adopt a hiring procedure that
maximizes hiring of minority employees"). On the other
hand, it would be equally unfair and utterly impractical to
saddle the victims of discrimination with the burden of either
producing direct evidence of discriminatory intent or eliminating the entire universe of possible nondiscriminatory reasons for a personnel decision. The Court in McDonnell
Douglas reconciled these competing interests in a very sen509us2u112 05-04-97 18:36:56 PAGES OPINPGT

sible way by requiring the employer to "articulate," throughthe introduction of admissible evidence, one or more "legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason[s]" for its actions. 411 U. S.,at 802; Burdine, supra, at 254-255. Proof of a prima facie
case thus serves as a catalyst obligating the employer to stepforward with an explanation for its actions. St. Mary's, in
this case, used this opportunity to provide two reasons forits treatment of Hicks: the severity and accumulation of rule
infractions he had allegedly committed. 970 F. 2d, at 491.The Court emphasizes that the employer's obligation at
this stage is only a burden of production, ante, at 506-507,509; see 450 U. S., at 254-255, and that, if the employer meets
the burden, the presumption entitling the plaintiff to judg-ment "drops from the case," id., at 255, n. 10; see ante, at
507. This much is certainly true,2 but the obligation alsoserves an important function neglected by the majority, in
requiring the employer "to frame the factual issue with suf-ficient clarity so that the plaintiff will have a full and fair
opportunity to demonstrate pretext." 450 U. S., at 255-256.The employer, in other words, has a "burden of production"
that gives it the right to choose the scope of the factualissues to be resolved by the factfinder. But investing the
employer with this choice has no point unless the scopeit chooses binds the employer as well as the plaintiff. Nor
does it make sense to tell the employer, as this Court hasdone, that its explanation of legitimate reasons "must be
clear and reasonably specific," if the factfinder can rely on areason not clearly articulated, or on one not articulated at

Burdine" to "resurrect" this mandatory presumption at a later stage, in
cases where the plaintiff proves that the employer's proffered reasons are
pretextual. Ante, at 510. Hicks does not argue to the contrary. See
Brief for Respondent 20, n. 4 (citing Fed. Rule Evid. 301). The question
presented in this case is not whether the mandatory presumption is resurrected (everyone agrees that it is not), but whether the factual enquiry

is narrowed by the McDonnell Douglas framework to the question of
pretext.

all, to rule in favor of the employer.3 Id., at 258; see id., at255, n. 9 ("An articulation not admitted into evidence will

not suffice").Once the employer chooses the battleground in this manner, "the factual inquiry proceeds to a new level of specific-ity."

Id., at 255. During this final, more specific enquiry,the employer has no burden to prove that its proffered reasons are true; rather, the plaintiff must prove by a prepon-derance of the evidence that the proffered reasons are pretextual.4 Id., at 256. McDonnell Douglas makes it clearthat if the plaintiff fails to show "pretext," the challenged

employment action "must stand." 411 U. S., at 807. If, onthe other hand, the plaintiff carries his burden of showing
"pretext," the court "must order a prompt and appropriateremedy."

3 The majority is simply wrong when it suggests that my reading of
McDonnell Douglas and Burdine proceeds on the assumption that the
employer's reasons must be stated "apart from the record." Ante, at 522
(emphasis omitted). As I mentioned above, and I repeat here, such reasons must be set forth "through the introduction of admissible evidence."
Supra, at 529; see Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450
U. S. 248, 255 (1981). Such reasons cannot simply be found "lurking in
the record," as the Court suggests, ante, at 523, for Burdine requires the
employer to articulate its reasons through testimony or other admissible
evidence that is "clear and reasonably specific," 450 U. S., at 258. Accordingly, the plaintiff need not worry about waiting for the court to identify
the employer's reasons at the end of trial, or in this case six months after
trial, because McDonnell Douglas and Burdine require the employer to
articulate its reasons clearly during trial. No one, for example, had any
trouble in this case identifying the two reasons for Hicks's dismissal that
St. Mary's articulated during trial.

4 We clarified this aspect of the McDonnell Douglas framework in Burdine, where the question presented was "whether, after the plaintiff has
proved a prima facie case of discriminatory treatment, the burden shifts
to the defendant to persuade the court by a preponderance of the evidence
that legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for the challenged employment
action existed." 450 U. S., at 250.

5 The Court makes a halfhearted attempt to rewrite these passages from

McDonnell Douglas, arguing that "pretext for discrimination" should appear where "pretext" actually does. Ante, at 516, and n. 6. I seriously

now must have the opportunity to demonstrate that the prof-fered reason was not the true reason for the employment

decision. This burden now merges with the ultimate bur-den of persuading the court that [the plaintiff] has been the
victim of intentional discrimination." 6 450 U. S., at 256.Burdine drives home the point that the case has proceeded
to "a new level of specificity" by explaining that the plaintiffcan meet his burden of persuasion in either of two ways:
"either directly by persuading the court that a discrimina-tory reason more likely motivated the employer or indirectly
by showing that the employer's proffered explanation is un-worthy of credence."

doubt that such a change in diction would have altered the meaning of
these crucial passages in the manner the majority suggests, see n. 7, infra,
but even on the majority's assumption that there is a crucial difference, it
must believe that the McDonnell Douglas Court was rather sloppy in
summarizing its own opinion. Earlier in the McDonnell Douglas opinion,
the Court does state that an employer may not use a plaintiff's conduct
"as a pretext for . . . discrimination." 411 U. S., at 804; see ante, at 516,
n. 6 (quoting this sentence to justify rewriting the McDonnell Douglas
summary). But in the next sentence, when the McDonnell Douglas
Court's focus shifts from what the employer may not do to what the plaintiff must show, the Court states that the plaintiff must "be afforded a fair
opportunity to show that [the employer's] stated reason for [the plaintiff's]
rejection was in fact pretext," plain and simple. 411 U. S., at 804. To
the extent choosing between "pretext" and "pretext for discrimination" is
important, the McDonnell Douglas Court's diction appears to be consistent, not sloppy. Burdine, of course, nails down the point that the plaintiff
satisfies his burden simply by proving that the employer's explanation
does not deserve credence. See infra this page.

6 The majority puts forward what it calls "a more reasonable reading"

of this passage, ante, at 517, but its chosen interpretation of the "merger"
that occurs is flatly contradicted by the very next sentence in Burdine,
which indicates, as the majority subsequently admits, ante, at 517, that
the burden of persuasion is limited to the question of pretext. It seems
to me "more reasonable" to interpret the "merger" language in harmony
with, rather than in contradiction to, its immediate context in Burdine.

7 The majority's effort to rewrite Burdine centers on repudiating this

passage, see ante, at 517-520, which has provided specific, concrete guidance to courts and Title VII litigants for more than a decade, and on replacing "pretext" wherever it appears with "pretext for discrimination,"

(Blackmun, J., joined by Brennan, J., concurring); see also
Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U. S. 228, 287-289 (1989)
(Kennedy, J., dissenting) (discussing these "two alternative
methods" and relying on Justice Blackmun's concurrence
in Aikens). That the plaintiff can succeed simply by showing that "the employer's proffered explanation is unworthy
of credence" indicates that the case has been narrowed to
the question whether the employer's proffered reasons are
pretextual.8 Thus, because Hicks carried his burden of persuasion by showing that St. Mary's proffered reasons were

as defined by the majority, see ante, at 515-516. These two efforts are
intertwined, for Burdine tells us specifically how a plaintiff can prove
either "pretext" or "pretext for discrimination": "either directly by persuading the court that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the
employer or indirectly by showing that the employer's proffered explanation is unworthy of credence." 450 U. S., at 256 (emphasis added). The
majority's chosen method of proving "pretext for discrimination" changes
Burdine's "either . . . or" into a "both . . . and": "[A] reason cannot be
proved to be `a pretext for discrimination' unless it is shown both that the
reason was false, and that discrimination was the real reason." Ante, at
515 (emphasis deleted). The majority thus takes a shorthand phrase from
Burdine ("pretext for discrimination"), discovers requirements in the
phrase that are directly at odds with the specific requirements actually
set out in Burdine, and then rewrites Burdine in light of this "discovery."
No one "[f]amiliar with our case law," ante, at 512, will be persuaded by
this strategy.

8 That the sole, and therefore determinative, issue left at this stage is

pretext is further indicated by our discussion in McDonnell Douglas of
the various types of evidence "that may be relevant to any showing of
pretext," 411 U. S., at 804, by our decision to reverse in Furnco Constr.
Corp. v. Waters, 438 U. S. 567 (1978), because the Court of Appeals "did
not conclude that the [challenged] practices were a pretext for discrimination," id., at 578, and by our reminder in Burdine that even after the
employer meets the plaintiff's prima facie case, the "evidence previously
introduced by the plaintiff to establish a prima facie case" and the "inferences properly drawn therefrom may be considered by the trier of fact on
the issue of whether the [employer's] explanation is pretextual," 450 U. S.,

"unworthy of credence," the Court of Appeals properly con-cluded that he was entitled to judgment.

9 970 F. 2d, at 492.

The Court today decides to abandon the settled law thatsets out this structure for trying disparate-treatment Title

VII cases, only to adopt a scheme that will be unfair to plaintiffs, unworkable in practice, and inexplicable in forgivingemployers who present false evidence in court. Under the

majority's scheme, once the employer succeeds in meeting itsburden of production, "the

McDonnell Douglas framework
. . . is no longer relevant." Ante, at 510. Whereas we saidin

Burdine that if the employer carries its burden of production, "the factual inquiry proceeds to a new level of specific-ity," 450 U. S., at 255, the Court now holds that the further

enquiry is wide open, not limited at all by the scope of the
employer's proffered explanation.10 Despite the Court's as-siduous effort to reinterpret our precedents, it remains clear

that today's decision stems from a flat misreading of Burdine
and ignores the central purpose of the McDonnell Douglas
framework, which is "progressively to sharpen the inquiry

9 The foregoing analysis of burdens describes who wins on various combinations of evidence and proof. It may or may not also describe the
actual sequence of events at trial. In a bench trial, for example, the parties may be limited in their presentation of evidence until the court has
decided whether the plaintiff has made his prima facie showing. But the
court also may allow in all the evidence at once. In such a situation,
under our decision in Aikens, the defendant will have to choose whether
it wishes simply to attack the prima facie case or whether it wants to
present nondiscriminatory reasons for its actions. If the defendant
chooses the former approach, the factfinder will decide at the end of the
trial whether the plaintiff has proven his prima facie case. If the defendant takes the latter approach, the only question for the factfinder will be
the issue of pretext. Postal Service Bd. of Governors v. Aikens, 460 U. S.
711, 715 (1983); see ante, at 510, n. 3.

10 Under the Court's unlikely interpretation of the "new level of specificity" called for by Burdine (and repeated in Aikens, see 460 U. S., at 715),
the issues facing the plaintiff and the court can be discovered anywhere
in the evidence the parties have introduced concerning discriminatory motivation. Ante, at 516.

into the elusive factual question of intentional discrimina-tion." 450 U. S., at 255, n. 8. We have repeatedly identified

the compelling reason for limiting the factual issues in thefinal stage of a

McDonnell Douglas case as "the requirement
that the plaintiff be afforded a full and fair opportunity to
demonstrate pretext." 450 U. S., at 258 (internal quotationmarks omitted); see

id., at 256 (the plaintiff "must have the
opportunity to demonstrate" pretext); Aikens, supra, at 716,n. 5;

Furnco, 438 U. S., at 578; McDonnell Douglas, 411 U. S.,
at 805. The majority fails to explain how the plaintiff, underits scheme, will ever have a "full and fair opportunity" to

demonstrate that reasons not articulated by the employer,
but discerned in the record by the factfinder, are also unworthy of credence. The Court thus transforms the employer's
burden of production from a device used to provide notice
and promote fairness into a misleading and potentially useless ritual.

The majority's scheme greatly disfavors Title VII plaintiffs without the good luck to have direct evidence of discriminatory intent. The Court repeats the truism that the plaintiff has the "ultimate burden" of proving discrimination, see
ante, at 507, 508, 511, 518, without ever facing the practical
question of how the plaintiff without such direct evidence
can meet this burden. Burdine provides the answer, telling
us that such a plaintiff may succeed in meeting his ultimate
burden of proving discrimination "indirectly by showing that
the employer's proffered explanation is unworthy of credence." 450 U. S., at 256; see Aikens, 460 U. S., at 716; id.,
at 717-718 (Blackmun, J., joined by Brennan, J., concurring).
The possibility of some practical procedure for addressing
what Burdine calls indirect proof is crucial to the success of
most Title VII claims, for the simple reason that employers
who discriminate are not likely to announce their discriminatory motive. And yet, under the majority's scheme, a victim
of discrimination lacking direct evidence will now be saddled
with the tremendous disadvantage of having to confront, not

Souter, J., dissenting
the defined task of proving the employer's stated reasons tobe false, but the amorphous requirement of disproving all

possible nondiscriminatory reasons that a factfinder mightfind lurking in the record. In the Court's own words, the
plaintiff must "disprove all other reasons suggested, no matter how vaguely, in the record." Ante, at 523 (emphasis inoriginal).

While the Court appears to acknowledge that a plaintiffwill have the task of disproving even vaguely suggested reasons, and while it recognizes the need for "[c]larity regardingthe requisite elements of proof,"

ante, at 524, it nonetheless
gives conflicting signals about the scope of its holding in this
case. In one passage, the Court states that although proof
of the falsity of the employer's proffered reasons does not
"compe[l] judgment for the plaintiff," such evidence, without
more, "will permit the trier of fact to infer the ultimate fact
of intentional discrimination." Ante, at 511 (emphasis deleted). The same view is implicit in the Court's decision to
remand this case, ante, at 524-525, keeping Hicks's chance
of winning a judgment alive although he has done no more
(in addition to proving his prima facie case) than show that
the reasons proffered by St. Mary's are unworthy of credence. But other language in the Court's opinion supports
a more extreme conclusion, that proof of the falsity of the
employer's articulated reasons will not even be sufficient to
sustain judgment for the plaintiff. For example, the Court
twice states that the plaintiff must show "both that the reason was false, and that discrimination was the real reason."
Ante, at 515; see ante, at 507-508. In addition, in summing
up its reading of our earlier cases, the Court states that "[i]t
is not enough . . . to disbelieve the employer." Ante, at 519
(emphasis deleted). This "pretext-plus" approach would
turn Burdine on its head, see n. 7, supra, and it would result
in summary judgment for the employer in the many cases
where the plaintiff has no evidence beyond that required to
prove a prima facie case and to show that the employer's

articulated reasons are unworthy of credence. Cf. Carter v.
Duncan-Huggins, Ltd., 234 U. S. App. D. C. 126, 146, 727
F. 2d 1225, 1245 (1984) (Scalia, J., dissenting) ("[I]n order to
get to the jury the plaintiff would . . . have to introduce some
evidence . . . that the basis for [the] discriminatory treatment
was race") (emphasis in original). See generally Lanctot,
The Defendant Lies and the Plaintiff Loses: The Fallacy of
the "Pretext-Plus" Rule in Employment Discrimination
Cases, 43 Hastings L. J. 57 (1991) (criticizing the "pretextplus" approach).

The Court fails to explain, moreover, under either interpretation of its holding, why proof that the employer's
articulated reasons are "unpersuasive, or even obviously
contrived," ante, at 524, falls short. Under McDonnell
Douglas and Burdine, there would be no reason in this situation to question discriminatory intent. The plaintiff has
raised an inference of discrimination (though no longer a presumption) through proof of his prima facie case, and as we
noted in Burdine, this circumstantial proof of discrimination
can also be used by the plaintiff to show pretext. 450 U. S.,
at 255, n. 10. Such proof is merely strengthened by showing, through use of further evidence, that the employer's articulated reasons are false, since "common experience" tells
us that it is "more likely than not" that the employer who
lies is simply trying to cover up the illegality alleged by the
plaintiff. Furnco, 438 U. S., at 577. Unless McDonnell
Douglas's command to structure and limit the case as the
employer chooses is to be rendered meaningless, we should
not look beyond the employer's lie by assuming the possible
existence of other reasons the employer might have proffered without lying. By telling the factfinder to keep digging in cases where the plaintiff 's proof of pretext turns on
showing the employer's reasons to be unworthy of credence,
the majority rejects the very point of the McDonnell Douglas rule requiring the scope of the factual enquiry to be lim509us2u112 05-04-97 18:36:56 PAGES OPINPGT

ited, albeit in a manner chosen by the employer. What ismore, the Court is throwing out the rule for the benefit of

employers who have been found to have given false evidencein a court of law. There is simply no justification for favoring these employers by exempting them from responsibilityfor lies.

11 It may indeed be true that such employers have

nondiscriminatory reasons for their actions, but ones soshameful that they wish to conceal them. One can understand human frailty and the natural desire to conceal it, how-ever, without finding in it a justification to dispense with an
orderly procedure for getting at "the elusive factual questionof intentional discrimination."

Burdine, 450 U. S., at 255,n. 8.

With no justification in the employer's favor, the conse-quences to actual and potential Title VII litigants stand out
sharply. To the extent that workers like Melvin Hicks de-cide not to sue, given the uncertainties they would face
under the majority's scheme, the legislative purpose inadopting Title VII will be frustrated. To the extent such
workers nevertheless decide to press forward, the result willlikely be wasted time, effort, and money for all concerned.
Under the scheme announced today, any conceivable explana-tion for the employer's actions that might be suggested by
the evidence, however unrelated to the employer's articu-lated reasons, must be addressed by a plaintiff who does not

11 Although the majority chides me for referring to employers who offer
false evidence in court as "liars," see ante, at 520, it was the first to place
such employers in the company of perjurers, see ante, at 522. In any
event, it is hardly "absurd" to say that an individual is lying when the
factfinder does not believe his testimony, whether he is testifying on his
own behalf or as the agent of a corporation. Ante, at 520-521. Factfinders constantly must decide whether explanations offered in court are true,
and when they conclude, by a preponderance of the evidence, that a proffered explanation is false, it is not unfair to call that explanation a lie. To
label it "perjury," a criminal concept, would be jumping the gun, but only
the majority has employed that term. See ante, at 520-522.

wish to risk losing. Since the Court does not say whether
a trial court may limit the introduction of evidence at trial
to what is relevant to the employer's articulated reasons, and
since the employer can win on the possibility of an unstated
reason, the scope of admissible evidence at trial presumably
includes any evidence potentially relevant to "the ultimate
question" of discrimination, unlimited by the employer's
stated reasons. Ante, at 511. If so, Title VII trials promise
to be tedious affairs. But even if, on the contrary, relevant
evidence is still somehow to be limited by reference to the
employer's reasons, however "vaguely" articulated, the careful plaintiff will have to anticipate all the side issues that
might arise even in a more limited evidentiary presentation.
Thus, in either case, pretrial discovery will become more extensive and wide ranging (if the plaintiff can afford it), for a
much wider set of facts could prove to be both relevant and
important at trial. The majority's scheme, therefore, will
promote longer trials and more pretrial discovery, threatening increased expense and delay in Title VII litigation for
both plaintiffs and defendants, and increased burdens on
the judiciary.

In addition to its unfairness and impracticality, the Court's
new scheme, on its own terms, produces some remarkable
results. Contrary to the assumption underlying the McDonnell Douglas framework, that employers will have
"some reason" for their hiring and firing decisions, see
Furnco, supra, at 577 (emphasis in original), the majority
assumes that some employers will be unable to discover the
reasons for their own personnel actions. See ante, at 513.
Under the majority's scheme, however, such employers,
when faced with proof of a prima facie case of discrimination,
still must carry the burden of producing evidence that a challenged employment action was taken for a nondiscriminatory
reason. Ante, at 506-507, 509. Thus, if an employer claims
it cannot produce any evidence of a nondiscriminatory reason

for a personnel decision,12 and the trier of fact concludes that
the plaintiff has proven his prima facie case, the court must
enter judgment for the plaintiff. Ante, at 510, n. 3. The
majority's scheme therefore leads to the perverse result that
employers who fail to discover nondiscriminatory reasons for
their own decisions to hire and fire employees not only will

12 The Court is unrealistically concerned about the rare case in which an
employer cannot easily turn to one of its employees for an explanation of
a personnel decision. See ante, at 513. Most companies, of course, keep
personnel records, and such records generally are admissible under Rule
803(6) of the Federal Rules of Evidence. See, e. g., Martin v. Funtime,
Inc., 963 F. 2d 110, 115-116 (CA6 1992); EEOC v. Alton Packaging Corp.,
901 F. 2d 920, 925-926 (CA11 1990). Even those employers who do not
keep records of their decisions will have other means of discovering the
likely reasons for a personnel action by, for example, interviewing coworkers, examining employment records, and identifying standard personnel policies. The majority's scheme rewards employers who decide, in
this atypical situation, to invent rather than to investigate.

This concern drives the majority to point to the hypothetical case, ante,
at 513-514, of the employer with a disproportionately high percentage of
minority workers who would nonetheless lose a Title VII racial discrimination case by giving an untrue reason for a challenged personnel action.
What the majority does not tell us, however, is why such an employer
must rely solely on an "antagonistic former employee," ante, at 514, rather
than on its own personnel records, among other things, to establish the
credible, nondiscriminatory reason it almost certainly must have had,
given the facts assumed. The majority claims it would be a "mockery of
justice" to allow recovery against an employer who presents "compelling
evidence" of nondiscrimination simply because the jury believes a reason
given in a personnel record "is probably not the `true' one." Ante, at 514,
n. 5. But prior to drawing such a conclusion, the jury would consider all
of the "compelling evidence" as at least circumstantial evidence for the
truth of the nondiscriminatory explanation, because the employer would
be able to argue that it would not lie to avoid a discrimination charge
when its general behavior had been so demonstrably meritorious. If the
jury still found that the plaintiff had carried his burden to show untruth,
the untruth must have been a real whopper, or else the "compelling evidence" must not have been very compelling. In either event, justice need
not worry too much about mockery.

benefit from lying,13 but must lie, to defend successfully
against a disparate-treatment action. By offering false evidence of a nondiscriminatory reason, such an employer can
rebut the presumption raised by the plaintiff 's prima facie
case, and then hope that the factfinder will conclude that the
employer may have acted for a reason unknown rather than
for a discriminatory reason. I know of no other scheme for
structuring a legal action that, on its own terms, requires a
party to lie in order to prevail.

Finally, the Court's opinion destroys a framework carefully crafted in precedents as old as 20 years, which the
Court attempts to deflect, but not to confront. The majority
first contends that the opinions creating and refining the
McDonnell Douglas framework consist primarily of dicta,
whose bearing on the issue we consider today presumably
can be ignored. See ante, at 515. But this readiness to disclaim the Court's considered pronouncements devalues them.
Cases, such as McDonnell Douglas, that set forth an order
of proof necessarily go beyond the minimum necessary to
settle the narrow dispute presented, but evidentiary frameworks set up in this manner are not for that reason subject to
summary dismissal in later cases as products of mere dicta.
Courts and litigants rely on this Court to structure lawsuits
based on federal statutes in an orderly and sensible manner,
and we should not casually abandon the structures adopted.

13 As the majority readily admits, its scheme places any employer who
lies in a better position than the employer who says nothing. Ante, at
521-522. Under McDonnell Douglas and Burdine, an employer caught
in a lie will lose on the merits, subjecting himself to liability not only for
damages, but also for the prevailing plaintiff's attorney's fees, including,
presumably, fees for the extra time spent to show pretext. See 42 U. S. C.

$ 2000e-5(k) (1988 ed., Supp. III) (providing for an award of a "reasonable
attorney's fee" to the "prevailing party" in a Title VII action). Under the
majority's scheme, the employer who is caught in a lie, but succeeds in
injecting into the trial an unarticulated reason for its actions, will win its
case and walk away rewarded for its falsehoods.

Because the Court thus naturally declines to rely entirelyon dismissing our prior directives as dicta, it turns to the

task of interpreting our prior cases in this area, in particular
Burdine. While acknowledging that statements from these
earlier cases may be read, and in one instance must be read,
to limit the final enquiry in a disparate-treatment case to thequestion of pretext, the Court declares my reading of those

cases to be "utter[ly] implausib[le]," ante, at 513, imputingviews to earlier Courts that would be "beneath contempt,"
ante, at 518, n. 7. The unlikely reading is, however, sharedby the Solicitor General and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which is charged with implementing and
enforcing Title VII and related statutes, see Brief for United
States et al. as Amici Curiae 1-2, not to mention the Court
of Appeals in this case and, even by the Court's count, more
than half of the Courts of Appeals to have discussed the
question (some, albeit, in dicta). See ante, at 512-513. The
company should not be cause for surprise. For reasons explained above, McDonnell Douglas and Burdine provide a
clear answer to the question before us, and it would behoove
the majority to explain its decision to depart from those
cases.

The Court's final attempt to neutralize the force of our
precedents comes in its claim that Aikens settled the question presented today. This attempt to rest on Aikens runs
into the immediate difficulty, however, that Aikens repeats
what we said earlier in Burdine: the plaintiff may succeed in
meeting his ultimate burden of persuasion " `either directly
by persuading the court that a discriminatory reason more
likely motivated the employer or indirectly by showing that
the employer's proffered explanation is unworthy of credence.' " Aikens, 460 U. S., at 716 (quoting Burdine, 450
U. S., at 256). Although the Aikens Court quoted this statement approvingly, the majority here projects its view that
the latter part of the statement is "problematic," ante, at
519, arguing that the next sentence in Aikens takes care of

the "problem." The next sentence, however, only createsmore problems for the majority, as it directs the District

Court to "decide which party's explanation of the employer'smotivation it believes." 460 U. S., at 716 (emphasis supplied). By requiring the factfinder to choose between the
employer's explanation and the plaintiff 's claim of discrimi-nation (shown either directly or indirectly),

Aikens flatly
bars the Court's conclusion here that the factfinder canchoose a third explanation, never offered by the employer, in

ruling against the plaintiff. Because Aikens will not bearthe reading the majority seeks to place upon it, there is no
hope of projecting into the past the abandonment of precedent that occurs today.

I cannot join the majority in turning our back on these
earlier decisions. "Considerations of stare decisis have special force in the area of statutory interpretation, for here,
unlike in the context of constitutional interpretation, the legislative power is implicated, and Congress remains free to
alter what we have done." Patterson v. McLean Credit
Union, 491 U. S. 164, 172-173 (1989). It is not as though
Congress is unaware of our decisions concerning Title VII,
and recent experience indicates that Congress is ready to act
if we adopt interpretations of this statutory scheme it finds
to be mistaken. See Civil Rights Act of 1991, 105 Stat. 1071.
Congress has taken no action to indicate that we were mistaken in McDonnell Douglas and Burdine.

* * *
The enhancement of a Title VII plaintiff 's burden wrought
by the Court's opinion is exemplified in this case. Melvin
Hicks was denied any opportunity, much less a full and fair
one, to demonstrate that the supposedly nondiscriminatory
explanation for his demotion and termination, the personal
animosity of his immediate supervisor, was unworthy of credence. In fact, the District Court did not find that personal
animosity (which it failed to recognize might be racially moti509us2u112 05-04-97 18:36:56 PAGES OPINPGT

vated) was the true reason for the actions St. Mary's took; itadduced this reason simply as a possibility in explaining that

Hicks had failed to prove "that the crusade [to terminatehim] was racially rather than personally motivated." 756
F. Supp. 1244, 1252 (ED Mo. 1991). It is hardly surprisingthat Hicks failed to prove anything about this supposed personal crusade, since St. Mary's never articulated such an ex-planation for Hicks's discharge, and since the person who allegedly conducted this crusade denied at trial any personaldifficulties between himself and Hicks. App. 46. While the
majority may well be troubled about the unfair treatment ofHicks in this instance and thus remands for review of
whether the District Court's factual conclusions were clearlyerroneous, see ante, at 524-525, the majority provides Hicks
with no opportunity to produce evidence showing that theDistrict Court's hypothesized explanation, first articulated
six months after trial, is unworthy of credence. WhetherMelvin Hicks wins or loses on remand, many plaintiffs in a
like position will surely lose under the scheme adopted bythe Court today, unless they possess both prescience and resources beyond what this Court has previously requiredTitle VII litigants to employ.

Because I see no reason why Title VII interpretationshould be driven by concern for employers who are too
ashamed to be honest in court, at the expense of victims ofdiscrimination who do not happen to have direct evidence of
discriminatory intent, I respectfully dissent.

544 OCTOBER TERM, 1992

Syllabus

ALEXANDER v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eighth circuit

No. 91-1526. Argued January 12, 1993--Decided June 28, 1993
After a full criminal trial, petitioner, the owner of numerous businesses

dealing in sexually explicit materials, was convicted of, inter alia, violating federal obscenity laws and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act (RICO). The obscenity convictions, based on a finding that seven items sold at several stores were obscene, were the predicates for his RICO convictions. In addition to imposing a prison term
and fine, the District Court ordered petitioner, as punishment for the
RICO violations, to forfeit his businesses and almost $9 million acquired
through racketeering activity. In affirming the forfeiture order, the
Court of Appeals rejected petitioner's arguments that RICO's forfeiture
provisions constitute a prior restraint on speech and are overbroad.
The court also held that the forfeiture did not violate the Eighth
Amendment, concluding that proportionality review is not required of
any sentence less than life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. It did not consider whether the forfeiture was disproportionate
or "excessive."

Held:

1. RICO's forfeiture provisions, as applied here, did not violate the
First Amendment. Pp. 549-558.

(a) The forfeiture here is a permissible criminal punishment, not a
prior restraint on speech. The distinction between prior restraints and
subsequent punishments is solidly grounded in this Court's cases. The
term "prior restraint" describes orders forbidding certain communications that are issued before the communications occur. See, e. g., Near
v. Minnesota ex rel. Olson, 283 U. S. 697. However, the order here
imposes no legal impediment to petitioner's ability to engage in any
expressive activity; it just prevents him from financing those activities
with assets derived from his prior racketeering offenses. RICO is
oblivious to the expressive or nonexpressive nature of the assets forfeited. Petitioner's assets were forfeited because they were directly
related to past racketeering violations, and thus they differ from material seized or restrained on suspicion of being obscene without a prior
judicial obscenity determination, as occurred in, e. g., Marcus v. Search
Warrant of Kansas City, Mo., Property, 367 U. S. 717. Nor were his
assets ordered forfeited without the requisite procedural safeguards.

Fort Wayne Books, Inc. v. Indiana, 489 U. S. 46, distinguished. His
claim is also inconsistent with Arcara v. Cloud Books, Inc., 478 U. S.
697, in which the Court rejected a claim that the closure of an adult
bookstore under a general nuisance statute was an improper prior restraint. His definition of prior restraint also would undermine the
time-honored distinction between barring future speech and penalizing
past speech. Pp. 549-554.

(b) Since the RICO statute does not criminalize constitutionally
protected speech, it is materially different from the statutes at issue in
this Court's overbreadth cases. Cf., e. g., Board of Airport Comm'rs of
Los Angeles v. Jews for Jesus, Inc., 482 U. S. 569, 574-575. In addition,
the threat of forfeiture has no more of a "chilling" effect on free expression than threats of a prison term or large fine, which are constitutional
under Fort Wayne Books. Nor can the forfeiture be said to offend the
First Amendment based on Arcara's analysis that criminal sanctions
with some incidental effect on First Amendment activities are subject
to First Amendment scrutiny where it was the expressive conduct that
drew the legal remedy, 478 U. S., at 706-707. While the conduct drawing the legal remedy here may have been expressive, "obscenity" can
be regulated or actually proscribed consistent with the Amendment,
see, e. g., Roth v. United States, 354 U. S. 476, 485. Pp. 554-558.

2. The case is remanded for the Court of Appeals to consider petitioner's claim that the forfeiture, considered atop his prison term and fine,
is "excessive" within the meaning of the Excessive Fines Clause of the
Eighth Amendment. The Court of Appeals rejected petitioner's
Eighth Amendment challenge with a statement that applies only to the
Amendment's prohibition against "cruel and unusual punishments."
The Excessive Fines Clause limits the Government's power to extract
payments as punishment for an offense, and the in personam criminal
forfeiture at issue here is clearly a form of monetary punishment no
different, for Eighth Amendment purposes, from a traditional "fine."
The question whether the forfeiture was excessive must be considered
in light of the extensive criminal activities that petitioner apparently
conducted through his enormous racketeering enterprise over a substantial period of time rather than the number of materials actually
found to be obscene. Pp. 558-559.

Opinion of the Court
claims under the First Amendment but remand for reconsid-eration of his Eighth Amendment challenge.

Petitioner was in the so-called "adult entertainment" busi-ness for more than 30 years, selling pornographic magazines
and sexual paraphernalia, showing sexually explicit movies,
and eventually selling and renting videotapes of a similarnature. He received shipments of these materials at a warehouse in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where they were wrappedin plastic, priced, and boxed. He then sold his products
through some 13 retail stores in several different Minnesotacities, generating millions of dollars in annual revenues. In
1989, federal authorities filed a 41-count indictment against
petitioner and others, alleging, inter alia, operation of a
racketeering enterprise in violation of RICO. The indictment charged 34 obscenity counts and 3 RICO counts, the
racketeering counts being predicated on the obscenity
charges. The indictment also charged numerous counts of
tax evasion and related offenses that are not relevant to the
questions before us.

Following a 4-month jury trial in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota, petitioner was convicted of 17 substantive obscenity offenses: 12 counts of
transporting obscene material in interstate commerce for the
purpose of sale or distribution, in violation of 18 U. S. C.

$ 1465; and 5 counts of engaging in the business of selling
obscene material, in violation of 18 U. S. C. $ 1466 (1988 ed.
and Supp. III). He also was convicted of 3 RICO offenses
that were predicated on the obscenity convictions: one count
of receiving and using income derived from a pattern of
racketeering activity, in violation of 18 U. S. C. $ 1962(a);
one count of conducting a RICO enterprise, in violation of

$ 1962(c); and one count of conspiring to conduct a RICO enterprise, in violation of $ 1962(d). As a basis for the obscenity and RICO convictions, the jury determined that four
magazines and three videotapes were obscene. Multiple
copies of these magazines and videos, which graphically de509us3113M 04-04-97 17:55:40 PAGES OPINPGT

picted a variety of "hard core" sexual acts, were distributedthroughout petitioner's adult entertainment empire.

Petitioner was sentenced to a total of six years in prison,fined $100,000, and ordered to pay the cost of prosecution,
incarceration, and supervised release. In addition to thesepunishments, the District Court reconvened the same

jury and conducted a forfeiture proceeding pursuant to$ 1963(a)(2). At this proceeding, the Government sought
forfeiture of the businesses and real estate that representedpetitioner's interest in the racketeering enterprise, $ 1963(a)
(2)(A), the property that afforded petitioner influence overthat enterprise, $ 1963(a)(2)(D), and the assets and proceeds
petitioner had obtained from his racketeering offenses,$$ 1963(a)(1), (3). The jury found that petitioner had an interest in 10 pieces of commercial real estate and 31 currentor former businesses, all of which had been used to conduct
his racketeering enterprise. Sitting without the jury, theDistrict Court then found that petitioner had acquired a variety of assets as a result of his racketeering activities. Thecourt ultimately ordered petitioner to forfeit his wholesale
and retail businesses (including all the assets of those busi-nesses) and almost $9 million in moneys acquired through
racketeering activity.1The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's forfeiture order. Alexander v. Thornburgh, 943 F. 2d 825 (CA81991). It rejected petitioner's argument that the application of RICO's forfeiture provisions constituted a prior re-straint on speech and hence violated the First Amendment.
Recognizing the well-established distinction between priorrestraints and subsequent criminal punishments, the Court
of Appeals found that the forfeiture here was "a criminal

penalty imposed following a conviction for conducting an en-terprise engaged in racketeering activities," and not a prior

restraint on speech. Id., at 834. The court also rejectedpetitioner's claim that RICO's forfeiture provisions are constitutionally overbroad, pointing out that the forfeiture order
was properly limited to assets linked to petitioner's pastracketeering offenses.

Id., at 835. Lastly, the Court of Appeals concluded that the forfeiture order does not violate theEighth Amendment's prohibition against "cruel and unusual

punishments" and "excessive fines." In so ruling, however,the court did not consider whether the forfeiture in this case
was grossly disproportionate or excessive, believing that the
Eighth Amendment " `does not require a proportionality review of any sentence less than life imprisonment without the
possibility of parole.' " Id., at 836 (quoting United States v.
Pryba, 900 F. 2d 748, 757 (CA4), cert. denied, 498 U. S. 924
(1990)). We granted certiorari, 505 U. S. 1217 (1992).

Petitioner first contends that the forfeiture in this case,
which effectively shut down his adult entertainment business, constituted an unconstitutional prior restraint on
speech, rather than a permissible criminal punishment. According to petitioner, forfeiture of expressive materials and
the assets of businesses engaged in expressive activity, when
predicated solely upon previous obscenity violations, operates as a prior restraint because it prohibits future presumptively protected expression in retaliation for prior unprotected speech. Practically speaking, petitioner argues, the
effect of the RICO forfeiture order here was no different
from the injunction prohibiting the publication of expressive
material found to be a prior restraint in Near v. Minnesota
ex rel. Olson, 283 U. S. 697 (1931). As petitioner puts it, see
Brief for Petitioner 25, the forfeiture order imposed a complete ban on his future expression because of previous unprotected speech. We disagree. By lumping the forfeiture imposed in this case after a full criminal trial with an injunction
enjoining future speech, petitioner stretches the term "prior

Opinion of the Court
restraint" well beyond the limits established by our cases.To accept petitioner's argument would virtually obliterate

the distinction, solidly grounded in our cases, between priorrestraints and subsequent punishments.

The term "prior restraint" is used "to describe administrative and judicial orders forbidding certain communicationswhen issued in advance of the time that such communications

are to occur." M. Nimmer, Nimmer on Freedom of Speech$ 4.03, p. 4-14 (1984) (emphasis added). Temporary restraining orders and permanent injunctions--i. e., court ordersthat actually forbid speech activities--are classic examples
of prior restraints. See id., $ 4.03, at 4-16. This understanding of what constitutes a prior restraint is borne out by
our cases, even those on which petitioner relies. In Near v.
Minnesota ex rel. Olson, supra, we invalidated a court order
that perpetually enjoined the named party, who had published a newspaper containing articles found to violate a
state nuisance statute, from producing any future "malicious,
scandalous or defamatory" publication. Id., at 706. Near,
therefore, involved a true restraint on future speech--a permanent injunction. So, too, did Organization for a Better
Austin v. Keefe, 402 U. S. 415 (1971), and Vance v. Universal
Amusement Co., 445 U. S. 308 (1980) (per curiam), two other

cases cited by petitioner. In Keefe, we vacated an order
"enjoining petitioners from distributing leaflets anywhere in
the town of Westchester, Illinois." 402 U. S., at 415 (emphasis added). And in Vance, we struck down a Texas statute
that authorized courts, upon a showing that obscene films
had been shown in the past, to issue an injunction of indefinite duration prohibiting the future exhibition of films that
have not yet been found to be obscene. 445 U. S., at 311.
See also New York Times Co. v. United States, 403 U. S. 713,
714 (1971) (per curiam) (Government sought to enjoin publication of the Pentagon Papers).

By contrast, the RICO forfeiture order in this case does
not forbid petitioner to engage in any expressive activi509us3113M 04-04-97 17:55:40 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
ties in the future, nor does it require him to obtain priorapproval for any expressive activities. It only deprives him

of specific assets that were found to be related to his previ-ous racketeering violations. Assuming, of course, that he
has sufficient untainted assets to open new stores, restock
his inventory, and hire staff, petitioner can go back into theadult entertainment business tomorrow, and sell as many

sexually explicit magazines and videotapes as he likes, with-out any risk of being held in contempt for violating a court
order. Unlike the injunctions in Near, Keefe, and Vance, theforfeiture order in this case imposes no legal impediment
to--no prior restraint on--petitioner's ability to engage in
any expressive activity he chooses. He is perfectly free to
open an adult bookstore or otherwise engage in the production and distribution of erotic materials; he just cannot finance these enterprises with assets derived from his prior
racketeering offenses.

The constitutional infirmity in nearly all of our prior restraint cases involving obscene material, including those on
which petitioner and the dissent rely, see post, at 570-571,
577, was that the government had seized or otherwise restrained materials suspected of being obscene without a
prior judicial determination that they were in fact so. See,
e. g., Marcus v. Search Warrant of Kansas City, Mo., Property, 367 U. S. 717 (1961); Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan,
372 U. S. 58 (1963); Quantity of Copies of Books v. Kansas,
378 U. S. 205 (1964); Roaden v. Kentucky, 413 U. S. 496
(1973); Vance, supra. In this case, however, the assets in
question were ordered forfeited not because they were believed to be obscene, but because they were directly related
to petitioner's past racketeering violations. The RICO forfeiture statute calls for the forfeiture of assets because of the
financial role they play in the operation of the racketeering
enterprise. The statute is oblivious to the expressive or
nonexpressive nature of the assets forfeited; books, sports
cars, narcotics, and cash are all forfeitable alike under RICO.

509us3113M 04-04-97 17:55:40 PAGES OPINPGT
552 ALEXANDER v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
Indeed, a contrary scheme would be disastrous from a policystandpoint, enabling racketeers to evade forfeiture by investing the proceeds of their crimes in businesses engaging inexpressive activity.

Nor were the assets in question ordered forfeited without
according petitioner the requisite procedural safeguards, an-other recurring theme in our prior restraint cases. Contrasting this case with Fort Wayne Books, Inc. v. Indiana,489 U. S. 46 (1989), aptly illustrates this point. In

Fort
Wayne Books, we rejected on constitutional grounds the pre-trial seizure of certain expressive material that was based

upon a finding of "no more than probable cause to believe
that a RICO violation had occurred." Id., at 66 (emphasis
in original). In so holding, we emphasized that there had
been no prior judicial "determination that the seized items
were `obscene' or that a RICO violation ha[d] occurred."
Ibid. (emphasis in original). "[M]ere probable cause to believe a legal violation ha[d] transpired," we said, "is not adequate to remove books or films from circulation." Ibid.
Here, by contrast, the seizure was not premature, because
the Government established beyond a reasonable doubt the
basis for the forfeiture. Petitioner had a full criminal trial
on the merits of the obscenity and RICO charges during
which the Government proved that four magazines and three
videotapes were obscene and that the other forfeited assets
were directly linked to petitioner's commission of racketeering offenses.

Petitioner's claim that the RICO forfeiture statute operated as an unconstitutional prior restraint in this case is also
inconsistent with our decision in Arcara v. Cloud Books,
Inc., 478 U. S. 697 (1986). In that case, we sustained a court
order, issued under a general nuisance statute, that closed
down an adult bookstore that was being used as a place of
prostitution and lewdness. In rejecting out-of-hand a claim
that the closure order amounted to an improper prior restraint on speech, we stated:

509us3113M 04-04-97 17:55:40 PAGES OPINPGT

553Cite as: 509 U. S. 544 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
"The closure order sought in this case differs from aprior restraint in two significant respects. First, the

order would impose no restraint at all on the dissemina-tion of particular materials, since respondents are free
to carry on their bookselling business at another loca-tion, even if such locations are difficult to find. Second,
the closure order sought would not be imposed on thebasis of an advance determination that the distribution
of particular materials is prohibited--indeed, the impo-sition of the closure order has nothing to do with any
expressive conduct at all." Id., at 705-706, n. 2.
This reasoning applies with equal force to this case, and thusconfirms that the RICO forfeiture order was not a prior

restraint on speech, but a punishment for past criminalconduct. Petitioner attempts to distinguish

Arcara on theground that obscenity, unlike prostitution or lewdness, has

" `a significant expressive element.' " Brief for Petitioner 16(quoting Arcara, supra, at 706). But that distinction has no
bearing on the question whether the forfeiture order in thiscase was an impermissible prior restraint.

Finally, petitioner's proposed definition of the term "priorrestraint" would undermine the time-honored distinction
between barring speech in the future and penalizing pastspeech. The doctrine of prior restraint originated in the
common law of England, where prior restraints of the presswere not permitted, but punishment after publication was.
This very limited application of the principle of freedom ofspeech was held inconsistent with our First Amendment as
long ago as Grosjean v. American Press Co., 297 U. S. 233,246 (1936). While we may have given a broader definition
to the term "prior restraint" than was given to it in Englishcommon law,

2 our decisions have steadfastly preserved the

2 The doctrine of prior restraint has its roots in the 16th- and 17thcentury English system of censorship. Under that system, all printing
presses and printers were licensed by the government, and nothing could
lawfully be published without the prior approval of a government or

554 ALEXANDER v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
distinction between prior restraints and subsequent punish-ments. Though petitioner tries to dismiss this distinction

as "neither meaningful nor useful," Brief for Petitioner 29,we think it is critical to our First Amendment jurisprudence.
Because we have interpreted the First Amendment as pro-viding greater protection from prior restraints than from
subsequent punishments, see Southeastern Promotions, Ltd.v.

Conrad, 420 U. S. 546, 558-559 (1975), it is important forus to delineate with some precision the defining characteristics of a prior restraint. To hold that the forfeiture order inthis case constituted a prior restraint would have the exact
opposite effect: It would blur the line separating prior re-straints from subsequent punishments to such a degree that
it would be impossible to determine with any certaintywhether a particular measure is a prior restraint or not.

In sum, we think that fidelity to our cases requires us toanalyze the forfeiture here not as a prior restraint, but under
normal First Amendment standards. So analyzing it, wefind that petitioner's claim falls well short of the mark. He
does not challenge either his 6-year jail sentence or his$100,000 fine as violative of the First Amendment. The first
inquiry that comes to mind, then, is why, if incarceration forsix years and a fine of $100,000 are permissible forms of punishment under the RICO statute, the challenged forfeitureof certain assets directly related to petitioner's racketeering
activity is not. Our cases support the instinct from which
church censor. See generally T. Emerson, System of Freedom of Expression 504 (1970). Beginning with Near v. Minnesota ex rel. Olson, 283
U. S. 697 (1931), we expanded this doctrine to include not only licensing
schemes requiring speech to be submitted to an administrative censor for
prepublication review, but also injunctions against future speech issued
by judges. See Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Pittsburgh Comm'n on Human
Relations, 413 U. S. 376, 389-390 (1973) ("[T]he protection against prior
restraint at common law barred only a system of administrative
censorship. . . . [T]he Court boldly stepped beyond this narrow doctrine in
Near"). Quite obviously, however, we have never before countenanced
the essentially limitless expansion of the term that petitioner proposes.

Opinion of the Court
this question arises; they establish quite clearly that theFirst Amendment does not prohibit either stringent criminal

sanctions for obscenity offenses or forfeiture of expressivematerials as punishment for criminal conduct.

We have in the past rejected First Amendment challenges
to statutes that impose severe prison sentences and fines aspunishment for obscenity offenses. See,

e. g., Ginzburg v.
United States, 383 U. S. 463, 464-465, n. 2 (1966); Smith v.
United States, 431 U. S. 291, 296, n. 3 (1977); Fort Wayne
Books, 489 U. S., at 59, n. 8. Petitioner does not questionthe holding of those cases; he instead argues that RICO's

forfeiture provisions are constitutionally overbroad because
they are not limited solely to obscene materials and the proceeds from the sale of such materials. Petitioner acknowledges that this is an unprecedented use of the overbreadth
principle. See Brief for Petitioner 36. The "overbreadth"
doctrine, which is a departure from traditional rules of
standing, permits a defendant to make a facial challenge to
an overly broad statute restricting speech, even if he himself
has engaged in speech that could be regulated under a more
narrowly drawn statute. See, e. g., Broadrick v. Oklahoma,
413 U. S. 601, 612-613 (1973); City Council of Los Angeles v.
Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U. S. 789, 798-801 (1984). But
the RICO statute does not criminalize constitutionally protected speech and therefore is materially different from the
statutes at issue in our overbreadth cases. Cf., e. g., Board
of Airport Comm'rs of Los Angeles v. Jews for Jesus, Inc.,
482 U. S. 569, 574-575 (1987).

Petitioner's real complaint is not that the RICO statute
is overbroad, but that applying RICO's forfeiture provisions
to businesses dealing in expressive materials may have an
improper "chilling" effect on free expression by deterring
others from engaging in protected speech. No doubt the
monetarily large forfeiture in this case may induce cautious
booksellers to practice self-censorship and remove marginally protected materials from their shelves out of fear that

556 ALEXANDER v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
those materials could be found obscene and thus subjectthem to forfeiture. But the defendant in

Fort Wayne Books
made a similar argument, which was rejected by the Courtin this language:

"[D]eterrence of the sale of obscene materials is a legiti-mate end of state antiobscenity laws, and our cases have
long recognized the practical reality that `any form ofcriminal obscenity statute applicable to a bookseller will
induce some tendency to self-censorship and have someinhibitory effect on the dissemination of material not obscene.' " 489 U. S., at 60 (quoting Smith v. California,
361 U. S. 147, 154-155 (1959)).

Fort Wayne Books is dispositive of any chilling argumenthere, since the threat of forfeiture has no more of a chilling

effect on free expression than the threat of a prison term or
a large fine. Each racketeering charge exposes a defendantto a maximum penalty of 20 years' imprisonment and a fine

of up to $250,000. 18 U. S. C. $ 1963(a) (1988 ed. and Supp.III). See Brief for United States 19. Needless to say, the
prospect of such a lengthy prison sentence would have a farmore powerful deterrent effect on protected speech than the
prospect of any sort of forfeiture. Cf. Blanton v. North Las
Vegas, 489 U. S. 538, 542 (1989) (loss of liberty is a more severe form of punishment than any monetary sanction). Similarly, a fine of several hundred thousand dollars would cer-tainly be just as fatal to most businesses--and, as such,

would result in the same degree of self-censorship--as a for-feiture of assets. Yet these penalties are clearly constitutional under Fort Wayne Books.

We also have rejected a First Amendment challenge to a
court order closing down an entire business that was engaged in expressive activity as punishment for criminal conduct. See Arcara, 478 U. S., at 707. Once again, petitioner
does not question the holding of that case; in fact, he concedes that expressive businesses and assets can be forfeited

Opinion of the Court
under RICO as punishment for, say, narcotic offenses. SeeBrief for Petitioner 11 ("[F]orfeiture of a media business purchased by a drug cartel would be constitutionally permissi-ble"). Petitioner instead insists that the result here should
be different because the RICO predicate acts were obscenity
offenses. In Arcara, we held that criminal and civil sanc-tions having some incidental effect on First Amendment activities are subject to First Amendment scrutiny "onlywhere it was conduct with a significant expressive element
that drew the legal remedy in the first place, as in [United
States v.] O'Brien, [391 U. S. 367 (1968),] or where a statute
based on a nonexpressive activity has the inevitable effect
of singling out those engaged in expressive activity, as in
Minneapolis Star [& Tribune Co. v. Minnesota Comm'r of
Revenue, 460 U. S. 575 (1983)]." 478 U. S., at 706-707 (footnote omitted). Applying that standard, we held that prostitution and lewdness, the criminal conduct at issue in Arcara,
involve neither situation, and thus concluded that the First
Amendment was not implicated by the enforcement of a general health regulation resulting in the closure of an adult
bookstore. Id., at 707. Under our analysis in Arcara, the
forfeiture in this case cannot be said to offend the First
Amendment. To be sure, the conduct that "drew the legal
remedy" here--racketeering committed through obscenity
violations--may be "expressive," see R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505
U. S. 377, 385 (1992), but our cases clearly hold that "obscenity" can be regulated or actually proscribed consistent with
the First Amendment, see, e. g., Roth v. United States, 354
U. S. 476, 485 (1957); Miller v. California, 413 U. S. 15, 23
(1973).

Confronted with our decisions in Fort Wayne Books and
Arcara--neither of which he challenges--petitioner's position boils down to this: Stiff criminal penalties for obscenity
offenses are consistent with the First Amendment; so is the
forfeiture of expressive materials as punishment for criminal
conduct; but the combination of the two somehow results

Opinion of the Court
in a violation of the First Amendment. We reject thiscounterintuitive conclusion, which in effect would say that

the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.Petitioner also argues that the forfeiture order in this
case--considered atop his 6-year prison term and $100,000fine--is disproportionate to the gravity of his offenses and
therefore violates the Eighth Amendment, either as a "crueland unusual punishment" or as an "excessive fine."

3 Brief

for Petitioner 40. The Court of Appeals, though, failed todistinguish between these two components of petitioner's

Eighth Amendment challenge. Instead, the court lumpedthe two together, disposing of them both with the general
statement that the Eighth Amendment does not require anyproportionality review of a sentence less than life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. 943 F. 2d, at 836.But that statement has relevance only to the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishments.Unlike the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause, which is
concerned with matters such as the duration or conditions ofconfinement, "[t]he Excessive Fines Clause limits the government's power to extract payments, whether in cash or inkind, as punishment for some offense."

Austin v. UnitedStates, post, at 609-610 (emphasis and internal quotation

marks omitted); accord, Browning-Ferris Industries of Vt.,Inc. v. Kelco Disposal, Inc., 492 U. S. 257, 265 (1989) ("[A]t
the time of the drafting and ratification of the [Eighth]Amendment, the word `fine' was understood to mean a payment to a sovereign as punishment for some offense"); id., at265, n. 6. The

in personam criminal forfeiture at issue hereis clearly a form of monetary punishment no different, for

Eighth Amendment purposes, from a traditional "fine." Ac3 This sense of disproportionality animates much of petitioner's First
Amendment arguments as well. Questions of proportionality, however,
should be dealt with directly and forthrightly under the Eighth Amendment and not be allowed to influence sub silentio courts' First Amendment analysis.

Opinion of Souter, J.
cord, Austin, supra.4 Accordingly, the forfeiture in thiscase should be analyzed under the Excessive Fines Clause.

Petitioner contends that forfeiture of his entire businesswas an "excessive" penalty for the Government to exact "[o]n
the basis of a few materials the jury ultimately decided wereobscene." Brief for Petitioner 40. It is somewhat misleading, we think, to characterize the racketeering crimes forwhich petitioner was convicted as involving just a few materials ultimately found to be obscene. Petitioner was con-victed of creating and managing what the District Court described as "an enormous racketeering enterprise." App. toPet. for Cert. 160. It is in the light of the extensive criminal
activities which petitioner apparently conducted throughthis racketeering enterprise over a substantial period of time
that the question whether the forfeiture was "excessive"must be considered. We think it preferable that this question be addressed by the Court of Appeals in the firstinstance.

For these reasons, we hold that RICO's forfeiture provi-sions, as applied in this case, did not violate the First
Amendment, but that the Court of Appeals should have con-sidered whether they resulted in an "excessive" penalty
within the meaning of the Eighth Amendment's ExcessiveFines Clause. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of the
Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceed-ings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.
Justice Souter, concurring in the judgment in part anddissenting in part.

I agree with the Court that petitioner has not demon-strated that the forfeiture at issue here qualifies as a prior
restraint as we have traditionally understood that term. I

4 Unlike Austin, this case involves in personam criminal forfeiture not
in rem civil forfeiture, so there was no threshold question concerning the
applicability of the Eighth Amendment.

Kennedy, J., dissenting
also agree with the Court that the case should be remandedfor a determination whether the forfeiture violated the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment. Nonethe-less, I agree with

Justice Kennedy that the First Amend-ment forbids the forfeiture of petitioner's expressive

material in the absence of an adjudication that it is obsceneor otherwise of unprotected character, and therefore I join
Part II of his dissenting opinion.

Justice Kennedy, with whom Justice Blackmun and
Justice Stevens join, and with whom Justice Souterjoins as to Part II, dissenting.

The Court today embraces a rule that would find no af-front to the First Amendment in the Government's destruction of a book and film business and its entire inventory oflegitimate expression as punishment for a single past speech
offense. Until now I had thought one could browse throughany book or film store in the United States without fear that
the proprietor had chosen each item to avoid risk to thewhole inventory and indeed to the business itself. This
ominous, onerous threat undermines free speech and pressprinciples essential to our personal freedom.

Obscenity laws would not work unless an offender couldbe arrested and imprisoned despite the resulting chill on his
own further speech. But, at least before today, we have un-derstood state action directed at protected books or other
expressive works themselves to raise distinct constitutionalconcerns. The Court's decision is a grave repudiation of
First Amendment principles, and with respect I dissent.

The majority believes our cases "establish quite clearlythat the First Amendment does not prohibit either stringent

criminal sanctions for obscenity offenses or forfeiture ofexpressive materials as punishment for criminal conduct."

Ante, at 555. True, we have held that obscenity is expres-sion which can be regulated and punished, within proper limitations, without violating the First Amendment. See, e. g.,
New York v. Ferber, 458 U. S. 747 (1982); Miller v. California, 413 U. S. 15 (1973); Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413
U. S. 49, 57-58 (1973); Roth v. United States, 354 U. S. 476(1957). And the majority is correct to note that we have

upheld stringent fines and jail terms as punishments forviolations of the federal obscenity laws. See

Fort Wayne
Books, Inc. v. Indiana, 489 U. S. 46, 60 (1989); Ginzburg v.
United States, 383 U. S. 463, 464-465, n. 2 (1966). But that
has little to do with the destruction of protected titles and
the facilities for their distribution or publication. None of
our cases address that matter, or it would have been unnecessary for us to reserve the specific question four Terms ago
in Fort Wayne Books, Inc. v. Indiana, supra, at 60, 65.

The fundamental defect in the majority's reasoning is a
failure to recognize that the forfeiture here cannot be
equated with traditional punishments such as fines and jail
terms. Noting that petitioner does not challenge either the
6-year jail sentence or the $100,000 fine imposed against him
as punishment for his convictions under the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), the majority ponders why RICO's forfeiture penalty should be any
different. See ante, at 554. The answer is that RICO's forfeiture penalties are different from traditional punishments
by Congress' own design as well as in their First Amendment consequences.

The federal RICO statute was passed to eradicate the infiltration of legitimate business by organized crime. Pub. L.
91-452, Title IX, 84 Stat. 941, as amended, 18 U. S. C.

$$ 1961-1968 (1988 ed. and Supp. III). Earlier steps to combat organized crime were not successful, in large part because traditional penalties targeted individuals engaged in
racketeering activity rather than the criminal enterprise itself. Punishing racketeers with fines and jail terms failed to

562 ALEXANDER v. UNITED STATES

Kennedy, J., dissenting
break the cycle of racketeering activity because the criminalenterprises had the resources to replace convicted racketeers with new recruits. In passing RICO, Congressadopted a new approach aimed at the economic roots of
organized crime:

"What is needed here . . . are new approaches that willdeal not only with individuals, but also with the economic base through which those individuals constitutesuch a serious threat to the economic well-being of the
Nation. In short, an attack must be made on theirsource of economic power itself, and the attack must
take place on all available fronts." S. Rep. No. 91-617,p. 79 (1969).

Criminal liability under RICO is premised on the commis-sion of a "pattern of racketeering activity," defined by the
statute as engaging in two or more related predicate acts ofracketeering within a 10-year period. 18 U. S. C. $ 1961(5).
A RICO conviction subjects the violator not only to tradi-tional, though stringent, criminal fines and prison terms, but
also mandatory forfeiture under $ 1963.* It is the manda-tory forfeiture penalty that is at issue here.

*Section 1963(a) provides that in imposing sentence on one convicted of
racketeering offenses under $ 1962, the district court shall order forfeiture
of three classes of assets:

"(1) any interest the person has acquired or maintained in violation of
section 1962;

"(2) any--
"(A) interest in;
"(B) security of;
"(C) claim against; or
"(D) property or contractual right of any kind affording a source of
influence over;

"any enterprise which the person has established, operated, controlled,

and

the person obtained, directly or indirectly, from racketeering activity or

While forfeiture remedies have been employed with in-creasing frequency in civil proceedings, forfeiture remedies

and penalties are the subject of historic disfavor in our coun-try. Although in personam forfeiture statutes were well
grounded in the English common law, see Calero-Toledo v.
Pearson Yacht Leasing Co., 416 U. S. 663, 682-683 (1974), inpersonam criminal forfeiture penalties like those authorized

under $ 1963 were unknown in the federal system until theenactment of RICO in 1970. See 1 C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure $ 125.1, p. 389 (2d ed. 1982). Section1963's forfeiture penalties are novel for their punitive character as well as for their unprecedented sweep. Civil in remforfeiture is limited in application to contraband and articles
put to unlawful use, or in its broadest reach, to proceedstraceable to unlawful activity. See

United States v. Parcelof Land, Rumson, N. J., 507 U. S. 111, 118-123 (1993); The

Palmyra, 12 Wheat. 1, 14-15 (1827). Extending beyond con-traband or its traceable proceeds, RICO mandates the forfeiture of property constituting the defendant's "interest inthe racketeering enterprise" and property affording the violator a "source of influence" over the RICO enterprise. 18U. S. C. $ 1963(a) (1988 ed. and Supp. III). In a previous
decision, we acknowledged the novelty of RICO's penaltyscheme, stating that Congress passed RICO to provide "new
weapons of unprecedented scope for an assault upon orga-nized crime and its economic roots."

Russello v. United
States, 464 U. S. 16, 26 (1983).As enacted in 1970, RICO targeted offenses then thought

endemic to organized crime. 18 U. S. C. $ 1961(1). WhenRICO was amended in 1984 to include obscenity as a predicate offense, there was no comment or debate in Congresson the First Amendment implications of the change. Act of

signed to curtail a different kind of criminal conduct wentfar beyond the imposition of severe penalties for obscenity

offenses. The result was to render vulnerable to Govern-ment destruction any business daring to deal in sexually explicit materials. The unrestrained power of the forfeiture
weapon was not lost on the Executive Branch, which wasquick to see in the amended statute the means and opportunity to move against certain types of disfavored speech.The Attorney General's Commission on Pornography soon
advocated the use of RICO and similar state statutes to"substantially handicap" or "eliminate" pornography businesses. 1 United States Dept. of Justice, Attorney General's
Commission on Pornography, Final Report 498 (1986). As
these comments illustrate, the constitutional concerns raised
by a penalty of this destructive capacity are distinct from
the concerns raised by traditional methods of punishment.

The Court says that, taken together, our decisions in Fort
Wayne Books and Arcara v. Cloud Books, Inc., 478 U. S. 697
(1986), dispose of petitioner's First Amendment argument.
See ante, at 556-558. But while instructive, neither case is
dispositive. In Fort Wayne Books we considered a state
law patterned on the federal RICO statute, and upheld its
scheme of using obscenity offenses as the predicate acts resulting in fines and jail terms of great severity. We recognized that the fear of severe penalties may result in some
self-censorship by cautious booksellers, but concluded that
this is a necessary consequence of conventional obscenity
prohibitions. 489 U. S., at 60. In rejecting the argument
that the fines and jail terms in Fort Wayne Books infringed
upon First Amendment principles, we regarded the penalties
as equivalent to a sentence enhancement for multiple obscenity violations, a remedy of accepted constitutional legitimacy.
Id., at 59-60. We did not consider in Fort Wayne Books the
First Amendment implications of extensive penal forfeitures,
including the official destruction of protected expression.
Further, while Fort Wayne Books acknowledges that some

Kennedy, J., dissenting
degree of self-censorship may be unavoidable in obscenityregulation, the alarming element of the forfeiture scheme

here is the pervasive danger of government censorship, anissue, I submit, the Court does not confront.

In Arcara, we upheld against First Amendment challengea criminal law requiring the temporary closure of an adult
bookstore as a penal sanction for acts of prostitution occur-ring on the premises. We did not subject the closure penalty to First Amendment scrutiny even though the collateralconsequence of its imposition would be to affect interests
of traditional First Amendment concern. We said that suchscrutiny was not required when a criminal penalty followed
conduct "manifest[ing] absolutely no element of protectedexpression." 478 U. S., at 705. That the RICO prosecution
of Alexander involved the targeting of a particular class ofunlawful speech itself suffices to distinguish the instant case
from Arcara. There can be little doubt that regulation andpunishment of certain classes of unprotected speech have implications for other speech that is close to the proscribed line,speech which is entitled to the protections of the First
Amendment. See Speiser v. Randall, 357 U. S. 513, 525(1958). Further, a sanction requiring the temporary closure
of a bookstore cannot be equated, as it is under the Court'sunfortunate analysis, see

ante, at 556-557, with a forfeiturepunishment mandating its permanent destruction.

B
The majority tries to occupy the high ground by assumingthe role of the defender of the doctrine of prior restraint.

It warns that we disparage the doctrine if we reason fromit. But as an analysis of our prior restraint cases reveals,
our application of the First Amendment has adjusted to meetnew threats to speech. The First Amendment is a rule of
substantive protection, not an artifice of categories. The ad-mitted design and the overt purpose of the forfeiture in this
case are to destroy an entire speech business and all its pro509us3113M 04-04-97 17:55:40 PAGES OPINPGT
566 ALEXANDER v. UNITED STATES

Kennedy, J., dissenting
tected titles, thus depriving the public of access to lawful
expression. This is restraint in more than theory. It is
censorship all too real.

Relying on the distinction between prior restraints and
subsequent punishments, ante, at 548, 553-554, the majority
labels the forfeiture imposed here a punishment and dismisses any further debate over the constitutionality of the
forfeiture penalty under the First Amendment. Our cases
do recognize a distinction between prior restraints and subsequent punishments, but that distinction is neither so rigid
nor so precise that it can bear the weight the Court places
upon it to sustain the destruction of a speech business and
its inventory as a punishment for past expression.

In its simple, most blatant form, a prior restraint is a law
which requires submission of speech to an official who may
grant or deny permission to utter or publish it based upon
its contents. See Staub v. City of Baxley, 355 U. S. 313, 322
(1958); Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson, 343 U. S. 495, 503
(1952); A Quantity of Copies of Books v. Kansas, 378 U. S.
205, 222 (1964) (Harlan, J., dissenting); see also M. Nimmer,
Nimmer on Freedom of Speech $ 4.03, p. 4-14 (1984). In
contrast are laws which punish speech or expression only
after it has occurred and been found unlawful. See Kingsley
Books, Inc. v. Brown, 354 U. S. 436, 440-442 (1957). While
each mechanism, once imposed, may abridge speech in a direct way by suppressing it, or in an indirect way by chilling
its dissemination, we have interpreted the First Amendment
as providing greater protection from prior restraints than
from subsequent punishments. See, e. g., Arcara v. Cloud
Books, Inc., supra, at 705-706; Southeastern Promotions,
Ltd. v. Conrad, 420 U. S. 546, 558-559 (1975); Kingsley
Books, Inc. v. Brown, supra, at 440-442. In Southeastern
Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad, we explained that "[b]ehind the
distinction is a theory deeply etched in our law: a free society
prefers to punish the few who abuse rights of speech after

they break the law than to throttle them and all others be-forehand." 420 U. S., at 559.

It has been suggested that the distinction between priorrestraints and subsequent punishments may have slight utility, see Nimmer, supra, $ 4.04, at 4-18 to 4-25, for in a cer-tain sense every criminal obscenity statute is a prior restraint because of the caution a speaker or bookseller mustexercise to avoid its imposition. See

Vance v. UniversalAmusement Co., 445 U. S. 308, 324 (1980) (

White, J., joinedby
Rehnquist, J., dissenting); see also Jeffries, RethinkingPrior Restraint, 92 Yale L. J. 409, 437 (1982). To be sure,

the term "prior restraint" is not self-defining. One problem,of course, is that some governmental actions may have the
characteristics both of punishment and prior restraint. Ahistorical example is the sentence imposed on Hugh Singleton in 1579 after he had enraged Elizabeth I by printing acertain tract. See F. Siebert, Freedom of the Press in England, 1476-1776, pp. 91-92 (1952). Singleton was condemnedto lose his right hand, thus visiting upon him both a punishment and a disability encumbering all further printing.Though the sentence appears not to have been carried out,
it illustrates that a prior restraint and a subsequent punish-ment may occur together. Despite the concurrent operation
of the two kinds of prohibitions in some cases, the distinctionbetween them persists in our law, and it is instructive here
to inquire why this is so.Early in our legal tradition the source of the distinction
was the English common law, in particular the oft cited pas-sage from William Blackstone's 18th-century Commentaries
on the Laws of England. He observed as follows:

"The liberty of the press is indeed essential to the na-ture of a free state; but this consists in laying no previous restraints upon publications, and not in freedomfrom censure for criminal matter when published.
Every freeman has an undoubted right to lay what senti-ments he pleases before the public: to forbid this, is to

509us3113M 04-04-97 17:55:40 PAGES OPINPGT

Kennedy, J., dissenting
destroy the freedom of the press: but if he publisheswhat is improper, mischievous, or illegal, he must take

the consequence of his own temerity." 4 W. Blackstone,Commentaries *151-*152.

The English law which Blackstone was compiling had cometo distrust prior restraints, but with little accompanying condemnation of subsequent punishments. Part of the explana-tion for this lies in the circumstance that, in the centuries
before Blackstone wrote, prior censorship, including licens-ing, was the means by which the Crown and the Parliament
controlled speech and press. See Siebert, supra, at 56-63,68-74. As those methods were the principal means used by
government to control speech and press, it follows that anunyielding populace would devote its first efforts to avoiding
or repealing restrictions in that form.Even as Blackstone wrote, however, subsequent punishments were replacing the earlier censorship schemes as themechanism for government control over disfavored speech in
England. Whether Blackstone's apparent tolerance of sub-sequent punishments resulted from his acceptance of the
English law as it then existed or his failure to grasp thepotential threat these measures posed to liberty, or both,
subsequent punishment in the broad sweep that he com-mented upon would be in flagrant violation of the principles
of free speech and press that we have come to know andunderstand as being fundamental to our First Amendment
freedoms. Indeed, in the beginning of our Republic, JamesMadison argued against the adoption of Blackstone's definition of free speech under the First Amendment. Said Madi-son: "[T]his idea of the freedom of the press can never be
admitted to be the American idea of it" because a law inflict-ing penalties would have the same effect as a law authorizing
a prior restraint. 6 Writings of James Madison 386 (G. Hunted. 1906).

The enactment of the alien and sedition laws early in ourown history is an unhappy testament to the allure that re509us3113M 04-04-97 17:55:40 PAGES OPINPGT

Kennedy, J., dissenting
strictive measures have for governments tempted to controlthe speech and publications of their people. And our earliest cases tended to repeat the suggestion by Blackstone thatprior restraints were the sole concern of First Amendment
protections. See Patterson v. Colorado ex rel. Attorney
General of Colorado, 205 U. S. 454, 462 (1907); Robertson v.
Baldwin, 165 U. S. 275, 281 (1897). In time, however, the
Court rejected the notion that First Amendment freedomsunder our Constitution are coextensive with liberties available under the common law of England. See Grosjean v.
American Press Co., 297 U. S. 233, 248-249 (1936). From
this came the conclusion that "[t]he protection of the First
Amendment . . . is not limited to the Blackstonian idea that
freedom of the press means only freedom from restraint
prior to publication." Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315
U. S. 568, 572, n. 3 (1942).

As our First Amendment law has developed, we have not
confined the application of the prior restraint doctrine to its
simpler forms, outright licensing or censorship before speech
takes place. In considering governmental measures deviating from the classic form of a prior restraint yet posing many
of the same dangers to First Amendment freedoms, we have
extended prior restraint protection with some latitude, toward the end of declaring certain governmental actions to
fall within the presumption of invalidity. This approach is
evident in Near v. Minnesota ex rel. Olson, 283 U. S. 697
(1931), the leading case in which we invoked the prior restraint doctrine to invalidate a state injunctive decree.

In Near, a Minnesota statute authorized judicial proceedings to abate as a nuisance a " `malicious, scandalous and defamatory newspaper, magazine or other periodical.' " Id., at
701-702. In a suit brought by the attorney for Hennepin
County it was established that Near had published articles
in various editions of The Saturday Press in violation of the
statutory standard. Id., at 703-705. Citing the instance of
these past unlawful publications, the court enjoined any fu509us3113M 04-04-97 17:55:40 PAGES OPINPGT

Kennedy, J., dissenting
ture violations of the state statute. Id., at 705. In onesense the injunctive order, which paralleled the nuisance

statute, did nothing more than announce the conditionsunder which some later punishment might be imposed, for
one presumes that contempt could not be found until there
was a further violation in contravention of the order. Butin

Near the publisher, because of past wrongs, was subjected
to active state intervention for the control of future speech.We found that the scheme was a prior restraint because it

embodied "the essence of censorship." Id., at 713. This un-derstanding is confirmed by our later decision in

Kingsley
Books v. Brown, where we said that it had been enough to
condemn the injunction in Near that Minnesota had "empowered its courts to enjoin the dissemination of future issues of
a publication because its past issues had been found offensive." 354 U. S., at 445.

Indeed the Court has been consistent in adopting a speechprotective definition of prior restraint when the state attempts to attack future speech in retribution for a speaker's
past transgressions. See Vance v. Universal Amusement
Co., 445 U. S. 308 (1980) (per curiam) (invalidating as a prior
restraint procedure authorizing state courts to abate as a
nuisance an adult theater which had exhibited obscene films
in the past because the effect of the procedure was to prevent future exhibitions of pictures not yet found to be obscene). It is a flat misreading of our precedents to declare
as the majority does that the definition of a prior restraint
includes only those measures which impose a "legal impediment," ante, at 551, on a speaker's ability to engage in future
expressive activity. Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan, 372
U. S. 58, 70 (1963), best illustrates the point. There a state
commission did nothing more than warn booksellers that certain titles could be obscene, implying that criminal prosecutions could follow if their warnings were not heeded. The
commission had no formal enforcement powers, and failure
to heed its warnings was not a criminal offense. Although

509us3113M 04-04-97 17:55:40 PAGES OPINPGT

571Cite as: 509 U. S. 544 (1993)
Kennedy, J., dissenting
the commission could impose no legal impediment on aspeaker's ability to engage in future expressive activity, we

held that scheme was an impermissible "system of prior ad-ministrative restraints."

Ibid. There we said: "We are not
the first court to look through forms to the substance and
recognize that informal censorship may sufficiently inhibitthe circulation of publications to warrant injunctive relief."

Id., at 67. If mere warning against sale of certain materialswas a prior restraint, I fail to see why the physical destruction of a speech enterprise and its protected inventory is notcondemned by the same doctrinal principles.

One wonders what today's majority would have done if
faced in Near with a novel argument to extend the traditional conception of the prior restraint doctrine. In view of
the formalistic approach the Court advances today, the Court
likely would have rejected Near's pleas on the theory that
to accept his argument would be to "blur the line separating
prior restraints from subsequent punishments to such a degree that it would be impossible to determine with any certainty whether a particular measure is a prior restraint or
not." Ante, at 554. In so holding the Court would have
ignored, as the Court does today, that the applicability of
First Amendment analysis to a governmental action depends
not alone upon the name by which the action is called, but
upon its operation and effect on the suppression of speech.
Near, supra, at 708 ("[T]he court has regard to substance
and not to mere matters of form, and . . . in accordance with
familiar principles . . . statute[s] must be tested by [their]
operation and effect"). See also Smith v. Daily Mail Publishing Co., 443 U. S. 97, 101 (1979) (the First Amendment's
application to a civil or criminal sanction is not determined
solely by whether that action is viewed "as a prior restraint
or as a penal sanction"); Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v.
Conrad, 420 U. S., at 552-553 (challenged action is "indistinguishable in its censoring effect" from official actions consistently identified as prior restraints); Schneider v. State (Town

Kennedy, J., dissenting
of Irvington), 308 U. S. 147, 161 (1939) ("In every case, therefore, where legislative abridgment of [First Amendment]
rights is asserted, the courts should be astute to examine the
effect of the challenged legislation").

The cited cases identify a progression in our First Amendment jurisprudence which results from a more fundamental
principle. As governments try new ways to subvert essential freedoms, legal and constitutional systems respond by
making more explicit the nature and the extent of the liberty
in question. First in Near, and later in Bantam Books and
Vance, we were faced with official action which did not fall
within the traditional meaning of the term "prior restraint,"
yet posed many of the same censorship dangers. Our response was to hold that the doctrine not only includes licensing schemes requiring speech to be submitted to a censor for
review prior to dissemination, but also encompasses injunctive systems which threaten or bar future speech based on
some past infraction.

Although we consider today a new method of government
control with unmistakable dangers of official censorship, the
majority concludes that First Amendment freedoms are not
endangered because forfeiture follows a lawful conviction for
obscenity offenses. But this explanation does not suffice.
The rights of free speech and press in their broad and legitimate sphere cannot be defeated by the simple expedient of
punishing after in lieu of censoring before. See Smith v.
Daily Mail Publishing Co., supra, at 101-102; Thornhill v.
Alabama, 310 U. S. 88, 101-102 (1940). This is so because
in some instances the operation and effect of a particular
enforcement scheme, though not in the form of a traditional
prior restraint, may be to raise the same concerns which inform all of our prior restraint cases: the evils of state censorship and the unacceptable chilling of protected speech.

The operation and effect of RICO's forfeiture remedies are
different from a heavy fine or a severe jail sentence because

509us3113M 04-04-97 17:55:40 PAGES OPINPGT

573Cite as: 509 U. S. 544 (1993)
Kennedy, J., dissenting
RICO's forfeiture provisions are different in purpose and
kind from ordinary criminal sanctions. See supra, at 563-
565. The Government's stated purpose under RICO, to destroy or incapacitate the offending enterprise, bears a striking resemblance to the motivation for the state nuisance
statute the Court struck down as an impermissible prior restraint in Near. The purpose of the state statute in Near
was "not punishment, in the ordinary sense, but suppression
of the offending newspaper or periodical." 283 U. S., at 711.
In the context of the First Amendment, it is quite odd indeed
to apply a measure implemented not only to deter unlawful
conduct by imposing punishment after violations, but to " `incapacitate, and . . . directly to remove the corrupting influence from the channels of commerce.' " Russello v. United
States, 464 U. S., at 28, quoting 116 Cong. Rec. 18955 (1970)
(remarks of sponsor Sen. McClellan). The particular nature
of Ferris Alexander's activities ought not blind the Court to
what is at stake here. Under the principle the Court adopts,
any bookstore or press enterprise could be forfeited as punishment for even a single obscenity conviction.

Assuming the constitutionality of the mandatory forfeiture
under $ 1963 when applied to nonspeech-related conduct, the
constitutional analysis must be different when that remedy
is imposed for violations of the federal obscenity laws. "Our
decisions furnish examples of legal devices and doctrines, in
most applications consistent with the Constitution, which
cannot be applied in settings where they have the collateral
effect of inhibiting the freedom of expression." Smith v.
California, 361 U. S. 147, 150-151 (1959). The regulation of
obscenity, often separated from protected expression only by
a "dim and uncertain line," must be accomplished through
"procedures that will ensure against the curtailment of constitutionally protected expression." Bantam Books v. Sullivan, 372 U. S., at 66. Because freedoms of expression are
"vulnerable to gravely damaging yet barely visible encroach509us3113M 04-04-97 17:55:40 PAGES OPINPGT
574 ALEXANDER v. UNITED STATES

Kennedy, J., dissenting
ments," ibid., the government must use measures that aresensitive to First Amendment concerns in its task of regulating or punishing speech. Speiser v. Randall, 357 U. S., at525.

Whatever one might label the RICO forfeiture provisions
at issue in this case, be it effective, innovative, or Draconian,$ 1963 was not designed for sensitive and exacting application. What is happening here is simple: Books and films arecondemned and destroyed not for their own content but for
the content of their owner's prior speech. Our law does notpermit the government to burden future speech for this sort
of taint. Section 1963 requires trial courts to forfeit not
only the unlawful items and any proceeds from their sale,
but also the defendant's entire interest in the enterprise involved in the RICO violations and any assets affording the
defendant a source of influence over the enterprise. 18
U. S. C. $$ 1963(a)(1)-(3) (1988 ed. and Supp. III). A defendant's exposure to this massive penalty is grounded on the
commission of just two or more related obscenity offenses
committed within a 10-year period. Aptly described,
RICO's forfeiture provisions "arm prosecutors not with scalpels to excise obscene portions of an adult bookstore's inventory but with sickles to mow down the entire undesired use."
Fort Wayne Books, 489 U. S., at 85 (Stevens, J., concurring
in part and dissenting in part).

What is at work in this case is not the power to punish an
individual for his past transgressions but the authority to
suppress a particular class of disfavored speech. The forfeiture provisions accomplish this in a direct way by seizing
speech presumed to be protected along with the instruments
of its dissemination, and in an indirect way by threatening all
who engage in the business of distributing adult or sexually
explicit materials with the same disabling measures. Cf.
Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Pittsburgh Comm'n on Human Relations, 413 U. S. 376, 390 (1973) (the special vice of the prior
restraint is suppression of speech, either directly or by in509us3113M 04-04-97 17:55:40 PAGES OPINPGT

Kennedy, J., dissenting
ducing caution in the speaker, prior to a determination thatthe targeted speech is unprotected by the First Amendment).

In a society committed to freedom of thought, inquiry, anddiscussion without interference or guidance from the state,
public confidence in the institutions devoted to the dissemination of written matter and films is essential. That confi-dence erodes if it is perceived that speakers and the press

are vulnerable for all of their expression based on some er-rant expression in the past. Independence of speech and
press can be just as compromised by the threat of officialintervention as by the fact of it. See

Bantam Books, Inc. v.
Sullivan, supra, at 70. Though perhaps not in the form of
a classic prior restraint, the application of the forfeiture statute here bears its censorial cast.

Arcara recognized, as the Court today does not, the vital
difference between a punishment imposed for a speech offense and a punishment imposed for some other crime.
Where the government seeks forfeiture of a bookstore because of its owner's drug offenses, there is little reason to
surmise, absent evidence of selective prosecution, that abolishing the bookstore is related to the government's disfavor
of the publication outlet or its activities. Where, however,
RICO forfeiture stems from a previous speech offense, the
punishment serves not only the Government's interest in
purging organized-crime taint, but also its interest in deterring the activities of the speech-related business itself. The
threat of a censorial motive and of ongoing speech supervision by the state justifies the imposition of First Amendment protection. Free speech principles, well established
by our cases, require in this case that the forfeiture of the
inventory and of the speech distribution facilities be held
invalid.

The distinct concern raised by $ 1963 forfeiture penalties
is not a proportionality concern; all punishments are subject
to analysis for proportionality and this concern should be
addressed under the Eighth Amendment. See Austin v.

576 ALEXANDER v. UNITED STATES

Kennedy, J., dissenting
United States, post, p. 602. Here, the question is whether,when imposed as punishment for violation of the federal obscenity laws, the operation of RICO's forfeiture provisionsis an exercise of Government censorship and control over
protected speech as condemned in our prior restraint cases.In my view the effect is just that. For this reason I would
invalidate those portions of the judgment which mandatedthe forfeiture of petitioner's business enterprise and inventory, as well as all property affording him a source of influ-ence over that enterprise.

II
Quite apart from the direct bearing that our prior re-straint cases have on the entire forfeiture that was ordered

in this case, the destruction of books and films that were notobscene and not adjudged to be so is a remedy with no parallel in our cases. The majority says that our cases "establishquite clearly that the First Amendment does not prohibit . . .
forfeiture of expressive materials as punishment for criminalconduct." See

ante, at 555. But the single case cited insupport of this stark new threat to all speech enterprises is

Arcara v. Cloud Books, Inc. Arcara, as discussed, supra,at 565, is quite inapposite. There we found unconvincing the
argument that protected bookselling activities were bur-dened by the closure, saying that the owners "remain free to
sell [and the public remains free to acquire] the same materi-als at another location." 478 U. S., at 705. Alexander and
the public do not have those choices here for a simple reason:The Government has destroyed the inventory. Further, the
sanction in Arcara did not involve a complete confiscation ordestruction of protected expression as did the forfeiture in
this case. Here the inventory forfeited consisted of hun-dreds of original titles and thousands of copies, all of which
are presumed to be protected speech. In fact, some of thematerials seized were the very ones the jury here determined not to be obscene. Even so, all of the inventory wasseized and destroyed.

Even when interim pretrial seizures are used, we havebeen careful to say that First Amendment materials cannot

be taken out of circulation until they have been determinedto be unlawful. "[W]hile the general rule under the Fourth
Amendment is that any and all contraband, instrumentalities, and evidence of crimes may be seized on probable cause. . . , it is otherwise when materials presumptively protected

by the First Amendment are involved." Fort Wayne Books,489 U. S., at 63. See

id., at 65-66; Lo-Ji Sales, Inc. v. New
York, 442 U. S. 319, 326, n. 5 (1979) (the First Amendmentimposes special constraints on searches for, and seizures of,

presumptively protected materials).

In Marcus v. Search Warrant, 367 U. S. 717, 731-733
(1961), we invalidated a mass pretrial seizure of allegedly
obscene publications achieved through a warrant that was
vague and unspecific. The constitutional defect there was
that the seizure was imposed without safeguards necessary
to assure nonobscene material the constitutional protection
to which it is entitled. In similar fashion we invalidated, in
A Quantity of Copies of Books v. Kansas, 378 U. S., at 211-
213, a state procedure authorizing seizure of books alleged to
be obscene prior to hearing, even though the system involved
judicial examination of some of the seized titles. While the
force behind the special protection accorded searches for and
seizures of First Amendment materials is the risk of prior
restraint, see Maryland v. Macon, 472 U. S. 463, 470 (1985),
in substance the rule prevents seizure and destruction of expressive materials in circumstances such as are presented in
this case without an adjudication of their unlawful character.

It follows from the search cases in which the First Amendment required exacting protection, that one title does not
become seizable or tainted because of its proximity on the
shelf to another. And if that is the rule for interim seizures,
it follows with even greater force that protected materials
cannot be destroyed altogether for some alleged taint from
an owner who committed a speech violation. In attempting

Kennedy, J., dissenting
to distinguish the holdings of Marcus and A Quantity ofBooks, the Court describes the constitutional infirmity in

those cases as follows: "[T]he government had seized or oth-erwise restrained materials suspected of being obscene without a prior judicial determination that they were in fact so."
Ante, at 551. But the same constitutional defect is presentin the case before us today, and the Court fails to explain

why it is not fatal to the forfeiture punishment here underreview. Thus, while in the past we invalidated seizures
which resulted in a temporary removal of presumptivelyprotected materials from circulation, today the Court approves of Government measures having the same permanenteffect. In my view, the forfeiture of expressive material
here that had not been adjudged to be obscene, or other-wise without the protection of the First Amendment, was
unconstitutional. * * *

Given the Court's principal holding, I can interpose no ob-jection to remanding the case for further consideration under
the Eighth Amendment. But it is unnecessary to reach theEighth Amendment question. The Court's failure to reverse this flagrant violation of the right of free speech andexpression is a deplorable abandonment of fundamental First
Amendment principles. I dissent from the judgment andfrom the opinion of the Court.

DAUBERT et ux., individually and as guardians

ad litem for DAUBERT, et al. v. MERRELLDOW PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 92-102. Argued March 30, 1993--Decided June 28, 1993
Petitioners, two minor children and their parents, alleged in their suit

against respondent that the children's serious birth defects had been
caused by the mothers' prenatal ingestion of Bendectin, a prescription
drug marketed by respondent. The District Court granted respondent
summary judgment based on a well-credentialed expert's affidavit concluding, upon reviewing the extensive published scientific literature on
the subject, that maternal use of Bendectin has not been shown to be a
risk factor for human birth defects. Although petitioners had responded with the testimony of eight other well-credentialed experts,
who based their conclusion that Bendectin can cause birth defects on
animal studies, chemical structure analyses, and the unpublished "reanalysis" of previously published human statistical studies, the court
determined that this evidence did not meet the applicable "general acceptance" standard for the admission of expert testimony. The Court
of Appeals agreed and affirmed, citing Frye v. United States, 54 App.
D. C. 46, 47, 293 F. 1013, 1014, for the rule that expert opinion based on
a scientific technique is inadmissible unless the technique is "generally
accepted" as reliable in the relevant scientific community.

Held: The Federal Rules of Evidence, not Frye, provide the standard for

admitting expert scientific testimony in a federal trial. Pp. 585-597.

(a) Frye's "general acceptance" test was superseded by the Rules'
adoption. The Rules occupy the field, United States v. Abel, 469 U. S.
45, 49, and, although the common law of evidence may serve as an aid
to their application, id., at 51-52, respondent's assertion that they somehow assimilated Frye is unconvincing. Nothing in the Rules as a whole
or in the text and drafting history of Rule 702, which specifically governs expert testimony, gives any indication that "general acceptance"
is a necessary precondition to the admissibility of scientific evidence.
Moreover, such a rigid standard would be at odds with the Rules' liberal
thrust and their general approach of relaxing the traditional barriers to
"opinion" testimony. Pp. 585-589.

(b) The Rules--especially Rule 702--place appropriate limits on the
admissibility of purportedly scientific evidence by assigning to the trial

Syllabus
judge the task of ensuring that an expert's testimony both rests on a
reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand. The reliability
standard is established by Rule 702's requirement that an expert's testimony pertain to "scientific . . . knowledge," since the adjective "scientific" implies a grounding in science's methods and procedures, while the
word "knowledge" connotes a body of known facts or of ideas inferred
from such facts or accepted as true on good grounds. The Rule's requirement that the testimony "assist the trier of fact to understand the
evidence or to determine a fact in issue" goes primarily to relevance by
demanding a valid scientific connection to the pertinent inquiry as a
precondition to admissibility. Pp. 589-592.

(c) Faced with a proffer of expert scientific testimony under Rule 702,
the trial judge, pursuant to Rule 104(a), must make a preliminary assessment of whether the testimony's underlying reasoning or methodology
is scientifically valid and properly can be applied to the facts at issue.
Many considerations will bear on the inquiry, including whether the theory or technique in question can be (and has been) tested, whether it
has been subjected to peer review and publication, its known or potential error rate and the existence and maintenance of standards controlling its operation, and whether it has attracted widespread acceptance
within a relevant scientific community. The inquiry is a flexible one,
and its focus must be solely on principles and methodology, not on the
conclusions that they generate. Throughout, the judge should also be
mindful of other applicable Rules. Pp. 592-595.

(d) Cross-examination, presentation of contrary evidence, and careful
instruction on the burden of proof, rather than wholesale exclusion
under an uncompromising "general acceptance" standard, is the appropriate means by which evidence based on valid principles may be challenged. That even limited screening by the trial judge, on occasion,
will prevent the jury from hearing of authentic scientific breakthroughs
is simply a consequence of the fact that the Rules are not designed to
seek cosmic understanding but, rather, to resolve legal disputes.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Blackmun delivered the opinion of the Court.
In this case we are called upon to determine the standardfor admitting expert scientific testimony in a federal trial.

I
Petitioners Jason Daubert and Eric Schuller are minorchildren born with serious birth defects. They and their

parents sued respondent in California state court, allegingthat the birth defects had been caused by the mothers' ingestion of Bendectin, a prescription antinausea drug marketedby respondent. Respondent removed the suits to federal
court on diversity grounds.After extensive discovery, respondent moved for summary
judgment, contending that Bendectin does not cause birthdefects in humans and that petitioners would be unable to
come forward with any admissible evidence that it does. Insupport of its motion, respondent submitted an affidavit of
Steven H. Lamm, physician and epidemiologist, who is awell-credentialed expert on the risks from exposure to various chemical substances.1 Doctor Lamm stated that he hadreviewed all the literature on Bendectin and human birth
defects--more than 30 published studies involving over130,000 patients. No study had found Bendectin to be a
human teratogen (i. e., a substance capable of causing malfor-mations in fetuses). On the basis of this review, Doctor
Lamm concluded that maternal use of Bendectin during thefirst trimester of pregnancy has not been shown to be a risk
factor for human birth defects.

Opinion of the Court
Petitioners did not (and do not) contest this characterization of the published record regarding Bendectin. Instead,
they responded to respondent's motion with the testimony
of eight experts of their own, each of whom also possessed
impressive credentials.2 These experts had concluded that
Bendectin can cause birth defects. Their conclusions were
based upon "in vitro" (test tube) and "in vivo" (live) animal
studies that found a link between Bendectin and malformations; pharmacological studies of the chemical structure of
Bendectin that purported to show similarities between the
structure of the drug and that of other substances known to
cause birth defects; and the "reanalysis" of previously published epidemiological (human statistical) studies.

The District Court granted respondent's motion for summary judgment. The court stated that scientific evidence
is admissible only if the principle upon which it is based is
" `sufficiently established to have general acceptance in the
field to which it belongs.' " 727 F. Supp. 570, 572 (SD Cal.
1989), quoting United States v. Kilgus, 571 F. 2d 508, 510
(CA9 1978). The court concluded that petitioners' evidence
did not meet this standard. Given the vast body of epidemiological data concerning Bendectin, the court held, expert opinion which is not based on epidemiological evidence

2 For example, Shanna Helen Swan, who received a master's degree in
biostatistics from Columbia University and a doctorate in statistics from
the University of California at Berkeley, is chief of the section of the California Department of Health and Services that determines causes of birth
defects and has served as a consultant to the World Health Organization,
the Food and Drug Administration, and the National Institutes of Health.
Id., at 113-114, 131-132. Stuart A. Newman, who received his bachelor's
degree in chemistry from Columbia University and his master's and doctorate in chemistry from the University of Chicago, is a professor at New
York Medical College and has spent over a decade studying the effect of

is not admissible to establish causation. 727 F. Supp.,at 575. Thus, the animal-cell studies, live-animal studies,

and chemical-structure analyses on which petitioners had re-lied could not raise by themselves a reasonably disputable
jury issue regarding causation. Ibid. Petitioners' epidemiological analyses, based as they were on recalculations ofdata in previously published studies that had found no causal

link between the drug and birth defects, were ruled to beinadmissible because they had not been published or subjected to peer review. Ibid.The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit
affirmed. 951 F. 2d 1128 (1991). Citing Frye v. United
States, 54 App. D. C. 46, 47, 293 F. 1013, 1014 (1923), the court
stated that expert opinion based on a scientific technique is
inadmissible unless the technique is "generally accepted" as
reliable in the relevant scientific community. 951 F. 2d, at
1129-1130. The court declared that expert opinion based on
a methodology that diverges "significantly from the procedures accepted by recognized authorities in the field . . . cannot be shown to be `generally accepted as a reliable technique.' " Id., at 1130, quoting United States v. Solomon, 753
F. 2d 1522, 1526 (CA9 1985).

The court emphasized that other Courts of Appeals considering the risks of Bendectin had refused to admit reanalyses
of epidemiological studies that had been neither published
nor subjected to peer review. 951 F. 2d, at 1130-1131.
Those courts had found unpublished reanalyses "particularly
problematic in light of the massive weight of the original
published studies supporting [respondent's] position, all of
which had undergone full scrutiny from the scientific community." Id., at 1130. Contending that reanalysis is generally
accepted by the scientific community only when it is subjected to verification and scrutiny by others in the field, the
Court of Appeals rejected petitioners' reanalyses as "unpublished, not subjected to the normal peer review process and
generated solely for use in litigation." Id., at 1131. The

court concluded that petitioners' evidence provided an insuf-ficient foundation to allow admission of expert testimony

that Bendectin caused their injuries and, accordingly, thatpetitioners could not satisfy their burden of proving causation at trial.We granted certiorari, 506 U. S. 914 (1992), in light of
sharp divisions among the courts regarding the properstandard for the admission of expert testimony. Compare,
e. g., United States v. Shorter, 257 U. S. App. D. C. 358, 363-364, 809 F. 2d 54, 59-60 (applying the "general acceptance"

A

In the 70 years since its formulation in the Frye case, the"general acceptance" test has been the dominant standard

for determining the admissibility of novel scientific evidenceat trial. See E. Green & C. Nesson, Problems, Cases, and
Materials on Evidence 649 (1983). Although under increas-ing attack of late, the rule continues to be followed by a majority of courts, including the Ninth Circuit.3The Frye test has its origin in a short and citation-free
1923 decision concerning the admissibility of evidence de-rived from a systolic blood pressure deception test, a crude
precursor to the polygraph machine. In what has become afamous (perhaps infamous) passage, the then Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia described the device andits operation and declared:

"Just when a scientific principle or discovery crosses theline between the experimental and demonstrable stages

is difficult to define. Somewhere in this twilight zonethe evidential force of the principle must be recognized,

and while courts will go a long way in admitting experttestimony deduced from a well-recognized scientific
principle or discovery, the thing from which the deduction is made must be sufficiently established to havegained general acceptance in the particular field in

which it belongs." 54 App. D. C., at 47, 293 F., at 1014(emphasis added).

Because the deception test had "not yet gained such standingand scientific recognition among physiological and psychological authorities as would justify the courts in admitting ex-pert testimony deduced from the discovery, development,
and experiments thus far made," evidence of its results wasruled inadmissible. Ibid.

The merits of the Frye test have been much debated, andscholarship on its proper scope and application is legion.

Opinion of the Court
Petitioners' primary attack, however, is not on the content
but on the continuing authority of the rule. They contend
that the Frye test was superseded by the adoption of the
Federal Rules of Evidence.5 We agree.

We interpret the legislatively enacted Federal Rules of
Evidence as we would any statute. Beech Aircraft Corp. v.
Rainey, 488 U. S. 153, 163 (1988). Rule 402 provides the
baseline:

"All relevant evidence is admissible, except as otherwise provided by the Constitution of the United States,
by Act of Congress, by these rules, or by other rules
prescribed by the Supreme Court pursuant to statutory
authority. Evidence which is not relevant is not
admissible."

"Relevant evidence" is defined as that which has "any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence
to the determination of the action more probable or less
probable than it would be without the evidence." Rule 401.
The Rules' basic standard of relevance thus is a liberal one.

Frye, of course, predated the Rules by half a century. In
United States v. Abel, 469 U. S. 45 (1984), we considered the
pertinence of background common law in interpreting the
Rules of Evidence. We noted that the Rules occupy the
field, id., at 49, but, quoting Professor Cleary, the Reporter,

5 Like the question of Frye's merit, the dispute over its survival has
divided courts and commentators. Compare, e. g., United States v. Williams, 583 F. 2d 1194 (CA2 1978) (Frye is superseded by the Rules of
Evidence), cert. denied, 439 U. S. 1117 (1979), with Christophersen v.

Opinion of the Court
explained that the common law nevertheless could serve asan aid to their application:

" `In principle, under the Federal Rules no common lawof evidence remains. "All relevant evidence is admissible, except as otherwise provided . . . ." In reality, ofcourse, the body of common law knowledge continues to
exist, though in the somewhat altered form of a sourceof guidance in the exercise of delegated powers.' "

Id.,at 51-52.

We found the common-law precept at issue in the Abel caseentirely consistent with Rule 402's general requirement of
admissibility, and considered it unlikely that the drafters hadintended to change the rule. Id., at 50-51. In Bourjaily v.
United States, 483 U. S. 171 (1987), on the other hand, theCourt was unable to find a particular common-law doctrine
in the Rules, and so held it superseded.Here there is a specific Rule that speaks to the contested
issue. Rule 702, governing expert testimony, provides:

"If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledgewill assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence

or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified asan expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or
education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinionor otherwise."

Nothing in the text of this Rule establishes "general accept-ance" as an absolute prerequisite to admissibility. Nor does
respondent present any clear indication that Rule 702 or theRules as a whole were intended to incorporate a "general
acceptance" standard. The drafting history makes no men-tion of Frye, and a rigid "general acceptance" requirement
would be at odds with the "liberal thrust" of the FederalRules and their "general approach of relaxing the traditional
barriers to `opinion' testimony." Beech Aircraft Corp. v.
Rainey, 488 U. S., at 169 (citing Rules 701 to 705). See alsoWeinstein, Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence is

Sound; It Should Not Be Amended, 138 F. R. D. 631 (1991)("The Rules were designed to depend primarily upon

lawyer-adversaries and sensible triers of fact to evaluateconflicts"). Given the Rules' permissive backdrop and their
inclusion of a specific rule on expert testimony that does notmention "general acceptance," the assertion that the Rules
somehow assimilated Frye is unconvincing. Frye made"general acceptance" the exclusive test for admitting expert
scientific testimony. That austere standard, absent from,and incompatible with, the Federal Rules of Evidence, should
not be applied in federal trials.6

B
That the Frye test was displaced by the Rules of Evidencedoes not mean, however, that the Rules themselves place no

limits on the admissibility of purportedly scientific evidence.7Nor is the trial judge disabled from screening such evidence.
To the contrary, under the Rules the trial judge must ensurethat any and all scientific testimony or evidence admitted is
not only relevant, but reliable.The primary locus of this obligation is Rule 702, which
clearly contemplates some degree of regulation of the sub-jects and theories about which an expert may testify. "

Ifscientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to deter-mine a fact in issue" an expert "may testify

thereto." (Em-phasis added.) The subject of an expert's testimony must

6 Because we hold that Frye has been superseded and base the discussion that follows on the content of the congressionally enacted Federal
Rules of Evidence, we do not address petitioners' argument that application of the Frye rule in this diversity case, as the application of a judgemade rule affecting substantive rights, would violate the doctrine of Erie
R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64 (1938).

7 The Chief Justice "do[es] not doubt that Rule 702 confides to the

judge some gatekeeping responsibility," post, at 600, but would neither say
how it does so nor explain what that role entails. We believe the better
course is to note the nature and source of the duty.

be "scientific . . . knowledge." 8 The adjective "scientific"implies a grounding in the methods and procedures of science. Similarly, the word "knowledge" connotes more thansubjective belief or unsupported speculation. The term "applies to any body of known facts or to any body of ideasinferred from such facts or accepted as truths on good
grounds." Webster's Third New International Dictionary1252 (1986). Of course, it would be unreasonable to conclude
that the subject of scientific testimony must be "known" toa certainty; arguably, there are no certainties in science.
See, e. g., Brief for Nicolaas Bloembergen et al. as Amici Curiae 9 ("Indeed, scientists do not assert that they know whatis immutably `true'--they are committed to searching for

new, temporary, theories to explain, as best they can, phe-nomena"); Brief for American Association for the Advancement of Science et al. as Amici Curiae 7-8 ("Science is notan encyclopedic body of knowledge about the universe. Instead, it represents a process for proposing and refining theo-retical explanations about the world that are subject to further testing and refinement" (emphasis in original)). But,in order to qualify as "scientific knowledge," an inference or
assertion must be derived by the scientific method. Pro-posed testimony must be supported by appropriate validation--i. e., "good grounds," based on what is known. Inshort, the requirement that an expert's testimony pertain to
"scientific knowledge" establishes a standard of evidentiaryreliability.

9

8 Rule 702 also applies to "technical, or other specialized knowledge."
Our discussion is limited to the scientific context because that is the nature
of the expertise offered here.

9 We note that scientists typically distinguish between "validity" (does

the principle support what it purports to show?) and "reliability" (does
application of the principle produce consistent results?). See Black, 56
Ford. L. Rev., at 599. Although "the difference between accuracy, validity, and reliability may be such that each is distinct from the other by no
more than a hen's kick," Starrs, Frye v. United States Restructured and

Opinion of the Court
Rule 702 further requires that the evidence or testimony"assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue." This condition goes primarily torelevance. "Expert testimony which does not relate to any
issue in the case is not relevant and, ergo, non-helpful." 3Weinstein & Berger || 702[02], p. 702-18. See also

UnitedStates v. Downing, 753 F. 2d 1224, 1242 (CA3 1985) ("An additional consideration under Rule 702--and another aspect ofrelevancy--is whether expert testimony proffered in the
case is sufficiently tied to the facts of the case that it will aidthe jury in resolving a factual dispute"). The consideration
has been aptly described by Judge Becker as one of "fit."
Ibid. "Fit" is not always obvious, and scientific validity forone purpose is not necessarily scientific validity for other,

unrelated purposes. See Starrs, Frye v. United States Re-structured and Revitalized: A Proposal to Amend Federal
Evidence Rule 702, 26 Jurimetrics J. 249, 258 (1986). Thestudy of the phases of the moon, for example, may provide
valid scientific "knowledge" about whether a certain night
was dark, and if darkness is a fact in issue, the knowledgewill assist the trier of fact. However (absent creditable

grounds supporting such a link), evidence that the moon wasfull on a certain night will not assist the trier of fact in determining whether an individual was unusually likely to havebehaved irrationally on that night. Rule 702's "helpfulness"

rics J. 249, 256 (1986), our reference here is to evidentiary reliability--
that is, trustworthiness. Cf., e. g., Advisory Committee's Notes on Fed.
Rule Evid. 602, 28 U. S. C. App., p. 755 (" `[T]he rule requiring that a witness who testifies to a fact which can be perceived by the senses must
have had an opportunity to observe, and must have actually observed the
fact' is a `most pervasive manifestation' of the common law insistence upon
`the most reliable sources of information' " (citation omitted)); Advisory
Committee's Notes on Art. VIII of Rules of Evidence, 28 U. S. C. App.,
p. 770 (hearsay exceptions will be recognized only "under circumstances
supposed to furnish guarantees of trustworthiness"). In a case involving
scientific evidence, evidentiary reliability will be based upon scientific
validity.

standard requires a valid scientific connection to the perti-nent inquiry as a precondition to admissibility.

That these requirements are embodied in Rule 702 is notsurprising. Unlike an ordinary witness, see Rule 701, an
expert is permitted wide latitude to offer opinions, includingthose that are not based on firsthand knowledge or observation. See Rules 702 and 703. Presumably, this relaxationof the usual requirement of firsthand knowledge--a rule
which represents "a `most pervasive manifestation' of thecommon law insistence upon `the most reliable sources of information,' " Advisory Committee's Notes on Fed. Rule Evid.602, 28 U. S. C. App., p. 755 (citation omitted)--is premised
on an assumption that the expert's opinion will have a reli-able basis in the knowledge and experience of his discipline.

C
Faced with a proffer of expert scientific testimony, then,the trial judge must determine at the outset, pursuant to

Rule 104(a),10 whether the expert is proposing to testify to(1) scientific knowledge that (2) will assist the trier of fact
to understand or determine a fact in issue.11 This entails apreliminary assessment of whether the reasoning or method10 Rule 104(a) provides:
"Preliminary questions concerning the qualification of a person to be a
witness, the existence of a privilege, or the admissibility of evidence shall
be determined by the court, subject to the provisions of subdivision (b)
[pertaining to conditional admissions]. In making its determination it is
not bound by the rules of evidence except those with respect to privileges." These matters should be established by a preponderance of proof.
See Bourjaily v. United States, 483 U. S. 171, 175-176 (1987).

11 Although the Frye decision itself focused exclusively on "novel" scientific techniques, we do not read the requirements of Rule 702 to apply
specially or exclusively to unconventional evidence. Of course, wellestablished propositions are less likely to be challenged than those that
are novel, and they are more handily defended. Indeed, theories that are
so firmly established as to have attained the status of scientific law, such as
the laws of thermodynamics, properly are subject to judicial notice under
Federal Rule of Evidence 201.

Opinion of the Court
ology underlying the testimony is scientifically valid and ofwhether that reasoning or methodology properly can be applied to the facts in issue. We are confident that federaljudges possess the capacity to undertake this review. Many
factors will bear on the inquiry, and we do not presume to
set out a definitive checklist or test. But some general ob-servations are appropriate.

Ordinarily, a key question to be answered in determiningwhether a theory or technique is scientific knowledge that
will assist the trier of fact will be whether it can be (andhas been) tested. "Scientific methodology today is based on
generating hypotheses and testing them to see if they can
be falsified; indeed, this methodology is what distinguishes
science from other fields of human inquiry." Green 645.
See also C. Hempel, Philosophy of Natural Science 49 (1966)
("[T]he statements constituting a scientific explanation must
be capable of empirical test"); K. Popper, Conjectures and
Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge 37 (5th ed.
1989) ("[T]he criterion of the scientific status of a theory

is its falsifiability, or refutability, or testability") (emphasis
deleted).

Another pertinent consideration is whether the theory or
technique has been subjected to peer review and publication.
Publication (which is but one element of peer review) is not
a sine qua non of admissibility; it does not necessarily correlate with reliability, see S. Jasanoff, The Fifth Branch: Science Advisors as Policymakers 61-76 (1990), and in some instances well-grounded but innovative theories will not have
been published, see Horrobin, The Philosophical Basis of
Peer Review and the Suppression of Innovation, 263 JAMA
1438 (1990). Some propositions, moreover, are too particular, too new, or of too limited interest to be published. But
submission to the scrutiny of the scientific community is a
component of "good science," in part because it increases the
likelihood that substantive flaws in methodology will be detected. See J. Ziman, Reliable Knowledge: An Exploration

Opinion of the Court
of the Grounds for Belief in Science 130-133 (1978); Rel-man & Angell, How Good Is Peer Review?, 321 New Eng. J.

Med. 827 (1989). The fact of publication (or lack thereof) ina peer reviewed journal thus will be a relevant, though not
dispositive, consideration in assessing the scientific validityof a particular technique or methodology on which an opinion
is premised.Additionally, in the case of a particular scientific technique,
the court ordinarily should consider the known or potentialrate of error, see,

e. g., United States v. Smith, 869 F. 2d 348,353-354 (CA7 1989) (surveying studies of the error rate of

spectrographic voice identification technique), and the exist-ence and maintenance of standards controlling the technique's operation, see United States v. Williams, 583 F. 2d1194, 1198 (CA2 1978) (noting professional organization's
standard governing spectrographic analysis), cert. denied,439 U. S. 1117 (1979).

Finally, "general acceptance" can yet have a bearing onthe inquiry. A "reliability assessment does not require, although it does permit, explicit identification of a relevant sci-entific community and an express determination of a particular degree of acceptance within that community." UnitedStates v. Downing, 753 F. 2d, at 1238. See also 3 Weinstein & Berger || 702[03], pp. 702-41 to 702-42. Widespreadacceptance can be an important factor in ruling particular
evidence admissible, and "a known technique which has beenable to attract only minimal support within the community,"
Downing, 753 F. 2d, at 1238, may properly be viewed withskepticism.

The inquiry envisioned by Rule 702 is, we emphasize, aflexible one.

12 Its overarching subject is the scientific valid12 A number of authorities have presented variations on the reliability
approach, each with its own slightly different set of factors. See, e. g.,
Downing, 753 F. 2d, at 1238-1239 (on which our discussion draws in part);

ity--and thus the evidentiary relevance and reliability--ofthe principles that underlie a proposed submission. The

focus, of course, must be solely on principles and methodol-ogy, not on the conclusions that they generate.

Throughout, a judge assessing a proffer of expert scientifictestimony under Rule 702 should also be mindful of other
applicable rules. Rule 703 provides that expert opinionsbased on otherwise inadmissible hearsay are to be admitted
only if the facts or data are "of a type reasonably relied uponby experts in the particular field in forming opinions or inferences upon the subject." Rule 706 allows the court at itsdiscretion to procure the assistance of an expert of its own
choosing. Finally, Rule 403 permits the exclusion of rele-vant evidence "if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of theissues, or misleading the jury . . . ." Judge Weinstein has
explained: "Expert evidence can be both powerful and quitemisleading because of the difficulty in evaluating it. Because of this risk, the judge in weighing possible prejudiceagainst probative force under Rule 403 of the present rules
exercises more control over experts than over lay wit-nesses." Weinstein, 138 F. R. D., at 632.

III
We conclude by briefly addressing what appear to be twounderlying concerns of the parties and

amici in this case.Respondent expresses apprehension that abandonment of

"general acceptance" as the exclusive requirement for admis-sion will result in a "free-for-all" in which befuddled juries
are confounded by absurd and irrational pseudoscientific asing a New Approach to Admissibility, 67 Iowa L. Rev. 879, 911-912 (1982);
and Symposium on Science and the Rules of Evidence, 99 F. R. D. 187, 231
(1983) (statement by Margaret Berger). To the extent that they focus on
the reliability of evidence as ensured by the scientific validity of its underlying principles, all these versions may well have merit, although we express no opinion regarding any of their particular details.

sertions. In this regard respondent seems to us to be overlypessimistic about the capabilities of the jury and of the

adversary system generally. Vigorous cross-examination,presentation of contrary evidence, and careful instruction on
the burden of proof are the traditional and appropriate
means of attacking shaky but admissible evidence. See
Rock v. Arkansas, 483 U. S. 44, 61 (1987). Additionally, in
the event the trial court concludes that the scintilla of evi-dence presented supporting a position is insufficient to allow

a reasonable juror to conclude that the position more likelythan not is true, the court remains free to direct a judgment,
Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 50(a), and likewise to grant summary
judgment, Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56. Cf., e. g., Turpin v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 959 F. 2d 1349 (CA6) (holding that scientific evidence that provided foundation for
expert testimony, viewed in the light most favorable to
plaintiffs, was not sufficient to allow a jury to find it more
probable than not that defendant caused plaintiff 's injury),
cert. denied, 506 U. S. 826 (1992); Brock v. Merrell Dow
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 874 F. 2d 307 (CA5 1989) (reversing
judgment entered on jury verdict for plaintiffs because
evidence regarding causation was insufficient), modified, 884
F. 2d 166 (CA5 1989), cert. denied, 494 U. S. 1046 (1990);
Green 680-681. These conventional devices, rather than
wholesale exclusion under an uncompromising "general acceptance" test, are the appropriate safeguards where the
basis of scientific testimony meets the standards of Rule 702.

Petitioners and, to a greater extent, their amici exhibit
a different concern. They suggest that recognition of a
screening role for the judge that allows for the exclusion of
"invalid" evidence will sanction a stifling and repressive scientific orthodoxy and will be inimical to the search for truth.
See, e. g., Brief for Ronald Bayer et al. as Amici Curiae. It

for truth in the laboratory. Scientific conclusions are sub-ject to perpetual revision. Law, on the other hand, must

resolve disputes finally and quickly. The scientific projectis advanced by broad and wide-ranging consideration of a
multitude of hypotheses, for those that are incorrect willeventually be shown to be so, and that in itself is an advance.
Conjectures that are probably wrong are of little use, how-ever, in the project of reaching a quick, final, and binding
legal judgment--often of great consequence--about a partic-ular set of events in the past. We recognize that, in practice, a gatekeeping role for the judge, no matter how flexible,inevitably on occasion will prevent the jury from learning of
authentic insights and innovations. That, nevertheless, isthe balance that is struck by Rules of Evidence designed not
for the exhaustive search for cosmic understanding but forthe particularized resolution of legal disputes.

IV
To summarize: "General acceptance" is not a necessaryprecondition to the admissibility of scientific evidence under

the Federal Rules of Evidence, but the Rules of Evidence--especially Rule 702--do assign to the trial judge the task of
ensuring that an expert's testimony both rests on a reliablefoundation and is relevant to the task at hand. Pertinent
evidence based on scientifically valid principles will satisfythose demands.

The inquiries of the District Court and the Court of Ap-peals focused almost exclusively on "general acceptance," as
gauged by publication and the decisions of other courts. Ac13 This is not to say that judicial interpretation, as opposed to adjudicative factfinding, does not share basic characteristics of the scientific endeavor: "The work of a judge is in one sense enduring and in another
ephemeral. . . . In the endless process of testing and retesting, there is a
constant rejection of the dross and a constant retention of whatever is
pure and sound and fine." B. Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process

cordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated,and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent

with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice Stevens joins, concurring in part and dissenting in part.

The petition for certiorari in this case presents two questions: first, whether the rule of Frye v. United States, 54
App. D. C. 46, 293 F. 1013 (1923), remains good law after the
enactment of the Federal Rules of Evidence; and second, if
Frye remains valid, whether it requires expert scientific testimony to have been subjected to a peer review process in
order to be admissible. The Court concludes, correctly in
my view, that the Frye rule did not survive the enactment
of the Federal Rules of Evidence, and I therefore join Parts
I and II-A of its opinion. The second question presented in
the petition for certiorari necessarily is mooted by this holding, but the Court nonetheless proceeds to construe Rules
702 and 703 very much in the abstract, and then offers some
"general observations." Ante, at 593.

"General observations" by this Court customarily carry
great weight with lower federal courts, but the ones offered
here suffer from the flaw common to most such observations--they are not applied to deciding whether particular
testimony was or was not admissible, and therefore they tend
to be not only general, but vague and abstract. This is particularly unfortunate in a case such as this, where the ultimate legal question depends on an appreciation of one or
more bodies of knowledge not judicially noticeable, and subject to different interpretations in the briefs of the parties
and their amici. Twenty-two amicus briefs have been filed
in the case, and indeed the Court's opinion contains no fewer
than 37 citations to amicus briefs and other secondary
sources.

599Cite as: 509 U. S. 579 (1993)
Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.
The various briefs filed in this case are markedly different
from typical briefs, in that large parts of them do not deal
with decided cases or statutory language--the sort of material we customarily interpret. Instead, they deal with definitions of scientific knowledge, scientific method, scientific
validity, and peer review--in short, matters far afield from
the expertise of judges. This is not to say that such materials are not useful or even necessary in deciding how Rule
702 should be applied; but it is to say that the unusual subject matter should cause us to proceed with great caution in
deciding more than we have to, because our reach can so
easily exceed our grasp.

But even if it were desirable to make "general observations" not necessary to decide the questions presented, I cannot subscribe to some of the observations made by the Court.
In Part II-B, the Court concludes that reliability and relevancy are the touchstones of the admissibility of expert testimony. Ante, at 590-592. Federal Rule of Evidence 402
provides, as the Court points out, that "[e]vidence which is
not relevant is not admissible." But there is no similar reference in the Rule to "reliability." The Court constructs its
argument by parsing the language "[i]f scientific, technical,
or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to
understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, . . .
an expert . . . may testify thereto . . . ." Fed. Rule Evid.
702. It stresses that the subject of the expert's testimony
must be "scientific . . . knowledge," and points out that "scientific" "implies a grounding in the methods and procedures
of science" and that the word "knowledge" "connotes more
than subjective belief or unsupported speculation." Ante,
at 590. From this it concludes that "scientific knowledge"
must be "derived by the scientific method." Ibid. Proposed testimony, we are told, must be supported by "appropriate validation." Ibid. Indeed, in footnote 9, the Court
decides that "[i]n a case involving scientific evidence, eviden509us3114F 03-12-96 11:56:18 PAGES OPINPGT
600 DAUBERT v. MERRELL DOW PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.
tiary reliability will be based upon scientific validity."
Ante, at 591, n. 9 (emphasis in original).

Questions arise simply from reading this part of theCourt's opinion, and countless more questions will surely

arise when hundreds of district judges try to apply its teaching to particular offers of expert testimony. Does all of this
dicta apply to an expert seeking to testify on the basis of
"technical or other specialized knowledge"--the other typesof expert knowledge to which Rule 702 applies--or are the

"general observations" limited only to "scientific knowl-edge"? What is the difference between scientific knowledge
and technical knowledge; does Rule 702 actually contemplate
that the phrase "scientific, technical, or other specialized
knowledge" be broken down into numerous subspecies of
expertise, or did its authors simply pick general descriptive
language covering the sort of expert testimony which courts
have customarily received? The Court speaks of its confidence that federal judges can make a "preliminary assessment of whether the reasoning or methodology underlying
the testimony is scientifically valid and of whether that reasoning or methodology properly can be applied to the facts
in issue." Ante, at 592-593. The Court then states that a
"key question" to be answered in deciding whether something is "scientific knowledge" "will be whether it can be (and
has been) tested." Ante, at 593. Following this sentence
are three quotations from treatises, which not only speak of
empirical testing, but one of which states that the " `criterion
of the scientific status of a theory is its falsifiability, or refutability, or testability.' " Ibid.

I defer to no one in my confidence in federal judges; but I
am at a loss to know what is meant when it is said that the
scientific status of a theory depends on its "falsifiability," and
I suspect some of them will be, too.

I do not doubt that Rule 702 confides to the judge some
gatekeeping responsibility in deciding questions of the admissibility of proffered expert testimony. But I do not think

it imposes on them either the obligation or the authority tobecome amateur scientists in order to perform that role. I

think the Court would be far better advised in this case todecide only the questions presented, and to leave the further
development of this important area of the law to futurecases.

AUSTIN v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eighth circuit

No. 92-6073. Argued April 20, 1993--Decided June 28, 1993
After a state court sentenced petitioner Austin on his guilty plea to one

count of possessing cocaine with intent to distribute in violation of South
Dakota law, the United States filed an in rem action in Federal District
Court against his mobile home and auto body shop under 21 U. S. C.

$$ 881(a)(4) and (a)(7), which provide for the forfeiture of, respectively,
vehicles and real property used, or intended to be used, to facilitate the
commission of certain drug-related crimes. In granting the Government summary judgment on the basis of an officer's affidavit that Austin
had brought two grams of cocaine from the mobile home to the body
shop in order to consummate a prearranged sale there, the court rejected Austin's argument that forfeiture of his properties would violate
the Eighth Amendment's Excessive Fines Clause. The Court of Appeals affirmed, agreeing with the Government that the Eighth Amendment is inapplicable to in rem civil forfeitures.

Held:

1. Forfeiture under $$ 881(a)(4) and (a)(7) is a monetary punishment
and, as such, is subject to the limitations of the Excessive Fines
Clause. Pp. 606-622.

(a) The determinative question is not, as the Government would
have it, whether forfeiture under $$ 881(a)(4) and (a)(7) is civil or criminal. The Eighth Amendment's text is not expressly limited to criminal
cases, and its history does not require such a limitation. Rather, the
crucial question is whether the forfeiture is monetary punishment, with
which the Excessive Fines Clause is particularly concerned. Because
sanctions frequently serve more than one purpose, the fact that a forfeiture serves remedial goals will not exclude it from the Clause's purview,
so long as it can only be explained as serving in part to punish. See
United States v. Halper, 490 U. S. 435, 448. Thus, consideration must
be given to whether, at the time the Eighth Amendment was ratified,
forfeiture was understood at least in part as punishment and whether
forfeiture under $$ 881(a)(4) and (a)(7) should be so understood today.
Pp. 606-611.

(b) A review of English and American law before, at the time of,
and following the ratification of the Eighth Amendment demonstrates
that forfeiture generally, and statutory in rem forfeiture in particular,

603Cite as: 509 U. S. 602 (1993)
Syllabus
historically have been understood, at least in part, as punishment. See,
e. g., Peisch v. Ware, 4 Cranch 347, 364. The same understanding runs
through this Court's cases rejecting the "innocence" of the owner as a
common-law defense to forfeiture. See, e. g., Calero-Toledo v. Pearson
Yacht Leasing Co., 416 U. S. 663, 683, 686, 687. Pp. 611-618.

(c) Forfeitures under $$ 881(a)(4) and (a)(7) are properly considered
punishment today, since nothing in these provisions contradicts the historical understanding, since both sections clearly focus on the owner's
culpability by expressly providing "innocent owner" defenses and by
tying forfeiture directly to the commission of drug offenses, and since
the legislative history confirms that Congress understood the provisions
as serving to deter and to punish. Thus, even assuming that the sections serve some remedial purpose, it cannot be concluded that forfeiture under the sections serves only that purpose. Pp. 619-622.

2. The Court declines to establish a test for determining whether a
forfeiture is constitutionally "excessive," since prudence dictates that
the lower courts be allowed to consider that question in the first instance. Pp. 622-623.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Blackmun delivered the opinion of the Court.
In this case, we are asked to decide whether the Excessive
Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment applies to forfeitures
of property under 21 U. S. C. $$ 881(a)(4) and (a)(7). We hold
that it does and therefore remand the case for consideration
of the question whether the forfeiture at issue here was
excessive.

I

On August 2, 1990, petitioner Richard Lyle Austin was indicted on four counts of violating South Dakota's drug laws.
Austin ultimately pleaded guilty to one count of possessing
cocaine with intent to distribute and was sentenced by the
state court to seven years' imprisonment. On September 7,

Opinion of the Court
U. S. C. $$ 881(a)(4) and (a)(7).1 Austin filed a claim and ananswer to the complaint.

On February 4, 1991, the United States made a motion,supported by an affidavit from Sioux Falls Police Officer
Donald Satterlee, for summary judgment. According toSatterlee's affidavit, Austin met Keith Engebretson at Austin's body shop on June 13, 1990, and agreed to sell cocaineto Engebretson. Austin left the shop, went to his mobile
home, and returned to the shop with two grams of cocainewhich he sold to Engebretson. State authorities executed a
search warrant on the body shop and mobile home the follow-ing day. They discovered small amounts of marijuana and
cocaine, a .22 caliber revolver, drug paraphernalia, and ap-proximately $4,700 in cash. App. 13. In opposing summary
judgment, Austin argued that forfeiture of the propertieswould violate the Eighth Amendment.

2 The District Court

rejected this argument and entered summary judgment forthe United States.

Id., at 19.The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit

"reluctantly agree[d] with the government" and affirmed.

1 These statutes provide for the forfeiture of:
"(4) All conveyances, including aircraft, vehicles, or vessels, which are
used, or are intended for use, to transport, or in any manner to facilitate
the transportation, sale, receipt, possession, or concealment of [controlled
substances, their raw materials, and equipment used in their manufacture
and distribution]. . . . .

"(7) All real property, including any right, title, and interest (including any leasehold interest) in the whole of any lot or tract of land and
any appurtenances or improvements, which is used, or intended to be
used, in any manner or part, to commit, or to facilitate the commission
of, a violation of this subchapter punishable by more than one year's
imprisonment . . . ."

Each provision has an "innocent owner" exception. See $$ 881(a)(4)(C)
and (a)(7).

cruel and unusual punishments inflicted." U. S. Const., Amdt. 8.

Opinion of the Court
United States v. One Parcel of Property, 964 F. 2d 814, 817(1992). Although it thought that "the principle of proportionality should be applied in civil actions that result in harshpenalties," ibid., and that the Government was "exacting too
high a penalty in relation to the offense committed," id., at818, the court felt constrained from holding the forfeiture
unconstitutional. It cited this Court's decision in CaleroToledo v. Pearson Yacht Leasing Co., 416 U. S. 663 (1974),for the proposition that, when the Government is proceeding

against property in rem, the guilt or innocence of the proper-ty's owner "is constitutionally irrelevant." 964 F. 2d, at 817.
It then reasoned: "We are constrained to agree with theNinth Circuit that `[i]f the constitution allows

in rem forfeit-ure to be visited upon innocent owners . . . the constitution

hardly requires proportionality review of forfeitures.' "Ibid., quoting United States v. Tax Lot 1500, 861 F. 2d 232,

We granted certiorari, 506 U. S. 1074 (1993), to resolve anapparent conflict with the Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit over the applicability of the Eighth Amendment to
in rem civil forfeitures. See United States v. Certain RealProperty, 954 F. 2d 29, 35, 38-39, cert. denied sub nom.

Austin contends that the Eighth Amendment's ExcessiveFines Clause applies to

in rem civil forfeiture proceedings.See Brief for Petitioner 10, 19, 23. We have had occasion to

consider this Clause only once before. In Browning-Ferris
Industries of Vt., Inc. v. Kelco Disposal, Inc., 492 U. S. 257(1989), we held that the Excessive Fines Clause does not

limit the award of punitive damages to a private party in acivil suit when the government neither has prosecuted the
action nor has any right to receive a share of the damages.Id., at 264. The Court's opinion and

Opinion of the Court
opinion, concurring in part and dissenting in part, reviewedin some detail the history of the Excessive Fines Clause.

See id., at 264-268, 286-297. The Court concluded that boththe Eighth Amendment and $ 10 of the English Bill of Rights
of 1689, from which it derives, were intended to prevent the
government from abusing its power to punish, see id., at266-267, and therefore that "the Excessive Fines Clause was

intended to limit only those fines directly imposed by, andpayable to, the government," id., at 268.

3

We found it unnecessary to decide in Browning-Ferriswhether the Excessive Fines Clause applies only to criminal

cases. Id., at 263. The United States now argues that

"any claim that the government's conduct in a civil pro-ceeding is limited by the Eighth Amendment generally,

or by the Excessive Fines Clause in particular, must failunless the challenged governmental action, despite its
label, would have been recognized as a criminal punish-ment at the time the Eighth Amendment was adopted."
Brief for United States 16 (emphasis added).
It further suggests that the Eighth Amendment cannotapply to a civil proceeding unless that proceeding is so punitive that it must be considered criminal under Kennedy v.Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U. S. 144 (1963), and United States
v. Ward, 448 U. S. 242 (1980). Brief for United States 26-27.We disagree.

Some provisions of the Bill of Rights are expresslylimited to criminal cases. The Fifth Amendment's SelfIncrimination Clause, for example, provides: "No person . . .shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness

3 In Browning-Ferris, we left open the question whether the Excessive
Fines Clause applies to qui tam actions in which a private party brings
suit in the name of the United States and shares in the proceeds. See
492 U. S., at 276, n. 21. Because the instant suit was prosecuted by the
United States and because Austin's property was forfeited to the United
States, we have no occasion to address that question here.

Opinion of the Court
against himself." The protections provided by the SixthAmendment are explicitly confined to "criminal prosecutions." See generally Ward, 448 U. S., at 248.4 The text ofthe Eighth Amendment includes no similar limitation. See
n. 2, supra.Nor does the history of the Eighth Amendment require
such a limitation. Justice O'Connor noted in BrowningFerris: "Consideration of the Eighth Amendment imme-diately followed consideration of the Fifth Amendment.

4 As a general matter, this Court's decisions applying constitutional protections to civil forfeiture proceedings have adhered to this distinction
between provisions that are limited to criminal proceedings and provisions
that are not. Thus, the Court has held that the Fourth Amendment's
protection against unreasonable searches and seizures applies in forfeiture
proceedings, see One 1958 Plymouth Sedan v. Pennsylvania, 380 U. S.
693, 696 (1965); Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 616, 634 (1886), but that
the Sixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause does not, see United States
v. Zucker, 161 U. S. 475, 480-482 (1896). It has also held that the due
process requirement that guilt in a criminal proceeding be proved beyond
a reasonable doubt, see In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358 (1970), does not apply
to civil forfeiture proceedings. See Lilienthal's Tobacco v. United States,
97 U. S. 237, 271-272 (1878).

The Double Jeopardy Clause has been held not to apply in civil forfeiture proceedings, but only in cases where the forfeiture could properly be
characterized as remedial. See United States v. One Assortment of 89
Firearms, 465 U. S. 354, 364 (1984); One Lot Emerald Cut Stones v.
United States, 409 U. S. 232, 237 (1972); see generally United States v.
Halper, 490 U. S. 435, 446-449 (1989) (Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits
second sanction that may not fairly be characterized as remedial). Conversely, the Fifth Amendment's Self-Incrimination Clause, which is textually limited to "criminal case[s]," has been applied in civil forfeiture proceedings, but only where the forfeiture statute had made the culpability
of the owner relevant, see United States v. United States Coin & Currency, 401 U. S. 715, 721-722 (1971), or where the owner faced the possibility of subsequent criminal proceedings, see Boyd, 116 U. S., at 634; see
also United States v. Ward, 448 U. S. 242, 253-254 (1980) (discussing Boyd).

And, of course, even those protections associated with criminal cases
may apply to a civil forfeiture proceeding if it is so punitive that the
proceeding must reasonably be considered criminal. See Kennedy v.
Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U. S. 144 (1963); Ward, supra.

Opinion of the Court
Af ter deciding to confine the benefits of the Self-Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendment to criminal

proceedings, the Framers turned their attention to theEighth Amendment. There were no proposals to limit that
Amendment to criminal proceedings . . . ." 492 U. S., at 294.Section 10 of the English Bill of Rights of 1689 is not expressly limited to criminal cases either. The original draftof $ 10 as introduced in the House of Commons did contain
such a restriction, but only with respect to the bail clause:"The requiring excessive Bail of Persons committed in criminal Cases, and imposing excessive Fines, and illegal Punish-ments, to be prevented." 10 H. C. Jour. 17 (1688). The
absence of any similar restriction in the other two clausessuggests that they were not limited to criminal cases. In
the final version, even the reference to criminal cases in thebail clause was omitted. See 1 W. & M., 2d Sess., ch. 2, 3
Stat. at Large 441 (1689) ("That excessive Bail ought not tobe required, nor excessive Fines imposed; nor cruel and unusual Punishments inflicted"); see also L. Schwoerer, TheDeclaration of Rights, 1689, p. 88 (1981) ("But article 10 contains no reference to `criminal cases' and, thus, would seemto apply . . . to all cases").

5

The purpose of the Eighth Amendment, putting the BailClause to one side, was to limit the government's power to

punish. See Browning-Ferris, 492 U. S., at 266-267, 275.The Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause is self-evidently
concerned with punishment. The Excessive Fines Clauselimits the government's power to extract payments, whether

5 In Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U. S. 651 (1977), we concluded that the
omission of any reference to criminal cases in $ 10 was without substantive
significance in light of the preservation of a similar reference to criminal
cases in the preamble to the English Bill of Rights. Id., at 665. This
reference in the preamble, however, related only to excessive bail. See 1
W. & M., 2d Sess., ch. 2, 3 Stat. at Large 440 (1689). Moreover, the preamble appears designed to catalog the misdeeds of James II, see ibid., rather
than to define the scope of the substantive rights set out in subsequent
sections.

in cash or in kind, "as punishment for some offense." Id.,at 265 (emphasis added). "The notion of punishment, as we

commonly understand it, cuts across the division betweenthe civil and the criminal law." United States v. Halper, 490
U. S. 435, 447-448 (1989). "It is commonly understood thatcivil proceedings may advance punitive as well as remedial
goals, and, conversely, that both punitive and remedial goalsmay be served by criminal penalties."

Id., at 447. See alsoUnited States ex rel. Marcus v. Hess, 317 U. S. 537, 554 (1943)

(Frankfurter, J., concurring). Thus, the question is not, asthe United States would have it, whether forfeiture under

$$ 881(a)(4) and (a)(7) is civil or criminal, but rather whetherit is punishment.

6

In considering this question, we are mindful of the factthat sanctions frequently serve more than one purpose. We

need not exclude the possibility that a forfeiture serves re-medial purposes to conclude that it is subject to the limitations of the Excessive Fines Clause. We, however, must de-termine that it can only be explained as serving in part to
punish. We said in Halper that "a civil sanction that cannotfairly be said solely to serve a remedial purpose, but rather

ratified, forfeiture was understood at least in part as punish6 For this reason, the United States' reliance on Kennedy v. MendozaMartinez and United States v. Ward is misplaced. The question in those
cases was whether a nominally civil penalty should be reclassified as criminal and the safeguards that attend a criminal prosecution should be required. See Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U. S., at 167, 184; Ward, 448 U. S., at
248. In addressing the separate question whether punishment is being
imposed, the Court has not employed the tests articulated in MendozaMartinez and Ward. See, e. g., United States v. Halper, 490 U. S., at 447.
Since in this case we deal only with the question whether the Eighth
Amendment's Excessive Fines Clause applies, we need not address the
application of those tests.

ment and whether forfeiture under $$ 881(a)(4) and (a)(7)should be so understood today.

III

A

Three kinds of forfeiture were established in England atthe time the Eighth Amendment was ratified in the United

States: deodand, forfeiture upon conviction for a felony ortreason, and statutory forfeiture. See

Calero-Toledo, 416U. S., at 680-683. Each was understood, at least in part, as

imposing punishment.

"At common law the value of an inanimate object di-rectly or indirectly causing the accidental death of a

King's subject was forfeited to the Crown as a deodand.The origins of the deodand are traceable to Biblical and
pre-Judeo-Christian practices, which reflected the viewthat the instrument of death was accused and that religious expiation was required. See O. Holmes, TheCommon Law, c. 1 (1881). The value of the instrument
was forfeited to the King, in the belief that the Kingwould provide the money for Masses to be said for the
good of the dead man's soul, or insure that the deodandwas put to charitable uses. 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *300. When application of the deodand to reli-gious or eleemosynary purposes ceased, and the deodand
became a source of Crown revenue, the institution wasjustified as a penalty for carelessness."

Id., at 680-681(footnotes omitted).

As Blackstone put it, "such misfortunes are in part owing tothe negligence of the owner, and therefore he is properly
punished by such forfeiture." 1 W. Blackstone, Commentar-ies *301.

The second kind of common-law forfeiture fell only uponthose convicted of a felony or of treason. "The convicted
felon forfeited his chattels to the Crown and his lands es509us3115K 03-27-97 17:49:14 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
cheated to his lord; the convicted traitor forfeited all of his
property, real and personal, to the Crown." Calero-Toledo,
416 U. S., at 682. Such forfeitures were known as forfeitures of estate. See 4 W. Blackstone, at *381. These forfeitures obviously served to punish felons and traitors, see The
Palmyra, 12 Wheat. 1, 14 (1827), and were justified on the
ground that property was a right derived from society which
one lost by violating society's laws, see 1 W. Blackstone, at
*299; 4 id., at *382.

Third, "English Law provided for statutory forfeitures of
offending objects used in violation of the customs and revenue laws." Calero-Toledo, 416 U. S., at 682. The most notable of these were the Navigation Acts of 1660 that required
the shipping of most commodities in English vessels. Violations of the Acts resulted in the forfeiture of the illegally
carried goods as well as the ship that transported them.
See generally L. Harper, English Navigation Laws (1939).
The statute was construed so that the act of an individual
seaman, undertaken without the knowledge of the master
or owner, could result in forfeiture of the entire ship. See
Mitchell v. Torup, Park. 227, 145 Eng. Rep. 764 (Ex. 1766).
Yet Blackstone considered such forfeiture statutes "penal."
3 W. Blackstone, at *261.

In Calero-Toledo, we observed that statutory forfeitures
were "likely a product of the confluence and merger of the
deodand tradition and the belief that the right to own property could be denied the wrongdoer." 416 U. S., at 682.
Since each of these traditions had a punitive aspect, it is not
surprising that forfeiture under the Navigation Acts was justified as a penalty for negligence: "But the Owners of Ships
are to take Care what Master they employ, and the Master
what Mariners; and here Negligence is plainly imputable to
the Master; for he is to report the Cargo of the Ship, and if
he had searched and examined the Ship with proper care,
according to his Duty, he would have found the Tea . . . and

Opinion of the Court
so might have prevented the Forfeiture." Mitchell, Park.,at 238, 145 Eng. Rep., at 768.

B
Of England's three kinds of forfeiture, only the third tookhold in the United States. "Deodands did not become part

of the common-law tradition of this country." CaleroToledo, 416 U. S., at 682. The Constitution forbids forfeitureof estate as a punishment for treason "except during the Life

of the Person attainted," U. S. Const., Art. III, $ 3, cl. 2, andthe First Congress also abolished forfeiture of estate as a
punishment for felons. Act of Apr. 30, 1790, ch. 9, $ 24, 1Stat. 117. "But `[l]ong before the adoption of the Constitution the common law courts in the Colonies--and later in thestates during the period of Confederation--were exercising
jurisdiction in rem in the enforcement of [English and local]forfeiture statutes.' "

Calero-Toledo, 416 U. S., at 683, quot-ing C. J. Hendry Co. v. Moore, 318 U. S. 133, 139 (1943).

The First Congress passed laws subjecting ships and car-gos involved in customs offenses to forfeiture. It does not
follow from that fact, however, that the First Congressthought such forfeitures to be beyond the purview of the
Eighth Amendment. Indeed, examination of those lawssuggests that the First Congress viewed forfeiture as punishment. For example, by the Act of July 31, 1789, ch. 5,$ 12, 1 Stat. 39, Congress provided that goods could not be
unloaded except during the day and with a permit.

"[A]nd if the master or commander of any ship or vesselshall suffer or permit the same, such master and commander, and every other person who shall be aiding orassisting in landing, removing, housing, or otherwise securing the same, shall forfeit and pay the sum of fourhundred dollars for every offence; shall moreover be disabled from holding any office of trust or profit under theUnited States, for a term not exceeding seven years; and
it shall be the duty of the collector of the district, to

days after each respective conviction. And all goods,wares and merchandise, so landed or discharged, shall
become forfeited, and may be seized by any officer of thecustoms; and where the value thereof shall amount to
four hundred dollars, the vessel, tackle, apparel and fur-niture, shall be subject to like forfeiture and seizure."

Forfeiture of the goods and vessel is listed alongside theother provisions for punishment. It is also of some interest
that "forfeit" is the word Congress used for fine. See ibid.("shall forfeit and pay the sum of four hundred dollars for
every offence").7 Other early forfeiture statutes follow thesame pattern. See,

e. g., Act of Aug. 4, 1790, ch. 34, $$ 13,22, 27, 28, 1 Stat. 157, 161, 163.

C
Our cases also have recognized that statutory in rem for-feiture imposes punishment. In Peisch v. Ware, 4 Cranch

347 (1808), for example, the Court held that goods removedfrom the custody of a revenue officer without the payment
of duties should not be forfeitable for that reason unless theywere removed with the consent of the owner or his agent.
Chief Justice Marshall delivered the opinion for a unani-mous Court:

"The court is also of opinion that the removal forwhich the act punishes the owner with a forfeiture of

7 Dictionaries of the time confirm that "fine" was understood to include
"forfeiture" and vice versa. See 1 T. Sheridan, A General Dictionary of
the English Language (1780) (unpaginated) (defining "fine" as: "A mulct, a
pecuniary punishment; penalty; forfeit, money paid for any exemption or
liberty"); J. Walker, A Critical Pronouncing Dictionary (1791) (unpaginated) (same); 1 Sheridan, supra (defining "forfeiture" as: "The act of forfeiting; the thing forfeited, a mulct, a fine"); Walker, supra (same); J. Kersey, A New English Dictionary (1702) (unpaginated) (defining "forfeit" as:
"default, fine, or penalty").

Opinion of the Court
the goods must be made with his consent or connivance,or with that of some person employed or trusted by him.

If, by private theft, or open robbery, without any faulton his part, his property should be invaded, while in the
custody of the officer of the revenue, the law cannot beunderstood to punish him with the forfeiture of that
property." Id., at 364.8
The same understanding of forfeiture as punishment runsthrough our cases rejecting the "innocence" of the owner as a

common-law defense to forfeiture. See, e. g., Calero-Toledo,416 U. S., at 683;

J. W. Goldsmith, Jr.-Grant Co. v. United
States, 254 U. S. 505 (1921); Dobbins's Distillery v. UnitedStates, 96 U. S. 395 (1878); Harmony v. United States, 2 How.

210 (1844); The Palmyra, 12 Wheat. 1 (1827). In thesecases, forfeiture has been justified on two theories--that the
property itself is "guilty" of the offense, and that the ownermay be held accountable for the wrongs of others to whom
he entrusts his property. Both theories rest, at bottom, onthe notion that the owner has been negligent in allowing his
property to be misused and that he is properly punished forthat negligence.

The fiction that "the thing is primarily considered the of-fender,"

Goldsmith-Grant Co., 254 U. S., at 511, has a venera-ble history in our case law.

9 See The Palmyra, 12 Wheat.,

8 In Peisch, the removal of the goods from the custody of the revenue
officer occurred not by theft or robbery, but pursuant to a writ of replevin
issued by a state court. See 4 Cranch, at 360. Thus, Peisch stands for
the general principle that "the law is not understood to forfeit the property of owners or consignees, on account of the misconduct of mere strangers, over whom such owners or consignees could have no control." Id.,
at 365.

9 The Government relies heavily on this fiction. See Brief for United

States 18. We do not understand the Government to rely separately on
the technical distinction between proceedings in rem and proceedings in
personam, but we note that any such reliance would be misplaced. "The
fictions of in rem forfeiture were developed primarily to expand the reach
of the courts," Republic Nat. Bank of Miami v. United States, 506 U. S.

Opinion of the Court
at 14 ("The thing is here primarily considered as the of-fender, or rather the offence is attached primarily to the

thing"); Harmony, 2 How., at 233 ("The vessel which com-mits the aggression is treated as the offender, as the guilty
instrument or thing to which the forfeiture attaches, withoutany reference whatsoever to the character or conduct of the
owner"); Dobbins's Distillery, 96 U. S., at 401 ("[T]he offence. . . is attached primarily to the distillery, and the real and
personal property used in connection with the same, withoutany regard whatsoever to the personal misconduct or responsibility of the owner"). Yet the Court has understood thisfiction to rest on the notion that the owner who allows his
property to become involved in an offense has been negli-gent. Thus, in Goldsmith-Grant Co., the Court said that
"ascribing to the property a certain personality, a power ofcomplicity and guilt in the wrong," had "some analogy to the
law of deodand." 254 U. S., at 510. It then quoted Black-stone's explanation of the reason for deodand: that " `such
misfortunes are in part owing to the negligence of the owner,and therefore he is properly punished by such forfeiture.' "
Id., at 510-511, quoting 1 W. Blackstone, at *301.In none of these cases did the Court apply the guiltyproperty fiction to justify forfeiture when the owner haddone all that reasonably could be expected to prevent the
unlawful use of his property. In The Palmyra, it did nomore than reject the argument that the criminal conviction
of the owner was a prerequisite to the forfeiture of his prop-erty. See 12 Wheat., at 15 ("[N]o personal conviction of the
offender is necessary to enforce a forfeiture in rem in casesof this nature"). In Harmony, the owners' claim of "innocence" was limited to the fact that they "never contemplated

80, 87 (1992), which, particularly in admiralty proceedings, might have
lacked in personam jurisdiction over the owner of the property. See also
Harmony v. United States, 2 How. 210, 233 (1844). As is discussed in the
text, forfeiture proceedings historically have been understood as imposing
punishment despite their in rem nature.

or authorized the acts complained of." 2 How., at 230. Andin Dobbins's Distillery, the Court noted that some responsibility on the part of the owner arose "from the fact that heleased the property to the distiller, and suffered it to be occupied and used by the lessee as a distillery." 96 U. S., at 401.
The more recent cases have expressly reserved the questionwhether the fiction could be employed to forfeit the property

of a truly innocent owner. See, e. g., Goldsmith-Grant Co.,254 U. S., at 512;

Calero-Toledo, 416 U. S., at 689-690 (noting
that forfeiture of a truly innocent owner's property wouldraise "serious constitutional questions").

10 If forfeiture had

been understood not to punish the owner, there would havebeen no reason to reserve the case of a truly innocent owner.

Indeed, it is only on the assumption that forfeiture serves inpart to punish that the Court's past reservation of that question makes sense.The second theory on which the Court has justified the
forfeiture of an "innocent" owner's property is that the
owner may be held accountable for the wrongs of others towhom he entrusts his property. In

Harmony, it reasoned
that "the acts of the master and crew, in cases of this sort,bind the interest of the owner of the ship, whether he be

innocent or guilty; and he impliedly submits to whatever thelaw denounces as a forfeiture attached to the ship by reason
of their unlawful or wanton wrongs." 2 How., at 234. It
repeated this reasoning in Dobbins's Distillery:

"[T]he unlawful acts of the distiller bind the owner ofthe property, in respect to the management of the same,

as much as if they were committed by the owner himself.Power to that effect the law vests in him by virtue of
his lease; and, if he abuses his trust, it is a matter to be
settled between him and his lessor; but the acts of viola10 Because the forfeiture provisions at issue here exempt "innocent owners," we again have no occasion to decide in this case whether it would
comport with due process to forfeit the property of a truly innocent owner.

Opinion of the Court
tion as to the penal consequences to the property are tobe considered just the same as if they were the acts of

the owner." 96 U. S., at 404.
Like the guilty-property fiction, this theory of vicarious lia-bility is premised on the idea that the owner has been negligent. Thus, in Calero-Toledo, we noted that application offorfeiture provisions "to lessors, bailors, or secured creditors
who are innocent of any wrongdoing . . . may have the desir-able effect of inducing them to exercise greater care in transferring possession of their property." 416 U. S., at 688.11In sum, even though this Court has rejected the "innocence" of the owner as a common-law defense to forfeiture,it consistently has recognized that forfeiture serves, at least
in part, to punish the owner. See Peisch v. Ware, 4 Cranch,at 364 ("[T]he act punishes the owner with a forfeiture of the
goods"); Dobbins's Distillery, 96 U. S., at 404 ("[T]he acts ofviolation as to the penal consequences to the property are to
be considered just the same as if they were the acts of theowner");

Goldsmith-Grant Co., 254 U. S., at 511 (" `[S]uchmisfortunes are in part owing to the negligence of the owner,

and therefore he is properly punished by such forfeiture' ").More recently, we have noted that forfeiture serves "punitive
and deterrent purposes," Calero-Toledo, 416 U. S., at 686,and "impos[es] an economic penalty,"

id., at 687. We con-clude, therefore, that forfeiture generally and statutory in

rem forfeiture in particular historically have been under-stood, at least in part, as punishment.

12

11 In the criminal context, we have permitted punishment in the absence
of conscious wrongdoing, so long as the defendant was not " `powerless' to
prevent or correct the violation." United States v. Park, 421 U. S. 658,
673 (1975) (corporate officer strictly liable under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act). There is nothing inconsistent, therefore, in viewing forfeiture
as punishment even though the forfeiture is occasioned by the acts of a
person other than the owner.

12 The doubts that Justice Scalia, see post, at 625-627, and Justice

Kennedy, see post, at 629, express with regard to the historical understanding of forfeiture as punishment appear to stem from a misunder509us3115K 03-27-97 17:49:14 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court

IV
We turn next to consider whether forfeitures under 21
U. S. C. $$ 881(a)(4) and (a)(7) are properly considered pun-ishment today. We find nothing in these provisions or their

legislative history to contradict the historical understandingof forfeiture as punishment. Unlike traditional forfeiture
statutes, $$ 881(a)(4) and (a)(7) expressly provide an "inno-cent owner" defense. See $ 881(a)(4)(C) ("[N]o conveyance
shall be forfeited under this paragraph to the extent of aninterest of an owner, by reason of any act or omission established by that owner to have been committed or omitted
without the knowledge, consent, or willful blindness of the
owner"); $ 881(a)(7) ("[N]o property shall be forfeited under
this paragraph, to the extent of an interest of an owner, by
reason of any act or omission established by that owner to
have been committed or omitted without the knowledge or
consent of that owner"); see also United States v. Parcel of
Rumson, N. J., Land, 507 U. S. 111, 122-123 (1993) (plurality
opinion) (noting difference from traditional forfeiture statutes). These exemptions serve to focus the provisions on
the culpability of the owner in a way that makes them look
more like punishment, not less. In United States v. United
States Coin & Currency, 401 U. S. 715 (1971), we reasoned
that 19 U. S. C. $ 1618, which provides that the Secretary of
the Treasury is to return the property of those who do not
intend to violate the law, demonstrated Congress' intent "to
impose a penalty only upon those who are significantly involved in a criminal enterprise." 401 U. S., at 721-722.
The inclusion of innocent-owner defenses in $$ 881(a)(4) and
(a)(7) reveals a similar congressional intent to punish only
those involved in drug trafficking.

standing of the relevant question. Under United States v. Halper, 490
U. S. 435, 448 (1989), the question is whether forfeiture serves in part to
punish, and one need not exclude the possibility that forfeiture serves
other purposes to reach that conclusion.

509us3115K 03-27-97 17:49:14 PAGES OPINPGT
620 AUSTIN v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
Furthermore, Congress has chosen to tie forfeiture directly to the commission of drug offenses. Thus, under

$ 881(a)(4), a conveyance is forfeitable if it is used or intended
for use to facilitate the transportation of controlled substances, their raw materials, or the equipment used to manufacture or distribute them. Under $ 881(a)(7), real property
is forfeitable if it is used or intended for use to facilitate the
commission of a drug-related crime punishable by more than
one year's imprisonment. See n. 1, supra.

The legislative history of $ 881 confirms the punitive nature of these provisions. When it added subsection (a)(7)
to $ 881 in 1984, Congress recognized "that the traditional
criminal sanctions of fine and imprisonment are inadequate
to deter or punish the enormously profitable trade in dangerous drugs." S. Rep. No. 98-225, p. 191 (1983).13 It
characterized the forfeiture of real property as "a powerful
deterrent." Id., at 195. See also Joint House-Senate Explanation of Senate Amendment to Titles II and III of the
Psychotropic Substances Act of 1978, 124 Cong. Rec. 34671
(1978) (noting "the penal nature of forfeiture statutes").

The Government argues that $$ 881(a)(4) and (a)(7) are not
punitive but, rather, should be considered remedial in two
respects. First, they remove the "instruments" of the drug
trade "thereby protecting the community from the threat of
continued drug dealing." Brief for United States 32. Second, the forfeited assets serve to compensate the Government for the expense of law enforcement activity and for its
expenditure on societal problems such as urban blight, drug
addiction, and other health concerns resulting from the drug
trade. Id., at 25, 32.

13 Although the United States omits any reference to this legislative history in its brief in the present case, it quoted the same passage with approval in its brief in United States v. Parcel of Rumson, N. J., Land, 507
U. S. 111 (1993). See Brief for United States, O. T. 1992, No. 91-781,
pp. 41-42.

Opinion of the Court
In our view, neither argument withstands scrutiny. Con-cededly, we have recognized that the forfeiture of contraband

itself may be characterized as remedial because it removesdangerous or illegal items from society. See

United States
v. One Assortment of 89 Firearms, 465 U. S. 354, 364 (1984).
The Court, however, previously has rejected government'sattempt to extend that reasoning to conveyances used to

transport illegal liquor. See One 1958 Plymouth Sedan v.
Pennsylvania, 380 U. S. 693, 699 (1965). In that case it
noted: "There is nothing even remotely criminal in possess-ing an automobile."

Ibid. The same, without question, is
true of the properties involved here, and the Government's
attempt to characterize these properties as "instruments"
of the drug trade must meet the same fate as Pennsylvania's effort to characterize the 1958 Plymouth sedan as
"contraband."

The Government's second argument about the remedial
nature of this forfeiture is no more persuasive. We previously have upheld the forfeiture of goods involved in customs violations as "a reasonable form of liquidated damages." One Lot Emerald Cut Stones v. United States, 409
U. S. 232, 237 (1972). But the dramatic variations in the
value of conveyances and real property forfeitable under

$$ 881(a)(4) and (a)(7) undercut any similar argument with
respect to those provisions. The Court made this very point
in Ward: The "forfeiture of property . . . [is] a penalty that
ha[s] absolutely no correlation to any damages sustained by
society or to the cost of enforcing the law." 448 U. S., at 254.

Fundamentally, even assuming that $$ 881(a)(4) and (a)(7)
serve some remedial purpose, the Government's argument
must fail. "[A] civil sanction that cannot fairly be said solely
to serve a remedial purpose, but rather can only be explained
as also serving either retributive or deterrent purposes, is
punishment, as we have come to understand the term."
Halper, 490 U. S., at 448 (emphasis added). In light of the
historical understanding of forfeiture as punishment, the

622 AUSTIN v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
clear focus of $$ 881(a)(4) and (a)(7) on the culpability of the
owner, and the evidence that Congress understood those provisions as serving to deter and to punish, we cannot conclude
that forfeiture under $$ 881(a)(4) and (a)(7) serves solely a
remedial purpose.14 We therefore conclude that forfeiture
under these provisions constitutes "payment to a sovereign
as punishment for some offense," Browning-Ferris, 492 U. S.,
at 265, and, as such, is subject to the limitations of the Eighth
Amendment's Excessive Fines Clause.

V
Austin asks that we establish a multifactor test for determining whether a forfeiture is constitutionally "excessive."
See Brief for Petitioner 46-48. We decline that invitation.
Although the Court of Appeals opined that "the government
is exacting too high a penalty in relation to the offense committed," 964 F. 2d, at 818, it had no occasion to consider what
factors should inform such a decision because it thought it
was foreclosed from engaging in the inquiry. Prudence dictates that we allow the lower courts to consider that question

14 In Halper, we focused on whether "the sanction as applied in the individual case serves the goals of punishment." 490 U. S., at 448. In this
case, however, it makes sense to focus on $$ 881(a)(4) and (a)(7) as a whole.
Halper involved a small, fixed-penalty provision, which "in the ordinary
case . . . can be said to do no more than make the Government whole."
Id., at 449. The value of the conveyances and real property forfeitable
under $$ 881(a)(4) and (a)(7), on the other hand, can vary so dramatically
that any relationship between the Government's actual costs and the
amount of the sanction is merely coincidental. See Ward, 448 U. S., at
254. Furthermore, as we have seen, forfeiture statutes historically have
been understood as serving not simply remedial goals but also those of
punishment and deterrence. Finally, it appears to make little practical
difference whether the Excessive Fines Clause applies to all forfeitures
under $$ 881(a)(4) and (a)(7) or only to those that cannot be characterized
as purely remedial. The Clause prohibits only the imposition of "excessive" fines, and a fine that serves purely remedial purposes cannot be
considered "excessive" in any event.

in the first instance. See Yee v. Escondido, 503 U. S. 519,538 (1992).

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, andthe case is remanded to that court for further proceedings

consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice Scalia, concurring in part and concurring in thejudgment.

We recently stated that, at the time the Eighth Amend-ment was drafted, the term "fine" was "understood to mean
a payment to a sovereign as punishment for some offense."Browning-Ferris Industries of Vt., Inc. v. Kelco Disposal,
Inc., 492 U. S. 257, 265 (1989). It seems to me that theCourt's opinion obscures this clear statement, and needlessly
attempts to derive from our sparse case law on the subjectof

in rem forfeiture the questionable proposition that theowner of property taken pursuant to such forfeiture is always blameworthy. I write separately to explain why I con-sider this forfeiture a fine, and to point out that the excessiveness inquiry for statutory in rem forfeitures is differentfrom the usual excessiveness inquiry.

I
Whether any sort of forfeiture of property may be coveredby the Eighth Amendment is not a difficult question. "Forfeiture" and "fine" each appeared as one of many definitionsof the other in various 18th-century dictionaries. See

ante,at 614, n. 7. "Payment," the word we used in Browning15 Justice Scalia suggests that the sole measure of an in rem forfeiture's excessiveness is the relationship between the forfeited property and
the offense. See post, at 627-628. We do not rule out the possibility that
the connection between the property and the offense may be relevant, but
our decision today in no way limits the Court of Appeals from considering

624 AUSTIN v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of Scalia, J.
Ferris as a synonym for fine, certainly includes in-kind as-sessments. Webster's New International Dictionary 1797

(2d ed. 1950) (defining "payment" as "[t]hat which is paid; thething given to discharge a debt or an obligation"). Moreover, for the Eighth Amendment to limit cash fines while
permitting limitless in-kind assessments would make littlesense, altering only the form of the Star Chamber abuses

that led to the provision of the English Bill of Rights, fromwhich our Excessive Fines Clause directly derives, see
Browning-Ferris, supra, at 266-267. Cf. Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U. S. 957, 978-979, n. 9 (1991) (opinion of Scalia,
J.). In Alexander v. United States, ante, at 558, we have
today held that an in personam criminal forfeiture is an
Eighth Amendment "fine."

In order to constitute a fine under the Eighth Amendment,
however, the forfeiture must constitute "punishment," and it
is a much closer question whether statutory in rem forfeitures, as opposed to in personam forfeitures, meet this requirement. The latter are assessments, whether monetary
or in kind, to punish the property owner's criminal conduct,
while the former are confiscations of property rights based
on improper use of the property, regardless of whether the
owner has violated the law. Statutory in rem forfeitures
have a long history. See generally Calero-Toledo v. Pearson
Yacht Leasing Co., 416 U. S. 663, 680-686 (1974). The property to which they apply is not contraband, see the forfeiture
Act passed by the First Congress, ante, at 613-614, nor is it
necessarily property that can only be used for illegal purposes. The theory of in rem forfeiture is said to be that the
lawful property has committed an offense. See, e. g., The
Palmyra, 12 Wheat. 1, 14-15 (1827) (forfeiture of vessel for
piracy); Harmony v. United States, 2 How. 210, 233-234
(1844) (forfeiture of vessel, but not cargo, for piracy); Dobbins's Distillery v. United States, 96 U. S. 395, 400-403
(1878) (forfeiture of distillery and real property for evasion
of revenue laws); J. W. Goldsmith, Jr.-Grant Co. v. United

Opinion of Scalia, J.
States, 254 U. S. 505, 510-511 (1921) (forfeiture of goods con-cealed to avoid taxes).

However the theory may be expressed, it seems to me thatthis taking of lawful property must be considered, in whole
or in part, see United States v. Halper, 490 U. S. 435, 448
(1989), punitive.* Its purpose is not compensatory, to makesomeone whole for injury caused by unlawful use of the property. See ibid. Punishment is being imposed, whether onequaintly considers its object to be the property itself, or
more realistically regards its object to be the property'sowner. This conclusion is supported by Blackstone's observation that even confiscation of a deodand, whose religiousorigins supposedly did not reflect any punitive motive but
only expiation, see Law of Deodands, 34 Law Mag. 188, 189
(1845), came to be explained in part by reference to theowner as well as to the offending property. 1 W. Blackstone,

Commentaries *301; accord, Law of Deodands, supra, at 190.
Our cases have described statutory in rem forfeiture as
"likely a product of the confluence and merger of the deodand
tradition and the belief that the right to own property could
be denied the wrongdoer." Calero-Toledo, supra, at 682.

The Court apparently believes, however, that only actual
culpability of the affected property owner can establish that
a forfeiture provision is punitive, and sets out to establish
(in Part III) that such culpability exists in the case of in rem
forfeitures. In my view, however, the case law is far more
ambiguous than the Court acknowledges. We have never
held that the Constitution requires negligence, or any other
degree of culpability, to support such forfeitures. See ante,

*Thus, contrary to the Court's contention, ante, at 618-619, n. 12, I
agree with it on this point. I do not agree, however, that culpability of
the property owner is necessary to establish punitiveness, or that punitiveness "in part" is established by showing that at least in some cases
the affected property owners are culpable. That is to say, the statutory
forfeiture must always be at least "partly punitive," or else it is not a fine.
See ante, at 622, n. 14.

626 AUSTIN v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of Scalia, J.
at 616-617, and n. 10; Goldsmith-Grant, supra, at 512 (re-serving question);

Calero-Toledo, supra, at 689-690 (same).
A prominent 19th-century treatise explains statutory in remforfeitures solely by reference to the fiction that the property

is guilty, strictly separating them from forfeitures that require a personal offense of the owner. See 1 J. Bishop,Commentaries on Criminal Law $$ 816, 824, 825, 833 (7th

ed. 1882). If the Court is correct that culpability of theowner is essential, then there is no difference (except perhaps the burden of proof) between the traditional in remforfeiture and the traditional

in personam forfeiture. Wellestablished common-law distinctions should not be swept
away by reliance on bits of dicta. Moreover, if some degree
of personal culpability on the part of the property owner
always exists for in rem forfeitures, see ante, at 614-618,
then it is hard to understand why this Court has kept reserving the (therefore academic) question whether personal culpability is constitutionally required, see ante, at 617, as the
Court does again today, see ante, at 617, n. 10.

I would have reserved the question without engaging in
the misleading discussion of culpability. Even if punishment of personal culpability is necessary for a forfeiture to
be a fine; and even if in rem forfeitures in general do not
punish personal culpability; the in rem forfeiture in this case
is a fine. As the Court discusses in Part IV, this statute, in
contrast to the traditional in rem forfeiture, requires that
the owner not be innocent--that he have some degree of culpability for the "guilty" property. See also United States v.
Parcel of Rumson, N. J., Land, 507 U. S. 111, 121-123 (1993)
(plurality opinion) (contrasting drug forfeiture statute with
traditional statutory in rem forfeitures). Here, the property must "offend" and the owner must not be completely
without fault. Nor is there any consideration of compensating for loss, since the value of the property is irrelevant to
whether it is forfeited. That is enough to satisfy the
Browning-Ferris standard, and to make the entire discussion

in Part III dictum. Statutory forfeitures under $ 881(a) arecertainly payment (in kind) to a sovereign as punishment

for an offense. II

That this forfeiture works as a fine raises the excessive-ness issue, on which the Court remands. I agree that a remand is in order, but think it worth pointing out that onremand the excessiveness analysis must be different from
that applicable to monetary fines and, perhaps, to in personam forfeitures. In the case of a monetary fine, the EighthAmendment's origins in the English Bill of Rights, intended

to limit the abusive penalties assessed against the King's op-ponents, see Browning-Ferris, 492 U. S., at 266-267, demonstrate that the touchstone is value of the fine in relation tothe offense. And in Alexander v. United States, we indicated that the same is true for in personam forfeiture.
Ante, at 558.Here, however, the offense of which petitioner has been

convicted is not relevant to the forfeiture. Section $ 881 re-quires only that the Government show probable cause that
the subject property was used for the prohibited purpose.The burden then shifts to the property owner to show, by a
preponderance of the evidence, that the use was made with-out his "knowledge, consent, or willful blindness," 21 U. S. C.

$ 881(a)(4)(C), see also $ 881(a)(7), or that the property wasnot so used, see $ 881(d) (incorporating 19 U. S. C. $ 1615).
Unlike monetary fines, statutory in rem forfeitures have tra-ditionally been fixed, not by determining the appropriate
value of the penalty in relation to the committed offense, butby determining what property has been "tainted" by unlawful use, to which issue the value of the property is irrelevant.Scales used to measure out unlawful drug sales, for example,
are confiscable whether made of the purest gold or the basestmetal. But an in rem forfeiture goes beyond the traditional
limits that the Eighth Amendment permits if it applies toproperty that cannot properly be regarded as an instrumen509us3115K 03-27-97 17:49:14 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
tality of the offense--the building, for example, in which anisolated drug sale happens to occur. Such a confiscation

would be an excessive fine. The question is not how muchthe confiscated property is worth, but

whether the confiscated property has a close enough relationship to the offense.

This inquiry for statutory forfeitures has common-law par-allels. Even in the case of deodands, juries were careful to

confiscate only the instrument of death and not more. Thus,if a man was killed by a moving cart, the cart and its horses
were deodands, but if the man died when he fell from a wheelof an immobile cart, only the wheel was treated as a deodand,
since only the wheel could be regarded as the cause of death.1 M. Hale, Pleas of the Crown *419-*422; 1 W. Blackstone,
Commentaries *301-*302; Law of Deodands, 34 Law Mag.,
at 190. Our cases suggest a similar instrumentality inquiry
when considering the permissible scope of a statutory forfeiture. Cf. Goldsmith-Grant, 254 U. S., at 510, 513; Harmony,
2 How., at 235 (ship used for piracy is forfeited, but cargo is
not). The relevant inquiry for an excessive forfeiture under

$ 881 is the relationship of the property to the offense: Was
it close enough to render the property, under traditional
standards, "guilty" and hence forfeitable?

I join the Court's opinion in part, and concur in the
judgment.

Justice Kennedy, with whom The Chief Justice and
Justice Thomas join, concurring in part and concurring in
the judgment.

I am in substantial agreement with Part I of Justice
Scalia's opinion concurring in part and concurring in the
judgment. I share Justice Scalia's belief that Part III of
the Court's opinion is quite unnecessary for the decision of
the case, fails to support the Court's argument, and seems
rather doubtful as well.

In recounting the law's history, we risk anachronism if we

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
cepts that had not yet evolved. I see something of that inthe Court's opinion here, for in its eagerness to discover a

unified theory of forfeitures, it recites a consistent rationaleof personal punishment that neither the cases nor other narratives of the common law suggest. For many of the rea-sons explained by

Justice Scalia, I am not convinced thatall in rem forfeitures were on account of the owner's blameworthy conduct. Some impositions of in rem forfeiture mayhave been designed either to remove property that was itself
causing injury, see, e. g., Harmony v. United States, 2 How.210, 233 (1844), or to give the court jurisdiction over an asset
that it could control in order to make injured parties whole,see

Republic Nat. Bank of Miami v. United States, 506 U. S.80, 87 (1992).

At some point, we may have to confront the constitutionalquestion whether forfeiture is permitted when the owner has
committed no wrong of any sort, intentional or negligent.That for me would raise a serious question. Though the history of forfeiture laws might not be determinative of thatissue, it would have an important bearing on the outcome.
I would reserve for that or some other necessary occasionthe inquiry the Court undertakes here. Unlike

Justice
Scalia, see ante, at 625, I would also reserve the questionwhether

in rem forfeitures always amount to an intendedpunishment of the owner of forfeited property.

With these observations, I concur in part and concur inthe judgment.

SHAW et al. v. RENO, ATTORNEY

GENERAL, et al.

appeal from the united states district court for theeastern district of north carolina

No. 92-357. Argued April 20, 1993--Decided June 28, 1993
To comply with $ 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965--which prohibits a

covered jurisdiction from implementing changes in a "standard, practice,
or procedure with respect to voting" without federal authorization--
North Carolina submitted to the Attorney General a congressional reapportionment plan with one majority-black district. The Attorney General objected to the plan on the ground that a second district could have
been created to give effect to minority voting strength in the State's
south-central to southeastern region. The State's revised plan contained a second majority-black district in the north-central region. The
new district stretches approximately 160 miles along Interstate 85 and,
for much of its length, is no wider than the I-85 corridor. Appellants,
five North Carolina residents, filed this action against appellee state and
federal officials, claiming that the State had created an unconstitutional
racial gerrymander in violation of, among other things, the Fourteenth
Amendment. They alleged that the two districts concentrated a majority of black voters arbitrarily without regard to considerations such as
compactness, contiguousness, geographical boundaries, or political subdivisions, in order to create congressional districts along racial lines and
to assure the election of two black representatives. The three-judge
District Court held that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the
federal appellees. It also dismissed the complaint against the state appellees, finding, among other things, that, under United Jewish Organizations of Williamsburgh, Inc. v. Carey, 430 U. S. 144 (UJO), appellants
had failed to state an equal protection claim because favoring minority voters was not discriminatory in the constitutional sense and the
plan did not lead to proportional underrepresentation of white voters
statewide.

Held:

1. Appellants have stated a claim under the Equal Protection Clause
by alleging that the reapportionment scheme is so irrational on its face
that it can be understood only as an effort to segregate voters into separate districts on the basis of race, and that the separation lacks sufficient
justification. Pp. 639-652.

Syllabus
(a) The District Court properly dismissed the claims against the
federal appellees. Appellants' racial gerrymandering claims must be
examined against the backdrop of this country's long history of racial
discrimination in voting. Pp. 639-642.

(b) Classifications of citizens based solely on race are by their nature odious to a free people whose institutions are founded upon the
doctrine of equality, because they threaten to stigmatize persons by reason of their membership in a racial group and to incite racial hostility.
Thus, state legislation that expressly distinguishes among citizens on
account of race--whether it contains an explicit distinction or is "unexplainable on grounds other than race," Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U. S. 252, 266--must be narrowly
tailored to further a compelling governmental interest. See, e. g., Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Ed., 476 U. S. 267, 277-278 (plurality opinion).
Redistricting legislation that is alleged to be so bizarre on its face that
it is unexplainable on grounds other than race demands the same close
scrutiny, regardless of the motivations underlying its adoption. See,
e. g., Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U. S. 339, 341. That it may be difficult
to determine from the face of a single-member districting plan that it
makes such a distinction does not mean that a racial gerrymander, once
established, should receive less scrutiny than other legislation classifying citizens by race. By perpetuating stereotypical notions about
members of the same racial group--that they think alike, share the
same political interests, and prefer the same candidates--a racial gerrymander may exacerbate the very patterns of racial bloc voting that
majority-minority districting is sometimes said to counteract. It also
sends to elected representatives the message that their primary obligation is to represent only that group's members, rather than their constituency as a whole. Since the holding here makes it unnecessary to decide whether or how a reapportionment plan that, on its face, can be
explained in nonracial terms successfully could be challenged, the Court
expresses no view on whether the intentional creation of majorityminority districts, without more, always gives rise to an equal protection claim. Pp. 642-649.

(c) The classification of citizens by race threatens special harms
that are not present in this Court's vote-dilution cases and thus warrants an analysis different from that used in assessing the validity of atlarge and multimember gerrymandering schemes. In addition, nothing
in the Court's decisions compels the conclusion that racial and political
gerrymanders are subject to the same constitutional scrutiny; in fact,
this country's long and persistent history of racial discrimination in voting and the Court's Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence would seem
to compel the opposite conclusion. Nor is there any support for the

Syllabus
argument that racial gerrymandering poses no constitutional difficulties
when the lines drawn favor the minority, since equal protection analysis
is not dependent on the race of those burdened or benefited by a particular classification, Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469, 494 (plurality opinion). Finally, the highly fractured decision in UJO does not
foreclose the claim recognized here, which is analytically distinct from
the vote-dilution claim made there. Pp. 649-652.

2. If, on remand, the allegations of a racial gerrymander are not contradicted, the District Court must determine whether the plan is narrowly tailored to further a compelling governmental interest. A covered jurisdiction's interest in creating majority-minority districts in
order to comply with the nonretrogression rule under $ 5 of the Voting
Rights Act does not give it carte blanche to engage in racial gerrymandering. The parties' arguments about whether the plan was necessary
to avoid dilution of black voting strength in violation of $ 2 of the Act
and whether the State's interpretation of $ 2 is unconstitutional were
not developed below, and the issues remain open for consideration on
remand. It is also unnecessary to decide at this stage of the litigation
whether the plan advances a state interest distinct from the Act: eradicating the effects of past racial discrimination. Although the State argues that it had a strong basis for concluding that remedial action was
warranted, only three Justices in UJO were prepared to say that States
have a significant interest in minimizing the consequences of racial bloc
voting apart from the Act's requirements and without regard for sound
districting principles. Pp. 653-657.

3. The Court expresses no view on whether appellants successfully
could have challenged a district such as that suggested by the Attorney
General or whether their complaint stated a claim under other constitutional provisions. Pp. 657-658.

This case involves two of the most complex and sensitiveissues this Court has faced in recent years: the meaning of

seat in the United States House of Representatives. TheGeneral Assembly enacted a reapportionment plan that included one majority-black congressional district. After theAttorney General of the United States objected to the plan

tutes an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. The question
before us is whether appellants have stated a cognizable
claim.

I

The voting age population of North Carolina is approximately 78% white, 20% black, and 1% Native American; the
remaining 1% is predominantly Asian. App. to Brief for
Federal Appellees 16a. The black population is relatively
dispersed; blacks constitute a majority of the general population in only 5 of the State's 100 counties. Brief for Appellants 57. Geographically, the State divides into three
regions: the eastern Coastal Plain, the central Piedmont
Plateau, and the western mountains. H. Lefler & A. Newsom, The History of a Southern State: North Carolina 18-22
(3d ed. 1973). The largest concentrations of black citizens
live in the Coastal Plain, primarily in the northern part.
O. Gade & H. Stillwell, North Carolina: People and Environments 65-68 (1986). The General Assembly's first redistricting plan contained one majority-black district centered
in that area of the State.

Forty of North Carolina's one hundred counties are covered by $ 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 42 U. S. C.

$ 1973c, which prohibits a jurisdiction subject to its provisions from implementing changes in a "standard, practice, or
procedure with respect to voting" without federal authorization, ibid. The jurisdiction must obtain either a judgment
from the United States District Court for the District of Columbia declaring that the proposed change "does not have
the purpose and will not have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color" or administrative preclearance from the Attorney General. Ibid. Because the General Assembly's reapportionment plan affected
the covered counties, the parties agree that $ 5 applied. Tr.
of Oral Arg. 14, 27-29. The State chose to submit its plan
to the Attorney General for preclearance.

Opinion of the Court
The Attorney General, acting through the Assistant At-torney General for the Civil Rights Division, interposed

a formal objection to the General Assembly's plan. TheAttorney General specifically objected to the configuration
of boundary lines drawn in the south-central to southeastern
region of the State. In the Attorney General's view, theGeneral Assembly could have created a second majorityminority district "to give effect to black and Native Ameri-can voting strength in this area" by using boundary lines "no
more irregular than [those] found elsewhere in the proposedplan," but failed to do so for "pretextual reasons." See App.
to Brief for Federal Appellees 10a-11a.

Under $ 5, the State remained free to seek a declaratory
judgment from the District Court for the District of Columbia notwithstanding the Attorney General's objection. It
did not do so. Instead, the General Assembly enacted a revised redistricting plan, 1991 N. C. Extra Sess. Laws, ch. 7,
that included a second majority-black district. The General
Assembly located the second district not in the south-central
to southeastern part of the State, but in the north-central
region along Interstate 85. See Appendix, infra.

The first of the two majority-black districts contained in
the revised plan, District 1, is somewhat hook shaped. Centered in the northeast portion of the State, it moves southward until it tapers to a narrow band; then, with finger-like
extensions, it reaches far into the southernmost part of the
State near the South Carolina border. District 1 has been
compared to a "Rorschach ink-blot test," Shaw v. Barr, 808
F. Supp. 461, 476 (EDNC 1992) (Voorhees, C. J., concurring
in part and dissenting in part), and a "bug splattered on a
windshield," Wall Street Journal, Feb. 4, 1992, p. A14.

The second majority-black district, District 12, is even
more unusually shaped. It is approximately 160 miles long
and, for much of its length, no wider than the I-85 corridor.
It winds in snakelike fashion through tobacco country, financial centers, and manufacturing areas "until it gobbles in

in part). Northbound and southbound drivers on I-85 some-times find themselves in separate districts in one county,
only to "trade" districts when they enter the next county.
Of the 10 counties through which District 12 passes, 5 arecut into 3 different districts; even towns are divided. At

one point the district remains contiguous only because it in-tersects at a single point with two other districts before
crossing over them. See Brief for Republican NationalCommittee as

Amicus Curiae 14-15. One state legislator
has remarked that " `[i]f you drove down the interstate with
both car doors open, you'd kill most of the people in the district.' " Washington Post, Apr. 20, 1993, p. A4. The district even has inspired poetry: "Ask not for whom the line is
drawn; it is drawn to avoid thee." Grofman, Would Vince
Lombardi Have Been Right If He Had Said: "When It Comes
to Redistricting, Race Isn't Everything, It's the Only
Thing"?, 14 Cardozo L. Rev. 1237, 1261, n. 96 (1993) (internal
quotation marks omitted).

The Attorney General did not object to the General Assembly's revised plan. But numerous North Carolinians did.
The North Carolina Republican Party and individual voters
brought suit in Federal District Court, alleging that the plan
constituted an unconstitutional political gerrymander under
Davis v. Bandemer, 478 U. S. 109 (1986). That claim was
dismissed, see Pope v. Blue, 809 F. Supp. 392 (WDNC), and
this Court summarily affirmed, 506 U. S. 801 (1992).

Shortly after the complaint in Pope v. Blue was filed, appellants instituted the present action in the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina.
Appellants alleged not that the revised plan constituted a
political gerrymander, nor that it violated the "one person,
one vote" principle, see Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533, 558
(1964), but that the State had created an unconstitutional
racial gerrymander. Appellants are five residents of Dur509us3116I 03-28-97 20:17:49 PAGES OPINPGT

Appellants contended that the General Assembly's revised reapportionment plan violated several provisions of
the United States Constitution, including the Fourteenth
Amendment. They alleged that the General Assembly deliberately "create[d] two Congressional Districts in which a
majority of black voters was concentrated arbitrarily--without regard to any other considerations, such as compactness,
contiguousness, geographical boundaries, or political subdivisions" with the purpose "to create Congressional Districts
along racial lines" and to assure the election of two black
representatives to Congress. App. to Juris. Statement 102a.
Appellants sought declaratory and injunctive relief against
the state appellees. They sought similar relief against the
federal appellees, arguing, alternatively, that the federal
appellees had misconstrued the Voting Rights Act or that
the Act itself was unconstitutional.

The three-judge District Court granted the federal appellees' motion to dismiss. 808 F. Supp. 461 (EDNC 1992).
The court agreed unanimously that it lacked subject matter
jurisdiction by reason of $ 14(b) of the Voting Rights Act,
42 U. S. C. $ 1973l(b), which vests the District Court for the
District of Columbia with exclusive jurisdiction to issue
injunctions against the execution of the Act and to enjoin
actions taken by federal officers pursuant thereto. 808
F. Supp., at 466-467; id., at 474 (Voorhees, C. J., concurring

in relevant part). Two judges also concluded that, to the
extent appellants challenged the Attorney General's preclearance decisions, their claim was foreclosed by this
Court's holding in Morris v. Gressette, 432 U. S. 491 (1977).
808 F. Supp., at 467.

By a 2-to-1 vote, the District Court also dismissed the
complaint against the state appellees. The majority found
no support for appellants' contentions that race-based
districting is prohibited by Article I, $ 4, or Article I, $ 2,
of the Constitution, or by the Privileges and Immunities
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. It deemed appellants' claim under the Fifteenth Amendment essentially
subsumed within their related claim under the Equal Protection Clause. 808 F. Supp., at 468-469. That claim, the majority concluded, was barred by United Jewish Organizations of Williamsburgh, Inc. v. Carey, 430 U. S. 144 (1977)
(UJO).

The majority first took judicial notice of a fact omitted
from appellants' complaint: that appellants are white. It rejected the argument that race-conscious redistricting to benefit minority voters is per se unconstitutional. The majority
also rejected appellants' claim that North Carolina's reapportionment plan was impermissible. The majority read UJO
to stand for the proposition that a redistricting scheme violates white voters' rights only if it is "adopted with the purpose and effect of discriminating against white voters . . . on
account of their race." 808 F. Supp., at 472. The purposes
of favoring minority voters and complying with the Voting
Rights Act are not discriminatory in the constitutional sense,
the court reasoned, and majority-minority districts have an
impermissibly discriminatory effect only when they unfairly
dilute or cancel out white voting strength. Because the
State's purpose here was to comply with the Voting Rights
Act, and because the General Assembly's plan did not lead
to proportional underrepresentation of white voters state509us3116I 03-28-97 20:17:49 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
wide, the majority concluded that appellants had failed tostate an equal protection claim. Id., at 472-473.

Chief Judge Voorhees agreed that race-conscious redis-tricting is not per se unconstitutional but dissented from the
rest of the majority's equal protection analysis. He read
Justice White's opinion in UJO to authorize race-based re-apportionment only when the State employs traditional districting principles such as compactness and contiguity. 808F. Supp., at 475-477 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). North Carolina's failure to respect these prin-ciples, in Judge Voorhees' view, "augur[ed] a constitutionally
suspect, and potentially unlawful, intent" sufficient to defeatthe state appellees' motion to dismiss.

"The right to vote freely for the candidate of one's choiceis of the essence of a democratic society . . . ."

Reynolds v.Sims, 377 U. S., at 555. For much of our Nation's history,

that right sadly has been denied to many because of race.The Fifteenth Amendment, ratified in 1870 after a bloody
Civil War, promised unequivocally that "[t]he right of citizensof the United States to vote" no longer would be "denied or
abridged . . . by any State on account of race, color, or previ-ous condition of servitude." U. S. Const., Amdt. 15, $ 1.

But "[a] number of states . . . refused to take no for ananswer and continued to circumvent the fifteenth amendment's prohibition through the use of both subtle and bluntinstruments, perpetuating ugly patterns of pervasive racial
discrimination." Blumstein, Defining and Proving RaceDiscrimination: Perspectives on the Purpose Vs. Results Approach from the Voting Rights Act, 69 Va. L. Rev. 633, 637(1983). Ostensibly race-neutral devices such as literacy
tests with "grandfather" clauses and "good character" provi-sos were devised to deprive black voters of the franchise.

Opinion of the Court
Another of the weapons in the States' arsenal was the racialgerrymander--"the deliberate and arbitrary distortion of

district boundaries . . . for [racial] purposes." Bandemer,478 U. S., at 164 (Powell, J., concurring in part and dissenting
in part) (internal quotation marks omitted). In the 1870's,
for example, opponents of Reconstruction in Mississippi"concentrated the bulk of the black population in a `shoestring' Congressional district running the length of the Mis-sissippi River, leaving five others with white majorities."
E. Foner, Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution,1863-1877, p. 590 (1988). Some 90 years later, Alabama redefined the boundaries of the city of Tuskegee "from a square
to an uncouth twenty-eight-sided figure" in a manner that
was alleged to exclude black voters, and only black voters,
from the city limits. Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U. S. 339,
340 (1960).

Alabama's exercise in geometry was but one example of
the racial discrimination in voting that persisted in parts of
this country nearly a century after ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment. See South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383
U. S. 301, 309-313 (1966). In some States, registration of
eligible black voters ran 50% behind that of whites. Id., at
313. Congress enacted the Voting Rights Act of 1965 as a
dramatic and severe response to the situation. The Act
proved immediately successful in ensuring racial minorities
access to the voting booth; by the early 1970's, the spread
between black and white registration in several of the targeted Southern States had fallen to well below 10%. A.
Thernstrom, Whose Votes Count? Affirmative Action and
Minority Voting Rights 44 (1987).

But it soon became apparent that guaranteeing equal access to the polls would not suffice to root out other racially
discriminatory voting practices. Drawing on the "one person, one vote" principle, this Court recognized that "[t]he
right to vote can be affected by a dilution of voting power
as well as by an absolute prohibition on casting a ballot."

Allen v. State Bd. of Elections, 393 U. S. 544, 569 (1969) (em-phasis added). Where members of a racial minority group

vote as a cohesive unit, practices such as multimember or at-large electoral systems can reduce or nullify minority voters'
ability, as a group, "to elect the candidate of their choice."
Ibid. Accordingly, the Court held that such schemes violatethe Fourteenth Amendment when they are adopted with a

discriminatory purpose and have the effect of diluting minor-ity voting strength. See, e. g., Rogers v. Lodge, 458 U. S.
613, 616-617 (1982); White v. Regester, 412 U. S. 755, 765-766(1973). Congress, too, responded to the problem of vote dilution. In 1982, it amended $ 2 of the Voting Rights Act toprohibit legislation that

results in the dilution of a minoritygroup's voting strength, regardless of the legislature's intent.

42 U. S. C. $ 1973; see Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S. 30(1986) (applying amended $ 2 to vote-dilution claim involving
multimember districts); see also Voinovich v. Quilter, 507U. S. 146, 155 (1993) (single-member districts).

It is against this background that we confront the ques-tions presented here. In our view, the District Court properly dismissed appellants' claims against the federal ap-pellees. Our focus is on appellants' claim that the State
engaged in unconstitutional racial gerrymandering. Thatargument strikes a powerful historical chord: It is unsettling
how closely the North Carolina plan resembles the mostegregious racial gerrymanders of the past.

An understanding of the nature of appellants' claim is criti-cal to our resolution of the case. In their complaint, appellants did not claim that the General Assembly's reap-portionment plan unconstitutionally "diluted" white voting
strength. They did not even claim to be white. Rather, ap-pellants' complaint alleged that the deliberate segregation of
voters into separate districts on the basis of race violatedtheir constitutional right to participate in a "color-blind"

Despite their invocation of the ideal of a "color-blind" Con-stitution, see Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537, 559 (1896)
(Harlan, J., dissenting), appellants appear to concede thatrace-conscious redistricting is not always unconstitutional.
See Tr. of Oral Arg. 16-19. That concession is wise: ThisCourt never has held that race-conscious state decisionmaking is impermissible in all circumstances. What appel-lants object to is redistricting legislation that is so extremely
irregular on its face that it rationally can be viewed only asan effort to segregate the races for purposes of voting, without regard for traditional districting principles and withoutsufficiently compelling justification. For the reasons that
follow, we conclude that appellants have stated a claim uponwhich relief can be granted under the Equal Protection
Clause. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 12(b)(6).

A

The Equal Protection Clause provides that "[n]o Stateshall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal

protection of the laws." U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, $ 1. Itscentral purpose is to prevent the States from purposefully
discriminating between individuals on the basis of race.
Washington v. Davis, 426 U. S. 229, 239 (1976). Laws thatexplicitly distinguish between individuals on racial grounds

fall within the core of that prohibition.No inquiry into legislative purpose is necessary when
the racial classification appears on the face of the statute.See

Personnel Administrator of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U. S.256, 272 (1979). Accord, Washington v. Seattle School Dist.

No. 1, 458 U. S. 457, 485 (1982). Express racial classifica-tions are immediately suspect because, "[a]bsent searching

fications are in fact motivated by illegitimate notions of racialinferiority or simple racial politics." Richmond v. J. A.

Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469, 493 (1989) (plurality opinion); id.,at 520 (

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment); see also UJO,430 U. S., at 172 (Brennan, J., concurring in part) ("[A] purportedly preferential race assignment may in fact disguise apolicy that perpetuates disadvantageous treatment of the
plan's supposed beneficiaries").Classifications of citizens solely on the basis of race "are
by their very nature odious to a free people whose institu-tions are founded upon the doctrine of equality." Hirabayashi v. United States, 320 U. S. 81, 100 (1943). Accord, Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1, 11 (1967). They threaten tostigmatize individuals by reason of their membership in a

racial group and to incite racial hostility. Croson, supra, at493 (plurality opinion); UJO, supra, at 173 (Brennan, J., concurring in part) ("[E]ven in the pursuit of remedial objec-tives, an explicit policy of assignment by race may serve to
stimulate our society's latent race consciousness, suggestingthe utility and propriety of basing decisions on a factor that
ideally bears no relationship to an individual's worth orneeds"). Accordingly, we have held that the Fourteenth
Amendment requires state legislation that expressly distin-guishes among citizens because of their race to be narrowly
tailored to further a compelling governmental interest.See,

e. g., Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Ed., 476 U. S. 267, 277-278 (1986) (plurality opinion);

id., at 285 (O'Connor, J., con-curring in part and concurring in judgment).

These principles apply not only to legislation that containsexplicit racial distinctions, but also to those "rare" statutes
that, although race neutral, are, on their face, "unexplainableon grounds other than race." Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U. S. 252, 266(1977). As we explained in

Feeney:

"A racial classification, regardless of purported motiva-tion, is presumptively invalid and can be upheld only

upon an extraordinary justification. Brown v. Board ofEducation, 347 U. S. 483; McLaughlin v. Florida, 379

U. S. 184. This rule applies as well to a classificationthat is ostensibly neutral but is an obvious pretext for
racial discrimination. Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U. S.356;

Guinn v. United States, 238 U. S. 347; cf. Lane v.Wilson, 307 U. S. 268; Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U. S.

Appellants contend that redistricting legislation that is sobizarre on its face that it is "unexplainable on grounds other

than race," Arlington Heights, supra, at 266, demands thesame close scrutiny that we give other state laws that classify citizens by race. Our voting rights precedents supportthat conclusion.

In Guinn v. United States, 238 U. S. 347 (1915), the Courtinvalidated under the Fifteenth Amendment a statute that
imposed a literacy requirement on voters but contained a"grandfather clause" applicable to individuals and their lineal
descendants entitled to vote "on [or prior to] January 1,1866." Id., at 357 (internal quotation marks omitted). The
determinative consideration for the Court was that the law,though ostensibly race neutral, on its face "embod[ied] no
exercise of judgment and rest[ed] upon no discernible rea-son" other than to circumvent the prohibitions of the Fifteenth Amendment. Id., at 363. In other words, the stat-ute was invalid because, on its face, it could not be explained
on grounds other than race.The Court applied the same reasoning to the "uncouth
twenty-eight-sided" municipal boundary line at issue inGomillion. Although the statute that redrew the city limits
of Tuskegee was race neutral on its face, plaintiffs allegedthat its effect was impermissibly to remove from the city
virtually all black voters and no white voters. The Courtreasoned:

645Cite as: 509 U. S. 630 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
"If these allegations upon a trial remained uncontra-dicted or unqualified, the conclusion would be irresistible, tantamount for all practical purposes to a mathe-matical demonstration, that the legislation is solely
concerned with segregating white and colored voters byfencing Negro citizens out of town so as to deprive them
of their pre-existing municipal vote." 364 U. S., at 341.
The majority resolved the case under the FifteenthAmendment.

Id., at 342-348. Justice Whittaker, however,concluded that the "unlawful segregation of races of citizens"

into different voting districts was cognizable under theEqual Protection Clause.

Id., at 349 (concurring opinion).This Court's subsequent reliance on Gomillion in other

Fourteenth Amendment cases suggests the correctness ofJustice Whittaker's view. See, e. g., Feeney, supra, at 272;
Whitcomb v. Chavis, 403 U. S. 124, 149 (1971); see also Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U. S. 55, 86 (1980) (Stevens, J., concur-ring in judgment) (Gomillion's holding "is compelled by the

Equal Protection Clause"). Gomillion thus supports appel-lants' contention that district lines obviously drawn for the
purpose of separating voters by race require careful scrutinyunder the Equal Protection Clause regardless of the motivations underlying their adoption.The Court extended the reasoning of

Gomillion to con-gressional districting in Wright v. Rockefeller, 376 U. S. 52

(1964). At issue in Wright were four districts contained ina New York apportionment statute. The plaintiffs alleged
that the statute excluded nonwhites from one district andconcentrated them in the other three. Id., at 53-54. Every
Member of the Court assumed that the plaintiffs' allegationthat the statute "segregate[d] eligible voters by race and
place of origin" stated a constitutional claim. Id., at 56 (in-ternal quotation marks omitted);

id., at 58 (Harlan, J., concur-ring); id., at 59-62 (Douglas, J., dissenting). The Justices

disagreed only as to whether the plaintiffs had carried theirburden of proof at trial. The dissenters thought the unusual

Opinion of the Court
shape of the district lines could "be explained only in racialterms."

Id., at 59. The majority, however, accepted the
District Court's finding that the plaintiffs had failed to estab-lish that the districts were in fact drawn on racial lines.

Although the boundary lines were somewhat irregular, the
majority reasoned, they were not so bizarre as to permit ofno other conclusion. Indeed, because most of the nonwhite

voters lived together in one area, it would have been difficultto construct voting districts without concentrations of nonwhite voters. Id., at 56-58.

Wright illustrates the difficulty of determining from the
face of a single-member districting plan that it purposefully
distinguishes between voters on the basis of race. A reapportionment statute typically does not classify persons at all;
it classifies tracts of land, or addresses. Moreover, redistricting differs from other kinds of state decisionmaking in
that the legislature always is aware of race when it draws
district lines, just as it is aware of age, economic status, religious and political persuasion, and a variety of other demographic factors. That sort of race consciousness does not
lead inevitably to impermissible race discrimination. As
Wright demonstrates, when members of a racial group live
together in one community, a reapportionment plan that concentrates members of the group in one district and excludes
them from others may reflect wholly legitimate purposes.
The district lines may be drawn, for example, to provide for
compact districts of contiguous territory, or to maintain the
integrity of political subdivisions. See Reynolds, 377 U. S.,
at 578 (recognizing these as legitimate state interests).

The difficulty of proof, of course, does not mean that a racial gerrymander, once established, should receive less scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause than other state
legislation classifying citizens by race. Moreover, it seems
clear to us that proof sometimes will not be difficult at all.
In some exceptional cases, a reapportionment plan may be
so highly irregular that, on its face, it rationally cannot be

Opinion of the Court
understood as anything other than an effort to "segregat[e]. . . voters" on the basis of race.

Gomillion, supra, at 341.
Gomillion, in which a tortured municipal boundary line wasdrawn to exclude black voters, was such a case. So, too,

would be a case in which a State concentrated a dispersed
minority population in a single district by disregarding tradi-tional districting principles such as compactness, contiguity,

and respect for political subdivisions. We emphasize thatthese criteria are important not because they are constitutionally required--they are not, cf. Gaffney v. Cummings,412 U. S. 735, 752, n. 18 (1973)--but because they are objective factors that may serve to defeat a claim that a district
has been gerrymandered on racial lines. Cf. Karcher v.
Daggett, 462 U. S. 725, 755 (1983) (Stevens, J., concurring)
("One need not use Justice Stewart's classic definition of obscenity--`I know it when I see it'--as an ultimate standard
for judging the constitutionality of a gerrymander to recognize that dramatically irregular shapes may have sufficient probative force to call for an explanation" (footnotes
omitted)).

Put differently, we believe that reapportionment is one
area in which appearances do matter. A reapportionment
plan that includes in one district individuals who belong to
the same race, but who are otherwise widely separated by
geographical and political boundaries, and who may have little in common with one another but the color of their skin,
bears an uncomfortable resemblance to political apartheid.
It reinforces the perception that members of the same racial
group--regardless of their age, education, economic status,
or the community in which they live--think alike, share the
same political interests, and will prefer the same candidates
at the polls. We have rejected such perceptions elsewhere
as impermissible racial stereotypes. See, e. g., Holland v.
Illinois, 493 U. S. 474, 484, n. 2 (1990) ("[A] prosecutor's assumption that a black juror may be presumed to be partial
simply because he is black . . . violates the Equal Protection

Clause" (internal quotation marks omitted)); see also Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co., 500 U. S. 614, 630-631
(1991) ("If our society is to continue to progress as a multiracial democracy, it must recognize that the automatic invocation of race stereotypes retards that progress and causes
continued hurt and injury"). By perpetuating such notions,
a racial gerrymander may exacerbate the very patterns of
racial bloc voting that majority-minority districting is sometimes said to counteract.

The message that such districting sends to elected representatives is equally pernicious. When a district obviously
is created solely to effectuate the perceived common interests of one racial group, elected officials are more likely to
believe that their primary obligation is to represent only the
members of that group, rather than their constituency as a
whole. This is altogether antithetical to our system of representative democracy. As Justice Douglas explained in his
dissent in Wright v. Rockefeller nearly 30 years ago:

"Here the individual is important, not his race, his creed,
or his color. The principle of equality is at war with
the notion that District A must be represented by a
Negro, as it is with the notion that District B must be
represented by a Caucasian, District C by a Jew, District D by a Catholic, and so on. . . . That system, by
whatever name it is called, is a divisive force in a community, emphasizing differences between candidates and
voters that are irrelevant in the constitutional sense. . . .. . . . .

"When racial or religious lines are drawn by the State,
the multiracial, multireligious communities that our
Constitution seeks to weld together as one become separatist; antagonisms that relate to race or to religion
rather than to political issues are generated; communities seek not the best representative but the best racial
or religious partisan. Since that system is at war with

Opinion of the Court
the democratic ideal, it should find no footing here."376 U. S., at 66-67.

For these reasons, we conclude that a plaintiff challenginga reapportionment statute under the Equal Protection
Clause may state a claim by alleging that the legislation,though race neutral on its face, rationally cannot be understood as anything other than an effort to separate voters intodifferent districts on the basis of race, and that the separation lacks sufficient justification. It is unnecessary for us todecide whether or how a reapportionment plan that, on its
face, can be explained in nonracial terms successfully could
be challenged. Thus, we express no view as to whether "theintentional creation of majority-minority districts, without

more," always gives rise to an equal protection claim. Post,at 668 (

White, J., dissenting). We hold only that, on the
facts of this case, appellants have stated a claim sufficient todefeat the state appellees' motion to dismiss.

C
The dissenters consider the circumstances of this case"functionally indistinguishable" from multimember districting and at-large voting systems, which are loosely describedas "other varieties of gerrymandering."

Post, at 671
(White, J., dissenting); see also post, at 684 (Souter, J., dis-senting). We have considered the constitutionality of these

practices in other Fourteenth Amendment cases and have
required plaintiffs to demonstrate that the challenged prac-tice has the purpose and effect of diluting a racial group's

voting strength. See, e. g., Rogers v. Lodge, 458 U. S. 613(1982) (at-large system);

Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U. S. 55 (1980)
(same); White v. Regester, 412 U. S. 755 (1973) (multimemberdistricts);

Whitcomb v. Chavis, 403 U. S. 124 (1971) (same);
see also supra, at 640-641. At-large and multimember
schemes, however, do not classify voters on the basis of race.

cial harms that are not present in our vote-dilution cases.It therefore warrants different analysis.

Justice Souter apparently believes that racial gerry-mandering is harmless unless it dilutes a racial group's voting strength. See post, at 684 (dissenting opinion). As we
have explained, however, reapportionment legislation thatcannot be understood as anything other than an effort to

classify and separate voters by race injures voters in otherways. It reinforces racial stereotypes and threatens to undermine our system of representative democracy by signal-ing to elected officials that they represent a particular racial
group rather than their constituency as a whole. See supra,
at 647-649. Justice Souter does not adequately explain
why these harms are not cognizable under the Fourteenth
Amendment.

The dissenters make two other arguments that cannot be
reconciled with our precedents. First, they suggest that a
racial gerrymander of the sort alleged here is functionally
equivalent to gerrymanders for nonracial purposes, such as
political gerrymanders. See post, at 679 (opinion of Stevens, J.); see also post, at 662-663 (opinion of White, J.).
This Court has held political gerrymanders to be justiciable
under the Equal Protection Clause. See Davis v. Bandemer, 478 U. S., at 118-127. But nothing in our case law compels the conclusion that racial and political gerrymanders are
subject to precisely the same constitutional scrutiny. In
fact, our country's long and persistent history of racial discrimination in voting--as well as our Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence, which always has reserved the strictest
scrutiny for discrimination on the basis of race, see supra, at
642-644--would seem to compel the opposite conclusion.

Second, Justice Stevens argues that racial gerrymandering poses no constitutional difficulties when district lines
are drawn to favor the minority, rather than the majority.
See post, at 678 (dissenting opinion). We have made clear,
however, that equal protection analysis "is not dependent

see also id., at 520 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment). Ac-cord, Wygant, 476 U. S., at 273 (plurality opinion). Indeed,
racial classifications receive close scrutiny even when theymay be said to burden or benefit the races equally. See
Powers v. Ohio, 499 U. S. 400, 410 (1991) ("It is axiomaticthat racial classifications do not become legitimate on the

White, J.); post, at 684, and n. 6 (opin-ion of
Souter, J.)--forecloses the claim we recognize today.
UJO concerned New York's revision of a reapportionmentplan to include additional majority-minority districts in response to the Attorney General's denial of administrativepreclearance under $ 5. In that regard, it closely resembles
the present case. But the cases are critically different inanother way. The plaintiffs in

UJO--members of a Hasidiccommunity split between two districts under New York's revised redistricting plan--did not allege that the plan, on itsface, was so highly irregular that it rationally could be understood only as an effort to segregate voters by race. In-deed, the facts of the case would not have supported such a
claim. Three Justices approved the New York statute, inpart, precisely because it adhered to traditional districting
principles:

"[W]e think it . . . permissible for a State, employing
sound districting principles such as compactness and
population equality, to attempt to prevent racial minor-ities from being repeatedly outvoted by creating districts that will afford fair representation to the membersof those racial groups who are sufficiently numerous and
whose residential patterns afford the opportunity ofcreating districts in which they will be in the majority."

Opinion of the Court
430 U. S., at 168 (opinion of White, J., joined by Stevens and Rehnquist, JJ.) (emphasis added).

As a majority of the Justices construed the complaint, the
UJO plaintiffs made a different claim: that the New York
plan impermissibly "diluted" their voting strength. Five of
the eight Justices who participated in the decision resolved
the case under the framework the Court previously had
adopted for vote-dilution cases. Three Justices rejected the
plaintiffs' claim on the grounds that the New York statute
"represented no racial slur or stigma with respect to whites
or any other race" and left white voters with better than
proportional representation. Id., at 165-166. Two others
concluded that the statute did not minimize or cancel out a
minority group's voting strength and that the State's intent
to comply with the Voting Rights Act, as interpreted by the
Department of Justice, "foreclose[d] any finding that [the
State] acted with the invidious purpose of discriminating
against white voters." Id., at 180 (Stewart, J., joined by
Powell, J., concurring in judgment).

The District Court below relied on these portions of UJO
to reject appellants' claim. See 808 F. Supp., at 472-473.
In our view, the court used the wrong analysis. UJO's
framework simply does not apply where, as here, a reapportionment plan is alleged to be so irrational on its face that it
immediately offends principles of racial equality. UJO set
forth a standard under which white voters can establish
unconstitutional vote dilution. But it did not purport to
overrule Gomillion or Wright. Nothing in the decision
precludes white voters (or voters of any other race) from
bringing the analytically distinct claim that a reapportionment plan rationally cannot be understood as anything other
than an effort to segregate citizens into separate voting
districts on the basis of race without sufficient justification.
Because appellants here stated such a claim, the District
Court erred in dismissing their complaint.

Opinion of the Court

IV
Justice Souter contends that exacting scrutiny of racialgerrymanders under the Fourteenth Amendment is inappropriate because reapportionment "nearly always require[s]some consideration of race for legitimate reasons."

Post, at680 (dissenting opinion). "As long as members of racial

groups have [a] commonality of interest" and "racial bloc vot-ing takes place," he argues, "legislators will have to take
race into account" in order to comply with the Voting RightsAct.

Ibid. Justice Souter's reasoning is flawed.Earlier this Term, we unanimously reaffirmed that racial

bloc voting and minority-group political cohesion never canbe assumed, but specifically must be proved in each case in
order to establish that a redistricting plan dilutes minorityvoting strength in violation of $ 2. See Growe v. Emison,
507 U. S. 25, 40-41 (1993) ("Unless these points are estab-lished, there neither has been a wrong nor can be a remedy").
That racial bloc voting or minority political cohesion may befound to exist in

some cases, of course, is no reason to treatall racial gerrymanders differently from other kinds of racial

classification. Justice Souter apparently views racial ger-rymandering of the type presented here as a special category
of "benign" racial discrimination that should be subject torelaxed judicial review. Cf.

post, at 684-685 (dissentingopinion). As we have said, however, the very reason that

the Equal Protection Clause demands strict scrutiny of allracial classifications is because without it, a court cannot determine whether or not the discrimination truly is "benign."See supra, at 642-643. Thus, if appellants' allegations of a
racial gerrymander are not contradicted on remand, the Dis-trict Court must determine whether the General Assembly's
reapportionment plan satisfies strict scrutiny. We thereforeconsider what that level of scrutiny requires in the reapportionment context.The state appellees suggest that a covered jurisdiction
may have a compelling interest in creating majority-minority

Opinion of the Court
districts in order to comply with the Voting Rights Act.The States certainly have a very strong interest in complying with federal antidiscrimination laws that are constitu-tionally valid as interpreted and as applied. But in the context of a Fourteenth Amendment challenge, courts must bear
in mind the difference between what the law permits andwhat it requires.

For example, on remand North Carolina might claim thatit adopted the revised plan in order to comply with the $ 5
"nonretrogression" principle. Under that principle, a pro-posed voting change cannot be precleared if it will lead to "a
retrogression in the position of racial minorities with respect
to their effective exercise of the electoral franchise." Beer
v. United States, 425 U. S. 130, 141 (1976). In Beer, we held
that a reapportionment plan that created one majorityminority district where none existed before passed muster
under $ 5 because it improved the position of racial minorities. Id., at 141-142; see also Richmond v. United States,
422 U. S. 358, 370-371 (1975) (annexation that reduces percentage of blacks in population satisfies $ 5 where postannexation districts "fairly reflect" current black voting
strength).

Although the Court concluded that the redistricting
scheme at issue in Beer was nonretrogressive, it did not hold
that the plan, for that reason, was immune from constitutional challenge. The Court expressly declined to reach
that question. See 425 U. S., at 142, n. 14. Indeed, the Voting Rights Act and our case law make clear that a reapportionment plan that satisfies $ 5 still may be enjoined as unconstitutional. See 42 U. S. C. $ 1973c (neither a declaratory
judgment by the District Court for the District of Columbia
nor preclearance by the Attorney General "shall bar a subsequent action to enjoin enforcement" of new voting practice);
Allen, 393 U. S., at 549-550 (after preclearance, "private parties may enjoin the enforcement of the new enactment . . .
in traditional suits attacking its constitutionality"). Thus,

655Cite as: 509 U. S. 630 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
we do not read Beer or any of our other $ 5 cases to givecovered jurisdictions

carte blanche to engage in racial gerrymandering in the name of nonretrogression. A reapportion-ment plan would not be narrowly tailored to the goal of

avoiding retrogression if the State went beyond what was
reasonably necessary to avoid retrogression. Our conclu-sion is supported by the plurality opinion in

UJO, in which
four Justices determined that New York's creation of addi-tional majority-minority districts was constitutional because

the plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate that the State "didmore than the Attorney General was authorized to

require
it to do under the nonretrogression principle of Beer." 430
U. S., at 162-163 (opinion of White, J., joined by Brennan,
Blackmun, and Stevens, JJ.) (emphasis added).

Before us, the state appellees contend that the General
Assembly's revised plan was necessary not to prevent retrogression, but to avoid dilution of black voting strength in
violation of $ 2, as construed in Thornburg v. Gingles, 478
U. S. 30 (1986). In Gingles the Court considered a multimember redistricting plan for the North Carolina State Legislature. The Court held that members of a racial minority
group claiming $ 2 vote dilution through the use of multimember districts must prove three threshold conditions: that
the minority group "is sufficiently large and geographically
compact to constitute a majority in a single-member district," that the minority group is "politically cohesive," and
that "the white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable
it . . . usually to defeat the minority's preferred candidate."
Id., at 50-51. We have indicated that similar preconditions
apply in $ 2 challenges to single-member districts. See
Voinovich v. Quilter, 507 U. S., at 157-158; Growe v. Emison,
507 U. S., at 40.

Appellants maintain that the General Assembly's revised
plan could not have been required by $ 2. They contend that
the State's black population is too dispersed to support two
geographically compact majority-black districts, as the bi509us3116I 03-28-97 20:17:49 PAGES OPINPGT
656 SHAW v. RENO

Opinion of the Court
zarre shape of District 12 demonstrates, and that there is noevidence of black political cohesion. They also contend that

recent black electoral successes demonstrate the willingnessof white voters in North Carolina to vote for black candidates. Appellants point out that blacks currently hold the
positions of State Auditor, Speaker of the North CarolinaHouse of Representatives, and chair of the North Carolina

State Board of Elections. They also point out that in 1990 ablack candidate defeated a white opponent in the Democratic
Party runoff for a United States Senate seat before beingdefeated narrowly by the Republican incumbent in the general election. Appellants further argue that if $ 2 did require adoption of North Carolina's revised plan, $ 2 is to that
extent unconstitutional. These arguments were not developed below, and the issues remain open for consideration on
remand.

The state appellees alternatively argue that the General
Assembly's plan advanced a compelling interest entirely distinct from the Voting Rights Act. We previously have recognized a significant state interest in eradicating the effects
of past racial discrimination. See, e. g., Croson, 488 U. S., at
491-493 (opinion of O'Connor, J., joined by Rehnquist,
C. J., and White, J.); id., at 518 (Kennedy, J., concurring in
part and concurring in judgment); Wygant, 476 U. S., at 280-
282 (plurality opinion); id., at 286 (O'Connor, J., concurring
in part and concurring in judgment). But the State must
have a " `strong basis in evidence for [concluding] that remedial action [is] necessary.' " Croson, supra, at 500 (quoting
Wygant, supra, at 277 (plurality opinion)).

The state appellees submit that two pieces of evidence
gave the General Assembly a strong basis for believing that
remedial action was warranted here: the Attorney General's
imposition of the $ 5 preclearance requirement on 40 North
Carolina counties, and the Gingles District Court's findings
of a long history of official racial discrimination in North Carolina's political system and of pervasive racial bloc voting.

Opinion of the Court
The state appellees assert that the deliberate creation ofmajority-minority districts is the most precise way--indeed

the only effective way--to overcome the effects of raciallypolarized voting. This question also need not be decided at
this stage of the litigation. We note, however, that onlythree Justices in

UJO were prepared to say that States havea significant interest in minimizing the consequences of racial bloc voting apart from the requirements of the VotingRights Act. And those three Justices specifically concluded
that race-based districting, as a response to racially polarizedvoting, is constitutionally permissible only when the State
"employ[s] sound districting principles," and only when theaffected racial group's "residential patterns afford the
opportunity of creating districts in which they will be in themajority." 430 U. S., at 167-168 (opinion of

White, J., joinedby
Stevens and Rehnquist, JJ.).

V
Racial classifications of any sort pose the risk of lastingharm to our society. They reinforce the belief, held by too

many for too much of our history, that individuals should bejudged by the color of their skin. Racial classifications with
respect to voting carry particular dangers. Racial gerry-mandering, even for remedial purposes, may balkanize us
into competing racial factions; it threatens to carry us fur-ther from the goal of a political system in which race no
longer matters--a goal that the Fourteenth and FifteenthAmendments embody, and to which the Nation continues to
aspire. It is for these reasons that race-based districting byour state legislatures demands close judicial scrutiny.

In this case, the Attorney General suggested that NorthCarolina could have created a reasonably compact second
majority-minority district in the south-central to southeast-ern part of the State. We express no view as to whether
appellants successfully could have challenged such a districtunder the Fourteenth Amendment. We also do not decide

509us3116I 03-28-97 20:17:49 PAGES OPINPGT
658 SHAW v. RENO

White, J., dissenting
whether appellants' complaint stated a claim under constitutional provisions other than the Fourteenth Amendment.
Today we hold only that appellants have stated a claim under
the Equal Protection Clause by alleging that the North Carolina General Assembly adopted a reapportionment scheme
so irrational on its face that it can be understood only as
an effort to segregate voters into separate voting districts
because of their race, and that the separation lacks sufficient
justification. If the allegation of racial gerrymandering remains uncontradicted, the District Court further must determine whether the North Carolina plan is narrowly tailored
to further a compelling governmental interest. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the District Court and
remand the case for further proceedings consistent with
this opinion.

It is so ordered.

[Appendix containing map of North Carolina Congressional Plan follows this page.]

Justice White, with whom Justice Blackmun and
Justice Stevens join, dissenting.

The facts of this case mirror those presented in United
Jewish Organizations of Williamsburgh, Inc. v. Carey, 430
U. S. 144 (1977) (UJO), where the Court rejected a claim
that creation of a majority-minority district violated the
Constitution, either as a per se matter or in light of the circumstances leading to the creation of such a district. Of
particular relevance, five of the Justices reasoned that members of the white majority could not plausibly argue that
their influence over the political process had been unfairly
canceled, see id., at 165-168 (opinion of White, J., joined by
Rehnquist and Stevens, JJ.), or that such had been the
State's intent, see id., at 179-180 (Stewart, J., joined by Powell, J., concurring in judgment). Accordingly, they held that
plaintiffs were not entitled to relief under the Constitution's

Equal Protection Clause. On the same reasoning, I wouldaffirm the District Court's dismissal of appellants' claim in

this instance.The Court today chooses not to overrule, but rather to
sidestep, UJO. It does so by glossing over the striking simi-larities, focusing on surface differences, most notably the (admittedly unusual) shape of the newly created district, andimagining an entirely new cause of action. Because the
holding is limited to such anomalous circumstances, ante, at649, it perhaps will not substantially hamper a State's legitimate efforts to redistrict in favor of racial minorities. None-theless, the notion that North Carolina's plan, under which
whites remain a voting majority in a disproportionate num-ber of congressional districts, and pursuant to which the
State has sent its first black representatives since Recon-struction to the United States Congress, might have violated
appellants' constitutional rights is both a fiction and a depar-ture from settled equal protection principles. Seeing no
good reason to engage in either, I dissent.

I
A

The grounds for my disagreement with the majority aresimply stated: Appellants have not presented a cognizable

claim, because they have not alleged a cognizable injury. Todate, we have held that only two types of state voting practices could give rise to a constitutional claim. The first in-volves direct and outright deprivation of the right to vote,
for example by means of a poll tax or literacy test. See,
e. g., Guinn v. United States, 238 U. S. 347 (1915). Plainly,this variety is not implicated by appellants' allegations and

need not detain us further. The second type of unconstitu-tional practice is that which "affects the political strength of
various groups," Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U. S. 55, 83 (1980)(

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment), in violation of theEqual Protection Clause. As for this latter category, we

509us3116I 03-28-97 20:17:50 PAGES OPINPGT
660 SHAW v. RENO

White, J., dissenting
have insisted that members of the political or racial groupdemonstrate that the challenged action have the intent

and effect of unduly diminishing their influence on the po-litical process.

1 Although this severe burden has limited

the number of successful suits, it was adopted for soundreasons.

The central explanation has to do with the nature of theredistricting process. As the majority recognizes, "redistricting differs from other kinds of state decisionmaking inthat the legislature always is

aware of race when it drawsdistrict lines, just as it is aware of age, economic status,

religious and political persuasion, and a variety of otherdemographic factors."

Ante, at 646 (emphasis in original)."Being aware," in this context, is shorthand for "taking

into account," and it hardly can be doubted that legislatorsroutinely engage in the business of making electoral predictions based on group characteristics--racial, ethnic, and thelike.

"[L]ike bloc-voting by race, [the racial composition ofgeographic area] too is a fact of life, well known to those
responsible for drawing electoral district lines. Theselawmakers are quite aware that the districts they create
will have a white or a black majority; and with each newdistrict comes the unavoidable choice as to the racial
composition of the district." Beer v. United States, 425U. S. 130, 144 (1976) (

White, J., dissenting).

As we have said, "it requires no special genius to recognizethe political consequences of drawing a district line along

one street rather than another." Gaffney v. Cummings, 412

1 It has been argued that the required showing of discriminatory effect
should be lessened once a plaintiff successfully demonstrates intentional
discrimination. See Garza v. County of Los Angeles, 918 F. 2d 763, 771
(CA9 1990). Although I would leave this question for another day, I
would note that even then courts have insisted on "some showing of injury
. . . to assure that the district court can impose a meaningful remedy."

U. S. 735, 753 (1973); see also Mobile v. Bolden, supra, at86-87 (

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment). Becauseextirpating such considerations from the redistricting process is unrealistic, the Court has not invalidated all plansthat consciously use race, but rather has looked at their
impact.Redistricting plans also reflect group interests and inevitably are conceived with partisan aims in mind. To allowjudicial interference whenever this occurs would be to invite
constant and unmanageable intrusion. Moreover, a group'spower to affect the political process does not automatically
dissipate by virtue of an electoral loss. Accordingly, wehave asked that an identifiable group demonstrate more than
mere lack of success at the polls to make out a successfulgerrymandering claim. See,

e. g., White v. Regester, 412U. S. 755, 765-766 (1973); Whitcomb v. Chavis, 403 U. S. 124,

153-155 (1971).With these considerations in mind, we have limited such
claims by insisting upon a showing that "the political proc-esses . . . were not equally open to participation by the group
in question--that its members had less opportunity than didother residents in the district to participate in the political
processes and to elect legislators of their choice." White v.
Regester, supra, at 766. Indeed, as a brief survey of deci-sions illustrates, the Court's gerrymandering cases all carry

this theme--that it is not mere suffering at the polls butdiscrimination in the polity with which the Constitution is
concerned.In

Whitcomb v. Chavis, 403 U. S., at 149, we searched invain for evidence that black voters "had less opportunity

than did other . . . residents to participate in the politicalprocesses and to elect legislators of their choice." More
generally, we remarked:

"The mere fact that one interest group or another con-cerned with the outcome of [the district's] elections has

found itself outvoted and without legislative seats of its

White, J., dissenting
own provides no basis for invoking constitutional reme-dies where . . . there is no indication that this segment

of the population is being denied access to the politicalsystem." Id., at 154-155.

Again, in White v. Regester, supra, the same criteria wereused to uphold the District Court's finding that a redistricting plan was unconstitutional. The "historic and presentcondition" of the Mexican-American community, id., at 767, a
status of cultural and economic marginality, id., at 768, aswell as the legislature's unresponsiveness to the group's interests, id., at 768-769, justified the conclusion that Mexican-Americans were " `effectively removed from the political
processes,' " and "invidiously excluded . . . from effective par-ticipation in political life,"

id., at 769. Other decisions of thisCourt adhere to the same standards. See Rogers v. Lodge,

458 U. S. 613, 624-626 (1982); Chapman v. Meier, 420 U. S.1, 17 (1975) (requiring proof that "the group has been denied
access to the political process equal to the access of othergroups").

2

I summed up my views on this matter in the pluralityopinion in Davis v. Bandemer, 478 U. S. 109 (1986).

3 Because districting inevitably is the expression of interestgroup politics, and because "the power to influence the political process is not limited to winning elections," id., at 132,

2 It should be noted that $ 2 of the Voting Rights Act forbids any State
to impose specified devices or procedures that result in a denial or abridgment of the right to vote on account of race or color. Section 2 also provides that a violation of that prohibition "is established if, based on
the totality of circumstances, it is shown that the political processes leading to nomination or election . . . are not equally open to participation
by members of a [protected] class . . . in that its members have less
opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the
political process and to elect representatives of their choice." 42 U. S. C.

$ 1973(b).

3 Although Davis involved political groups, the principles were expressly

drawn from the Court's racial gerrymandering cases. See 478 U. S., at
131, n. 12 (plurality opinion).

White, J., dissenting
the question in gerrymandering cases is "whether a particu-lar group has been unconstitutionally denied its chance to

effectively influence the political process," id., at 132-133.Thus, "an equal protection violation may be found only
where the electoral system substantially disadvantages certain voters in their opportunity to influence the politicalprocess effectively." Id., at 133 (emphasis added). By this,

I meant that the group must exhibit "strong indicia of lackof political power and the denial of fair representation," so
that it could be said that it has "essentially been shut out ofthe political process." Id., at 139. In short, even assuming
that racial (or political) factors were considered in the draw-ing of district boundaries, a showing of discriminatory effects is a "threshold requirement" in the absence of which
there is no equal protection violation, id., at 143, and no needto "reach the question of the state interests . . . served by

the particular districts," id., at 142.4To distinguish a claim that alleges that the redistricting
scheme has discriminatory intent and effect from one thatdoes not has nothing to do with dividing racial classifications between the "benign" and the malicious--an enter-prise which, as the majority notes, the Court has treated
with skepticism. See ante, at 642-643. Rather, the issueis whether the classification based on race discriminates

4 Although disagreeing with the Court's holding in Davis that claims
of political gerrymandering are justiciable, see id., at 144 (O'Connor, J.,
concurring in judgment), the author of today's opinion expressed views on
racial gerrymandering quite similar to my own:

"[W]here a racial minority group is characterized by `the traditional indicia of suspectness' and is vulnerable to exclusion from the political process
. . . individual voters who belong to that group enjoy some measure of
protection against intentional dilution of their group voting strength by
means of racial gerrymandering. . . . Even so, the individual's right is
infringed only if the racial minority can prove that it has `essentially
been shut out of the political process.' " Id., at 151-152 (emphasis added).
As explained below, that position cannot be squared with the one taken
by the majority in this case.

against anyone by denying equal access to the political proc-ess. Even Members of the Court least inclined to approve

of race-based remedial measures have acknowledged the sig-nificance of this factor. See Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U. S.
448, 524-525, n. 3 (1980) (Stewart, J., dissenting) ("No personin

[UJO] was deprived of his electoral franchise"); Regentsof Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265, 304-305 (1978)

(Powell, J.) ("United Jewish Organizations . . . properly isviewed as a case in which the remedy for an administrative
finding of discrimination encompassed measures to improvethe previously disadvantaged group's ability to participate,
without excluding individuals belonging to any other group
from enjoyment of the relevant opportunity--meaningfulparticipation in the electoral process") (emphasis added).

B
The most compelling evidence of the Court's position priorto this day, for it is most directly on point, is UJO, 430 U. S.

144 (1977). The Court characterizes the decision as "highlyfractured," ante, at 651, but that should not detract attention
from the rejection by a majority in UJO of the claim thatthe State's intentional creation of majority-minority districts
transgressed constitutional norms. As stated above, fiveJustices were of the view that, absent any contention that
the proposed plan was adopted with the intent, or had theeffect, of unduly minimizing the white majority's voting
strength, the Fourteenth Amendment was not implicated.Writing for three Members of the Court, I justified this conclusion as follows:

"It is true that New York deliberately increased thenonwhite majorities in certain districts in order to enhance the opportunity for election of nonwhite repre-sentatives from those districts. Nevertheless, there
was no fencing out of the white population from partici-pation in the political processes of the county, and the

White, J., dissenting
plan did not minimize or unfairly cancel out white votingstrength." 430 U. S., at 165.

In a similar vein, Justice Stewart was joined by JusticePowell in stating:

"The petitioners have made no showing that a racialcriterion was used as a basis for denying them their
right to vote, in contravention of the Fifteenth Amend-ment. See Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U. S. 339. They

have made no showing that the redistricting scheme wasemployed as part of a `contrivance to segregate'; to minimize or cancel out the voting strength of a minority classor interest; or otherwise to impair or burden the opportunity of affected persons to participate in the politicalprocess."

Id., at 179 (opinion concurring in judgment)(some citations omitted).

Under either formulation, it is irrefutable that appellantsin this proceeding likewise have failed to state a claim. As
was the case in New York, a number of North Carolina'spolitical subdivisions have interfered with black citizens'
meaningful exercise of the franchise and are therefore sub-ject to $$ 4 and 5 of the Voting Rights Act. Cf. UJO, supra,
at 148. In other words, North Carolina was found by Con-gress to have " `resorted to the extraordinary stratagem of
contriving new rules of various kinds for the sole purposeof perpetuating voting discrimination in the face of adverse
federal court decrees' " and therefore "would be likely to en-gage in `similar maneuvers in the future in order to evade
the remedies for voting discrimination contained in the Actitself.' "

the Attorney General's satisfaction that its proposed redistricting had neither the purpose nor the effect of abridging
the right to vote on account of race or color. Cf. UJO, supra,
at 150. The Attorney General's interposition of a $ 5 objection "properly is viewed" as "an administrative finding of
discrimination" against a racial minority. Regents of Univ.
of Cal. v. Bakke, supra, at 305 (opinion of Powell, J.). Finally, like New York, North Carolina reacted by modifying
its plan and creating additional majority-minority districts.
Cf. UJO, supra, at 151-152.

In light of this background, it strains credulity to suggest
that North Carolina's purpose in creating a second majorityminority district was to discriminate against members of the
majority group by "impair[ing] or burden[ing their] opportunity . . . to participate in the political process." Id., at 179
(Stewart, J., concurring in judgment). The State has made
no mystery of its intent, which was to respond to the Attorney General's objections, see Brief for State Appellees 13-14,
by improving the minority group's prospects of electing a
candidate of its choice. I doubt that this constitutes a
discriminatory purpose as defined in the Court's equal
protection cases--i. e., an intent to aggravate "the unequal
distribution of electoral power." Post, at 678 (Stevens, J.,
dissenting). But even assuming that it does, there is no
question that appellants have not alleged the requisite discriminatory effects. Whites constitute roughly 76% of the
total population and 79% of the voting age population in
North Carolina. Yet, under the State's plan, they still constitute a voting majority in 10 (or 83%) of the 12 congressional districts. Though they might be dissatisfied at the
prospect of casting a vote for a losing candidate--a lot shared
by many, including a disproportionate number of minorits black citizens with respect to their exercise of the voting franchise from
approximately 1900 to 1970 by employing a poll tax [and] a literacy test."

ity voters--surely they cannot complain of discriminatorytreatment.

II
The majority attempts to distinguish UJO by imagining aheretofore unknown type of constitutional claim. In its

words, "UJO set forth a standard under which white voterscan establish unconstitutional vote dilution. . . . Nothing in
the decision precludes white voters (or voters of any otherrace) from bringing the analytically distinct claim that a reapportionment plan rationally cannot be understood as any-thing other than an effort to segregate citizens into separate
voting districts on the basis of race without sufficient justifi-cation." Ante, at 652. There is no support for this distinction in UJO, and no authority in the cases relied on by theCourt either. More importantly, the majority's submission
does not withstand analysis. The logic of its theory appearsto be that race-conscious redistricting that "segregates" by
drawing odd-shaped lines is qualitatively different fromrace-conscious redistricting that affects groups in some other
way. The distinction is without foundation.

A
The essence of the majority's argument is that UJO dealtwith a claim of vote dilution--which required a specific showing of harm--and that cases such as Gomillion v. Lightfoot,364 U. S. 339 (1960), and

Wright v. Rockefeller, 376 U. S. 52(1964), dealt with claims of racial segregation--which did

not. I read these decisions quite differently. Petitioners'

6 This is not to say that a group that has been afforded roughly proportional representation never can make out a claim of unconstitutional discrimination. Such districting might have both the intent and effect of
"packing" members of the group so as to deprive them of any influence in
other districts. Again, however, the equal protection inquiry should look
at the group's overall influence over, and treatment by, elected representatives and the political process as a whole.

White, J., dissenting
claim in UJO was that the State had "violated the Four-teenth and Fifteenth Amendments by

deliberately revising
its reapportionment plan along racial lines." 430 U. S., at155 (plurality opinion) (emphasis added). They also stated:

" `Our argument is . . . that the history of the area demonstrates that there could be--and in fact was--no reason
other than race to divide the community at this time.' " Id.,
at 154, n. 14 (quoting Brief for Petitioners, O. T. 1976, No.75-104, p. 6, n. 6) (emphasis in original). Nor was it ever in

doubt that "the State deliberately used race in a purposefulmanner." 430 U. S., at 165. In other words, the "analytically distinct claim" the majority discovers today was in plain
view and did not carry the day for petitioners. The fact that
a demonstration of discriminatory effect was required in that
case was not a function of the kind of claim that was made.
It was a function of the type of injury upon which the
Court insisted.

Gomillion is consistent with this view. To begin, the
Court's reliance on that case as the font of its novel type
of claim is curious. Justice Frankfurter characterized the
complaint as alleging a deprivation of the right to vote in
violation of the Fifteenth Amendment. See 364 U. S., at
341, 346. Regardless whether that description was accurate, see ante, at 645, it seriously deflates the precedential
value which the majority seeks to ascribe to Gomillion: As
I see it, the case cannot stand for the proposition that the
intentional creation of majority-minority districts, without
more, gives rise to an equal protection challenge under the
Fourteenth Amendment. But even recast as a Fourteenth
Amendment case, Gomillion does not assist the majority, for
its focus was on the alleged effect of the city's action, which
was to exclude black voters from the municipality of Tuskegee. As the Court noted, the "inevitable effect of this
redefinition of Tuskegee's boundaries" was "to deprive the
Negro petitioners discriminatorily of the benefits of residence in Tuskegee." 364 U. S., at 341. Even Justice Whit509us3116I 03-28-97 20:17:50 PAGES OPINPGT

White, J., dissenting
taker's concurrence appears to be premised on the notionthat black citizens were being "fenc[ed] out" of municipal

benefits. Id., at 349. Subsequent decisions of this Courthave similarly interpreted

Gomillion as turning on the
unconstitutional effect of the legislation. See Palmer v.
Thompson, 403 U. S. 217, 225 (1971); United States v.
O'Brien, 391 U. S. 367, 385 (1968). In Gomillion, in short,
the group that formed the majority at the state level pur-portedly set out to manipulate city boundaries in order to

remove members of the minority, thereby denying them val-uable municipal services. No analogous purpose or effect
has been alleged in this case.

The only other case invoked by the majority is Wright v.
Rockefeller, supra. Wright involved a challenge to a legislative plan that created four districts. In the 17th, 19th, and
20th Districts, whites constituted respectively 94.9%, 71.5%,
and 72.5% of the population. 86.3% of the population in the
18th District was classified as nonwhite or Puerto Rican.
See Wright v. Rockefeller, 211 F. Supp. 460, 472 (SDNY 1962)
(Murphy, J., dissenting); 376 U. S., at 54. The plaintiffs alleged that the plan was drawn with the intent to segregate
voters on the basis of race, in violation of the Fourteenth and
Fifteenth Amendments. Id., at 53-54. The Court affirmed
the District Court's dismissal of the complaint on the ground
that plaintiffs had not met their burden of proving discriminatory intent. See id., at 55, 58. I fail to see how a decision
based on a failure to establish discriminatory intent can support the inference that it is unnecessary to prove discriminatory effect.

Wright is relevant only to the extent that it illustrates a
proposition with which I have no problem: that a complaint
stating that a plan has carved out districts on the basis of
race can, under certain circumstances, state a claim under
the Fourteenth Amendment. To that end, however, there
must be an allegation of discriminatory purpose and effect,
for the constitutionality of a race-conscious redistricting plan

White, J., dissenting
depends on these twin elements. In Wright, for example,the facts might have supported the contention that the

districts were intended to, and did in fact, shield the 17thDistrict from any minority influence and "pack" black and
Puerto Rican voters in the 18th, thereby invidiously min-imizing their voting strength. In other words, the purposeful creation of a majority-minority district could havediscriminatory effect if it is achieved by means of "packing"--i. e., overconcentration of minority voters. In thepresent case, the facts could sustain no such allegation.

B
Lacking support in any of the Court's precedents, the ma-jority's novel type of claim also makes no sense. As I understand the theory that is put forth, a redistricting plan thatuses race to "segregate" voters by drawing "uncouth" lines
is harmful in a way that a plan that uses race to distributevoters differently is not, for the former "bears an uncomfortable resemblance to political apartheid." See ante, at 647.The distinction is untenable.

Racial gerrymanders come in various shades: At-largevoting schemes, see, e. g., White v. Regester, 412 U. S. 755
(1973); the fragmentation of a minority group among variousdistricts "so that it is a majority in none,"

Voinovich v.Quilter, 507 U. S. 146, 153 (1993), otherwise known as "cracking," cf. Connor v. Finch, 431 U. S. 407, 422 (1977); the"stacking" of "a large minority population concentration . . .
with a larger white population," Parker, Racial Gerryman-dering and Legislative Reapportionment, in Minority Vote
Dilution 85, 92 (C. Davidson ed. 1984); and, finally, the "con-centration of [minority voters] into districts where they constitute an excessive majority," Thornburg v. Gingles, 478U. S. 30, 46, n. 11 (1986), also called "packing,"

Voinovich,supra, at 153. In each instance, race is consciously utilized

by the legislature for electoral purposes; in each instance, wehave put the plaintiff challenging the district lines to the

burden of demonstrating that the plan was meant to, and didin fact, exclude an identifiable racial group from participation

in the political process.Not so, apparently, when the districting "segregates" by
drawing odd-shaped lines.7 In that case, we are told, suchproof no longer is needed. Instead, it is the State that must
rebut the allegation that race was taken into account, a factthat, together with the legislators' consideration of ethnic,
religious, and other group characteristics, I had thought wepractically took for granted, see

supra, at 660. Part of theexplanation for the majority's approach has to do, perhaps,

with the emotions stirred by words such as "segregation"and "political apartheid." But their loose and imprecise use
by today's majority has, I fear, led it astray. See n. 7, supra.The consideration of race in "segregation" cases is no different than in other race-conscious districting; from the standpoint of the affected groups, moreover, the line-drawings allact in similar fashion.

8 A plan that "segregates" being functionally indistinguishable from any of the other varieties ofgerrymandering, we should be consistent in what we require

from a claimant: proof of discriminatory purpose and effect.The other part of the majority's explanation of its holding is related to its simultaneous discomfort and fascinationwith irregularly shaped districts. Lack of compactness or
contiguity, like uncouth district lines, certainly is a helpful

7 I borrow the term "segregate" from the majority, but, given its historical connotation, believe that its use is ill advised. Nor is it a particularly
accurate description of what has occurred. The majority-minority district
that is at the center of the controversy is, according to the State, 54.71%
African-American. Brief for State Appellees 5, n. 6. Even if racial distribution was a factor, no racial group can be said to have been "segregated"--i. e., "set apart" or "isolate[d]." Webster's Collegiate Dictionary
1063 (9th ed. 1983).

8 The black plaintiffs in Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U. S. 339 (1960), I

am confident, would have suffered equally had whites in Tuskegee sought
to maintain their control by annexing predominantly white suburbs, rather
than splitting the municipality in two.

indicator that some form of gerrymandering (racial or other)might have taken place and that "something may be amiss."

Karcher v. Daggett, 462 U. S. 725, 758 (1983) (Stevens, J.,concurring). Cf.

Connor, supra, at 425. Disregard for geographic divisions and compactness often goes hand in hand
with partisan gerrymandering. See Karcher, supra, at 776(

White, J., dissenting); Wells v. Rockefeller, 394 U. S. 542,
554 (1969) (White, J., dissenting).But while district irregularities may provide strong indicia

of a potential gerrymander, they do no more than that. Inparticular, they have no bearing on whether the plan ultimately is found to violate the Constitution. Given two dis-tricts drawn on similar, race-based grounds, the one does not
become more injurious than the other simply by virtue of
being snakelike, at least so far as the Constitution is con-cerned and absent any evidence of differential racial impact.

The majority's contrary view is perplexing in light of itsconcession that "compactness or attractiveness has never
been held to constitute an independent federal constitutionalrequirement for state legislative districts."

Gaffney, 412
U. S., at 752, n. 18; see ante, at 647. It is shortsighted aswell, for a regularly shaped district can just as effectively

effectuate racially discriminatory gerrymandering as an
odd-shaped one.9 By focusing on looks rather than impact,the majority "immediately casts attention in the wrong

direction--toward superficialities of shape and size, rather
than toward the political realities of district composition."

Law and Politics 459 (1968).

9 As has been remarked, "[d]ragons, bacon strips, dumbbells and other

drawn district may turn out to have been skillfully constructed with an
intent to aid one party." Sickels, Dragons, Bacon Strips, and Dumbbells--Who's Afraid of Reapportionment?, 75 Yale L. J. 1300 (1966).

Limited by its own terms to cases involving unusuallyshaped districts, the Court's approach nonetheless will unnecessarily hinder to some extent a State's voluntary effortto ensure a modicum of minority representation. This will
be true in areas where the minority population is geographi-cally dispersed. It also will be true where the minority population is not scattered but, for reasons unrelated to race--for example incumbency protection--the State would rather
not create the majority-minority district in its most "obvi-ous" location.

10 When, as is the case here, the creation of

10 This appears to be what has occurred in this instance. In providing
the reasons for the objection, the Attorney General noted that "[f]or the
south-central to southeast area, there were several plans drawn providing
for a second majority-minority congressional district" and that such a district would have been no more irregular than others in the State's plan.
See App. to Brief for Federal Appellees 10a. North Carolina's decision to
create a majority-minority district can be explained as an attempt to meet
this objection. Its decision not to create the more compact southern
majority-minority district that was suggested, on the other hand, was
more likely a result of partisan considerations. Indeed, in a suit brought
prior to this one, different plaintiffs charged that District 12 was "grossly
contorted" and had "no logical explanation other than incumbency protection and the enhancement of Democratic partisan interests. . . . The plan
. . . ignores the directive of the [Department of Justice] to create a minority district in the southeastern portion of North Carolina since any such
district would jeopardize the reelection of . . . the Democratic incumbent."
App. to Juris. Statement, O. T. 1991, No. 91-2038, p. 43a (Complaint in

one writer has observed that "understanding why the configurations are
shaped as they are requires us to know at least as much about the interests
of incumbent Democratic politicians, as it does knowledge of the Voting

caused them to be `shut out of the political process.' " Pope v. Blue, 809

a majority-minority district does not unfairly minimize the
voting power of any other group, the Constitution does not
justify, much less mandate, such obstruction. We said as
much in Gaffney:

"[C]ourts have [no] constitutional warrant to invalidate a
state plan, otherwise within tolerable population limits,
because it undertakes, not to minimize or eliminate the
political strength of any group or party, but to recognize
it and, through districting, provide a rough sort of proportional representation in the legislative halls of the
State." 412 U. S., at 754.

III
Although I disagree with the holding that appellants' claim
is cognizable, the Court's discussion of the level of scrutiny
it requires warrants a few comments. I have no doubt that
a State's compliance with the Voting Rights Act clearly constitutes a compelling interest. Cf. UJO, 430 U. S., at 162-
165 (opinion of White, J.); id., at 175-179 (Brennan, J., concurring in part); id., at 180 (Stewart, J., concurring in
judgment). Here, the Attorney General objected to the
State's plan on the ground that it failed to draw a second
majority-minority district for what appeared to be pretextual reasons. Rather than challenge this conclusion, North
Carolina chose to draw the second district. As UJO held, a
State is entitled to take such action. See also Wygant v.
Jackson Bd. of Ed., 476 U. S. 267, 291 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).

The Court, while seemingly agreeing with this position,
warns that the State's redistricting effort must be "narrowly
tailored" to further its interest in complying with the law.
Ante, at 658. It is evident to me, however, that what North
Carolina did was precisely tailored to meet the objection of
the Attorney General to its prior plan. Hence, I see no need

509us3116I 03-28-97 20:17:50 PAGES OPINPGT

675Cite as: 509 U. S. 630 (1993)
White, J., dissenting
for a remand at all, even accepting the majority's basic ap-proach to this case.

Furthermore, how it intends to manage this standard, I donot know. Is it more "narrowly tailored" to create an irregular majority-minority district as opposed to one that is com-pact but harms other state interests such as incumbency
protection or the representation of rural interests? Of thefollowing two options--creation of two minority influence
districts or of a single majority-minority district--is one"narrowly tailored" and the other not? Once the Attorney
General has found that a proposed redistricting change vio-lates $ 5's nonretrogression principle in that it will abridge a
racial minority's right to vote, does "narrow tailoring" meanthat the most the State can do is preserve the status quo?
Or can it maintain that change, while attempting to enhanceminority voting power in some other manner? This small
sample only begins to scratch the surface of the problemsraised by the majority's test. But it suffices to illustrate the
unworkability of a standard that is divorced from any meas-ure of constitutional harm. In that, state efforts to remedy
minority vote dilution are wholly unlike what typically hasbeen labeled "affirmative action." To the extent that no
other racial group is injured, remedying a Voting Rights Actviolation does not involve preferential treatment. Cf.

Wy-gant, supra, at 295 (
White, J., concurring in judgment). Itinvolves, instead, an attempt to

equalize treatment, and toprovide minority voters with an effective voice in the political process. The Equal Protection Clause of the Constitu-tion, surely, does not stand in the way.

IV
Since I do not agree that appellants alleged an equal protection violation and because the Court of Appeals faithfullyfollowed the Court's prior cases, I dissent and would affirm

the judgment below.

Justice Blackmun, dissenting.
I join Justice White's dissenting opinion. I did not join
Part IV of his opinion in United Jewish Organizations of
Williamsburgh, Inc. v. Carey, 430 U. S. 144 (1977), because I
felt that its "additional argument," id., at 165, was not necessary to decide that case. I nevertheless agree that the conscious use of race in redistricting does not violate the Equal
Protection Clause unless the effect of the redistricting plan
is to deny a particular group equal access to the political
process or to minimize its voting strength unduly. See, e. g.,
Chapman v. Meier, 420 U. S. 1, 17 (1975); White v. Regester,
412 U. S. 755, 765-766 (1973). It is particularly ironic that
the case in which today's majority chooses to abandon settled
law and to recognize for the first time this "analytically distinct" constitutional claim, ante, at 652, is a challenge by
white voters to the plan under which North Carolina has
sent black representatives to Congress for the first time
since Reconstruction. I dissent.

Justice Stevens, dissenting.
For the reasons stated by Justice White, the decision of
the District Court should be affirmed. I add these comments to emphasize that the two critical facts in this case
are undisputed: First, the shape of District 12 is so bizarre
that it must have been drawn for the purpose of either advantaging or disadvantaging a cognizable group of voters;
and, second, regardless of that shape, it was drawn for the
purpose of facilitating the election of a second black representative from North Carolina.

These unarguable facts, which the Court devotes most of
its opinion to proving, give rise to three constitutional questions: Does the Constitution impose a requirement of contiguity or compactness on how the States may draw their electoral districts? Does the Equal Protection Clause prevent
a State from drawing district boundaries for the purpose of

509us3116I 03-28-97 20:17:50 PAGES OPINPGT

Stevens, J., dissenting
facilitating the election of a member of an identifiable groupof voters? And, finally, if the answer to the second question

is generally "No," should it be different when the favoredgroup is defined by race? Since I have already written at
length about these questions,1 my negative answer to eachcan be briefly explained.

The first question is easy. There is no independent consti-tutional requirement of compactness or contiguity, and the
Court's opinion (despite its many references to the shape ofDistrict 12, see

ante, at 635-636, 641, 642, 644-648) does notsuggest otherwise. The existence of bizarre and uncouth

district boundaries is powerful evidence of an ulterior pur-pose behind the shaping of those boundaries--usually a purpose to advantage the political party in control of the dis-tricting process. Such evidence will always be useful in
cases that lack other evidence of invidious intent. In thiscase, however, we know what the legislators' purpose was:
The North Carolina Legislature drew District 12 to include amajority of African-American voters. See

ante, at 634-635.Evidence of the district's shape is therefore convincing, but

it is also cumulative, and, for our purposes, irrelevant.As for the second question, I believe that the Equal Protection Clause is violated when the State creates the kind ofuncouth district boundaries seen in

Karcher v. Daggett, 462U. S. 725 (1983), Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U. S. 339 (1960),

and this case, for the sole purpose of making it more difficultfor members of a minority group to win an election.

duty to govern impartially is abused when a group withpower over the electoral process defines electoral boundaries

solely to enhance its own political strength at the expense ofany weaker group. That duty, however, is not violated

and thereby to strengthen the unequal distribution of elec-toral power. When an assumption that people in a particular minority group (whether they are defined by the politicalparty, religion, ethnic group, or race to which they belong)
will vote in a particular way is used to benefit that group,no constitutional violation occurs. Politicians have always
relied on assumptions that people in particular groups arelikely to vote in a particular way when they draw new district lines, and I cannot believe that anything in today's opinion will stop them from doing so in the future.3

constitute the majority in a single-member district, "that it is politically
cohesive," and "that the white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it . . . usually to defeat the minority's preferred candidate." At least

Finally, we must ask whether otherwise permissible re-districting to benefit an underrepresented minority group

becomes impermissible when the minority group is definedby its race. The Court today answers this question in the
affirmative, and its answer is wrong. If it is permissibleto draw boundaries to provide adequate representation for
rural voters, for union members, for Hasidic Jews, for PolishAmericans, or for Republicans, it necessarily follows that it
is permissible to do the same thing for members of the veryminority group whose history in the United States gave
birth to the Equal Protection Clause. See, e. g., ante, at639-641.

configuration "so bizarre," ante, at 644, that it "rationally can-not be understood as anything other than an effort to separate voters into different districts on the basis of race [with-out] sufficient justification," ante, at 649, will be subjected to
strict scrutiny. In my view there is no justification for the
the latter two of these three conditions depend on proving that what the
Court today brands as "impermissible racial stereotypes," ante, at 647,
are true. Because Gingles involved North Carolina, which the Court admits has earlier established the existence of "pervasive racial bloc voting,"
ante, at 656, its citizens and legislators--as well as those from other
States--will no doubt be confused by the Court's requirement of evidence
in one type of case that the Constitution now prevents reliance on in
another. The Court offers them no explanation of this paradox.

4 The Court's opinion suggests that African-Americans may now be the

only group to which it is unconstitutional to offer specific benefits from
redistricting. Not very long ago, of course, it was argued that minority
groups defined by race were the only groups the Equal Protection Clause
protected in this context. See Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U. S., at 86-90, and
nn. 6-10 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment).

Court's determination to depart from our prior decisions bycarving out this narrow group of cases for strict scrutiny in

place of the review customarily applied in cases dealing withdiscrimination in electoral districting on the basis of race.

I
Until today, the Court has analyzed equal protectionclaims involving race in electoral districting differently from

equal protection claims involving other forms of governmen-tal conduct, and before turning to the different regimes of
analysis it will be useful to set out the relevant respects inwhich such districting differs from the characteristic circumstances in which a State might otherwise consciously con-sider race. Unlike other contexts in which we have addressed the State's conscious use of race, see, e. g., Richmondv. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469 (1989) (city contracting);
Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Ed., 476 U. S. 267 (1986) (teacherlayoffs), electoral districting calls for decisions that nearly
always require some consideration of race for legitimate rea-sons where there is a racially mixed population. As long as
members of racial groups have the commonality of interestimplicit in our ability to talk about concepts like "minority
voting strength," and "dilution of minority votes," cf. Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S. 30, 46-51 (1986), and as long asracial bloc voting takes place,

1 legislators will have to take

race into account in order to avoid dilution of minority votingstrength in the districting plans they adopt.

2 One need look

1 "Bloc racial voting is an unfortunate phenomenon, but we are repeatedly faced with the findings of knowledgeable district courts that it is a
fact of life. Where it exists, most often the result is that neither white
nor black can be elected from a district in which his race is in the minority." Beer v. United States, 425 U. S. 130, 144 (1976) (White, J.,
dissenting).

2 Recognition of actual commonality of interest and racially polarized

bloc voting cannot be equated with the " `invocation of race stereotypes' "
described by the Court, ante, at 648 (quoting Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co., 500 U. S. 614, 630-631 (1991)), and forbidden by our case law.

no further than the Voting Rights Act to understand thatthis may be required, and we have held that race may constitutionally be taken into account in order to comply with thatAct.

J., concurring in judgment).3A second distinction between districting and most other

governmental decisions in which race has figured is thatthose other decisions using racial criteria characteristically
occur in circumstances in which the use of race to the advan-tage of one person is necessarily at the obvious expense of a
member of a different race. Thus, for example, awardinggovernment contracts on a racial basis excludes certain firms
from competition on racial grounds. See Richmond v. J. A.
Croson Co., supra, at 493; see also Fullilove v. Klutznick,
448 U. S. 448, 484 (1980) (opinion of Burger, C. J.). And
when race is used to supplant seniority in layoffs, someone
is laid off who would not be otherwise. Wygant v. Jackson
Bd. of Ed., supra, at 282-283 (plurality opinion). The same
principle pertains in nondistricting aspects of voting law,
where race-based discrimination places the disfavored voters
at the disadvantage of exclusion from the franchise without
any alternative benefit. See, e. g., Gomillion v. Lightfoot,
364 U. S. 339, 341 (1960) (voters alleged to have been excluded from voting in the municipality).

In districting, by contrast, the mere placement of an individual in one district instead of another denies no one a right

3 Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act requires a covered jurisdiction to
demonstrate either to the Attorney General or to the District Court that
each new districting plan "does not have the purpose and will not have
the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race[,]
color, or [membership in a language minority.]" 42 U. S. C. $ 1973c; see
also $ 1973b(f)(2). Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act forbids districting
plans that will have a discriminatory effect on minority groups. $ 1973.

or benefit provided to others.4 All citizens may register,vote, and be represented. In whatever district, the individual voter has a right to vote in each election, and the electionwill result in the voter's representation. As we have held,
one's constitutional rights are not violated merely becausethe candidate one supports loses the election or because a
group (including a racial group) to which one belongs windsup with a representative from outside that group. See
Whitcomb v. Chavis, 403 U. S. 124, 153-155 (1971). It istrue, of course, that one's vote may be more or less effective
depending on the interests of the other individuals who arein one's district, and our cases recognize the reality that
members of the same race often have shared interests. "Di-lution" thus refers to the effects of districting decisions not
on an individual's political power viewed in isolation, but onthe political power of a group. See UJO, supra, at 165 (plurality opinion). This is the reason that the placement ofgiven voters in a given district, even on the basis of race,
does not, without more, diminish the effectiveness of the in-dividual as a voter.

II
Our different approaches to equal protection in electoraldistricting and nondistricting cases reflect these differences.

There is a characteristic coincidence of disadvantageous ef-fect and illegitimate purpose associated with the State's use
of race in those situations in which it has immediately trig4 The majority's use of "segregation" to describe the effect of districting
here may suggest that it carries effects comparable to school segregation
making it subject to like scrutiny. But a principal consequence of school
segregation was inequality in educational opportunity provided, whereas
use of race (or any other group characteristic) in districting does not,
without more, deny equality of political participation. Brown v. Board of
Education, 347 U. S. 483, 495 (1954). And while Bolling v. Sharpe, 347
U. S. 497, 500 (1954), held that requiring segregation in public education
served no legitimate public purpose, consideration of race may be constitutionally appropriate in electoral districting decisions in racially mixed political units. See supra, at 680-681.

gered at least heightened scrutiny (which every Member of
the Court to address the issue has agreed must be applied
even to race-based classifications designed to serve some
permissible state interest).5 Presumably because the legitimate consideration of race in a districting decision is usually
inevitable under the Voting Rights Act when communities
are racially mixed, however, and because, without more, it
does not result in diminished political effectiveness for anyone, we have not taken the approach of applying the usual
standard of such heightened "scrutiny" to race-based districting decisions. To be sure, as the Court says, it would
be logically possible to apply strict scrutiny to these cases
(and to uphold those uses of race that are permissible), see
ante, at 653-657. But just because there frequently will be
a constitutionally permissible use of race in electoral districting, as exemplified by the consideration of race to comply
with the Voting Rights Act (quite apart from the consideration of race to remedy a violation of the Act or the Consti5 See Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469, 493-495 (1989) (plurality opinion of O'Connor, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and White and
Kennedy, JJ.) (referring variously to "strict scrutiny," "the standard of
review employed in Wygant," and "heightened scrutiny"); id., at 520

objectives and must be substantially related to achievement of those objectives' " (quoting Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265, 359 (1978)

in part and dissenting in part)); 488 U. S., at 514-516 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (undertaking close examination

U. S. 267, 279-280 (1986) (plurality opinion of Powell, J.) (equating various
articulations of standards of review "more stringent" than " `reasonableness' " with "strict scrutiny"). Of course the Court has not held that the
disadvantaging effect of these uses of race can never be justified by a
sufficiently close relationship to a sufficiently strong state interest. See,
e. g., Croson, supra, at 509 (plurality opinion).

tution), it has seemed more appropriate for the Court toidentify impermissible uses by describing particular effects

sufficiently serious to justify recognition under the Four-teenth Amendment. Under our cases there is in general a
requirement that in order to obtain relief under the Four-teenth Amendment, the purpose and effect of the districting
must be to devalue the effectiveness of a voter compared towhat, as a group member, he would otherwise be able to
enjoy. See UJO, 430 U. S., at 165-166 (plurality opinion of
White, J., joined by Stevens and Rehnquist, JJ.); id., at179-180 (Stewart, J., joined by Powell, J., concurring in judgment). Justice White describes the formulations we haveused and the common categories of dilutive practice in his
dissenting opinion. See ante, at 661-663, 669-670.6A consequence of this categorical approach is the absence
of any need for further searching "scrutiny" once it has beenshown that a given districting decision has a purpose and
effect falling within one of those categories. If a cognizableharm like dilution or the abridgment of the right to participate in the electoral process is shown, the districting planviolates the Fourteenth Amendment. If not, it does not.
Under this approach, in the absence of an allegation of suchcognizable harm, there is no need for further scrutiny because a gerrymandering claim cannot be proven without theelement of harm. Nor if dilution is proven is there any need
for further constitutional scrutiny; there has never been asuggestion that such use of race could be justified under any
type of scrutiny, since the dilution of the right to vote cannot be said to serve any legitimate governmental purpose.

There is thus no theoretical inconsistency in having twodistinct approaches to equal protection analysis, one for

6 In this regard, I agree with Justice White's assessment of the difficulty the white plaintiffs would have here in showing that their opportunity to participate equally in North Carolina's electoral process has been
unconstitutionally diminished. See ante, at 666-667, and n. 6 (dissenting
opinion).

cases of electoral districting and one for most other types ofstate governmental decisions. Nor, because of the distinctions between the two categories, is there any risk that Four-teenth Amendment districting law as such will be taken to
imply anything for purposes of general Fourteenth Amend-ment scrutiny about "benign" racial discrimination, or about
group entitlement as distinct from individual protection, orabout the appropriateness of strict or other heightened
scrutiny.7 III

The Court appears to accept this, and it does not purportto disturb the law of vote dilution in any way. See

ante, at652 (acknowledging that "UJO set forth a standard under

which white voters can establish unconstitutional vote dilu-tion"). Instead, the Court creates a new "analytically distinct," ibid., cause of action, the principal element of whichis that a districting plan be "so bizarre on its face," ante, at
644, or "irrational on its face," ante, at 652, or "extremelyirregular on its face,"

ante, at 642, that it "rationally cannotbe understood as anything other than an effort to segregate

citizens into separate voting districts on the basis of racewithout sufficient justification," ante, at 652. Pleading such
an element, the Court holds, suffices without a further alle-gation of harm, to state a claim upon which relief can be
granted under the Fourteenth Amendment. See ante, at649.

It may be that the terms for pleading this cause of actionwill be met so rarely that this case will wind up an aberra7 The Court accuses me of treating the use of race in electoral redistricting as a "benign" form of discrimination. Ante, at 653. What I am saying is that in electoral districting there frequently are permissible uses of
race, such as its use to comply with the Voting Rights Act, as well as
impermissible ones. In determining whether a use of race is permissible
in cases in which there is a bizarrely shaped district, we can readily look
to its effects, just as we would in evaluating any other electoral districting scheme.

tion. The shape of the district at issue in this case is indeedso bizarre that few other examples are ever likely to carry

the unequivocal implication of impermissible use of race thatthe Court finds here. It may therefore be that few electoral
districting cases are ever likely to employ the strict scrutinythe Court holds to be applicable on remand if appellants' allegations are "not contradicted." Ante, at 653; see also ante,at 658.

8

Nonetheless, in those cases where this cause of action issufficiently pleaded, the State will have to justify its decision

to consider race as being required by a compelling state in-terest, and its use of race as narrowly tailored to that interest. Meanwhile, in other districting cases, specific conse-quential harm will still need to be pleaded and proven, in the
absence of which the use of race may be invalidated only ifit is shown to serve no legitimate state purpose. Cf. Bolling
v. Sharpe, 347 U. S. 497, 500 (1954).The Court offers no adequate justification for treating the
narrow category of bizarrely shaped district claims differ-ently from other districting claims.

9 The only justification I

8 While the Court "express[es] no view as to whether `the intentional
creation of majority-minority districts, without more,' always gives rise
to an equal protection claim," ante, at 649 (quoting ante, at 668 (White,
J., dissenting)), it repeatedly emphasizes that there is some reason to believe that a configuration devised with reference to traditional districting
principles would present a case falling outside the cause of action recognized today. See ante, at 642, 649, 652, 657-658.

9 The Court says its new cause of action is justified by what I understand

to be some ingredients of stigmatic harm, see ante, at 647-648, and by a
"threa[t] to . . . our system of representative democracy," ante, at 650,
both caused by the mere adoption of a districting plan with the elements
I have described in the text, supra, at 685. To begin with, the complaint
nowhere alleges any type of stigmatic harm. See App. to Juris. Statement 67a-100a (Complaint and Motion for Preliminary Injunction and For
Temporary Restraining Order). Putting that to one side, it seems utterly
implausible to me to presume, as the Court does, that North Carolina's
creation of this strangely shaped majority-minority district "generates"
within the white plaintiffs here anything comparable to "a feeling of inferi509us3116I 03-28-97 20:17:50 PAGES OPINPGT

can imagine would be the preservation of "sound districtingprinciples," UJO, 430 U. S., at 168, such as compactness and

contiguity. But as Justice White points out, see ante, at672 (dissenting opinion), and as the Court acknowledges, see
ante, at 647, we have held that such principles are not consti-tutionally required, with the consequence that their absence
cannot justify the distinct constitutional regime put in placeby the Court today. Since there is no justification for the
departure here from the principles that continue to governelectoral districting cases generally in accordance with our
prior decisions, I would not respond to the seeming egre-giousness of the redistricting now before us by untethering
the concept of racial gerrymander in such a case from theconcept of harm exemplified by dilution. In the absence of
an allegation of such harm, I would affirm the judgment ofthe District Court. I respectfully dissent.

UNITED STATES v. DIXON et al.
certiorari to the district of columbia court ofappeals

No. 91-1231. Argued December 2, 1992--Decided June 28, 1993
Based on respondent Dixon's arrest and indictment for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, he was convicted of criminal contempt
for violating a condition of his release on an unrelated offense forbidding
him to commit "any criminal offense." The trial court later dismissed
the cocaine indictment on double jeopardy grounds. Conversely, the
trial court in respondent Foster's case ruled that double jeopardy did
not require dismissal of a five-count indictment charging him with simple assault (Count I), threatening to injure another on three occasions
(Counts II-IV), and assault with intent to kill (Count V), even though
the events underlying the charges had previously prompted his trial for
criminal contempt for violating a civil protection order (CPO) requiring
him not to " `assault . . . or in any manner threaten . . .' " his estranged
wife. The District of Columbia Court of Appeals consolidated the two
cases on appeal and ruled that both subsequent prosecutions were
barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause under Grady v. Corbin, 495
U. S. 508.

Held: The judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the case

is remanded.

598 A. 2d 724, affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.

Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to
Parts I, II, and IV, concluding that:

1. The Double Jeopardy Clause's protection attaches in nonsummary
criminal contempt prosecutions just as it does in other criminal prosecutions. In the contexts of both multiple punishments and successive
prosecution, the double jeopardy bar applies if the two offenses for
which the defendant is punished or tried cannot survive the "sameelements" or "Blockburger" test. See, e. g., Blockburger v. United
States, 284 U. S. 299, 304. That test inquires whether each offense contains an element not contained in the other; if not, they are the "same
offence" within the Clause's meaning, and double jeopardy bars subsequent punishment or prosecution. The Court recently held in Grady
that in addition to passing the Blockburger test, a subsequent prosecution must satisfy a "same-conduct" test to avoid the double jeopardy
bar. That test provides that, "if, to establish an essential element of an
offense charged in that prosecution, the government will prove conduct

that constitutes an offense for which the defendant has already been
prosecuted," a second prosecution may not be had. 495 U. S., at 510.
Pp. 694-697.

2. Although prosecution under Counts II-V of Foster's indictment
would undoubtedly be barred by the Grady "same-conduct" test, Grady
must be overruled because it contradicted an unbroken line of decisions,
contained less than accurate historical analysis, and has produced confusion. Unlike Blockburger analysis, the Grady test lacks constitutional
roots. It is wholly inconsistent with this Court's precedents and with
the clear common-law understanding of double jeopardy. See Grady,
supra, at 526 (Scalia, J., dissenting). In re Nielsen, 131 U. S. 176, and
subsequent cases stand for propositions that are entirely in accord with
Blockburger and that do not establish even minimal antecedents for the
Grady rule. In contrast, two post-Nielsen cases, Gavieres v. United
States, 220 U. S. 338, 343, and Burton v. United States, 202 U. S. 344,
379-381, upheld subsequent prosecutions because the Blockburger test

(and only the Blockburger test) was satisfied. Moreover, the Grady
rule has already proved unstable in application, see United States v.
Felix, 503 U. S. 378. Although the Court does not lightly reconsider
precedent, it has never felt constrained to follow prior decisions that are
unworkable or badly reasoned. Pp. 703-712.

Justice Scalia, joined by Justice Kennedy, concluded in Part III
that:

1. Because Dixon's drug offense did not include any element not contained in his previous contempt offense, his subsequent prosecution fails
the Blockburger test. Dixon's contempt sanction was imposed for violating the order through commission of the incorporated drug offense.
His "crime" of violating a condition of his release cannot be abstracted
from the "element" of the violated condition. Harris v. Oklahoma, 433
U. S. 682 (per curiam). Here, as in Harris, the underlying substantive
criminal offense is a "species of lesser-included offense," Illinois v.
Vitale, 447 U. S. 410, 420, whose subsequent prosecution is barred by
the Double Jeopardy Clause. The same analysis applies to Count I of
Foster's indictment, and that prosecution is barred. Pp. 697-700.

2. However, the remaining four counts of Foster's indictment are not
barred under Blockburger. Foster's first prosecution for violating the
CPO provision forbidding him to assault his wife does not bar his later
prosecution under Count V, which charges assault with intent to kill.
That offense requires proof of specific intent to kill, which the contempt
offense did not. Similarly, the contempt crime required proof of knowledge of the CPO, which the later charge does not. The two crimes
were different offenses under the Blockburger test. Counts II, III, and
IV are likewise not barred. Pp. 700-703.

Syllabus
Justice White, joined by Justice Stevens, concluded that, because
the Double Jeopardy Clause bars prosecution for an offense if the defendant already has been held in contempt for its commission, both Dixon's prosecution for possession with intent to distribute cocaine and Foster's prosecution for simple assault were prohibited. Pp. 720, 731-733.

Justice Souter, joined by Justice Stevens, concluded that the
prosecutions below were barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause under
this Court's successive prosecution decisions (from In re Nielsen, 131
U. S. 176, to Grady v. Corbin, 495 U. S. 508), which hold that even if the
Blockburger test is satisfied, a second prosecution is not permitted for
conduct comprising the criminal act charged in the first. Because Dixon's contempt prosecution proved beyond a reasonable doubt that he
had possessed cocaine with intent to distribute it, his prosecution for
possession with intent to distribute cocaine based on the same incident
is barred. Similarly, since Foster has already been convicted in his
contempt prosecution for the act of simple assault charged in Count I of
his indictment, his subsequent prosecution for simple assault is barred.
Pp. 761-763.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Scalia announced the judgment of the Court anddelivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I,

II, and IV, and an opinion with respect to Parts III and V,in which

Justice Kennedy joins.

In both of these cases, respondents were tried for criminalcontempt of court for violating court orders that prohibited

them from engaging in conduct that was later the subject ofa criminal prosecution. We consider whether the subsequent criminal prosecutions are barred by the Double Jeop-ardy Clause.

I
Respondent Alvin Dixon was arrested for second-degreemurder and was released on bond. Consistent with the District of Columbia's bail law authorizing the judicial officer toimpose any condition that "will reasonably assure the appearance of the person for trial or the safety of any otherperson or the community," D. C. Code Ann. $ 23-1321(a)
(1989), Dixon's release form specified that he was not to com-mit "any criminal offense," and warned that any violation of
the conditions of release would subject him "to revocation ofrelease, an order of detention, and prosecution for contempt
of court." See D. C. Code Ann. $ 23-1329(a) (1989) (authoriz-ing those sanctions).

While awaiting trial, Dixon was arrested and indicted forpossession of cocaine with intent to distribute, in violation of
D. C. Code Ann. $ 33-541(a)(1) (1988). The court issued anorder requiring Dixon to show cause why he should not be
held in contempt or have the terms of his pretrial releasemodified. At the show-cause hearing, four police officers
testified to facts surrounding the alleged drug offense; Dix-on's counsel cross-examined these witnesses and introduced
other evidence. The court concluded that the Governmenthad established " `beyond a reasonable doubt that [Dixon]
was in possession of drugs and that those drugs were pos-sessed with the intent to distribute.' " 598 A. 2d 724, 728
(D. C. 1991). The court therefore found Dixon guilty of

Opinion of the Court
criminal contempt under $ 23-1329(c), which allows contemptsanctions after expedited proceedings without a jury and "in

accordance with principles applicable to proceedings forcriminal contempt." For his contempt, Dixon was sentenced to 180 days in jail. $ 23-1329(c) (maximum penalty
of six months' imprisonment and $1,000 fine). He latermoved to dismiss the cocaine indictment on double jeopardy

grounds; the trial court granted the motion.Respondent Michael Foster's route to this Court is similar.
Based on Foster's alleged physical attacks upon her in thepast, Foster's estranged wife Ana obtained a civil protection
order (CPO) in Superior Court of the District of Columbia.
See D. C. Code Ann. $ 16-1005(c) (1989) (CPO may be issued
upon a showing of good cause to believe that the subject
"has committed or is threatening an intrafamily offense").
The order, to which Foster consented, required that he not
" `molest, assault, or in any manner threaten or physically
abuse' " Ana Foster; a separate order, not implicated here,
sought to protect her mother. 598 A. 2d, at 725-726.

Over the course of eight months, Ana Foster filed three
separate motions to have her husband held in contempt for
numerous violations of the CPO. Of the 16 alleged episodes,
the only charges relevant here are three separate instances
of threats (on November 12, 1987, and March 26 and May 17,
1988) and two assaults (on November 6, 1987, and May 21,
1988), in the most serious of which Foster "threw [his wife]
down basement stairs, kicking her body[,] . . . pushed her
head into the floor causing head injuries, [and Ana Foster]
lost consciousness." 598 A. 2d, at 726.

After issuing a notice of hearing and ordering Foster to
appear, the court held a 3-day bench trial. Counsel for Ana
Foster and her mother prosecuted the action; the United
States was not represented at trial, although the United
States Attorney was apparently aware of the action, as was
the court aware of a separate grand jury proceeding on some
of the alleged criminal conduct. As to the assault charges,

Opinion of the Court
the court stated that Ana Foster would have "to prove as anelement, first that there was a Civil Protection Order, and

then [that] . . . the assault as defined by the criminal code, infact occurred." Tr. in Nos. IF-630-87, IF-631-87 (Aug. 8,
1988), p. 367; accord, id., at 368. At the close of the plaintiffs' case, the court granted Foster's motion for acquittal onvarious counts, including the alleged threats on November

12 and May 17. Foster then took the stand and generallydenied the allegations. The court found Foster guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of four counts of criminal contempt(three violations of Ana Foster's CPO, and one violation of
the CPO obtained by her mother), including the November
6, 1987, and May 21, 1988, assaults, but acquitted him on
other counts, including the March 26 alleged threats. He
was sentenced to an aggregate 600 days' imprisonment. See

$ 16-1005(f) (authorizing contempt punishment); Super. Ct.
of D. C. Intrafamily Rules 7(c), 12(e) (1987) (maximum punishment of six months' imprisonment and $300 fine).

The United States Attorney's Office later obtained an indictment charging Foster with simple assault on or about
November 6, 1987 (Count I, violation of $ 22-504); threatening to injure another on or about November 12, 1987, and
March 26 and May 17, 1988 (Counts II-IV, violation of $ 22-
2307); and assault with intent to kill on or about May 21,
1988 (Count V, violation of $ 22-501). App. 43-44. Ana
Foster was the complainant in all counts; the first and last
counts were based on the events for which Foster had been
held in contempt, and the other three were based on the alleged events for which Foster was acquitted of contempt.
Like Dixon, Foster filed a motion to dismiss, claiming a double jeopardy bar to all counts, and also collateral estoppel as
to Counts II-IV. The trial court denied the double jeopardy
claim and did not rule on the collateral-estoppel assertion.

The Government appealed the double jeopardy ruling in
Dixon, and Foster appealed the trial court's denial of his
motion. The District of Columbia Court of Appeals consoli509us3117M 03-28-97 20:18:34 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
dated the two cases, reheard them en banc, and, relying on
our recent decision in Grady v. Corbin, 495 U. S. 508 (1990),
ruled that both subsequent prosecutions were barred by the
Double Jeopardy Clause. 598 A. 2d, at 725. In its petition
for certiorari, the Government presented the sole question
"[w]hether the Double Jeopardy Clause bars prosecution of
a defendant on substantive criminal charges based upon the
same conduct for which he previously has been held in criminal contempt of court." Pet. for Cert. I. We granted certiorari, 503 U. S. 1004 (1992).

II
To place these cases in context, one must understand that
they are the consequence of a historically anomalous use of
the contempt power. In both Dixon and Foster, a court issued an order directing a particular individual not to commit
criminal offenses. (In Dixon's case, the court incorporated
the entire criminal code; in Foster's case, the criminal offense
of simple assault.) That could not have occurred at common
law, or in the 19th-century American judicial system.

At common law, the criminal contempt power was confined
to sanctions for conduct that interfered with the orderly
administration of judicial proceedings. 4 W. Blackstone,
Commentaries *280-*285. That limitation was closely followed in American courts. See United States v. Hudson, 7
Cranch 32, 34 (1812); R. Goldfarb, The Contempt Power
12-20 (1963). Federal courts had power to "inforce the observance of order," but those "implied powers" could not
support common-law jurisdiction over criminal acts. Hudson, supra, at 34. In 1831, Congress amended the Judiciary
Act of 1789, allowing federal courts the summary contempt
power to punish generally "disobedience or resistance" to
court orders. $ 1, Act of March 2, 1831, 4 Stat. 487-488.
See Bloom v. Illinois, 391 U. S. 194, 202-204 (1968) (discussing evolution of federal courts' statutory contempt power).

695Cite as: 509 U. S. 688 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
The 1831 amendment of the Judiciary Act still would nothave given rise to orders of the sort at issue here, however,

since there was a long common-law tradition against judicialorders prohibiting violation of the law. Injunctions, for example, would not issue to forbid infringement of criminal or
civil laws, in the absence of some separate injury to privateinterest. See,

e. g., 3 Blackstone, supra, at *426, n. 1; J.
High, Law of Injunctions $ 23, pp. 15-17, and notes (1873)(citing English cases); C. Beach, Law of Injunctions $$ 58-59,

pp. 71-73 (1895) (same). The interest protected by the crim-inal or civil prohibition was to be vindicated at law--and
though equity might enjoin harmful acts that happened to
violate civil or criminal law, it would not enjoin violation of
civil or criminal law as such. See, e. g., Sparhawk v. Union
Passenger R. Co., 54 Pa. St. 401, 422-424 (1867) (refusing to
enjoin railroad's violation of Sunday closing law); Attorney
General v. Utica Insurance Co., 2 Johns. Ch. 371, 378 (N. Y.
1817) (refusing to enjoin violation of banking statute).

It is not surprising, therefore, that the double jeopardy
issue presented here--whether prosecution for criminal contempt based on violation of a criminal law incorporated into
a court order bars a subsequent prosecution for the criminal
offense--did not arise at common law, or even until quite
recently in American cases. See generally Zitter, Contempt
Finding as Precluding Substantive Criminal Charges Relating to Same Transaction, 26 A. L. R. 4th 950, 953-956 (1983).
English and earlier American cases do report instances in
which prosecution for criminal contempt of court--as originally understood--did not bar a subsequent prosecution for
a criminal offense based on the same conduct. See, e. g.,
King v. Lord Ossulston, 2 Str. 1107, 93 Eng. Rep. 1063 (K. B.
1739); State v. Yancy, 4 N. C. 133 (1814). But those contempt prosecutions were for disruption of judicial process, in
which the disruptive conduct happened also to be criminal.

The Double Jeopardy Clause, whose application to this
new context we are called upon to consider, provides that no

509us3117M 03-28-97 20:18:34 PAGES OPINPGT
696 UNITED STATES v. DIXON

Opinion of the Court
person shall "be subject for the same offence to be twice putin jeopardy of life or limb." U. S. Const., Amdt. 5. This

protection applies both to successive punishments and to suc-cessive prosecutions for the same criminal offense. See
North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U. S. 711 (1969). It is well
established that criminal contempt, at least the sort enforcedthrough nonsummary proceedings, is "a crime in the ordinary sense." Bloom, supra, at 201. Accord, New Orleansv.

Steamship Co., 20 Wall. 387, 392 (1874).
We have held that constitutional protections for criminaldefendants other than the double jeopardy provision apply

in nonsummary criminal contempt prosecutions just as they
do in other criminal prosecutions. See, e. g., Gompers v.
Bucks Stove & Range Co., 221 U. S. 418, 444 (1911) (presumption of innocence, proof beyond a reasonable doubt, and guarantee against self-incrimination); Cooke v. United States, 267
U. S. 517, 537 (1925) (notice of charges, assistance of counsel,
and right to present a defense); In re Oliver, 333 U. S. 257,
278 (1948) (public trial). We think it obvious, and today
hold, that the protection of the Double Jeopardy Clause likewise attaches. Accord, Menna v. New York, 423 U. S. 61
(1975) (per curiam); Colombo v. New York, 405 U. S. 9 (1972)
(per curiam).

In both the multiple punishment and multiple prosecution
contexts, this Court has concluded that where the two offenses for which the defendant is punished or tried cannot
survive the "same-elements" test, the double jeopardy bar
applies. See, e. g., Brown v. Ohio, 432 U. S. 161, 168-169
(1977); Blockburger v. United States, 284 U. S. 299, 304
(1932) (multiple punishment); Gavieres v. United States, 220
U. S. 338, 342 (1911) (successive prosecutions). The sameelements test, sometimes referred to as the "Blockburger"
test, inquires whether each offense contains an element not
contained in the other; if not, they are the "same offence" and
double jeopardy bars additional punishment and successive
prosecution. In a case such as Yancy, for example, in which

509us3117M 03-28-97 20:18:34 PAGES OPINPGT

697Cite as: 509 U. S. 688 (1993)
Opinion of Scalia, J.
the contempt prosecution was for disruption of judicial busi-ness, the same-elements test would not bar subsequent

prosecution for the criminal assault that was part of the dis-ruption, because the contempt offense did not require the
element of criminal conduct, and the criminal offense did notrequire the element of disrupting judicial business.

1

We recently held in Grady that in addition to passing the
Blockburger test, a subsequent prosecution must satisfy a"same-conduct" test to avoid the double jeopardy bar. The

Grady test provides that, "if, to establish an essential ele-ment of an offense charged in that prosecution, the government will prove conduct that constitutes an offense for whichthe defendant has already been prosecuted," a second prosecution may not be had. 495 U. S., at 510.

III

A
The first question before us today is whether Blockburgeranalysis permits subsequent prosecution in this new criminal

contempt context, where judicial order has prohibited crimi-nal act. If it does, we must then proceed to consider
whether Grady also permits it. See Grady, supra, at 516.We begin with Dixon. The statute applicable in Dixon's
contempt prosecution provides that "[a] person who has beenconditionally released . . . and who has violated a condition
of release shall be subject to . . . prosecution for contempt ofcourt." $ 23-1329(a). Obviously, Dixon could not commit
an "offence" under this provision until an order setting outconditions was issued. The statute by itself imposes no
legal obligation on anyone. Dixon's cocaine possession, al-though an offense under D. C. Code Ann. $ 33-541(a) (1988
and Supp. 1992), was not an offense under $ 23-1329 until a

1 State v. Yancy, 4 N. C. 133 (1814), it should be noted, involved what
is today called summary contempt. We have not held, and do not mean
by this example to decide, that the double jeopardy guarantee applies to
such proceedings.

Opinion of Scalia, J.
judge incorporated the statutory drug offense into his re-lease order.

In this situation, in which the contempt sanction is im-posed for violating the order through commission of the incorporated drug offense, the later attempt to prosecuteDixon for the drug offense resembles the situation that
produced our judgment of double jeopardy in Harris v.
Oklahoma, 433 U. S. 682 (1977) (per curiam). There weheld that a subsequent prosecution for robbery with a

firearm was barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause, becausethe defendant had already been tried for felony murder
based on the same underlying felony. We have describedour terse

per curiam in Harris as standing for the proposi-tion that, for double jeopardy purposes, "the crime generally

described as felony murder" is not "a separate offensedistinct from its various elements." Illinois v. Vitale, 447
U. S. 410, 420-421 (1980). Accord, Whalen v. United States,445 U. S. 684, 694 (1980). So too here, the "crime" of violating a condition of release cannot be abstracted from the "ele-ment" of the violated condition. The

Dixon court order in-corporated the entire governing criminal code in the same

manner as the Harris felony-murder statute incorporatedthe several enumerated felonies. Here, as in Harris, the

underlying substantive criminal offense is "a species oflesser-included offense."

2 Vitale, supra, at 420. Accord,

Whalen, supra.

2 In order for the same analysis to be applicable to violation of a statute
criminalizing disobedience of a lawful police order, as The Chief Justice's dissent on this point hypothesizes, see post, at 719, the statute must
embrace police "orders" that "command" the noncommission of crimes--
for instance, "Don't shoot that man!" It seems to us unlikely that a "police order" statute would be interpreted in this fashion, rather than as
addressing new obligations imposed by lawful order of police (for example,
the obligation to remain behind police lines, or to heed a command to
"Freeze!"). If, however, such a statute were interpreted to cover police
orders forbidding crimes, the Double Jeopardy Clause would as a practical
matter bar subsequent prosecution only for relatively minor offenses, such

699Cite as: 509 U. S. 688 (1993)
Opinion of Scalia, J.
To oppose this analysis, the Government can point only todictum in In re Debs, 158 U. S. 564, 594, 599-600 (1895),

which, to the extent it attempted to exclude certain nonsum-mary contempt prosecutions from various constitutional protections for criminal defendants, has been squarely rejectedby cases such as

Bloom, 391 U. S., at 208. The Governmentalso relies upon In re Chapman, 166 U. S. 661 (1897), and

Jurney v. MacCracken, 294 U. S. 125 (1935), which recognizeCongress' power to punish as contempt the refusal of a witness to testify before it. But to say that Congress can pun-ish such a refusal is not to say that a criminal court can
punish the same refusal yet again. Neither case dealt withthat issue, and

Chapman specifically declined to address it,noting that successive prosecutions (before Congress for contemptuous refusal to testify and before a court for violationof a federal statute making such refusal a crime) were "improbable." 166 U. S., at 672.Both the Government, Brief for United States 15-17, and
Justice Blackmun, post, at 743, contend that the legal obli-gation in Dixon's case may serve "interests . . . fundamentally different" from the substantive criminal law, because itderives in part from the determination of a court rather than
a determination of the legislature. That distinction seemsquestionable, since the court's power to establish conditions
of release, and to punish their violation, was conferred bystatute; the legislature was the ultimate source of both the
criminal and the contempt prohibition. More importantly,however, the distinction is of no moment for purposes of the
Double Jeopardy Clause, the text of which looks to whetherthe offenses are the same, not the interests that the offenses
violate. And this Court stated long ago that criminal conas assault (the only conceivable lesser included offense of an order not to
"shoot")--unless one assumes that constables often order the noncommission of serious crimes (for example, "Don't murder that man!") and that
serious felons such as murderers are first prosecuted for disobeying police orders.

tempt, at least in its nonsummary form, "is a crime in everyfundamental respect." Bloom, supra, at 201; accord, e. g.,

Steamship Co., 20 Wall., at 392. Because Dixon's drug of-fense did not include any element not contained in his previous contempt offense, his subsequent prosecution violatesthe Double Jeopardy Clause.

The foregoing analysis obviously applies as well to CountI of the indictment against Foster, charging assault in violation of $ 22-504, based on the same event that was the sub-ject of his prior contempt conviction for violating the provision of the CPO forbidding him to commit simple assaultunder $ 22-504.

The remaining four counts in Foster, assault with intent tokill (Count V; $ 22-501) and threats to injure or kidnap

(Counts II-IV; $ 22-2307), are not barred under Blockburger.As to Count V: Foster's conduct on May 21, 1988, was found
to violate the Family Division's order that he not "molest,assault, or in any manner threaten or physically abuse" his
wife. At the contempt hearing, the court stated that Ana

3 It is not obvious that the word "assault" in the CPO bore the precise
meaning "assault under $ 22-504." The court imposing the contempt construed it that way, however, and the point has not been contested in this
litigation.

4 Justice White complains that this section of our opinion gives the

arguments of the United States "short shrift," post, at 720, and treats
them in "conclusory" fashion, post, at 721. He then proceeds to reject
these arguments, largely by agreeing with our analysis, post, at 721, 722,
724, 726. We think it unnecessary, and indeed undesirable, to address at
any greater length than we have arguments based on dictum and inapplicable doctrines such as dual sovereignty. The remainder of that part of
Justice White's opinion that deals with this issue argues--by no means
in conclusory fashion--that its practical consequences for law enforcement
are not serious. Post, at 727-731. He may be right. But we do not
share his "pragmatic" view, post, at 739, that the meaning of the Double
Jeopardy Clause depends upon our approval of its consequences.

Opinion of Scalia, J.
Foster's attorney, who prosecuted the contempt, would have
to prove, first, knowledge of a CPO, and, second, a willful
violation of one of its conditions, here simple assault as defined by the criminal code.5 See, e. g., 598 A. 2d, at 727-728;
In re Thompson, 454 A. 2d 1324, 1326 (D. C. 1982); accord,
Parker v. United States, 373 A. 2d 906, 907 (D. C. 1977) (per
curiam). On the basis of the same episode, Foster was then
indicted for violation of $ 22-501, which proscribes assault
with intent to kill. Under governing law, that offense requires proof of specific intent to kill; simple assault does not.6

See Logan v. United States, 483 A. 2d 664, 672-673 (D. C.
1984). Similarly, the contempt offense required proof of
knowledge of the CPO, which assault with intent to kill does
not. Applying the Blockburger elements test, the result
is clear: These crimes were different offenses, and the sub5 Given this requirement of willful violation of the order, Justice
White's desire to "put to the side the CPO," because it only "triggered
the court's authority" cannot be reconciled with his desire to "compar[e]
the substantive offenses of which respondents stood accused." Post, at
734. The "substantive offense" of criminal contempt is willful violation
of a court order. Far from a mere jurisdictional device, that order (or
CPO) is the centerpiece of the entire proceeding. Its terms define the
prohibited conduct, its existence supports imposition of a criminal penalty,
and willful violation of it is necessary for conviction. To ignore the CPO
when determining whether two offenses are the "same" is no more possible than putting aside the statutory definitions of criminal offenses. Of
course, Justice White's view that the elements of criminal contempt are
essentially irrelevant for double jeopardy analysis does have precedent--
albeit erroneous--in Grady's same-conduct test. Grady v. Corbin, 495
U. S. 508 (1990). Justice Souter also ignores the knowledge element.
Post, at 761, n. 10.

6 We accept, as we ordinarily do, the construction of a District of Columbia law adopted by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. See, e. g.,
Pernell v. Southall Realty, 416 U. S. 363, 368-369 (1974). The construction here has sound support in the text of the statute. Compare D. C.
Code Ann. $ 22-501 (1989) (assault with intent to kill, rob, rape, or poison)
with $ 22-504 (assault).

sequent prosecution did not violate the Double JeopardyClause.

7

Counts II, III, and IV of Foster's indictment are likewisenot barred. These charged Foster under $ 22-2307 (forbidding anyone to "threate[n] . . . to kidnap any person or toinjure the person of another or physically damage the property of any person") for his alleged threats on three separatedates. Foster's contempt prosecution included charges that,
on the same dates, he violated the CPO provision orderingthat he not "in any manner threaten" Ana Foster. Conviction of the contempt required willful violation of the CPO--which conviction under $ 22-2307 did not; and conviction
under $ 22-2307 required that the threat be a threat to kid-nap, to inflict bodily injury, or to damage property--which
conviction of the contempt (for violating the CPO provisionthat Foster not "in any manner threaten") did not.

8 Each

7 Justice White's suggestion, post, at 737-738, that if Foster received
a lesser-included-offense instruction on assault at his trial for assault with
intent to kill, we would uphold a conviction on that lesser count is simply
wrong. Under basic Blockburger analysis, Foster may neither be tried a
second time for assault nor again convicted for assault, as we have concluded as to Count I (charging simple assault). Thus, Foster certainly
does receive the "full constitutional protection to which he is entitled,"
post, at 738, n. 10: he may neither be tried nor convicted a second time for
assault. That does not affect the conclusion that trial and conviction for
assault with intent to kill are not barred. It merely illustrates the unremarkable fact that one offense (simple assault) may be an included offense
of two offenses (violation of the CPO for assault, and assault with intent
to kill) that are separate offenses under Blockburger.

8 We think it is highly artificial to interpret the CPO's prohibition of

threatening "in any manner," as Justice White would interpret it, to
refer only to threats that violate the District's criminal laws. Post, at
732-733, n. 7. The only threats meeting that definition would have been
threats to do physical harm, to kidnap, or to damage property. See D. C.
Code Ann. $$ 22-507, 22-2307 (1989). Threats to stalk, to frighten, to
cause intentional embarrassment, to make harassing phone calls, to make
false reports to employers or prospective employers, to harass by phone
calls or otherwise at work--to mention only a few of the additional threats
that might be anticipated in this domestic situation--would not be cov509us3117M 03-28-97 20:18:34 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
offense therefore contained a separate element, and theBlockburger test for double jeopardy was not met.

IV
Having found that at least some of the counts at issue hereare not barred by the Blockburger test, we must consider

whether they are barred by the new, additional double jeop-ardy test we announced three Terms ago in Grady v. Corbin.9 They undoubtedly are, since Grady prohibits "a sub-sequent prosecution if, to establish an essential element of
an offense charged in that prosecution [here, assault as anelement of assault with intent to kill, or threatening as an
element of threatening bodily injury], the government will
ered. Surely "in any manner threaten" should cover at least all threats
to commit acts that would be tortious under District of Columbia law
(which would be consistent with the trial court's later reference to a "legal
threat"). Thus, under our Blockburger analysis the aggravated threat
counts and the assault-with-intent-to-kill count come out the same way.

9 Justice White attempts to avoid this issue altogether because, in his

view, it would be "injudicious" to consider the differences in Foster, not
pressed by the Government, between the CPO restrictions and the alleged
statutory offenses. Post, at 740. Of course, these differences are pure
facts, apparent on the face of the CPO and the indictment. They do not
alter the question presented, which assumes only that the prosecuted conduct was the same, see supra, at 694, not that the terms of the CPO and
the statute were. Further, although the Government did not argue that
the different counts in Foster should come out differently, it did argue (as
we do) that they all should be evaluated under Blockburger and not
Grady, see, e. g., Brief for United States 14-15, 42; and we are not aware
of any principle that prevents us from accepting a litigant's legal theory
unless we agree with the litigant on all the applications of the theory.
The standard to be applied in determining the double jeopardy effect of
criminal charges based on the same conduct (Blockburger vs. Grady) assuredly is included within the question presented. That makes Justice
White's citation of cases declining to consider legal issues not raised
below wholly beside the point. Nor can we see any abuse of what Justice White himself regards as a prudential limitation, when the evident
factual difference between the charges and the CPO order is central to
proper constitutional analysis.

Opinion of the Court
prove conduct that constitutes an offense for which the de-fendant has already been prosecuted [here, the assault and

the threatening, which conduct constituted the offense of vio-lating the CPO]." 495 U. S., at 510.

We have concluded, however, that Grady must be overruled. Unlike Blockburger analysis, whose definition ofwhat prevents two crimes from being the "same offence,"

U. S. Const., Amdt. 5, has deep historical roots and has beenaccepted in numerous precedents of this Court,

Grady lacks
constitutional roots. The "same-conduct" rule it announcedis wholly inconsistent with earlier Supreme Court precedent

and with the clear common-law understanding of double
jeopardy. See, e. g., Gavieres v. United States, 220 U. S., at
345 (in subsequent prosecution, "[w]hile it is true that the
conduct of the accused was one and the same, two offenses
resulted, each of which had an element not embraced in the
other"). We need not discuss the many proofs of these
statements, which were set forth at length in the Grady dissent. See 495 U. S., at 526 (opinion of Scalia, J.). We will
respond, however, to the contrary contentions of today's proGrady dissents.

The centerpiece of Justice Souter's analysis is an appealing theory of a "successive prosecution" strand of the
Double Jeopardy Clause that has a different meaning from
its supposed "successive punishment" strand. We have
often noted that the Clause serves the function of preventing
both successive punishment and successive prosecution, see,
e. g., North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U. S. 711 (1969), but there
is no authority, except Grady, for the proposition that it has
different meanings in the two contexts. That is perhaps because it is embarrassing to assert that the single term "same
offence" (the words of the Fifth Amendment at issue here)
has two different meanings--that what is the same offense
is yet not the same offense. Justice Souter provides no

assertion that "we have long held that [the government]

must sometimes bring its prosecutions for [separate] offensestogether." Post, at 747. The collateral-estoppel effect attributed to the Double Jeopardy Clause, see Ashe v. Swen-son, 397 U. S. 436 (1970), may bar a later prosecution for a
separate offense where the Government has lost an earlierprosecution involving the same facts. But this does not establish that the Government "must . . . bring its prosecutions. . . together." It is entirely free to bring them separately,
and can win convictions in both. Of course the collateral-estoppel issue is not raised in this case.

Justice Souter relies upon four cases to establish theexistence of some minimal antecedents to

Grady. Post, at749-758. The fountainhead of the "same-conduct" rule, he

asserts, is In re Nielsen, 131 U. S. 176 (1889). That is de-monstrably wrong.

Nielsen simply applies the commonproposition, entirely in accord with Blockburger, that prosecution for a greater offense (cohabitation, defined to requireproof of adultery) bars prosecution for a lesser included offense (adultery). That is clear from the Nielsen Court'sframing of the question ("Being of opinion, therefore, that
habeas corpus was a proper remedy for the petitioner, if the
crime of adultery with which he was charged was includedin the crime of unlawful cohabitation for which he was convicted and punished, that question is now to be considered,"131 U. S., at 185 (emphasis added)), from its legal analysis,
id., at 186-189, and from its repeated observations that co-habitation required proof of adultery,

id., at 187, 189.10

10 Justice Souter has apparently been led astray by his misinterpretation of the word "incidents" in the following passage of Nielsen: "[W]here,
as in this case, a person has been tried and convicted for a crime which
has various incidents included in it, he cannot be a second time tried for
one of those incidents without being twice put in jeopardy for the same
offence." 131 U. S., at 188. He apparently takes "incident" to mean
"event" or "conduct." See post, at 752, and n. 5, 757-758. What it obviously means, however, is "element." See Black's Law Dictionary 762 (6th
ed. 1990) (defining "incidents of ownership"); J. Bouvier, Law Dictionary
783-784 (1883) (defining "incident" and giving examples of "incident to a

Opinion of the Court
His second case comes almost a century later. Brown v.Ohio, 432 U. S. 161 (1977), contains no support for his position except a footnote that cites Nielsen for the propositionthat "[t]he Blockburger test is not the only standard for determining whether successive prosecutions impermissibly in-volve the same offense."

Brown, supra, at 166-167, n. 6.Not only is this footnote the purest dictum, but it flatly contradicts the text of the opinion which, on the very next page,describes Nielsen as the first Supreme Court case to endorse
the Blockburger rule. Brown, supra, at 168. Quoting thatsuspect dictum multiple times, see post, at 748, 754, cannot
convert it into case law. See United States Nat. Bank of
Ore. v. Independent Ins. Agents of America, Inc., 508 U. S.439, 463, n. 11 (1993) (emphasizing "the need to distinguish

an opinion's holding from its dicta"). The holding of Brown,like that of Nielsen, rests squarely upon the existence of
a lesser included offense. 432 U. S., at 162 (setting outquestion presented).

The third case is Harris, which Justice Souter assertswas a reaffirmation of what he contends was the earlier holding in Nielsen, that the Blockburger test is "insufficien[t] fordetermining when a successive prosecution [is] barred," and
that conduct, and not merely elements of the offense, mustbe the object of inquiry.

Post, at 755. Surely not. Harrisnever uses the word "conduct," and its entire discussion

focuses on the elements of the two offenses. See, e. g., 433U. S., at 682-683, n. (to prove felony murder, "it was necessary for all the ingredients of the underlying felony" to beproved). Far from validating

Justice Souter's extraordi-narily implausible reading of Nielsen, Harris plainly rejects

that reading, treating the earlier case as having focused (likeBlockburger) upon the elements of the offense. Immedireversion," and "incidents" to a contract). That is perfectly clear from
the very next sentence of Nielsen (which Justice Souter does not quote):
"It may be contended that adultery is not an incident of unlawful
cohabitation . . . ." 131 U. S., at 189.

ately after stating that conviction for felony murder, a"greater crime," "cannot be had without conviction of the

lesser crime," the Harris Court quotes Nielsen's statementthat " `a person [who] has been tried and convicted for a
crime which has various incidents included in it, . . . cannotbe a second time tried for one of those incidents.' " 433
U. S., at 682-683, quoting from 131 U. S., at 188. It is clearfrom that context that

Harris regarded "incidents included"to mean "offenses included"--a reference to defined crimes

rather than to conduct.Finally,

Justice Souter misdescribes Vitale. Despitehis bold assertion to the contrary, see

post, at 757, Vitaleunquestionably reads
Harris as merely an application of thedouble jeopardy bar to lesser and greater included offenses.

11

Justice Souter instead elevates the statement in Vitalethat, on certain hypothetical facts, the petitioner would have

a "substantial" "claim" of double jeopardy on a Grady-typetheory, see post, at 756-757, into a holding that the petitioner
would win on that theory. Post, at 757, 763. No Justice,the Vitale dissenters included, has ever construed this passage as answering, rather than simply raising, the questionon which we later granted certiorari in Grady. See 447
U. S., at 426 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (in addition to findingthe same-conduct claim "substantial," dissent would find it
"dispositive"). See also Grady, 495 U. S., at 510 (Vitale"suggested" same-conduct test adopted in

Grady).In contrast to the above-discussed dicta relied upon by

Justice Souter, there are two pre-Grady (and post-Nielsen) cases that are directly on point. In both Gavieres

quent prosecutions after concluding that the Blockburgertest (and only the Blockburger test) was satisfied.

12 These

cases are incompatible with the belief that Nielsen hadcreated an additional requirement beyond the "elements"

standard.13 Totally ignored by Justice Souter are the

12 Justice Souter contends that Burton is not in point because the case
arose on a demurrer to the indictment, so that the Court "was not presented with the factual basis for the charges." Post, at 758. It would be
a rare and unsatisfactory indictment that did not set forth the factual basis
for the charges. The Court in Burton discusses the facts at length. 202
U. S., at 379-381. It is obvious, and it was assumed by the Court, that
the same conduct was at issue in both indictments. Having decided, pursuant to Blockburger, that the nature of the statutes did not support a
claim of double jeopardy, the Court (if it agreed with Justice Souter's
view of the law) should have proceeded to consider whether the nature of
the acts alleged supported such a claim.

13 Both Justice White, post, at 735, and Justice Souter, post, at 758-

759, recognize that Gavieres did hold that Blockburger is the only test for
"same offence." Justice Souter handles this difficulty by simply ignoring the concession. See ibid. Justice White first minimizes the concession, arguing that application of our version of Blockburger to successive prosecutions has happened (by reason of Gavieres) "only once."
Post, at 735. Once, it seems to us, is enough to make a precedent. Justice White then seeks to neutralize the precedent by offering still another case, Grafton v. United States, 206 U. S. 333 (1907), that cannot support the reading grafted onto it today. Post, at 739-740. The defendant
in Grafton was first tried and acquitted by a military court for the offense
of homicide, and then tried by a civilian criminal court for assassination,
and convicted of homicide, based on the same conduct. 206 U. S., at 349.
The second prosecution was held barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause.
Justice White argues that, just as Grafton had to be a soldier for the
military court to have jurisdiction, so too here the only relevance of the
CPO is that it gave the court authority to punish offenses "already prescribed by the criminal law." Post, at 740. This description does not
accurately portray the threat counts, see n. 8, supra--but the problem
with Justice White's analysis is deeper than that. The substantive offense for which Grafton was first tried (violation of Philippines Penal Code
Article 404) did not have as one of its elements status as a soldier, whereas
the substantive offense for which Foster was first tried did have as one of
its elements knowledge of an extant CPO. See supra, at 700-702. Since
military status was not an element of Grafton's charged offense, it is not

Opinion of the Court
many early American cases construing the Double Jeopardy
Clause, which support only an "elements" test. See Grady,
supra, at 533-535 (Scalia, J., dissenting).14

But Grady was not only wrong in principle; it has already
proved unstable in application. Less than two years after
it came down, in United States v. Felix, 503 U. S. 378 (1992),
we were forced to recognize a large exception to it. There
we concluded that a subsequent prosecution for conspiracy
to manufacture, possess, and distribute methamphetamine
was not barred by a previous conviction for attempt to manufacture the same substance. We offered as a justification for
avoiding a "literal" (i. e., faithful) reading of Grady "longstanding authority" to the effect that prosecution for conspiracy is not precluded by prior prosecution for the substantive
offense. Felix, supra, at 388-391. Of course the very existence of such a large and longstanding "exception" to the

true that our analysis would produce a result contrary to the opinion in
Grafton. Under the traditional Blockburger elements test, assassination,
as defined in Article 403 of the Philippines Penal Code, contained an element that homicide, as defined in Article 404, did not; but, as the Court
noted, homicide did not contain any element not included in assassination.
206 U. S., at 350 ("One crime may be a constituent part of the other");
accord, id., at 355 (he "could not subsequently be tried for the same offense"). Grafton could therefore not later be prosecuted for assassination,
much less later be convicted for the very same homicide offense of which
he had been acquitted. (In fact, Grafton may simply have been decided
on grounds of collateral estoppel, see id., at 349-351, an issue that we
specifically decline to reach in this case, see n. 17, infra.)

14 It is unclear what definition of "same offence" Justice Souter would

have us adopt for successive prosecution. At times, he appears content
with our having added to Blockburger the Grady same-conduct test. At
other times, however, he adopts an ultra-Grady "same transaction" rule,
which would require the Government to try together all offenses (regardless of the differences in the statutes) based on one event. See post, at
747, 761. Of course, the same-transaction test, long espoused by Justice
Brennan, see, e. g., Brown v. Ohio, 432 U. S. 161, 170 (1977) (concurring
opinion), has been consistently rejected by the Court. See, e. g., Garrett
v. United States, 471 U. S. 773, 790 (1985).

710 UNITED STATES v. DIXON

Opinion of the Court
Grady rule gave cause for concern that the rule was not anaccurate expression of the law. This "past practice" excuse

is not available to support the ignoring of Grady in the pres-ent case, since there is no Supreme Court precedent even
discussing this fairly new breed of successive prosecution(criminal contempt for violation of a court order prohibiting
a crime, followed by prosecution for the crime itself).A hypothetical based on the facts in

Harris reinforces theconclusion that Grady is a continuing source of confusion and

must be overruled. Suppose the State first tries the defend-ant for felony murder, based on robbery, and then indicts the
defendant for robbery with a firearm in the same incident.Absent

Grady, our cases provide a clear answer to the doublejeopardy claim in this situation. Under Blockburger, the

second prosecution is not barred--as it clearly was notbarred at common law, as a famous case establishes. In
King v. Vandercomb, 2 Leach. 708, 717, 168 Eng. Rep. 455,460 (K. B. 1796), the government abandoned, midtrial, prosecution of defendant for burglary by breaking and enteringand stealing goods, because it turned out that no property
had been removed on the date of the alleged burglary. Thedefendant was then prosecuted for burglary by breaking and
entering with intent to steal. That second prosecution wasallowed, because "these two offences are so distinct in their
nature, that evidence of one of them will not support an in-dictment for the other."

Grady, 495 U. S., at 532-535 (Scalia, J.,dissenting).

15 Justice Souter dislikes this result because it violates "the principles
behind the protection from successive prosecutions included in the Fifth
Amendment." Post, at 761. The "principles behind" the Fifth Amendment are more likely to be honored by following longstanding practice
than by following intuition. But in any case, Justice Souter's concern
that prosecutors will bring separate prosecutions in order to perfect their
case seems unjustified. They have little to gain and much to lose from
such a strategy. Under Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U. S. 436 (1970), an acquittal

Opinion of the Court
Having encountered today yet another situation in whichthe pre-Grady understanding of the Double Jeopardy Clause

allows a second trial, though the "same-conduct" test wouldnot, we think it time to acknowledge what is now, three years
after Grady, compellingly clear: The case was a mistake.We do not lightly reconsider a precedent, but, because

Gradycontradicted an "unbroken line of decisions," contained "less

than accurate" historical analysis, and has produced "confu-sion,"

16 we do so here. Solorio v. United States, 483 U. S.

in the first prosecution might well bar litigation of certain facts essential
to the second one--though a conviction in the first prosecution would not
excuse the Government from proving the same facts the second time.
Surely, moreover, the Government must be deterred from abusive, repeated prosecutions of a single offender for similar offenses by the sheer
press of other demands upon prosecutorial and judicial resources. Finally, even if Justice Souter's fear were well founded, no double jeopardy bar short of a same-transaction analysis will eliminate this problem;
but that interpretation of the Double Jeopardy Clause has been soundly
rejected, see, e. g., Garrett, supra, and would require overruling numerous
precedents, the latest of which is barely a year old, United States v. Felix,
503 U. S. 378 (1992).

16 See, e. g., Sharpton v. Turner, 964 F. 2d 1284, 1287 (CA2) (Grady formulation "has proven difficult to apply" and "whatever difficulties we have
previously encountered in grappling with the Grady language have not
been eased by" Felix), cert. denied, 506 U. S. 986 (1992); Ladner v. Smith,

Dixon's subsequent prosecution, as well as Count I of Fos-ter's subsequent prosecution, violate the Double Jeopardy

Clause.18 For the reasons set forth in Part IV, the othercounts of Foster's subsequent prosecution do not violate the
Double Jeopardy Clause.19 The judgment of the District ofColumbia Court of Appeals is affirmed in part and reversed
in part, and the case is remanded for proceedings not incon-sistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.
"[t]he Supreme Court did not really develop any new law in Grady with
respect to successive prosecutions," while dissent concludes that Grady
requires reversal). Commentators have confirmed that Grady contributed confusion rather than certainty. See Poulin, Double Jeopardy Protection against Successive Prosecutions in Complex Criminal Cases: A
Model, 25 Conn. L. Rev. 95 (1992); Thomas, A Modest Proposal to Save
the Double Jeopardy Clause, 69 Wash. U. L. Q. 195 (1991).

17 We do not address the motion to dismiss the threat counts based on

collateral estoppel, see Ashe v. Swenson, supra, because neither lower
court ruled on that issue.

the judgment.

this portion.

Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.
Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice O'Connor and Justice Thomas join, concurring in part and dis-senting in part.

Respondent Alvin Dixon possessed cocaine with intent todistribute it. For that he was held in contempt of court for
violating a condition of his bail release. He was later crimi-nally charged for the same conduct with possession with intent to distribute cocaine. Respondent Michael Foster as-saulted and threatened his estranged wife. For that he was
held in contempt of court for violating a civil protectionorder entered in a domestic relations proceeding. He was
later criminally charged for the same conduct with assault,threatening to injure another, and assault with intent to kill.

The Court today concludes that the Double Jeopardy
Clause prohibits the subsequent prosecutions of Foster forassault and Dixon for possession with intent to distribute

cocaine, but does not prohibit the subsequent prosecutions ofFoster for threatening to injure another or for assault with
intent to kill. After finding that at least some of the chargeshere are not prohibited by the "same-elements" test set out
in Blockburger v. United States, 284 U. S. 299, 304 (1932), theCourt goes on to consider whether there is a double jeopardy
bar under the "same-conduct" test set out in Grady v. Corbin, 495 U. S. 508, 510 (1990), and determines that there is.However, because the same-conduct test is inconsistent with

the text and history of the Double Jeopardy Clause, was adeparture from our earlier precedents, and has proven difficult to apply, the Court concludes that Grady must be over-ruled. I do not join Part III of

Justice Scalia's opinion
because I think that none of the criminal prosecutions in thiscase were barred under

Blockburger. I must then confront
the expanded version of double jeopardy embodied in Grady.
For the reasons set forth in the dissent in Grady, supra, at526 (opinion of

Scalia, J.), and in Part IV of the Court's
opinion, I, too, think that Grady must be overruled. I

therefore join Parts I, II, and IV of the Court's opinion, andwrite separately to express my disagreement with

Justice
Scalia's application of Blockburger in Part III.In my view,

Blockburger's same-elements test requires us
to focus, not on the terms of the particular court orders involved, but on the elements of contempt of court in the ordi-nary sense. Relying on

Harris v. Oklahoma, 433 U. S. 682
(1977), a three-paragraph per curiam in an unargued case,
Justice Scalia concludes otherwise today, and thus incorrectly finds in Part III-A of his opinion that the subsequentprosecutions of Dixon for drug distribution and of Foster for

assault violated the Double Jeopardy Clause. In so doing,
Justice Scalia rejects the traditional view--shared by
every Federal Court of Appeals and State Supreme Court
that addressed the issue prior to Grady--that, as a general
matter, double jeopardy does not bar a subsequent prosecution based on conduct for which a defendant has been held
in criminal contempt. I cannot subscribe to a reading of
Harris that upsets this previously well-settled principle of
law. Because the generic crime of contempt of court has
different elements than the substantive criminal charges in
this case, I believe that they are separate offenses under
Blockburger. I would therefore limit Harris to the context
in which it arose: where the crimes in question are analogous
to greater and lesser included offenses. The crimes at issue
here bear no such resemblance.

Justice Scalia dismisses out-of-hand, see ante, at 699,
the Government's reliance on several statements from our
prior decisions. See In re Debs, 158 U. S. 564, 594, 599-600
(1895); In re Chapman, 166 U. S. 661, 672 (1897); Jurney v.
MacCracken, 294 U. S. 125, 151 (1935). Those statements
are dicta, to be sure, and thus not binding on us as stare
decisis. Yet they are still significant in that they reflect the
unchallenged contemporaneous view among all courts that
the Double Jeopardy Clause does not prohibit separate
prosecutions for contempt and a substantive offense based

on the same conduct.1 This view, which dates back to the
English common law, see F. Wharton, Criminal Pleading and
Practice $ 444, p. 300 (8th ed. 1880), has prevailed to the present day. See generally 21 Am. Jur. 2d, Criminal Law $ 250,
p. 446 (1981). In fact, every Federal Court of Appeals and
state court of last resort to consider the issue before Grady
agreed that there is no double jeopardy bar to successive
prosecutions for criminal contempt and substantive criminal
offenses based on the same conduct. See, e. g., Hansen v.
United States, 1 F. 2d 316, 317 (CA7 1924); Orban v. United
States, 18 F. 2d 374, 375 (CA6 1927); State v. Sammons, 656

Ill. 2d 124, 134-139, 514 N. E. 2d 959, 963-965 (1987).2 It is
somewhat ironic, I think, that Justice Scalia today adopts
a view of double jeopardy that did not come to the fore
until after Grady, a decision which he (for the Court) goes
on to emphatically reject as "lack[ing] constitutional roots."
Ante, at 704.

At the heart of this pre-Grady consensus lay the common
belief that there was no double jeopardy bar under Blockburger. There, we stated that two offenses are different for

1 Justice Scalia suggests that the dicta in those earlier cases are of
limited value in light of Bloom v. Illinois, 391 U. S. 194 (1968), which held
that the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial applies to nonsummary
contempt prosecutions. But there is simply no reason to think that the
dicta in those cases were based on the understanding that prosecutions
for contempt were not subject to the Double Jeopardy Clause. Rather,
the principal theme running through the pre-Grady cases is that, while
nonsummary contempt is a criminal prosecution, that prosecution and
the later one for a substantive offense involve two separate and distinct
offenses.

2 The Court's discussion of the use of the contempt power at common

law and in 19th-century America, see ante, at 694-695, does not undercut
the relevance of these later, pre-Grady decisions--most of which are from
the late 20th century--to the instant case.

Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.
purposes of double jeopardy if "each provision requires proofof a fact which the other does not." 284 U. S., at 304 (emphasis added). Applying this test to the offenses at bar, itis clear that the elements of the governing contempt

provision are entirely different from the elements of the substantive crimes. Contempt of court comprises two elements: (i)a court order made known to the defendant, followed by (ii)

willful violation of that order. In re Gorfkle, 444 A. 2d 934,939 (D. C. 1982);

In re Thompson, 454 A. 2d 1324, 1326 (D. C.
1982). Neither of those elements is necessarily satisfied byproof that a defendant has committed the substantive offenses of assault or drug distribution. Likewise, no element
of either of those substantive offenses is necessarily satisfied
by proof that a defendant has been found guilty of contempt
of court.

Justice Scalia grounds his departure from Blockburger's customary focus on the statutory elements of the crimes
charged on Harris v. Oklahoma, supra, an improbable font
of authority. See ante, at 698. A summary reversal, like
Harris, "does not enjoy the full precedential value of a case
argued on the merits." Connecticut v. Doehr, 501 U. S. 1,
12, n. 4 (1991); accord, Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651,
671 (1974). Today's decision shows the pitfalls inherent in
reading too much into a "terse per curiam." Ante, at 698.
Justice Scalia's discussion of Harris is nearly as long as
Harris itself and consists largely of a quote, not from
Harris, but from a subsequent opinion analyzing Harris.
Justice Scalia then concludes that Harris somehow requires us to look to the facts that must be proved under
the particular court orders in question (rather than under
the general law of criminal contempt) in determining
whether contempt and the related substantive offenses are
the same for double jeopardy purposes. This interpretation
of Harris is both unprecedented and mistaken.

Our double jeopardy cases applying Blockburger have focused on the statutory elements of the offenses charged, not

on the facts that must be proved under the particular indict-ment at issue--an indictment being the closest analogue to

the court orders in this case. See, e. g., Grady, 495 U. S., at528 (

Scalia, J., dissenting) ("Th[e] test focuses on the statutory elements of the two crimes with which a defendant has
been charged, not on the proof that is offered or relied uponto secure a conviction");

Albernaz v. United States, 450 U. S.
333, 338 (1981) (" `[T]he Court's application of the test focuseson the statutory elements of the offense' " (quoting

Iannelli
v. United States, 420 U. S. 770, 785, n. 17 (1975))); United
States v. Woodward, 469 U. S. 105, 108 (1985) (per curiam)
(looking to the statutory elements of the offense in applying
Blockburger). By focusing on the facts needed to show a
violation of the specific court orders involved in this case,
and not on the generic elements of the crime of contempt
of court, Justice Scalia's double jeopardy analysis bears a
striking resemblance to that found in Grady--not what one
would expect in an opinion that overrules Grady.

Close inspection of the crimes at issue in Harris reveals,
moreover, that our decision in that case was not a departure
from Blockburger's focus on the statutory elements of the
offenses charged. In Harris, we held that a conviction for
felony murder based on a killing in the course of an armed
robbery foreclosed a subsequent prosecution for robbery
with a firearm. Though the felony-murder statute in Harris
did not require proof of armed robbery, it did include as an
element proof that the defendant was engaged in the commission of some felony. Harris v. State, 555 P. 2d 76, 80
(Okla. Crim. App. 1976). We construed this generic reference to some felony as incorporating the statutory elements
of the various felonies upon which a felony-murder conviction
could rest. Cf. Whalen v. United States, 445 U. S. 684, 694
(1980). The criminal contempt provision involved here, by
contrast, contains no such generic reference which by definition incorporates the statutory elements of assault or drug
distribution.

718 UNITED STATES v. DIXON

Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.
Unless we are to accept the extraordinary view that thethree-paragraph

per curiam in Harris was intended to overrule sub silentio our previous decisions that looked to thestatutory elements of the offenses charged in applying

Blockburger, we are bound to conclude, as does Justice
Scalia, see ante, at 698, that the ratio decidendi of our
Harris decision was that the two crimes there were akin to
greater and lesser included offenses. The crimes at issuehere, however, cannot be viewed as greater and lesser included offenses, either intuitively or logically. A crime suchas possession with intent to distribute cocaine is a serious
felony that cannot easily be conceived of as a lesser included
offense of criminal contempt, a relatively petty offense as
applied to the conduct in this case. See D. C. Code Ann.

$ 33-541(a)(2)(A) (Supp. 1992) (the maximum sentence for
possession with intent to distribute cocaine is 15 years in
prison). Indeed, to say that criminal contempt is an aggravated form of that offense defies common sense. Even
courts that have found a double jeopardy bar in cases resembling this one have appreciated how counterintuitive that notion is. E. g., United States v. Haggerty, 528 F. Supp. 1286,
1297 (Colo. 1981).

But there is a more fundamental reason why the offenses
in this case are not analogous to greater and lesser included
offenses. A lesser included offense is defined as one that is
"necessarily included" within the statutory elements of another offense. See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 31(c); Schmuck v.
United States, 489 U. S. 705, 716-717 (1989). Taking the
facts of Harris as an example, a defendant who commits
armed robbery necessarily has satisfied one of the statutory
elements of felony murder. The same cannot be said, of
course, about this case: A defendant who is guilty of possession with intent to distribute cocaine or of assault has not
necessarily satisfied any statutory element of criminal contempt. Nor, for that matter, can it be said that a defendant
who is held in criminal contempt has necessarily satisfied any

Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.
element of those substantive crimes. In short, the offensesfor which Dixon and Foster were prosecuted in this case cannot be analogized to greater and lesser included offenses;hence, they are separate and distinct for double jeopardy
purposes.3The following analogy, raised by the Government at oral
argument, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 8-9, helps illustrate the ab-surd results that

Justice Scalia's Harris/Blockburger anal-ysis could in theory produce. Suppose that the offense in

question is failure to comply with a lawful order of a policeofficer, see, e. g., Ind. Code $ 9-21-8-1 (Supp. 1992), and that
the police officer's order was, "Don't shoot that man."Under

Justice Scalia's flawed reading of Harris, the ele-ments of the offense of failure to obey a police officer's lawful

order would include, for purposes of Blockburger's same-elements test, the elements of, perhaps, murder or manslaughter, in effect converting those felonies into a lesser in-cluded offense of the crime of failure to comply with a lawful
order of a police officer.In sum, I think that the substantive criminal prosecutions
in this case, which followed convictions for criminal con3 Assuming, arguendo, that Justice Scalia's reading of Harris v. Oklahoma, 433 U. S. 682 (1977), is accurate, and that we must look to the terms
of the particular court orders involved, I believe Justice Scalia is correct
in differentiating among the various counts in Foster. The court order
there provided that Foster must " `not molest, assault, or in any manner
threaten or physically abuse' " his estranged wife. App. to Pet. for Cert.
4a. For Foster to be found in contempt of court, his wife need have
proved only that he had knowledge of the court order and that he assaulted or threatened her, but not that he assaulted her with intent to kill
(Count V) or that he threatened to inflict bodily harm (Counts II-IV). So
the crime of criminal contempt in Foster, even if analyzed under Justice
Scalia's reading of Harris, is nonetheless a different offense under Blockburger v. United States, 284 U. S. 299 (1932), than the crimes alleged in
Counts II-V of the indictment, since "each provision requires proof of a
fact which the other does not." Id., at 304. Because Justice Scalia
finds no double jeopardy bar with respect to those counts, I agree with
the result reached in Part III-B of his opinion.

tempt, did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause, at leastbefore our decision in

Grady. Under Grady, "the Double
Jeopardy Clause bars a subsequent prosecution if, to estab-lish an essential element of an offense charged in that prosecution, the government will prove conduct that constitutes
an offense for which the defendant has already been prose-cuted." 495 U. S., at 510. As the Court points out, see

ante, at 703-704, this case undoubtedly falls within that ex-pansive formulation: To secure convictions on the substantive criminal charges in this case, the Government will haveto prove conduct that was the basis for the contempt convictions. Forced, then, to confront Grady, I join the Court inoverruling that decision.

Justice White, with whom Justice Stevens joins, and
with whom Justice Souter joins as to Part I, concurring
in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.

I am convinced that the Double Jeopardy Clause bars
prosecution for an offense if the defendant already has been
held in contempt for its commission. Therefore, I agree
with the Court's conclusion that both Dixon's prosecution for
possession with intent to distribute cocaine and Foster's
prosecution for simple assault were prohibited. In my view,
however, Justice Scalia's opinion gives short shrift to the
arguments raised by the United States. I also am uncomfortable with the reasoning underlying this holding, in particular the application of Blockburger v. United States, 284
U. S. 299 (1932), to the facts of this case, a reasoning that
betrays an overly technical interpretation of the Constitution. As a result, I concur only in the judgment in Part
III-A.

The mischief in the Court's approach is far more apparent
in the second portion of today's decision. Constrained by its
narrow reading of the Double Jeopardy Clause, it asserts
that the fate of Foster's remaining counts depends on Grady
v. Corbin, 495 U. S. 508 (1990), which the Court then chooses

to overrule. Ante, at 704. I do not agree. Resolution ofthe question presented by Foster's case no more requires

reliance on Grady than it points to reasons for reversing thatdecision. Rather, as I construe the Clause, double jeopardy
principles compel equal treatment of all of Foster's counts.I dissent from the Court's holding to the contrary. Inasmuch as Grady has been dragged into this case, however, Iagree with

Justice Blackmun and Justice Souter that itshould not be overruled. Post, at 741, 744. From this aspect of the Court's opinion as well, I dissent.

I
The chief issue before us is whether the Double JeopardyClause applies at all to cases such as these.

Justice Scaliafinds that it applies, but does so in conclusory fashion, without dealing adequately with either the Government's argu-ments or the practical consequences of today's decision.
Both, in my view, are worthy of more.

A
The position of the United States is that, for the purposeof applying the Double Jeopardy Clause, a charge of criminal

contempt for engaging in conduct that is proscribed by courtorder and that is in turn forbidden by the criminal code is
an offense separate from the statutory crime. The UnitedStates begins by pointing to prior decisions of this Court to
support its view. Heavy reliance is placed on In re Debs,158 U. S. 564 (1895), but, as the majority notes, see

ante, at699, the relevant portion of the opinion is dictum--and seriously weakened dictum at that. See Bloom v. Illinois, 391U. S. 194 (1968).

The Government also relies on two cases involving Con-gress' power to punish by contempt a witness who refuses to
testify before it, In re Chapman, 166 U. S. 661 (1897), and Jurney v. MacCracken, 294 U. S. 125 (1935). Both cases appearto lean in the Government's direction, but neither is conclu509us3117M 03-28-97 20:18:34 PAGES OPINPGT
722 UNITED STATES v. DIXON

Opinion of White, J.
sive. First, the statements were dicta. The claim in Jurney and Chapman was that the power to punish for contempt
and the power to punish for commission of the statutory of-fense could not coexist side by side. But in neither were

both powers exercised; in neither case did the defendant face
a realistic threat of twice being put in jeopardy. In fact, asthe majority notes,

ante, at 698-699, n. 2, the Court expressed
doubt that consecutive prosecutions would be brought insuch circumstances. See

Chapman, supra, at 672.
Second, both decisions concern the power to deal with actsinterfering

directly with the performance of legislative functions, a power to which not all constitutional restraints on
the exercise of judiciary authority apply. See Marshall v.
Gordon, 243 U. S. 521, 547 (1917). The point, spelled out in
Marshall, is this: In a case such as Chapman, where the
contempt proceeding need not "resor[t] to the modes of trial
required by constitutional limitations . . . for substantive offenses under the criminal law," 243 U. S., at 543, so too will
it escape the prohibitions of the Double Jeopardy Clause. If,
however, it is of such a character as to be subject to these
constitutional restrictions, "those things which, as pointed
out in In re Chapman . . . , were distinct and did not therefore the one frustrate the other--the implied legislative authority to compel the giving of testimony and the right criminally to punish for failure to do so--would become one and
the same and the exercise of one would therefore be the exertion of, and the exhausting of the right to resort to, the
other." Id., at 547.

Marshall thus suggests that application of the Double
Jeopardy Clause, like that of other constitutional guarantees,
is a function of the type of contempt proceeding at issue.
Chapman, it follows, cannot be said to control this case.
Rather, whatever application Chapman (and, by implication,
Jurney) might have in the context of judicial contempt is
limited to cases of in-court contempts that constitute direct
obstructions of the judicial process and for which summary

Opinion of White, J.
proceedings remain acceptable. Cf. Marshall, supra, at 543.Neither Dixon nor Foster is such a case.

1

The United States' second, more powerful, argument isthat contempt and the underlying substantive crime constitute two separate offenses for they involve injuries to twodistinct interests, the one the interest of the court in preserving its authority, the other the public's interest in beingprotected from harmful conduct. This position finds support in Justice Blackmun's partial dissent, see post, at 743,and is bolstered by reference to numerous decisions acknowledging the importance and role of the courts' contemptpower. See,

e. g., Young v. United States ex rel. Vuitton et
Fils S. A., 481 U. S. 787, 800 (1987); Michaelson v. UnitedStates ex rel. Chicago, St. P., M. & O. R. Co., 266 U. S. 42, 65

(1924); Gompers v. Bucks Stove & Range Co., 221 U. S. 418,450 (1911). It cannot lightly be dismissed. Indeed, we recognized in Young, supra, that contempt "proceedings are notintended to punish conduct proscribed as harmful by the general criminal laws. Rather, they are designed to serve thelimited purpose of vindicating the authority of the court. In
punishing contempt, the Judiciary is sanctioning conduct that

1 The distinction between, on the one hand, direct and summary contempt (i. e., contempt for acts occurring in the courtroom and interfering
with the orderly conduct of business), and, on the other, nonsummary contempt, possesses old roots in the Court's cases. See United States v. Wilson, 421 U. S. 309 (1975); Cammer v. United States, 350 U. S. 399 (1956);
Nye v. United States, 313 U. S. 33, 47-52 (1941); Cooke v. United States,
267 U. S. 517, 537 (1925); In re Savin, 131 U. S. 267 (1889); Ex parte Terry,
128 U. S. 289 (1888). See also Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 42(a). Significantly,
some courts have relied on this division to allow retrial on substantive
criminal charges after a summary contempt proceeding based on the same
conduct. See, e. g., United States v. Rollerson, 145 U. S. App. D. C. 338,
343, n. 13, 449 F. 2d 1000, 1005, n. 13 (1971); United States v. Mirra, 220
F. Supp. 361 (SDNY 1963). The argument goes as follows: Because summary proceedings do not really involve adversary proceedings, see Cooke,
supra, they do not raise typical double jeopardy concerns and the defendant is not being subjected to successive trials. The instant cases deal
exclusively with nonsummary contempt trials.

violates specific duties imposed by the court itself, arisingdirectly from the parties' participation in judicial proceedings." Id., at 800.The fact that two criminal prohibitions promote different
interests may be indicative of legislative intent and, to that
extent, important in deciding whether cumulative punishments imposed in a single prosecution violate the Double
Jeopardy Clause. See Missouri v. Hunter, 459 U. S. 359,
366-368 (1983). But the cases decided today involve instances of successive prosecutions in which the interests
of the defendant are of paramount concern. To subject
an individual to repeated prosecutions exposes him to
"embarrassment, expense and ordeal," Green v. United
States, 355 U. S. 184, 187 (1957), violates principles of finality,
United States v. Wilson, 420 U. S. 332, 343 (1975), and
increases the risk of a mistaken conviction. That one of
the punishments is designed to protect the court rather
than the public is, in this regard, of scant comfort to the
defendant.2

It is true that the Court has not always given primacy
to the defendant's interest. In particular, the Government
directs attention to the dual sovereignty doctrine under
which, "[w]hen a defendant in a single act violates the `peace

2 It also is worth noting that sentences for contumacious conduct can be
quite severe. Under federal law, there is no statutory limit to the sentence that can be imposed in a jury-tried criminal contempt proceeding.
See 18 U. S. C. $ 401. The same is true in the District of Columbia. See
D. C. Code Ann. $ 11-944 (Supp. 1992); see also Caldwell v. United States,
595 A. 2d 961, 964-966 (D. C. 1991). Significantly, some courts have found
no bar to the imposition of a prison sentence for contempt even where the
court order that was transgressed was an injunction against violation of a
statute that itself did not provide for imprisonment as a penalty. See,
e. g., United States v. Quade, 563 F. 2d 375, 379 (CA8 1977), cert. denied,
434 U. S. 1064 (1978); Mitchell v. Fiore, 470 F. 2d 1149, 1154 (CA3 1972),
cert. denied, 411 U. S. 938 (1973); United States v. Fidanian, 465 F. 2d 755,

and dignity' of two sovereigns by breaking the laws of each,he has committed two distinct `offences.' " Heath v. Alabama, 474 U. S. 82, 88 (1985) (quoting United States v. Lanza,260 U. S. 377, 382 (1922)). See also United States v.
Wheeler, 435 U. S. 313, 317 (1978); Moore v. Illinois, 14How. 13, 19 (1852).

But the dual sovereignty doctrine is limited, by its ownterms, to cases where "the two entities that seek successively to prosecute a defendant for the same course of con-duct can be termed separate sovereigns."

Heath, 474 U. S.,at 88. "This determination," we explained, "turns on

whether the two entities draw their authority to punish theoffender from distinct sources of power,"

ibid., not onwhether they are pursuing separate interests. Indeed, the

Court has rejected the United States' precise argument inthe past, perhaps nowhere more resolutely than in Grafton
v. United States, 206 U. S. 333 (1907). In that case, the de-fendant, a private in the United States Army stationed in
the Philippines, was tried before a general court-martial forhomicide. Subsequent to Grafton's acquittal, the United
States filed a criminal complaint in civil court based on thesame acts. Seeking to discredit the view that the Double
Jeopardy Clause would be violated by this subsequent prose-cution, the Government asserted that "Grafton committed
two distinct offenses--one against military law and disci-pline, the other against the civil law which may prescribe the
punishment for crimes against organized society by whomso-ever those crimes are committed."

Id., at 351. To which
the Court responded:

"Congress, by express constitutional provision, has the
power to prescribe rules for the government and regula-tion of the Army, but those rules must be interpreted in

connection with the prohibition against a man's beingput twice in jeopardy for the same offense. . . . If, therefore, a person be tried for an offense in a tribunal deriv509us3117M 03-28-97 20:18:34 PAGES OPINPGT

ing its jurisdiction and authority from the United States
and is acquitted or convicted, he cannot again be tried
for the same offense in another tribunal deriving its
jurisdiction and authority from the United States. . . .
[T]he same acts constituting a crime against the United
States cannot, after the acquittal or conviction of the
accused in a court of competent jurisdiction, be made
the basis of a second trial of the accused for that crime
in the same or in another court, civil or military, of the
same government. Congress has chosen, in its discretion, to confer upon general courts-martial authority to
try an officer or soldier for any crime, not capital, committed by him in the territory in which he is serving.
When that was done the judgment of such military court
was placed upon the same level as the judgments of
other tribunals when the inquiry arises whether an
accused was, in virtue of that judgment, put in jeopardy
of life or limb." Id., at 352.

Grafton, and the principle it embodies, are controlling.
The Superior Court and the District of Columbia Court of
Appeals were created by Congress, pursuant to its power
under Article I of the Constitution. See Palmore v. United
States, 411 U. S. 389 (1973). In addition, the specific power
exercised by the courts in this case were bestowed by the
Legislature. See ante, at 691. As we observed in United
States v. Providence Journal Co., 485 U. S. 693 (1988), "[t]he
fact that the allegedly criminal conduct concerns a violation
of a court order instead of common law or a statutory prohibition does not render the prosecution any less an exercise
of the sovereign power of the United States." Id., at 700.
It is past dispute, in other words, that "the two tribunals
that tried the accused exert all their powers under and by
the authority of the same government--that of the United
States," Grafton, supra, at 355, and, therefore, that the dual

sovereignty doctrine poses no problem. Cf. Heath, supra,at 88.

Both the Government and amici submit that applicationof the Double Jeopardy Clause in this context carries grave

practical consequences. See also post, at 742-743 (Blackmun, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting inpart). It would, it is argued, cripple the power to enforce

court orders or, alternatively, allow individuals to escape se-rious punishment for statutory criminal offenses. The argument, an offshoot of the principle of necessity familiar to thelaw of contempt, see,

e. g., United States v. Wilson, 421 U. S.309, 315-318 (1975), is that, just as we have relaxed certain

procedural requirements in contempt proceedings wheretime is of the essence and an immediate remedy is needed to
"prevent a breakdown of the proceedings," id., at 319, so tooshould we exclude double jeopardy protections from this setting lest we do damage to the courts' authority. In other
words, "[t]he ability to punish disobedience to judicial orders[being] regarded as essential to ensuring that the Judiciary

has a means to vindicate its own authority," Young, 481 U. S.,at 796, its exercise should not be inhibited by fear that
it might immunize defendants from subsequent criminalprosecution.

Adherence to double jeopardy principles in this context,
however, will not seriously deter the courts from taking ap-propriate steps to ensure that their authority is not flouted.

3 That the contempt proceeding was brought and prosecuted by a private
party in Foster is immaterial. For "[p]rivate attorneys appointed to prosecute a criminal contempt action represent the United States, not the
party that is the beneficiary of the court order allegedly violated. As we
said in Gompers, criminal contempt proceedings arising out of civil litigation `are between the public and the defendant . . . .' 221 U. S., at 445."

Opinion of White, J.
Courts remain free to hold transgressors in contempt and
punish them as they see fit. The Government counters that
this possibility will prove to be either illusory--if the prosecuting authority declines to initiate proceedings out of fear
that they could jeopardize more substantial punishment for
the underlying crime--or too costly--if the prosecuting authority, the risk notwithstanding, chooses to go forward.
But it is not fanciful to imagine that judges and prosecutors
will select a third option, which is to ensure, where necessary
or advisable, that the contempt and the substantive charge
be tried at the same time, in which case the double jeopardy
issue "would be limited to ensuring that the total punishment did not exceed that authorized by the legislature."
United States v. Halper, 490 U. S. 435, 450 (1989). Indeed,
the Court recently exercised its supervisory power to suggest that a federal court "ordinarily should first request the
appropriate prosecuting authority to prosecute contempt actions, and should appoint a private prosecutor only if that
request is denied." Young, 481 U. S., at 801. Just as "[i]n
practice, courts can reasonably expect that the public prosecutor will accept the responsibility for prosecution," ibid., so
too can the public prosecutor reasonably anticipate that the
court will agree to some delay if needed to bring the two
actions together.

Against this backdrop, the appeal of the principle of necessity loses much of its force. Ultimately, the urgency of punishing such contempt violations is no less, but by the same
token no more, than that of punishing violations of criminal
laws of general application--in which case, we simply do not
question the defendant's right to the "protections worked out
carefully over the years and deemed fundamental to our system of justice," Bloom v. Illinois, 391 U. S., at 208, including
the protection of the Double Jeopardy Clause. "Perhaps to
some extent we sacrifice efficiency, expedition, and economy,
but the choice . . . has been made, and retained, in the Consti509us3117M 03-28-97 20:18:35 PAGES OPINPGT

tution. We see no sound reason in logic or policy not toapply it in the area of criminal contempt." Id., at 209.

Dixon aptly illustrates these points. In that case, the mo-tion requesting modification of the conditions of Dixon's release was filed by the Government, the same entity responsi-ble for prosecution of the drug offense. Indeed, in so doing
it relied explicitly on the defendant's indictment on the co-caine charge. 598 A. 2d 724, 728 (D. C. 1991). Logically,
any problem of coordination or of advance notice of the im-pending prosecution for the substantive offense was at most
minimal. Nor, aside from the legitimate desire to punish alloffenders swiftly, does there appear to have been any real
need to hold Dixon in contempt immediately, without waitingfor the second trial. By way of comparison, at the time of
his drug offense Dixon was awaiting trial for second-degreemurder, a charge that had been brought some 11 months
earlier.Besides, in the situation where a person has violated a
condition of release, there generally exist a number of alter-natives under which the defendant's right against being put
twice in jeopardy for the same offense could be safeguarded,while ensuring that disregard of the court's authority not go
unsanctioned. To the extent that they are exercised withdue regard for the Constitution, such options might include
modification of release conditions or revocation of bail anddetention.

5 As respondents acknowledge, these solutions

4 Like Justice Scalia, I take no position as to the application of the
Double Jeopardy Clause to conduct warranting summary contempt proceedings. See ante, at 697, n. 1. In different circumstances, the Court
has recognized exceptions to the policy of avoiding multiple trials where
" `there is a manifest necessity.' " United States v. Wilson, 420 U. S. 332,
344 (1975) (quoting United States v. Perez, 9 Wheat. 579, 580 (1824)).

5 The laws of different jurisdictions make such alternatives more or less

available but that, of course, can have no bearing on the constitutional
requirements we recognize today. In the District of Columbia, D. C. Code
Ann. $ 23-1329 (1989) contemplates both revocation of release and an order
of detention in the event a condition of release has been violated. Also,

would raise no double jeopardy problem. See Tr. of OralArg. 30.

More difficult to deal with are the circumstances surround-ing Foster's defiance of the court order. Realization of the
scope of domestic violence--according to the American Medi-cal Association (AMA), "the single largest cause of injury to
women," AMA, Five Issues in American Health 5 (1991)--has come with difficulty, and it has come late.

There no doubt are time delays in the operation of thecriminal justice system that are frustrating; they even can be
perilous when an individual is left exposed to a defendant'spotential violence. That is true in the domestic context; it is
true elsewhere as well. Resort to more expedient methodstherefore is appealing, and in many cases permissible.
Under today's decision, for instance, police officers retain thepower to arrest for violation of a civil protection order.
Where the offense so warrants, judges can haul the assailantbefore the court, charge him with criminal contempt, and
hold him without bail. See United States v. Salerno, 481
U. S. 739 (1987); United States v. Edwards, 430 A. 2d 1321(D. C. 1981). Also, cooperation between the government and

parties bringing contempt proceedings can be achieved.The various actors might not have thought such cooperation
necessary in the past; after today's decision, I suspect theywill.

trial court judges possess the authority to modify pretrial bail. See D. C.
Code Ann. $ 23-1321(f) (1989); Clotterbuck v. United States, 459 A. 2d 134
(D. C. 1983). Federal provisions are similar. Thus, 18 U. S. C. $ 3148(a)
provides that "[a] person who has been released [pending trial], and who
has violated a condition of his release, is subject to a revocation of release,
an order of detention, and a prosecution for contempt of court."

women who proceed pro se and are not familiar with the minutiae of double jeopardy law. Brief for Ayuda et al. as Amici Curiae 26. The point
is well taken. But the problem should be addressed by such means as
adequately informing pro se litigants, not by disregarding the Double
Jeopardy Clause.

Opinion of White, J.
Victims, understandably, would prefer to have access to aproceeding in which swift and expeditious punishment could

be inflicted for that offense without prejudice to a subse-quent full-blown criminal trial. The justification for such a
system, however, has nothing to do with preventing disrup-tion of a court's proceedings or even with vindicating its authority. While, under the principle of necessity, contemptproceedings have been exempted from some constitutional
constraints, this was done strictly "to secure judicial author-ity from obstruction in the performance of its duties to the
end that means appropriate for the preservation and enforce-ment of the Constitution may be secured."

Ex parte Hudgings, 249 U. S. 378, 383 (1919). No such end being invokedhere, the principle of necessity cannot be summoned for the

sole purpose of letting contempt proceedings achieve what,under our Constitution, other criminal trials cannot.

II
If, as the Court agrees, the Double Jeopardy Clause cannotbe ignored in this context, my view is that the subsequent

prosecutions in both Dixon and Foster were impermissibleas to

all counts. I reach this conclusion because the offensesat issue in the contempt proceedings were either identical to,

or lesser included offenses of, those charged in the subse-quent prosecutions.

Justice Scalia's contrary conclusionas to some of Foster's counts, which he reaches by exclusive

focus on the formal elements of the relevant crimes, is di-vorced from the purposes of the constitutional provision he
purports to apply. Moreover, the results to which this ap-proach would lead are indefensible.

A
The contempt orders in Foster and Dixon referred in onecase to the District's laws regarding assaults and threats,

and, in the other, to the criminal code in its entirety. Theprohibitions imposed by the court orders, in other words,

509us3117M 03-28-97 20:18:35 PAGES OPINPGT
732 UNITED STATES v. DIXON

Opinion of White, J.
duplicated those already in place by virtue of the criminalstatutes. Aside from differences in the sanctions inflicted,

the distinction between being punished for violation of thecriminal laws and being punished for violation of the court
orders, therefore, is simply this: Whereas in the former case"the entire population" is subject to prosecution, in the latter
such authority extends only to "those particular personswhose legal obligations result from their earlier participation
in proceedings before the court." Young, 481 U. S., at 800,n. 10. But the

offenses that are to be sanctioned in eitherproceeding must be similar, since the contempt orders incorporated, in full or in part, the criminal code.7

7 Justice Scalia disputes this description of the Civil Protection Order
(CPO). He questions whether the word " `assault' " meant " `assault under

$ 22-504,' " ante, at 700, n. 3, but defers to the contempt court's interpretation, and notes that the parties have not challenged this point. Ibid. He
also disagrees that the reference to "threats" was to threats "that violate
the District's criminal laws." Ante, at 702-703, n. 8. Indeed, given the
context--a "domestic situation"--he finds this construction "highly artificial." Ibid. But that, too, is how the court applying the court order appears to have understood it. Responding to the very argument made
here by Justice Scalia--namely that the "context of domestic violence"
somehow stretched the meaning of "threat," Tr. in Nos. IF-630-87, IF-
631-87 (Aug. 8, 1988), p. 315--the court asserted that "in a criminal case,
the defendant is entitled to more specific notice of the nature of the
charge." Id., at 316. Significantly, in acquitting Foster with respect to
the threat allegedly made on November 12, 1987, the court stated that it
was "not satisfied if those words as such, in spite of the context of this
dispute, constitutes a legal threat." Ibid. (emphasis added). For the
same reason that the court concluded that the word "assault" referred to
the District's criminal provisions, it decided that the CPO's reference to
"threats" was to "legal" threats--i. e., threats as defined by the law. Moreover, I note that the Government's presentation of this case coincides with
this view. See Brief for United States 26 (describing the order not to
"assault or in any manner threaten" as "direct[ing] Foster . . . to refrain
from engaging in criminal conduct").

In any event, even assuming that the prohibition in the court order
referred to threats other than those already outlawed, that should not
change the outcome of this case. The offense prohibited in the CPO--to
threaten "in any manner"--at the very least is "an incident and part of,"

Opinion of White, J.
Thus, in this case, the offense for which Dixon was heldin contempt was possession with intent to distribute drugs.

Since he previously had been indicted for precisely the sameoffense, the double jeopardy bar should apply. In Foster's
contempt proceeding, he was acquitted with respect tothreats allegedly made on November 12, 1987, and March 26
and May 17, 1988. He was found in contempt of court forhaving committed the following offenses: Assaulting his wife
on November 6, 1987, and May 21, 1988, and threatening heron September 17, 1987. 598 A. 2d, at 727; App. 42. The
subsequent indictment charged Foster with simple assaulton November 6, 1987 (Count I); threatening to injure another
on or about November 12, 1987, and March 26 and May 17,1988 (Counts II, III, and IV); and assault with intent to kill
on or about May 21, 1988 (Count V). All of the offenses forwhich Foster was either convicted or acquitted in the contempt proceeding were similar to, or lesser included offensesof, those charged in the subsequent indictment. Because
"the Fifth Amendment forbids successive prosecution . . . fora greater and lesser included offense,"

Brown v. Ohio, 432U. S. 161, 169 (1977); see also Grafton, 206 U. S., at 349-351,

the second set of trials should be barred in their entirety.

B
Professing strict adherence to Blockburger's so-called"same-elements" test, see

Blockburger v. United States, 284U. S. 299 (1932),
Justice Scalia opts for a more circuitousapproach. The elements of the crime of contempt, he reasons, in this instance are (1) the existence and knowledgeof a court, or CPO; and (2) commission of the underlying
substantive offense. See ante, at 701. Where the criminalconduct that forms the basis of the contempt order is identical to that charged in the subsequent trial, Justice Scalia
In re Nielsen, 131 U. S. 176, 187 (1889), the offense of criminal threat
defined in $ 22-2307. Therefore, for reasons explained below, prosecution
for one should preclude subsequent prosecution for the other.

509us3117M 03-28-97 20:18:35 PAGES OPINPGT
734 UNITED STATES v. DIXON

Opinion of White, J.
concludes, Blockburger forbids retrial. All elements of Foster's simple assault offense being included in his previous
contempt offense, prosecution on that ground is precluded.
Ante, at 700. The same is true of Dixon's drug offense.
Ibid. I agree with this conclusion, though would reach it
rather differently: Because in a successive prosecution case
the risk is that a person will have to defend himself more
than once against the same charge, I would have put to the
side the CPO (which, as it were, triggered the court's authority to punish the defendant for acts already punishable under
the criminal laws) and compared the substantive offenses of
which respondents stood accused in both prosecutions.8

The significance of our disaccord is far more manifest
where an element is added to the second prosecution.
Under Justice Scalia's view, the double jeopardy barrier
is then removed because each offense demands proof of an
element the other does not: Foster's conviction for contempt
requires proof of the existence and knowledge of a CPO,
which conviction for assault with intent to kill does not; his
conviction for assault with intent to kill requires proof of an
intent to kill, which the contempt conviction did not. Ante,
at 701. Finally, though he was acquitted in the contempt
proceedings with respect to the alleged November 12, March
26, and May 17 threats, his conviction under the threat
charge in the subsequent trial required the additional proof
that the threat be to kidnap, to inflict bodily injury, or to
damage property. Ante, at 702. As to these counts, and
absent any collateral-estoppel problem, see ante, at 712,

8 Therefore, I obviously disagree with The Chief Justice's Blockburger analysis which would require overruling not only Grady v. Corbin,
495 U. S. 508 (1990), but, as Justice Scalia explains, Harris v. Oklahoma, 433 U. S. 682 (1977), as well. See ante, at 698. At the very least,
where conviction of the crime of contempt cannot be had without conviction of a statutory crime forbidden by court order, the Double Jeopardy
Clause bars prosecution for the latter after acquittal or conviction of the
former.

Opinion of White, J.
n. 17, Justice Scalia finds that the Constitution does notprohibit retrial.

The distinction drawn by Justice Scalia is predicated ona reading of the Double Jeopardy Clause that is abstracted
from the purposes the constitutional provision is designed to
promote. To focus on the statutory elements of a crimemakes sense where

cumulative punishment is at stake, for
there the aim simply is to uncover legislative intent. The
Blockburger inquiry, accordingly, serves as a means to determine this intent, as our cases have recognized. See Missouri v. Hunter, 459 U. S., at 368. But, as Justice Souter
shows, adherence to legislative will has very little to do with
the important interests advanced by double jeopardy safeguards against successive prosecutions. Post, at 744. The
central purpose of the Double Jeopardy Clause being to protect against vexatious multiple prosecutions, see Hunter,
supra, at 365; United States v. Wilson, 420 U. S., at 343,
these interests go well beyond the prevention of unauthorized punishment. The same-elements test is an inadequate
safeguard, for it leaves the constitutional guarantee at the
mercy of a legislature's decision to modify statutory definitions. Significantly, therefore, this Court has applied an inflexible version of the same-elements test only once, in 1911,
in a successive prosecution case, see Gavieres v. United
States, 220 U. S. 338 (1911), and has since noted that "[t]he
Blockburger test is not the only standard for determining
whether successive prosecutions impermissibly involve the
same offense." Brown, 432 U. S., at 166-167, n. 6. Rather,
"[e]ven if two offenses are sufficiently different to permit the
imposition of consecutive sentences, successive prosecutions
will be barred in some circumstances where the second
prosecution requires the relitigation of factual issues already
resolved by the first." Ibid.

Take the example of Count V in Foster: For all intents
and purposes, the offense for which he was convicted in the
contempt proceeding was his assault against his wife. The

Opinion of White, J.
majority, its eyes fixed on the rigid elements test, wouldhave his fate turn on whether his subsequent prosecution

charges "simple assault" or "assault with intent to kill."Yet, because the crime of "simple assault" is included within
the crime of "assault with intent to kill," the reasons that
bar retrial under the first hypothesis are equally presentunder the second: These include principles of finality, see

United States v. Wilson, supra, at 343; protecting Fosterfrom "embarrassment" and "expense,"

Green v. United
States, 355 U. S., at 187; and preventing the Governmentfrom gradually fine-tuning its strategy, thereby minimizing

exposure to a mistaken conviction, id., at 188. See also
Tibbs v. Florida, 457 U. S. 31, 41 (1982); Arizona v. Washington, 434 U. S. 497, 503-504 (1978); supra, at 724.

Analysis of the threat charges (Counts II-IV) makes thepoint more clearly still. In the contempt proceeding, it will

be recalled, Foster was acquitted of the--arguably lesserincluded--offense of threatening "in any manner." As we
have stated:

"[T]he law attaches particular significance to an acquittal. To permit a second trial after an acquittal, how-ever mistaken the acquittal might have been, would

present an unacceptably high risk that the Government,with its vastly superior resources, might wear down the
defendant so that `even though innocent he may be foundguilty.' "

United States v. Scott, 437 U. S. 82, 91 (1978)
(citation omitted).

To allow the Government to proceed on the threat counts
would present precisely the risk of erroneous conviction the
Clause seeks to avoid. That the prosecution had to establish
the existence of the CPO in the first trial, in short, does
not in any way modify the prejudice potentially caused to a
defendant by consecutive trials.

To respond, as the majority appears to do, that concerns
relating to the defendant's interests against repeat trials are

Opinion of White, J.
"unjustified" because prosecutors "have little to gain andmuch to lose" from bringing successive prosecutions and because "the Government must be deterred from abusive, re-peated prosecutions of a single offender for similar offenses
by the sheer press of other demands upon prosecutorial andjudicial resources,"

ante, at 710-711, n. 15, is to get thingsexactly backwards. The majority's prophesies might be correct, and double jeopardy might be a problem that will sim-ply take care of itself. Not so, however, according to the
Constitution, whose firm prohibition against double jeopardycannot be satisfied by wishful thinking.

C
Further consequences--at once illogical and harmful--flow from

Justice Scalia's approach.9 I turn for illustra-tion once more to Foster's assault case. In his second prosecution, the Government brought charges of assault withintent to kill. In the District of Columbia, Superior Court
Criminal Rule 31(c)--which faithfully mirrors its federalcounterpart, Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 31(c)--provides that a "defendant may be found guilty of an offensenecessarily included in the offense charged or of an attempt
to commit either the offense charged or an offense necessar-ily included therein if the attempt is an offense." This provision has been construed to require the jury to determineguilt of all lesser included offenses. See

Simmons v. UnitedStates, 554 A. 2d 1167 (D. C. 1989). Specifically, "[a] defendant is entitled to a lesser-included offense instruction when(1) all elements of the lesser offense are included within the
offense charged, and (2) there is a sufficient evidentiary basisfor the lesser charge." Rease v. United States, 403 A. 2d
322, 328 (D. C. 1979) (citations omitted).Simple assault being a lesser included offense of assault
with intent to kill, cf. Keeble v. United States, 412 U. S. 205

9 Similar results follow, of course, from The Chief Justice's interpretation of the Clause.

509us3117M 03-28-97 20:18:35 PAGES OPINPGT
738 UNITED STATES v. DIXON

Opinion of White, J.
(1973), the jury in the second prosecution would in all likeli-hood receive instructions on the lesser offense and could find

Foster guilty of simple assault. In short, while the Govern-ment cannot, under the Constitution, bring charges of simple
assault, it apparently can, under the majority's interpreta-tion, secure a

conviction for simple assault, so long as it pros-ecutes Foster for assault with intent to kill. As I see it,

Foster will have been put in jeopardy twice for simple as-sault.

10 The result is as unjustifiable as it is pernicious. It

10 Justice Scalia's dismissal of this concern is difficult to follow. As I
understand it, he maintains that no double jeopardy problem exists because under Blockburger a conviction for assault would not be upheld.
See ante, at 702, n. 7. I suppose that the judge could upon request instruct the jury on the lesser included offense and await its verdict; if it
were to find Foster guilty of simple assault, the court could then vacate
the conviction as violative of the Double Jeopardy Clause--or, barring
that, Foster could appeal his conviction on that basis. The sheer oddity
of this scenario aside, it falls short of providing Foster with the full constitutional protection to which he is entitled. A double jeopardy violation
occurs at the inception of trial, which is why an order denying a motion
to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds is immediately appealable. See
Abney v. United States, 431 U. S. 651 (1977). As we explained in that
case: "[T]he Double Jeopardy Clause protects an individual against more
than being subjected to double punishments. It is a guarantee against
being twice put to trial for the same offense." Id., at 660-661. In light
of the lesser included offense instructions, and the associated risk of conviction for that offense, Foster would have to defend himself in his second
trial once more against the charge of simple assault, thereby undergoing
the "personal strain, public embarrassment, and expense of a criminal
trial." Id., at 661. Even if the conviction were set aside, he still would
have "been forced to endure a trial that the Double Jeopardy Clause was
designed to prohibit." Id., at 662. Indeed, I would have imagined that
Justice Scalia would agree. As he recently wrote: "Since the Double
Jeopardy Clause protects the defendant from being `twice put in jeopardy,'
i. e., made to stand trial . . . for the `same offence,' it presupposes that
sameness can be determined before the second trial. Otherwise, the
Clause would have prohibited a second `conviction' or `sentence' for the
same offense." Grady, 495 U. S., at 529 (dissenting opinion) (emphasis
added). This double jeopardy predicament, of course, could be avoided by
Foster's attorney not requesting the lesser included offense instructions to

stems, I believe, from a "hypertechnical and archaic ap-proach," Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U. S. 436, 444 (1970).

"Archaic" might not quite be the word, for even as far backas 1907 the Court appeared to hold a more pragmatic view.
Defendant's court-martial in Grafton was authorized underthe 62d Article of War, pursuant to which Congress granted
military courts the power to try "officers and soldiers" intime of peace "for any offense, not capital, which the civil
law declares to be a crime against the public." 206 U. S., at341-342, 348, 351. Grafton faced the following charge: " `In
that Private Homer E. Grafton . . . being a sentry on post, didunlawfully, willfully, and feloniously kill Florentino Castro, a
Philippino . . . [and] Felix Villanueva, a Philippino.' " Id., at341. He was acquitted. Id., at 342. Some three months
later, Grafton was prosecuted in a civil criminal court. Hewas charged with the crime of "assassination," defined as a
killing accompanied by any of the following: "(1) With treach-ery; (2) For price or promise of reward; (3) By means of flood,
fire, or poison; (4) With deliberate premeditation; (5) Withvindictiveness, by deliberately and inhumanly increasing
the suffering of the person attacked." Id., at 343. Graftonultimately was found guilty of homicide, a lesser included
offense. Id., at 344.To convict Grafton in the first proceeding, then, it had to
be established that (1) he was an officer or a soldier, and (2)he unlawfully killed. In the civil tribunal, the prosecution
was required to prove (1) the killing, and (2) some furtherelement, as specified. Had Grafton been tried in 1993 rather
than 1907, I suppose that an inflexible Blockburger test,which asks whether "each provision requires proof of a fact
the other does not," 284 U. S., at 304, would uncover no dou-ble jeopardy problem. At the time, though, the Court
looked at matters differently: Both trials being for the samekilling, and "[t]he identity of the offenses [being] determined,

which his client is entitled. But to place a defendant before such a choice
hardly strikes me as a satisfactory resolution.

Opinion of White, J.
not by their grade, but by their nature," id., at 350, prosecut-ing Grafton for assassination meant twice putting him in

jeopardy for the same offense.I would dispose of Foster's case in like fashion, and focus
on what Justice Scalia overlooks: The interests safe-guarded by the Double Jeopardy Clause, and the fact that
Foster should not have to defend himself twice against thesame charges. When the case is so viewed, the condition
that Foster be subject to a contempt order as a practicalmatter is analogous to the condition that Grafton be a soldier,
for it triggered the court's authority to punish offensesalready prescribed by the criminal law. At that point, the
relevant comparison for double jeopardy purposes should bebetween the offenses charged in the two proceedings.

III
Once it is agreed that the Double Jeopardy Clause appliesin this context, the Clause, properly construed, both governs

this case and disposes of the distinction between Foster'scharges upon which

Justice Scalia relies. I therefore seelittle need to draw
Grady into this dispute. In any event,the United States itself has not attempted to distinguish between Dixon and Foster or between the charges of "assault"on the one hand and, on the other, "assault with intent to
kill" and "threat to injure another." The issue was notraised before the Court of Appeals or considered by it, and
it was neither presented in the petition for certiorari norbriefed by either party. Under these circumstances, it is
injudicious to address this matter. See, e. g., Mazer v. Stein,347 U. S. 201, 206, n. 5 (1954);

Adickes v. S. H. Kress & Co.,398 U. S. 144, 147, n. 2 (1970).

The majority nonetheless has chosen to consider Gradyanew and to overrule it. I agree with

Justice Blackmunand
Justice Souter that such a course is both unwarrantedand unwise. See

post, at 741, 744. Hence, I dissent fromthe judgment overruling Grady.

Believing that the Double Jeopardy Clause bars Foster'sand Dixon's successive prosecutions on all counts, I would

affirm the judgment of the District of Columbia Court of Ap-peals. I concur in the judgment of the Court in Part III-A,
which holds that Dixon's subsequent prosecution and Count Iof Foster's subsequent prosecution were barred. I disagree
with Justice Scalia's application of Blockburger in PartIII-B. From Part IV of the opinion, in which the majority
decides to overrule Grady, I dissent.

Justice Blackmun, concurring in the judgment in partand dissenting in part.

I cannot agree that contempt of court is the "same offence"under the Double Jeopardy Clause as either assault with intent to kill or possession of cocaine with intent to distributeit. I write separately to emphasize two interrelated points.

I
I agree with Justice Souter that "the Blockburger testis not the exclusive standard for determining whether the

rule against successive prosecutions applies in a given case."
Post, at 756. I also share both his and Justice White'sdismay that the Court so cavalierly has overruled a precedent that is barely three years old and that has proved nei-ther unworkable nor unsound. I continue to believe that
Grady v. Corbin, 495 U. S. 508 (1990), was correctly decided,and that the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits a subsequent
criminal prosecution where the proof required to convict onthe later offense would require proving conduct that constitutes an offense for which a defendant already has beenprosecuted.

If this were a case involving successive prosecutions underthe substantive criminal law (as was true in Harris v. Oklahoma, 433 U. S. 682 (1977), Illinois v. Vitale, 447 U. S. 410(1980), and Grady), I would agree that the Double Jeopardy

742 UNITED STATES v. DIXON

Opinion of Blackmun, J.
Clause could bar the subsequent prosecution. But we are
concerned here with contempt of court, a special situation.
We explained in Young v. United States ex rel. Vuitton et
Fils S. A., 481 U. S. 787 (1987):

"The fact that we have come to regard criminal contempt as `a crime in the ordinary sense,' [Bloom v. Illinois, 391 U. S. 194, 201 (1968)], does not mean that any
prosecution of contempt must now be considered an execution of the criminal law in which only the Executive
Branch may engage. . . . That criminal procedure protections are now required in such prosecutions should not
obscure the fact that these proceedings are not intended
to punish conduct proscribed as harmful by the general
criminal laws. Rather, they are designed to serve the
limited purpose of vindicating the authority of the court.
In punishing contempt, the Judiciary is sanctioning conduct that violates specific duties imposed by the court
itself, arising directly from the parties' participation in
judicial proceedings." Id., at 799-800.

The purpose of contempt is not to punish an offense
against the community at large but rather to punish the specific offense of disobeying a court order. This Court said
nearly a century ago: "[A] court, enforcing obedience to its
orders by proceedings for contempt, is not executing the
criminal laws of the land, but only securing to suitors the
rights which it has adjudged them entitled to." In re Debs,
158 U. S. 564, 596 (1895).

II

Contempt is one of the very few mechanisms available to
a trial court to vindicate the authority of its orders. I fear
that the Court's willingness to overlook the unique interests
served by contempt proceedings not only will jeopardize the
ability of trial courts to control those defendants under their
supervision but will undermine their ability to respond effec509us3117M 03-28-97 20:18:35 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of Souter, J.
tively to unmistakable threats to their own authority and tothose who have sought the court's protection.

This fact is poignantly stressed by the amici:

"[C]ontempt litigators and criminal prosecutors seek to
further different interests. A battered woman seeks toenforce her private order to end the violence against

her. In contrast, the criminal prosecutor is vindicating
society's interest in enforcing its criminal law. The two
interests are not the same, and to consider the contemptlitigator and the criminal prosecutor as one and the

same would be to adopt an absurd fiction." Brief for
Ayuda et al. as Amici Curiae 20 (emphasis in original).

Finally, I cannot so easily distinguish between "summary"and "nonsummary" contempt proceedings,

for the interests served in both are fundamentally similar.
It is as much a "disruption of judicial process," ante, at 695,to disobey a judge's conditional release order as it is to disturb a judge's courtroom. And the interests served in vindi-cating the authority of the court are fundamentally different
from those served by the prosecution of violations of the sub-stantive criminal law. Because I believe that neither Dixon
nor Foster would be "subject for the same offence to be twiceput in jeopardy of life or limb," U. S. Const., Amdt. 5, I
would reverse the judgment of the District of Columbia

Court of Appeals.

Justice Souter, with whom Justice Stevens joins,concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.

While I agree with the Court as far as it goes in holdingthat a citation for criminal contempt and an indictment for
violating a substantive criminal statute may amount tocharges of the "same offence" for purposes of the Double
Jeopardy Clause, U. S. Const., Amdt. 5, I cannot join the
Court in restricting the Clause's reach and dismembering the
protection against successive prosecution that the Constitu509us3117M 03-28-97 20:18:35 PAGES OPINPGT

tion was meant to provide. The Court has read our prece-dents so narrowly as to leave them bereft of the principles

animating that protection, and has chosen to overrule themost recent of the relevant cases, Grady v. Corbin, 495 U. S.
508 (1990), decided three years ago. Because I think that
Grady was correctly decided, amounting merely to an ex-pression of just those animating principles, and because,

even if the decision had been wrong in the first instance,there is no warrant for overruling it now, I respectfully dissent. I join Part I of Justice White's opinion, and I wouldhold, as he would, both the prosecution of Dixon and the
prosecution of Foster under all the counts of the indictmentagainst him to be barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause.

I
In providing that no person shall "be subject for the sameoffence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb," U. S.

Const., Amdt. 5, the Double Jeopardy Clause protectsagainst two distinct types of abuses. See

North Carolina v.Pearce, 395 U. S. 711, 717 (1969). It protects against being

punished more than once for a single offense, or "multiplepunishment." Where a person is being subjected to more
than one sentence, the Double Jeopardy Clause ensures thathe is not receiving for one offense more than the punishment
authorized. The Clause also protects against being prose-cuted for the same offense more than once, or "successive
prosecution." "It protects against a second prosecution forthe same offense after acquittal. It protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction."
Ibid. (footnotes omitted). The Clause functions in differentways in the two contexts, and the analysis applied to claims

of successive prosecution differs from that employed to ana-lyze claims of multiple punishment.

1 Consequently, I concur in the Court's judgment with respect to Dixon's
prosecution and the prosecution of Foster under Count I of the indictment
against him.

In addressing multiple punishments, "the role of the con-stitutional guarantee is limited to assuring that the court

does not exceed its legislative authorization by imposingmultiple punishments for the same offense."

Brown v. Ohio,432 U. S. 161, 165 (1977). Courts enforcing the federal guarantee against multiple punishment therefore must examinethe various offenses for which a person is being punished to
determine whether, as defined by the legislature, any two ormore of them are the same offense. Over 60 years ago, this
Court stated the test still used today to determine "whethertwo offenses are sufficiently distinguishable to permit the imposition of cumulative punishment," id., at 166:

"[W]here the same act or transaction constitutes a viola-tion of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be

applied to determine whether there are two offenses oronly one, is whether each provision requires proof of a
fact which the other does not." Blockburger v. United
States, 284 U. S. 299, 304 (1932).

The Blockburger test "emphasizes the elements of the twocrimes." Brown, supra, at 166. Indeed, the determination

whether two statutes describe the "same offence" for multi-ple punishment purposes has been held to involve only a
question of statutory construction. We ask what the ele-ments of each offense are as a matter of statutory interpretation, to determine whether the legislature intended "to im-pose separate sanctions for multiple offenses arising in the
course of a single act or transaction." Iannelli v. United
States, 420 U. S. 770, 785, n. 17 (1975). See, e. g., Brown,
supra, at 167-168 (noting, in applying Blockburger, that statecourts " `have the final authority to interpret . . . [a] State's

legislation' " (quoting Garner v. Louisiana, 368 U. S. 157, 169(1961))). The Court has even gone so far as to say that the
Blockburger test will not prevent multiple punishmentwhere legislative intent to the contrary is clear, at least in

Opinion of Souter, J.
the case of state law. "Where . . . a legislature specificallyauthorizes cumulative punishments under two statutes, regardless of whether those two statutes proscribe the `same'conduct under Blockburger, a court's task of statutory construction is at an end and the prosecutor may seek and thetrial court or jury may impose cumulative punishment under
such statutes in a single trial." Missouri v. Hunter, 459U. S. 359, 368-369 (1983); see

Ohio v. Johnson, 467 U. S. 493,499, n. 8 (1984).

With respect to punishment for a single act, the Block-burger test thus asks in effect whether the legislature meant

it to be punishable as more than one crime. To give thegovernment broad control over the number of punishments
that may be meted out for a single act, however, is consistentwith the general rule that the government may punish as
it chooses, within the bounds contained in the Eighth andFourteenth Amendments. With respect to punishment,
those provisions provide the primary protection against ex-cess. "Because the substantive power to prescribe crimes
and determine punishments is vested with the legislature,the question under the Double Jeopardy Clause whether
punishments are `multiple' is essentially one of legislativeintent."

Johnson, supra, at 499 (citations and footnoteomitted).

III
The interests at stake in avoiding successive prosecutionsare different from those at stake in the prohibition against

multiple punishments, and our cases reflect this reality. Theprotection against successive prosecutions is the central protection provided by the Clause. A 19th-century case of thisCourt observed that "[t]he prohibition is not against being

2 For purposes of this case I need express no view on this question,
whether the proscription of punishment for state-law offenses that fail the
Blockburger test can somehow be overcome by a clearly shown legislative
intent that they be punished separately. See Albernaz v. United States,
450 U. S. 333, 344-345 (1981) (Stewart, J., concurring in judgment).

Opinion of Souter, J.
twice punished, but against being twice put in jeopardy; andthe accused, whether convicted or acquitted, is equally put

in jeopardy at the first trial." United States v. Ball, 163U. S. 662, 669 (1896). "Where successive prosecutions are at
stake, the guarantee serves `a constitutional policy of finality
for the defendant's benefit.' " Brown, supra, at 165 (quoting
United States v. Jorn, 400 U. S. 470, 479 (1971) (plurality
opinion)).The Double Jeopardy Clause prevents the government

from "mak[ing] repeated attempts to convict an individualfor an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a
continuing state of anxiety and insecurity." Green v. United
States, 355 U. S. 184, 187 (1957). The Clause addresses a
further concern as well, that the government not be given
the opportunity to rehearse its prosecution, "honing its trial
strategies and perfecting its evidence through successive attempts at conviction," Tibbs v. Florida, 457 U. S. 31, 41
(1982), because this "enhanc[es] the possibility that even
though innocent [the defendant] may be found guilty," Green,
supra, at 188.

Consequently, while the government may punish a person
separately for each conviction of at least as many different
offenses as meet the Blockburger test, we have long held
that it must sometimes bring its prosecutions for these offenses together. If a separate prosecution were permitted
for every offense arising out of the same conduct, the government could manipulate the definitions of offenses, creating
fine distinctions among them and permitting a zealous prosecutor to try a person again and again for essentially the same
criminal conduct. While punishing different combinations
of elements is consistent with the Double Jeopardy Clause in
its limitation on the imposition of multiple punishments (a
limitation rooted in concerns with legislative intent), permitting such repeated prosecutions would not be consistent with
the principles underlying the Clause in its limitation on suc509us3117M 03-28-97 20:18:35 PAGES OPINPGT
748 UNITED STATES v. DIXON

Opinion of Souter, J.
cessive prosecutions. The limitation on successive prosecu-tions is thus a restriction on the government different in

kind from that contained in the limitation on multiple punish-ments, and the government cannot get around the restriction
on repeated prosecution of a single individual merely by pre-cision in the way it defines its statutory offenses. Thus,
"[t]he Blockburger test is not the only standard for determin-ing whether successive prosecutions impermissibly involve
the same offense. Even if two offenses are sufficiently dif-ferent to permit the imposition of consecutive sentences, successive prosecutions will be barred in some circumstanceswhere the second prosecution requires the relitigation of
factual issues already resolved by the first." Brown, 432U. S., at 166-167, n. 6.

An example will show why this should be so. Assumethree crimes: robbery with a firearm, robbery in a dwelling,
and simple robbery. The elements of the three crimes arethe same, except that robbery with a firearm has the element
that a firearm be used in the commission of the robbery whilethe other two crimes do not, and robbery in a dwelling has
the element that the robbery occur in a dwelling while theother two crimes do not.

If a person committed a robbery in a dwelling with a fire-arm and was prosecuted for simple robbery, all agree he
could not be prosecuted subsequently for either of thegreater offenses of robbery with a firearm or robbery in a
dwelling. Under the lens of Blockburger, however, if thatsame person were prosecuted first for robbery with a firearm, he could be prosecuted subsequently for robbery in adwelling, even though he could not subsequently be prosecuted on the basis of that same robbery for simple robbery.3This is true simply because neither of the crimes, robbery

3 Our cases have long made clear that the order in which one is prosecuted for two crimes alleged to be the same matters not in demonstrating
a violation of double jeopardy. See Brown v. Ohio, 432 U. S. 161, 168
(1977) ("[T]he sequence is immaterial").

Opinion of Souter, J.
with a firearm and robbery in a dwelling, is either identicalto or a lesser included offense of the other. But since the

purpose of the Double Jeopardy Clause's protection againstsuccessive prosecutions is to prevent repeated trials in which
a defendant will be forced to defend against the same chargeagain and again, and in which the government may perfect
its presentation with dress rehearsal after dress rehearsal,it should be irrelevant that the second prosecution would require the defendant to defend himself not only from thecharge that he committed the robbery, but also from the
charge of some additional fact, in this case, that the scene ofthe crime was a dwelling.

4 If, instead, protection against

successive prosecutions were as limited as it would be by
Blockburger alone, the doctrine would be as striking for itsanomalies as for the limited protection it would provide.

Thus, in the relatively few successive prosecution cases wehave had over the years, we have not held that the

Block-burger test is the only hurdle the government must clear

(with one exception, see infra, at 758-759).

IV
The recognition that a Blockburger rule is insufficient pro-tection against successive prosecution can be seen as long

ago as In re Nielsen, 131 U. S. 176 (1889), where we heldthat conviction for one statutory offense precluded later
prosecution for another, even though each required proof ofa fact the other did not. There, appellant Nielsen had been
convicted after indictment and a guilty plea in what was thenthe Territory of Utah for "cohabit[ing] with more than one
woman," based upon his cohabitation with Anna Lavinia

4 The irrelevance of additional elements can be seen in the fact that, as
every Member of the Court agrees, the Double Jeopardy Clause does provide protection not merely against prosecution a second time for literally
the same offense, but also against prosecution for greater offenses in which
the first crime was lesser included, offenses that by definition require proof
of one or more additional elements.

Nielsen and Caroline Nielsen during the period from October15, 1885, to May 13, 1888, in violation of a federal antipolygamy law. See Act of Mar. 22, 1882, ch. 47, $ 3, 22 Stat. 31.Nielsen served his sentence of three months' imprisonment
and paid a $100 fine. He then came to trial on a second
indictment charging him under another federal antipolygamylaw with committing adultery with Caroline Nielsen on the

day following the period described in the first indictment,May 14, 1888, based on the fact that he was married and had
a lawful wife, and was not married to Caroline Nielsen. SeeAct of Mar. 3, 1887, ch. 397, $ 3, 24 Stat. 635. Nielsen
pleaded former jeopardy to the second indictment, arguing
first that the true period of the cohabitation charged in the
first indictment extended well beyond May 13 until the day
of the indictments, September 27, 1888, and that "the offence
charged in both indictments was one and the same offence
and not divisible." 131 U. S., at 178. The Government argued that the two crimes were not the same because the
elements of the two offenses differed.

The Nielsen Court first considered the question whether
the offense of unlawful cohabitation included, in a temporal
sense, the single act of adultery subsequently prosecuted.
On this question, the Court first noted, following In re Snow,
120 U. S. 274 (1887), that although the indictment for cohabitation listed May 13, 1888, as the end of that offense, cohabitation is a " `continuing offence . . . [that] can be committed
but once, for the purposes of indictment or prosecution, prior
to the time the prosecution is instituted.' " 131 U. S., at 186
(quoting Snow, supra, at 282). Thus, the Nielsen Court interpreted the indictment for cohabitation as covering a single continuing offense that ended on the day the indictment
was handed up. See 131 U. S., at 187.

Having concluded that the offense of cohabitation was a
"continuous" one, "extending over the whole period, including the time when the adultery was alleged to have been
committed," id., at 187, the Court then considered the ques509us3117M 03-28-97 20:18:35 PAGES OPINPGT

751Cite as: 509 U. S. 688 (1993)
Opinion of Souter, J.
tion whether double jeopardy applies where a defendant isfirst convicted of a continuing offense and then indicted for

some single act that the continuing offense includes. TheCourt answered this question by quoting with approval an
observation found in Morey v. Commonwealth, 108 Mass. 433
(1871), that "[a] conviction of being a common seller of intox-icating liquors has been held to bar a prosecution for a single

sale of such liquors within the same time." Id., at 435. TheCourt then conceded that quoting this observation from the
Morey opinion would not alone suffice to decide the case be-fore it, since the Government was relying on a further statement from Morey, this one expressing the Morey court's reason for holding that a prior conviction on a charge of "lewdly
and lasciviously associating" with an unmarried woman was
no bar to a subsequent prosecution for adultery: "[A]lthough
proof of the same acts of unlawful intercourse was introduced
on both trials[,] . . . the evidence required to support the
two indictments was not the same." 131 U. S., at 188. The
Morey court's reasoning behind this holding was that "[a]
single act may be an offence against two statutes; and if each
statute requires proof of an additional fact which the other
does not, an acquittal or conviction under either statute does
not exempt the defendant from prosecution and punishment
under the other." 108 Mass., at 434, quoted in Nielsen,
supra, at 188. Morey's rule governing subsequent prosecution, in other words, was what we know today as the Blockburger elements test.

The Nielsen Court held the Blockburger test inapplicable
for two reasons. First, it distinguished Morey by noting
that "[t]he crime of loose and lascivious association . . . did
not necessarily imply sexual intercourse," 131 U. S., at 188,
while the continuous offense involved in Nielsen, cohabitation under the polygamy statute, required proof of "[l]iving
together as man and wife," which "[o]f course" implies "sexual intercourse," even though intercourse need not have been
pleaded or proven under a cohabitation indictment, id., at

509us3117M 03-28-97 20:18:35 PAGES OPINPGT
752 UNITED STATES v. DIXON

Opinion of Souter, J.
187. (The second offense charged in both Morey and thecase before the Court in

Nielsen was adultery, which, of
course, did require an act of sexual intercourse.) But evenon the assumption that the continuous crime in

Morey necessarily did imply sexual intercourse, rendering the cases indistinguishable on their facts, the Nielsen Court indicatedthat it would not follow the holding in

Morey. To the Nielsen Court, it was "very clear that where, as in this case, aperson has been tried and convicted for a crime which has

various incidents included in it, he cannot be a second timetried for one of those incidents without being twice put in
jeopardy for the same offence." 131 U. S., at 188.By this last statement, the Court rejected, in a successive
prosecution case, the double jeopardy test set out in Morey,
which we later adopted in Blockburger; instead of agreeingwith

Morey that " `[t]he test is not, whether the defendant
has already been tried for the same act,' " the Court concluded that a defendant "cannot be a second time tried" for
a single act included as one of the "various incidents" of a
continuous crime for which he has already been convicted.5
131 U. S., at 188.

The Court then went on to address the contention that
adultery, as opposed to sexual intercourse, is not an act included in the continuing offense of cohabitation, because

5 Citing dictionary definitions, the majority claims that "incident," as
used in this passage, "obviously" means "element." Ante, at 705, n. 10.
This explanation does not make sense, for a defendant is not "tried for"
an "element"; a defendant may be "tried for" a crime, such as adultery,
that contains certain elements, or may be "tried for" certain acts. The
immediate context of this passage from Nielsen indicates that these latter
definitions of "incident" are intended. See, e. g., 131 U. S., at 188 (" `tried
for the same act' "). The point is nailed down by the Court's discussion
of intercourse as an "incident" of cohabitation, id., at 189, after having
indicated that intercourse need not be pleaded or proven under a cohabitation indictment, id., at 187; if "incident" did mean "element," pleading and
proof of intercourse would, of course, have been required. "Incident"
here clearly means "act."

753Cite as: 509 U. S. 688 (1993)
Opinion of Souter, J.
adultery requires proof that one of the parties is married,while cohabitation does not require such proof. Although

the Court agreed that adultery contains such an element,the Court found that this element was irrelevant under its
successive prosecution rule, because sexual intercourse is the
"essential and principal ingredient of adultery." Id., at 189.In other words, what may not be successively prosecuted is

the act constituting the "principal ingredient" of the secondoffense, if that act has already been the subject of the prior
prosecution. It is beside the point that the subsequent of-fense is defined to include, in addition to that act, some further element uncommon to the first offense (where the first
offense also includes an element not shared by the second).
Thus, as the Court states its holding, the cohabitation conviction "was a good bar" because "the material part of the
adultery charged [i. e., intercourse] was comprised within
the unlawful cohabitation of which the petitioner was already
convicted." Id., at 187 (emphasis supplied); see also ibid.
(sexual intercourse "was the integral part of the adultery
charged in the second indictment") (emphasis supplied).

One final aspect of the Nielsen opinion deserves attention.
After rejecting a Blockburger test for successive prosecutions, the Court then proceeded to discuss the familiar rule
that conviction of a greater offense bars subsequent prosecution for a lesser included offense. This discussion misleads
the majority into thinking that Nielsen does nothing more
than apply that familiar rule, which is, of course, a corollary
to the Blockburger test. See ante, at 705. But Nielsen's
discussion did not proceed on the ground that the Court believed adultery to be a lesser included offense of cohabitation
(and thus its later prosecution barred for that reason); on the
contrary, the Court had just finished explaining that marriage must be proven for adultery, but not for cohabitation,
which precluded finding adultery to be a lesser included offense of cohabitation. The discussion of the lesser included
offense rule is apposite for the different reason that once the

element of marriage was disregarded (as the Court had justdone, considering instead only adultery's "principal ingredient" of intercourse), the act of intercourse stood to cohab-itation as a lesser included offense stands to the greater
offense. By treating intercourse as though it were a lesserincluded offense,

Nielsen barred subsequent prosecution forthat act under an adultery charge. Indeed, on any other

reading we would have to conclude that the Nielsen Courtdid not know what it was doing, for if it had been holding
only that a subsequent prosecution for a lesser included of-fense was barred, the adultery prosecution would not have
been. There can be no question that the Court was adopt-ing the very different rule that subsequent prosecution is
barred for any charge comprising an act that has been thesubject of prior conviction.

Our modern cases reflect the concerns that resulted in
Nielsen's holding. We have already quoted the observationthat "[t]he Blockburger test is not the only standard for determining whether successive prosecutions impermissibly in-volve the same offense. Even if two offenses are sufficiently
different to permit the imposition of consecutive sentences,successive prosecutions will be barred in some circumstances
where the second prosecution requires the relitigation offactual issues already resolved by the first."

Brown v. Ohio,432 U. S., at 166-167, n. 6. The Brown Court, indeed, relied

on Nielsen for this proposition. "[I]n In re Nielsen, 131U. S. 176 (1889), the Court held that a conviction of a Mormon
on a charge of cohabiting with his two wives over a 21/2-yearperiod barred a subsequent prosecution for adultery with
one of them on the day following the end of that period . . . .[S]trict application of the Blockburger test would have per6 Our cases, of course, hold that the same protection inheres after an
acquittal. See North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U. S. 711, 717 (1969).

mitted imposition of consecutive sentences had the charges
been consolidated in a single proceeding. . . . [C]onviction
for adultery required proof that the defendant had sexual
intercourse with one woman while married to another; conviction for cohabitation required proof that the defendant
lived with more than one woman at the same time. Nonetheless, the Court . . . held the separate offenses to be the
`same.' " Ibid.

In the past 20 years the Court has addressed just this
problem of successive prosecution on three occasions. In
Harris v. Oklahoma, 433 U. S. 682 (1977) (per curiam), we
held that prosecution for a robbery with firearms was barred
by the Double Jeopardy Clause when the defendant had already been convicted of felony murder comprising the same
robbery with firearms as the underlying felony. Of course
the elements of the two offenses were different enough to
permit more than one punishment under the Blockburger
test: felony murder required the killing of a person by one
engaged in the commission of a felony, see 21 Okla. Stat., Tit.
21, $ 701 (1971); robbery with firearms required the use of
a firearm in the commission of a robbery, see $$ 801, 791.
Harris v. State, 555 P. 2d 76, 80 (Okla. Crim. App. 1976),
rev'd, 433 U. S. 682 (1977).

In Harris, however, we held that "[w]hen, as here, conviction of a greater crime, murder, cannot be had without conviction of the lesser crime, robbery with firearms, the Double
Jeopardy Clause bars prosecution for the lesser crime after
conviction of the greater one." We justified that conclusion
in the circumstances of the case by quoting Nielsen's explanation of the Blockburger test's insufficiency for determining when a successive prosecution was barred. " `[A]
person [who] has been tried and convicted for a crime
which has various incidents included in it . . . cannot be a
second time tried for one of those incidents without being
twice put in jeopardy for the same offence.' In re Nielsen,

Just as in Nielsen, the analysis in Harris turned on consid-ering the prior conviction in terms of the conduct actually

charged. While that process might be viewed as a misappli-cation of a

Blockburger lesser included offense analysis, thecrucial point is that the Blockburger elements test would

have produced a different result. The case thus follows theholding in Nielsen and conforms to the statement already
quoted from Brown, that the Blockburger test is not the ex-clusive standard for determining whether the rule against
successive prosecutions applies in a given case.Subsequently, in

Illinois v. Vitale, 447 U. S. 410 (1980), theCourt again indicated that a valid claim of double jeopardy

would not necessarily be defeated by the fact that the twooffenses are not the "same" under the Blockburger test. In
that case, we were confronted with a prosecution for failureto reduce speed and a subsequent prosecution for involuntary manslaughter. The opinion of the Illinois SupremeCourt below had not made it clear whether the elements of
failure to slow were always necessarily included within theelements of involuntary manslaughter by automobile, and we
remanded for clarification of this point, among other things.We held that "[i]f, as a matter of Illinois law, a careless failure to slow is always a necessary element of manslaughterby automobile, then the two offenses are the `same' under
Blockburger and Vitale's trial on the latter charge wouldconstitute double jeopardy . . . ." 447 U. S., at 419-420.
But that was not all. Writing for the Court, Justice
White went on to say that, "[i]n any event, it may be thatto sustain its manslaughter case the State may find it neces7 In Brown we recognized that "[a]n exception may exist where the
State is unable to proceed on the more serious charge at the outset because the additional facts necessary to sustain that charge have not occurred or have not been discovered despite the exercise of due diligence."
432 U. S., at 169, n. 7.

Opinion of Souter, J.
sary to prove a failure to slow or to rely on conduct necessar-ily involving such failure . . . . In that case, because Vitale

has already been convicted for conduct that is a necessaryelement of the more serious crime for which he has been
charged, his claim of double jeopardy would be substantialunder

Brown and our later decision in Harris v. Oklahoma,433 U. S. 682 (1977)." Id., at 420.

Over a decade ago, then, we clearly understood Harris tostand for the proposition that when one has already been
tried for a crime comprising certain conduct, a subsequentprosecution seeking to prove the same conduct is barred by
the Double Jeopardy Clause.8 This is in no way inconsistentwith

Vitale's description of Harris as "treat[ing] a killing in
the course of a robbery as itself a separate statutory offense,and the robbery as a species of lesser-included offense." 447

U. S., at 420. The very act of "treating" it that way was a
departure from straight Blockburger analysis; it was thesame departure taken by the

Nielsen Court. Vitale read
Harris (which itself quoted Nielsen) to hold that even if the
Blockburger test were satisfied, a second prosecution would
not be permitted for conduct comprising the criminal actcharged in the first.

Nielsen and Harris used the word "incident," while Vitale used the word "conduct," but no matterwhich word is used to describe the unlawful activity for

which one cannot again be forced to stand trial, the import
of this successive-prosecution strand of our double jeopardyjurisprudence is clear.

Even if this had not been clear since the time of In re
Nielsen, any debate should have been settled by our decision
three Terms ago in Grady v. Corbin, 495 U. S. 508 (1990),

8 It is true that in light of its decision to remand the case to provide the
State further opportunity to put forward some other basis for its prosecution, the Vitale Court, appropriately, described the claim only as "substantial." The important point, however, is the way in which the Court in
Vitale (and, for that matter, the dissent in that case, see 447 U. S., at 426
(opinion of Stevens, J.)) read the Harris opinion.

Opinion of Souter, J.
that "the Double Jeopardy Clause bars a subsequent prose-cution if, to establish an essential element of an offense

charged in that prosecution, the government will prove con-duct that constitutes an offense for which the defendant has
already been prosecuted." Id., at 510 (footnote omitted).
Grady did nothing more than apply a version of the Nielsen rule.

As against this sequence of consistent reasoning from
Nielsen to Grady, the Court's citation to two cases, Gavieres
v. United States, 220 U. S. 338, 343 (1911), and Burton v.
United States, 202 U. S. 344, 379-381 (1906), cannot validate
its insistence that, prior to Grady, our exclusive standard
for barring successive prosecutions under the Double Jeopardy Clause was the Blockburger test. See ante, at 707-708.
Burton came before the Court on a demurrer. The Court
there was not presented with the factual basis for the
charges, and simply held that two offenses, accepting a bribe
from a company and accepting the same bribe from an officer
of that company, were "not identical, in law." 202 U. S., at
381; see also id., at 379 ("[T]he question presented is
whether, upon the face of the record, as matter of law simply, the offense charged in the third and seventh counts of
the present indictment is the same as that charged in the
third count of the former indictment") (emphasis in original);
Abbate v. United States, 359 U. S. 187, 198, n. 2 (1959) (opinion of Brennan, J.). Rather than proving that the Blockburger same-elements test was always the Court's exclusive guide to evaluation of successive prosecutions prior to
Grady, Burton stands only for the proposition that a claim
of double jeopardy resting exclusively on pleadings cannot
be adjudicated on any basis except the elements pleaded.

Gavieres is in fact the only case that may even be read to
suggest that the Court ever treated a Blockburger analysis
as the exclusive successive prosecution test under the
Double Jeopardy Clause, and its precedential force is weak.
Gavieres was an interpretation not of the Constitution, but

759Cite as: 509 U. S. 688 (1993)

of an Act of Congress applicable to the Philippines, providingthat "no person for the same offense shall be twice put in

jeopardy of punishment." Act of July 1, 1902, ch. 1369, $ 5,32 Stat. 692. It is true that in his opinion for the Court in
Gavieres, Justice Day wrote that we had held in Kepner v.
United States, 195 U. S. 100 (1904), "that the protectionagainst double jeopardy therein provided had, by means of

this statute, been carried to the Philippine Islands in thesense and in the meaning which it had obtained under the
Constitution and laws of the United States." 220 U. S., at341. Nonetheless, this Court has declined to treat decisions
under that statute as authoritative constructions of the FifthAmendment. See

Green v. United States, 355 U. S., at 197,and n. 16; see also Abbate, supra, at 198, n. 2 (opinion of

Brennan, J.). VI

Burton and Gavieres thus lend no support for the Court'sdecision to overrule Grady and constrict Harris. Whatever
may have been the merits of the debate in Grady, the deci-sion deserves more respect than it receives from the Court

today. "Although adherence to precedent is not rigidly re-quired in constitutional cases, any departure from the doctrine of stare decisis demands special justification. See,
e. g., Swift & Co. v. Wickham, 382 U. S. 111, 116 (1965); Smithv. Allwright, 321 U. S. 649, 665 (1944)." Arizona v. Rumsey,

467 U. S. 203, 212 (1984).The search for any justification fails to reveal that Grady's
conclusion was either "unsound in principle," or "unwork-able in practice." Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan
Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528, 546 (1985). Grady's ruleis straightforward, and a departure from it is not justified by
the fact that two Court of Appeals decisions have describedit as difficult to apply, see

ante, at 711-712, n. 16, one appar-ently because it must be distinguished from the "same evidence" test, see Ladner v. Smith, 941 F. 2d 356, 363-364(CA5 1991). Nor does the fact that one of those courts has

509us3117M 03-28-97 20:18:35 PAGES OPINPGT
760 UNITED STATES v. DIXON

Opinion of Souter, J.
broken the single sentence of Grady's holding into its fourconstituent clauses before applying it, see Ladner, supra, reveal a type of " `confusion,' " ante, at 711 (citation omitted),that can somehow obviate our obligation to adhere to precedent. Cf. Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164,173-174 (1989).

Nor do Burton and Gavieres have the strength to justifythe Court's reading of

Harris solely for the narrow proposi-tion that, in a case where a statute refers to other offenses,

the elements of those offenses are incorporated by referencein the statute.

9 While reading the case this way might

suffice for purposes of avoiding multiple punishment, thisreading would work an unprecedented truncation of the

protection afforded by the Double Jeopardy Clause againstsuccessive prosecutions, by transferring the government's
leeway in determining how many offenses to create to theassessment of how many times a person may be prosecuted
for the same conduct. The Double Jeopardy Clause thenwould provide no more protection against successive prosecutions than it provides against multiple punishments, andinstead of expressing some principle underlying the protection against double jeopardy, Harris would be an anomaly,an "exceptio[n]" to

Blockburger without principled justifica-tion.
Grady, 495 U. S., at 528 (Scalia, J., dissenting). Byrelying on that anomaly and by defining its offenses with

care, the government could not merely add punishment to

9 Indeed, at least where the common elements of the offenses themselves
describe a separate criminal offense, the Court's reading of Harris v. Oklahoma, 433 U. S. 682 (1977), is apparently inconsistent even with the historical understanding of the Clause put forward by three of the dissenters in
Grady. See Grady v. Corbin, 495 U. S. 508, 531 (1990) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (quoting 1 T. Starkie, Criminal Pleading, ch. xix, pp. 322-323 (2d ed.
1822)) (" `[I]f one charge consist of the circumstances A. B. C. and another
of the circumstances A. D. E. then, if the circumstance which belongs to
them in common does not of itself constitute a distinct substantive offence, an acquittal from the one charge cannot include an acquittal of the
other' ") (emphasis supplied).

Opinion of Souter, J.
punishment (within Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment lim-its), but could bring a person to trial again and again for that

same conduct, violating the principle of finality, subjectinghim repeatedly to all the burdens of trial, rehearsing its
prosecution, and increasing the risk of erroneous conviction,
all in contravention of the principles behind the protectionfrom successive prosecutions included in the Fifth Amendment. The protection of the Double Jeopardy Clauseagainst successive prosecutions is not so fragile that it can
be avoided by finely drafted statutes and carefully plannedprosecutions.

VII
I would not invite any such consequences and would here
apply our successive prosecution decisions (from Nielsen to
Grady) to conclude that the prosecutions below were barred
by the Double Jeopardy Clause. Dixon was prosecuted
for violating a court order to "[r]efrain from committing
any criminal offense." App. 8. The contempt prosecution
proved beyond a reasonable doubt that he had possessed cocaine with intent to distribute it. His prosecution, therefore, for possession with intent to distribute cocaine based
on the same incident is barred. It is of course true that the
elements of the two offenses can be treated as different. In
the contempt conviction, the Government had to prove
knowledge of the court order as well as Dixon's commission
of some criminal offense. In the subsequent prosecution,
the Government would have to prove possession of cocaine
with intent to distribute. In any event, because the Government has already prosecuted Dixon for the possession of cocaine at issue here, Dixon cannot be tried for that incident a
second time.10

10 I agree, therefore, with Justice White that the element of knowledge of a court order is irrelevant for double jeopardy purposes. See
ante, at 734 (opinion concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in
part).

762 UNITED STATES v. DIXON

Opinion of Souter, J.
Foster was subject to a Civil Protection Order (CPO) notto "molest, assault, or in any manner threaten or physically

abuse" his wife, Ana Foster. App. 18. With respect to theperiod in which the CPO was in effect, Foster was alleged
to have violated it (in incidents relevant here) by (1) "grabbing [Ms. Foster] and thr[owing] her against a parked car,"on November 6, 1987, by threatening her on (2) November

12, 1987, (3) March 26, 1988, and (4) May 17, 1988, and by (5)throwing her down basement stairs, kicking her and hitting
her head against the floor until she lost consciousness, onMay 21, 1988. These incidents formed the basis for charging
Foster with contempt of court for violation of the CPO. Foster was found guilty of violating the court order by assaulting Ana Foster on November 6, 1987, and May 21, 1988. He
was found not guilty of the threats on November 12, 1987,
March 26, 1988, and May 17, 1988.

The Government then sought to prosecute Foster for these
same threats and assaults, charging him in a five-count indictment with violations of the D. C. Code. Count I charged
him with simple assault on November 6, 1987. Since he has
already been convicted of this assault, the second prosecution is barred. The Court agrees with this under its reading
of Harris, but would distinguish the other counts: Counts II,
III, and IV (based on the same threats alleged in the contempt proceeding) charging Foster with "threaten[ing] to injure the person of Ana Foster . . . , in violation of 22 D. C.
Code, Section 2307" (which prohibits threats to kidnap, to do
bodily injury, or to damage property); and Count V, charging
Foster with "assaul[t] . . . with intent to kill" as a result of
his actions on May 21, 1988. App. 43-44. The Court concludes that the later prosecutions are not barred, because in
its view the offenses charged in the indictment each contained an element not contained in the contempt charge (with
respect to the threats, that they be threats to kidnap, to
inflict bodily injury, or to damage property; with respect to
the assault, that it be undertaken with an intent to kill); and

Opinion of Souter, J.
because the contempt charge contained an element notspecified by the criminal code sections that formed the

basis for the indictment (violation of the CPO). See ante,at 700-703.

11

In each instance, however, the second prosecution isbarred under Nielsen, Harris as we construed it in Vitale,

and Grady. The conduct at issue constituted the conduct inthe contempts first charged as well as in the crimes subsequently prosecuted, and the Government's prosecution ofFoster twice for the conduct common to both would violate
the Double Jeopardy Clause.

VIII
Grady simply applied a rule with roots in our cases goingback well over 100 years.

Nielsen held that the DoubleJeopardy Clause bars successive prosecutions for more than

one statutory offense where the charges comprise the sameact, and Harris, as understood in Vitale, is properly read as
standing for the same rule. Overruling Grady alone cannotremove this principle from our constitutional jurisprudence.
Only by uprooting the entire sequence of cases, Grady, Vitale, Harris, and Nielsen, could this constitutional principlebe undone. Because I would not do that, I would affirm the

judgment of the Court of Appeals. I concur in the judgmentof the Court in Dixon and with respect to Count I in Foster,
but respectfully dissent from the disposition of the case withrespect to Counts II-V in Foster.

11 I note that at least the charge concerning assault with intent to kill
would apparently have been barred under the approach taken in Justice
Scalia's dissenting opinion in Grady. See n. 9, supra.

HARTFORD FIRE INSURANCE CO. et al.

v. CALIFORNIA et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 91-1111. Argued February 23, 1993--Decided June 28, 1993*
Nineteen States and many private plaintiffs filed complaints alleging that

the defendants--four domestic primary insurers, domestic companies
who sell reinsurance to insurers, two domestic trade associations, a domestic reinsurance broker, and reinsurers based in London--violated
the Sherman Act by engaging in various conspiracies aimed at forcing
certain other primary insurers to change the terms of their standard
domestic commercial general liability insurance policies to conform with
the policies the defendant insurers wanted to sell. After the actions
were consolidated for litigation, the District Court granted the defendants' motions to dismiss. The Court of Appeals reversed, rejecting the
District Court's conclusion that the defendants were entitled to antitrust
immunity under $ 2(b) of the McCarran-Ferguson Act, which exempts
from federal regulation "the business of insurance," except "to the
extent that such business is not regulated by State Law." Although it
held the conduct involved to be "the business of insurance," the Court
of Appeals ruled that the foreign reinsurers did not fall within $ 2(b)'s
protection because their activities could not be "regulated by State
Law," and that the domestic insurers had forfeited their $ 2(b) exemption when they conspired with the nonexempt foreign reinsurers. Furthermore, held the court, most of the conduct in question fell within

$ 3(b), which provides that nothing in the McCarran-Ferguson Act "shall
render the . . . Sherman Act inapplicable to any . . . act of boycott . . . ."
Finally, the court rejected the District Court's conclusion that the principle of international comity barred it from exercising Sherman Act
jurisdiction over the three claims brought solely against the London
reinsurers.

Held: The judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the cases

are remanded.

938 F. 2d 919, affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.

Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to
Parts I, II-A, III, and IV, concluding that:

*Together with No. 91-1128, Merrett Underwriting Agency Management Ltd. et al. v. California et al., also on certiorari to the same court.

Syllabus
1. The domestic defendants did not lose their $ 2(b) immunity by conspiring with the foreign defendants. The Court of Appeals's conclusion
to the contrary was based in part on the statement, in Group Life &
Health Ins. Co. v. Royal Drug Co., 440 U. S. 205, 231, that, "[i]n analogous contexts, the Court has held that an exempt entity forfeits antitrust exemption by acting in concert with nonexempt parties." Even
assuming that foreign reinsurers were "not regulated by State Law,"
the Court of Appeals's reasoning fails because the analogy drawn by the
Royal Drug Court was a loose one. Following that language, the
Royal Drug Court cited two cases dealing with the Capper-Volstead
Act, which immunizes certain "persons" from Sherman Act liability.
Ibid. Because, in contrast, the McCarran-Ferguson Act immunizes activities rather than entities, an entity-based analysis of $ 2(b) immunity
is inappropriate. See id., at 232-233. Moreover, the agreements at
issue in Royal Drug Co. were made with "parties wholly outside the
insurance industry," id., at 231, whereas the alleged agreements here
are with foreign reinsurers and admittedly concern "the business of
insurance." Pp. 781-784.

2. Even assuming that a court may decline to exercise Sherman Act
jurisdiction over foreign conduct in an appropriate case, international
comity would not counsel against exercising jurisdiction in the circumstances alleged here. The only substantial question in this litigation is
whether "there is in fact a true conflict between domestic and foreign
law." Socie'te' Nationale Industrielle Ae'rospatiale v. United States
Dist. Court for Southern Dist. of Iowa, 482 U. S. 522, 555 (Blackmun,
J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). That question must be
answered in the negative, since the London reinsurers do not argue that
British law requires them to act in some fashion prohibited by United
States law or claim that their compliance with the laws of both countries
is otherwise impossible. Pp. 794-799.

Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to
Part I, concluding that a "boycott" for purposes of $ 3(b) of the Act
occurs where, in order to coerce a target into certain terms on one
transaction, parties refuse to engage in other, unrelated transactions
with the target. It is not a "boycott" but rather a concerted agreement
to terms (a "cartelization") where parties refuse to engage in a particular transaction until the terms of that transaction are agreeable. Under
the foregoing test, the allegations of a "boycott" in this litigation,
construed most favorably to the respondents, are sufficient to sustain
most of the relevant counts of complaint against a motion to dismiss.

Opinion of the Court
munized from antitrust liability by the McCarran-FergusonAct, and that, even assuming it applies, the principle of international comity does not preclude District Court jurisdictionover the foreign conduct alleged.

I
The two petitions before us stem from consolidated litiga-tion comprising the complaints of 19 States and many private

plaintiffs alleging that the defendants, members of the insur-ance industry, conspired in violation of $ 1 of the Sherman
Act to restrict the terms of coverage of commercial generalliability (CGL) insurance

1 available in the United States. Because the cases come to us on motions to dismiss, we takethe allegations of the complaints as true.

2

A
According to the complaints, the object of the conspiracieswas to force certain primary insurers (insurers who sell insurance directly to consumers) to change the terms of their

1 CGL insurance provides "coverage for third party casualty damage
claims against a purchaser of insurance (the `insured')." App. 8 (Cal.
Complaint || 4.a).

2 Following the lower courts and the parties, see In re Insurance Antitrust Litigation, 938 F. 2d 919, 924, 925 (CA9 1991), we will treat the
complaint filed by California as representative of the claims of Alabama,
Arizona, California, Massachusetts, New York, West Virginia, and Wisconsin, and the complaint filed by Connecticut as representative of the claims
of Alaska, Colorado, Connecticut, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Washington. As will
become apparent, the California and Connecticut Complaints differ
slightly in their presentations of background information and their claims
for relief; their statements of facts are identical. Because the private
party plaintiffs have chosen in their brief in this Court to use the California Complaint as a "representative model" of their claims, Brief for Respondents (Private Party Plaintiffs) 3, n. 6, we will assume that their complaints track that complaint. On remand, the courts below will of course
be free to take into account any relevant differences among the complaints
that the parties may bring to their attention.

wanted four changes.3First, CGL insurance has traditionally been sold in the
United States on an "occurrence" basis, through a policy obli-gating the insurer "to pay or defend claims, whenever made,
resulting from an accident or `injurious exposure to conditions' that occurred during the [specific time] period the pol-icy was in effect." App. 22 (Cal. Complaint || 52). In place

of this traditional "occurrence" trigger of coverage, the de-fendants wanted a "claims-made" trigger, obligating the insurer to pay or defend only those claims made during thepolicy period. Such a policy has the distinct advantage for
the insurer that when the policy period ends without a claimhaving been made, the insurer can be certain that the policy
will not expose it to any further liability. Second, the defendants wanted the "claims-made" policy to have a "retroactive date" provision, which would further restrict coverage
to claims based on incidents that occurred after a certain
date. Such a provision eliminates the risk that an insurer,
by issuing a claims-made policy, would assume liability arising from incidents that occurred before the policy's effective
date, but remained undiscovered or caused no immediate
harm. Third, CGL insurance has traditionally covered
"sudden and accidental" pollution; the defendants wanted to
eliminate that coverage. Finally, CGL insurance has traditionally provided that the insurer would bear the legal costs
of defending covered claims against the insured without regard to the policy's stated limits of coverage; the defendants

(|||| 115-119), charges all the defendants with an overarching conspiracy to
force all four of these changes on the insurance market. The eight
federal-law Claims for Relief in the California Complaint, id., at 36-49
(|||| 111-150), charge various subgroups of the defendants with separate
conspiracies that had more limited objects; not all of the defendants are
alleged to have desired all four changes.

Opinion of the Court
wanted legal defense costs to be counted against the statedlimits (providing a "legal defense cost cap").

To understand how the defendants are alleged to havepressured the targeted primary insurers to make these
changes, one must be aware of two important features of the
insurance industry. First, most primary insurers rely oncertain outside support services for the type of insurance

coverage they wish to sell. Defendant Insurance ServicesOffice, Inc. (ISO), an association of approximately 1,400 domestic property and casualty insurers (including the primaryinsurer defendants, Hartford Fire Insurance Company, Allstate Insurance Company, CIGNA Corporation, and Aetna
Casualty and Surety Company), is the almost exclusive
source of support services in this country for CGL insurance.
See id., at 19 (Cal. Complaint || 38). ISO develops standard
policy forms and files or lodges them with each State's insurance regulators; most CGL insurance written in the United
States is written on these forms. Ibid. (Cal. Complaint
|| 39); id., at 74 (Conn. Complaint || 50). All of the "traditional" features of CGL insurance relevant to this litigation
were embodied in the ISO standard CGL insurance form that
had been in use since 1973 (1973 ISO CGL form). Id., at 22
(Cal. Complaint |||| 51-54); id., at 75 (Conn. Complaint |||| 56-
58). For each of its standard policy forms, ISO also supplies
actuarial and rating information: it collects, aggregates, interprets, and distributes data on the premiums charged,
claims filed and paid, and defense costs expended with respect to each form, id., at 19 (Cal. Complaint || 39); id., at 74
(Conn. Complaint |||| 51-52), and on the basis of these data it
predicts future loss trends and calculates advisory premium
rates, id., at 19 (Cal. Complaint || 39); id., at 74 (Conn. Complaint || 53). Most ISO members cannot afford to continue
to use a form if ISO withdraws these support services. See
id., at 32-33 (Cal. Complaint |||| 97, 99).

Second, primary insurers themselves usually purchase insurance to cover a portion of the risk they assume from the

Opinion of the Court
consumer. This so-called "reinsurance" may serve at leasttwo purposes, protecting the primary insurer from catastrophic loss, and allowing the primary insurer to sell moreinsurance than its own financial capacity might otherwise
permit. Id., at 17 (Cal. Complaint || 29). Thus, "[t]he avail-ability of reinsurance affects the ability and willingness of
primary insurers to provide insurance to their customers."
Id., at 18 (Cal. Complaint || 34); id., at 63 (Conn. Complaint|| 4(p)). Insurers who sell reinsurance themselves often purchase insurance to cover part of the risk they assume fromthe primary insurer; such "retrocessional reinsurance" does
for reinsurers what reinsurance does for primary insurers.See

ibid. (Conn. Complaint || 4(r)). Many of the defendantshere are reinsurers or reinsurance brokers, or play some

other specialized role in the reinsurance business; defendantReinsurance Association of America (RAA) is a trade association of domestic reinsurers.

B
The prehistory of events claimed to give rise to liabilitystarts in 1977, when ISO began the process of revising its

1973 CGL form. Id., at 22 (Cal. Complaint || 55). For thefirst time, it proposed two CGL forms (1984 ISO CGL forms),
one the traditional "occurrence" type, the other "with a new`claims-made' trigger." Id., at 22-23 (Cal. Complaint || 56).
The "claims-made" form did not have a retroactive date pro-vision, however, and both 1984 forms covered " `sudden and
accidental' pollution" damage and provided for unlimited cov-erage of legal defense costs by the insurer. Id., at 23 (Cal.
Complaint |||| 59-60). Within the ISO, defendant HartfordFire Insurance Company objected to the proposed 1984
forms; it desired elimination of the "occurrence" form, a ret-roactive date provision on the "claims-made" form, elimination of sudden and accidental pollution coverage, and a legaldefense cost cap. Defendant Allstate Insurance Company
also expressed its desire for a retroactive date provision on

Opinion of the Court
the "claims-made" form. Id., at 24 (Cal. Complaint || 61).Majorities in the relevant ISO committees, however, supported the proposed 1984 CGL forms and rejected thechanges proposed by Hartford and Allstate. In December
1983, the ISO Board of Directors approved the proposed 1984forms, and ISO filed or lodged the forms with state regulators in March 1984. Ibid. (Cal. Complaint || 62).Dissatisfied with this state of affairs, the defendants began
to take other steps to force a change in the terms of coverageof CGL insurance generally available, steps that, the plaintiffs allege, implemented a series of conspiracies in violationof $ 1 of the Sherman Act. The plaintiffs recount these steps
as a number of separate episodes corresponding to differentclaims for relief in their complaints;

4 because it will become

important to distinguish among these counts and the actsand defendants associated with them, we will note these

correspondences.The first four Claims for Relief in the California Complaint, id., at 36-43 (|||| 111-130), and the Second Claim forRelief in the Connecticut Complaint, id., at 90-92 (|||| 120-
124), charge the four domestic primary insurer defendantsand varying groups of domestic and foreign reinsurers, brokers, and associations with conspiracies to manipulate theISO CGL forms. In March 1984, primary insurer Hartford
persuaded General Reinsurance Corporation (General Re),the largest American reinsurer, to take steps either to procure desired changes in the ISO CGL forms, or "failing that,[to] `derail' the entire ISO CGL forms program."

Id., at 24(Cal. Complaint || 64). General Re took up the matter with

its trade association, RAA, which created a special commit-tee that met and agreed to "boycott" the 1984 ISO CGL
forms unless a retroactive-date provision was added to the

claims-made form, and a pollution exclusion and defense costcap were added to both forms.

Id., at 24-25 (Cal. Complaint
|||| 65-66). RAA then sent a letter to ISO "announc[ing]that its members would not provide reinsurance for coverages written on the 1984 CGL forms," id., at 25 (Cal. Complaint || 67), and Hartford and General Re enlisted a domesticreinsurance broker to give a speech to the ISO Board of Directors, in which he stated that no reinsurers would "breakranks" to reinsure the 1984 ISO CGL forms.

Ibid. (Cal.
Complaint || 68).The four primary insurer defendants (Hartford, Aetna,

CIGNA, and Allstate) also encouraged key actors in the London reinsurance market, an important provider of reinsurance for North American risks, to withhold reinsurance for
coverages written on the 1984 ISO CGL forms. Id., at
25-26 (Cal. Complaint |||| 69-70). As a consequence, many
London-based underwriters, syndicates, brokers, and reinsurance companies informed ISO of their intention to withhold reinsurance on the 1984 forms, id., at 26-27 (Cal. Complaint |||| 71-75), and at least some of them told ISO that they
would withhold reinsurance until ISO incorporated all four
desired changes, see supra, at 771, and n. 3, into the ISO
CGL forms. App. 26 (Cal. Complaint || 74).

For the first time ever, ISO invited representatives of the
domestic and foreign reinsurance markets to speak at an ISO
Executive Committee meeting. Id., at 27-28 (Cal. Complaint || 78). At that meeting, the reinsurers "presented
their agreed upon positions that there would be changes in
the CGL forms or no reinsurance." Id., at 29 (Cal. Complaint || 82). The ISO Executive Committee then voted to
include a retroactive-date provision in the claims-made form,
and to exclude all pollution coverage from both new forms.
(But it neither eliminated the occurrence form, nor added a
legal defense cost cap.) The 1984 ISO CGL forms were then
withdrawn from the marketplace, and replaced with forms
(1986 ISO CGL forms) containing the new provisions. Ibid.

Opinion of the Court
(Cal. Complaint || 84). After ISO got regulatory approval of
the 1986 forms in most States where approval was needed,
it eliminated its support services for the 1973 CGL form,
thus rendering it impossible for most ISO members to continue to use the form. Id., at 32-33 (Cal. Complaint |||| 97,
99).

The Fifth Claim for Relief in the California Complaint,
id., at 43-44 (|||| 131-135), and the virtually identical Third
Claim for Relief in the Connecticut Complaint, id., at 92-94
(|||| 125-129), charge a conspiracy among a group of London
reinsurers and brokers to coerce primary insurers in the
United States to offer CGL coverage only on a claims-made
basis. The reinsurers collectively refused to write new
reinsurance contracts for, or to renew longstanding contracts with, "primary . . . insurers unless they were prepared
to switch from the occurrence to the claims-made form," id.,
at 30 (Cal. Complaint || 88); they also amended their reinsurance contracts to cover only claims made before a " `sunset
date,' " thus eliminating reinsurance for claims made on occurrence policies after that date, id., at 31 (Cal. Complaint
|||| 90-92).

The Sixth Claim for Relief in the California Complaint, id.,
at 45-46 (|||| 136-140), and the nearly identical Fourth Claim
for Relief in the Connecticut Complaint, id., at 94-95
(|||| 130-134), charge another conspiracy among a somewhat
different group of London reinsurers to withhold reinsurance
for pollution coverage. The London reinsurers met and
agreed that all reinsurance contracts covering North American casualty risks, including CGL risks, would be written
with a complete exclusion for pollution liability coverage.
Id., at 32 (Cal. Complaint |||| 94-95). In accordance with this
agreement, the parties have in fact excluded pollution liability coverage from CGL reinsurance contracts since at least
late 1985. Ibid. (Cal. Complaint || 94).

reinsurers, and the ISO with conspiring to restrain trade inthe markets for "excess" and "umbrella" insurance by drafting model forms and policy language for these types of insur-ance, which are not normally offered on a regulated basis.
Id., at 33 (Cal. Complaint || 101). The ISO Executive Com-mittee eventually released standard language for both "occurrence" and "claims-made" umbrella and excess policies;that language included a retroactive date in the claims-made

Nineteen States and a number of private plaintiffs filed36 complaints against the insurers involved in this course of

events, charging that the conspiracies described above vio-lated $ 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U. S. C. $ 1. After the actions had been consolidated for litigation in the NorthernDistrict of California, the defendants moved to dismiss for
failure to state a cause of action, or, in the alternative, forsummary judgment. The District Court granted the motions to dismiss. In re Insurance Antitrust Litigation, 723F. Supp. 464 (1989). It held that the conduct alleged fell
within the grant of antitrust immunity contained in $ 2(b) ofthe McCarran-Ferguson Act, 15 U. S. C. $ 1012(b), because it
amounted to "the business of insurance" and was "regulatedby State Law" within the meaning of that section; none of
the conduct, in the District Court's view, amounted to a"boycott" within the meaning of the $ 3(b) exception to that
grant of immunity. 15 U. S. C. $ 1013(b). The DistrictCourt also dismissed the three claims that named only certain London-based defendants,7 invoking international com-ity and applying the Ninth Circuit's decision in

Opinion of the Court
not claim McCarran-Ferguson Act antitrust immunity for
two independent reasons. First, it held, the foreign reinsurers were beyond the regulatory jurisdiction of the States;
because their activities could not be "regulated by State
Law" within the meaning of $ 2(b), they did not fall within
that section's grant of immunity. Although the domestic insurers were "regulated by State Law," the court held, they
forfeited their $ 2(b) exemption when they conspired with the
nonexempt foreign reinsurers. Second, the Court of Appeals held that, even if the conduct alleged fell within the
scope of $ 2(b), it also fell within the $ 3(b) exception for
"act[s] of boycott, coercion, or intimidation." Finally, as to
the three claims brought solely against foreign defendants,
the court applied its Timberlane analysis, but concluded that
the principle of international comity was no bar to exercising
Sherman Act jurisdiction.

We granted certiorari in No. 91-1111 to address two narrow questions about the scope of McCarran-Ferguson Act
antitrust immunity,8 and in No. 91-1128 to address the application of the Sherman Act to the foreign conduct at issue.9
506 U. S. 814 (1992). We now affirm in part, reverse in part,
and remand.

8 We limited our grant of certiorari in No. 91-1111 to these questions:
"1. Whether domestic insurance companies whose conduct otherwise
would be exempt from the federal antitrust laws under the McCarranFerguson Act lose that exemption because they participate with foreign
reinsurers in the business of insurance," and "2. Whether agreements
among primary insurers and reinsurers on such matters as standardized
advisory insurance policy forms and terms of insurance coverage constitute a `boycott' outside the exemption of the McCarran-Ferguson Act."

9 The question presented in No. 91-1128 is: "Did the court of appeals

properly assess the extraterritorial reach of the U. S. antitrust laws in
light of this Court's teachings and contemporary understanding of international law when it held that a U. S. district court may apply U. S. law to
the conduct of a foreign insurance market regulated abroad?" Pet. for

Opinion of the Court

II
The petition in No. 91-1111 touches on the interaction oftwo important pieces of economic legislation. The Sherman

Act declares "[e]very contract, combination in the form oftrust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or
commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations,. . . to be illegal." 15 U. S. C. $ 1. The McCarran-Ferguson
Act provides that regulation of the insurance industry isgenerally a matter for the States, 15 U. S. C. $ 1012(a),
and (again, generally) that "[n]o Act of Congress shall beconstrued to invalidate, impair, or supersede any law enacted by any State for the purpose of regulating the busi-ness of insurance," $ 1012(b). Section 2(b) of the McCarranFerguson Act makes it clear nonetheless that the ShermanAct applies "to the business of insurance to the extent that
such business is not regulated by State Law," $ 1012(b), and$ 3(b) provides that nothing in the McCarran-Ferguson Act
"shall render the . . . Sherman Act inapplicable to any agree-ment to boycott, coerce, or intimidate, or act of boycott, coercion, or intimidation," $ 1013(b).Petitioners in No. 91-1111 are all of the domestic defendants in the consolidated cases: the four domestic primary in-surers, the domestic reinsurers, the trade associations ISO
and RAA, and the domestic reinsurance broker Thomas A.Greene & Company, Inc. They argue that the Court of Appeals erred in holding, first, that their conduct, otherwiseimmune from antitrust liability under $ 2(b) of the McCarranFerguson Act, lost its immunity when they conspired withthe foreign defendants, and, second, that their conduct
amounted to "act[s] of boycott" falling within the exceptionto antitrust immunity set out in $ 3(b). We conclude that
the Court of Appeals did err about the effect of conspiringwith foreign defendants, but correctly decided that all but
one of the complaints' relevant Claims for Relief are fairlyread to allege conduct falling within the "boycott" exception
to McCarran-Ferguson Act antitrust immunity. We there509us3u118 03-27-97 18:33:09 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
fore affirm the Court of Appeals's judgment that it was errorfor the District Court to dismiss the complaints on grounds

of McCarran-Ferguson Act immunity, except as to the oneclaim for relief that the Court of Appeals correctly found to
allege no boycott. A

By its terms, the antitrust exemption of $ 2(b) of theMcCarran-Ferguson Act applies to "the business of insurance" to the extent that such business is regulated by statelaw. While "business" may mean "[a] commercial or industrial establishment or enterprise," Webster's New Interna-tional Dictionary 362 (2d ed. 1942), the definite article before
"business" in $ 2(b) shows that the word is not used in thatsense, the phrase "the business of insurance" obviously not
being meant to refer to a single entity. Rather, "business"as used in $ 2(b) is most naturally read to refer to "[m]ercantile transactions; buying and selling; [and] traffic." Ibid.The cases confirm that "the business of insurance" should
be read to single out one activity from others, not to distin-guish one entity from another. In Group Life & Health Ins.
Co. v. Royal Drug Co., 440 U. S. 205 (1979), for example, weheld that $ 2(b) did not exempt an insurance company from
antitrust liability for making an agreement fixing the priceof prescription drugs to be sold to Blue Shield policyholders.
Such activity, we said, "would be exempt from the anti-trust laws if Congress had extended the coverage of the
McCarran-Ferguson Act to the `business of insurance compa-nies.' But that is precisely what Congress did not do."

Id.,at 233 (footnote omitted); see SEC v. National Securities,

Inc., 393 U. S. 453, 459 (1969) (the McCarran-Ferguson Act's"language refers not to the persons or companies who are
subject to state regulation, but to laws `regulating the business of insurance' ") (emphasis in original). And in UnionLabor Life Ins. Co. v. Pireno, 458 U. S. 119 (1982), we explicitly framed the question as whether "a particular practice ispart of the `business of insurance' exempted from the anti509us3u118 03-27-97 18:33:09 PAGES OPINPGT
782 HARTFORD FIRE INS. CO. v. CALIFORNIA

Opinion of the Court
trust laws by $ 2(b)," id., at 129 (emphasis added), and each
of the three criteria we identified concerned a quality of the
practice in question: "first, whether the practice has the effect of transferring or spreading a policyholder's risk; second, whether the practice is an integral part of the policy
relationship between the insurer and the insured; and third,
whether the practice is limited to entities within the insurance industry," ibid. (emphasis in original).

The Court of Appeals did not hold that, under these criteria, the domestic defendants' conduct fell outside "the business of insurance"; to the contrary, it held that that condition
was met.10 See 938 F. 2d, at 927. Nor did it hold the domestic defendants' conduct to be "[un]regulated by State
Law." Rather, it constructed an altogether different chain
of reasoning, the middle link of which comes from a sentence
in our opinion in Royal Drug Co. "[R]egulation . . . of foreign reinsurers," the Court of Appeals explained, "is beyond
the jurisdiction of the states," 938 F. 2d, at 928, and hence

$ 2(b) does not exempt foreign reinsurers from antitrust liability, because their activities are not "regulated by State
Law." Under Royal Drug Co., "an exempt entity forfeits
antitrust exemption by acting in concert with nonexempt
parties." 440 U. S., at 231. Therefore, the domestic insurers, by acting in concert with the nonexempt foreign insurers, lost their McCarran-Ferguson Act antitrust immunity.
See 938 F. 2d, at 928. This reasoning fails, however, because
even if we were to agree that foreign reinsurers were not
subject to state regulation (a point on which we express
no opinion), the quoted language from Royal Drug Co., read

10 The activities in question here, of course, are alleged to violate federal
law, and it might be tempting to think that unlawful acts are implicitly
excluded from "the business of insurance." Yet $ 2(b)'s grant of immunity
assumes that acts which, but for that grant, would violate the Sherman
Act, the Clayton Act, or the Federal Trade Commission Act, are part of
"the business of insurance."

in context, does not state a proposition applicable to this
litigation.

The full sentence from Royal Drug Co. places the quoted
fragment in a different light. "In analogous contexts," we
stated, "the Court has held that an exempt entity forfeits
antitrust exemption by acting in concert with nonexempt
parties." 440 U. S., at 231. We then cited two cases dealing with the Capper-Volstead Act, which immunizes from
liability under $ 1 of the Sherman Act particular activities
of certain persons "engaged in the production of agricultural products." 11 Capper-Volstead Act, $ 1, 42 Stat. 388, 7
U. S. C. $ 291; see Case-Swayne Co. v. Sunkist Growers, Inc.,
389 U. S. 384 (1967); United States v. Borden Co., 308 U. S.
188 (1939). Because these cases relied on statutory language referring to certain "persons," whereas we specifically acknowledged in Royal Drug Co. that the McCarranFerguson Act immunizes activities rather than entities, see
440 U. S., at 232-233, the analogy we were drawing was of
course a loose one. The agreements that insurance companies made with "parties wholly outside the insurance industry," id., at 231, we noted, such as the retail pharmacists
involved in Royal Drug Co. itself, or "automobile body repair
shops or landlords," id., at 232 (footnote omitted), are un11 We also cited two cases dealing with the immunity of certain agreements of labor unions under the Clayton and Norris-LaGuardia Acts. See
440 U. S., at 231-232. These cases, however, did not hold that labor
unions lose their immunity whenever they enter into agreements with
employers; to the contrary, we acknowledged in one of the cases that "the
law contemplates agreements on wages not only between individual employers and a union but agreements between the union and employers in
a multi-employer bargaining unit." Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381
U. S. 657, 664 (1965). Because the cases stand only for the proposition
that labor unions are not immune from antitrust liability for certain types
of agreements with employers, such as agreements "to impose a certain
wage scale on other bargaining units," id., at 665, they do not support the
far more general statement that exempt entities lose immunity by conspiring with nonexempt entities.

likely to be about anything that could be called "the businessof insurance," as distinct from the broader " `business of insurance companies,' " id., at 233. The alleged agreementsat issue in the instant litigation, of course, are entirely different; the foreign reinsurers are hardly "wholly outside theinsurance industry," and respondents do not contest the
Court of Appeals's holding that the agreements concern "thebusiness of insurance." These facts neither support even
the rough analogy we drew in Royal Drug Co. nor fall withinthe rule about acting in concert with nonexempt parties,
which derived from a statute inapplicable here. Thus, wethink it was error for the Court of Appeals to hold the domestic insurers bereft of their McCarran-Ferguson Act ex-emption simply because they agreed or acted with foreign
reinsurers that, we assume for the sake of argument, were"not regulated by State Law."

is not enough reason to reinstate the District Court's dis-missal order, for the Court of Appeals reversed that order
on two independent grounds. Even if the participation offoreign reinsurers did not affect the $ 2(b) exemption, the
Court of Appeals held, the agreements and acts alleged bythe plaintiffs constitute "agreement[s] to boycott" and "act[s]
of boycott [and] coercion" within the meaning of $ 3(b) of theMcCarran-Ferguson Act, which makes it clear that the Sherman Act applies to such agreements and acts regardless ofthe $ 2(b) exemption. See 938 F. 2d, at 928. I agree with

12 The Court of Appeals's assumption that "the American reinsurers . . .
are subject to regulation by the states and therefore prima facie immune,"
938 F. 2d, at 928, appears to rest on the entity-based analysis we have
rejected. As with the foreign reinsurers, we express no opinion whether
the activities of the domestic reinsurers were "regulated by State Law"
and leave that question to the Court of Appeals on remand.

the Court that, construed in favor of the plaintiffs, the First,Second, Third, and Fourth Claims for Relief in the California

Complaint, and the First and Second Claims for Relief in theConnecticut Complaint, allege one or more $ 3(b) "act[s] of
boycott," and are thus sufficient to survive a motion to dis-miss. See

infra, at 789-790; post, at 811.In reviewing the motions to dismiss, however, the Court

has decided to use what I believe to be an overly narrowdefinition of the term "boycott" as used in $ 3(b), confining it
to those refusals to deal that are "unrelated" or "collateral"to the objective sought by those refusing to deal. Post, at
803. I do not believe that the McCarran-Ferguson Act orour precedents warrant such a cramped reading of the term.

The majority and I find common ground in four proposi-tions concerning $ 3(b) boycotts, as established in our decisions in St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Barry, 438 U. S.531 (1978), and

United States v. South-Eastern UnderwritersAssn., 322 U. S. 533 (1944). First, as we noted in St. Paul,

our only prior decision construing "boycott" as it appears in$ 3(b), only those refusals to deal involving the coordinated
action of multiple actors constitute $ 3(b) boycotts: "conductby individual actors falling short of concerted activity is simply not a `boycott' within [the meaning of] $ 3(b)." 438 U. S.,at 555; see

post, at 800 (" `boycott' " used "to describe . . .collective action"); post, at 801 ("To `boycott' means `[t]o

combine in refusing to hold relations' " (citation omitted)).Second, a $ 3(b) boycott need not involve an absolute refusal to deal.13 A primary goal of the alleged conspiratorsin South-Eastern Underwriters, as we described it, was "to

force nonmember insurance companies into the conspira-cies."

14 322 U. S., at 535; cf. Joint Hearing on S. 1362, H. R.

3269, and H. R. 3270 before the Subcommittees of the SenateCommittee on the Judiciary, 78th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 2,

p. 335 (1943) (statement of Edward L. Williams, President,Insurance Executives Association) ("[T]he companies that
want to come into the Interstate Underwriters Board cancome in there. I do not know of any company that is turned
down"). Thus, presumably, the refusals to deal orchestratedby the defendants would cease if the targets agreed to join the
association and abide by its terms. See post, at 801 ("Therefusal to deal may . . . be conditional" (emphasis omitted)).

Third, contrary to petitioners' contentions, see Brief forPetitioners in No. 91-1111, pp. 32, n. 14, 34, 38-39, a $ 3(b)
boycott need not entail unequal treatment of the targets ofthe boycott and its instigators. Some refusals to deal (those,
perhaps, which are alleged to violate only $ 2 of the ShermanAct

15) may have as their object the complete destruction of

the business of competitors; these may well involve uncon-ditional discrimination against the targets. Other refusals

to deal, however, may seek simply to prevent competition asto the price or features of the product sold; and these need
not depend on unequal treatment of the targets. Assuming,
holding in South-Eastern Underwriters that the business of insurance was
interstate commerce and thus subject generally to federal regulation
under the Commerce Clause, and to scrutiny under the Sherman Act specifically. Congress responded, both to "ensure that the States would continue to have the ability to tax and regulate the business of insurance,"
Royal Drug Co., 440 U. S., at 217-218 (footnote omitted), and to limit the
application of the antitrust laws to the insurance industry, id., at 218. In
drafting the $ 3(b) exception to the $ 2(b) grant of antitrust immunity, Congress borrowed language from our description of the indictment in SouthEastern Underwriters as charging that "[t]he conspirators not only fixed
premium rates and agents' commissions, but employed boycotts together
with other types of coercion and intimidation to force nonmember insurance companies into the conspiracies." 322 U. S., at 535.

15 Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 26 Stat. 209, as amended, 15 U. S. C. $ 2,

prohibits monopolization of, or attempts or conspiracies to monopolize,
"any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with
foreign nations."

Souter, J., concurring in judgment
as the South-Eastern Underwriters Court appears to havedone, that membership in the defendant association was open

to all insurers, the association is most readily seen as havingintended to treat all insurers equally: they all had the choice
either to join the association and abide by its rules, or to be
subjected to the "boycotts," and acts of coercion and intimi-dation, alleged in that case. See

post, at 808 (describing
South-Eastern Underwriters as involving a "boycott, byprimary insurers, of competitors who refused to join their

price-fixing conspiracy").Fourth, although a necessary element, "concerted activity"
is not, by itself, sufficient for a finding of "boycott" under

$ 3(b). Were this the case, we recognized in Barry, $ 3(b)
might well " `devour the broad antitrust immunity bestowed
by $ 2(b),' " 438 U. S., at 545, n. 18 (quoting id., at 559 (Stewart, J., dissenting)), since every "contract, combination in the
form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade
or commerce," 15 U. S. C. $ 1, involves "concerted activity."
Thus, we suggested, simple price fixing has been treated
neither as a boycott nor as coercion "in the absence of any
additional enforcement activity." 438 U. S., at 545, n. 18; see
post, at 804 (contending that simple concerted agreements on
contract terms are not properly characterized as boycotts).

Contrary to the majority's view, however, our decisions
have suggested that "enforcement activity" is a multifarious
concept. The South-Eastern Underwriters Court, which
coined the phrase "boycotts[,] . . . coercion and intimidation,"
322 U. S., at 535; see n. 14, supra, provides us with a list
of actions that, it finds, are encompassed by these terms.
"Companies not members of [the association]," it states,
"were cut off from the opportunity to reinsure their risks,
and their services and facilities were disparaged; independent sales agencies who defiantly represented non[association] companies were punished by a withdrawal of
the right to represent the members of [the association];
and persons needing insurance who purchased from non509us3u118 03-27-97 18:33:09 PAGES OPINPGT
788 HARTFORD FIRE INS. CO. v. CALIFORNIA

Souter, J., concurring in judgment
[association] companies were threatened with boycotts andwithdrawal of all patronage." 322 U. S., at 535-536. Faced

with such a list, and with all of the other instances in whichwe have used the term "boycott," we rightly came to the
conclusion in Barry that, as used in our cases, the term does
not refer to a " `unitary phenomenon.' " 438 U. S., at 543(quoting P. Areeda, Antitrust Analysis 381 (2d ed. 1974)).

The question in this litigation is whether the alleged activ-ities of the domestic defendants, acting together with the
foreign defendants who are not petitioners here, include "en-forcement activities" that would raise the claimed attempts
to fix terms to the level of $ 3(b) boycotts. I believe they
do. The core of the plaintiffs' allegations against the domestic defendants concern those activities that form the basis of
the First, Second, Third, and Fourth Claims for Relief in the
California Complaint, and the Second Claim for Relief in
the Connecticut Complaint: the conspiracies involving both
the primary insurers and domestic and foreign brokers and reinsurers to force changes in the ISO CGL forms. According
to the complaints, primary insurer defendants Hartford and
Allstate first tried to convince other members of the ISO that
the ISO CGL forms should be changed to limit coverage in the
manner we have detailed above, see supra, at 773-774;
but they failed to persuade a majority of members of the
relevant ISO committees, and the changes were not made.
Unable to persuade other primary insurers to agree voluntarily to their terms, Hartford and Allstate, joined by Aetna
and CIGNA, sought the aid of other individuals and entities
who were not members of ISO, and who would not ordinarily
be parties to an agreement setting the terms of primary insurance, not being in the business of selling it. The four
primary insurers convinced these individuals and entities,
the reinsurers, to put pressure on ISO and its members
by refusing to reinsure coverages written on the ISO CGL
forms until the desired changes were made. Both domestic
and foreign reinsurers, acting at the behest of the four pri509us3u118 03-27-97 18:33:09 PAGES OPINPGT

789Cite as: 509 U. S. 764 (1993)
Souter, J., concurring in judgment
mary insurers, announced that they would not reinsureunder the ISO CGL forms until changes were made. As an

immediate result of this pressure, ISO decided to include aretroactive-date provision in its claims-made form, and to exclude all pollution coverage from both its claims-made andoccurrence forms. In sum, the four primary insurers solicited refusals to deal from outside the primary insurance in-dustry as a means of forcing their fellow primary insurers to
agree to their terms; the outsiders, acting at the behest ofthe four, in fact refused to deal with primary insurers until
they capitulated, which, in part at least, they did.This pattern of activity bears a striking resemblance to
the first act of boycott listed by the South-Eastern Under-writers Court; although neither the South-Eastern Underwriters opinion, nor the underlying indictment, see Tran-script of Record, O. T. 1943, No. 354, p. 11 (|| 22(e)), details
exactly how the defendants managed to "cut off [nonmem-bers] from the opportunity to reinsure their risks," 322 U. S.,
at 535, the defendants could have done so by prompting rein-surance companies to refuse to deal with nonmembers, just
as is alleged here.16 Moreover, the activity falls squarely

16 The majority claims that this refusal to deal was a boycott only because "membership in the association [had] no discernible bearing upon
the terms of the refused reinsurance contracts." Post, at 809. Testimony at the hearings on the bill that became the McCarran-Ferguson Act
indicates that the insurance companies thought otherwise. "We say `You
do not issue insurance to a company that does not do business the way we
think it should be done and belong to our association.' . . . It is for the
protection of the public, the stockholders, and the companies. . . . You know
when those large risks are taken that they have to be reinsured. We do
not want to have to take a risk that is bad, or at an improper rate, or an
excessive commission, we do not want our agents to take that, nor do we
want to reinsure part of the risk that is written that way. We feel this
way--that some groups are doing business in what is not the proper way,
we feel it is not in the interest of the companies and it is not in the interest
of the public, and we just do not want to do business with them." Joint

within even the narrow theory of the $ 3(b) exception JusticeStewart advanced in dissent in Barry. Under that theory,

17

the $ 3(b) exception should be limited to "attempts by mem-bers of the insurance business to force other members to

follow the industry's private rules and practices." 438 U. S.,at 565. I can think of no better description of the four
primary insurers' activities in this litigation. For thesereasons, I agree with the Court's ultimate conclusion that
the Court of Appeals was correct in reversing the DistrictCourt's dismissal of the First, Second, Third, and Fourth
Claims for Relief in the California Complaint, and the SecondClaim for Relief in the Connecticut Complaint.

p. 333 (1943) (statement of Edward L. Williams, President, Insurance Executives Association).

17 In passing the McCarran-Ferguson Act, Justice Stewart argued, "Congress plainly wanted to allow the States to authorize anticompetitive practices which they determined to be in the public interest." St. Paul Fire &
Marine Ins. Co. v. Barry, 438 U. S. 531, 565 (1978) (dissenting opinion).
Hence, $ 2(b) provides that the federal antitrust laws will generally not be
applicable to those insurance business practices "regulated by State law,"
and presumably state law could, for example, either mandate price fixing,
or specifically authorize voluntary price-fixing agreements. On the other
hand, Congress intended to delegate regulatory power only to the States;
nothing in the McCarran-Ferguson Act suggests that Congress wanted
one insurer, or a group of insurers, to be able to formulate and enforce
policy for other insurers. Thus, the enforcement activities that distinguish $ 3(b) "boycotts" from other concerted activity include, in this context, "private enforcement . . . of industry rules and practices, even if
those rules and practices are permitted by state law." Id., at 565-566
(emphasis in original) (footnote omitted).

18 The First and Sixth Claims for Relief in the Connecticut Complaint,

and the Seventh Claim for Relief in the California Complaint, which also
name some or all of the petitioners, present special cases. The First
Claim for Relief in the Connecticut Complaint alleges an overarching conspiracy involving all of the defendants named in the complaint and all of
the conduct alleged. As such, it encompasses "boycott" activity, and the
Court of Appeals was correct to reverse the District Court's order dismissing it. As currently described in the complaint's statement of facts, however, some of the actions of the reinsurers and the retrocessional reinsurers appear to have been taken independently, rather than at the behest

Souter, J., concurring in judgment
The majority concludes that, so long as the reinsurers' role
in this course of action was limited to "a concerted agreement to seek particular terms in particular transactions,"
post, at 801-802, the course of action could never constitute
a $ 3(b) boycott. The majority's emphasis on this conclusion
assumes an artificial segmentation of the course of action,
and a false perception of the unimportance of the elements
of that course of action other than the reinsurers' agreement.
The majority concedes that the complaints allege, not just
implementation of a horizontal agreement, but refusals to
deal that occurred "at the behest of," or were "solicited by,"
the four primary insurers, who were "competitors of the tarof the primary insurer defendants. I express no opinion as to whether
those acts, if they were indeed taken independently, could amount to $ 3(b)
boycotts; but I note that they lack the key element on which I rely in this
litigation to find a sufficient allegation of boycott.

The Seventh Claim for Relief in the California Complaint, and the virtually identical Sixth Claim for Relief in the Connecticut Complaint, allege
a conspiracy among a group of domestic primary insurers, foreign reinsurers, and the ISO to draft restrictive model forms and policy language
for "umbrella" and "excess" insurance. On these claims, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court's order of dismissal as to the domestic
defendants solely because those defendants "act[ed] in concert" with nonexempt foreign defendants, 938 F. 2d, at 931, relying on reasoning that the
Court has found to be in error, see supra, at 781-784. The Court of Appeals found that "[n]o boycotts [were] alleged as the defendants' modus
operandi in respect to [excess and umbrella] insurance." 938 F. 2d, at 930.
I agree; even under a liberal construction of the complaints in favor of
plaintiffs, I can find no allegation of any refusal to deal in connection with
the drafting of the excess and umbrella insurance language. Therefore
I conclude that neither the participation of unregulated parties nor the
application of $ 3(b) furnished a basis to reverse the District Court's dismissal of these claims as against the domestic insurers, and I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals in this respect. The Fifth,
Sixth, and Eighth Claims for Relief in the California Complaint and the
Third, Fourth, and Fifth Claims for Relief in the Connecticut Complaint
also allege concerted refusals to deal; but because they do not name any
of the petitioners in No. 91-1111, the Court has no occasion to consider
whether they allege $ 3(b) boycotts.

get[s]." Post, at 808 (citations and internal quotation marks
omitted). But it fails to acknowledge several crucial features of these events that bind them into a single course of
action recognizable as a $ 3(b) boycott.

First, the allegation that the reinsurers acted at the behest
of the four primary insurers excludes the possibility that the
reinsurers acted entirely in their own independent selfinterest, and would have taken exactly the same course of
action without the intense efforts of the four primary insurers. Although the majority never explicitly posits such autonomy on the part of the reinsurers, this would seem to be
the only point of its repeated emphasis on the fact that "the
scope and predictability of the risks assumed in a reinsurance contract depend entirely upon the terms of the primary
policies that are reinsured." Ibid. If the encouragement of
the four primary insurers played no role in the reinsurers'
decision to act as they did, then it is difficult to see how one
could describe the reinsurers as acting at the behest of the
primary insurers, an element I find crucial to the $ 3(b) boycott alleged here. From the vantage point of a ruling on
motions to dismiss, however, I discern sufficient allegations
in the complaints that this is not the case. In addition, according to the complaints, the four primary insurers were
not acting out of concern for the reinsurers' financial health
when they prompted the reinsurers to refuse reinsurance for
certain risks; rather, they simply wanted to ensure that no
other primary insurer would be able to sell insurance policies
that they did not want to sell. Finally, as the complaints
portray the business of insurance, reinsurance is a separate,
specialized product, "[t]he availability [of which] affects the
ability and willingness of primary insurers to provide insurance to their customers." App. 18 (Cal. Complaint || 34).
Thus, contrary to the majority's assertion, the boundary between the primary insurance industry and the reinsurance
industry is not merely "technica[l]." Post, at 808.

Souter, J., concurring in judgment
The majority insists that I "disregar[d] th[e] integral rela-tionship between the terms of the primary insurance form

and the contract of reinsurance," post, at 807, a fact which itseems to believe makes it impossible to draw any distinction
whatsoever between primary insurers and reinsurers. Yet
it is the majority that fails to see that, in spite of such an"integral relationship," the interests of primary insurer and

reinsurer will almost certainly differ in some cases. For ex-ample, the complaints allege that reinsurance contracts often
"layer" risks, "in the sense that [a] reinsurer may have torespond only to claims above a certain amount . . . ." App.
10 (Cal. Complaint || 4.q); id., at 61 (Conn. Complaint || 4(f)).
Thus, a primary insurer might be much more concerned than
its reinsurer about a risk that resulted in a high number of
relatively small claims. Or the primary insurer might simply perceive a particular risk differently from the reinsurer.
The reinsurer might be indifferent as to whether a particular
risk was covered, so long as the reinsurance premiums were
adjusted to its satisfaction, whereas the primary insurer
might decide that the risk was "too hot to handle," on a
standardized basis, at any cost. The majority's suggestion
that "to insist upon certain primary-insurance terms as a
condition of writing reinsurance is in no way `artificial,' "
post, at 808; see post, at 806, simply ignores these possibilities; the conditions could quite easily be "artificial," in the
sense that they are not motivated by the interests of the reinsurers themselves. Because the parties have had no chance
to flesh out the facts of this case, because I have no a priori
knowledge of those facts, and because I do not believe I can
locate them in the pages of insurance treatises, I would not
rule out these possibilities on a motion to dismiss.

Believing that there is no other principled way to narrow
the $ 3(b) exception, the majority decides that "boycott" encompasses just those refusals to deal that are "unrelated" or
"collateral" to the objective sought by those refusing to deal.
Post, at 803. This designation of a single " `unitary phenom509us3u118 03-27-97 18:33:09 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
enon,' " Barry, 438 U. S., at 543, to which the term "boycott"will henceforth be confined, is of course at odds with our own

description of our Sherman Act cases in Barry.19 See ibid.Moreover, the limitation to "collateral" refusals to deal
threatens to shrink the $ 3(b) exception far more than themajority is willing to admit. Even if the reinsurers refused
all reinsurance to primary insurers "who wrote insurance ondisfavored forms," including insurance "as to risks written
on other forms," the majority states, the reinsurers wouldnot be engaging in a $ 3(b) boycott if "the primary insurers'
other business were relevant to the proposed insurance con-tract (for example, if the reinsurer bears greater risk where
the primary insurer engages in riskier businesses)." Post,at 810 (emphasis deleted). Under this standard, and under
facts comparable to those in this litigation, I assume thatreinsurers who refuse to deal at all with a primary insurer
unless it ceases insuring a particular risk would not be en-gaging in a $ 3(b) boycott if they could show that (1) insuring
the risk in question increases the probability that the pri-mary insurer will become insolvent, and that (2) it costs more
to administer the reinsurance contracts of a bankrupt pri-mary insurer (including those unrelated to the risk that
caused the primary insurer to declare bankruptcy). Onecan only imagine the variety of similar arguments that may
slowly plug what remains of the $ 3(b) exception. For thesereasons, I cannot agree with the majority's narrow theory of

$ 3(b) boycotts. III

Finally, we take up the question presented by No. 91-1128,whether certain claims against the London reinsurers should
have been dismissed as improper applications of the Sher19 The majority contends that its concept of boycott is still "multifaceted"
because it can be modified by such adjectives as "punitive," "labor," "political," and "social." Post, at 804, n. 3. This does not hide the fact that it

man Act to foreign conduct. The Fifth Claim for Relief inthe California Complaint alleges a violation of $ 1 of the

Sherman Act by certain London reinsurers who conspired tocoerce primary insurers in the United States to offer CGL
coverage on a claims-made basis, thereby making "occur-rence CGL coverage . . . unavailable in the State of California
for many risks." App. 43-44 (|||| 131-135). The SixthClaim for Relief in the California Complaint alleges that the
London reinsurers violated $ 1 by a conspiracy to limit cover-age of pollution risks in North America, thereby rendering
"pollution liability coverage . . . almost entirely unavailablefor the vast majority of casualty insurance purchasers in
the State of California." Id., at 45-46 (|||| 136-140). TheEighth Claim for Relief in the California Complaint alleges
a further $ 1 violation by the London reinsurers who, alongwith domestic retrocessional reinsurers, conspired to limit
coverage of seepage, pollution, and property contaminationrisks in North America, thereby eliminating such coverage
in the State of California.20 Id., at 47-48 (|||| 146-150).At the outset, we note that the District Court undoubtedly
had jurisdiction of these Sherman Act claims, as the Londonreinsurers apparently concede. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 37
("Our position is not that the Sherman Act does not apply inthe sense that a minimal basis for the exercise of jurisdiction
doesn't exist here. Our position is that there are certaincircumstances, and that this is one of them, in which the interests of another State are sufficient that the exercise ofthat jurisdiction should be restrained").

counterpart in the Connecticut Complaint. The claims each name different groups of London reinsurers, and not all of the named defendants are

variations.

Opinion of the Court
According to the London reinsurers, the District Courtshould have declined to exercise such jurisdiction under the

principle of international comity.24 The Court of Appealsagreed that courts should look to that principle in deciding
whether to exercise jurisdiction under the Sherman Act.
Id., at 932. This availed the London reinsurers nothing,however. To be sure, the Court of Appeals believed that

"application of [American] antitrust laws to the London rein-surance market `would lead to significant conflict with English law and policy,' " and that "[s]uch a conflict, unless out-weighed by other factors, would by itself be reason to decline

export transactions that did not injure the United States economy, see
H. R. Rep. No. 97-686, pp. 2-3, 9-10 (1982); P. Areeda & H. Hovenkamp,
Antitrust Law || 236'a, pp. 296-297 (Supp. 1992), and it is unclear how it
might apply to the conduct alleged here. Also unclear is whether the
Act's "direct, substantial, and reasonably foreseeable effect" standard
amends existing law or merely codifies it. See id., || 236'a, p. 297. We
need not address these questions here. Assuming that the FTAIA's
standard affects this litigation, and assuming further that that standard
differs from the prior law, the conduct alleged plainly meets its
requirements.

24 Justice Scalia contends that comity concerns figure into the prior

analysis whether jurisdiction exists under the Sherman Act. Post, at 817-
818. This contention is inconsistent with the general understanding that
the Sherman Act covers foreign conduct producing a substantial intended
effect in the United States, and that concerns of comity come into play, if
at all, only after a court has determined that the acts complained of are
subject to Sherman Act jurisdiction. See United States v. Aluminum Co.
of America, 148 F. 2d 416, 444 (CA2 1945) ("[I]t follows from what we
have . . . said that [the agreements at issue] were unlawful [under the
Sherman Act], though made abroad, if they were intended to affect imports and did affect them"); Mannington Mills, Inc. v. Congoleum Corp.,
595 F. 2d 1287, 1294 (CA3 1979) (once court determines that jurisdiction
exists under the Sherman Act, question remains whether comity precludes
its exercise); H. R. Rep. No. 97-686, supra, at 13. But cf. Timberlane
Lumber Co. v. Bank of America, N. T. & S. A., 549 F. 2d 597, 613 (CA9
1976); 1 J. Atwood & K. Brewster, Antitrust and American Business
Abroad 166 (1981). In any event, the parties conceded jurisdiction at oral
argument, see supra, at 795, and we see no need to address this contention here.

exercise of jurisdiction." Id., at 933 (citation omitted). But
other factors, in the court's view, including the London reinsurers' express purpose to affect United States commerce
and the substantial nature of the effect produced, outweighed the supposed conflict and required the exercise of
jurisdiction in this litigation. Id., at 934.

When it enacted the FTAIA, Congress expressed no view
on the question whether a court with Sherman Act jurisdiction should ever decline to exercise such jurisdiction on
grounds of international comity. See H. R. Rep. No. 97-686,
p. 13 (1982) ("If a court determines that the requirements for
subject matter jurisdiction are met, [the FTAIA] would have
no effect on the court['s] ability to employ notions of comity
. . . or otherwise to take account of the international character of the transaction") (citing Timberlane). We need not
decide that question here, however, for even assuming that
in a proper case a court may decline to exercise Sherman
Act jurisdiction over foreign conduct (or, as Justice Scalia
would put it, may conclude by the employment of comity
analysis in the first instance that there is no jurisdiction),
international comity would not counsel against exercising
jurisdiction in the circumstances alleged here.

The only substantial question in this litigation is whether
"there is in fact a true conflict between domestic and foreign law." Socie'te' Nationale Industrielle Ae'rospatiale v.
United States Dist. Court for Southern Dist. of Iowa, 482
U. S. 522, 555 (1987) (Blackmun, J., concurring in part and

applying the Act to their conduct would conflict significantly

a conflict. "[T]he fact that conduct is lawful in the state in

have no need in this litigation to address other considerations that might inform a decision to refrain from the exercise of jurisdiction on grounds of international comity.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed in part
and reversed in part, and the cases are remanded for further
proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

25 Justice Scalia says that we put the cart before the horse in citing
this authority, for he argues it may be apposite only after a determination
that jurisdiction over the foreign acts is reasonable. Post, at 821. But
whatever the order of cart and horse, conflict in this sense is the only
substantial issue before the Court.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court withrespect to Part I, and delivered a dissenting opinion with

respect to Part II.*

With respect to the petition in No. 91-1111, I join theCourt's judgment and Parts I and II-A of its opinion. I

write separately because I do not agree with Justice
Souter's analysis, set forth in Part II-B of his opinion, ofwhat constitutes a "boycott" for purposes of $ 3(b) of the

McCarran-Ferguson Act, 15 U. S. C. $ 1013(b). With respectto the petition in No. 91-1128, I dissent from the Court's
ruling concerning the extraterritorial application of theSherman Act. Part I below discusses the boycott issue;
Part II extraterritoriality. I

Determining proper application of $ 3(b) of the McCarran-Ferguson Act to the present cases requires precise definition
of the word "boycott." 1 It is a relatively new word, littlemore than a century old. It was first used in 1880, to describe the collective action taken against Captain CharlesBoycott, an English agent managing various estates in Ireland. The Land League, an Irish organization formed theprevious year, had demanded that landlords reduce their
rents and had urged tenants to avoid dealing with those whofailed to do so. Boycott did not bend to the demand and
instead ordered evictions. In retaliation, the tenants "sen[t]Captain Boycott to Coventry in a very thorough manner."

anything to do with him, and, as far as they could prevent

opinion in its entirety, and The Chief Justice joins Part I of this opinion.

1 Section 3(b) of the McCarran-Ferguson Act, 15 U. S. C. $ 1013(b),

provides:

"Nothing contained in this Act shall render the said Sherman Act inapplicable to any agreement to boycott, coerce, or intimidate, or act of
boycott, coercion, or intimidation."

it, not to allow any one else to have anything to do withhim. . . . [T]he awful sentence of excommunication could

hardly have rendered him more helplessly alone for a time.No one would work for him; no one would supply him with
food." Id., at 108-109; see also H. Laidler, Boycotts and the
Labor Struggle 23-27 (1968). Thus, the verb made from theunfortunate Captain's name has had from the outset the

meaning it continues to carry today. To "boycott" means"[t]o combine in refusing to hold relations of any kind, social
or commercial, public or private, with (a neighbour), on ac-count of political or other differences, so as to punish him for
the position he has taken up, or coerce him into abandoning
it." 2 Oxford English Dictionary 468 (2d ed. 1989).

Petitioners have suggested that a boycott ordinarily requires "an absolute refusal to deal on any terms," which was
concededly not the case here. Brief for Petitioners in No.
91-1111, p. 31; see also Reply Brief for Petitioners in No.
91-1111, pp. 12-13. We think not. As the definition just
recited provides, the refusal may be imposed "to punish [the
target] for the position he has taken up, or coerce him into
abandoning it." The refusal to deal may, in other words,
be conditional, offering its target the incentive of renewed
dealing if and when he mends his ways. This is often the
case--and indeed seems to have been the case with the original Boycott boycott. Cf. McCarthy, supra, at 109 (noting
that the Captain later lived "at peace" with his neighbors).
Furthermore, other dictionary definitions extend the term to
include a partial boycott--a refusal to engage in some, but
not all, transactions with the target. See Webster's New
International Dictionary 321 (2d ed. 1950) (defining "boycott"
as "to withhold, wholly or in part, social or business intercourse from, as an expression of disapproval or means of coercion" (emphasis added)).

It is, however, important--and crucial in the present
cases--to distinguish between a conditional boycott and a
concerted agreement to seek particular terms in particular

509us3u118 03-27-97 18:33:09 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
transactions. A concerted agreement to terms (a "carteliza-tion") is "a way of obtaining and exercising market power

by concertedly exacting terms like those which a monopolistmight exact." L. Sullivan, Law of Antitrust 257 (1977).
The parties to such an agreement (the members of a cartel)are not engaging in a boycott, because:

"They are not coercing anyone, at least in the usualsense of that word; they are merely (though concertedly)
saying `we will deal with you only on the following
trade terms.'". . . Indeed, if a concerted agreement, say, to include

a security deposit in all contracts is a `boycott' becauseit excludes all buyers who won't agree to it, then by
parity of reasoning every price fixing agreement wouldbe a boycott also. The use of the single concept, boycott, to cover agreements so varied in nature can onlyadd to confusion."

Ibid. (emphasis added).

Thus, if Captain Boycott's tenants had agreed among them-selves that they would refuse to renew their leases unless he

reduced his rents, that would have been a concerted agree-ment on the terms of the leases, but not a boycott.

2 The

tenants, of course, did more than that; they refused to engagein other, unrelated transactions with Boycott--e. g., selling

him food--unless he agreed to their terms on rents. It is

2 Under the Oxford English Dictionary definition, of course, this example
would not be a "boycott" because the tenants had not suspended all relations with the Captain. But if one recognizes partial boycotts (as we and
Justice Souter do), and if one believes (as Justice Souter does but we
do not) that the purpose of a boycott can be to secure different terms in
the very transaction that is the supposed subject of the boycott, then it is
impossible to explain why this is not a boycott. Under Justice Souter's
reasoning, it would be a boycott, at least if the tenants acted "at the behest
of" (whatever that means), ante, at 792, the Irish Land League. This
hypothetical shows that the problems presented by partial boycotts (which
we agree fall within $ 3(b)) make more urgent the need to distinguish
boycotts from concerted agreements on terms.

Opinion of the Court
this expansion of the refusal to deal beyond the targetedtransaction that gives great coercive force to a commercial

boycott: unrelated transactions are used as leverage toachieve the terms desired.

The proper definition of "boycott" is evident from the
Court's opinion in Eastern States Retail Lumber Dealers'
Assn. v. United States, 234 U. S. 600 (1914), which is recognized in the antitrust field as one of the "leading case[s] in-volving commercial boycotts." Barber, Refusals to Deal

under the Federal Antitrust Laws, 103 U. Pa. L. Rev. 847,873 (1955). The associations of retail lumber dealers in that
case refused to buy lumber from wholesale lumber dealers
who sold directly to consumers. The boycott attempted "to
impose as a condition . . . on [the wholesale dealers'] trade
that they shall not sell in such manner that a local retailer
may regard such sale as an infringement of his exclusive
right to trade." 234 U. S., at 611. We held that to be an
" `artificial conditio[n],' " since "the trade of the wholesaler
with strangers was directly affected, not because of any supposed wrong which he had done to them, but because of the
grievance of a member of one of the associations." Id., at
611-612. In other words, the associations' activities were
a boycott because they sought an objective--the wholesale
dealers' forbearance from retail trade--that was collateral to
their transactions with the wholesalers.

Of course as far as the Sherman Act (outside the exempted
insurance field) is concerned, concerted agreements on contract terms are as unlawful as boycotts. For example, in
Paramount Famous Lasky Corp. v. United States, 282 U. S.
30 (1930), and United States v. First Nat. Pictures, Inc., 282
U. S. 44 (1930), we held unreasonable an agreement among
competing motion picture distributors under which they refused to license films to exhibitors except on standardized
terms. We also found unreasonable the restraint of trade in
Anderson v. Shipowners Assn. of Pacific Coast, 272 U. S.
359 (1926), which involved an attempt by an association of

Opinion of the Court
employers to establish industry-wide terms of employment.These sorts of concerted actions, similar to what is alleged

to have occurred here, are not properly characterized as"boycotts," and the word does not appear in the opinions.

3

In fact, in the 65 years between the coining of the word andenactment of the McCarran-Ferguson Act in 1945, "boycott"

appears in only seven opinions of this Court involving com-mercial (nonlabor) antitrust matters, and

not once is it usedas
Justice Souter uses it--to describe a concerted refusalto engage in particular transactions until the terms of those

transactions are agreeable.4In addition to its use in the antitrust field, the concept of
"boycott" frequently appears in labor law, and in this contextas well there is a clear distinction between boycotts and
concerted agreements seeking terms. The ordinary strike

3 Justice Souter points out that the Court in St. Paul Fire & Marine
Ins. Co. v. Barry, 438 U. S. 531 (1978), found the term "boycott" "does not
refer to ` "a unitary phenomenon," ' " ante, at 788 (quoting Barry, supra,
at 543 (quoting P. Areeda, Antitrust Analysis 381 (2d ed. 1974))), and asserts that our position contradicts this. Ante, at 793-794. But to be not
a "unitary phenomenon" is different from being an all-encompassing one.
"Boycott" is a multifaceted "phenomenon" that includes conditional boycotts, punitive boycotts, coercive boycotts, partial boycotts, labor boycotts,
political boycotts, social boycotts, etc. It merely does not include refusals
to deal because of objections to proposed terms.

Opinion of the Court
seeking better contract terms is a "refusal to deal"--i. e.,
union members refuse to sell their labor until the employer
capitulates to their contract demands. But no one would
call this a boycott, because the conditions of the "refusal to
deal" relate directly to the terms of the refused transaction
(the employment contract). A refusal to work changes from
strike to boycott only when it seeks to obtain action from
the employer unrelated to the employment contract. This
distinction is well illustrated by the famous boycott of Pullman cars by Eugene Debs' American Railway Union in 1894.
The incident began when workers at the Pullman Palace Car
Company called a strike, but the "boycott" occurred only
when other members of the American Railway Union, not
Pullman employees, supported the strikers by refusing to
work on any train drawing a Pullman car. See In re Debs,
158 U. S. 564, 566-567 (1895) (statement of the case); H.
Laidler, Boycotts and the Labor Struggle 100-108 (1968).
The refusal to handle Pullman cars had nothing to do with
Pullman cars themselves (working on Pullman cars was no
more difficult or dangerous than working on other cars);
rather, it was in furtherance of the collateral objective of
obtaining better employment terms for the Pullman workers.
In other labor cases as well, the term "boycott" invariably
holds the meaning that we ascribe to it: Its goal is to alter,
not the terms of the refused transaction, but the terms of
workers' employment.5

5 See, e. g., Bedford Cut Stone Co. v. Stone Cutters, 274 U. S. 37, 47, 49
(1927) (refusal to work on stone received from nonunion quarries); Duplex
Printing Press Co. v. Deering, 254 U. S. 443, 462-463 (1921) (boycott of
target's product until it agreed to union's employment demands); Gompers
v. Bucks Stove & Range Co., 221 U. S. 418 (1911) (boycott of company's
products because of allegedly unfair labor practices); Loewe v. Lawlor, 208
U. S. 274 (1908) (boycott of fur hats made by a company that would not
allow its workers to be unionized). See also Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader,
310 U. S. 469, 503-505 (1940) (distinguishing between ordinary strikes
and boycotts).

806 HARTFORD FIRE INS. CO. v. CALIFORNIA

Opinion of the Court
The one case in which we have found an activity to con-stitute a "boycott" within the meaning of the McCarranFerguson Act is St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Barry,438 U. S. 531 (1978). There the plaintiffs were licensed physicians and their patients, and the defendant (St. Paul) was a
malpractice insurer that had refused to renew the physicians'policies on an "occurrence" basis, but insisted upon a "claims

made" basis. The allegation was that, at the instance of St.Paul, the three other malpractice insurers in the State had
collectively refused to write insurance for St. Paul's custom-ers, thus forcing them to accept St. Paul's renewal terms.
Unsurprisingly, we held the allegation sufficient to state a
cause of action. The insisted-upon condition of the boycott
(not being a former St. Paul policyholder) was "artificial": it
bore no relationship (or an "artificial" relationship) to the
proposed contracts of insurance that the physicians wished
to conclude with St. Paul's competitors.

Under the standard described, it is obviously not a "boycott" for the reinsurers to "refus[e] to reinsure coverages
written on the ISO CGL forms until the desired changes
were made," ante, at 788, because the terms of the primary
coverages are central elements of the reinsurance contract--
they are what is reinsured. See App. 16-17 (Cal. Complaint
|||| 26-27). The "primary policies are . . . the basis of the
losses that are shared in the reinsurance agreements." 1 B.
Webb, H. Anderson, J. Cookman, & P. Kensicki, Principles of
Reinsurance 87 (1990); see also id., at 55; Gurley, Regulation
of Reinsurance in the United States, 19 Forum 72, 73 (1983).
Indeed, reinsurance is so closely tied to the terms of the
primary insurance contract that one of the two categories
of reinsurance (assumption reinsurance) substitutes the reinsurer for the primary or "ceding" insurer and places the
reinsurer into contractual privity with the primary insurer's
policyholders. See id., at 73-74; Colonial American Life
Ins. Co. v. Commissioner, 491 U. S. 244, 247 (1989); B.
Ostrager & T. Newman, Handbook on Insurance Coverage

Opinion of the Court
Disputes chs. 15-16 (5th ed. 1992). And in the other category of reinsurance (indemnity reinsurance), either the
terms of the underlying insurance policy are incorporated by
reference (if the reinsurance is written under a facultative
agreement), see J. Butler & R. Merkin, Reinsurance Law
B.1.1-04 (1992); R. Carter, Reinsurance 235 (1979), or (if the
reinsurance is conducted on a treaty basis) the reinsurer will
require full disclosure of the terms of the underlying insurance policies and usually require that the primary insurer
not vary those terms without prior approval, see id., at
256, 297.

Justice Souter simply disregards this integral relationship between the terms of the primary insurance form and
the contract of reinsurance. He describes the reinsurers as
"individuals and entities who were not members of ISO, and
who would not ordinarily be parties to an agreement setting
the terms of primary insurance, not being in the business of
selling it." Ante, at 788. While this factual assumption is
crucial to Justice Souter's reasoning (because otherwise
he would not be able to distinguish permissible agreements
among primary insurers), he offers no support for the statement. But even if it happens to be true, he does not explain
why it must be true--that is, why the law must exclude reinsurers from full membership and participation. The realities of the industry may make explanation difficult:

"Reinsurers also benefit from the services by ISO and
other rating or service organizations. The underlying
rates and policy forms are the basis for many reinsurance contracts. Reinsurers may also subscribe to various services. For example, a facultative reinsurer may
subscribe to the rating service, so that they have the
rating manuals available, or purchase optional services,
such as a sprinkler report for a specific property location." 2 R. Reinarz, J. Schloss, G. Patrik, & P. Kensicki,
Reinsurance Practices 18 (1990).

808 HARTFORD FIRE INS. CO. v. CALIFORNIA

Opinion of the Court
Justice Souter also describes reinsurers as being "out-side the primary insurance industry."

Ante, at 789. That
is technically true (to the extent the two symbiotic industriescan be separated) but quite irrelevant. What matters is

that the scope and predictability of the risks assumed in a
reinsurance contract depend entirely upon the terms of the
primary policies that are reinsured. The terms of the primary policies are the "subject-matter insured" by reinsurance, Carter, supra, at 4, so that to insist upon certain
primary-insurance terms as a condition of writing reinsurance is in no way "artificial"; and hence for a number of
reinsurers to insist upon such terms jointly is in no way
a "boycott." 6

Justice Souter seems to believe that a nonboycott is converted into a boycott by the fact that it occurs "at the behest
of," ante, at 789, or is "solicited" by, ibid., competitors of
the target. He purports to find support for this implausible
proposition in United States v. South-Eastern Underwriters
Assn., 322 U. S. 533 (1944), which involved a classic boycott,
by primary insurers, of competitors who refused to join their
price-fixing conspiracy, the South-Eastern Underwriters Association (S. E. U. A.). The conspirators would not deal with
independent agents who wrote for such companies, and
would not write policies for customers who insured with
them. See id., at 535-536. Moreover, Justice Black's opinion for the Court noted cryptically, "[c]ompanies not members of S. E. U. A. were cut off from the opportunity to reinsure their risks." Id., at 535. Justice Souter speculates

6 Once it is determined that the actions of the reinsurers did not constitute a "boycott," but rather a concerted agreement to terms, it follows
that their actions do not constitute "coercion" or "intimidation" within the
meaning of the statute. That is because, as previously mentioned, such
concerted agreements do "not coerc[e] anyone, at least in the usual sense
of that word," L. Sullivan, Law of Antitrust 257 (1977), and because they
are precisely what is protected by McCarran-Ferguson immunity.

Opinion of the Court
that "the [S. E. U. A.] defendants could have [managed to cut
the targets off from reinsurance] by prompting reinsurance
companies to refuse to deal with nonmembers." Ante, at
789. Even assuming that is what happened, all that can be
derived from S. E. U. A. is the proposition that one who
prompts a boycott is a co-conspirator with the boycotters.
For with or without the defendants' prompting, the reinsurers' refusal to deal in S. E. U. A. was a boycott, membership in the association having no discernible bearing upon
the terms of the refused reinsurance contracts.

Justice Souter suggests that we have somehow mistakenly "posit[ed] . . . autonomy on the part of the reinsurers."
Ante, at 792. We do not understand this. Nothing in the
complaints alleges that the reinsurers were deprived of their
"autonomy," which we take to mean that they were coerced
by the primary insurers. (Given the sheer size of the
Lloyd's market, such an allegation would be laughable.)
That is not to say that we disagree with Justice Souter's
contention that, according to the allegations, the reinsurers
would not "have taken exactly the same course of action
without the intense efforts of the four primary insurers."
Ibid. But the same could be said of the participants in virtually all conspiracies: If they had not been enlisted by the
"intense efforts" of the leaders, their actions would not have
been the same. If this factor renders otherwise lawful conspiracies (under McCarran-Ferguson) illegal, then the Act
would have a narrow scope indeed.

Perhaps Justice Souter feels that it is undesirable, as a
policy matter, to allow insurers to "prompt" reinsurers not
to deal with the insurers' competitors--whether or not that
refusal to deal is a boycott. That feeling is certainly understandable, since under the normal application of the Sherman
Act the reinsurers' concerted refusal to deal would be an
unlawful conspiracy, and the insurers' "prompting" could
make them part of that conspiracy. The McCarran509us3u118 03-27-97 18:33:09 PAGES OPINPGT
810 HARTFORD FIRE INS. CO. v. CALIFORNIA

Opinion of the Court
Ferguson Act, however, makes that conspiracy lawful (as-suming reinsurance is state regulated), unless the refusal to

deal is a "boycott."Under the test set forth above, there are sufficient allegations of a "boycott" to sustain the relevant counts of
complaint against a motion to dismiss. For example, thecomplaints allege that some of the defendant reinsurers threatened to "withdra[w] entirely from the business ofreinsuring primary U. S. insurers who wrote on the occurrence form." App. 31 (Cal. Complaint || 89), id., at 83 (Conn.Complaint || 93). Construed most favorably to respondents,
that allegation claims that primary insurers who wrote insurance on disfavored forms would be refused all reinsurance, even as to risks written on other forms. If that were
the case, the reinsurers might have been engaging in a boycott--they would, that is, unless the primary insurers' other
business were relevant to the proposed reinsurance contract
(for example, if the reinsurer bears greater risk where the
primary insurer engages in riskier businesses). Cf. Gonye,
Underwriting the Reinsured, in Reinsurance 439, 463-466
(R. Strain ed. 1980); 2 R. Reinarz, J. Schloss, G. Patrik, & P.
Kensicki, Reinsurance Practices 21-23 (1990) (same). Other
allegations in the complaints could be similarly construed.
For example, the complaints also allege that the reinsurers
"threatened a boycott of North American CGL risks," not
just CGL risks containing dissatisfactory terms, App. 26
(Cal. Complaint || 74), id., at 79 (Conn. Complaint || 78); that
"the foreign and domestic reinsurer representatives presented their agreed upon positions that there would be
changes in the CGL forms or no reinsurance," id., at 29 (Cal.
Complaint || 82), id., at 81-82 (Conn. Complaint || 86); that
some of the defendant insurers and reinsurers told "groups
of insurance brokers and agents . . . that a reinsurance boycott, and thus loss of income to the agents and brokers who
would be unable to find available markets for their customers, would ensue if the [revised] ISO forms were not ap509us3u118 03-27-97 18:33:09 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
proved," id., at 29 (Cal. Complaint || 85), id., at 82 (Conn.
Complaint || 89).

Many other allegations in the complaints describe conduct
that may amount to a boycott if the plaintiffs can prove certain additional facts. For example, General Re, the largest
American reinsurer, is alleged to have "agreed to either coerce ISO to adopt [the defendants'] demands or, failing that,
`derail' the entire CGL forms program." Id., at 24 (Cal.
Complaint || 64), id., at 77 (Conn. Complaint || 68). If this
means that General Re intended to withhold all reinsurance
on all CGL forms--even forms having no objectionable
terms--that might amount to a "boycott." Also, General Re
and several other domestic reinsurers are alleged to have
"agreed to boycott the 1984 ISO forms unless a retroactive
date was added to the claims-made form, and a pollution exclusion and a defense cost cap were added to both [the occurrence and claims made] forms." Id., at 25 (Cal. Complaint
|| 66), id., at 78 (Conn. Complaint || 70). Liberally construed,
this allegation may mean that the defendants had linked
their demands so that they would continue to refuse to do
business on either form until both were changed to their liking. Again, that might amount to a boycott. "[A] complaint
should not be dismissed unless `it appears beyond doubt that
the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim
which would entitle him to relief.' " McLain v. Real Estate
Bd. of New Orleans, Inc., 444 U. S. 232, 246 (1980) (quoting
Conley v. Gibson, 355 U. S. 41, 45-46 (1957)). Under that
standard, these allegations are sufficient to sustain the First,
Second, Third, and Fourth Claims for Relief in the California
Complaint and the First and Second Claims for Relief in the
Connecticut Complaint.7

7 We agree with Justice Souter's conclusion, ante, at 790-791, n. 18,
that the Seventh Claim for Relief in the California Complaint and the
Sixth Claim for Relief in the Connecticut Complaint fail to allege any

Scalia, J., dissenting

II
Petitioners in No. 91-1128, various British corporations
and other British subjects, argue that certain of the claims
against them constitute an inappropriate extraterritorial application of the Sherman Act.8 It is important to distinguish
two distinct questions raised by this petition: whether the
District Court had jurisdiction, and whether the Sherman
Act reaches the extraterritorial conduct alleged here. On
the first question, I believe that the District Court had
subject-matter jurisdiction over the Sherman Act claims
against all the defendants (personal jurisdiction is not contested). Respondents asserted nonfrivolous claims under
the Sherman Act, and 28 U. S. C. $ 1331 vests district courts
with subject-matter jurisdiction over cases "arising under"
federal statutes. As precedents such as Lauritzen v.
Larsen, 345 U. S. 571 (1953), make clear, that is sufficient to
establish the District Court's jurisdiction over these claims.
Lauritzen involved a Jones Act claim brought by a foreign
sailor against a foreign shipowner. The shipowner contested the District Court's jurisdiction, see id., at 573, apparently on the grounds that the Jones Act did not govern the
dispute between the foreign parties to the action. Though
ultimately agreeing with the shipowner that the Jones Act
did not apply, see discussion infra, at 816, the Court held
that the District Court had jurisdiction.

"As frequently happens, a contention that there is some
barrier to granting plaintiff 's claim is cast in terms of
an exception to jurisdiction of subject matter. A cause
of action under our law was asserted here, and the court
had power to determine whether it was or was not well
founded in law and in fact." 345 U. S., at 575.

8 The counts at issue in this litigation are the Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth
Claims for Relief in the California Complaint. See App. 43-46 (|||| 131-
140), id., at 47-49 (|||| 146-150).

Scalia, J., dissenting
See also Romero v. International Terminal Operating Co.,358 U. S. 354, 359 (1959).

The second question--the extraterritorial reach of theSherman Act--has nothing to do with the jurisdiction of the
courts. It is a question of substantive law turning on
whether, in enacting the Sherman Act, Congress assertedregulatory power over the challenged conduct. See

EEOC
v. Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244, 248 (1991)
(Aramco) ("It is our task to determine whether Congress
intended the protections of Title VII to apply to UnitedStates citizens employed by American employers outside of

the United States"). If a plaintiff fails to prevail on this
issue, the court does not dismiss the claim for want of
subject-matter jurisdiction--want of power to adjudicate;
rather, it decides the claim, ruling on the merits that the
plaintiff has failed to state a cause of action under the relevant statute. See Romero, supra, at 384 (holding no claim
available under the Jones Act); American Banana Co. v.
United Fruit Co., 213 U. S. 347, 359 (1909) (holding that complaint based upon foreign conduct "alleges no case under the
[Sherman Act]").

There is, however, a type of "jurisdiction" relevant to determining the extraterritorial reach of a statute; it is known
as "legislative jurisdiction," Aramco, supra, at 253; Restatement (First) Conflict of Laws $ 60 (1934), or "jurisdiction to
prescribe," 1 Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law
of the United States 235 (1987) (hereinafter Restatement
(Third)). This refers to "the authority of a state to make its
law applicable to persons or activities," and is quite a separate matter from "jurisdiction to adjudicate," see id., at 231.
There is no doubt, of course, that Congress possesses legislative jurisdiction over the acts alleged in this complaint: Congress has broad power under Article I, $ 8, cl. 3, "[t]o regulate
Commerce with foreign Nations," and this Court has repeatedly upheld its power to make laws applicable to persons
or activities beyond our territorial boundaries where United

States interests are affected. See Ford v. United States, 273U. S. 593, 621-623 (1927);

United States v. Bowman, 260 U. S.
94, 98-99 (1922); American Banana, supra, at 356. But thequestion in this litigation is whether, and to what extent,

Congress has exercised that undoubted legislative jurisdiction in enacting the Sherman Act.Two canons of statutory construction are relevant in this

inquiry. The first is the "longstanding principle of Americanlaw `that legislation of Congress, unless a contrary intent
appears, is meant to apply only within the territorial juris-diction of the United States.' "

Aramco, supra, at 248 (quoting Foley Bros., Inc. v. Filardo, 336 U. S. 281, 285 (1949)).
Applying that canon in Aramco, we held that the version of
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 then in force, 42
U. S. C. $$ 2000e to 2000e-17 (1988 ed.), did not extend outside the territory of the United States even though the statute contained broad provisions extending its prohibitions to,
for example, " `any activity, business, or industry in commerce.' " Id., at 249 (quoting 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e(h)). We
held such "boilerplate language" to be an insufficient indication to override the presumption against extraterritoriality.
Id., at 251; see also id., at 251-253. The Sherman Act contains similar "boilerplate language," and if the question were
not governed by precedent, it would be worth considering
whether that presumption controls the outcome here. We
have, however, found the presumption to be overcome with
respect to our antitrust laws; it is now well established that
the Sherman Act applies extraterritorially. See Matsushita
Elec. Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U. S. 574,
582, n. 6 (1986); Continental Ore Co. v. Union Carbide &
Carbon Corp., 370 U. S. 690, 704 (1962); see also United
States v. Aluminum Co. of America, 148 F. 2d 416 (CA2
1945).

But if the presumption against extraterritoriality has been
overcome or is otherwise inapplicable, a second canon of statutory construction becomes relevant: "[A]n act of congress

509us3u118 03-27-97 18:33:10 PAGES OPINPGT

815Cite as: 509 U. S. 764 (1993)
Scalia, J., dissenting
ought never to be construed to violate the law of nations ifany other possible construction remains."

Murray v. Schooner Charming Betsy, 2 Cranch 64, 118 (1804) (Marshall,C. J.). This canon is "wholly independent" of the presumption against extraterritoriality. Aramco, supra, at 264
(Marshall, J., dissenting). It is relevant to determining thesubstantive reach of a statute because "the law of nations,"

or customary international law, includes limitations on a na-tion's exercise of its jurisdiction to prescribe. See Restatement (Third) $$ 401-416. Though it clearly has constitu-tional authority to do so, Congress is generally presumed not
to have exceeded those customary international-law limits
on jurisdiction to prescribe.

Consistent with that presumption, this and other courts
have frequently recognized that, even where the presumption against extraterritoriality does not apply, statutes
should not be interpreted to regulate foreign persons or conduct if that regulation would conflict with principles of international law. For example, in Romero v. International Terminal Operating Co., 358 U. S. 354 (1959), the plaintiff, a
Spanish sailor who had been injured while working aboard a
Spanish-flag and Spanish-owned vessel, filed a Jones Act
claim against his Spanish employer. The presumption
against extraterritorial application of federal statutes was
inapplicable to the case, as the actionable tort had occurred
in American waters. See id., at 383. The Court nonetheless stated that, "in the absence of a contrary congressional
direction," it would apply "principles of choice of law that
are consonant with the needs of a general federal maritime
law and with due recognition of our self-regarding respect
for the relevant interests of foreign nations in the regulation
of maritime commerce as part of the legitimate concern of
the international community." Id., at 382-383. "The controlling considerations" in this choice-of-law analysis were
"the interacting interests of the United States and of foreign
countries." Id., at 383.

Scalia, J., dissenting
Romero referred to, and followed, the choice-of-law analysis set forth in Lauritzen v. Larsen, 345 U. S. 571 (1953). As
previously mentioned, Lauritzen also involved a Jones Act
claim brought by a foreign sailor against a foreign employer.
The Lauritzen Court recognized the basic problem: "If [the
Jones Act were] read literally, Congress has conferred an
American right of action which requires nothing more than
that plaintiff be `any seaman who shall suffer personal injury
in the course of his employment.' " Id., at 576. The solution it adopted was to construe the statute "to apply only
to areas and transactions in which American law would be
considered operative under prevalent doctrines of international law." Id., at 577 (emphasis added). To support application of international law to limit the facial breadth of
the statute, the Court relied upon--of course--Chief Justice
Marshall's statement in Schooner Charming Betsy, quoted
supra, at 814-815. It then set forth "several factors which,
alone or in combination, are generally conceded to influence
choice of law to govern a tort claim." 345 U. S., at 583; see
id., at 583-593 (discussing factors). See also McCulloch v.
Sociedad Nacional de Marineros de Honduras, 372 U. S. 10,
21-22 (1963) (applying Schooner Charming Betsy principle
to restrict application of National Labor Relations Act to
foreign-flag vessels).

Lauritzen, Romero, and McCulloch were maritime cases,
but we have recognized the principle that the scope of generally worded statutes must be construed in light of international law in other areas as well. See, e. g., Sale v. Haitian
Centers Council, Inc., ante, at 178, n. 35; Weinberger v.
Rossi, 456 U. S. 25, 32 (1982). More specifically, the principle was expressed in United States v. Aluminum Co. of
America, 148 F. 2d 416 (CA2 1945), the decision that established the extraterritorial reach of the Sherman Act. In his
opinion for the court, Judge Learned Hand cautioned "we
are not to read general words, such as those in [the Sherman]

Act, without regard to the limitations customarily observed
by nations upon the exercise of their powers; limitations
which generally correspond to those fixed by the `Conflict of
Laws.' " Id., at 443.

More recent lower court precedent has also tempered the
extraterritorial application of the Sherman Act with considerations of "international comity." See Timberlane Lumber
Co. v. Bank of America, N. T. & S. A., 549 F. 2d 597, 608-615
(CA9 1976); Mannington Mills, Inc. v. Congoleum Corp., 595
F. 2d 1287, 1294-1298 (CA3 1979); Montreal Trading Ltd. v.
Amax Inc., 661 F. 2d 864, 869-871 (CA10 1981); Laker Airways Limited v. Sabena, Belgian World Airlines, 235 U. S.
App. D. C. 207, 236, and n. 109, 731 F. 2d 909, 938, and n. 109
(1984); see also Pacific Seafarers, Inc. v. Pacific Far East
Line, Inc., 131 U. S. App. D. C. 226, 236, and n. 31, 404 F. 2d
804, 814, and n. 31 (1968). The "comity" they refer to is
not the comity of courts, whereby judges decline to exercise
jurisdiction over matters more appropriately adjudged elsewhere, but rather what might be termed "prescriptive comity": the respect sovereign nations afford each other by limiting the reach of their laws. That comity is exercised by
legislatures when they enact laws, and courts assume it has
been exercised when they come to interpreting the scope
of laws their legislatures have enacted. It is a traditional
component of choice-of-law theory. See J. Story, Commentaries on the Conflict of Laws $ 38 (1834) (distinguishing between the "comity of the courts" and the "comity of nations,"
and defining the latter as "the true foundation and extent of
the obligation of the laws of one nation within the territories
of another"). Comity in this sense includes the choice-oflaw principles that, "in the absence of contrary congressional
direction," are assumed to be incorporated into our substantive laws having extraterritorial reach. Romero, supra, at
382-383; see also Lauritzen, supra, at 578-579; Hilton v.
Guyot, 159 U. S. 113, 162-166 (1895). Considering comity in

this way is just part of determining whether the ShermanAct prohibits the conduct at issue.

9

In sum, the practice of using international law to limit theextraterritorial reach of statutes is firmly established in our

jurisprudence. In proceeding to apply that practice to thepresent cases, I shall rely on the Restatement (Third) for
the relevant principles of international law. Its standardsappear fairly supported in the decisions of this Court construing international choice-of-law principles (Lauritzen,
Romero, and McCulloch) and in the decisions of other fed-eral courts, especially Timberlane. Whether the Restatement precisely reflects international law in every detail mat-ters little here, as I believe this litigation would be resolved
the same way under virtually any conceivable test that takesaccount of foreign regulatory interests.

Under the Restatement, a nation having some "basis" forjurisdiction to prescribe law should nonetheless refrain from
exercising that jurisdiction "with respect to a person or ac-tivity having connections with another state when the exercise of such jurisdiction is unreasonable." Restatement(Third) $ 403(1). The "reasonableness" inquiry turns on a
number of factors including, but not limited to: "the extentto which the activity takes place within the territory [of the
regulating state]," id., $ 403(2)(a); "the connections, such asnationality, residence, or economic activity, between the regulating state and the person principally responsible for the

9 Some antitrust courts, including the Court of Appeals in the present
cases, have mistaken the comity at issue for the "comity of courts," which
has led them to characterize the question presented as one of "abstention,"
that is, whether they should "exercise or decline jurisdiction." Mannington Mills, Inc. v. Congoleum Corp., 595 F. 2d 1287, 1294, 1296 (CA3 1979);
see also In re Insurance Antitrust Litigation, 938 F. 2d 919, 932 (CA9
1991). As I shall discuss, that seems to be the error the Court has fallen
into today. Because courts are generally reluctant to refuse the exercise
of conferred jurisdiction, confusion on this seemingly theoretical point can
have the very practical consequence of greatly expanding the extraterritorial reach of the Sherman Act.

activity to be regulated," id., $ 403(2)(b); "the character ofthe activity to be regulated, the importance of regulation to

the regulating state, the extent to which other states regu-late such activities, and the degree to which the desirability
of such regulation is generally accepted," id., $ 403(2)(c); "theextent to which another state may have an interest in regulating the activity," id., $ 403(2)(g); and "the likelihood ofconflict with regulation by another state,"

id., $ 403(2)(h).Rarely would these factors point more clearly against application of United States law. The activity relevant to thecounts at issue here took place primarily in the United Kingdom, and the defendants in these counts are British corpora-tions and British subjects having their principal place of
business or residence outside the United States.10 GreatBritain has established a comprehensive regulatory scheme
governing the London reinsurance markets, and clearly hasa heavy "interest in regulating the activity,"

id., $ 403(2)(g).See 938 F. 2d, at 932-933; In re Insurance Antitrust Litigation, 723 F. Supp. 464, 487-488 (ND Cal. 1989); see also J.Butler & R. Merkin, Reinsurance Law A.1.1-02 (1992). Finally, $ 2(b) of the McCarran-Ferguson Act allows state regu-latory statutes to override the Sherman Act in the insurance
field, subject only to the narrow "boycott" exception set forthin $ 3(b)--suggesting that "the importance of regulation to
the [United States]," Restatement (Third) $ 403(2)(c), isslight. Considering these factors, I think it unimaginable
that an assertion of legislative jurisdiction by the UnitedStates would be considered reasonable, and therefore it is
inappropriate to assume, in the absence of statutory indi-cation to the contrary, that Congress has made such an
assertion.

10 Some of the British corporations are subsidiaries of American corporations, and the Court of Appeals held that "[t]he interests of Britain are at
least diminished where the parties are subsidiaries of American corporations." Id., at 933. In effect, the Court of Appeals pierced the corporate
veil in weighing the interests at stake. I do not think that was proper.

It is evident from what I have said that the Court's comityanalysis, which proceeds as though the issue is whether the

courts should "decline to exercise . . . jurisdiction," ante, at798, rather than whether the Sherman Act covers this conduct, is simply misdirected. I do not at all agree, moreover,
with the Court's conclusion that the issue of the substantivescope of the Sherman Act is not in the cases. See

ante, at
796, n. 22; ante, at 797, n. 24. To be sure, the parties did notmake a clear distinction between adjudicative jurisdiction

and the scope of the statute. Parties often do not, as wehave observed (and have declined to punish with procedural
default) before. See the excerpt from Lauritzen quoted
supra, at 812; see also Romero, 358 U. S., at 359. It is not
realistic, and also not helpful, to pretend that the only really
relevant issue in this litigation is not before us. In any
event, if one erroneously chooses, as the Court does, to make
adjudicative jurisdiction (or, more precisely, abstention) the
vehicle for taking account of the needs of prescriptive comity,
the Court still gets it wrong. It concludes that no "true
conflict" counseling nonapplication of United States law (or
rather, as it thinks, United States judicial jurisdiction) exists
unless compliance with United States law would constitute a
violation of another country's law. Ante, at 798-799. That
breathtakingly broad proposition, which contradicts the
many cases discussed earlier, will bring the Sherman Act
and other laws into sharp and unnecessary conflict with the
legitimate interests of other countries--particularly our closest trading partners.

In the sense in which the term "conflic[t]" was used in
Lauritzen, 345 U. S., at 582, 592, and is generally understood
in the field of conflicts of laws, there is clearly a conflict in
this litigation. The petitioners here, like the defendant in
Lauritzen, were not compelled by any foreign law to take
their allegedly wrongful actions, but that no more precludes
a conflict-of-laws analysis here than it did there. See id., at
575-576 (detailing the differences between foreign and

United States law). Where applicable foreign and domesticlaw provide different substantive rules of decision to govern

the parties' dispute, a conflict-of-laws analysis is necessary.See generally R. Weintraub, Commentary on Conflict of
Laws 2-3 (1980); Restatement (First) of Conflict of Laws $ 1,
Comment c and Illustrations (1934).Literally the

only support that the Court adduces for
its position is $ 403 of the Restatement (Third)--or moreprecisely Comment

e to that provision, which states:

"Subsection (3) [which says that a State should defer to
another state if that State's interest is clearly greater]
applies only when one state requires what another pro-hibits, or where compliance with the regulations of two

states exercising jurisdiction consistently with this section is otherwise impossible. It does not apply where a
person subject to regulation by two states can comply
with the laws of both . . . ."

The Court has completely misinterpreted this provision.
Subsection (3) of $ 403 (requiring one State to defer to another in the limited circumstances just described) comes into
play only after subsection (1) of $ 403 has been complied
with--i. e., after it has been determined that the exercise of
jurisdiction by both of the two States is not "unreasonable."
That prior question is answered by applying the factors
(inter alia) set forth in subsection (2) of $ 403, that is, precisely the factors that I have discussed in text and that the
Court rejects.11

11 The Court skips directly to subsection (3) of $ 403, apparently on the
authority of Comment j to $ 415 of the Restatement (Third). See ante, at
799. But the preceding commentary to $ 415 makes clear that "[a]ny exercise of [legislative] jurisdiction under this section is subject to the requirement of reasonableness" set forth in $ 403(2). Restatement (Third) $ 415,
Comment a. Comment j refers back to the conflict analysis set forth in

$ 403(3), which, as noted above, comes after the reasonableness analysis
of $ 403(2).

DELO, SUPERINTENDENT, POTOSI CORRECTIONAL

CENTER v. BLAIR

on application to vacate stay of execution

No. A-69. Decided July 21, 1993
Held: The Court of Appeals' stay of execution is vacated. It is an abuse

of discretion for a federal court to interfere with the orderly process of
a State's criminal justice system in a habeas case raising claims that are
for all relevant purposes indistinguishable from those that this Court
recently rejected in Herrera v. Collins, 506 U. S. 390.

Per Curiam.
The application to vacate the stay of execution presented
to Justice Blackmun has been referred to the Court.

Applying the prevailing legal standard, it is "particularly
egregious" to enter a stay on second or subsequent habeas
petitions unless "there are substantial grounds upon which
relief might be granted." Herrera v. Collins, 506 U. S. 390,
425, 426 (1993) (O'Connor, J., joined by Kennedy, J., concurring) (internal quotation marks omitted). No substantial
grounds were presented in the present case. The District
Court stated that the "facts in Herrera mirror those in the
present case." No. 93-0674-CV-1 (WD Mo., July 19, 1993).
This assessment was not even questioned by the Court of
Appeals, and is obviously correct. There is therefore no
conceivable need for the Court of Appeals to engage in "more
detailed study" over the next five weeks to resolve this
claim. See 999 F. 2d 1219 (CA8 1993).

It is an abuse of discretion for a federal court to interfere
with the orderly process of a State's criminal justice system
in a case raising claims that are for all relevant purposes
indistinguishable from those we recently rejected in Herrera. Accordingly, the Court of Appeals' stay must be
vacated.

824 DELO v. BLAIR

Blackmun, J., dissenting
Justice Souter would deny the application to vacate
the stay.

Justice Blackmun, with whom Justice Stevens joins,
dissenting.

The Court errs twice in granting the State's application to
vacate the Court of Appeals' stay of execution. First, it
errs by affording insufficient deference to the Court of Appeals' decision. Second, it errs by letting stand the District
Court's decision, which was itself erroneous.

I
"The standard under which we consider motions to vacate
stays of execution is deferential, and properly so. Only
when the lower courts have clearly abused their discretion
in granting a stay should we take the extraordinary step of
overturning such a decision." Dugger v. Johnson, 485 U. S.
945, 947 (1988) (O'Connor, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J.,
dissenting). Accord, Barefoot v. Estelle, 463 U. S. 880, 896
(1983); Wainwright v. Spenkelink, 442 U. S. 901, 905 (1979)
(Rehnquist, J., dissenting). In this case, the Court of Appeals granted a temporary stay of execution to allow it time
properly to consider Blair's appeal. In my view, its decision
to do so does not constitute an abuse of discretion.

The State likens this case to Delo v. Stokes, 495 U. S. 320
(1990), in which this Court vacated a stay of execution because the prisoner's habeas petition "clearly constitute[d] an
abuse of the writ." Id., at 321. Although the habeas petition currently before the Court of Appeals is Blair's third,
the abuse of the writ doctrine cannot serve as the basis for
vacating this stay. Blair's principal contention in his federal
habeas petition is that he is actually innocent, and this Court
has recognized an exception to the abuse of the writ doctrine
where a habeas petitioner can show that he probably is innocent. See McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467, 495 (1991).

Blackmun, J., dissenting

II
The Court's second error is that it lets stand the DistrictCourt's decision denying Blair's claim without an evidentiary

hearing. In Herrera v. Collins, 506 U. S. 390 (1993), thisCourt assumed that "in a capital case a truly persuasive
demonstration of `actual innocence' made after trial wouldrender the execution of a defendant unconstitutional, and
warrant federal habeas relief if there were no state avenueopen to process such a claim." Id., at 417. The Court provided little guidance about what sort of showing would be"truly persuasive." Yet despite the uncertain contours of
this constitutional right, federal courts have an obligation totreat actual-innocence claims just as they would any other
constitutional claim brought pursuant to 28 U. S. C. $ 2254.The rules governing federal habeas, not addressed by the
Herrera majority, provide that "[a] district court may sum-marily dismiss a habeas petition only if `it plainly appears
from the face of the petition and any exhibits annexed to itthat the petitioner is not entitled to relief.' 28 U. S. C.

$ 2254 Rule 4." 506 U. S., at 445 (dissenting opinion). "If. . . the petition raises factual questions and the State has
failed to provide a full and fair hearing, the district court isrequired to hold an evidentiary hearing." Id., at 441 (emphasis added), citing Townsend v. Sain, 372 U. S. 293, 313(1963).

In this case, Blair has submitted seven affidavits tendingto show that he is innocent of the crime for which he has
been sentenced to death. The State does not dispute thatno state court remains open to hear Blair's claim. Because
Blair's affidavits raise factual questions that cannot be dis-missed summarily, the District Court erred in denying petitioner's claim without an evidentiary hearing.

June 21, 1993 509 U. S.
No. 92-7985. Guy v. Wisconsin. Sup. Ct. Wis. Certioraridenied. Reported below: 172 Wis. 2d 86, 492 N. W. 2d 311.

Justice White, with whom Justice Thomas joins, dissenting.
In this case, the Wisconsin Supreme Court held that policeexecuting a search warrant for narcotics in a private residence

were justified in frisking all persons found on the premises forweapons. Because that holding places the Wisconsin Supreme
Court in conflict with other state courts, I would grant certiorari.While executing a search warrant for cocaine at a residence,
Milwaukee police rounded up the five persons found on the prem-ises, handcuffed them, and frisked them for weapons. While patting down petitioner, an officer felt a soft bulge in petitioner'spocket that she believed to be cocaine or marijuana. The officer
asked petitioner what it was and petitioner told the officer to"[f]ind out for [her]self." The officer then reached into the pocket
and retrieved a baggie containing bindles of cocaine. In uphold-ing petitioner's conviction for possession of cocaine, the Wisconsin
Supreme Court held that the patdown search of petitioner waspermissible under Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1 (1968), and that the
seizure of the cocaine was proper under a "plain-touch corollaryto the plain-view doctrine." 172 Wis. 2d 86, 101, 492 N. W. 2d
311, 317 (1992).In holding that police had reasonable suspicion to frisk petitioner, the court below noted that "[a] magistrate had found prob-able cause to believe that cocaine trafficking was taking place in
the residence in which officers found [petitioner]" and that "weap-ons are often `tools of the trade' for drug dealers." Id., at 96,
492 N. W. 2d, at 315. Other state courts have upheld patdownsearches of persons encountered during the execution of a narcotics search warrant in a private residence on the same rationale.See, e. g., State v. Alamont, 577 A. 2d 665, 667-668 (R. I. 1990);
State v. Zearley, 444 N. W. 2d 353, 357 (N. D. 1989); People v.Thurman, 209 Cal. App. 3d 817, 824, 257 Cal. Rptr. 517, 520
(1989). Others, however, have disallowed patdown searches onessentially identical facts, holding that a defendant's " `mere presence' at a private residence being searched pursuant to a searchwarrant cannot justify a frisk of [the defendant's] person." State
v. Broadnax, 98 Wash. 2d 289, 295, 654 P. 2d 96, 101 (1982); seealso

United States v. Harvey, 897 F. 2d 1300, 1304, n. 2 (CA51990). Specifically, the courts disagree over whether this Court's

915ORDERS
June 21, 1993509 U. S.
holding in Ybarra v. Illinois, 444 U. S. 85 (1979), that police couldnot frisk all persons present in a public tavern while executing
a search warrant based merely on their presence there applieswhere a search warrant for drugs is executed in a private home.
The court below distinguished Ybarra on the grounds that occu-pants found in a private residence, unlike those found in a public
tavern, are "very likely" to be associated with any illegal narcoticsactivity on the premises and thus likely to be armed and dangerous. 172 Wis. 2d, at 98, 492 N. W. 2d, at 316; accord, Alamont,supra, at 668; Zearley, supra, at 357; Thurman, supra, at 824-825,
257 Cal. Rptr., at 520-521. The Washington Supreme Court inBroadnax, however, rejected this reasoning and held Ybarra to
be controlling. Broadnax, supra, at 295, 654 P. 2d, at 101.In my view, the issue is of significant practical importance to
law enforcement officers executing search warrants and to thecitizens they encounter while doing so. I would grant certiorari
to resolve the constitutional question.

Blackmun, J., dissenting938
Justice Blackmun, with whom Justice O'Connor joins,dissenting.

This is a case that touches the raw nerves of life's relationships.We have before us, in Jessica, a child of tender years who for her
entire life has been nurtured by the DeBoers, a loving couple ledto believe through the adoption process and the then-single biological mother's consent, that Jessica was theirs. Now, the bio-logical father appears, marries the mother, and claims paternal
status toward Jessica.The Supreme Court of Iowa has ruled that Jessica must be
returned to her biological parents regardless of whether suchaction would be in her best interests. See In re B. G. C., 496
N. W. 2d 239 (1992). Jessica, through her next friend, filed anaction in Michigan state court, claiming that she has a constitutional right to a determination of her best interests in awardingcustody. The DeBoers also filed suit, arguing that federal law
authorizes the Michigan state court to modify the custody decreeissued in Iowa since the Iowa courts did not at all consider Jessica's best interests, an argument supported by a unanimous deci-sion of the Supreme Court of New Jersey. See

E. E. B. v. D. A.,89 N. J. 595, 446 A. 2d 871 (1982), cert. denied sub nom. Angle v.

Bowen, 459 U. S. 1210 (1983). The Supreme Court of Michiganrejected the New Jersey decision and concluded that federal law
requires deference to the custody decree issued in Iowa even ifJessica's best interests are left unconsidered. See

In re Clausen,442 Mich. 648, 502 N. W. 2d 649 (1993).

Jessica, through her next friend, asks that we stay the decisionof the Supreme Court of Michigan until we have had an opportunity to review the issues presented. While I am not sure wherethe ultimate legalities or equities lie, I am sure that I am not
willing to wash my hands of this case at this stage, with thepersonal vulnerability of the child so much at risk, and with the
Supreme Court of New Jersey and the Supreme Court of Michi-gan in fundamental disagreement over the duty and authority of
state courts to consider the best interests of a child when render-ing a custody decree.

I therefore would grant the application for a stay, pending ourcareful and thoughtful consideration of the petition for certiorari
and its disposition in due course. I dissent.

OPINION OF INDIVIDUAL JUSTICEIN CHAMBERS
DEBOER, aka BABY GIRL CLAUSEN, by her next

friend, DARROW v. DEBOER et al.

on application for stay
No. A-64. Decided July 26, 1993*
Applications to stay enforcement of a Michigan Supreme Court order directing applicant DeBoers to deliver applicant child to her natural parents in Iowa are denied. There is neither a reasonable probability that
the Court will grant certiorari nor a fair prospect that, if it did so, it
would conclude that the decision below is erroneous. Determinations
made by the Iowa Supreme Court and Michigan Court of Appeals--that
the DeBoers were not entitled to adopt the child because her biological
father's parental rights had not been terminated--control this proceeding's ultimate outcome. Iowa law, Michigan law, and federal law do not
authorize unrelated persons to retain custody of a child simply because
they may be better able to provide for her future and education. There
is no valid federal objection to the conduct or outcome of the Iowa court
proceedings. When the DeBoers sought to modify the Iowa Supreme
Court's decision in the Michigan courts, rather than seeking review of
the decision, the Michigan Supreme Court correctly concluded that
Michigan courts are obligated to give effect to the Iowa proceedings.

Justice Stevens, Circuit Justice.
Applicants in No. A-65 are residents of WashtenawCounty, Michigan. On July 2, 1993, the Michigan Supreme

Court entered an order requiring them to comply with cus-tody orders that had previously been entered by the Michigan Court of Appeals and by the Iowa state courts whichhad directed them to deliver a child to its natural parents in
Iowa. They have filed an application with me in my capacity

*Together with No. A-65, DeBoer v. Schmidt, also on application for
stay.

1302 DEBOER v. DEBOER

Opinion in Chambers
as Circuit Justice for the Sixth Circuit for a stay of enforce-ment of that order. Applicant in No. A-64 is the child represented by her "next friend," who seeks the same relief.Because I am convinced that there is neither a reasonable
probability that the Court will grant certiorari nor a fair
prospect that, if it did so, it would conclude that the decisionbelow is erroneous, I have decided to deny the applications.

Respondents are the natural parents of Jessica Clausen,who was born in Iowa on February 8, 1991. When the child
was 17 days old, applicants filed a petition for adoption in theIowa courts. In the ensuing proceedings, the Iowa courts
determined that the parental rights of the child's biological
father had not been terminated in accordance with Iowa law
and that therefore applicants were not entitled to adopt the
child. For reasons that have been stated at length in
opinions of the Iowa Supreme Court, the Michigan Court of
Appeals, and the Michigan Supreme Court, those determinations control the ultimate outcome of this proceeding.
Applicants' claim that Jessica's best interests will be served
by allowing them to retain custody of her rests, in part, on
the relationship that they have been able to develop with the
child after it became clear that they were not entitled to
adopt her. Neither Iowa law, nor Michigan law, nor federal
law authorizes unrelated persons to retain custody of a child
whose natural parents have not been found to be unfit simply
because they may be better able to provide for her future
and her education. As the Iowa Supreme Court stated:
"[C]ourts are not free to take children from parents simply
by deciding another home offers more advantages." In re
B. G. C., 496 N. W. 2d 239, 241 (1992) (internal quotation
marks and citation omitted).

My examination of the opinions in the litigation persuades
me that there is no valid federal objection to the conduct or
the outcome of the proceedings in the Iowa courts. Indeed,
although applicants applied to Justice Blackmun in his capacity as Justice for the Eighth Circuit for a stay of enforce509US3IC4I 06-05-99 18:04:16 PAGES IC1301PGT

1303Cite as: 509 U. S. 1301 (1993)
Opinion in Chambers
ment of the judgment entered by the Iowa Supreme Courton September 23, 1992, they did not seek review of that judgment after he had denied the stay application. Rather thancomply with the Iowa judgment, applicants sought a modification of that judgment in the Michigan courts. In my opin-ion, the Michigan Supreme Court correctly concluded that
the Michigan courts are obligated to give effect to the Iowaproceedings. The carefully crafted opinion of the Michigan
Supreme Court contains a comprehensive and thoughtful ex-planation of the governing rules of law. Accordingly, the
stay applications will be denied.

It is so ordered.
