CASES ADJUDGED

IN THE

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

AT
OCTOBER TERM, 1999

SHALALA, SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN

SERVICES, et al. v. ILLINOIS COUNCIL ON

LONG TERM CARE, INC.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe seventh circuit

No. 98-1109. Argued November 8, 1999--Decided February 29, 2000
Under the Medicare Act's special review provisions, a nursing home that

is "dissatisfied . . . with a determination described in subsection (b)(2)"
is "entitled to a hearing . . . to the same extent as is provided in" the
Social Security Act, 42 U. S. C. $ 405(b), "and to judicial review of the
Secretary's final decision after such hearing as is provided in section
405(g) . . . ." 42 U. S. C. $ 1395cc(h)(1) (emphasis added). The crossreferenced subsection (b)(2) gives petitioner Secretary of Health and
Human Services (HHS) power to terminate a provider agreement with
a home where, for example, she determines that a home has failed to
comply substantially with the statute and the regulations. The crossreferenced $ 405(b) describes the administrative hearing to which a
"dissatisfied" home is entitled, and the cross-referenced $ 405(g) provides that the home may obtain federal district court review of the Secretary's "final decision . . . made after a hearing . . . ." Section 405(h),
a provision of the Social Security Act incorporated into the Medicare
Act by 42 U. S. C. $ 1395ii, provides that "[n]o action . . . to recover
on any claim arising under" the Medicare laws shall be "brought under
[28 U. S. C. $ ]1331." It channels most, if not all, Medicare claims
through this special review system. Respondent, the Illinois Council on Long Term Care, Inc. (Council), an association of nursing homes,

did not rely on these provisions when it filed suit against, inter alios,
petitioners (hereinafter Secretary), challenging the validity of Medicare regulations that impose sanctions or remedies on nursing homes
that violate certain substantive standards. Rather, it invoked federalquestion jurisdiction, 28 U. S. C. $ 1331. In dismissing for lack of jurisdiction, the Federal District Court found that 42 U. S. C. $ 405(h), as
interpreted in Weinberger v. Salfi, 422 U. S. 749, and Heckler v. Ringer,
466 U. S. 602, barred a $ 1331 suit. The Seventh Circuit reversed, holding that Bowen v. Michigan Academy of Family Physicians, 476 U. S.
667, had significantly modified such earlier case law.

Held: Section 405(h), as incorporated by $ 1395ii, bars federal-question

jurisdiction here. Pp. 10-25.

(a) Section 405(h) purports to make exclusive $ 405(g)'s judicial review method. While its "to recover on any claim arising under" language plainly bars $ 1331 review where an individual challenges on
any legal ground the agency's denial of a monetary benefit under the
Social Security and Medicare Acts, the question here is whether an
anticipatory challenge to the lawfulness of a policy, regulation, or statute that might later bar recovery or authorize imposition of a penalty
is also an action "to recover on any claim arising under" those Acts.
P. 10.

(b) Were the Court not to take account of Michigan Academy, $ 405(h),
as interpreted in Salfi and Ringer, would clearly bar this $ 1331 lawsuit.
The Court found in the latter cases that $ 405(h) applies where "both
the standing and the substantive basis for the presentation" of a claim
is the Social Security Act, Salfi, supra, at 760-761, or the Medicare Act,
Ringer, 466 U. S., at 615. All aspects of a present or future benefits
claim must be channeled through the administrative process. Id., at
621-622. As so interpreted, $ 405(h)'s bar reaches beyond ordinary
administrative law principles of "ripeness" and "exhaustion of administrative remedies"--doctrines that normally require channeling a legal
challenge through the agency--by preventing the application of exceptions to those doctrines. This nearly absolute channeling requirement
assures the agency greater opportunity to apply, interpret, or revise
policies, regulations, or statutes without possibly premature interference by individual courts applying "ripeness" and "exhaustion" exceptions case by case. The assurance comes at the price of occasional
individual, delay-related hardship, but paying such a price in the context of a massive, complex health and safety program such as Medicare was justified in the judgment of Congress as understood in Salfi
and Ringer. Salfi and Ringer cannot be distinguished from the instant

case. They themselves foreclose distinctions based upon the "potential future" versus "actual present" nature of the claim, the "general
legal" versus the "fact-specific" nature of the challenge, the "collateral"
versus the "noncollateral" nature of the issues, or the "declaratory"
versus "injunctive" nature of the relief sought. Nor can the Court
accept a distinction that limits $ 405(h)'s scope to claims for monetary
benefits or that involve "amounts," as neither the language nor the purposes of $ 405 support such a distinction. Neither McNary v. Haitian
Refugee Center, Inc., 498 U. S. 479, nor Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S.
319, supports the Council's effort to distinguish Salfi and Ringer. The
Court's approval of a $ 1331 suit against the Immigration and Naturalization Service in McNary rested on the different language of the
immigration statute. And Eldridge was a case in which the respondent
had complied with, not disregarded, the Social Security Act's special
review procedures--specifically the nonwaivable and nonexcusable requirement that an individual present a claim to the agency before raising it in court. The upshot is that the Council's argument must rest
primarily upon Michigan Academy. Pp. 11-15.

(c) Michigan Academy did not, contrary to the Court of Appeals'
holding, modify the Court's earlier holdings by limiting $ 405(h)'s scope,
as incorporated by $ 1395ii, to "amount determinations." That case involved the lawfulness of HHS regulations governing procedures used
to calculate Medicare Part B benefits; and the Medicare statute, as
it then existed, did not provide for $ 405(g) review of such decisions.
The Court ruled that this silence did not itself foreclose $ 1331 review.
In response to the argument that $ 405(h) barred $ 1331 review, the
Court declined to pass in the abstract on the meaning of $ 405(h) because that section was made applicable to the Medicare Act "to the
same extent as" it is applicable to the Social Security Act by virtue
of 42 U. S. C. $ 1395ii. The Court interpreted that phrase to foreclose
application of $ 405(h) where its application would preclude judicial
review rather than channel it through the agency. As limited by the
Court of Appeals, Michigan Academy would have overturned or dramatically limited earlier precedents such as Salfi and Ringer, and would
have created a hardly justifiable distinction between "amount determinations" and many similar HHS determinations. This Court does
not normally overturn, or so dramatically limit, earlier authority sub
silentio, and it did not do so here. Pp. 15-20.

(d) The Council's argument that it falls within the Michigan Academy exception because it can obtain no review at all unless it can obtain

$ 1331 review is unconvincing. It argues that review is available only
after the Secretary terminates a home's provider agreement. But in

her brief and regulations, the Secretary offers a legally permissible interpretation of the statute: that it permits a dissatisfied nursing home
to have an administrative hearing on a determination that it has failed
to comply substantially with the statute, agreements, or regulations,
whether termination or some other remedy is imposed. See, e. g., Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S.
837, 843. The Secretary also denies that she engages in any practice
that forces a home to submit a corrective plan and sacrifice appeal rights
in order to avoid termination, or that penalizes more severely a home
that chooses to appeal. Because the Council offers no convincing reason to doubt her description of the agency's practice, the Court need
not decide whether a practice that forced homes to abandon legitimate
challenges could amount to the practical equivalent of a total denial of
judicial review. If, as the Council argues, the regulations unlawfully
limit the extent to which the agency will provide the administrative
review channel leading to judicial review, its members remain free, after
following the special review route, to contest in court the lawfulness of
the relevant regulation or statute. That is true even if the agency does
not or cannot resolve the particular contention, because it is the "action"
arising under the Medicare Act that must be channeled through the
agency. The Council finally argues that, as an association speaking on
behalf of its injured members, it has no standing to take advantage of
the special review channel. However, it is the members' rights to review that are at stake, and the statutes creating the special review
channel adequately protect those rights. Pp. 20-24.

Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.
The question before us is one of jurisdiction. An associa-tion of nursing homes sued,

inter alios, the Secretary ofHealth and Human Services (HHS) and another federal

party (hereinafter Secretary) in Federal District Courtclaiming that certain Medicare-related regulations violated
various statutes and the Constitution. The association in-voked the court's federal-question jurisdiction, 28 U. S. C.

$ 1331. The District Court dismissed the suit on the groundthat it lacked jurisdiction. It believed that a set of special
statutory provisions creates a separate, virtually exclusive,system of administrative and judicial review for denials of
Medicare claims; and it held that one of those provisions ex-plicitly barred a $ 1331 suit. See 42 U. S. C. $ 1395ii (incorporating into the Medicare Act 42 U. S. C. $ 405(h), whichprovides that "[n]o action . . . to recover on any claim" arising
under the Medicare laws shall be "brought under section1331 . . . of title 28"). The Court of Appeals, however,
reversed.We conclude that the statutory provision at issue, $ 405(h),
as incorporated by $ 1395ii, bars federal-question jurisdictionhere. The association or its members must proceed instead
through the special review channel that the Medicare stat-utes create. See 42 U. S. C. $$ 1395cc(h), (b)(2)(A), 1395ii;

$$ 405(b), (g), (h).

6 SHALALA v. ILLINOIS COUNCIL ON LONG

TERM CARE, INC.

Opinion of the Court

I
A

We begin by describing the regulations that the association's lawsuit attacks. Medicare Act Part A provides payment to nursing homes which provide care to Medicare
beneficiaries after a stay in a hospital. To receive payment,
a home must enter into a provider agreement with the Secretary of HHS, and it must comply with numerous statutory
and regulatory requirements. State and federal agencies
enforce those requirements through inspections. Inspectors
report violations, called "deficiencies." And "deficiencies"
lead to the imposition of sanctions or "remedies." See generally $$ 1395i-3, 1395cc.

The regulations at issue focus on the imposition of sanctions or remedies. They were promulgated in 1994, 59 Fed.
Reg. 56116, pursuant to a 1987 law that tightened the substantive standards that Medicare (and Medicaid) imposed
upon nursing homes and that significantly broadened the
Secretary's authority to impose remedies upon violators.
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987, $$ 4201-4218,
101 Stat. 1330-160 to 1330-221 (codified as amended at 42
U. S. C. $ 1395i-3 (1994 ed. and Supp. III)).

The remedial regulations (and a related manual) in effect
tell Medicare-administering agencies how to impose remedies after inspectors find that a nursing home has violated
substantive standards. They divide a nursing home's deficiencies into three categories of seriousness depending
upon a deficiency's severity, its prevalence at the home, its
relation with other deficiencies, and the home's compliance
history. Within each category they list a set of remedies
that the agency may, or must, impose. Where, for example,
deficiencies "immediately jeopardize the health or safety
of . . . residents," the Secretary must terminate the home's
provider agreement or appoint new, temporary management. Where deficiencies are less serious, the Secretary

7Cite as: 529 U. S. 1 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
may impose lesser remedies, such as civil penalties, transferof residents, denial of some or all payment, state monitoring,

and the like. Where a nursing home, though deficient insome respects, is in "[s]ubstantial compliance," i. e., where its
deficiencies do no more than create a "potential for [causing]minimal harm," the Secretary will impose no sanction or
remedy at all. See generally 42 U. S. C. $ 1395i-3(h); 42CFR $ 488.301 (1998); $ 488.400

et seq.; App. 54, 66 (Manual).The statute and regulations also create various review procedures. 42 U. S. C. $$ 1395cc(b)(2)(A), (h); 42 CFR $ 431.151et seq. (1998); $ 488.408(g); 42 CFR pt. 498 (1998).

The association's complaint filed in Federal District Courtattacked the regulations as unlawful in four basic ways. In
its view: (1) certain terms, e. g., "substantial compliance"and "minimal harm," are unconstitutionally vague; (2) the
regulations and manual, particularly as implemented, vio-late statutory requirements seeking enforcement consistency, 42 U. S. C. $ 1395i-3(g)(2)(D), and exceed the legislativemandate of the Medicare Act; (3) the regulations create administrative procedures inconsistent with the Federal Con-stitution's Due Process Clause; and (4) the manual and other
agency publications create legislative rules that were notpromulgated consistent with the Administrative Procedure
Act's demands for "notice and comment" and a statement of"basis and purpose," 5 U. S. C. $ 553. See App. 18-19, 27-38,
43-49 (Amended Complaint).

B
We next describe the two competing jurisdictional routesthrough which the association arguably might seek to mount

its legal attack. The route it has followed, federal-questionjurisdiction, is set forth in 28 U. S. C. $ 1331, which simply
states that "district courts shall have original jurisdiction ofall civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States." The route that it did not follow,the special Medicare review route, is set forth in a complex

set of statutory provisions, which must be read together.See Appendix, infra. The Medicare Act says that a home

"dissatisfied . . . with a determination described in sub-section (b)(2) . . . shall be entitled to a hearing . . . to
the same extent as is provided in [the Social SecurityAct, 42 U. S. C. $ ]405(b) . . . and to judicial review of the
Secretary's final decision after such hearing as is pro-vided in section 405(g) . . . ." 42 U. S. C. $ 1395cc(h)(1)
(emphasis added).
The cross-referenced subsection (b)(2) gives the Secretarypower to terminate an agreement where, for example, the

Secretary

"has determined that the provider fails to comply sub-stantially with the provisions [of the Medicare Act] and

regulations thereunder . . . ." $ 1395cc(b)(2)(A) (empha-sis added).

The cross-referenced $ 405(b) describes the nature of theadministrative hearing to which the Medicare Act entitles a
home that is "dissatisfied" with the Secretary's "determina-tion." The cross-referenced $ 405(g) provides that a "dissatisfied" home may obtain judicial review in federal districtcourt of "any final decision of the [Secretary] made after a
hearing . . . ." Separate statutes provide for administrativeand judicial review of civil monetary penalty assessments.

$ 1395i-3(h)(2)(B)(ii); $$ 1320a-7a(c)(2), (e).A related Social Security Act provision, $ 405(h), channels
most, if not all, Medicare claims through this special reviewsystem. It says:

"(h) Finality of [Secretary's] decision."The findings and decision of the [Secretary] after a
hearing shall be binding upon all individuals who wereparties to such hearing. No findings of fact or decision of the [Secretary] shall be reviewed by any person,tribunal, or governmental agency except as herein pro529US1 Unit: $U32 [10-04-01 09:20:53] PAGES PGT: OPIN

vided. No action against the United States, the [Secretary], or any officer or employee thereof shall be
brought under section 1331 or 1346 [federal defendant
jurisdiction] of title 28 to recover on any claim arising
under this subchapter." (Emphasis added.)

Section 1395ii makes $ 405(h) applicable to the Medicare Act
"to the same extent as" it applies to the Social Security Act.

C
The case before us began when the Illinois Council on
Long Term Care, Inc. (Council), an association of about 200Illinois nursing homes participating in the Medicare (or

supra, at 7, in Federal District Court. (Medicaid is not at
issue in this Court.) The District Court, as we have said,dismissed the complaint for lack of federal-question jurisdiction. No. 96 C 2953 (ND Ill., Mar. 31, 1997), App. to Pet.for Cert. 13a, 15a. In doing so, the court relied upon $ 405(h)
as interpreted by this Court in Weinberger v. Salfi, 422 U. S.749 (1975), and

Heckler v. Ringer, 466 U. S. 602 (1984). App.
to Pet. for Cert. 15a-19a.

The Court of Appeals reversed the dismissal. 143 F. 3d1072 (CA7 1998). In its view, a later case,

Bowen v. Michigan Academy of Family Physicians, 476 U. S. 667 (1986),had significantly modified this Court's earlier case law.

506 U. S. 1049 (1993). We granted certiorari to resolvethose differences.

II
Section 405(h) purports to make exclusive the judicialreview method set forth in $ 405(g). Its second sentence

says that "[n]o findings of fact or decision of the [Secretary]shall be reviewed by any person, tribunal, or governmental
agency except as herein provided." $ 405(h). Its third sen-tence, directly at issue here, says that "[n]o action against
the United States, the [Secretary], or any officer or employeethereof shall be brought under section 1331 or 1346 of title
28 to recover on any claim arising under this subchapter."(Emphasis added.)

The scope of the italicized language "to recover on anyclaim arising under" the Social Security (or, as incorporated
through $ 1395ii, the Medicare) Act is, if read alone, uncer-tain. Those words clearly apply in a typical Social Security
or Medicare benefits case, where an individual seeks a mone-tary benefit from the agency (say, a disability payment, or
payment for some medical procedure), the agency denies thebenefit, and the individual challenges the lawfulness of that
denial. The statute plainly bars $ 1331 review in such acase, irrespective of whether the individual challenges the
agency's denial on evidentiary, rule-related, statutory, consti-tutional, or other legal grounds. But does the statute's bar
apply when one who might later seek money or some otherbenefit from (or contest the imposition of a penalty by) the
agency challenges in advance (in a $ 1331 action) the lawful-ness of a policy, regulation, or statute that

might later barrecovery of that benefit (or authorize the imposition of the

penalty)? Suppose, as here, a group of such individuals,needing advance knowledge for planning purposes, together
bring a $ 1331 action challenging such a rule or regulationon general legal grounds. Is such an action one "to recover
on any claim arising under" the Social Security or MedicareActs? That, in effect, is the question before us.

III
In answering the question, we temporarily put the caseon which the Court of Appeals relied,

Michigan Academy,supra, to the side. Were we not to take account of that case,

$ 405(h) as interpreted by the Court's earlier cases of Wein-berger v. Salfi, supra, and Heckler v. Ringer, supra, would
clearly bar this $ 1331 lawsuit.In Salfi, a mother and a daughter, filing on behalf of
themselves and a class of individuals, brought a $ 1331 ac-tion challenging the constitutionality of a statutory provision that, if valid, would deny them Social Security benefits.See 42 U. S. C. $$ 416(c)(5), (e)(2) (imposing a duration-ofrelationship Social Security eligibility requirement for sur-viving wives and stepchildren of deceased wage earners).
The mother and daughter had appeared before the agencybut had not completed its processes. The class presumably
included some who had, and some who had not, appearedbefore the agency; the complaint did not say. This Court
held that $ 405(h) barred $ 1331 jurisdiction for all membersof the class because "it is the Social Security Act which
provides both the standing and the substantive basis forthe presentation of th[e] constitutional contentions."

Salfi,supra, at 760-761. The Court added that the bar applies

"irrespective of whether resort to judicial processes is ne-cessitated by discretionary decisions of the Secretary or by
his nondiscretionary application of allegedly unconstitutionalstatutory restrictions." 422 U. S., at 762. It also pointed
out that the bar did not "preclude constitutional challenges,"but simply "require[d] that they be brought" under the same
"jurisdictional grants" and "in conformity with the samestandards" applicable "to nonconstitutional claims arising
under the Act." Ibid.We concede that the Court also pointed to certain special
features of the case not present here. The plaintiff class hadasked for relief that included a direction to the Secretary to
pay Social Security benefits to those entitled to them but for

Opinion of the Court

the challenged provision. See id., at 761. And the Courtthought this fact helped make clear that the action arose

"under the Act whose benefits [were] sought." Ibid. Butin a later case,

Ringer, the Court reached a similar result
despite the absence of any request for such relief. See 466U. S., at 616, 623.

In Ringer, four individuals brought a $ 1331 action challenging the lawfulness (under statutes and the Constitution)of the agency's determination not to provide Medicare

Part A reimbursement to those who had undergone a partic-ular medical operation. The Court held that $ 405(h) barred

$ 1331 jurisdiction over the action, even though the challenge
was in part to the agency's procedures, the relief requested
amounted simply to a declaration of invalidity (not an order
requiring payment), and one plaintiff had as yet no valid
claim for reimbursement because he had not even undergone
the operation and would likely never do so unless a court set
aside as unlawful the challenged agency "no reimbursement"
determination. See id., at 614-616, 621-623. The Court
reiterated that $ 405(h) applies where "both the standing and
the substantive basis for the presentation" of a claim is the
Medicare Act, id., at 615 (quoting Salfi, 422 U. S., at 760-761)
(internal quotation marks omitted), adding that a "claim for
future benefits" is a $ 405(h) "claim," 466 U. S., at 621-622,
and that "all aspects" of any such present or future claim
must be "channeled" through the administrative process, id.,
at 614. See also Your Home Visiting Nurse Services, Inc.
v. Shalala, 525 U. S. 449, 456 (1999); Califano v. Sanders, 430
U. S. 99, 103-104, n. 3 (1977).

As so interpreted, the bar of $ 405(h) reaches beyond ordinary administrative law principles of "ripeness" and "exhaustion of administrative remedies," see Salfi, supra, at
757--doctrines that in any event normally require channeling a legal challenge through the agency. See Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U. S. 136, 148-149 (1967) (ripeness);
McKart v. United States, 395 U. S. 185, 193-196 (1969) (ex529US1 Unit: $U32 [10-04-01 09:20:53] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
haustion). Indeed, in this very case, the Seventh Circuitheld that several of respondent's claims were not ripe and

remanded for ripeness review of the remainder. 143 F. 3d,at 1077-1078. Doctrines of "ripeness" and "exhaustion" contain exceptions, however, which exceptions permit early re-view when, for example, the legal question is "fit" for resolution and delay means hardship, see Abbott Laboratories,
supra, at 148-149, or when exhaustion would prove "futile,"see

McCarthy v. Madigan, 503 U. S. 140, 147-148 (1992);
McKart, supra, at 197-201. (And sometimes Congress ex-pressly authorizes preenforcement review, though not here.

See, e. g., 15 U. S. C. $ 2618(a)(1)(A) (Toxic Substances Control Act).)

Insofar as $ 405(h) prevents application of the "ripeness"
and "exhaustion" exceptions, i. e., insofar as it demands the
"channeling" of virtually all legal attacks through the
agency, it assures the agency greater opportunity to apply,
interpret, or revise policies, regulations, or statutes without possibly premature interference by different individual
courts applying "ripeness" and "exhaustion" exceptions case
by case. But this assurance comes at a price, namely, occasional individual, delay-related hardship. In the context
of a massive, complex health and safety program such as
Medicare, embodied in hundreds of pages of statutes and
thousands of pages of often interrelated regulations, any of
which may become the subject of a legal challenge in any
of several different courts, paying this price may seem justified. In any event, such was the judgment of Congress as
understood in Salfi and Ringer. See Ringer, supra, at 627;
Salfi, supra, at 762.

Despite the urging of the Council and supporting amici,
we cannot distinguish Salfi and Ringer from the case before
us. Those cases themselves foreclose distinctions based
upon the "potential future" versus the "actual present" nature of the claim, the "general legal" versus the "factspecific" nature of the challenge, the "collateral" versus

529US1 Unit: $U32 [10-04-01 09:20:53] PAGES PGT: OPIN
14 SHALALA v. ILLINOIS COUNCIL ON LONG

TERM CARE, INC.

Opinion of the Court

"noncollateral" nature of the issues, or the "declaratory" ver-sus "injunctive" nature of the relief sought. Nor can we accept a distinction that limits the scope of $ 405(h) to claimsfor monetary benefits. Claims for money, claims for other
benefits, claims of program eligibility, and claims that contesta sanction or remedy may all similarly rest upon individual
fact-related circumstances, may all similarly dispute agency
policy determinations, or may all similarly involve the appli-cation, interpretation, or constitutionality of interrelated

regulations or statutory provisions. There is no reason todistinguish among them in terms of the language or in terms
of the purposes of $ 405(h). Section 1395ii's blanket incorporation of that provision into the Medicare Act as a whole
certainly contains no such distinction. Nor for similar reasons can we here limit those provisions to claims that involve "amounts."

The Council cites two other cases in support of its efforts
to distinguish Salfi and Ringer: McNary v. Haitian Refugee Center, Inc., 498 U. S. 479 (1991), and Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319 (1976). In Haitian Refugee Center,
the Court held permissible a $ 1331 challenge to "a group
of decisions or a practice or procedure employed in making
decisions" despite an immigration statute that barred $ 1331
challenges to any Immigration and Naturalization Service
" `determination respecting an application for adjustment of
status' " under the Special Agricultural Workers' program.
498 U. S., at 491-498. Haitian Refugee Center's outcome,
however, turned on the different language of that different
statute. Indeed, the Court suggested that statutory language similar to the language at issue here--any claim "arising under" the Medicare or Social Security Acts, $ 405(h)--
would have led it to a different legal conclusion. See id., at
494 (using as an example a statute precluding review of " `all
causes . . . arising under any of ' " the immigration statutes).

In Eldridge, the Court held permissible a District Court
lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of agency proce529US1 Unit: $U32 [10-04-01 09:20:53] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
dures authorizing termination of Social Security disabilitypayments without a pretermination hearing. See 424 U. S.,

at 326-332. Eldridge, however, is a case in which the Courtfound that the respondent had followed the special review
procedures set forth in $ 405(g), thereby complying with,rather than disregarding, the strictures of $ 405(h). See
id., at 326-327 (holding jurisdiction available only under$ 405(g)). The Court characterized the constitutional issue
the respondent raised as "collateral" to his claim for bene-fits, but it did so as a basis for requiring the agency to excuse, where the agency would not do so on its own, see Salfi,422 U. S., at 766-767, some (but not all) of the procedural
steps set forth in $ 405(g). 424 U. S., at 329-332 (identifyingcollateral nature of the claim and irreparable injury as reasons to excuse $ 405(g)'s exhaustion requirements); see also
Bowen v. City of New York, 476 U. S. 467, 483-485 (1986)(noting that Eldridge factors are not to be mechanically applied). The Court nonetheless held that $ 405(g) containsthe nonwaivable and nonexcusable requirement that an individual present a claim to the agency before raising it incourt. See

Ringer, supra, at 622; Eldridge, supra, at 329;Salfi, supra, at 763-764. The Council has not done so here,

and thus cannot establish jurisdiction under $ 405(g).The upshot is that without Michigan Academy the Council
cannot win. Its precedent-based argument must rest pri-marily upon that case.

IV
The Court of Appeals held that Michigan Academy modi-fied the Court's earlier holdings by limiting the scope of

"[$]1395ii and therefore $ 405(h)" to "amount determina-tions." 143 F. 3d, at 1075-1076. But we do not agree.
Michigan Academy involved a $ 1331 suit challenging thelawfulness of HHS regulations that governed procedures
used to calculate benefits under Medicare Part B--whichPart provides voluntary supplementary medical insurance,
e. g., for doctors' fees. See 476 U. S., at 674-675; United

TERM CARE, INC.

Opinion of the Court

States v. Erika, Inc., 456 U. S. 201, 202-203 (1982). TheMedicare statute, as it then existed, provided for only limited review of Part B decisions. It allowed the equivalentof $ 405(g) review for "eligibility" determinations. See 42
U. S. C. $ 1395ff(b)(1)(B) (1982 ed.). It required private in-surance carriers (administering the Part B program) to provide a "fair hearing" for disputes about Part B "amount de-terminations." $ 1395u(b)(3)(C). But that was all.

Michigan Academy first discussed the statute's total si-lence about review of "challenges mounted against the
method by which . . . amounts are to be determined."476 U. S., at 675. It held that this silence meant that, although review was not available under $ 405(g), the silencedid not itself foreclose other forms of review, say, review in
a court action brought under $ 1331. See id., at 674-678.Cf.

Erika, supra, at 208 (holding that the Medicare Part Bstatute's explicit reference to carrier hearings for amount

disputes does foreclose all further agency or court reviewof "amount determinations").

The Court then asked whether $ 405(h) barred 28 U. S. C.$ 1331 review of challenges to methodology. Noting the Secretary's Salfi/Ringer-based argument that $ 405(h) barred$ 1331 review of

all challenges arising under the MedicareAct and the respondents' counterargument that $ 405(h)

barred challenges to "methods" only where $ 405(g) reviewwas available, see Michigan Academy, 476 U. S., at 679, the
Court wrote:

"Whichever may be the better reading of Salfi and
Ringer, we need not pass on the meaning of $ 405(h) inthe abstract to resolve this case. Section 405(h) does

not apply on its own terms to Part B of the Medicareprogram, but is instead incorporated mutatis mutandis
by $ 1395ii. The legislative history of both the statuteestablishing the Medicare program and the 1972 amendments thereto provides specific evidence of Congress'intent to foreclose review only of `amount determina529US1 Unit: $U32 [10-04-01 09:20:53] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
tions'--i. e., those [matters] . . . remitted finally and ex-clusively to adjudication by private insurance carriers

in a `fair hearing.' By the same token, matters whichCongress did not delegate to private carriers, such as
challenges to the validity of the Secretary's instruc-tions and regulations, are cognizable in courts of law."
Id., at 680 (footnote omitted).
The Court's words do not limit the scope of $ 405(h) itselfto instances where a plaintiff, invoking $ 1331, seeks review

of an "amount determination." Rather, the Court said thatit would "

not pass on the meaning of $ 405(h) in the abstract."
Ibid. (emphasis added). Instead it focused upon the Medi-care Act's cross-referencing provision, $ 1395ii, which makes

$ 405(h) applicable "to the same extent as" it is "applicable" tothe Social Security Act. (Emphasis added.) It interpreted
that phrase as applying $ 405(h) "mutatis mutandis," i. e.,"[a]ll necessary changes having been made." Black's Law
Dictionary 1039 (7th ed. 1999). And it applied $ 1395ii withone important change of detail--a change produced by not
applying $ 405(h) where its application to a particular cate-gory of cases, such as Medicare Part B "methodology" challenges, would not lead to a channeling of review through theagency, but would mean no review at all. The Court added
that a " `serious constitutional question' . . . would arise if weconstrued $ 1395ii to deny a judicial forum for constitutional
claims arising under Part B." 476 U. S., at 681, n. 12 (quot-ing

Salfi, 422 U. S., at 762 (citing Johnson v. Robison, 415U. S. 361, 366-367 (1974))).

More than that: Were the Court of Appeals correct in be-lieving that Michigan Academy limited the scope of $ 405(h)
itself to "amount determinations," that case would have sig-nificantly affected not only Medicare Part B cases but cases
arising under the Social Security Act and Medicare Part Aas well. It accordingly would have overturned or dramatically limited this Court's earlier precedents, such as Salfiand

Ringer, which involved, respectively, those programs.

TERM CARE, INC.

Opinion of the Court

It would, moreover, have created a hardly justifiable dis-tinction between "amount determinations" and many other

similar HHS determinations, see supra, at 14. And we donot understand why Congress, as

Justice Stevens believes, post, at 30-31 (dissenting opinion), would have wantedto compel Medicare patients, but not Medicare providers, to

channel their claims through the agency. Cf. Brief for Respondent 7-8, 18-21, 30-31 (apparently conceding the point).This Court does not normally overturn, or so dramatically

limit, earlier authority sub silentio. And we agree withthose Circuits that have held the Court did not do so in this
instance. See Michigan Assn. of Homes and Servs., 127
F. 3d, at 500-501; American Academy of Dermatology, 118
F. 3d, at 1499-1501; St. Francis Medical Center, 32 F. 3d, at

National Kidney Patients Assn., 958 F. 2d, at 1130-1134.

Justice Thomas maintains that Michigan Academy
"must have established," by way of a new interpretation
of $ 1395ii, the critical distinction between a dispute about
an agency determination in a particular case and a more
general dispute about, for example, the agency's authority to
promulgate a set of regulations, i. e., the very distinction that
this Court's earlier cases deny. Post, at 38 (dissenting opinion). He says that, in this respect, we have mistaken Michigan Academy's "reasoning" (the presumption against preclusion of judicial review) for its "holding." Post, at 39-40.
And, he finds the holding consistent with earlier cases such
as Ringer because, he says, in Ringer everyone simply assumed without argument that $ 1395ii's channeling provision
fully incorporated the whole of $ 405(h). Post, at 40-42.

For one thing, the language to which Justice Thomas
points simply says that "Congres[s] inten[ded] to foreclose
review only of `amount determinations' " and not "matters
which Congress did not delegate to private carriers, such as
challenges to the validity of the Secretary's instructions and
regulations," Michigan Academy, supra, at 680 (emphasis

19Cite as: 529 U. S. 1 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
added). That language refers to particular features of theMedicare Part B program--"private carriers" and "amount

determinations"--which are not here before us. And its ref-erence to "foreclosure" of review quite obviously cannot be
taken to refer to $ 1395ii because, as we have explained,$ 1395ii is a channeling requirement, not a foreclosure provision--of "amount determinations" or anything else. In
short, it is difficult to reconcile Justice Thomas' character-ization of

Michigan Academy as a holding that $ 1395ii is
"trigger[ed]" only by "challenges to . . . particular determi-nations,"

post, at 40, with the Michigan Academy language
to which he points.

Regardless, it is more plausible to read Michigan Academy as holding that $ 1395ii does not apply $ 405(h) where
application of $ 405(h) would not simply channel review
through the agency, but would mean no review at all. And
contrary to Justice Scalia's suggestion, post, at 31-32 (dissenting opinion), that single rule applies to Medicare Part A
as much as to Medicare Part B. This latter holding, as we
have said, has the virtues of consistency with Michigan
Academy's actual language; consistency with the holdings
of earlier cases such as Ringer; and consistency with the distinction that this Court has often drawn between a total
preclusion of review and postponement of review. See, e. g.,
Salfi, supra, at 762 (distinguishing $ 405(h)'s channeling requirement from the complete preclusion of judicial review
at issue in Robison, supra, at 373); Thunder Basin Coal Co.
v. Reich, 510 U. S. 200, 207, n. 8 (1994) (strong presumption
against preclusion of review is not implicated by provision
postponing review); Haitian Refugee Center, 498 U. S., at
496-499 (distinguishing between Ringer and Michigan Academy and finding the case governed by the latter because the
statute precluded all meaningful judicial review). Justice
Thomas refers to an "antichanneling" presumption (a "presumption in favor of preenforcement review," post, at 46-47).
But any such presumption must be far weaker than a pre529US1 Unit: $U32 [10-04-01 09:20:53] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court

sumption against preclusion of all review in light of the tra-ditional ripeness doctrine, which often requires initial presentation of a claim to an agency. As we have said, supra,at 13, Congress may well have concluded that a universal
obligation to present a legal claim first to HHS, though post-poning review in some cases, would produce speedier, as well
as better, review overall. And this Court crossed the rele-vant bridge long ago when it held that Congress, in both
the Social Security Act and the Medicare Act, insisted uponan initial presentation of the matter to the agency.

Ringer,466 U. S., at 627; Salfi, 422 U. S., at 762. Michigan Academy does not require that we reconsider that longstandinginterpretation.

V
The Council argues that in any event it falls within theexception that

Michigan Academy creates, for here as there,it can obtain no review at all unless it can obtain judicial

review in a $ 1331 action. In other words, the Council con-tends that application of $ 1395ii's channeling provision to
the portion of the Medicare statute and the Medicare regu-lations at issue in this case will amount to the "practical
equivalent of a total denial of judicial review." Haitian Ref-ugee Center, supra, at 497. The Council, however, has not
convinced us that is so.The Council says that the special review channel that the
Medicare statutes create applies only where the Secretary
terminates a home's provider agreement; it is not avail-able in the more usual case involving imposition of a lesser

remedy, say, the transfer of patients, the withholding of pay-ments, or the imposition of a civil monetary penalty.

We have set forth the relevant provisions, supra, at 8-9;Appendix, infra. The specific judicial review provision,

$ 405(g), authorizes judicial review of "any final decision ofthe [Secretary] made after a [$ 405(b)] hearing." A further
relevant provision, $ 1395cc(h)(1), authorizes a $ 405(b) hear-ing whenever a home is "dissatisfied . . . with a

determi529US1 Unit: $U32 [10-04-01 09:20:53] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
nation described in subsection (b)(2)." (Emphasis added.)
And subsection (b)(2) authorizes the Secretary to terminate
an agreement, whenever she "has determined that the provider fails to comply substantially with" statutes, agreements, or "regulations." $ 1395cc(b)(2)(A) (emphasis added).

The Secretary states in her brief that the relevant "determination" that entitles a "dissatisfied" home to review
is any determination that a provider has failed to comply
substantially with the statute, agreements, or regulations,
whether termination or "some other remedy is imposed."
Reply Brief for Petitioners 14 (emphasis added). The Secretary's regulations make clear that she so interprets the statute. See 42 CFR $$ 498.3(b)(12), 498.1(a)-(b) (1998). The
statute's language, though not free of ambiguity, bears that
interpretation. And we are aware of no convincing countervailing argument. We conclude that the Secretary's interpretation is legally permissible. See Chevron U. S. A. Inc.
v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837,
843 (1984); Your Home Visiting Nurse Services, 525 U. S.,
at 453; see also 42 U. S. C. $ 1395i-3(h)(2)(B)(ii) (providing a
different channel for administrative and judicial review of
decisions imposing civil monetary penalties.)

The Council next argues that the regulations, as implemented by the enforcement agencies, deny review in practice
by (1) insisting that a nursing home with deficiencies present
a corrective plan, (2) imposing no further sanction or remedy
if it does so, but (3) threatening termination if it does not.
See 42 CFR $$ 488.402(d), 488.456(b)(ii) (1998). Because a
home cannot risk termination, the Council adds, it must always submit a plan, thereby avoiding imposition of a remedy, but simultaneously losing its opportunity to contest the
lawfulness of any remedy-related rules or regulations. See

$ 498.3(b)(12). And, the Council's amici assert, compliance

Opinion of the Court

and because the agency makes deficiency findings public on
the Internet, $ 488.325.

The short, conclusive answer to these contentions is that
the Secretary denies any such practice. She states in her
brief that a nursing home with deficiencies can test the lawfulness of her regulations simply by refusing to submit a plan
and incurring a minor penalty. Minor penalties, she says,
are the norm, for "terminations from the program are rare
and generally reserved for the most egregious recidivist institutions." Reply Brief for Petitioners 18; ibid. (HHS reports that only 25 out of more than 13,000 nursing homes
were terminated in 1995-1996). She adds that the "remedy
imposed on a facility that fails to submit a plan of correction
or to correct a deficiency--and appeals the deficiency--is no
different than the remedy the Secretary ordinarily would impose in the first instance." Ibid. Nor do the regulations
"cause providers to suffer more severe penalties in later enforcement actions based on findings that are unreviewable."
Ibid. The Secretary concedes that a home's deficiencies are
posted on the Internet, but she notes that a home can post
a reply. See id., at 20, n. 20.

The Council gives us no convincing reason to doubt the
Secretary's description of the agency's general practice. We
therefore need not decide whether a general agency practice that forced nursing homes to abandon legitimate challenges to agency regulations could amount to the "practical equivalent of a total denial of judicial review," Haitian
Refugee Center, 498 U. S., at 497. Contrary to what Jus-
tice Thomas says, post, at 42-43, 51-52, we do not hold that
an individual party could circumvent $ 1395ii's channeling requirement simply because that party shows that postponement would mean added inconvenience or cost in an isolated,
particular case. Rather, the question is whether, as applied
generally to those covered by a particular statutory provision, hardship likely found in many cases turns what ap529US1 Unit: $U32 [10-04-01 09:20:53] PAGES PGT: OPIN

23Cite as: 529 U. S. 1 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
pears to be simply a channeling requirement into complete
preclusion of judicial review. See Haitian Refugee Center,
supra, at 496-497. Of course, individual hardship may be
mitigated in a different way, namely, through excusing a
number of the steps in the agency process, though not the
step of presentment of the matter to the agency. See supra,
at 14-15; infra, at 24. But again, the Council has not shown
anything other than potentially isolated instances of the inconveniences sometimes associated with the postponement
of judicial review.

The Council complains that a host of procedural regulations unlawfully limit the extent to which the agency itself
will provide the administrative review channel leading to
judicial review, for example, regulations insulating from
review decisions about a home's level of noncompliance or
a determination to impose one, rather than another, penalty. See 42 CFR $$ 431.153(b), 488.408(g)(2), 498.3(d)(10)(ii)
(1998). The Council's members remain free, however, after
following the special review route that the statutes prescribe, to contest in court the lawfulness of any regulation
or statute upon which an agency determination depends.
The fact that the agency might not provide a hearing for that
particular contention, or may lack the power to provide one,
see Sanders, 430 U. S., at 109 ("Constitutional questions obviously are unsuited to resolution in administrative hearing
procedures . . ."); Salfi, 422 U. S., at 764; Brief for Petitioners
45, is beside the point because it is the "action" arising under
the Medicare Act that must be channeled through the agency.
See Salfi, supra, at 762. After the action has been so channeled, the court will consider the contention when it later
reviews the action. And a court reviewing an agency determination under $ 405(g) has adequate authority to resolve
any statutory or constitutional contention that the agency
does not, or cannot, decide, see Thunder Basin Coal, 510

U. S., at 215, and n. 20; Haitian Refugee Center, supra, at
494; Ringer, 466 U. S., at 617; Salfi, supra, at 762, including,
where necessary, the authority to develop an evidentiary
record.

Proceeding through the agency in this way provides the
agency the opportunity to reconsider its policies, interpretations, and regulations in light of those challenges. Nor need
it waste time, for the agency can waive many of the procedural steps set forth in $ 405(g), see Salfi, supra, at 767, and
a court can deem them waived in certain circumstances, see
Eldridge, 424 U. S., at 330-331, even though the agency technically holds no "hearing" on the claim. See Salfi, supra,
at 763-767 (holding that Secretary's decision not to challenge the sufficiency of the appellees' exhaustion was in effect a determination that the agency had rendered a "final
decision" within the meaning of $ 405(g)); Eldridge, supra,
at 331-332, and n. 11 (invoking practical conception of finality to conclude that collateral nature of claim and potential irreparable injury from delayed review satisfy the "final
decision" requirement of $ 405(g)). At a minimum, however,
the matter must be presented to the agency prior to review
in a federal court. This the Council has not done.

Finally, the Council argues that, because it is an association, not an individual, it cannot take advantage of the special
review channel, for the statute authorizes review through
that channel only at the request of a "dissatisfied" "institution or agency." 42 U. S. C. $ 1395cc(h)(1). The Council
speaks only on behalf of its member institutions, and thus has
standing only because of the injury those members allegedly
suffer. See Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520
U. S. 43, 65-66 (1997); Hunt v. Washington State Apple Advertising Comm'n, 432 U. S. 333, 343 (1977). It is essentially
their rights to review that are at stake. And the statutes
that create the special review channel adequately protect
those rights.

While I join Justice Thomas' lucid dissent without quali-fication, I think it worthwhile to identify a significant distinction between cases like Weinberger v. Salfi, 422 U. S.749 (1975), and Heckler v. Ringer, 466 U. S. 602 (1984), on
the one hand, and cases like Bowen v. Michigan Academyof Family Physicians, 476 U. S. 667 (1986), and this case,
on the other hand. In the former group, the issue con-cerned the plaintiffs' entitlement to benefits; in the latter
two, the issue concerns providers' eligibility for reimbursement. The distinction between those two types of issuesmirrors a critical distinction between the Social Security

Act, 42 U. S. C. $ 405, and the Medicare Act, 42 U. S. C.$ 1395ii.

Scalia, J., dissenting
Disputed claims for Social Security benefits always pre-sent a simple two-party dispute in which the claimant is

seeking a monetary benefit from the Government. A pro-ceeding under $ 405 is correctly described as an action "to
recover on any claim arising under this subchapter. "$ 405(h). Disputed claims under the Medicare Act, however, typically involve three parties--the patient, the provider, and the Secretary. When the issue involves a disputeover the patient's entitlement to benefits, it is fairly characterized as an action "to recover" on a claim that is parallelto a claim for Social Security benefits. The language in

$ 1395ii that makes $ 405(h) applicable to the Medicare Act"to the same extent as" it applies to the Social Security Act
thus encompasses claims by patients, but does not neces-sarily encompass providers' challenges to the Secretary's
regulations.In

Ringer, the Court, in effect (and, in my view, erroneously), treated the patients' claim as a premature action"to recover" benefits that was subject to the strictures in

$ 405(h). See 466 U. S., at 620. But in this case, as in Michigan Academy, the plaintiffs are providers, not patients.Their challenges to the Secretary's regulations simply do not

fall within the "to recover" language of $ 405(h) that wasobviously drafted to describe pecuniary claims. The incorporation of that language into the Medicare Act via $ 1395iiprovides no textual support for the Court's decision today.
Moreover, contrary to the Court's "Pandora's box" rhetoric,
ante, at 17-18, adherence to the plain meaning of "to recover" would not make it necessary for the Court to revisit
any of its earlier cases. For this reason, as well as the reasons set forth by Justice Thomas, I find nothing in the
relevant statutory text that should be construed to bar
this action.

Justice Scalia, dissenting.

of that vote: I am doubtful whether Bowen v. Michigan
Academy of Family Physicians, 476 U. S. 667 (1986), was
correctly decided, but that case being on the books, andinvolving as it does a question of statutory interpretation,

I believe it requires affirmance here. There is in my viewneither any basis for holding that 42 U. S. C. $ 1395ii has a
different meaning with regard to Part A than with regard
to Part B, nor (since repeals by implication are disfavored)any basis for holding that the subsequent addition of a

judicial-review provision distantly related to $ 1395ii alteredthe meaning we had authoritatively pronounced. See

post,
at 38, n. 7 (Thomas, J., dissenting).I do not join Part III of

Justice Thomas's opinion because its reliance upon what it calls the presumption of preenforcement review suggests that Michigan Academy was
(a fortiori) correctly decided. I might have thought, as an
original matter, that the categorical language of $$ 1395ii and
405(h) overcame even what Justice Thomas acknowledges
is the stronger presumption of some judicial review. See
post, at 45. With regard to the timing of review, I would
not even use the word "presumption" (a term which Abbott
Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U. S. 136 (1967), applies only to
the preference for judicial review at some point, see id., at
140), since that suggests that some unusually clear statement
is required by way of negation. In my view, preenforcement
review is better described as the background rule, which can
be displaced by any reasonable implication ("persuasive reason to believe," as Abbott Laboratories put it, ibid.) from
the statute.

Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Stevens and
Justice Kennedy join, and with whom Justice Scalia
joins except as to Part III, dissenting.

Unlike the majority, I take no position on how 42 U. S. C.

$ 405(h) applies to respondent's suit. That section is beside
the point in this case because it does not apply of its own

force to the Medicare Act, but only by virtue of 42 U. S. C.$ 1395ii, the Medicare Act's incorporating reference to

$ 405(h).1 I read Bowen v. Michigan Academy of FamilyPhysicians, 476 U. S. 667 (1986), to hold that this incorporating reference is triggered when a particular fact-bounddetermination is in dispute, but not in the case, as here, of a
"challeng[e] to the validity of the Secretary's instructionsand regulations."

Id., at 680. Though this (or any) inter-pretation of $ 1395ii is not entirely free from doubt in light

of the arguable tension between Michigan Academy and ourearlier decision in Heckler v. Ringer, 466 U. S. 602 (1984),
I would resolve such doubt by following our longstandingpresumption in favor of preenforcement judicial review. Accordingly, I would hold that $ 405(h) does not apply to re-spondent's challenge, and therefore does not preclude respondent from bringing suit under general federal-questionjurisdiction, 28 U. S. C. $ 1331.

I
A

Michigan Academy was the first time we discussed themeaning of $ 1395ii. In earlier Medicare Act cases where

the plaintiffs had sought to proceed under general federal-question jurisdiction, we either had no need to address

$ 1395ii, or assumed in passing (and without discussion) that$ 1395ii always incorporates $ 405(h).

Our decision in United States v. Erika, Inc., 456 U. S. 201(1982), involved the former situation. We dealt there with
a Part B dispute over the appropriate amount of reimburse-ment for certain medical supplies.

2 The statute provided

1 Section 1395ii provides in relevant part that the provisions of $ 405(h)
"shall also apply with respect to [the Medicare Act] to the same extent as
they are applicable with respect to [the Social Security Act]."

2 Part B of the Medicare Act provides voluntary supplemental insurance

coverage to eligible individuals for certain physician charges and medical
services that are not covered by Part A. Individuals' Part B benefits

for the determination of benefit amounts to be made by a
private insurance carrier designated by the Secretary, and
authorized de novo review of the initial determination by
another officer designated by the carrier. Id., at 203 (citing
42 U. S. C. $ 1395u (1982 ed.)). But the statutory scheme
did not mention the possibility of judicial review of Part B
benefit amount determinations, much less review by the
Secretary. By contrast, the statute did expressly provide
for administrative review by the Secretary and judicial review in two instances: disputes concerning the claimant's
eligibility for benefits under Part A or Part B, and disputes
over benefit amount determinations under Part A. 456
U. S., at 207 (citing 42 U. S. C. $ 1395ff (1982 ed.)). We found
this contrast illuminating: "In the context of the statute's
precisely drawn provisions, this omission provides persuasive evidence that Congress deliberately intended to
foreclose further review of [Part B benefit amount determinations]." 456 U. S., at 208.3 The inference was strong
enough that we had no need to discuss the Government's
alternative contention that $ 405(h) expressly precluded a
claim under general jurisdictional provisions. See id., at
206, n. 6. We therefore had no occasion to decide whether

$ 1395ii even incorporates $ 405(h) into the Medicare Act.
(So too in Weinberger v. Salfi, 422 U. S. 749 (1975), we did
not need to interpret $ 1395ii, but for a different and more
obvious reason: Salfi was a Social Security case, not a Medicare case, so $ 405(h) was directly applicable.)

claims are routinely assigned to providers of services, who then seek
reimbursement.

3 Our decision in Erika illustrates the longstanding principle that a

statute whose provisions are finely wrought may support the preclusion of judicial review, even though that preclusion is only by negative
implication. See, e. g., United States v. Fausto, 484 U. S. 439, 452 (1988);
Block v. Community Nutrition Institute, 467 U. S. 340, 351 (1984);

Our opinion in Ringer was equally silent on the meaning
of $ 1395ii, this time assuming in passing that it operates
as a garden variety incorporating reference of $ 405(h),4 an
assumption shared by the parties to the case, see Brief
for Petitioners 18, 22, and Brief for Respondents 26-29, in
Heckler v. Ringer, O. T. 1983, No. 82-1772. Ringer involved
a dispute over reimbursement for a surgical procedure under
Part A of the Act, see 466 U. S., at 608-609, n. 4, so, unlike
in Erika (which involved Part B), it was clear that the individual plaintiffs could seek judicial review under $ 1395ff
(via $ 405(g)) after they had presented a claim for benefits to
the Secretary and suffered an unfavorable final decision.
But the plaintiffs chose not to follow this route to review.
Instead, they attempted to challenge the Secretary's policy
prohibiting reimbursement for the surgery as violating constitutional due process and several statutory provisions, invoking general federal-question jurisdiction.5 As noted, we
assumed that $ 1395ii incorporates $ 405(h) in the situation
of a preenforcement challenge to the Secretary's Medicare
Act regulations and policies, and held that $ 405(h)'s third
sentence--"No action against the United States, the [Secretary], or any officer or employee thereof shall be brought
under section 1331 or 1346 of title 28 to recover on any claim
arising under this subchapter"--expressly precluded Ringer's suit. Ringer, 466 U. S., at 615-616.

4 See Heckler v. Ringer, 466 U. S. 602, 614-615 (1984) ("The third sentence of 42 U. S. C. $ 405(h), made applicable to the Medicare Act by 42
U. S. C. $ 1395ii, provides that $ 405(g), to the exclusion of 28 U. S. C.

$ 1331, is the sole avenue for judicial review for all `claim[s] arising under'
the Medicare Act" (alteration in original)).

5 The plaintiffs also asserted, to no avail, that the District Court had

jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C. $ 1361 (mandamus) and 42 U. S. C. $ 1395ff
(1982 ed. and Supp. II) (judicial review of Part A benefit amount determinations). See Ringer, supra, at 617-618.

B
We squarely addressed $ 1395ii for the first time in our
1986 decision in Bowen v. Michigan Academy of Family
Physicians, 476 U. S. 667. The Secretary had adopted a
regulation that authorized the payment of Part B benefits in
different amounts for similar physicians' services. An association of family physicians and several individual doctors
filed suit to challenge this regulation. Id., at 668. These
plaintiffs asserted no concrete claim to Part B benefits, for
judicial review of such a claim was clearly foreclosed by the
statute as interpreted in Erika; they instead invoked
federal-question jurisdiction. Our unanimous opinion 6 in
their favor began by rejecting the Secretary's contention
that the provisions construed in Erika impliedly precluded
review not only of benefit amount determinations under
Part B, but also of challenges against the Secretary's methodologies for determining such amounts. 476 U. S., at 673.
The "precisely drawn" provisions on which we had focused

We then turned to the Secretary's argument that $ 405(h),
incorporated by $ 1395ii into the Medicare Act, expressly
precludes a claimant from resorting to general federalquestion jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C. $ 1331. The Secretary contended that under Salfi, supra, at 756-762, and
Ringer, supra, at 614-616, "the third sentence of $ 405(h) by
its terms prevents any resort to the grant of general
federal-question jurisdiction contained in 28 U. S. C. $ 1331."

third sentence precludes use of $ 1331 only when Congress

"Whichever may be the better reading of Salfi andRinger, we need not pass on the meaning of $ 405(h) in
the abstract to resolve this case. Section 405(h) doesnot apply on its own terms to Part B of the Medicare
program, but is instead incorporated mutatis mutandisby $ 1395ii. The legislative history of both the statute
establishing the Medicare program and the 1972 amend-ments thereto provides specific evidence of Congress' intent to foreclose review only of `amount determina-tions'--

i. e., those `quite minor matters,' 118 Cong. Rec.33992 (1972) (remarks of Sen. Bennett), remitted finally

and exclusively to adjudication by private insurancecarriers in a `fair hearing.' By the same token, matters
which Congress did not delegate to private carriers,such as challenges to the validity of the Secretary's
instructions and regulations, are cognizable in courtsof law. In the face of this persuasive evidence of legislative intent, we will not indulge the Government'sassumption that Congress contemplated review by carriers of `trivial' monetary claims, ibid., but intended noreview at all of substantial statutory and constitutional
challenges to the Secretary's administration of Part B ofthe Medicare program."

We accordingly held that the physicians' challenge to theSecretary's regulation could proceed under general federalquestion jurisdiction. C

In light of the quoted passage, it is beyond dispute thatour holding in Michigan Academy rested squarely on the
meaning of $ 1395ii. Accord, ante, at 17. Under Michi-gan Academy, a case involving an "amount determinatio[n]"
would trigger $ 1395ii's incorporation of $ 405(h), and thusbar federal-question jurisdiction; a "challeng[e] to the valid529US1 Unit: $U32 [10-04-01 09:20:53] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ity of the Secretary's instructions and regulations" wouldnot. 476 U. S., at 680.

This dichotomy does not translate exactly to the instantcase, the majority tells us, because the Secretary's determination to terminate a nursing home's provider agreement,see 42 U. S. C. $ 1395cc(b) (1994 ed. and Supp. III), in no
sense resembles the determination of an "amount" of anindividual's benefits under Part A or B, see $ 1395ff. Therefore, the majority concludes, Michigan Academy's interpre-tation of $ 1395ii simply does not bear on respondent's challenge to the Secretary's regulations here. See ante, at 20.

But $ 1395ii applies to more than just $ 1395ff, the pro-vision concerning benefit amounts; it applies, rather, to

the entire Medicare Act, including $ 1395cc, the provisionconcerning provider agreements that

is directly at issue
here. And we have "stron[g] cause to construe a singleformulation . . . the same way each time it is called into

play." Ratzlaf v. United States, 510 U. S. 135, 143 (1994).Accordingly, the interpretation of $ 1395ii that we announced
in Michigan Academy must have a more general import
than a distinction between Part B benefits determinations,on the one hand, and Part B methods guiding such determinations, on the other. Michigan Academy must have es-tablished a distinction between, on the one hand, a dispute
over any particularized determination and, on the otherhand, a "challeng[e] to the validity of the Secretary's instructions and regulations," 476 U. S., at 680.7 The former trig-gers $ 1395ii's incorporation of $ 405(h); the latter does not.

This case obviously falls into the latter category. Re-spondent in no way disputes any particularized determina7 For this reason, it is beside the point that Congress amended $ 1395ff
after Michigan Academy to make express provision for administrative
and judicial review of Part B benefits claims. See Pub. L. 99-509,

$ 9341(a)(1)(B), 100 Stat. 2037. Congress has not substantively amended

$ 1395ii since Michigan Academy, and so Michigan Academy's gloss on

$ 1395ii deserves as much stare decisis respect today as it ever has.

tions, but instead mounts a general challenge to the Secre-tary's regulations (and manual) prescribing inspection and

enforcement procedures for the teams that survey participat-ing nursing homes, 59 Fed. Reg. 56116 (1994), claiming that
these were promulgated without notice and comment, areunconstitutionally vague, contravene the Medicare Act's requirement of enforcement consistency, and violate due proc-ess by affording insufficient administrative review. Like the
Michigan Academy plaintiffs, who challenged the Secre-tary's regulation concerning the payment of benefits for physicians' services, 476 U. S., at 668, respondent may proceedin District Court under general federal-question jurisdiction.

Perhaps recognizing that this result follows straight-forwardly from what our

Michigan Academy opinion actu-ally says, the majority creatively recasts that decision as

having established an exception to $ 1395ii's incorporation of$ 405(h): Section 1395ii will not apply "where its application
to a particular category of cases, such as Medicare Part B`methodology' challenges, would not lead to a channeling of
review through the agency, but would mean no review atall."

Ante, at 17. In doing so, the Court confuses the rea-soning (more precisely, one half of the reasoning) of Michigan Academy with the holding in that case. In MichiganAcademy, we undoubtedly relied on the reality that, if the
challenge to the Secretary's regulations were not allowedto proceed under general federal-question jurisdiction, the
Secretary's administration of Part B benefit amount deter-minations would be entirely insulated from judicial review, a
result in tension with the " `strong presumption that Con-gress did not mean to prohibit all judicial review' of executive action." 8 476 U. S., at 681 (quoting Dunlop v.

of the two rationales for the holding in Michigan Academy. My reading

to the Medicare Act, see 476 U. S., at 680, and our holdingwas that challenges to particular determinations would trigger $ 1395ii, whereas challenges to the Secretary's instruc-tions and regulations governing particular determinations
would not, ibid.; see supra, at 38. Indeed, in setting aside
the physicians' argument that $ 405(h) bars general federal-question jurisdiction only when Congress has provided

"specific procedures . . . for judicial review of final actionby the Secretary,"

Michigan Academy, supra, at 679-680,
we expressly declined to decide the case by announcing the
"exception" suggested by the majority. While we might
have done so, cf. Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319, 328-

330 (1976) (describing limited exception to $ 405(g)'s requirement that Secretary's decision be "final" before judicial review may be sought), we simply did not phrase our holding
in those terms.

II

To be sure, the reading of Michigan Academy that I would
adopt (and that the Court of Appeals adopted below, 143
F. 3d 1072, 1075-1076 (CA7 1998)), dictates a different result
in the earlier Ringer case. In Ringer, recall, the respondents were individual Medicare claimants who brought a challenge to the Secretary's policy regarding payment of Medicare benefits for a specific surgical procedure. As noted, we
(and the parties) simply assumed that $ 1395ii's incorporating
reference to $ 405(h) was triggered by such a challenge, and
proceeded directly to decide the case based on $ 405(h). And
yet, under Michigan Academy's gloss on $ 1395ii, we would
never have reached $ 405(h) because $ 1395ii would not have

But it is one thing to conclude that the result in Ringerwould have been different had we applied Michigan Academy's $ 1395ii analysis to that case; it is quite another to de-clare that Michigan Academy effected a sub silentio overruling of Ringer. Contrary to the majority's representation,
ante, at 18, my approach entails only the former, and there-fore does not offend stare decisis principles as a sub silentio

overruling would. As noted, supra, at 35, our opinion inRinger did not expressly decide the meaning of $ 1395ii, assuming instead (as the parties had done) that $ 1395ii func-tions as a garden variety incorporating reference, i. e., that

$ 1395ii incorporates $ 405(h) in every case involving theMedicare Act. Accordingly, "[t]he most that can be said is
that the point was in the cas[e] if anyone had seen fit toraise it. Questions which merely lurk in the record, neither
brought to the attention of the court nor ruled upon, are
not to be considered as having been so decided as to consti-tute precedents."

of Michigan Academy implies a different result in Ringer, I fail to comprehend the majority's assertion that my view of Michigan Academy
also implies a different result in Weinberger v. Salfi, 422 U. S. 749 (1975).
See ante, at 18-19. As noted, supra, at 34, Salfi was a Social Security
case, and so $ 405(h) applied of its own force.

Our post-Michigan Academy cases are entirely consistent with my
reading of Michigan Academy. For example, in Your Home Visiting
Nurse Services, Inc. v. Shalala, 525 U. S. 449 (1999), the challenge was
directed to a particular determination of reimbursement benefits, and
we held that $ 405(h), as incorporated into the Medicare Act by $ 1395ii,
precluded resort to general federal-question jurisdiction.

point that Ringer did not decide. The majority opinion cantherefore claim no support from its asserted "consistency

with the holdings of earlier cases such as Ringer." Ante,at 19.

Ringer simply does not constitute a holding on the
meaning of $ 1395ii; or if it does, the majority has engagedin the very practice it condemns--a

sub silentio overruling
(of Webster v. Fall, supra).

Moreover, the majority's criticism of my approach as de-claring a

sub silentio overruling is just as well directed at
itself, for Ringer is no less overruled by the majority's viewof

Michigan Academy than by my own. According to the
majority, the Michigan Academy "exception" to $ 1395ii applies where the aggrieved party "can obtain no review at all
unless it can obtain judicial review in a $ 1331 action." Ante,
at 20. Consider how this test would apply to Freeman
Ringer, one of the four plaintiffs in Ringer. Ringer sought
to challenge the Secretary's policy proscribing reimbursement for a certain type of surgery (a Part A benefits issue),
invoking general federal-question jurisdiction. He had no
concrete reimbursement claim to present, for he did not
possess the financial means to pay for the surgery up front
and await reimbursement. Nor, apparently, could he obtain
private financing for the surgery. See Ringer, 466 U. S., at
620; id., at 637, n. 24 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
in part and dissenting in part) ("Ringer would like nothing
more than to give the Secretary [the] opportunity [to rule
on a concrete claim for reimbursement]"); Brief for Petitioners 42-43, n. 23. It seems to me that Ringer is the paradigmatic example of a party who "can obtain no review at all
unless [he] can obtain judicial review in a $ 1331 action,"
ante, at 20, such that he plainly would qualify for the Michigan Academy exception to $ 1395ii as described by the
majority.

The majority purports to reaffirm Ringer in toto, but it
does so only by revising that case to hold that Ringer, notwithstanding his own inability to obtain judicial review with529US1 Unit: $U32 [10-04-01 09:20:53] PAGES PGT: OPIN

out an anticipatory challenge, did not qualify for the Michi-gan Academy exception to $ 1395ii because others in his

class could afford to pursue review by undergoing the sur-gery and presenting a concrete claim for reimbursement.
See ante, at 12. Setting aside the peculiarity of interpretinga statute to deny judicial review to the poor with the promise
that the rich will obtain review in their stead,10 the ma-jority's gloss on

Ringer ignores the Ringer Court's own de-scription of its holding. In rejecting plaintiff Ringer's attempt to use $ 1331, the Ringer Court did not rely on somenotion that Ringer or those similarly situated to him could
as a practical matter seek judicial review through somemeans other than $ 1331; the Court instead reasoned that
Ringer's claim was "essentially one requesting the paymentof benefits for [a particular] surgery, a claim cognizable only
under $ 405(g)." 466 U. S., at 620.

III
It would overstate matters to say that the foregoing analy-sis demonstrates beyond question that respondent may invoke general federal-question jurisdiction. Any remainingdoubt is resolved, however, by the longstanding canon that
"judicial review of executive action `will not be cut off unlessthere is persuasive reason to believe that such was the purpose of Congress.' " Gutierrez de Martinez v. Lamagno,515 U. S. 417, 424 (1995) (quoting Abbott Laboratories v.
Gardner, 387 U. S. 136, 140 (1967)). See also, e. g., McNaryv. Haitian Refugee Center, Inc., 498 U. S. 479, 496 (1991);

10 The majority attempts to soften the blow by explaining that "individual hardship may be mitigated in a different way, namely, through
excusing a number of the steps in the agency process, though not the step
of presentment of the matter to the agency." Ante, at 23 (emphasis
added). But the italicized words show why the majority's concession provides cold comfort to a plaintiff like Ringer--or, arguably, the nursing
homes represented by respondent here, see ante, at 21-22--who cannot
afford to present a concrete claim to the agency, and thus can obtain
neither administrative nor judicial review.

The rationale for this "presumption," Abbott Laboratories,supra, at 140, is straightforward enough: Our constitutional
structure contemplates judicial review as a check on adminis-trative action that is in disregard of legislative mandates or
constitutional rights. As Chief Justice Marshall explained:

" `It would excite some surprise if, in a government oflaws and of principle, furnished with a department

whose appropriate duty it is to decide questions of right,not only between individuals, but between the government and individuals; a ministerial officer might, athis discretion, issue this powerful process . . . leaving to
[the claimant] no remedy, no appeal to the laws of hiscountry, if he should believe the claim to be unjust. But
this anomaly does not exist; this imputation cannot becast on the legislature of the United States.' " United
States v. Nourse, 9 Pet. 8, 28-29 (1835) (as quoted inGutierrez de Martinez, supra, at 424).

See also S. Breyer, R. Stewart, C. Sunstein, & M. Spitzer,Administrative Law and Regulatory Policy 832 (4th ed. 1999)
(suggesting that "the presumption of review owes its sourceto considerations of accountability and legislative supremacy,
ideas embodied in article I, and also to rule of law consid-erations, embodied in the due process clause"); Michigan
Academy, supra, at 681-682, n. 12 (noting that interpretingstatute to allow judicial review would avoid the serious
constitutional issue that would arise if a judicial forum forconstitutional claims were denied).

enacting the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), which "embodies the
basic presumption of judicial review to one `suffering legal wrong because
of agency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action

Contrary to the Secretary's representation, Brief for Pe-titioners 31-32, the presumption favors not merely judicial

review "at some point," but preenforcement judicial review.While it is true that the presumption may not be quite as
strong when the question is now-or-later instead of now-or-never, see Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U. S. 200,
207, n. 8, 215, n. 20 (1994), our cases clearly establish that thepresumption applies in the former context. Indeed,

AbbottLaboratories, the "important case . . . which marks the recent era of increased access to judicial review," Breyer,supra, at 831, itself involved a preenforcement challenge to
a regulation. Although the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act(FDCA) did not authorize a preenforcement challenge to
the type of regulation the Secretary had issued, and indeedexpressly enumerated certain other kinds of regulations for
which preenforcement review was available, we explainedthat these indicia of congressional intent must be viewed
through the lens of the presumption:

"The first question we consider is whether Congress bythe [FDCA] intended to forbid pre-enforcement review

of this sort of regulation promulgated by the Com-missioner. The question is phrased in terms of `prohibition' rather than `authorization' because a survey ofour cases shows that judicial review of a final agency
action by an aggrieved person will not be cut off unlessthere is persuasive reason to believe that such was the
purpose of Congress." Abbott Laboratories, 387 U. S.,at 139-140.

We thus held that the suit could proceed. Id., at 148.More recently, in Haitian Refugee Center, we reaffirmed
the applicability of the presumption in the context of a pre-enforcement challenge. At issue in that case was the constitutionality of the Immigration and Naturalization Service's
within the meaning of a relevant statute.' " Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U. S. 136, 140 (1967) (quoting 5 U. S. C. $ 702 (1964 ed., Supp. III)).

(INS) procedures for administering an amnesty programfor illegal aliens. Despite the availability of judicial review

of these procedures in the context of statutorily authorizedreview of orders of exclusion or deportation, and notwithstanding the statute's express prohibition of judicial re-view of an INS "determination respecting an application
for adjustment of status [under the amnesty program]," 8
U. S. C. $ 1160(e)(1), we held that these factors did not suf-fice to trump the "strong presumption in favor of judicial

review of administrative action." Haitian Refugee Center,498 U. S., at 498.

The majority declines to employ the presumption in
favor of preenforcement review to resolve the ambiguity

in $ 1395ii; instead, it concocts a presumption against preenforcement review, stating that its holding is "consisten[t]
with the distinction that this Court has often drawn between
a total preclusion of review and postponement of review."
Ante, at 19 (citing Salfi, 422 U. S., at 762; Thunder Basin
Coal, supra, at 207, n. 8; Haitian Refugee Center, supra, at
496-499). But Thunder Basin Coal, as noted, supra, at 45,
teaches only that the presumption is not as strong when the
problem is one of delayed judicial review rather than complete denial of judicial review--it does not establish that the
presumption lacks any force in the former context. And
Haitian Refugee Center directly supports the applicability
of the presumption in favor of preenforcement review; we
there invoked the presumption even though the plaintiffs had
a postenforcement review option--voluntarily surrendering
themselves for deportation and availing themselves of the
statutorily authorized judicial review of an order of exclusion or deportation. 498 U. S., at 496. Only Salfi provides
the majority with modest support insofar as it acknowledged
(and distinguished) just the presumption against the complete denial of judicial review, 422 U. S., at 762, omitting mention of the presumption against delayed judicial review. But
this omission is readily explained: Presentment of a Social

Security benefits claim for purposes of 42 U. S. C. $ 405(g) isaccomplished by the near-costless act of filing an application

for benefits, to be contrasted with the extremely burden-some presentment requirement facing the aliens in

Haitian
Refugee Center or the named plaintiff in Ringer. The onlysignificant hardship facing the claimants in

Salfi arose from
the possibility that a lengthy administrative review process would postpone a judicial decision ordering the Secre-tary to pay the disputed benefits; but the Court took care

of that problem by leniently construing $ 405(g)'s require-ment of a "final" agency decision and by allowing the Secretary to waive entirely $ 405(g)'s requirement that decision
be made "after a hearing." At bottom, then, the majority cannot demonstrate why the presumption in favor of
preenforcement review, which dates at least from Abbott
Laboratories, should not be invoked to resolve the debate
between our conflicting readings of $ 1395ii.

There is a practical reason why we employ the presumption not only to questions of whether judicial review
is available, but also to questions of when judicial review is available. Delayed review--that is, a requirement
that a regulated entity disobey the regulation, suffer an
enforcement proceeding by the agency, and only then seek
judicial review--may mean no review at all. For when
the costs of "presenting" a claim via the delayed review
route exceed the costs of simply complying with the regulation, the regulated entity will buckle under and comply,
even when the regulation is plainly invalid. See Seidenfeld,
Playing Games with the Timing of Judicial Review, 58 Ohio
St. L. J. 85, 104 (1997). And we can expect that this consequence will often flow from an interpretation of an ambiguous statute to bar preenforcement review. In Haitian
Refugee Center, for example, the aliens' "postenforcement"
review option for asserting their challenge to the agency's
procedures required the aliens to voluntarily surrender
themselves for deportation, suffer an order of deporta529US1 Unit: $U32 [10-04-01 09:20:53] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tion, and seek judicial review of that order in the court ofappeals. These costs of presentment, we explained, were

"[q]uite obviously . . . tantamount to a complete denial ofjudicial review for most undocumented aliens." 498 U. S.,
at 496-497.A similar predicament faces the nursing homes represented by respondent in the instant case, who contend that
the Secretary's regulations (and manual) governing en-forcement of substantive standards are unlawful in various

respects. The nursing homes' "postenforcement" reviewroute is delineated by 42 U. S. C. $ 1395cc(h)(1), which provides that "an institution or agency dissatisfied . . . with
a determination described in subsection (b)(2) of this section shall be entitled to a hearing thereon by the Secretary
(after reasonable notice) to the same extent as is provided
in section 405(b) of this title, and to judicial review of the
Secretary's final decision after such hearing as is provided
in section 405(g) of this title." While the meaning of "determination" in the referenced 42 U. S. C. $ 1395cc(b)(2) (1994
ed., Supp. III) is not entirely free from doubt, the Secretary
has interpreted these provisions to mean that administrative
and judicial review is afforded for "any determination that a
provider has failed to comply substantially with the statute,
agreements, or regulations, whether termination or `some
other remedy is imposed.' " Ante, at 21 (quoting Reply Brief
for Petitioners 14 (emphasis in original)). Still, even under
the Secretary's reading, an inspection team's assessment of
a deficiency (for noncompliance) against the nursing home
does not suffice to trigger administrative and judicial review
under $ 1395cc(h). Presentment of a claim via $ 1395cc(h) requires the nursing home not merely to expose itself to an
assessment of a deficiency by an inspection team, but also
to forbear correction of the deficiency until the Secretary
(or her state designees) impose a remedy.

Respondent and its amici advance several plausible reasons why such forbearance will prove costly--indeed, costly

Thomas, J., dissenting
enough that compliance with the challenged regulations
and manual is the more rational option. For one, nursing
homes face the prospect of termination--the most severe of
remedies--simply by virtue of failing to submit a voluntary
plan of correction and correct the deficiencies. See 42 CFR

$ 488.456(b)(1) (1998). The Secretary's only response is that
terminations are rarely imposed in fact, and certainly are
not imposed where the provider has postponed correction
of its deficiencies in order to preserve its appeal rights. But
any such leniency is solely a matter of grace by the Secretary, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 31, and provides little comfort to
a nursing facility pondering the $ 1395cc(h) route to judicial
review. And exposure to the termination remedy is not the
only consequence faced by a nursing home that forestalls
correction of its deficiencies. The Secretary also may impose civil monetary penalties, which accrue for each day
of noncompliance, 42 CFR $$ 488.430, 488.440(b) (1998), and
thus quite plainly stand as a calibrated deterrent to the forbearance strategy. Cf. Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123, 148
(1908) ("[T]o impose upon a party interested the burden of
obtaining a judicial decision . . . only upon the condition that
if unsuccessful he must suffer imprisonment and pay fines . . .
is, in effect, to close up all approaches to the courts").12
Other costs of the forbearance strategy are less tangible,

each day of noncompliance with statutory provisions, which would become
final and payable after review by the agency and the appropriate court of
appeals. Id., at 204, n. 4, 218. But, unlike the nursing homes at issue
here, the aggrieved mine operator apparently had the option of complying
and then bringing a judicial challenge. See id., at 221 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).

I recount these allegations of hardship to respondent'smembers not because they inform any case-by-case application of the presumption in favor of preenforcement review,but rather because such concerns motivate the presumption

statute in favor of preenforcement review; (2) apply ripe-ness doctrine to determine whether the suit should be

this mode of analysis, the court below, after concludingthat the Medicare Act does not preclude general federalquestion jurisdiction over a preenforcement challenge tothe Secretary's regulations, held that respondent's APA
notice-and-comment challenge was ripe but that its consti-tutional vagueness claim was not. 143 F. 3d, at 1076-1077.

While I express no view on the proper application of ripe-ness doctrine to respondent's claims,

14 I am confident that

this method of analysis enjoys substantially more supportin our cases than does the majority's approach, which prescribes a case-by-case hardship inquiry at the thresholdstage of determining whether preenforcement review has
been precluded by statute. See ante, at 20 (holding that$ 1395ii does not incorporate $ 405(h) where the aggrieved
party "can obtain no review at all unless it can obtain judicialreview in a $ 1331 action"). While the majority's variation
would be harmless if its hardship test were no more strin-gent than the hardship prong of ordinary ripeness doctrine,
I presume its test is more exacting--otherwise the majorityopinion is no more than a well-disguised application of ripeness doctrine to the facts of this case.15 At bottom, then,the majority superimposes a more burdensome hardship test
on ordinary ripeness doctrine for aggrieved persons who

15 The majority acknowledges that its hardship test is more burdensome than the hardship prong of ripeness doctrine in at least one respect.
We are told that the relevant hardship is not that endured by the "individual plaintiff," but rather that confronted by the "class" of persons similarly
situated to the individual plaintiff. Ante, at 22-23; see supra, at 42-43.

Instead, I would hold that $ 1395ii, as interpreted by Mich-igan Academy, does not in this case incorporate $ 405(h)'s

preclusion of federal-question jurisdiction, especially inlight of the presumption in favor of preenforcement review.
I respectfully dissent.

16 The majority betrays its misunderstanding of the relationship between the presumption in favor of preenforcement review and ripeness doctrine when it says that "any . . . presumption [in favor of preenforcement review] must be far weaker than a presumption against
preclusion of all review in light of the traditional ripeness doctrine, which
often requires initial presentation of a claim to an agency." Ante, at 19-
20. I do not dispute that respondent must demonstrate that its claims
are ripe before the District Court may entertain respondent's preenforcement challenge. My point is only that respondent should be permitted
to make its ripeness argument and to have that argument assessed according to traditional ripeness doctrine, rather than facing statutory preclusion of review by (inevitably) failing the majority's "super-hardship"
test. As I explained, supra, at 50, our cases establish a two-step analysis:
(1) in light of the presumption in favor of preenforcement review, construe
an ambiguous statute to allow preenforcement review; (2) apply ripeness
doctrine to determine whether the suit should be entertained.

53OCTOBER TERM, 1999
Syllabus

UNITED STATES v. JOHNSON
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe sixth circuit

No. 98-1696. Argued December 8, 1999--Decided March 1, 2000
Respondent had been serving time in federal prison for multiple drug

and firearms felonies when two of his convictions were declared invalid.
As a result, he had served 2.5 years' too much prison time and was at
once set free, but a 3-year term of supervised release was yet to be
served on the remaining convictions. He filed a motion to reduce his
supervised release term by the amount of extra prison time he served.
The District Court denied relief, explaining that the supervised release
commenced upon respondent's actual release from incarceration, not before. The Sixth Circuit reversed, accepting respondent's argument that
his supervised release term commenced not on the day he left prison,
but when his lawful term of imprisonment expired.

Held: This Court is bound by the controlling statute, 18 U. S. C. $ 3624(e),

which, by its necessary operation, does not reduce the length of a
supervised release term by reason of excess time served in prison.
Under $ 3624(e), a supervised release term does not commence until an
individual "is released from imprisonment." The ordinary, commonsense meaning of "release" is to be freed from confinement. To say
respondent was released while still imprisoned diminishes the concept
the word intends to convey. Section 3624(e) also provides that a supervised release term comes "after imprisonment," once the prisoner is
"released by the Bureau of Prisons to the supervision of a probation
officer." Thus, supervised release does not run while an individual
remains in the Bureau of Prisons' custody. The phrase "on the day the
person is released" in $ 3624(e) suggests a strict temporal interpretation, not some fictitious or constructive earlier time. Indeed, the section admonishes that "supervised release does not run during any period
in which the person is imprisoned." The statute does provide for concurrent running of supervised release in specific, identified cases, but
the Court infers that Congress limited $ 3624(e) to the exceptions set
forth. Finally, $ 3583(e)(3) does not have a substantial bearing on the
interpretive issue, for this directive addresses instances where conditions of supervised release have been violated, and the court orders
a revocation. While the text of $ 3624(e) resolves the case, the Court's
conclusion accords with the objectives of supervised release, which include assisting individuals in their transition to community life. Super529US1 Unit: $U33 [10-04-01 09:21:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN

vised release fulfills rehabilitative ends, distinct from those served by
incarceration. The Court also observes that the statutory structure
provides a means to address the equitable concerns that exist when an
individual is incarcerated beyond the proper expiration of his prison
term. The trial court, as it sees fit, may modify the individual's supervised release conditions, $ 3583(e)(2), or it may terminate his supervised
release obligations after one year of completed service, $ 3583(e)(1).

Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.
An offender had been serving time in federal prison formultiple felonies when two of his convictions were declared invalid. As a result, he had served too much prisontime and was at once set free, but a term of supervised release was yet to be served on the remaining convictions.The question becomes whether the excess prison time should
be credited to the supervised release term, reducing itslength. Bound by the text of the controlling statute, 18
U. S. C. $ 3624(e), we hold that the supervised release termremains unaltered.

Respondent Roy Lee Johnson was convicted in 1990 ontwo counts of possession with an intent to distribute controlled substances, 84 Stat. 1260, 21 U. S. C. $ 841(a), ontwo counts of use of a firearm in connection with a drug

Opinion of the Court
and on one count of possession of a firearm by a convictedfelon, $ 922(g). He received a sentence of 171 months' imprisonment, consisting of three concurrent 51-month termson the $ 841(a) and $ 922(g) counts, to be followed by two
consecutive 60-month terms on the $ 924(c) counts. In addi-tion, the District Court imposed a mandatory 3-year term
of supervised release for the drug possession offenses. See
21 U. S. C. $ 841(b)(1)(C) (1994 ed., Supp. III). The Court ofAppeals, though otherwise affirming respondent's convictions and sentence, concluded the District Court erred insentencing him to consecutive terms of imprisonment for
the two $ 924(c) firearm offenses. United States v. Johnson,
25 F. 3d 1335, 1337-1338 (CA6 1994) (en banc). On remand
the District Court modified the prisoner's sentence to a term
of 111 months.

After our decision in Bailey v. United States, 516 U. S. 137
(1995), respondent filed a motion under 28 U. S. C. $ 2255 to
vacate his $ 924(c) convictions, and the Government did not
oppose. On May 2, 1996, the District Court vacated those
convictions, modifying respondent's sentence to 51 months.
He had already served more than that amount of time, so
the District Court ordered his immediate release. His term
of supervised release then went into effect. This dispute
concerns its length.

In June 1996, respondent filed a motion requesting the
District Court to reduce his supervised release term by 2.5
years, the extra time served on the vacated $ 924(c) convictions. The District Court denied relief, explaining that
pursuant to 18 U. S. C. $ 3624(e) the supervised release commenced upon respondent's actual release from incarceration, not before. Granting respondent credit, the court observed, would undermine Congress' aim of using supervised
release to assist convicted felons in their transitions to community life.

A divided Court of Appeals reversed. 154 F. 3d 569 (CA6
1998). The court accepted respondent's argument that his

Opinion of the Court
term of supervised release commenced not on the day he leftprison confines but earlier, when his lawful term of imprisonment expired. Id., at 571. Awarding respondent credit forthe extra time served, the court further concluded, would
provide meaningful relief because supervised release, whileserving rehabilitative purposes, is also "punitive in nature."
Ibid. Judge Gilman dissented, agreeing with the positionof the District Court.

Id., at 572-573.The Courts of Appeals have reached differing conclusions

on the question presented. Compare United States v.Blake, 88 F. 3d 824, 825 (CA9 1996) (supervised release
commences on the date defendants "should have been re-leased, rather than on the dates of their actual release"),
with United States v. Jeanes, 150 F. 3d 483, 485 (CA5 1998)(supervised release cannot run during any period of imprisonment); United States v. Joseph, 109 F. 3d 34 (CA1 1997)(same); United States v. Douglas, 88 F. 3d 533, 534 (CA8
1996) (same). We granted certiorari to resolve the question,527 U. S. 1062 (1999), and we now reverse.

Section 3583(a) of Title 18 authorizes, and in some in-stances mandates, sentencing courts to order supervised
release terms following imprisonment. On the issue pre-sented for review--whether a term of supervised release
begins on the date of actual release from incarceration oron an earlier date due to a mistaken interpretation of federal law--the language of $ 3624(e) controls. The statuteprovides in relevant part:

"A prisoner whose sentence includes a term of super-vised release after imprisonment shall be released by
the Bureau of Prisons to the supervision of a probationofficer who shall, during the term imposed, supervise
the person released to the degree warranted by the con-ditions specified by the sentencing court. The term of
supervised release commences on the day the person isreleased from imprisonment and runs concurrently with
any Federal, State, or local term of probation or super529US1 Unit: $U33 [10-04-01 09:21:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN

57Cite as: 529 U. S. 53 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
vised release or parole for another offense to which theperson is subject or becomes subject during the term

of supervised release. A term of supervised releasedoes not run during any period in which the person is
imprisoned in connection with a conviction for a Federal,State, or local crime unless the imprisonment is for a
period of less than 30 consecutive days."
The quoted language directs that a supervised releaseterm does not commence until an individual "is released

from imprisonment." There can be little question aboutthe meaning of the word "release" in the context of imprisonment. It means "[t]o loosen or destroy the force of;to remove the obligation or effect of; hence to alleviate
or remove; . . . [t]o let loose again; to set free from re-straint, confinement, or servitude; to set at liberty; to let go."
Webster's New International Dictionary 2103 (2d ed. 1949).As these definitions illustrate, the ordinary, commonsense
meaning of release is to be freed from confinement. To sayrespondent was released while still imprisoned diminishes
the concept the word intends to convey.The first sentence of $ 3624(e) supports our construction.
A term of supervised release comes "after imprisonment,"once the prisoner is "released by the Bureau of Prisons to
the supervision of a probation officer." Supervised releasedoes not run while an individual remains in the custody of
the Bureau of Prisons. The phrase "on the day the personis released," in the second sentence of $ 3624(e), suggests a
strict temporal interpretation, not some fictitious or con-structive earlier time. The statute does not say "on the
day the person is released or on the earlier day when heshould have been released." Indeed, the third sentence
admonishes that "supervised release does not run during anyperiod in which the person is imprisoned."

The statute does provide for concurrent running of super-vised release in specific cases. After the operative phrase
"released from imprisonment," $ 3624(e) requires the con529US1 Unit: $U33 [10-04-01 09:21:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN
58 UNITED STATES v. JOHNSON

Opinion of the Court
current running of a term of supervised release with termsof probation, parole, or with other, separate terms of supervised release. The statute instructs that concurrency is per-mitted not for prison sentences but only for those other types
of sentences given specific mention. The next sentence inthe statute does address a prison term and does allow concurrent counting, but only for prison terms less than 30 days
in length. When Congress provides exceptions in a statute,it does not follow that courts have authority to create others.

The proper inference, and the one we adopt here, is thatCongress considered the issue of exceptions and, in the end,
limited the statute to the ones set forth. The 30-day exception finds no application in this case; each of respondent's
sentences, to which the term of supervised release attached,
exceeded that amount of time. Finally, $ 3583(e)(3) does not
have a substantial bearing on the interpretive issue, for this
directive addresses instances where conditions of supervised
release have been violated, and the court orders a revocation.

Our conclusi on finds further support in 18 U. S. C.

$ 3583(a), which authorizes the imposition of "a term of supervised release after imprisonment." This provision, too,
is inconsistent with respondent's contention that confinement
and supervised release can run at the same time. The statute's direction is clear and precise. Release takes place on
the day the prisoner in fact is freed from confinement.

The Court of Appeals reasoned that reduction of respondent's supervised release term was a necessary implementation of $ 3624(a), which provides that "[a] prisoner shall be
released by the Bureau of Prisons on the date of the expiration of the prisoner's term of imprisonment . . . ." All concede respondent's term of imprisonment should have ended
earlier than it did. It does not follow, however, that the
term of supervised release commenced, as a matter of law,
once he completed serving his lawful sentences. It is true
the prison term and the release term are related, for the
latter cannot begin until the former expires. Though inter529US1 Unit: $U33 [10-04-01 09:21:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN

59Cite as: 529 U. S. 53 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
related, the terms are not interchangeable. The Court ofAppeals was mistaken in holding otherwise, and the text

of $ 3624(e) cannot accommodate the rule the Court of Ap-peals derived. Supervised release has no statutory function until confinement ends. Cf. United States v. Granderson, 511 U. S. 39, 50 (1994) (observing that "terms of
supervised release . . . follow up prison terms"). The rule
of lenity does not alter the analysis. Absent ambiguity, therule of lenity is not applicable to guide statutory interpretation. Cf. Gozlon-Peretz v. United States, 498 U. S. 395, 410(1991).

While the text of $ 3624(e) resolves the case, we observe
that our conclusion accords with the statute's purpose and
design. The objectives of supervised release would be unfulfilled if excess prison time were to offset and reduce
terms of supervised release. Congress intended supervised release to assist individuals in their transition to
community life. Supervised release fulfills rehabilitative
ends, distinct from those served by incarceration. See

$ 3553(a)(2)(D); United States Sentencing Commission,
Guidelines Manual $$ 5D1.3(c), (d), (e) (Nov. 1998); see also
S. Rep. No. 98-225, p. 124 (1983) (declaring that "the primary
goal [of supervised release] is to ease the defendant's transition into the community after the service of a long prison
term for a particularly serious offense, or to provide rehabilitation to a defendant who has spent a fairly short period
in prison for punishment or other purposes but still needs
supervision and training programs after release"). Sentencing courts, in determining the conditions of a defendant's
supervised release, are required to consider, among other
factors, "the nature and circumstances of the offense and
the history and characteristics of the defendant," "the
need . . . to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; . . . to protect the public from further crimes of the
defendant; and . . . to provide the defendant with needed

Opinion of the Court
rectional treatment." 18 U. S. C. $ 3553(a). In the instantcase, the transition assistance ordered by the trial court required respondent, among other conditions, to avoid possess-ing or transporting firearms and to participate in a drug dependency treatment program. These conditions illustratethat supervised release, unlike incarceration, provides individuals with postconfinement assistance. Cf. Gozlon-Peretz,
supra, at 407 (describing "[s]upervised release [a]s a uniquemethod of postconfinement supervision invented by the

Congress for a series of sentencing reforms"). The Courtof Appeals erred in treating respondent's time in prison as
interchangeable with his term of supervised release.There can be no doubt that equitable considerations of
great weight exist when an individual is incarcerated be-yond the proper expiration of his prison term. The statutory structure provides a means to address these concernsin large part. The trial court, as it sees fit, may modify an
individual's conditions of supervised release. $ 3583(e)(2).Furthermore, the court may terminate an individual's supervised release obligations "at any time after the expiration ofone year . . . if it is satisfied that such action is warranted
by the conduct of the defendant released and the interest ofjustice." $ 3583(e)(1). Respondent may invoke $ 3583(e)(2)
in pursuit of relief; and, having completed one year of super-vised release, he may also seek relief under $ 3583(e)(1).

The statute, by its own necessary operation, does not re-duce the length of a supervised release term by reason of
excess time served in prison. The judgment of the Courtof Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is reversed, and the case
is remanded for further proceedings consistent with thisopinion.

It is so ordered.

PORTUONDO, SUPERINTENDENT, FISHKILL COR-RECTIONAL FACILITY

v. AGARD

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe second circuit

No. 98-1170. Argued November 1, 1999--Decided March 6, 2000
Respondent was convicted on New York criminal charges after a trial that

required the jury to decide whether it believed the testimony of the
victim and her friend or the conflicting testimony of respondent. The
prosecutor challenged respondent's credibility during summation, calling the jury's attention to the fact that respondent had the opportunity
to hear all other witnesses testify and to tailor his own testimony accordingly. The trial court rejected respondent's objection that these
comments violated his right to be present at trial. After exhausting
his state appeals, respondent filed a petition for habeas corpus in federal
court claiming, inter alia, that the prosecutor's comments violated his
Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights to be present at trial and confront
his accusers, and his Fourteenth Amendment right to due process. The
District Court denied his petition, but the Second Circuit reversed.

Held:

1. The prosecutor's comments did not violate respondent's Fifth and
Sixth Amendment rights. The Court declines to extend to such comments the rationale of Griffin v. California, 380 U. S. 609, in which it
held that a trial court's instruction about a defendant's refusal to testify
unconstitutionally burdened his privilege against self-incrimination.
As a threshold matter, respondent's claims find no historical support.
Griffin, moreover, is a poor analogue for those claims. Griffin prohibited the prosecution from urging the jury to do something the jury is
not permitted to do, and upon request a court must instruct the jury not
to count a defendant's silence against him. It is reasonable to expect a
jury to comply with such an instruction because inferring guilt from
silence is not always "natural or irresistible," id., at 615; but it is natural
and irresistible for a jury, in evaluating the relative credibility of a defendant who testifies last, to have in mind and weigh in the balance the
fact that he has heard the testimony of those who preceded him. In
contrast to the comments in Griffin, which suggested that a defendant's silence is "evidence of guilt," ibid., the prosecutor's comments in
this case concerned respondent's credibility as a witness. They were
therefore in accord with the Court's longstanding rule that when a defendant takes the stand, his credibility may be assailed like that of any

62 PORTUONDO v. AGARD

Syllabus
other witness--a rule that serves the trial's truth-seeking function,
Perry v. Leeke, 488 U. S. 272, 282. That the comments here were generic rather than based upon a specific indication of tailoring does not
render them infirm. Nor does the fact that they came at summation
rather than at a point earlier in the trial. In Reagan v. United States,
157 U. S. 301, 304, the Court upheld the trial court's recitation of an
interested-witness instruction that directed the jury to consider the defendant's deep personal interest in the case when evaluating his credibility. The instruction in Reagan, like the prosecutor's comments in this
case, did not rely on any specific evidence of actual fabrication for its
application, nor did it come at a time when the defendant could respond.
Nevertheless, the Court considered the instruction to be perfectly
proper. Pp. 65-73.

2. The prosecutor's comments also did not violate respondent's right
to due process. To the extent his due process claim is based upon an
alleged burdening of his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights, it has been
disposed of by the determination that those Amendments were not directly infringed. Respondent also argues, however, that it was improper to comment on his presence at trial because New York law requires him to be present. Respondent points to the Court's decision in
Doyle v. Ohio, 426 U. S. 610, for support. The Court held in Doyle that
the prosecution may not impeach a defendant with his post-Miranda
warnings silence because those warnings carry an implicit "assurance
that silence will carry no penalty." Id., at 618. No promise of impunity is implicit in a statute requiring a defendant to be present at trial,
and there is no authority whatever for the proposition that the impairment of credibility, if any, caused by mandatory presence at trial violates
due process. Pp. 74-75.

Respondent's trial on 19 sodomy and assault counts and3 weapons counts ultimately came down to a credibility determination. The alleged victim, Nessa Winder, and herfriend, Breda Keegan, testified that respondent physically
assaulted, raped, and orally and anally sodomized Winder,and that he threatened both women with a handgun. Respondent testified that he and Winder had engaged in con-sensual vaginal intercourse. He further testified that during an argument he had with Winder, he struck her once inthe face. He denied raping her or threatening either woman
with a handgun.During summation, defense counsel charged Winder and
Keegan with lying. The prosecutor similarly focused on thecredibility of the witnesses. She stressed respondent's interest in the outcome of the trial, his prior felony conviction,and his prior bad acts. She argued that respondent was a

id., at 48. Finally, over defense objection, the
prosecutor remarked:

"You know, ladies and gentlemen, unlike all the other
witnesses in this case the defendant has a benefit andthe benefit that he has, unlike all the other witnesses, is

he gets to sit here and listen to the testimony of all theother witnesses before he testifies.

. . . . .
"That gives you a big advantage, doesn't it. You get
to sit here and think what am I going to say and howam I going to say it? How am I going to fit it into the

evidence?. . . . .

"He's a smart man. I never said he was stupid. . . .
He used everything to his advantage." Id., at 49.

The trial court rejected defense counsel's claim that theselast comments violated respondent's right to be present at

trial. The court stated that respondent's status as the lastwitness in the case was simply a matter of fact, and held that
his presence during the entire trial, and the advantage that
this afforded him, "may fairly be commented on." Id., at 54.Respondent was convicted of one count of anal sodomy and

two counts of third-degree possession of a weapon. On di-rect appeal, the New York Supreme Court reversed one of
the convictions for possession of a weapon but affirmed theremaining convictions.

Respondent then filed a petition for habeas corpus relief

comments violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights to
be present at trial and confront his accusers. He further
claimed that the comments violated his Fourteenth Amend529US1 Unit: $U34 [09-26-01 08:14:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ment right to due process. The District Court denied thepetition in an unpublished order. A divided panel of the

Second Circuit reversed, holding that the prosecutor's com-ments violated respondent's Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth
Amendment rights. 117 F. 3d 696 (1997), rehearing denied,159 F. 3d 98 (1998). We granted certiorari. 526 U. S. 1016
(1999). II

Respondent contends that the prosecutor's comments onhis presence and on the ability to fabricate that it afforded
him unlawfully burdened his Sixth Amendment right to bepresent at trial and to be confronted with the witnesses
against him, see Illinois v. Allen, 397 U. S. 337 (1970);
Pointer v. Texas, 380 U. S. 400 (1965), and his Fifth and SixthAmendment rights to testify on his own behalf, see Rock v.

Arkansas, 483 U. S. 44 (1987). Attaching the cost of im-peachment to the exercise of these rights was, he asserts,
unconstitutional.Respondent's argument boils down to a request that we
extend to comments of the type the prosecutor made herethe rationale of Griffin v. California, 380 U. S. 609 (1965),
which involved comments upon a defendant's refusal to tes-tify. In that case, the trial court instructed the jury that it
was free to take the defendant's failure to deny or explainfacts within his knowledge as tending to indicate the truth
of the prosecution's case. This Court held that such a com-ment, by "solemniz[ing] the silence of the accused into evidence against him," unconstitutionally "cuts down on theprivilege [against self-incrimination] by making its assertion
costly." Id., at 614.We decline to extend

Griffin to the present context. Asan initial matter, respondent's claims have no historical foundation, neither in 1791, when the Bill of Rights was adopted,nor in 1868 when, according to our jurisprudence, the Fourteenth Amendment extended the strictures of the Fifth andSixth Amendments to the States. The process by which

66 PORTUONDO v. AGARD

Opinion of the Court
criminal defendants were brought to justice in 1791 largelyobviated the need for comments of the type the prosecutor

made here. Defendants routinely were asked (and agreed)to provide a pretrial statement to a justice of the peace detailing the events in dispute. See Moglen, The Privilege inBritish North America: The Colonial Period to the Fifth
Amendment, in The Privilege Against Self-Incrimination
109, 112, 114 (R. Helmholz et al. eds. 1997). If their storyat trial--where they typically spoke and conducted their

defense personally, without counsel, see J. Goebel & T.Naughton, Law Enforcement in Colonial New York: A Study
in Criminal Procedure (1664-1776), p. 574 (1944); A. Scott,
Criminal Law in Colonial Virginia 79 (1930)--differed from
their pretrial statement, the contradiction could be noted.
See Levy, Origins of the Fifth Amendment and Its Critics,
19 Cardozo L. Rev. 821, 843 (1997). Moreover, what they
said at trial was not considered to be evidence, since they
were disqualified from testifying under oath. See 2 J. Wigmore, Evidence $ 579 (3d ed. 1940).

The pretrial statement did not begin to fall into disuse until the 1830's, see Alschuler, A Peculiar Privilege in
Historical Perspective, in The Privilege Against SelfIncrimination, supra, at 198, and the first State to make
defendants competent witnesses was Maine, in 1864, see 2
Wigmore, supra, $ 579, at 701. In response to these developments, some States attempted to limit a defendant's opportunity to tailor his sworn testimony by requiring him to testify prior to his own witnesses. See 3 J. Wigmore, Evidence

$$ 1841, 1869 (1904); Ky. Stat., ch. 45, $ 1646 (1899); Tenn.
Code Ann., ch. 4, $ 5601 (1896). Although the majority of
States did not impose such a restriction, there is no evidence
to suggest they also took the affirmative step of forbidding
comment upon the defendant's opportunity to tailor his testimony. The dissent faults us for "call[ing] up no instance of
an 18th- or 19th-century prosecutor's urging that a defendant's presence at trial facilitated tailored testimony." Post,

Opinion of the Court
at 84 (opinion of Ginsburg, J.). We think the burden israther upon respondent and the dissent, who assert the unconstitutionality of the practice, to come up with a case inwhich such urging was held improper. They cannot even
produce one in which the practice was so much as challengeduntil after our decision in

Griffin. See, e. g., State v. Cassidy, 236 Conn. 112, 126-127, 672 A. 2d 899, 907-908 (1996);
People v. Buckey, 424 Mich. 1, 8-15, 378 N. W. 2d 432, 436-439 (1985);

Jenkins v. United States, 374 A. 2d 581, 583-584
(D. C. 1977). This absence cuts in favor of respondent (asthe dissent asserts) only if it is possible to believe that after

reading Griffin prosecutors suddenly realized that commenting on a testifying defendant's unique ability to hear prior
testimony was a good idea. Evidently, prosecutors were
making these comments all along without objection; Griffin
simply sparked the notion that such commentary might be
problematic.

Lacking any historical support for the constitutional rights
that he asserts, respondent must rely entirely upon our opinion in Griffin. That case is a poor analogue, however, for
several reasons. What we prohibited the prosecutor from
urging the jury to do in Griffin was something the jury is
not permitted to do. The defendant's right to hold the
prosecution to proving its case without his assistance is not
to be impaired by the jury's counting the defendant's silence
at trial against him--and upon request the court must instruct the jury to that effect. See Carter v. Kentucky, 450
U. S. 288 (1981). It is reasonable enough to expect a jury to
comply with that instruction since, as we observed in Griffin,
the inference of guilt from silence is not always "natural or
irresistible." 380 U. S., at 615. A defendant might refuse
to testify simply out of fear that he will be made to look bad
by clever counsel, or fear " `that his prior convictions will
prejudice the jury.' " Ibid. (quoting People v. Modesto, 62
Cal. 2d 436, 453, 398 P. 2d 753, 763 (1965) (en banc)). By
contrast, it is natural and irresistible for a jury, in evaluating

68 PORTUONDO v. AGARD

Opinion of the Court
the relative credibility of a defendant who testifies last, tohave in mind and weigh in the balance the fact that he heard

the testimony of all those who preceded him. It is one thing(as Griffin requires) for the jury to evaluate all the other
evidence in the case without giving any effect to the defend-ant's refusal to testify; it is something else (and quite impossible) for the jury to evaluate the credibility of the defend-ant's testimony while blotting out from its mind the fact that
before giving the testimony the defendant had been sittingthere listening to the other witnesses. Thus, the principle
respondent asks us to adopt here differs from what weadopted in

Griffin in one or the other of the following re-spects: It either prohibits inviting the jury to do what the

jury is perfectly entitled to do; or it requires the jury to dowhat is practically impossible.

1

1 The dissent seeks to place us in the position of defending the proposition that inferences that the jury is free to make are inferences that the
prosecutor must be free to invite. Post, at 86-87. Of course we say no
such thing. We simply say (in the sentence to which this note is appended) that forbidding invitation of a permissible inference is one of two
alternative respects in which this case is substantially different from respondent's sole source of support, Griffin. Similarly, the dissent seeks to
place us in the position of defending the proposition that it is more natural
to infer tailoring from presence than to infer guilt from silence. Post, at
84-86. The quite different point we do make is that inferring opportunity to tailor from presence is inevitable, and prohibiting that inference
(while simultaneously asking the jury to evaluate the veracity of the defendant's testimony) is demanding the impossible--producing the other
alternative respect in which this case differs from Griffin.

The dissent seeks to rebut this point by asserting that in the present
case the prosecutorial comments went beyond pointing out the opportunity to tailor and actually made an accusation of tailoring. It would be
worth inquiring into that subtle distinction if the dissent proposed to permit the former while forbidding the latter. It does not, of course; nor, as
far as we know, does any other authority. Drawing the line between
pointing out the availability of the inference and inviting the inference
would be neither useful nor practicable. Thus, under the second alternative described above, the jury must be prohibited from taking into account
the opportunity of tailoring.

Opinion of the Court
Second, Griffin prohibited comments that suggest a de-fendant's silence is "evidence of

guilt." 380 U. S., at 615
(emphasis added); see also United States v. Robinson, 485U. S. 25, 32 (1988) (

" `Griffin prohibits the judge and prosecutor from suggesting to the jury that it may treat thedefendant's silence as substantive evidence of guilt' " (quoting Baxter v. Palmigiano, 425 U. S. 308, 319 (1976))). The
prosecutor's comments in this case, by contrast, concernedrespondent's

credibility as a witness, and were therefore in
accord with our longstanding rule that when a defendanttakes the stand, "his credibility may be impeached and his

testimony assailed like that of any other witness." Brown
v. United States, 356 U. S. 148, 154 (1958). "[W]hen [a defendant] assumes the role of a witness, the rules that generally apply to other witnesses--rules that serve the truthseeking function of the trial--are generally applicable to him
as well." Perry v. Leeke, 488 U. S. 272, 282 (1989). See also
Reagan v. United States, 157 U. S. 301, 305 (1895).

Respondent points to our opinion in Geders v. United
States, 425 U. S. 80, 87-91 (1976), which held that the defendant must be treated differently from other witnesses insofar
as sequestration orders are concerned, since sequestration
for an extended period of time denies the Sixth Amendment
right to counsel. With respect to issues of credibility, however, no such special treatment has been accorded. Jenkins
v. Anderson, 447 U. S. 231 (1980), illustrates the point.
There the prosecutor in a first-degree murder trial, during
cross-examination and again in closing argument, attempted
to impeach the defendant's claim of self-defense by suggesting that he would not have waited two weeks to report the
killing if that was what had occurred. In an argument strikingly similar to the one presented here, the defendant in
Jenkins claimed that commenting on his prearrest silence
violated his Fifth Amendment privilege against selfincrimination because "a person facing arrest will not remain
silent if his failure to speak later can be used to impeach

Opinion of the Court
him." Id., at 236. The Court noted that it was not clearwhether the Fifth Amendment protects prearrest silence,

id., at 236, n. 2, but held that, assuming it does, the prosecu-tor's comments were constitutionally permissible. "[T]he
Constitution does not forbid `every government-imposedchoice in the criminal process that has the effect of discouraging the exercise of constitutional rights.' " Id., at 236
(quoting Chaffin v. Stynchcombe, 412 U. S. 17, 30 (1973)).Once a defendant takes the stand, he is " `subject to crossexamination impeaching his credibility just like any otherwitness.' "

Jenkins, supra, at 235-236 (quoting Grunewald
v. United States, 353 U. S. 391, 420 (1957)).

Indeed, in Brooks v. Tennessee, 406 U. S. 605 (1972), the
Court suggested that arguing credibility to the jury--which
would include the prosecutor's comments here--is the preferred means of counteracting tailoring of the defendant's
testimony. In that case, the Court found unconstitutional
Tennessee's attempt to defeat tailoring by requiring defendants to testify at the outset of the defense or not at all. This
requirement, it said, impermissibly burdened the defendant's
right to testify because it forced him to decide whether to
do so before he could determine that it was in his best interest. Id., at 610. The Court expressed its awareness, however, of the danger that tailoring presented. The antidote,
it said, was not Tennessee's heavy-handed rule, but the more
nuanced "adversary system[, which] reposes judgment of the
credibility of all witnesses in the jury." Id., at 611. The
adversary system surely envisions--indeed, it requires--
that the prosecutor be allowed to bring to the jury's attention the danger that the Court was aware of.

Respondent and the dissent also contend that the prosecutor's comments were impermissible because they were
"generic" rather than based upon any specific indication of
tailoring. Such comment, the dissent claims, is unconstitutional because it "does not serve to distinguish guilty defendants from innocent ones." Post, at 77. But this Court has

71Cite as: 529 U. S. 61 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
approved of such "generic" comment before. In Reagan, forexample, the trial court instructed the jury that "[t]he deep

personal interest which [the defendant] may have in the re-sult of the suit should be considered . . . in weighing his
evidence and in determining how far or to what extent, if atall, it is worthy of credit." 157 U. S., at 304. The instruction did not rely on any specific evidence of actual fabrication
for its application; nor did it, directly at least, delineate theguilty and the innocent. Like the comments in this case, it

simply set forth a consideration the jury was to have in mindwhen assessing the defendant's credibility, which,

in turn,
assisted it in determining the guilt of the defendant. Wedeemed that instruction perfectly proper. Thus, that the

comments before us here did not, of their own force, demon-strate the guilt of the defendant, or even distinguish among
defendants, does not render them infirm.2Finally, the Second Circuit held, and the dissent contends,
that the comments were impermissible here because they
were made, not during cross-examination, but at summation,

2 The dissent's stern disapproval of generic comment (it "tarnishes the
innocent no less than the guilty," post, at 77-78; it suffers from an "incapacity to serve the individualized truth-finding function of trials," post,
at 80; so that "when a defendant's exercise of a constitutional fair trial
right is `insolubly ambiguous' as between innocence and guilt, the prosecutor may not urge the jury to construe the bare invocation of the right
against the defendant," post, at 78) hardly comports with its praising the
Court of Appeals for its "carefully restrained and moderate position"
in forbidding this monstrous practice only on summation and allowing
it during the rest of the trial, ibid. The dissent would also allow a prosecutor to remark at any time--even at summation--on the convenient "fit"
between specific elements of a defendant's testimony and the testimony
of others. Ibid. It is only a "general accusation of tailoring" that is
forbidden. Ibid. But if the dissent believes that comments which "invite
the jury to convict on the basis of conduct as consistent with innocence as
with guilt" should be out of bounds, post, at 79--or at least should be out
of bounds in summation--comments focusing on such "fit" must similarly
be forbidden. As the dissent acknowledges, "fit" is as likely to result from
the defendant's "sheer innocence" as from anything else. Post, at 85.

leaving the defense no opportunity to reply. 117 F. 3d, at
708, and n. 6. That this is not a constitutionally significant
distinction is demonstrated by our decision in Reagan.
There the challenged instruction came at the end of the case,
after the defense had rested, just as the prosecutor's comments did here.3

Our trial structure, which requires the defense to close
before the prosecution, regularly forces the defense to predict what the prosecution will say. Indeed, defense counsel
in this case explained to the jury that it was his job in "closing argument here to try and anticipate as best [he could]
some of the arguments that the prosecution [would] be
making." App. 25-27. What Reagan permitted--a generic

3 The dissent maintains that Reagan v. United States, 157 U. S. 301
(1895), is inapposite to the question presented in this case because it considered the effect of an interested-witness instruction on a defendant's
statutory right to testify, rather than on his constitutional right to testify.
See id., at 304 (citing Act of Mar. 16, 1878, ch. 37, 20 Stat. 30, as amended,
18 U. S. C. $ 3481). That is a curious position for the dissent to take.
Griffin--the case the dissent claims controls the outcome here--relied almost exclusively on the very statute at issue in Reagan in defining the
contours of the Fifth Amendment right prohibiting comment on the failure
to testify. After quoting the Court's description, in an earlier case, of the
reasons for the statutory right, see Wilson v. United States, 149 U. S.
60 (1893), the Griffin Court said: "If the words `Fifth Amendment' are
substituted for `act' and for `statute,' the spirit of the Self-Incrimination
Clause is reflected." 380 U. S., at 613-614. It is eminently reasonable to
consider that a questionable manner of constitutional exegesis, see Mitchell v. United States, 526 U. S. 314, 336 (1999) (Scalia, J., dissenting); it is
not reasonable to make Griffin the very centerpiece of one's case while
simultaneously denying that the statute construed in Reagan (and Griffin)
has anything to do with the meaning of the Constitution. The interpretation of the statute in Reagan is in fact a much more plausible indication
of constitutional understanding than the application of the statute in Griffin: The Constitution must have allowed what Reagan said the statute
permitted, because otherwise the Court would have been interpreting the
statute in a manner that rendered it void. Griffin, on the other hand,
relied upon the much shakier proposition that a practice which the statute
prohibited must be prohibited by the Constitution as well.

Opinion of the Court
interested-witness instruction, after the defense has closed--
is in a long tradition that continues to the present day. See,
e. g., United States v. Jones, 587 F. 2d 802 (CA5 1979); United
States v. Hill, 470 F. 2d 361 (CADC 1972); 2 C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure $ 501, and n. 1 (1982). Indeed,
the instruction was given in this very case. See Tr. 834 ("A
defendant is of course an interested witness since he is interested in the outcome of the trial. You may as jurors wish
to keep such interest in mind in determining the credibility
and weight to be given to the defendant's testimony").4
There is absolutely nothing to support the dissent's contention that for purposes of determining the validity of generic
attacks upon credibility "the distinction between crossexamination and summation is critical," post, at 87.

In sum, we see no reason to depart from the practice of
treating testifying defendants the same as other witnesses.
A witness's ability to hear prior testimony and to tailor his
account accordingly, and the threat that ability presents to
the integrity of the trial, are no different when it is the defendant doing the listening. Allowing comment upon the
fact that a defendant's presence in the courtroom provides
him a unique opportunity to tailor his testimony is appropriate--and indeed, given the inability to sequester the
defendant, sometimes essential--to the central function of
the trial, which is to discover the truth.

4 It is hard to understand how Justice Stevens reconciles the unquestionable propriety of the standard interested-witness instruction with his
conclusion that comment upon the opportunity to tailor, although it is constitutional, "demean[s] [the adversary] process" and "should be discouraged." Post, at 76 (opinion concurring in judgment). Our decision, in
any event, is addressed to whether the comment is permissible as a constitutional matter, and not to whether it is always desirable as a matter
of sound trial practice. The latter question, as well as the desirability
of putting prosecutorial comment into proper perspective by judicial instruction, are best left to trial courts, and to the appellate courts which
routinely review their work.

Opinion of the Court

III
Finally, we address the Second Circuit's holding that the
prosecutor's comments violated respondent's Fourteenth
Amendment right to due process. Of course to the extent
this claim is based upon alleged burdening of Fifth and Sixth
Amendment rights, it has already been disposed of by our
determination that those Amendments were not infringed.
Cf. Graham v. Connor, 490 U. S. 386, 395 (1989) (where an
Amendment "provides an explicit textual source of constitutional protection . . . that Amendment, not the more generalized notion of `substantive due process,' must be the guide
for analyzing [the] claims").

Respondent contends, however, that because New York
law required him to be present at his trial, see N. Y. Crim.
Proc. Law $ 260.20 (McKinney 1993); N. Y. Crim. Proc. Law

$ 340.50 (McKinney 1994), the prosecution violated his right
to due process by commenting on that presence. He asserts
that our decision in Doyle v. Ohio, 426 U. S. 610 (1976), requires such a holding. In Doyle, the defendants, after being
arrested for selling marijuana, received their Miranda warnings and chose to remain silent. At their trials, both took
the stand and claimed that they had not sold marijuana, but
had been "framed." 426 U. S., at 613. To impeach the defendants, the prosecutors asked each why he had not related
this version of events at the time he was arrested. We held
that this violated the defendants' rights to due process because the Miranda warnings contained an implicit "assurance that silence will carry no penalty." 426 U. S., at 618.

Although there might be reason to reconsider Doyle, we
need not do so here. "[W]e have consistently explained
Doyle as a case where the government had induced silence
by implicitly assuring the defendant that his silence would
not be used against him." Fletcher v. Weir, 455 U. S. 603,
606 (1982) (per curiam). The Miranda warnings had, after
all, specifically given the defendant both the option of speaking and the option of remaining silent--and had then gone

75Cite as: 529 U. S. 61 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
on to say that if he chose the former option what he saidcould be used against him. It is possible to believe that this

contained an implicit promise that his choice of the option ofsilence would not be used against him. It is not possible,
we think, to believe that a similar promise of impunity isimplicit in a statute requiring the defendant to be present
at trial.Respondent contends that this case contains an element of
unfairness even worse than what existed in Doyle: Whereasthe defendant in that case had the ability to avoid impairment of his case by choosing to speak rather than remainsilent, the respondent here (he asserts) had no choice but to
be present at the trial. Though this is far from certain, see,
e. g., People v. Aiken, 45 N. Y. 2d 394, 397, 380 N. E. 2d 272,274 (1978) ("[A] defendant charged with a felony not punishable by death may, by his voluntary and willful absence fromtrial, waive his right to be present at every stage of his
trial"), we shall assume for the sake of argument that it istrue. There is, however, no authority whatever for the
proposition that the impairment of credibility, if any, causedby mandatory presence at trial violates due process. If the
ability to avoid the accusation (or suspicion) of tailoring wereas crucial a factor as respondent contends, one would expect
criminal defendants--in jurisdictions that do not havecompulsory attendance requirements--frequently to absent
themselves from trial when they intend to give testimony.But to our knowledge, a criminal trial without the defendant
present is a rarity. Many long established elements of crim-inal procedure deprive a defendant of advantages he would
otherwise possess--for example, the requirement that heplead to the charge before, rather than after, all the evidence
is in. The consequences of the requirement that he be pres-ent at trial seem to us no worse.

* * *
For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Courtof Appeals for the Second Circuit is reversed, and the case

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this
opinion. It is so ordered.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Breyer joins,
concurring in the judgment.

While I am not persuaded that the prosecutor's summation
crossed the high threshold that separates trial error--even
serious trial error--from the kind of fundamental unfairness
for which the Constitution requires that a state criminal conviction be set aside, cf. Rose v. Lundy, 455 U. S. 509, 543-544
(1982), I must register my disagreement with the Court's
implicit endorsement of her summation.

The defendant's Sixth Amendment right "to be confronted
with the witnesses against him" serves the truth-seeking
function of the adversary process. Moreover, it also reflects
respect for the defendant's individual dignity and reinforces
the presumption of innocence that survives until a guilty verdict is returned. The prosecutor's argument in this case demeaned that process, violated that respect, and ignored that
presumption. Clearly such comment should be discouraged
rather than validated.

The Court's final conclusion, which I join, that the argument survives constitutional scrutiny does not, of course, deprive States or trial judges of the power either to prevent
such argument entirely or to provide juries with instructions
that explain the necessity, and the justifications, for the defendant's attendance at trial.

Accordingly, although I agree with much of what Justice
Ginsburg has written, I concur in the Court's judgment.

The Court today transforms a defendant's presence at trial
from a Sixth Amendment right into an automatic burden on
his credibility. I dissent from the Court's disposition. In

Griffin v. California, 380 U. S. 609 (1965), we held that adefendant's refusal to testify at trial may not be used as evidence of his guilt. In Doyle v. Ohio, 426 U. S. 610 (1976),we held that a defendant's silence after receiving

Miranda
warnings did not warrant a prosecutor's attack on his credi-bility. Both decisions stem from the principle that where

the exercise of constitutional rights is "insolubly ambiguous"
as between innocence and guilt, id., at 617, a prosecutor maynot unfairly encumber those rights by urging the jury to

construe the ambiguity against the defendant.The same principle should decide this case. Ray Agard
attended his trial, as was his constitutional right and his
statutory duty, and he testified in a manner consistent with
other evidence in the case. One evident explanation for the
coherence of his testimony cannot be ruled out: Agard may
have been telling the truth. It is no more possible to know
whether Agard used his presence at trial to figure out how
to tell potent lies from the witness stand than it is to know
whether an accused who remains silent had no exculpatory
story to tell.

The burden today's decision imposes on the exercise of
Sixth Amendment rights is justified, the Court maintains,
because "the central function of the trial . . . is to discover
the truth." See ante, at 73. A trial ideally is a search for
the truth, but I do not agree that the Court's decision advances that search. The generic accusation that today's decision permits the prosecutor to make on summation does not
serve to distinguish guilty defendants from innocent ones.
Every criminal defendant, guilty or not, has the right to attend his trial. U. S. Const., Amdt. 6. Indeed, as the Court
grants, ante, at 74, New York law requires defendants to be
present when tried. It follows that every defendant who
testifies is equally susceptible to a generic accusation about
his opportunity for tailoring. The prosecutorial comment at
issue, tied only to the defendant's presence in the courtroom
and not to his actual testimony, tarnishes the innocent no

less than the guilty. Nor can a jury measure a defendant'scredibility by evaluating the defendant's response to the accusation, for the broadside is fired after the defense has sub-mitted its case. An irrebuttable observation that can be
made about any testifying defendant cannot sort those whotailor their testimony from those who do not, much less the
guilty from the innocent. I

The Court of Appeals took a carefully restrained and mod-erate position in this case. It held that a prosecutor may
not, as part of her summation, use the mere fact of a defend-ant's presence at his trial as the basis for impugning his credibility. A prosecutor who wishes at any stage of a trial toaccuse a defendant of tailoring specific elements of his testimony to fit with particular testimony given by other wit-nesses would, under the decision of the Court of Appeals,
have leave to do so. See 159 F. 3d 98, 99 (CA2 1998). More-over, on cross-examination, a prosecutor would be free to
challenge a defendant's overall credibility by pointing outthat the defendant had the opportunity to tailor his testimony in general, even if the prosecutor could point to nofacts suggesting that the defendant had actually engaged in
tailoring. See 117 F. 3d 696, 708, n. 6 (CA2 1997). TheCourt of Appeals held only that the prosecutor may not
launch a general accusation of tailoring on summation. Seeid., at 709; see also United States v. Chacko, 169 F. 3d 140,
150 (CA2 1999). Thus, the decision below would rein in aprosecutor solely in situations where there is no particular
reason to believe that tailoring has occurred and where thedefendant has no opportunity to rebut the accusation.

The Court of Appeals' judgment was correct in light ofGriffin and Doyle. Those decisions instruct that when a defendant's exercise of a constitutional fair trial right is "insol-ubly ambiguous" as between innocence and guilt, the prosecutor may not urge the jury to construe the bare invocationof the right against the defendant. See

617. To be sure, defendants are not categorically exemptfrom some costs associated with the assertion of their constitutional prerogatives. The Court is correct to say that thetruth-seeking function of trials places demands on defendants. In a proper case, that central function could justify aparticular burden on the exercise of Sixth Amendment
rights. But the interests of truth are not advanced byallowing a prosecutor, at a time when the defendant cannot respond, to invite the jury to convict on the basis of con-duct as consistent with innocence as with guilt. Where burdening a constitutional right will not yield a compensatingbenefit, as in the present case, there is no justification for
imposing the burden.The truth-seeking function of trials may be served by permitting prosecutors to make accusations of tailoring--evenwholly generic accusations of tailoring--as part of crossexamination. Some defendants no doubt do give false testi-mony calculated to fit with the testimony they hear from
other witnesses. If accused on cross-examination of havingtailored their testimony, those defendants might display signals of untrustworthiness that it is the province of the juryto detect and interpret. But when a generic argument is
offered on summation, it cannot in the slightest degree dis-tinguish the guilty from the innocent. It undermines all defendants equally and therefore does not help answer thequestion that is the essence of a trial's search for truth: Is
this particular defendant lying to cover his guilt or truthfullynarrating his innocence?

1 The prosecutor made the following comment on summation: "A lot of
what [the defendant] told you corroborates what the complaining witnesses told you. The only thin[g] that doesn't is the denials of the crimes.
Everything else fits perfectly." App. 46-47. That, according to the
prosecution, is reason for the jury to be suspicious that the defendant
falsely tailored his testimony. The implication of this argument seems to
be that the more a defendant's story hangs together, the more likely it is
that he is lying. To claim that such an argument helps find truth at trial
is to step completely through the looking glass.

80 PORTUONDO v. AGARD

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
In addition to its incapacity to serve the individualizedtruth-finding function of trials, a generic tailoring argument

launched on summation entails the simple unfairness of pre-venting a defendant from answering the charge. This problem was especially pronounced in the instant case. UnderNew York law, defendants generally may not bolster their
own credibility by introducing their prior consistent statements but may introduce such statements to rebut claims ofrecent fabrication. See

People v. McDaniel, 81 N. Y. 2d 10,
16, 611 N. E. 2d 265, 268 (1993); 117 F. 3d, at 715 (Winter,C. J., concurring). Had the prosecution made its tailoring

accusations on cross-examination, Agard might have been
able to prove that his story at trial was the same as it had
been before he heard the testimony of other witnesses. A
prosecutor who can withhold a tailoring accusation until
summation can avert such a rebuttal.

The Court's only support for its choice to ignore the
distinction between summation and cross-examination is
Reagan v. United States, 157 U. S. 301 (1895), a decision
which, by its very terms, does not bear on today's constitutional controversy. It is true, as the Court says, that
Reagan upheld a trial judge's instruction that questioned the
credibility of a testifying defendant in a generic manner, and
it is also true that a defendant is no more able to respond
to an instruction than to a prosecutor's summation. But
Reagan has no force as precedent for this case because, in
the 1895 Court's view, the instruction there at issue did not
burden any constitutional right of the defendant.

The trial court in Reagan instructed the jury that when it
evaluated the credibility of the defendant's testimony, it
could consider that defendants have a powerful interest in
being acquitted, powerful enough that it might induce some
people to lie. See id., at 304-305. This instruction burdened the defendant's right to testify at his own trial. But
the Court that decided Reagan conceived of that right as one
dependent on a statute, not on any constitutional prescrip529US1 Unit: $U34 [09-26-01 08:14:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tion. See id., at 304 (defendant was qualified to testifyunder oath pursuant to an 1878 Act of Congress, ch. 37, 20

Stat. 30, which removed the common-law disability that hadpreviously prevented defendants from giving sworn testimony). No one in that 19th-century case suggested that thetrial court's comment exacted a penalty for the exercise of
any constitutional right.2 It is thus inaccurate for the Courtto portray

Reagan as precedent for the proposition that thedifference between summation and cross-examination "is

not a constitutionally significant distinction." Ante, at 72.Reagan made no determination of constitutional significance
or insignificance, for it addressed no constitutional question.The Court endeavors to bring Reagan within constitutional territory by yoking it to Griffin. The Court assertsthat Griffin relied on the very statute that defined the rights
of the defendant in Reagan and that Griffin's holding makessense only if the statute in Reagan carries constitutional implications. Ante, at 72, n. 3. This argument is flawed in itspremise, because

Griffin rested solidly on the Fifth Amend-ment. The Court in Griffin did refer to the 1878 statute

at issue in Reagan, but it did so only in connection with itsdiscussion of Wilson v. United States, 149 U. S. 60 (1893), a
decision construing a different provision of that statute toprohibit federal prosecutors from commenting to juries on
defendants' failure to testify. See Griffin, 380 U. S., at 612-613. The statute at issue in Reagan and Wilson, now codified at 18 U. S. C. $ 3481, provides that defendants in crimi-nal trials have both the right to testify and the right not

2 The offense charged in Reagan was, moreover, a misdemeanor rather
than a felony. See 157 U. S., at 304. Even today, our cases recognize a
distinction between serious and petty crimes, and we have held that some
provisions of the Sixth Amendment do not apply in petty prosecutions.
See, e. g., Lewis v. United States, 518 U. S. 322 (1996) (right to jury trial
does not attach in trials for petty offenses). The Reagan Court classified
the case before it as belonging to the less serious category of offenses and
explicitly denied the defendant the heightened procedural protections that
attached in trials for more serious crimes. See 157 U. S., at 302-304.

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
to testify. Reagan concerned the former right, Wilson thelatter right, and Griffin the constitutional analogue to the latter right. If the Court in Griffin had regarded the statute assettling the meaning of the Fifth Amendment--an odd position to imagine the Court taking--then it could have restedon Wilson. It did not. It said that Wilson would govern
were the question presented a statutory one, but that thequestion before it was constitutional: "The question remains
whether, statute or not, the comment . . . violates the FifthAmendment." 380 U. S., at 613 (emphasis added). Thus, the
question in Griffin was not controlled by Wilson preciselybecause the statute construed in

Wilson and Reagan wasjust that--a statute--and not a provision of the Constitution.

Accordingly, Griffin provides no support for the Court'sunorthodox contention that Reagan's statutory holding was
actually of constitutional dimension.3

II
The Court offers two arguments in support of its conclu-sion that a prosecutor may make the generic tailoring accusations at issue in this case. First, it suggests that suchcomment has historically not been seen as problematic.

3 I do not question the constitutionality of an instruction in which a
trial court generally advises the jury that in evaluating the credibility of
witnesses, it may take account of the interest of any witness, including
the defendant, in the outcome of a case. The interested-witness instruction given in Agard's case was of this variety. The trial court first told
the jury that it should consider the interest that any interested witness
might have in the outcome. See Tr. 834 ("If you find that any witness
is an interested witness, you should consider such interest in determining the credibility of that person's testimony and the weight to be given
to it."). It then went on to note, as the Court reports, ante, at 73, that
the defendant is an interested witness. See Tr. 834. Any instruction
generally applicable to witnesses will affect defendants who testify, just
as the rules governing the admissibility of testimony at trial will restrict
defendants' testimony as they do the testimony of other witnesses. It is
a far different matter for an instruction or an argument to impose unique
burdens on defendants.

Second, it contends that respondent Agard's case is readilydistinguishable from

Griffin. The Court's historical excursus does not even begin to prove that comments like thosein this case have ever been accepted as constitutional, and

the attempt to distinguish Griffin relies on implausible prem-ises that this Court has previously rejected.

The Court's historical narrative proceeds as follows: In the
early days of the Republic, prosecutors had no "need" tosuggest that defendants might use their presence at trial to

tailor their testimony, because defendants' (unsworn) state-ments at trial could be compared with pretrial statements
that defendants gave as a matter of course. Later, someStates instituted rules requiring defendants to testify before
the other witnesses did,4 thus obviating once again any needto make arguments about tailoring. There is no evidence,
the Court says, that any State ever prohibited the kind ofgeneric argument now at issue until recent times.

5 So it

must be the case that generic tailoring arguments have traditionally been thought unproblematic. Ante, at 65-66.

4 In Brooks v. Tennessee, 406 U. S. 605 (1972), we held this practice unconstitutional under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.

5 In recent years, several state courts have found it improper for prosecutors to make accusations of tailoring based on the defendant's constant
attendance at trial. See, e. g., State v. Cassidy, 236 Conn. 112, 672 A. 2d
899 (1996); State v. Jones, 580 A. 2d 161, 163 (Me. 1990); Hart v. United
States, 538 A. 2d 1146, 1149 (D. C. 1988); State v. Hemingway, 148 Vt. 90,
91-92, 528 A. 2d 746, 747-748 (1987); Commonwealth v. Person, 400 Mass.
136, 138-142, 508 N. E. 2d 88, 90-92 (1987); State v. Johnson, 80 Wash.
App. 337, 908 P. 2d 900 (1996). In Commonwealth v. Elberry, 38 Mass.
App. 912, 645 N. E. 2d 41 (1995), the trial judge sustained defense counsel's
objection to a prosecutor's tailoring argument that burdened the defendant's right to be present at trial and issued the following curative instruction: "Of course, the defendant, who was a witness in this case, was here
during the testimony of other witnesses, but he's got every right to be
here, too. . . . [Y]ou should take everything into consideration in determining credibility, but there is nothing untoward about the defendant being
present when other witnesses are testifying." Id., at 913, 645 N. E. 2d,
at 43.

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
I do not comprehend why the Court finds in this accountany demonstration that the prosecutorial comment at issue

here has a long history of unchallenged use. If prosecutorsin times past had no need to make generic tailoring arguments, it is likely such arguments simply were not made.Notably, the Court calls up no instance of an 18th- or 19thcentury prosecutor's urging that a defendant's presence at
trial facilitated tailored testimony. And if prosecutors didnot make such arguments, courts had no occasion to rule

them out of order. The absence of old cases prohibiting thecomment that the Court now confronts thus scarcely indicates that generic accusations of tailoring have long been
considered constitutional.

The Court's discussion of Griffin is equally unconvincing.
The Court posits that a ban on inviting juries to draw adverse inferences from a defendant's silence differs materially
from a ban on inviting juries to draw adverse inferences from
a defendant's presence, because the inference from silence "is
not . . . `natural or irresistible.' " See ante, at 67 (quoting
Griffin, 380 U. S., at 615) (emphasis added by majority).
This is a startling statement. It fails to convey what the
Court actually said in Griffin, which was that the inference
from silence to guilt is "not always so natural or irresistible."
See ibid. (emphasis added). The statement that an inference is not always natural or irresistible implies that the
inference is indeed natural or irresistible in many, perhaps
most, cases. And so it is. See Mitchell v. United States,
526 U. S. 314, 332 (1999) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (The Griffin
rule "runs exactly counter to normal evidentiary inferences:
If I ask my son whether he saw a movie I had forbidden him
to watch, and he remains silent, the import of his silence is
clear."); Lakeside v. Oregon, 435 U. S. 333, 340 (1978) (It is
"very doubtful" that jurors, left to their own devices, would
not draw adverse inferences from a defendant's failure to testify.). It is precisely because the inference is often natural
(but nonetheless prohibited) that the jury, if a defendant so

85Cite as: 529 U. S. 61 (2000)
Ginsburg, J., dissenting
requests, is instructed not to draw it. Carter v. Kentucky,450 U. S. 288, 301-303 (1981) (An uninstructed jury is likely

to draw adverse inferences from a defendant's failure to tes-tify, so defendants are entitled to have trial courts instruct
juries that no such inference may be drawn.).The inference involved in Griffin is at least as "natural"
or "irresistible" as the inference the prosecutor in Agard'scase invited the jury to draw. There are, to be sure, reasons
why an innocent defendant might not want to testify. Per-haps he fears that his convictions for prior crimes will generate prejudice against him if placed before the jury; perhapshe has an unappealing countenance that could produce the
same effect; perhaps he worries that cross-examination willdrag into public view prior conduct that, though not unlawful, is deeply embarrassing. For similar reasons, an inno-cent person might choose to remain silent after arrest. But
in either the Griffin scenario of silence at trial or the Doylescenario of silence after arrest, something beyond the simple
innocence of the defendant must be hypothesized in order toexplain the defendant's behavior.

Not so in the present case. If a defendant appears at trialand gives testimony that fits the rest of the evidence, sheer
innocence could explain his behavior completely. The infer-ence from silence to guilt in Griffin or from silence to untrustworthiness in Doyle is thus more direct than the infer-ence from presence to tailoring.

6 Unless one has prejudged

6 The Court describes the inference now at issue as one not from presence to tailoring but merely from presence to opportunity to tailor.
Ante, at 71, n. 2. The proposition that Agard simply had the opportunity
to tailor, we note, is not what the prosecutor urged upon the jury. She
encouraged the jury to draw, from the fact of Agard's opportunity, the
inference that he had actually tailored his testimony. See App. 49 (Defendant was able "to sit here and listen to the testimony of all the other
witnesses before he testifie[d]. . . . [He got] to sit here and think what am
I going to say and how am I going to say it? How am I going to fit
it into the evidence? . . . He's a smart man. . . . He used everything to
his advantage.")

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
the defendant as guilty, or unless there are specific reasonsto believe that particular testimony has been altered, the

possibility that the defendant is telling the truth is surelyas good an explanation for the coherence of the defendant's
testimony as any that involves wrongful tailoring. I there-fore disagree with the Court's assertion, ante, at 68, that
the Court of Appeals' decision in Agard's case differs fromour decision in

Griffin by "requir[ing] the jury to do whatis practically impossible."

7 It makes little sense to maintain that juries able to avoid drawing adverse inferencesfrom a defendant's silence would be unable to avoid thinking

that only a defendant's opportunity to spin a web of lies couldexplain the seamlessness of his testimony.

The Court states in the alternative that if proscribing ge-neric accusations of tailoring at summation does not require
the jury to do the impossible, then it prohibits prosecutorsfrom "inviting the jury to do what the jury is perfectly entitled to do." Ante, at 68. The Court offers no prior au-thority, however, for the proposition that a jury may constitutionally draw the inference now at issue. The SecondCircuit thought the matter open, and understandably so
in light of Griffin and Carter. But even if juries were per-mitted to draw the inference in question, it would not follow
that prosecutors could urge juries to draw it. Doyle pro-hibits prosecutors from urging juries to draw adverse inferences from a defendant's choice to remain silent after re7 In fact, the Court of Appeals' decision in Agard's case does not tell
juries to do anything; it merely prevents prosecutors from inviting them
to do something. I presume that the Court means to say that the Court
of Appeals' decision prohibits prosecutors from inviting juries to do something jurors will inevitably do even without invitation. In either case,
however, the Court's confidence that all juries will naturally regard the
defendant's presence at trial as a reason to be suspicious of his testimony
is perplexing in light of the Court's equal confidence that allowing comment on the same subject is "essential" to the truth-finding function of the
trial. See ante, at 73. If all juries think this anyway, the pursuit of truth
will not suffer if they are not told to think it.

ceiving Miranda warnings, but the Court today shows no
readiness to say that juries may not draw that inference
themselves. See ante, at 74-75. It therefore seems unproblematic to hold that a prosecutor's latitude for argument
is narrower than a jury's latitude for assessment.

In its final endeavor to distinguish the two inferences, the
Court maintains that the one in Griffin goes to a defendant's
guilt but the one now at issue goes merely to a defendant's
credibility as a witness. See ante, at 69. But it is dominantly in cases where the physical evidence is inconclusive
that prosecutors will concentrate all available firepower on
the credibility of a testifying defendant. Argument that
goes to the defendant's credibility in such a case also goes to
guilt. Indeed, the first sentence of the Court's account of
the trial in this case acknowledges that the questions of guilt
and credibility were coextensive. See ante, at 63 (Agard's
trial "ultimately came down to a credibility determination.").

The Court emphasizes that a prosecutor may make an
issue of a defendant's credibility, and it points for support to
our decisions in Jenkins v. Anderson, 447 U. S. 231 (1980),
and Brooks v. Tennessee, 406 U. S. 605 (1972). See ante, at
69-70. But again, the distinction between cross-examination
and summation is critical. Cross-examination is the criminal trial's primary means of contesting the credibility of any
witness, and a defendant who is also a witness may of course
be cross-examined. Jenkins supports the proposition that
cross-examination is of sufficient value as an aid to finding
truth at trial that prosecutors may sometimes question defendants even about matters that may touch on their constitutional rights, and Brooks suggests that cross-examination
can expose a defendant who tailors his testimony. See Jenkins, 447 U. S., at 233, 238; Brooks, 406 U. S., at 609-612.
Thus the prosecutor's tactics in Jenkins and our own counsel
in Brooks are entirely consistent with the moderate restriction on prosecutorial license that the Court today rejects.

In the end, we are left with a prosecutorial practice thatburdens the constitutional rights of defendants, that cannot

be justified by reference to the trial's aim of sorting guiltydefendants from innocent ones, and that is not supported by
our case law. The restriction that the Court of Appealsplaced on generic accusations of tailoring is both moderate
and warranted. That court declared it permissible for theprosecutor to comment on "what the defendant testified to
regarding pertinent events"--"the fit between the testimonyof the defendant and other witnesses." 159 F. 3d, at 99.
What is impermissible, the Second Circuit held, is simply andonly a summation "bolstering . . . the prosecution witnesses'
credibility vis-a-vis the defendant's based solely on the de-fendant's exercise of a constitutional right to be present during the trial." Ibid. I would affirm that sound judgmentand therefore dissent from the Court's disposition.

WASHINGTON, et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 98-1701. Argued December 7, 1999--Decided March 6, 2000*
After the supertanker Torrey Canyon spilled crude oil off the coast of

England in 1967, both Congress, in the Ports and Waterways Safety Act
of 1972 (PWSA), and the State of Washington enacted more stringent
regulations for tankers and provided for more comprehensive remedies
in the event of an oil spill. The ensuing question of federal pre-emption
of the State's laws was addressed in Ray v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 435
U. S. 151. In 1989, the supertanker Exxon Valdez ran aground in
Alaska, causing the largest oil spill in United States history. Again,
both Congress and Washington responded. Congress enacted the Oil
Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA). The State created a new agency and directed it to establish standards to provide the "best achievable protection" (BAP) from oil spill damages. That agency promulgated tanker
design, equipment, reporting, and operating requirements. Petitioner
International Association of Independent Tanker Owners (Intertanko),
a trade association of tanker operators, brought this suit seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against state and local officials responsible for
enforcing the BAP regulations. Upholding the regulations, the District
Court rejected Intertanko's arguments that the BAP standards invaded
an area long pre-empted by the Federal Government. At the appeal
stage, the United States intervened on Intertanko's behalf, contending
that the District Court's ruling failed to give sufficient weight to the
substantial foreign affairs interests of the Federal Government. The
Ninth Circuit held that the State could enforce its laws, save one requiring vessels to install certain navigation and towing equipment, which
was "virtually identical to" requirements declared pre-empted in Ray.

Held: Washington's regulations regarding general navigation watch procedures, crew English language skills and training, and maritime casualty reporting are pre-empted by the comprehensive federal regulatory scheme governing oil tankers; these cases are remanded so the

validity of other Washington regulations may be assessed in light of the
considerable federal interest at stake. Pp. 99-117.

(a) The State has enacted legislation in an area where the federal
interest has been manifest since the beginning of the Republic and is
now well established. Congress has, beginning with the Tank Vessel
Act of 1936, enacted a series of statutes pertaining to maritime tanker
transports. These include the PWSA, Title I of which authorizes, but
does not require, the Coast Guard to enact measures for controlling
vessel traffic or for protecting navigation and the marine environment,
33 U. S. C. $ 1223(a), and Title II of which, as amended, requires the
Coast Guard to issue regulations addressing the design, construction,
alteration, repair, maintenance, operation, equipping, personnel qualification, and manning of covered vessels, 46 U. S. C. $ 3703(a). Congress
later enacted OPA, Title I of which, among other things, imposes liability for both removal costs and damages on parties responsible for an oil
spill, 33 U. S. C. $ 2702, and includes two saving clauses preserving the
States' authority to impose additional liability, requirements, and penalties, $$ 2718(a) and (c). Congress has also ratified international agreements in this area, including the International Convention of Standards
of Training Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW).
Pp. 99-103.

(b) In Ray, the Court held that the PWSA and Coast Guard regulations promulgated under that Act pre-empted Washington's pilotage requirement, limitation on tanker size, and tanker design and construction
rules. The Ray Court's interpretation of the PWSA is correct and controlling here. Its basic analytic structure explains why federal preemption analysis applies to the challenged regulations and allows scope
and due recognition for the traditional authority of the States and localities to regulate some matters of local concern. In narrowing the preemptive effect given the PWSA in Ray, the Ninth Circuit placed more
weight on OPA's saving clauses than they can bear. Like Title I of
OPA, in which they are found, the saving clauses are limited to regulations governing liability and compensation for oil pollution, and do not
extend to rules regulating vessel operation, design, or manning. Thus,
the pre-emptive effect of the PWSA and its regulations is not affected
by OPA, and Ray's holding survives OPA's enactment undiminished.
The Ray Court's prefatory observation that an "assumption" that the
States' historic police powers were not to be superseded by federal law
unless that was the clear and manifest congressional purpose does not
mean that a presumption against pre-emption aids the Court's analysis
here. An assumption of nonpre-emption is not triggered when the
State regulates in an area where there has been a history of significant
federal presence. The Ray Court held, among other things, that Con529US1 Unit: $U35 [09-26-01 09:32:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Syllabus
gress, in PWSA Title I, preserved state authority to regulate the peculiarities of local waters, such as depth and narrowness, if there is no
conflict with federal regulatory determinations, see 435 U. S., at 171-
172, 178, but further held that Congress, in PWSA Title II, mandated
uniform federal rules on the subjects or matters there specified, id., at
168. Thus, under Ray's interpretation of the Title II provision now
found at 46 U. S. C. $ 3703(a), only the Federal Government may regulate
the design, construction, alteration, repair, maintenance, operation,
equipping, personnel qualification, and manning of tankers. The Court
today reaffirms Ray's holding on this point. Congress has left no room
for state regulation of these matters. See Fidelity Fed. Sav. & Loan
Assn. v. De la Cuesta, 458 U. S. 141. Although the Ray Court acknowledged that the existence of some overlapping coverage between the two
PWSA titles may make it difficult to determine whether a pre-emption
question is controlled by conflict pre-emption principles, applicable generally to Title I, or by field pre-emption rules, applicable generally to
Title II, the Court declined to resolve every question by the greater
pre-emptive force of Title II. Thus, conflict pre-emption will be applicable in some, although not all, cases. Useful inquiries in determining
which title governs include whether the regulation in question is justified by conditions unique to a particular port or waterway, see Ray, 435
U. S., at 175, or whether it is of limited extraterritorial effect, not requiring the tanker to modify its primary conduct outside the specific body
of water purported to justify the local rule, see id., at 159-160, 171.
Pp. 103-112.

(c) The field pre-emption rule surrounding PWSA Title II and 46
U. S. C. $ 3703(a) and the superseding effect of additional federal statutes are illustrated by the pre-emption of four of Washington's tanker
regulations, the attempted reach of which is well demonstrated by the
briefs and record. First, the imposition of a series of training requirements on a tanker's crew does not address matters unique to Washington waters, but imposes requirements that control the staffing, operation, and manning of a tanker outside of those waters. The training
and drill requirements pertain to "operation" and "personnel qualifications" and so are pre-empted by $ 3703(a). That training is a field
reserved to the Federal Government is further confirmed by the circumstance that the STCW Convention addresses crew "training" and
"qualification" requirements, and that the United States has enacted
crew training regulations. Second, the imposition of English language
proficiency requirements on a tanker's crew is not limited to governing
local traffic or local peculiarities. It is pre-empted by $ 3703(a) as a
"personnel qualification" and by 33 U. S. C. $ 1228(a)(7), which requires
that any vessel operating in United States waters have at least one

licensed deck officer on the navigation bridge who is capable of clearly
understanding English. Third, Washington's general requirement that
the navigation watch consist of at least two licensed deck officers, a
helmsman, and a lookout is pre-empted as an attempt to regulate a tanker's "operation" and "manning" under 46 U. S. C. $ 3703(a). Fourth, the
requirement that vessels in Washington waters report certain marine
casualties regardless of where in the world they occurred cannot stand
in light of Coast Guard regulations on the same subject that Congress
intended be the sole source of a vessel's reporting obligations, see

$$ 6101, 3717(a)(4). On remand, Washington may argue that certain of
its regulations, such as its watch requirement in times of restricted visibility, are of limited extraterritorial effect, are necessary to address the
peculiarities of Puget Sound, and therefore are not subject to Title II
field pre-emption, but should instead be evaluated under Title I conflict
pre-emption analysis. Pp. 112-116.

(d) It is preferable that petitioners' substantial arguments as to preemption of the remaining Washington regulations be considered by the
Ninth Circuit or by the District Court within the framework this Court
has herein discussed. The United States did not participate in these
cases until appeal, and resolution of the litigation would benefit from
the development of a full record by all interested parties. If, pending
adjudication on remand, Washington threatens to begin enforcing its
regulations, the lower courts would weigh any stay application under
the appropriate legal standards in light of the principles discussed
herein and with recognition of the national interests at stake. Ultimately, it is largely for Congress and the Coast Guard to confront
whether their regulatory scheme, which demands a high degree of
uniformity, is adequate. States, as well as environmental groups and
local port authorities, will participate in the process. See $ 3703(a).

94 UNITED STATES v. LOCKE

Opinion of the Court
Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.
The maritime oil transport industry presents ever-present,
all too real dangers of oil spills from tanker ships, spillswhich could be catastrophes for the marine environment.

After the supertanker Torrey Canyon spilled its cargo of120,000 tons of crude oil off the coast of Cornwall, England,
in 1967, both Congress and the State of Washington enactedmore stringent regulations for these tankers and provided
for more comprehensive remedies in the event of an oil spill.The ensuing question of federal pre-emption of the State's
laws was addressed by the Court in Ray v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 435 U. S. 151 (1978).In 1989, the supertanker

Exxon Valdez ran aground in
Prince William Sound, Alaska, and its cargo of more than 53million gallons of crude oil caused the largest oil spill in

United States history. Again, both Congress and the Stateof Washington responded. Congress enacted new statutory
provisions, and Washington adopted regulations governing
tanker operations and design. Today we must determine
whether these more recent state laws can stand despite the
comprehensive federal regulatory scheme governing oil
tankers. Relying on the same federal statute that controlled the analysis in Ray, we hold that some of the State's
regulations are pre-empted; as to the balance of the regulations, we remand the case so their validity may be assessed
in light of the considerable federal interest at stake and in
conformity with the principles we now discuss.

Opinion of the Court

I
The State of Washington embraces some of the Nation'smost significant waters and coastal regions. Its Pacific

Ocean seacoast consists, in large part, of wave-exposed rockyheadlands separated by stretches of beach. Washington
borders as well on the Columbia River estuary, dividingWashington from Oregon. Two other large estuaries, Grays
Harbor and Willapa Bay, are also within Washington's wa-ters. Of special significance in these cases is the inland sea
of Puget Sound, a 2,500 square mile body of water consistingof inlets, bays, and channels. More than 200 islands are located within the sound, and it sustains fisheries and plantand animal life of immense value to the Nation and to the
world.Passage from the Pacific Ocean to the quieter Puget Sound
is through the Strait of Juan de Fuca, a channel 12 mileswide and 65 miles long which divides Washington from the
Canadian Province of British Columbia. The internationalboundary is located midchannel. Access to Vancouver, Canada's largest port, is through the strait. Traffic inboundfrom the Pacific Ocean, whether destined to ports in the
United States or Canada, is routed through Washington'swaters; outbound traffic, whether from a port in Washington
or Vancouver, is directed through Canadian waters. Thepattern had its formal adoption in a 1979 agreement entered
into by the United States and Canada. Agreement for a Co-operative Vessel Traffic Management System for the Juan de
Fuca Region, 32 U. S. T. 377, T. I. A. S. No. 9706.In addition to holding some of our vital waters, Washington is the site of major installations for the Nation's oil indus-try and the destination or shipping point for huge volumes
of oil and its end products. Refineries and product termi-nals are located adjacent to Puget Sound in ports including
Cherry Point, Ferndale, Tacoma, and Anacortes. Canadianrefineries are found near Vancouver on Burrard Inlet and
the lower Fraser River. Crude oil is transported by sea to

96 UNITED STATES v. LOCKE

Opinion of the Court
Puget Sound. Most is extracted from Alaska's North Slopereserve and is shipped to Washington on United States flag

vessels. Foreign-flag vessels arriving from nations suchas Venezuela and Indonesia also call at Washington's oil
installations.The bulk of oil transported on water is found in tankers,
vessels which consist of a group of tanks contained in a shipshaped hull, propelled by an isolated machinery plant at thestern. The Court described the increase in size and numbers of these ships close to three decades ago in Askew v.
American Waterways Operators, Inc., 411 U. S. 325, 335
(1973), noting that the average vessel size increased from
16,000 tons during World War II to 76,000 tons in 1966.
(The term "tons" refers to "deadweight tons," a way of measuring the cargo-carrying capacity of the vessels.) Between
1955 and 1968, the world tanker fleet grew from 2,500 vessels
to 4,300. Ibid. By December 1973, 366 tankers in the
world tanker fleet were in excess of 175,000 tons, see 1
M. Tusiani, The Petroleum Shipping Industry 79 (1996), and
by 1998 the number of vessels considered "tankers" in the
merchant fleets of the world numbered 6,739, see U. S. Dept.
of Transp., Maritime Administration, Merchant Fleets of the
World 1 (Oct. 1998).

The size of these vessels, the frequency of tanker operations, and the vast amount of oil transported by vessels with
but one or two layers of metal between the cargo and the
water present serious risks. Washington's waters have
been subjected to oil spills and further threatened by near
misses. In December 1984, for example, the tanker ARCO
Anchorage grounded in Port Angeles Harbor and spilled
239,000 gallons of Alaskan crude oil. The most notorious oil
spill in recent times was in Prince William Sound, Alaska,
where the grounding of the Exxon Valdez released more
than 11 million gallons of crude oil and, like the Torrey Canyon spill before it, caused public officials intense concern
over the threat of a spill.

Opinion of the Court
Washington responded by enacting the state regulationsnow in issue. The legislature created the Office of Marine

Safety, which it directed to establish standards for spill pre-vention plans to provide "the best achievable protection
[BAP] from damages caused by the discharge of oil." Wash.Rev. Code $ 88.46.040(3) (1994). The Office of Marine Safety
then promulgated the tanker design, equipment, reporting,
and operating requirements now subject to attack by pe-titioners. Wash. Admin. Code (WAC) $ 317-21-130

et seq.
(1999). A summary of the relevant regulations, as describedby the Court of Appeals, is set out in the Appendix,

infra.
If a vessel fails to comply with the Washington rules,
possible sanctions include statutory penalties, restrictions of
the vessel's operations in state waters, and a denial of entry
into state waters. Wash. Rev. Code $$ 88.46.070, 88.46.080,
88.46.090 (1994).

Petitioner International Association of Independent
Tanker Owners (Intertanko) is a trade association whose 305
members own or operate more than 2,000 tankers of both
United States and foreign registry. The organization represents approximately 80% of the world's independently owned
tanker fleet; and an estimated 60% of the oil imported into
the United States is carried on Intertanko vessels. The
association brought this suit seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against state and local officials responsible for
enforcing the BAP regulations. Groups interested in environmental preservation intervened in defense of the laws.
Intertanko argued that Washington's BAP standards invaded areas long occupied by the Federal Government and
imposed unique requirements in an area where national uniformity was mandated. Intertanko further contended that
if local political subdivisions of every maritime nation were
to impose differing regulatory regimes on tanker operations,
the goal of national governments to develop effective international environmental and safety standards would be
defeated.

98 UNITED STATES v. LOCKE

Opinion of the Court
Although the United States declined to intervene whenthe case was in the District Court, the governments of 13

ocean-going nations expressed concerns through a diplomaticnote directed to the United States. Intertanko lodged a
copy of the note with the District Court. The concernedgovernments represented that "legislation by the State of
Washington on tanker personnel, equipment and operations
would cause inconsistency between the regulatory regime ofthe US Government and that of an individual State of the

US. Differing regimes in different parts of the US wouldcreate uncertainty and confusion. This would also set an
unwelcome precedent for other Federally administered countries." Note Verbale from the Royal Danish Embassy to
the U. S. Dept. of State 1 (June 14, 1996).

The District Court rejected all of Intertanko's arguments
and upheld the state regulations. International Assn. of
Independent Tanker Owners (Intertanko) v. Lowry, 947
F. Supp. 1484 (WD Wash. 1996). The appeal followed, and
at that stage the United States intervened on Intertanko's
behalf, contending that the District Court's ruling failed to
give sufficient weight to the substantial foreign affairs interests of the Federal Government. The United States Court
of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the State could
enforce its laws, save the one requiring the vessels to install
certain navigation and towing equipment. 148 F. 3d 1053
(1998). The Court of Appeals reasoned that this requirement, found in WAC $ 317-21-265, was "virtually identical
to" requirements declared pre-empted in Ray v. Atlantic
Richfield Co., 435 U. S. 151 (1978). 148 F. 3d, at 1066. Over
Judge Graber's dissent, the Court of Appeals denied petitions for rehearing en banc. 159 F. 3d 1220 (1998). Judge
Graber, although unwilling, without further analysis, to conclude that the panel reached the wrong result, argued that
the opinion was "incorrect in two exceptionally important
respects: (1) The opinion places too much weight on two
clauses in Title I of OPA 90 [The Oil Pollution Act of 1990]

that limit OPA 90's preemptive effect. (2) Portions of theopinion that discuss the Coast Guard regulations are inconsistent with Ninth Circuit and Supreme Court precedent."Id., at 1221. We granted certiorari and now reverse. 527
U. S. 1063 (1999). II

The State of Washington has enacted legislation in an areawhere the federal interest has been manifest since the beginning of our Republic and is now well established. The au-thority of Congress to regulate interstate navigation, without embarrassment from intervention of the separate Statesand resulting difficulties with foreign nations, was cited in
the Federalist Papers as one of the reasons for adopting theConstitution.

E. g., The Federalist Nos. 44, 12, 64. In 1789,the First Congress enacted a law by which vessels with a

federal certificate were entitled to "the benefits granted byany law of the United States." Act of Sept. 1, 1789, ch. 11,

$ 1, 1 Stat. 55. The importance of maritime trade and theemergence of maritime transport by steamship resulted in
further federal licensing requirements enacted to promotetrade and to enhance the safety of crew members and passengers. See Act of July 7, 1838, ch. 191, 5 Stat. 304; Act ofMar. 3, 1843, ch. 94, 5 Stat. 626. In 1871, Congress enacted
a comprehensive scheme of regulation for steam poweredvessels, including provisions for licensing captains, chief
mates, engineers, and pilots. Act of Feb. 28, 1871, ch. 100,16 Stat. 440.

The Court in Cooley v. Board of Wardens of Port of Philadelphia ex rel. Soc. for Relief of Distressed Pilots, 12 How.299 (1852), stated that there would be instances in which

state regulation of maritime commerce is inappropriate evenabsent the exercise of federal authority, although in the case
before it the Court found the challenged state regulationswere permitted in light of local needs and conditions.
Where Congress had acted, however, the Court had littledifficulty in finding state vessel requirements were pre529US1 Unit: $U35 [09-26-01 09:32:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN
100 UNITED STATES v. LOCKE

Opinion of the Court
empted by federal laws which governed the certification of
vessels and standards of operation. Gibbons v. Ogden, 9
Wheat. 1 (1824), invalidated a New York law that attempted
to grant a monopoly to operate steamboats on the ground it
was inconsistent with the coasting license held by the vessel
owner challenging the exclusive franchise. And in Sinnot v.
Davenport, 22 How. 227 (1859), the Court decided that the
federal license held by the vessel contained "the only guards
and restraints, which Congress has seen fit to annex to the
privileges of ships and vessels engaged in the coasting
trade." Id., at 241. The Court went on to explain that in
such a circumstance, state laws on the subject must yield:
"In every such case, the act of Congress or treaty is supreme;
and the law of the State, though enacted in the exercise of
powers not controverted, must yield to it." Id., at 243.

Against this background, Congress has enacted a series of
statutes pertaining to maritime tanker transports and has
ratified international agreements on the subject. We begin
by referring to the principal statutes and international instruments discussed by the parties.

1. The Tank Vessel Act.

The Tank Vessel Act of 1936, 49 Stat. 1889, enacted specific
requirements for operation of covered vessels. The Act provided that "[i]n order to secure effective provisions against
the hazards of life and property," additional federal rules
could be adopted with respect to the "design and construction, alteration, or repair of such vessels," "the operation of
such vessels," and "the requirements of the manning of such
vessels and the duties and qualifications of the officers and
crews thereof." The purpose of the Act was to establish "a
reasonable and uniform set of rules and regulations concerning . . . vessels carrying the type of cargo deemed dangerous." H. R. Rep. No. 2962, 74th Cong., 2d Sess., 2 (1936).
The Tank Vessel Act was the primary source for regulating

101Cite as: 529 U. S. 89 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
tank vessels for the next 30 years, until the Torrey Canyongrounding led Congress to take new action.

2. The Ports and Waterways Safety Act of 1972.

Responding to the Torrey Canyon spill, Congress enactedthe Ports and Waterways Safety Act of 1972 (PWSA). The

Act, as amended by the Port and Tanker Safety Act of 1978,
92 Stat. 1471, contains two somewhat overlapping titles, bothof which may, as the

Ray Court explained, preclude enforcement of state laws, though not by the same pre-emption anal-ysis. Title I concerns vessel traffic "in any port or place

under the jurisdiction of the United States." 110 Stat. 3934,33 U. S. C. $ 1223(a)(1) (1994 ed., Supp. III). Under Title I,
the Coast Guard may enact measures for controlling vesseltraffic or for protecting navigation and the marine environment, but it is not required to do so. Ibid.Title II does require the Coast Guard to issue regulations,
regulations addressing the "design, construction, alteration,
repair, maintenance, operation, equipping, personnel qualification, and manning of vessels . . . that may be necessary for
increased protection against hazards to life and property, for
navigation and vessel safety, and for enhanced protection of
the marine environment." 46 U. S. C. $ 3703(a).

The critical provisions of the PWSA described above remain operative, but the Act has been amended, most significantly by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA), 104 Stat. 484.
OPA, enacted in response to the Exxon Valdez spill, requires
separate discussion.

3. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990.

The OPA contains nine titles, two having the most significance for these cases. Title I is captioned "Oil Pollution Liability, and Compensation" and adds extensive new provisions
to the United States Code. See 104 Stat. 2375, 33 U. S. C.

$ 2701 et seq. (1994 ed. and Supp. III). Title I imposes liability (for both removal costs and damages) on parties re529US1 Unit: $U35 [09-26-01 09:32:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN
102 UNITED STATES v. LOCKE

Opinion of the Court
sponsible for an oil spill. $ 2702. Other provisions providedefenses to, and limitations on, this liability. 33 U. S. C.

$$ 2703, 2704. Of considerable importance to these cases areOPA's saving clauses, found in Title I of the Act, $ 2718, and
to be discussed below.Title IV of OPA is entitled "Prevention and Removal."
For the most part, it amends existing statutory provisions
or instructs the Secretary of Transportation (whose depart-ments include the Coast Guard) to take action under previous grants of rulemaking authority. For example, Title IVinstructs the Coast Guard to require reporting of marine casualties resulting in a "significant harm to the environment."46 U. S. C. $ 6101(a)(5) (1994 ed. and Supp. V). Title IV further requires the Secretary to issue regulations to define
those areas, including Puget Sound, on which single hulled
tankers shall be escorted by other vessels. 104 Stat. 523.
By incremental dates specified in the Act, all covered tanker
vessels must have a double hull. 46 U. S. C. $ 3703a.

4. Treaties and International Agreements.

The scheme of regulation includes a significant and intricate complex of international treaties and maritime agreements bearing upon the licensing and operation of vessels.
We are advised by the United States that the international
regime depends upon the principle of reciprocity. That is to
say, the certification of a vessel by the government of its
own flag nation warrants that the ship has complied with
international standards, and vessels with those certificates
may enter ports of the signatory nations. Brief for United
States 3.

Illustrative of treaties and agreements to which the
United States is a party are the International Convention
for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974, 32 U. S. T. 47, T. I. A. S.
No. 9700, the International Convention for Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, S. Exec. Doc. C, 93-1, 12 I. L. M.

of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers,
With Annex, 1978 (STCW), S. Exec. Doc. EE, 96-1, C. T. I. A.
No. 7624.

The United States argues that these treaties, as the supreme law of the land, have pre-emptive force over the state
regulations in question here. We need not reach that issue
at this stage of the case because the state regulations we
address in detail below are pre-empted by federal statute
and regulations. The existence of the treaties and agreements on standards of shipping is of relevance, of course, for
these agreements give force to the longstanding rule that
the enactment of a uniform federal scheme displaces state
law, and the treaties indicate Congress will have demanded
national uniformity regarding maritime commerce. See
Ray, 435 U. S., at 166 (recognizing Congress anticipated "arriving at international standards for building tank vessels"
and understanding "the Nation was to speak with one voice"
on these matters). In later proceedings, if it is deemed necessary for full disposition of the case, it should be open to
the parties to argue whether the specific international agreements and treaties are of binding, pre-emptive force. We do
not reach those questions, for it may be that pre-emption
principles applicable to the basic federal statutory structure
will suffice, upon remand, for a complete determination.

III
In Ray v. Atlantic Richfield, supra, the Court was asked
to review, in light of an established federal and international
regulatory scheme, comprehensive tanker regulations imposed by the State of Washington. The Court held that the
PWSA and Coast Guard regulations promulgated under that
Act pre-empted a state pilotage requirement, Washington's
limitation on tanker size, and tanker design and construction rules.

Opinion of the Court
In these cases, petitioners relied on Ray to argue that
Washington's more recent state regulations were preempted as well. The Court of Appeals, however, concluded
that Ray retained little validity in light of subsequent action
by Congress. We disagree. The Ray Court's interpretation of the PWSA is correct and controlling. Its basic analytic structure explains why federal pre-emption analysis applies to the challenged regulations and allows scope and due
recognition for the traditional authority of the States and
localities to regulate some matters of local concern.

At the outset, it is necessary to explain that the essential
framework of Ray, and of the PWSA which it interpreted,
are of continuing force, neither having been superseded by
subsequent authority relevant to these cases. In narrowing
the pre-emptive effect given the PWSA in Ray, the Court of
Appeals relied upon OPA's saving clauses, finding in their
language a return of authority to the States. Title I of OPA
contains two saving clauses, stating:

"(a) Preservation of State authorities . . .

"Nothing in this Act or the Act of March 3, 1851
shall--

"(1) affect, or be construed or interpreted as preempting, the authority of any State or political subdivision thereof from imposing any additional liability
or requirements with respect to--

"(A) the discharge of oil or other pollution by oil
within such State . . . .. . . . .

"(c) Additional requirements and liabilities; penalties
"Nothing in this Act, the Act of March 3, 1851 (46
U. S. C. 183 et seq.), or section 9509 of [the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U. S. C. 9509)], shall in any way
affect, or be construed to affect, the authority of the
United States or any State or political subdivision
thereof--

Opinion of the Court
"(1) to impose additional liability or additionalrequirements

. . . . .
"relating to the discharge, or substantial threat of adischarge, of oil." 33 U. S. C. $ 2718.

The Court of Appeals placed more weight on the savingclauses than those provisions can bear, either from a textual
standpoint or from a consideration of the whole federal regu-latory scheme of which OPA is but a part.

The saving clauses are found in Title I of OPA, captionedOil Pollution Liability and Compensation and creating a liability scheme for oil pollution. In contrast to the Washing-ton rules at issue here, Title I does not regulate vessel operation, design, or manning. Placement of the saving clausesin Title I of OPA suggests that Congress intended to preserve state laws of a scope similar to the matters containedin Title I of OPA, not all state laws similar to the matters
covered by the whole of OPA or to the whole subject of mari-time oil transport. The evident purpose of the saving
clauses is to preserve state laws which, rather than imposingsubstantive regulation of a vessel's primary conduct, establish liability rules and financial requirements relating to oilspills. See Gutierrez v. Ada, 528 U. S. 250, 255 (2000) (words
of a statute should be interpreted consistent with theirneighbors to avoid giving unintended breadth to an Act of
Congress).Our conclusion is fortified by Congress' decision to limit
the saving clauses by the same key words it used in declaringthe scope of Title I of OPA. Title I of OPA permits recovery
of damages involving vessels "from which oil is discharged,or which pos[e] the substantial threat of a discharge of oil."
33 U. S. C. $ 2702(a). The saving clauses, in parallel manner,permit States to impose liability or requirements "relating
to the discharge, or substantial threat of a discharge, of oil."$ 2718(c). In its titles following Title I, OPA addresses matters including licensing and certificates of registry, 104 Stat.

id., at 511; manning standards for foreign vessels, id., at 513;
reporting of marine casualties, ibid.; minimum standards forplating thickness,

id., at 515; tank vessel manning requirements, id., at 517; and tank vessel construction standards,
id., at 517-518, among other extensive regulations. If Congress had intended to disrupt national uniformity in all of
these matters, it would not have done so by placement of thesaving clauses in Title I.

The saving clauses are further limited in effect to "thisAct, the Act of March 3, 1851 . . . , or section 9509 of [the
Internal Revenue Code]." $$ 2718(a) and (c). These explicit qualifiers are inconsistent with interpreting the saving
clauses to alter the pre-emptive effect of the PWSA or regulations promulgated thereunder. The text of the statute indicates no intent to allow States to impose wide-ranging regulation of the at-sea operation of tankers. The clauses may
preserve a State's ability to enact laws of a scope similar to
Title I, but do not extend to subjects addressed in the other
titles of the Act or other acts.

Limiting the saving clauses as we have determined respects the established federal-state balance in matters of
maritime commerce between the subjects as to which the
States retain concurrent powers and those over which the
federal authority displaces state control. We have upheld
state laws imposing liability for pollution caused by oil spills.
See Askew v. American Waterways Operators, Inc., 411
U. S., at 325. Our view of OPA's saving clauses preserves
this important role for the States, which is unchallenged
here. We think it quite unlikely that Congress would use a
means so indirect as the saving clauses in Title I of OPA to
upset the settled division of authority by allowing States to
impose additional unique substantive regulation on the atsea conduct of vessels. We decline to give broad effect to
saving clauses where doing so would upset the careful regulatory scheme established by federal law. See, e. g., Morales

American Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. Central Office Telephone, Inc., 524 U. S. 214, 227-228 (1998).From the text of OPA and the long-established understanding of the appropriate balance between federal andstate regulation of maritime commerce, we hold that the
pre-emptive effect of the PWSA and regulations promulgated under it are not affected by OPA. We doubt Congresswill be surprised by our conclusion, for the Conference

Report on OPA shared our view that the statute "does notdisturb the Supreme Court's decision in

Ray v. Atlantic
Richfield Co., 435 U. S. 151 (1978)." H. R. Conf. Rep.No. 101-653, p. 122 (1990). The holding in

Ray also survives
the enactment of OPA undiminished, and we turn to a de-tailed discussion of that case.

As we mentioned above, the Ray Court confronted a claimby the operator of a Puget Sound refinery that federal law
precluded Washington from enforcing laws imposing certainsubstantive requirements on tankers. The

Ray Court prefaced its analysis of the state regulations with the following
observation:

"The Court's prior cases indicate that when a State'sexercise of its police power is challenged under the Supremacy Clause, `we start with the assumption that the
historic police powers of the States were not to be su-perseded by the Federal Act unless that was the clear

and manifest purpose of Congress.' Rice v. Santa Fe
Elevator Corp., 331 U. S. 218, 230 (1947)." 435 U. S.,
at 157.

The fragmentary quote from Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator
Corp., 331 U. S. 218 (1947), does not support the scope given
to it by the Court of Appeals or by respondents.

Ray quoted but a fragment of a much longer paragraph
found in Rice. The quoted fragment is followed by extensive and careful qualifications to show the different ap529US1 Unit: $U35 [09-26-01 09:32:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN
108 UNITED STATES v. LOCKE

Opinion of the Court
proaches taken by the Court in various contexts. We neednot discuss that careful explanation in detail, however. To

explain the full intent of the Rice quotation, it suffices toquote in full the sentence in question and two sentences preceding it. The Rice opinion stated: "The question in eachcase is what the purpose of Congress was. Congress legislated here in a field which the States have traditionally occupied. So we start with the assumption that the historic po-lice powers of the States were not to be superseded by the

Federal Act unless that was the clear and manifest purposeof Congress." 331 U. S., at 230 (citations omitted).

The qualification given by the word "so" and by the preceding sentences in Rice are of considerable consequence.
As Rice indicates, an "assumption" of nonpre-emption is not
triggered when the State regulates in an area where there
has been a history of significant federal presence. See also
Jones v. Rath Packing Co., 430 U. S. 519, 525 (1977) ("assumption" is triggered where "the field which Congress is
said to have pre-empted has been traditionally occupied by
the States"); Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U. S. 470, 485 (1996)
(citing Rice in case involving medical negligence, a subject
historically regulated by the States). In Ray, and in the
case before us, Congress has legislated in the field from the
earliest days of the Republic, creating an extensive federal
statutory and regulatory scheme.

The state laws now in question bear upon national and
international maritime commerce, and in this area there is
no beginning assumption that concurrent regulation by the
State is a valid exercise of its police powers. Rather, we
must ask whether the local laws in question are consistent
with the federal statutory structure, which has as one of its
objectives a uniformity of regulation for maritime commerce.
No artificial presumption aids us in determining the scope of
appropriate local regulation under the PWSA, which, as we
discuss below, does preserve, in Title I of that Act, the historic role of the States to regulate local ports and waters

529US1 Unit: $U35 [09-26-01 09:32:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN

109Cite as: 529 U. S. 89 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
under appropriate circumstances. At the same time, as wealso discuss below, uniform, national rules regarding general

tanker design, operation, and seaworthiness have been man-dated by Title II of the PWSA.

The Ray Court confirmed the important proposition thatthe subject and scope of Title I of the PWSA allows a State
to regulate its ports and waterways, so long as the regulation is based on "the peculiarities of local waters that call forspecial precautionary measures." 435 U. S., at 171. Title I

allows state rules directed to local circumstances and prob-lems, such as water depth and narrowness, idiosyncratic to
a particular port or waterway. Ibid. There is no preemption by operation of Title I itself if the state regulation
is so directed and if the Coast Guard has not adopted regulations on the subject or determined that regulation is unnecessary or inappropriate. This principle is consistent with
recognition of an important role for States and localities in
the regulation of the Nation's waterways and ports. E. g.,
Cooley, 12 How., at 319 (recognizing state authority to adopt
plans "applicable to the local peculiarities of the ports within
their limits"). It is fundamental in our federal structure
that States have vast residual powers. Those powers, unless constrained or displaced by the existence of federal authority or by proper federal enactments, are often exercised
in concurrence with those of the National Government. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316 (1819).

As Ray itself made apparent, the States may enforce rules
governed by Title I of the PWSA unless they run counter to
an exercise of federal authority. The analysis under Title I
of the PWSA, then, is one of conflict pre-emption, which
occurs "when compliance with both state and federal law
is impossible, or when the state law `stands as an obstacle
to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes
and objective of Congress.' " California v. ARC America
Corp., 490 U. S. 93, 100-101 (1989) (citations omitted). In
this context, Coast Guard regulations are to be given pre529US1 Unit: $U35 [09-26-01 09:32:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN

FCC, 486 U. S. 57, 63-64 (1988) (" `[A] federal agency acting
within the scope of its congressionally delegated authoritymay pre-empt state regulation' and hence render unenforceable state or local laws that are otherwise not inconsistentwith federal law").

Ray defined the relevant inquiry for
Title I pre-emption as whether the Coast Guard has promulgated its own requirement on the subject or has decided thatno such requirement should be imposed at all. 435 U. S., at

171-172; see also id., at 178 (" `[W]here failure of . . . federalofficials affirmatively to exercise their full authority takes on
the character of a ruling that no such regulation is appropriate or approved pursuant to the policy of the statute,'
States are not permitted to use their police power to enact
such a regulation. Bethlehem Steel Co. v. New York State
Labor Relations Board, 330 U. S. 767, 774 (1947)"). Ray
also recognized that, even in the context of a regulation related to local waters, a federal official with an overview of
all possible ramifications of a particular requirement might
be in the best position to balance all the competing interests.
Id., at 177.

While Ray explained that Congress, in Title I of the
PWSA, preserved state authority to regulate the peculiarities of local waters if there was no conflict with federal regulatory determinations, the Court further held that Congress,
in Title II of the PWSA, mandated federal rules on the subjects or matters there specified, demanding uniformity. Id.,
at 168 ("Title II leaves no room for the States to impose
different or stricter design requirements than those which
Congress has enacted with the hope of having them internationally adopted or has accepted as the result of international
accord. A state law in this area . . . would frustrate the
congressional desire of achieving uniform, international
standards"). Title II requires the Coast Guard to impose
national regulations governing the general seaworthiness of
tankers and their crews. Id., at 160. Under Ray's inter529US1 Unit: $U35 [09-26-01 09:32:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN

111Cite as: 529 U. S. 89 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
pretation of the Title II PWSA provision now found at 46U. S. C. $ 3703(a), only the Federal Government may regulate

the "design, construction, alteration, repair, maintenance, op-eration, equipping, personnel qualification, and manning" of
tanker vessels.In

Ray, this principle was applied to hold that Washington's tanker design and construction rules were pre-empted.
Those requirements failed because they were within a fieldreserved for federal regulation under 46 U. S. C. $ 391a (1982

ed.), the predecessor to $ 3703(a). We reaffirm Ray's holdingon this point. Contrary to the suggestion of the Court of
Appeals, the field of pre-emption established by $ 3703(a)
cannot be limited to tanker "design" and "construction,"
terms which cannot be read in isolation from the other subjects found in that section. Title II of the PWSA covers
"design, construction, alteration, repair, maintenance, operation, equipping, personnel qualification, and manning" of
tanker vessels. Ibid. Congress has left no room for state
regulation of these matters. See Fidelity Fed. Sav. & Loan
Assn. v. De la Cuesta, 458 U. S. 141 (1982) (explaining field
pre-emption). As the Ray Court stated: "[T]he Supremacy
Clause dictates that the federal judgment that a vessel is
safe to navigate United States waters prevail over the contrary state judgment. Enforcement of the state requirements would at least frustrate what seems to us to be the
evident congressional intention to establish a uniform federal
regime controlling the design of oil tankers." 435 U. S., at
165.

The existence of some overlapping coverage between the
two titles of the PWSA may make it difficult to determine
whether a pre-emption question is controlled by conflict preemption principles, applicable generally to Title I, or by field
pre-emption rules, applicable generally to Title II. The Ray
Court acknowledged the difficulty, but declined to resolve
every question by the greater pre-emptive force of Title II.
We follow the same approach, and conflict pre-emption under

529US1 Unit: $U35 [09-26-01 09:32:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN
112 UNITED STATES v. LOCKE

Opinion of the Court
Title I will be applicable in some, although not all, cases.We recognize that the terms used in $ 3703(a) are quite

broad. In defining their scope, and the scope of the result-ing field pre-emption, it will be useful to consider the type
of regulations the Secretary has actually promulgated underthe section, as well as the section's list of specific types of
regulation that must be included. Useful inquiries includewhether the rule is justified by conditions unique to a particular port or waterway. See id., at 175 (a Title I regulationis one "based on water depth in Puget Sound or on other
local peculiarities"). Furthermore, a regulation within theState's residual powers will often be of limited extraterritorial effect, not requiring the tanker to modify its primaryconduct outside the specific body of water purported to justify the local rule. Limited extraterritorial effect explainswhy

Ray upheld a state rule requiring a tug escort for cer-tain vessels, id., at 171, and why state rules requiring a registered vessel (i. e., one involved in foreign trade) to take ona local pilot have historically been allowed,

id., at 159-160.Local rules not pre-empted under Title II of the PWSA pose

a minimal risk of innocent noncompliance, do not affect ves-sel operations outside the jurisdiction, do not require adjustment of systemic aspects of the vessel, and do not impose asubstantial burden on the vessel's operation within the local
jurisdiction itself. IV

The field pre-emption rule surrounding Title II and$ 3703(a) and the superseding effect of additional federal
statutes are illustrated by the pre-emption of four of Wash-ington's tanker regulations. We address these because the
attempted reach of the state rules is well demonstrated bythe briefs and record before us; other parts of the state regulatory scheme can be addressed on remand.First, Washington imposes a series of training requirements on a tanker's crew. WAC $ 317-21-230; see also Ap-pendix,

infra, at 118. A covered vessel is required to certify

529US1 Unit: $U35 [09-26-01 09:32:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN

113Cite as: 529 U. S. 89 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
that its crew has "complete[d] a comprehensive training pro-gram approved by the [State]." The State requires the vessel's master to "be trained in shipboard management" andlicensed deck officers to be trained in bridge resource management, automated radar plotting aids, shiphandling, crudeoil washing, inert gas systems, cargo handling, oil spill prevention and response, and shipboard fire fighting. The state
law mandates a series of "weekly," "monthly," and "quar-terly" drills.

This state requirement under WAC $ 317-21-230 does notaddress matters unique to the waters of Puget Sound. On
the contrary, it imposes requirements that control the
staffing, operation, and manning of a tanker outside of Washington's waters. The training and drill requirements pertain to "operation" and "personnel qualifications" and so are
pre-empted by 46 U. S. C. $ 3703(a). Our conclusion that
training is a field reserved to the Federal Government receives further confirmation from the circumstance that the
STCW Convention addresses "training" and "qualification"
requirements of the crew, Art. VI, and that the United
States has enacted crew training requirements. E. g., 46
CFR pts. 10, 12, 13, 15 (1999).

The second Washington rule we find pre-empted is WAC

$ 317-21-250; see also Appendix, infra, at 119. Washington
imposes English language proficiency requirements on a
tanker's crew. This requirement will dictate how a tanker
operator staffs the vessel even from the outset of the voyage,
when the vessel may be thousands of miles from Puget
Sound. It is not limited to governing local traffic or local
peculiarities. The State's attempted rule is a "personnel
qualification" pre-empted by $ 3703(a) of Title II. In
addition, there is another federal statute, 33 U. S. C.

$ 1228(a)(7), on the subject. It provides: "[N]o vessel . . .
shall operate in the navigable waters of the United
States . . . , if such vessel . . . while underway, does not have
at least one licensed deck officer on the navigation bridge

529US1 Unit: $U35 [09-26-01 09:32:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN
114 UNITED STATES v. LOCKE

Opinion of the Court
who is capable of clearly understanding English." The stat-ute may not be supplemented by laws enacted by the States

without compromising the uniformity the federal rule itselfachieves.

The third Washington rule we find invalid under field pre-emption is a navigation watch requirement in WAC $ 317-21-
200; see also Appendix, infra, at 118. Washington has different rules for navigation watch, depending on whetherthe tanker is operating in restricted visibility or not. We

mention the restricted visibility rule below, but now evaluatethe requirement which applies in general terms and reads:
"[T]he navigation watch shall consist of at least two licensed
deck officers, a helmsman, and a lookout." The general
watch requirement is not tied to the peculiarities of Puget
Sound; it applies throughout Washington's waters and at all
times. It is a general operating requirement and is preempted as an attempt to regulate a tanker's "operation" and
"manning" under 46 U. S. C. $ 3703(a).

We have illustrated field pre-emption under $ 3703(a) by
discussing three of Washington's rules which, under the current state of the record, we can determine cannot be enforced due to the assertion of federal authority found in that
section. The parties discuss other federal statutory provisions and international agreements which also govern
specific aspects of international maritime commerce. In appropriate circumstances, these also may have pre-emptive
effect.

For example, the record before us reveals that a fourth
state rule cannot stand in light of other sources of federal
regulation of the same subject. Washington requires vessels that ultimately reach its waters to report certain marine
casualties. WAC $ 317-21-130; see also Appendix, infra, at
117-118. The requirement applies to incidents (defined as
a "collision," "allision," "near-miss incident," "marine casualty" of listed kinds, "accidental or intentional grounding,"
"failure of the propulsion or primary steering systems,"

529US1 Unit: $U35 [09-26-01 09:32:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN

115Cite as: 529 U. S. 89 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
"failure of a component or control system," "fire, flood, orother incident that affects the vessel's seaworthiness," and

"spills of oil"), regardless of where in the world they mighthave occurred. A vessel operator is required by the state
regulation to make a detailed report to the State on eachincident, listing the date, location, and weather conditions.
The report must also list the government agencies to whom
the event was reported and must contain a "brief analysis ofany known causes" and a "description of measures taken to

prevent a reoccurrence." WAC $ 317-21-130.The State contends that its requirement is not pre-empted
because it is similar to federal requirements. This is an incorrect statement of the law. It is not always a sufficient
answer to a claim of pre-emption to say that state rules supplement, or even mirror, federal requirements. The Court
observed this principle when Commerce Clause doctrine was
beginning to take shape, holding in Sinnot v. Davenport, 22
How. 227 (1859), that Alabama could not require vessel owners to provide certain information as a condition of operating
in state waters even though federal law also required the
owner of the vessel "to furnish, under oath, . . . all the information required by this State law." Id., at 242. The appropriate inquiry still remains whether the purposes and objectives of the federal statutes, including the intent to establish
a workable, uniform system, are consistent with concurrent
state regulation. On this point, Justice Holmes' later observation is relevant: "When Congress has taken the particular
subject-matter in hand coincidence is as ineffective as opposition, and a state law is not to be declared a help because it
attempts to go farther than Congress has seen fit to go."
Charleston & Western Carolina R. Co. v. Varnville Furniture Co., 237 U. S. 597, 604 (1915).

We hold that Congress intended that the Coast Guard regulations be the sole source of a vessel's reporting obligations
with respect to the matters covered by the challenged state
statute. Under 46 U. S. C. $ 6101, the Coast Guard "shall

529US1 Unit: $U35 [09-26-01 09:32:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN
116 UNITED STATES v. LOCKE

Opinion of the Court
prescribe regulations on the marine casualties to be reportedand the manner of reporting," and the statute lists the kinds

of casualties that the regulations must cover. See also$ 3717(a)(4) (requiring the Secretary of Transportation to
"establish a marine safety information system"). Congressdid not intend its reporting obligations to be cumulative to
those enacted by each political subdivision whose jurisdictiona vessel enters. The State's reporting requirement is a significant burden in terms of cost and the risk of innocent non-compliance.

The Roanoke, 189 U. S. 185, 195 (1903) (themaster of a vessel is in a position "such that it is almost

impossible for him to acquaint himself with the laws of eachindividual State he may visit"). Furthermore, it affects a
vessel operator's out-of-state obligations and conduct, wherea State's jurisdiction and authority are most in doubt. The
state reporting requirement under WAC $ 317-21-130 ispre-empted.

V
As to conflict pre-emption under Title I, Washington ar-gues that certain of its regulations, such as its watch requirement in times of restricted visibility, are of limited extrater-ritorial effect and necessary to address the peculiarities of
Puget Sound. On remand, the Court of Appeals or DistrictCourt should consider whether the remaining regulations
are pre-empted under Title I conflict pre-emption or Title IIfield pre-emption, or are otherwise pre-empted by these
titles or under any other federal law or international agree-ment raised as possible sources of pre-emption.

We have determined that Washington's regulations re-garding general navigation watch procedures, English language skills, training, and casualty reporting are pre-empted. Petitioners make substantial arguments that the
remaining regulations are pre-empted as well. It is prefera-ble that the remaining claims be considered by the Court of
Appeals or by the District Court within the framework wehave discussed. The United States did not participate in

117Cite as: 529 U. S. 89 (2000)
Appendix to opinion of the Court
these cases until appeal. Resolution of these cases would
benefit from the development of a full record by all interested parties.

We infer from the record that Washington is not now enforcing its regulations. If, pending adjudication of these
cases on remand, a threat of enforcement emerges, the Court
of Appeals or the District Court would weigh any application
for stay under the appropriate legal standards in light of
the principles we have discussed and with recognition of the
national interests at stake.

When one contemplates the weight and immense mass of
oil ever in transit by tankers, the oil's proximity to coastal
life, and its destructive power even if a spill occurs far upon
the open sea, international, federal, and state regulation may
be insufficient protection. Sufficiency, however, is not the
question before us. The issue is not adequate regulation but
political responsibility; and it is, in large measure, for Congress and the Coast Guard to confront whether their regulatory scheme, which demands a high degree of uniformity, is
adequate. States, as well as environmental groups and local
port authorities, will participate in the process. See 46
U. S. C. $ 3703(a) (requiring the Coast Guard to consider the
views of "officials of State and local governments," "representative of port and harbor authorities," and "representatives of environmental groups" in arriving at national
standards).

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and
these cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent
with this opinion. It is so ordered.

FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION et al. v. BROWN

& WILLIAMSON TOBACCO CORP. et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fourth circuit

No. 98-1152. Argued December 1, 1999--Decided March 21, 2000
The Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA or Act), 21 U. S. C. $ 301 et seq.,

grants the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as the designee of the
Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), the authority to regulate, among other items, "drugs" and "devices," $$ 321(g)-(h), 393. In
1996, the FDA asserted jurisdiction to regulate tobacco products, concluding that, under the FDCA, nicotine is a "drug" and cigarettes and
smokeless tobacco are "devices" that deliver nicotine to the body. Pursuant to this authority, the FDA promulgated regulations governing
tobacco products' promotion, labeling, and accessibility to children and
adolescents. The FDA found that tobacco use is the Nation's leading
cause of premature death, resulting in more than 400,000 deaths annually, and that most adult smokers begin when they are minors. The
regulations therefore aim to reduce tobacco use by minors so as to substantially reduce the prevalence of addiction in future generations, and
thus the incidence of tobacco-related death and disease. Respondents,
a group of tobacco manufacturers, retailers, and advertisers, filed this
suit challenging the FDA's regulations. They moved for summary
judgment on the ground, inter alia, that the FDA lacked jurisdiction
to regulate tobacco products as customarily marketed, that is, without
manufacturer claims of therapeutic benefit. The District Court upheld
the FDA's authority, but the Fourth Circuit reversed, holding that Congress has not granted the FDA jurisdiction to regulate tobacco products. The court concluded that construing the FDCA to include tobacco products would lead to several internal inconsistencies in the Act.
It also found that evidence external to the FDCA--that the FDA consistently stated before 1995 that it lacked jurisdiction over tobacco, that
Congress has enacted several tobacco-specific statutes fully cognizant of
the FDA's position, and that Congress has considered and rejected many
bills that would have given the agency such authority--confirms this
conclusion.

Held: Reading the FDCA as a whole, as well as in conjunction with Congress' subsequent tobacco-specific legislation, it is plain that Congress
has not given the FDA the authority to regulate tobacco products as
customarily marketed. Pp. 131-161.

Syllabus
(a) Because this case involves an agency's construction of a statute it
administers, the Court's analysis is governed by Chevron U. S. A. Inc.
v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, under which
a reviewing court must first ask whether Congress has directly spoken
to the precise question at issue, id., at 842. If so, the court must give
effect to Congress' unambiguously expressed intent. E. g., id., at 843.
If not, the court must defer to the agency's construction of the statute
so long as it is permissible. See, e. g., INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U. S.
415, 424. In determining whether Congress has specifically addressed
the question at issue, the court should not confine itself to examining a
particular statutory provision in isolation. Rather, it must place the
provision in context, interpreting the statute to create a symmetrical
and coherent regulatory scheme. Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U. S.
561, 569. In addition, the meaning of one statute may be affected by
other Acts, particularly where Congress has spoken subsequently and
more specifically to the topic at hand. See, e. g., United States v. Estate
of Romani, 523 U. S. 517, 530-531. Finally, the court must be guided
to a degree by common sense as to the manner in which Congress
is likely to delegate a policy decision of such economic and political
magnitude to an administrative agency. Cf. MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. American Telephone & Telegraph Co., 512 U. S. 218, 231.
Pp. 131-133.

(b) Considering the FDCA as a whole, it is clear that Congress intended to exclude tobacco products from the FDA's jurisdiction. A fundamental precept of the FDCA is that any product regulated by the
FDA that remains on the market must be safe and effective for its intended use. See, e. g., $ 393(b)(2). That is, the potential for inflicting
death or physical injury must be offset by the possibility of therapeutic
benefit. United States v. Rutherford, 442 U. S. 544, 556. In its rulemaking proceeding, the FDA quite exhaustively documented that tobacco products are unsafe, dangerous, and cause great pain and suffering from illness. These findings logically imply that, if tobacco products
were "devices" under the FDCA, the FDA would be required to remove
them from the market under the FDCA's misbranding, see, e. g., $ 331(a),
and device classification, see, e. g., $ 360e(d)(2)(A), provisions. In fact,
based on such provisions, the FDA itself has previously asserted that if
tobacco products were within its jurisdiction, they would have to be
removed from the market because it would be impossible to prove they
were safe for their intended use. Congress, however, has foreclosed a
ban of such products, choosing instead to create a distinct regulatory
scheme focusing on the labeling and advertising of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. Its express policy is to protect commerce and the national
economy while informing consumers about any adverse health effects.

122 FDA v. BROWN & WILLIAMSON TOBACCO CORP.

Syllabus
See 15 U. S. C. $ 1331. Thus, an FDA ban would plainly contradict congressional intent. Apparently recognizing this dilemma, the FDA has
concluded that tobacco products are actually "safe" under the FDCA
because banning them would cause a greater harm to public health than
leaving them on the market. But this safety determination--focusing
on the relative harms caused by alternative remedial measures--is not
a substitute for those required by the FDCA. Various provisions in
the Act require the agency to determine that, at least for some consumers, the product's therapeutic benefits outweigh the risks of illness or
serious injury. This the FDA cannot do, because tobacco products are
unsafe for obtaining any therapeutic benefit. The inescapable conclusion is that there is no room for tobacco products within the FDCA's
regulatory scheme. If they cannot be used safely for any therapeutic purpose, and yet they cannot be banned, they simply do not fit.
Pp. 133-143.

(c) The history of tobacco-specific legislation also demonstrates that
Congress has spoken directly to the FDA's authority to regulate tobacco
products. Since 1965, Congress has enacted six separate statutes addressing the problem of tobacco use and human health. Those statutes,
among other things, require that health warnings appear on all packaging and in all print and outdoor advertisements, see 15 U. S. C. $$ 1331,
1333, 4402; prohibit the advertisement of tobacco products through any
electronic communication medium regulated by the Federal Communications Commission, see $$ 1335, 4402(f); require the Secretary of HHS
to report every three years to Congress on research findings concerning tobacco's addictive property, 42 U. S. C. $ 290aa-2(b)(2); and make
States' receipt of certain federal block grants contingent on their prohibiting any tobacco product manufacturer, retailer, or distributor from
selling or distributing any such product to individuals under age 18,

$ 300x-26(a)(1). This tobacco-specific legislation has created a specific
regulatory scheme for addressing the problem of tobacco and health.
And it was adopted against the backdrop of the FDA consistently and
resolutely stating that it was without authority under the FDCA to
regulate tobacco products as customarily marketed. In fact, Congress
several times considered and rejected bills that would have given the
FDA such authority. Indeed, Congress' actions in this area have evidenced a clear intent to preclude a meaningful policymaking role for any
administrative agency. Further, Congress' tobacco legislation prohibits
any additional regulation of tobacco product labeling with respect to
tobacco's health consequences, a central aspect of regulation under the
FDCA. Under these circumstances, it is evident that Congress has ratified the FDA's previous, long-held position that it lacks jurisdiction to
regulate tobacco products as customarily marketed. Congress has

Syllabus
created a distinct scheme for addressing the subject, and that scheme
excludes any role for FDA regulation. Pp. 143-159.

(d) Finally, the Court's inquiry is shaped, at least in some measure,
by the nature of the question presented. Chevron deference is premised on the theory that a statute's ambiguity constitutes an implicit delegation from Congress to the agency to fill in the statutory gaps. See
467 U. S., at 844. In extraordinary cases, however, there may be reason
to hesitate before concluding that Congress has intended such an implicit delegation. This is hardly an ordinary case. Contrary to the
agency's position from its inception until 1995, the FDA has now asserted jurisdiction to regulate an industry constituting a significant portion of the American economy. In fact, the FDA contends that, were it
to determine that tobacco products provide no "reasonable assurance of
safety," it would have the authority to ban cigarettes and smokeless
tobacco entirely. It is highly unlikely that Congress would leave the
determination as to whether the sale of tobacco products would be regulated, or even banned, to the FDA's discretion in so cryptic a fashion.
See MCI Telecommunications, supra, at 231. Given tobacco's unique
political history, as well as the breadth of the authority that the FDA
has asserted, the Court is obliged to defer not to the agency's expansive
construction of the statute, but to Congress' consistent judgment to
deny the FDA this power. Pp. 159-161.

(e) No matter how important, conspicuous, and controversial the
issue, and regardless of how likely the public is to hold the Executive
Branch politically accountable, an administrative agency's power to regulate in the public interest must always be grounded in a valid grant of
authority from Congress. Courts must take care not to extend a statute's scope beyond the point where Congress indicated it would stop.

Opinion of the Court
Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case involves one of the most troubling public healthproblems facing our Nation today: the thousands of premature deaths that occur each year because of tobacco use. In1996, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), after having
expressly disavowed any such authority since its inception,asserted jurisdiction to regulate tobacco products. See 61
Fed. Reg. 44619-45318. The FDA concluded that nicotine isa "drug" within the meaning of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA or Act), 52 Stat. 1040, as amended, 21U. S. C. $ 301 et seq., and that cigarettes and smokeless tobacco are "combination products" that deliver nicotine to thebody. 61 Fed. Reg. 44397 (1996). Pursuant to this authority, it promulgated regulations intended to reduce tobaccoconsumption among children and adolescents. Id., at 44615-
44618. The agency believed that, because most tobaccoconsumers begin their use before reaching the age of 18,
curbing tobacco use by minors could substantially reducethe prevalence of addiction in future generations and thus
the incidence of tobacco-related death and disease. Id., at44398-44399.

Regardless of how serious the problem an administrativeagency seeks to address, however, it may not exercise its
authority "in a manner that is inconsistent with the adminis-trative structure that Congress enacted into law."

biguously expressed intent of Congress." Chevron U. S. A.Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S.

837, 842-843 (1984). In this case, we believe that Congresshas clearly precluded the FDA from asserting jurisdiction
to regulate tobacco products. Such authority is inconsistentwith the intent that Congress has expressed in the FDCA's
overall regulatory scheme and in the tobacco-specific legisla-tion that it has enacted subsequent to the FDCA. In light
of this clear intent, the FDA's assertion of jurisdiction isimpermissible.

I
The FDCA grants the FDA, as the designee of the Secre-tary of Health and Human Services (HHS), the authority to

regulate, among other items, "drugs" and "devices." See 21U. S. C. $$ 321(g)-(h), 393 (1994 ed. and Supp. III). The Act
defines "drug" to include "articles (other than food) intendedto affect the structure or any function of the body." 21
U. S. C. $ 321(g)(1)(C). It defines "device," in part, as "aninstrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, . . .
or other similar or related article, including any component,part, or accessory, which is . . . intended to affect the structure or any function of the body." $ 321(h). The Act alsogrants the FDA the authority to regulate so-called "combination products," which "constitute a combination of a drug,device, or biological product." $ 353(g)(1). The FDA has
construed this provision as giving it the discretion to regu-late combination products as drugs, as devices, or as both.
See 61 Fed. Reg. 44400 (1996).On August 11, 1995, the FDA published a proposed rule
concerning the sale of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco tochildren and adolescents. 60 Fed. Reg. 41314-41787. The
rule, which included several restrictions on the sale, distribu-tion, and advertisement of tobacco products, was designed to
reduce the availability and attractiveness of tobacco productsto young people.

Id., at 41314. A public comment periodfollowed, during which the FDA received over 700,000 sub529US1 Unit: $U36 [09-26-01 08:36:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
missions, more than "at any other time in its history on anyother subject." 61 Fed. Reg. 44418 (1996).

On August 28, 1996, the FDA issued a final rule entitled"Regulations Restricting the Sale and Distribution of Cigarettes and Smokeless Tobacco to Protect Children and Ado-lescents."

Id., at 44396. The FDA determined that nicotine is a "drug" and that cigarettes and smokeless tobacco
are "drug delivery devices," and therefore it had jurisdictionunder the FDCA to regulate tobacco products as customarily

marketed--that is, without manufacturer claims of therapeu-tic benefit.

Id., at 44397, 44402. First, the FDA found that
tobacco products " `affect the structure or any function of
the body' " because nicotine "has significant pharmacological
effects." Id., at 44631. Specifically, nicotine "exerts psychoactive, or mood-altering, effects on the brain" that cause
and sustain addiction, have both tranquilizing and stimulating effects, and control weight. Id., at 44631-44632. Second, the FDA determined that these effects were "intended"
under the FDCA because they "are so widely known and
foreseeable that [they] may be deemed to have been intended
by the manufacturers," id., at 44687; consumers use tobacco
products "predominantly or nearly exclusively" to obtain
these effects, id., at 44807; and the statements, research, and
actions of manufacturers revealed that they "have `designed'
cigarettes to provide pharmacologically active doses of nicotine to consumers," id., at 44849. Finally, the agency concluded that cigarettes and smokeless tobacco are "combination products" because, in addition to containing nicotine,
they include device components that deliver a controlled
amount of nicotine to the body, id., at 45208-45216.

Having resolved the jurisdictional question, the FDA next
explained the policy justifications for its regulations, detailing the deleterious health effects associated with tobacco
use. It found that tobacco consumption was "the single
leading cause of preventable death in the United States."
Id., at 44398. According to the FDA, "[m]ore than 400,000

529US1 Unit: $U36 [09-26-01 08:36:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN
128 FDA v. BROWN & WILLIAMSON TOBACCO CORP.

Opinion of the Court
people die each year from tobacco-related illnesses, suchas cancer, respiratory illnesses, and heart disease."

Ibid.
The agency also determined that the only way to reduce theamount of tobacco-related illness and mortality was to reduce the level of addiction, a goal that could be accomplishedonly by preventing children and adolescents from starting to
use tobacco. Id., at 44398-44399. The FDA found that 82%
of adult smokers had their first cigarette before the age of18, and more than half had already become regular smokers

by that age. Id., at 44398. It also found that children werebeginning to smoke at a younger age, that the prevalence
of youth smoking had recently increased, and that similar
problems existed with respect to smokeless tobacco. Id., at
44398-44399. The FDA accordingly concluded that if "the
number of children and adolescents who begin tobacco use
can be substantially diminished, tobacco-related illness can
be correspondingly reduced because data suggest that anyone who does not begin smoking in childhood or adolescence
is unlikely ever to begin." Id., at 44399.

Based on these findings, the FDA promulgated regulations
concerning tobacco products' promotion, labeling, and accessibility to children and adolescents. See id., at 44615-44618.
The access regulations prohibit the sale of cigarettes or
smokeless tobacco to persons younger than 18; require retailers to verify through photo identification the age of all purchasers younger than 27; prohibit the sale of cigarettes in
quantities smaller than 20; prohibit the distribution of free
samples; and prohibit sales through self-service displays and
vending machines except in adult-only locations. Id., at
44616-44617. The promotion regulations require that any
print advertising appear in a black-and-white, text-only format unless the publication in which it appears is read almost
exclusively by adults; prohibit outdoor advertising within
1,000 feet of any public playground or school; prohibit the
distribution of any promotional items, such as T-shirts or
hats, bearing the manufacturer's brand name; and prohibit a

manufacturer from sponsoring any athletic, musical, artistic,or other social or cultural event using its brand name.

Id.,
at 44617-44618. The labeling regulation requires that thestatement, "A Nicotine-Delivery Device for Persons 18 or

Older," appear on all tobacco product packages. Id., at44617.

The FDA promulgated these regulations pursuant to its
authority to regulate "restricted devices." See 21 U. S. C.$ 360j(e). The FDA construed $ 353(g)(1) as giving it the

discretion to regulate "combination products" using the Act'sdrug authorities, device authorities, or both, depending on
"how the public health goals of the act can be best accomplished." 61 Fed. Reg. 44403 (1996). Given the greater
flexibility in the FDCA for the regulation of devices, the
FDA determined that "the device authorities provide the
most appropriate basis for regulating cigarettes and smokeless tobacco." Id., at 44404. Under 21 U. S. C. $ 360j(e), the
agency may "require that a device be restricted to sale, distribution, or use . . . upon such other conditions as [the FDA]
may prescribe in such regulation, if, because of its potentiality for harmful effect or the collateral measures necessary to
its use, [the FDA] determines that there cannot otherwise
be reasonable assurance of its safety and effectiveness."
The FDA reasoned that its regulations fell within the authority granted by $ 360j(e) because they related to the sale
or distribution of tobacco products and were necessary for
providing a reasonable assurance of safety. 61 Fed. Reg.
44405-44407 (1996).

Respondents, a group of tobacco manufacturers, retailers,
and advertisers, filed suit in United States District Court for
the Middle District of North Carolina challenging the regulations. See Coyne Beahm, Inc. v. FDA, 966 F. Supp. 1374
(1997). They moved for summary judgment on the grounds
that the FDA lacked jurisdiction to regulate tobacco products as customarily marketed, the regulations exceeded the
FDA's authority under 21 U. S. C. $ 360j(e), and the advertis529US1 Unit: $U36 [09-26-01 08:36:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN

granted respondents' motion in part and denied it in part.
966 F. Supp., at 1400. The court held that the FDCA au-thorizes the FDA to regulate tobacco products as customarily marketed and that the FDA's access and labeling regu-lations are permissible, but it also found that the agency's
advertising and promotion restrictions exceed its authority under $ 360j(e). Id., at 1380-1400. The court stayed implementation of the regulations it found valid (except the
prohibition on the sale of tobacco products to minors) and
certified its order for immediate interlocutory appeal. Id.,
at 1400-1401.

The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed,
holding that Congress has not granted the FDA jurisdiction
to regulate tobacco products. See 153 F. 3d 155 (1998). Examining the FDCA as a whole, the court concluded that the
FDA's regulation of tobacco products would create a number
of internal inconsistencies. Id., at 162-167. Various provisions of the Act require the agency to determine that any
regulated product is "safe" before it can be sold or allowed to
remain on the market, yet the FDA found in its rulemaking
proceeding that tobacco products are "dangerous" and "unsafe." Id., at 164-167. Thus, the FDA would apparently
have to ban tobacco products, a result the court found clearly
contrary to congressional intent. Ibid. This apparent

anomaly, the Court of Appeals concluded, demonstrates that
Congress did not intend to give the FDA authority to regulate tobacco. Id., at 167. The court also found that evidence external to the FDCA confirms this conclusion. Importantly, the FDA consistently stated before 1995 that it
lacked jurisdiction over tobacco, and Congress has enacted

Opinion of the Court
several tobacco-specific statutes fully cognizant of the FDA'sposition. See id., at 168-176. In fact, the court reasoned,

Congress has considered and rejected many bills that wouldhave given the agency such authority. See id., at 170-171.
This, along with the absence of any intent by the enactingCongress in 1938 to subject tobacco products to regulation
under the FDCA, demonstrates that Congress intended towithhold such authority from the FDA.

Id., at 167-176.Having resolved the jurisdictional question against the

agency, the Court of Appeals did not address whether theregulations exceed the FDA's authority under 21 U. S. C.

$ 360j(e) or violate the First Amendment. See 153 F. 3d, at176, n. 29.

We granted the federal parties' petition for certiorari, 526U. S. 1086 (1999), to determine whether the FDA has authority under the FDCA to regulate tobacco products as custom-arily marketed.

II
The FDA's assertion of jurisdiction to regulate tobaccoproducts is founded on its conclusions that nicotine is a

"drug" and that cigarettes and smokeless tobacco are "drugdelivery devices." Again, the FDA found that tobacco products are "intended" to deliver the pharmacological effectsof satisfying addiction, stimulation and tranquilization, and
weight control because those effects are foreseeable to anyreasonable manufacturer, consumers use tobacco products
to obtain those effects, and tobacco manufacturers have de-signed their products to produce those effects. 61 Fed. Reg.
44632-44633 (1996). As an initial matter, respondents takeissue with the FDA's reading of "intended," arguing that it
is a term of art that refers exclusively to claims made by themanufacturer or vendor about the product. See Brief for
Respondent Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. 6. That is,a product is not a drug or device under the FDCA unless the
manufacturer or vendor makes some express claim concern-ing the product's therapeutic benefits. See

id., at 6-7. We

Opinion of the Court
need not resolve this question, however, because assuming,
arguendo, that a product can be "intended to affect the structure or any function of the body" absent claims of therapeuticor medical benefit, the FDA's claim to jurisdiction contravenes the clear intent of Congress.A threshold issue is the appropriate framework for analyzing the FDA's assertion of authority to regulate tobacco
products. Because this case involves an administrativeagency's construction of a statute that it administers, our

analysis is governed by Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984). Under
Chevron, a reviewing court must first ask "whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue."
Id., at 842. If Congress has done so, the inquiry is at an
end; the court "must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress." Id., at 843; see also United
States v. Haggar Apparel Co., 526 U. S. 380, 392 (1999); Holly
Farms Corp. v. NLRB, 517 U. S. 392, 398 (1996). But if Congress has not specifically addressed the question, a reviewing
court must respect the agency's construction of the statute
so long as it is permissible. See INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre,
526 U. S. 415, 424 (1999); Auer v. Robbins, 519 U. S. 452, 457
(1997). Such deference is justified because "[t]he responsibilities for assessing the wisdom of such policy choices and
resolving the struggle between competing views of the public interest are not judicial ones," Chevron, supra, at 866, and
because of the agency's greater familiarity with the everchanging facts and circumstances surrounding the subjects
regulated, see Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U. S. 173, 187 (1991).

In determining whether Congress has specifically addressed the question at issue, a reviewing court should not
confine itself to examining a particular statutory provision
in isolation. The meaning--or ambiguity--of certain words
or phrases may only become evident when placed in context.
See Brown v. Gardner, 513 U. S. 115, 118 (1994) ("Ambiguity
is a creature not of definitional possibilities but of statutory

Opinion of the Court
context"). It is a "fundamental canon of statutory construc-tion that the words of a statute must be read in their context

and with a view to their place in the overall statutoryscheme." Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U. S.
803, 809 (1989). A court must therefore interpret the stat-ute "as a symmetrical and coherent regulatory scheme,"
Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U. S. 561, 569 (1995), and "fit, ifpossible, all parts into an harmonious whole,"

FTC v. MandelBrothers, Inc., 359 U. S. 385, 389 (1959). Similarly, the

meaning of one statute may be affected by other Acts, partic-ularly where Congress has spoken subsequently and more
specifically to the topic at hand. See United States v. Estateof Romani, 523 U. S. 517, 530-531 (1998); United States v.
Fausto, 484 U. S. 439, 453 (1988). In addition, we must beguided to a degree by common sense as to the manner in
which Congress is likely to delegate a policy decision of sucheconomic and political magnitude to an administrative
agency. Cf. MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. American
Telephone & Telegraph Co., 512 U. S. 218, 231 (1994).With these principles in mind, we find that Congress has

directly spoken to the issue here and precluded the FDA'sjurisdiction to regulate tobacco products.

A
Viewing the FDCA as a whole, it is evident that one of theAct's core objectives is to ensure that any product regulated

by the FDA is "safe" and "effective" for its intended use.See 21 U. S. C. $ 393(b)(2) (1994 ed., Supp. III) (defining the
FDA's mission); More Information for Better Patient Care:Hearing before the Senate Committee on Labor and Human
Resources, 104th Cong., 2d Sess., 83 (1996) (statement ofFDA Deputy Comm'r Schultz) ("A fundamental precept of
drug and device regulation in this country is that these prod-ucts must be proven safe and effective before they can be
sold"). This essential purpose pervades the FDCA. Forinstance, 21 U. S. C. $ 393(b)(2) (1994 ed., Supp. III) defines

Opinion of the Court
the FDA's "[m]ission" to include "protect[ing] the publichealth by ensuring that . . . drugs are safe and effective"

and that "there is reasonable assurance of the safety andeffectiveness of devices intended for human use." The
FDCA requires premarket approval of any new drug, withsome limited exceptions, and states that the FDA "shall
issue an order refusing to approve the application" of a new
drug if it is not safe and effective for its intended purpose.$$ 355(d)(1)-(2), (4)-(5). If the FDA discovers after approval

that a drug is unsafe or ineffective, it "shall, after due noticeand opportunity for hearing to the applicant, withdraw approval" of the drug. 21 U. S. C. $$ 355(e)(1)-(3). The Act
also requires the FDA to classify all devices into one of three
categories. $ 360c(b)(1). Regardless of which category the
FDA chooses, there must be a "reasonable assurance of
the safety and effectiveness of the device." 21 U. S. C.

$$ 360c(a)(1)(A)(i), (B), (C) (1994 ed. and Supp. III); 61 Fed.
Reg. 44412 (1996). Even the "restricted device" provision
pursuant to which the FDA promulgated the regulations at
issue here authorizes the agency to place conditions on the
sale or distribution of a device specifically when "there cannot otherwise be reasonable assurance of its safety and effectiveness." 21 U. S. C. $ 360j(e). Thus, the Act generally requires the FDA to prevent the marketing of any drug or
device where the "potential for inflicting death or physical
injury is not offset by the possibility of therapeutic benefit."
United States v. Rutherford, 442 U. S. 544, 556 (1979).

In its rulemaking proceeding, the FDA quite exhaustively
documented that "tobacco products are unsafe," "dangerous," and "cause great pain and suffering from illness." 61
Fed. Reg. 44412 (1996). It found that the consumption of
tobacco products presents "extraordinary health risks," and
that "tobacco use is the single leading cause of preventable
death in the United States." Id., at 44398. It stated that
"[m]ore than 400,000 people die each year from tobaccorelated illnesses, such as cancer, respiratory illnesses, and

529US1 Unit: $U36 [09-26-01 08:36:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
heart disease, often suffering long and painful deaths," andthat "[t]obacco alone kills more people each year in the

United States than acquired immunodeficiency syndrome(AIDS), car accidents, alcohol, homicides, illegal drugs, suicides, and fires, combined." Ibid. Indeed, the FDA charac-terized smoking as "a pediatric disease,"

id., at 44421, because "one out of every three young people who become
regular smokers . . . will die prematurely as a result," id.,at 44399.

These findings logically imply that, if tobacco productswere "devices" under the FDCA, the FDA would be required
to remove them from the market. Consider, first, the
FDCA's provisions concerning the misbranding of drugs or
devices. The Act prohibits "[t]he introduction or delivery
for introduction into interstate commerce of any food, drug,
device, or cosmetic that is adulterated or misbranded." 21
U. S. C. $ 331(a). In light of the FDA's findings, two distinct
FDCA provisions would render cigarettes and smokeless tobacco misbranded devices. First, $ 352( j) deems a drug or
device misbranded "[i]f it is dangerous to health when used
in the dosage or manner, or with the frequency or duration
prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling
thereof." The FDA's findings make clear that tobacco products are "dangerous to health" when used in the manner prescribed. Second, a drug or device is misbranded under the
Act "[u]nless its labeling bears . . . adequate directions for
use . . . in such manner and form, as are necessary for
the protection of users," except where such directions are
"not necessary for the protection of the public health."

$ 352(f)(1). Given the FDA's conclusions concerning the
health consequences of tobacco use, there are no directions
that could adequately protect consumers. That is, there are
no directions that could make tobacco products safe for obtaining their intended effects. Thus, were tobacco products
within the FDA's jurisdiction, the Act would deem them misbranded devices that could not be introduced into interstate

136 FDA v. BROWN & WILLIAMSON TOBACCO CORP.

Opinion of the Court
commerce. Contrary to the dissent's contention, the Act admits no remedial discretion once it is evident that the device
is misbranded.

Second, the FDCA requires the FDA to place all devices
that it regulates into one of three classifications. See

$ 360c(b)(1). The agency relies on a device's classification in
determining the degree of control and regulation necessary
to ensure that there is "a reasonable assurance of safety and
effectiveness." 61 Fed. Reg. 44412 (1996). The FDA has
yet to classify tobacco products. Instead, the regulations at
issue here represent so-called "general controls," which the
Act entitles the agency to impose in advance of classification.
See id., at 44404-44405. Although the FDCA prescribes no
deadline for device classification, the FDA has stated that it
will classify tobacco products "in a future rulemaking" as
required by the Act. Id., at 44412. Given the FDA's findings regarding the health consequences of tobacco use, the
agency would have to place cigarettes and smokeless tobacco
in Class III because, even after the application of the Act's
available controls, they would "presen[t] a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury." 21 U. S. C. $ 360c(a)(1)(C).
As Class III devices, tobacco products would be subject to
the FDCA's premarket approval process. See 21 U. S. C.

$ 360c(a)(1)(C) (1994 ed., Supp. III); 21 U. S. C. $ 360e; 61
Fed. Reg. 44412 (1996). Under these provisions, the FDA
would be prohibited from approving an application for premarket approval without "a showing of reasonable assurance
that such device is safe under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling
thereof." 21 U. S. C. $ 360e(d)(2)(A). In view of the FDA's
conclusions regarding the health effects of tobacco use, the
agency would have no basis for finding any such reasonable
assurance of safety. Thus, once the FDA fulfilled its statutory obligation to classify tobacco products, it could not allow
them to be marketed.

Opinion of the Court
The FDCA's misbranding and device classification provi-sions therefore make evident that were the FDA to regulate

cigarettes and smokeless tobacco, the Act would require theagency to ban them. In fact, based on these provisions, the
FDA itself has previously taken the position that if tobaccoproducts were within its jurisdiction, "they would have to
be removed from the market because it would be impossible to prove they were safe for their intended us[e]." Pub-lic Health Cigarette Amendments of 1971: Hearings before

the Commerce Subcommittee on S. 1454, 92d Cong., 2d Sess.,239 (1972) (hereinafter 1972 Hearings) (statement of FDA
Comm'r Charles Edwards). See also Cigarette Labeling
and Advertising: Hearings before the House Committee on
Interstate and Foreign Commerce, 88th Cong., 2d Sess., 18
(1964) (hereinafter 1964 Hearings) (statement of Dept. of
Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) Secretary Anthony
Celebrezze that proposed amendments to the FDCA that
would have given the FDA jurisdiction over "smoking product[s]" "might well completely outlaw at least cigarettes").

Congress, however, has foreclosed the removal of tobacco
products from the market. A provision of the United States
Code currently in force states that "[t]he marketing of tobacco constitutes one of the greatest basic industries of the
United States with ramifying activities which directly affect
interstate and foreign commerce at every point, and stable
conditions therein are necessary to the general welfare." 7
U. S. C. $ 1311(a). More importantly, Congress has directly
addressed the problem of tobacco and health through legislation on six occasions since 1965. See Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act (FCLAA), Pub. L. 89-92, 79 Stat.

Health Administration Reorganization Act, Pub. L. 102-321,$ 202, 106 Stat. 394. When Congress enacted these statutes,

the adverse health consequences of tobacco use were wellknown, as were nicotine's pharmacological effects. See,

e. g.,
U. S. Dept. of Health, Education, and Welfare, U. S. SurgeonGeneral's Advisory Committee, Smoking and Health 25-40,

69-75 (1964) (hereinafter 1964 Surgeon General's Report)

People Smoke Cigarettes (1983), in Smoking Prevention Education Act, Hearings on H. R. 1824 before the Subcommittee

(hereinafter 1983 House Hearings) (stating that smoking is
"the most widespread example of drug dependence in our

brain and nervous system"); U. S. Dept. of Health and Human
Services, Public Health Service, The Health Consequences of

and cocaine, and that nicotine is the drug that causes addiction). Nonetheless, Congress stopped well short of ordering
a ban. Instead, it has generally regulated the labeling and
advertisement of tobacco products, expressly providing that
it is the policy of Congress that "commerce and the national

Opinion of the Court
economy may be . . . protected to the maximum extent con-sistent with" consumers "be[ing] adequately informed about

any adverse health effects." 15 U. S. C. $ 1331. Congress'decisions to regulate labeling and advertising and to adopt
the express policy of protecting "commerce and the nationaleconomy . . . to the maximum extent" reveal its intent that
tobacco products remain on the market. Indeed, the collective premise of these statutes is that cigarettes and smoke-less tobacco will continue to be sold in the United States. A

ban of tobacco products by the FDA would therefore plainlycontradict congressional policy.

The FDA apparently recognized this dilemma and concluded, somewhat ironically, that tobacco products are actually "safe" within the meaning of the FDCA. In promulgating its regulations, the agency conceded that "tobacco
products are unsafe, as that term is conventionally understood." 61 Fed. Reg. 44412 (1996). Nonetheless, the FDA
reasoned that, in determining whether a device is safe under
the Act, it must consider "not only the risks presented by a
product but also any of the countervailing effects of use of
that product, including the consequences of not permitting
the product to be marketed." Id., at 44412-44413. Applying this standard, the FDA found that, because of the high
level of addiction among tobacco users, a ban would likely be
"dangerous." Id., at 44413. In particular, current tobacco
users could suffer from extreme withdrawal, the health care
system and available pharmaceuticals might not be able to
meet the treatment demands of those suffering from withdrawal, and a black market offering cigarettes even more
dangerous than those currently sold legally would likely develop. Ibid. The FDA therefore concluded that, "while
taking cigarettes and smokeless tobacco off the market could
prevent some people from becoming addicted and reduce
death and disease for others, the record does not establish
that such a ban is the appropriate public health response
under the act." Id., at 44398.

529US1 Unit: $U36 [09-26-01 08:36:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN
140 FDA v. BROWN & WILLIAMSON TOBACCO CORP.

Opinion of the Court
It may well be, as the FDA asserts, that "these factors
must be considered when developing a regulatory scheme
that achieves the best public health result for these products." Id., at 44413. But the FDA's judgment that leaving
tobacco products on the market "is more effective in achieving public health goals than a ban," ibid., is no substitute for
the specific safety determinations required by the FDCA's
various operative provisions. Several provisions in the Act
require the FDA to determine that the product itself is safe
as used by consumers. That is, the product's probable therapeutic benefits must outweigh its risk of harm. See United
States v. Rutherford, 442 U. S., at 555 ("[T]he Commissioner
generally considers a drug safe when the expected therapeutic gain justifies the risk entailed by its use"). In contrast,
the FDA's conception of safety would allow the agency, with
respect to each provision of the FDCA that requires the
agency to determine a product's "safety" or "dangerousness,"
to compare the aggregate health effects of alternative administrative actions. This is a qualitatively different inquiry.
Thus, although the FDA has concluded that a ban would be
"dangerous," it has not concluded that tobacco products are
"safe" as that term is used throughout the Act.

Consider 21 U. S. C. $ 360c(a)(2), which specifies those factors that the FDA may consider in determining the safety
and effectiveness of a device for purposes of classification,
performance standards, and premarket approval. For all
devices regulated by the FDA, there must at least be a "reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device." See 21 U. S. C. $$ 360c(a)(1)(A)(i), (B), (C) (1994 ed.
and Supp. III); 61 Fed. Reg. 44412 (1996). Title 21 U. S. C.

$ 360c(a)(2) provides that

"the safety and effectiveness of a device are to be
determined--

"(A) with respect to the persons for whose use the
device is represented or intended,

529US1 Unit: $U36 [09-26-01 08:36:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN

141Cite as: 529 U. S. 120 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
"(B) with respect to the conditions of use prescribed,recommended, or suggested in the labeling of the device, and"(C) weighing any probable benefit to health from the
use of the device against any probable risk of injury orillness from such use."

A straightforward reading of this provision dictates that theFDA must weigh the probable therapeutic benefits of the
device to the consumer against the probable risk of injury.Applied to tobacco products, the inquiry is whether their
purported benefits--satisfying addiction, stimulation andsedation, and weight control--outweigh the risks to health
from their use. To accommodate the FDA's conception ofsafety, however, one must read "any probable benefit to
health" to include the benefit to public health stemming fromadult consumers' continued use of tobacco products, even
though the reduction of tobacco use is the raison d'e^tre ofthe regulations. In other words, the FDA is forced to contend that the very evil it seeks to combat is a "benefit tohealth." This is implausible.

The FDA's conception of safety is also incompatible withthe FDCA's misbranding provision. Again, $ 352( j) provides that a product is "misbranded" if "it is dangerous tohealth when used in the dosage or manner, or with the frequency or duration prescribed, recommended, or suggestedin the labeling thereof." According to the FDA's understanding, a product would be "dangerous to health," andtherefore misbranded under $ 352( j), when, in comparison to
leaving the product on the market, a ban would not produce"adverse health consequences" in aggregate. Quite simply,
these are different inquiries. Although banning a particularproduct might be detrimental to public health in aggregate,
the product could still be "dangerous to health" when usedas directed. Section 352( j) focuses on dangers to the consumer from use of the product, not those stemming from theagency's remedial measures.

142 FDA v. BROWN & WILLIAMSON TOBACCO CORP.

Opinion of the Court
Consequently, the analogy made by the FDA and the dis-sent to highly toxic drugs used in the treatment of various

cancers is unpersuasive. See 61 Fed. Reg. 44413 (1996);
post, at 177 (opinion of Although "dangerous"
in some sense, these drugs are safe within the meaning ofthe Act because, for certain patients, the therapeutic benefits

outweigh the risk of harm. Accordingly, such drugs cannot
properly be described as "dangerous to health" under 21U. S. C. $ 352( j). The same is not true for tobacco products.

As the FDA has documented in great detail, cigarettes andsmokeless tobacco are an unsafe means to obtaining

any
pharmacological effect.

The dissent contends that our conclusion means that "the
FDCA requires the FDA to ban outright `dangerous' drugs
or devices," post, at 174, and that this is a "perverse" reading
of the statute, post, at 174, 180. This misunderstands our
holding. The FDA, consistent with the FDCA, may clearly
regulate many "dangerous" products without banning them.
Indeed, virtually every drug or device poses dangers under
certain conditions. What the FDA may not do is conclude
that a drug or device cannot be used safely for any therapeutic purpose and yet, at the same time, allow that product to
remain on the market. Such regulation is incompatible with
the FDCA's core objective of ensuring that every drug or
device is safe and effective.

Considering the FDCA as a whole, it is clear that Congress intended to exclude tobacco products from the FDA's
jurisdiction. A fundamental precept of the FDCA is that
any product regulated by the FDA--but not banned--must
be safe for its intended use. Various provisions of the Act
make clear that this refers to the safety of using the product
to obtain its intended effects, not the public health ramifications of alternative administrative actions by the FDA.
That is, the FDA must determine that there is a reasonable
assurance that the product's therapeutic benefits outweigh
the risk of harm to the consumer. According to this stand529US1 Unit: $U36 [09-26-01 08:36:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN

143Cite as: 529 U. S. 120 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
ard, the FDA has concluded that, although tobacco productsmight be effective in delivering certain pharmacological effects, they are "unsafe" and "dangerous" when used for thesepurposes. Consequently, if tobacco products were within
the FDA's jurisdiction, the Act would require the FDA toremove them from the market entirely. But a ban would
contradict Congress' clear intent as expressed in its morerecent, tobacco-specific legislation. The inescapable conclusion is that there is no room for tobacco products within theFDCA's regulatory scheme. If they cannot be used safely
for any therapeutic purpose, and yet they cannot be banned,they simply do not fit.

B
In determining whether Congress has spoken directly tothe FDA's authority to regulate tobacco, we must also consider in greater detail the tobacco-specific legislation thatCongress has enacted over the past 35 years. At the time a
statute is enacted, it may have a range of plausible meanings.Over time, however, subsequent acts can shape or focus
those meanings. The "classic judicial task of reconcilingmany laws enacted over time, and getting them to `make
sense' in combination, necessarily assumes that the implica-tions of a statute may be altered by the implications of a
later statute." United States v. Fausto, 484 U. S., at 453.This is particularly so where the scope of the earlier statute
is broad but the subsequent statutes more specifically ad-dress the topic at hand. As we recognized recently in
United States v. Estate of Romani, "a specific policy embod-ied in a later federal statute should control our construction
of the [earlier] statute, even though it ha[s] not been ex-pressly amended." 523 U. S., at 530-531.

Congress has enacted six separate pieces of legislationsince 1965 addressing the problem of tobacco use and human
health. See supra, at 137-138. Those statutes, amongother things, require that health warnings appear on all
packaging and in all print and outdoor advertisements, see

Opinion of the Court
15 U. S. C. $$ 1331, 1333, 4402; prohibit the advertisement oftobacco products through "any medium of electronic communication" subject to regulation by the Federal Communica-tions Commission (FCC), see $$ 1335, 4402(f); require the
Secretary of HHS to report every three years to Congresson research findings concerning "the addictive property of
tobacco," 42 U. S. C. $ 290aa-2(b)(2); and make States' receipt
of certain federal block grants contingent on their makingit unlawful "for any manufacturer, retailer, or distributor of

tobacco products to sell or distribute any such product to anyindividual under the age of 18," $ 300x-26(a)(1).

In adopting each statute, Congress has acted against the
backdrop of the FDA's consistent and repeated statements
that it lacked authority under the FDCA to regulate tobacco
absent claims of therapeutic benefit by the manufacturer.
In fact, on several occasions over this period, and after the
health consequences of tobacco use and nicotine's pharmacological effects had become well known, Congress considered
and rejected bills that would have granted the FDA such
jurisdiction. Under these circumstances, it is evident that
Congress' tobacco-specific statutes have effectively ratified
the FDA's long-held position that it lacks jurisdiction under
the FDCA to regulate tobacco products. Congress has
created a distinct regulatory scheme to address the problem
of tobacco and health, and that scheme, as presently constructed, precludes any role for the FDA.

On January 11, 1964, the Surgeon General released the
report of the Advisory Committee on Smoking and Health.
That report documented the deleterious health effects of
smoking in great detail, concluding, in relevant part, "that
cigarette smoking contributes substantially to mortality
from certain specific diseases and to the overall death rate."
1964 Surgeon General's Report 31. It also identified the
pharmacological effects of nicotine, including "stimulation,"
"tranquilization," and "suppression of appetite." Id., at 74-
75. Seven days after the report's release, the Federal Trade

Opinion of the Court
Commission (FTC) issued a notice of proposed rulemaking,see 29 Fed. Reg. 530-532 (1964), and in June 1964, the FTC

promulgated a final rule requiring cigarette manufacturers"to disclose, clearly and prominently, in all advertising and
on every pack, box, carton or other container . . . that ciga-rette smoking is dangerous to health and may cause death
from cancer and other diseases," id., at 8325. The rule was
to become effective January 1, 1965, but, on a request fromCongress, the FTC postponed enforcement for six months.

See Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U. S. 504, 513-514(1992).

In response to the Surgeon General's report and the FTC's
proposed rule, Congress convened hearings to consider legislation addressing "the tobacco problem." 1964 Hearings 1.
During those deliberations, FDA representatives testified
before Congress that the agency lacked jurisdiction under
the FDCA to regulate tobacco products. Surgeon General
Terry was asked during hearings in 1964 whether HEW had
the "authority to brand or label the packages of cigarettes or
to control the advertising there." Id., at 56. The Surgeon
General stated that "we do not have such authority in existing laws governing the . . . Food and Drug Administration."
Ibid. Similarly, FDA Deputy Commissioner Rankin testified in 1965 that "[t]he Food and Drug Administration has no
jurisdiction under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act over
tobacco, unless it bears drug claims." Cigarette Labeling
and Advertising--1965: Hearings on H. R. 2248 before the
House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, 89th

meet the definitions in the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for
food, drug, device or cosmetic"). In fact, HEW Secretary

Opinion of the Court
"smoking products" because, in light of the findings in theSurgeon General's report, such a "provision might well completely outlaw at least cigarettes. This would be contraryto what, we understand, is intended or what, in the light of
our experience with the 18th amendment, would be accept-able to the American people." 1964 Hearings 18.

The FDA's disavowal of jurisdiction was consistent with
the position that it had taken since the agency's inception.As the FDA concedes, it never asserted authority to regulate

tobacco products as customarily marketed until it promul-gated the regulations at issue here. See Brief for Petitioners 37; see also Brief for Appellee (FDA) in Action on Smoking and Health v. Harris, 655 F. 2d 236 (CADC 1980), in 9
Rec. in No. 97-1604 (CA4), Tab No. 4, pp. 14-15 ("In the 73
years since the enactment of the original Food and Drug Act,
and in the 41 years since the promulgation of the modern
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the FDA has repeatedly informed Congress that cigarettes are beyond the scope of the
statute absent health claims establishing a therapeutic intent
on behalf of the manufacturer or vendor").

The FDA's position was also consistent with Congress'
specific intent when it enacted the FDCA. Before the Act's
adoption in 1938, the FDA's predecessor agency, the Bureau
of Chemistry, announced that it lacked authority to regulate
tobacco products under the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906,
ch. 3915, 34 Stat. 768, unless they were marketed with therapeutic claims. See U. S. Dept. of Agriculture, Bureau of
Chemistry, 13 Service and Regulatory Announcements 24
(Apr. 1914) (Feb. 1914 Announcements || 13, Opinion of Chief
of Bureau C. L. Alsberg). In 1929, Congress considered and
rejected a bill "[t]o amend the Food and Drugs Act of June
30, 1906, by extending its provisions to tobacco and tobacco
products." S. 1468, 71st Cong., 1st Sess., 1. See also 71
Cong. Rec. 2589 (1929) (remarks of Sen. Smoot). And, as the
FDA admits, there is no evidence in the text of the FDCA or
its legislative history that Congress in 1938 even considered

529US1 Unit: $U36 [09-26-01 08:36:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN

147Cite as: 529 U. S. 120 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
the applicability of the Act to tobacco products. See Brieffor Petitioners 22, n. 4. Given the economic and political

significance of the tobacco industry at the time, it is ex-tremely unlikely that Congress could have intended to place
tobacco within the ambit of the FDCA absent any discussionof the matter. Of course, whether the Congress that
enacted the FDCA specifically intended the Act to cover tobacco products is not determinative; "it is ultimately the pro-visions of our laws rather than the principal concerns of our

legislators by which we are governed." Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., 523 U. S. 75, 79 (1998); see
also TVA v. Hill, 437 U. S. 153, 185 (1978) ("It is not for us
to speculate, much less act, on whether Congress would have
altered its stance had the specific events of this case been
anticipated"). Nonetheless, this intent is certainly relevant
to understanding the basis for the FDA's representations
to Congress and the background against which Congress
enacted subsequent tobacco-specific legislation.

Moreover, before enacting the FCLAA in 1965, Congress
considered and rejected several proposals to give the FDA
the authority to regulate tobacco. In April 1963, Representative Udall introduced a bill "[t]o amend the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act so as to make that Act applicable to smoking products." H. R. 5973, 88th Cong., 1st Sess.,
1. Two months later, Senator Moss introduced an identical
bill in the Senate. S. 1682, 88th Cong., 1st Sess. (1963). In
discussing his proposal on the Senate floor, Senator Moss
explained that "this amendment simply places smoking products under FDA jurisdiction, along with foods, drugs, and
cosmetics." 109 Cong. Rec. 10322 (1963). In December
1963, Representative Rhodes introduced another bill that
would have amended the FDCA "by striking out `food, drug,
device, or cosmetic, each place where it appears therein and
inserting in lieu thereof `food, drug, device, cosmetic, or
smoking product.' " H. R. 9512, 88th Cong., 1st Sess., $ 3
(1963). And in January 1965, five months before passage of

148 FDA v. BROWN & WILLIAMSON TOBACCO CORP.

Opinion of the Court
the FCLAA, Representative Udall again introduced a bill toamend the FDCA "to make that Act applicable to smoking

products." H. R. 2248, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., 1. None ofthese proposals became law.

Congress ultimately decided in 1965 to subject tobaccoproducts to the less extensive regulatory scheme of the
FCLAA, which created a "comprehensive Federal program
to deal with cigarette labeling and advertising with respectto any relationship between smoking and health." Pub. L.

89-92, $ 2, 79 Stat. 282. The FCLAA rejected any regula-tion of advertising, but it required the warning

, "Caution:
Cigarette Smoking May Be Hazardous to Your Health," to
appear on all cigarette packages. Id., $ 4, 79 Stat. 283. In
the FCLAA's "Declaration of Policy," Congress stated that
its objective was to balance the goals of ensuring that "the
public may be adequately informed that cigarette smoking
may be hazardous to health" and protecting "commerce and
the national economy . . . to the maximum extent." Id., $ 2,
79 Stat. 282 (codified at 15 U. S. C. $ 1331).

Not only did Congress reject the proposals to grant the
FDA jurisdiction, but it explicitly pre-empted any other regulation of cigarette labeling: "No statement relating to smoking and health, other than the statement required by . . . this
Act, shall be required on any cigarette package." Pub. L.
89-92, $ 5(a), 79 Stat. 283. The regulation of product labeling, however, is an integral aspect of the FDCA, both as it
existed in 1965 and today. The labeling requirements currently imposed by the FDCA, which are essentially identical
to those in force in 1965, require the FDA to regulate the
labeling of drugs and devices to protect the safety of consumers. See 21 U. S. C. $ 352; 21 U. S. C. $ 352 (1964 ed. and
Supp. IV). As discussed earlier, the Act requires that all
products bear "adequate directions for use . . . as are necessary for the protection of users," 21 U. S. C. $ 352(f )(1); 21
U. S. C. $ 352(f )(1) (1964 ed.); requires that all products provide "adequate warnings against use in those pathological

conditions or by children where its use may be dangerous tohealth," 21 U. S. C. $ 352(f )(2); 21 U. S. C. $ 352(f)(2) (1964

ed.); and deems a product misbranded "[i]f it is dangerous tohealth when used in the dosage or manner, or with the frequency or duration prescribed, recommended, or suggestedin the labeling thereof," 21 U. S. C. $ 352( j); 21 U. S. C.

$ 352( j) (1964 ed.). In this sense, the FCLAA was--and remains--incompatible with FDA regulation of tobacco prod-ucts. This is not to say that the FCLAA's pre-emption provision by itself necessarily foreclosed FDA jurisdiction. See
Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U. S., at 518-519. But
it is an important factor in assessing whether Congress
ratified the agency's position--that is, whether Congress
adopted a regulatory approach to the problem of tobacco and
health that contemplated no role for the FDA.

Further, the FCLAA evidences Congress' intent to preclude any administrative agency from exercising significant
policymaking authority on the subject of smoking and health.
In addition to prohibiting any additional requirements for
cigarette labeling, the FCLAA provided that "[n]o statement
relating to smoking and health shall be required in the advertising of any cigarettes the packages of which are labeled
in conformity with the provisions of this Act." Pub. L. 89-
92, $ 5(b), 79 Stat. 283. Thus, in reaction to the FTC's attempt to regulate cigarette labeling and advertising, Congress enacted a statute reserving exclusive control over both
subjects to itself.

Subsequent tobacco-specific legislation followed a similar
pattern. By the FCLAA's own terms, the prohibition on
any additional cigarette labeling or advertising regulations
relating to smoking and health was to expire July 1, 1969.
See $ 10, 79 Stat. 284. In anticipation of the provision's expiration, both the FCC and the FTC proposed rules governing
the advertisement of cigarettes. See 34 Fed. Reg. 1959
(1969) (FCC proposed rule to "ban the broadcast of cigarette
commercials by radio and television stations"); id., at 7917

(FTC proposed rule requiring manufacturers to disclose onall packaging and in all print advertising " `that cigarette

tobacco, see generally Cigarette Labeling and Advertising--
1969: Hearings before the House Committee on Interstateand Foreign Commerce, 91st Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 2 (1969),

Congress amended the FCLAA by banning cigarette adver-tisements "on any medium of electronic communication subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications Commission" and strengthening the warning required to appear
on cigarette packages. Public Health Cigarette Smoking
Act of 1969, Pub. L. 91-222, $$ 4, 6, 84 Stat. 88-89. Importantly, Congress extended indefinitely the prohibition on any
other regulation of cigarette labeling with respect to smoking and health (again despite the importance of labeling regulation under the FDCA). $ 5(a), 84 Stat. 88 (codified at 15
U. S. C. $ 1334(a)). Moreover, it expressly forbade the FTC
from taking any action on its pending rule until July 1, 1971,
and it required the FTC, if it decided to proceed with its rule
thereafter, to notify Congress at least six months in advance
of the rule's becoming effective. $ 7(a), 84 Stat. 89. As the
chairman of the House committee in which the bill originated
stated, "the Congress--the body elected by the people--
must make the policy determinations involved in this legislation--and not some agency made up of appointed officials."
116 Cong. Rec. 7920 (1970) (remarks of Rep. Staggers).

Four years later, after Congress had transferred the authority to regulate substances covered by the Hazardous
Substances Act (HSA) from the FDA to the Consumer Products Safety Commission (CPSC), the American Public Health
Association, joined by Senator Moss, petitioned the CPSC to
regulate cigarettes yielding more than 21 milligrams of tar.
See Action on Smoking and Health v. Harris, 655 F. 2d 236,

Opinion of the Court
241 (CADC 1980); R. Kluger, Ashes to Ashes 375-376 (1996).After the CPSC determined that it lacked authority under

the HSA to regulate cigarettes, a District Court held thatthe HSA did, in fact, grant the CPSC such jurisdiction
and ordered it to reexamine the petition. See American
Public Health Association v. Consumer Product Safety
Commission, [1972-1975 Transfer Binder] CCH Consumer
Prod. Safety Guide || 75,081 (DC 1975), vacated as moot,No. 75-1863 (CADC 1976). Before the CPSC could take any

action, however, Congress mooted the issue by adopting leg-islation that eliminated the agency's authority to regulate
"tobacco and tobacco products." Consumer Product Safety
Commission Improvements Act of 1976, Pub. L. 94-284,

$ 3(c), 90 Stat. 503 (codified at 15 U. S. C. $ 1261(f)(2)). Senator Moss acknowledged that the "legislation, in effect, reverse[d]" the District Court's decision, 121 Cong. Rec. 23563
(1975), and the FDA later observed that the episode was
"particularly" "indicative of the policy of Congress to limit
the regulatory authority over cigarettes by Federal Agencies," Letter to Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) Executive Director Banzhaf from FDA Comm'r Goyan (Nov. 25,
1980), App. 59. A separate statement in the Senate Report
underscored that the legislation's purpose was to "unmistakably reaffirm the clear mandate of the Congress that the
basic regulation of tobacco and tobacco products is governed
by the legislation dealing with the subject, . . . and that any
further regulation in this sensitive and complex area must
be reserved for specific Congressional action." S. Rep.
No. 94-251, p. 43 (1975) (additional views of Sens. Hartke,
Hollings, Ford, Stevens, and Beall).

Meanwhile, the FDA continued to maintain that it lacked
jurisdiction under the FDCA to regulate tobacco products as
customarily marketed. In 1972, FDA Commissioner Edwards testified before Congress that "cigarettes recommended for smoking pleasure are beyond the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act." 1972 Hearings 239, 242. He fur529US1 Unit: $U36 [09-26-01 08:36:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN
152 FDA v. BROWN & WILLIAMSON TOBACCO CORP.

Opinion of the Court
ther stated that the FDA believed that the Public HealthCigarette Smoking Act "demonstrates that the regulation of

cigarettes is to be the domain of Congress," and that "label-ing or banning cigarettes is a step that can be take[n] only
by the Congress. Any such move by FDA would be incon-sistent with the clear congressional intent."

Ibid.
In 1977, ASH filed a citizen petition requesting that the
FDA regulate cigarettes, citing many of the same groundsthat motivated the FDA's rulemaking here. See Citizen Petition, No. 77P-0185 (May 26, 1977), 10 Rec. in No. 97-1604(CA4), Tab No. 22, pp. 1-10. ASH asserted that nicotine
was highly addictive and had strong physiological effects on
the body; that those effects were "intended" because consumers use tobacco products precisely to obtain those effects; and that tobacco causes thousands of premature deaths
annually. Ibid. In denying ASH's petition, FDA Commissioner Kennedy stated that "[t]he interpretation of the Act
by FDA consistently has been that cigarettes are not a drug
unless health claims are made by the vendors." Letter to
ASH Executive Director Banzhaf (Dec. 5, 1977), App. 47.
After the matter proceeded to litigation, the FDA argued in
its brief to the Court of Appeals that "cigarettes are not
comprehended within the statutory definition of the term
`drug' absent objective evidence that vendors represent or
intend that their products be used as a drug." Brief for Appellee in Action on Smoking and Health v. Harris, 655 F. 2d
236 (CADC 1980), 9 Rec. in No. 97-1604 (CA4), Tab No. 4,
at 27-28. The FDA also contended that Congress had "long
been aware that the FDA does not consider cigarettes to be
within its regulatory authority in the absence of health
claims made on behalf of the manufacturer or vendor," and
that, because "Congress has never acted to disturb the
agency's interpretation," it had "acquiesced in the FDA's interpretation of the statutory limits on its authority to regulate cigarettes." Id., at 23, 27, n. 23. The Court of Appeals
upheld the FDA's position, concluding that "[i]f the statute

requires expansion, that is the job of Congress." Action on
Smoking and Health v. Harris, 655 F. 2d, at 243. In 1980,
the FDA also denied a request by ASH to commence rule-making proceedings to establish the agency's jurisdiction to

regulate cigarettes as devices. See Letter to ASH Execu-tive Director Banzhaf from FDA Comm'r Goyan (Nov. 25,
1980), App. 50-51. The agency stated that "[i]nsofar as
rulemaking would relate to cigarettes or attached filters ascustomarily marketed, we have concluded that FDA has no

jurisdiction under section 201(h) of the Act [21 U. S. C.$ 321(h)]."

Id., at 67.
In 1983, Congress again considered legislation on the
subject of smoking and health. HHS Assistant Secretary
Brandt testified that, in addition to being "a major cause of
cancer," smoking is a "major cause of heart disease" and
other serious illnesses, and can result in "unfavorable pregnancy outcomes." 1983 House Hearings 19-20. He also
stated that it was "well-established that cigarette smoking is a drug dependence, and that smoking is addictive for
many people." Id., at 20. Nonetheless, Assistant Secretary Brandt maintained that "the issue of regulation of
tobacco . . . is something that Congress has reserved to itself,
and we do not within the Department have the authority to
regulate nor are we seeking such authority." Id., at 74. He
also testified before the Senate, stating that, despite the evidence of tobacco's health effects and addictiveness, the Department's view was that "Congress has assumed the responsibility of regulating . . . cigarettes." Smoking Prevention
and Education Act: Hearings on S. 772 before the Senate
Committee on Labor and Human Resources, 98th Cong., 1st
Sess., 56 (1983) (hereinafter 1983 Senate Hearings).

Against this backdrop, Congress enacted three additional
tobacco-specific statutes over the next four years that incrementally expanded its regulatory scheme for tobacco products. In 1983, Congress adopted the Alcohol and Drug
Abuse Amendments, Pub. L. 98-24, 97 Stat. 175 (codified at

Opinion of the Court
42 U. S. C. $ 290aa et seq.), which require the Secretary ofHHS to report to Congress every three years on the "addictive property of tobacco" and to include recommendations foraction that the Secretary may deem appropriate. A year
later, Congress enacted the Comprehensive Smoking Educa-tion Act, Pub. L. 98-474, 98 Stat. 2200, which amended the
FCLAA by again modifying the prescribed warning. Notably, during debate on the Senate floor, Senator Hawkinsargued that the FCLAA was necessary in part because

"[u]nder the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Congressexempted tobacco products." 130 Cong. Rec. 26953 (1984).
And in 1986, Congress enacted the Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act of 1986 (CSTHEA), Pub.
L. 99-252, 100 Stat. 30 (codified at 15 U. S. C. $ 4401 et seq.),
which essentially extended the regulatory provisions of the
FCLAA to smokeless tobacco products. Like the FCLAA,
the CSTHEA provided that "[n]o statement relating to the
use of smokeless tobacco products and health, other than the
statements required by [the Act], shall be required by any
Federal agency to appear on any package . . . of a smokeless
tobacco product." $ 7(a), 100 Stat. 34 (codified at 15 U. S. C.

$ 4406(a)). Thus, as with cigarettes, Congress reserved for
itself an aspect of smokeless tobacco regulation that is particularly important to the FDCA's regulatory scheme.

In 1988, the Surgeon General released a report summarizing the abundant scientific literature demonstrating that
"[c]igarettes and other forms of tobacco are addicting," and
that "nicotine is psychoactive" and "causes physical dependence characterized by a withdrawal syndrome that usually
accompanies nicotine abstinence." 1988 Surgeon General's
Report 14. The report further concluded that the "pharmacologic and behavioral processes that determine tobacco addiction are similar to those that determine addiction to drugs
such as heroin and cocaine." Id., at 15. In the same year,
FDA Commissioner Young stated before Congress that "it
doesn't look like it is possible to regulate [tobacco] under the

Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act even though smoking, I think,has been widely recognized as being harmful to human

health." Rural Development, Agriculture, and RelatedAgencies Appropriations for 1989: Hearings before a Subcommittee of the House Committee on Appropriations, 100thCong., 2d Sess., 409 (1988). At the same hearing, the FDA's
General Counsel testified that "what is fairly important in
FDA law is whether a product has a therapeutic purpose,"and "[c]igarettes themselves are not used for a therapeutic

purpose as that concept is ordinarily understood." Id., at410. Between 1987 and 1989, Congress considered three
more bills that would have amended the FDCA to grant the
FDA jurisdiction to regulate tobacco products. See H. R.
3294, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. (1987); H. R. 1494, 101st Cong.,
1st Sess. (1989); S. 769, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. (1989). As
before, Congress rejected the proposals. In 1992, Congress
instead adopted the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health
Administration Reorganization Act, Pub. L. 102-321, $ 202,
106 Stat. 394 (codified at 42 U. S. C. $ 300x et seq.), which
creates incentives for States to regulate the retail sale of
tobacco products by making States' receipt of certain block
grants contingent on their prohibiting the sale of tobacco
products to minors.

Taken together, these actions by Congress over the past
35 years preclude an interpretation of the FDCA that grants
the FDA jurisdiction to regulate tobacco products. We do
not rely on Congress' failure to act--its consideration and
rejection of bills that would have given the FDA this authority--in reaching this conclusion. Indeed, this is not a case
of simple inaction by Congress that purportedly represents
its acquiescence in an agency's position. To the contrary,
Congress has enacted several statutes addressing the particular subject of tobacco and health, creating a distinct regulatory scheme for cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. In doing
so, Congress has been aware of tobacco's health hazards and
its pharmacological effects. It has also enacted this legisla529US1 Unit: $U36 [09-26-01 08:36:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN
156 FDA v. BROWN & WILLIAMSON TOBACCO CORP.

Opinion of the Court
tion against the background of the FDA repeatedly and con-sistently asserting that it lacks jurisdiction under the FDCA

to regulate tobacco products as customarily marketed. Fur-ther, Congress has persistently acted to preclude a meaningful role for any administrative agency in making policy onthe subject of tobacco and health. Moreover, the substance
of Congress' regulatory scheme is, in an important respect,
incompatible with FDA jurisdiction. Although the super-vision of product labeling to protect consumer health is a

substantial component of the FDA's regulation of drugs anddevices, see 21 U. S. C. $ 352 (1994 ed. and Supp. III), the
FCLAA and the CSTHEA explicitly prohibit any federal
agency from imposing any health-related labeling requirements on cigarettes or smokeless tobacco products, see 15
U. S. C. $$ 1334(a), 4406(a).

Under these circumstances, it is clear that Congress'
tobacco-specific legislation has effectively ratified the FDA's
previous position that it lacks jurisdiction to regulate tobacco. As in Bob Jones Univ. v. United States, 461 U. S. 574
(1983), "[i]t is hardly conceivable that Congress--and in this
setting, any Member of Congress--was not abundantly
aware of what was going on." Id., at 600-601. Congress
has affirmatively acted to address the issue of tobacco and
health, relying on the representations of the FDA that it had
no authority to regulate tobacco. It has created a distinct
scheme to regulate the sale of tobacco products, focused on
labeling and advertising, and premised on the belief that the
FDA lacks such jurisdiction under the FDCA. As a result,
Congress' tobacco-specific statutes preclude the FDA from
regulating tobacco products as customarily marketed.

Although the dissent takes issue with our discussion of the
FDA's change in position, post, at 186-189, our conclusion does
not rely on the fact that the FDA's assertion of jurisdiction
represents a sharp break with its prior interpretation of the
FDCA. Certainly, an agency's initial interpretation of a
statute that it is charged with administering is not "carved

(1983), agencies "must be given ample latitude to `adapt theirrules and policies to the demands of changing circumstances.' " Id., at 42 (quoting Permian Basin Area Rate
Cases, 390 U. S. 747, 784 (1968)). The consistency of theFDA's prior position is significant in this case for a different

reason: It provides important context to Congress' enact-ment of its tobacco-specific legislation. When the FDA repeatedly informed Congress that the FDCA does not grant
it the authority to regulate tobacco products, its statements
were consistent with the agency's unwavering position since
its inception, and with the position that its predecessor
agency had first taken in 1914. Although not crucial, the
consistency of the FDA's prior position bolsters the conclusion that when Congress created a distinct regulatory
scheme addressing the subject of tobacco and health, it understood that the FDA is without jurisdiction to regulate
tobacco products and ratified that position.

The dissent also argues that the proper inference to be
drawn from Congress' tobacco-specific legislation is "critically ambivalent." Post, at 182. We disagree. In that series of statutes, Congress crafted a specific legislative response to the problem of tobacco and health, and it did so
with the understanding, based on repeated assertions by the
FDA, that the agency has no authority under the FDCA to
regulate tobacco products. Moreover, Congress expressly
pre-empted any other regulation of the labeling of tobacco
products concerning their health consequences, even though
the oversight of labeling is central to the FDCA's regulatory
scheme. And in addressing the subject, Congress consistently evidenced its intent to preclude any federal agency
from exercising significant policymaking authority in the
area. Under these circumstances, we believe the appro529US1 Unit: $U36 [09-26-01 08:36:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
priate inference--that Congress intended to ratify the FDA'sprior position that it lacks jurisdiction--is unmistakable.

The dissent alternatively argues that, even if Congress'subsequent tobacco-specific legislation did, in fact, ratify the
FDA's position, that position was merely a contingent dis-avowal of jurisdiction. Specifically, the dissent contends
that "the FDA's traditional view was largely premised on
a perceived inability to prove the necessary statutory `in-tent' requirement."

Post, at 189-190. A fair reading of the
FDA's representations prior to 1995, however, demonstratesthat the agency's position was essentially unconditional.

See, e. g., 1972 Hearings 239, 242 (statement of Comm'r Edwards) ("[R]egulation of cigarettes is to be the domain of
Congress," and "[a]ny such move by FDA would be inconsistent with the clear congressional intent"); 1983 House Hearings 74 (statement of Assistant Secretary Brandt) ("[T]he
issue of regulation of tobacco . . . is something that Congress
has reserved to itself "); 1983 Senate Hearings 56 (statement
of Assistant Secretary Brandt) ("Congress has assumed the
responsibility of regulating . . . cigarettes"); Brief for Appellee in Action on Smoking and Health v. Harris, 655 F. 2d
236 (CADC 1980), 9 Rec. in No. 97-1604 (CA4), Tab No. 4,
at 27, n. 23 (because "Congress has never acted to disturb
the agency's interpretation," it "acquiesced in the FDA's interpretation"). To the extent the agency's position could be
characterized as equivocal, it was only with respect to the
well-established exception of when the manufacturer makes
express claims of therapeutic benefit. See, e. g., 1965 Hearings 193 (statement of Deputy Comm'r Rankin) ("The Food
and Drug Administration has no jurisdiction under the Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act over tobacco, unless it bears drug
claims"); Letter to ASH Executive Director Banzhaf from

Opinion of the Court
FDA Comm'r Goyan (Nov. 25, 1980), id., at 67 ("Insofar asrulemaking would relate to cigarettes or attached filters as

customarily marketed, we have concluded that FDA has nojurisdiction"). Thus, what Congress ratified was the FDA's
plain and resolute position that the FDCA gives the agencyno authority to regulate tobacco products as customarily
marketed. C

Finally, our inquiry into whether Congress has directlyspoken to the precise question at issue is shaped, at least
in some measure, by the nature of the question presented.Deference under

Chevron to an agency's construction of astatute that it administers is premised on the theory that a

statute's ambiguity constitutes an implicit delegation fromCongress to the agency to fill in the statutory gaps. See
Chevron, supra, at 844. In extraordinary cases, however,there may be reason to hesitate before concluding that Congress has intended such an implicit delegation. Cf. Breyer,Judicial Review of Questions of Law and Policy, 38 Admin.
L. Rev. 363, 370 (1986) ("A court may also ask whether thelegal question is an important one. Congress is more likely
to have focused upon, and answered, major questions, whileleaving interstitial matters to answer themselves in the
course of the statute's daily administration").This is hardly an ordinary case. Contrary to its representations to Congress since 1914, the FDA has now assertedjurisdiction to regulate an industry constituting a significant
portion of the American economy. In fact, the FDA con-tends that, were it to determine that tobacco products provide no "reasonable assurance of safety," it would have theauthority to ban cigarettes and smokeless tobacco entirely.
See Brief for Petitioners 35-36; Reply Brief for Petitioners14. Owing to its unique place in American history and society, tobacco has its own unique political history. Congress,for better or for worse, has created a distinct regulatory
scheme for tobacco products, squarely rejected proposals to

Opinion of the Court
give the FDA jurisdiction over tobacco, and repeatedly acted
to preclude any agency from exercising significant policymaking authority in the area. Given this history and the
breadth of the authority that the FDA has asserted, we are
obliged to defer not to the agency's expansive construction
of the statute, but to Congress' consistent judgment to deny
the FDA this power.

Our decision in MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. American Telephone & Telegraph Co., 512 U. S. 218 (1994), is instructive. That case involved the proper construction of the
term "modify" in $ 203(b) of the Communications Act of 1934.
The FCC contended that, because the Act gave it the discretion to "modify any requirement" imposed under the statute,
it therefore possessed the authority to render voluntary the
otherwise mandatory requirement that long distance carriers file their rates. Id., at 225. We rejected the FCC's construction, finding "not the slightest doubt" that Congress had
directly spoken to the question. Id., at 228. In reasoning
even more apt here, we concluded that "[i]t is highly unlikely
that Congress would leave the determination of whether
an industry will be entirely, or even substantially, rateregulated to agency discretion--and even more unlikely that
it would achieve that through such a subtle device as permission to `modify' rate-filing requirements." Id., at 231.

As in MCI, we are confident that Congress could not have
intended to delegate a decision of such economic and political
significance to an agency in so cryptic a fashion. To find
that the FDA has the authority to regulate tobacco products,
one must not only adopt an extremely strained understanding of "safety" as it is used throughout the Act--a concept
central to the FDCA's regulatory scheme--but also ignore
the plain implication of Congress' subsequent tobaccospecific legislation. It is therefore clear, based on the
FDCA's overall regulatory scheme and the subsequent tobacco legislation, that Congress has directly spoken to the

question at issue and precluded the FDA from regulating
tobacco products.

* * *

By no means do we question the seriousness of the problem that the FDA has sought to address. The agency has
amply demonstrated that tobacco use, particularly among
children and adolescents, poses perhaps the single most significant threat to public health in the United States. Nonetheless, no matter how "important, conspicuous, and controversial" the issue, and regardless of how likely the public is
to hold the Executive Branch politically accountable, post, at
190, an administrative agency's power to regulate in the public interest must always be grounded in a valid grant of authority from Congress. And " `[i]n our anxiety to effectuate
the congressional purpose of protecting the public, we must
take care not to extend the scope of the statute beyond the
point where Congress indicated it would stop.' " United

800 (1969) (quoting 62 Cases of Jam v. United States, 340
U. S. 593, 600 (1951)). Reading the FDCA as a whole, as
well as in conjunction with Congress' subsequent tobaccospecific legislation, it is plain that Congress has not given
the FDA the authority that it seeks to exercise here. For
these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the
Fourth Circuit is affirmed.

It is so ordered.

Souter, and Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has the authority to regulate "articles (other than food) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body . . . ." Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), 21 U. S. C.

$ 321(g)(1)(C). Unlike the majority, I believe that tobacco
products fit within this statutory language.

In its own interpretation, the majority nowhere denies the
following two salient points. First, tobacco products (including cigarettes) fall within the scope of this statutory
definition, read literally. Cigarettes achieve their moodstabilizing effects through the interaction of the chemical
nicotine and the cells of the central nervous system. Both
cigarette manufacturers and smokers alike know of, and desire, that chemically induced result. Hence, cigarettes are
"intended to affect" the body's "structure" and "function," in
the literal sense of these words.

Second, the statute's basic purpose--the protection of
public health--supports the inclusion of cigarettes within
its scope. See United States v. Article of Drug . . . BactoUnidisk, 394 U. S. 784, 798 (1969) (FDCA "is to be given a
liberal construction consistent with [its] overriding purpose to protect the public health" (emphasis added)). Unregulated tobacco use causes "[m]ore than 400,000 people [to]
die each year from tobacco-related illnesses, such as cancer,
respiratory illnesses, and heart disease." 61 Fed. Reg.
44398 (1996). Indeed, tobacco products kill more people in
this country every year "than . . . AIDS . . . , car accidents,
alcohol, homicides, illegal drugs, suicides, and fires, combined." Ibid. (emphasis added).

Despite the FDCA's literal language and general purpose
(both of which support the FDA's finding that cigarettes
come within its statutory authority), the majority nonetheless reads the statute as excluding tobacco products for two
basic reasons:

(1) the FDCA does not "fit" the case of tobacco because
the statute requires the FDA to prohibit dangerous
drugs or devices (like cigarettes) outright, and the
agency concedes that simply banning the sale of cigarettes is not a proper remedy, ante, at 139-141; and

(2) Congress has enacted other statutes, which, when
viewed in light of the FDA's long history of denying

529US1 Unit: $U36 [09-26-01 08:36:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN

dissenting
tobacco-related jurisdiction and considered together
with Congress' failure explicitly to grant the agency
tobacco-specific authority, demonstrate that Congress
did not intend for the FDA to exercise jurisdiction over
tobacco, ante, at 155-156.

In my view, neither of these propositions is valid. Rather,
the FDCA does not significantly limit the FDA's remedial
alternatives. See infra, at 174-181. And the later statutes
do not tell the FDA it cannot exercise jurisdiction, but simply leave FDA jurisdictional law where Congress found it.
See infra, at 181-186; cf. Food and Drug Administration
Modernization Act of 1997, 111 Stat. 2380 (codified at note following 21 U. S. C. $ 321 (1994 ed., Supp. III)) (statute "shall"
not "be construed to affect the question of whether" the FDA
"has any authority to regulate any tobacco product").

The bulk of the opinion that follows will explain the basis
for these latter conclusions. In short, I believe that the
most important indicia of statutory meaning--language and
purpose--along with the FDCA's legislative history (described briefly in Part I) are sufficient to establish that the
FDA has authority to regulate tobacco. The statute-specific
arguments against jurisdiction that the tobacco companies
and the majority rely upon (discussed in Part II) are based
on erroneous assumptions and, thus, do not defeat the
jurisdiction-supporting thrust of the FDCA's language and
purpose. The inferences that the majority draws from later
legislative history are not persuasive, since (as I point out in
Part III) one can just as easily infer from the later laws that
Congress did not intend to affect the FDA's tobacco-related
authority at all. And the fact that the FDA changed its
mind about the scope of its own jurisdiction is legally insignificant because (as Part IV establishes) the agency's reasons
for changing course are fully justified. Finally, as I explain
in Part V, the degree of accountability that likely will attach
to the FDA's action in this case should alleviate any concern

that Congress, rather than an administrative agency, oughtto make this important regulatory decision.

I
Before 1938, the federal Pure Food and Drug Act con-tained only two jurisdictional definitions of "drug":

"[1] medicines and preparations recognized in theUnited States Pharmacopoeia or National Formulary . . .
and [2] any substance or mixture of substances intendedto be used for the cure, mitigation, or prevention of disease." Act of June 30, 1906, ch. 3915, $ 6, 34 Stat. 769.
In 1938, Congress added a third definition, relevant here:

"(3) articles (other than food) intended to affect thestructure or any function of the body . . . ." Act of June

25, 1938, ch. 675, $ 201(g), 52 Stat. 1041 (codified at 21U. S. C. $ 321(g)(1)(C)).

It also added a similar definition in respect to a "device."See $ 201(h), 52 Stat. 1041 (codified at 21 U. S. C. $ 321(h)).
As I have mentioned, the literal language of the third defini-tion and the FDCA's general purpose both strongly support
a projurisdiction reading of the statute. See supra, at161-162.

The statute's history offers further support. The FDAdrafted the new language, and it testified before Congress
that the third definition would expand the FDCA's jurisdic-tional scope significantly. See Hearings on S. 1944 before a
Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Commerce, 73dCong., 2d Sess., 15-16 (1933), reprinted in 1 FDA, Legislative
History of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and ItsAmendments 107-108 (1979) (hereinafter Leg. Hist.). Indeed, "[t]he purpose" of the new definition was to "make pos-sible the regulation of a great many products that have been
found on the market that cannot be alleged to be treatmentsfor diseased conditions."

Id., at 108. While the drafters fo-cused specifically upon the need to give the FDA jurisdiction

over "slenderizing" products such as "antifat remedies,"
ibid., they were aware that, in doing so, they had created
what was "admittedly an inclusive, a wide definition," id., at107. And that broad language was included

deliberately, so
that jurisdiction could be had over "all substances and prep-arations, other than food, and

all devices intended to affect
the structure or any function of the body . . . ." Ibid. (emphasis added); see also Hearings on S. 2800 before the SenateCommittee on Commerce, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., 516 (1934),

reprinted in 2 Leg. Hist. 519 (statement of then-FDA ChiefWalter Campbell acknowledging that "[t]his definition of
`drugs' is all-inclusive").After studying the FDCA's history, experts have written
that the statute "is a purposefully broad delegation of discre-tionary powers by Congress," 1 J. O'Reilly, Food and Drug
Administration $ 6.01, p. 6-1 (2d ed. 1995) (hereinafterO'Reilly), and that, in a sense, the FDCA "must be regarded
as a constitution" that "establish[es] general principles" and"permit[s] implementation within broad parameters" so that
the FDA can "implement these objectives through the most
effective and efficient controls that can be devised." Hutt,Philosophy of Regulation Under the Federal Food, Drug and

Cosmetic Act, 28 Food Drug Cosm. L. J. 177, 178-179 (1973)(emphasis added). This Court, too, has said that the

"historical expansion of the definition of drug, and thecreation of a parallel concept of devices, clearly show . . .
that Congress fully intended that the Act's coverage beas broad as its literal language indicates--and equally
clearly, broader than any strict medical definition might
otherwise allow." Bacto-Unidisk, 394 U. S., at 798.

That Congress would grant the FDA such broad jurisdictional authority should surprise no one. In 1938, the President and much of Congress believed that federal administrative agencies needed broad authority and would exercise that
authority wisely--a view embodied in much Second New

Deal legislation. Cf. Gray v. Powell, 314 U. S. 402, 411-412(1941) (Congress "could have legislated specifically" but decided "to delegate that function to those whose experiencein a particular field gave promise of a better informed, more
equitable" determination). Thus, at around the same timethat it added the relevant language to the FDCA, Congress
enacted laws granting other administrative agencies even
broader powers to regulate much of the Nation's transporta-tion and communication. See,

e. g., Civil Aeronautics Act of
1938, ch. 601, $ 401(d)(1), 52 Stat. 987 (Civil AeronauticsBoard to regulate airlines within confines of highly general

"public convenience and necessity" standard); Motor Carrier
Act of 1935, ch. 498, $ 204(a)(1), 49 Stat. 546 (Interstate Commerce Commission to establish "reasonable requirements"
for trucking); Communications Act of 1934, ch. 652, $ 201(a),
48 Stat. 1070 (Federal Communications Commission (FCC)
to regulate radio, later television, within confines of even
broader "public interest" standard). Why would the 1938
New Deal Congress suddenly have hesitated to delegate to
so well established an agency as the FDA all of the discretionary authority that a straightforward reading of the relevant statutory language implies?

Nor is it surprising that such a statutory delegation of
power could lead after many years to an assertion of jurisdiction that the 1938 legislators might not have expected.
Such a possibility is inherent in the very nature of a broad
delegation. In 1938, it may well have seemed unlikely that
the FDA would ever bring cigarette manufacturers within
the FDCA's statutory language by proving that cigarettes
produce chemical changes in the body and that the makers
"intended" their product chemically to affect the body's
"structure" or "function." Or, back then, it may have
seemed unlikely that, even assuming such proof, the FDA
actually would exercise its discretion to regulate so popular
a product. See R. Kluger, Ashes to Ashes 105 (1997) (in the
1930's "Americans were in love with smoking . . .").

But it should not have seemed unlikely that, assuming theFDA decided to regulate and proved the particular jurisdictional prerequisites, the courts would rule such a juris-dictional assertion fully authorized. Cf. United States v.
Southwestern Cable Co., 392 U. S. 157, 172 (1968) (readingCommunications Act of 1934 as authorizing FCC jurisdiction to regulate cable systems while noting that "Congresscould not in 1934 have foreseen the development of " advanced communications systems). After all, this Court hasread more narrowly phrased statutes to grant what might
have seemed even more unlikely assertions of agency juris-diction. See,

e. g., Permian Basin Area Rate Cases, 390U. S. 747, 774-777 (1968) (statutory authority to regulate interstate "transportation" of natural gas includes authority toregulate "prices" charged by field producers); Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Wisconsin, 347 U. S. 672, 677-684 (1954) (inde-pendent gas producer subject to regulation despite Natural
Gas Act's express exemption of gathering and productionfacilities).

I shall not pursue these general matters further, for nei-ther the companies nor the majority denies that the FDCA's
literal language, its general purpose, and its particular legis-lative history favor the FDA's present jurisdictional view.
Rather, they have made several specific arguments in sup-port of one basic contention: Even if the statutory delegation
is broad, it is not broad enough to include tobacco. I nowturn to each of those arguments.

II

A

The tobacco companies contend that the FDCA's wordscannot possibly be read to mean what they literally say.

The statute defines "device," for example, as "an instrument,apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in
vitro reagent, or other similar or related article . . . intendedto affect the structure or any function of the body . . . ." 21

dissenting
U. S. C. $ 321(h). Taken literally, this definition might include everything from room air conditioners to thermal pajamas. The companies argue that, to avoid such a result, the
meaning of "drug" or "device" should be confined to medical
or therapeutic products, narrowly defined. See Brief for
Respondent United States Tobacco Co. 8-9.

The companies may well be right that the statute should
not be read to cover room air conditioners and winter underwear. But I do not agree that we must accept their proposed limitation. For one thing, such a cramped reading
contravenes the established purpose of the statutory language. See Bacto-Unidisk, 394 U. S., at 798 (third definition is "clearly, broader than any strict medical definition");
1 Leg. Hist. 108 (definition covers products "that cannot be alleged to be treatments for diseased conditions").
For another, the companies' restriction would render the
other two "drug" definitions superfluous. See 21 U. S. C.

$$ 321(g)(1)(A), (g)(1)(B) (covering articles in the leading
pharmacology compendia and those "intended for use in
the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of
disease").

Most importantly, the statute's language itself supplies a
different, more suitable, limitation: that a "drug" must be a
chemical agent. The FDCA's "device" definition states that
an article which affects the structure or function of the body
is a "device" only if it "does not achieve its primary intended
purposes through chemical action within . . . the body," and
"is not dependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of its primary intended purposes." $ 321(h) (emphasis
added). One can readily infer from this language that at
least an article that does achieve its primary purpose
through chemical action within the body and that is dependent upon being metabolized is a "drug," provided that it otherwise falls within the scope of the "drug" definition. And
one need not hypothesize about air conditioners or thermal

pajamas to recognize that the chemical nicotine, an impor-tant tobacco ingredient, meets this test.

Although I now oversimplify, the FDA has determinedthat once nicotine enters the body, the blood carries it almost
immediately to the brain. See 61 Fed. Reg. 44698-44699(1966). Nicotine then binds to receptors on the surface of
brain cells, setting off a series of chemical reactions that
alter one's mood and produce feelings of sedation and stimu-lation. See

id., at 44699, 44739. Nicotine also increases the
number of nicotinic receptors on the brain's surface, and al-ters its normal electrical activity. See

id., at 44739. And
nicotine stimulates the transmission of a natural chemical
that "rewards" the body with pleasurable sensations (dopamine), causing nicotine addiction. See id., at 44700, 44721-
44722. The upshot is that nicotine stabilizes mood, suppresses appetite, tranquilizes, and satisfies a physical craving
that nicotine itself has helped to create--all through chemical
action within the body after being metabolized.

This physiology--and not simply smoker psychology--
helps to explain why as many as 75% of adult smokers believe that smoking "reduce[s] nervous irritation," 60 Fed.
Reg. 41579 (1995); why 73% of young people (10- to 22-yearolds) who begin smoking say they do so for "relaxation," 61
Fed. Reg. 44814 (1996); and why less than 3% of smokers
succeed in quitting each year, although 70% want to quit, id.,
at 44704. That chemistry also helps to explain the Surgeon
General's findings that smokers believe "smoking [makes
them] feel better" and smoke more "in situations involving
negative mood." Id., at 44814. And, for present purposes,
that chemistry demonstrates that nicotine affects the "structure" and "function" of the body in a manner that is quite similar to the effects of other regulated substances. See id., at
44667 (FDA regulates Valium, NoDoz, weight-loss products).
Indeed, addiction, sedation, stimulation, and weight loss are
precisely the kinds of product effects that the FDA typically
reviews and controls. And, since the nicotine in cigarettes

plainly is not a "food," its chemical effects suffice to establishthat it is as a "drug" (and the cigarette that delivers it a

drug-delivery "device") for the purpose of the FDCA.

B
The tobacco companies' principal definitional argument fo-cuses upon the statutory word "intended." See 21 U. S. C.

$ 321(g)(1)(C). The companies say that "intended" in thiscontext is a term of art. See Brief for Respondent Brown &
Williamson Tobacco Corp. 2. They assert that the statutoryword "intended" means that the product's maker has made
an express claim about the effect that its product will haveon the body. Ibid. Indeed, according to the companies, the
FDA's inability to prove that cigarette manufacturers makesuch claims is precisely why that agency historically has said
it lacked the statutory power to regulate tobacco. See id.,at 19-20.

The FDCA, however, does not use the word "claimed"; ituses the word "intended." And the FDA long ago issued
regulations that say the relevant "intent" can be shown notonly by a manufacturer's "expressions," but also "by the circumstances surrounding the distribution of the article." 41Fed. Reg. 6896 (1976) (codified at 21 CFR $ 801.4 (1999)); see
also 41 Fed. Reg. 6896 (1976) ("objective intent" shown if"article is, with the knowledge [of its makers], offered and
used" for a particular purpose). Thus, even in the absenceof express claims, the FDA has regulated products that affect the body if the manufacturer wants, and knows, thatconsumers so use the product. See,

e. g., 60 Fed. Reg.41527-41531 (1995) (describing agency's regulation of topical

hormones, sunscreens, fluoride, tanning lamps, thyroid infood supplements, novelty condoms--all marketed without
express claims); see also 1 O'Reilly $ 13.04, at 13-15 ("Some-times the very nature of the material makes it a drug . . .").

either of "intended" or "intended use" suggests that an express claim (which often shows intent) is always necessary.Indeed, the primary statement to which the companies direct

our attention says only that a manufacturer can determinewhat kind of regulation applies--"food" or "drug"--because,
"through his representations in connection with its sale, [the
manufacturer] can determine" whether an article is to be
used as a "food," as a "drug," or as "both." S. Rep. No. 361,
74th Cong., 1st Sess., 4 (1935), reprinted in 3 Leg. Hist. 696.

Nor is the FDA's "objective intent" interpretation unreasonable. It falls well within the established scope of the
ordinary meaning of the word "intended." See Agnew v.
United States, 165 U. S. 36, 53 (1897) (intent encompasses the
known consequences of an act). And the companies acknowledge that the FDA can regulate a drug-like substance
in the ordinary circumstance, i. e., where the manufacturer
makes an express claim, so it is not unreasonable to conclude
that the agency retains such power where a product's effects
on the body are so well known (say, like those of aspirin or
calamine lotion), that there is no need for express representations because the product speaks for itself.

The companies also cannot deny that the evidence of their
intent is sufficient to satisfy the statutory word "intended"
as the FDA long has interpreted it. In the first place, there
was once a time when they actually did make express advertising claims regarding tobacco's mood-stabilizing and
weight-reducing properties--and historical representations
can portend present expectations. In the late 1920's, for
example, the American Tobacco Company urged weightconscious smokers to " `Reach for a Lucky instead of a

sweet.' " Kluger, Ashes to Ashes, at 77-78. The advertisements of R J Reynolds (RJR) emphasized mood stability by
depicting a pilot remarking that " `It Takes Steady Nerves
to Fly the Mail at Night . . . . That's why I smoke Camels.
And I smoke plenty!' " Id., at 86. RJR also advertised the
stimulating quality of cigarettes, stating in one instance that
" `You get a Lift with a Camel,' " and, in another, that Camels
are " `A Harmless Restoration of the Flow of Natural Body
Energy.' " Id., at 87. And claims of medical proof of mildness (and of other beneficial effects) once were commonplace.
See, e. g., id., at 93 (Brown & Williamson advertised Koolbrand mentholated cigarettes as "a tonic to hot, tired
throats"); id., at 101, 131 (Philip Morris contended that
" `[r]ecognized laboratory tests have conclusively proven the
advantage of Phillip [sic] Morris' "); id., at 88 (RJR proclaimed " `For Digestion's sake, smoke Camels! . . . Camels
make mealtime more pleasant--digestion is stimulated--alkalinity increased' "). Although in recent decades cigarette
manufacturers have stopped making express health claims in
their advertising, consumers have come to understand what
the companies no longer need to express--that through
chemical action cigarettes stabilize mood, sedate, stimulate,
and help suppress appetite.

Second, even though the companies refused to acknowledge publicly (until only very recently) that the nicotine in
cigarettes has chemically induced, and habit-forming, effects,
see, e. g., Regulation of Tobacco Products (Part 1): Hearings
before the House Subcommittee on Health and the Environment, 103d Cong., 2d Sess., 628 (1994) (hereinafter 1994
Hearings) (heads of seven major tobacco companies testified
under oath that they believed "nicotine is not addictive" (emphasis added)), the FDA recently has gained access to solid,
documentary evidence proving that cigarette manufacturers
have long known tobacco produces these effects within the
body through the metabolizing of chemicals, and that they

have long wanted their products to produce those effects inthis way.

For example, in 1972, a tobacco-industry scientist ex-plained that " `[s]moke is beyond question the most optimized
vehicle of nicotine,' " and " `the cigarette is the most opti-mized dispenser of smoke.' " 61 Fed. Reg. 44856 (1996)
(emphasis deleted). That same scientist urged companyexecutives to

" `[t]hink of the cigarette pack as a storage container fora day's supply of nicotine. . . . Think of the cigarette as
a dispenser for a dose unit of nicotine [and] [t]hink of apuff of smoke as the vehicle of nicotine.' "

Ibid. (PhilipMorris) (emphasis deleted).

That same year, other tobacco industry researchers toldtheir superiors that

" `in different situations and at different dose levels, nic-otine appears to act as a stimulant, depressant, tranquilizer, psychic energizer, appetite reducer, anti-fatigueagent, or energizer. . . . Therefore, [tobacco] products
may, in a sense, compete with a variety of other productswith certain types of drug action.' "

Id., at 44669 (RJR)(emphasis deleted).

A draft report prepared by authorities at Philip Morris saidthat nicotine

" `is a physiologically active, nitrogen containing sub-stance [similar to] quinine, cocaine, atropine and morphine. [And] [w]hile each of these [other] substancescan be used to affect human physiology, nicotine has
a particularly broad range of influence.' " Id., at44668-44669.

And a 1980 manufacturer's study stated that

With such evidence, the FDA has more than sufficiently

The majority nonetheless reaches the "inescapable conclu-sion" that the language and structure of the FDCA as a

whole "simply do not fit" the kind of public health problemthat tobacco creates.

Ante, at 143. That is because, in the
majority's view, the FDCA requires the FDA to ban outright"dangerous" drugs or devices (such as cigarettes); yet, the

FDA concedes that an immediate and total cigarette-sale banis inappropriate.

Ibid.
This argument is curious because it leads with similarly"inescapable" force to precisely the opposite conclusion,

namely, that the FDA does have jurisdiction but that it mustban cigarettes. More importantly, the argument fails to
take into account the fact that a statute interpreted as requiring the FDA to pick a more dangerous over a less dan-gerous remedy would be a perverse statute,

causing, rather
than preventing, unnecessary harm whenever a total ban islikely the more dangerous response. And one can at least

imagine such circumstances.Suppose, for example, that a commonly used, mildly addictive sleeping pill (or, say, a kind of popular contact lens),plainly within the FDA's jurisdiction, turned out to pose serious health risks for certain consumers. Suppose furtherthat many of those addicted consumers would ignore an immediate total ban, turning to a potentially more dangerous
black-market substitute, while a less draconian remedy (say,
adequate notice) would wean them gradually away to a safer
product. Would the FDCA still force the FDA to impose

dissenting
the more dangerous remedy? For the following reasons,I think not.

First, the statute's language does not restrict the FDA'sremedial powers in this way. The FDCA permits the FDA
to regulate a "combination product"--i. e., a "device" (suchas a cigarette) that contains a "drug" (such as nicotine)--
under its "device" provisions. 21 U. S. C. $ 353(g)(1). And
the FDCA's "device" provisions explicitly grant the FDAwide remedial discretion. For example, where the FDA

cannot "otherwise" obtain "reasonable assurance" of a de-vice's "safety and effectiveness," the agency may restrict by
regulation a product's "sale, distribution, or use" upon
"such . . . conditions as the Secretary may prescribe."

$ 360j(e)(1) (emphasis added). And the statutory section
that most clearly addresses the FDA's power to ban (entitled
"Banned devices") says that, where a device presents "an
unreasonable and substantial risk of illness or injury," the
Secretary "may"--not must--"initiate a proceeding . . . to
make such device a banned device." $ 360f(a) (emphasis
added).

The Court points to other statutory subsections which it
believes require the FDA to ban a drug or device entirely,
even where an outright ban risks more harm than other regulatory responses. See ante, at 135-136. But the cited
provisions do no such thing. It is true, as the majority contends, that "the FDCA requires the FDA to place all devices" in "one of three classifications" and that Class III devices require "premarket approval." Ante, at 136. But it
is not the case that the FDA must place cigarettes in Class
III because tobacco itself "presents a potential unreasonable
risk of illness or injury." 21 U. S. C. $ 360c(a)(1)(C). In fact,
Class III applies only where regulation cannot otherwise
"provide reasonable assurance of . . . safety." $$ 360c(a)
(1)(A), (B) (placing a device in Class I or Class II when regulation can provide that assurance). Thus, the statute plainly
allows the FDA to consider the relative, overall "safety" of

176 FDA v. BROWN & WILLIAMSON TOBACCO CORP.

dissenting
a device in light of its regulatory alternatives, and where the
FDA has chosen the least dangerous path, i. e., the safest
path, then it can--and does--provide a "reasonable assurance" of "safety" within the meaning of the statute. A good
football helmet provides a reasonable assurance of safety for
the player even if the sport itself is still dangerous. And the
safest regulatory choice by definition offers a "reasonable"
assurance of safety in a world where the other alternatives
are yet more dangerous.

In any event, it is not entirely clear from the statute's text
that a Class III categorization would require the FDA affirmatively to withdraw from the market dangerous devices,
such as cigarettes, which are already widely distributed.
See, e. g., $ 360f(a) (when a device presents an "unreasonable
and substantial risk of illness or injury," the Secretary "may"
make it "a banned device"); $ 360h(a) (when a device "presents an unreasonable risk of substantial harm to the
public health," the Secretary "may" require "notification");

$ 360h(b) (when a defective device creates an "unreasonable
risk" of harm, the Secretary "may" order "[r]epair, replacement, or refund"); cf. 2 O'Reilly $ 18.08, at 18-29 (point of
Class III "premarket approval" is to allow "careful scientific
review" of each "truly new" device "before it is exposed" to
users (emphasis added)).

Noting that the FDCA requires banning a "misbranded"
drug, the majority also points to 21 U. S. C. $ 352( j), which
deems a drug or device "misbranded" if "it is dangerous to
health when used" as "prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling." See ante, at 135. In addition, the
majority mentions $ 352(f)(1), which calls a drug or device
"misbranded" unless "its labeling bears . . . adequate directions for use" as "are necessary for the protection of users."
Ibid. But this "misbranding" language is not determinative, for it permits the FDA to conclude that a drug or device
is not "dangerous to health" and that it does have "adequate"

dissenting
directions when regulated so as to render it as harmless as
possible. And surely the agency can determine that a substance is comparatively "safe" (not "dangerous") whenever it
would be less dangerous to make the product available (subject to regulatory requirements) than suddenly to withdraw
it from the market. Any other interpretation risks substantial harm of the sort that my sleeping pill example illustrates. See supra, at 174-175. And nothing in the statute
prevents the agency from adopting a view of "safety" that
would avoid such harm. Indeed, the FDA already seems to
have taken this position when permitting distribution of
toxic drugs, such as poisons used for chemotherapy, that are
dangerous for the user but are not deemed "dangerous to
health" in the relevant sense. See 61 Fed. Reg. 44413 (1996).

The tobacco companies point to another statutory provision which says that if a device "would cause serious, adverse
health consequences or death, the Secretary shall issue" a
cease distribution order. 21 U. S. C. $ 360h(e)(1) (emphasis
added). But that word "shall" in this context cannot mean
that the Secretary must resort to the recall remedy whenever a device would have serious, adverse health effects.
Rather, that language must mean that the Secretary "shall
issue" a cease distribution order in compliance with the section's procedural requirements if the Secretary chooses in
her discretion to use that particular subsection's recall remedy. Otherwise, the subsection would trump and make
meaningless the same section's provision of other lesser remedies such as simple "notice" (which the Secretary similarly
can impose if, but only if, she finds that the device "presents
an unreasonable risk of substantial harm to the public").

$ 360h(a)(1). And reading the statute to compel the FDA to
"recall" every dangerous device likewise would conflict with
that same subsection's statement that the recall remedy
"shall be in addition to [the other] remedies provided" in the
statute. $ 360h(e)(3) (emphasis added).

dissenting
The statute's language, then, permits the agency to chooseremedies consistent with its basic purpose--the overall protection of public health.The second reason the FDCA does not require the FDA
to select the more dangerous remedy, see supra, at 175, isthat, despite the majority's assertions to the contrary, the
statute does not distinguish among the kinds of health effects that the agency may take into account when assessingsafety. The Court insists that the statute only permits the

agency to take into account the health risks and benefits ofthe "

product itself " as used by individual consumers, ante,
at 140, and, thus, that the FDA is prohibited from considering that a ban on smoking would lead many smokers to suffer
severe withdrawal symptoms or to buy possibly stronger,
more dangerous, black market cigarettes--considerations
that the majority calls "the aggregate health effects of alternative administrative actions." Ibid. But the FDCA
expressly permits the FDA to take account of comparative safety in precisely this manner. See, e. g., 21 U. S. C.

$ 360h(e)(2)(B)(i)(II) (no device recall if "risk of recal[l]" presents "a greater health risk than" no recall); $ 360h(a) (notification "unless" notification "would present a greater danger"
than "no such notification").

Moreover, one cannot distinguish in this context between
a "specific" health risk incurred by an individual and an "aggregate" risk to a group. All relevant risk is, at bottom,
risk to an individual; all relevant risk attaches to "the product itself "; and all relevant risk is "aggregate" in the sense
that the agency aggregates health effects in order to determine risk to the individual consumer. If unregulated smoking will kill 4 individuals out of a typical group of 1,000 people, if regulated smoking will kill 1 out of 1,000, and if a
smoking ban (because of the black market) will kill 2 out of
1,000; then these three possibilities mean that in each group
four, one, and two individuals, on average, will die respectively. And the risk to each individual consumer is 4/1,000,

529US1 Unit: $U36 [09-26-01 08:36:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN

179Cite as: 529 U. S. 120 (2000)
dissenting
1/1,000, and 2/1,000 respectively. A "specific" risk to an indi-vidual consumer and "aggregate" risks are two sides of the

same coin; each calls attention to the same set of facts.While there may be a theoretical distinction between the
risk of the product itself and the risk related to the presenceor absence of an intervening voluntary act (

e. g., the search
for a replacement on the black market), the majority does
not rely upon any such distinction, and the FDA's history ofregulating "replacement" drugs such as methadone shows

that it has long taken likely actual alternative consumer be-havior into account.

I concede that, as a matter of logic, one could consider the
FDA's "safety" evaluation to be different from its choice of
remedies. But to read the statute to forbid the agency from
taking account of the realities of consumer behavior either
in assessing safety or in choosing a remedy could increase
the risks of harm--doubling the risk of death to each "individual user" in my example above. Why would Congress
insist that the FDA ignore such realities, even if the consequent harm would occur only unusually, say, where the FDA
evaluates a product (a sleeping pill; a cigarette; a contact
lens) that is already on the market, potentially habit forming,
or popular? I can find no satisfactory answer to this question. And that, I imagine, is why the statute itself says
nothing about any of the distinctions that the Court has tried
to draw. See 21 U. S. C. $ 360c(a)(2) (instructing FDA to determine the safety and effectiveness of a "device" in part by
weighing "any probable benefit to health . . . against any
probable risk of injury or illness . . ." (emphasis added)).

Third, experience counsels against an overly rigid interpretation of the FDCA that is divorced from the statute's
overall health-protecting purposes. A different set of
words, added to the FDCA in 1958 by the Delaney Amendment, provides that "no [food] additive shall be deemed to
be safe if it is found [after appropriate tests] to induce cancer
when ingested by man or animal." $ 348(c)(3). The FDA

529US1 Unit: $U36 [09-26-01 08:36:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN

dissenting
once interpreted this language as requiring it to ban any foodadditive, no matter how small the amount, that appeared in

any food product if that additive was ever found to inducecancer in any animal, no matter how large a dose needed to
induce the appearance of a single carcinogenic cell. SeeH. R. Rep. No. 95-658, p. 7 (1977) (discussing agency's view).
The FDA believed that the statute's ban mandate was absolute and prevented it from establishing a level of "safe use"or even to judge whether "the benefits of continued use outweigh the risks involved." Id., at 5. This interpretation--which in principle could have required the ban of everything
from herbal teas to mushrooms--actually led the FDA to
ban saccharine, see 42 Fed. Reg. 19996 (1977), though this
extremely controversial regulatory response never took effect because Congress enacted, and has continually renewed,
a law postponing the ban. See Saccharin Study and Labeling Act, Pub. L. 95-203, $ 3, 91 Stat. 1452; e. g., Pub. L. 102-
142, Tit. VI, 105 Stat. 910.

The Court's interpretation of the statutory language before us risks Delaney-type consequences with even less linguistic reason. Even worse, the view the Court advances
undermines the FDCA's overall health-protecting purpose
by placing the FDA in the strange dilemma of either banning
completely a potentially dangerous drug or device or doing
nothing at all. Saying that I have misunderstood its conclusion, the majority maintains that the FDA "may clearly regulate many `dangerous' products without banning them."
Ante, at 142. But it then adds that the FDA must ban--
rather than otherwise regulate--a drug or device that "cannot be used safely for any therapeutic purpose." Ibid. If I
misunderstand, it is only because this linchpin of the majority's conclusion remains unexplained. Why must a widely
used but unsafe device be withdrawn from the market when
that particular remedy threatens the health of many and is
thus more dangerous than another regulatory response? It
is, indeed, a perverse interpretation that reads the FDCA

529US1 Unit: $U36 [09-26-01 08:36:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN

181Cite as: 529 U. S. 120 (2000)
dissenting
to require the ban of a device that has no "safe" thera-peutic purpose where a ban is the most dangerous remedial

alternative.In my view, where linguistically permissible, we should
interpret the FDCA in light of Congress' overall desire toprotect health. That purpose requires a flexible interpretation that both permits the FDA to take into account the real-ities of human behavior and allows it, in appropriate cases,
to choose from its arsenal of statutory remedies. A statuteso interpreted easily "fit[s]" this, and other, drug- and
device-related health problems.

III
In the majority's view, laws enacted since 1965 require usto deny jurisdiction, whatever the FDCA might mean in

their absence. But why? Do those laws contain languagebarring FDA jurisdiction? The majority must concede that
they do not. Do they contain provisions that are inconsist-ent with the FDA's exercise of jurisdiction? With one
exception, see infra, at 184-185, the majority points to nosuch provision. Do they somehow repeal the principles of
law (discussed in Part II, supra) that otherwise would leadto the conclusion that the FDA has jurisdiction in this area?
The companies themselves deny making any such claim.See Tr. of Oral Arg. 27 (denying reliance on doctrine of "partial repeal"). Perhaps the later laws "shape" and "focus"what the 1938 Congress meant a generation earlier.

Ante,at 143. But this Court has warned against using the views

of a later Congress to construe a statute enacted many yearsbefore. See Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation v. LTV
Corp., 496 U. S. 633, 650 (1990) (later history is a " `hazardousbasis for inferring the intent of an earlier' Congress" (quoting United States v. Price, 361 U. S. 304, 313 (1960))). And,while the majority suggests that the subsequent history
"control[s] our construction" of the FDCA, see ante, at 143(citation and internal quotation marks omitted), this Court

expressly has held that such subsequent views are not "con-trolling."

Haynes v. United States, 390 U. S. 85, 87-88, n. 4
(1968); accord, Southwestern Cable Co., 392 U. S., at 170 (suchviews have " `very little, if any, significance' "); see also

Sullivan v. Finkelstein, 496 U. S. 617, 632 (1990) (concurring) ("Arguments based on subsequent legislative

history . . . should not be taken seriously, not even in a
footnote").Regardless, the later statutes do not support the majority's conclusion. That is because, whatever individual Mem-bers of Congress after 1964 may have assumed about the
FDA's jurisdiction, the laws they enacted did not embody
any such "no jurisdiction" assumption. And one cannot automatically infer an antijurisdiction intent, as the majority
does, for the later statutes are both (and similarly) consistent
with quite a different congressional desire, namely, the intent to proceed without interfering with whatever authority
the FDA otherwise may have possessed. See, e. g., Cigarette Labeling and Advertising--1965: Hearings on H. R.
2248 et al. before the House Committee on Interstate and
Foreign Commerce, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., 19 (1965) (hereinafter 1965 Hearings) (statement of Rep. Fino that the proposed legislation would not "erode" agency authority). As
I demonstrate below, the subsequent legislative history is
critically ambivalent, for it can be read either as (a) "ratif[ying]" a no-jurisdiction assumption, see ante, at 158, or as
(b) leaving the jurisdictional question just where Congress
found it. And the fact that both inferences are "equally tenable," Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., supra, at 650 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); Johnson v.
Transportation Agency, Santa Clara Cty., 480 U. S. 616, 672
(1987) (Scalia, J., dissenting), prevents the majority from
drawing from the later statutes the firm, antijurisdiction implication that it needs.

Consider, for example, Congress' failure to provide the
FDA with express authority to regulate tobacco--a circum529US1 Unit: $U36 [09-26-01 08:36:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN

stance that the majority finds significant. See ante, at 144,147-148, 155. But cf.

Southwestern Cable Co., supra, at 170
(failed requests do not prove agency "did not already pos-sess" authority). In fact, Congress

both failed to grant express authority to the FDA when the FDA denied it hadjurisdiction over tobacco

and failed to take that authority
expressly away when the agency later asserted jurisdiction.
See, e. g., S. 1262, 104th Cong., 1st Sess., $ 906 (1995) (failedbill seeking to amend FDCA to say that "[n]othing in this

Act or any other Act shall provide the [FDA] with any au-thority to regulate in any manner tobacco or tobacco products"); see also H. R. 516, 105th Cong., 1st Sess., $ 2 (1997)
(similar); H. R. Res. 980, reprinted in 142 Cong. Rec. 5018
(1996) (Georgia legislators unsuccessfully requested that
Congress "rescind any action giving the FDA authority"
over tobacco); H. R. 2283, 104th Cong., 1st Sess. (1995) (failed
bill "[t]o prohibit the [FDA] regulation of the sale or use
of tobacco"); H. R. 2414, 104th Cong., 1st Sess., $ 2(a) (1995)
(similar). Consequently, the defeat of various different proposed jurisdictional changes proves nothing. This history
shows only that Congress could not muster the votes necessary either to grant or to deny the FDA the relevant authority. It neither favors nor disfavors the majority's position.

The majority also mentions the speed with which Congress acted to take jurisdiction away from other agencies
once they tried to assert it. See ante, at 145, 149-151. But
such a congressional response again proves nothing. On the
one hand, the speedy reply might suggest that Congress
somehow resented agency assertions of jurisdiction in an
area it desired to reserve for itself--a consideration that supports the majority. On the other hand, Congress' quick reaction with respect to other agencies' regulatory efforts contrasts dramatically with its failure to enact any responsive
law (at any speed) after the FDA asserted jurisdiction over
tobacco more than three years ago. And that contrast supports the opposite conclusion.

In addition, at least one post-1938 statute reveals quite a
different congressional intent than the majority infers. See
note following 21 U. S. C. $ 321 (1994 ed., Supp. III) (FDA
Modernization Act of 1997) (law "shall [not] be construed to
affect the question of whether the [FDA] has any authority
to regulate any tobacco product," and "[s]uch authority, if
any, shall be exercised under the [FDCA] as in effect on the
day before the date of [this] enactment"). Consequently, it
appears that the only interpretation that can reconcile all of
the subsequent statutes is the inference that Congress did
not intend, either explicitly or implicitly, for its later laws to
answer the question of the scope of the FDA's jurisdictional
authority. See 143 Cong. Rec. S8860 (Sept. 5, 1997) (the
Modernization Act will "not interfere or substantially negatively affect any of the FDA tobacco authority").

The majority's historical perspective also appears to be
shaped by language in the Federal Cigarette Labeling and
Advertising Act (FCLAA), 79 Stat. 282, 15 U. S. C. $ 1331
et seq. See ante, at 148-149. The FCLAA requires manufacturers to place on cigarette packages, etc., health warnings such as the following:

"SURGEON GENERAL'S WARNING: Smoking
Causes Lung Cancer, Heart Disease, Emphysema, And
May Complicate Pregnancy." 15 U. S. C. $ 1333(a).

The FCLAA has an express pre-emption provision which
says that "[n]o statement relating to smoking and health,
other than the statement required by [this Act], shall be required on any cigarette package." $ 1334(a). This preemption clause plainly prohibits the FDA from requiring on
"any cigarette package" any other "statement relating to
smoking and health," but no one contends that the FDA has
failed to abide by this prohibition. See, e. g., 61 Fed. Reg.
44399 (1996) (describing the other regulatory prescriptions).

This Court has already answered that question expresslyand in the negative. See

505 U. S. 504 (1992). Cipollone held that the FCLAA's pre-emption provision does not bar state or federal regulation

outside the provision's literal scope. Id., at 518. And it described the pre-emption provision as "merely prohibit[ing]state and federal rulemaking bodies from mandating particular cautionary statements on cigarette labels . . . ." Ibid.This negative answer is fully consistent with Congress' intentions in regard to the pre-emption language. When Congress enacted the FCLAA, it focused upon the regulatory
efforts of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), not the
FDA. See 1965 Hearings 1-2. And the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969, Pub. L. 91-222, $ 7(c), 84 Stat. 89,
expressly amended the FCLAA to provide that "[n]othing in
this Act shall be construed to affirm or deny the [FTC's]
holding that it has the authority to issue trade regulation
rules" for tobacco. See also H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 91-897,
p. 7 (1970) (statement of House Managers) (we have "no intention to resolve the question as to whether" the FTC could
regulate tobacco in a different way); see also 116 Cong. Rec.
7921 (1970) (statement of Rep. Satterfield) (same). Why
would one read the FCLAA's pre-emption clause--a provision that Congress intended to limit even in respect to the
agency directly at issue--so broadly that it would bar a different agency from engaging in any other cigarette regulation at all? The answer is that the Court need not, and
should not, do so. And, inasmuch as the Court already has
declined to view the FCLAA as pre-empting the entire field
of tobacco regulation, I cannot accept that that same law
bars the FDA's regulatory efforts here.

When the FCLAA's narrow pre-emption provision is set
aside, the majority's conclusion that Congress clearly intended for its tobacco-related statutes to be the exclusive

"response" to "the problem of tobacco and health," ante, at157, is based on legislative silence. Notwithstanding the

views voiced by various legislators, Congress itself has ad-dressed expressly the issue of the FDA's tobacco-related authority only once--and, as I have said, its statement was thatthe statute was not to "be construed to affect the question of
whether the [FDA] has any authority to regulate any tobaccoproduct." Note following 21 U. S. C. $ 321 (1994 ed., Supp.
III). The proper inference to be drawn from all of thepost-1965 statutes, then, is one that interprets Congress'
general legislative silence consistently with this statement.

I now turn to the final historical fact that the majorityviews as a factor in its interpretation of the subsequent legislative history: the FDA's former denials of its tobacco-related authority.

Until the early 1990's, the FDA expressly maintained thatthe 1938 statute did not give it the power that it now seeks
to assert. It then changed its mind. The majority agreeswith me that the FDA's change of positions does not make a
significant legal difference. See ante, at 156-157; see alsoChevron, 467 U. S., at 863 ("An initial agency interpretation
is not instantly carved in stone"); accord, Smiley v. Citibank
(South Dakota), N. A., 517 U. S. 735, 742 (1996) ("[C]hangeis not invalidating"). Nevertheless, it labels those denials

"important context" for drawing an inference about Con-gress' intent. Ante, at 157. In my view, the FDA's change
of policy, like the subsequent statutes themselves, does noth-ing to advance the majority's position.

When it denied jurisdiction to regulate cigarettes, theFDA consistently stated why that was so. In 1963, for
example, FDA administrators wrote that cigarettes did notsatisfy the relevant FDCA definitions--in particular, the
"intent" requirement--because cigarette makers did not selltheir product with accompanying "therapeutic claims."

Letter to Directors of Bureaus, Divisions and Directors ofDistricts from FDA Bureau of Enforcement (May 24, 1963),

in Public Health Cigarette Amendments of 1971: Hearingson S. 1454 before the Consumer Subcommittee of the Senate
Committee on Commerce, 92d Cong., 2d Sess., 240 (1972)(hereinafter FDA Enforcement Letter). And subsequent
FDA Commissioners made roughly the same assertion.
One pointed to the fact that the manufacturers only "recom-mended" cigarettes "for smoking pleasure." Two others reiterated the evidentiary need for "health claims." Yet an-other stressed the importance of proving "intent," adding
that "[w]e have not had sufficient evidence" of "intent with
regard to nicotine." See, respectively, id., at 239 (Comm'r
Edwards); Letter of Dec. 5, 1977, App. 47 (Comm'r Kennedy);
1965 Hearings 193 (Comm'r Rankin); 1994 Hearings 28
(Comm'r Kessler). Tobacco company counsel also testified
that the FDA lacked jurisdiction because jurisdiction "depends on . . . intended use," which in turn "depends, in
general, on the claims and representations made by the
manufacturer." Health Consequences of Smoking: Nicotine
Addiction, Hearing before the Subcommittee on Health and
the Environment of the House Committee on Energy and
Commerce, 100th Cong., 2d Sess., 288 (1988) (testimony of
Richard Cooper) (emphasis added).

Other agency statements occasionally referred to additional problems. Commissioner Kessler, for example, said
that the "enormous social consequences" flowing from a decision to regulate tobacco counseled in favor of obtaining specific congressional "guidance." 1994 Hearings 69; see also
ante, at 153 (quoting statement of Health and Human Services
Secretary Brandt to the effect that Congress wanted to make
the relevant jurisdictional decision). But a fair reading of
the FDA's denials suggests that the overwhelming problem
was one of proving the requisite manufacturer intent. See
Action on Smoking and Health v. Harris, 655 F. 2d 236, 238-
239 (CADC 1980) (FDA "comments" reveal its "understand529US1 Unit: $U36 [09-26-01 08:36:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ing" that "the crux of FDA jurisdiction over drugs layin manufacturers' representations as revelatory of their

intent").What changed? For one thing, the FDA obtained evidence sufficient to prove the necessary "intent" despitethe absence of specific "claims." See

supra, at 172-174.
This evidence, which first became available in the early
1990's, permitted the agency to demonstrate that the tobaccocompanies

knew nicotine achieved appetite-suppressing,
mood-stabilizing, and habituating effects through chemical(not psychological) means, even at a time when the companies were publicly denying such knowledge.

Moreover, scientific evidence of adverse health effects
mounted, until, in the late 1980's, a consensus on the seriousness of the matter became firm. That is not to say that concern about smoking's adverse health effects is a new phenomenon. See, e. g., Higginson, A New Counterblast, in
Out-door Papers 179, 194 (1863) (characterizing tobacco as
" `a narcotic poison of the most active class' "). It is to say,
however, that convincing epidemiological evidence began to
appear mid-20th century; that the first Surgeon General's
Report documenting the adverse health effects appeared in
1964; and that the Surgeon General's Report establishing nicotine's addictive effects appeared in 1988. At each stage,
the health conclusions were the subject of controversy, diminishing somewhat over time, until recently--and only recently--has it become clear that there is a wide consensus
about the health problem. See 61 Fed. Reg. 44701-44706
(1996).

Finally, administration policy changed. Earlier administrations may have hesitated to assert jurisdiction for the reasons prior Commissioners expressed. See supra, at 186-187
and this page. Commissioners of the current administration
simply took a different regulatory attitude.

Nothing in the law prevents the FDA from changing its
policy for such reasons. By the mid-1990's, the evidence

needed to prove objective intent--even without an expressclaim--had been found. The emerging scientific consensus

about tobacco's adverse, chemically induced, health effectsmay have convinced the agency that it should spend its resources on this important regulatory effort. As for thechange of administrations, I agree with thenJustice Rehn-
quist's statement in a different case, where he wrote:

"The agency's changed view . . . seems to be related tothe election of a new President of a different political

party. It is readily apparent that the responsible mem-bers of one administration may consider public resistance and uncertainties to be more important than dotheir counterparts in a previous administration. A
change in administration brought about by the peoplecasting their votes is a perfectly reasonable basis for an
executive agency's reappraisal of the costs and benefitsof its programs and regulations. As long as the agency
remains within the bounds established by Congress, itis entitled to assess administrative records and evaluate
priorities in light of the philosophy of the administra-tion." Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc.
v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463 U. S. 29, 59(1983) (concurring in part and dissenting in part).

V
One might nonetheless claim that, even if my interpreta-tion of the FDCA and later statutes gets the words right, it

lacks a sense of their "music." See Helvering v. Gregory, 69F. 2d 809, 810-811 (CA2 1934) (L. Hand, J.) ("[T]he meaning
of a [statute] may be more than that of the separate words,as a melody is more than the notes . . ."). Such a claim
might rest on either of two grounds.First, one might claim that, despite the FDA's legal right
to change its mind, its original statements played a criticalpart in the enactment of the later statutes and now should
play a critical part in their interpretation. But the FDA's

dissenting
traditional view was largely premised on a perceived inabil-ity to prove the necessary statutory "intent" requirement.

See, e. g., FDA Enforcement Letter 240 ("The statutory basisfor the exclusion of tobacco products from FDA's jurisdiction
is the fact that tobacco marketed for chewing or smokingwithout accompanying therapeutic claims, does not meet the
definitions . . . for food, drug, device or cosmetic"). The
statement, "we cannot assert jurisdiction over substance Xunless it is treated as a food," would not bar jurisdiction if

the agency later establishes that substance X is, and is in-tended to be, eaten. The FDA's denials of tobacco-related
authority sufficiently resemble this kind of statement that
they should not make the critical interpretive difference.

Second, one might claim that courts, when interpreting
statutes, should assume in close cases that a decision
with "enormous social consequences," 1994 Hearings 69,
should be made by democratically elected Members of Congress rather than by unelected agency administrators.
Cf. Kent v. Dulles, 357 U. S. 116, 129 (1958) (assuming Congress did not want to delegate the power to make rules interfering with exercise of basic human liberties). If there is
such a background canon of interpretation, however, I do not
believe it controls the outcome here.

Insofar as the decision to regulate tobacco reflects the policy of an administration, it is a decision for which that administration, and those politically elected officials who support
it, must (and will) take responsibility. And the very importance of the decision taken here, as well as its attendant publicity, means that the public is likely to be aware of it and to
hold those officials politically accountable. Presidents, just
like Members of Congress, are elected by the public. Indeed, the President and Vice President are the only public
officials whom the entire Nation elects. I do not believe that
an administrative agency decision of this magnitude--one
that is important, conspicuous, and controversial--can escape the kind of public scrutiny that is essential in any de529US1 Unit: $U36 [09-26-01 08:36:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN

mocracy. And such a review will take place whether it isthe Congress or the Executive Branch that makes the relevant decision. * * *

According to the FDA, only 2.5% of smokers successfullystop smoking each year, even though 70% say they want to
quit and 34% actually make an attempt to do so. See 61Fed. Reg. 44704 (1996) (citing Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, Cigarette Smoking Among Adults--UnitedStates, 1993; 43 Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 929
(Dec. 23, 1994)). The fact that only a handful of those whotry to quit smoking actually succeed illustrates a certain reality--the reality that the nicotine in cigarettes creates apowerful physiological addiction flowing from chemically induced changes in the brain. The FDA has found that themakers of cigarettes "intend" these physical effects. Hence,
nicotine is a "drug"; the cigarette that delivers nicotine tothe body is a "device"; and the FDCA's language, read in
light of its basic purpose, permits the FDA to assert thedisease-preventing jurisdiction that the agency now claims.

The majority finds that cigarettes are so dangerous thatthe FDCA would require them to be banned (a result the
majority believes Congress would not have desired); thus, itconcludes that the FDA has no tobacco-related authority. I
disagree that the statute would require a cigarette ban.But even if I am wrong about the ban, the statute would
restrict only the agency's choice of remedies, not itsjurisdiction.

The majority also believes that subsequently enacted stat-utes deprive the FDA of jurisdiction. But the later laws say
next to nothing about the FDA's tobacco-related authority.Previous FDA disclaimers of jurisdiction may have helped to
form the legislative atmosphere out of which Congress' owntobacco-specific statutes emerged. But a legislative atmosphere is not a law, unless it is embodied in a statutory wordor phrase. And the relevant words and phrases here reveal

nothing more than an intent not to change the jurisdictionalstatus quo.

The upshot is that the Court today holds that a regulatorystatute aimed at unsafe drugs and devices does not authorize
regulation of a drug (nicotine) and a device (a cigarette) thatthe Court itself finds unsafe. Far more than most, this particular drug and device risks the life-threatening harms thatadministrative regulation seeks to rectify. The majority's
conclusion is counterintuitive. And, for the reasons setforth, I believe that the law does not require it.

Consequently, I dissent.

CORTEZ BYRD CHIPS, INC. v. BILL HARBERTCONSTRUCTION CO., A DIVISION OF BILL

HARBERT INTERNATIONAL, INC.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eleventh circuit

No. 98-1960. Argued January 10, 2000--Decided March 21, 2000
Petitioner Cortez Byrd Chips, Inc., and respondent Bill Harbert Construction Company agreed, inter alia, that any disputes arising from Harbert's construction of a Mississippi mill for Cortez Byrd would be decided
by arbitration. When such a dispute arose, arbitration was conducted
in Alabama and Harbert received an award. Cortez Byrd sought to
vacate or modify the award in the Federal District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, where the contract was performed; and seven
days later Harbert sought to confirm the award in the Northern District
of Alabama. The latter court refused to dismiss, transfer, or stay its
action, concluding that venue was proper only there, and it entered judgment for Harbert. The Eleventh Circuit held that, under the Federal
Arbitration Act (FAA), venue for motions to confirm, vacate, or modify
awards was exclusively in the district where the arbitration award was
made, and thus venue here was limited to the Alabama court.

Held: The FAA's venue provisions are permissive, allowing a motion to

confirm, vacate, or modify to be brought either in the district where
the award was made or in any district proper under the general venue
statute. Pp. 197-204.

(a) Cortez Byrd's Mississippi motion was clearly proper as a diversity
action under the general venue statute, 28 U. S. C. $ 1391(a)(2), because
it was filed where the contract was performed. However, the FAA provides that upon motion of an arbitration party, the federal district court
where the arbitration award was made "may" vacate, 9 U. S. C. $ 10,
or "may" modify or correct, $ 11, the award. If these provisions are
restrictive, supplanting rather than supplementing the general venue
statute, there was no Mississippi venue for Cortez Byrd's action.
Owing to their contemporaneous enactment and similar language, $$ 10
and 11 are best analyzed together with $ 9, which permits parties to
select the venue for confirmation of an award and provides that, in the
absence of an agreement, venue lies in the federal court for the district
where the award was made. Pp. 197-198.

(b) Parsing the language of $$ 9-11 does not answer the question
whether the provisions are restrictive or permissive, for there is lan529US1 Unit: $U37 [09-26-01 08:37:33] PAGES PGT: OPIN

guage supporting both views. However, the history and function of the
provisions confirm that they were meant to expand, not limit, venue
choice. The FAA was enacted in 1925 against the backdrop of a considerably more restrictive general venue statute than today's. The 1925
general venue statute effectively limited civil suits to the district where
the defendant resided, and courts did not favor forum selection clauses.
The FAA's venue provisions had an obviously liberalizing effect, undiminished by any suggestion that Congress meant simultaneously to
foreclose a suit where the defendant resided. That is normally a defendant's most convenient forum, and it would take a very powerful
reason ever to suggest that Congress meant to eliminate such a venue
for postarbitration disputes. This view is confirmed by the obviously
liberalizing $ 9, which permits forum selection agreements. Were $$ 10
and 11 construed restrictively, a proceeding to confirm an award begun
in a selected forum would be held in abeyance while an objecting party
returned to the district of arbitration to modify or vacate the award.
Were that action unsuccessful, the parties would then return to the previously selected forum for the confirming order originally sought.
Nothing could be more clearly at odds with the FAA's policy of rapid
and unobstructed enforcement of arbitration agreements or with the
desired flexibility of parties in choosing an arbitration site. A restrictive interpretation would also place $ 3--which permits a court to stay
a proceeding referable to arbitration pending such arbitration--and

$$ 9-11 in needless tension, for a court with the power to stay an action
under $ 3 also has the power to confirm any ensuing arbitration award,
Marine Transit Corp. v. Dreyfus, 284 U. S. 263, 275-276. Harbert's
interpretation would also create anomalous results in the aftermath of
arbitrations held abroad. Against this reasoning, specific to the FAA's
history and function, Harbert's citations to cases construing other special venue provisions as restrictive, see, e. g., Fourco Glass Co. v. Transmirra Products Corp., 353 U. S. 222, 227-228, are beside the point.
Their authority is not that special venue statutes are restrictive, but
that analysis of special venue provisions must be specific to the statute
in question. Pp. 198-204.

her on the brief was Edward P. Meyerson.

Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case raises the issue whether the venue provisions of
the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA or Act), 9 U. S. C. $$ 9-11,
are restrictive, allowing a motion to confirm, vacate, or modify an arbitration award to be brought only in the district in
which the award was made, or are permissive, permitting
such a motion either where the award was made or in any
district proper under the general venue statute. We hold
the FAA provisions permissive.

Petitioner Cortez Byrd Chips, Inc., and respondent Bill
Harbert Construction Company agreed that Harbert would
build a wood chip mill for Cortez Byrd in Brookhaven, Mississippi. One of the terms was that "[a]ll claims or disputes
between the Contractor and the Owner arising out [of] or
relating to the Contract, or the breach thereof, shall be decided by arbitration in accordance with the Construction Industry Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association currently in effect unless the parties mutually agree
otherwise." App. 52. The agreement went on to provide
that "[t]he award rendered by the arbitrator or arbitrators
shall be final, and judgement may be entered upon it in accordance with applicable law in any court having jurisdiction
thereof," ibid.; that the agreement to arbitrate "shall be specifically enforceable under applicable law in any court having
jurisdiction thereof," ibid.; and that the law of the place
where the project was located, Mississippi, governed, id., at
60; 169 F. 3d 693, 694 (CA11 1999).

After a dispute arose, Harbert invoked the agreement by
a filing with the Atlanta office of the American Arbitration
Association, which conducted arbitration in November 1997

in Birmingham, Alabama. The next month, the arbitrationpanel issued an award in favor of Harbert.

Ibid.
In January 1998, Cortez Byrd filed a complaint in theUnited States District Court for the Southern District of

Mississippi seeking to vacate or modify the arbitrationaward, which Harbert then sought to confirm by filing this
action seven days later in the Northern District of Alabama.
When Cortez Byrd moved to dismiss, transfer, or stay theAlabama action, the Alabama District Court denied the motion, concluding that venue was proper only in the NorthernDistrict of Alabama, and entering judgment for Harbert for
$274,256.90 plus interest and costs. Ibid.

The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed.
It held itself bound by pre-1981 Fifth Circuit precedent,
cf. Bonner v. Prichard, 661 F. 2d 1206, 1209 (CA11 1981), to
the effect that under the Act's venue provisions, 9 U. S. C.

$$ 9-11, venue for motions to confirm, vacate, or modify
awards was exclusively in the district in which the arbitration award was made. 169 F. 3d, at 694; Naples v. Prepakt
Concrete Co., 490 F. 2d 182, 184 (CA5), cert. denied, 419 U. S.
843 (1974). The arbitration here having been held in Birmingham, the rule as so construed limited venue to the
Northern District of Alabama.

Section 9 of the FAA governs venue for the confirmationof arbitration awards:

"If the parties in their agreement have agreed that ajudgment of the court shall be entered upon the award
made pursuant to the arbitration, and shall specify thecourt, then at any time within one year after the award
is made any party to the arbitration may apply to thecourt so specified for an order confirming the award, and
thereupon the court must grant such an order unless theaward is vacated, modified, or corrected as prescribed in
sections 10 and 11 of this title. If no court is specifiedin the agreement of the parties, then such application
may be made to the United States court in and for thedistrict within which such award was made." 9 U. S. C.

correcting the award upon the application of any partyto the arbitration."

The precise issue raised in the District Court was whethervenue for Cortez Byrd's motion under $$ 10 and 11 was properly laid in the southern district of Mississippi, within whichthe contract was performed. It was clearly proper under
the general venue statute, which provides, among otherthings, for venue in a diversity action in "a judicial district
in which a substantial part of the events or omissions givingrise to the claim occurred, or a substantial part of property
that is the subject of the action is situated." 28 U. S. C.$ 1391(a)(2). If $$ 10 and 11 are permissive and thus supplement, but do not supplant, the general provision, CortezByrd's motion to vacate or modify was properly filed in Mississippi, and under principles of deference to the court of firstfiling, the Alabama court should have considered staying its
hand. Cf. Kerotest Mfg. Co. v. C-O-Two Fire Equipment Co.,342 U. S. 180, 185 (1952);

Landis v. North American Co., 299U. S. 248, 254 (1936); 5A C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure $ 1360 (1990). But if $$ 10 and 11 arerestrictive, there was no Mississippi venue for Cortez Byrd's
action, and the Northern District of Alabama correctly pro-ceeded with the litigation to confirm. Although $ 9 is not
directly implicated in this action, since venue for Harbert'smotion to confirm was proper in the northern district of Alabama under either a restrictive or a permissive reading of$ 9, the three venue sections of the FAA are best analyzed
together, owing to their contemporaneous enactment and thesimilarity of their pertinent language.

Enlightenment will not come merely from parsing the lan-guage, which is less clear than either party contends. Although "may" could be read as permissive in each section, asCortez Byrd argues, the mere use of "may" is not necessarily
conclusive of congressional intent to provide for a permissiveor discretionary authority.

United States v. Rodgers, 461U. S. 677, 706 (1983) ("The word `may,' when used in a stat529US1 Unit: $U37 [09-26-01 08:37:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN

defeated by indications of legislative intent to the contraryor by obvious inferences from the structure and purpose of

the Act as some indication that "may" was used in a permis-sive sense, cf. 9 U. S. C. $$ 2, 12, Harbert calls attention to a
contrary clue in even more obviously permissive languageelsewhere in the Act. See $ 4 ("A party aggrieved by the
alleged failure, neglect, or refusal of another to arbitrateunder a written agreement for arbitration may petition any
United States district court which, save for such agreement,would have jurisdiction under title 28 . . ."

1). Each party

has a point, but neither point is conclusive. The answer isnot to be had from comparing phrases.

Statutory history provides a better lesson, though, whichis confirmed by following out the practical consequences of
Harbert's position. When the FAA was enacted in 1925, itappeared against the backdrop of a considerably more restrictive general venue statute than the one current today.At the time, the practical effect of 28 U. S. C. $ 112(a) was
that a civil suit could usually be brought only in the districtin which the defendant resided. See 28 U. S. C. $ 112(a)
(1926 ed.).2 The statute's restrictive application was all the

than Title 28. See United States Arbitration Act, 43 Stat. 883.

2 "[E]xcept as provided in sections 113 to 118 of this title, no civil suit

shall be brought in any district court against any person by any original
process or proceeding in any other district than that whereof he is an
inhabitant; but where the jurisdiction is founded only on the fact that the
action is between citizens of different States, suit shall be brought only in
the district of the residence of either the plaintiff or the defendant." 28
U. S. C. $ 112(a) (1926 ed.). The provision allowing suits in a diversity
action in the district in which the plaintiff resided was of limited effect,

more pronounced due to the courts' general inhospitality toforum selection clauses, see The Bremen v. Zapata Off-Shore

Co., 407 U. S. 1, 9-10 (1972). Hence, even if an arbitrationagreement expressly permitted action to be brought in the
district in which arbitration had been conducted, the agree-ment would probably prove to be vain. The enactment of
the special venue provisions in the FAA thus had an obvi-ously liberalizing effect, undiminished by any suggestion,
textual or otherwise, that Congress meant simultaneously toforeclose a suit where the defendant resided. Such a consequence would have been as inexplicable in 1925 as it wouldbe passing strange 75 years later. The most convenient
forum for a defendant is normally the forum of residence,and it would take a very powerful reason ever to suggest
that Congress would have meant to eliminate that venue forpostarbitration disputes.

The virtue of the liberalizing nonrestrictive view of theprovisions for venue in the district of arbitration is confirmed
by another obviously liberalizing venue provision of the Act,which in $ 9 authorizes a binding agreement selecting a
forum for confirming an arbitration award. Since any forumselection agreement must coexist with $$ 10 and 11, one
needs to ask how they would work together if $$ 10 and 11meant that an order vacating or modifying an arbitration
award could be obtained only in the district where the awardwas made. The consequence would be that a proceeding to
confirm the award begun in a forum previously selected byagreement of the parties (but outside the district of the arbitration) would need to be held in abeyance if the respondingparty objected. The objecting party would then have to return to the district of the arbitration to begin a separate
as restrictive views of personal jurisdiction meant that it was often difficult to sue a defendant outside the district of his residence. Cf. International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U. S. 310, 316 (1945) (requiring that a
defendant have minimum contacts with a forum to be subject to its
judgment).

Opinion of the Court
proceeding to modify or vacate the arbitration award, and ifthe award withstood attack, the parties would move back

to the previously selected forum for the confirming orderoriginally sought. Harbert, naturally, is far from endorsing
anything of the sort and contends that a court with venue toconfirm under a $ 9 forum selection clause would also have
venue under a later filed motion under $ 10. But the contention boils down to denying the logic of Harbert's own posi-tion. The regime we have described would follow from

adopting that position, and the Congress simply cannot betagged with such a taste for the bizarre.

Nothing, indeed, would be more clearly at odds with both
the FAA's "statutory policy of rapid and unobstructed enforcement of arbitration agreements," Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U. S. 1, 23 (1983),
or with the desired flexibility of parties in choosing a site for
arbitration. Although the location of the arbitration may
well be the residence of one of the parties, or have some
other connection to a contract at issue, in many cases the
site will have no relation whatsoever to the parties or the
dispute. The parties may be willing to arbitrate in an inconvenient forum, say, for the convenience of the arbitrators, or
to get a panel with special knowledge or experience, or as
part of some compromise, but they might well be less willing
to pick such a location if any future court proceedings had to
be held there. Flexibility to make such practical choices,
then, could well be inhibited by a venue rule mandating the
same inconvenient venue if someone later sought to vacate
or modify the award.

A restrictive interpretation would also place $ 3 and

$$ 9-11 of the FAA in needless tension, which could be resolved only by disrupting existing precedent of this Court.
Section 3 provides that any court in which an action "referable to arbitration under an agreement in writing" is pending "shall on application of one of the parties stay the trial
of the action until such arbitration has been had in accord529US1 Unit: $U37 [09-26-01 08:37:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ance with the terms of the agreement." 9 U. S. C. $ 3. Ifan arbitration were then held outside the district of that litigation, under a restrictive reading of $$ 9-11 a subsequentproceeding to confirm, modify, or set aside the arbitration
award could not be brought in the district of the originallitigation (unless that also happened to be the chosen venue
in a forum selection agreement). We have, however, pre-viously held that the court with the power to stay the action
under $ 3 has the further power to confirm any ensuing arbi-tration award.

Marine Transit Corp. v. Dreyfus, 284 U. S.263, 275-276 (1932) ("We do not conceive it to be open to

question that, where the court has authority under thestatute . . . to make an order for arbitration, the court also
has authority to confirm the award or to set it aside for irreg-ularity, fraud, ultra vires or other defect"). Harbert in effect concedes this point, acknowledging that "the court en-tering a stay order under $ 3 retains jurisdiction over the
proceeding and does not `lose venue.' " Brief for Respond-ent 29. But that concession saving our precedent still fails
to explain why Congress would have wanted to allow venueliberally where motions to confirm, vacate, or modify were
brought as subsequent stages of actions antedating the arbitration, but would have wanted a different rule when arbi-tration was not preceded by a suit between the parties.

Finally, Harbert's interpretation would create anomalousresults in the aftermath of arbitrations held abroad. Sections 204, 207, and 302 of the FAA together provide forliberal choice of venue for actions to confirm awards subject
to the 1958 Convention on the Recognition and Enforcementof Foreign Arbitral Awards and the 1975 Inter-American
Convention on International Commercial Arbitration.3 9

3 Section 204 provides for venue in actions under the Convention on the
Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards "in any such
court in which save for the arbitration agreement an action or proceeding
with respect to the controversy . . . could be brought, or in such court
for the district and division which embraces the place designated in the
agreement as the place of arbitration." Section 207 states that "any party

Opinion of the Court
U. S. C. $$ 204, 207, 302. But reading $$ 9-11 to restrictvenue to the site of the arbitration would preclude any action

under the FAA in courts of the United States to confirm,modify, or vacate awards rendered in foreign arbitrations not
covered by either convention. Cf. 4 I. MacNeil, R. Speidel,& T. Stipanowich, Federal Arbitration Law $ 44.9.1.8 (1995)
(discussing difficulties in enforcing foreign arbitrations heldin nonsignatory states). Although such actions would not
necessarily be barred for lack of jurisdiction, they would bedefeated by restrictions on venue, and anomalies like that
are to be avoided when they can be. True, "[t]here havebeen, and perhaps there still are, occasional gaps in the
venue laws, [but] Congress does not in general intend to cre-ate venue gaps, which take away with one hand what Congress has given by way of jurisdictional grant with the other.Thus, in construing venue statutes it is reasonable to prefer
the construction that avoids leaving such a gap." Brunette
Machine Works, Ltd. v. Kockum Industries, Inc., 406 U. S.706, 710, n. 8 (1972); cf.

Scherk v. Alberto-Culver Co., 417U. S. 506, 516-517 (1974) (noting that "[a] contractual provision specifying in advance the forum in which disputes shallbe litigated and the law to be applied is . . . an almost indispensable precondition to achievement of the orderliness andpredictability essential to any international business transaction," and that "[a] parochial refusal by the courts of onecountry to enforce an international arbitration agreement
would not only frustrate these purposes, but would inviteunseemly and mutually destructive jockeying by the parties
to secure tactical litigation advantages").Attention to practical consequences thus points away from
the restrictive reading of $$ 9-11 and confirms the view thatthe liberalizing effect of the provisions in the day of their
enactment was meant to endure through treating them as
to the arbitration may apply to any court having jurisdiction under this
chapter for an order confirming the award." Section 302 applies these
provisions to actions brought under the Inter-American Convention. Sections 204 and 207 were added to the FAA in 1970; $ 302 was added in 1990.

permitting, not limiting, venue choice today. As against thisreasoning, specific to the history and function of a statute

addressing venue where arbitration is concerned, Harbert'scitations of cases construing other special venue provisions
are beside the point. We found, for example, that Congresshad a restrictive intent as to venue in patent cases, see
Fourco Glass Co. v. Transmirra Products Corp., 353 U. S.222, 227-228 (1957);

Stonite Products Co. v. Melvin LloydCo., 315 U. S. 561, 565-566 (1942), a restrictive intent for the

sake of protecting national banks when dealing with venuefor litigation against them, see Citizens & Southern Nat.
Bank v. Bougas, 434 U. S., at 44, and a restrictive intent asto the geographic reach of Title VII, as evidenced by the lack
of extraterritorial venue and other enforcement mechanismsin the statute, see EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co., 499
U. S. 244, 256 (1991). But the authority of these cases is notthat special venue statutes are deemed to be restrictive; they
simply show that analysis of special venue provisions mustbe specific to the statute. With that we agree in holding the
permissive view of FAA venue provisions entitled to prevail.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and
the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent withthis opinion.

It is so ordered.

WAL-MART STORES, INC. v. SAMARA BROTHERS,INC.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe second circuit

No. 99-150. Argued January 19, 2000--Decided March 22, 2000
Respondent Samara Brothers, Inc., designs and manufactures a line of

children's clothing. Petitioner Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., contracted with a
supplier to manufacture outfits based on photographs of Samara garments. After discovering that Wal-Mart and other retailers were selling the so-called knockoffs, Samara brought this action for, inter alia,
infringement of unregistered trade dress under $ 43(a) of the Trademark
Act of 1946 (Lanham Act). The jury found for Samara. Wal-Mart then
renewed a motion for judgment as a matter of law, claiming that there
was insufficient evidence to support a conclusion that Samara's clothing
designs could be legally protected as distinctive trade dress for purposes of $ 43(a). The District Court denied the motion and awarded
Samara relief. The Second Circuit affirmed the denial of the motion.

Held: In a $ 43(a) action for infringement of unregistered trade dress, a

product's design is distinctive, and therefore protectible, only upon a
showing of secondary meaning. Pp. 209-216.

(a) In addition to protecting registered trademarks, the Lanham Act,
in $ 43(a), gives a producer a cause of action for the use by any person
of "any . . . symbo[l] or device . . . likely to cause confusion . . . as to the
origin . . . of his or her goods." The breadth of the confusion-producing
elements actionable under $ 43(a) has been held to embrace not just
word marks and symbol marks, but also "trade dress"--a category that
originally included only the packaging, or "dressing," of a product, but
in recent years has been expanded by many Courts of Appeals to encompass the product's design. These courts have correctly assumed that
trade dress constitutes a "symbol" or "device" for Lanham Act purposes.
Although $ 43(a) does not explicitly require a producer to show that its
trade dress is distinctive, courts have universally imposed that requirement, since without distinctiveness the trade dress would not "cause
confusion . . . as to . . . origin," as $ 43(a) requires. In evaluating distinctiveness, courts have differentiated between marks that are inherently
distinctive--i. e., marks whose intrinsic nature serves to identify their
particular source--and marks that have acquired distinctiveness
through secondary meaning--i. e., marks whose primary significance,
in the minds of the public, is to identify the product's source rather than

Syllabus
the product itself. This Court has held, however, that applications of
at least one category of mark--color--can never be inherently distinctive, although they can be protected upon a showing of secondary meaning. Qualitex Co. v. Jacobson Products Co., 514 U. S. 159, 162-163.
Pp. 209-212.

(b) Design, like color, is not inherently distinctive. The attribution
of inherent distinctiveness to certain categories of word marks and
product packaging derives from the fact that the very purpose of attaching a particular word to a product, or encasing it in a distinctive package, is most often to identify the product's source. Where it is not
reasonable to assume consumer predisposition to take an affixed word
or packaging as indication of source, inherent distinctiveness will not be
found. With product design, as with color, consumers are aware of the
reality that, almost invariably, that feature is intended not to identify
the source, but to render the product itself more useful or more appealing. Pp. 212-214.

(c) Two Pesos, Inc. v. Taco Cabana, Inc., 505 U. S. 763, does not foreclose the Court's conclusion, since the trade dress there at issue was
restaurant de'cor, which does not constitute product design, but rather
product packaging or else some tertium quid that is akin to product
packaging and has no bearing on the present case. While distinguishing Two Pesos might force courts to draw difficult lines between
product-design and product-packaging trade dress, the frequency and
difficulty of having to distinguish between the two will be much less
than the frequency and difficulty of having to decide when a product design is inherently distinctive. To the extent there are close
cases, courts should err on the side of caution and classify ambiguous
trade dress as product design, thereby requiring secondary meaning.
Pp. 214-215.

only minor modifications, 16 of Samara's garments, many of
which contained copyrighted elements. In 1996, Wal-Mart
briskly sold the so-called knockoffs, generating more than
$1.15 million in gross profits.

In June 1996, a buyer for JCPenney called a representative
at Samara to complain that she had seen Samara garments
on sale at Wal-Mart for a lower price than JCPenney was
allowed to charge under its contract with Samara. The
Samara representative told the buyer that Samara did not
supply its clothing to Wal-Mart. Their suspicions aroused,
however, Samara officials launched an investigation, which
disclosed that Wal-Mart and several other major retailers--
Kmart, Caldor, Hills, and Goody's--were selling the knockoffs of Samara's outfits produced by Judy-Philippine.

After sending cease-and-desist letters, Samara brought
this action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Wal-Mart, Judy-Philippine,
Kmart, Caldor, Hills, and Goody's for copyright infringement
under federal law, consumer fraud and unfair competition
under New York law, and--most relevant for our purposes--
infringement of unregistered trade dress under $ 43(a) of

the Lanham Act, 15 U. S. C. $ 1125(a). All of the defendants
except Wal-Mart settled before trial.

After a weeklong trial, the jury found in favor of Samara
on all of its claims. Wal-Mart then renewed a motion for
judgment as a matter of law, claiming, inter alia, that there
was insufficient evidence to support a conclusion that Samara's clothing designs could be legally protected as distinctive
trade dress for purposes of $ 43(a). The District Court denied the motion, 969 F. Supp. 895 (SDNY 1997), and awarded
Samara damages, interest, costs, and fees totaling almost
$1.6 million, together with injunctive relief, see App. to Pet.
for Cert. 56-58. The Second Circuit affirmed the denial of
the motion for judgment as a matter of law, 165 F. 3d 120

Opinion of the Court

II
The Lanham Act provides for the registration of trade-marks, which it defines in $ 45 to include "any word, name,

symbol, or device, or any combination thereof [used or in-tended to be used] to identify and distinguish [a producer's]
goods . . . from those manufactured or sold by others and toindicate the source of the goods . . . ." 15 U. S. C. $ 1127.
Registration of a mark under $ 2 of the Lanham Act, 15U. S. C. $ 1052, enables the owner to sue an infringer under

$ 32, 15 U. S. C. $ 1114; it also entitles the owner to a pre-sumption that its mark is valid, see $ 7(b), 15 U. S. C.

$ 1057(b), and ordinarily renders the registered mark incon-testable after five years of continuous use, see $ 15, 15
U. S. C. $ 1065. In addition to protecting registered marks,the Lanham Act, in $ 43(a), gives a producer a cause of action
for the use by any person of "any word, term, name, symbol,or device, or any combination thereof . . . which . . . is likely
to cause confusion . . . as to the origin, sponsorship, or ap-proval of his or her goods . . . ." 15 U. S. C. $ 1125(a). It is
the latter provision that is at issue in this case.The breadth of the definition of marks registrable under

$ 2, and of the confusion-producing elements recited as ac-tionable by $ 43(a), has been held to embrace not just word
marks, such as "Nike," and symbol marks, such as Nike's"swoosh" symbol, but also "trade dress"--a category that
originally included only the packaging, or "dressing," of aproduct, but in recent years has been expanded by many
Courts of Appeals to encompass the design of a product.See,

e. g., Ashley Furniture Industries, Inc. v. SangiacomoN. A., Ltd., 187 F. 3d 363 (CA4 1999) (bedroom furniture);

Knitwaves, Inc. v. Lollytogs, Ltd., 71 F. 3d 996 (CA2 1995)(sweaters); Stuart Hall Co., Inc. v. Ampad Corp., 51 F. 3d 780
(CA8 1995) (notebooks). These courts have assumed, oftenwithout discussion, that trade dress constitutes a "symbol"
or "device" for purposes of the relevant sections, and we con-clude likewise. "Since human beings might use as a `symbol'

or `device' almost anything at all that is capable of carryingmeaning, this language, read literally, is not restrictive."

Qualitex Co. v. Jacobson Products Co., 514 U. S. 159, 162(1995). This reading of $ 2 and $ 43(a) is buttressed by a
recently added subsection of $ 43(a), $ 43(a)(3), which refersspecifically to "civil action[s] for trade dress infringement
under this chapter for trade dress not registered on the principal register." 15 U. S. C. $ 1125(a)(3) (1994 ed., Supp. V).The text of $ 43(a) provides little guidance as to the

circumstances under which unregistered trade dress maybe protected. It does require that a producer show that
the allegedly infringing feature is not "functional," see $ 43
(a)(3), and is likely to cause confusion with the product
for which protection is sought, see $ 43(a)(1)(A), 15 U. S. C.

$ 1125(a)(1)(A). Nothing in $ 43(a) explicitly requires a producer to show that its trade dress is distinctive, but courts
have universally imposed that requirement, since without
distinctiveness the trade dress would not "cause confusion
. . . as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of [the] goods,"
as the section requires. Distinctiveness is, moreover, an
explicit prerequisite for registration of trade dress under

$ 2, and "the general principles qualifying a mark for registration under $ 2 of the Lanham Act are for the most part
applicable in determining whether an unregistered mark

is entitled to protection under $ 43(a)." Two Pesos, Inc.
v. Taco Cabana, Inc., 505 U. S. 763, 768 (1992) (citations
omitted).

In evaluating the distinctiveness of a mark under $ 2 (and
therefore, by analogy, under $ 43(a)), courts have held that a
mark can be distinctive in one of two ways. First, a mark
is inherently distinctive if "[its] intrinsic nature serves to
identify a particular source." Ibid. In the context of word
marks, courts have applied the now-classic test originally
formulated by Judge Friendly, in which word marks that are
"arbitrary" ("Camel" cigarettes), "fanciful" ("Kodak" film), or
"suggestive" ("Tide" laundry detergent) are held to be inher529US1 Unit: $U38 [09-26-01 08:44:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
ently distinctive. See Abercrombie & Fitch Co. v. HuntingWorld, Inc., 537 F. 2d 4, 10-11 (CA2 1976). Second, a mark

has acquired distinctiveness, even if it is not inherently dis-tinctive, if it has developed secondary meaning, which occurs
when, "in the minds of the public, the primary significanceof a [mark] is to identify the source of the product rather
than the product itself." Inwood Laboratories, Inc. v. Ives
Laboratories, Inc., 456 U. S. 844, 851, n. 11 (1982).*The judicial differentiation between marks that are inherently distinctive and those that have developed secondarymeaning has solid foundation in the statute itself. Section 2
requires that registration be granted to any trademark "bywhich the goods of the applicant may be distinguished from
the goods of others"--subject to various limited exceptions.15 U. S. C. $ 1052. It also provides, again with limited exceptions, that "nothing in this chapter shall prevent the reg-istration of a mark used by the applicant which has become
distinctive of the applicant's goods in commerce"--that is,which is not inherently distinctive but has become so only
through secondary meaning. $ 2(f), 15 U. S. C. $ 1052(f).Nothing in $ 2, however, demands the conclusion that

everycategory of mark necessarily includes some marks "by which

the goods of the applicant may be distinguished from thegoods of others" without secondary meaning--that in every
category some marks are inherently distinctive.Indeed, with respect to at least one category of mark--
colors--we have held that no mark can ever be inherentlydistinctive. See Qualitex, supra, at 162-163. In Qualitex,

*The phrase "secondary meaning" originally arose in the context of
word marks, where it served to distinguish the source-identifying meaning
from the ordinary, or "primary," meaning of the word. "Secondary meaning" has since come to refer to the acquired, source-identifying meaning
of a nonword mark as well. It is often a misnomer in that context, since
nonword marks ordinarily have no "primary" meaning. Clarity might
well be served by using the term "acquired meaning" in both the wordmark and the nonword-mark contexts--but in this opinion we follow what
has become the conventional terminology.

petitioner manufactured and sold green-gold dry-cleaningpress pads. After respondent began selling pads of a similar color, petitioner brought suit under $ 43(a), then addeda claim under $ 32 after obtaining registration for the
color of its pads. We held that a color could be protectedas a trademark, but only upon a showing of secondary meaning. Reasoning by analogy to the Abercrombie & Fitch test
developed for word marks, we noted that a product's color isunlike a "fanciful," "arbitrary," or "suggestive" mark, since

it does not "almost automatically tell a customer that [it]refer[s] to a brand," 514 U. S., at 162-163, and does not
"immediately . . . signal a brand or a product `source,' " id.,
at 163. However, we noted that, "over time, customers
may come to treat a particular color on a product or its
packaging . . . as signifying a brand." Ibid. Because a
color, like a "descriptive" word mark, could eventually "come
to indicate a product's origin," we concluded that it could be
protected upon a showing of secondary meaning. Ibid.

It seems to us that design, like color, is not inherently
distinctive. The attribution of inherent distinctiveness to
certain categories of word marks and product packaging
derives from the fact that the very purpose of attaching a
particular word to a product, or encasing it in a distinctive
packaging, is most often to identify the source of the product.
Although the words and packaging can serve subsidiary
functions--a suggestive word mark (such as "Tide" for laundry detergent), for instance, may invoke positive connotations in the consumer's mind, and a garish form of packaging
(such as Tide's squat, brightly decorated plastic bottles for
its liquid laundry detergent) may attract an otherwise indifferent consumer's attention on a crowded store shelf--their
predominant function remains source identification. Consumers are therefore predisposed to regard those symbols
as indication of the producer, which is why such symbols
"almost automatically tell a customer that they refer to a
brand," id., at 162-163, and "immediately . . . signal a brand

Opinion of the Court
or a product `source,' " id., at 163. And where it is not rea-sonable to assume consumer predisposition to take an affixed

word or packaging as indication of source--where, for exam-ple, the affixed word is descriptive of the product ("Tasty"
bread) or of a geographic origin ("Georgia" peaches)--inher-ent distinctiveness will not be found. That is why the statute generally excludes, from those word marks that can be
registered as inherently distinctive, words that are "merelydescriptive" of the goods, $ 2(e)(1), 15 U. S. C. $ 1052(e)(1), or

"primarily geographically descriptive of them," see $ 2(e)(2),15 U. S. C. $ 1052(e)(2). In the case of product design, as in
the case of color, we think consumer predisposition to equate
the feature with the source does not exist. Consumers are
aware of the reality that, almost invariably, even the most
unusual of product designs--such as a cocktail shaker shaped
like a penguin--is intended not to identify the source, but
to render the product itself more useful or more appealing.

The fact that product design almost invariably serves purposes other than source identification not only renders inherent distinctiveness problematic; it also renders application of
an inherent-distinctiveness principle more harmful to other
consumer interests. Consumers should not be deprived of
the benefits of competition with regard to the utilitarian and
esthetic purposes that product design ordinarily serves by a
rule of law that facilitates plausible threats of suit against
new entrants based upon alleged inherent distinctiveness.
How easy it is to mount a plausible suit depends, of course,
upon the clarity of the test for inherent distinctiveness, and
where product design is concerned we have little confidence
that a reasonably clear test can be devised. Respondent and
the United States as amicus curiae urge us to adopt for
product design relevant portions of the test formulated by
the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals for product packaging in Seabrook Foods, Inc. v. Bar-Well Foods, Ltd., 568
F. 2d 1342 (1977). That opinion, in determining the inherent
distinctiveness of a product's packaging, considered, among

other things, "whether it was a `common' basic shape or de-sign, whether it was unique or unusual in a particular field,

[and] whether it was a mere refinement of a commonly-adopted and well-known form of ornamentation for a particular class of goods viewed by the public as a dress or orna-mentation for the goods."

Id., at 1344 (footnotes omitted).
Such a test would rarely provide the basis for summary disposition of an anticompetitive strike suit. Indeed, at oralargument, counsel for the United States quite understandably would not give a definitive answer as to whether thetest was met in this very case, saying only that "[t]his is
a very difficult case for that purpose." Tr. of Oral Arg. 19.

It is true, of course, that the person seeking to exclude
new entrants would have to establish the nonfunctionality of
the design feature, see $ 43(a)(3), 15 U. S. C. $ 1125(a)(3) (1994
ed., Supp. V)--a showing that may involve consideration of
its esthetic appeal, see Qualitex, supra, at 170. Competition is deterred, however, not merely by successful suit but
by the plausible threat of successful suit, and given the unlikelihood of inherently source-identifying design, the game
of allowing suit based upon alleged inherent distinctiveness
seems to us not worth the candle. That is especially so since
the producer can ordinarily obtain protection for a design
that is inherently source identifying (if any such exists), but
that does not yet have secondary meaning, by securing a
design patent or a copyright for the design--as, indeed, respondent did for certain elements of the designs in this case.
The availability of these other protections greatly reduces
any harm to the producer that might ensue from our conclusion that a product design cannot be protected under $ 43(a)
without a showing of secondary meaning.

Respondent contends that our decision in Two Pesos forecloses a conclusion that product-design trade dress can never
be inherently distinctive. In that case, we held that the
trade dress of a chain of Mexican restaurants, which the
plaintiff described as "a festive eating atmosphere having

Opinion of the Court
interior dining and patio areas decorated with artifacts,bright colors, paintings and murals," 505 U. S., at 765 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), could be protectedunder $ 43(a) without a showing of secondary meaning, see
id., at 776. Two Pesos unquestionably establishes the legalprinciple that trade dress can be inherently distinctive, see,
e. g., id., at 773, but it does not establish that product-design
trade dress can be. Two Pesos is inapposite to our holdinghere because the trade dress at issue, the de' cor of a restaurant, seems to us not to constitute product design. It waseither product packaging--which, as we have discussed, normally is taken by the consumer to indicate origin--or else
some tertium quid that is akin to product packaging and has
no bearing on the present case.

Respondent replies that this manner of distinguishing
Two Pesos will force courts to draw difficult lines between
product-design and product-packaging trade dress. There
will indeed be some hard cases at the margin: a classic glass
Coca-Cola bottle, for instance, may constitute packaging for
those consumers who drink the Coke and then discard the
bottle, but may constitute the product itself for those consumers who are bottle collectors, or part of the product itself
for those consumers who buy Coke in the classic glass bottle,
rather than a can, because they think it more stylish to drink
from the former. We believe, however, that the frequency
and the difficulty of having to distinguish between product
design and product packaging will be much less than the
frequency and the difficulty of having to decide when a product design is inherently distinctive. To the extent there are
close cases, we believe that courts should err on the side of
caution and classify ambiguous trade dress as product design, thereby requiring secondary meaning. The very closeness will suggest the existence of relatively small utility in
adopting an inherent-distinctiveness principle, and relatively
great consumer benefit in requiring a demonstration of secondary meaning.

BOARD OF REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF

WISCONSIN SYSTEM v. SOUTHWORTH et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe seventh circuit

No. 98-1189. Argued November 9, 1999--Decided March 22, 2000
Petitioner, Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System (hereinafter University), requires students at the University's Madison campus to pay a segregated activity fee. The fee supports various campus
services and extracurricular student activities. In the University's
view, such fees enhance students' educational experience by promoting
extracurricular activities, stimulating advocacy and debate on diverse
points of view, enabling participation in campus administrative activity,
and providing opportunities to develop social skills, all consistent with
the University's broad educational mission. Registered student organizations (RSO's) engaging in a number of diverse expressive activities
are eligible to receive a portion of the fees, which are administered by
the student government subject to the University's approval. The parties have stipulated that the process for reviewing and approving RSO
applications for funding is administered in a viewpoint-neutral fashion.
RSO's may also obtain funding through a student referendum. Respondents, present and former Madison campus students, filed suit
against the University, alleging, inter alia, that the fee violates their
First Amendment rights, and that the University must grant them the
choice not to fund RSO's that engage in political and ideological expression offensive to their personal beliefs. In granting respondents summary judgment, the Federal District Court declared the fee program
invalid under Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed., 431 U. S. 209, and Keller v.
State Bar of Cal., 496 U. S. 1, and enjoined the University from using
the fees to fund any RSO engaging in political or ideological speech.
Agreeing with the District Court that this Court's compelled speech
precedents control, the Seventh Circuit concluded that the program was
not germane to the University's mission, did not further a vital University policy, and imposed too great a burden on respondents' free speech
rights. It added that protecting those rights was of heightened concern
following Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S.
819, because if the University could not discriminate in distributing the
funds, students could not be compelled to fund organizations engaging
in political and ideological speech. It extended the District Court's
order and enjoined the University from requiring students to pay that

portion of the fee used to fund RSO's engaged in political or ideological expression.

Held:

1. The First Amendment permits a public university to charge its
students an activity fee used to fund a program to facilitate extracurricular student speech, provided that the program is viewpoint neutral.
The University exacts the fee at issue for the sole purpose of facilitating
the free and open exchange of ideas by, and among, its students. Objecting students, however, may insist upon certain safeguards with respect to the expressive activities they are required to support. The
Court's public forum cases are instructive here by close analogy. Because the complaining students must pay fees to subsidize speech they
find objectionable, even offensive, the rights acknowledged in Abood and
Keller are implicated. In those cases, this Court held that a required
service fee paid by nonunion employees to a union, Abood, supra, at 213,
and fees paid by lawyers who were required to join a state bar association, Keller, supra, at 13-14, could be used to fund speech germane to
those organizations' purposes but not to fund the organizations' own
political expression. While these precedents identify the protesting
students' interests, their germane speech standard is unworkable in the
context of student speech at a university and gives insufficient protection both to the objecting students and to the University program itself.
Even in the union context, this Court has encountered difficulties in
deciding what is germane and what is not. The standard becomes all
the more unmanageable in the public university setting, particularly
where, as here, the State undertakes to stimulate the whole universe of
speech and ideas. To insist upon asking what speech is germane would
be contrary to the very goal the University seeks to pursue. The vast
extent of permitted expression also underscores the high potential for
intrusion on the objecting students' First Amendment rights, for it is
all but inevitable that the fees will subsidize speech that some students
find objectionable or offensive. A university is free to protect those
rights by allowing an optional or refund system, but such a system is
not a constitutional requirement. If a university determines that its
mission is well served if students have the means to engage in dynamic
discussion on a broad range of issues, it may impose a mandatory fee to
sustain such dialogue. It must provide some protection to its students'
First Amendment interests, however. The proper measure, and the
principal standard of protection for objecting students, is the requirement of viewpoint neutrality in the allocation of funding support. This
obligation was given substance in Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors
of Univ. of Va., supra, which concerned a student's right to use an extracurricular speech program already in place. The instant case considers
the antecedent question whether a public university may require stu529US1 Unit: $U39 [09-26-01 13:21:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN

dents to pay a fee which creates the mechanism for the extracurricular
speech in the first instance. The University may sustain the extracurricular dimensions of its programs by using mandatory student fees with
viewpoint neutrality as the operational principle. There is symmetry
then in the holding here and in Rosenberger. Pp. 229-234.

2. Because the parties have stipulated that the University's program
respects the principle of viewpoint neutrality, the program in its basic
structure must be found consistent with the First Amendment. This
decision makes no distinction between campus and off-campus activities;
and it ought not be taken to imply that when the University, its agents,
employees, or faculty speak, they are subject to the First Amendment
analysis which controls in this case. Pp. 234-235.

3. While not well developed on the present record, the referendum
aspect of the University's program appears to permit RSO funding or
defunding by majority vote of the student body. To the extent the referendum substitutes majority determinations for viewpoint neutrality
it would undermine the constitutional protection the program requires.

extracurricular student speech at a public university. Re-spondents are a group of students at the University of

Wisconsin (hereinafter University). They brought a FirstAmendment challenge to a mandatory student activity fee
imposed by petitioner Board of Regents of the University ofWisconsin System and used in part by the University to support student organizations engaging in political or ideologicalspeech. Respondents object to the speech and expression
of some of the student organizations. Relying upon ourprecedents which protect members of unions and bar associations from being required to pay fees used for speech themembers find objectionable, both the District Court and the
Court of Appeals invalidated the University's student feeprogram. The University contends that its mandatory student activity fee and the speech which it supports are appro-priate to further its educational mission.

We reverse. The First Amendment permits a public uni-versity to charge its students an activity fee used to fund a
program to facilitate extracurricular student speech if theprogram is viewpoint neutral. We do not sustain, however,
the student referendum mechanism of the University's pro-gram, which appears to permit the exaction of fees in violation of the viewpoint neutrality principle. As to that aspectof the program, we remand for further proceedings.

v. SOUTHWORTH

Opinion of the Court

$ 36.01(2). Some 30,000 undergraduate students and 10,000graduate and professional students attend the University's

Madison campus, ranking it among the Nation's largest insti-tutions of higher learning. Students come to the renowned
University from all 50 States and from 72 foreign countries.Last year marked its 150th anniversary; and to celebrate its
distinguished history, the University sponsored a series of
research initiatives, campus forums and workshops, histori-cal exhibits, and public lectures, all reaffirming its commitment to explore the universe of knowledge and ideas.The responsibility for governing the University of Wisconsin System is vested by law with the board of regents.

$ 36.09(1). The same law empowers the students to share in
aspects of the University's governance. One of those functions is to administer the student activities fee program. By
statute the "[s]tudents in consultation with the chancellor
and subject to the final confirmation of the board [of regents]
shall have the responsibility for the disposition of those student fees which constitute substantial support for campus
student activities." $ 36.09(5). The students do so, in large
measure, through their student government, called the Associated Students of Madison (ASM), and various ASM
subcommittees. The program the University maintains to
support the extracurricular activities undertaken by many
of its student organizations is the subject of the present
controversy.

It seems that since its founding the University has required full-time students enrolled at its Madison campus to
pay a nonrefundable activity fee. App. 154. For the 1995-
1996 academic year, when this suit was commenced, the activity fee amounted to $331.50 per year. The fee is segregated from the University's tuition charge. Once collected,
the activity fees are deposited by the University into the
accounts of the State of Wisconsin. Id., at 9. The fees are
drawn upon by the University to support various campus
services and extracurricular student activities. In the Uni529US1 Unit: $U39 [09-26-01 13:21:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN

223Cite as: 529 U. S. 217 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
versity's view, the activity fees "enhance the educationalexperience" of its students by "promot[ing] extracurricular

activities," "stimulating advocacy and debate on diversepoints of view," enabling "participa[tion] in political activity,"
"promot[ing] student participa[tion] in campus administra-tive activity," and providing "opportunities to develop social
skills," all consistent with the University's mission. Id., at
154-155.The board of regents classifies the segregated fee into allocable and nonallocable portions. The nonallocable portionapproximates 80% of the total fee and covers expenses such
as student health services, intramural sports, debt service,
and the upkeep and operations of the student union facilities.
Id., at 13. Respondents did not challenge the purposes to
which the University commits the nonallocable portion of the
segregated fee. Id., at 37.

The allocable portion of the fee supports extracurricular
endeavors pursued by the University's registered student organizations or RSO's. To qualify for RSO status students
must organize as a not-for-profit group, limit membership
primarily to students, and agree to undertake activities related to student life on campus. Id., at 15. During the
1995-1996 school year, 623 groups had RSO status on the
Madison campus. Id., at 255. To name but a few, RSO's
included the Future Financial Gurus of America; the International Socialist Organization; the College Democrats; the
College Republicans; and the American Civil Liberties Union
Campus Chapter. As one would expect, the expressive activities undertaken by RSO's are diverse in range and content, from displaying posters and circulating newsletters
throughout the campus, to hosting campus debates and guest
speakers, and to what can best be described as political
lobbying.

RSO's may obtain a portion of the allocable fees in one
of three ways. Most do so by seeking funding from the
Student Government Activity Fund (SGAF), administered

v. SOUTHWORTH

Opinion of the Court

by the ASM. SGAF moneys may be issued to support anRSO's operations and events, as well as travel expenses "central to the purpose of the organization." Id., at 18. As analternative, an RSO can apply for funding from the General
Student Services Fund (GSSF), administered through theASM's finance committee. During the 1995-1996 academic
year, 15 RSO's received GSSF funding. These RSO's included a campus tutoring center, the student radio station, astudent environmental group, a gay and bisexual student

center, a community legal office, an AIDS support network,a campus women's center, and the Wisconsin Student Public
Interest Research Group (WISPIRG). Id., at 16-17. The
University acknowledges that, in addition to providing campus services (e. g., tutoring and counseling), the GSSF-funded
RSO's engage in political and ideological expression. Brief
for Petitioner 10.

The GSSF, as well as the SGAF, consists of moneys originating in the allocable portion of the mandatory fee. The
parties have stipulated that, with respect to SGAF and
GSSF funding, "[t]he process for reviewing and approving
allocations for funding is administered in a viewpoint-neutral
fashion," id., at 14-15, and that the University does not use
the fee program for "advocating a particular point of view."
Id., at 39.

A student referendum provides a third means for an RSO
to obtain funding. Id., at 16. While the record is sparse on
this feature of the University's program, the parties inform
us that the student body can vote either to approve or to
disapprove an assessment for a particular RSO. One referendum resulted in an allocation of $45,000 to WISPIRG during the 1995-1996 academic year. At oral argument, counsel
for the University acknowledged that a referendum could
also operate to defund an RSO or to veto a funding decision
of the ASM. In October 1996, for example, the student body
voted to terminate funding to a national student organization
to which the University belonged. Id., at 215. Both parties

Opinion of the Court
confirmed at oral argument that their stipulation regardingthe program's viewpoint neutrality does not extend to the

referendum process. Tr. of Oral Arg. 19, 29.With respect to GSSF and SGAF funding, the ASM or
its finance committee makes initial funding decisions. App.14-15. The ASM does so in an open session, and interested
students may attend meetings when RSO funding is discussed. Id., at 14. It also appears that the ASM must ap-prove the results of a student referendum. Approval appears pro forma, however, as counsel for the Universityadvised us that the student government "voluntarily views
th[e] referendum as binding." Tr. of Oral Arg. 15. Once
the ASM approves an RSO's funding application, it forwards
its decision to the chancellor and to the board of regents for
their review and approval. App. 18, 19. Approximately
30% of the University's RSO's received funding during the
1995-1996 academic year.

RSO's, as a general rule, do not receive lump-sum cash
distributions. Rather, RSO's obtain funding support on a
reimbursement basis by submitting receipts or invoices to
the University. Guidelines identify expenses appropriate
for reimbursement. Permitted expenditures include, in the
main, costs for printing, postage, office supplies, and use of
University facilities and equipment. Materials printed with
student fees must contain a disclaimer that the views expressed are not those of the ASM. The University also reimburses RSO's for fees arising from membership in "other
related and non-profit organizations." Id., at 251.

The University's policy establishes purposes for which fees
may not be expended. RSO's may not receive reimbursement for "[g]ifts, donations, and contributions," the costs of
legal services, or for "[a]ctivities which are politically partisan or religious in nature." Id., at 251-252. (The policy
does not give examples of the prohibited expenditures.) A
separate policy statement on GSSF funding states that an
RSO can receive funding if it "does not have a primarily

Opinion of the Court

political orientation (i. e. is not a registered political group)."
Id., at 238. The same policy adds that an RSO "shall not
use [student fees] for any lobbying purposes." Ibid. Atone point in their brief respondents suggest that the prohibition against expenditures for "politically partisan" purposesrenders the program not viewpoint neutral. Brief for Respondents 31. In view of the fact that both parties entered
a stipulation to the contrary at the outset of this litigation,which was again reiterated during oral argument in this

Court, we do not consider respondents' challenge to this as-pect of the University's program.

The University's Student Organization Handbook has
guidelines for regulating the conduct and activities of RSO's.
In addition to obligating RSO's to adhere to the fee program's rules and regulations, the guidelines establish procedures authorizing any student to complain to the University
that an RSO is in noncompliance. An extensive investigative process is in place to evaluate and remedy violations.
The University's policy includes a range of sanctions for noncompliance, including probation, suspension, or termination
of RSO status.

One RSO that appears to operate in a manner distinct from
others is WISPIRG. For reasons not clear from the record,
WISPIRG receives lump-sum cash distributions from the
University. University counsel informed us that this distribution reduced the GSSF portion of the fee pool. Tr. of Oral
Arg. 15. The full extent of the uses to which WISPIRG puts
its funds is unclear. We do know, however, that WISPIRG
sponsored on-campus events regarding homelessness and environmental and consumer protection issues. App. 348. It
coordinated community food drives and educational programs and spent a portion of its activity fees for the lobbying
efforts of its parent organization and for student internships
aimed at influencing legislation. Id., at 344, 347.

attend the University's Madison campus, filed suit in the

Opinion of the Court
United States District Court for the Western District of Wis-consin against members of the board of regents. Respondents alleged, inter alia, that imposition of the segregated feeviolated their rights of free speech, free association, and free
exercise under the First Amendment. They contended theUniversity must grant them the choice not to fund those
RSO's that engage in political and ideological expression offensive to their personal beliefs. Respondents requestedboth injunctive and declaratory relief. On cross-motions for

summary judgment, the District Court ruled in their favor,declaring the University's segregated fee program invalid
under Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed., 431 U. S. 209 (1977), and
Keller v. State Bar of Cal., 496 U. S. 1 (1990). The District
Court decided the fee program compelled students "to support political and ideological activity with which they disagree" in violation of respondents' First Amendment rights
to freedom of speech and association. App. to Pet. for Cert.
98a. The court did not reach respondents' free exercise
claim. The District Court's order enjoined the board of regents from using segregated fees to fund any RSO engaging
in political or ideological speech.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed in part, reversed in part, and vacated in part.
Southworth v. Grebe, 151 F. 3d 717 (1998). As the District
Court had done, the Court of Appeals found our compelled
speech precedents controlling. After examining the University's fee program under the three-part test outlined in Lehnert v. Ferris Faculty Assn., 500 U. S. 507 (1991), it concluded
that the program was not germane to the University's mission, did not further a vital policy of the University, and imposed too much of a burden on respondents' free speech
rights. "[L]ike the objecting union members in Abood," the
Court of Appeals reasoned, the students here have a First
Amendment interest in not being compelled to contribute to
an organization whose expressive activities conflict with
their own personal beliefs. 151 F. 3d, at 731. It added that

Opinion of the Court

protecting the objecting students' free speech rights was "of
heightened concern" following our decision in Rosenberger v.
Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819 (1995),
because "[i]f the university cannot discriminate in the disbursement of funds, it is imperative that students not be
compelled to fund organizations which engage in political and
ideological activities--that is the only way to protect the individual's rights." 151 F. 3d, at 730, n. 11. The Court of
Appeals extended the District Court's order and enjoined
the board of regents from requiring objecting students to
pay that portion of the fee used to fund RSO's engaged in
political or ideological expression. Id., at 735.

Three members of the Court of Appeals dissented from
the denial of the University's motion for rehearing en banc.
In their view, the panel opinion overlooked the "crucial difference between a requirement to pay money to an organization that explicitly aims to subsidize one viewpoint to
the exclusion of other viewpoints, as in Abood and Keller,
and a requirement to pay a fee to a group that creates a
viewpoint-neutral forum, as is true of the student activity
fee here." Southworth v. Grebe, 157 F. 3d 1124, 1129 (CA7
1998) (D. Wood, J., dissenting).

Other courts addressing First Amendment challenges to
similar student fee programs have reached conflicting results. Compare Rounds v. Oregon State Bd. of Higher Ed.,
166 F. 3d 1032, 1038-1040 (CA9 1999); Hays County Guardian v. Supple, 969 F. 2d 111, 123 (CA5 1992), cert. denied,
506 U. S. 1087 (1993); Kania v. Fordham, 702 F. 2d 475, 480
(CA4 1983); Good v. Associated Students of Univ. of Wash.,
86 Wash. 2d 94, 105, 542 P. 2d 762, 769 (1975) (en banc), with
Smith v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 4 Cal. 4th 843, 862-863, 844
P. 2d 500, 513-514, cert. denied, 510 U. S. 863 (1993). These
conflicts, together with the importance of the issue presented, led us to grant certiorari. 526 U. S. 1038 (1999).
We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

Opinion of the Court

II
It is inevitable that government will adopt and pursue pro-grams and policies within its constitutional powers but which

nevertheless are contrary to the profound beliefs and sincereconvictions of some of its citizens. The government, as a
general rule, may support valid programs and policies bytaxes or other exactions binding on protesting parties.
Within this broader principle it seems inevitable that fundsraised by the government will be spent for speech and other
expression to advocate and defend its own policies. See,
e. g., Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U. S. 173 (1991); Regan v. Taxation With Representation of Wash., 461 U. S. 540, 548-549(1983). The case we decide here, however, does not raise

the issue of the government's right, or, to be more specific,the state-controlled University's right, to use its own funds
to advance a particular message. The University's wholejustification for fostering the challenged expression is that it
springs from the initiative of the students, who alone give itpurpose and content in the course of their extracurricular
endeavors.The University having disclaimed that the speech is its
own, we do not reach the question whether traditional politi-cal controls to ensure responsible government action would
be sufficient to overcome First Amendment objections andto allow the challenged program under the principle that the
government can speak for itself. If the challenged speechhere were financed by tuition dollars and the University and
its officials were responsible for its content, the case mightbe evaluated on the premise that the government itself is the
speaker. That is not the case before us.The University of Wisconsin exacts the fee at issue for the
sole purpose of facilitating the free and open exchange ofideas by, and among, its students. We conclude the objecting students may insist upon certain safeguards with respectto the expressive activities which they are required to support. Our public forum cases are instructive here by close

Opinion of the Court

analogy. This is true even though the student activitiesfund is not a public forum in the traditional sense of the term

and despite the circumstance that those cases most often in-volve a demand for access, not a claim to be exempt from
supporting speech. See, e. g., Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist., 508 U. S. 384 (1993); Widmar
v. Vincent, 454 U. S. 263 (1981). The standard of viewpoint
neutrality found in the public forum cases provides thestandard we find controlling. We decide that the viewpoint

neutrality requirement of the University program is in gen-eral sufficient to protect the rights of the objecting students.
The student referendum aspect of the program for funding
speech and expressive activities, however, appears to be inconsistent with the viewpoint neutrality requirement.

We must begin by recognizing that the complaining students are being required to pay fees which are subsidies for
speech they find objectionable, even offensive. The Abood
and Keller cases, then, provide the beginning point for our
analysis. Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed., 431 U. S. 209 (1977);
Keller v. State Bar of Cal., 496 U. S. 1 (1990). While those
precedents identify the interests of the protesting students,
the means of implementing First Amendment protections
adopted in those decisions are neither applicable nor workable in the context of extracurricular student speech at a
university.

In Abood, some nonunion public school teachers challenged
an agreement requiring them, as a condition of their employment, to pay a service fee equal in amount to union dues.
431 U. S., at 211-212. The objecting teachers alleged that
the union's use of their fees to engage in political speech
violated their freedom of association guaranteed by the First
and Fourteenth Amendments. Id., at 213. The Court
agreed and held that any objecting teacher could "prevent
the Union's spending a part of their required service fees to
contribute to political candidates and to express political
views unrelated to its duties as exclusive bargaining repre529US1 Unit: $U39 [09-26-01 13:21:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
sentative." Id., at 234. The principles outlined in Aboodprovided the foundation for our later decision in

Keller.
There we held that lawyers admitted to practice in Californiacould be required to join a state bar association and to fund

activities "germane" to the association's mission of "regulat-ing the legal profession and improving the quality of legal
services." 496 U. S., at 13-14. The lawyers could not, however, be required to fund the bar association's own politicalexpression.

Id., at 16.
The proposition that students who attend the Universitycannot be required to pay subsidies for the speech of other

students without some First Amendment protection follows
from the Abood and Keller cases. Students enroll in public
universities to seek fulfillment of their personal aspirations
and of their own potential. If the University conditions the
opportunity to receive a college education, an opportunity
comparable in importance to joining a labor union or bar association, on an agreement to support objectionable, extracurricular expression by other students, the rights acknowledged in Abood and Keller become implicated. It infringes
on the speech and beliefs of the individual to be required, by
this mandatory student activity fee program, to pay subsidies for the objectionable speech of others without any recognition of the State's corresponding duty to him or her. Yet
recognition must be given as well to the important and substantial purposes of the University, which seeks to facilitate
a wide range of speech.

In Abood and Keller, the constitutional rule took the form
of limiting the required subsidy to speech germane to the
purposes of the union or bar association. The standard of
germane speech as applied to student speech at a university
is unworkable, however, and gives insufficient protection
both to the objecting students and to the University program
itself. Even in the context of a labor union, whose functions
are, or so we might have thought, well known and understood by the law and the courts after a long history of gov529US1 Unit: $U39 [09-26-01 13:21:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court

ernment regulation and judicial involvement, we have en-countered difficulties in deciding what is germane and what

is not. The difficulty manifested itself in our decision in
Lehnert v. Ferris Faculty Assn., 500 U. S. 507 (1991), where
different Members of the Court reached varying conclusionsregarding what expressive activity was or was not germane

to the mission of the association. If it is difficult to define
germane speech with ease or precision where a union or barassociation is the party, the standard becomes all the more

unmanageable in the public university setting, particularlywhere the State undertakes to stimulate the whole universe
of speech and ideas.

The speech the University seeks to encourage in the program before us is distinguished not by discernable limits but
by its vast, unexplored bounds. To insist upon asking what
speech is germane would be contrary to the very goal the
University seeks to pursue. It is not for the Court to say
what is or is not germane to the ideas to be pursued in an
institution of higher learning.

Just as the vast extent of permitted expression makes the
test of germane speech inappropriate for intervention, so too
does it underscore the high potential for intrusion on the
First Amendment rights of the objecting students. It is all
but inevitable that the fees will result in subsidies to speech
which some students find objectionable and offensive to their
personal beliefs. If the standard of germane speech is inapplicable, then, it might be argued the remedy is to allow each
student to list those causes which he or she will or will not
support. If a university decided that its students' First
Amendment interests were better protected by some type of
optional or refund system it would be free to do so. We
decline to impose a system of that sort as a constitutional
requirement, however. The restriction could be so disruptive and expensive that the program to support extracurricular speech would be ineffective. The First Amendment does
not require the University to put the program at risk.

Opinion of the Court
The University may determine that its mission is wellserved if students have the means to engage in dynamic discussions of philosophical, religious, scientific, social, and po-litical subjects in their extracurricular campus life outside
the lecture hall. If the University reaches this conclusion,it is entitled to impose a mandatory fee to sustain an open
dialogue to these ends.

The University must provide some protection to its stu-dents' First Amendment interests, however. The proper

measure, and the principal standard of protection for object-ing students, we conclude, is the requirement of viewpoint
neutrality in the allocation of funding support. Viewpoint
neutrality was the obligation to which we gave substance in
Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S.
819 (1995). There the University of Virginia feared that any
association with a student newspaper advancing religious
viewpoints would violate the Establishment Clause. We rejected the argument, holding that the school's adherence to
a rule of viewpoint neutrality in administering its student
fee program would prevent "any mistaken impression that
the student newspapers speak for the University." Id., at
841. While Rosenberger was concerned with the rights a
student has to use an extracurricular speech program already in place, today's case considers the antecedent question, acknowledged but unresolved in Rosenberger: whether
a public university may require its students to pay a fee
which creates the mechanism for the extracurricular speech
in the first instance. When a university requires its students to pay fees to support the extracurricular speech of
other students, all in the interest of open discussion, it may
not prefer some viewpoints to others. There is symmetry
then in our holding here and in Rosenberger: Viewpoint neutrality is the justification for requiring the student to pay
the fee in the first instance and for ensuring the integrity of
the program's operation once the funds have been collected.
We conclude that the University of Wisconsin may sustain

Opinion of the Court

the extracurricular dimensions of its programs by using man-datory student fees with viewpoint neutrality as the operational principle.The parties have stipulated that the program the University has developed to stimulate extracurricular studentexpression respects the principle of viewpoint neutrality. If
the stipulation is to continue to control the case, the University's program in its basic structure must be found consistentwith the First Amendment.

We make no distinction between campus activities andthe off-campus expressive activities of objectionable RSO's.
Those activities, respondents tell us, often bear no relationship to the University's reason for imposing the segregated
fee in the first instance, to foster vibrant campus debate
among students. If the University shares those concerns,
it is free to enact viewpoint neutral rules restricting offcampus travel or other expenditures by RSO's, for it may
create what is tantamount to a limited public forum if the
principles of viewpoint neutrality are respected. Cf. id., at
829-830. We find no principled way, however, to impose
upon the University, as a constitutional matter, a requirement to adopt geographic or spatial restrictions as a condition for RSOs' entitlement to reimbursement. Universities
possess significant interests in encouraging students to take
advantage of the social, civic, cultural, and religious opportunities available in surrounding communities and throughout
the country. Universities, like all of society, are finding that
traditional conceptions of territorial boundaries are difficult
to insist upon in an age marked by revolutionary changes
in communications, information transfer, and the means of
discourse. If the rule of viewpoint neutrality is respected,
our holding affords the University latitude to adjust its extracurricular student speech program to accommodate these
advances and opportunities.

Our decision ought not to be taken to imply that in other
instances the University, its agents or employees, or--of

Opinion of the Court
particular importance--its faculty, are subject to the First
Amendment analysis which controls in this case. Where the
University speaks, either in its own name through its regents
or officers, or in myriad other ways through its diverse faculties, the analysis likely would be altogether different. See
Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U. S. 173 (1991); Regan v. Taxation
With Representation of Wash., 461 U. S. 540 (1983). The
Court has not held, or suggested, that when the government
speaks the rules we have discussed come into play.

When the government speaks, for instance to promote its
own policies or to advance a particular idea, it is, in the end,
accountable to the electorate and the political process for its
advocacy. If the citizenry objects, newly elected officials
later could espouse some different or contrary position. In
the instant case, the speech is not that of the University or
its agents. It is not, furthermore, speech by an instructor
or a professor in the academic context, where principles applicable to government speech would have to be considered.
Cf. Rosenberger, supra, at 833 (discussing the discretion universities possess in deciding matters relating to their educational mission).

III

It remains to discuss the referendum aspect of the University's program. While the record is not well developed on
the point, it appears that by majority vote of the student
body a given RSO may be funded or defunded. It is unclear
to us what protection, if any, there is for viewpoint neutrality
in this part of the process. To the extent the referendum
substitutes majority determinations for viewpoint neutrality
it would undermine the constitutional protection the program requires. The whole theory of viewpoint neutrality is
that minority views are treated with the same respect as are
majority views. Access to a public forum, for instance, does
not depend upon majoritarian consent. That principle is
controlling here. A remand is necessary and appropriate to

resolve this point; and the case in all events must be reexam-ined in light of the principles we have discussed.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and thecase is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this
opinion. In this Court, the parties shall bear their owncosts.

It is so ordered.
Justice Souter, with whom Justice Stevens and
Justice Breyer join, concurring in the judgment.

The majority today validates the University's student ac-tivity fee after recognizing a new category of First Amendment interests and a new standard of viewpoint neutralityprotection. I agree that the University's scheme is permissible, but do not believe that the Court should take the occa-sion to impose a cast-iron viewpoint neutrality requirement
to uphold it. See ante, at 233-234. Instead, I would holdthat the First Amendment interest claimed by the student
respondents (hereinafter Southworth) here is simply insuffi-cient to merit protection by anything more than the viewpoint neutrality already accorded by the University, and Iwould go no further.

1

The parties have stipulated that the grant scheme is ad-ministered on a viewpoint neutral basis, and like the majority I take the case on that assumption. The question beforeus is thus properly cast not as whether viewpoint neutrality
is required, but whether Southworth has a claim to relieffrom this specific viewpoint neutral scheme.

2 Two sources

of law might be considered in answering this question.

1 I limit my examination of the case solely to the general disbursement
scheme; I agree with the majority that the referendum issue was not adequately addressed in the District Court and the Court of Appeals, see
ante, at 235 and this page, and I would say nothing more on that subject.

2 Under its own reasoning, the majority need not reach the question

whether viewpoint neutrality is required to decide this case. The University program required viewpoint neutrality, and both parties have stipulated that the funds are disbursed accordingly. Stipulation 12, App. 14-

Souter, J., concurring in judgment
The first comprises First Amendment and related cases
grouped under the umbrella of academic freedom.3 Such
law might be implicated by the University's proffered rationale, that the grant scheme funded by the student activity
fee is an integral element in the discharge of its educational
mission. App. 253 (excerpt from Dean of Students Office
Student Organization Handbook noting that the activities
of student groups constitute a " `second curriculum' "); id.,
at 41, 42-44 (statement of Associate Dean of Students of
the UW-Madison noting academic importance of funding
scheme); see also ante, at 233. Our understanding of academic freedom has included not merely liberty from restraints on thought, expression, and association in the academy, but also the idea that universities and schools should
have the freedom to make decisions about how and what to
teach. In Regents of Univ. of Mich. v. Ewing, 474 U. S. 214
(1985), we recognized these related conceptions: "Academic
freedom thrives not only on the independent and uninhibited
exchange of ideas among teachers and students, but also, and
somewhat inconsistently, on autonomous decisionmaking by
the academy itself." Id., at 226, n. 12 (citations omitted).
Some of the opinions in our books emphasize broad conceptions of academic freedom that if accepted by the Court
might seem to clothe the University with an immunity to any
challenge to regulations made or obligations imposed in the
discharge of its educational mission. So, in Sweezy v. New
Hampshire, 354 U. S. 234 (1957), Justice Frankfurter, concurring in the result and joined by Justice Harlan, explained the

uphold the scheme here on that limited ground without deciding whether
it is a necessary one.

3 We have long recognized the constitutional importance of academic

freedom. See Wieman v. Updegraff, 344 U. S. 183, 195 (1952) (Frankfurter, J., concurring); Sweezy v. New Hampshire, 354 U. S. 234, 250 (1957)
(plurality opinion); Shelton v. Tucker, 364 U. S. 479, 487 (1960); Keyishian
v. Board of Regents of Univ. of State of N. Y., 385 U. S. 589, 603 (1967).

importance of a university's ability to define its own missionby quoting from a statement on the open universities in

South Africa:

" `It is the business of a university to provide that atmos-phere which is most conducive to speculation, experiment and creation. It is an atmosphere in which thereprevail "the four essential freedoms" of a university--to
determine for itself on academic grounds who may teach,what may be taught, how it shall be taught, and who
may be admitted to study.' " Id., at 263 (citationsomitted).

These broad statements on academic freedom do not dis-pose of the case here, however.

Ewing addressed not therelationship between academic freedom and First Amendment burdens imposed by a university, but a due processchallenge to a university's academic decisions, while as to
them the case stopped short of recognizing absolute auton-omy. Ewing, supra, at 226, and n. 12. And Justice Frankfurter's discussion in Sweezy, though not rejected, was notadopted by the full Court,

Sweezy, supra, at 263 (opinionconcurring in result). Our other cases on academic freedom

thus far have dealt with more limited subjects, and do notcompel the conclusion that the objecting university student
is without a First Amendment claim here.4 While we havespoken in terms of a wide protection for the academic free4 Our university cases have dealt with restrictions imposed from outside
the academy on individual teachers' speech or associations, id., at 591-592;
Shelton v. Tucker, supra, at 487; Sweezy v. New Hampshire, supra, at 236;
Wieman v. Updegraff, supra, at 184-185, and cases dealing with the right
of teaching institutions to limit expressive freedom of students have been
confined to high schools, Hazelwood School Dist. v. Kuhlmeier, 484 U. S.
260, 262 (1988); Bethel School Dist. No. 403 v. Fraser, 478 U. S. 675, 677
(1986); Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School Dist., 393
U. S. 503, 504 (1969), whose students and their schools' relation to them
are different and at least arguably distinguishable from their counterparts
in college education.

dom and autonomy that bars legislatures (and courts) fromimposing conditions on the spectrum of subjects taught and

viewpoints expressed in college teaching (as the majorityrecognizes, ante, at 232), we have never held that universities lie entirely beyond the reach of students' First Amend-ment rights.

5 Thus our prior cases do not go so far as to

control the result in this one, and going beyond those caseswould be out of order, simply because the University has

not litigated on grounds of academic freedom. As to thatfreedom and university autonomy, then, it is enough to say
that protecting a university's discretion to shape its educa-tional mission may prove to be an important consideration
in First Amendment analysis of objections to student fees.
Sweezy, supra, at 262-264 (Frankfurter, J., concurring in re-sult); Ewing, supra, at 226, n. 12.

The second avenue for addressing Southworth's claim to apro rata refund or the total abolition of the student activity
fee is to see how closely the circumstances here resembleinstances of governmental speech mandates found to require
relief. As a threshold matter, it is plain that this case fallsfar afield of those involving compelled or controlled speech,
apart from subsidy schemes. Indirectly transmitting a frac-tion of a student activity fee to an organization with an offensive message is in no sense equivalent to restricting or modi-fying the message a student wishes to express. Cf.

Hurleyv. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc., 515 U. S. 557, 572-574 (1995). Nor does it requirean individual to bear an offensive statement personally, as in
Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U. S. 705, 707 (1977), let alone toaffirm a moral or political commitment, as in West Virginia
Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624, 626-629 (1943). Ineach of these cases, the government was imposing far more
directly and offensively on an objecting individual than col5 Indeed, acceptance of the most general statement of academic freedom
(as in the South African manifesto quoted by Justice Frankfurter) might
be thought even to sanction student speech codes in public universities.

lecting the fee that indirectly funds the jumble of otherspeakers' messages in this case.

Next, I agree with the majority that the Abood and Kellerline of cases does not control the remedy here, the situation
of the students being significantly different from that ofunion or bar association members. Ante, at 230; see Abood
v. Detroit Bd. of Ed., 431 U. S. 209 (1977); Keller v. State Bar
of Cal., 496 U. S. 1 (1990). First, the relationship betweenthe fee payer and the ultimately objectionable expression is

far more attenuated. In the union and bar association cases,an individual was required to join or at least drop money in
the coffers of the very organization promoting messages sub-ject to objection. Abood, supra, at 211-213, 215; Keller,
supra, at 13-14. The connection between the forced con-tributor and the ultimate message was as direct as the unmediated contribution to the organization doing the speaking.The student contributor, however, has to fund only a distributing agency having itself no social, political, or ideologicalcharacter and itself engaging (as all parties agree) in no expression of any distinct message.6 App. 14-15, 34, 39, 41.Indeed, the disbursements, varying from year to year, are as
likely as not to fund an organization that disputes the verymessage an individual student finds exceptionable.

Id., at39. Thus, the clear connection between fee payer and offensive speech that loomed large in our decisions in the unionand bar cases is simply not evident here.

Second, Southworth's objection has less force than it mightotherwise carry because the challenged fees support a gov6 I have noted in other contexts that the act of funding itself may have

Endowment for Arts v. Finley, 524 U. S. 569, 611, n. 6 (1998) (dissenting
opinion), but there is no allegation that such general expression is objectionable here, nor is it clear that such a claim necessarily raises substantial
First Amendment concerns in light of the speech promoting and educational aspects of this expression. Cf. Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 92-93

ernment program that aims to broaden public discourse. As
I noted in Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va.,
515 U. S. 819, 873-874, and n. 3, 889-891 (1995) (dissenting
opinion), the university fee at issue is a tax.7 The state university compels it; it is paid into state accounts; and it is
disbursed under the ultimate authority of the State. Wis.
Stat. $ 36.09(5) (1993-1994); App. 9, 18-19. Although the
facts here may not fit neatly under our holdings on government speech (and the University has expressly renounced
any such claim),8 ante, at 229, our cases do suggest that
under the First Amendment the government may properly
use its tax revenue to promote general discourse.9 In Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1 (1976) (per curiam), we rejected
a challenge to a congressional program providing viewpoint
neutral subsidies to all Presidential candidates based in part
on this reasoning:

"[The program] is a congressional effort, not to abridge,
restrict, or censor speech, but rather to use public
money to facilitate and enlarge public discussion and
participation in the electoral process, goals vital to a
self-governing people. Thus, [the program] furthers,
not abridges, pertinent First Amendment values." Id.,
at 92-93 (footnotes omitted).

7 True, one does not have to go to college, but one does not have to own
real estate or receive a dividend.

8 Unlike the majority, I would not hold that the mere fact that the University disclaims speech as its own expression takes it out of the scope of
our jurisprudence on government directed speech. We have never generally questioned a university's "spacious discretion" to allocate public funds.
See Rosenberger, supra, at 892 (Souter, J., dissenting) (citing Rust v.
Sullivan, 500 U. S. 173 (1991), and Regan v. Taxation With Representation of Wash., 461 U. S. 540 (1983)).

9 Of course, I believe that even a government program that promotes a

broad range of expression is subject to the specific prohibition on government funding to promote religion, imposed by the Establishment Clause.

And we have recognized the same principle outside of thesphere of government spending as well. In PruneYard

Shopping Center v. Robins, 447 U. S. 74 (1980), we rejected ashopping mall owner's blanket claim that "a private property

We then upheld theright of individuals to exercise state-protected rights of expression on a shopping mall owner's property, noting amongother things that there was no danger that such a requirement would " `dampe[n] the vigor and limi[t] the variety ofpublic debate.'

Id., at 87, 88 (quoting Miami Herald Pub-lishing Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U. S. 241, 257 (1974) (alteration

Third, our prior compelled speech and compelled fundingcases are distinguishable on the basis of the legitimacy of
governmental interest. No one disputes the University's as-sertion that some educational value is derived from the activities supported by the fee, ante, at 232-233; supra, at 237,whereas there was no governmental interest in mandating
union or bar association support beyond supporting the col-lective bargaining and professional regulatory functions of

offensive viewpoints in ways that cannot be thought consti-tutionally objectionable unless one is prepared to deny the

University its choice over what to teach. No one disputesthat some fraction of students' tuition payments may be used
for course offerings that are ideologically offensive to somestudents, and for paying professors who say things in the
university forum that are radically at odds with the politicsof particular students. Least of all does anyone claim that
the University is somehow required to offer a spectrum ofcourses to satisfy a viewpoint neutrality requirement. See
Rosenberger, supra, at 892-893, and nn. 11-12 (Souter, J.,dissenting). The University need not provide junior years
abroad in North Korea as well as France, instruct in thetheory of plutocracy as well as democracy, or teach Nietzsche
as well as St. Thomas. Since uses of tuition payments (notoptional for anyone who wishes to stay in college) may fund
offensive speech far more obviously than the student activityfee does, it is difficult to see how the activity fee could present a stronger argument for a refund.In sum, I see no basis to provide relief from the scheme
being administered, would go no further, and respectfullyconcur in the judgment.

GARNER, FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE STATEBOARD OF PARDONS AND PAROLES OF

GEORGIA, et al. v. JONES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eleventh circuit

No. 99-137. Argued January 11, 2000--Decided March 28, 2000
Respondent escaped while serving a life sentence for murder, committed

another murder, and was sentenced to a second life term. Georgia law
requires the State's Board of Pardons and Paroles (Board) to consider
inmates serving life sentences for parole after seven years. At the time
respondent committed his second offense, the Board's Rule 475-3-.05(2)
required that reconsiderations for parole take place every three years.
Acting pursuant to statutory authority, the Board subsequently extended the reconsideration period to at least every eight years. The
Board has the discretion to shorten that interval, but declined to do so
when it applied the amended Rule in respondent's case, citing his multiple offenses and the circumstances and nature of his second offense.
Respondent sued petitioner Board members, claiming that retroactive
application of the amended Rule violated the Ex Post Facto Clause.
The District Court denied respondent's motion for discovery and
awarded petitioners summary judgment. The Eleventh Circuit reversed. It found that the amended Rule's retroactive application was
necessarily an ex post facto violation and that the Rule differed in material respects from the change in California parole law sustained in California Dept. of Corrections v. Morales, 514 U. S. 499. It did not consider the Board's internal policies regarding its implementation of the
Rule, finding, among other things, that such policies were unenforceable
and easily changed.

Held:

1. The Court of Appeals' analysis failed to reveal whether retroactive
application of the amendment to Rule 475-3-.05(2) violated the Ex Post
Facto Clause. The controlling inquiry is whether such application creates a sufficient risk of increasing the measure of punishment attached
to the covered crimes. Morales, supra, at 509. Here, the question
is whether amended Rule 475-3-.05(2) creates a significant risk of prolonging respondent's incarceration. That risk is not inherent in the
amended Rule's framework, and it has not otherwise been demonstrated
on the record. While Morales identified several factors convincing this

Syllabus
Court that California's law created an insignificant risk of increased punishment for covered inmates, the Court was careful not to adopt a single
formula for identifying which parole adjustments would survive an ex
post facto challenge. States must have due flexibility in formulating
parole procedure and addressing problems associated with confinement
and release. This case turns on the amended Rule's operation within
the whole context of Georgia's parole system. Georgia law gives the
Board broad discretion in determining whether an inmate should receive early release. Such discretion does not displace the Ex Post
Facto Clause's protections, but the idea of discretion is that it has the
capacity, and the obligation, to change and adapt based on experience.
The statutory structure, its implementing regulations, and the Board's
unrefuted representations regarding its operations do not support respondent's conclusion that the Board will not exercise its discretion in
the period between parole reviews. The Georgia law is qualified in two
important respects. First, it vests the Board with discretion as to how
often to set an inmate's date for reconsideration, with an 8-year maximum. Second, the Board's policies permit expedited reviews in the
event of a change in circumstance or new information. These qualifications permit the Board to set reconsideration dates according to the
likelihood that a review will result in meaningful considerations as to
whether an inmate is suitable for release. The Board's policy of providing reconsideration every eight years when it does not expect that parole would be granted during the intervening years enables the Board
to ensure that those prisoners who should receive parole come to its
attention. Given respondent's criminal history, it is difficult to see how
the Board increased his risk of serving a longer time when it set an
8-year, not a 3-year, interval. Yet, even he may seek earlier review
upon showing changed circumstances or new information. The Eleventh Circuit's supposition that the Rule seems certain to result in increased incarceration falls short of the rigorous analysis required by the
Morales standard. When the rule does not by its own terms show a
significant risk, the respondent must demonstrate, by evidence drawn
from the rule's practical implementation by the agency charged with
exercising discretion, that its retroactive application will result in a
longer period of incarceration than under the earlier rule. On the record in this case, it cannot be concluded that the change in Georgia law
lengthened respondent's actual imprisonment time. Pp. 249-256.

2. The Eleventh Circuit erred in not considering the Board's internal
policy statement regarding how it intends to enforce its Rule. At a
minimum, such statements, along with the Board's actual practices, provide important instruction as to how the Board interprets its enabling

statute and regulations, and therefore whether the amended Rule created a significant risk of increased punishment. Absent a demonstration to the contrary, it is presumed that the Board follows its statutory
commands and internal policies. Pp. 256-257.

3. The Eleventh Circuit's analysis failed to reveal whether the
amended Rule, in its operation, created a significant risk of increased
punishment for respondent. He claims that he has not been permitted
sufficient discovery to make this showing. The matter of adequate discovery is one for the Court of Appeals or, as need be, for the District
Court in the first instance. P. 257.

Opinion of the Court

I
In 1974 respondent Robert L. Jones began serving a lifesentence after his conviction for murder in the State of Georgia. He escaped from prison some five years later and, afterbeing a fugitive for over two years, committed another murder. He was apprehended, convicted, and in 1982 sentencedto a second life term.

Under Georgia law, at all times relevant here, the State'sBoard of Pardons and Paroles (Board or Parole Board)
has been required to consider inmates serving life sentencesfor parole after seven years. Ga. Code Ann. $ 42-9-45(b)
(1982). The issue in this case concerns the interval betweenproceedings to reconsider those inmates for parole after its
initial denial. At the time respondent committed his secondoffense, the Board's Rules required reconsiderations to take
place every three years. Ga. Rules & Regs., Rule 475-3-.05(2) (1979). In 1985, after respondent had begun serving
his second life sentence, the Parole Board, acting under itsauthority to "set forth . . . the times at which periodic reconsideration [for parole] shall take place," Ga. Code Ann. $ 42-9-45(a) (1982), amended its Rules to provide that "[r]econsideration of those inmates serving life sentences who havebeen denied parole shall take place at least every eight
years," Ga. Rules & Regs., Rule 475-3-.05(2) (1985).The Parole Board considered respondent for parole in
1989, seven years after the 1982 conviction. It denied re-lease and, consistent with the 1985 amendment to Rule 475-
3-.05(2), reconsideration was set for 1997, eight years later.In 1991, however, the United States Court of Appeals for
the Eleventh Circuit held that retroactive application of theamended Rule violated the

Ex Post Facto Clause. Akins v.Snow, 922 F. 2d 1558, cert. denied, 501 U. S. 1260 (1991). In

compliance with that decision, in effect reinstating its earlier3-year Rule, the Parole Board reconsidered respondent's
case in 1992 and in 1995. Both times parole was denied, theBoard citing for its action respondent's "multiple offenses"

Opinion of the Court
and the "circumstances and nature of " the second offense.App. 53-54.

In 1995 the Parole Board determined that our decision in
California Dept. of Corrections v. Morales, 514 U. S. 499
(1995), had rejected the rationale underlying the EleventhCircuit's decision in

Akins. The Board resumed scheduling
parole reconsiderations at least every eight years, and so at
respondent's 1995 review it set the next consideration for2003. Had the Board wished to do so, it could have shortened the interval, but the 8-year period was selected basedon respondent's "multiple offenses" and the "circumstances
and nature of " his second offense. App. 54. Respondent,
acting pro se, brought this action under Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42
U. S. C. $ 1983, claiming, inter alia, the amendment to Rule
475-3-.05(2) violated the Ex Post Facto Clause. The suit
was filed against individual members of the Parole Board,
petitioners in this Court. Respondent requested leave to
conduct discovery to support his claim, but the District
Court denied the motion and entered summary judgment for
petitioners. The court determined the amendment to Rule
475-3-.05(2) "change[d] only the timing between reconsideration hearings" for inmates sentenced to life in prison,
thereby "relieving the Board of the necessity of holding parole hearings for prisoners who have no reasonable chance
of being released." App. to Pet. for Cert. 27a. Because the
Parole Board's policies permit inmates, upon a showing of "a
change in their circumstance or where the Board receives
new information," App. 56, to receive expedited reconsideration for parole, the court further concluded the amendment
created " `only the most speculative and attenuated possibility' " of increasing a prisoner's measure of punishment, App.
to Pet. for Cert. 27a (quoting Morales, supra, at 509).

The Court of Appeals reversed, finding the amended Georgia Rule distinguishable in material respects from the California law sustained in Morales. 164 F. 3d 589 (CA11 1999).
In finding the Georgia law violative of the Ex Post Facto

Opinion of the Court
Clause, the court posited that the set of inmates affectedby the retroactive change--all prisoners serving life sentences--is "bound to be far more sizeable than the set . . .at issue in Morales"--inmates convicted of more than one
homicide. Id., at 594. The Georgia law sweeps within itscoverage, the court continued, "many inmates who can expect at some point to be paroled," ibid., and thus "seemscertain to ensure that some number of inmates will find the
length of their incarceration extended in violation of the
Ex Post Facto Clause of the Constitution," id., at 595."Eight years is a long time," the court emphasized, and

"[m]uch can happen in the course of eight years to affect thedetermination that an inmate would be suitable for parole."
Ibid. The Court of Appeals recognized that the ParoleBoard would set a new parole review date three years or
more into the future (up to eight years) only where it con-cludes that " `it is not reasonable to expect that parole would
be granted' " sooner. Ibid. (quoting policy statement of Pa-role Board). The court thought this policy insufficient, however, because, unlike the statute in Morales, it does not re-quire the Board "to make any particularized findings" and is
not "carefully tailored." 164 F. 3d, at 594-595. The courtalso recognized that the Board's policy permitted it to reconsider any parole denials upon a showing of a "change in cir-cumstance[s]" or upon the Board's receipt of "new information." The court deemed the policy insufficient, however,stating that "[p]olicy statements, unlike regulations are unenforceable and easily changed, and adherence to them is amatter of the Board's discretion."

Id., at 595.We granted certiorari, 527 U. S. 1068 (1999), and we now

reverse. II

The States are prohibited from enacting an ex post factolaw. U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 10, cl. 1. One function of the Ex

mission. Collins v. Youngblood, 497 U. S. 37, 42 (1990) (cit-ing

Beazell v. Ohio, 269 U. S. 167, 169-170 (1925)). Retroactive changes in laws governing parole of prisoners, in someinstances, may be violative of this precept. See

Lynce v.
Mathis, 519 U. S. 433, 445-446 (1997) (citing Weaver v. Graham, 450 U. S. 24, 32 (1981)); Morales, 514 U. S., at 508-509.
Whether retroactive application of a particular change in parole law respects the prohibition on ex post facto legislationis often a question of particular difficulty when the discretion

vested in a parole board is taken into account.Our recent decision in

Morales is an appropriate beginning
point. There a California statute changed the frequency of
reconsideration for parole from every year to up to every
three years for prisoners convicted of more than one homicide. Id., at 503. We found no ex post facto violation, emphasizing that not every retroactive procedural change
creating a risk of affecting an inmate's terms or conditions
of confinement is prohibited. Id., at 508-509. The question
is "a matter of `degree.' " Id., at 509 (quoting Beazell, supra,
at 171). The controlling inquiry, we determined, was
whether retroactive application of the change in California law created "a sufficient risk of increasing the measure
of punishment attached to the covered crimes." 514 U. S.,
at 509.

The amended California law did not violate this standard.
It did not modify the statutory punishment imposed for any
particular offenses. Nor did the amendment alter the standards for determining either the initial date for parole eligibility or an inmate's suitability for parole. Id., at 507. The
amendment did not change the basic structure of California's
parole law. It vested the California parole board with discretion to decrease the frequency with which it reconsidered
parole for a limited class, consisting of prisoners convicted
of more than one homicide. Id., at 507, 510. If the board
determined a low likelihood of release existed for a member
within that class, it could set the prisoner's next consider529US1 Unit: $U40 [10-04-01 09:23:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
ation date three years hence. The change in California lawdid not, however, prohibit requests for earlier reconsideration based on a change of circumstances. Id., at 512-513.Historical practices within the California penal system indicated "about 90% of all prisoners are found unsuitable forparole at the initial hearing, while 85% are found unsuitable
at the second and subsequent hearings." Id., at 510-511
(citing In re Jackson, 39 Cal. 3d 464, 473, 703 P. 2d 100, 105(1985)). On these facts we determined the

Ex Post Facto
Clause did not prohibit California from conserving and re-allocating the resources that would otherwise be expended

to conduct annual parole hearings for inmates with little
chance of release. 514 U. S., at 511-512. The sum of these
factors illustrated that the decrease in the frequency of parole suitability proceedings "create[d] only the most speculative and attenuated possibility of producing the prohibited
effect of increasing the measure of punishment for covered
crimes." Id., at 509.

Consistent with the Court of Appeals' analysis, respondent
stresses certain differences between Georgia's amended parole law and the California statute reviewed in Morales.
The amendment to Rule 475-3-.05(2), respondent urges, permits the extension of parole reconsiderations by five years
(not just by two years); covers all prisoners serving life sentences (not just multiple murderers); and affords inmates
fewer procedural safeguards (in particular, no formal hearings in which counsel can be present). These differences are
not dispositive. The question is whether the amended Georgia Rule creates a significant risk of prolonging respondent's
incarceration. See ibid. The requisite risk is not inherent
in the framework of amended Rule 475-3-.05(2), and it has
not otherwise been demonstrated on the record.

Our decision in Morales did not suggest all States must
model their procedures governing consideration for parole
after those of California to avoid offending the Ex Post Facto
Clause. The analysis undertaken in Morales did identify

529US1 Unit: $U40 [10-04-01 09:23:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN
252 GARNER v. JONES

Opinion of the Court
factors which convinced us the amendment to California law
created an insignificant risk of increased punishment for covered inmates. Our opinion was careful, however, not to
adopt a single formula for identifying which legislative adjustments, in matters bearing on parole, would survive an
ex post facto challenge. Ibid. We also observed that the
Ex Post Facto Clause should not be employed for "the micromanagement of an endless array of legislative adjustments
to parole and sentencing procedures." Id., at 508. These
remain important concerns. The States must have due
flexibility in formulating parole procedures and addressing
problems associated with confinement and release.

The case turns on the operation of the amendment to Rule
475-3-.05(2) within the whole context of Georgia's parole
system. Georgia law charges the Parole Board with determining which prisoners "may be released on pardon or parole
and [with] fixing the time and conditions thereof." Ga. Code
Ann. $ 42-9-20 (1997). In making release decisions, the
same law, in relevant part, provides:

"Good conduct, achievement of a fifth-grade level or
higher on standardized reading tests, and efficient performance of duties by an inmate shall be considered by
the board in his favor and shall merit consideration of
an application for pardon or parole. No inmate shall be
placed on parole until and unless the board shall find
that there is reasonable probability that, if he is so released, he will live and conduct himself as a respectable
and law-abiding person and that his release will be compatible with his own welfare and the welfare of society.
Furthermore, no person shall be released on pardon or
placed on parole unless and until the board is satisfied
that he will be suitably employed in self-sustaining employment or that he will not become a public charge."

Opinion of the Court
See also $ 42-9-43 (listing information the Board should consider, including wardens' reports, results of physical and
mental examinations, and reports regarding prisoners' performance in educational programs). These provisions illustrate the broad discretion the Parole Board possesses in determining whether an inmate should receive early release.
Accord, Sultenfuss v. Snow, 35 F. 3d 1494, 1501-1502 (CA11
1994) (en banc) (describing the discretion Georgia law vests
with Parole Board). Only upon a showing that the Board
engaged in a "gross abuse of discretion" can a prisoner challenge a parole denial in the Georgia courts. Lewis v. Griffin, 258 Ga. 887, 888, n. 3, 376 S. E. 2d 364, 366, n. 3 (1989).

The presence of discretion does not displace the protections of the Ex Post Facto Clause, however. Cf. Weaver, 450
U. S., at 30-31. The danger that legislatures might disfavor
certain persons after the fact is present even in the parole
context, and the Court has stated that the Ex Post Facto
Clause guards against such abuse. See Miller v. Florida,
482 U. S. 423, 429 (1987) (citing Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386,
389 (1798) (Chase, J.)). On the other hand, to the extent
there inheres in ex post facto doctrine some idea of actual or
constructive notice to the criminal before commission of the
offense of the penalty for the transgression, see Weaver,
supra, at 28-29, we can say with some assurance that where
parole is concerned discretion, by its very definition, is subject to changes in the manner in which it is informed and
then exercised. The idea of discretion is that it has the
capacity, and the obligation, to change and adapt based on
experience. New insights into the accuracy of predictions
about the offense and the risk of recidivism consequent upon
the offender's release, along with a complex of other factors,
will inform parole decisions. See, e. g., Justice v. State
Board of Pardons and Paroles, 234 Ga. 749, 751-752, 218

Opinion of the Court
Board's consideration of numerous factors specific to aninmate's offense, rehabilitative efforts, and ability to live a

responsible, productive life). The essence of respondent'scase, as we see it, is not that discretion has been changed in
its exercise but that, in the period between parole reviews,it will not be exercised at all. The statutory structure, its
implementing regulations, and the Parole Board's unrefuted
representations regarding its operations do not lead to thisconclusion.

The law changing the frequency of parole reviews is quali-fied in two important respects. First, the law vests the
Parole Board with discretion as to how often to set an inmate's date for reconsideration, with eight years for the maximum. See Ga. Rules & Regs., Rule 475-3-.05(2) (1985)
("Reconsideration . . . shall take place at least every eight
years"). Second, the Board's policies permit "expedited parole reviews in the event of a change in their circumstance
or where the Board receives new information that would
warrant a sooner review." App. 56. These qualifications
permit a more careful and accurate exercise of the discretion
the Board has had from the outset. Rather than being required to review cases pro forma, the Board may set reconsideration dates according to the likelihood that a review will
result in meaningful considerations as to whether an inmate
is suitable for release. The Board's stated policy is to provide for reconsideration at 8-year intervals "when, in the
Board's determination, it is not reasonable to expect that parole would be granted during the intervening years." Ibid.
The policy enables the Board to put its resources to better
use, to ensure that those prisoners who should receive parole
come to its attention. By concentrating its efforts on those
cases identified as having a good possibility of early release,
the Board's Rules might result in the release of some prisoners earlier than would have been the case otherwise.

The particular case of respondent well illustrates that the
Board's Rule changes are designed for the better exercise of

Opinion of the Court
the discretion it had from the outset. Given respondent'scriminal history, including his escape from prison and the

commission of a second murder, it is difficult to see how theBoard increased the risk of his serving a longer time when
it decided that its parole review should be exercised after an8-year, not a 3-year, interval. Yet if such a risk develops,
respondent may, upon a showing of either "a change in [his]
circumstance[s]" or the Board's receipt of "new information,"seek an earlier review before the 8-year interval runs its

course.We do not accept the Court of Appeals' supposition that
Rule 475-3-.05(2) "seems certain" to result in some prisoners serving extended periods of incarceration. 164 F. 3d, at
595. The standard announced in Morales requires a more
rigorous analysis of the level of risk created by the change
in law. Cf. 514 U. S., at 506-507, n. 3 ("After Collins, the
focus of the ex post facto inquiry is not on whether a legislative change produces some ambiguous sort of `disadvantage' . . . but on whether any such change . . . increases the
penalty by which a crime is punishable"). When the rule
does not by its own terms show a significant risk, the respondent must demonstrate, by evidence drawn from the
rule's practical implementation by the agency charged with
exercising discretion, that its retroactive application will result in a longer period of incarceration than under the earlier
rule. The litigation in Morales concerned a statute covering inmates convicted of more than one homicide and proceeded on the assumption that there were no relevant differences between inmates for purposes of discerning whether
retroactive application of the amended California law violated the Ex Post Facto Clause. In the case before us, respondent must show that as applied to his own sentence the
law created a significant risk of increasing his punishment.
This remains the issue in the case, though the general operation of the Georgia parole system may produce relevant evidence and inform further analysis on the point.

256 GARNER v. JONES

Opinion of the Court
The record before the Court of Appeals contained littleinformation bearing on the level of risk created by the

change in law. Without knowledge of whether retroactiveapplication of the amendment to Rule 475-3-.05(2) increases,
to a significant degree, the likelihood or probability of pro-longing respondent's incarceration, his claim rests upon
speculation.

On the record in this case, we cannot conclude the changein Georgia law lengthened respondent's time of actual imprisonment. Georgia law vests broad discretion with theBoard, and our analysis rests upon the premise that the
Board exercises its discretion in accordance with its assessment of each inmate's likelihood of release between reconsideration dates. If the assessment later turns out not to hold
true for particular inmates, they may invoke the policy the
Parole Board has adopted to permit expedited consideration
in the event of a change in circumstances. App. 56.

The Court of Appeals erred in not considering the Board's
internal policy statement. At a minimum, policy statements, along with the Board's actual practices, provide important instruction as to how the Board interprets its enabling statute and regulations, and therefore whether, as a
matter of fact, the amendment to Rule 475-3-.05(2) created
a significant risk of increased punishment. It is often the
case that an agency's policies and practices will indicate the
manner in which it is exercising its discretion. Cf. INS v.
Yueh-Shaio Yang, 519 U. S. 26, 32 (1996) (observing that the
reasonableness of discretionary agency action can be gauged
by reference to the agency's policies and practices). The
Court of Appeals was incorrect to say the Board's policies
were of no relevance in this case. Absent a demonstration
to the contrary, we presume the Board follows its statutory
commands and internal policies in fulfilling its obligations.
Cf. United States ex rel. Accardi v. Shaugnessy, 347 U. S.
260, 266-268 (1954). In Morales, we relied upon the State's
representation that its parole board had a practice of grant529US1 Unit: $U40 [10-04-01 09:23:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Scalia, J., concurring in part in judgment
ing inmates' requests for early review. See 514 U. S., at512-513 (citing Reply Brief for Petitioner, O. T. 1994,

No. 93-1462, p. 3, n. 1). The policy statement here, by con-trast, is a formal, published statement as to how the Board
intends to enforce its Rule. It follows a fortiori from Morales that the Court of Appeals should not have disregarded
the policy. Absent any demonstration to the contrary from
respondent, we respect the Board's representation that in-mates, upon making a showing of a "change in their circumstance[s]" or upon the Board's receipt of "new information,"may request expedited consideration. App. 56.

The Court of Appeals' analysis failed to reveal whether theamendment to Rule 475-3-.05(2), in its operation, created
a significant risk of increased punishment for respondent.
Respondent claims he has not been permitted sufficient discovery to make this showing. The matter of adequate discovery is one for the Court of Appeals or, as need be, for the
District Court in the first instance. The judgment of the
Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for
proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice Scalia, concurring in part in the judgment.
I would agree with the Court's opinion if we were faced
with an amendment to the frequency of parole-eligibility determinations prescribed by the Georgia Legislature. Since
I do not believe, however, that a change in frequency prescribed by the Georgia State Board of Pardons and Paroles
(Board) would violate the Ex Post Facto Clause even if
it did pose a sufficient "risk" of decreasing the likelihood
of parole, I would reverse the decision of the Eleventh Circuit without the necessity of remand.

The Court treats this case as a mere variation on the Morales theme, whereas in reality it contains a critical difference: In Morales, the frequency of parole suitability hearings
had been fixed by law, and a legislative change had given

529US1 Unit: $U40 [10-04-01 09:23:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN
258 GARNER v. JONES

Scalia, J., concurring in part in judgment
California's Board of Prison Terms discretion to decrease thefrequency. See

California Dept. of Corrections v. Morales,
514 U. S. 499, 503 (1995); ante, at 250. Here, there has beenno such change. Today, as at the time of respondent's offense, the Georgia statute requires only that the Board pro-vide for automatic "periodic reconsideration," Ga. Code Ann.

$ 42-9-45 (1982). The length of the period, like the ultimate
question of parole, was and is entrusted to the Board'sdiscretion.

Any sensible application of the Ex Post Facto Clause, andany application faithful to its historical meaning, must draw
a distinction between the penalty that a person can anticipate for the commission of a particular crime, and opportunities for mercy or clemency that may go to the reduction of
the penalty. I know of no precedent for the proposition that
a defendant is entitled to the same degree of mercy or clemency that he could have expected at the time he committed
his offense. Under the traditional system of minimummaximum sentences (20 years to life, for example), it would
be absurd to argue that a defendant would have an ex post
facto claim if the compassionate judge who presided over the
district where he committed his crime were replaced, prior
to the defendant's trial, by a so-called "hanging judge."
Discretion to be compassionate or harsh is inherent in the
sentencing scheme, and being denied compassion is one of
the risks that the offender knowingly assumes.

At the margins, to be sure, it may be difficult to distinguish between justice and mercy. A statutory parole system that reduces a prisoner's sentence by fixed amounts of
time for good behavior during incarceration can realistically
be viewed as an entitlement--a reduction of the prescribed
penalty--rather than a discretionary grant of leniency. But
that is immeasurably far removed from the present case. In
Georgia parole, like pardon (which is granted or denied by
the same Board), is--and was at the time respondent committed his offense--a matter of grace. It may be denied for

Scalia, J., concurring in part in judgment
any reason (except, of course, an unlawful one such as race),or for no reason. And where, as here, the length of the reconsideration period is entrusted to the discretion of the
same body that has discretion over the ultimate parole determination, any risk engendered by changes to the lengthof that period is merely part of the uncertainty which was

inherent in the discretionary parole system, and to which
respondent subjected himself when he committed his crime.It makes no more sense to freeze in time the Board's discretion as to procedures than it does to freeze in time theBoard's discretion as to substance. Just as the

Ex Post
Facto Clause gives respondent no cause to complain that the
Board in place at the time of his offense has been replaced
by a new, tough-on-crime Board that is much more parsimonious with parole, it gives him no cause to complain that it
has been replaced by a new, big-on-efficiency Board that cuts
back on reconsiderations without cause. And the change in
policy is irrelevant, in my view, whether or not the preexisting policy happens to have been embodied in a policy
statement or regulation. To make the constitutional prohibition turn upon that feature would be to ignore reality and
to discourage measures that promote fairness and consistency. Such a policy statement or regulation, in the context
of a system conferring complete discretion as to substance
and as to the timing of hearings upon the Board, simply creates no reasonable expectation of entitlement, except perhaps among prisoners whose parole hearings are held (or are
scheduled to be held) while the regulation is in effect. This
is not an expectation of the sort that can give rise to ex post
facto concerns.

In essence, respondent complains that by exercising its
discretion (as to the frequency of review), the Board has deprived him of the exercise of its discretion (as to the question
of his release). In my view, these are two sides of the same
coin--two aspects of one and the same discretion--and respondent can have no valid grievance.

260 GARNER v. JONES

Souter, J., dissenting
Justice Souter, with whom Justice Stevens and
Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.

I think the Court of Appeals made no error here and sorespectfully dissent from the reversal. A change in parole

policy violates the Ex Post Facto Clause if it creates a "suf-ficient," California Dept. of Corrections v. Morales, 514
U. S. 499, 509 (1995), or substantial risk that the class af-fected by the change will serve longer sentences as a result.

1

To determine the likelihood that the change at issue herewill lengthen sentences, we need to look at the terms of the

new Rule, and then at the possibility that the terms are miti-gated by a practice of making exceptions.

Before the board changed its reconsideration Rule, a pris-oner would receive a second consideration for parole by year
10, whereas now the second consideration must occur onlyby year 15; those who would receive a third consideration
at year 13 will now have no certain consideration until year23, and so on. An example of the effect of the longer intervals between mandatory review can be seen by consideringthe average term served under the old Rule. In 1992, a
member of the Georgia Legislature stated that the averagelife-sentenced inmate served 12 years before parole. See
Spotts, Sentence and Punishment: Provide for the Impositionof Life Sentence Without Parole, 10 Ga. St. U. L. Rev. 183,
183, and n. 4 (1993). Some prisoners must have been pa1 In the first instance, at least, our cases have traditionally evaluated the
effect of the change on the class subject to the new rule, rather than
focusing solely on the individual challenging the change, Weaver v. Graham, 450 U. S. 24, 33 (1981). It can be difficult, if not impossible, for one
person to prove that a change in penal policy has increased the quantum
of punishment beyond what he would previously have received, since a
sentencing decision is often a mix of rules and discretion. See Lindsey v.
Washington, 301 U. S. 397, 401 (1937). At the same time, when one looks
at the affected class it can be quite clear that punishment has increased
overall. That is proof enough that the new Rule applied retroactively
violates the Ex Post Facto Clause and, as an invalid rule, should not be
applied to anyone within the class.

roled before 12 years. But those who would have been pa-roled when considered a second time at year 10 or a third

time at year 13 will now be delayed to year 15. While theaverage helps to show the effects Georgia's new Rule is
likely to have on some prisoners who would be released atthe early end of the parole spectrum, the changed Rule
threatens to increase punishment for all life-sentenced prisoners, not just those who would have been paroled at or be-fore the average time. If a prisoner who would have been

paroled on his fourth consideration in year 16 under the oldRule has to wait until his third consideration in year 23
under the new Rule, his punishment has been increased regardless of the average.

Georgia, which controls all of the relevant information, has
given us nothing to suggest the contrary. It has given us
no basis to isolate any subclass of life prisoners subject to
the change who were unlikely to be paroled before some review date at which consideration is guaranteed under the
new Rule. On the contrary, the terms of the Rule adopted
by the State define the affected class as the entire class of
life-sentenced prisoners, and the natural inference is that the
Rule affects prisoners throughout the whole class. This is
very different from the situation in Morales, in which it was
shown that 85% of the affected class were found unsuited for
parole upon reconsideration. Morales, supra, at 511. At
some point, common sense can lead to an inference of a substantial risk of increased punishment, and it does so here.

The significance of that conclusion is buttressed by statements by the board and its chairman, available at the board's
official website, indicating that its policies were intended
to increase time served in prison. See Georgia State Board
of Pardons and Paroles, News Releases, Policy Mandates
90% Prison Time for Certain Offenses (Jan. 2, 1998), http://

Paroles, Violent-Crime Lifers Who Died in Prison (June
4, 1998), http://www.pap.state.ga.us/pr 98.html (quoting
Chairman Walter Ray as stating that " `obtaining parole on
a life-sentence is increasingly rare' " and reporting that
"[b]ecause of strict sentencing laws as well as the Board's
conservative paroling policy, agency officials predict successive fiscal years will reflect a rising number of inmates for
whom a life sentence does indeed mean just that").2 If respondent had ever been allowed to undertake discovery, further statements of punitive intent may well have been forthcoming. Although we have never decided that a purpose to
increase punishment, absent a punitive effect, itself invalidates a retroactive policy change, see Lynce v. Mathis, 519
U. S. 433, 443 (1997), evidence of purpose certainly confirms
the inference of substantial risk of longer sentences drawn
above. It is, after all, reasonable to expect that members of
a parole board acting with a purpose to get tough succeed in
doing just that.

On the other side, there is no indication that the board
adopted the new policy merely to obviate useless hearings
or save administrative resources, the justification the Court
accepted in Morales. See 514 U. S., at 511. Indeed, since
a parole board review in Georgia means that one board member examines an inmate's file without a hearing and makes a
decision, and no specific findings are required to deny parole,
any interpretation of the rule change as a measure to conserve resources is weak at best, and insufficient to counter
the inference of a substantial risk that the prisoners who will
get subsequent mandatory parole considerations years after

the reviews that the old Rule would have guaranteed will infact serve longer sentences.

Thus, I believe the Eleventh Circuit properly grantedsummary judgment for respondent. Although Georgia argues that the board freely makes exceptions to the 8-yearRule in appropriate cases, the State provided no evidence
that the board's occasional willingness to reexamine casessufficiently mitigates the substantial probability of increased
punishment. While the majority accepts the argument that,even without evidence of practice, the board's discretion to
revisit its assignment of a reconsideration date may be suffi3 The majority suggests, ante, at 252, that the Court required no particular procedural safeguards in California Dept. of Corrections v. Morales,
even though the Court mentioned those safeguards as an important factor
in its conclusion that there was no increase in the quantum of punishment
in that case, see 514 U. S., at 511-512. This is true, but it does not address
the problem with Georgia's virtually unbounded scheme. Once the risk
of increased punishment exists, the board's nearly nonexistent safeguards
provide no way of reducing that risk.

Georgia insists that its lack of procedural safeguards is irrelevant to this
case, because due process does not require much in the way of procedural
safeguards for parole. But that is beside the point. The challenge here
is to the retroactive increase in the quantum of punishment. Unlike the
California procedure for delaying parole reconsideration in Morales, the
Georgia procedure here includes no actual hearing for the prisoner whose
reconsideration is delayed five extra years, and the board is not required
to explain itself. Georgia's procedural minimalism increases the likelihood that prisoners will get rubberstamp treatment, and decreases the
likelihood that the exceptions to the policy on which the majority relies
will actually be applied in a way that diminishes the significant probability
of increased punishment. Cf. Penson v. Ohio, 488 U. S. 75, 81-82, n. 4
(1988) (stating that a requirement to give written reasons provides an
inducement to make careful decisions in cases that might otherwise be
summarily ignored); Smith v. Robbins, 528 U. S. 259, 290-291 (2000) (Ste-
vens, J., dissenting) (noting that the process of writing out reasons for
decision improves the quality of the decision and can reveal error). Parole need not operate under rigidly defined procedures, but if the board
decides to make changes retroactive, it must do something to prevent
those changes from increasing punishment in violation of the Ex Post
Facto Clause.

Souter, J., dissenting
cient standing alone to preclude an ex post facto challenge,this is surely wrong. The policy statement on which the majority is willing to rely, see App. 56, gives a prisoner no as-surance that new information or changed circumstances will
matter, even assuming that prisoners are aware (and able totake advantage) of their limited ability to ask the board to
change its mind. Because in the end the board's ability toreconsider based on a "change in [a prisoner's] circumstance
or where the Board receives new information," ibid., is en-tirely discretionary, free of all standards, an 8-year period
before further consideration of parole made solely upon re-view of an inmate's file has to create a real risk of longer
confinement.A further word about the absence of record evidence of
practice under the new Rule is in order. One reason thatthere is none is that Georgia resisted discovery. In this
Court, it sought to compensate for the absence of favorableevidence by lodging documents recounting parole reconsiderations before the mandatory reconsideration date. Butevery instance occurred after the Eleventh Circuit had ruled
against the State.4 These examples of reconsiderations arethe parole equivalent of fixing the broken front steps after
the invited guest has slipped, fallen, and seen a lawyer; theydo nothing to show that the board's own interpretation of its
policy mitigated the risk of increased punishment.5

4 Georgia's statistics show only that, in fiscal year 1999, about 20% of
inmates received reconsideration dates of three years or less; about 10%
got reconsideration dates more than three years but less than eight, and
70% got 8-year dates. See App. to Reply Brief for Petitioners 9. Eighty
percent were therefore at least potentially negatively affected by the
change from a 3-year to an 8-year delay in reconsideration. Even on their
own terms, then, the statistics do not show that board policies mitigate
the substantial risk of increased punishment.

5 Indeed, as the board explains its decisionmaking procedures, "[t]he

overriding factor in determining whether or not to parole a person under
life sentence is the severity of the offense." Georgia Board of Pardons

I also dissent from the Court's failure to require discoveryon remand. At the very least, the record gives reason to

expect that discovery could show that the affected class hasbeen subjected to the risk of increased sentences. Morales
stressed that the question of what changes will be " `of suffi-cient moment to transgress the constitutional prohibition'
must be a matter of `degree,' " 514 U. S., at 509 (citation omit-ted) (emphasis in original). Even if I am wrong and respondent cannot prevail on this record, it is plain that furtherdiscovery is justified to determine the degree to which the

FLORIDA v. J. L.
certiorari to the supreme court of florida
No. 98-1993. Argued February 29, 2000--Decided March 28, 2000
After an anonymous caller reported to the Miami-Dade Police that a young

black male standing at a particular bus stop and wearing a plaid shirt
was carrying a gun, officers went to the bus stop and saw three black
males, one of whom, respondent J. L., was wearing a plaid shirt. Apart
from the tip, the officers had no reason to suspect any of the three of
illegal conduct. The officers did not see a firearm or observe any unusual movements. One of the officers frisked J. L. and seized a gun
from his pocket. J. L., who was then almost 16, was charged under
state law with carrying a concealed firearm without a license and possessing a firearm while under the age of 18. The trial court granted
his motion to suppress the gun as the fruit of an unlawful search. The
intermediate appellate court reversed, but the Supreme Court of Florida quashed that decision and held the search invalid under the Fourth
Amendment.

Held: An anonymous tip that a person is carrying a gun is not, without

more, sufficient to justify a police officer's stop and frisk of that person.
An officer, for the protection of himself and others, may conduct a carefully limited search for weapons in the outer clothing of persons engaged
in unusual conduct where, inter alia, the officer reasonably concludes in
light of his experience that criminal activity may be afoot and that the
persons in question may be armed and presently dangerous. Terry v.
Ohio, 392 U. S. 1, 30. Here, the officers' suspicion that J. L. was carrying a weapon arose not from their own observations but solely from a
call made from an unknown location by an unknown caller. The tip
lacked sufficient indicia of reliability to provide reasonable suspicion to
make a Terry stop: It provided no predictive information and therefore
left the police without means to test the informant's knowledge or credibility. See Alabama v. White, 496 U. S. 325, 327. The contentions of
Florida and the United States as amicus that the tip was reliable because it accurately described J. L.'s visible attributes misapprehend the
reliability needed for a tip to justify a Terry stop. The reasonable suspicion here at issue requires that a tip be reliable in its assertion of
illegality, not just in its tendency to identify a determinate person.
This Court also declines to adopt the argument that the standard Terry
analysis should be modified to license a "firearm exception," under
which a tip alleging an illegal gun would justify a stop and frisk even if

the accusation would fail standard pre-search reliability testing. The
facts of this case do not require the Court to speculate about the circumstances under which the danger alleged in an anonymous tip might be
so great--e. g., a report of a person carrying a bomb--as to justify a
search even without a showing of reliability. Pp. 269-274.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.
The question presented in this case is whether an anony-mous tip that a person is carrying a gun is, without more,

sufficient to justify a police officer's stop and frisk of thatperson. We hold that it is not.

particular bus stop and wearing a plaid shirt was carrying agun. App. to Pet. for Cert. A-40 to A-41. So far as the
record reveals, there is no audio recording of the tip, andnothing is known about the informant. Sometime after the
police received the tip--the record does not say how long--two officers were instructed to respond. They arrived at
the bus stop about six minutes later and saw three blackmales "just hanging out [there]." Id., at A-42. One of the
three, respondent J. L., was wearing a plaid shirt. Id., atA-41. Apart from the tip, the officers had no reason to suspect any of the three of illegal conduct. The officers did notsee a firearm, and J. L. made no threatening or otherwise
unusual movements. Id., at A-42 to A-44. One of the of-ficers approached J. L., told him to put his hands up on the
bus stop, frisked him, and seized a gun from J. L.'s pocket.The second officer frisked the other two individuals, against
whom no allegations had been made, and found nothing.

Opinion of the Court
J. L., who was at the time of the frisk "10 days shy of his16th birth[day]," Tr. of Oral Arg. 6, was charged under state

law with carrying a concealed firearm without a license andpossessing a firearm while under the age of 18. He moved
to suppress the gun as the fruit of an unlawful search, andthe trial court granted his motion. The intermediate appellate court reversed, but the Supreme Court of Floridaquashed that decision and held the search invalid under the
Fourth Amendment. 727 So. 2d 204 (1998).Anonymous tips, the Florida Supreme Court stated, are
generally less reliable than tips from known informants andcan form the basis for reasonable suspicion only if accompanied by specific indicia of reliability, for example, the correctforecast of a subject's " `not easily predicted' " movements.
Id., at 207 (quoting Alabama v. White, 496 U. S. 325, 332(1990)). The tip leading to the frisk of J. L., the court observed, provided no such predictions, nor did it contain anyother qualifying indicia of reliability. 727 So. 2d, at 207-208.
Two justices dissented. The safety of the police and thepublic, they maintained, justifies a "firearm exception" to the
general rule barring investigatory stops and frisks on thebasis of bare-boned anonymous tips. Id., at 214-215.

Seeking review in this Court, the State of Florida notedthat the decision of the State's Supreme Court conflicts with
decisions of other courts declaring similar searches compati-ble with the Fourth Amendment. See, e. g., United States
v. DeBerry, 76 F. 3d 884, 886-887 (CA7 1996); United Statesv. Clipper, 973 F. 2d 944, 951 (CADC 1992). We granted
certiorari, 528 U. S. 963 (1999), and now affirm the judgmentof the Florida Supreme Court.

II
Our "stop and frisk" decisions begin with Terry v. Ohio,392 U. S. 1 (1968). This Court held in

Terry:

"[W]here a police officer observes unusual conductwhich leads him reasonably to conclude in light of his

Opinion of the Court
experience that criminal activity may be afoot and thatthe persons with whom he is dealing may be armed and

presently dangerous, where in the course of investigat-ing this behavior he identifies himself as a policeman
and makes reasonable inquiries, and where nothing inthe initial stages of the encounter serves to dispel his
reasonable fear for his own or others' safety, he is enti-tled for the protection of himself and others in the area
to conduct a carefully limited search of the outer cloth-ing of such persons in an attempt to discover weapons
which might be used to assault him." Id., at 30.
In the instant case, the officers' suspicion that J. L. wascarrying a weapon arose not from any observations of their

own but solely from a call made from an unknown locationby an unknown caller. Unlike a tip from a known informant
whose reputation can be assessed and who can be held re-sponsible if her allegations turn out to be fabricated, see
Adams v. Williams, 407 U. S. 143, 146-147 (1972), "an anony-mous tip alone seldom demonstrates the informant's basis of
knowledge or veracity," Alabama v. White, 496 U. S., at 329.As we have recognized, however, there are situations in
which an anonymous tip, suitably corroborated, exhibits "suf-ficient indicia of reliability to provide reasonable suspicion to
make the investigatory stop." Id., at 327. The question wehere confront is whether the tip pointing to J. L. had those
indicia of reliability.In

White, the police received an anonymous tip assertingthat a woman was carrying cocaine and predicting that she

would leave an apartment building at a specified time, getinto a car matching a particular description, and drive to a
named motel. Ibid. Standing alone, the tip would not havejustified a Terry stop. 496 U. S., at 329. Only after police observation showed that the informant had accurately predictedthe woman's movements, we explained, did it become reasonable to think the tipster had inside knowledge about the sus-pect and therefore to credit his assertion about the cocaine.

Opinion of the Court
Id., at 332. Although the Court held that the suspicion in
White became reasonable after police surveillance, we regarded the case as borderline. Knowledge about a person'sfuture movements indicates some familiarity with that person's affairs, but having such knowledge does not necessarilyimply that the informant knows, in particular, whether that
person is carrying hidden contraband. We accordingly classified White as a "close case." Ibid.The tip in the instant case lacked the moderate indicia of

reliability present in White and essential to the Court's deci-sion in that case. The anonymous call concerning J. L. provided no predictive information and therefore left the police
without means to test the informant's knowledge or credibility. That the allegation about the gun turned out to be correct does not suggest that the officers, prior to the frisks,
had a reasonable basis for suspecting J. L. of engaging in
unlawful conduct: The reasonableness of official suspicion
must be measured by what the officers knew before they
conducted their search. All the police had to go on in this
case was the bare report of an unknown, unaccountable informant who neither explained how he knew about the gun
nor supplied any basis for believing he had inside information about J. L. If White was a close case on the reliability
of anonymous tips, this one surely falls on the other side of
the line.

Florida contends that the tip was reliable because its description of the suspect's visible attributes proved accurate:
There really was a young black male wearing a plaid shirt
at the bus stop. Brief for Petitioner 20-21. The United
States as amicus curiae makes a similar argument, proposing that a stop and frisk should be permitted "when (1) an
anonymous tip provides a description of a particular person
at a particular location illegally carrying a concealed firearm,
(2) police promptly verify the pertinent details of the tip except the existence of the firearm, and (3) there are no factors
that cast doubt on the reliability of the tip . . . ." Brief

529US1 Unit: $U41 [09-26-01 09:10:16] PAGES PGT: OPIN
272 FLORIDA v. J. L.

Opinion of the Court
for United States 16. These contentions misapprehend thereliability needed for a tip to justify a

Terry stop.
An accurate description of a subject's readily observablelocation and appearance is of course reliable in this limited

sense: It will help the police correctly identify the personwhom the tipster means to accuse. Such a tip, however,
does not show that the tipster has knowledge of concealed
criminal activity. The reasonable suspicion here at issue re-quires that a tip be reliable in its assertion of illegality, not

just in its tendency to identify a determinate person. Cf. 4W. LaFave, Search and Seizure $ 9.4(h), p. 213 (3d ed. 1996)
(distinguishing reliability as to identification, which is often
important in other criminal law contexts, from reliability as
to the likelihood of criminal activity, which is central in
anonymous-tip cases).

A second major argument advanced by Florida and the
United States as amicus is, in essence, that the standard
Terry analysis should be modified to license a "firearm exception." Under such an exception, a tip alleging an illegal
gun would justify a stop and frisk even if the accusation
would fail standard pre-search reliability testing. We decline to adopt this position.

Firearms are dangerous, and extraordinary dangers sometimes justify unusual precautions. Our decisions recognize
the serious threat that armed criminals pose to public safety;
Terry's rule, which permits protective police searches on the
basis of reasonable suspicion rather than demanding that officers meet the higher standard of probable cause, responds
to this very concern. See 392 U. S., at 30. But an automatic firearm exception to our established reliability analysis
would rove too far. Such an exception would enable any
person seeking to harass another to set in motion an intrusive, embarrassing police search of the targeted person simply by placing an anonymous call falsely reporting the
target's unlawful carriage of a gun. Nor could one securely
confine such an exception to allegations involving firearms.

Opinion of the Court
Several Courts of Appeals have held it per se foreseeablefor people carrying significant amounts of illegal drugs to be

carrying guns as well. See, e. g., United States v. Sakyi, 160F. 3d 164, 169 (CA4 1998);

United States v. Dean, 59 F. 3d
1479, 1490, n. 20 (CA5 1995); United States v. Odom, 13 F. 3d949, 959 (CA6 1994);

United States v. Martinez, 958 F. 2d
217, 219 (CA8 1992). If police officers may properly conduct
Terry frisks on the basis of bare-boned tips about guns, itwould be reasonable to maintain under the above-cited decisions that the police should similarly have discretion to friskbased on bare-boned tips about narcotics. As we clarified
when we made indicia of reliability critical in Adams and
White, the Fourth Amendment is not so easily satisfied. Cf.
Richards v. Wisconsin, 520 U. S. 385, 393-394 (1997) (reject-ing a

per se exception to the "knock and announce" rule for
narcotics cases partly because "the reasons for creating anexception in one category [of Fourth Amendment cases] can,

relatively easily, be applied to others," thus allowing the exception to swallow the rule).*

The facts of this case do not require us to speculate about
the circumstances under which the danger alleged in an
anonymous tip might be so great as to justify a search even
without a showing of reliability. We do not say, for example,
that a report of a person carrying a bomb need bear the

*At oral argument, petitioner also advanced the position that J. L.'s
youth made the stop and frisk valid, because it is a crime in Florida for
persons under the age of 21 to carry concealed firearms. See Fla. Stat.

$ 790.01 (1997) (carrying a concealed weapon without a license is a misdemeanor), $ 790.06(2)(b) (only persons aged 21 or older may be licensed to
carry concealed weapons). This contention misses the mark. Even assuming that the arresting officers could be sure that J. L. was under 21,
they would have had reasonable suspicion that J. L. was engaged in criminal activity only if they could be confident that he was carrying a gun in
the first place. The mere fact that a tip, if true, would describe illegal
activity does not mean that the police may make a Terry stop without
meeting the reliability requirement, and the fact that J. L. was under 21
in no way made the gun tip more reliable than if he had been an adult.

Kennedy, J., concurring
indicia of reliability we demand for a report of a person car-rying a firearm before the police can constitutionally conduct

a frisk. Nor do we hold that public safety officials in quar-ters where the reasonable expectation of Fourth Amendment
privacy is diminished, such as airports, see Florida v. Rodri-guez, 469 U. S. 1 (1984) (per curiam), and schools, see New
Jersey v. T. L. O., 469 U. S. 325 (1985), cannot conduct protec-tive searches on the basis of information insufficient to justify searches elsewhere.Finally, the requirement that an anonymous tip bear
standard indicia of reliability in order to justify a stop in noway diminishes a police officer's prerogative, in accord with
Terry, to conduct a protective search of a person who hasalready been legitimately stopped. We speak in today's decision only of cases in which the officer's authority to makethe initial stop is at issue. In that context, we hold that
an anonymous tip lacking indicia of reliability of the kindcontemplated in

Adams and White does not justify a stopand frisk whenever and however it alleges the illegal possession of a firearm.The judgment of the Florida Supreme Court is affirmed.

It is so ordered.
Justice Kennedy, with whom The Chief Justicejoins, concurring.

On the record created at the suppression hearing, theCourt's decision is correct. The Court says all that is necessary to resolve this case, and I join the opinion in all re-spects. It might be noted, however, that there are many
indicia of reliability respecting anonymous tips that we haveyet to explore in our cases.

When a police officer testifies that a suspect aroused theofficer's suspicion, and so justifies a stop and frisk, the courts
can weigh the officer's credibility and admit evidence seizedpursuant to the frisk even if no one, aside from the officer
and defendant themselves, was present or observed the sei529US1 Unit: $U41 [09-26-01 09:10:16] PAGES PGT: OPIN

zure. An anonymous telephone tip without more is differ-ent, however; for even if the officer's testimony about receipt

of the tip is found credible, there is a second layer of inquiryrespecting the reliability of the informant that cannot be pursued. If the telephone call is truly anonymous, the inform-ant has not placed his credibility at risk and can lie with
impunity. The reviewing court cannot judge the credibility of the informant and the risk of fabrication becomesunacceptable.

On this record, then, the Court is correct in holding thatthe telephone tip did not justify the arresting officer's immediate stop and frisk of respondent. There was testimony
that an anonymous tip came in by a telephone call and nothing more. The record does not show whether some notation
or other documentation of the call was made either by a voice
recording or tracing the call to a telephone number. The
prosecution recounted just the tip itself and the later verification of the presence of the three young men in the circumstances the Court describes.

It seems appropriate to observe that a tip might be anonymous in some sense yet have certain other features, either
supporting reliability or narrowing the likely class of informants, so that the tip does provide the lawful basis for some
police action. One such feature, as the Court recognizes, is
that the tip predicts future conduct of the alleged criminal.
There may be others. For example, if an unnamed caller
with a voice which sounds the same each time tells police on
two successive nights about criminal activity which in fact
occurs each night, a similar call on the third night ought not
be treated automatically like the tip in the case now before
us. In the instance supposed, there would be a plausible
argument that experience cures some of the uncertainty surrounding the anonymity, justifying a proportionate police response. In today's case, however, the State provides us with
no data about the reliability of anonymous tips. Nor do we
know whether the dispatcher or arresting officer had any

Kennedy, J., concurring
objective reason to believe that this tip had some particularindicia of reliability.

If an informant places his anonymity at risk, a court canconsider this factor in weighing the reliability of the tip. An
instance where a tip might be considered anonymous butnevertheless sufficiently reliable to justify a proportionate
police response may be when an unnamed person driving acar the police officer later describes stops for a moment and,
face to face, informs the police that criminal activity is occur-ring. This too seems to be different from the tip in the present case. See United States v. Sierra-Hernandez, 581 F. 2d760 (CA9 1978).

Instant caller identification is widely available to police,and, if anonymous tips are proving unreliable and distracting
to police, squad cars can be sent within seconds to the loca-tion of the telephone used by the informant. Voice recording of telephone tips might, in appropriate cases, be used bypolice to locate the caller. It is unlawful to make false reports to the police, e. g., Fla. Stat. Ann. $ 365.171(16) (Supp.2000); Fla. Stat. $ 817.49 (1994), and the ability of the police
to trace the identity of anonymous telephone informants maybe a factor which lends reliability to what, years earlier,
might have been considered unreliable anonymous tips.These matters, of course, must await discussion in other
cases, where the issues are presented by the record.

CITY OF ERIE et al. v. PAP'S A. M., tdba"KANDYLAND"
certiorari to the supreme court of pennsylvania

No. 98-1161. Argued November 10, 1999--Decided March 29, 2000
Erie, Pennsylvania, enacted an ordinance making it a summary offense

to knowingly or intentionally appear in public in a "state of nudity."
Respondent Pap's A. M. (hereinafter Pap's), a Pennsylvania corporation,
operated "Kandyland," an Erie establishment featuring totally nude
erotic dancing by women. To comply with the ordinance, these dancers
had to wear, at a minimum, "pasties" and a "G-string." Pap's filed suit
against Erie and city officials, seeking declaratory relief and a permanent injunction against the ordinance's enforcement. The Court of
Common Pleas struck down the ordinance as unconstitutional, but the
Commonwealth Court reversed. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court in
turn reversed, finding that the ordinance's public nudity sections violated Pap's right to freedom of expression as protected by the First
and Fourteenth Amendments. The Pennsylvania court held that nude
dancing is expressive conduct entitled to some quantum of protection
under the First Amendment, a view that the court noted was endorsed
by eight Members of this Court in Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501
U. S. 560. The Pennsylvania court explained that, although one stated
purpose of the ordinance was to combat negative secondary effects,
there was also an unmentioned purpose to "impact negatively on the
erotic message of the dance." Accordingly, the Pennsylvania court concluded that the ordinance was related to the suppression of expression.
Because the ordinance was not content neutral, it was subject to strict
scrutiny. The court held that the ordinance failed the narrow tailoring
requirement of strict scrutiny. After this Court granted certiorari,
Pap's filed a motion to dismiss the case as moot, noting that Kandyland
no longer operated as a nude dancing club, and that Pap's did not operate
such a club at any other location. This Court denied the motion.

Held: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
553 Pa. 348, 719 A. 2d 273, reversed and remanded.

Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court with respect
to Parts I and II, concluding that the case is not moot. A case is moot
when the issues presented are no longer "live" or the parties lack a
legally cognizable interest in the outcome. County of Los Angeles v.
Davis, 440 U. S. 625, 631. Simply closing Kandyland is not sufficient to
moot the case because Pap's is still incorporated under Pennsylvania

Syllabus
law, and could again decide to operate a nude dancing establishment in
Erie. Moreover, Pap's failed, despite its obligation to the Court, to
mention the potential mootness issue in its brief in opposition, which
was filed after Kandyland was closed and the property sold. See Board
of License Comm'rs of Tiverton v. Pastore, 469 U. S. 238, 240. In any
event, this is not a run of the mill voluntary cessation case. Here it is
the plaintiff who, having prevailed below, seeks to have the case declared moot. And it is the defendant city that seeks to invoke the federal judicial power to obtain this Court's review of the decision. Cf.
ASARCO Inc. v. Kadish, 490 U. S. 605, 617-618. The city has an ongoing injury because it is barred from enforcing the ordinance's public
nudity provisions. If the ordinance is found constitutional, then Erie
can enforce it, and the availability of such relief is sufficient to prevent
the case from being moot. See Church of Scientology of Cal. v. United
States, 506 U. S. 9, 13. And Pap's still has a concrete stake in the case's
outcome because, to the extent it has an interest in resuming operations,
it has an interest in preserving the judgment below. This Court's interest in preventing litigants from attempting to manipulate its jurisdiction
to insulate a favorable decision from review further counsels against a
finding of mootness. See, e. g., United States v. W. T. Grant Co., 345
U. S. 629, 632. Pp. 287-289.

Justice O'Connor, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice Ken-
nedy, and Justice Breyer, concluded in Parts III and IV that:

1. Government restrictions on public nudity such as Erie's ordinance
should be evaluated under the framework set forth in United States v.
O'Brien, 391 U. S. 367, for content-neutral restrictions on symbolic
speech. Although being "in a state of nudity" is not an inherently expressive condition, nude dancing of the type at issue here is expressive
conduct that falls within the outer ambit of the First Amendment's protection. See, e. g., Barnes, supra, at 565-566 (plurality opinion). What
level of scrutiny applies is determined by whether the ordinance is related to the suppression of expression. E. g., Texas v. Johnson, 491
U. S. 397, 403. If the governmental purpose in enacting the ordinance
is unrelated to such suppression, the ordinance need only satisfy the
"less stringent," intermediate O'Brien standard. E. g., Johnson, supra,
at 403. If the governmental interest is related to the expression's content, however, the ordinance falls outside O'Brien and must be justified
under the more demanding, strict scrutiny standard. Johnson, supra,
at 403. An almost identical public nudity ban was held not to violate
the First Amendment in Barnes, although no five Members of the Court
agreed on a single rationale for that conclusion. The ordinance here,
like the statute in Barnes, is on its face a general prohibition on public
nudity. By its terms, it regulates conduct alone. It does not target

Syllabus
nudity that contains an erotic message; rather, it bans all public nudity,
regardless of whether that nudity is accompanied by expressive activity.
Although Pap's contends that the ordinance is related to the suppression
of expression because its preamble suggests that its actual purpose is
to prohibit erotic dancing of the type performed at Kandyland, that is
not how the Pennsylvania Supreme Court interpreted that language.
Rather, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court construed the preamble to
mean that one purpose of the ordinance was to combat negative secondary effects. That is, the ordinance is aimed at combating crime and
other negative secondary effects caused by the presence of adult entertainment establishments like Kandyland, and not at suppressing the
erotic message conveyed by this type of nude dancing. See 391 U. S.,
at 382; see also Boos v. Barry, 485 U. S. 312, 321. The Pennsylvania
Supreme Court's ultimate conclusion that the ordinance was nevertheless content based relied on Justice White's position in dissent in Barnes
that a ban of this type necessarily has the purpose of suppressing the
erotic message of the dance. That view was rejected by a majority of
the Court in Barnes, and is here rejected again. Pap's argument that
the ordinance is "aimed" at suppressing expression through a ban on
nude dancing is really an argument that Erie also had an illicit motive
in enacting the ordinance. However, this Court will not strike down an
otherwise constitutional statute on the basis of an alleged illicit motive.
O'Brien, supra, at 382-383. Even if Erie's public nudity ban has some
minimal effect on the erotic message by muting that portion of the expression that occurs when the last stitch is dropped, the dancers at Kandyland and other such establishments are free to perform wearing pasties and G-strings. Any effect on the overall expression is therefore de
minimis. If States are to be able to regulate secondary effects, then
such de minimis intrusions on expression cannot be sufficient to render
the ordinance content based. See, e. g., Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence, 468 U. S. 288, 299. Thus, Erie's ordinance is valid
if it satisfies the O'Brien test. Pp. 289-296.

2. Erie's ordinance satisfies O'Brien's four-factor test. First, the ordinance is within Erie's constitutional power to enact because the city's
efforts to protect public health and safety are clearly within its police
powers. Second, the ordinance furthers the important government interests of regulating conduct through a public nudity ban and of combating the harmful secondary effects associated with nude dancing. In
terms of demonstrating that such secondary effects pose a threat, the
city need not conduct new studies or produce evidence independent of
that already generated by other cities, so long as the evidence relied on
is reasonably believed to be relevant to the problem addressed. Renton
v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U. S. 41, 51-52. Erie could reasonably

529US1 Unit: $U42 [10-11-01 11:58:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN
280 ERIE v. PAP'S A. M.

Syllabus
rely on the evidentiary foundation set forth in Renton and Young v.
American Mini Theatres, Inc., 427 U. S. 50, to the effect that secondary
effects are caused by the presence of even one adult entertainment establishment in a given neighborhood. See Renton, supra, at 51-52. In
fact, Erie expressly relied on Barnes and its discussion of secondary
effects, including its reference to Renton and American Mini Theatres.
The evidentiary standard described in Renton controls here, and Erie
meets that standard. In any event, the ordinance's preamble also relies
on the city council's express findings that "certain lewd, immoral activities carried on in public places for profit are highly detrimental to the
public health, safety and welfare . . . ." The council members, familiar
with commercial downtown Erie, are the individuals who would likely
have had firsthand knowledge of what took place at, and around, nude
dancing establishments there, and can make particularized, expert judgments about the resulting harmful secondary effects. Cf., e. g., FCC v.
National Citizens Comm. for Broadcasting, 436 U. S. 775. The fact
that this sort of leeway is appropriate in this case, which involves a
content-neutral restriction that regulates conduct, says nothing whatsoever about its appropriateness in a case involving actual regulation
of First Amendment expression. Also, although requiring dancers to
wear pasties and G-strings may not greatly reduce these secondary effects, O'Brien requires only that the regulation further the interest in
combating such effects. The ordinance also satisfies O'Brien's third
factor, that the government interest is unrelated to the suppression of
free expression, as discussed supra. The fourth O'Brien factor--that
the restriction is no greater than is essential to the furtherance of the
government interest--is satisfied as well. The ordinance regulates conduct, and any incidental impact on the expressive element of nude dancing is de minimis. The pasties and G-string requirement is a minimal
restriction in furtherance of the asserted government interests, and the
restriction leaves ample capacity to convey the dancer's erotic message.
See, e. g., Barnes, 501 U. S., at 572. Pp. 296-302.

Justice Scalia, joined by Justice Thomas, agreed that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's decision must be reversed, but disagreed with
the mode of analysis that should be applied. Erie self-consciously modeled its ordinance on the public nudity statute upheld in Barnes v. Glen
Theatre, Inc., 501 U. S. 560, calculating (one would have supposed reasonably) that the Pennsylvania courts would consider themselves bound
by this Court's judgment on a question of federal constitutional law.
That statute was constitutional not because it survived some lower level
of First Amendment scrutiny, but because, as a general law regulating
conduct and not specifically directed at expression, it was not subject to
First Amendment scrutiny at all. Id., at 572 (Scalia, J., concurring in

Syllabus
judgment). Erie's ordinance, too, by its terms prohibits not merely
nude dancing, but the act--irrespective of whether it is engaged in for
expressive purposes--of going nude in public. The facts that the preamble explains the ordinance's purpose, in part, as limiting a recent
increase in nude live entertainment, that city councilmembers in supporting the ordinance commented to that effect, and that the ordinance
includes in the definition of nudity the exposure of devices simulating
that condition, neither make the law any less general in its reach nor
demonstrate that what the municipal authorities really find objectionable is expression rather than public nakedness. That the city made no
effort to enforce the ordinance against a production of Equus involving
nudity that was being staged in Erie at the time the ordinance became
effective does not render the ordinance discriminatory on its face. The
assertion of the city's counsel in the trial court that the ordinance would
not cover theatrical productions to the extent their expressive activity
rose to a higher level of protected expression simply meant that the
ordinance would not be enforceable against such productions if the Constitution forbade it. That limitation does not cause the ordinance to be
not generally applicable, in the relevant sense of being targeted against
expressive conduct. Moreover, even if it could be concluded that Erie
specifically singled out the activity of nude dancing, the ordinance still
would not violate the First Amendment unless it could be proved (as on
this record it could not) that it was the communicative character of nude
dancing that prompted the ban. See id., at 577. There is no need to
identify "secondary effects" associated with nude dancing that Erie
could properly seek to eliminate. The traditional power of government
to foster good morals, and the acceptability of the traditional judgment
that nude public dancing itself is immoral, have not been repealed by
the First Amendment. Pp. 307-310.

Opinion of the Court
Pap's), which operated a nude dancing establishment in Erie,challenged the constitutionality of the ordinance and sought

a permanent injunction against its enforcement. The Penn-sylvania Supreme Court, although noting that this Court in
Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U. S. 560 (1991), had upheldan Indiana ordinance that was "strikingly similar" to Erie's,
found that the public nudity sections of the ordinance vio-lated respondent's right to freedom of expression under the
United States Constitution. 553 Pa. 348, 356, 719 A. 2d 273,277 (1998). This case raises the question whether the Pennsylvania Supreme Court properly evaluated the ordinance'sconstitutionality under the First Amendment. We hold that
Erie's ordinance is a content-neutral regulation that satisfiesthe four-part test of

United States v. O'Brien, 391 U. S. 367(1968). Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court and remand for the consideration ofany remaining issues.

I
On September 28, 1994, the city council for the city of Erie,Pennsylvania, enacted Ordinance 75-1994, a public indecency

ordinance that makes it a summary offense to knowinglyor intentionally appear in public in a "state of nudity."*

*Ordinance 75-1994, codified as Article 711 of the Codified Ordinances
of the city of Erie, provides in relevant part:

"1. A person who knowingly or intentionally, in a public place:
"a. engages in sexual intercourse
"b. engages in deviate sexual intercourse as defined by the Pennsylvania Crimes Code

"c. appears in a state of nudity, or
"d. fondles the genitals of himself, herself or another person commits
Public Indecency, a Summary Offense.

"2. "Nudity" means the showing of the human male or female genital
[sic], pubic area or buttocks with less than a fully opaque covering; the
showing of the female breast with less than a fully opaque covering of any
part of the nipple; the exposure of any device, costume, or covering which
gives the appearance of or simulates the genitals, pubic hair, natal cleft,

284 ERIE v. PAP'S A. M.

Opinion of the Court
Respondent Pap's, a Pennsylvania corporation, operated an
establishment in Erie known as "Kandyland" that featured
totally nude erotic dancing performed by women. To comply with the ordinance, these dancers must wear, at a minimum, "pasties" and a "G-string." On October 14, 1994,
two days after the ordinance went into effect, Pap's filed a
complaint against the city of Erie, the mayor of the city, and
members of the city council, seeking declaratory relief and
a permanent injunction against the enforcement of the
ordinance.

The Court of Common Pleas of Erie County granted the
permanent injunction and struck down the ordinance as
unconstitutional. Civ. No. 60059-1994 (Jan. 18, 1995), Pet.
for Cert. 40a. On cross appeals, the Commonwealth Court
reversed the trial court's order. 674 A. 2d 338 (1996).

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court granted review and reversed, concluding that the public nudity provisions of the
ordinance violated respondent's rights to freedom of expression as protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.
553 Pa. 348, 719 A. 2d 273 (1998). The Pennsylvania court
first inquired whether nude dancing constitutes expressive
conduct that is within the protection of the First Amendment. The court noted that the act of being nude, in and of

perineum anal region or pubic hair region; or the exposure of any device
worn as a cover over the nipples and/or areola of the female breast, which
device simulates and gives the realistic appearance of nipples and/or
areola.

"3. "Public Place" includes all outdoor places owned by or open to the
general public, and all buildings and enclosed places owned by or open to
the general public, including such places of entertainment, taverns, restaurants, clubs, theaters, dance halls, banquet halls, party rooms or halls
limited to specific members, restricted to adults or to patrons invited to
attend, whether or not an admission charge is levied.

"4. The prohibition set forth in subsection 1(c) shall not apply to:
"a. Any child under ten (10) years of age; or
"b. Any individual exposing a breast in the process of breastfeeding an
infant under two (2) years of age."

Opinion of the Court
itself, is not entitled to First Amendment protection becauseit conveys no message.

Id., at 354, 719 A. 2d, at 276. Nude
dancing, however, is expressive conduct that is entitled tosome quantum of protection under the First Amendment, a

view that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court noted wasendorsed by eight Members of this Court in

Barnes. 553
Pa., at 354, 719 A. 2d, at 276.

The Pennsylvania court next inquired whether the govern-ment interest in enacting the ordinance was content neutral,

explaining that regulations that are unrelated to the sup-pression of expression are not subject to strict scrutiny but
to the less stringent standard of United States v. O'Brien,
supra, at 377. To answer the question whether the ordinance is content based, the court turned to our decision in
Barnes. 553 Pa., at 355-356, 719 A. 2d, at 277. Although
the Pennsylvania court noted that the Indiana statute at
issue in Barnes "is strikingly similar to the Ordinance we
are examining," it concluded that "[u]nfortunately for our
purposes, the Barnes Court splintered and produced four
separate, non-harmonious opinions." 553 Pa., at 356, 719
A. 2d, at 277. After canvassing these separate opinions, the
Pennsylvania court concluded that, although it is permissible
to find precedential effect in a fragmented decision, to do so
a majority of the Court must have been in agreement on the
concept that is deemed to be the holding. See Marks v.
United States, 430 U. S. 188 (1977). The Pennsylvania court
noted that "aside from the agreement by a majority of the
Barnes Court that nude dancing is entitled to some First
Amendment protection, we can find no point on which a majority of the Barnes Court agreed." 553 Pa., at 358, 719
A. 2d, at 278. Accordingly, the court concluded that "no
clear precedent arises out of Barnes on the issue of whether
the [Erie] ordinance . . . passes muster under the First
Amendment." Ibid.

Having determined that there was no United States
Supreme Court precedent on point, the Pennsylvania court

529US1 Unit: $U42 [10-11-01 11:58:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN
286 ERIE v. PAP'S A. M.

Opinion of the Court
conducted an independent examination of the ordinance toascertain whether it was related to the suppression of expression. The court concluded that although one of the pur-poses of the ordinance was to combat negative secondary
effects, "[i]nextricably bound up with this stated purpose isan unmentioned purpose . . . to impact negatively on the
erotic message of the dance." Id., at 359, 719 A. 2d, at 279.
As such, the court determined the ordinance was contentbased and subject to strict scrutiny. The ordinance failed

the narrow tailoring requirement of strict scrutiny becausethe court found that imposing criminal and civil sanctions on
those who commit sex crimes would be a far narrower means
of combating secondary effects than the requirement that
dancers wear pasties and G-strings. Id., at 361-362, 719
A. 2d, at 280.

Concluding that the ordinance unconstitutionally burdened
respondent's expressive conduct, the Pennsylvania court
then determined that, under Pennsylvania law, the public nudity provisions of the ordinance could be severed rather than
striking the ordinance in its entirety. Accordingly, the court
severed $$ 1(c) and 2 from the ordinance and reversed the
order of the Commonwealth Court. Id., at 363-364, 719
A. 2d, at 281. Because the court determined that the public
nudity provisions of the ordinance violated Pap's right to
freedom of expression under the United States Constitution,
it did not address the constitutionality of the ordinance
under the Pennsylvania Constitution or the claim that the
ordinance is unconstitutionally overbroad. Ibid.

In a separate concurrence, two justices of the Pennsylvania
court noted that, because this Court upheld a virtually identical statute in Barnes, the ordinance should have been upheld under the United States Constitution. 553 Pa., at 364,
719 A. 2d, at 281. They reached the same result as the majority, however, because they would have held that the public
nudity sections of the ordinance violate the Pennsylvania
Constitution. Id., at 370, 719 A. 2d, at 284.

Opinion of the Court
The city of Erie petitioned for a writ of certiorari, whichwe granted. 526 U. S. 1111 (1999). Shortly thereafter,

Pap's filed a motion to dismiss the case as moot, noting thatKandyland was no longer operating as a nude dancing club,
and Pap's was not operating a nude dancing club at any otherlocation. Respondent's Motion to Dismiss as Moot 1. We
denied the motion. 527 U. S. 1034 (1999).

II
As a preliminary matter, we must address the justiciabil-ity question. " `[A] case is moot when the issues presented

are no longer "live" or the parties lack a legally cognizableinterest in the outcome.' " County of Los Angeles v. Davis,
440 U. S. 625, 631 (1979) (quoting Powell v. McCormack, 395U. S. 486, 496 (1969)). The underlying concern is that, when
the challenged conduct ceases such that " `there is no reason-able expectation that the wrong will be repeated,' " United
States v. W. T. Grant Co., 345 U. S. 629, 633 (1953), then itbecomes impossible for the court to grant " `any effectual relief whatever' to [the] prevailing party," Church of Scien-tology of Cal. v. United States, 506 U. S. 9, 12 (1992) (quoting
Mills v. Green, 159 U. S. 651, 653 (1895)). In that case, anyopinion as to the legality of the challenged action would be
advisory.Here, Pap's submitted an affidavit stating that it had
"ceased to operate a nude dancing establishment in Erie."Status Report Re Potential Issue of Mootness 1 (Sept. 8,
1999). Pap's asserts that the case is therefore moot because"[t]he outcome of this case will have no effect upon Respondent." Respondent's Motion to Dismiss as Moot 1. Simplyclosing Kandyland is not sufficient to render this case moot,
however. Pap's is still incorporated under Pennsylvania law,and it could again decide to operate a nude dancing establishment in Erie. See Petitioner's Brief in Opposition to Motionto Dismiss 3. J

ustice Scalia differs with our assessmentas to the likelihood that Pap's may resume its nude dancing

Opinion of the Court
operation. Several Members of this Court can attest, however, that the "advanced age" of Pap's owner (72) does not
make it "absolutely clear" that a life of quiet retirement is
his only reasonable expectation. Cf. Friends of Earth, Inc.
v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., 528 U. S.
167 (2000). Moreover, our appraisal of Pap's affidavit is influenced by Pap's failure, despite its obligation to the Court,
to mention a word about the potential mootness issue in its
brief in opposition to the petition for writ of certiorari, which
was filed in April 1999, even though, as Justice Scalia
points out, Kandyland was closed and that property sold in
1998. See Board of License Comm'rs of Tiverton v. Pastore, 469 U. S. 238, 240 (1985) (per curiam). Pap's only
raised the issue after this Court granted certiorari.

In any event, this is not a run of the mill voluntary cessation case. Here it is the plaintiff who, having prevailed
below, now seeks to have the case declared moot. And it is
the city of Erie that seeks to invoke the federal judicial
power to obtain this Court's review of the Pennsylvania
Supreme Court decision. Cf. ASARCO Inc. v. Kadish, 490
U. S. 605, 617-618 (1989). The city has an ongoing injury
because it is barred from enforcing the public nudity provisions of its ordinance. If the challenged ordinance is found
constitutional, then Erie can enforce it, and the availability
of such relief is sufficient to prevent the case from being
moot. See Church of Scientology of Cal. v. United States,
supra, at 13. And Pap's still has a concrete stake in the
outcome of this case because, to the extent Pap's has an interest in resuming operations, it has an interest in preserving the judgment of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. Our
interest in preventing litigants from attempting to manipulate the Court's jurisdiction to insulate a favorable decision
from review further counsels against a finding of mootness
here. See United States v. W. T. Grant Co., supra, at 632;
cf. Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520 U. S. 43,

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
74 (1997). Although the issue is close, we conclude that thecase is not moot, and we turn to the merits.

III
Being "in a state of nudity" is not an inherently expressivecondition. As we explained in Barnes, however, nude dancing of the type at issue here is expressive conduct, althoughwe think that it falls only within the outer ambit of the First
Amendment's protection. See Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc.,501 U. S., at 565-566 (plurality opinion); Schad v. Mount
Ephraim, 452 U. S. 61, 66 (1981).To determine what level of scrutiny applies to the ordinance at issue here, we must decide "whether the State'sregulation is related to the suppression of expression."
Texas v. Johnson, 491 U. S. 397, 403 (1989); see also United
States v. O'Brien, 391 U. S., at 377. If the governmentalpurpose in enacting the regulation is unrelated to the suppression of expression, then the regulation need only satisfythe "less stringent" standard from O'Brien for evaluating
restrictions on symbolic speech. Texas v. Johnson, supra,at 403; United States v. O'Brien, supra, at 377. If the government interest is related to the content of the expression,however, then the regulation falls outside the scope of the
O'Brien test and must be justified under a more demandingstandard.

Texas v. Johnson, supra, at 403.In Barnes, we analyzed an almost identical statute, holding

that Indiana's public nudity ban did not violate the FirstAmendment, although no five Members of the Court agreed
on a single rationale for that conclusion. We now clarifythat government restrictions on public nudity such as the
ordinance at issue here should be evaluated under the frame-work set forth in O'Brien for content-neutral restrictions on
symbolic speech.The city of Erie argues that the ordinance is a contentneutral restriction that is reviewable under O'Brien becausethe ordinance bans conduct, not speech; specifically, public

290 ERIE v. PAP'S A. M.

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
nudity. Respondent counters that the ordinance targetsnude dancing and, as such, is aimed specifically at suppressing expression, making the ordinance a content-based re-striction that must be subjected to strict scrutiny.

The ordinance here, like the statute in Barnes, is on itsface a general prohibition on public nudity. 553 Pa., at 354,
719 A. 2d, at 277. By its terms, the ordinance regulatesconduct alone. It does not target nudity that contains an
erotic message; rather, it bans all public nudity, regardlessof whether that nudity is accompanied by expressive activity.
And like the statute in Barnes, the Erie ordinance replacesand updates provisions of an "Indecency and Immorality" ordinance that has been on the books since 1866, predating theprevalence of nude dancing establishments such as Kandyland. Pet. for Cert. 7a; see Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc.,
supra, at 568.Respondent and

Justice Stevens contend nonethelessthat the ordinance is related to the suppression of expression

because language in the ordinance's preamble suggests thatits actual purpose is to prohibit erotic dancing of the type
performed at Kandyland. Post, at 318 (dissenting opinion).That is not how the Pennsylvania Supreme Court interpreted that language, however. In the preamble to the or-dinance, the city council stated that it was adopting the
regulation

" `for the purpose of limiting a recent increase in nudelive entertainment within the City, which activity adversely impacts and threatens to impact on the publichealth, safety and welfare by providing an atmosphere
conducive to violence, sexual harassment, public intoxi-cation, prostitution, the spread of sexually transmitted
diseases and other deleterious effects.' " 553 Pa., at359, 719 A. 2d, at 279.

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court construed this languageto mean that one purpose of the ordinance was "to combat
negative secondary effects." Ibid.

529US1 Unit: $U42 [10-11-01 11:58:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN

291Cite as: 529 U. S. 277 (2000)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
As Justice Souter noted in Barnes, "on its face, the gov-ernmental interest in combating prostitution and other criminal activity is not at all inherently related to expression."501 U. S., at 585 (opinion concurring in judgment). In that
sense, this case is similar to O'Brien. O'Brien burned hisdraft registration card as a public statement of his antiwar
views, and he was convicted under a statute making it a
crime to knowingly mutilate or destroy such a card. ThisCourt rejected his claim that the statute violated his First

Amendment rights, reasoning that the law punished him forthe "noncommunicative impact of his conduct, and for nothing else." 391 U. S., at 382. In other words, the Government regulation prohibiting the destruction of draft cards
was aimed at maintaining the integrity of the Selective Service System and not at suppressing the message of draft resistance that O'Brien sought to convey by burning his draft
card. So too here, the ordinance prohibiting public nudity
is aimed at combating crime and other negative secondary
effects caused by the presence of adult entertainment establishments like Kandyland and not at suppressing the
erotic message conveyed by this type of nude dancing. Put
another way, the ordinance does not attempt to regulate the
primary effects of the expression, i. e., the effect on the audience of watching nude erotic dancing, but rather the secondary effects, such as the impacts on public health, safety, and
welfare, which we have previously recognized are "caused
by the presence of even one such" establishment. Renton
v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U. S. 41, 47-48, 50 (1986); see
also Boos v. Barry, 485 U. S. 312, 321 (1988).

Although the Pennsylvania Supreme Court acknowledged
that one goal of the ordinance was to combat the negative
secondary effects associated with nude dancing establishments, the court concluded that the ordinance was nevertheless content based, relying on Justice White's position in
dissent in Barnes for the proposition that a ban of this type
necessarily has the purpose of suppressing the erotic mes529US1 Unit: $U42 [10-11-01 11:58:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN
292 ERIE v. PAP'S A. M.

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
sage of the dance. Because the Pennsylvania court agreedwith Justice White's approach, it concluded that the ordinance must have another, "unmentioned" purpose related tothe suppression of expression. 553 Pa., at 359, 719 A. 2d, at
279. That is, the Pennsylvania court adopted the dissent'sview in

Barnes that " `[s]ince the State permits the dancers
to perform if they wear pasties and G-strings but forbids
nude dancing, it is precisely because of the distinctive, ex-pressive content of the nude dancing performances at issue

in this case that the State seeks to apply the statutory prohi-bition." 553 Pa., at 359, 719 A. 2d, at 279 (quoting

Barnes,
supra, at 592 (White, J., dissenting)). A majority of the
Court rejected that view in Barnes, and we do so again here.

Respondent's argument that the ordinance is "aimed" at
suppressing expression through a ban on nude dancing--an
argument that respondent supports by pointing to statements by the city attorney that the public nudity ban was
not intended to apply to "legitimate" theater productions--
is really an argument that the city council also had an illicit
motive in enacting the ordinance. As we have said before,
however, this Court will not strike down an otherwise constitutional statute on the basis of an alleged illicit motive.
O'Brien, supra, at 382-383; Renton v. Playtime Theatres,
Inc., supra, at 47-48 (that the "predominate" purpose of the
statute was to control secondary effects was "more than adequate to establish" that the city's interest was unrelated to
the suppression of expression). In light of the Pennsylvania
court's determination that one purpose of the ordinance is to
combat harmful secondary effects, the ban on public nudity
here is no different from the ban on burning draft registration cards in O'Brien, where the Government sought to prevent the means of the expression and not the expression of
antiwar sentiment itself.

Justice Stevens argues that the ordinance enacts a
complete ban on expression. We respectfully disagree with
that characterization. The public nudity ban certainly has

529US1 Unit: $U42 [10-11-01 11:58:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN

293Cite as: 529 U. S. 277 (2000)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
the effect of limiting one particular means of expressing thekind of erotic message being disseminated at Kandyland.

But simply to define what is being banned as the "message"is to assume the conclusion. We did not analyze the regulation in O'Brien as having enacted a total ban on expression.Instead, the Court recognized that the regulation against destroying one's draft card was justified by the Government's
interest in preventing the harmful "secondary effects" ofthat conduct (disruption to the Selective Service System),

even though that regulation may have some incidental effecton the expressive element of the conduct. Because this justification was unrelated to the suppression of O'Brien's antiwar message, the regulation was content neutral. Although
there may be cases in which banning the means of expression
so interferes with the message that it essentially bans the
message, that is not the case here.

Even if we had not already rejected the view that a ban
on public nudity is necessarily related to the suppression of
the erotic message of nude dancing, we would do so now
because the premise of such a view is flawed. The State's
interest in preventing harmful secondary effects is not related to the suppression of expression. In trying to control
the secondary effects of nude dancing, the ordinance seeks
to deter crime and the other deleterious effects caused by
the presence of such an establishment in the neighborhood.
See Renton, supra, at 50-51. In Clark v. Community for
Creative Non-Violence, 468 U. S. 288 (1984), we held that
a National Park Service regulation prohibiting camping in
certain parks did not violate the First Amendment when applied to prohibit demonstrators from sleeping in Lafayette
Park and the Mall in Washington, D. C., in connection with
a demonstration intended to call attention to the plight of
the homeless. Assuming, arguendo, that sleeping can be expressive conduct, the Court concluded that the Government
interest in conserving park property was unrelated to the
demonstrators' message about homelessness. Id., at 299.

529US1 Unit: $U42 [10-11-01 11:58:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN
294 ERIE v. PAP'S A. M.

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
So, while the demonstrators were allowed to erect "symbolictent cities," they were not allowed to sleep overnight in

those tents. Even though the regulation may have directlylimited the expressive element involved in actually sleeping
in the park, the regulation was nonetheless content neutral.Similarly, even if Erie's public nudity ban has some minimal effect on the erotic message by muting that portion of
the expression that occurs when the last stitch is dropped,the dancers at Kandyland and other such establishments are

free to perform wearing pasties and G-strings. Any effecton the overall expression is

de minimis. And as Justice
Stevens eloquently stated for the plurality in Young v.
American Mini Theatres, Inc., 427 U. S. 50, 70 (1976), "even
though we recognize that the First Amendment will not tolerate the total suppression of erotic materials that have
some arguably artistic value, it is manifest that society's interest in protecting this type of expression is of a wholly
different, and lesser, magnitude than the interest in untrammeled political debate," and "few of us would march our sons
and daughters off to war to preserve the citizen's right to
see" specified anatomical areas exhibited at establishments
like Kandyland. If States are to be able to regulate secondary effects, then de minimis intrusions on expression such
as those at issue here cannot be sufficient to render the ordinance content based. See Clark v. Community for Creative
Non-Violence, supra, at 299; Ward v. Rock Against Racism,
491 U. S. 781, 791 (1989) (even if regulation has an incidental
effect on some speakers or messages but not others, the regulation is content neutral if it can be justified without reference to the content of the expression).

This case is, in fact, similar to O'Brien, Community for
Creative Non-Violence, and Ward. The justification for the
government regulation in each case prevents harmful "secondary" effects that are unrelated to the suppression of expression. See, e. g., Ward v. Rock Against Racism, supra,
at 791-792 (noting that "[t]he principal justification for the

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
sound-amplification guideline is the city's desire to controlnoise levels at bandshell events, in order to retain the character of the [adjacent] Sheep Meadow and its more sedateactivities," and citing

Renton for the proposition that "[a]
regulation that serves purposes unrelated to the content ofexpression is deemed neutral, even if it has an incidental

effect on some speakers or messages but not others").
While the doctrinal theories behind "incidental burdens" and"secondary effects" are, of course, not identical, there is nothing objectionable about a city passing a general ordinance toban public nudity (even though such a ban may place incidental burdens on some protected speech) and at the same time
recognizing that one specific occurrence of public nudity--
nude erotic dancing--is particularly problematic because it
produces harmful secondary effects.

Justice Stevens claims that today we "[f]or the first
time" extend Renton's secondary effects doctrine to justify
restrictions other than the location of a commercial enterprise. Post, at 317 (dissenting opinion). Our reliance on
Renton to justify other restrictions is not new, however. In
Ward, the Court relied on Renton to evaluate restrictions on
sound amplification at an outdoor bandshell, rejecting the
dissent's contention that Renton was inapplicable. See
Ward v. Rock Against Racism, supra, at 804, n. 1 (Marshall,
J., dissenting) ("Today, for the first time, a majority of the
Court applies Renton analysis to a category of speech far
afield from that decision's original limited focus"). Moreover, Erie's ordinance does not effect a "total ban" on protected expression. Post, at 319.

In Renton, the regulation explicitly treated "adult" movie
theaters differently from other theaters, and defined "adult"
theaters solely by reference to the content of their movies.
475 U. S., at 44. We nonetheless treated the zoning regulation as content neutral because the ordinance was aimed at
the secondary effects of adult theaters, a justification unrelated to the content of the adult movies themselves. Id., at

296 ERIE v. PAP'S A. M.

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
48. Here, Erie's ordinance is on its face a content-neutralrestriction on conduct. Even if the city thought that nude

dancing at clubs like Kandyland constituted a particularlyproblematic instance of public nudity, the regulation is still
properly evaluated as a content-neutral restriction becausethe interest in combating the secondary effects associated
with those clubs is unrelated to the suppression of the eroticmessage conveyed by nude dancing.

We conclude that Erie's asserted interest in combating thenegative secondary effects associated with adult entertainment establishments like Kandyland is unrelated to the sup-pression of the erotic message conveyed by nude dancing.
The ordinance prohibiting public nudity is therefore valid ifit satisfies the four-factor test from

O'Brien for evaluatingrestrictions on symbolic speech.

IV
Applying that standard here, we conclude that Erie's ordi-nance is justified under O'Brien. The first factor of the

O'Brien test is whether the government regulation is withinthe constitutional power of the government to enact. Here,
Erie's efforts to protect public health and safety are clearlywithin the city's police powers. The second factor is
whether the regulation furthers an important or substantialgovernment interest. The asserted interests of regulating
conduct through a public nudity ban and of combating theharmful secondary effects associated with nude dancing are
undeniably important. And in terms of demonstrating thatsuch secondary effects pose a threat, the city need not "conduct new studies or produce evidence independent of thatalready generated by other cities" to demonstrate the problem of secondary effects, "so long as whatever evidence thecity relies upon is reasonably believed to be relevant to the
problem that the city addresses." Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., supra, at 51-52. Because the nude dancing atKandyland is of the same character as the adult entertain529US1 Unit: $U42 [10-11-01 11:58:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ment at issue in Renton, Young v. American Mini Theatres,
Inc., 427 U. S. 50 (1976), and California v. LaRue, 409 U. S.
109 (1972), it was reasonable for Erie to conclude that suchnude dancing was likely to produce the same secondary effects. And Erie could reasonably rely on the evidentiaryfoundation set forth in

Renton and American Mini Theatres
to the effect that secondary effects are caused by the presence of even one adult entertainment establishment in agiven neighborhood. See

Renton v. Playtime Theatres,
Inc., supra, at 51-52 (indicating that reliance on a judicialopinion that describes the evidentiary basis is sufficient). In

fact, Erie expressly relied on Barnes and its discussion of
secondary effects, including its reference to Renton and
American Mini Theatres. Even in cases addressing regulations that strike closer to the core of First Amendment
values, we have accepted a state or local government's reasonable belief that the experience of other jurisdictions
is relevant to the problem it is addressing. See Nixon v.
Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U. S. 377, 393, n. 6
(2000). Regardless of whether Justice Souter now wishes
to disavow his opinion in Barnes on this point, see post, at
316-317 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part),
the evidentiary standard described in Renton controls here,
and Erie meets that standard.

In any event, Erie also relied on its own findings. The
preamble to the ordinance states that "the Council of the
City of Erie has, at various times over more than a century,
expressed its findings that certain lewd, immoral activities
carried on in public places for profit are highly detrimental
to the public health, safety and welfare, and lead to the debasement of both women and men, promote violence, public
intoxication, prostitution and other serious criminal activity." Pet. for Cert. 6a (emphasis added). The city council
members, familiar with commercial downtown Erie, are the
individuals who would likely have had firsthand knowledge
of what took place at and around nude dancing establish529US1 Unit: $U42 [10-11-01 11:58:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN
298 ERIE v. PAP'S A. M.

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
ments in Erie, and can make particularized, expert judg-ments about the resulting harmful secondary effects. Analogizing to the administrative agency context, it is wellestablished that, as long as a party has an opportunity to
respond, an administrative agency may take official notice ofsuch "legislative facts" within its special knowledge, and is
not confined to the evidence in the record in reaching its
expert judgment. See FCC v. National Citizens Comm.
for Broadcasting, 436 U. S. 775 (1978); Republic Aviation
Corp. v. NLRB, 324 U. S. 793 (1945); 2 K. Davis & R. Pierce,Administrative Law Treatise $ 10.6 (3d ed. 1994). Here,

Kandyland has had ample opportunity to contest the council's
findings about secondary effects--before the council itself,
throughout the state proceedings, and before this Court.
Yet to this day, Kandyland has never challenged the city
council's findings or cast any specific doubt on the validity
of those findings. Instead, it has simply asserted that the
council's evidentiary proof was lacking. In the absence of
any reason to doubt it, the city's expert judgment should be
credited. And the study relied on by amicus curiae does
not cast any legitimate doubt on the Erie city council's judgment about Erie. See Brief for First Amendment Lawyers
Association as Amicus Curiae 16-23.

Finally, it is worth repeating that Erie's ordinance is on
its face a content-neutral restriction that regulates conduct,
not First Amendment expression. And the government
should have sufficient leeway to justify such a law based on
secondary effects. On this point, O'Brien is especially instructive. The Court there did not require evidence that
the integrity of the Selective Service System would be jeopardized by the knowing destruction or mutilation of draft
cards. It simply reviewed the Government's various administrative interests in issuing the cards, and then concluded
that "Congress has a legitimate and substantial interest in
preventing their wanton and unrestrained destruction and
assuring their continuing availability by punishing people

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
who knowingly and willfully destroy or mutilate them." 391
U. S., at 378-380. There was no study documenting instances of draft card mutilation or the actual effect of such
mutilation on the Government's asserted efficiency interests.
But the Court permitted Congress to take official notice, as
it were, that draft card destruction would jeopardize the system. The fact that this sort of leeway is appropriate in a
case involving conduct says nothing whatsoever about its appropriateness in a case involving actual regulation of First
Amendment expression. As we have said, so long as the
regulation is unrelated to the suppression of expression,
"[t]he government generally has a freer hand in restricting
expressive conduct than it has in restricting the written or
spoken word." Texas v. Johnson, 491 U. S., at 406. See,
e. g., United States v. O'Brien, supra, at 377; United States
v. Albertini, 472 U. S. 675, 689 (1985) (finding sufficient the
Government's assertion that those who had previously been
barred from entering the military installation pose a threat
to the security of that installation); Clark v. Community for
Creative Non-Violence, 468 U. S., at 299 (finding sufficient
the Government's assertion that camping overnight in the
park poses a threat to park property).

Justice Souter, however, would require Erie to develop
a specific evidentiary record supporting its ordinance. Post,
at 317 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part).
Justice Souter agrees that Erie's interest in combating the
negative secondary effects associated with nude dancing establishments is a legitimate government interest unrelated
to the suppression of expression, and he agrees that the
ordinance should therefore be evaluated under O'Brien.
O'Brien, of course, required no evidentiary showing at all
that the threatened harm was real. But that case is different, Justice Souter contends, because in O'Brien "there
could be no doubt" that a regulation prohibiting the destruction of draft cards would alleviate the harmful secondary ef529US1 Unit: $U42 [10-11-01 11:58:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN
300 ERIE v. PAP'S A. M.

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
fects flowing from the destruction of those cards. Post, at311, n. 1.

But whether the harm is evident to our "intuition," ibid.,is not the proper inquiry. If it were, we would simply say
there is no doubt that a regulation prohibiting public nuditywould alleviate the harmful secondary effects associated
with nude dancing. In any event, Justice Souter conflates
two distinct concepts under O'Brien: whether there is a sub-stantial government interest and whether the regulation furthers that interest. As to the government interest, i. e.,whether the threatened harm is real, the city council relied
on this Court's opinions detailing the harmful secondary effects caused by establishments like Kandyland, as well as on
its own experiences in Erie. Justice Souter attempts to
denigrate the city council's conclusion that the threatened
harm was real, arguing that we cannot accept Erie's findings
because the subject of nude dancing is "fraught with some
emotionalism," post, at 314. Yet surely the subject of drafting our citizens into the military is "fraught" with more emotionalism than the subject of regulating nude dancing. Ibid.
Justice Souter next hypothesizes that the reason we cannot accept Erie's conclusion is that, since the question
whether these secondary effects occur is "amenable to empirical treatment," we should ignore Erie's actual experience
and instead require such an empirical analysis. Post, at
314-315, n. 3 (referring to a "scientifically sound" study offered by an amicus curiae to show that nude dancing establishments do not cause secondary effects). In Nixon, however, we flatly rejected that idea. 528 U. S., at 394 (noting
that the "invocation of academic studies said to indicate" that
the threatened harms are not real is insufficient to cast doubt
on the experience of the local government).

As to the second point--whether the regulation furthers
the government interest--it is evident that, since crime and
other public health and safety problems are caused by the
presence of nude dancing establishments like Kandyland, a

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
ban on such nude dancing would further Erie's interest inpreventing such secondary effects. To be sure, requiring

dancers to wear pasties and G-strings may not greatly re-duce these secondary effects, but

O'Brien requires only that
the regulation further the interest in combating such effects.Even though the dissent questions the wisdom of Erie's chosen remedy, post, at 323 (opinion of Stevens, J.), the " `city
must be allowed a reasonable opportunity to experimentwith solutions to admittedly serious problems,' "

Renton v.
Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U. S., at 52 (quoting American
Mini Theatres, 427 U. S., at 71 (plurality opinion)). It also
may be true that a pasties and G-string requirement would
not be as effective as, for example, a requirement that the
dancers be fully clothed, but the city must balance its efforts
to address the problem with the requirement that the restriction be no greater than necessary to further the city's
interest.

The ordinance also satisfies O'Brien's third factor, that the
government interest is unrelated to the suppression of free
expression, as discussed supra, at 289-296. The fourth and
final O'Brien factor--that the restriction is no greater than
is essential to the furtherance of the government interest--
is satisfied as well. The ordinance regulates conduct, and
any incidental impact on the expressive element of nude
dancing is de minimis. The requirement that dancers wear
pasties and G-strings is a minimal restriction in furtherance
of the asserted government interests, and the restriction
leaves ample capacity to convey the dancer's erotic message.
See Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U. S., at 572 (plurality
opinion of Rehnquist, C. J., joined by O'Connor and Ken-
nedy, JJ.); id., at 587 (Souter, J., concurring in judgment).
Justice Souter points out that zoning is an alternative
means of addressing this problem. It is far from clear, however, that zoning imposes less of a burden on expression than
the minimal requirement implemented here. In any event,
since this is a content-neutral restriction, least restrictive

means analysis is not required. See Ward, 491 U. S., at 798-799, n. 6.

We hold, therefore, that Erie's ordinance is a content-neutral regulation that is valid under O'Brien. Accordingly,
the judgment of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court is re-versed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.

It is so ordered.
Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas joins,concurring in the judgment.

I
In my view, the case before us here is moot. The Courtconcludes that it is not because respondent could resume its

nude dancing operations in the future, and because petition-ers have suffered an ongoing, redressable harm consisting of
the state court's invalidation of their public nudity ordinance.As to the first point: Petitioners do not dispute that Kandyland no longer exists; the building in which it was locatedhas been sold to a real estate developer, and the premises
are currently being used as a comedy club. We have asworn affidavit from respondent's sole shareholder, Nick
Panos, to the effect that Pap's "operates no active business,"and is "a `shell' corporation." More to the point, Panos
swears that neither Pap's nor Panos "employ[s] any individu-als involved in the nude dancing business," "maintain[s] any
contacts in the adult entertainment business," "has any cur-rent interest in any establishment providing nude dancing,"
or "has any intention to own or operate a nude dancingestablishment in the future."

1 Curiously, the Court makes no mention of Panos' averment of no intention to operate a nude dancing establishment in the future, but discusses
the issue as though the only factor suggesting mootness is the closing
of Kandyland. Ante, at 287-288. I see no basis for ignoring this aver529US1 Unit: $U42 [10-11-01 11:58:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN

303Cite as: 529 U. S. 277 (2000)
Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
Petitioners do not contest these representations, but offerin response only that Pap's

could very easily get back into
the nude dancing business. The Court adopts petitioners'line, concluding that because respondent is still incorporated

in Pennsylvania, it "could again decide to operate a nude
dancing establishment in Erie." Ante, at 287. That plainly
does not suffice under our cases. The test for mootness we
have applied in voluntary-termination cases is not whether
the action originally giving rise to the controversy could not
conceivably reoccur, but whether it is "absolutely clear that
the . . . behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur."
United States v. Concentrated Phosphate Export Assn., Inc.,
393 U. S. 199, 203 (1968) (emphasis added). Here I think
that test is met. According to Panos' uncontested sworn affidavit, Pap's ceased doing business at Kandyland, and the
premises were sold to an independent developer, in 1998--
the year before the petition for certiorari in this case was
filed. It strains credulity to suppose that the 72-year-old
Mr. Panos shut down his going business after securing his
victory in the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, and before the
city's petition for certiorari was even filed, in order to increase his chances of preserving his judgment in the statistically unlikely event that a (not yet filed) petition might be
granted. Given the timing of these events, given the fact
that respondent has no existing interest in nude dancing (or
in any other business), given Panos' sworn representation
that he does not intend to invest--through Pap's or otherwise--in any nude dancing business, and given Panos' adment. The only fact mentioned by the Court to justify regarding it as
perjurious is that respondent failed to raise mootness in its brief in opposition to the petition for certiorari. That may be good basis for censure, but
it is scant basis for suspicion of perjury--particularly since respondent, far
from seeking to "insulate a favorable decision from review," ante, at 288,
asks us in light of the mootness to vacate the judgment below. Reply to

vanced age,2 it seems to me that there is "no reasonable
expectation," even if there remains a theoretical possibility,
that Pap's will resume nude dancing operations in the
future.3

The situation here is indistinguishable from that which
obtained in Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520
U. S. 43 (1997), where the plaintiff-respondent, a state employee who had sued to enjoin enforcement of an amendment
to the Arizona Constitution making English that State's official language, had resigned her public-sector employment.
We held the case moot and, since the mootness was attributable to the " `unilateral action of the party who prevailed in
the lower court,' " we followed our usual practice of vacating the favorable judgment respondent had obtained in the

2 The Court asserts that "[s]everal Members of this Court can attest . . .
that the `advanced age' " of 72 "does not make it `absolutely clear' that a
life of quiet retirement is [one's] only reasonable expectation." Ante, at
288. That is tre's gallant, but it misses the point. Now as heretofore,
Justices in their seventies continue to do their work competently--indeed,
perhaps better than their youthful colleagues because of the wisdom that
age imparts. But to respond to my point, what the Court requires is
citation of an instance in which a Member of this Court (or of any other
court, for that matter) resigned at the age of 72 to begin a new career--
or more remarkable still (for this is what the Court suspects the young
Mr. Panos is up to) resigned at the age of 72 to go judge on a different
court, of no greater stature, and located in Erie, Pennsylvania, rather than
Palm Springs. I base my assessment of reasonable expectations not upon
Mr. Panos' age alone, but upon that combined with his sale of the business
and his assertion, under oath, that he does not intend to enter another.

3 It is significant that none of the assertions of Panos' affidavit is contested. Those pertaining to the sale of Kandyland and the current noninvolvement of Pap's in any other nude dancing establishment would seem
readily verifiable by petitioners. The statements regarding Pap's and
Panos' intentions for the future are by their nature not verifiable, and it
would be reasonable not to credit them if either petitioners asserted some
reason to believe they were not true or they were not rendered highly
plausible by Panos' age and his past actions. Neither condition exists
here.

Court of Appeals. Id., at 72 (quoting U. S. Bancorp Mortgage Co. v. Bonner Mall Partnership, 513 U. S. 18, 23 (1994)).

The rub here is that this case comes to us on writ of certio-rari to a state court, so that our lack of jurisdiction over the

case also entails, according to our recent jurisprudence, alack of jurisdiction to direct a vacatur. See

ASARCO Inc.
v. Kadish, 490 U. S. 605, 621, n. 1 (1989). The consequences
of that limitation on our power are in this case significant:A dismissal for mootness caused by respondent's unilateral

action would leave petitioners subject to an ongoing legaldisability, and a large one at that. Because the Pennsylvania Supreme Court severed the public nudity provision from
the ordinance, thus rendering it inoperative, the city would
be prevented from enforcing its public nudity prohibition not
only against respondent, should it decide to resume operations in the future, and not only against other nude dancing
establishments, but against anyone who appears nude in public, regardless of the "expressiveness" of his conduct or his
purpose in engaging in it.

That is an unfortunate consequence (which could be
avoided, of course, if the Pennsylvania Supreme Court chose
to vacate its judgments in cases that become moot during
appeal). But it is not a consequence that authorizes us to
entertain a suit the Constitution places beyond our power.
And leaving in effect erroneous state determinations regarding the Federal Constitution is, after all, not unusual. It
would have occurred here, even without the intervening
mootness, if we had denied certiorari. And until the 1914
revision of the Judicial Code, it occurred whenever a state
court erroneously sustained a federal constitutional challenge, since we did not even have statutory jurisdiction to
entertain an appeal. Compare Judiciary Act of 1789, ch. 20,

$ 25, 1 Stat. 85-87, with Act of Dec. 23, 1914, ch. 2, 38 Stat.
790. In any event, the short of the matter is that we have
no power to suspend the fundamental precepts that federal
courts "are limited by the case-or-controversy requirement

Thompson, 415 U. S. 452, 459, n. 10 (1974)) (internal quota-tion marks omitted).

Which brings me to the Court's second reason for holding
that this case is still alive: The Court concludes that becausepetitioners have an "ongoing injury" caused by the state

court's invalidation of its duly enacted public nudity provi-sion, our ability to hear the case and reverse the judgment
below is itself "sufficient to prevent the case from being
moot." Ante, at 288. Although the Court does not cite any
authority for the proposition that the burden of an adverse
decision below suffices to keep a case alive, it is evidently
relying upon our decision in ASARCO, which held that Article III's standing requirements were satisfied on writ of certiorari to a state court even though there would have been
no Article III standing for the action producing the state
judgment on which certiorari was sought. We assumed jurisdiction in the case because we concluded that the party
seeking to invoke the federal judicial power had standing to
challenge the adverse judgment entered against them by the
state court. Because that judgment, if left undisturbed,
would "caus[e] direct, specific, and concrete injury to the parties who petition for our review," ASARCO, 490 U. S., at
623-624, and because a decision by this Court to reverse the
State Supreme Court would clearly redress that injury, we
concluded that the original plaintiffs' lack of standing was
not fatal to our jurisdiction, id., at 624.

I dissented on this point in ASARCO, see id., at 634
(Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in part and dissenting in part,
joined by Scalia, J.), and remain of the view that it was
incorrectly decided. But ASARCO at least did not purport
to hold that the constitutional standing requirements of injury, causation, and redressability may be satisfied solely by

reference to the lower court's adverse judgment. It wascareful to note--however illogical that might have been, see

id., at 635--that the parties "remain[ed] adverse," and thatjurisdiction was proper only so long as the "requisites of a
case or controversy are also met," id., at 619, 624. Todaythe Court would appear to drop even this fig leaf.

4 In concluding that the injury to Erie is "sufficient" to keep thiscase alive, the Court performs the neat trick of identifying

a "case or controversy" that has only one interested party.

II
For the reasons set forth above, I would dismiss this casefor want of jurisdiction. Because the Court resolves the

threshold mootness question differently and proceeds to ad-dress the merits, I will do so briefly as well. I agree that
the decision of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court must be re-versed, but disagree with the mode of analysis the Court
has applied.The city of Erie self-consciously modeled its ordinance on
the public nudity statute we upheld against constitutionalchallenge in Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U. S. 560 (1991),
calculating (one would have supposed reasonably) that thecourts of Pennsylvania would consider themselves bound by
our judgment on a question of federal constitutional law. In
Barnes, I voted to uphold the challenged Indiana statute"not because it survives some lower level of First Amendment scrutiny, but because, as a general law regulating con-duct and not specifically directed at expression, it is not

4 I say "appear" because although the Court states categorically that
"the availability of . . . relief [from the judgment below] is sufficient to
prevent the case from being moot," it follows this statement, in the next
sentence, with the assertion that Pap's, the state-court plaintiff, retains a
"concrete stake in the outcome of this case." Ante, at 288. Of course, if
the latter were true a classic case or controversy existed, and resort to
the exotic theory of "standing by virtue of adverse judgment below" was
entirely unnecessary.

subject to First Amendment scrutiny at all." Id., at 572(opinion concurring in judgment). Erie's ordinance, too, by

its terms prohibits not merely nude dancing, but the act--irrespective of whether it is engaged in for expressive purposes--of going nude in public. The facts that a preambleto the ordinance explains that its purpose, in part, is to
"limi[t] a recent increase in nude live entertainment," App.
to Pet. for Cert. 42a, that city councilmembers in supportingthe ordinance commented to that effect, see

post, at 329-330,
and n. 16 (Stevens, J., dissenting), and that the ordinanceincludes in the definition of nudity the exposure of devices

simulating that condition, see post, at 331, neither make the
law any less general in its reach nor demonstrate that what
the municipal authorities really find objectionable is expression rather than public nakedness. As far as appears (and
as seems overwhelmingly likely), the preamble, the councilmembers' comments, and the chosen definition of the prohibited conduct simply reflect the fact that Erie had recently
been having a public nudity problem not with streakers,
sunbathers, or hot dog vendors, see Barnes, supra, at 574
(Scalia, J., concurring in judgment), but with lap dancers.

There is no basis for the contention that the ordinance does
not apply to nudity in theatrical productions such as Equus
or Hair. Its text contains no such limitation. It was stipulated in the trial court that no effort was made to enforce
the ordinance against a production of Equus involving nudity
that was being staged in Erie at the time the ordinance
became effective. App. 84. Notwithstanding Justice Ste-
vens' assertion to the contrary, however, see post, at 328,
neither in the stipulation, nor elsewhere in the record, does
it appear that the city was aware of the nudity--and before

to a general exception for theatrical productions, but to the

"grandfathered"--does not render this ordinance discrimina-tory on its face. To be sure, in the trial court counsel for

the city said that "[t]o the extent that the expressive activitythat is contained in [such] productions rises to a higher level
of protected expression, they would not be [covered]," App.53--but he rested this assertion upon the provision in the
preamble that expressed respect for "fundamental Constitutional guarantees of free speech and free expression," andthe provision of Paragraph 6 of the ordinance that provided

for severability of unconstitutional provisions, id., at 53-54.5What he was saying there (in order to fend off the overbreadth challenge of respondent, who was in no doubt thatthe ordinance

did cover theatrical productions, see id., at 55)
was essentially what he said at oral argument before thisCourt: that the ordinance would not be enforceable against

theatrical productions if the Constitution forbade it. Tr. ofOral Arg. 13. Surely that limitation does not cause the ordinance to be not generally applicable, in the relevant sense of
being targeted against expressive conduct.6

5 This followup explanation rendered what Justice Stevens calls counsel's "categorical" assertion that such productions would be exempt, see
post, at 328, n. 12, notably uncategorical. Rather than accept counsel's
explanation--in the trial court and here--that is compatible with the text
of the ordinance, Justice Stevens rushes to assign the ordinance a meaning that its words cannot bear, on the basis of counsel's initial footfault.
That is not what constitutional adjudication ought to be.

6 To correct Justice Stevens' characterization of my present point: I

do not argue that Erie "carved out an exception" for Equus and Hair.
Post, at 328, n. 14. Rather, it is my contention that the city attorney
assured the trial court that the ordinance was susceptible of an interpretation that would carve out such exceptions to the extent the Constitution
required them. Contrary to Justice Stevens' view, ibid., I do not believe that a law directed against all public nudity ceases to be a "general
law" (rather than one directed at expression) if it makes exceptions for
nudity protected by decisions of this Court. To put it another way, I do
not think a law contains the vice of being directed against expression if it
bans all public nudity, except that public nudity which the Supreme Court
has held cannot be banned because of its expressive content.

Moreover, even were I to conclude that the city of Eriehad specifically singled out the activity of nude dancing,

I still would not find that this regulation violated the FirstAmendment unless I could be persuaded (as on this record I
cannot) that it was the communicative character of nudedancing that prompted the ban. When conduct other than
speech itself is regulated, it is my view that the First
Amendment is violated only "[w]here the government pro-hibits conduct precisely because of its communicative attributes." Barnes, 501 U. S., at 577 (emphasis deleted). Here,even if one hypothesizes that the city's object was to suppress only nude dancing, that would not establish an intentto suppress what (if anything) nude dancing communicates.
I do not feel the need, as the Court does, to identify some
"secondary effects" associated with nude dancing that the
city could properly seek to eliminate. (I am highly skeptical, to tell the truth, that the addition of pasties and
G-strings will at all reduce the tendency of establishments
such as Kandyland to attract crime and prostitution, and
hence to foster sexually transmitted disease.) The traditional power of government to foster good morals (bonos
mores), and the acceptability of the traditional judgment (if
Erie wishes to endorse it) that nude public dancing itself is
immoral, have not been repealed by the First Amendment.

Justice Souter, concurring in part and dissenting in
part.

I join Parts I and II of the Court's opinion and agree with
the analytical approach that the plurality employs in deciding this case. Erie's stated interest in combating the secondary effects associated with nude dancing establishments
is an interest unrelated to the suppression of expression
under United States v. O'Brien, 391 U. S. 367 (1968), and the
city's regulation is thus properly considered under the
O'Brien standards. I do not believe, however, that the current record allows us to say that the city has made a suffi529US1 Unit: $U42 [10-11-01 11:58:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN

cient evidentiary showing to sustain its regulation, and Iwould therefore vacate the decision of the Pennsylvania

Supreme Court and remand the case for further proceedings.

I
In several recent cases, we have confronted the need forfactual justifications to satisfy intermediate scrutiny under

the First Amendment. See, e. g., Nixon v. Shrink MissouriGovernment PAC, 528 U. S. 377 (2000); Turner Broadcasting
System, Inc. v. FCC, 520 U. S. 180 (1997) (Turner II); TurnerBroadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. 622 (1994)
(Turner I). Those cases do not identify with any specificitya particular quantum of evidence, nor do I seek to do so in
this brief concurrence.1 What the cases do make plain, how-ever, is that application of an intermediate scrutiny test to a
government's asserted rationale for regulation of expressiveactivity demands some factual justification to connect that
rationale with the regulation in issue.

1 As explained below, infra, at 316, the issue of evidentiary justification
was never joined, and with a multiplicity of factors affecting the analysis,
a general formulation of the quantum required under United States v.
O'Brien, 391 U. S. 367 (1968), will at best be difficult. A lesser showing
may suffice when the means-end fit is evident to the untutored intuition.
As we said in Nixon, "The quantum of empirical evidence needed to satisfy heightened judicial scrutiny of legislative judgments will vary up or
down with the novelty and plausibility of the justification raised." 528
U. S., at 391. (In O'Brien, for example, the secondary effects that the
Government identified flowed from the destruction of draft cards, and
there could be no doubt that a regulation prohibiting that destruction
would alleviate the concomitant harm.) The nature of the legislating institution might also affect the calculus. We do not require Congress to
create a record in the manner of an administrative agency, see Turner II,
520 U. S. 180, 213 (1997), and we accord its findings greater respect than
those of agencies. See id., at 195. We might likewise defer less to a
city council than we would to Congress. The need for evidence may be
especially acute when a regulation is content based on its face and is analyzed as content neutral only because of the secondary effects doctrine.
And it may be greater when the regulation takes the form of a ban, rather
than a time, place, or manner restriction.

Opinion of Souter, J.
In Turner I, for example, we stated that

"[w]hen the Government defends a regulation on speech
as a means to redress past harms or prevent anticipatedharms, it must do more than simply `posit the existence

of the disease sought to be cured.' Quincy Cable TV,
Inc. v. FCC, 768 F. 2d 1434, 1455 (CADC 1985). It must
demonstrate that the recited harms are real, not merelyconjectural, and that the regulation will in fact alleviate

these harms in a direct and material way." Id., at 664(plurality opinion).

The plurality concluded there, of course, that the record,though swollen by three years of hearings on the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992,was insufficient to permit the necessary determinations and
remanded for a more thorough factual development. Whenthe case came back to us, in

Turner II, a majority of the
Court reiterated those requirements, characterizing the en-quiry into the acceptability of the Government's regulations

as one that turned on whether they "were designed to ad-dress a real harm, and whether those provisions will alleviate it in a material way." 520 U. S., at 195. Most recently,
in Nixon, we repeated that "[w]e have never accepted mereconjecture as adequate to carry a First Amendment burden,"

528 U. S., at 392, and we examined the "evidence introducedinto the record by petitioners or cited by the lower courts in
this action . . . ," id., at 393.The focus on evidence appearing in the record is consistent
with the approach earlier applied in Young v. American
Mini Theatres, Inc., 427 U. S. 50 (1976), and Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U. S. 41 (1986). In Young, Detroit
adopted a zoning ordinance requiring dispersal of adult
theaters through the city and prohibiting them within 500
feet of a residential area. Urban planners and real estate
experts attested to the harms created by clusters of such
theaters, see 427 U. S., at 55, and we found that "[t]he record

529US1 Unit: $U42 [10-11-01 11:58:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN

313Cite as: 529 U. S. 277 (2000)
Opinion of Souter, J.
discloses a factual basis" supporting the efficacy of Detroit'schosen remedy, id., at 71. In Renton, the city similarly

enacted a zoning ordinance requiring specified distances be-tween adult theaters and residential zones, churches, parks,
or schools. See 475 U. S., at 44. The city "held public hear-ings, reviewed the experiences of Seattle and other cities,
and received a report from the City Attorney's Office advis-ing as to developments in other cities."

Ibid. We foundthat Renton's failure to conduct its own studies before enacting the ordinance was not fatal; "[t]he First Amendment doesnot require a city . . . to conduct new studies or produce
evidence independent of that already generated by othercities, so long as whatever evidence the city relies upon is
reasonably believed to be relevant to the problem that thecity addresses." Id., at 51-52.

The upshot of these cases is that intermediate scrutinyrequires a regulating government to make some demonstration of an evidentiary basis for the harm it claims to flowfrom the expressive activity, and for the alleviation expected
from the restriction imposed.2 See, e. g., Edenfield v. Fane,507 U. S. 761, 770-773 (1993) (striking down regulation of
commercial speech for failure to show direct and materialefficacy). That evidentiary basis may be borrowed from the
records made by other governments if the experience else-where is germane to the measure under consideration and
actually relied upon. I will assume, further, that the reli-ance may be shown by legislative invocation of a judicial
opinion that accepted an evidentiary foundation as sufficient

2 The plurality excuses Erie from this requirement with the simple observation that "it is evident" that the regulation will have the required
efficacy. Ante, at 300. The ipse dixit is unconvincing. While I do agree
that evidentiary demands need not ignore an obvious fit between means
and ends, see n. 1, supra, it is not obvious that this is such a case. It is not
apparent to me as a matter of common sense that establishments featuring
dancers with pasties and G-strings will differ markedly in their effects on
neighborhoods from those whose dancers are nude. If the plurality does
find it apparent, we may have to agree to disagree.

for a similar regulation. What is clear is that the evidenceof reliance must be a matter of demonstrated fact, not speculative supposition.By these standards, the record before us today is deficient
in its failure to reveal any evidence on which Erie may haverelied, either for the seriousness of the threatened harm or
for the efficacy of its chosen remedy. The plurality does thebest it can with the materials to hand, see

ante, at 297-298,but the pickings are slim. The plurality quotes the ordinance's preamble asserting that over the course of more thana century the city council had expressed "findings" of detrimental secondary effects flowing from lewd and immoralprofitmaking activity in public places. But however accurate the recital may be and however honestly the councilorsmay have held those conclusions to be true over the years,
the recitation does not get beyond conclusions on a subjectusually fraught with some emotionalism. The plurality recognizes this, of course, but seeks to ratchet up the value ofmere conclusions by analogizing them to the legislative facts
within an administrative agency's special knowledge, onwhich action is adequately premised in the absence of evidentiary challenge. Ante, at 298. The analogy is not obvious;agencies are part of the executive branch and we defer to
them in part to allow them the freedom necessary to recon-cile competing policies. See

Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natu-ral Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 843-845

(1984). That aside, it is one thing to accord administrativeleeway as to predictive judgments in applying " `elusive concepts' " to circumstances where the record is inconclusive and"evidence . . . is difficult to compile," FCC v. National Citizens Comm. for Broadcasting, 436 U. S. 775, 796-797 (1978),and quite another to dispense with evidence of current fact

315Cite as: 529 U. S. 277 (2000)
Opinion of Souter, J.
to current fact, the city council's closest approach to an evi-dentiary record on secondary effects and their causes was

the statement of one councilor, during the debate over theordinance, who spoke of increases in sex crimes in a way that
might be construed as a reference to secondary effects. SeeApp. 44. But that reference came at the end of a litany of
concerns ("free condoms in schools, drive-by shootings, abor-tions, suicide machines," and declining student achievement
test scores) that do not seem to be secondary effects of nudedancing.

Ibid. Nor does the invocation of Barnes v. Glen
Theatre, Inc., 501 U. S. 560 (1991), in one paragraph of the
preamble to Erie's ordinance suffice. App. to Pet. for Cert.42a. The plurality opinion in

Barnes made no mention
of evidentiary showings at all, and though my separate opin-ion did make a pass at the issue, I did not demand reliance

on germane evidentiary demonstrations, whether specific tothe statute in question or developed elsewhere. To invoke
Barnes, therefore, does not indicate that the issue of evi-dence has been addressed.

There is one point, however, on which an evidentiary record is not quite so hard to find, but it hurts, not helps, thecity. The final

O'Brien requirement is that the incidental
speech restriction be shown to be no greater than essentialto achieve the government's legitimate purpose. 391 U. S.,

at 377. To deal with this issue, we have to ask what basisthere is to think that the city would be unsuccessful in countering any secondary effects by the significantly lesser re-striction of zoning to control the location of nude dancing,
thus allowing for efficient law enforcement, restricting ef-fects on property values, and limiting exposure of the public.

position to look to the facts of their own community's experience as well
as to experiences elsewhere. Their failure to do so is made all the clearer
by one of the amicus briefs, largely devoted to the argument that scientifically sound studies show no such correlation. See Brief for First
Amendment Lawyers Association as Amicus Curiae 16-23; id., at App.

316 ERIE v. PAP'S A. M.

Opinion of Souter, J.
The record shows that for 23 years there has been a zoningordinance on the books to regulate the location of establishments like Kandyland, but the city has not enforced it. Onecouncilor remarked that "I think there's one of the problems.
The ordinances are on the books and not enforced. Now thistakes place. You really didn't need any other ordinances."
App. 43. Another commented, "I felt very, very strongly,and I feel just as strongly right now, that this is a zoning
matter." Id., at 45. Even on the plurality's view of the evi-dentiary burden, this hurdle to the application of

O'Brienrequires an evidentiary response.

The record suggests that Erie simply did not try to createa record of the sort we have held necessary in other cases,
and the suggestion is confirmed by the course of this liti-gation. The evidentiary question was never decided (or,
apparently, argued) below, nor was the issue fairly joinedbefore this Court. While respondent did claim that the evidence before the city council was insufficient to support theordinance, see Brief for Respondent 44-49, Erie's reply
urged us not to consider the question, apparently assumingthat

Barnes authorized us to disregard it. See Reply Brieffor Petitioners 6-8. The question has not been addressed,

and in that respect this case has come unmoored from thegeneral standards of our First Amendment jurisprudence.

Careful readers, and not just those on the Erie City Coun-cil, will of course realize that my partial dissent rests on a

demand for an evidentiary basis that I failed to make whenI concurred in Barnes, supra. I should have demanded the
evidence then, too, and my mistake calls to mind JusticeJackson's foolproof explanation of a lapse of his own, when
he quoted Samuel Johnson, " `Ignorance, sir, ignorance.' "

to think further about the needs of the First Amendment,I have come to believe that a government must toe the mark
more carefully than I first insisted. I hope it is enlighten-ment on my part, and acceptable even if a little late. See

The record before us now does not permit the conclusionthat Erie's ordinance is reasonably designed to mitigate real

harms. This does not mean that the required showing can-not be made, only that, on this record, Erie has not made it.
I would remand to give it the opportunity to do so.6 Accord-ingly, although I join with the plurality in adopting the
O'Brien test, I respectfully dissent from the Court's disposi-tion of the case.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins,dissenting.
Far more important than the question whether nude danc-ing is entitled to the protection of the First Amendment
are the dramatic changes in legal doctrine that the Courtendorses today. Until now, the "secondary effects" of commercial enterprises featuring indecent entertainment havejustified only the regulation of their location. For the first
time, the Court has now held that such effects may justify

World 82 (R. Hutchins & M. Adler eds. 1952).

6 This suggestion does not, of course, bar the Pennsylvania Supreme

Court from choosing simpler routes to disposition of the case if they exist.
Respondent mounted a federal overbreadth challenge to the ordinance; it
also asserted a violation of the Pennsylvania Constitution. Either one
of these arguments, if successful, would obviate the need for the factual
development that is a prerequisite to O'Brien analysis.

the total suppression of protected speech. Indeed, the plu-rality opinion concludes that admittedly trivial advancements of a State's interests may provide the basis for censor-ship. The Court's commendable attempt to replace the
fractured decision in Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U. S.560 (1991), with a single coherent rationale is strikingly
unsuccessful; it is supported neither by precedent nor bypersuasive reasoning.

I
As the preamble to Ordinance No. 75-1994 candidly ac-knowledges, the council of the city of Erie enacted the

restriction at issue "for the purpose of limiting a recentincrease in nude live entertainment within the City." Ante,
at 290 (internal quotation marks omitted). Prior to the en-actment of the ordinance, the dancers at Kandyland performed in the nude. As the Court recognizes, after its en-actment they can perform precisely the same dances if they
wear "pasties and G-strings." Ante, at 294; see also ante,at 313, n. 2 (

Souter, J., concurring in part and dissenting inpart). In both instances, the erotic messages conveyed by

the dancers to a willing audience are a form of expressionprotected by the First Amendment.

Ante, at 289.1 Despitethe similarity between the messages conveyed by the two

forms of dance, they are not identical.If we accept Chief Judge Posner's evaluation of this art
form, see Miller v. South Bend, 904 F. 2d 1081, 1089-1104(CA7 1990) (en banc), the difference between the two messages is significant. The plurality assumes, however, thatthe difference in the content of the message resulting from

1 Respondent does not contend that there is a constitutional right to
engage in conduct such as lap dancing. The message of eroticism conveyed by the nudity aspect of the dance is quite different from the issue
of the proximity between dancer and audience. Respondent's contention
is not that Erie has focused on lap dancers, see ante, at 308 (Scalia, J.,
concurring in judgment), but that it has focused on the message conveyed
by nude dancing.

the mandated costume change is "de minimis." Ante, at294. Although I suspect that the patrons of Kandyland are

more likely to share Chief Judge Posner's view than the plu-rality's, for present purposes I shall accept the assumption
that the difference in the message is small. The crucialpoint to remember, however, is that whether one views the
difference as large or small, nude dancing still receives FirstAmendment protection, even if that protection lies only in
the "outer ambit" of that Amendment. Ante, at 289. Erie'sordinance, therefore, burdens a message protected by the
First Amendment. If one assumes that the same erotic
message is conveyed by nude dancers as by those wearingminiscule costumes, one means of expressing that message

is banned; 2 if one assumes that the messages are different,one of those messages is banned. In either event, the ordinance is a total ban.The plurality relies on the so-called "secondary effects"
test to defend the ordinance. Ante, at 290-296. The present use of that rationale, however, finds no support whatso-ever in our precedents. Never before have we approved the

use of that doctrine to justify a total ban on protected FirstAmendment expression. On the contrary, we have been
quite clear that the doctrine would not support that end.In

Young v. American Mini Theatres, Inc., 427 U. S. 50
(1976), we upheld a Detroit zoning ordinance that placed spe-cial restrictions on the location of motion picture theaters

that exhibited "adult" movies. The "secondary effects" ofthe adult theaters on the neighborhoods where they were
located--lower property values and increases in crime (espe-cially prostitution) to name a few--justified the burden im2 Although nude dancing might be described as one protected "means"
of conveying an erotic message, it does not follow that a protected message
has not been totally banned simply because there are other, similar ways
to convey erotic messages. See ante, at 292-293. A State's prohibition
of a particular book, for example, does not fail to be a total ban simply
because other books conveying a similar message are available.

posed by the ordinance. Id., at 54, 71, and n. 34 (plurality
opinion). Essential to our holding, however, was the fact
that the ordinance was "nothing more than a limitation on
the place where adult films may be exhibited" and did not
limit the size of the market in such speech. Id., at 71; see
also id., at 61, 63, n. 18, 70, 71, n. 35. As Justice Powell
emphasized in his concurrence:

"At most the impact of the ordinance on [the First
Amendment] interests is incidental and minimal. Detroit has silenced no message, has invoked no censorship,
and has imposed no limitation upon those who wish to
view them. The ordinance is addressed only to the
places at which this type of expression may be presented, a restriction that does not interfere with content. Nor is there any significant overall curtailment
of adult movie presentations, or the opportunity for a
message to reach an audience." Id., at 78-79.

See also id., at 81, n. 4 ("[A] zoning ordinance that merely
specifies where a theater may locate, and that does not reduce significantly the number or accessibility of theaters presenting particular films, stifles no expression").

In Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U. S. 41 (1986),
we upheld a similar ordinance, again finding that the "secondary effects of such theaters on the surrounding community" justified a restrictive zoning law. Id., at 47 (emphasis
deleted). We noted, however, that "[t]he Renton ordinance,
like the one in American Mini Theatres, does not ban adult
theaters altogether," but merely "circumscribe[s] their choice
as to location." Id., at 46, 48; see also id., at 54 ("In our
view, the First Amendment requires . . . that Renton refrain
from effectively denying respondents a reasonable opportunity to open and operate an adult theater within the
city . . ."). Indeed, in both Renton and American Mini Theatres, the zoning ordinances were analyzed as mere "time,

place, and manner" regulations.3 See Renton, 475 U. S., at46; American Mini Theatres, 427 U. S., at 63, and n. 18; id.,

at 82, n. 6. Because time, place, and manner regulationsmust "leave open ample alternative channels for communication of the information," Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491U. S. 781, 791 (1989), a total ban would necessarily fail that
test.4And we so held in

Schad v. Mount Ephraim, 452 U. S. 61(1981). There, we addressed a zoning ordinance that did not

merely require the dispersal of adult theaters, but prohibited

3 The plurality contends, ante, at 295, that Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781 (1989), shows that we have used the secondary effects
rationale to justify more burdensome restrictions than those approved in
Renton and American Mini Theatres. That argument is unpersuasive
for two reasons. First, as in the two cases just mentioned, the regulation
in Ward was as a time, place, and manner restriction. See 491 U. S., at
791; id., at 804 (Marshall, J., dissenting). Second, as discussed below,
Ward is not a secondary effects case. See infra, at 325-326.

4 We also held in Renton that in enacting its adult theater zoning ordinance, the city of Renton was permitted to rely on a detailed study
conducted by the city of Seattle that examined the relationship between
zoning controls and the secondary effects of adult theaters. (It was permitted to rely as well on "the `detailed findings' summarized" in an opinion
of the Washington Supreme Court to the same effect.) 475 U. S., at 51-52.
Renton, having identified the same problem in its own city as that experienced in Seattle, quite logically drew on Seattle's experience and adopted
a similar solution. But if Erie is relying on the Seattle study as well (as
the plurality suggests, ante, at 296-297), its use of that study is most
peculiar. After identifying a problem in its own city similar to that in
Seattle, Erie has implemented a solution (pasties and G-strings) bearing
no relationship to the efficacious remedy identified by the Seattle study
(dispersal through zoning).

But the city of Erie, of course, has not in fact pointed to any study
by anyone suggesting that the adverse secondary effects of commercial
enterprises featuring erotic dancing depends in the slightest on the precise
costume worn by the performers--it merely assumes it to be so. See
infra, at 323-324. If the city is permitted simply to assume that a slight
addition to the dancers' costumes will sufficiently decrease secondary effects, then presumably the city can require more and more clothing as
long as any danger of adverse effects remains.

them altogether. In striking down that law, we focused pre-cisely on that distinction, holding that the secondary effects

analysis endorsed in the past did not apply to an ordinancethat totally banned nude dancing: "The restriction [in Young
v. American Mini Theatres] did not affect the number ofadult movie theaters that could operate in the city; it merely
dispersed them. The Court did not imply that a municipal-ity could ban all adult theaters--much less all live entertainment or all nude dancing--from its commercial districts city-wide."

zoning and declined to extend their reasoning to total bansis clear and straightforward: A dispersal that simply limits
the places where speech may occur is a minimal imposition,whereas a total ban is the most exacting of restrictions.
The State's interest in fighting presumed secondary effectsis sufficiently strong to justify the former, but far too weak
to support the latter, more severe burden.5 Yet it is per-fectly clear that in the present case--to use Justice Powell's
metaphor in American Mini Theatres--the city of Erie hastotally silenced a message the dancers at Kandyland want to
convey. The fact that this censorship may have a laudableulterior purpose cannot mean that censorship is not censorship. For these reasons, the Court's holding rejects the ex-plicit reasoning in

American Mini Theatres and Renton andthe express holding in Schad.

The Court's use of the secondary effects rationale to per-mit a total ban has grave implications for basic free speech
principles. Ordinarily, laws regulating the primary effectsof speech,

i. e., the intended persuasive effects caused by the

Amendment will not tolerate the total suppression of erotic materials that
have some artistic value," though it will permit zoning regulations.

speech, are presumptively invalid. Under today's opinion,a State may totally ban speech based on its secondary effects--which are defined as those effects that "happen tobe associated" with speech, Boos v. Barry, 485 U. S. 312, 320-
321 (1988); see ante, at 291--yet the regulation is not pre-sumptively invalid. Because the category of effects that
"happen to be associated" with speech includes the narrowersubset of effects caused by speech, today's holding has the
effect of swallowing whole a most fundamental principle ofFirst Amendment jurisprudence.

II
The plurality's mishandling of our secondary effects casesis not limited to its approval of a total ban. It compounds

that error by dramatically reducing the degree to which theState's interest must be furthered by the restriction imposed
on speech, and by ignoring the critical difference betweensecondary effects caused by speech and the incidental effects
on speech that may be caused by a regulation of conduct.In what can most delicately be characterized as an enormous understatement, the plurality concedes that "requiringdancers to wear pasties and G-strings may not greatly reduce these secondary effects." Ante, at 301. To believe thatthe mandatory addition of pasties and a G-string will have
any kind of noticeable impact on secondary effects requiresnothing short of a titanic surrender to the implausible. It
would be more accurate to acknowledge, as Justice Scaliadoes, that there is no reason to believe that such a requirement "will at all reduce the tendency of establishments suchas Kandyland to attract crime and prostitution, and hence to
foster sexually transmitted disease." Ante, at 310 (opinionconcurring in judgment); see also ante, at 313, n. 2 (

Souter,J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Nevertheless,

the plurality concludes that the "less stringent" test an-nounced in

United States v. O'Brien, 391 U. S. 367 (1968),"requires only that the regulation further the interest in

combating such effects," ante, at 301; see also ante, at 289.It is one thing to say, however, that O'Brien is more lenient than the "more demanding standard" we have imposedin cases such as Texas v. Johnson, 491 U. S. 397 (1989).
See ante, at 289. It is quite another to say that the testcan be satisfied by nothing more than the mere possibility of
de minimis effects on the neighborhood.The plurality is also mistaken in equating our secondary
effects cases with the "incidental burdens" doctrine appliedin cases such as

O'Brien; and it aggravates the error by in-voking the latter line of cases to support its assertion that

Erie's ordinance is unrelated to speech. The incidental bur-dens doctrine applies when " `speech' and `nonspeech' elements are combined in the same course of conduct," and thegovernment's interest in regulating the latter justifies incidental burdens on the former. O'Brien, 391 U. S., at 376.Secondary effects, on the other hand, are indirect consequences of protected speech and may justify regulation ofthe places where that speech may occur. See

AmericanMini Theatres, 427 U. S., at 71, n. 34 ("[A] concentration of

`adult' movie theaters causes the area to deteriorate and be-come a focus of crime").

6 When a State enacts a regulation,

it might focus on the secondary effects of speech as its aim,or it might concentrate on nonspeech related concerns, having no thoughts at all with respect to how its regulation willaffect speech--and only later, when the regulation is found
to burden speech, justify the imposition as an unintendedincidental consequence.

7 But those interests are not the

6 A secondary effect on the neighborhood that "happen[s] to be associated with" a form of speech is, of course, critically different from "the
direct impact of speech on its audience." Boos v. Barry, 485 U. S. 312,
320-321 (1988). The primary effect of speech is the persuasive effect of
the message itself.

7 In fact, the very notion of focusing in on incidental burdens at the time

of enactment appears to be a contradiction in terms. And if it were not
the case that there is a difference between laws aimed at secondary effects
and general bans incidentally burdening speech, then one wonders why

Stevens, J., dissenting
same, and the plurality cannot ignore their differences and
insist that both aims are equally unrelated to speech simply
because Erie might have "recogniz[ed]" that it could possibly
have had either aim in mind. See ante, at 295.8 One can
think of an apple and an orange at the same time; that does
not turn them into the same fruit.

Of course, the line between governmental interests aimed
at conduct and unrelated to speech, on the one hand, and
interests arising out of the effects of the speech, on the other,
may be somewhat imprecise in some cases. In this case,
however, we need not wrestle with any such difficulty because Erie has expressly justified its ordinance with reference to secondary effects. Indeed, if Erie's concern with the
effects of the message were unrelated to the message itself,
it is strange that the only means used to combat those effects
is the suppression of the message.9 For these reasons, the
plurality's argument that "this case is similar to O'Brien,"
ante, at 291; see also ante, at 294, is quite wrong, as are its

Justices Scalia and Souter adopted such strikingly different approaches in Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U. S. 560 (1991).

8 I frankly do not understand the plurality's declaration that a State's

interest in the secondary effects of speech that are "associated" with the
speech are not "related" to the speech. Ante, at 296. See, e. g., Webster's Third New International Dictionary 132 (1966) (defining "associate"
as "closely related"). Sometimes, though, the plurality says that the secondary effects are "caused" by the speech, rather than merely "associated
with" the speech. See, e. g., ante, at 291, 293, 297, 300. If that is the
definition of secondary effects the plurality adopts, then it is even more
obvious that an interest in secondary effects is related to the speech at
issue. See Barnes, 501 U. S., at 585-586 (Souter, J., concurring in judgment) (secondary effects are not related to speech because their connection
to speech is only one of correlation, not causation).

9 As Justice Powell said in his concurrence in Young v. American Mini

Theatres, 427 U. S., at 82, n. 4: "[H]ad [Detroit] been concerned with restricting the message purveyed by adult theaters, it would have tried to
close them or restrict their number rather than circumscribe their choice
as to location." Quite plainly, Erie's total ban evinces its concern with
the message being regulated.

U. S. 781 (1989), ante, at 293-295, neither of which involvedsecondary effects. The plurality cannot have its cake and
eat it too--either Erie's ordinance was not aimed at speechand the plurality may attempt to justify the regulation under
the incidental burdens test, or Erie has aimed its law at thesecondary effects of speech, and the plurality can try to justify the law under that doctrine. But it cannot conflate thetwo with the expectation that Erie's interests aimed at secondary effects will be rendered unrelated to speech by virtueof this doctrinal polyglot.

Correct analysis of the issue in this case should begin withthe proposition that nude dancing is a species of expressive
conduct that is protected by the First Amendment. AsChief Judge Posner has observed, nude dancing fits well
within a broad, cultural tradition recognized as expressivein nature and entitled to First Amendment protection. See
904 F. 2d, at 1089-1104; see also Note, 97 Colum. L. Rev. 1844(1997). The nudity of the dancer is both a component of the
protected expression and the specific target of the ordinance.It is pure sophistry to reason from the premise that the regulation of the nudity component of nude dancing is unrelatedto the message conveyed by nude dancers. Indeed, both the
text of the ordinance and the reasoning in the plurality'sopinion make it pellucidly clear that the city of Erie has prohibited nude dancing "precisely because of its communica-tive attributes." Barnes, 501 U. S., at 577 (

Scalia, J., con-curring in judgment) (emphasis in original); see

id., at 596(White, J., dissenting).

III
The censorial purpose of Erie's ordinance precludes reli-ance on the judgment in

Barnes as sufficient support for theCourt's holding today. Several differences between the Erie

ordinance and the statute at issue in Barnes belie the plural-ity's assertion that the two laws are "almost identical."

Ante, at 289. To begin with, the preamble to Erie's ordi-nance candidly articulates its agenda, declaring:

"Council specifically wishes to adopt the concept of Pub-lic Indecency prohibited by the laws of the State of Indiana, which was approved by the U. S. Supreme Court inBarnes vs. Glen Theatre Inc., . . . for the purpose of
limiting a recent increase in nude live entertainmentwithin the City." App. to Pet. for Cert. 42a (emphasis
added); see also ante, at 290.10
As its preamble forthrightly admits, the ordinance's "pur-pose" is to "limi[t]" a protected form of speech; its invocation

of Barnes cannot obliterate that professed aim.11Erie's ordinance differs from the statute in

Barnes inanother respect. In Barnes, the Court expressly observed

that the Indiana statute had not been given a limiting con-struction by the Indiana Supreme Court. As presented to
this Court, there was nothing about the law itself that wouldconfine its application to nude dancing in adult entertainment establishments. See 501 U. S., at 564, n. 1 (discussingIndiana Supreme Court's lack of a limiting construction); see
also id., at 585, n. 2 (Souter, J., concurring in judgment).

10 The preamble also states: "[T]he Council of the City of Erie has
[found] . . . that certain lewd, immoral activities carried on in public places
for profit . . . lead to the debasement of both women and men . . . ." App.
to Pet. for Cert. 41a.

11 Relying on five words quoted from the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, the plurality suggests that I have misinterpreted that court's reading
of the preamble. Ante, at 290. What follows, however, is a more complete statement of what that court said on this point:

"We acknowledge that one of the purposes of the Ordinance is to combat
negative secondary effects. That, however, is not its only goal. Inextricably bound up with this stated purpose is an unmentioned purpose that
directly impacts on the freedom of expression: that purpose is to impact
negatively on the erotic message of the dance. . . . We believe . . . that the
stated purpose for promulgating the Ordinance is inextricably linked with
the content-based motivation to suppress the expressive nature of nude
dancing." 553 Pa. 348, 359, 719 A. 2d 273, 279 (1998).

328 ERIE v. PAP'S A. M.

Stevens, J., dissenting
Erie's ordinance, however, comes to us in a much differentposture. In an earlier proceeding in this case, the Court of

Common Pleas asked Erie's counsel "what effect would thisordinance have on theater . . . productions such as Equus,
Hair, O[h!] Calcutta[!]? Under your ordinance would thesethings be prevented . . . ?" Counsel responded: "No, they
wouldn't, Your Honor." App. 53.12 Indeed, as stipulated inthe record, the city permitted a production of Equus to proceed without prosecution, even after the ordinance was ineffect, and despite its awareness of the nudity involved in
the production. Id., at 84.13 Even if, in light of its broadapplicability, the statute in

Barnes was not aimed at a partic-ular form of speech, Erie's ordinance is quite different. As

presented to us, the ordinance is deliberately targeted atKandyland's type of nude dancing (to the exclusion of plays
like Equus), in terms of both its applicable scope and thecity's enforcement.

14

12 In my view, Erie's categorical response forecloses Justice Scalia's
assertion that the city's position on Equus and Hair was limited to "[o]ne
instance," where "the city was [not] aware of the nudity," and "no one had
complained." Ante, at 308 (opinion concurring in judgment). Nor could
it be contended that selective applicability by stipulated enforcement
should be treated differently from selective applicability by statutory text.
See Barnes, 501 U. S., at 574 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (selective enforcement may affect a law's generality). Were it otherwise, constitutional prohibitions could be circumvented with impunity.

13 The stipulation read: "The play, `Equus' featured frontal nudity and

was performed for several weeks in October/November 1994 at the Roadhouse Theater in downtown Erie with no efforts to enforce the nudity
prohibition which became effective during the run of the play."

14 Justice Scalia argues that Erie might have carved out an exception

for Equus and Hair because it guessed that this Court would consider
them protected forms of expression, see Southeastern Promotions, Ltd.
v. Conrad, 420 U. S. 546, 550, 557-558 (1975) (holding that Hair, including
the "group nudity and simulated sex" involved in the production, is protected speech); in his view, that makes the distinction unobjectionable and
renders the ordinance no less of a general law. Ante, at 309 (opinion concurring in judgment). This argument appears to contradict his earlier
definition of a general law: "A law is `general' . . . if it regulates conduct

Stevens, J., dissenting
This narrow aim is confirmed by the expressed views ofthe Erie City Councilmembers who voted for the ordinance.

The four city councilmembers who approved the measure (ofthe six total councilmembers) each stated his or her view
that the ordinance was aimed specifically at nude adult en-tertainment, and not at more mainstream forms of entertainment that include total nudity, nor even at nudity in general.
One lawmaker observed: "We're not talking about nudity.We're not talking about the theater or art . . . . We're talking about what is indecent and immoral. . . . We're not pro-hibiting nudity, we're prohibiting nudity when it's used in a

lewd and immoral fashion." App. 39. Though not quite assuccinct, the other councilmembers expressed similar convictions. For example, one member illustrated his understand-ing of the aim of the law by contrasting it with his recollection about high school students swimming in the nude in theschool's pool. The ordinance was not intended to cover
those incidents of nudity: "But what I'm getting at is [the
swimming] wasn't indecent, it wasn't an immoral thing, and

without regard to whether that conduct is expressive." Barnes v. Glen
Theatre, Inc., 501 U. S., at 576, n. 3 (opinion concurring in judgment). If
the ordinance regulates conduct (public nudity), it does not do so without
regard to whether the nudity is expressive if it exempts the public nudity
in Hair precisely "because of its expressive content." Ante, at 309, n. 6
(opinion concurring in judgment). Moreover, if Erie exempts Hair because it wants to avoid a conflict with the First Amendment (rather than
simply to exempt instances of nudity it finds inoffensive), that rationale
still does not explain why Hair is exempted but Kandyland is not, since
Barnes held that both are constitutionally protected.

Justice Scalia also states that even if the ordinance singled out nude
dancing, he would not strike down the law unless the dancing was singled
out because of its message. Ante, at 310. He opines that here, the basis
for singling out Kandyland is morality. Ibid. But since the "morality"
of the public nudity in Hair is left untouched by the ordinance, while the
"immorality" of the public nudity in Kandyland is singled out, the distinction cannot be that "nude public dancing itself is immoral." Ibid.
(emphasis in original). Rather, the only arguable difference between the
two is that one's message is more immoral than the other's.

yet there was nudity." Id., at 42. The same lawmaker thendisfavorably compared the nude swimming incident to the

activities that occur in "some of these clubs" that existin Erie--clubs that would be covered by the law. Ibid.

15

Though such comments could be consistent with an interestin a general prohibition of nudity, the complete absence of

commentary on that broader interest, and the councilmem-bers' exclusive focus on adult entertainment, is evidence of
the ordinance's aim. In my view, we need not strain to findconsistency with more general purposes when the most natural reading of the record reflects a near obsessive preoccupa-tion with a single target of the law.

16

The text of Erie's ordinance is also significantly differentfrom the law upheld in

Barnes. In Barnes, the statute de-fined "nudity" as "the showing of the human male or female

15 Other members said their focus was on "bottle clubs," and the like,
App. 43, and attempted to downplay the effect of the ordinance by acknowledging that "the girls can wear thongs or a G-string and little pasties that are smaller than a diamond." Ibid. Echoing that focus, another
member stated that "[t]here still will be adult entertainment in this town,
only it will be in a little different form." Id., at 47.

16 The plurality dismisses this evidence, declaring that it "will not strike

down an otherwise constitutional statute on the basis of an alleged illicit
motive." Ante, at 292 (citing United States v. O'Brien, 391 U. S. 367, 382-
383 (1968); Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U. S. 41, 47-48 (1986)).
First, it is worth pointing out that this doctrinaire formulation of O'Brien's
cautionary statement is overbroad. See generally L. Tribe, American
Constitutional Law $ 12-5, pp. 819-820 (2d ed. 1988). Moreover, O'Brien
itself said only that we would not strike down a law "on the assumption
that a wrongful purpose or motive has caused the power to be exerted,"
391 U. S., at 383 (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted), and
that statement was due to our recognition that it is a "hazardous matter"
to determine the actual intent of a body as large as Congress "on the basis
of what fewer than a handful of Congressmen said about [a law]," id., at
384. Yet neither consideration is present here. We need not base our
inquiry on an "assumption," nor must we infer the collective intent of a
large body based on the statements of a few, for we have in the record the
actual statements of all the city councilmembers who voted in favor of
the ordinance.

genitals" (and certain other regions of the body) "with lessthan a fully opaque covering." 501 U. S., at 569, n. 2. The

Erie ordinance duplicates that definition in all material re-spects, but adds the following to its definition of "[n]udity":

" `[T]he exposure of any device, costume, or coveringwhich gives the appearance of or simulates the genitals,
pubic hair, natal cleft, perineum anal region or pubichair region; or the exposure of any device worn as a
cover over the nipples and/or areola of the femalebreast, which device simulates and gives the realistic
appearance of nipples and/or areola.' " Ante, at 283-284, n. (emphasis added).

Can it be doubted that this out-of-the-ordinary definition of"nudity" is aimed directly at the dancers in establishments
such as Kandyland? Who else is likely to don such gar-ments?

17 We should not stretch to embrace fanciful explanations when the most natural reading of the ordinanceunmistakably identifies its intended target.

It is clear beyond a shadow of a doubt that the Erie ordi-nance was a response to a more specific concern than nudity
in general, namely, nude dancing of the sort found in Kandy-land.

18 Given that the Court has not even tried to defend

17 Is it seriously contended (as would be necessary to sustain the ordinance as a general prohibition) that, when crafting this bizarre definition
of "nudity," Erie's concern was with the use of simulated nipple covers on
"nude beaches and [by otherwise] unclothed purveyors of hot dogs and
machine tools"? Barnes, 501 U. S., at 574 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment); see also ante, at 308 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment). It is
true that one might conceivably imagine that is Erie's aim. But it is far
more likely that this novel definition was written with the Kandyland
dancers and the like in mind, since they are the only ones covered by the
law (recall that plays like Equus are exempted from coverage) who are
likely to utilize such unconventional clothing.

18 The plurality states that Erie's ordinance merely "replaces and updates provisions of an `Indecency and Immorality' ordinance" from the
mid-19th century, just as the statute in Barnes did. Ante, at 290. First
of all, it is not clear that this is correct. The record does indicate that

Stevens, J., dissenting
the ordinance's total ban on the ground that its censorship ofprotected speech might be justified by an overriding state

interest, it should conclude that the ordinance is patently in-valid. For these reasons, as well as the reasons set forth in
Justice White's dissent in Barnes, I respectfully dissent.

Erie's Ordinance No. 75-1994 updates an older ordinance of similar import.
Unfortunately, that old regulation is not in the record. Consequently,
whether the new ordinance merely "replaces" the old one is a matter of
debate. From statements of one councilmember, it can reasonably be inferred that the old ordinance was merely a residential zoning restriction,
not a total ban. See App. 43. If that is so, it leads to the further question
why Erie felt it necessary to shift to a total ban in 1994.

But even if the plurality's factual contention is correct, it does not undermine the points I have made in the text. In Barnes, the point of noting
the ancient pedigree of the Indiana statute was to demonstrate that its
passage antedated the appearance of adult entertainment venues, and
therefore could not have been motivated by the presence of those establishments. The inference supposedly rebutted in Barnes stemmed from
the timing of the enactment. Here, however, the inferences I draw depend on the text of the ordinance, its preamble, its scope and enforcement,
and the comments of the councilmembers. These do not depend on the
timing of the ordinance's enactment.

BOND v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 98-9349. Argued February 29, 2000--Decided April 17, 2000
Border Patrol Agent Cantu boarded a bus in Texas to check the immigration status of its passengers. As he walked off the bus, he squeezed
the soft luggage which passengers had placed in the overhead storage
space. He squeezed a canvas bag above petitioner's seat and noticed
that it contained a "brick-like" object. After petitioner admitted owning the bag and consented to its search, Agent Cantu discovered a
"brick" of methamphetamine. Petitioner was indicted on federal drug
charges. He moved to suppress the drugs, arguing that Agent Cantu
conducted an illegal search of his bag. The District Court denied the
motion and found petitioner guilty. The Fifth Circuit affirmed the denial of the motion, holding that Agent Cantu's manipulation of the bag
was not a search under the Fourth Amendment.

Held: Agent Cantu's physical manipulation of petitioner's carry-on bag

violated the Fourth Amendment's proscription against unreasonable
searches. A traveler's personal luggage is clearly an "effect" protected
by the Amendment, see United States v. Place, 462 U. S. 696, 707, and
it is undisputed that petitioner possessed a privacy interest in his bag.
The Government's assertion that by exposing his bag to the public, petitioner lost a reasonable expectation that his bag would not be physically
manipulated is rejected. California v. Ciraolo, 476 U. S. 207, and Florida v. Riley, 488 U. S. 445, are distinguishable, because they involved
only visual, as opposed to tactile, observation. Physically invasive inspection is simply more intrusive than purely visual inspection. Under
this Court's Fourth Amendment analysis, a court first asks whether the
individual, by his conduct, has exhibited an actual expectation of privacy; that is, whether he has shown that "he [sought] to preserve [something] as private." Smith v. Maryland, 442 U. S. 735, 740. Here, petitioner sought to preserve privacy by using an opaque bag and placing
it directly above his seat. Second, a court inquires whether the individual's expectation of privacy is "one that society is prepared to recognize
as reasonable." Ibid. Although a bus passenger clearly expects that
other passengers or bus employees may handle his bag, he does not
expect that they will feel the bag in an exploratory manner. But this
is exactly what the agent did here. Pp. 336-339.

Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the

This case presents the question whether a law enforcement officer's physical manipulation of a bus passenger's
carry-on luggage violated the Fourth Amendment's proscription against unreasonable searches. We hold that it did.

Petitioner Steven Dewayne Bond was a passenger on a
Greyhound bus that left California bound for Little Rock,
Arkansas. The bus stopped, as it was required to do, at the
permanent Border Patrol checkpoint in Sierra Blanca, Texas.
Border Patrol Agent Cesar Cantu boarded the bus to check
the immigration status of its passengers. After reaching
the back of the bus, having satisfied himself that the passengers were lawfully in the United States, Agent Cantu began
walking toward the front. Along the way, he squeezed the
soft luggage which passengers had placed in the overhead
storage space above the seats.

336 BOND v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
Petitioner was seated four or five rows from the back of
the bus. As Agent Cantu inspected the luggage in the compartment above petitioner's seat, he squeezed a green canvas
bag and noticed that it contained a "brick-like" object. Petitioner admitted that the bag was his and agreed to allow
Agent Cantu to open it.1 Upon opening the bag, Agent
Cantu discovered a "brick" of methamphetamine. The brick
had been wrapped in duct tape until it was oval-shaped and
then rolled in a pair of pants.

Petitioner was indicted for conspiracy to possess, and possession with intent to distribute, methamphetamine in violation of 84 Stat. 1260, 21 U. S. C. $ 841(a)(1). He moved to
suppress the drugs, arguing that Agent Cantu conducted an
illegal search of his bag. Petitioner's motion was denied,
and the District Court found him guilty on both counts and
sentenced him to 57 months in prison. On appeal, he conceded that other passengers had access to his bag, but contended that Agent Cantu manipulated the bag in a way that
other passengers would not. The Court of Appeals rejected
this argument, stating that the fact that Agent Cantu's manipulation of petitioner's bag was calculated to detect contraband is irrelevant for Fourth Amendment purposes. 167
F. 3d 225, 227 (CA5 1999) (citing California v. Ciraolo, 476
U. S. 207 (1986)). Thus, the Court of Appeals affirmed the
denial of the motion to suppress, holding that Agent Cantu's
manipulation of the bag was not a search within the meaning
of the Fourth Amendment. 167 F. 3d, at 227. We granted
certiorari, 528 U. S. 927 (1999), and now reverse.

The Fourth Amendment provides that "[t]he right of the
people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not
be violated . . . ." A traveler's personal luggage is clearly an
"effect" protected by the Amendment. See United States v.

1 The Government has not argued here that petitioner's consent to
Agent Cantu's opening the bag is a basis for admitting the evidence.

Opinion of the Court
Place, 462 U. S. 696, 707 (1983). Indeed, it is undisputedhere that petitioner possessed a privacy interest in his

bag.But the Government asserts that by exposing his bag to
the public, petitioner lost a reasonable expectation that hisbag would not be physically manipulated. The Government
relies on our decisions in California v. Ciraolo, supra, and
Florida v. Riley, 488 U. S. 445 (1989), for the proposition thatmatters open to public observation are not protected by the

Fourth Amendment. In Ciraolo, we held that police obser-vation of a backyard from a plane flying at an altitude of
1,000 feet did not violate a reasonable expectation of privacy.
Similarly, in Riley, we relied on Ciraolo to hold that police
observation of a greenhouse in a home's curtilage from a helicopter passing at an altitude of 400 feet did not violate the
Fourth Amendment. We reasoned that the property was
"not necessarily protected from inspection that involves no
physical invasion," and determined that because any member
of the public could have lawfully observed the defendants'
property by flying overhead, the defendants' expectation of
privacy was "not reasonable and not one `that society is prepared to honor.' " See Riley, supra, at 449 (explaining and
relying on Ciraolo's reasoning).

But Ciraolo and Riley are different from this case because
they involved only visual, as opposed to tactile, observation.
Physically invasive inspection is simply more intrusive than
purely visual inspection. For example, in Terry v. Ohio, 392
U. S. 1, 16-17 (1968), we stated that a "careful [tactile] exploration of the outer surfaces of a person's clothing all over his
or her body" is a "serious intrusion upon the sanctity of the
person, which may inflict great indignity and arouse strong
resentment, and it is not to be undertaken lightly." Although Agent Cantu did not "frisk" petitioner's person, he
did conduct a probing tactile examination of petitioner's
carry-on luggage. Obviously, petitioner's bag was not part
of his person. But travelers are particularly concerned

Opinion of the Court
about their carry-on luggage; they generally use it to trans-port personal items that, for whatever reason, they prefer to

keep close at hand.Here, petitioner concedes that, by placing his bag in the
overhead compartment, he could expect that it would be ex-posed to certain kinds of touching and handling. But petitioner argues that Agent Cantu's physical manipulation ofhis luggage "far exceeded the casual contact [petitioner]
could have expected from other passengers." Brief for Pe-titioner 18-19. The Government counters that it did not.

Our Fourth Amendment analysis embraces two questions.First, we ask whether the individual, by his conduct, has
exhibited an actual expectation of privacy; that is, whetherhe has shown that "he [sought] to preserve [something] as
private." Smith v. Maryland, 442 U. S. 735, 740 (1979) (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, petitioner sought topreserve privacy by using an opaque bag and placing that

bag directly above his seat. Second, we inquire whether theindividual's expectation of privacy is "one that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable." Ibid. (internal quotation
marks omitted).2 When a bus passenger places a bag in anoverhead bin, he expects that other passengers or bus employees may move it for one reason or another. Thus, a buspassenger clearly expects that his bag may be handled. He
does not expect that other passengers or bus employees will,

2 The parties properly agree that the subjective intent of the law enforcement officer is irrelevant in determining whether that officer's actions
violate the Fourth Amendment. Brief for Petitioner 14; Brief for United
States 33-34; see Whren v. United States, 517 U. S. 806, 813 (1996) (stating
that "we have been unwilling to entertain Fourth Amendment challenges
based on the actual motivations of individual officers"); California v. Ciraolo, 476 U. S. 207, 212 (1986) (rejecting respondent's challenge to "the authority of government to observe his activity from any vantage point or
place if the viewing is motivated by a law enforcement purpose, and not
the result of a casual, accidental observation"). This principle applies to
the agent's acts in this case as well; the issue is not his state of mind, but
the objective effect of his actions.

as a matter of course, feel the bag in an exploratory manner.But this is exactly what the agent did here. We therefore

hold that the agent's physical manipulation of petitioner'sbag violated the Fourth Amendment.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is

Reversed.

Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Scalia joins,dissenting.

Does a traveler who places a soft-sided bag in the sharedoverhead storage compartment of a bus have a "reasonable
expectation" that strangers will not push, pull, prod,squeeze, or otherwise manipulate his luggage? Unlike the
majority, I believe that he does not.Petitioner argues--and the majority points out--that,
even if bags in overhead bins are subject to general "touching" and "handling," this case is special because "Agent
Cantu's physical manipulation of [petitioner's] luggage `far
exceeded the casual contact [he] could have expected from
other passengers.' " Ante, at 338. But the record shows
the contrary. Agent Cantu testified that border patrol officers (who routinely enter buses at designated checkpoints to
run immigration checks) "conduct an inspection of the overhead luggage by squeezing the bags as we're going out."
App. 9. On the occasion at issue here, Agent Cantu "felt a
green bag" which had "a brick-like object in it." Id., at 10.
He explained that he felt "the edges of the brick in the bag,"
id., at 12, and that it was a "[b]rick-like object . . . that,
when squeezed, you could feel an outline of something of [a]
different mass inside of it," id., at 11. Although the agent
acknowledged that his practice was to "squeeze [bags] very
hard," he testified that his touch ordinarily was not "[h]ard
enough to break something inside that might be fragile."
Id., at 15. Petitioner also testified that Agent Cantu
"reached for my bag, and he shook it a little, and squeezed
it." Id., at 18.

340 BOND v. UNITED STATES

Breyer, J., dissenting
How does the "squeezing" just described differ from thetreatment that overhead luggage is likely to receive from

strangers in a world of travel that is somewhat less gentlethan it used to be? I think not at all. See

United States v.
McDonald, 100 F. 3d 1320, 1327 (CA7 1996) (" `[A]ny personwho has travelled on a common carrier knows that luggage

placed in an overhead compartment is always at the mercy of
all people who want to rearrange or move previously placedluggage' "); Eagan, Familiar Anger Takes Flight with Airline

Tussles, Boston Herald, Aug. 15, 1999, p. 8 ("It's dog-eat-dogtrying to cram half your home into overhead compartments"); Massingill, Airlines Ride on the Wings of HighFlying Economy and Travelers Pay Price in Long Lines,
Cramped Airplanes, Kansas City Star, May 9, 1999, p. F4
("[H]undreds of passengers fill overhead compartments with
bulky carry-on bags that they have to cram, recram, and then
remove"); Flinn, Confessions of a Once-Only Carry-On Guy,
San Francisco Examiner, Sept. 6, 1998, p. T2 (flight attendant
"rearranged the contents of three different overhead compartments to free up some room" and then "shoved and
pounded until [the] bag squeezed in"). The trial court,
which heard the evidence, saw nothing unusual, unforeseeable, or special about this agent's squeeze. It found that
Agent Cantu simply "felt the outside of Bond's softside green
cloth bag," and it viewed the agent's activity as "minimally
intrusive touching." App. 23 (Order Denying Motion to
Suppress). The Court of Appeals also noted that, because
"passengers often handle and manipulate other passengers'
luggage," the substantially similar tactile inspection here
was entirely "foreseeable." 167 F. 3d 225, 227 (CA5 1999).

The record and these factual findings are sufficient to resolve this case. The law is clear that the Fourth Amendment protects against government intrusion that upsets an
" `actual (subjective) expectation of privacy' " that is objectively " `reasonable.' " Smith v. Maryland, 442 U. S. 735,
740 (1979) (quoting Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347, 361

Breyer, J., dissenting
(1967) (Harlan, J., concurring)). Privacy itself implies theexclusion of uninvited strangers, not just strangers who

work for the Government. Hence, an individual cannot rea-sonably expect privacy in respect to objects or activities that
he "knowingly exposes to the public." Id., at 351.Indeed, the Court has said that it is not

objectively reasonable to expect privacy if "[a]ny member of the public . . .
could have" used his senses to detect "everything that th[e]officers observed."

California v. Ciraolo, 476 U. S. 207,
213-214 (1986). Thus, it has held that the fact that stran-gers may look down at fenced-in property from an aircraft

or sift through garbage bags on a public street can justify a
similar police intrusion. See ibid.; Florida v. Riley, 488
U. S. 445, 451 (1989) (plurality opinion); California v. Greenwood, 486 U. S. 35, 40-41 (1988); cf. Texas v. Brown, 460 U. S.
730, 740 (1983) (police not precluded from " `ben[ding] down' "
to see since "[t]he general public could peer into the interior
of [the car] from any number of angles"). The comparative
likelihood that strangers will give bags in an overhead compartment a hard squeeze would seem far greater. See
Riley, supra, at 453 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment)
(reasonableness of privacy expectation depends on whether
intrusion is a "sufficiently routine part of modern life").
Consider, too, the accepted police practice of using dogs to
sniff for drugs hidden inside luggage. See, e. g., United
States v. Place, 462 U. S. 696, 699 (1983). Surely it is less
likely that nongovernmental strangers will sniff at another's
bags (or, more to the point, permit their dogs to do so) than
it is that such actors will touch or squeeze another person's
belongings in the process of making room for their own.

Of course, the agent's pur pose here--searching for
drugs--differs dramatically from the intention of a driver or
fellow passenger who squeezes a bag in the process of making more room for another parcel. But in determining
whether an expectation of privacy is reasonable, it is the
effect, not the purpose, that matters. See ante, at 338, n. 2

("[T]he issue is not [the agent's] state of mind, but the objec-tive effect of his actions"); see also

Whren v. United States,
517 U. S. 806, 813 (1996); United States v. Dunn, 480 U. S.294, 304-305 (1987). Few individuals with something to

hide wish to expose that something to the police, howevercareless or indifferent they may be in respect to discovery
by other members of the public. Hence, a Fourth Amendment rule that turns on purpose could prevent police alonefrom intruding where other strangers freely tread. And the

added privacy protection achieved by such an approachwould not justify the harm worked to law enforcement--at
least that is what this Court's previous cases suggest. See
Greenwood, supra, at 41 ("[T]he police cannot reasonably be
expected to avert their eyes from evidence of criminal activity that could have been observed by any member of the
public"); Ciraolo, supra, at 212-213 (rejecting respondent's
argument that the police should be restricted solely because
their actions are "motivated by a law enforcement purpose,
and not the result of a casual, accidental observation").

Nor can I accept the majority's effort to distinguish
"tactile" from "visual" interventions, see ante, at 337, even
assuming that distinction matters here. Whether tactile
manipulation (say, of the exterior of luggage) is more intrusive or less intrusive than visual observation (say, through
a lighted window) necessarily depends on the particular
circumstances.

If we are to depart from established legal principles, we
should not begin here. At best, this decision will lead to a
constitutional jurisprudence of "squeezes," thereby complicating further already complex Fourth Amendment law, increasing the difficulty of deciding ordinary criminal matters,
and hindering the administrative guidance (with its potential
for control of unreasonable police practices) that a less complicated jurisprudence might provide. Cf. Whren, supra, at
815 (warning against the creation of trivial Fourth Amendment distinctions). At worst, this case will deter law en529US2 Unit: $U44 [09-26-01 10:00:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN

forcement officers searching for drugs near borders fromusing even the most nonintrusive touch to help investigate

publicly exposed bags. At the same time, the ubiquity ofnon-governmental pushes, prods, and squeezes (delivered by
driver, attendant, passenger, or some other stranger) meansthat this decision cannot do much to protect true privacy.
Rather, the traveler who wants to place a bag in a sharedoverhead bin and yet safeguard its contents from public
touch should plan to pack those contents in a suitcase withhard sides, irrespective of the Court's decision today.

For these reasons, I dissent.

NORFOLK SOUTHERN RAILWAY CO. v. SHANKLIN,

individually and as next friend of SHANKLIN

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe sixth circuit

No. 99-312. Argued March 1, 2000--Decided April 17, 2000
The Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 (FRSA) authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to promulgate regulations and issue orders for
railroad safety, and it requires the Secretary to maintain a coordinated
effort to solve railroad grade crossing problems. The FRSA also has
an express pre-emption provision. One regulation promulgated by
the Secretary, through the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA),
addresses the adequacy of warning devices installed under the Federal
Railway-Highway Crossings Program (Crossings Program). That program provides funds to States for the construction of such devices pursuant to the Highway Safety Act of 1973. According to the regulation, adequate warning devices installed using federal funds, where
any of several conditions are present, are automatic gates and flashing
lights. 23 CFR $ 646.214(b)(3). For crossings where those conditions
are not present, a State's decision about what devices to install is subject to FHWA approval. $ 646.214(b)(4). Respondent's husband was
killed when petitioner's train hit his vehicle at a crossing with advance
warning signs and reflectorized crossbucks that the Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT) had installed using federal funds under
the Crossings Program. The signs were installed and fully compliant
with applicable federal standards. Respondent brought a diversity
wrongful death action in federal court, alleging that petitioner was
negligent in, among other things, failing to maintain adequate warning
devices at the crossing. The District Court denied petitioner's summary judgment motion, holding that the FRSA did not pre-empt respondent's inadequate warning device claim. After a trial, the jury
awarded respondent damages on this and other negligence issues. The
Sixth Circuit affirmed.

Held: The FRSA, in conjunction with $$ 646.214(b)(3) and (4), pre-empts

state tort claims concerning a railroad's failure to maintain adequate
warning devices at crossings where federal funds have participated in
the devices' installation. In CSX Transp., Inc. v. Easterwood, 507
U. S. 658, 670, this Court held that, because $$ 646.214(b)(3) and (4) "establish requirements as to the installation of particular warning devices," "when they are applicable, state tort law is pre-empted." Thus,

Syllabus
the sole question here is whether they "are applicable" to all warning devices actually installed with federal funds. Easterwood answers
this question as well, because it held that the requirements in (b)(3)
and (4) are mandatory for all such devices. Id., at 666. They establish a standard of adequacy that determines the type of warning device
to be installed when federal funds participate in the crossing improvement project. Once the FHWA has approved and funded the
improvement and the devices are installed and operating, the regulation displaces state and private decisionmaking authority with a
federal-law requirement. Importantly, this is precisely the interpretation of $$ 646.214(b)(3) and (4) that the FHWA endorsed in Easterwood. The Government's position here--that (b)(3) and (4) only apply
where the warning devices have been selected based on diagnostic
studies and particularized analyses of a crossing's conditions--is not
entitled to deference, because it contradicts the regulation's plain text
as well as the FHWA's own previous construction that the Court
adopted as authoritative in Easterwood. Respondent's argument that
pre-emption does not apply here because this crossing presented several (b)(3) factors, and because the TDOT did not install pavement
markings required by the FHWA's Manual on Uniform Traffic Control
Devices, misconceives how pre-emption operates under these circumstances. If they are applicable, $$ 646.214(b)(3) and (4) establish a federal standard for adequacy that displaces state tort law addressing the
same subject. Whether the State should have originally installed different or additional devices, or whether conditions at the crossing have
since changed such that different devices would be appropriate, is immaterial. Nothing prevents a State from revisiting the adequacy of
devices installed using federal funds, or from installing more protective devices at such crossings with their own funds or additional FHWA
funding, but the State cannot hold the railroad responsible for the adequacy of those devices. Pp. 352-359.

Opinion of the Court
Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case involves an action for damages against a railroaddue to its alleged failure to maintain adequate warning

devices at a grade crossing in western Tennessee. Afterher husband was killed in a crossing accident, respondent
brought suit against petitioner, the operator of the train in-volved in the collision. Respondent claimed that the warning signs posted at the crossing, which had been installedusing federal funds, were insufficient to warn motorists of
the danger posed by passing trains. The specific issue wemust decide is whether the Federal Railroad Safety Act of
1970, 84 Stat. 971, as amended, 49 U. S. C. $ 20101 et seq.,in conjunction with the Federal Highway Administration's
regulation addressing the adequacy of warning devices in-stalled with federal funds, pre-empts state tort actions such
as respondent's. We hold that it does.

I
A

In 1970, Congress enacted the Federal Railroad Safety Act(FRSA) "to promote safety in every area of railroad operations and reduce railroad-related accidents and incidents."49 U. S. C. $ 20101. The FRSA grants the Secretary of
Transportation the authority to "prescribe regulations andissue orders for every area of railroad safety," $ 20103(a), and
directs the Secretary to "maintain a coordinated effort todevelop and carry out solutions to the railroad grade crossing
problem," $ 20134(a). The FRSA also contains an expresspre-emption provision, which states:

"Laws, regulations, and orders related to railroadsafety shall be nationally uniform to the extent practicable. A State may adopt or continue in force a law,regulation, or order related to railroad safety until the
Secretary of Transportation prescribes a regulation or

Opinion of the Court
issues an order covering the subject matter of the Staterequirement." $ 20106.

Although the pre-emption provision contains an exception,see

ibid., it is inapplicable here.
Three years after passing the FRSA, Congress enactedthe Highway Safety Act of 1973, $ 203, 87 Stat. 283, which,

among other things, created the Federal Railway-HighwayCrossings Program (Crossings Program), see 23 U. S. C.

$ 130. That program makes funds available to States for the"cost of construction of projects for the elimination of hazards of railway-highway crossings." $ 130(a). To partici-pate in the Crossings Program, all States must "conduct and
systematically maintain a survey of all highways to identifythose railroad crossings which may require separation, relocation, or protective devices, and establish and implement

a schedule of projects for this purpose." $ 130(d). Thatschedule must, "[a]t a minimum, . . . provide signs for all

railway-highway crossings." Ibid.The Secretary, through the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), has promulgated several regulations implementing the Crossings Program. One of those regulations,
23 CFR $ 646.214(b) (1999), addresses the design of grade
crossing improvements. More specifically, $$ 646.214(b)(3)
and (4) address the adequacy of warning devices installed
under the program.* According to $ 646.214(b)(3), "[a]de*Sections 646.214(b)(3) and (4) provide in full:
"(3)(i) Adequate warning devices, under $ 646.214(b)(2) or on any project
where Federal-aid funds participate in the installation of the devices are
to include automatic gates with flashing light signals when one or more of
the following conditions exist:

"(A) Multiple main line railroad tracks.
"(B) Multiple tracks at or in the vicinity of the crossing which may be
occupied by a train or locomotive so as to obscure the movement of another
train approaching the crossing.

"(C) High Speed train operation combined with limited sight distance
at either single or multiple track crossings.

Opinion of the Court
quate warning devices . . . on any project where Federal-aid
funds participate in the installation of the devices are to
include automatic gates with flashing light signals" if any
of several conditions are present. Those conditions include (A) "[m]ultiple main line railroad tracks," (B) multiple
tracks in the vicinity such that one train might "obscure
the movement of another train approaching the crossing,"
(C) high speed trains combined with limited sight distances, (D) a "combination of high speeds and moderately
high volumes of highway and railroad traffic," (E) the use
of the crossing by "substantial numbers of schoolbuses or
trucks carrying hazardous materials," or (F) when a "diagnostic team recommends them." $ 646.214(b)(3)(i). Subsection (b)(4) states that "[f]or crossings where the requirements of $ 646.214(b)(3) are not applicable, the type of
warning device to be installed, whether the determination is
made by a State regulatory agency, State highway agency,
and/or the railroad, is subject to the approval of FHWA."
Thus, at crossings where any of the conditions listed in (b)(3)
exist, adequate warning devices, if installed using federal
funds, are automatic gates and flashing lights. And where
the (b)(3) conditions are not present, the decision of what
devices to install is subject to FHWA approval.

350 NORFOLK SOUTHERN R. CO. v. SHANKLIN

Opinion of the Court

B
Shortly after 5 a.m. on October 3, 1993, Eddie Shanklindrove his truck eastward on Oakwood Church Road in

Gibson County, Tennessee. App. to Pet. for Cert. 28a. AsShanklin crossed the railroad tracks that intersect the road,
he was struck and killed by a train operated by petitioner.
Ibid. At the time of the accident, the Oakwood ChurchRoad crossing was equipped with advance warning signs and

reflectorized crossbucks, id., at 34a, the familiar black-and-white, X-shaped signs that read "RAILROAD CROSSING,"
see U. S. Dept. of Transportation, Federal Highway Adminis-tration, Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices $ 8B-2
(1988) (MUTCD). The Tennessee Department of Transpor-tation (TDOT) had installed the signs in 1987 with federal
funds received under the Crossings Program. App. to Pet.for Cert. 3a. The TDOT had requested the funds as part
of a project to install such signs at 196 grade crossings in11 Tennessee counties. See App. 128-131. That request
contained information about each crossing covered by theproject, including the presence or absence of several of the
factors listed in $ 646.214(b)(3). See id., at 134. TheFHWA approved the project, App. to Pet. for Cert. 34a,
and federal funds accounted for 99% of the cost of installingthe signs at the crossings, see App. 133. It is undisputed
that the signs at the Oakwood Church Road crossing wereinstalled and fully compliant with the federal standards for
such devices at the time of the accident.Following the accident, Mr. Shanklin's widow, respondent
Dedra Shanklin, brought this diversity wrongful death actionagainst petitioner in the United States District Court for the
Western District of Tennessee. Id., at 29-34. Respond-ent's claims were based on Tennessee statutory and common
law. Id., at 31-33. She alleged that petitioner had beennegligent in several respects, including by failing to maintain
adequate warning devices at the crossing. Ibid. Petitionermoved for summary judgment on the ground that the FRSA

351Cite as: 529 U. S. 344 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
pre-empted respondent's suit. App. to Pet. for Cert. 28a.The District Court held that respondent's allegation that the

signs installed at the crossing were inadequate was not pre-empted.

Id., at 29a-37a. Respondent thus presented her
inadequate warning device claim and three other allegationsof negligence to a jury, which found that petitioner and

Mr. Shanklin had both been negligent. App. 47. The jury
assigned 70% responsibility to petitioner and 30% to Mr.Shanklin, and it assessed damages of $615,379.

Ibid. The
District Court accordingly entered judgment of $430,765.30for respondent.

Id., at 48.
The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed, holding that the FRSA did not pre-empt respondent's claim that
the devices at the crossing were inadequate. 173 F. 3d 386
(1999). It reasoned that federal funding alone is insufficient
to trigger pre-emption of state tort actions under the FRSA
and $$ 646.214(b)(3) and (4). Id., at 394. Instead, the railroad must establish that $ 646.214(b)(3) or (4) was "applied"
to the crossing at issue, meaning that the FHWA affirmatively approved the particular devices installed at the crossing as adequate for safety. Id., at 397. The court concluded
that, because the TDOT had installed the signs for the purpose of providing "minimum protection" at the Oakwood
Church Road crossing, there had been no such individualized
determination of adequacy.

We granted certiorari, 528 U. S. 949 (1999), to resolve a
conflict among the Courts of Appeals as to whether the
FRSA, by virtue of 23 CFR $$ 646.214(b)(3) and (4) (1999),
pre-empts state tort claims concerning a railroad's failure to
maintain adequate warning devices at crossings where federal funds have participated in the installation of the devices.
Compare Ingram v. CSX Transp., Inc., 146 F. 3d 858 (CA11
1998) (holding that federal funding of crossing improvement
triggers pre-emption under FRSA); Armijo v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe R. Co., 87 F. 3d 1188 (CA10 1996) (same);

(CA6 1999) (case below); Shots v. CSX Transp., Inc., 38 F. 3d304 (CA7 1994) (no pre-emption until representative of Federal Government has determined that devices installed areadequate for safety).

II
We previously addressed the pre-emptive effect of theFHWA's regulations implementing the Crossings Program in

CSX Transp., Inc. v. Easterwood, 507 U. S. 658 (1993). Inthat case, we explained that the language of the FRSA's
pre-emption provision dictates that, to pre-empt state law,the federal regulation must "cover" the same subject matter,
and not merely " `touch upon' or `relate to' that subject mat-ter." Id., at 664; see also 49 U. S. C. $ 20106. Thus, "preemption will lie only if the federal regulations substantiallysubsume the subject matter of the relevant state law." Easterwood, supra, at 664. Applying this standard, we con-cluded that the regulations contained in 23 CFR pt. 924
(1999), which "establish the general terms of the bargain be-tween the Federal and State Governments" for the Crossings Program, are not pre-emptive. 507 U. S., at 667. Wealso held that $ 646.214(b)(1), which requires that all traffic
control devices installed under the program comply with theMUTCD, does not pre-empt state tort actions.

Id., at 668-670. The MUTCD "provides a description of, rather than

a prescription for, the allocation of responsibility for gradecrossing safety between Federal and State Governments and
between States and railroads," and hence "disavows anyclaim to cover the subject matter of that body of law." Id.,
at 669-670.With respect to $$ 646.214(b)(3) and (4), however, we
reached a different conclusion. Because those regulations"establish requirements as to the installation of particular
warning devices," we held that "when they are applicable,state tort law is pre-empted."

Id., at 670. Unlike the other

529US2 Unit: $U45 [09-26-01 10:03:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN

353Cite as: 529 U. S. 344 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
regulations, "$$ 646.214(b)(3) and (4) displace state and pri-vate decisionmaking authority by establishing a federal-law

requirement that certain protective devices be installed orfederal approval obtained."

Ibid. As a result, those regulations "effectively set the terms under which railroads areto participate in the improvement of crossings."

Ibid.
In Easterwood itself, we ultimately concluded that the
plaintiff 's state tort claim was not pre-empted. Ibid. Ashere, the plaintiff brought a wrongful death action alleging

that the railroad had not maintained adequate warning de-vices at a particular grade crossing.

Id., at 661. We held
that $$ 646.214(b)(3) and (4) were not applicable because the
warning devices for which federal funds had been obtained
were never actually installed at the crossing where the accident occurred. Id., at 671-673. Nonetheless, we made
clear that, when they do apply, $$ 646.214(b)(3) and (4) "cover
the subject matter of state law which, like the tort law on
which respondent relies, seeks to impose an independent
duty on a railroad to identify and/or repair dangerous crossings." Id., at 671. The sole question in this case, then, is
whether $$ 646.214(b)(3) and (4) "are applicable" to all warning devices actually installed with federal funds.

We believe that Easterwood answers this question as
well. As an original matter, one could plausibly read

$$ 646.214(b)(3) and (4) as being purely definitional, establishing a standard for the adequacy of federally funded warning
devices but not requiring that all such devices meet that
standard. Easterwood rejected this approach, however, and
held that the requirements spelled out in (b)(3) and (4) are
mandatory for all warning devices installed with federal
funds. "[F]or projects that involve grade crossings . . . in
which `Federal-aid funds participate in the installation of the
[warning] devices,' regulations specify warning devices that
must be installed." Id., at 666 (emphasis added). Once it
is accepted that the regulations are not merely definitional,
their scope is plain: They apply to "any project where

529US2 Unit: $U45 [09-26-01 10:03:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN
354 NORFOLK SOUTHERN R. CO. v. SHANKLIN

Opinion of the Court
Federal-aid funds participate in the installation of the de-vices." 23 CFR $ 646.214(b)(3)(i) (1999).

Sections 646.214(b)(3) and (4) therefore establish a stand-ard of adequacy that "determine[s] the devices to be installed" when federal funds participate in the crossing im-provement project. Easterwood, 507 U. S., at 671. If a
crossing presents those conditions listed in (b)(3), the Statemust install automatic gates and flashing lights; if the (b)(3)
factors are absent, (b)(4) dictates that the decision as to whatdevices to install is subject to FHWA approval. See

id., at670-671. In either case, $ 646.214(b)(3) or (4) "is applicable"

and determines the type of warning device that is "ade-quate" under federal law. As a result, once the FHWA has
funded the crossing improvement and the warning devicesare actually installed and operating, the regulation "displace[s] state and private decisionmaking authority by estab-lishing a federal-law requirement that certain protective devices be installed or federal approval obtained." Id., at 670.Importantly, this is precisely the interpretation of

$$ 646.214(b)(3) and (4) that the FHWA endorsed in Easterwood. Appearing as amicus curiae, the Government ex-plained that $ 646.214(b) "establishes substantive standards

for what constitutes adequate safety devices on grade cross-ing improvement projects financed with federal funds."
Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae in CSX Transp.,Inc. v. Easterwood, O. T. 1992, Nos. 91-790 and 91-1206, p. 23.
As a result, $$ 646.214(b)(3) and (4) "cover the subject matterof adequate safety devices at crossings that have been improved with the use of federal funds." Ibid. More specifi-cally, the Government stated that $ 646.214(b)

"requires gate arms in certain circumstances, and re-quires FHWA approval of the safety devices in all other
circumstances. Thus, the warning devices in place at acrossing improved with the use of federal funds have, by
definition, been specifically found to be adequate under aregulation issued by the Secretary. Any state rule that

Opinion of the Court
more or different crossing devices were necessary at afederally funded crossing is therefore preempted." Id.,

at 24.
Thus, Easterwood adopted the FHWA's own understandingof the application of $$ 646.214(b)(3) and (4), a regulation that

the agency had been administering for 17 years.Respondent and the Government now argue that

$$ 646.214(b)(3) and (4) are more limited in scope and onlyapply where the warning devices have been selected based
on diagnostic studies and particularized analyses of the con-ditions at the crossing. See Brief for Respondent 16, 24;
Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 22 (hereinafterBrief for United States). They contend that the Crossings
Program actually comprises two distinct programs--the"minimum protection" program and the "priority" or "hazard" program. See Brief for Respondent 1-7; Brief forUnited States 15-21. Under the "minimum protection" program, they argue, States obtain federal funds merely toequip crossings with advance warning signs and reflectorized
crossbucks, the bare minimum required by the MUTCD,without any judgment as to whether the signs are adequate.
See Brief for Respondent 5-7, 30-36; Brief for United States15-21. Under the "priority" or "hazard" program, in contrast, diagnostic teams conduct individualized assessments ofparticular crossings, and state or FHWA officials make specific judgments about the adequacy of the warning devicesusing the criteria set out in $ 646.214(b)(3). See Brief for
Respondent 5-7, 34-35; Brief for United States 18-21.They therefore contend that (b)(3) and (4) only apply to devices installed under the "priority" or "hazard" program,when a diagnostic team has actually applied the decisional
process mandated by (b)(3). See Brief for Respondent 16;Brief for United States 18-25. Only then has the regulation
prescribed a federal standard for the adequacy of the warn-ing devices that displaces state law covering the same
subject.

356 NORFOLK SOUTHERN R. CO. v. SHANKLIN

Opinion of the Court
This construction, however, contradicts the regulation'splain text. Sections 646.214(b)(3) and (4) make no distinction between devices installed for "minimum protection" andthose installed under a so-called "priority" or "hazard" program. Nor does their applicability depend on any individu-alized determination of adequacy by a diagnostic team or an
FHWA official. Rather, as the FHWA itself explained in its
Easterwood brief, $$ 646.214(b)(3) and (4) have a "compre-hensive scope." Brief for United States in

CSX Transp.,
Inc. v. Easterwood, O. T. 1992, Nos. 91-790 and 91-1206, at12. Section 646.214(b)(3) states that its requirements apply

to "any project where Federal-aid funds participate in the
installation of the devices." 23 CFR $ 646.214(b)(3)(i) (1999)
(emphasis added). And $ 646.214(b)(4) applies to all federally funded crossings that do not meet the criteria specified
in (b)(3). Either way, the federal standard for adequacy
applies to the crossing improvement and "substantially
subsume[s] the subject matter of the relevant state law."
Easterwood, 507 U. S., at 664.

Thus, contrary to the Government's positi on here,

$$ 646.214(b)(3) and (4) "specify warning devices that must
be installed" as a part of all federally funded crossing improvements. Id., at 666. Although generally "an agency's
construction of its own regulations is entitled to substantial
deference," Lyng v. Payne, 476 U. S. 926, 939 (1986), no such
deference is appropriate here. Not only is the FHWA's interpretation inconsistent with the text of $$ 646.214(b)(3) and
(4), see Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, 490
U. S. 332, 359 (1989), but it also contradicts the agency's own
previous construction that this Court adopted as authoritative in Easterwood, cf. Maislin Industries, U. S., Inc. v. Primary Steel, Inc., 497 U. S. 116, 131 (1990) ("Once we have
determined a statute's clear meaning, we adhere to that determination under the doctrine of stare decisis, and we judge
an agency's later interpretation of the statute against our
prior determination of the statute's meaning").

Opinion of the Court
The dissent contends that, under our holding, state law ispre-empted even though "[n]o authority, federal or state, has

found that the signs in place" are "adequate to protectsafety."

Post, at 360 (opinion of Ginsburg, J.). This presupposes that States have not fulfilled their obligation tocomply with $$ 646.214(b)(3) and (4). Those subsections establish a standard for adequacy that States are required to
follow in determining what devices to install when federalfunds are used. The dissent also argues that

Easterwood
did not hold that federal funding of the devices is "sufficient"to effect pre-emption, and that "any statement as to the automatic preemptive effect of federal funding should have remained open for reconsideration in a later case." Post,
at 361. But Easterwood did not, in fact, leave this question
open. Instead, at the behest of the FHWA, the Court
clearly stated that $$ 646.214(b)(3) and (4) pre-empt state
tort claims concerning the adequacy of all warning devices
installed with the participation of federal funds.

Respondent also argues that pre-emption does not lie in
this particular case because the Oakwood Church Road
crossing presented several of the factors listed in

$ 646.214(b)(3), and because the TDOT did not install pavement markings as required by the MUTCD. See Brief for
Respondent 20-22, 36; Brief in Opposition 6-8. This misconceives how pre-emption operates under these circumstances. When the FHWA approves a crossing improvement project and the State installs the warning devices
using federal funds, $$ 646.214(b)(3) and (4) establish a federal standard for the adequacy of those devices that displaces
state tort law addressing the same subject. At that point,
the regulation dictates "the devices to be installed and the
means by which railroads are to participate in their selection." Easterwood, supra, at 671. It is this displacement
of state law concerning the devices' adequacy, and not the
State's or the FHWA's adherence to the standard set out
in $$ 646.214(b)(3) and (4) or to the requirements of the

529US2 Unit: $U45 [09-26-01 10:03:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN
358 NORFOLK SOUTHERN R. CO. v. SHANKLIN

Opinion of the Court
MUTCD, that pre-empts state tort actions. Whether theState should have originally installed different or additional

devices, or whether conditions at the crossing have sincechanged such that automatic gates and flashing lights would
be appropriate, is immaterial to the pre-emption question.It should be noted that nothing prevents a State from revisiting the adequacy of devices installed using federal funds.
States are free to install more protective devices at suchcrossings with their own funds or with additional funding

from the FHWA. What States cannot do--once they haveinstalled federally funded devices at a particular crossing--
is hold the railroad responsible for the adequacy of those devices. The dissent objects that this bestows on railroads a
"double windfall": The Federal Government pays for the installation of the devices, and the railroad is simultaneously
absolved of state tort liability. Post, at 360-361. But the
same is true of the result urged by respondent and the Government. Respondent and the Government acknowledge
that $$ 646.214(b)(3) and (4) can pre-empt state tort law, but
they argue that pre-emption only occurs when the State has
installed the devices pursuant to a diagnostic team's analysis
of the crossing in question. Under this reading, railroads
would receive the same "double windfall"--federal funding
of the devices and pre-emption of state tort law--so long as
a diagnostic team has evaluated the crossing. The supposed
conferral of a "windfall" on the railroads therefore casts no
doubt on our construction of the regulation.

Sections 646.214(b)(3) and (4) "cover the subject matter"
of the adequacy of warning devices installed with the participation of federal funds. As a result, the FRSA pre-empts
respondent's state tort claim that the advance warning
signs and reflectorized crossbucks installed at the Oakwood
Church Road crossing were inadequate. Because the TDOT
used federal funds for the signs' installation, $$ 646.214(b)(3)
and (4) governed the selection and installation of the devices.
And because the TDOT determined that warning devices

529US2 Unit: $U45 [09-26-01 10:03:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN

359Cite as: 529 U. S. 344 (2000)
concurring
other than automatic gates and flashing lights were appro-priate, its decision was subject to the approval of the FHWA.

See $ 646.214(b)(4). Once the FHWA approved the projectand the signs were installed using federal funds, the federal
standard for adequacy displaced Tennessee statutory andcommon law addressing the same subject, thereby preempting respondent's claim.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuitis reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings

consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice Breyer, concurring.
I agree with Justice Ginsburg that "common sense andsound policy" suggest that federal

minimum safety standards should not pre-empt a state tort action claiming that in
the particular circumstance a railroad's warning device remains inadequate. Post, at 360 (dissenting opinion). But the
Federal Government has the legal power to do more. And,
as the majority points out, ante, at 353-356, the specific Federal Highway Administration regulations at issue here do,
in fact, do more--when read in light of CSX Transp., Inc. v.
Easterwood, 507 U. S. 658 (1993), which faithfully replicates
the Government's own earlier interpretation. So read, they
say that once federal funds are requested and spent to install
warning devices at a grade crossing, the regulations' standards of adequacy apply across the board and pre-empt state
law seeking to impose an independent duty on a railroad
with respect to the adequacy of warning devices installed.
Id., at 671; ante, at 357. I see no need here to reconsider
the relevant language in this Court's earlier opinion because the Government itself can easily avoid the pre-emption
that it previously sought. It can simply change the relevant
regulations, for example, by specifying that federal money is
sometimes used for "minimum," not "adequate," programs,
which minimum programs lack pre-emptive force. The

dissenting
agency remains free to amend its regulations to achieve thecommonsense result that the Government itself now seeks.

With that understanding, I join the majority's opinion.

Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Stevens joins,
dissenting.

A fatal accident occurred on October 3, 1993, at a railroad
crossing in Gibson County, Tennessee. The crossing wasequipped not with automatic gates or flashing lights, but

only with basic warning signs installed with federal fundsprovided under the Federal Railway-Highway Crossings
Program. See 23 U. S. C. $ 130. This federal programaimed to ensure that States would, "[a]t a minimum, . . .
provide signs for all railway-highway crossings." $ 130(d).No authority, federal or state, has found that the signs in
place at the scene of the Gibson County accident were adequate to protect safety, as distinguished from being a bare
minimum. Nevertheless, the Court today holds that wholesale federal funding of improvements at 196 crossings
throughout 11 west Tennessee counties preempts all state
regulation of safety devices at each individual crossing. As
a result, respondent Dedra Shanklin cannot recover under
state tort law for the railroad's failure to install adequate
devices. And the State of Tennessee, because it used federal money to provide at least minimum protection, is
stopped from requiring the installation of adequate devices
at any of the funded crossings.

The upshot of the Court's decision is that state negligence
law is displaced with no substantive federal standard of
conduct to fill the void. That outcome defies common sense
and sound policy. Federal regulations already provide that
railroads shall not be required to pay any share of the cost
of federally financed grade crossing improvements. 23 CFR

$ 646.210(b)(1) (1999). Today the railroads have achieved a
double windfall: the Federal Government foots the bill for
installing safety devices; and that same federal expenditure

dissenting
spares the railroads from tort liability, even for the in-adequacy of devices designed only to secure the "minimum"

protection Congress envisioned for all crossings. See 23U. S. C. $ 130(d). Counsel for petitioner Norfolk Southern
Railway correctly conceded at oral argument that the rele-vant statutes do not compel releasing the railroads when the
devices installed, though meeting federal standards for "min-imum" protection, see

ante, at 350, fail to provide adequateprotection. The road is open for the Secretary of Transportation to enact regulations clarifying that point. See ante,at 359-360 (B

reyer, J., concurring).As persuasively explained by the Court of Appeals for the

Seventh Circuit in Shots v. CSX Transp., Inc., 38 F. 3d 304(1994) (Posner, C. J.), and reiterated by the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in the instant case, 173 F. 3d 386(1999), our prior decision in

CSX Transp., Inc. v. Easter-wood, 507 U. S. 658 (1993), does not necessitate the ouster of

state law the Court now commands. Easterwood, in whichthe tort claimant prevailed, dispositively held only that federal funding was necessary to trigger preemption, not thatit was sufficient by itself to do so. Because federal funds
did not in fact subsidize the crossing at issue in that case,
id., at 671-673, any statement as to the automatic pre-emptive effect of federal funding should have remained open

for reconsideration in a later case where federal funds didparticipate. I do not read the admittedly unclear language
of 23 CFR $$ 646.214(b)(3) and (4) (1999) to dictate that Fed-eral Highway Administration authorization of federal funding to install devices is tantamount to approval of each ofthose devices as adequate to protect safety at every crossing
so funded. And I do not think a previous administration'sargument to that effect as

amicus curiae in Easterwoodestops the Government from taking a different view now. I

agree with the sound reasoning in Shots and would affirmthe Court of Appeals' judgment.

362 OCTOBER TERM, 1999

Syllabus

WILLIAMS v. TAYLOR, WARDEN
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fourth circuit

No. 98-8384. Argued October 4, 1999--Decided April 18, 2000
A Virginia jury convicted petitioner Williams of robbery and capital

murder, and, after a sentencing hearing, found a probability of future
dangerousness and unanimously fixed his punishment at death. Concluding that such punishment was "proper" and "just," the trial judge
imposed the death sentence. The Virginia Supreme Court affirmed.
In state habeas corpus proceedings, the same trial judge found, on the
evidence adduced after hearings, that Williams' conviction was valid,
but that his counsel's failure to discover and present significant mitigating evidence violated his right to the effective assistance of counsel
under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668. In rejecting the trial
judge's recommendation that Williams be resentenced, the State Supreme Court held, inter alia, that the trial judge had failed to recognize
that Strickland had been modified by Lockhart v. Fretwell, 506 U. S.
364, 369, and that Williams had not suffered sufficient prejudice to warrant relief. In habeas corpus proceedings under 28 U. S. C. $ 2254, the
federal trial judge agreed with the state trial judge that the death
sentence was constitutionally infirm on ineffective-assistance grounds.
The federal judge identified five categories of mitigating evidence that
counsel had failed to introduce and rejected the argument that such
failure had been a strategic decision to rely primarily on the fact that
Williams had confessed voluntarily. As to prejudice, the judge determined, among other things, that there was a reasonable probability that,
but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding
would have been different, see Strickland, 466 U. S., at 694. Applying
an amended version of $ 2254(d)(1) enacted in the Antiterrorism and
Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), the judge concluded that
the Virginia Supreme Court's decision "was contrary to, or involved an
unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States." The Fourth Circuit reversed, construing $ 2254(d)(1) to prohibit federal habeas relief
unless the state court had interpreted or applied the relevant precedent
in a manner that reasonable jurists would all agree is unreasonable.
The court declared that it could not say that the Virginia Supreme
Court's decision on prejudice was an unreasonable application of the
Strickland or Lockhart standards established by the Supreme Court.

Held: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
163 F. 3d 860, reversed and remanded.

Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court as to Parts I,
III, and IV, concluding that Williams was denied his constitutionally
guaranteed right to the effective assistance of counsel, as defined in
Strickland, when his trial lawyers failed to investigate and to present
substantial mitigating evidence to the sentencing jury. Pp. 390-398.

(a) The threshold question under AEDPA--whether Williams seeks
to apply a rule of law that was clearly established at the time his statecourt conviction became final--is easily answered because the merits of
his claim are squarely governed by Strickland. To establish ineffective
assistance of counsel, the defendant must prove: (1) that counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, 466 U. S.,
at 688; and (2) that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense,
which requires a showing that there is a reasonable probability that,
but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding
would have been different, id., at 694. Because the Strickland test
qualifies as "clearly established Federal law, as determined by the
Supreme Court," this Court's precedent "dictated" that the Virginia
Supreme Court apply that test in entertaining Williams' ineffectiveassistance claim. See Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288, 301. Pp. 390-391.

(b) Williams is entitled to relief because the Virginia Supreme Court's
decision rejecting his ineffective-assistance claim both is "contrary to,
[and] involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law." Strickland provides sufficient guidance for resolving virtually all ineffective-assistance claims, and the Virginia Supreme Court
erred in holding that Lockhart modified or in some way supplanted
Strickland. Although there are a few situations in which the overriding focus on fundamental fairness may affect the analysis, see Strickland, 466 U. S., at 692, cases such as Lockhart and Nix v. Whiteside,
475 U. S. 157, do not justify a departure from a straightforward application of Strickland when counsel's ineffectiveness deprives the defendant
of a substantive or procedural right to which the law entitles him.
Here, Williams had a constitutionally protected right to provide mitigating evidence that his trial counsel either failed to discover or failed to
offer. Moreover, the Virginia trial judge correctly applied both components of the Strickland standard to Williams' claim. The record establishes that counsel failed to prepare for sentencing until a week beforehand, to uncover extensive records graphically describing Williams'
nightmarish childhood, to introduce available evidence that Williams
was "borderline mentally retarded" and did not advance beyond sixth
grade, to seek prison records recording Williams' commendations for

helping to crack a prison drug ring and for returning a guard's missing
wallet, and to discover the testimony of prison officials who described
Williams as among the inmates least likely to act violently, dangerously,
or provocatively, and of a prison minister that Williams seemed to thrive
in a more regimented environment. Although not all of the additional
evidence was favorable to Williams, the failure to introduce the comparatively voluminous amount of favorable evidence was not justified by a
tactical decision and clearly demonstrates that counsel did not fulfill
their ethical obligation to conduct a thorough investigation of Williams'
background. Moreover, counsel's unprofessional service prejudiced
Williams within Strickland's meaning. The Virginia Supreme Court's
prejudice analysis was unreasonable in at least two respects: (1) It was
not only "contrary to," but also--inasmuch as it relied on the inapplicable Lockhart exception--an "unreasonable application of," the clear law
as established in Strickland; and (2) it failed to evaluate the totality of,
and to accord appropriate weight to, the available mitigation evidence.
Pp. 391-398.

Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court as to Part II
(except as to the footnote), concluding that $ 2254(d)(1) places a new
constraint on the power of a federal habeas court to grant relief to a
state prisoner with respect to claims adjudicated on the merits in state
court: The habeas writ may issue only if the state-court adjudication (1)
"was contrary to," or (2) "involved an unreasonable application of . . ."
clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of
the United States." Pp. 402-413.

(a) Because Williams filed his petition in 1997, his case is not governed by the pre-1996 version of the federal habeas statute, but by the
statute as amended by AEDPA. Accordingly, for Williams to obtain
federal habeas relief, he must first demonstrate that his case satisfies
the condition set by $ 2254(d)(1). That provision modifies the previously
settled rule of independent federal review of state prisoners' habeas
petitions in order to curb delays, to prevent "retrials" on federal habeas,
and to give effect to state convictions to the extent possible under law.
In light of the cardinal principle of statutory construction that courts
must give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute, this
Court must give independent meaning to both the "contrary to" and
"unreasonable application" clauses of $ 2254(d)(1). Given the commonly
understood definitions of "contrary" as "diametrically different," "opposite in character or nature," or "mutually opposed," $ 2254(d)(1)'s first
clause must be interpreted to mean that a federal habeas court may
grant relief if the state court (1) arrives at a conclusion opposite to that
reached by this Court on a question of law or (2) decides a case differ529US2 Unit: $U46 [10-07-01 17:18:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ently than this Court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.
Under the "unreasonable application" clause, a federal habeas court may
grant relief if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from this Court's decisions but unreasonably applies that principle
to the facts of the prisoner's case. Pp. 402-409.

(b) In defining what qualifies as an "unreasonable application of . . .
clearly established Federal law," the Fourth Circuit erred in holding
that a state-court decision involves such an application only if the state
court has applied federal law in a manner that reasonable jurists would
all agree is unreasonable. That standard would tend to mislead federal
habeas courts by focusing on a subjective inquiry. Rather, the federal
court should ask whether the state court's application of clearly established federal law was objectively unreasonable. Cf. Wright v. West,
505 U. S. 277, 304. Although difficult to define, "unreasonable" is a common legal term familiar to federal judges. For present purposes, the
most important point is that an unreasonable application of federal law
is different from an incorrect application of federal law. See, e. g., id.,
at 305. Because Congress specifically used the word "unreasonable,"
and not a term like "erroneous" or "incorrect," a federal habeas court
may not grant relief simply because it concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant state-court decision applied clearly established
federal law erroneously or incorrectly. Rather, that application must
also be unreasonable. Finally, the phrase "clearly established Federal
law, as determined by [this] Court" refers to the holdings, as opposed to
the dicta, of this Court's decisions as of the time of the relevant statecourt decision. In this respect, the quoted phrase bears only a slight
connection to this Court's jurisprudence under Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S.
288. Whatever would qualify as an "old rule" under Teague will constitute "clearly established Federal law, as determined by [this] Court,"
see, e. g., Stringer v. Black, 503 U. S. 222, 228, but with one caveat: Section 2254(d)(1) restricts the source of clearly established law to this
Court's jurisprudence. Pp. 409-413.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Stevens announced the judgment of the Court
and delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts
I, III, and IV, and an opinion with respect to Parts II and V.*

The questions presented are whether Terry Williams' constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel as
defined in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984),
was violated, and whether the judgment of the Virginia Supreme Court refusing to set aside his death sentence "was
contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of,
clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States," within the meaning of
28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d)(1) (1994 ed., Supp. III). We answer
both questions affirmatively.

I
On November 3, 1985, Harris Stone was found dead in his
residence on Henry Street in Danville, Virginia. Finding no
indication of a struggle, local officials determined that the
cause of death was blood alcohol poisoning, and the case was
considered closed. Six months after Stone's death, Terry
Williams, who was then incarcerated in the "I" unit of the
city jail for an unrelated offense, wrote a letter to the police
stating that he had killed " `that man down on Henry
Street' " and also stating that he " `did it' " to that " `lady
down on West Green Street' " and was " `very sorry.' " The
letter was unsigned, but it closed with a reference to "I cell."
App. 41. The police readily identified Williams as its author,
and, on April 25, 1986, they obtained several statements from
him. In one Williams admitted that, after Stone refused to
lend him " `a couple of dollars,' " he had killed Stone with a

mattock and taken the money from his wallet.1 Id., at 4.In September 1986, Williams was convicted of robbery and

capital murder.At Williams' sentencing hearing, the prosecution proved
that Williams had been convicted of armed robbery in 1976and burglary and grand larceny in 1982. The prosecution
also introduced the written confessions that Williams hadmade in April. The prosecution described two auto thefts
and two separate violent assaults on elderly victims perpe-trated after the Stone murder. On December 4, 1985, Williams had started a fire outside one victim's residence beforeattacking and robbing him. On March 5, 1986, Williams had
brutally assaulted an elderly woman on West Green Street--an incident he had mentioned in his letter to the police.
That confession was particularly damaging because otherevidence established that the woman was in a "vegetative
state" and not expected to recover. Id., at 60. Williamshad also been convicted of arson for setting a fire in the jail
while awaiting trial in this case. Two expert witnesses em-ployed by the State testified that there was a "high probabil1 " `I had gone to Dee Dee Stone's house on Henry Street, Dee Dee's
father was there. No one else was there except him. He had been drinking a lot. He was on the bed. He asked me if I wanted a drink. I told
him, `No.' I asked him if I could borrow a couple of dollars and he told
me, `No.' We started arguing and things started going around in my
head. I just wanted to get back at him. I don't know what. He just laid
back like he had passed out. He was laying there talking and moaning to
himself. I went into the kitchen. I saw the butcher knife. I didn't want
to use it. I was looking for something to use. I went into the bathroom
and I saw the mattock. I picked up the mattock and I came back into the
room where he was at. He was laying on the bed. He was laying on his
back. I took the mattock and I hit him on the chest with it. He raised
up and was gasping for his breath. He fell over to his side and I hit him

the mattock back in the bathroom. I came back into the room. I took
his wallet from his pocket. He had three dollars in it. I got the three
dollars from it. I left him there. He was still grasping for breath.' "

Opinion of the Court
ity" that Williams would pose a serious continuing threat to
society. Id., at 89.

The evidence offered by Williams' trial counsel at the sentencing hearing consisted of the testimony of Williams'
mother, two neighbors, and a taped excerpt from a statement
by a psychiatrist. One of the neighbors had not been previously interviewed by defense counsel, but was noticed by
counsel in the audience during the proceedings and asked to
testify on the spot. The three witnesses briefly described
Williams as a "nice boy" and not a violent person. Id., at
124. The recorded psychiatrist's testimony did little more
than relate Williams' statement during an examination that
in the course of one of his earlier robberies, he had removed
the bullets from a gun so as not to injure anyone.

In his cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses, Williams' counsel repeatedly emphasized the fact that Williams
had initiated the contact with the police that enabled them
to solve the murder and to identify him as the perpetrator
of the recent assaults, as well as the car thefts. In closing
argument, Williams' counsel characterized Williams' confessional statements as "dumb," but asked the jury to give
weight to the fact that he had "turned himself in, not on one
crime but on four . . . that the [police otherwise] would not
have solved." Id., at 140. The weight of defense counsel's
closing, however, was devoted to explaining that it was difficult to find a reason why the jury should spare Williams' life.2

2 In defense counsel's words: "I will admit too that it is very difficult to
ask you to show mercy to a man who maybe has not shown much mercy
himself. I doubt very seriously that he thought much about mercy when
he was in Mr. Stone's bedroom that night with him. I doubt very seriously that he had mercy very highly on his mind when he was walking
along West Green and the incident with Alberta Stroud. I doubt very
seriously that he had mercy on his mind when he took two cars that didn't
belong to him. Admittedly it is very difficult to get us and ask that you
give this man mercy when he has shown so little of it himself. But I
would ask that you would." Id., at 132-133.

370 WILLIAMS v. TAYLOR

Opinion of the Court
The jury found a probability of future dangerousness andunanimously fixed Williams' punishment at death. The trial

judge concluded that such punishment was "proper" and"just" and imposed the death sentence. Id., at 154. The
Virginia Supreme Court affirmed the conviction and sen-tence. Williams v. Commonwealth, 234 Va. 168, 360 S. E.
2d 361 (1987), cert. denied, Williams v. Virginia, 484 U. S.1020 (1988). It rejected Williams' argument that when the
trial judge imposed sentence, he failed to give mitigatingweight to the fact that Williams had turned himself in. 234
Va., at 181-182, 360 S. E. 2d, at 369-370.
State Habeas Corpus Proceedings

In 1988 Williams filed for state collateral relief in theDanville Circuit Court. The petition was subsequently

amended, and the Circuit Court (the same judge who hadpresided over Williams' trial and sentencing) held an evidentiary hearing on Williams' claim that trial counsel had beenineffective.

3 Based on the evidence adduced after two days

of hearings, Judge Ingram found that Williams' convictionwas valid, but that his trial attorneys had been ineffective

during sentencing. Among the evidence reviewed that hadnot been presented at trial were documents prepared in connection with Williams' commitment when he was 11 years oldthat dramatically described mistreatment, abuse, and neglect
during his early childhood, as well as testimony that he was"borderline mentally retarded," had suffered repeated head
injuries, and might have mental impairments organic in ori-gin. App. 528-529, 595. The habeas hearing also revealed

Va. Code Ann. $ 8.01-654(C)(1) (Supp. 1999). Shortly after the Circuit
Court held its evidentiary hearing, the Supreme Court assumed jurisdiction over Williams' petition and instructed the Circuit Court to issue findings of fact and legal recommendation regarding Williams' ineffectiveassistance claims.

Opinion of the Court
that the same experts who had testified on the State's behalfat trial believed that Williams, if kept in a "structured environment," would not pose a future danger to society. Id.,at 313-314.

Counsel's failure to discover and present this and othersignificant mitigating evidence was "below the range expected of reasonable, professional competent assistance of
counsel." Id., at 424. Counsel's performance thus "did notmeasure up to the standard required under the holding of

Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984), and [if ithad,] there is a reasonable probability that the result of the
sentencing phase would have been different." Id., at 429.
Judge Ingram therefore recommended that Williams be
granted a rehearing on the sentencing phase of his trial.

The Virginia Supreme Court did not accept that recommendation. Williams v. Warden, 254 Va. 16, 487 S. E. 2d
194 (1997). Although it assumed, without deciding, that
trial counsel had been ineffective, id., at 23-26, 487 S. E. 2d,
at 198, 200, it disagreed with the trial judge's conclusion that
Williams had suffered sufficient prejudice to warrant relief.
Treating the prejudice inquiry as a mixed question of law
and fact, the Virginia Supreme Court accepted the factual
determination that available evidence in mitigation had not
been presented at the trial, but held that the trial judge had
misapplied the law in two respects. First, relying on our
decision in Lockhart v. Fretwell, 506 U. S. 364 (1993), the
court held that it was wrong for the trial judge to rely " `on
mere outcome determination' " when assessing prejudice, 254
Va., at 23, 487 S. E. 2d, at 198 (quoting Lockhart, 506 U. S.,
at 369). Second, it construed the trial judge's opinion as
having "adopted a per se approach" that would establish
prejudice whenever any mitigating evidence was omitted.
254 Va., at 26, 487 S. E. 2d, at 200.

The court then reviewed the prosecution evidence supporting the "future dangerousness" aggravating circumstance, reciting Williams' criminal history, including the sev529US2 Unit: $U46 [10-07-01 17:18:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
eral most recent offenses to which he had confessed. Incomparison, it found that the excluded mitigating evidence--

which it characterized as merely indicating "that numerouspeople, mostly relatives, thought that defendant was nonviolent and could cope very well in a structured environment,"ibid.--"barely would have altered the profile of this defendant that was presented to the jury," ibid. On this basis, thecourt concluded that there was no reasonable possibility that
the omitted evidence would have affected the jury's sentenc-ing recommendation, and that Williams had failed to demonstrate that his sentencing proceeding was fundamentallyunfair.

Federal Habeas Corpus Proceedings

Having exhausted his state remedies, Williams sought afederal writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U. S. C. $ 2254

(1994 ed. and Supp. III). After reviewing the state habeashearing transcript and the state courts' findings of fact and
conclusions of law, the federal trial judge agreed with theVirginia trial judge: The death sentence was constitutionally infirm.After noting that the Virginia Supreme Court had not addressed the question whether trial counsel's performance atthe sentencing hearing fell below the range of competence
demanded of lawyers in criminal cases, the judge began byaddressing that issue in detail. He identified five categories
of mitigating evidence that counsel had failed to introduce,4

4 "(i) Counsel did not introduce evidence of the Petitioner's background. . . . (ii) Counsel did not introduce evidence that Petitioner was
abused by his father. (iii) Counsel did not introduce testimony from correctional officers who were willing to testify that defendant would not
pose a danger while incarcerated. Nor did counsel offer prison commendations awarded to Williams for his help in breaking up a prison drug
ring and for returning a guard's missing wallet. (iv) Several character
witnesses were not called to testify. . . . [T]he testimony of Elliott, a respected CPA in the community, could have been quite important to the
jury . . . . (v) Finally, counsel did not introduce evidence that Petitioner

Opinion of the Court
and he rejected the argument that counsel's failure to con-duct an adequate investigation had been a strategic decision

to rely almost entirely on the fact that Williams had volun-tarily confessed.

According to Williams' trial counsel's testimony before thestate habeas court, counsel did not fail to seek Williams' juvenile and social services records because he thought theywould be counterproductive, but because counsel erroneously believed that " `state law didn't permit it.' " App. 470.Counsel also acknowledged in the course of the hearings that
information about Williams' childhood would have been im-portant in mitigation. And counsel's failure to contact a potentially persuasive character witness was likewise not aconscious strategic choice, but simply a failure to return that
witness' phone call offering his service. Id., at 470-471.Finally, even if counsel neglected to conduct such an investigation at the time as part of a tactical decision, the DistrictJudge found, tactics as a matter of reasonable performance
could not justify the omissions.Turning to the prejudice issue, the judge determined that
there was " `a reasonable probability that, but for counsel'sunprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would
have been different.' Strickland, 466 U. S. at 694." Id., at473. He found that the Virginia Supreme Court had erroneously assumed that Lockhart had modified the Stricklandstandard for determining prejudice, and that it had made an
important error of fact in discussing its finding of no preju-dice.

stand trial." App. 465-469.

5 "Specifically, the Virginia Supreme Court found no prejudice, reasoning: `The mitigation evidence that the prisoner says, in retrospect, his trial
counsel should have discovered and offered barely would have altered the
profile of this defendant that was presented to the jury. At most, this
evidence would have shown that numerous people, mostly relatives,
thought that defendant was nonviolent and could cope very well in a structured environment.' Williams, 487 S. E. 2d at 200. The Virginia Su529US2 Unit: $U46 [10-07-01 17:18:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN

with the standard of review applicable on habeas appealsprovided by 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d) (1994 ed., Supp. III), the

judge concluded that those errors established that the Vir-ginia Supreme Court's decision "was contrary to, or involved
an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federallaw" within the meaning of $ 2254(d)(1).

The Federal Court of Appeals reversed. 163 F. 3d 860
(CA4 1998). It construed $ 2254(d)(1) as prohibiting thegrant of habeas corpus relief unless the state court " `decided

the question by interpreting or applying the relevant prece-dent in a manner that reasonable jurists would all agree is
unreasonable.' " Id., at 865 (quoting Green v. French, 143 F.3d 865, 870 (CA4 1998)). Applying that standard, it could
not say that the Virginia Supreme Court's decision on theprejudice issue was an unreasonable application of the tests
developed in either Strickland or Lockhart.6 It explainedthat the evidence that Williams presented a future danger
to society was "simply overwhelming," 163 F. 3d, at 868, itendorsed the Virginia Supreme Court's interpretation of
Lockhart, 163 F. 3d, at 869, and it characterized the state
court's understanding of the facts in this case as "reason-able,"

id., at 870.

In 1867, Congress enacted a statute providing that federal
courts "shall have power to grant writs of habeas corpus in

preme Court ignored or overlooked the evidence of Williams' difficult
childhood and abuse and his limited mental capacity. It is also unreasonable to characterize the additional evidence as coming from `mostly relatives.' As stated, supra, Bruce Elliott, a respected professional in the
community, and several correctional officers offered to testify on Williams
behalf." Id., at 476.

6 Like the Virginia Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals assumed, without deciding, that the performance of trial counsel fell below an objective
standard of reasonableness. 163 F. 3d, at 867.

settled that the fact that constitutional error occurred in theproceedings that led to a state-court conviction may not

(1993). On the other hand, errors that undermine confidencein the fundamental fairness of the state adjudication certainly justify the issuance of the federal writ. See, e. g.,Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288, 311-314 (1989) (quoting
Mackey v. United States, 401 U. S. 667, 692-694 (1971) (Har-lan, J., concurring in judgments in part and dissenting in
part), and quoting Rose v. Lundy, 455 U. S. 509, 544 (1982)(

Stevens, J., dissenting)). The deprivation of the right tothe effective assistance of counsel recognized in Strickland

is such an error. Strickland, 466 U. S., at 686, 697-698.The warden here contends that federal habeas corpus relief is prohibited by the amendment to 28 U. S. C. $ 2254 (1994ed., Supp. III), enacted as a part of the Antiterrorism and
Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). The rele-vant portion of that amendment provides:

7 By Act of Congress: "(a) Writs of habeas corpus may be granted by the
Supreme Court, any justice thereof, the district courts and any circuit
judge within their respective jurisdictions. . . . (c) The writ of habeas
corpus shall not extend to a prisoner unless-- . . . (3) He is in custody in
violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States . . . ."
28 U. S. C. $ 2241(c)(3). In parallel, $ 2254(a) provides: "The Supreme
Court, a Justice thereof, a circuit judge, or a district court shall entertain
an application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a person in custody
pursuant to the judgment of a State court only on the ground that he
is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the
United States."

Opinion of Stevens, J.
"(d) An application for a writ of habeas corpus on be-half of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of

a State court shall not be granted with respect to anyclaim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court
proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim--"(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or
involved an unreasonable application of, clearly estab-lished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court
of the United States . . . ."
In this case, the Court of Appeals applied the constructionof the amendment that it had adopted in its earlier opinion

in Green v. French, 143 F. 3d 865 (CA4 1998). It read theamendment as prohibiting federal courts from issuing the
writ unless:

"(a) the state court decision is in `square conflict' withSupreme Court precedent that is controlling as to law

and fact or (b) if no such controlling decision exists, `thestate court's resolution of a question of pure law rests
upon an objectively unreasonable derivation of legalprinciples from the relevant [S]upreme [C]ourt precedents, or if its decision rests upon an objectively unrea-sonable application of established principles to new
facts,' " 163 F. 3d, at 865 (quoting Green, 143 F. 3d, at870).

Accordingly, it held that a federal court may issue habeasrelief only if " `the state courts have decided the question by
interpreting or applying the relevant precedent in a mannerthat reasonable jurists would all agree is unreasonable,' " 163
F. 3d, at 865.8

8 The warden's view is narrower. He argues that 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d)(1)
(1994 ed., Supp. III) establishes a new general rule that prohibits federal
courts from granting habeas corpus relief on the basis of any claim that a
state court has adjudicated on the merits, and that $ 2254(d)(1) merely
identifies two narrow exceptions to the general rule--when a state court
has issued a decision "contrary to" or an "unreasonable application of"

Opinion of Stevens, J.
We are convinced that that interpretation of the amendment is incorrect. It would impose a test for determining
when a legal rule is clearly established that simply cannot
be squared with the real practice of decisional law.9 It
would apply a standard for determining the "reasonableness"
of state-court decisions that is not contained in the statute
itself, and that Congress surely did not intend. And it
would wrongly require the federal courts, including this
Court, to defer to state judges' interpretations of federal law.

As the Fourth Circuit would have it, a state-court judgment is "unreasonable" in the face of federal law only if all
reasonable jurists would agree that the state court was unreasonable. Thus, in this case, for example, even if the Virginia Supreme Court misread our opinion in Lockhart, we
could not grant relief unless we believed that none of the
judges who agreed with the state court's interpretation of
that case was a "reasonable jurist." But the statute says

clearly established federal law. Brief for Respondent 14-15. The first,
"contrary to" exception, in his view, applies only to "starkly unreasonable"
errors of law. The first category thus imposes "a standard of review far
more limited than `de novo,' `independent' or `plenary' review." Id., at
24. The state-court judgment must thus be so far afield "as to make the
`unlawfulness' of the state court decision `apparent.' " Id., at 25. The
second exception likewise replaces the "de novo" standard of reviewing
mixed questions of law and fact with the standard of "objective reasonableness" as formulated by the Court of Appeals. Id., at 30-31.

9 Although we explain our understanding of "clearly established law,"

infra, at 379-384, we note that the Fourth Circuit's construction of the
amendment's inquiry in this respect is especially problematic. It separates cases into those for which a "controlling decision" exists and those
for which no such decision exists. The former category includes very few
cases, since a rule is "controlling" only if it matches the case before the
court both "as to law and fact," and most cases are factually distinguishable in some respect. A literal application of the Fourth Circuit test
would yield a particularly perverse outcome in cases involving the Strickland rule for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel, since that case,
which established the "controlling" rule of law on the issue, contained
facts insufficient to show ineffectiveness.

nothing about "reasonable judges," presumably because all,or virtually all, such judges occasionally commit error; they

make decisions that in retrospect may be characterized as"unreasonable." Indeed, it is most unlikely that Congress
would deliberately impose such a requirement of unanimityon federal judges. As Congress is acutely aware, reasonable
lawyers and lawgivers regularly disagree with one another.Congress surely did not intend that the views of one such
judge who might think that relief is not warranted in aparticular case should always have greater weight than the
contrary, considered judgment of several other reasonablejudges.

The inquiry mandated by the amendment relates to theway in which a federal habeas court exercises its duty to
decide constitutional questions; the amendment does notalter the underlying grant of jurisdiction in $ 2254(a), see
n. 7, supra.10 When federal judges exercise their federal-question jurisdiction under the "judicial Power" of Article
III of the Constitution, it is "emphatically the province andduty" of those judges to "say what the law is." Marbury v.
Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803). At the core of this

10 Indeed, Congress roundly rejected an amendment to the bill eventually adopted that directly invoked the text of the jurisdictional grant, 28
U. S. C. $ 2254(a) (providing that the federal courts "shall entertain an
application for a writ of habeas corpus" (emphasis added)). The amendment read: "Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an application for
a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a person in custody pursuant to a
judgment or order of a State court shall not be entertained by a court of
the United States unless the remedies in the courts of the State are inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of the person's detention." 141
Cong. Rec. 14991 (1995) (amendment of Sen. Kyl) (emphasis added). In
speaking against the Kyl amendment, Senator Specter (a key proponent
of the eventual habeas reform) explained that when "dealing with the
question of jurisdiction of the Federal courts to entertain questions on
Federal issues, on constitutional issues, I believe it is necessary that the
Federal courts retain that jurisdiction as a constitutional matter." Id.,
at 15050.

Opinion of Stevens, J.
power is the federal courts' independent responsibility--independent from its coequal branches in the Federal Government, and independent from the separate authority of the
several States--to interpret federal law. A construction of
AEDPA that would require the federal courts to cede this
authority to the courts of the States would be inconsistent
with the practice that federal judges have traditionally followed in discharging their duties under Article III of the
Constitution. If Congress had intended to require such an
important change in the exercise of our jurisdiction, we believe it would have spoken with much greater clarity than is
found in the text of AEDPA.

This basic premise informs our interpretation of both parts
of $ 2254(d)(1): first, the requirement that the determinations
of state courts be tested only against "clearly established
Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the
United States," and second, the prohibition on the issuance
of the writ unless the state court's decision is "contrary to,
or involved an unreasonable application of," that clearly established law. We address each part in turn.

The "clearly established law" requirement

In Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989), we held that the
petitioner was not entitled to federal habeas relief because
he was relying on a rule of federal law that had not been
announced until after his state conviction became final. The
antiretroactivity rule recognized in Teague, which prohibits
reliance on "new rules," is the functional equivalent of a statutory provision commanding exclusive reliance on "clearly
established law." Because there is no reason to believe that
Congress intended to require federal courts to ask both
whether a rule sought on habeas is "new" under Teague--
which remains the law--and also whether it is "clearly established" under AEDPA, it seems safe to assume that Congress

380 WILLIAMS v. TAYLOR

Opinion of Stevens, J.
had congruent concepts in mind.11 It is perfectly clear that
AEDPA codifies Teague to the extent that Teague requires
federal habeas courts to deny relief that is contingent upon
a rule of law not clearly established at the time the state
conviction became final.12

Teague's core principles are therefore relevant to our construction of this requirement. Justice Harlan recognized

11 It is not unusual for Congress to codify earlier precedent in the habeas
context. Thus, for example, the exhaustion rule applied in Ex parte
Hawk, 321 U. S. 114 (1944) (per curiam), and the abuse of the writ doctrine applied in Sanders v. United States, 373 U. S. 1 (1963), were later
codified. See 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(b) (1994 ed., Supp. III) (exhaustion requirement); 28 U. S. C. $ 2254, Rule 9(b), Rules Governing $ 2254 Cases in
the United States District Courts. A previous version of $ 2254, as we
stated in Miller v. Fenton, 474 U. S. 104, 111 (1985), "was an almost verbatim codification of the standards delineated in Townsend v. Sain, 372 U. S.
293 (1963), for determining when a district court must hold an evidentiary
hearing before acting on a habeas petition."

12 We are not persuaded by the argument that because Congress used

the words "clearly established law" and not "new rule," it meant in this
section to codify an aspect of the doctrine of executive qualified immunity
rather than Teague's antiretroactivity bar. Brief for Respondent 28-29,
n. 19. The warden refers us specifically to $ 2244(b)(2)(A) and 28 U. S. C.

$ 2254(e)(2) (1994 ed., Supp. III), in which the statute does in so many
words employ the "new rule" language familiar to Teague and its progeny.
Congress thus knew precisely the words to use if it had wished to codify
Teague per se. That it did not use those words in $ 2254(d) is evidence,
the argument goes, that it had something else in mind entirely in amending that section. We think, quite the contrary, that the verbatim adoption
of the Teague language in these other sections bolsters our impression that
Congress had Teague--and not any unrelated area of our jurisprudence--
specifically in mind in amending the habeas statute. These provisions,
seen together, make it impossible to conclude that Congress was not fully
aware of, and interested in codifying into law, that aspect of this Court's
habeas doctrine. We will not assume that in a single subsection of an
amendment entirely devoted to the law of habeas corpus, Congress made
the anomalous choice of reaching into the doctrinally distinct law of qualified immunity for a single phrase that just so happens to be the conceptual
twin of a dominant principle in habeas law of which Congress was fully
aware.

the "inevitable difficulties" that come with "attempting `todetermine whether a particular decision has really announced a "new" rule at all or whether it has simply applieda well-established constitutional principle to govern a case
which is closely analogous to those which have been pre-viously considered in the prior case law.' " Mackey, 401
U. S., at 695 (quoting Desist v. United States, 394 U. S. 244,263 (1969)). But

Teague established some guidance for mak-ing this determination, explaining that a federal habeas

court operates within the bounds of comity and finality if itapplies a rule "dictated by precedent existing at the time
the defendant's conviction became final." 489 U. S., at 301(emphasis deleted). A rule that "breaks new ground or imposes a new obligation on the States or the Federal Govern-ment," ibid., falls outside this universe of federal law.

To this, AEDPA has added, immediately following the"clearly established law" requirement, a clause limiting the
area of relevant law to that "determined by the SupremeCourt of the United States." 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d)(1) (1994
ed., Supp. III). If this Court has not broken sufficient legalground to establish an asked-for constitutional principle, the
lower federal courts cannot themselves establish such a prin-ciple with clarity sufficient to satisfy the AEDPA bar. In
this respect, we agree with the Seventh Circuit that thisclause "extends the principle of

Teague by limiting the sourceof doctrine on which a federal court may rely in addressing

the application for a writ." Lindh v. Murphy, 96 F. 3d 856,869 (1996). As that court explained:

"This is a retrenchment from former practice, which al-lowed the United States courts of appeals to rely on
their own jurisprudence in addition to that of the Su-preme Court. The novelty in this portion of $ 2254(d)(1)
is not the `contrary to' part but the reference to `Federallaw, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United
States' (emphasis added). This extends the principle of
Teague [v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989),] by limiting the

Opinion of Stevens, J.
source of doctrine on which a federal court may relyin addressing the application for a writ. It does not,

however, purport to limit the federal courts' independ-ent interpretive authority with respect to federal questions." Ibid.
A rule that fails to satisfy the foregoing criteria is barred by
Teague from application on collateral review, and, similarly,is not available as a basis for relief in a habeas case to which

AEDPA applies.In the context of this case, we also note that, as our precedent interpreting Teague has demonstrated, rules of law maybe sufficiently clear for habeas purposes even when they are
expressed in terms of a generalized standard rather than asa bright-line rule. As

Justice Kennedy has explained:

"If the rule in question is one which of necessity re-quires a case-by-case examination of the evidence, then

we can tolerate a number of specific applications withoutsaying that those applications themselves create a new
rule. . . . Where the beginning point is a rule of thisgeneral application, a rule designed for the specific purpose of evaluating a myriad of factual contexts, it willbe the infrequent case that yields a result so novel that
it forges a new rule, one not dictated by precedent."
Wright v. West, 505 U. S. 277, 308-309 (1992) (opinionconcurring in judgment).

Moreover, the determination whether or not a rule is clearlyestablished at the time a state court renders its final judgment of conviction is a question as to which the "federalcourts must make an independent evaluation." Id., at 305
(O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment); accord, id., at 307(

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment).It has been urged, in contrast, that we should read

Teagueand its progeny to encompass a broader principle of deference requiring federal courts to "validat[e] `reasonable,good-faith interpretations' of the law" by state courts.

Brief for California et al. as Amici Curiae 6 (quoting Butlerv. McKellar, 494 U. S. 407, 414 (1990)). The position has

been bolstered with references to our statements elucidatingthe "new rule" inquiry as one turning on whether "reasonable jurists" would agree the rule was not clearly estab-lished. Sawyer v. Smith, 497 U. S. 227, 234 (1990). This
presumption of deference was in essence the position takenby three Members of this Court in

Wright, 505 U. S., at 290-291 (opinion of
Thomas, J.) ("[A] federal habeas court `mustdefer to the state court's decision rejecting the claim unless

that decision is patently unreasonable' ") (quoting Butler, 494U. S., at 422 (Brennan, J., dissenting)).

Teague, however, does not extend this far. The often re-peated language that

Teague endorses "reasonable, good-faith interpretations" by state courts is an explanation of

policy, not a statement of law. The Teague cases reflect thisCourt's view that habeas corpus is not to be used as a second
criminal trial, and federal courts are not to run roughshodover the considered findings and judgments of the state
courts that conducted the original trial and heard the initialappeals. On the contrary, we have long insisted that federal
habeas courts attend closely to those considered decisions,and give them full effect when their findings and judgments
are consistent with federal law. See Thompson v. Keohane,516 U. S. 99, 107-116 (1995). But as

Justice O'Connor ex-plained in Wright:

"[T]he duty of the federal court in evaluating whethera rule is `new' is not the same as deference; . . . Teague
does not direct federal courts to spend less time or ef-fort scrutinizing the existing federal law, on the ground
that they can assume the state courts interpreted itproperly. . . .

"[T]he maxim that federal courts should `give greatweight to the considered conclusions of a coequal state
judiciary' . . . does not mean that we have held in thepast that federal courts must presume the correctness

Opinion of Stevens, J.
of a state court's legal conclusions on habeas, or that astate court's incorrect legal determination has ever been

allowed to stand because it was reasonable. We havealways held that federal courts, even on habeas, have an
independent obligation to say what the law is." 505U. S., at 305 (opinion concurring in judgment).

We are convinced that in the phrase, "clearly establishedlaw," Congress did not intend to modify that independent
obligation.
The "contrary to, or an unreasonable application of,"
requirement

The message that Congress intended to convey by usingthe phrases "contrary to" and "unreasonable application of "

is not entirely clear. The prevailing view in the Circuits isthat the former phrase requires

de novo review of "pure"questions of law and the latter requires some sort of "reasonability" review of so-called mixed questions of law and fact.See, e. g., Neelley v. Nagle, 138 F. 3d 917 (CA11 1998); Drinkard v. Johnson, 97 F. 3d 751 (CA5 1996); Lindh v. Murphy,96 F. 3d 856 (CA7 1996) (en banc), rev'd on other grounds,
521 U. S. 320 (1997).We are not persuaded that the phrases define two mutually exclusive categories of questions. Most constitutionalquestions that arise in habeas corpus proceedings--and
therefore most "decisions" to be made--require the federaljudge to apply a rule of law to a set of facts, some of which
may be disputed and some undisputed. For example, an er-roneous conclusion that particular circumstances established
the voluntariness of a confession, or that there exists a con-flict of interest when one attorney represents multiple defendants, may well be described either as "contrary to" or asan "unreasonable application of " the governing rule of law.
Cf. Miller v. Fenton, 474 U. S. 104, 116 (1985); Cuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U. S. 335, 341-342 (1980). In constitutional adju-dication, as in the common law, rules of law often develop

Opinion of Stevens, J.
incrementally as earlier decisions are applied to new factualsituations. See

Wright, 505 U. S., at 307 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment). But rules that depend upon suchelaboration are hardly less lawlike than those that establish

a bright-line test.Indeed, our pre-AEDPA efforts to distinguish questions of
fact, questions of law, and "mixed questions," and to create
an appropriate standard of habeas review for each, generatedsome not insubstantial differences of opinion as to which issues of law fell into which category of question, and as towhich standard of review applied to each. See

Thompson,
516 U. S., at 110-111 (acknowledging " `that the Court has
not charted an entirely clear course in this area' " and that
"the proper characterization of a question as one of fact or
law is sometimes slippery") (quoting Miller, 474 U. S., at
113). We thus think the Fourth Circuit was correct when it
attributed the lack of clarity in the statute, in part, to the
overlapping meanings of the phrases "contrary to" and "unreasonable application of." See Green, 143 F. 3d, at 870.

The statutory text likewise does not obviously prescribe a
specific, recognizable standard of review for dealing with
either phrase. Significantly, it does not use any term, such
as "de novo" or "plain error," that would easily identify a
familiar standard of review. Rather, the text is fairly read
simply as a command that a federal court not issue the habeas writ unless the state court was wrong as a matter of
law or unreasonable in its application of law in a given case.
The suggestion that a wrong state-court "decision"--a legal
judgment rendered "after consideration of facts, and . . .
law," Black's Law Dictionary 407 (6th ed. 1990) (emphasis
added)--may no longer be redressed through habeas (because it is unreachable under the "unreasonable application"
phrase) is based on a mistaken insistence that the $ 2254(d)(1)
phrases have not only independent, but mutually exclusive,
meanings. Whether or not a federal court can issue the writ
"under [the] `unreasonable application' clause," the statute is

529US2 Unit: $U46 [10-07-01 17:18:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN
386 WILLIAMS v. TAYLOR

Opinion of Stevens, J.
clear that habeas may issue under $ 2254(d)(1) if a state-court"decision" is "contrary to . . . clearly established Federal

law." We thus anticipate that there will be a variety ofcases, like this one, in which both phrases may be implicated.

Even though we cannot conclude that the phrases establish"a body of rigid rules," they do express a "mood" that the
Federal Judiciary must respect. Universal Camera Corp. v.
NLRB, 340 U. S. 474, 487 (1951). In this respect, it seemsclear that Congress intended federal judges to attend with

the utmost care to state-court decisions, including all of thereasons supporting their decisions, before concluding that
those proceedings were infected by constitutional error sufficiently serious to warrant the issuance of the writ. Likewise, the statute in a separate provision provides for the
habeas remedy when a state-court decision "was based on an
unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding." 28 U. S. C.

$ 2254(d)(2) (1994 ed., Supp. III) (emphasis added). While
this provision is not before us in this case, it provides relevant context for our interpretation of $ 2254(d)(1); in this respect, it bolsters our conviction that federal habeas courts
must make as the starting point of their analysis the state
courts' determinations of fact, including that aspect of a
"mixed question" that rests on a finding of fact. AEDPA
plainly sought to ensure a level of "deference to the determinations of state courts," provided those determinations did
not conflict with federal law or apply federal law in an unreasonable way. H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-518, p. 111 (1996).
Congress wished to curb delays, to prevent "retrials" on federal habeas, and to give effect to state convictions to the
extent possible under law. When federal courts are able to
fulfill these goals within the bounds of the law, AEDPA instructs them to do so.

On the other hand, it is significant that the word "deference" does not appear in the text of the statute itself. Neither the legislative history nor the statutory text suggests

387Cite as: 529 U. S. 362 (2000)
Opinion of Stevens, J.
any difference in the so-called "deference" depending onwhich of the two phrases is implicated.

13 Whatever "deference" Congress had in mind with respect to both phrases, itsurely is not a requirement that federal courts actually defer

to a state-court application of the federal law that is, in theindependent judgment of the federal court, in error. As
Judge Easterbrook noted with respect to the phrase "con-trary to":

"Section 2254(d) requires us to give state courts' opin-ions a respectful reading, and to listen carefully to their
conclusions, but when the state court addresses a legalquestion, it is the law `as determined by the Supreme
Court of the United States' that prevails." Lindh, 96F. 3d, at 869.

14

13 As Judge Easterbrook has noted, the statute surely does not require
the kind of "deference" appropriate in other contexts: "It does not tell us
to `defer' to state decisions, as if the Constitution means one thing in
Wisconsin and another in Indiana. Nor does it tell us to treat state courts
the way we treat federal administrative agencies. Deference after the
fashion of Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council,
Inc., 467 U. S. 837 . . . (1984), depends on delegation. See Adams Fruit
Co. v. Barrett, 494 U. S. 638 . . . (1990). Congress did not delegate either
interpretive or executive power to the state courts. They exercise powers under their domestic law, constrained by the Constitution of the United
States. `Deference' to the jurisdictions bound by those constraints is not
sensible." Lindh v. Murphy, 96 F. 3d 856, 868 (CA7 1996) (en banc), rev'd
on other grounds, 521 U. S. 320 (1997).

14 The Court advances three reasons for adopting its alternative construction of the phrase "unreasonable application of." First, the use of
the word "unreasonable" in the statute suggests that Congress was directly influenced by the "patently unreasonable" standard advocated by
Justice Thomas in his opinion in Wright v. West, 505 U. S. 277, 287 (1992),
post, at 411-412; second, the legislative history supports this view, see
post, at 408, n.; and third, Congress must have intended to change the law
more substantially than our reading of 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d)(1) (1994 ed.,
Supp. III) permits.

None of these reasons is persuasive. First, even though, as the Court
recognizes, the term "unreasonable" is "difficult to define," post, at 410,
neither the statute itself nor the Court's explanation of it suggests that

388 WILLIAMS v. TAYLOR

Opinion of Stevens, J.
Our disagreement with the Court about the precisemeaning of the phrase "contrary to," and the word "unreasonable," is, of course, important, but should affect only anarrow category of cases. The simplest and first definition
of "contrary to" as a phrase is "in conflict with." Webster's
AEDPA's "unreasonable application of" has the same meaning as Justice
Thomas' " `patently unreasonable' " standard mentioned in his dictum in
Wright. 505 U. S., at 291 (quoting Butler v. McKellar, 494 U. S. 407, 422
(1990) (Brennan, J., dissenting)). To the extent the "broader debate" in
Wright touched upon the Court's novel distinction today between what is
"wrong" and what is "unreasonable," it was in the context of a discussion
not about the standard of review habeas courts should use for lawapplication questions, but about whether a rule is "new" or "old" such
that Teague's retroactivity rule would bar habeas relief; Justice Thomas
contended that Teague barred habeas "whenever the state courts have
interpreted old precedents reasonably, not [as Justice O'Connor suggested] only when they have done so `properly.' " 505 U. S., at 291-292,
n. 8. Teague, of course, as Justice O'Connor correctly pointed out, "did
not establish a standard of review at all," 505 U. S., at 303-304; rather
than instructing a court how to review a claim, it simply asks, in absolute
terms, whether a rule was clear at the time of a state-court decision. We
thus do not think Wright "confirms" anything about the meaning of

$ 2254(d)(1), which is, as our division reflects, anything but "clear." Post,
at 412.

As for the other bases for the Court's view, the only two specific citations to the legislative history upon which it relies, post, at 408, do no
more than beg the question. One merely quotes the language of the statute without elaboration, and the other goes to slightly greater length in
stating that state-court judgments must be upheld unless "unreasonable."
Neither sheds any light on what the content of the hypothetical category
of "decisions" that are wrong but nevertheless not "unreasonable." Finally, while we certainly agree with the Court, post, at 403, that AEDPA
wrought substantial changes in habeas law, see supra, at 386; see also,
e. g., 28 U. S. C. $ 2244(b) (1994 ed., Supp. III) (strictly limiting second or
successive petitions); $ 2244(d) (1-year statute of limitations for habeas
petitions); $ 2254(e)(2) (limiting availability of evidentiary hearings on
habeas); $$ 2263, 2266 (strict deadlines for habeas court rulings), there is
an obvious fallacy in the assumption that because the statute changed
pre-existing law in some respects, it must have rendered this specific
change here.

Opinion of Stevens, J.
Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 285 (1983). In this sense,
we think the phrase surely capacious enough to include a
finding that the state-court "decision" is simply "erroneous"
or wrong. (We hasten to add that even "diametrically different" from, or "opposite" to, an established federal law
would seem to include "decisions" that are wrong in light of
that law.) And there is nothing in the phrase "contrary
to"--as the Court appears to agree--that implies anything
less than independent review by the federal courts. Moreover, state-court decisions that do not "conflict" with federal
law will rarely be "unreasonable" under either the Court's
reading of the statute or ours. We all agree that state-court
judgments must be upheld unless, after the closest examination of the state-court judgment, a federal court is firmly
convinced that a federal constitutional right has been violated. Our difference is as to the cases in which, at first
blush, a state-court judgment seems entirely reasonable, but
thorough analysis by a federal court produces a firm conviction that that judgment is infected by constitutional error.
In our view, such an erroneous judgment is "unreasonable"
within the meaning of the Act even though that conclusion
was not immediately apparent.

In sum, the statute directs federal courts to attend to
every state-court judgment with utmost care, but it does not
require them to defer to the opinion of every reasonable
state-court judge on the content of federal law. If, after
carefully weighing all the reasons for accepting a state
court's judgment, a federal court is convinced that a prisoner's custody--or, as in this case, his sentence of death--violates the Constitution, that independent judgment should
prevail. Otherwise the federal "law as determined by the
Supreme Court of the United States" might be applied by
the federal courts one way in Virginia and another way in
California. In light of the well-recognized interest in ensuring that federal courts interpret federal law in a uniform

Opinion of the Court
way,15 we are convinced that Congress did not intend thestatute to produce such a result.

III
In this case, Williams contends that he was denied his con-stitutionally guaranteed right to the effective assistance of

counsel when his trial lawyers failed to investigate and topresent substantial mitigating evidence to the sentencing
jury. The threshold question under AEDPA is whether Wil-liams seeks to apply a rule of law that was clearly established
at the time his state-court conviction became final. Thatquestion is easily answered because the merits of his claim
are squarely governed by our holding in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984).We explained in Strickland that a violation of the right on

which Williams relies has two components:

"First, the defendant must show that counsel's perform-ance was deficient. This requires showing that counsel

made errors so serious that counsel was not functioningas the `counsel' guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth
Amendment. Second, the defendant must show thatthe deficient performance prejudiced the defense. This
requires showing that counsel's errors were so seriousas to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose
result is reliable." Id., at 687.
To establish ineffectiveness, a "defendant must show thatcounsel's representation fell below an objective standard of

15 See, e. g., Mackey v. United States, 401 U. S. 667, 689 (1971); Felker v.
Turpin, 518 U. S. 651, 667 (1996) (Souter, J., concurring). Indeed, a contrary rule would be in substantial tension with the interest in uniformity
served by Congress' modification in AEDPA of our previous Teague jurisprudence--now the law on habeas review must be "clearly established" by
this Court alone. See supra, at 381-382. It would thus seem somewhat
perverse to ascribe to Congress the entirely inconsistent policy of perpetuating disparate readings of our decisions under the guise of deference to
anything within a conceivable spectrum of reasonableness.

Opinion of the Court
reasonableness." Id., at 688. To establish prejudice he"must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but

for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceed-ing would have been different. A reasonable probability is
a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the out-come." Id., at 694.

It is past question that the rule set forth in Stricklandqualifies as "clearly established Federal law, as determined
by the Supreme Court of the United States." That the
Strickland test "of necessity requires a case-by-case exami-nation of the evidence," Wright, 505 U. S., at 308 (

Kennedy,J., concurring in judgment), obviates neither the clarity of

the rule nor the extent to which the rule must be seen as"established" by this Court. This Court's precedent "dictated" that the Virginia Supreme Court apply the Stricklandtest at the time that court entertained Williams' ineffectiveassistance claim. Teague, 489 U. S., at 301. And it canhardly be said that recognizing the right to effective counsel
"breaks new ground or imposes a new obligation on theStates," ibid. Williams is therefore entitled to relief if the
Virginia Supreme Court's decision rejecting his ineffective-assistance claim was either "contrary to, or involved an
unreasonable application of," that established law. It wasboth.

IV
The Virginia Supreme Court erred in holding that our de-cision in

Lockhart v. Fretwell, 506 U. S. 364 (1993), modifiedor in some way supplanted the rule set down in Strickland.

It is true that while the Strickland test provides sufficientguidance for resolving virtually all ineffective-assistance-ofcounsel claims, there are situations in which the overridingfocus on fundamental fairness may affect the analysis.
Thus, on the one hand, as Strickland itself explained, thereare a few situations in which prejudice may be presumed.
466 U. S., at 692. And, on the other hand, there are alsosituations in which it would be unjust to characterize the

392 WILLIAMS v. TAYLOR

Opinion of the Court
likelihood of a different outcome as legitimate "prejudice."Even if a defendant's false testimony might have persuaded

the jury to acquit him, it is not fundamentally unfair to con-clude that he was not prejudiced by counsel's interference
with his intended perjury. Nix v. Whiteside, 475 U. S. 157,175-176 (1986).

Similarly, in Lockhart, we concluded that, given the over-riding interest in fundamental fairness, the likelihood of a
different outcome attributable to an incorrect interpretationof the law should be regarded as a potential "windfall" to the
defendant rather than the legitimate "prejudice" contemplated by our opinion in Strickland. The death sentencethat Arkansas had imposed on Bobby Ray Fretwell was

based on an aggravating circumstance (murder committedfor pecuniary gain) that duplicated an element of the underlying felony (murder in the course of a robbery). Shortlybefore the trial, the United States Court of Appeals for the
Eighth Circuit had held that such "double counting" was im-permissible, see

Collins v. Lockhart, 754 F. 2d 258, 265
(1985), but Fretwell's lawyer (presumably because he was
unaware of the Collins decision) failed to object to the useof the pecuniary gain aggravator. Before Fretwell's claim

for federal habeas corpus relief reached this Court, the Collins case was overruled.16 Accordingly, even though the Arkansas trial judge probably would have sustained a timelyobjection to the double counting, it had become clear that

the State had a right to rely on the disputed aggravat-ing circumstance. Because the ineffectiveness of Fretwell's
counsel had not deprived him of any substantive or proce-dural right to which the law entitled him, we held that his

16 In Lowenfield v. Phelps, 484 U. S. 231 (1988), we held that an aggravating circumstance may duplicate an element of the capital offense if the
class of death-eligible defendants is sufficiently narrowed by the definition
of the offense itself. In Perry v. Lockhart, 871 F. 2d 1384 (1989), the
Eighth Circuit correctly decided that our decision in Lowenfield required
it to overrule Collins.

Opinion of the Court
claim did not satisfy the "prejudice" component of the Strickland test.17

Cases such as Nix v. Whiteside, 475 U. S. 157 (1986), and
Lockhart v. Fretwell, 506 U. S. 364 (1993), do not justify a
departure from a straightforward application of Strickland
when the ineffectiveness of counsel does deprive the defendant of a substantive or procedural right to which the law
entitles him.18 In the instant case, it is undisputed that
Williams had a right--indeed, a constitutionally protected
right--to provide the jury with the mitigating evidence that
his trial counsel either failed to discover or failed to offer.

Nevertheless, the Virginia Supreme Court read our decision in Lockhart to require a separate inquiry into fundamental fairness even when Williams is able to show that his lawyer was ineffective and that his ineffectiveness probably
affected the outcome of the proceeding. It wrote:

17 "But the `prejudice' component of the Strickland test does not implicate these concerns. It focuses on the question whether counsel's deficient performance renders the result of the trial unreliable or the proceeding fundamentally unfair. [466 U. S., at 687]; see Kimmelman, 477 U. S.,
at 393 (Powell, J., concurring). Unreliability or unfairness does not result
if the ineffectiveness of counsel does not deprive the defendant of any
substantive or procedural right to which the law entitles him. As we
have noted, it was the premise of our grant in this case that Perry was
correctly decided, i. e., that respondent was not entitled to an objection
based on `double counting.' Respondent therefore suffered no prejudice
from his counsel's deficient performance." Lockhart v. Fretwell, 506 U. S.
364, 372 (1993).

18 In her concurring opinion in Lockhart, Justice O'Connor stressed

this precise point. "I write separately only to point out that today's decision will, in the vast majority of cases, have no effect on the prejudice
inquiry under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984). The determinative question--whether there is `a reasonable probability that, but for
counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have
been different,' id., at 694--remains unchanged. This case, however, concerns the unusual circumstance where the defendant attempts to demonstrate prejudice based on considerations that, as a matter of law, ought
not inform the inquiry." Id., at 373.

394 WILLIAMS v. TAYLOR

Opinion of the Court
" `The prisoner argues there `is a "reasonable probabil-ity" that at least one juror would have been moved to

spare Petitioner's life had he heard' the mitigation evi-dence developed at the habeas hearing that was not presented at the trial. Summarizing, he contends there `isa "reasonable probability" that had at least one juror
heard any of this evidence--let alone all of this evidence--the outcome of this case would have beendifferent.'

"We reject these contentions. The prisoner's discus-sion flies in the face of the Supreme Court's admonition
in Lockhart, supra, that `an analysis focusing solely onmere outcome determination, without attention to
whether the result of the proceeding was fundamentallyunfair or unreliable, is defective.' " 254 Va., at 25, 487
S. E. 2d, at 199.
Unlike the Virginia Supreme Court, the state trial judge
omitted any reference to Lockhart and simply relied on ouropinion in

Strickland as stating the correct standard for
judging ineffective-assistance claims. With respect to the
prejudice component, he wrote:

"Even if a Petitioner shows that counsel's performance was deficient, however, he must also show prejudice. Petitioner must show `that there is a reasonable
probability that but for counsel's unprofessional errors,
the result . . . would have been different.' Strickland,
466 U. S. at 694. `A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.'
Id. Indeed, it is insufficient to show only that the errors had some conceivable effect on the outcome of the
proceeding, because virtually every act or omission of
counsel would meet that test. Id. at 693. The petitioner bears the `highly demanding' and `heavy burden'
in establishing actual prejudice." App. 417.

Opinion of the Court
The trial judge analyzed the ineffective-assistance claimunder the correct standard; the Virginia Supreme Court

did not.We are likewise persuaded that the Virginia trial judge
correctly applied both components of that standard to Wil-liams' ineffectiveness claim. Although he concluded that
counsel competently handled the guilt phase of the trial, hefound that their representation during the sentencing phase
fell short of professional standards--a judgment barely dis-puted by the State in its brief to this Court. The record
establishes that counsel did not begin to prepare for thatphase of the proceeding until a week before the trial.

Id.,at 207, 227. They failed to conduct an investigation that

would have uncovered extensive records graphically describ-ing Williams' nightmarish childhood, not because of any strategic calculation but because they incorrectly thought thatstate law barred access to such records. Had they done so,
the jury would have learned that Williams' parents had beenimprisoned for the criminal neglect of Williams and his siblings,19 that Williams had been severely and repeatedlybeaten by his father, that he had been committed to the custody of the social services bureau for two years during hisparents' incarceration (including one stint in an abusive foster home), and then, after his parents were released fromprison, had been returned to his parents' custody.

19 Juvenile records contained the following description of his home:
"The home was a complete wreck. . . . There were several places on the
floor where someone had had a bowel movement. Urine was standing in
several places in the bedrooms. There were dirty dishes scattered over
the kitchen, and it was impossible to step any place on the kitchen floor
where there was no trash. . . . The children were all dirty and none of
them had on under-pants. Noah and Lula were so intoxicated, they could
not find any clothes for the children, nor were they able to put the clothes
on them. . . . The children had to be put in Winslow Hospital, as four
of them, by that time, were definitely under the influence of whiskey."

396 WILLIAMS v. TAYLOR

Opinion of the Court
Counsel failed to introduce available evidence that Wil-liams was "borderline mentally retarded" and did not advance beyond sixth grade in school. Id., at 595. Theyfailed to seek prison records recording Williams' commendations for helping to crack a prison drug ring and for return-ing a guard's missing wallet, or the testimony of prison officials who described Williams as among the inmates "least
likely to act in a violent, dangerous or provocative way."
Id., at 569, 588. Counsel failed even to return the phone call
of a certified public accountant who had offered to testifythat he had visited Williams frequently when Williams was

incarcerated as part of a prison ministry program, that Williams "seemed to thrive in a more regimented and structured
environment," and that Williams was proud of the carpentry
degree he earned while in prison. Id., at 563-566.

Of course, not all of the additional evidence was favorable
to Williams. The juvenile records revealed that he had been
thrice committed to the juvenile system--for aiding and
abetting larceny when he was 11 years old, for pulling a false
fire alarm when he was 12, and for breaking and entering
when he was 15. Id., at 534-536. But as the Federal District Court correctly observed, the failure to introduce the
comparatively voluminous amount of evidence that did speak
in Williams' favor was not justified by a tactical decision to
focus on Williams' voluntary confession. Whether or not
those omissions were sufficiently prejudicial to have affected
the outcome of sentencing, they clearly demonstrate that
trial counsel did not fulfill their obligation to conduct a thorough investigation of the defendant's background. See 1
ABA Standards for Criminal Justice 4-4.1, commentary,
p. 4-55 (2d ed. 1980).

We are also persuaded, unlike the Virginia Supreme Court,
that counsel's unprofessional service prejudiced Williams
within the meaning of Strickland. After hearing the additional evidence developed in the postconviction proceedings,
the very judge who presided at Williams' trial, and who once

529US2 Unit: $U46 [10-07-01 17:18:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN

397Cite as: 529 U. S. 362 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
determined that the death penalty was "just" and "appro-priate," concluded that there existed "a reasonable probability that the result of the sentencing phase would have beendifferent" if the jury had heard that evidence. App. 429.
We do not agree with the Virginia Supreme Court that JudgeIngram's conclusion should be discounted because he apparently adopted "a per se approach to the prejudice element"
that placed undue "emphasis on mere outcome determina-tion." 254 Va., at 26-27, 487 S. E. 2d, at 200. Judge Ingram

did stress the importance of mitigation evidence in makinghis "outcome determination," but it is clear that his predictive judgment rested on his assessment of the totality of the
omitted evidence rather than on the notion that a single item
of omitted evidence, no matter how trivial, would require a
new hearing.

The Virginia Supreme Court's own analysis of prejudice
reaching the contrary conclusion was thus unreasonable in
at least two respects. First, as we have already explained,
the State Supreme Court mischaracterized at best the appropriate rule, made clear by this Court in Strickland, for determining whether counsel's assistance was effective within
the meaning of the Constitution. While it may also have
conducted an "outcome determinative" analysis of its own,
254 Va., at 27, 487 S. E. 2d, at 200, it is evident to us that the
court's decision turned on its erroneous view that a "mere"
difference in outcome is not sufficient to establish constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel. See supra, at 394.
Its analysis in this respect was thus not only "contrary to,"
but also, inasmuch as the Virginia Supreme Court relied on
the inapplicable exception recognized in Lockhart, an "unreasonable application of " the clear law as established by
this Court.

Second, the State Supreme Court's prejudice determination was unreasonable insofar as it failed to evaluate the
totality of the available mitigation evidence--both that
adduced at trial, and the evidence adduced in the habeas pro529US2 Unit: $U46 [10-07-01 17:18:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of Stevens, J.
ceeding--in reweighing it against the evidence in aggrava-tion. See Clemons v. Mississippi, 494 U. S. 738, 751-752

(1990). This error is apparent in its consideration of the ad-ditional mitigation evidence developed in the postconviction
proceedings. The court correctly found that as to "thefactual part of the mixed question," there was "really . . .
n[o] . . . dispute" that available mitigation evidence was notpresented at trial. 254 Va., at 24, 487 S. E. 2d, at 198. As
to the prejudice determination comprising the "legal part" ofits analysis,

id., at 23-25, 487 S. E. 2d, at 198-199, it correctlyemphasized the strength of the prosecution evidence supporting the future dangerousness aggravating circumstance.But the state court failed even to mention the sole argument in mitigation that trial counsel did advance--Williamsturned himself in, alerting police to a crime they otherwise
would never have discovered, expressing remorse for his ac-tions, and cooperating with the police after that. While
this, coupled with the prison records and guard testimony,may not have overcome a finding of future dangerousness,
the graphic description of Williams' childhood, filled withabuse and privation, or the reality that he was "borderline
mentally retarded," might well have influenced the jury's ap-praisal of his moral culpability. See

Boyde v. California,494 U. S. 370, 387 (1990). The circumstances recited in his

several confessions are consistent with the view that in eachcase his violent behavior was a compulsive reaction rather
than the product of cold-blooded premeditation. Mitigatingevidence unrelated to dangerousness may alter the jury's selection of penalty, even if it does not undermine or rebut theprosecution's death-eligibility case. The Virginia Supreme
Court did not entertain that possibility. It thus failed toaccord appropriate weight to the body of mitigation evidence
available to trial counsel. V

In our judgment, the state trial judge was correct both inhis recognition of the established legal standard for deter529US2 Unit: $U46 [10-07-01 17:18:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
mining counsel's effectiveness, and in his conclusion that theentire postconviction record, viewed as a whole and cumulative of mitigation evidence presented originally, raised "areasonable probability that the result of the sentencing proceeding would have been different" if competent counsel hadpresented and explained the significance of all the available
evidence. It follows that the Virginia Supreme Courtrendered a "decision that was contrary to, or involved an
unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law."Williams' constitutional right to the effective assistance of
counsel as defined in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668(1984), was violated.

Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is re-versed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.

It is so ordered.
Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Courtwith respect to Part II (except as to the footnote), concurred
in part, and concurred in the judgment.*

In 1996, Congress enacted the Antiterrorism and EffectiveDeath Penalty Act (AEDPA). In that Act, Congress placed

a new restriction on the power of federal courts to grantwrits of habeas corpus to state prisoners. The relevant provision, 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d)(1) (1994 ed., Supp. III), prohibitsa federal court from granting an application for a writ of
habeas corpus with respect to a claim adjudicated on themerits in state court unless that adjudication "resulted in a
decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonableapplication of, clearly established Federal law, as determined
by the Supreme Court of the United States." The Courtholds today that the Virginia Supreme Court's adjudication

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
of Terry Williams' application for state habeas corpus reliefresulted in just such a decision. I agree with that determination and join Parts I, III, and IV of the Court's opinion.Because I disagree, however, with the interpretation of

$ 2254(d)(1) set forth in Part II of Justice Stevens' opinion,I write separately to explain my views.

I
Before 1996, this Court held that a federal court entertain-ing a state prisoner's application for habeas relief must exercise its independent judgment when deciding both questionsof constitutional law and mixed constitutional questions (

i. e.,application of constitutional law to fact). See, e. g., Miller v.

Fenton, 474 U. S. 104, 112 (1985). In other words, a federalhabeas court owed no deference to a state court's resolution
of such questions of law or mixed questions. In 1991, in thecase of Wright v. West, 502 U. S. 1021, we revisited our prior
holdings by asking the parties to address the following ques-tion in their briefs:

"In determining whether to grant a petition for writ ofhabeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the
judgment of a state court, should a federal court givedeference to the state court's application of law to the
specific facts of the petitioner's case or should it reviewthe state court's determination de novo?" Ibid.

Although our ultimate decision did not turn on the answerto that question, our several opinions did join issue on it.
See Wright v. West, 505 U. S. 277 (1992).

Justice Thomas, announcing the judgment of the Court,acknowledged that our precedents had "treat[ed] as settled

the rule that mixed constitutional questions are `subject toplenary federal review' on habeas."

Id., at 289 (quotingMiller, supra, at 112). He contended, nevertheless, that

those decisions did not foreclose the Court from applying arule of deferential review for reasonableness in future cases.

529US2 Unit: $U46 [10-07-01 17:18:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN

401Cite as: 529 U. S. 362 (2000)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
See 505 U. S., at 287-290. According to Justice Thomas,the reliance of our precedents on

Brown v. Allen, 344 U. S.
443 (1953), was erroneous because the Court in Brown neverexplored in detail whether a federal habeas court, to deny a

state prisoner's application, must conclude that the relevantstate-court adjudication was "correct" or merely that it was
"reasonable." Wright, supra, at 287. Justice Thomas
suggested that the time to revisit our decisions may havebeen at hand, given that our more recent habeas jurisprudence in the nonretroactivity context, see, e. g., Teague v.
Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989), had called into question the thensettled rule of independent review of mixed constitutional
questions. Wright, 505 U. S., at 291-292, 294.

I wrote separately in Wright because I believed Justice
Thomas had "understate[d] the certainty with which Brown
v. Allen rejected a deferential standard of review of issues
of law." Id., at 300. I also explained that we had considered the standard of review applicable to mixed constitutional questions on numerous occasions and each time we
concluded that federal habeas courts had a duty to evaluate
such questions independently. Id., at 301-303. With respect to Justice Thomas' suggestion that Teague and its
progeny called into question the vitality of the independentreview rule, I noted that "Teague did not establish a `deferential' standard of review" because "[i]t did not establish a
standard of review at all." 505 U. S., at 303-304. While
Teague did hold that state prisoners could not receive "the
retroactive benefit of new rules of law," it "did not create
any deferential standard of review with regard to old rules."
505 U. S., at 304 (emphasis in original).

Finally, and perhaps most importantly for purposes of today's case, I stated my disagreement with Justice Thomas'
suggestion that de novo review is incompatible with the
maxim that federal habeas courts should "give great weight
to the considered conclusions of a coequal state judiciary,"
Miller, supra, at 112. Our statement in Miller signified

402 WILLIAMS v. TAYLOR

Opinion of the Court
only that a state-court decision is due the same respect asany other "persuasive, well-reasoned authority."

Wright,
505 U. S., at 305. "But this does not mean that we have heldin the past that federal courts must presume the correctness

of a state court's legal conclusions on habeas, or that a statecourt's incorrect legal determination has ever been allowed
to stand because it was reasonable. We have always held
that federal courts, even on habeas, have an independent ob-ligation to say what the law is."

Ibid. Under the federal
habeas statute as it stood in 1992, then, our precedents dic-tated that a federal court should grant a state prisoner's petition for habeas relief if that court were to conclude in itsindependent judgment that the relevant state court had
erred on a question of constitutional law or on a mixed con-stitutional question.

If today's case were governed by the federal habeas stat-ute prior to Congress' enactment of AEDPA in 1996, I would
agree with Justice Stevens that Williams' petition for ha-beas relief must be granted if we, in our independent judgment, were to conclude that his Sixth Amendment right to
effective assistance of counsel was violated. See ante, at 389.

II

A

Williams' case is not governed by the pre-1996 version of
the habeas statute. Because he filed his petition in De-cember 1997, Williams' case is governed by the statute as

amended by AEDPA. Section 2254 now provides:

"(d) An application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment ofa State court shall not be granted with respect to any

claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court
proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim--

"(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or
involved an unreasonable application of, clearly estab529US2 Unit: $U46 [10-07-01 17:18:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
lished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Courtof the United States."

Accordingly, for Williams to obtain federal habeas relief, hemust first demonstrate that his case satisfies the condition
set by $ 2254(d)(1). That provision modifies the role offederal habeas courts in reviewing petitions filed by state
prisoners.

Justice Stevens' opinion in Part II essentially contendsthat $ 2254(d)(1) does not alter the previously settled rule

of independent review. Indeed, the opinion concludes itsstatutory inquiry with the somewhat empty finding that

$ 2254(d)(1) does no more than express a " `mood' that theFederal Judiciary must respect." Ante, at 386. For

Jus-
tice Stevens, the congressionally enacted "mood" has twoimportant qualities. First, "federal courts [must] attend to

every state-court judgment with utmost care" by "carefullyweighing all the reasons for accepting a state court's judgment." Ante, at 389. Second, if a federal court undertakesthat careful review and yet remains convinced that a prisoner's custody violates the Constitution, "that independentjudgment should prevail." Ibid.

One need look no further than our decision in Miller tosee that

Justice Stevens' interpretation of $ 2254(d)(1)gives the 1996 amendment no effect whatsoever. The command that federal courts should now use the "utmost care"by "carefully weighing" the reasons supporting a state
court's judgment echoes our pre-AEDPA statement inMiller that federal habeas courts "should, of course, give
great weight to the considered conclusions of a coequal statejudiciary." 474 U. S., at 112. Similarly, the requirement
that the independent judgment of a federal court must in theend prevail essentially repeats the conclusion we reached in
the very next sentence in Miller with respect to the specificissue presented there: "But, as we now reaffirm, the ultimate
question whether, under the totality of the circumstances,the challenged confession was obtained in a manner compat529US2 Unit: $U46 [10-07-01 17:18:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN
404 WILLIAMS v. TAYLOR

Opinion of the Court
ible with the requirements of the Constitution is a matter
for independent federal determination." Ibid. (emphasis
added).

That Justice Stevens would find the new $ 2254(d)(1) to
have no effect on the prior law of habeas corpus is remarkable given his apparent acknowledgment that Congress
wished to bring change to the field. See ante, at 386 ("Congress wished to curb delays, to prevent `retrials' on federal
habeas, and to give effect to state convictions to the extent
possible under law"). That acknowledgment is correct and
significant to this case. It cannot be disputed that Congress
viewed $ 2254(d)(1) as an important means by which its goals
for habeas reform would be achieved.

Justice Stevens arrives at his erroneous interpretation
by means of one critical misstep. He fails to give independent meaning to both the "contrary to" and "unreasonable application" clauses of the statute. See, e. g., ante, at 384 ("We
are not persuaded that the phrases define two mutually exclusive categories of questions"). By reading $ 2254(d)(1) as
one general restriction on the power of the federal habeas
court, Justice Stevens manages to avoid confronting the
specific meaning of the statute's "unreasonable application"
clause and its ramifications for the independent-review rule.
It is, however, a cardinal principle of statutory construction
that we must " `give effect, if possible, to every clause and
word of a statute.' " United States v. Menasche, 348 U. S.
528, 538-539 (1955) (quoting Montclair v. Ramsdell, 107 U. S.
147, 152 (1883)). Section 2254(d)(1) defines two categories
of cases in which a state prisoner may obtain federal habeas
relief with respect to a claim adjudicated on the merits in
state court. Under the statute, a federal court may grant a
writ of habeas corpus if the relevant state-court decision was
either (1) "contrary to . . . clearly established Federal law,
as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,"
or (2) "involved an unreasonable application of . . . clearly

Opinion of the Court
established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme
Court of the United States." (Emphases added.)

The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit properly accorded both the "contrary to" and "unreasonable application"
clauses independent meaning. The Fourth Circuit's interpretation of $ 2254(d)(1) in Williams' case relied, in turn, on
that court's previous decision in Green v. French, 143 F. 3d
865 (1998), cert. denied, 525 U. S. 1090 (1999). See 163 F. 3d
860, 866 (CA4 1998) ("[T]he standard of review enunciated in
Green v. French continues to be the binding law of this Circuit"). With respect to the first of the two statutory clauses,
the Fourth Circuit held in Green that a state-court decision
can be "contrary to" this Court's clearly established precedent in two ways. First, a state-court decision is contrary
to this Court's precedent if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by this Court on a question
of law. Second, a state-court decision is also contrary to this
Court's precedent if the state court confronts facts that are
materially indistinguishable from a relevant Supreme Court
precedent and arrives at a result opposite to ours. See 143
F. 3d, at 869-870.

The word "contrary" is commonly understood to mean "diametrically different," "opposite in character or nature," or
"mutually opposed." Webster's Third New International
Dictionary 495 (1976). The text of $ 2254(d)(1) therefore
suggests that the state court's decision must be substantially
different from the relevant precedent of this Court. The
Fourth Circuit's interpretation of the "contrary to" clause
accurately reflects this textual meaning. A state-court decision will certainly be contrary to our clearly established
precedent if the state court applies a rule that contradicts
the governing law set forth in our cases. Take, for example,
our decision in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668
(1984). If a state court were to reject a prisoner's claim
of ineffective assistance of counsel on the grounds that the

529US2 Unit: $U46 [10-07-01 17:18:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN
406 WILLIAMS v. TAYLOR

Opinion of the Court
prisoner had not established by a preponderance of the evidence that the result of his criminal proceeding would have
been different, that decision would be "diametrically different," "opposite in character or nature," and "mutually opposed" to our clearly established precedent because we held
in Strickland that the prisoner need only demonstrate a
"reasonable probability that . . . the result of the proceeding
would have been different." Id., at 694. A state-court decision will also be contrary to this Court's clearly established
precedent if the state court confronts a set of facts that are
materially indistinguishable from a decision of this Court and
nevertheless arrives at a result different from our precedent.
Accordingly, in either of these two scenarios, a federal court
will be unconstrained by $ 2254(d)(1) because the state-court
decision falls within that provision's "contrary to" clause.

On the other hand, a run-of-the-mill state-court decision
applying the correct legal rule from our cases to the facts
of a prisoner's case would not fit comfortably within

$ 2254(d)(1)'s "contrary to" clause. Assume, for example,
that a state-court decision on a prisoner's ineffectiveassistance claim correctly identifies Strickland as the controlling legal authority and, applying that framework, rejects the prisoner's claim. Quite clearly, the state-court
decision would be in accord with our decision in Strickland
as to the legal prerequisites for establishing an ineffectiveassistance claim, even assuming the federal court considering
the prisoner's habeas application might reach a different result applying the Strickland framework itself. It is difficult, however, to describe such a run-of-the-mill state-court
decision as "diametrically different" from, "opposite in character or nature" from, or "mutually opposed" to Strickland,
our clearly established precedent. Although the state-court
decision may be contrary to the federal court's conception of
how Strickland ought to be applied in that particular case,
the decision is not "mutually opposed" to Strickland itself.

407Cite as: 529 U. S. 362 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
Justice Stevens would instead construe $ 2254(d)(1)'s"contrary to" clause to encompass such a routine state-court

decision. That construction, however, saps the "unreason-able application" clause of any meaning. If a federal habeas
court can, under the "contrary to" clause, issue the writwhenever it concludes that the state court's

application of
clearly established federal law was incorrect, the "unreasonable application" clause becomes a nullity. We must, how-ever, if possible, give meaning to every clause of the statute.

Justice Stevens not only makes no attempt to do so, butalso construes the "contrary to" clause in a manner that ensures that the "unreasonable application" clause will have no
independent meaning. See ante, at 385-386, 388-390. We
reject that expansive interpretation of the statute. Reading $ 2254(d)(1)'s "contrary to" clause to permit a federal
court to grant relief in cases where a state court's error is
limited to the manner in which it applies Supreme Court
precedent is suspect given the logical and natural fit of the
neighboring "unreasonable application" clause to such cases.

The Fourth Circuit's interpretation of the "unreasonable
application" clause of $ 2254(d)(1) is generally correct. That
court held in Green that a state-court decision can involve an
"unreasonable application" of this Court's clearly established
precedent in two ways. First, a state-court decision involves an unreasonable application of this Court's precedent
if the state court identifies the correct governing legal rule
from this Court's cases but unreasonably applies it to the
facts of the particular state prisoner's case. Second, a
state-court decision also involves an unreasonable application of this Court's precedent if the state court either unreasonably extends a legal principle from our precedent to a
new context where it should not apply or unreasonably refuses to extend that principle to a new context where it
should apply. See 143 F. 3d, at 869-870.

A state-court decision that correctly identifies the governing legal rule but applies it unreasonably to the facts of a

529US2 Unit: $U46 [10-07-01 17:18:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN
408 WILLIAMS v. TAYLOR

Opinion of the Court
particular prisoner's case certainly would qualify as a deci-sion "involv[ing] an unreasonable application of . . . clearly

established Federal law." Indeed, we used the almost iden-tical phrase "application of law" to describe a state court's
application of law to fact in the certiorari question we posedto the parties in Wright.*

The Fourth Circuit also held in Green that state-court de-cisions that unreasonably extend a legal principle from our
precedent to a new context where it should not apply (orunreasonably refuse to extend a legal principle to a new
context where it should apply) should be analyzed under$ 2254(d)(1)'s "unreasonable application" clause. See 143
F. 3d, at 869-870. Although that holding may perhaps becorrect, the classification does have some problems of precision. Just as it is sometimes difficult to distinguish a mixedquestion of law and fact from a question of fact, it will often
be difficult to identify separately those state-court decisionsthat involve an unreasonable application of a legal principle
(or an unreasonable failure to apply a legal principle) to anew context. Indeed, on the one hand, in some cases it will
be hard to distinguish a decision involving an unreasonableextension of a legal principle from a decision involving an
unreasonable application of law to facts. On the other hand,in many of the same cases it will also be difficult to distinguish a decision involving an unreasonable extension of alegal principle from a decision that "arrives at a conclusion
opposite to that reached by this Court on a question of law,"supra, at 405. Today's case does not require us to decide how

*The legislative history of $ 2254(d)(1) also supports this interpretation.
See, e. g., 142 Cong. Rec. 7799 (1996) (remarks of Sen. Specter) ("[U]nder
the bill deference will be owed to State courts' decisions on the application
of Federal law to the facts. Unless it is unreasonable, a State court's
decision applying the law to the facts will be upheld"); 141 Cong. Rec.
14666 (1995) (remarks of Sen. Hatch) ("[W]e allow a Federal court to overturn a State court decision only if it is contrary to clearly established
Federal law or if it involves an `unreasonable application' of clearly established Federal law to the facts").

409Cite as: 529 U. S. 362 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
such "extension of legal principle" cases should be treatedunder $ 2254(d)(1). For now it is sufficient to hold that when

a state-court decision unreasonably applies the law of thisCourt to the facts of a prisoner's case, a federal court applying $ 2254(d)(1) may conclude that the state-court decisionfalls within that provision's "unreasonable application"
clause. B

There remains the task of defining what exactly qualifiesas an "unreasonable application" of law under $ 2254(d)(1).
The Fourth Circuit held in Green that a state-court decisioninvolves an "unreasonable application of . . . clearly established Federal law" only if the state court has applied federallaw "in a manner that reasonable jurists would all agree is
unreasonable." 143 F. 3d, at 870. The placement of this ad-ditional overlay on the "unreasonable application" clause was
erroneous. It is difficult to fault the Fourth Circuit forusing this language given the fact that we have employed
nearly identical terminology to describe the related inquiryundertaken by federal courts in applying the nonretroactivity rule of Teague. For example, in Lambrix v. Singletary,520 U. S. 518 (1997), we stated that a new rule is not dictated
by precedent unless it would be "apparent to all reasonable
jurists." Id., at 528 (emphasis added). In Graham v. Collins, 506 U. S. 461 (1993), another nonretroactivity case, weemployed similar language, stating that we could not say

"that all reasonable jurists would have deemed themselvescompelled to accept Graham's claim in 1984." Id., at 477
(emphasis added).Defining an "unreasonable application" by reference to a
"reasonable jurist," however, is of little assistance to thecourts that must apply $ 2254(d)(1) and, in fact, may be misleading. Stated simply, a federal habeas court making the"unreasonable application" inquiry should ask whether the
state court's application of clearly established federal lawwas objectively unreasonable. The federal habeas court

529US2 Unit: $U46 [10-07-01 17:18:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN
410 WILLIAMS v. TAYLOR

Opinion of the Court
should not transform the inquiry into a subjective one byresting its determination instead on the simple fact that at

least one of the Nation's jurists has applied the relevant fed-eral law in the same manner the state court did in the habeas
petitioner's case. The "all reasonable jurists" standardwould tend to mislead federal habeas courts by focusing their
attention on a subjective inquiry rather than on an objective
one. For example, the Fifth Circuit appears to have appliedits "reasonable jurist" standard in just such a subjective

manner. See Drinkard v. Johnson, 97 F. 3d 751, 769 (1996)(holding that state court's application of federal law was not
unreasonable because the Fifth Circuit panel split 2-1 on the
underlying mixed constitutional question), cert. denied, 520
U. S. 1107 (1997). As I explained in Wright with respect to
the "reasonable jurist" standard in the Teague context,
"[e]ven though we have characterized the new rule inquiry
as whether `reasonable jurists' could disagree as to whether
a result is dictated by precedent, the standard for determining when a case establishes a new rule is `objective,' and the
mere existence of conflicting authority does not necessarily
mean a rule is new." 505 U. S., at 304 (citation omitted).

The term "unreasonable" is no doubt difficult to define.
That said, it is a common term in the legal world and, accordingly, federal judges are familiar with its meaning. For purposes of today's opinion, the most important point is that an
unreasonable application of federal law is different from an
incorrect application of federal law. Our opinions in Wright,
for example, make that difference clear. Justice Thomas'
criticism of this Court's subsequent reliance on Brown
turned on that distinction. The Court in Brown, Justice
Thomas contended, held only that a federal habeas court
must determine whether the relevant state-court adjudication resulted in a " `satisfactory conclusion.' " 505 U. S., at
287 (quoting Brown, 344 U. S., at 463). In Justice Thomas'
view, Brown did not answer "the question whether a `satisfactory' conclusion was one that the habeas court considered

529US2 Unit: $U46 [10-07-01 17:18:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
correct, as opposed to merely reasonable." 505 U. S., at 287(emphases in original). In my separate opinion in

Wright,
I made the same distinction, maintaining that "a state court's
incorrect legal determination has [never] been allowed to
stand because it was reasonable. We have always held thatfederal courts, even on habeas, have an independent obligation to say what the law is." Id., at 305 (emphases added).
In $ 2254(d)(1), Congress specifically used the word "unrea-sonable," and not a term like "erroneous" or "incorrect."

Under $ 2254(d)(1)'s "unreasonable application" clause, then,a federal habeas court may not issue the writ simply because
that court concludes in its independent judgment that the
relevant state-court decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly. Rather, that application
must also be unreasonable.

Justice Stevens turns a blind eye to the debate in
Wright because he finds no indication in $ 2254(d)(1) itself
that Congress was "directly influenced" by Justice Thomas'
opinion in Wright. Ante, at 387-388, n. 14. As Justice
Stevens himself apparently recognizes, however, Congress
need not mention a prior decision of this Court by name in
a statute's text in order to adopt either a rule or a meaning
given a certain term in that decision. See ante, at 380, n. 11.
In any event, whether Congress intended to codify the standard of review suggested by Justice Thomas in Wright is
beside the point. Wright is important for the light it sheds
on $ 2254(d)(1)'s requirement that a federal habeas court inquire into the reasonableness of a state court's application
of clearly established federal law. The separate opinions in
Wright concerned the very issue addressed by $ 2254(d)(1)'s
"unreasonable application" clause--whether, in reviewing a
state-court decision on a state prisoner's claims under federal law, a federal habeas court should ask whether the
state-court decision was correct or simply whether it was
reasonable. Justice Stevens' claim that the debate in
Wright concerned only the meaning of the Teague nonretro529US2 Unit: $U46 [10-07-01 17:18:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN
412 WILLIAMS v. TAYLOR

Opinion of the Court
activity rule is simply incorrect. See ante, at 387-388, n. 14.As even a cursory review of

Justice Thomas' opinion and
my own opinion reveals, both the broader debate and thespecific statements to which we refer, see

supra, at 410-411,
concerned precisely the issue of the standard of review to beemployed by federal habeas courts. The

Wright opinions
confirm what $ 2254(d)(1)'s language already makes clear--
that an unreasonable application of federal law is differentfrom an

incorrect or erroneous application of federal law.
Throughout this discussion the meaning of the phrase"clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States" has been put to the side.
That statutory phrase refers to the holdings, as opposed to
the dicta, of this Court's decisions as of the time of the relevant state-court decision. In this respect, the "clearly established Federal law" phrase bears only a slight connection
to our Teague jurisprudence. With one caveat, whatever
would qualify as an old rule under our Teague jurisprudence will constitute "clearly established Federal law, as
determined by the Supreme Court of the United States"
under $ 2254(d)(1). See, e. g., Stringer v. Black, 503 U. S.
222, 228 (1992) (using term "old rule"). The one caveat, as
the statutory language makes clear, is that $ 2254(d)(1) restricts the source of clearly established law to this Court's
jurisprudence.

In sum, $ 2254(d)(1) places a new constraint on the power
of a federal habeas court to grant a state prisoner's application for a writ of habeas corpus with respect to claims adjudicated on the merits in state court. Under $ 2254(d)(1), the
writ may issue only if one of the following two conditions is
satisfied--the state-court adjudication resulted in a decision
that (1) "was contrary to . . . clearly established Federal law,
as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,"
or (2) "involved an unreasonable application of . . . clearly
established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme
Court of the United States." Under the "contrary to"

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
clause, a federal habeas court may grant the writ if the statecourt arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by this

Court on a question of law or if the state court decides acase differently than this Court has on a set of materially
indistinguishable facts. Under the "unreasonable applica-tion" clause, a federal habeas court may grant the writ if the
state court identifies the correct governing legal principlefrom this Court's decisions but unreasonably applies that
principle to the facts of the prisoner's case.

III
Although I disagree with Justice Stevens concerningthe standard we must apply under $ 2254(d)(1) in evaluating

Terry Williams' claims on habeas, I agree with the Courtthat the Virginia Supreme Court's adjudication of Williams'
claim of ineffective assistance of counsel resulted in a deci-sion that was both contrary to and involved an unreasonable
application of this Court's clearly established precedent.Specifically, I believe that the Court's discussion in Parts III
and IV is correct and that it demonstrates the reasons thatthe Virginia Supreme Court's decision in Williams' case, even
under the interpretation of $ 2254(d)(1) I have set forthabove, was both contrary to and involved an unreasonable
application of our precedent.First, I agree with the Court that our decision in

Strick-land undoubtedly qualifies as "clearly established Federal

law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the UnitedStates," within the meaning of $ 2254(d)(1). See ante, at
390-391. Second, I agree that the Virginia Supreme Court'sdecision was contrary to that clearly established federal law
to the extent it held that our decision in Lockhart v. Fretwell,506 U. S. 364 (1993), somehow modified or supplanted the
rule set forth in Strickland. See ante, at 391-395, 397.Specifically, the Virginia Supreme Court's decision was contrary to Strickland itself, where we held that a defendantdemonstrates prejudice by showing "that there is a reason529US2 Unit: $U46 [10-07-01 17:18:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN
414 WILLIAMS v. TAYLOR

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
able probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different."

466 U. S., at 694. The Virginia Supreme Court held, in con-trast, that such a focus on outcome determination was insufficient standing alone. See Williams v. Warden of Mecklenburg Correctional Center, 254 Va. 16, 25, 27, 487 S. E. 2d
194, 199, 200 (1997). Lockhart does not support that broad
proposition. As I explained in my concurring opinion inthat case, "in the vast majority of cases . . . [t]he determinative question--whether there is `a reasonable probabilitythat, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of
the proceeding would have been different'--remains unchanged." 506 U. S., at 373 (quoting Strickland, 466 U. S.,
at 694). In his attempt to demonstrate prejudice, Williams
did not rely on any "considerations that, as a matter of law,
ought not inform the [prejudice] inquiry." Lockhart, supra,
at 373 (O'Connor, J., concurring). Accordingly, as the
Court ably explains, the Virginia Supreme Court's decision
was contrary to Strickland.

To be sure, as The Chief Justice notes, post, at 417-418
(opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part), the Virginia Supreme Court did also inquire whether Williams had
demonstrated a reasonable probability that, but for his trial
counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of his sentencing
would have been different. See 254 Va., at 25-26, 487 S. E.
2d, at 199-200. It is impossible to determine, however, the
extent to which the Virginia Supreme Court's error with respect to its reading of Lockhart affected its ultimate finding
that Williams suffered no prejudice. For example, at the
conclusion of its discussion of whether Williams had demonstrated a reasonable probability of a different outcome at
sentencing, the Virginia Supreme Court faulted the Virginia
Circuit Court for its "emphasis on mere outcome determination, without proper attention to whether the result of the
criminal proceeding was fundamentally unfair or unreliable."
254 Va., at 27, 487 S. E. 2d, at 200. As the Court explains,

529US2 Unit: $U46 [10-07-01 17:18:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN

415Cite as: 529 U. S. 362 (2000)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
however, see ante, at 393, Williams' case did not implicatethe unusual circumstances present in cases like

Lockhart or
Nix v. Whiteside, 475 U. S. 157 (1986). Accordingly, for thevery reasons I set forth in my

Lockhart concurrence, the
emphasis on outcome was entirely appropriate in Williams'case.

Third, I also agree with the Court that, to the extent the
Virginia Supreme Court did apply Strickland, its applica-tion was unreasonable. See

ante, at 395-398. As the Court
correctly recounts, Williams' trial counsel failed to conductan investigation that would have uncovered substantial

amounts of mitigation evidence. See ante, at 395-396. For
example, speaking only of that evidence concerning Williams'
"nightmarish childhood," ante, at 395, the mitigation evidence that trial counsel failed to present to the jury showed
that "Williams' parents had been imprisoned for the criminal
neglect of Williams and his siblings, that Williams had been
severely and repeatedly beaten by his father, that he had
been committed to the custody of the social services bureau
for two years during his parents' incarceration (including one
stint in an abusive foster home), and then, after his parents
were released from prison, had been returned to his parents'
custody," ibid. (footnote omitted). See also ante, at 395,
n. 19. The consequence of counsel's failure to conduct the
requisite, diligent investigation into his client's troubling
background and unique personal circumstances manifested
itself during his generic, unapologetic closing argument,
which provided the jury with no reasons to spare petitioner's
life. More generally, the Virginia Circuit Court found that
Williams' trial counsel failed to present evidence showing
that Williams "had a deprived and abused upbringing; that
he may have been a neglected and mistreated child; that he
came from an alcoholic family; . . . that he was borderline
mentally retarded;" and that "[his] conduct had been good
in certain structured settings in his life (such as when he
was incarcerated)." App. 422-423. In addition, the Circuit

Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.
Court noted the existence of "friends, neighbors and family
of [Williams] who would have testified that he had redeeming
qualities." Id., at 423. Based on its consideration of all of
this evidence, the same trial judge that originally found Williams' death sentence " `justified and warranted,' " id., at 155,
concluded that trial counsel's deficient performance prejudiced Williams, id., at 424, and accordingly recommended
that Williams be granted a new sentencing hearing, ibid.
The Virginia Supreme Court's decision reveals an obvious
failure to consider the totality of the omitted mitigation evidence. See 254 Va., at 26, 487 S. E. 2d, at 200 ("At most, this
evidence would have shown that numerous people, mostly
relatives, thought that [Williams] was nonviolent and could
cope very well in a structured environment"). For that reason, and the remaining factors discussed in the Court's opinion, I believe that the Virginia Supreme Court's decision "involved an unreasonable application of . . . clearly established
Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the
United States."

Accordingly, although I disagree with the interpretation of

$ 2254(d)(1) set forth in Part II of Justice Stevens' opinion,
I join Parts I, III, and IV of the Court's opinion and concur
in the judgment of reversal.

Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice Scalia
and Justice Thomas join, concurring in part and dissenting
in part.

I agree with the Court's interpretation of 28 U. S. C.

$ 2254(d)(1) (1994 ed., Supp. III), see ante, at 402-413 (opinion
of O'Connor, J.), but disagree with its decision to grant habeas relief in this case.

There is "clearly established Federal law, as determined
by [this Court]" that governs petitioner's claim of ineffective
assistance of counsel: Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S.
668 (1984). Thus, we must determine whether the Virginia

Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.
Supreme Court's adjudication was "contrary to" or an "un-reasonable application of " Strickland.

Generally, in an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel casewhere the state court applies Strickland, federal habeas
courts can proceed directly to "unreasonable application" re-view. But, according to the substance of petitioner's argument, this could be one of the rare cases where a state courtapplied the wrong Supreme Court precedent, and, consequently, reached an incorrect result. Petitioner argues, andthe Court agrees, that the Virginia Supreme Court improperly held that Lockhart v. Fretwell, 506 U. S. 364 (1993),"modified or in some way supplanted" the rule set down in
Strickland. See ante, at 391. I agree that such a holdingwould be improper. But the Virginia Supreme Court did
not so hold as it did not rely on Lockhart to reach its decision.Before delving into the evidence presented at the sentencing proceeding, the Virginia Supreme Court stated:

"We shall demonstrate that the criminal proceeding sen-tencing defendant to death was not fundamentally unfair

or unreliable, and that the prisoner's assertions aboutthe potential effects of the omitted proof do not establish
a `reasonable probability' that the result of the proceed-ing would have been different, nor any probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome. There-fore, any ineffective assistance of counsel did not result
in actual prejudice to the accused." Williams v. Warden, 254 Va. 16, 25, 487 S. E. 2d 194, 199 (1997).

While the first part of this statement refers to Lockhart, therest of the statement is straight out of Strickland. Indeed,

after the initial allusion to Lockhart, the Virginia SupremeCourt's analysis explicitly proceeds under

Strickland alone.*

*In analyzing the evidence that was presented to the sentencing jury,
the Virginia Supreme Court stated: "Drawing on Strickland, we hold that,
even assuming the challenged conduct of counsel was unreasonable, the
prisoner `suffered insufficient prejudice to warrant setting aside his death

418 WILLIAMS v. TAYLOR

Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.
See 254 Va., at 26-27, 487 S. E. 2d, at 200. Because theVirginia Supreme Court did not rely on Lockhart to make

its decision, and, instead, appropriately relied on Strickland,that court's adjudication was not "contrary to" this Court's
clearly established precedent.The question then becomes whether the Virginia Supreme
Court's adjudication resulted from an "unreasonable applica-tion of "

Strickland. In my view, it did not.I, like the Virginia Supreme Court and the Federal Court

of Appeals below, will assume without deciding that counsel'sperformance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. As to the prejudice inquiry, I agree with the Court ofAppeals that evidence showing that petitioner presented a
future danger to society was overwhelming. As that courtstated:

"The murder of Mr. Stone was just one act in a crimespree that lasted most of Williams's life. Indeed, the
jury heard evidence that, in the months following themurder of Mr. Stone, Williams savagely beat an elderly
woman, stole two cars, set fire to a home, stabbed a manduring a robbery, set fire to the city jail, and confessed
to having strong urges to choke other inmates and tobreak a fellow prisoner's jaw." 163 F. 3d 860, 868

Strickland applies with full force here: `Given the overwhelming aggravating factors, there is no reasonable probability that the omitted evidence
would have changed the conclusion that the aggravating circumstances
outweighed the mitigating circumstances and, hence, the sentence imposed;' " 254 Va., at 26, 487 S. E. 2d, at 200 (quoting Strickland, supra, at
700); and "[i]n conclusion, employing the language of Strickland, the prisoner `has made no showing that the justice of his sentence was rendered
unreliable by a breakdown in the adversary process caused by deficiencies
in counsel's assistance. [The prisoner's] sentencing proceeding was not
fundamentally unfair,' " 254 Va., at 27, 487 S. E. 2d, at 200 (quoting Strickland, supra, at 700).

Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.
In Strickland, we said that both the performance and prej-udice components of the ineffectiveness inquiry are mixed

questions of law and fact. 466 U. S., at 698. It is with thiskind of a question that the "unreasonable application of "
clause takes on meaning. While the determination of "prej-udice" in the legal sense may be a question of law, the subsidiary inquiries are heavily factbound.Here, there was strong evidence that petitioner would continue to be a danger to society, both in and out of prison. Itwas not, therefore, unreasonable for the Virginia Supreme
Court to decide that a jury would not have been swayed byevidence demonstrating that petitioner had a terrible childhood and a low IQ. See ante, at 395-396. The potentialmitigating evidence that may have countered the finding that
petitioner was a future danger was testimony that petitionerwas not dangerous while in detention. See

ante, at 396.But, again, it is not unreasonable to assume that the jury

would have viewed this mitigation as unconvincing uponhearing that petitioner set fire to his cell while awaiting trial
for the murder at hand and has repeated visions of harmingother inmates.

Accordingly, I would hold that habeas relief is barred by28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d) (1994 ed., Supp. III).

WILLIAMS v. TAYLOR, WARDEN
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fourth circuit

No. 99-6615. Argued February 28, 2000--Decided April 18, 2000
After petitioner was convicted of two capital murders and other crimes,

he was sentenced to death. The Supreme Court of Virginia affirmed
on direct appeal and later dismissed petitioner's state habeas corpus
petition. He then sought federal habeas relief, requesting, among other
things, an evidentiary hearing on three constitutional claims, which he
had been unable to develop in the state-court proceedings. Those
claims were that (1) the prosecution had violated Brady v. Maryland,
373 U. S. 83, in failing to disclose a report of a pretrial psychiatric examination of Jeffrey Cruse, petitioner's accomplice and the Commonwealth's
main witness against petitioner; (2) the trial was rendered unfair by the
seating of a juror who at voir dire had not revealed possible sources of
bias; and (3) a prosecutor committed misconduct in failing to reveal his
knowledge of the juror's possible bias. The District Court granted an
evidentiary hearing on, inter alia, the latter two claims, but denied a
hearing on the Brady claim. Before any hearing could be held, however, the Fourth Circuit granted the Commonwealth's requests for an
emergency stay and for a writ of mandamus and prohibition, which were
based on the argument that an evidentiary hearing was prohibited by
28 U. S. C. $ 2254(e)(2), as amended by the Antiterrorism and Effective
Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). On remand, the District Court
vacated its order granting an evidentiary hearing and dismissed the
petition, having determined petitioner could not satisfy $ 2254(e)(2)'s requirements. In affirming, the Fourth Circuit agreed with petitioner's
argument that the statute would not apply if he had exercised diligence
in state court, but held, among other things, that he had not been diligent and so had "failed to develop the factual basis of [his three] claim[s]
in State court," $ 2254(e)(2). The court concluded that petitioner could
not satisfy the statute's conditions for excusing his failure to develop
the facts and held him barred from receiving an evidentiary hearing.

Held: Under $ 2254(e)(2), as amended by AEDPA, a "fail[ure] to develop"

a claim's factual basis in state-court proceedings is not established unless there is lack of diligence, or some greater fault, attributable to the
prisoner or his counsel. The statute does not bar the evidentiary hearing petitioner seeks on his juror bias and prosecutorial misconduct
claims, but bars a hearing on his Brady claim because he "failed to

Syllabus
develop" that claim's factual basis in state court and concedes his inability to satisfy the statute's further stringent conditions for excusing the
deficiency. Pp. 429-445.

(a) Petitioner filed his federal habeas petition after AEDPA's effective date, so his case is controlled by $ 2254(e)(2)'s opening clause, which
specifies that "[i]f the [federal habeas] applicant has failed to develop
the factual basis of a claim in State court proceedings, the court shall
not hold an evidentiary hearing on the claim" unless the applicant makes
specified showings. Pp. 429-430.

(b) The analysis begins with the language of the statute. Although
"fail" is sometimes used in a neutral way, not importing fault or want of
diligence, this is not the sense in which the word "failed" is used in

$ 2254(e)(2). A statute's words must be given their ordinary, contemporary, common meaning, absent an indication Congress intended them to
bear some different import. E. g., Walters v. Metropolitan Ed. Enterprises, Inc., 519 U. S. 202, 207. In its customary and preferred sense,
"fail" connotes some omission, fault, or negligence on the part of the
person who has failed to do something. If Congress had instead intended a "no-fault" standard, it would have had to do no more than
use, in lieu of the phrase "has failed to," the phrase "did not." This
interpretation has support in Keeney v. Tamayo-Reyes, 504 U. S. 1, 8,
whose threshold standard of diligence is codified in $ 2254(e)(2)'s opening
clause. The Court's interpretation also avoids putting $ 2254(e)(2) in
needless tension with $ 2254(d), which authorizes habeas relief if the
prisoner developed his claim in state court and can prove the state
court's decision was "contrary to, or an unreasonable application of,
clearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of
the United States." This Court rejects the Commonwealth's arguments for a "no-fault" reading: that treating the prisoner's lack of diligence in state court as a prerequisite for application of $ 2254(e)(2)
renders a nullity of $ 2254(e)(2)(A)(ii)'s provision requiring the prisoner to show "a factual predicate [of his claim] could not have been
previously discovered through the exercise of due diligence"; and that
anything less than a no-fault understanding of $ 2254(e)(2) is contrary to
AEDPA's purpose to further comity, finality, and federalism principles.
Pp. 431-437.

(c) Petitioner did not exercise the diligence required to preserve his
claim that nondisclosure of Cruse's psychiatric report contravened
Brady. The report, which mentioned Cruse had little recollection of
the murders because he was intoxicated at the time, was prepared before petitioner was tried; yet it was not raised by petitioner until he
filed his federal habeas petition. Given evidence in the record that his
state habeas counsel knew of the report's existence and its potential

Syllabus
importance, yet failed to investigate in anything but a cursory manner,
this Court is not satisfied with petitioner's explanation that, although
an investigator for his federal habeas counsel discovered the report in
Cruse's court file, his state counsel had not seen the report when he
reviewed the same file. Because this constitutes a failure to develop
the factual basis of petitioner's Brady claim in state court, this Court
must determine if the requirements in the balance of $ 2254(e)(2) are
satisfied so that petitioner's failure is excused. Subparagraph (B) of

$ 2254(e)(2) conditions a hearing upon a showing, by clear and convincing
evidence, that no reasonable factfinder would have found petitioner
guilty of capital murder but for the alleged constitutional error. Petitioner concedes he cannot make this showing, and the case has been
presented to this Court on that premise. Accordingly, the Fourth
Circuit's judgment barring an evidentiary hearing on this claim is affirmed. Pp. 437-440.

(d) However, petitioner has met the burden of showing he was diligent in efforts to develop the facts supporting his juror bias and prosecutorial misconduct claims in state court. Those claims are based on
two questions posed by the trial judge at voir dire. First, the judge
asked prospective jurors whether any of them was related to, inter
alios, Deputy Sheriff Meinhard, who investigated the crime scene, interrogated Cruse, and later became the prosecution's first witness. Venire
member Stinnett, who had divorced Meinhard after a 17-year marriage
and four children, remained silent, thereby indicating the answer to the
question was "no." Second, the judge asked whether any prospective
juror had ever been represented by any of the attorneys in the case,
including prosecutor Woodson. Stinnett again said nothing, although
Woodson had represented her during her divorce from Meinhard.
Later, Woodson admitted he knew Stinnett and Meinhard had been married and divorced, but stated that he did not consider divorced people
to be "related" and that he had no recollection of having been involved
as a private attorney in the divorce. Stinnett's silence after the first
question could suggest to the factfinder an unwillingness to be forthcoming; this in turn could bear on her failure to disclose that Woodson
had been her attorney. Moreover, her failure to divulge material information in response to the second question was misleading as a matter
of fact because Woodson was her counsel. Coupled with Woodson's own
reticence, these omissions as a whole disclose the need for an evidentiary
hearing. This Court disagrees with the Fourth Circuit's conclusion that
petitioner's state habeas counsel should have discovered Stinnett's relationship to Meinhard and Woodson. The trial record contains no evidence which would have put a reasonable attorney on notice that Stinnett's nonresponse was a deliberate omission of material information,

Syllabus
and counsel had no reason to believe Stinnett had been married to
Meinhard or been represented by Woodson. Moreover, because state
postconviction relief was no longer available at the time the facts came
to light, it would have been futile for petitioner to return to the Virginia
courts, so that he cannot be said to have failed to develop the facts in
state court by reason of having neglected to pursue remedies available
under Virginia law. The foregoing analysis establishes cause for any
procedural default petitioner may have committed in not presenting
these claims to the Virginia courts in the first instance. Questions regarding the standard for determining the prejudice that petitioner must
establish to obtain relief on these claims can be addressed by the lower
courts during further proceedings. These courts should take due account of the District Court's earlier decision to grant an evidentiary
hearing based in part on its belief that Stinnett deliberately lied on voir
dire. Pp. 440-444.

424 WILLIAMS v. TAYLOR

Opinion of the Court
Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.
Petitioner Michael Wayne Williams received a capital sen-tence for the murders of Morris Keller, Jr., and Keller's wife,

Mary Elizabeth. Petitioner later sought a writ of habeascorpus in federal court. Accompanying his petition was a
request for an evidentiary hearing on constitutional claimswhich, he alleged, he had been unable to develop in statecourt proceedings. The question in this case is whether 28U. S. C. $ 2254(e)(2) (1994 ed., Supp. III), as amended by the
Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996(AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214, bars the evidentiary hearing petitioner seeks. If petitioner "has failed to develop the factualbasis of [his] claim[s] in State court proceedings," his case is
subject to $ 2254(e)(2), and he may not receive a hearing be-cause he concedes his inability to satisfy the statute's further
stringent conditions for excusing the deficiency.

I
On the evening of February 27, 1993, Verena Lozano Jamesdropped off petitioner and his friend Jeffrey Alan Cruse near

a local store in a rural area of Cumberland County, Virginia.The pair planned to rob the store's employees and customers
using a .357 revolver petitioner had stolen in the course ofa quadruple murder and robbery he had committed two
months earlier. Finding the store closed, petitioner andCruse walked to the Kellers' home. Petitioner was familiar
with the couple, having grown up down the road from wherethey lived. He told Cruse they would have "a couple thousand dollars." App. 78. Cruse, who had been holding the.357, handed the gun to petitioner and knocked on the door.
When Mr. Keller opened the door, petitioner pointed the gunat him as the two intruders forced their way inside. Petitioner and Cruse forced Mr. Keller to the kitchen, where
John Cornyn of Texas, Jan Graham of Utah, and Christine O. Gregoire
of Washington.

Opinion of the Court
they discovered Mrs. Keller. Petitioner ordered the captives to remove their clothing. While petitioner kept guard
on the Kellers, Cruse searched the house for money and
other valuables. He found a .38-caliber handgun and bullets. Upon Cruse's return to the kitchen, petitioner had
Cruse tie their captives with telephone cords. The Kellers
were confined to separate closets while the intruders continued ransacking the house.

When they gathered all they wanted, petitioner and Cruse
decided to rape Mrs. Keller. With Mrs. Keller pleading with
them not to hurt her or her husband, petitioner raped her.
Cruse did the same. Petitioner then ordered the Kellers to
shower and dress and "take a walk" with him and Cruse.
Id., at 97. As they were leaving, petitioner told Mrs. Keller
he and Cruse were going to burn down the house. Mrs. Keller begged to be allowed to retrieve her marriage license,
which she did, guarded by petitioner.

As the prosecution later presented the case, details of the
murders were as follows. Petitioner, now carrying the .38,
and Cruse, carrying the .357, took the Kellers to a thicket
down a dirt road from the house. With petitioner standing
behind Mr. Keller and Cruse behind Mrs. Keller, petitioner
told Cruse, "We'll shoot at the count of three." Id., at 103.
At the third count, petitioner shot Mr. Keller in the head,
and Mr. Keller collapsed to the ground. Cruse did not shoot
Mrs. Keller at the same moment. Saying "he didn't want to
leave no witnesses," petitioner urged Cruse to shoot Mrs.
Keller. Ibid. Cruse fired one shot into her head. Despite
his wound, Mr. Keller stood up, but petitioner shot him a
second time. To ensure the Kellers were dead, petitioner
shot each of them two or three more times.

After returning to the house and loading the stolen property into the Kellers' jeep, petitioner and Cruse set fire to
the house and drove the jeep to Fredericksburg, Virginia,
where they sold some of the property. They threw the re529US2 Unit: $U47 [10-04-01 09:34:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN

maining property and the .357 revolver into the Rappahan-nock River and set fire to the jeep.

Pursuing a lead from Verena James, the police interviewedCruse about the fire at the Kellers' home. Petitioner had
fled to Florida. Cruse provided no useful information untilthe police discovered the bodies of the victims, at which point
Cruse consulted counsel. In a plea bargain Cruse agreed to
disclose the details of the crimes in exchange for the Com-monwealth's promise not to seek the death penalty against

him. Cruse described the murders but made no mention ofhis own act of rape. When the Commonwealth discovered
the omission, it revoked the plea agreement and charged
Cruse with capital murder.

Petitioner was arrested and charged with robbery, abduction, rape, and the capital murders of the Kellers. At trial
in January 1994, Cruse was the Commonwealth's main witness. He recounted the murders as we have just described.
Cruse testified petitioner raped Mrs. Keller, shot Mr. Keller
at least twice, and shot Mrs. Keller several times after she
had been felled by Cruse's bullet. He also described petitioner as the mastermind of the murders. The circumstances of the first plea agreement between the Commonwealth and Cruse and its revocation were disclosed to the
jury. Id., at 158-159. Testifying on his own behalf, petitioner admitted he was the first to shoot Mr. Keller and it
was his idea to rob the store and set fire to the house. He
denied, however, raping or shooting Mrs. Keller, and claimed
to have shot Mr. Keller only once. Petitioner blamed Cruse
for the remaining shots and disputed some other parts of
Cruse's testimony.

The jury convicted petitioner on all counts. After considering the aggravating and mitigating evidence presented
during the sentencing phase, the jury found the aggravating
circumstances of future dangerousness and vileness of the
crimes and recommended a death sentence. The trial court
imposed the recommended sentence. The Supreme Court

Opinion of the Court
of Virginia affirmed petitioner's convictions and sentence,
Williams v. Commonwealth, 248 Va. 528, 450 S. E. 2d 365
(1994), and we denied certiorari, Williams v. Virginia, 515U. S. 1161 (1995). In a separate proceeding, Cruse pleaded

guilty to the capital murder of Mrs. Keller and the first-degree murder of Mr. Keller. After the prosecution asked
the sentencing court to spare his life because of his testimony against petitioner, Cruse was sentenced to lifeimprisonment.

Petitioner filed a habeas petition in state court alleging, inrelevant part, that the Commonwealth failed to disclose a
second agreement it had reached with Cruse after the first
one was revoked. The new agreement, petitioner alleged,
was an informal undertaking by the prosecution to recommend a life sentence in exchange for Cruse's testimony.
Finding no merit to petitioner's claims, the Virginia Supreme
Court dismissed the habeas petition, and we again denied
certiorari. Williams v. Netherland, 519 U. S. 877 (1996).

Petitioner filed a habeas petition in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia on November
20, 1996. In addition to his claim regarding the alleged undisclosed agreement between the Commonwealth and Cruse,
the petition raised three claims relevant to questions now
before us. First, petitioner claimed the prosecution had violated Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963), in failing to
disclose a report of a confidential pretrial psychiatric examination of Cruse. Second, petitioner alleged his trial was
rendered unfair by the seating of a juror who at voir dire
had not revealed possible sources of bias. Finally, petitioner
alleged one of the prosecutors committed misconduct in failing to reveal his knowledge of the juror's possible bias.

The District Court granted an evidentiary hearing on the
undisclosed agreement and the allegations of juror bias and
prosecutorial misconduct but denied a hearing on the psychiatric report. Before the evidentiary hearing could be held,
the Commonwealth filed an application for an emergency

Opinion of the Court
stay and a petition for a writ of mandamus and prohibition
in the Court of Appeals. The Commonwealth argued that
petitioner's evidentiary hearing was prohibited by 28 U. S. C.

$ 2254(e)(2) (1994 ed., Supp. III). A divided panel of the
Court of Appeals granted the emergency stay and remanded
for the District Court to apply the statute to petitioner's
request for an evidentiary hearing. On remand, the District
Court vacated its order granting an evidentiary hearing and
dismissed the petition, having determined petitioner could
not satisfy $ 2254(e)(2)'s requirements.

The Court of Appeals affirmed. It first considered petitioner's argument that $ 2254(e)(2) did not apply to his case
because he had been diligent in attempting to develop his
claims in state court. Citing its decision in Cardwell v.
Greene, 152 F. 3d 331 (CA4), cert. denied, 525 U. S. 1037
(1998), the Court of Appeals agreed with petitioner that

$ 2254(e)(2) would not apply if he had exercised diligence in
state court. The court held, however, that petitioner had
not been diligent and so had "failed to develop" in state court
the factual bases of his Brady, juror bias, and prosecutorial
misconduct claims. See 189 F. 3d 421, 426 (CA4 1999). The
Court of Appeals concluded petitioner could not satisfy the
statute's conditions for excusing his failure to develop
the facts and held him barred from receiving an evidentiary
hearing. The Court of Appeals ruled in the alternative that,
even if $ 2254(e)(2) did not apply, petitioner would be ineligible for an evidentiary hearing under the cause and prejudice
standard of pre-AEDPA law. See id., at 428.

Addressing petitioner's claim of an undisclosed informal
agreement between the Commonwealth and Cruse, the
Court of Appeals rejected it on the merits under 28 U. S. C.

$ 2254(d)(1) and, as a result, did not consider whether

$ 2254(e)(2) applied. See 189 F. 3d, at 429.

On October 18, 1999, petitioner filed an application for stay
of execution and a petition for a writ of certiorari. On Octo529US2 Unit: $U47 [10-04-01 09:34:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ber 28, we stayed petitioner's execution and granted certio-rari to decide whether $ 2254(e)(2) precludes him from receiving an evidentiary hearing on his claims. See 528 U. S. 960(1999). We now affirm in part and reverse in part.

Petitioner filed his federal habeas petition after AEDPA'seffective date, so the statute applies to his case. See

Lindhv.
Murphy, 521 U. S. 320, 326-327 (1997). The Common-wealth argues AEDPA bars petitioner from receiving an

evidentiary hearing on any claim whose factual basis wasnot developed in state court, absent narrow circumstances
not applicable here. Petitioner did not develop, or raise, hisclaims of juror bias, prosecutorial misconduct, or the prosecution's alleged Brady violation regarding Cruse's psychiat-ric report until he filed his federal habeas petition. Petitioner explains he could not have developed the claimsearlier because he was unaware, through no fault of his own,
of the underlying facts. As a consequence, petitioner con-tends, AEDPA erects no barrier to an evidentiary hearing
in federal court.Section 2254(e)(2), the provision which controls whether
petitioner may receive an evidentiary hearing in federaldistrict court on the claims that were not developed in the
Virginia courts, becomes the central point of our analysis.It provides as follows:

"If the applicant has failed to develop the factual basisof a claim in State court proceedings, the court shall
not hold an evidentiary hearing on the claim unless theapplicant shows that--

"(A) the claim relies on--"(i) a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive
to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, thatwas previously unavailable; or

Opinion of the Court
"(ii) a factual predicate that could not have been previously discovered through the exercise of due diligence; and

"(B) the facts underlying the claim would be sufficient
to establish by clear and convincing evidence that but
for constitutional error, no reasonable factfinder would
have found the applicant guilty of the underlying
offense."

By the terms of its opening clause the statute applies only
to prisoners who have "failed to develop the factual basis of
a claim in State court proceedings." If the prisoner has
failed to develop the facts, an evidentiary hearing cannot be
granted unless the prisoner's case meets the other conditions
of $ 2254(e)(2). Here, petitioner concedes his case does not
comply with $ 2254(e)(2)(B), see Brief for Petitioner 25, so he
may receive an evidentiary hearing only if his claims fall outside the opening clause.

There was no hearing in state court on any of the claims
for which petitioner now seeks an evidentiary hearing.
That, says the Commonwealth, is the end of the matter. In
its view petitioner, whether or not through his own fault or
neglect, still "failed to develop the factual basis of a claim in
State court proceedings." Petitioner, on the other hand,
says the phrase "failed to develop" means lack of diligence in
developing the claims, a defalcation he contends did not occur
since he made adequate efforts during state-court proceedings to discover and present the underlying facts. The
Court of Appeals agreed with petitioner's interpretation of

$ 2254(e)(2) but believed petitioner had not exercised enough
diligence to avoid the statutory bar. See 189 F. 3d, at 426.
We agree with petitioner and the Court of Appeals that
"failed to develop" implies some lack of diligence; but, unlike
the Court of Appeals, we find no lack of diligence on petitioner's part with regard to two of his three claims.

Opinion of the Court

B
We start, as always, with the language of the statute. See
United States v. Ron Pair Enterprises, Inc., 489 U. S. 235,241 (1989). Section 2254(e)(2) begins with a conditional

clause, "[i]f the applicant has failed to develop the factualbasis of a claim in State court proceedings," which directs
attention to the prisoner's efforts in state court. We askfirst whether the factual basis was indeed developed in state
court, a question susceptible, in the normal course, of a sim-ple yes or no answer. Here the answer is no.

The Commonwealth would have the analysis begin andend there. Under its no-fault reading of the statute, if there
is no factual development in the state court, the federal ha-beas court may not inquire into the reasons for the default
when determining whether the opening clause of $ 2254(e)(2)applies. We do not agree with the Commonwealth's interpretation of the word "failed."We do not deny "fail" is sometimes used in a neutral way,
not importing fault or want of diligence. So the phrase "Wefail to understand his argument" can mean simply "We cannot understand his argument." This is not the sense inwhich the word "failed" is used here, however.

We give the words of a statute their " `ordinary, contempo-rary, common meaning,' " absent an indication Congress intended them to bear some different import. Walters v. Met-ropolitan Ed. Enterprises, Inc., 519 U. S. 202, 207 (1997)
(quoting Pioneer Investment Services Co. v. Brunswick Associates Ltd. Partnership, 507 U. S. 380 (1993)). See also
Bailey v. United States, 516 U. S. 137, 141 (1995). In its cus-tomary and preferred sense, "fail" connotes some omission,

fault, or negligence on the part of the person who has failedto do something. See,

e. g., Webster's New International
Dictionary 910 (2d ed. 1939) (defining "fail" as "to be want-ing; to fall short; to be or become deficient in any measure

or degree," and "failure" as "a falling short," "a deficiency or

lack," and an "[o]mission to perform"); Webster's New Inter-national Dictionary 814 (3d ed. 1993) ("to leave some possible

or expected action unperformed or some condition un-achieved"). See also Black's Law Dictionary 594 (6th ed.
1990) (defining "fail" as "[f]ault, negligence, or refusal"). Tosay a person has failed in a duty implies he did not take the
necessary steps to fulfill it. He is, as a consequence, at fault
and bears responsibility for the failure. In this sense, a per-son is not at fault when his diligent efforts to perform an act

are thwarted, for example, by the conduct of another or byhappenstance. Fault lies, in those circumstances, either
with the person who interfered with the accomplishment of
the act or with no one at all. We conclude Congress used
the word "failed" in the sense just described. Had Congress
intended a no-fault standard, it would have had no difficulty
in making its intent plain. It would have had to do no more
than use, in lieu of the phrase "has failed to," the phrase
"did not."

Under the opening clause of $ 2254(e)(2), a failure to develop the factual basis of a claim is not established unless
there is lack of diligence, or some greater fault, attributable
to the prisoner or the prisoner's counsel. In this we agree
with the Court of Appeals and with all other courts of
appeals which have addressed the issue. See, e. g., Baja v.
Ducharme, 187 F. 3d 1075, 1078-1079 (CA9 1999); Miller v.
Champion, 161 F. 3d 1249, 1253 (CA10 1998); Cardwell, 152
F. 3d, at 337; McDonald v. Johnson, 139 F. 3d 1056, 1059
(CA5 1998); Burris v. Parke, 116 F. 3d 256, 258 (CA7 1997);
Love v. Morton, 112 F. 3d 131, 136 (CA3 1997).

Our interpretation of $ 2254(e)(2)'s opening clause has support in Keeney v. Tamayo-Reyes, 504 U. S. 1 (1992), a case
decided four years before AEDPA's enactment. In Keeney,
a prisoner with little knowledge of English sought an evidentiary hearing in federal court, alleging his nolo contendere
plea to a manslaughter charge was not knowing and voluntary because of inaccuracies in the translation of the plea

Opinion of the Court
proceedings. The prisoner had not developed the facts ofhis claim in state collateral proceedings, an omission caused

by the negligence of his state postconviction counsel. See
id., at 4, 8-9. The Court characterized this as the "prisoner's failure to develop material facts in state court." Id.,at 8. We required the prisoner to demonstrate cause and

prejudice excusing the default before he could receive a
hearing on his claim, ibid., unless the prisoner could "showthat a fundamental miscarriage of justice would result from

failure to hold a federal evidentiary hearing," id., at 12.Section 2254(e)(2)'s initial inquiry into whether "the applicant has failed to develop the factual basis of a claim in State
court proceedings" echoes Keeney's language regarding "the
state prisoner's failure to develop material facts in state
court." In Keeney, the Court borrowed the cause and prejudice standard applied to procedurally defaulted claims, see
Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, 87-88 (1977), deciding
there was no reason "to distinguish between failing to properly assert a federal claim in state court and failing in state
court to properly develop such a claim." Keeney, supra, at
8. As is evident from the similarity between the Court's
phrasing in Keeney and the opening clause of $ 2254(e)(2),
Congress intended to preserve at least one aspect of
Keeney's holding: prisoners who are at fault for the deficiency in the state-court record must satisfy a heightened
standard to obtain an evidentiary hearing. To be sure, in
requiring that prisoners who have not been diligent satisfy

$ 2254(e)(2)'s provisions rather than show cause and prejudice, and in eliminating a freestanding "miscarriage of justice" exception, Congress raised the bar Keeney imposed on
prisoners who were not diligent in state-court proceedings.
Contrary to the Commonwealth's position, however, there is
no basis in the text of $ 2254(e)(2) to believe Congress used
"fail" in a different sense than the Court did in Keeney or
otherwise intended the statute's further, more stringent requirements to control the availability of an evidentiary hear529US2 Unit: $U47 [10-04-01 09:34:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN
434 WILLIAMS v. TAYLOR

Opinion of the Court
ing in a broader class of cases than were covered by Keeney'scause and prejudice standard.

In sum, the opening clause of $ 2254(e)(2) codifies Keeney'sthreshold standard of diligence, so that prisoners who would
have had to satisfy Keeney's test for excusing the deficiencyin the state-court record prior to AEDPA are now controlled
by $ 2254(e)(2). When the words of the Court are used in a
later statute governing the same subject matter, it is re-spectful of Congress and of the Court's own processes to give

the words the same meaning in the absence of specific direc-tion to the contrary. See

Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U. S. 575,
581 (1978) ("[W]here . . . Congress adopts a new law incorporating sections of a prior law, Congress normally can be presumed to have had knowledge of the interpretation given to
the incorporated law, at least insofar as it affects the new
statute"). See also Cottage Savings Assn. v. Commissioner,
499 U. S. 554, 562 (1991).

Interpreting $ 2254(e)(2) so that "failed" requires lack of
diligence or some other fault avoids putting it in needless
tension with $ 2254(d). A prisoner who developed his claim
in state court and can prove the state court's decision was
"contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of,
clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States," is not barred from obtaining relief by $ 2254(d)(1). See Williams v. Taylor, ante,
at 412-413 (majority opinion). If the opening clause of

$ 2254(e)(2) covers a request for an evidentiary hearing on a
claim which was pursued with diligence but remained undeveloped in state court because, for instance, the prosecution
concealed the facts, a prisoner lacking clear and convincing
evidence of innocence could be barred from a hearing on
the claim even if he could satisfy $ 2254(d). See 28 U. S. C.

$ 2254(e)(2)(B). The "failed to develop" clause does not bear
this harsh reading, which would attribute to Congress a purpose or design to bar evidentiary hearings for diligent prisoners with meritorious claims just because the prosecution's

Opinion of the Court
conduct went undetected in state court. We see no indica-tion that Congress by this language intended to remove the

distinction between a prisoner who is at fault and one whois not.

The Commonwealth argues a reading of "failed to de-velop" premised on fault empties $ 2254(e)(2)(A)(ii) of its
meaning. To treat the prisoner's lack of diligence in state
court as a prerequisite for application of $ 2254(e)(2), theCommonwealth contends, renders a nullity of the statute's

own diligence provision requiring the prisoner to show "afactual predicate [of his claim] could not have been previously discovered through the exercise of due diligence."

$ 2254(e)(2)(A)(ii). We disagree.

The Commonwealth misconceives the inquiry mandated
by the opening clause of $ 2254(e)(2). The question is not
whether the facts could have been discovered but instead
whether the prisoner was diligent in his efforts. The purpose of the fault component of "failed" is to ensure the prisoner undertakes his own diligent search for evidence. Diligence for purposes of the opening clause depends upon
whether the prisoner made a reasonable attempt, in light of
the information available at the time, to investigate and pursue claims in state court; it does not depend, as the Commonwealth would have it, upon whether those efforts could have
been successful. Though lack of diligence will not bar an
evidentiary hearing if efforts to discover the facts would
have been in vain, see $ 2254(e)(2)(A)(ii), and there is a convincing claim of innocence, see $ 2254(e)(2)(B), only a prisoner
who has neglected his rights in state court need satisfy these
conditions. The statute's later reference to diligence pertains to cases in which the facts could not have been discovered, whether there was diligence or not. In this important respect $ 2254(e)(2)(A)(ii) bears a close resemblance to
(e)(2)(A)(i), which applies to a new rule that was not available
at the time of the earlier proceedings. Cf. Gutierrez v. Ada,
528 U. S. 250, 255 (2000) ("[W]ords and people are known by

529US2 Unit: $U47 [10-04-01 09:34:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN
436 WILLIAMS v. TAYLOR

Opinion of the Court
their companions"). Cf. also United States v. Locke, ante, at105. In these two parallel provisions Congress has given

prisoners who fall within $ 2254(e)(2)'s opening clause an op-portunity to obtain an evidentiary hearing where the legal
or factual basis of the claims did not exist at the time ofstate-court proceedings.

We are not persuaded by the Commonwealth's further argument that anything less than a no-fault understanding ofthe opening clause is contrary to AEDPA's purpose to further the principles of comity, finality, and federalism. Thereis no doubt Congress intended AEDPA to advance these doctrines. Federal habeas corpus principles must inform and
shape the historic and still vital relation of mutual respect
and common purpose existing between the States and the
federal courts. In keeping this delicate balance we have
been careful to limit the scope of federal intrusion into state
criminal adjudications and to safeguard the States' interest
in the integrity of their criminal and collateral proceedings.
See, e. g., Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 726 (1991)
("This is a case about federalism. It concerns the respect
that federal courts owe the States and the States' procedural
rules when reviewing the claims of state prisoners in federal
habeas corpus"); McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467, 493 (1991)
("[T]he doctrines of procedural default and abuse of the writ
are both designed to lessen the injury to a State that results
through reexamination of a state conviction on a ground that
the State did not have the opportunity to address at a prior,
appropriate time; and both doctrines seek to vindicate the
State's interest in the finality of its criminal judgments").

It is consistent with these principles to give effect to Congress' intent to avoid unneeded evidentiary hearings in federal habeas corpus, while recognizing the statute does not
equate prisoners who exercise diligence in pursuing their
claims with those who do not. Principles of exhaustion are
premised upon recognition by Congress and the Court that
state judiciaries have the duty and competence to vindicate

529US2 Unit: $U47 [10-04-01 09:34:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
rights secured by the Constitution in state criminal proceed-ings. Diligence will require in the usual case that the prisoner, at a minimum, seek an evidentiary hearing in statecourt in the manner prescribed by state law. "Comity . . .
dictates that when a prisoner alleges that his continued con-finement for a state court conviction violates federal law, the
state courts should have the first opportunity to review thisclaim and provide any necessary relief."

O'Sullivan v.Boerckel, 526 U. S. 838, 844 (1999). For state courts to have

their rightful opportunity to adjudicate federal rights, theprisoner must be diligent in developing the record and presenting, if possible, all claims of constitutional error. If theprisoner fails to do so, himself or herself contributing to the
absence of a full and fair adjudication in state court,$ 2254(e)(2) prohibits an evidentiary hearing to develop the
relevant claims in federal court, unless the statute's otherstringent requirements are met. Federal courts sitting in
habeas are not an alternative forum for trying facts and is-sues which a prisoner made insufficient effort to pursue in
state proceedings. Yet comity is not served by saying aprisoner "has failed to develop the factual basis of a claim"
where he was unable to develop his claim in state court de-spite diligent effort. In that circumstance, an evidentiary
hearing is not barred by $ 2254(e)(2).

III
Now we apply the statutory test. If there has been nolack of diligence at the relevant stages in the state proceedings, the prisoner has not "failed to develop" the facts under$ 2254(e)(2)'s opening clause, and he will be excused from
showing compliance with the balance of the subsection's re-quirements. We find lack of diligence as to one of the three
claims but not as to the other two.

A
Petitioner did not exercise the diligence required to pre-serve the claim that nondisclosure of Cruse's psychiatric re529US2 Unit: $U47 [10-04-01 09:34:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
port was in contravention of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S.83 (1963). The report concluded Cruse "ha[d] little recollection of the [murders of the Kellers], other than vague memo-ries, as he was intoxicated with alcohol and marijuana at the
time." App. 495. The report had been prepared in Sep-tember 1993, before petitioner was tried; yet it was not mentioned by petitioner until he filed his federal habeas petitionand attached a copy of the report. Petitioner explained that
an investigator for his federal habeas counsel discovered thereport in Cruse's court file but state habeas counsel had not
seen it when he had reviewed the same file. State habeascounsel averred as follows:

"Prior to filing [petitioner's] habeas corpus petitionwith the Virginia Supreme Court, I reviewed the Cumberland County court files of [petitioner] and of his co-defendant, Jeffrey Cruse. . . . I have reviewed the
attached psychiatric evaluation of Jeffrey Cruse . . . . Ihave no recollection of seeing this report in Mr. Cruse's
court file when I examined the file. Given the contentsof the report, I am confident that I would remember it."
Id., at 625-626.
The trial court was not satisfied with this explanation for thelate discovery. Nor are we.

There are repeated references to a "psychiatric" or "men-tal health" report in a transcript of Cruse's sentencing
proceeding, a copy of which petitioner's own state habeascounsel attached to the state habeas petition he filed with
the Virginia Supreme Court. The transcript reveals thatCruse's attorney described the report with details that
should have alerted counsel to a possible Brady claim. AsCruse's attorney said:

"The psychiatric report . . . point[s] out that [Cruse] issignificantly depressed. He suffered from post traumatic stress. His symptoms include nightmares, sleep-lessness, sobbing, reddening of the face, severe depres529US2 Unit: $U47 [10-04-01 09:34:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN

sion, flash backs . . . . [T]he psychological report stateshe is overwhelmed by feelings of guilt and shame in his

actions. He is numb. He is trying to suppress his feel-ings, but when he has feelings, there is only pain and
sadness." App. 424.
The description accords with the contents of the psychiatricreport, which diagnosed Cruse as suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder:

"[Cruse] has recurrent nightmares and visualizes theface of the woman that he killed. When attempting to

describe this nightmare, he breaks openly into tears andhis face reddens. . . . He continues to feel worthless as a
person . . . . He has no hope for his future and hasbeen thinking of suicide constantly. . . . He does describe
inability to sleep, often tossing and turning, waking up,and feeling fatigued during the day. . . . He described
neurovegetative symptoms of major depression andpost-traumatic nightmares, recurrent in nature, of the
[murders]." Id., at 495-499.
The transcript put petitioner's state habeas counsel on noticeof the report's existence and possible materiality. The sole

indication that counsel made some effort to investigate thereport is an October 30, 1995, letter to the prosecutor in
which counsel requested "[a]ll reports of physical and mentalexaminations, scientific tests, or experiments conducted in
connection with the investigation of the offense, includingbut not limited to: . . . [a]ll psychological test or polygraph
examinations performed upon any prosecution witness andall documents referring or relating to such tests . . . ." Id.,
at 346-347. After the prosecution declined the requests ab-sent a court order, id., at 353, it appears counsel made no
further efforts to find the specific report mentioned byCruse's attorney. Given knowledge of the report's existence
and potential importance, a diligent attorney would havedone more. Counsel's failure to investigate these references

Opinion of the Court
in anything but a cursory manner triggers the opening clauseof $ 2254(e)(2).

As we hold there was a failure to develop the factual basisof this Brady claim in state court, we must determine if the
requirements in the balance of $ 2254(e)(2) are satisfied sothat petitioner's failure is excused. Subparagraph (B) of

$ 2254(e)(2) conditions a hearing upon a showing, by clear andconvincing evidence, that no reasonable factfinder would
have found petitioner guilty of capital murder but for thealleged constitutional error. Petitioner concedes he cannot
make this showing, see Brief for Petitioner 25, and the casehas been presented to us on that premise. For these reasons, we affirm the Court of Appeals' judgment barring anevidentiary hearing on this claim.

B
We conclude petitioner has met the burden of showing hewas diligent in efforts to develop the facts supporting his

juror bias and prosecutorial misconduct claims in collateralproceedings before the Virginia Supreme Court.

Petitioner's claims are based on two of the questions posedto the jurors by the trial judge at

voir dire. First, the judgeasked prospective jurors, "Are any of you related to the following people who may be called as witnesses?" Then heread the jurors a list of names, one of which was "Deputy
Sheriff Claude Meinhard." Bonnie Stinnett, who wouldlater become the jury foreperson, had divorced Meinhard in
1979, after a 17-year marriage with four children. Stinnettremained silent, indicating the answer was "no." Meinhard,
as the officer who investigated the crime scene and interro-gated Cruse, would later become the prosecution's lead-off
witness at trial.After reading the names of the attorneys involved in the
case, including one of the prosecutors, Robert Woodson, Jr.,the judge asked, "Have you or any member of your immediate family ever been represented by any of the aforemen529US2 Unit: $U47 [10-04-01 09:34:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN

441Cite as: 529 U. S. 420 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
tioned attorneys?" Stinnett again said nothing, despite thefact Woodson had represented her during her divorce from

Meinhard. App. 483, 485.In an affidavit she provided in the federal habeas proceedings, Stinnett claimed "[she] did not respond to the judge's[first] question because [she] did not consider [herself] `related' to Claude Meinhard in 1994 [at voir dire] . . . . Once
our marriage ended in 1979, I was no longer related to him."
Id., at 627. As for Woodson's earlier representation of her,
Stinnett explained as follows:

"When Claude and I divorced in 1979, the divorce wasuncontested and Mr. Woodson drew up the papers so

that the divorce could be completed. Since neither
Claude nor I was contesting anything, I didn't think Mr.Woodson `represented' either one of us."

Id., at 628.

Woodson provided an affidavit in which he admitted "[he]
was aware that Juror Bonnie Stinnett was the ex-wife ofthen Deputy Sheriff Claude Meinhard and [he] was aware

that they had been divorced for some time." Id., at 629.Woodson stated, however, "[t]o [his] mind, people who are
related only by marriage are no longer `related' once the
marriage ends in divorce." Ibid. Woodson also "had norecollection of having been involved as a private attorney in

the divorce proceedings between Claude Meinhard and Bon-nie Stinnett."

Id., at 629-630. He explained that "[w]hatever [his] involvement was in the 1979 divorce, by the timeof trial in 1994 [he] had completely forgotten about it."

Id.,
at 630.Even if Stinnett had been correct in her technical or literal

interpretation of the question relating to Meinhard, her silence after the first question was asked could suggest to the
finder of fact an unwillingness to be forthcoming; this in turn
could bear on the veracity of her explanation for not disclosing that Woodson had been her attorney. Stinnett's failure
to divulge material information in response to the second

529US2 Unit: $U47 [10-04-01 09:34:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN
442 WILLIAMS v. TAYLOR

Opinion of the Court
question was misleading as a matter of fact because, underany interpretation, Woodson had acted as counsel to her and

Meinhard in their divorce. Coupled with Woodson's ownreticence, these omissions as a whole disclose the need for an
evidentiary hearing. It may be that petitioner could estab-lish that Stinnett was not impartial, see

Smith v. Phillips,
455 U. S. 209, 217, 219-221 (1982), or that Woodson's silence
so infected the trial as to deny due process, see Donnelly v.
DeChristoforo, 416 U. S. 637, 647-648 (1974).

In ordering an evidentiary hearing on the juror bias andprosecutorial misconduct claims, the District Court concluded the factual basis of the claims was not reasonably
available to petitioner's counsel during state habeas proceedings. After the Court of Appeals vacated this judgment,
the District Court dismissed the petition and the Court of
Appeals affirmed under the theory that state habeas counsel
should have discovered Stinnett's relationship to Meinhard
and Woodson. See 189 F. 3d, at 428.

We disagree with the Court of Appeals on this point. The
trial record contains no evidence which would have put a
reasonable attorney on notice that Stinnett's nonresponse
was a deliberate omission of material information. State
habeas counsel did attempt to investigate petitioner's jury,
though prompted by concerns about a different juror. App.
388-389. Counsel filed a motion for expert services with
the Virginia Supreme Court, alleging "irregularities, improprieties and omissions exist[ed] with respect to the empaneling [sic] of the jury." Id., at 358. Based on these suspicions, counsel requested funding for an investigator "to
examine all circumstances relating to the empanelment of
the jury and the jury's consideration of the case." Ibid.
The Commonwealth opposed the motion, and the Virginia
Supreme Court denied it and dismissed the habeas petition,
depriving petitioner of a further opportunity to investigate.
The Virginia Supreme Court's denial of the motion is understandable in light of petitioner's vague allegations, but the

529US2 Unit: $U47 [10-04-01 09:34:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN

443Cite as: 529 U. S. 420 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
vagueness was not the fault of petitioner. Counsel had noreason to believe Stinnett had been married to Meinhard or

been represented by Woodson. The underdevelopment ofthese matters was attributable to Stinnett and Woodson, if
anyone. We do not suggest the State has an obligation topay for investigation of as yet undeveloped claims; but if the
prisoner has made a reasonable effort to discover the claims
to commence or continue state proceedings, $ 2254(e)(2) willnot bar him from developing them in federal court.

The Court of Appeals held state habeas counsel was notdiligent because petitioner's investigator on federal habeas
discovered the relationships upon interviewing two jurors
who referred in passing to Stinnett as "Bonnie Meinhard."
See Brief for Petitioner 35. The investigator later confirmed Stinnett's prior marriage to Meinhard by checking
Cumberland County's public records. See 189 F. 3d, at 426
("The documents supporting [petitioner's] Sixth Amendment
claims have been a matter of public record since Stinnett's
divorce became final in 1979. Indeed, because [petitioner's]
federal habeas counsel located those documents, there is little reason to think that his state habeas counsel could not
have done so as well"). We should be surprised, to say the
least, if a district court familiar with the standards of trial
practice were to hold that in all cases diligent counsel must
check public records containing personal information pertaining to each and every juror. Because of Stinnett and
Woodson's silence, there was no basis for an investigation
into Stinnett's marriage history. Section 2254(e)(2) does not
apply to petitioner's related claims of juror bias and prosecutorial misconduct.

We further note the Commonwealth has not argued that

pointment of state habeas counsel to file a petition with the
Virginia Supreme Court. Va. Code Ann. $ 8.01-654.1 (1999).
State habeas counsel was appointed on August 10, 1995,
about a year before petitioner's investigator on federal habeas uncovered the information regarding Stinnett and
Woodson. As state postconviction relief was no longer
available at the time the facts came to light, it would have
been futile for petitioner to return to the Virginia courts.
In these circumstances, though the state courts did not have
an opportunity to consider the new claims, petitioner cannot
be said to have failed to develop them in state court by reason of having neglected to pursue remedies available under
Virginia law.

Our analysis should suffice to establish cause for any procedural default petitioner may have committed in not presenting these claims to the Virginia courts in the first instance. Questions regarding the standard for determining
the prejudice that petitioner must establish to obtain relief
on these claims can be addressed by the Court of Appeals or
the District Court in the course of further proceedings.
These courts, in light of cases such as Smith, supra, at 215
("[T]he remedy for allegations of juror partiality is a hearing
in which the defendant has the opportunity to prove actual
bias"), will take due account of the District Court's earlier
decision to grant an evidentiary hearing based in part on
its belief that "Juror Stinnett deliberately failed to tell the
truth on voir dire." Williams v. Netherland, Civ. Action

Petitioner alleges the Commonwealth failed to disclose an
informal plea agreement with Cruse. The Court of Appeals
rejected this claim on the merits under $ 2254(d)(1), so it is
unnecessary to reach the question whether $ 2254(e)(2) would
permit a hearing on the claim.

EDWARDS, WARDEN v. CARPENTER
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe sixth circuit

No. 98-2060. Argued February 28, 2000--Decided April 25, 2000
Respondent pleaded guilty while maintaining his innocence to Ohio murder and robbery charges in exchange for the prosecutor's agreement
that the plea could be withdrawn if the death penalty was imposed.
The Ohio Court of Appeals affirmed his conviction and sentence of imprisonment, and he did not appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court. After
pursuing state postconviction relief pro se, respondent, represented by
new counsel, petitioned the Ohio Court of Appeals to reopen his direct
appeal, claiming that his original appellate counsel was constitutionally
ineffective in failing to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his conviction and sentence. The court dismissed the application as untimely under Ohio Rule of Appellate Procedure 26(B), and the
Ohio Supreme Court affirmed. Respondent then filed a federal habeas
petition, raising, inter alia, the sufficiency-of-the-evidence claim, and
alleging that his appellate counsel was constitutionally ineffective in
not raising that claim on direct appeal. The District Court found that
his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim was cause excusing the procedural default of his sufficiency-of-the-evidence claim because Rule 26(B)
was not an adequate procedural ground to bar federal review of the
ineffective-assistance claim; concluded that respondent's appellate counsel was constitutionally ineffective; and granted the writ conditioned on
the state appellate court's reopening of respondent's direct appeal of the
sufficiency-of-the-evidence claim. On cross-appeals, the Sixth Circuit
held that the ineffective-assistance claim served as cause to excuse the
default of the sufficiency-of-the-evidence claim, whether or not the former claim had been procedurally defaulted, because respondent had
exhausted the ineffective-assistance claim by presenting it to the state
courts in his application to reopen the direct appeal. Finding prejudice from counsel's failure to raise the sufficiency-of-the-evidence claim
on direct appeal, it directed the District Court to issue the writ conditioned upon the state court's according respondent a new culpability
hearing.

Held: A procedurally defaulted ineffective-assistance claim can serve as

cause to excuse the procedural default of another habeas claim only if
the habeas petitioner can satisfy the "cause and prejudice" standard
with respect to the ineffective-assistance claim itself. The procedural

default doctrine and its attendant "cause and prejudice" standard are
grounded in comity and federalism concerns, Coleman v. Thompson,

appeal, or on state collateral attack, Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478,

default of any federal claim, and prejudice therefrom, before the federal habeas court will consider that claim's merits. 501 U. S., at 750.
Counsel's ineffectiveness in failing properly to preserve a claim for
state-court review will suffice as cause, but only if that ineffectiveness
itself constitutes an independent constitutional claim. Carrier, supra,
at 488-499. The comity and federalism principles underlying the doctrine of exhaustion of state remedies require an ineffective-assistance
claim to be presented to the state courts as an independent claim before
it may be used to establish cause for a procedural default. Carrier,
supra, at 489. The doctrine's purposes would be frustrated if federal
review were available to a prisoner who had presented his claim in state
court, but in such a manner that the state court could not, under its
procedural rules, have entertained it. Pp. 450-454.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case presents the question whether a federal habeascourt is barred from considering an ineffective-assistanceof-counsel claim as "cause" for the procedural default of an-other claim when the ineffective-assistance claim has itself
been procedurally defaulted.

I
Respondent was indicted by an Ohio grand jury for aggra-vated murder and aggravated robbery. He entered a guilty

plea while maintaining his innocence--a procedure we heldto be constitutional in

North Carolina v. Alford, 400 U. S.25 (1970)--in exchange for the prosecution's agreement that

the guilty plea could be withdrawn if the three-judge panelthat accepted it elected, after a mitigation hearing, to impose the death penalty. The panel accepted respondent'splea based on the prosecution's recitation of the evidence
supporting the charges and, following a mitigation hearing,sentenced him to life imprisonment with parole eligibility
after 30 years on the aggravated-murder count and to a con-current term of 10 to 25 years on the aggravated-robbery
count. On direct appeal respondent, represented by newcounsel, assigned only the single error that the evidence
offered in mitigation established that he should have been

Opinion of the Court
eligible for parole after 20 rather than 30 years. The OhioCourt of Appeals affirmed, and respondent did not appeal

to the Ohio Supreme Court.After unsuccessfully pursuing state postconviction relief
pro se, respondent, again represented by new counsel, filedan application in the Ohio Court of Appeals to reopen his
direct appeal, pursuant to Ohio Rule of Appellate Proce-dure 26(B),

1 on the ground that his original appellate counsel was constitutionally ineffective in failing to raise on di-rect appeal a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence.

The appellate court dismissed the application because re-spondent had failed to show, as the rule required, good cause
for filing after the 90-day period allowed.2 The Ohio Su-preme Court, in a one-sentence

per curiam opinion, affirmed.State v. Carpenter, 74 Ohio St. 3d 408, 659 N. E. 2d 786 (1996).

On May 3, 1996, respondent filed a petition for writ of ha-beas corpus in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of Ohio, alleging, inter alia, that the evidence supporting his plea and sentence was insufficient, inviolation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, and

that his appellate counsel was constitutionally ineffectivein failing to raise that claim on direct appeal. Concluding
that respondent's sufficiency-of-the-evidence claim was pro-cedurally defaulted, the District Court considered next
whether the ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim could

"(1) A defendant in a criminal case may apply for reopening of the appeal from the judgment of conviction and sentence, based on a claim of
ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. An application for reopening
shall be filed in the court of appeals where the appeal was decided within
ninety days from journalization of the appellate judgment unless the applicant shows good cause for filing at a later time."

2 Respondent filed his application to reopen on July 15, 1994. Although

Rule 26(B) did not become effective until July 1, 1993, more than two years
after respondent's direct appeal was completed, the Court of Appeals considered respondent's time for filing to have begun on the Rule's effective
date and to have expired 90 days thereafter.

Opinion of the Court
serve as cause excusing that default. The District Courtacknowledged that the ineffective-assistance claim had been

dismissed on procedural grounds, but concluded that Rule26(B)'s inconsistent application by the Ohio courts rendered
it inadequate to bar federal habeas review. See Ford v.Georgia, 498 U. S. 411, 423-424 (1991) (state procedural default is not an "independent and adequate state ground"barring subsequent federal review unless the state rule was
" `firmly established and regularly followed' " at the time itwas applied). Proceeding to the merits of the ineffectiveassistance claim, the District Court concluded that respond-ent's appellate counsel was constitutionally ineffective under
the test established in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S.668 (1984), and granted the writ of habeas corpus conditioned on the state appellate court's reopening of respond-ent's direct appeal of the sufficiency-of-the-evidence claim.

On cross-appeals, the United States Court of Appealsfor the Sixth Circuit held that respondent's ineffectiveassistance-of-counsel claim served as "cause" to excuse theprocedural default of his sufficiency-of-the-evidence claim,
whether or not the ineffective-assistance claim itself hadbeen procedurally defaulted. Carpenter v. Mohr, 163 F. 3d
938 (CA6 1998). In the panel's view, it sufficed that re-spondent had exhausted the ineffective-assistance claim by
presenting it to the state courts in his application to re-open the direct appeal, even though that application might,
under Ohio law, have been time barred. Finding in addi-tion prejudice from counsel's failure to raise the sufficiencyof-the-evidence claim on direct appeal, the Sixth Circuit di-rected the District Court to issue the writ of habeas corpus
conditioned upon the state court's according respondent anew culpability hearing. We granted certiorari. 528 U. S.
985 (1999). II

Petitioner contends that the Sixth Circuit erred in fail-ing to recognize that a procedurally defaulted ineffective529US2 Unit: $U48 [09-26-01 10:25:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
assistance-of-counsel claim can serve as cause to excuse theprocedural default of another habeas claim only if the habeas petitioner can satisfy the "cause and prejudice" stand-ard with respect to the ineffective-assistance claim itself.
We agree.The procedural default doctrine and its attendant "cause
and prejudice" standard are "grounded in concerns of comity
and federalism," Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 730(1991), and apply alike whether the default in question occurred at trial, on appeal, or on state collateral attack, Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478, 490-492 (1986). "[A] habeas
petitioner who has failed to meet the State's procedural requirements for presenting his federal claims has deprived
the state courts of an opportunity to address those claims in
the first instance." Coleman, 501 U. S., at 732. We therefore require a prisoner to demonstrate cause for his statecourt default of any federal claim, and prejudice therefrom,
before the federal habeas court will consider the merits of
that claim. Id., at 750. The one exception to that rule, not
at issue here, is the circumstance in which the habeas petitioner can demonstrate a sufficient probability that our failure to review his federal claim will result in a fundamental
miscarriage of justice. Ibid.

Although we have not identified with precision exactly
what constitutes "cause" to excuse a procedural default,
we have acknowledged that in certain circumstances counsel's ineffectiveness in failing properly to preserve the claim
for review in state court will suffice. Carrier, 477 U. S., at
488-489. Not just any deficiency in counsel's performance
will do, however; the assistance must have been so ineffective as to violate the Federal Constitution. Ibid. In other
words, ineffective assistance adequate to establish cause
for the procedural default of some other constitutional claim
is itself an independent constitutional claim. And we held
in Carrier that the principles of comity and federalism
that underlie our longstanding exhaustion doctrine--then as

Opinion of the Court
now codified in the federal habeas statute, see 28 U. S. C.

$$ 2254(b), (c)--require that constitutional claim, like others,
to be first raised in state court. "[A] claim of ineffective
assistance," we said, generally must "be presented to the
state courts as an independent claim before it may be used
to establish cause for a procedural default." Carrier, supra,
at 489.

The question raised by the present case is whether Carrier's exhaustion requirement for claims of ineffective assistance asserted as cause is uniquely immune from the
procedural-default rule that accompanies the exhaustion requirement in all other contexts--whether, in other words, it
suffices that the ineffective-assistance claim was "presented"
to the state courts, even though it was not presented in the
manner that state law requires. That is not a hard question.
An affirmative answer would render Carrier's exhaustion
requirement illusory.3

We recognized the inseparability of the exhaustion rule
and the procedural-default doctrine in Coleman: "In the
absence of the independent and adequate state ground doctrine in federal habeas, habeas petitioners would be able to
avoid the exhaustion requirement by defaulting their federal
claims in state court. The independent and adequate state

3 Last Term, in a per curiam summary reversal, we clearly expressed
the view that a habeas petitioner must satisfy the "cause and prejudice"
standard before his procedurally defaulted ineffective-assistance claim
will excuse the default of another claim. Stewart v. LaGrand, 526 U. S.
115, 120 (1999). Respondent contends that we are not bound by LaGrand
because in that case the habeas petitioner had waived his ineffectiveassistance claim in the District Court, thereby rendering our procedural
default discussion dicta, and because, in any event, per curiam opinions
decided without the benefit of full briefing or oral argument are of little
precedential value. Whether our procedural default analysis in LaGrand
is properly characterized as dictum or as alternative holding, and whatever the precedential value of a per curiam opinion, the ease with which
we so recently resolved this identical question reflects the degree to which
the proper resolution flows irresistibly from our precedents.

Opinion of the Court
ground doctrine ensures that the States' interest in correct-ing their own mistakes is respected in all federal habeas

cases." 501 U. S., at 732. We again considered the inter-play between exhaustion and procedural default last Term in
O'Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U. S. 838 (1999), concluding thatthe latter doctrine was necessary to " `protect the integrity'
of the federal exhaustion rule." Id., at 848 (quoting id., at
853 (Stevens, J., dissenting)). The purposes of the exhaus-tion requirement, we said, would be utterly defeated if the

prisoner were able to obtain federal habeas review simplyby " `letting the time run' " so that state remedies were no
longer available. Id., at 848. Those purposes would be no
less frustrated were we to allow federal review to a prisoner
who had presented his claim to the state court, but in such a
manner that the state court could not, consistent with its
own procedural rules, have entertained it. In such circumstances, though the prisoner would have "concededly exhausted his state remedies," it could hardly be said that, as
comity and federalism require, the State had been given a
"fair `opportunity to pass upon [his claims].' " Id., at 854
(Stevens, J., dissenting) (emphasis added) (quoting Darr v.
Burford, 339 U. S. 200, 204 (1950)).

To hold, as we do, that an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel
claim asserted as cause for the procedural default of another claim can itself be procedurally defaulted is not to say
that that procedural default may not itself be excused if
the prisoner can satisfy the cause-and-prejudice standard
with respect to that claim. Indeed, the Sixth Circuit may
well conclude on remand that respondent can meet that
standard in this case (although we should note that respondent has not argued that he can, preferring instead to argue
that he does not have to). Or it may conclude, as did the
District Court, that Ohio Rule of Appellate Procedure 26(B)
does not constitute an adequate procedural ground to bar
federal habeas review of the ineffective-assistance claim.
We express no view as to these issues, or on the question

Breyer, J., concurring in judgment
whether respondent's appellate counsel was constitutionallyineffective in not raising the sufficiency-of-the-evidence claim

in the first place. * * *

For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court ofAppeals for the Sixth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.
Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Stevens joins,concurring in the judgment.

I believe the Court of Appeals correctly decided the basicquestion: "Whether a federal habeas court is barred from
considering an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim as`cause' for the procedural default of another claim when
the ineffective-assistance claim is itself procedurally de-faulted." The question's phrasing itself reveals my basic
concern. Although the question, like the majority's opin-ion, is written with clarity, few lawyers, let alone unrepresented state prisoners, will readily understand it. Thereason lies in the complexity of this Court's habeas corpus
jurisprudence--a complexity that in practice can deny thefundamental constitutional protection that habeas corpus
seeks to assure. Today's decision unnecessarily adds to thatcomplexity and cannot be reconciled with our consistent recognition that the determination of "cause" is a matter for thefederal habeas judge.

To explain why this is so, and at the risk of oversimplifi-cation, I must reiterate certain elementary ground rules. A
federal judge may issue a writ of habeas corpus freeing astate prisoner, if the prisoner is "in custody in violation of
the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States."28 U. S. C. $ 2254(a). However, the judge may not issue the
writ if an adequate and independent state-law ground justi-fies the prisoner's detention, regardless of the federal claim.

Breyer, J., concurring in judgment
See Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, 81-88 (1977). One"state ground" often asserted as an adequate, independent

basis for holding a state prisoner in custody is a state-law"procedural default," such as the prisoner's failure to raise
his federal claim at the proper time. However, under cer-tain conditions the State's assertion of such a ground is
not "adequate" (and consequently does not bar assertion of
the federal-law claim). There are three situations in whichan otherwise valid state ground will not bar federal claims:

(1) where failure to consider a prisoner's claims will resultin a "fundamental miscarriage of justice,"

Coleman v.
Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 750 (1991); (2) where the state
procedural rule was not " `firmly established and regularly
followed,' " Ford v. Georgia, 498 U. S. 411, 423-424 (1991);
James v. Kentucky, 466 U. S. 341, 348-349 (1984); and
(3) where the prisoner had good "cause" for not following
the state procedural rule and was "prejudice[d]" by not
having done so, Sykes, supra, at 87.

Ordinarily, a federal habeas judge, while looking to state
law to determine the potential existence of a procedural
ground that might bar consideration of the prisoner's federal claim, decides whether such a ground is adequate as a
matter of federal law. See Ford, supra; James, supra; Coleman, supra. Thus the Court has applied federal standards
to determine whether there has been a "fundamental miscarriage of justice." See, e. g., Schlup v. Delo, 513 U. S. 298,
314-317 (1995). And the Court has also looked to state
practice to determine the factual circumstances surrounding the application of a state procedural rule, while determining as a matter of federal law whether that rule is "firmly
established [and] regularly followed." Ford, supra, at 424-
425. Federal habeas courts would normally determine
whether "cause and prejudice" excuse a "procedural default"
in the same manner. Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478, 489
(1986) ("[T]he question of cause" is "a question of federal
law").

456 EDWARDS v. CARPENTER

Breyer, J., concurring in judgment
If I could stop here, the rules would be complicated, butstill comprehensible. The federal habeas judge would look

to state law and state practice to determine the facts andcircumstances surrounding a state procedural rule that the
State claims is an "adequate and independent state ground."However, the federal judge would determine the adequacy
of that "state ground" as a matter of federal law.

Unfortunately, the rules have become even more com-plex. In

Carrier, the Court considered a prisoner's contention that he had "cause" for failing to follow a state proce-dural rule--a rule that would have barred his federal claim.

The "cause," in the prisoner's view, was that his lawyer (whohad failed to follow the state procedural rule) had performed
inadequately. This Court determined, as a matter of federallaw, that only a performance so inadequate that it violated
the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to effective assist-ance of counsel could amount to "cause" sufficient to overcome a "procedural default." Id., at 488-489. That beingso, the Court reasoned, the prisoner should have to exhaust
the ineffectiveness claim in state court. The Court wrote:

"[I]f a petitioner could raise his ineffective assistance
claim for the first time on federal habeas in order to
show cause for a procedural default, the federal habeas
court would find itself in the anomalous position of adjudicating an unexhausted constitutional claim for which
state court review might still be available." Id., at 489.

And today the Court holds not only that the prisoner must
exhaust this claim by presenting it to the state courts, but
also that his failure to do so properly, i. e., a failure to comply
with the State's rules for doing so, bars that prisoner from
ever asserting that claim as a "cause" for not having complied with state procedural rules.

The opinion in Carrier raises a special kind of "exhaustion" problem. The Court considered a type of "cause" ("in529US2 Unit: $U48 [09-26-01 10:25:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN

457Cite as: 529 U. S. 446 (2000)
Breyer, J., concurring in judgment
effective assistance") for not following the state procedural
rule that happened itself independently to constitute a violation of the Federal Constitution. After all, were the prisoner to prove his claim (i. e., show "ineffective assistance"),
the State might want to take action first. Ordinary exhaustion rules assure States an initial opportunity to pass upon
claims of violation of the Federal Constitution. Why should
a State not have a similar opportunity in this situation? As
the Carrier Court pointed out, it would be "anomalous" for
a federal habeas court to "adjudicat[e] an unexhausted constitutional claim for which state court review might still be
available." Ibid.

The anomaly disappears, however, once the prisoner has
exhausted his "ineffective-assistance" claim (which appeared
in the guise of a "cause"). And there is no other anomaly
that requires the majority's result. Once a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel has been exhausted--either
through presentation in the state courts or through procedural default--there is no difference between that claim
and any other claim of "cause" for the prisoner's original
procedural default. The federal habeas court is no longer
in the "anomalous position" of considering as cause an independent claim that might yet be considered by the state
courts, for there is no longer any possibility that the state
courts will consider the claim. There is thus no more reason
to hold that procedural default of an ineffective-assistance
claim bars the prisoner from raising that ineffectiveassistance claim as a "cause" (excusing a different procedural default asserted as a bar to a basic constitutional claim)
than there is to bar any other claim of "cause" on grounds
of procedural default. The majority creates an anomaly; it
does not cure one.

The added complexity resulting from the Court's opinion is
obvious. Consider a prisoner who wants to assert a federal
constitutional claim (call it FCC). Suppose the State asserts

529US2 Unit: $U48 [09-26-01 10:25:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN
458 EDWARDS v. CARPENTER

Breyer, J., concurring in judgment
as a claimed "adequate and independent state ground" theprisoner's failure to raise the matter on his first state-court

appeal. Suppose further that the prisoner replies by alleg-ing that he had "cause" for not raising the matter on appeal
(call it C). After Carrier, if that alleged "cause" (C) consistsof the claim "my attorney was constitutionally ineffective,"
the prisoner must have exhausted C in the state courts first.
And after today, if he did not follow state rules for present-ing C to the state courts, he will have lost his basic claim,

FCC, forever. But, I overstate. According to the opinionof the Court, he will not necessarily have lost FCC forever
if he had "cause" for not having followed those state rules
(i. e., the rules for determining the existence of "cause" for
not having followed the state rules governing the basic
claim, FCC) (call this "cause" C*). Ante, at 453. The prisoner could therefore still obtain relief if he could demonstrate the merits of C*, C, and FCC.

I concede that this system of rules has a certain logic, indeed an attractive power for those who like difficult puzzles.
But I believe it must succumb to this question: Why should
a prisoner, who may well be proceeding pro se, lose his basic
claim because he runs afoul of state procedural rules governing the presentation to state courts of the "cause" for
his not having followed state procedural rules for the presentation of his basic federal claim? And, in particular,
why should that special default rule apply when the "cause"
at issue is an "ineffective-assistance-of-counsel" claim, but
not when it is any of the many other "causes" or circumstances that might excuse a failure to comply with state
rules? I can find no satisfactory answer to these questions.

I agree with the majority, however, that this case must be
returned to the Court of Appeals. Although the prisoner's
"ineffective-assistance" claim is not barred, he still must
prove that the "assistance" he received was "ineffective"
(or some other "cause"). And, if he does so, he still must
prove his basic claim that his trial violated the Federal Con529US2 Unit: $U48 [09-26-01 10:25:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN

NELSON v. ADAMS USA, INC., et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe federal circuit

No. 99-502. Argued March 27, 2000--Decided April 25, 2000
Ohio Cellular Products Corporation (OCP) sued respondent Adams USA,

Inc. (Adams), for patent infringement. The District Court dismissed
OCP's claim and ordered OCP to pay Adams' costs and attorney fees.
In awarding costs and fees, the court determined that petitioner Nelson,
president and sole shareholder of OCP, had deceitfully withheld from
the United States Patent and Trademark Office prior art that rendered OCP's patents invalid, and that this behavior constituted inequitable conduct chargeable to OCP. Fearing that OCP might be unable
to pay the fee, Adams moved under Rule 15 of the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure to amend its pleading to add Nelson, personally, as a
party from whom fees could be collected. Adams also asked the
court, under Rule 59(e), to amend the judgment to make Nelson immediately liable for the fee award. The District Court granted Adams'
motion in full. In affirming the judgment entered against Nelson, the
Federal Circuit acknowledged that it was "uncommon" to add a party
after the entry of judgment. Nevertheless, Nelson had not demonstrated prejudice, the Court of Appeals concluded, because he made no
showing that anything different or additional would have been done to
stave off the judgment had he been a party, in his individual capacity,
from the outset. That court, over a vigorous dissent, was apparently
satisfied that the District Court's simultaneous allowance of the pleading amendment and entry of judgment satisfied due process.

Held: The District Court erred in amending the judgment immediately

upon permitting amendment of the pleading. Due process, as reflected
in Rule 15 as well as Rule 12, required that Nelson be given an opportunity to respond and contest his personal liability for the fee award after
he was made a party and before the entry of judgment against him.
Pp. 465-472.

(a) Nelson was never afforded a proper opportunity to respond to the
claim against him, but was adjudged liable the very first moment his
personal liability was legally at issue. The Federal Circuit observed
that as long as no undue prejudice is shown, due process is met if
Rule 15's requirements for amended pleadings are met. But the requirements of Rule 15 were not met here, and due process does not
countenance such swift passage from pleading to judgment in the

Syllabus
pleader's favor. Because the propriety of allowing a pleading alteration depends not only on the state of affairs prior to amendment but
also on what happens afterwards, Rule 15 both conveys the circumstances under which leave to amend shall be granted and directs how
the litigation will move forward following an amendment. When a
court grants leave to amend to add an adverse party after the time for
responding to the original pleading has lapsed, Rule 15(a) gives the
party so added "10 days after service of the amended pleading" to plead
in response. This opportunity to respond, fundamental to due process,
is the echo of the opportunity to respond to original pleadings secured
under Rule 12(a)(1). Thus, Rule 15 assumes an amended pleading will
be filed and anticipates service of that pleading on the adverse party.
Nelson was never served with an amended pleading. Indeed, no such
pleading was ever actually composed and filed in court. Nor, after
the amendment joining Nelson, was he accorded time to state his defenses against personal liability for costs and fees. Instead, judgment
was entered against him the moment permission to amend the pleading was granted. Appeal after judgment, in the circumstances this
case presents, did not provide an adequate opportunity to defend against
the imposition of liability. Cf. American Surety Co. v. Baldwin, 287
U. S. 156. Nothing in the record indicates that Nelson affirmatively
relinquished his right to respond on the merits of the case belatedly
stated against him in his individual capacity. That Nelson knew as
soon as Adams moved to amend the pleading and alter the judgment
that he might ultimately be subjected to personal liability does not mean
that he in fact had a fair chance, before alteration of the judgment, to
respond and be heard. Rule 15 and the due process for which it provides demand a more reliable and orderly course. First, as Rule 15(a)
indicates, pleading in response to an amended complaint is a prerogative
of parties, and Nelson was not a party prior to the District Court's
ruling on Adams' motion to amend. Second, as Rule 15 further prescribes, the clock on an added party's time to respond does not start
running until the new pleading naming that party is served, just as the
clock on an original party's time to respond does not start running
until the original pleading is served, see Rule 12(a)(1)(A). This is not to
say that Rule 15 is itself a constitutional requirement. Beyond doubt,
however, a prospective party cannot fairly be required to answer an
amended pleading not yet permitted, framed, and served. Pp. 465-468.

(b) Adams' arguments that Nelson waived his objections to the swift
process of the District Court are rejected. First, the assertion that
Nelson waived personal jurisdiction and absence-of-service arguments
is beside the point because Nelson's winning argument is based neither
on personal jurisdiction nor on service of process. Second, the sub529US2 Unit: $U49 [10-24-00 10:29:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN

mission that Nelson waived the due process issues presented here is
unavailing because his counsel explained in the Federal Circuit that the
core of Nelson's argument was the fundamental unfairness of imposing
judgment without going through the litigation process the Rules prescribe. Further, both the majority and the dissent below understood
that an issue before them concerned the process due after Adams' postjudgment motion. Also rejected is Adams' essential position that there
was sufficient identity between Nelson and OCP to bind Nelson, without further ado, to a judgment already entered against OCP. Because
Nelson, as president and sole shareholder of OCP, had withheld prior
art from the Patent Office, had actual notice that Adams was seeking
to collect a fee award from OCP, was the "effective controller" of the
litigation for OCP, and had personally participated as a witness at the
hearing on whether OCP had engaged in inequitable conduct, the Federal Circuit concluded that nothing different or additional would have
been done had Nelson been a party from the outset. Judicial predictions about the outcome of hypothesized litigation cannot substitute for
the actual opportunity to defend that due process affords every party
against whom a claim is stated. The decision here does not insulate
Nelson from liability, but simply ensures him the right, afforded by due
process, to contest on the merits his personal liability for fees originally
sought and awarded solely against OCP. Pp. 469-472.

holder of OCP, in his individual capacity. In pursuit of thatobjective, Adams moved under Rule 15 of the Federal Rules

of Civil Procedure to amend its pleading to add Nelson as aparty; Adams also asked the court, under Rule 59(e), to
amend the fee award. The District Court granted the mo-tion in full, simultaneously making Nelson a party and subjecting him to judgment. The Court of Appeals affirmed.We hold that the District Court erred in amending the

OCP and its successor corporation held two patents re-lating to the method of manufacturing a foamed padding

used in athletic equipment. In 1994, OCP sued Adams forinfringement. Adams maintained that the patents had been
anticipated by prior art and were therefore invalid under35 U. S. C. $ 102(b). The District Court ruled in Adams'
favor and dismissed the infringement complaint.Adams then moved for attorney fees and costs. The District Court granted the motion on the ground that Nelson,who was at all relevant times president and sole shareholder
of OCP, had deceitfully withheld the prior art from theUnited States Patent and Trademark Office. This behavior,
the District Court concluded, constituted inequitable conductchargeable to OCP. On January 20, 1998, the District Court
awarded Adams costs and fees in the amount of $178,888.51against OCP.

Adams feared, however, that it would be unable to collectthe award. This was an altogether understandable concern;
it stemmed from a letter OCP's counsel had sent Adamswarning that OCP would be liquidated if exposed to a judgment for fees more than nominal in amount. Adams there529US2 Unit: $U49 [10-24-00 10:29:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN

fore moved to amend its pleading to add Nelson, personally,
as a party from whom fees could be collected. In this postjudgment endeavor, Adams reasoned that Nelson was the
flesh-and-blood party behind OCP, the person whose conduct
in withholding prior art precipitated the fee award, and a
person with funds sufficient to satisfy that award. The District Court granted the motion.

Adams' motion, however, sought more than permission to
amend the pleading. It sought simultaneously an amended
judgment, subjecting Nelson to liability as soon as he was
made a party. See Record, Doc. No. 126, p. 1 ("Defendants
[i. e., Adams] hereby move the Court . . . for an order granting Defendants leave to amend their third party complaint
to name Donald E. Nelson (Nelson) as a third party defendant in his individual capacity, and amending the judgment in
this action to include Nelson as an additional party against
whom judgment is entered."). In presenting the motion,
Adams offered no reason why the judgment should be altered immediately. See id., at 7-8. The motion did contend
that an amendment to the judgment was "necessary to prevent manifest injustice," id., at 8 (internal quotation marks
omitted), but it did not explain why Nelson, once joined as a
party, should not be permitted to state his side of that argument. The District Court seems not to have paused over
this question, for it allowed the pleading amendment and altered the judgment at a single stroke. Record, Doc. No. 131.
The memorandum explaining the District Court's decision
addressed only the propriety of adding Nelson as a party.
It did not address the propriety of altering the judgment at
the very same time. Record, Doc. No. 130, at 3-7.

The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the
amended judgment against Nelson. Ohio Cellular Prods.
Corp. v. Adams USA, Inc., 175 F. 3d 1343 (1999). It was
"uncommon," the appeals court acknowledged, to add a party
after the entry of judgment. Id., at 1348. The court con529US2 Unit: $U49 [10-24-00 10:29:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
cluded, however, that Nelson had not been prejudiced by thepostjudgment joinder. The Federal Circuit based that conclusion on Nelson's failure to show that "anything differentor additional would have been done" to stave off the judgment had Nelson been a party, in his individual capacity,from the outset of the litigation. Id., at 1351. The panel,
over a vigorous dissent by Judge Newman, was apparentlysatisfied that adding Nelson as a party and simultaneously
amending the judgment to obligate him individually met dueprocess requirements. See

id., at 1345, 1349, n. 5.We granted certiorari, 528 U. S. 1018 (1999). In his request for this Court's review, Nelson did not dispute the por-tion of the District Court's order that granted Adams leave
to amend its pleading to add Nelson as a party against whomcosts and fees were sought. Pet. for Cert. 11. What he
does challenge, and what is now before us, is the portion ofthe District Court's order that immediately adjudged Nelson
personally liable the moment he was made a party.

A

The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are designed to fur-ther the due process of law that the Constitution guarantees.

Cf. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 1 (Rules "shall be construed andadministered to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive
determination of every action."). Rule 15 sets out the re-quirements for amended and supplemental pleadings. On
that score, the Court of Appeals observed that as long asno undue prejudice is shown, "due process requirements
are met if the requirements of Rule 15 are met." 175 F. 3d,at 1349, n. 5. But in the instant case, the requirements of
Rule 15 were not met. As Judge Newman recognized in herdissent below, due process does not countenance such swift
passage from pleading to judgment in the pleader's favor.See

id., at 1352.

Opinion of the Court
The propriety of allowing a pleading alteration dependsnot only on the state of affairs prior to amendment but also

on what happens afterwards. Accordingly, Rule 15 bothconveys the circumstances under which leave to amend
shall be granted and directs how the litigation will moveforward following an amendment. When a court grants
leave to amend to add an adverse party after the time for
responding to the original pleading has lapsed, the partyso added is given "10 days after service of the amended

pleading" to plead in response. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 15(a).This opportunity to respond, fundamental to due process,
is the echo of the opportunity to respond to original plead-ings secured by Rule 12. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 12(a)(1).
Thus, Rule 15 assumes an amended pleading will be filed andanticipates service of that pleading on the adverse party.

Nelson was never served with an amended pleading. In-deed, no such pleading was ever actually composed and filed
in court. Nor, after the amendment naming him as a party,was Nelson accorded 10 days to state his defenses against
personal liability for costs and fees. Instead, judgment was
entered against him the moment permission to amend thepleading was granted. Appeal after judgment, in the circumstances this case presents, did not provide an adequate opportunity to defend against the imposition of liability. Cf. American Surety Co. v. Baldwin, 287 U. S. 156
(1932). Adams points to nothing in the record indicating
that Nelson affirmatively relinquished his right to respond
on the merits of the case belatedly stated against him in
his individual capacity. Accordingly, the proceedings did not
comply with Rule 15, and neither did they comport with due
process. See, e. g., Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank &
Trust Co., 339 U. S. 306, 314 (1950) (" `The fundamental requisite of due process of law is the opportunity to be heard.' ")
(quoting Grannis v. Ordean, 234 U. S. 385, 394 (1914)).

It is true that Nelson knew as soon as Adams moved to
amend the pleading and alter the judgment that he might
ultimately be subjected to personal liability. One could

Opinion of the Court
ask, therefore, whether Nelson in fact had a fair chance, be-fore alteration of the judgment, to respond and be heard.

Rule 15 and the due process for which it provides, how-ever, demand a more reliable and orderly course. First,
as the Rule indicates, pleading in response to an amendedcomplaint is a prerogative of parties, see Fed. Rule Civ.
Proc. 15(a), and Nelson was not a party prior to the Dis-trict Court's ruling on Adams' motion to amend. Second,
as Rule 15 further prescribes, the clock on an added party'stime to respond does not start running until the new pleading naming that party is served, see ibid., just as the clockon an original party's time to respond does not start running
until the original pleading is served, see Fed. Rule Civ.Proc. 12(a)(1)(A). This is not to say that Rule 15 is itself
a constitutional requirement. Beyond doubt, however, aprospective party cannot fairly be required to answer an
amended pleading not yet permitted, framed, and served.1In support of its holding that Nelson was not prejudiced
when added as a party and subjected to judgment, theFederal Circuit relied on its prior decision in Fromson v.
Citiplate, Inc., 886 F. 2d 1300 (1989). See 175 F. 3d, at 1349-1350, and n. 7. The reliance is puzzling, for the circumstances in Fromson were crucially different from thosepresented here. The plaintiff in Fromson prevailed on an
infringement claim and subsequently moved to hold theowners of the judgment-proof defendant corporation individually liable. To that extent only, Fromson resembles the

1 Even when an amendment relates back to the original date of pleading under Rule 15(c), as Adams contends its amendment does, the relation back cannot, consistently with due process, deny a party all opportunity to be heard in response to the amendment. We also note in this
regard that the instant case does not fall under Rule 15(c)(3), which deals
with amendments that change the party or the name of the party against
whom claims are asserted. That subsection applies only in cases involving "a mistake concerning the identity of the proper party." Fed.
Rule Civ. Proc. 15(c)(3)(B). Respondent Adams made no such mistake.
It knew of Nelson's role and existence and, until it moved to amend its
pleading, chose to assert its claim for costs and fees only against OCP.

Opinion of the Court
instant case. Notably unlike Adams, however, the plaintiffin Fromson had moved before trial to add the individual

owners as parties, because it suspected from the start thatthe defendant corporation might not be able to pay. The
District Court denied that motion in reliance on the de-fendant corporation's false assurances that it was solvent.
See 886 F. 2d, at 1301, 1304. Having been informed be-fore trial that the plaintiffs sought to sue them in their
individual capacities, and having acted deliberately to de-rail such a suit, the owners of the defendant corporation
in Fromson could hardly assert that another's mistake orchoice of whom to sue had compromised their ability to
defend. Their problem, the Federal Circuit aptly observedin its

Fromson opinion, was "a bed of their own making."Id., at 1304. Here, in contrast, Adams never sought to

sue Nelson individually until after judgment was enteredagainst OCP. Nor is there any indication that Adams initially sought relief solely against OCP because of some falseassurance regarding OCP's solvency.

To summarize, Nelson was never afforded a proper opportunity to respond to the claim against him. Instead, hewas adjudged liable the very first moment his personal liability was legally at issue. Procedure of this style has beenquestioned even in systems, real and imaginary, less concerned than ours with the right to due process.2

" `Herald, read the accusation!' said the King.
On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then
unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:

`The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,

All on a summer day:
The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,

And took them quite away!'

come before that!' " L. Carroll, Alice in Wonderland and Through the

Opinion of the Court

B
Adams strongly urges, however, that Nelson waived
his objections to the swift process of the District Court.
Adams first maintains that Nelson waived arguments based
on personal jurisdiction and the absence of service of process
by failing to raise them promptly after being added as a
party. Brief for Respondents 32-41. Nelson's winning argument, however, is based neither on personal jurisdiction
nor on service of process. It rests on his right to have time
and opportunity to respond to the claim once Adams gained
leave to sue Nelson in his individual capacity, and thereby
to reach beyond OCP's corporate till into Nelson's personal
pocket. Waiver of arguments based on personal jurisdiction
and service of process is therefore beside the point.3

In a similar vein, and this time coming closer to the dispositive issue, Adams submits that the Federal Circuit
"did not address the `due process' issues now sought to be
presented, . . . because these issues were never raised by
Petitioner" before that court. Id., at 47 (emphasis deleted).
It is indeed the general rule that issues must be raised in
lower courts in order to be preserved as potential grounds
of decision in higher courts. But this principle does not
demand the incantation of particular words; rather, it requires that the lower court be fairly put on notice as to the
substance of the issue. See, e. g., Beech Aircraft Corp. v.
Rainey, 488 U. S. 153, 174-175 (1988). And the general rule

3 We note that a waiver of service of process does not waive a party's
right to time in which to respond to the substance of charges that, absent
the waiver, would have been included in a served document. It would
make little sense to penalize a party's waiver of process, which can help
streamline litigation, by barring such a party from stating its side of
the case. Indeed, such waiver can sometimes extend a party's time to
respond. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 12(a)(1)(B) (rather than having to respond within 20 days of service, a party waiving service may respond at
any time within 60 days of the request for waiver).

470 NELSON v. ADAMS USA, INC.

Opinion of the Court
does not prevent us from declaring what due process requires in this case, for that matter was fairly before the
Court of Appeals.

In response to questioning from the appellate bench,
Nelson's counsel explained that the core of his client's argument was the fundamental unfairness of imposing judgment
without going through the process of litigation our rules of
civil procedure prescribe.4 Both the majority and the dissent in the Federal Circuit understood that an issue before
them concerned the process due after Adams' postjudgment
motion. See 175 F. 3d, at 1349, n. 5 (majority opinion); id.,
at 1352 (Newman, J., dissenting). Our resolution of the case
as a matter of due process therefore rests on a ground considered and passed upon by the court below.

Beneath Adams' technical and ultimately unavailing arguments about waiver, its essential position in the litigation is
reflected in the Federal Circuit's decision: There was sufficient identity between Nelson and OCP to bind Nelson, without further ado, to a judgment already entered against OCP.
Nelson was president and sole shareholder of OCP. See
id., at 1346. It was Nelson who withheld prior art from the
Patent Office. See id., at 1349. He had actual notice that
Adams was seeking to collect a fee award from OCP, because
he was the "effective controller" of the litigation for OCP
and personally participated as a witness at the hearing on
whether OCP had engaged in inequitable conduct. See ibid.

The Federal Circuit did not conclude that these factors
would have justified imposing liability on Nelson by piercing

4 Nelson's counsel stated his position as follows: "[I]t's legally wrong
to subject the individual, nonserved, nonsued, nonlitigated-against person to liability for that judgment. Because there are rules. The rules
say if you want a judgment against somebody, you sue them, you litigate
against them, you get a judgment against them." Tape of Oral Arg. in
No. 98-1448 (CA Fed. Feb. 3, 1999).

Opinion of the Court
OCP's corporate veil, see id., at 1349, n. 6, and Adams, for
its part, has disavowed reliance on a veil-piercing theory, see
Record, Doc. No. 129, at 3 (stating, before the District Court,
that "Adams does not request that the Court `disregard the
corporate form' "); Tape of Oral Arg. in No. 98-1448 (CA Fed.
Feb. 3, 1999) (expressly stating that this case does not concern piercing the corporate veil). One-person corporations
are authorized by law and should not lightly be labeled sham.
See, e. g., Gregory v. Helvering, 293 U. S. 465, 469 (1935)
(finding corporation a sham not because it was owned entirely by one person, but because it had "no business or
corporate purpose"); Kirno Hill Corp. v. Holt, 618 F. 2d
982, 985 (CA2 1980) (a corporation's veil may not be pierced
merely because it has only one owner). Indeed, where patents are concerned, the one-person corporation may be an
altogether appropriate means to permit innovation without
exposing inventors to possibly ruinous consequences. The
legitimacy of OCP as a corporation, in short, is not at issue
in this case.

Instead, the Federal Circuit reasoned that nothing much
turned on whether the party opposing Adams' claim for
costs and fees was OCP or Nelson. "[N]o basis has been
advanced," the panel majority concluded, "to believe anything different or additional would have been done to defend against the allegation of inequitable conduct had Nelson
individually already been added as a party or had he been a
party from the outset." 175 F. 3d, at 1351. We neither dispute nor endorse the substance of this speculation. We say
instead that judicial predictions about the outcome of hypothesized litigation cannot substitute for the actual opportunity to defend that due process affords every party against
whom a claim is stated. As Judge Newman wrote in dissent: "The law, at its most fundamental, does not render
judgment simply because a person might have been found
liable had he been charged." Id., at 1354.

472 NELSON v. ADAMS USA, INC.

Opinion of the Court
Our decision surely does not insulate Nelson from liability.As counsel twice represented at oral argument, see Tr. of

Oral Arg. 9, 19-20, Nelson seeks only the right to conteston the merits his personal liability for fees originally sought
and awarded solely against OCP. That right, we hold, is justwhat due process affords him.

For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court ofAppeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further

proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

5 Once the amended pleading is served and Nelson's response is submitted, it will be open to Adams to urge, as Adams prematurely does here,
Brief for Respondents 22-28, that issue preclusion (collateral estoppel)
bars Nelson from contesting findings made during the litigation between
OCP and Adams. See Restatement (Second) of Judgments $ 39 (1980).
We venture no opinion here about the possible success of such an argument, made at the proper time.

SLACK v. McDANIEL, WARDEN, et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 98-6322. Argued October 4, 1999--Reargued March 29, 2000--

Decided April 26, 2000

After petitioner Slack was convicted of second-degree murder in Nevada

and his direct appeal was unsuccessful, he filed, in 1991, a federal habeas
corpus petition under 28 U. S. C. $ 2254. Because he wished to litigate
claims he had not yet presented to the Nevada courts, but could not do
so under the rule requiring complete exhaustion of state remedies, see
Rose v. Lundy, 455 U. S. 509, Slack filed a motion to hold his federal
petition in abeyance while he returned to state court. The Federal District Court ordered the habeas petition dismissed without prejudice,
granting Slack leave to file an application to renew upon exhausting
state remedies. After unsuccessful state postconviction proceedings,
Slack filed anew in the federal court in 1995, presenting 14 claims for
relief. The State moved to dismiss, arguing that (1) Slack's was a
mixed petition raising some claims which had been presented to the
state courts and some which had not, and (2) under the established
Ninth Circuit rule, claims not raised in Slack's 1991 federal petition had
to be dismissed as an abuse of the writ. The District Court granted the
State's motion, holding, first, that Slack's 1995 petition was "[a] second or
successive petition," even though his 1991 petition had been dismissed
without prejudice for a failure to exhaust state remedies. The court
then invoked the abuse of the writ doctrine to dismiss with prejudice
the claims Slack had not raised in the 1991 petition. The dismissal
order was filed in 1998, after which Slack filed in the District Court a
pleading captioned "Notice of Appeal." Consistent with Circuit practice, the court treated the notice as an application for a certificate of
probable cause (CPC) under the version of $ 2253 that existed before
enactment of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996
(AEDPA). It denied a CPC, concluding the appeal would raise no substantial issue. The Ninth Circuit likewise denied a CPC, so that Slack
was not permitted to appeal the order dismissing his petition.

Held:

1. Where a habeas petitioner seeks to initiate an appeal of the dismissal of his petition after April 24, 1996 (AEDPA's effective date), the
right to appeal is governed by the requirements now found at $ 2253(c)--
which provides, inter alia, that such an appeal may not be taken unless

Syllabus
a circuit Justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability (COA),

$ 2253(c)(1), and that the COA may issue only if the applicant has
made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,

$ 2253(c)(2)--even though the habeas petition was filed in the district
court before AEDPA's effective date. Slack argues incorrectly that the
pre-AEDPA version of the statute, not $ 2253(c), controls his case
because, in Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U. S. 320, 327, this Court held that
AEDPA's $ 2254 amendments governing entitlement to district court habeas relief applied to cases filed after AEDPA's effective date. In implementing Lindh, it must be recognized that $ 2254 is directed to district court proceedings while $ 2253 is directed to appellate proceedings.
Just as $ 2254 applies to cases filed in the trial court post-AEDPA, $ 2253
applies to appellate proceedings initiated post-AEDPA. Although
Lindh requires a court of appeals to apply pre-AEDPA law in reviewing
the trial court's ruling in cases commenced there pre-AEDPA, postAEDPA law governs the right to appeal in cases such as the present.
While an appeal is a continuation of the litigation started in the trial
court, it is a distinct step. E. g., Hohn v. United States, 524 U. S. 236,
241. Under AEDPA, an appellate case is commenced when the application for a COA is filed. Ibid. When Congress instructs that application of a statute is triggered by the commencement of a case, the
relevant case for a statute directed to appeals is the one initiated in
the appellate court. Because Slack sought appellate review of the dismissal of his habeas petition two years after AEDPA's effective date,

$ 2253(c) governs here, and Slack must apply for a COA. The Ninth
Circuit should have treated his notice of appeal as such an application.
Pp. 480-482.

2. When the district court denies a habeas petition on procedural
grounds without reaching the prisoner's underlying constitutional claim,
a COA should issue (and an appeal of the district court's order may
be taken) if the prisoner shows, at least, that jurists of reason would
find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial
of a constitutional right, and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.
Pp. 483-485.

(a) The Court rejects the State's contentions that, because $ 2253(c)
provides that a COA may issue upon the "substantial showing of the
denial of a constitutional right," only constitutional rulings may be
appealed, and no appeal can be taken if the district court relies on procedural grounds to dismiss the petition. In setting forth the preconditions for issuance of a COA under $ 2253(c), Congress expressed no
intention to allow trial court procedural error to bar vindication of substantial constitutional rights on appeal. This conclusion follows from

AEDPA's present provisions, which incorporate earlier habeas corpus
principles. Except for substituting the word "constitutional" for the
word "federal," the present $ 2253 is a codification of the CPC standard
announced in Barefoot v. Estelle, 463 U. S. 880, 894. See Williams v.
Taylor, ante, at 434. Under Barefoot, a substantial showing of the denial of a right includes showing that reasonable jurists could debate
whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been
resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were " `adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.' " 463 U. S., at 893,
and n. 4. Pp. 483-484.

(b) Determining whether a COA should issue where the petition
was dismissed on procedural grounds has two components, one directed
at the underlying constitutional claims and one directed at the district
court's procedural holding. Section 2253 mandates that both showings
be made before the court of appeals may entertain the appeal. Each
component is part of a threshold inquiry, and a court may find that it
can dispose of the application in a fair and prompt manner if it proceeds
first to resolve the issue whose answer is more apparent from the record
and arguments. Resolution of procedural issues first is allowed and
encouraged by the rule that this Court will not pass upon a constitutional question if there is also present some other ground upon which
the case may be disposed of. Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 347.
Here, Slack did not attempt to make a substantial showing of the denial
of a constitutional right, instead arguing only that the District Court's
procedural rulings were wrong. This Court does not attempt to determine whether Slack could make the required showing of constitutional
error, for the issue was neither briefed nor presented below because of
the view that the CPC, rather than COA, standards applied. It will be
necessary to consider the matter upon any remand for further proceedings. The Court does, however, address the second component of the

$ 2253(c) inquiry, whether jurists of reason could conclude that the District Court's dismissal on procedural grounds was debatable or incorrect. Pp. 484-485.

3. A habeas petition which is filed after an initial petition was dismissed without adjudication on the merits for failure to exhaust state
remedies is not a "second or successive" petition as that term is understood in the habeas corpus context. Pp. 485-490.

(a) The District Court erred in concluding to the contrary. Because the question whether Slack's pre-AEDPA, 1995 petition was second or successive implicates his right to relief in the trial court, preAEDPA law governs. See Lindh v. Murphy, supra. Whether the
dismissal was appropriate is controlled by Rule 9(b) of the Rules Governing $ 2254, which incorporates the Court's prior decisions on the

subject, McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467, 487, and states: "A second
or successive petition [alleging new and different grounds] may be dismissed if . . . the judge finds that the failure . . . to assert those grounds
in a prior petition constituted an abuse of the writ." The "second or
successive petition" phrase is a term of art given substance in, e. g.,
Rose v. Lundy, 455 U. S., at 510, which held that a district court must
dismiss habeas petitions containing both exhausted and unexhausted
claims, but contemplated that the prisoner could return to federal court
after the requisite exhaustion, id., at 520-521. Thus, a petition filed
after a mixed petition has been dismissed under Rose v. Lundy before
the district court adjudicated any claims is to be treated as any other
first petition and is not a second or successive petition. Neither Rose
v. Lundy nor Stewart v. Martinez-Villareal, 523 U. S. 637 (1998), supports the State's contention that the prisoner, upon his return to federal
court, should be restricted to the claims made in his initial petition. It
is instead more appropriate to treat the initial mixed petition as though
it had not been filed, subject to whatever conditions the court attaches
to the dismissal. Accordingly, Slack's 1995 petition should not have
been dismissed on the grounds that it was second or successive. To the
extent that the Court's ruling might allow prisoners repeatedly to return to state court and thereby inject undue delay into the collateral
review process, the problem can be countered under the States' power
to impose proper procedural bars and the federal courts' broad powers
to prevent duplicative or unnecessary litigation. Pp. 485-489.

(b) Thus, Slack has demonstrated that reasonable jurists could conclude that the District Court's abuse of the writ holding was wrong.
Whether Slack is otherwise entitled to the issuance of a COA is a question to be resolved first upon remand. Pp. 489-490.

478 SLACK v. McDANIEL

Opinion of the Court
First, when a habeas corpus petitioner seeks to initiatean appeal of the dismissal of a habeas corpus petition after

April 24, 1996 (the effective date of AEDPA), the right toappeal is governed by the certificate of appealability (COA)
requirements now found at 28 U. S. C. $ 2253(c) (1994 ed.,Supp. III). This is true whether the habeas corpus petition
was filed in the district court before or after AEDPA's effec-tive date.

Second, when the district court denies a habeas petitionon procedural grounds without reaching the prisoner's underlying constitutional claim, a COA should issue (and anappeal of the district court's order may be taken) if the prisoner shows, at least, that jurists of reason would find it de-batable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial
of a constitutional right, and that jurists of reason wouldfind it debatable whether the district court was correct in its
procedural ruling.Third, a habeas petition which is filed after an initial petition was dismissed without adjudication on the merits forfailure to exhaust state remedies is not a "second or successive" petition as that term is understood in the habeas corpuscontext. Federal courts do, however, retain broad powers
to prevent duplicative or unnecessary litigation.

I
Petitioner Antonio Slack was convicted of second-degreemurder in Nevada state court in 1990. His direct appeal

was unsuccessful. On November 27, 1991, Slack filed a peti-tion for writ of habeas corpus in federal court under 28
U. S. C. $ 2254. Early in the federal proceeding, Slack de-cided to litigate claims he had not yet presented to the Nevada courts. He could not raise the claims in federal court
because, under the exhaustion of remedies rule explained in
Rose v. Lundy, 455 U. S. 509 (1982), a federal court was required to dismiss a petition presenting claims not yet liti529US2 Unit: $U50 [09-26-01 10:29:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
gated in state court. Accordingly, Slack filed a motion seeking to hold his federal petition in abeyance while he returned
to state court to exhaust the new claims. Without objection
by the State, the District Court ordered the habeas petition
dismissed "without prejudice." The order, dated February
19, 1992, further stated, "Petitioner is granted leave to file an
application to renew upon exhaustion of all State remedies."
Slack v. Director, Nev. Dept. of Prisons, No. CV-N-91-561
(D. Nev.), App. 22.

After an unsuccessful round of state postconviction proceedings, Slack filed a new federal habeas petition on May
30, 1995. The District Court later appointed counsel, directing him to file an amended petition or a notice of intention
to proceed with the current petition. On December 24, 1997,
counsel filed an amended petition presenting 14 claims for
relief. The State moved to dismiss the petition. As its first
ground, the State argued that Slack's petition must be dismissed because it was a mixed petition, that is to say a petition raising some claims which had been presented to the
state courts and some which had not. As its second ground,
the State cited Farmer v. McDaniel, 98 F. 3d 1548 (CA9
1996), and contended that, under the established rule in the
Ninth Circuit, claims Slack had not raised in his 1991 federal
habeas petition must be dismissed as an abuse of the writ.

The District Court granted the State's motion. First, the
court relied on Farmer to hold that Slack's 1995 petition was
"[a] second or successive petition," even though his 1991 petition had been dismissed without prejudice for a failure to
exhaust state remedies. The court then invoked the abuse
of the writ doctrine to dismiss with prejudice the claims
Slack had not raised in the 1991 petition. This left Slack
with four claims, each having been raised in the 1991 petition; but one of these, the court concluded, had not yet been
presented to the state courts. The court therefore dismissed Slack's remaining claims because they were in a

480 SLACK v. McDANIEL

Opinion of the Court
mixed petition. Here, Slack seeks to challenge the dismissal
of claims as abusive; he does not contend that all claims presented in the amended petition were exhausted.

The District Court's dismissal order was filed March 30,
1998. On April 29, 1998, Slack filed in the District Court
a pleading captioned "Notice of Appeal." Consistent with
Circuit practice, the court treated the notice as an application for a certificate of probable cause (CPC) under the preAEDPA version of 28 U. S. C. $ 2253; and it denied a CPC,
concluding the appeal would raise no substantial issue. The
Court of Appeals likewise denied a CPC. No. CV-95-194
(CA9, July 7, 1998), App. 197. As a result, Slack was not
permitted to take an appeal of the order dismissing his petition. We granted certiorari. 525 U. S. 1138 (1999). Slack
contends that he is entitled to an appeal of the dismissal of
his petition, arguing that the District Court was wrong to
hold that his 1995 petition was "second or successive." We
agree that Slack's 1995 petition was not second or successive,
but first we must resolve two preliminary questions.

II
Before AEDPA, appellate review of the dismissal of a habeas petition was governed by a version of 28 U. S. C. $ 2253
enacted in 1948. Act of June 25, 1948, 62 Stat. 967. The
statute provided no appeal could be taken from the final
order in a habeas corpus proceeding "unless the justice or
judge who rendered the order or a circuit justice or judge
issues a certificate of probable cause." Ibid. The statute
did not explain the standards for the issuance of a CPC, but
the Court established what a prisoner must show to obtain
a CPC in Barefoot v. Estelle, 463 U. S. 880 (1983): "a substantial showing of the denial of a federal right." Id., at 893
(citation and brackets omitted).

Effective April 24, 1996, AEDPA amended $ 2253. As relevant here, AEDPA added subsection (c), which provides:

529US2 Unit: $U50 [09-26-01 10:29:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN

481Cite as: 529 U. S. 473 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
"(1) Unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certifi-cate of appealability, an appeal may not be taken to the

court of appeals from--"(A) the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding in
which the detention complained of arises out of processissued by a State court; or

"(B) the final order in a proceeding under section2255.
"(2) A certificate of appealability may issue underparagraph (1) only if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right."(3) The certificate of appealability under paragraph
(1) shall indicate which specific issue or issues satisfythe showing required by paragraph (2)." 28 U. S. C.

$ 2253(c) (1994 ed., Supp. III).
The issue we consider at the outset is whether the pre- orpost-AEDPA version of $ 2253 controls Slack's right to appeal. In Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U. S. 320 (1997), the Courtheld that AEDPA's amendments to 28 U. S. C. $ 2254, the
statute governing entitlement to habeas relief in the districtcourt, applied to cases filed after AEDPA's effective date.
521 U. S., at 327. Slack contends that Lindh means $ 2253(c)does not apply to him because his case was commenced in
the District Court pre-AEDPA. That position is incorrect.For purposes of implementing the holding in

Lindh, it mustbe recognized that $ 2254 is directed to proceedings in the

district courts while $ 2253 is directed to proceedings inthe appellate courts. Just as $ 2254 applies to cases filed
in the trial court post-AEDPA, $ 2253 applies to appellateproceedings initiated post-AEDPA. True, Lindh requires a
court of appeals to apply pre-AEDPA law in reviewing thetrial court's ruling, for cases commenced there pre-AEDPA;
but post-AEDPA law governs the right to appeal in casessuch as the one now before us.

While an appeal is a continuation of the litigation startedin the trial court, it is a distinct step.

Hohn v. United

529US2 Unit: $U50 [09-26-01 10:29:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN
482 SLACK v. McDANIEL

Opinion of the Court
States, 524 U. S. 236, 241 (1998); Mackenzie v. A. Engelhard & Sons Co., 266 U. S. 131 (1924). We have described
proceedings in the courts of appeals as "appellate cases."
E. g., Order of Apr. 30, 1991, 500 U. S. 1009 (amendments to
Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure "shall govern all proceedings in appellate cases thereafter commenced"). Under
AEDPA, an appellate case is commenced when the application for a COA is filed. Hohn, supra, at 241. When Congress instructs us (as Lindh says it has) that application of
a statute is triggered by the commencement of a case, the
relevant case for a statute directed to appeals is the one initiated in the appellate court. Thus, $ 2253(c) governs appellate court proceedings filed after AEDPA's effective date.
We see no indication that Congress intended to tie application of the provisions to the date a petition was filed in
the district court. The COA statute establishes procedural
rules and requires a threshold inquiry into whether the circuit court may entertain an appeal. Hohn, supra, at 248;
cf. Lindh, supra, at 327. Because Slack sought appellate
review two years after AEDPA's effective date, $ 2253(c)
governs his right to appeal.

We further note that we applied $ 2253 in our post-Lindh
decision in Hohn, a case which arrived in the same posture
as this case. Like Slack, Hohn argued $ 2253(c) did not apply
because his petition had been filed in the District Court before AEDPA's effective date. Brief for Petitioner in Hohn
v. United States, O. T. 1997, No. 96-8986, pp. 40-44. Though
our opinion did not discuss whether $ 2253(c) applied to Hohn,
we would have had no reason to reach the issue we did resolve, that we had statutory certiorari jurisdiction to review
the denial of a COA, if AEDPA did not apply at all. Our
disposition today is consistent with Hohn. AEDPA governs
the conditions of Slack's appeal, and so he was required to
seek a COA to obtain appellate review of the dismissal of his
habeas petition.

Opinion of the Court

III
As AEDPA applied, the Court of Appeals should havetreated the notice of appeal as an application for a COA.

Fed. Rule App. Proc. 22(b); Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(f ); seealso

Hohn, supra, at 240. To evaluate whether the Court ofAppeals should have granted a COA, we must determine

what the habeas applicant must show to satisfy the require-ments of $ 2253(c).

Citing $ 2253(c)'s requirement that a COA may issue onlyupon the "substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right," the State contends that no appeal can be takenif the District Court relies on procedural grounds to dismiss
the petition. According to the State, only constitutional rul-ings may be appealed. Under this view, a state prisoner
who can demonstrate he was convicted in violation of theConstitution and who can demonstrate that the district court
was wrong to dismiss the petition on procedural groundswould be denied relief. We reject this interpretation. The
writ of habeas corpus plays a vital role in protecting consti-tutional rights. In setting forth the preconditions for issuance of a COA under $ 2253(c), Congress expressed no inten-tion to allow trial court procedural error to bar vindication
of substantial constitutional rights on appeal.Our conclusion follows from AEDPA's present provisions,
which incorporate earlier habeas corpus principles. UnderAEDPA, a COA may not issue unless "the applicant has
made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutionalright." 28 U. S. C. $ 2253(c) (1994 ed., Supp. III). Except
for substituting the word "constitutional" for the word "fed-eral," $ 2253 is a codification of the CPC standard announced
in Barefoot v. Estelle, 463 U. S., at 894. Congress had beforeit the meaning Barefoot had given to the words it selected;
and we give the language found in $ 2253(c) the meaningascribed it in Barefoot, with due note for the substitution
of the word "constitutional." See Williams v. Taylor, ante,at 434. To obtain a COA under $ 2253(c), a habeas prisoner

484 SLACK v. McDANIEL

Opinion of the Court
must make a substantial showing of the denial of a constitu-tional right, a demonstration that, under

Barefoot, includes
showing that reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, forthat matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presentedwere " `adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.' " Barefoot, supra, at 893, and n. 4 ("sum[ming] up"
the " `substantial showing' " standard).Where a district court has rejected the constitutional

claims on the merits, the showing required to satisfy $ 2253(c)is straightforward: The petitioner must demonstrate that
reasonable jurists would find the district court's assessment
of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong. The issue
becomes somewhat more complicated where, as here, the
district court dismisses the petition based on procedural
grounds. We hold as follows: When the district court denies
a habeas petition on procedural grounds without reaching
the prisoner's underlying constitutional claim, a COA should
issue when the prisoner shows, at least, that jurists of reason
would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid
claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists
of reason would find it debatable whether the district court
was correct in its procedural ruling. This construction
gives meaning to Congress' requirement that a prisoner
demonstrate substantial underlying constitutional claims and
is in conformity with the meaning of the "substantial showing" standard provided in Barefoot, supra, at 893, and n. 4,
and adopted by Congress in AEDPA. Where a plain procedural bar is present and the district court is correct to invoke it to dispose of the case, a reasonable jurist could not
conclude either that the district court erred in dismissing

the petition or that the petitioner should be allowed to proceed further. In such a circumstance, no appeal would be
warranted.

Determining whether a COA should issue where the petition was dismissed on procedural grounds has two compo529US2 Unit: $U50 [09-26-01 10:29:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
nents, one directed at the underlying constitutional claimsand one directed at the district court's procedural holding.

Section 2253 mandates that both showings be made beforethe court of appeals may entertain the appeal. Each component of the $ 2253(c) showing is part of a threshold inquiry,and a court may find that it can dispose of the application in
a fair and prompt manner if it proceeds first to resolve the
issue whose answer is more apparent from the record andarguments. The recognition that the "Court will not pass

upon a constitutional question although properly presentedby the record, if there is also present some other ground
upon which the case may be disposed of," Ashwander v. TVA,
297 U. S. 288, 347 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring), allows and
encourages the court to first resolve procedural issues. The
Ashwander rule should inform the court's discretion in this
regard.

In this case, Slack did not attempt to make a substantial
showing of the denial of a constitutional right, instead arguing only that the District Court's procedural rulings were
wrong. We will not attempt to determine whether Slack
could make the required showing of constitutional error, for
the issue was neither briefed nor presented below because
of the view that the CPC, rather than COA, standards applied. It will be necessary to consider the matter upon any
remand for further proceedings. We will, however, address
the second component of the $ 2253(c) inquiry, whether jurists of reason could conclude that the District Court's dismissal on procedural grounds was debatable or incorrect.
The issue has been discussed in the briefs presented to us; it
is the question upon which we granted certiorari; and its
resolution would end the case, were we to decide the matter
in the State's favor.

The District Court dismissed claims Slack failed to raise
in his 1991 petition based on its conclusion that Slack's 1995
petition was a second or successive habeas petition. This
conclusion was wrong. A habeas petition filed in the district

court after an initial habeas petition was unadjudicated onits merits and dismissed for failure to exhaust state remedies

is not a second or successive petition.Slack commenced this habeas proceeding in the District
Court in 1995, before AEDPA's effective date. Because thequestion whether Slack's petition was second or successive
implicates his right to relief in the trial court, pre-AEDPA
law governs, see Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U. S. 320 (1997),though we do not suggest the definition of second or successive would be different under AEDPA. See Stewart v.
Martinez-Villareal, 523 U. S. 637 (1998) (using pre-AEDPA
law to interpret AEDPA's provision governing "second or
successive habeas applications"). The parties point us to
Rule 9(b) of the Rules Governing Section 2254 Cases in the
United States District Courts as controlling the issue. The
Rule incorporates our prior decisions regarding successive
petitions and abuse of the writ, McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S.
467, 487 (1991), and states: "A second or successive petition
[alleging new and different grounds] may be dismissed if . . .
the judge finds that the failure of the petitioner to assert
those grounds in a prior petition constituted an abuse of the
writ." As the text demonstrates, Rule 9(b) applies only to
"a second or successive petition."

The phrase "second or successive petition" is a term of
art given substance in our prior habeas corpus cases. The
Court's decision in Rose v. Lundy, 455 U. S., at 510, instructs
us in reaching our understanding of the term. Rose v.
Lundy held that a federal district court must dismiss habeas
corpus petitions containing both exhausted and unexhausted
claims. The opinion, however, contemplated that the prisoner could return to federal court after the requisite exhaustion. Id., at 520 ("Those prisoners who . . . submit mixed
petitions nevertheless are entitled to resubmit a petition
with only exhausted claims or to exhaust the remainder of
their claims"). It was only if a prisoner declined to return
to state court and decided to proceed with his exhausted

Opinion of the Court
claims in federal court that the possibility arose that a subse-quent petition would be considered second or successive and

subject to dismissal as an abuse of the writ. Id., at 520-521(plurality opinion) ("[A] prisoner who decides to proceed only
with his exhausted claims and deliberately sets aside hisunexhausted claims risks dismissal of subsequent federal
petitions").

This understanding of the second or successive rule wasconfirmed two Terms ago when we wrote as follows: "[N]one

of our cases . . . have ever suggested that a prisoner whosehabeas petition was dismissed for failure to exhaust state
remedies, and who then did exhaust those remedies and
returned to federal court, was by such action filing a successive petition. A court where such a petition was filed could
adjudicate these claims under the same standard as would
govern those made in any other first petition." Stewart v.
Martinez-Villareal, supra, at 644. We adhere to this analysis. A petition filed after a mixed petition has been dismissed under Rose v. Lundy before the district court adjudicated any claims is to be treated as "any other first petition"
and is not a second or successive petition.

The State contends that the prisoner, upon his return
to federal court, should be restricted to the claims made in
his initial petition. Neither Rose v. Lundy nor MartinezVillareal requires this result, which would limit a prisoner
to claims made in a pleading that is often uncounseled, handwritten, and pending in federal court only until the State
identifies one unexhausted claim. The proposed rule would
bar the prisoner from raising nonfrivolous claims developed
in the subsequent state exhaustion proceedings contemplated by the Rose dismissal, even though a federal court
had yet to review a single constitutional claim. This result
would be contrary to our admonition that the complete exhaustion rule is not to "trap the unwary pro se prisoner."
Rose supra, at 520 (internal quotation marks omitted). It
is instead more appropriate to treat the initial mixed petition

Opinion of the Court
as though it had not been filed, subject to whatever condi-tions the court attaches to the dismissal.

Rose v. Lundy
dictated that, whatever particular claims the petition con-tained, none could be considered by the federal court.

Slack's 1991 petition was dismissed under the procedureestablished in

Rose v. Lundy. No claim made in Slack's 1991
petition was adjudicated during the three months it was
pending in federal court. As such, the 1995 petition shouldnot have been dismissed on the grounds that it was second

or successive. Reasoning to the contrary found in the Courtof Appeals'

Farmer decision, rendered before MartinezVillareal, is incorrect. See also In re Turner, 101 F. 3d 1323
(CA9 1997) (refusing to apply rules governing second or successive petitions to a petitioner whose prior habeas petition
had been dismissed for failure to exhaust). Our view that
established practice demonstrates that Slack's 1995 petition
is not second or successive is confirmed as well by opinions
of the Courts of Appeals which have addressed the point
under similar circumstances. E. g., Carlson v. Pitcher, 137
F. 3d 416, 420 (CA6 1998) ("We join with every other court
to consider the question, and hold that a habeas petition filed
after a previous petition has been dismissed on exhaustion
grounds is not a `second or successive' petition"); Turner,
supra; Christy v. Horn, 115 F. 3d 201, 208 (CA3 1997); Dickinson v. Maine, 101 F. 3d 791 (CA1 1996); Camarano v. Irvin,
98 F. 3d 44, 45-46 (CA2 1996).

The State complains that this rule is unfair. The filing of
a mixed petition in federal court requires it to appear and
to plead failure to exhaust. The petition is then dismissed
without prejudice, allowing the prisoner to make a return
trip through the state courts to exhaust new claims. The
State expresses concern that, upon exhaustion, the prisoner
would return to federal court but again file a mixed petition,
causing the process to repeat itself. In this manner, the
State contends, a vexatious litigant could inject undue delay
into the collateral review process. To the extent the tactic

Opinion of the Court
would become a problem, however, it can be countered with-out upsetting the established meaning of a second or successive petition.First, the State remains free to impose proper procedural
bars to restrict repeated returns to state court for postcon-viction proceedings. Second, provisions of AEDPA may
bear upon the question in cases to which the Act applies.AEDPA itself demonstrates that Congress may address matters relating to exhaustion and mixed petitions throughmeans other than rules governing "second or successive" petitions. E. g., 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(b)(2) (1994 ed., Supp. III).Third, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, applicable as a
general matter to habeas cases, vest the federal courts withdue flexibility to prevent vexatious litigation. As Slack concedes, in the habeas corpus context it would be appropriatefor an order dismissing a mixed petition to instruct an applicant that upon his return to federal court he is to bring onlyexhausted claims. See Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 41(a) and (b).
Once the petitioner is made aware of the exhaustion require-ment, no reason exists for him not to exhaust all potential
claims before returning to federal court. The failure to com-ply with an order of the court is grounds for dismissal with
prejudice. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 41(b). In this case, how-ever, the initial petition was dismissed without condition and
without prejudice. We reject the State's argument that re-fusing to give a new meaning to the established term "second
or successive" opens the door to the abuses described.

IV
Slack has demonstrated that reasonable jurists could con-clude that the District Court's abuse of the writ holding was

wrong, for we have determined that a habeas petition filedafter an initial petition was dismissed under

Rose v. Lundywithout an adjudication on the merits is not a "second or

successive" petition. Whether Slack is otherwise entitled tothe issuance of a COA is a question to be resolved first upon

with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

With respect to the issue resolved in Part II of the Court's
opinion, I agree with the Courts of Appeals that have heldthat the pre-AEDPA version of 28 U. S. C. $ 2253 governs

the right to appeal with respect to an appeal noticed afterthe effective date of AEDPA in a habeas corpus proceeding
commenced prior to that date. See Fuller v. Roe, 182 F. 3d699, 702 (CA9 1999)

F. 3d 1050, 1051-1052 (CADC 1998); Tejeda v. Dubois, 142F. 3d 18, 22, n. 4 (CA1 1998);

(CA8 1997).

I do, however, join the balance of the Court's opinion and
its judgment.

Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas joins,
concurring in part and dissenting in part.

I join the opinion of the Court, except for its discussion
in Parts III and IV of whether Slack's postexhaustion petition was second or successive. I believe that the Court produces here, as it produced in a different respect in Stewart
v. Martinez-Villareal, 523 U. S. 637 (1998), see id., at 646

491Cite as: 529 U. S. 473 (2000)
Opinion of Scalia, J.
(Scalia, J., dissenting), a distortion of the natural meaningof the term "second or successive."

The opinion relies on Martinez-Villareal, together with
Rose v. Lundy, 455 U. S. 509 (1982), to conclude that a prisoner whose federal petition is dismissed to allow exhaustionmay return to federal court without having his later petition

treated as second or successive, regardless of what claims it
contains. Neither the holdings nor even the language ofthose opinions suggest that proposition. As for holdings:

Martinez-Villareal did not even involve the issue of exhaus-tion, and so has no bearing upon the present case. The narrow holding of Rose v. Lundy was that a habeas petition
containing both exhausted and unexhausted claims must be
dismissed, but it can be fairly said to have embraced the
proposition that the petitioner could return with the same
claims after they all had been exhausted. This latter proposition could be thought to rest upon the theory that a petition
dismissed for lack of exhaustion is a petition that never existed, so that any other later petition would not be second
or successive. Or it could be thought to rest upon the theory that the later refiling of the original claims, all of them
now exhausted, is just a renewal of the first petition, implicitly authorized by the dismissal to permit exhaustion. The
former theory is counterfactual; the latter is quite plausible.

The language the Court quotes from Rose and MartinezVillareal also does not justify the Court's mixed-petitionsdon't-count theory. The quotation from Rose says only that
" `prisoners who . . . submit mixed petitions . . . are entitled
to . . . exhaust the remainder of their claims.' " Ante, at
486 (quoting Rose, supra, at 520 (emphasis added)). This
does not suggest that they are entitled to add new claims, or
to return, once again, without accomplishing the exhaustion
that the court dismissed the petition to allow. And the quotation from Martinez-Villareal indicates only that when
a prisoner whose habeas petition was dismissed for failure
to exhaust state remedies " `then did exhaust those reme529US2 Unit: $U50 [09-26-01 10:29:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN
492 SLACK v. McDANIEL

Opinion of Scalia, J.
dies' " and refile in federal court, the court " `could adjudicate
these claims under the same standard as would govern those
made in any other first petition.' " Ante, at 487 (quoting
Martinez-Villareal, 523 U. S., at 644 (emphasis added)).
This does not require treating the later filed petition as a"first" petition regardless of whether it bears any resemblance to the petition initially filed. In fact, MartinezVillareal clearly recognized the potential significance of rais-ing a new claim rather than merely renewing an old one: It

held that a petition raising a claim of incompetence to beexecuted previously dismissed as premature was not second
or successive, but expressly distinguished, and left open, the
situation where the claim had not been raised in the earlier
petition. See id., at 645, n.

The State understandably fears the consequences of the
Court's approach, which would allow federal petitions to be
repeatedly filed and dismissed for lack of exhaustion, requiring the State repeatedly to appear and expend its resources,
with no help in sight from supposed limitations on "second
or successive" petitions. The Court reassuringly observes
that this problem can be countered in other ways, without
"upsetting the established meaning of a second or successive
petition." Ante, at 489. But as discussed above, it is not
"established" that a first petition ceases to be a first petition
when it is dismissed to permit exhaustion. And though the
problem of repetitive filings after dismissals for lack of exhaustion can of course be countered in other ways, so can the
problem of repetitive filings for all other reasons. It happens to be the whole purpose of the "second or successive"
provision to solve precisely that problem--directly checking
the "vexatious litigant," ante, at 488, rather than hoping that
the courts will use a patchwork of other provisions to achieve
the same end. I do not disagree with the Court that district
courts may be able to limit repeated filings through appropriate orders pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
41(a) and (b). This burden on district courts would not be

Opinion of Scalia, J.
necessary, however--and the States would not be remandedto reliance upon the discretion of district judges--if the limitation on "second or successive" petitions were given its nat-ural meaning.

Because I believe petitioner's inclusion of new and un-exhausted claims in his postexhaustion petition rendered it
second or successive, he is not entitled to a certificate ofappealability, and I would affirm the decision of the Court
of Appeals.

BECK v. PRUPIS et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eleventh circuit

No. 98-1480. Argued November 3, 1999--Decided April 26, 2000
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) creates

a civil cause of action for "[a]ny person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962." 18 U. S. C. $ 1964(c).
Subsection (d) of $ 1962 forbids "any person to conspire to violate any of
the provisions of subsection (a), (b), or (c) of [$ 1962]." Petitioner is a
former president, CEO, director, and shareholder of Southeastern Insurance Group (SIG). Respondents are former senior officers and directors of SIG who allegedly conspired to, and did, engage in acts of racketeering. Petitioner alleged that after he discovered respondents'
unlawful conduct and contacted regulators, respondents orchestrated a
scheme to remove him from the company. Petitioner sued respondents,
asserting, among other things, a $ 1964(c) cause of action for respondents' alleged conspiracy to violate $$ 1962(a), (b), and (c). Petitioner
alleged that his injury was proximately caused by an overt act--namely,
the termination of his employment--done in furtherance of respondents'
conspiracy, and that $ 1964(c) therefore provided a cause of action. The
District Court dismissed his RICO conspiracy claim, agreeing with respondents that employees who are terminated for refusing to participate
in RICO activities, or who threaten to report RICO activities, do not
have standing to sue under RICO for damages from their loss of employment. In affirming, the Eleventh Circuit held that, because the overt
act causing petitioner's injury was not an act of racketeering, it could
not support a $ 1964(c) cause of action.

Held: Injury caused by an overt act that is not an act of racketeering or

otherwise wrongful under RICO does not give rise to a cause of action
under $ 1964(c) for a violation of $ 1962(d). To determine what it means
to be "injured . . . by reason of" a "conspir[acy]," this Court must look
to the common law of civil conspiracy. At common law, it was widely
accepted that a plaintiff could bring suit for civil conspiracy only if he
had been injured by an act that was itself tortious. When Congress
adopted RICO, it incorporated this principle. As at common law, a civil
conspiracy plaintiff cannot bring suit under RICO based on injury
caused by any act in furtherance of a conspiracy that might have caused
the plaintiff injury. Rather, such plaintiff must allege injury from an
act that is analogous to an "ac[t] of a tortious character," see 4 Restate529US2 Unit: $U51 [09-26-01 10:31:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ment (Second) of Torts, $ 876, Comment b, meaning an act that is independently wrongful under RICO. The specific type of act that is analogous to an act of a tortious character may depend on the underlying
substantive violation the defendant is alleged to have committed. Because respondents' alleged overt act in furtherance of their conspiracy
was not an act of racketeering and is not independently wrongful under
any substantive provision of the statute, petitioner does not have a
cause of action under $ 1964(c). Pp. 500-507.

The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act(RICO), 18 U. S. C. $$ 1961-1968 (1994 ed. and Supp. IV), creates a civil cause of action for "[a]ny person injured in hisbusiness or property by reason of a violation of section

therance of a RICO conspiracy has a cause of action under$ 1964(c), even if the overt act is not an act of racketeering.

We conclude that such a person does not have a cause ofaction under $ 1964(c).

I
A
Congress enacted RICO as Title IX of the OrganizedCrime Control Act of 1970, Pub. L. 91-452, 84 Stat. 922, for

the purpose of "seek[ing] the eradication of organized crimein the United States," id., at 923. Congress found that "organized crime in the United States [had become] a highlysophisticated, diversified, and widespread activity that annually drain[ed] billions of dollars from America's economyby unlawful conduct and the illegal use of force, fraud, and
corruption." Id., at 922. The result was to "weaken thestability of the Nation's economic system, harm innocent
investors and competing organizations, interfere with freecompetition, seriously burden interstate and foreign commerce, threaten the domestic security, and undermine thegeneral welfare of the Nation and its citizens."

Id., at 923.Finding the existing "sanctions and remedies available to

the Government [to be] unnecessarily limited in scope andimpact," Congress resolved to address the problem of organized crime "by strengthening the legal tools in theevidence-gathering process, by establishing new penal prohibitions, and by providing enhanced sanctions and new reme-dies to deal with the unlawful activities of those engaged in
organized crime." Ibid.RICO attempts to accomplish these goals by providing
severe criminal penalties for violations of $ 1962, see $ 1963,and also by means of a civil cause of action for any person
"injured in his business or property by reason of a violationof section 1962," 18 U. S. C. $ 1964(c) (1994 ed., Supp. IV).

1 RICO also authorizes the Government to bring civil actions to "prevent
and restrain" violations of $ 1962. 18 U. S. C. $$ 1964(a) and (b).

Opinion of the Court
Section 1962, in turn, consists of four subsections: Subsection(a) makes it "unlawful for any person who has received any

income derived, directly or indirectly, from a pattern of rack-eteering activity or through collection of an unlawful debt . . .
to use or invest, directly or indirectly, any part of such in-come, or the proceeds of such income, in acquisition of any
interest in, or the establishment or operation of, any enter-prise which is engaged in, or the activities of which affect,
interstate or foreign commerce"; 2 subsection (b) makes it"unlawful for any person through a pattern of racketeering
activity or through collection of an unlawful debt to acquireor maintain, directly or indirectly, any interest in or control
of any enterprise which is engaged in, or the activities ofwhich affect, interstate or foreign commerce"; subsection (c)
makes it "unlawful for any person employed by or associatedwith any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which
affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or partici-pate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's
affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or collec-tion of unlawful debt"; and, finally, subsection (d) makes it
unlawful "for any person to conspire to violate any of theprovisions of subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section."

B
Petitioner, Robert A. Beck II, is a former president, CEO,director, and shareholder of Southeastern Insurance Group

(SIG).3 Respondents, Ronald M. Prupis, Leonard Bellezza,

2 Section 1961(1) contains an exhaustive list of acts of "racketeering,"
commonly referred to as "predicate acts." This list includes extortion,
mail fraud, and wire fraud, which were among the 50 separate acts of
racketeering alleged by petitioner. Section 1961(4) defines "enterprise"
as "any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not
a legal entity."

for respondents, we accept as true the evidence presented by petitioner.

498 BECK v. PRUPIS

Opinion of the Court
William Paulus, Jr., Ernest S. Sabato, Harry Olstein, Freder-ick C. Mezey, and Joseph S. Littenberg, are former senior

officers and directors of SIG. Until 1990, when it declaredbankruptcy, SIG was a Florida insurance holding company
with three operating subsidiaries, each of which was engagedin the business of writing surety bonds for construction
contractors.Beginning in or around 1987, certain directors and officers
of SIG, including respondents, began engaging in acts ofracketeering. They created an entity called Construction
Performance Corporation, which demanded fees from con-tractors in exchange for qualifying them for SIG surety
bonds. Respondents also diverted corporate funds to per-sonal uses and submitted false financial statements to regulators, shareholders, and creditors. During most of the timehe was employed at SIG, petitioner was unaware of these
activities. In early 1988, however, petitioner discovered re-spondents' unlawful conduct and contacted regulators concerning the financial statements. Respondents then orches-trated a scheme to remove petitioner from the company.
They hired an insurance consultant to write a false reportsuggesting that petitioner had failed to perform his material
duties. The day after this report was presented to the SIGboard of directors, the board fired petitioner, relying on a
clause in his contract providing for termination in the eventof an "inability or substantial failure to perform [his] material duties." App. 104. Petitioner sued respondents, as-serting, among other things, a civil cause of action under

$ 1964(c).4 In particular, petitioner claimed that respond-ents used or invested income derived from a pattern of racketeering activity to establish and operate an enterprise, inviolation of $ 1962(a); acquired and maintained an interest in

4 Petitioner's lawsuit was originally brought as a cross-claim in a shareholders' derivative suit filed against SIG officers and directors, including
petitioner, in the United States District Court for the District of New
Jersey. The New Jersey District Court severed petitioner's claims and
transferred them to the Southern District of Florida.

Opinion of the Court
and control of their enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity, in violation of $ 1962(b); engaged in the
conduct of the enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity, in violation of $ 1962(c); and, most
importantly for present purposes, conspired to commit the
aforementioned acts, in violation of $ 1962(d). With respect
to this last claim, petitioner's theory was that his injury was
proximately caused by an overt act--namely, the termination of his employment--done in furtherance of respondents'
conspiracy, and that $ 1964(c) therefore provided a cause of
action. Respondents filed a motion for summary judgment,
arguing that employees who are terminated for refusing to
participate in RICO activities, or who threaten to report
RICO activities, do not have standing to sue under RICO for
damages from their loss of employment. The District Court
agreed and dismissed petitioner's RICO conspiracy claim.
The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that a cause of action
under $ 1964(c) for a violation of $ 1962(d) is not available to
a person injured by an overt act in furtherance of a RICO
conspiracy unless the overt act is an act of racketeering.
162 F. 3d 1090, 1098 (CA11 1998). Since the overt act that
allegedly caused petitioner's injury was not an act of racketeering, see $ 1961(1), it could not support a civil cause of
action. The court held, "RICO was enacted with an express
target--racketeering activity--and only those injuries that
are proximately caused by racketeering activity should be
actionable under the statute." Ibid.5

5 Although petitioner alleged violations of $$ 1962(a), (b), and (c), the
Court of Appeals concluded that he had presented no evidence of violations of subsections (a) and (b). It therefore treated each of petitioner's
substantive RICO claims as alleging a violation of $ 1962(c). 162 F. 3d,
at 1095, n. 8. The court held that petitioner did not present evidence
regarding elements of his $ 1962(c) claims and therefore affirmed the
District Court's order granting summary judgment for respondents with
respect to those claims. Id., at 1095-1098. Petitioner does not challenge
the Court of Appeals' conclusion with respect to his claims under

$$ 1962(a)-(c).

Opinion of the Court
We granted certiorari, 526 U. S. 1158 (1999), to resolve a
conflict among the Courts of Appeals on the question
whether a person injured by an overt act in furtherance of a
conspiracy may assert a civil RICO conspiracy claim under

$ 1964(c) for a violation of $ 1962(d) even if the overt act does
not constitute "racketeering activity." The majority of the
Circuits to consider this question have answered it in the
negative. See, e. g., Bowman v. Western Auto Supply Co.,
985 F. 2d 383, 388 (CA8), cert. denied, 508 U. S. 957 (1993);
Miranda v. Ponce Fed. Bank, 948 F. 2d 41, 48 (CA1 1991);
Reddy v. Litton Indus., Inc., 912 F. 2d 291, 294-295 (CA9
1990), cert. denied, 502 U. S. 921 (1991); Hecht v. Commerce
Clearing House, Inc., 897 F. 2d 21, 25 (CA2 1990). Other
Circuits have allowed RICO conspiracy claims where the
overt act was, as in the instant case, merely the termination of employment, and was not, therefore, racketeering
activity. See, e. g., Khurana v. Innovative Health Care
Systems, Inc., 130 F. 3d 143, 153-154 (CA5 1997), vacated

sub nom. Teel v. Khurana, 525 U. S. 979 (1998); Schiffels

F. 2d 1162, 1168-1169 (CA3 1989).

II
This case turns on the combined effect of two provisions
of RICO that, read in conjunction, provide a civil cause of
action for conspiracy. Section 1964(c) states that a cause of
action is available to anyone "injured . . . by reason of a
violation of section 1962." Section 1962(d) makes it unlawful
for a person "to conspire to violate any of the provisions of
subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section." To determine what
it means to be "injured . . . by reason of " a "conspir[acy],"
we turn to the well-established common law of civil conspiracy. As we have said, when Congress uses language with a
settled meaning at common law, Congress

U. S. 322, 329 (1981).6By the time of RICO's enactment in 1970, it was widely
accepted that a plaintiff could bring suit for civil conspiracyonly if he had been injured by an act that was itself tortious.
See, e. g., 4 Restatement (Second) of Torts $ 876, Comment b(1977) ("The mere common plan, design or even express
agreement is not enough for liability in itself, and there mustbe acts of a tortious character in carrying it into execution");

common law of criminal conspiracy to define what constitutes a violation
of $ 1962(d), see Salinas v. United States, 522 U. S. 52, 63-65 (1997), a
mere violation being all that is necessary for criminal liability. This case,
however, does not present simply the question of what constitutes a violation of $ 1962(d), but rather the meaning of a civil cause of action for private injury by reason of such a violation. In other words, our task is to
interpret $$ 1964(c) and 1962(d) in conjunction, rather than $ 1962(d) standing alone. The obvious source in the common law for the combined meaning of these provisions is the law of civil conspiracy.

Opinion of the Court
Consistent with this principle, it was sometimes said thata conspiracy claim was not an independent cause of action,

but was only the mechanism for subjecting co-conspiratorsto liability when one of their member committed a tortious
act. Royster v. Baker, 365 S. W. 2d 496, 499, 500 (Mo. 1963)("[A]n alleged conspiracy by or agreement between the defendants is not of itself actionable. Some wrongful act tothe plaintiff 's damage must have been done by one or more
of the defendants, and the fact of a conspiracy merely bearson the liability of the various defendants as joint tortfeasors"). See Halberstam v. Welch, 705 F. 2d 472, 479(CADC 1983) ("Since liability for civil conspiracy depends on
performance of some underlying tortious act, the conspiracyis not independently actionable; rather, it is a means for establishing vicarious liability for the underlying tort").7

7 Justice Stevens quotes from some of the cases we have cited to
suggest that the common law allowed recovery from harm caused by
any overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy. See post, at 510-511, n. 5
(dissenting opinion). However, his quotations omit pertinent language.
When read in context, it is clear that these passages refer to harm, not
from any overt act, but only from overt acts that are themselves tortious.
Compare ibid. with Adler v. Fenton, 24 How. 407, 410 (1861) ("[I]t must
be shown that the defendants have done some wrong, that is, have violated
some right of theirs . . . . [I]n these cases the act must be tortious");
Royster v. Baker, 365 S. W. 2d 496, 499 (Mo. 1963) ("Strictly speaking,
there has been no distinct form of writ or action of conspiracy; but the

504 BECK v. PRUPIS

Opinion of the Court
The principle that a civil conspiracy plaintiff must claiminjury from an act of a tortious character was so widely accepted at the time of RICO's adoption as to be incorporatedin the common understanding of "civil conspiracy." See Ballentine's Law Dictionary 252 (3d ed. 1969) ("It is the civilwrong resulting in damage, and not the conspiracy which
constitutes the cause of action"); Black's Law Dictionary 383(4th ed. 1968) ("[W]here, in carrying out the design of the
conspirators, overt acts are done causing legal damage, theperson injured has a right of action" (emphasis added)). We
presume, therefore, that when Congress established in RICOa civil cause of action for a person "injured . . . by reason
of " a "conspir[acy]," it meant to adopt these well-establishedcommon-law civil conspiracy principles.

Justice Stevens does not challenge our view that Congress meant to incorporate common-law principles when itadopted RICO. Nor does he attempt to make an affirmative

case from the common law for his reading of the statute bypointing to a case in which there was (a) an illegal agreement; (b) injury proximately caused to the plaintiff by a
nontortious overt act in furtherance of the agreement; and(c) recovery by the plaintiff. See

post, at 508. Instead, he
argues only that courts, authoritative commentators, andeven dictionaries repeatedly articulated a rule with no meaning or application.8 We find this argument to be implausible
472, 479 (CADC 1983) (stating that civil conspiracy requires "an overt
tortious act in furtherance of the agreement that causes injury. . . . Since
liability for civil conspiracy depends on performance of some underlying
tortious act, the conspiracy is not independently actionable; rather, it is a
means for establishing vicarious liability for the underlying tort").

8 We disagree, moreover, with Justice Stevens' interpretation of the

grounds for decision in some of the cases we have cited. For example,
Justice Stevens reads Mills v. Hansell, 378 F. 2d 53 (CA5 1967) (per
curiam), and Chapman v. Pollock, 148 F. Supp. 769, 772 (WD Mo. 1957),
to deny recovery for conspiracy because the defendants had not entered
into an unlawful agreement. See post, at 508-509. We think the opinions, and the language cited from these opinions by Justice Stevens,

529US2 Unit: $U51 [09-26-01 10:31:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN

505Cite as: 529 U. S. 494 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
and, accordingly, understand RICO to adopt the common-lawprinciples we have cited. Interpreting the statute in a way

that is most consistent with these principles, we concludethat injury caused by an overt act that is not an act of racketeering or otherwise wrongful under RICO, see n. 7, supra,is not sufficient to give rise to a cause of action under

$ 1964(c) for a violation of $ 1962(d). As at common law, a
civil conspiracy plaintiff cannot bring suit under RICO basedon injury caused by

any act in furtherance of a conspiracy
that might have caused the plaintiff injury. Rather, consist-ency with the common law requires that a RICO conspiracy

plaintiff allege injury from an act that is analogous to an"ac[t] of a tortious character," see 4 Restatement (Second) of
Torts $ 876, Comment b, meaning an act that is independmake clear that recovery was denied because the defendants had committed no actionable tort, regardless of whether they agreed to commit
any such act. See ibid. Likewise, Justice Stevens reads J. & C. Ornamental Iron Co. v. Watkins, 114 Ga. App. 688, 691, 152 S. E. 2d 613, 615
(1966), to deny recovery because the plaintiff had suffered no injury.
However, in that case, the plaintiff's conspiracy claim was predicated on
several alleged torts including fraud, trespass, and malicious interference.
Ibid. While the court held that the plaintiff could not recover for conspiracy to maliciously interfere because he had suffered no injury, the plaintiff's remaining conspiracy allegations were insufficient because the plaintiff did not allege "all the elements of a cause of action for the tort the
same as would be required if there were no allegation of a conspiracy."
Ibid. Further, Justice Stevens chides us for citing cases in which the
court allowed recovery. But in two of these cases the court explicitly
grounded its decision on the fact that the plaintiff had identified an actionable independent tort on which the conspiracy claim could be based. See
Cohen v. Bowdoin, 288 A. 2d 106, 110 (Me. 1972) ("[I]f [the plaintiff's conspiracy claim] is to be upheld as stating a claim upon which relief can be
granted, it must be on the ground that the complaint sufficiently alleges
the actual commission of the separate and independent tort of defamation
against the plaintiff"); Middlesex Concrete Products & Excavating Corp.
v. Carteret Indus. Assn., 37 N. J. 507, 516, 181 A. 2d 774, 779 (1962) (holding
that the plaintiffs stated a claim for conspiracy because they alleged an
actionable tort). In short, we think that there is ample evidence of the
common-law rule we have cited.

Opinion of the Court
ently wrongful under RICO. The specific type of act that is
analogous to an act of a tortious character may depend on
the underlying substantive violation the defendant is alleged
to have committed.9 However, respondents' alleged overt
act in furtherance of their conspiracy is not independently
wrongful under any substantive provision of the statute.
Injury caused by such an act is not, therefore, sufficient to
give rise to a cause of action under $ 1964(c).10

Petitioner challenges this view of the statute under the
longstanding canon of statutory construction that terms in a
statute should not be construed so as to render any provision
of that statute meaningless or superfluous. He asserts that
under our view of the statute, any person who had a claim
for a violation of $ 1962(d) would necessarily have a claim
for a violation of $ 1962(a), (b), or (c). However, contrary to
petitioner's assertions, our interpretation of $ 1962(d) does
not render it mere surplusage. Under our interpretation, a
plaintiff could, through a $ 1964(c) suit for a violation of

9 For example, most courts of appeals have adopted the so-called investment injury rule, which requires that a plaintiff suing for a violation of

$ 1962(a) allege injury from the defendant's "use or invest[ment]" of income
derived from racketeering activity, see $ 1962(a). See, e. g., Crowe v.
Henry, 43 F. 3d 198, 205 (CA5 1995); Vemco, Inc. v. Camardella, 23 F. 3d
129, 132 (CA6) (collecting cases), cert. denied, 513 U. S. 1017 (1994). Although we express no view on this issue, arguably a plaintiff suing for a
violation of $ 1962(d) based on an agreement to violate $ 1962(a) is required
to allege injury from the "use or invest[ment]" of illicit proceeds.

10 Respondents argue that a $ 1962(d) claim must be predicated on an

actionable violation of $$ 1962(a)-(c). However, the merit of this view is
a different (albeit related) issue from the one on which we granted certiorari, namely, whether a plaintiff can bring a $ 1962(d) claim for injury flowing from an overt act that is not an act of racketeering. Therefore, contrary to Justice Stevens' suggestion, see post, at 511-512, we do not
resolve whether a plaintiff suing under $ 1964(c) for a RICO conspiracy
must allege an actionable violation under $$ 1962(a)-(c), or whether it is
sufficient for the plaintiff to allege an agreement to complete a substantive
violation and the commission of at least one act of racketeering that caused
him injury.

III
We conclude, therefore, that a person may not bring suitunder $ 1964(c) predicated on a violation of $ 1962(d) for injuries caused by an overt act that is not an act of racketeeringor otherwise unlawful under the statute.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.

It is so ordered.
Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Souter joins,dissenting.

For the purpose of decision, I assume--as I think theCourt does--that petitioner has alleged an injury proximately caused by an overt act in furtherance of a conspiracythat violated 18 U. S. C. $ 1962(d). In my judgment, the
plain language of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Or-ganizations Act (RICO) makes it clear that petitioner therefore has a cause of action under $ 1964(c), whether or not theovert act is a racketeering activity listed in $ 1961(1). The
common-law civil conspiracy cases relied upon by the Courtprove nothing to the contrary.

A "conspiracy" is an illegal agreement. There is, ofcourse, a difference between the question whether an agreement is illegal and the question whether an admittedly illegalagreement gives rise to a cause of action for damages. Section 1962(d), which makes RICO conspiracies unlawful, ad-dresses the former question;

1 $ 1964(c), which imposes civil

1 Those who participate in an illegal agreement to violate the substantive provisions of $ 1962(a), (b), or (c) have engaged in a conspiracy in
violation of $ 1962(d). See Salinas v. United States, 522 U. S. 52, 63-65
(1997). Although "[t]here is no requirement of some overt act" to violate

$ 1962(d), id., at 63, that, of course, does not mean that an agreement alone
gives rise to civil liability under $ 1964(c).

Stevens, J., dissenting
liability, concerns the latter. Section 1964(c) requires a per-son to be "injured in his business or property" by a violation

before bringing an action for damages. And because thatkind of injury only results from some form of overt act in
furtherance of the conspiracy, liability under $ 1964(c) natu-rally requires injury via an overt act.

2 But there is nothing

in either $ 1962(d) or $ 1964(c) requiring the overt act to be aracketeering activity as defined in $ 1961(1).

3

The Court's central premise is that common-law civil con-spiracy cases support the notion that liability cannot be imposed unless the overt act that furthered the conspiracy andharmed the plaintiff was a

particular kind of overt act,namely, an act of a tortious character. But the cases cited

by the Court do not support that point. First, no case citedby the majority actually parallels the Court's premise. That
is, no case involved a situation in which (a) there was anillegal agreement, (b) there was an injury to the plaintiff
proximately caused by an overt act in furtherance of thatagreement, but (c) there was a refusal to impose civil liability
because the overt act was not itself tortious.Of the dozen cases cited by the Court,

ante, at 501-503,half of them rejected liability because they did not satisfy

condition (a) above, i. e., there was either no agreement ornothing illegal about the agreement that was made. See
Satin v. Satin, 69 App. Div. 2d 761, 762, 414 N. Y. S. 2d 570(1979) (Memorandum Decision) ("Here, the only such wrongful action is pleaded against [one defendant] alone. . . . In anyevent, it is doubtful that there could here be a conspiracy
between this individual and his own corporation"); Mills v.Hansell, 378 F. 2d 53, 54 (CA5 1967) (per curiam) ("[W]e

2 Of course, under Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corporation, 503 U. S. 258, 268 (1992), the overt act must be the proximate cause
of the plaintiff's injury.

3 "[R]acketeering activity" is defined in $ 1961(1) to include a slew of

state and federal crimes such as murder, bribery, arson, and extortion.

there was no actionable tort--and not, as I have suggested, because there
was no illegal agreement or because there was no injury. See ante, at
504-505, n. 8. At best, the Court's reading only demonstrates that in
these cases the question whether the harmful overt act was a tort, on the
one hand, and the question whether there was any illegal agreement or
harm, on the other hand, are questions of overlapping substance. To the
extent that is true, however, the point does not support the Court's view.
Rather, it only proves that the cases cited do not parse out elements (a),
(b), and (c) as the Court suggests they do. Moreover, as I stated at the
outset, both the Court and I assume that there has been an illegal conspiracy in this case. If the cases the Court cites show that there was no
illegal agreement at all because there was no actionable tort, then the
cases cited by the Court simply contradict the central premise of the present case, and are therefore inapposite.

recognize that, at least in certain instances, the agreement
itself can give rise to liability for civil conspiracy.6 And of
the nine cases cited in which liability is rejected for failureto state a cause of action, four are the opinions of intermediate state courts and one is the three-page opinion of a Federal District Court--hardly strong evidence of the "widely
accepted" premise on which the Court relies. Ante, at 501.
Thus, the cases cited by the Court do not at all place its conclusion on any firm footing.

Nevertheless, based on its understanding of the common
law, the Court concludes that "a RICO conspiracy plaintiff
[must] allege injury from an act that is analogous to an `ac[t]
of a tortious character.' " Ante, at 505. Even assuming
that statement is correct, though, it is not at all clear to me
why an overt act that "injure[s]" a person "in his business
or property" (as $ 1964(c) requires) would not be "analogous
to an `ac[t] of a tortious character' " simply because the overt
act is not listed in $ 1961(1). Nor do I understand why the

stam v. Welch, 705 F. 2d 472, 487 (CADC 1983) ("[A] conspiracy requires:
an agreement to do an unlawful act or a lawful act in an unlawful manner;
an overt act in furtherance of the agreement by someone participating in
it; and injury caused by the act").

6 See Cohen v. Bowdoin, 288 A. 2d 106, 110, n. 4 (Me. 1972) ("We are

aware that in particular extraordinary circumstances there has been recognized the existence of a separate self-sufficient and independent tort of
`conspiracy,' as a substantive basis of civil liability"); Halberstam, 705
F. 2d, at 477, n. 7; W. Prosser, Law of Torts $ 46, p. 293 (4th ed. 1971) ("[I]t
now seems generally agreed . . . that there are certain types of conduct,
such as boycotts, in which the element of combination adds such a power
of coercion, undue influence or restraint of trade, that it makes unlawful
acts which one man alone might legitimately do. It is perhaps pointless
to debate whether in such a case the combination or conspiracy becomes
itself the tort, or whether it merely gives a tortious character to the acts
done in furtherance of it. On either basis, it is the determining factor in
liability"). See also Snipes v. West Flagler Kennel Club, Inc., 105 So. 2d
164, 165-167, and n. 1 (Fla. 1958), where the court upheld liability exclusively on precisely that premise.

Stevens, J., dissenting
only qualifying "tortious act" must be "an act that is inde-pendently wrongful under RICO." Ante, at 505-506 (emphasis added).And if one assumes further that the Court is correct to
say that the only qualifying " `ac[t] of a tortious character' "is "an act that is independently wrongful under RICO," the
analogy does not actually support what the Court has held.The majority holds that $ 1964(c) liability could be imposed
if the overt acts injuring the plaintiff are among those rack-eteering activities listed in $ 1961(1)--such as murder, bribery, arson, and extortion. Racketeering activities, however,are

not "independently wrongful under RICO." They are,of course, independently wrongful under other provisions of

state and federal criminal law, but RICO does not make rack-eteering activity itself wrongful under the Act. The only
acts that are "independently wrongful under RICO" are vio-lations of the provisions of $ 1962. Thus, even accepting the
Court's own analogy, if petitioner were harmed by predicateacts defined in $ 1961(1), that still would not, by itself, give
rise to a cause of action under $ 1964(c). Only if those rack-eteering activities

also constituted a violation of $ 1962(a),(b), or (c) would petitioner be harmed by "an act that is independently wrongful under RICO." And, of course, if peti-tioner were already harmed by conduct covered by one of
those provisions, he would hardly need to use $ 1962(d)'s con-spiracy provision to establish a cause of action.

* * *
The plain language of RICO makes it clear that petition-er's civil cause of action under $ 1964(c) for a violation of

$ 1962(d) does not require that he be injured in his businessor property by any particular kind of overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy. The Court's recitation of the com-mon law of civil conspiracy does not prove otherwise, and,
indeed, contradicts its own holding.For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.

513OCTOBER TERM, 1999
Syllabus

CARMELL v. TEXAS
certiorari to the court of appeals of texas,second district

No. 98-7540. Argued November 30, 1999--Decided May 1, 2000
In 1996, petitioner was convicted on 15 counts of committing sexual offenses against his stepdaughter from 1991 to 1995, when she was 12 to
16 years old. Before September 1, 1993, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann.,
Art. 38.07, specified that a victim's testimony about a sexual offense
could not support a conviction unless corroborated by other evidence
or the victim informed another person of the offense within six months
of its occurrence, but that, if a victim was under 14 at the time of the
offense, the victim's testimony alone could support a conviction. A 1993
amendment allowed the victim's testimony alone to support a conviction
if the victim was under 18. The validity of four of petitioner's convictions depends on which version of the law applies to him. Before the
Texas Court of Appeals, he argued that the four convictions could
not stand under the pre-1993 version of the law, which was in effect at
the time of his alleged conduct, because they were based solely on the
testimony of the victim, who was not under 14 at the time of the offenses
and had not made a timely outcry. The court held that applying the
1993 amendment retrospectively did not violate the Ex Post Facto
Clause, and the State Court of Criminal Appeals denied review.

Held: Petitioner's convictions on the counts at issue, insofar as they are

not corroborated by other evidence, cannot be sustained under the
Ex Post Facto Clause. Pp. 521-553.

(a) In Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 390, Justice Chase stated that the
proscription against ex post facto laws was derived from English
common law well known to the Framers, and set out four categories
of ex post facto criminal laws: "1st. Every law that makes an action
done before the passing of the law, and which was innocent when done,
criminal; and punishes such action. 2d. Every law that aggravates a
crime, or makes it greater than it was, when committed. 3d. Every
law that changes the punishment, and inflicts a greater punishment,
than the law annexed to the crime, when committed. 4th. Every law
that alters the legal rules of evidence, and receives less, or different,
testimony, than the law required at the time of the commission of the
offence, in order to convict the offender." The Court has repeatedly
endorsed this understanding, including the fourth category. Both Justice Chase and the common-law treatise on which he drew heavily cited

529US2 Unit: $U52 [09-26-01 10:36:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN
514 CARMELL v. TEXAS

Syllabus
the case of Sir John Fenwick as an example of the fourth category.
England charged Fenwick with high treason in the late 17th century,
but, under an Act of Parliament, he could not be convicted without
the testimony of two witnesses. Parliament passed a bill of attainder
making the two-witness rule inapplicable, and Fenwick was convicted
on the testimony of only one witness. Pp. 521-530.

(b) Article 38.07 plainly fits within Calder's fourth category. Requiring only the victim's testimony to convict, rather than that testimony
plus corroborating evidence, is surely "less testimony required to convict" in any straightforward sense of those words. Indeed, the circumstances here parallel those of Fenwick's case. That Article 38.07
neither increases the punishment for, nor changes the elements of, the
offense simply shows that the amendment does not fit within Calder's
first or third categories. Pp. 530-531.

(c) The fourth category resonates harmoniously with one of the principal interests that the Ex Post Facto Clause was designed to serve,
fundamental justice. A law reducing the quantum of evidence required
to convict is as grossly unfair as retrospectively eliminating an element
of the offense, increasing punishment for an existing offense, or lowering
the burden of proof. In each instance, the government refuses, after
the fact, to play by its own rules, altering them in a way that is advantageous only to the State, to facilitate an easier conviction. There is
plainly a fundamental fairness interest in having the government abide
by the rules of law it establishes to govern the circumstances under
which it can deprive a person of his or her liberty or life. Indeed, Fenwick's case itself illustrates this principle. Pp. 531-534.

(d) None of the reasons that the United States as amicus advances
for abandoning the fourth category is persuasive. It asserts that the
fact that neither Blackstone nor ex post facto clauses in Ratification-era
state constitutions mention the fourth category shows that Justice
Chase simply got it wrong. Accepting this assertion would require the
Court to abandon the third category as well, for it is also not mentioned
in any of those sources. And it does not follow from the fact that Fenwick was convicted by a bill of attainder that his case cannot also be an
example of an ex post facto law. In fact, all of the specific examples
that Justice Chase listed in Calder were passed as bills of attainder.
Nor, as the United States and Texas argue, was the fourth category
effectively cast out in Collins v. Youngblood, 497 U. S. 37, which actually
held that it was a mistake to stray beyond Calder's four categories, not
that the fourth category was itself mistaken. Pp. 534-539.

(e) Texas' additional argument that the fourth category is limited
to laws that retrospectively alter the burden of proof is also rejected.

Syllabus
The Court's decision in Cummings v. Missouri, 4 Wall. 277, nowhere
suggests that a reversal of the burden of proof is all the fourth category encompasses; and laws that lower the burden of proof and laws
that reduce the quantum of evidence necessary to meet that burden
are indistinguishable in all meaningful ways relevant to concerns of the
Ex Post Facto Clause. Texas' assertion that Fenwick's case concerns
only a reduction in the burden of proof is based on a mistaken historical premise. And its argument that the present case is controlled by
Hopt v. Territory of Utah, 110 U. S. 574, and Thompson v. Missouri, 171
U. S. 380, is also unpersuasive. Unlike the witness competency rules at
issue there, Article 38.07 is a sufficiency of the evidence rule. It does
not merely regulate the mode in which the facts constituting guilt may
be placed before the jury, but governs the sufficiency of those facts for
meeting the burden of proof. Indeed, Hopt expressly distinguished
witness competency laws from laws altering the amount or degree of
proof needed for conviction. Moreover, a sufficiency of the evidence
rule resonates with the interests to which the Ex Post Facto Clause
is addressed, in particular the elements of unfairness and injustice in
subverting the presumption of innocence. Pp. 539-547.

Opinion of the Court
General Robinson, Deputy Solicitor General Dreeben, andVicki S. Marani.*

Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court.
An amendment to a Texas statute that went into effect onSeptember 1, 1993, authorized conviction of certain sexual

offenses on the victim's testimony alone. The previous stat-ute required the victim's testimony plus other corroborating
evidence to convict the offender. The question presentedis whether that amendment may be applied in a trial for
offenses committed before the amendment's effective datewithout violating the constitutional prohibition against state
"ex post facto" laws. I

In 1996, a Texas grand jury returned a 15-count indictmentcharging petitioner with various sexual offenses against his
stepdaughter. The alleged conduct took place over morethan four years, from February 1991 to March 1995, when
the victim was 12 to 16 years old. The conduct ceased afterthe victim told her mother what had happened. Petitioner
was convicted on all 15 counts. The two most serious countscharged him with aggravated sexual assault, and petitioner
was sentenced to life imprisonment on those two counts.

*Robert P. Marcovitch and Barbara Bergman filed a brief for the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers as amicus curiae urging
reversal.

Opinion of the Court
For each of the other 13 offenses (5 counts of sexual assaultand 8 counts of indecency with a child), petitioner received

concurrent sentences of 20 years.Until September 1, 1993, the following statute was in effect in Texas:

"A conviction under Chapter 21, Section 22.011, orSection 22.021, Penal Code, is supportable on the uncorroborated testimony of the victim of the sexual of-fense if the victim informed any person, other than
the defendant, of the alleged offense within six monthsafter the date on which the offense is alleged to have
occurred. The requirement that the victim inform an-other person of an alleged offense does not apply if the
victim was younger than 14 years of age at the time ofthe alleged offense." Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art.
38.07 (Vernon 1983).1
We emphasize three features of this law that are critical topetitioner's case.

The first is the so-called "outcry or corroboration" require-ment. Under that provision, a victim's testimony can support a conviction for the specified offenses only if (1) thattestimony is corroborated by other evidence, or (2) the victim
informed another person of the offense within six monthsof its occurrence (an "outcry"). The second feature is the
"child victim" provision, which is an exception to the outcryor corroboration requirement. According to this provision,
if the victim was under 14 years old at the time of the allegedoffense, the outcry or corroboration requirement does not
apply and the victim's testimony alone can support a con-viction--even without any corroborating evidence or outcry.
The third feature is that Article 38.07 establishes a suffi1 The chapter and sections to which this statute refers cover all the
charges contained in the 15-count indictment against petitioner. Chapter
21 includes the offense of indecency with a child; $ 22.011 covers sexual
assault; $ 22.021 criminalizes aggravated sexual assault.

518 CARMELL v. TEXAS

Opinion of the Court
ciency of the evidence rule respecting the minimum quantumof evidence necessary to sustain a conviction. If the statute's requirements are not met (for example, by introducingonly the uncorroborated testimony of a 15-year-old victim
who did not make a timely outcry), a defendant cannot beconvicted, and the court must enter a judgment of acquittal.
See Leday v. State, 983 S. W. 2d 713, 725 (Tex. Crim. App.1998);

Scoggan v. State, 799 S. W. 2d 679, 683 (Tex. Crim.App. 1990). Conversely, if the requirements are satisfied,

a conviction, in the words of the statute, "is supportable,"and the case may be submitted to the jury and a conviction
sustained. See Vickery v. State, 566 S. W. 2d 624, 626-627(Tex. Crim. App. 1978); see also Burnham v. State, 821 S. W.
2d 1, 3 (Tex. Ct. App. 1991).2Texas amended Article 38.07, effective September 1, 1993.
The amendment extended the child victim exception tovictims under 18 years old.

3 For four of petitioner's counts,

2 Texas courts treat Article 38.07 as a sufficiency of the evidence rule,
rather than as a rule concerning the competency or admissibility of evidence. Ordinarily, when evidence that should have been excluded is erroneously admitted against a defendant, the trial court's error is remedied
on appeal by reversing the conviction and remanding for a new trial.
See, e. g., Miles v. State, 918 S. W. 2d 511, 512 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996);
Beltran v. State, 728 S. W. 2d 382, 389 (Tex. Crim. App. 1987). A trial
court's failure to comply with the requirements of Article 38.07, by contrast, results not in a remand for a new trial, but in the reversal of conviction and remand for entry of an order of acquittal. See, e. g., Scoggan,
799 S. W. 2d, at 683. At oral argument, Texas agreed that the foregoing
is an accurate description of Texas law. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 28-29, 32,
40-41.

3 The new statute read in full:

"A conviction under Chapter 21, Section 22.011, or Section 22.021, Penal
Code, is supportable on the uncorroborated testimony of the victim of the
sexual offense if the victim informed any person, other than the defendant,
of the alleged offense within one year after the date on which the offense
is alleged to have occurred. The requirement that the victim inform another person of an alleged offense does not apply if the victim was younger
than 18 years of age at the time of the alleged offense." Tex. Code Crim.
Proc. Ann., Art. 38.07, as amended by Act of May 29, 1993, 73d Leg., Reg.

Opinion of the Court
that amendment was critical. The "outcry or corroboration" requirement was not satisfied for those convictions; 4
they rested solely on the victim's testimony. Accordingly,
the verdicts on those four counts stand or fall depending
on whether the child victim exception applies. Under the
old law, the exception would not apply, because the victim
was more than 14 years old at the time of the alleged offenses. Under the new law, the exception would apply, because the victim was under 18 years old at that time. In
short, the validity of four of petitioner's convictions depends
on whether the old or new law applies to his case, which, in
turn, depends on whether the Ex Post Facto Clause prohibits the application of the new version of Article 38.07 to
his case.

As mentioned, only 4 of petitioner's 15 total convictions
are implicated by the amendment to Article 38.07; the other
11 counts--including the 2 convictions for which petitioner
received life sentences--are uncontested. Six counts are
uncontested because they were committed when the victim
was under 14 years old, so his convictions stand even under
the old law; the other five uncontested counts were committed after the new Texas law went into effect, so there
could be no ex post facto claim as to those convictions. See

Sess., ch. 900, $ 12.01, 1993 Tex. Gen. Laws 3765, 3766, and Act of May 10,
1993, 73d Leg., Reg. Sess., ch. 200, $ 1, 1993 Tex. Gen. Laws 387, 388.

4 The victim did not make an outcry until March 1995, more than six

months after the alleged offenses. Although the 1993 amendment to Article 38.07 extended the outcry period from six months to one year, see n. 3,
supra, the victim's outcry did not come within that time period either.
Accordingly, that change in the outcry provision is immaterial to this case.

The State argues that there is evidence corroborating the victim's testimony, so it does not help petitioner even if the old law applies. See Brief
for Respondent 4, n. 2. Before the state court, however, petitioner argued that "there was nothing to corroborate [the victim's] version of
events," 963 S. W. 2d 833, 836 (Tex. Ct. App. 1998), and that court accepted
the contention as correct for the purposes of its decision. We do the
same here.

Opinion of the Court
Weaver v. Graham, 450 U. S. 24, 31 (1981) ("The critical ques-tion [for an ex post facto violation] is whether the law

changes the legal consequences of acts completed before itseffective date"). What are at stake, then, are the four convictions on counts 7 through 10 for offenses committed be-tween June 1992 and July 1993 when the victim was 14 or 15
years old and the new Texas law was not in effect.Petitioner appealed his four convictions to the Court of
Appeals for the Second District of Texas in Fort Worth.See 963 S. W. 2d 833 (1998). Petitioner argued that under
the pre-1993 version of Article 38.07, which was the law ineffect at the time of his alleged conduct, those convictions
could not stand, because they were based solely on the vic-tim's testimony, and the victim was not under 14 years old
at the time of the offenses, nor had she made a timely outcry.The Court of Appeals rejected petitioner's argument.
Under the 1993 amendment to Article 38.07, the court ob-served, petitioner could be convicted on the victim's testimony alone because she was under 18 years old at the timeof the offenses. The court held that applying this amendment retrospectively to petitioner's case did not violate theEx Post Facto Clause:

"The statute as amended does not increase the punish-ment nor change the elements of the offense that the
State must prove. It merely `removes existing restric-tions upon the competency of certain classes of persons
as witnesses' and is, thus, a rule of procedure. Hopt v.Utah, 110 U. S. 574, 590 . . . (1884)." Id., at 836.

Opinion of the Court
phrase "ex post facto" referred only to certain types of crimi-nal laws. Justice Chase cataloged those types as follows:

"I will state what laws I consider ex post facto laws,within the words and the intent of the prohibition.
1st. Every law that makes an action done before thepassing of the law, and which was innocent when done,
criminal; and punishes such action. 2d. Every lawthat aggravates a crime, or makes it greater than it was,
when committed. 3d. Every law that changes thepunishment, and inflicts a greater punishment, than
the law annexed to the crime, when committed. 4th.Every law that alters the

legal rules of evidence, andreceives less, or different, testimony, than the law required at the time of the commission of the offence,in order to convict the offender." Id., at 390 (emphasis
in original).9
It is the fourth category that is at issue in petitioner's case.The common-law understanding explained by Justice Chase

drew heavily upon the authoritative exposition of one ofthe great scholars of the common law, Richard Wooddeson.
See id., at 391 (noting reliance on Wooddeson's treatise).10

9 Elsewhere in his opinion, Justice Chase described his taxonomy of
ex post facto laws as follows:
"Sometimes [ex post facto laws] respected the crime, by declaring acts
to be treason, which were not treason, when committed; at other times,
they violated the rules of evidence (to supply a deficiency of legal proof)
by admitting one witness, when the existing law required two; by receiving evidence without oath; or the oath of the wife against the husband; or other testimony, which the courts of justice would not admit;
at other times they inflicted punishments, where the party was not, by
law, liable to any punishment; and in other cases, they inflicted greater
punishment, than the law annexed to the offence." 3 Dall., at 389 (emphasis deleted).

A Systematical View of the Laws of England, which collected various
lectures he delivered as the Vinerian Professor and Fellow of Magdalen
College at Oxford. Though not as well known today, Justice Chase noted

Opinion of the Court
Wooddeson's classification divided ex post facto laws intothree general categories: those respecting the crimes themselves; those respecting the legal rules of evidence; andthose affecting punishment (which he further subdivided
into laws creating a punishment and those making an ex-isting punishment more severe).

11 See 2 R. Wooddeson, A

Systematical View of the Laws of England 625-640 (1792)(Lecture 41) (hereinafter Wooddeson). Those three categories (the last of which was further subdivided) correlateprecisely to

Calder's four categories. Justice Chase alsoused language in describing the categories that corresponds directly to Wooddeson's phrasing.12 Finally, in four
that Wooddeson was William Blackstone's successor, 3 Dall., at 391 (Blackstone held the Vinerian chair at Oxford until 1766), and his treatise was
repeatedly cited in the years following the ratification by lawyers appearing before this Court and by the Court itself. See, e. g., Trustees
of Dartmouth College v. Woodward, 4 Wheat. 518, 562-563 (1819) (argument of Daniel Webster); id., at 668, 676 (Story, J.); Town of Pawlet v.
Clark, 9 Cranch 292, 326, 329 (1815) (Story, J.); The Nereide, 9 Cranch 388,
449 (1815) (Story, J.); Cooper v. Telfair, 4 Dall. 14, 16-17 (1800) (arguments
of Edward Tilghman, Jared Ingersoll, and Alexander Dallas); Hannum v.
Spear, 2 Dall. 291 (Err. App. Pa. 1795); Glass v. Sloop Betsey, 3 Dall. 6,
8 (1794).

11 Specifically, in the former category Wooddeson included those laws

that make "some innovation, or creat[e] some forfeiture or disability, not
incurred in the ordinary course of law." 2 R. Wooddeson, A Systematical
View of the Laws of England 638 (1792). In the latter category, he placed
those laws that "imposed a sentence more severe than could have been
awarded by the inferior courts." Id., at 639. As examples of the former
category Wooddeson cited the bills passed by Parliament that banished
Lord Clarendon in 1669 and Bishop Atterbury in 1723. Those punishments were considered "innovation[s] . . . not incurred in the ordinary
course of law" because banishment, at those times, was simply not a form
of penalty that could be imposed by the courts. Ibid. See 11 W. Holdsworth, A History of English Law 569 (1938); Craies, The Compulsion of
Subjects to Leave the Realm, 6 L. Q. Rev. 388, 396 (1890).

12 See 2 Wooddeson 631 (referring to laws that "respec[t] the crime,

determining those things to be treason, which by no prior law or adjudication could be or had been so declared"); id., at 633-634 (referring to

footnotes in Justice Chase's opinion, he listed examples ofvarious Acts of Parliament illustrating each of the four categories. See 3 Dall., at 389, nn. *, #, ##, \Delta .13 Each of theseexamples is exactly the same as the ones Wooddeson himself
used in his treatise. See 2 Wooddeson 629 (case of the Earlof Strafford); id., at 634 (case of Sir John Fenwick); id., at
638 (banishments of Lord Clarendon and of Bishop Atter-bury);

id., at 639 (Coventry Act).Calder's four categories, which embraced Wooddeson's

formulation, were, in turn, soon embraced by contempo-rary scholars. Joseph Story, for example, in writing on the
Ex Post Facto Clause, stated:

"The general interpretation has been, and is, . . . thatthe prohibition reaches every law, whereby an act is

declared a crime, and made punishable as such, whenit was not a crime, when done; or whereby the act, if
a crime, is aggravated in enormity, or punishment; orwhereby different, or less evidence, is required to convict an offender, than was required, when the act wascommitted." 3 Commentaries on the Constitution of
the United States $ 1339, p. 212 (1833).
James Kent concurred in this understanding of the Clause:

"[T]he words ex post facto laws were technical expres-sions, and meant every law that made an act done before the passing of the law, and which was innocentwhen done, criminal; or which aggravated a crime, and

legal proof" created when only one witness was available but "a statute
then lately made requiring two witnesses" had been in effect); id., at
638 (describing "acts of parliament, which principally affect the punishment, making therein some innovation, or creating some forfeiture or disability, not incurred in the ordinary course of law"); id., at 639 (referring
to instances where "the legislature . . . imposed a sentence more severe
than could have been awarded by the inferior courts"). Cf. n. 9, supra.

13 The instances cited were the case of the Earl of Strafford, the case

of Sir John Fenwick, the banishments of Lord Clarendon and of Bishop
Atterbury, and the Coventry Act.

made it greater than it was when committed; or whichchanged the punishment, and inflicted a greater punishment than the law annexed to the crime when com-mitted; or which altered the legal rules of evidence,
and received less or different testimony than the lawrequired at the time of the commission of the offence,
in order to convict the offender." 1 Commentaries onAmerican Law 408 (3d ed. 1836) (Lecture 19).

This Court, moreover, has repeatedly endorsed this under-standing, including, in particular, the fourth category (sometimes quoting Chase's words verbatim, sometimes simplyparaphrasing). See

14 The reception given the four categories contrasts with that given
to Calder's actual holding--that the Ex Post Facto Clause applies only to
criminal laws, not to civil laws. The early criticism levied against that
holding, see, e. g., Satterlee v. Matthewson, 2 Pet. 380, 416, 681-687 (App. I)

Opinion of the Court

III
As mentioned earlier, Justice Chase and Wooddeson bothcited several examples of

ex post facto laws, and, in particu-lar, cited the case of Sir John Fenwick as an example of the

fourth category. To better understand the type of law thatfalls within that category, then, we turn to Fenwick's case
for preliminary guidance.Those who remained loyal to James II after he was deposed by King William III in the Revolution of 1688 thoughttheir opportunity for restoration had arrived in 1695, following the death of Queen Mary. 9 T. Macaulay, History ofEngland 31 (1899) (hereinafter Macaulay). Sir John Fenwick, along with other Jacobite plotters including GeorgePorter and Cardell Goodman, began concocting their scheme
in the spring of that year, and over the next several monthsthe original circle of conspirators expanded in number.

Id.,at 32, 47-48, 109-110. Before the conspirators could carry

out their machinations, however, three members of thegroup disclosed the plot to William. Id., at 122-125. One
by one, the participants were arrested, tried, and convictedof treason. Id., at 127-142. Fenwick, though, remained in
hiding while the rest of the cabal was brought to justice.During that time, the trials of his accomplices revealed that
there were only two witnesses among them who couldprove Fenwick's guilt, Porter and Goodman.

Id., at 170-171. As luck would have it, an act of Parliament proclaimed

that two witnesses were necessary to convict a person ofhigh treason. See An Act for Regulateing of Tryals in

(1829) (Johnson, J., concurring); Stoddart v. Smith, 5 Binn. 355, 370
(Pa. 1812) (Brackenridge, J.), was absent with respect to the four categories. Although Justice Chase's opinion may have somewhat dampened
the appetite for further debate in the courts, that consideration would not
necessarily have an effect on scholarly discourse, nor does it explain why
judges would be reluctant to express criticism of the four categories, yet
harbor no compunction when it came to criticizing the actual holding of
the Court.

Cases of Treason and Misprision of Treason, 7 & 8 Will. III,
ch. 3, $ 2 (1695-1696), in 7 Statutes of the Realm 6 (reprint
1963).15 Thus, Fenwick knew that if he could induce either
Porter or Goodman to abscond, the case against him would
vanish. 9 Macaulay 171.

Fenwick first tried his hand with Porter. Fenwick sent
his agent to attempt a bribe, which Porter initially accepted
in exchange for leaving for France. But then Porter simply
pocketed the bribe, turned in Fenwick's agent (who was
promptly tried, convicted, and pilloried), and proceeded to
testify against Fenwick (along with Goodman) before a grand
jury. Id., at 171-173. When the grand jury returned an
indictment for high treason, Fenwick attempted to flee the
country himself, but was apprehended and brought before
the Lord Justices in London. Sensing an impending conviction, Fenwick threw himself on the mercy of the court
and offered to disclose all he knew of the Jacobite plotting,
aware all the while that the judges would soon leave the
city for their circuits, and a delay would thus buy him a few
weeks time. Id., at 173-174.

Fenwick was granted time to write up his confession, but
rather than betray true Jacobites, he concocted a confession
calculated to accuse those loyal to William, hoping to introduce embarrassment and perhaps a measure of instability
to the current regime. Id., at 175-178. William, however,
at once perceived Fenwick's design and rejected the confession, along with any expectation of mercy. Id., at 178-

15 That Act read, in relevant part:
"And bee it further enacted That . . . noe Person or Persons whatsoever
shall bee indicted tryed or attainted of High Treason . . . but by and upon
the Oaths and Testimony of Two lawfull Witnesses either both of them to
the same Overtact or one of them to one and another of them to another
Overtact of the same Treason unlesse the Party indicted and arraigned or
tryed shall willingly without violence in open Court confesse the same
or shall stand Mute or refuse to plead or in cases of High Treason shall
peremptorily challenge above the Number of Thirty five of the Jury . . . ."

180, 194. Though his contrived ploy for leniency was unsuccessful in that respect, it proved successful in another:
during the delay, Fenwick's wife had succeeded in bribing
Goodman, the other witness against him, to leave the country. Id., at 194-195.16

Without a second witness, Fenwick could not be convicted of high treason under the statute mentioned earlier.
For all his plotting, however, Fenwick was not to escape.
After Goodman's absence was discovered, the House of
Commons met and introduced a bill of attainder against
Fenwick to correct the situation produced by the combination of bribery and the two-witness law. Id., at 198-199.
A lengthy debate ensued, during which the Members repeatedly discussed whether the two-witness rule should apply.17
Ultimately, the bill passed by a close vote of 189 to 156,
id., at 210, notwithstanding the objections of Members who
(foreshadowing Calder's fourth category) complained that
Fenwick was being attainted "upon less Evidence" than

16 This time, Fenwick's wife handled the bribe with a deftness lacking
in the first attempt. Not only was Goodman (popularly called "Scum
Goodman," see 9 Macaulay 32) an easier target, but Lady Fenwick's agent
gave Goodman an offer he couldn't refuse: abscond and be rewarded, or
have his throat cut on the spot. Id., at 195. Goodman's instinct for selfpreservation prevailed, and the agent never parted company with him
until they both safely reached France. Ibid.

of Attainder for High Treason 40 (1702) (hereinafter Proceedings) (" 'Tis

Article 38.07 is unquestionably a law "that alters the legalrules of evidence, and receives less, or different, testimony,

than the law required at the time of the commission of theoffence, in order to convict the offender." Under the law
in effect at the time the acts were committed, the prose-cution's case was legally insufficient and petitioner was entitled to a judgment of acquittal, unless the State couldproduce both the victim's testimony

and corroborativeevidence. The amended law, however, changed the quantum of evidence necessary to sustain a conviction; under thenew law, petitioner could be (and was) convicted on the victim's testimony alone, without any corroborating evidence.Under any commonsense understanding of Calder's fourth
category, Article 38.07 plainly fits. Requiring only the vic-tim's testimony to convict, rather than the victim's testimony plus other corroborating evidence is surely "less tes-timony required to convict" in any straightforward sense
of those words.Indeed, the circumstances of petitioner's case parallel those
of Fenwick's case 300 years earlier. Just as the relevant lawin Fenwick's case required more than one witness' testimony
to support a conviction (namely, the testimony of a secondwitness), Texas' old version of Article 38.07 required more
than the victim's testimony alone to sustain a conviction(namely, other corroborating evidence).

20 And just like Fenof the Treason. . . . Then this is a Law; ex post facto, and that hath been
always condemned . . .").

20 Texas argues that the corroborative evidence required by Article 38.07

"need not be more or different from the victim's testimony; it may be
entirely cumulative of the victim's testimony." Brief for Respondent 19;

Opinion of the Court
wick's bill of attainder, which permitted the House of Com-mons to convict him with less evidence than was otherwise

required, Texas' retrospective application of the amendmentto Article 38.07 permitted petitioner to be convicted with
less than the previously required quantum of evidence. Itis true, of course, as the Texas Court of Appeals observed,
that "[t]he statute as amended does not increase the punish-ment nor change the elements of the offense that the State
must prove." 963 S. W. 2d, at 836. But that observationsimply demonstrates that the amendment does not fit within
Calder's first and third categories. Likewise, the dissent'sremark that "Article 38.07 does not establish an element
of the offense," post, at 559, only reveals that the law doesnot come within

Calder's first category. The fact that theamendment authorizes a conviction on less evidence than

previously required, however, brings it squarely within thefourth category.

V
The fourth category, so understood, resonates harmoni-ously with one of the principal interests that the

Ex PostFacto Clause was designed to serve, fundamental justice.

21

see also post, at 561, n. 6 (dissenting opinion). The trouble with that argument is that the same was true in Fenwick's case. The relevant statute there required the "Testimony of Two lawfull Witnesses either both
of them to the same Overtact or one of them to one and another of them
to another Overtact of the same Treason." See n. 15, supra (emphasis
added).

21 The Clause is, of course, also aimed at other concerns, "namely, that

legislative enactments give fair warning of their effect and permit individuals to rely on their meaning until explicitly changed," Miller v. Florida,
482 U. S. 423, 430 (1987) (internal quotation marks omitted), and at reinforcing the separation of powers, see Weaver v. Graham, 450 U. S. 24,
29, n. 10 (1981). But those are not its only aims, and the absence of a
reliance interest is not an argument in favor of abandoning the category
itself. If it were, the same conclusion would follow for Calder's third category (increases in punishment), as there are few, if any, reliance interests
in planning future criminal activities based on the expectation of less severe repercussions.

532 CARMELL v. TEXAS

Opinion of the Court
Justice Chase viewed all ex post facto laws as "manifestly
unjust and oppressive." Calder, 3 Dall., at 391. Likewise,
Blackstone condemned them as "cruel and unjust," 1 Com-mentaries on the Laws of England 46 (1765), as did every

state constitution with a similar clause, see n. 25, infra. AsJustice Washington explained in characterizing "[t]he injustice and tyranny" of ex post facto laws:

"Why did the authors of the constitution turn their attention to this subject, which, at the first blush, wouldappear to be peculiarly fit to be left to the discretion of

those who have the police and good government of theState under their management and control? The only
answer to be given is, because laws of this character
are oppressive, unjust, and tyrannical; and, as such, arecondemned by the universal sentence of civilized man."

Ogden v. Saunders, 12 Wheat. 213, 266 (1827).
In short, the Ex Post Facto Clause was designed as "an additional bulwark in favour of the personal security of the subject," Calder, 3 Dall., at 390 (Chase, J.), to protect against"the favorite and most formidable instruments of tyranny,"

The Federalist No. 84, p. 512 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton), that were "often used to effect the most detestable pur-poses,"

Calder, 3 Dall., at 396 (Paterson, J.).
Calder's fourth category addresses this concern precisely.A law reducing the quantum of evidence required to convict

an offender is as grossly unfair as, say, retrospectively elimi-nating an element of the offense, increasing the punishment
for an existing offense, or lowering the burden of proof(see

infra, at 540-544). In each of these instances, the government subverts the presumption of innocence by reducing
the number of elements it must prove to overcome that presumption; by threatening such severe punishment so as to
induce a plea to a lesser offense or a lower sentence; or by
making it easier to meet the threshold for overcoming the
presumption. Reducing the quantum of evidence necessary

533Cite as: 529 U. S. 513 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
to meet the burden of proof is simply another way of achieving the same end.22 All of these legislative changes, in a
sense, are mirror images of one another. In each instance,
the government refuses, after the fact, to play by its own
rules, altering them in a way that is advantageous only to
the State, to facilitate an easier conviction. There is plainly
a fundamental fairness interest, even apart from any claim
of reliance or notice, in having the government abide by the
rules of law it establishes to govern the circumstances under
which it can deprive a person of his or her liberty or life.23

Indeed, Fenwick's case is itself an illustration of this principle. Fenwick could claim no credible reliance interest in
the two-witness statute, as he could not possibly have known
that only two of his fellow conspirators would be able to
testify as to his guilt, nor that he would be successful in
bribing one of them to leave the country. Nevertheless,
Parliament had enacted the two-witness law, and there was

22 Lowering the burden of persuasion, to be sure, is not precisely the
same thing as lowering (as a matter of law) the amount of evidence necessary to meet that burden. But it does not follow, as the dissent appears
to think, that only the former subverts the presumption of innocence.
Post, at 560-561 (opinion of Ginsburg, J.).

23 We do not mean to say that every rule that has an effect on whether

a defendant can be convicted implicates the Ex Post Facto Clause. Ordinary rules of evidence, for example, do not violate the Clause. See infra,
at 543-547. Rules of that nature are ordinarily evenhanded, in the sense
that they may benefit either the State or the defendant in any given case.
More crucially, such rules, by simply permitting evidence to be admitted
at trial, do not at all subvert the presumption of innocence, because they
do not concern whether the admissible evidence is sufficient to overcome
the presumption. Therefore, to the extent one may consider changes to
such laws as "unfair" or "unjust," they do not implicate the same kind
of unfairness implicated by changes in rules setting forth a sufficiency of
the evidence standard. Moreover, while the principle of unfairness helps
explain and shape the Clause's scope, it is not a doctrine unto itself, invalidating laws under the Ex Post Facto Clause by its own force. Cf. W. S.
Kirkpatrick & Co. v. Environmental Tectonics Corp., Int'l, 493 U. S. 400,
409 (1990).

534 CARMELL v. TEXAS

Opinion of the Court
a profound unfairness in Parliament's retrospectively altering the very rules it had established, simply because those
rules prevented the conviction of the traitor--notwithstanding the fact that Fenwick could not truly claim to be "innocent." (At least one historian has concluded that his guilt
was clearly established, see 9 Macaulay 203-204, and the debate in the House of Commons bears out that conclusion,
see, e. g., Proceedings 219, 230, 246, 265, 289.) Moreover, the
pertinent rule altered in Fenwick's case went directly to
the general issue of guilt, lowering the minimum quantum
of evidence required to obtain a conviction. The Framers,
quite clearly, viewed such maneuvers as grossly unfair, and
adopted the Ex Post Facto Clause accordingly.24

VI
The United States as amicus asks us to revisit the accuracy of the fourth category as an original matter. None
of its reasons for abandoning the category is persuasive.

24 Fenwick's case also illustrates how such ex post facto laws can operate similarly to retrospective increases in punishment by adding to the
coercive pressure to accept a plea bargain. When Fenwick was first
brought before the Lord Justices, he was given an opportunity to make
a confession to the King. Though he squandered the opportunity by authoring a plain contrivance, Fenwick could have reasonably assumed that
a sincere confession would have been rewarded with leniency--the functional equivalent of a plea bargain. See 9 Macaulay 125. When the bill
of attainder was taken up by the House of Commons, there is evidence
that this was done to pressure Fenwick into making the honest confession
he had failed to make before. See, e. g., Proceedings 197 (" 'Tis a Matter
of Blood, 'tis true, but I do not aim at this Gentleman's Life in it . . . all
I Propose by it, is to get his Confession"); id., at 235 ("[W]e do not aim at
Sir John Fenwick's Blood, (God forbid we should) but at his Confession");
id., at 255 ("Why, give me leave to say to you, 'tis a new way not known
in England, that you will Hang a Man unless he will Confess or give
Evidence . . ."). And before the House of Lords, Fenwick was explicitly
threatened that unless he confessed, they would proceed to consider the
bill against him. 9 Macaulay 218.

Opinion of the Court
First, pointing to Blackstone's Commentaries and a hand-ful of state constitutions cited by Justice Chase in Calder,

see 3 Dall., at 391-392, the United States asserts that JusticeChase simply got it wrong with his four categories. Blackstone wrote: "There is still a more unreasonable methodthan this, which is called making of laws ex post facto; when
after an action is committed, the legislator then for the firsttime declares it to have been a crime, and inflicts a punishment upon the person who has committed it . . . ."1 Commentaries on the Laws of England, at 46 (emphasis
in original). The ex post facto clauses in Ratification-erastate constitutions to which Justice Chase cited are of a
piece.25 The United States directs our attention to the factthat none of these definitions mentions Justice Chase's
fourth category.All of these sources, though, are perfectly consistent with
Justice Chase's first category of ex post facto laws. None ofthem is incompatible with his four-category formulation, unless we accept the premise that Blackstone and the stateconstitutions purported to express the exclusive definition of
an ex post facto law. Yet none appears to do so on its face.And if those definitions were read as exclusive, the United

25 Massachusetts' clause read as follows: "Laws made to punish for actions done before the existence of such laws, and which have not been
declared crimes by preceding laws, are unjust, oppressive, and inconsistent with the fundamental principles of a free government." Constitution
of Massachusetts, Pt. I, Art. 24 (1780), in 5 W. Swindler, Sources and Documents of United States Constitutions 95 (1975) (hereinafter Swindler).
The Constitutions of Maryland and North Carolina used identical words:
"That retrospective laws, punishing facts committed before the existence
of such laws, and by them only declared criminal, are oppressive, unjust,
and incompatible with liberty; wherefore no ex post facto law ought to be
made." Maryland Constitution, A Declaration of Rights, Art. 15 (1776),
in 4 Swindler 373; North Carolina Constitution, A Declaration of Rights,
Art. 24 (1776), in 7 Swindler 403. And Delaware's Declaration of Rights
and Fundamental Rules, Art. 11 (1776), in 2 Swindler 198, stated, "That
retrospective Laws, punishing Offenses committed before the Existence
of such Laws, are oppressive and unjust and ought not to be made."

536 CARMELL v. TEXAS

Opinion of the Court
States' argument would run up against a more troubling obstacle, namely, that neither Blackstone nor the state constitutions mention Calder's third category either (increases in
punishment). The United States, in effect, asks us to abandon two of Calder's categories based on the unsupported
supposition that the Blackstonian and state constitutional
definitions were exclusive, and upon the implicit premise that
neither Wooddeson, Chase, Story, Kent, nor subsequent
courts (state and federal) realized that was so. We think
that simply stating the nature of the request demonstrates
why it must be rejected.26

Next, the United States contends Justice Chase was mistaken to cite the case of Sir John Fenwick as an example of an ex post facto law, because it was actually a bill of
attainder. Fenwick was indeed convicted by a bill of attainder, but it does not follow that his case cannot also be
an example of an ex post facto law. Clearly, Wooddeson
thought it was, see 2 Wooddeson 641, as did the House of
Commons, see n. 19, supra, and we are aware of no rule
stating that a single historical event can explain one, but
not two, constitutional Clauses (actually, three Clauses, see
Art. III, $ 3 (Treason Clause)). We think the United States'
observation simply underscores the kinship between bills
of attainder and ex post facto laws, see Nixon v. Administrator of General Services, 433 U. S. 425, 468, n. 30 (1977);
United States v. Lovett, 328 U. S. 303, 323 (1946) (Frankfurter, J., concurring); see also Z. Chafee, Three Human
Rights in the Constitution of 1787, pp. 92-93 (1956) (herein26 Nor does it help much to cite Justice Iredell's statement that ex post
facto laws include those that "inflict a punishment for any act, which was
innocent at the time it was committed; [or] increase the degree of punishment previously denounced for any specific offence," Calder v. Bull,
3 Dall. 386, 400 (1798). The argument still requires us to believe that
Justice Iredell--and only Justice Iredell--got it right, and that all other
authorities (now including Blackstone and the state constitutions) somehow missed the point.

Opinion of the Court
after Chafee), which may explain why the Framers twiceplaced their respective prohibitions adjacent to one another.

And if the United States means to argue that category fourshould be abandoned because its illustrative example was a
bill of attainder, this would prove entirely too much, becauseall of the specific examples listed by Justice Chase were
passed as bills of attainder.27Finally, both Texas and the United States argue that we
have already effectively cast out the fourth category in Collins v. Youngblood, 497 U. S. 37 (1990). Collins held no suchthing. That case began its discussion of the Ex Post Facto

Clause by quoting verbatim Justice Chase's "now familiaropinion in Calder" and his four-category definition. Id., at
41-42. After noting that "[e]arly opinions of the Court por-trayed this as an exclusive definition of ex post facto laws,"
id., at 42, the Court then quoted from our opinion in Beazellv. Ohio, 269 U. S. 167 (1925):

" `It is settled, by decisions of this Court so well knownthat their citation may be dispensed with, that any statute which punishes as a crime an act previously com-mitted, which was innocent when done; which makes
more burdensome the punishment for a crime, after itscommission, or which deprives one charged with crime
of any defense available according to law at the timewhen the act was committed, is prohibited as

ex post

27 See An Act for the Attainder of Thomas Earle of Strafford of High
Treason, 16 Car. I, ch. 38 (1640), in 5 Statutes of the Realm 177 (reprint
1963); An Act for Banishing and Disenabling the Earl of Clarendon, 19 &
20 Car. II, ch. 2 (1667-1668), in 5 Statutes of the Realm, at 628; An Act

bills against the Earl of Clarendon and Bishop Atterbury appear to be
bills of pains and penalties, see Chafee 117, 136, as does the Coventry Act,
see 2 Wooddeson 638-639, those are simply a subspecies of bills of attainder, the only difference being that the punishment was something less
than death. See Drehman v. Stifle, 8 Wall. 595, 601 (1870).

Opinion of the Court
facto.' " Collins, 497 U. S., at 42 (quoting Beazell, 269
U. S., at 169-170).

Collins then observed in a footnote: "The Beazell definition
omits the reference by Justice Chase in Calder v. Bull, to
alterations in the `legal rules of evidence.' As cases subsequent to Calder make clear, this language was not intended
to prohibit the application of new evidentiary rules in trials
for crimes committed before the changes." 497 U. S., at 43,
n. 3 (citations omitted). Collins then commented that "[t]he
Beazell formulation is faithful to our best knowledge of the
original understanding of the Ex Post Facto Clause." Id.,
at 43.

It seems most accurate to say that Collins is rather
cryptic. While calling Calder's four categories the "exclusive definition" of ex post facto laws, it also calls Beazell's
definition a "faithful" rendition of the "original understanding" of the Clause, even though that quotation omitted category four. And while Collins quotes a portion of Beazell
omitting the fourth category, the immediately preceding
paragraph in Beazell explains that the law at issue in that
case did not change "[t]he quantum and kind of proof required to establish guilt," 269 U. S., at 170, a statement distinguishing, rather than overruling, Calder's fourth category.

If Collins had intended to resurrect a long forgotten original understanding of the Ex Post Facto Clause shorn of the
fourth category, we think it strange that it would have done
so in a footnote. Stranger still would be its reliance on a
single case from 1925, which did not even implicate, let alone
purport to overrule, the fourth category, and which did not
even mention Fenwick's case. But this Court does not discard longstanding precedent in this manner. Further still,
Collins itself expressly overruled two of our prior cases;
if the Court that day were intent on overruling part of
Calder as well, it surely would have said so directly, rather
than act in such an ambiguous manner.

539Cite as: 529 U. S. 513 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
The better understanding of Collins' discussion of the
Ex Post Facto Clause is that it eliminated a doctrinal hitch
that had developed in our cases, which purported to define
the scope of the Clause along an axis distinguishing between laws involving "substantial protections" and those
that are merely "procedural." Both Kring v. Missouri, 107
U. S. 221 (1883), and Thompson v. Utah, 170 U. S. 343
(1898)--the two cases Collins overruled--relied on just
that distinction. In overruling them, the Court correctly
pointed out, "the prohibition which may not be evaded is
the one defined by the Calder categories." 497 U. S., at 46.
Accordingly, Collins held that it was a mistake to stray beyond Calder's four categories, not that the fourth category
was itself mistaken.28

VII

Texas next argues that even if the fourth category exists,
it is limited to laws that retrospectively alter the burden
of proof (which Article 38.07 does not do). See also post, at
572 (dissenting opinion). It comes to this conclusion on the
basis of two pieces of evidence. The first is our decision in
Cummings v. Missouri, 4 Wall. 277 (1867). The second concerns Texas' historical understanding of Fenwick's case.

28 The dissent would have us dismiss our numerous and repeated invocations of the fourth category, see supra, at 525, because they were merely
"mechanical . . . recitation[s]" in cases that did not depend on the fourth
category. Post, at 568. Instead, the dissent would glean original meaning from Beazell v. Ohio, 269 U. S. 167 (1925), and Collins v. Youngblood,
497 U. S. 37 (1990). Post, at 567-568. First of all, the dissent is factually
mistaken; Cummings v. Missouri, 4 Wall. 277 (1867), relied on the fourth
category in invalidating the laws at issue there. See infra this page and
540-541. And Hopt v. Territory of Utah, 110 U. S. 574 (1884) (discussed
infra, at 542-547), specifically distinguished category four. See post, at
570-571 ("Hopt . . . retain[ed] Calder's fourth category"). Second, as
mentioned above, neither Beazell nor Collins relied on the fourth category,
so it is not apparent why the dissent would place so much emphasis on
those two cases that did not depend on category four.

540 CARMELL v. TEXAS

Opinion of the Court
Cummings v. Missouri addressed an ex post facto chal-lenge to certain amendments to the Missouri State Constitution made in 1865. When read together, those amend-ments listed a series of acts deemed criminal (all dealing
with the giving of aid or comfort to anyone engaged in armedhostility against the United States), and then declared that
unless a person engaged in certain professions (e. g., lawyers
and clergymen) swore an oath of loyalty, he "shall, on con-viction [for failing to swear the oath], be punished" by a fine,

imprisonment, or both. Id., at 279-281. We held that theseprovisions violated the

Ex Post Facto Clause.
Writing for the Court, Justice Field first observed that
"[b]y an ex post facto law is meant one which imposes a punishment for an act which was not punishable at the time it
was committed; or imposes additional punishment to that
then prescribed; or changes the rules of evidence by which
less or different testimony is sufficient to convict than was
then required." Id., at 325-326. The Court then held
the amendments violated the Ex Post Facto Clause in all
these respects: some of the offenses deemed criminal by
the amendments were not criminal acts before then, id., at
327-328; other acts were previously criminal, but now they
carried a greater criminal sanction, id., at 328; and, most
importantly for present purposes, the amendments permitted conviction on less testimony than was previously
sufficient, because they "subvert the presumptions of innocence, and alter the rules of evidence, which heretofore,
under the universally recognized principles of the common
law, have been supposed to be fundamental and unchangeable," ibid. The Court continued: "They assume that the
parties are guilty; they call upon the parties to establish
their innocence; and they declare that such innocence can be
shown only in one way--by an inquisition, in the form of an
expurgatory oath, into the consciences of the parties." Ibid.

It is correct that Cummings held Missouri's constitutional
amendments invalid under the fourth category because

529US2 Unit: $U52 [09-26-01 10:36:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN

541Cite as: 529 U. S. 513 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
they reversed the burden of proof. But Cummings nowheresuggests that a reversal of the burden of proof is all the

fourth category encompasses. And we think there is nogood reason to draw a line between laws that lower the
burden of proof and laws that reduce the quantum of evi-dence necessary to meet that burden; the two types of laws
are indistinguishable in all meaningful ways relevant toconcerns of the

Ex Post Facto Clause. See supra, at 530-534; see also Cummings, 4 Wall., at 325 ("The legal result

must be the same, for what cannot be done directly cannotbe done indirectly. The Constitution deals with substance,
not shadows").As for Texas' second piece of evidence, it asserts that the
law in Fenwick's case, requiring two witnesses to convict aperson for high treason, traces its origins to the ancient
Roman law concept known as the "rule of number," underwhich "the probative value of testimony would be increased if others testifying to the same facts swore anoath." Brief for Respondent 20. The "less testimony" to
which Fenwick's case refers, the argument runs, concernslowering the probative value required to convict,

i. e., a re-duction in the burden of proof.

Even if that historical argument were correct, the sameresponse to Texas' Cummings-based argument is applicable.
But we think the historical premise is mistaken. If the tes-timony of one witness rather than two truly reflected a less
credible showing, and if the House of Commons truly thoughtit labored under a lesser burden of proof, then one would
expect some sort of reference to that in Fenwick's case. Yetthe few direct references to the burden of proof that were
made during the debates are to the contrary; they indicatesomething roughly the equivalent of a beyond-a-reasonabledoubt standard.29 And at least one Member expressly de29 See, e. g., Proceedings 75 ("If upon what I hear, I am of Opinion, he

clared that the number of witnesses testifying bore norelationship to the overall credibility of the Crown's case.

It also appears that "[a]fter the middle of the 1600s therenever was any doubt that the common law of England in

jury trials rejected entirely" the Roman law concept of therule of number. Wigmore, Required Numbers of Witnesses;
A Brief History of the Numerical System in England, 15Harv. L. Rev. 83, 93 (1901). Though the treason statute at
issue in Fenwick's case, and related antecedent acts, havea superficial resemblance to the rule of number, those acts
in fact reflected a concern with prior monarchical abusesrelating to the specific crime of treason, rather than any
vestigial belief that the number of witnesses is a proxy forprobative value.

Id., at 100-101; see also 7 J. Wigmore,Evidence $ 2037, pp. 353-354 (J. Chadbourn rev. 1978).

Texas argues (following the holding of the Texas Courtof Appeals) that the present case is controlled by Hopt v.

Territory of Utah, 110 U. S. 574 (1884), and Thompson v.
Missouri, 171 U. S. 380 (1898). In Hopt, the defendant wasconvicted of murder. At trial, the prosecution introduced

the testimony of a convicted felon that tended to inculpatethe defendant. Hopt objected to the competency of the witness on the basis of a law in place at the time of the allegedmurder, which stated: " `[T]he rules for determining the competency of witnesses in civil actions are applicable also tocriminal actions . . . .' " The relevant civil rules, in turn,
specified that " `all persons, without exception, . . . may bewitnesses in any action or proceeding,' " but " `persons
against whom judgment has been rendered upon a conviction
[where you doubt, do nothing], I shall not be for it . . ."). See also Coffin
v. United States, 156 U. S. 432, 456 (1895).

30 "[O]ne single Witness, if credited by Twelve Jury-men, is sufficient;

and an Hundred Witnesses, if not so credited, is not sufficient to Convict
a Person of a Capital Crime." Proceedings 210; see also id., at 223-226.

for felony . . . shall not be witnesses.' " 110 U. S., at 587-588.After the date of the alleged offense, but prior to defendant's

trial, the last provision (excluding convicted felons frombeing witnesses) was repealed.

The defendant argued that the retrospective application ofthe felon witness-competency provision violated the Ex Post
Facto Clause. Because of the emphasis the parties (and thedissent) have placed on

Hopt, it is worth quoting at lengththis Court's explanation for why it rejected the defendant's

argument:

"Statutes which simply enlarge the class of persons whomay be competent to testify in criminal cases are not

ex post facto in their application to prosecutions forcrimes committed prior to their passage; for they do
not attach criminality to any act previously done, andwhich was innocent when done; nor aggravate any crime
theretofore committed; nor provide a greater punish-ment therefor than was prescribed at the time of its
commission; nor do they alter the degree, or lessen the
amount or measure, of the proof which was made neces-sary to conviction when the crime was committed.

"The crime for which the present defendant wasindicted, the punishment prescribed therefor, and the
quantity or the degree of proof necessary to establish
his guilt, all remained unaffected by the subsequentstatute. Any statutory alteration of the legal rules of

evidence which would authorize conviction upon lessproof, in amount or degree, than was required when
the offence was committed, might, in respect of thatoffence, be obnoxious to the constitutional inhibition
upon ex post facto laws. But alterations which do notincrease the punishment, nor change the ingredients of
the offence or the ultimate facts necessary to establishguilt, but--leaving untouched the nature of the crime
and the amount or degree of proof essential to convic-tion--only remove existing restrictions upon the compe529US2 Unit: $U52 [09-26-01 10:36:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
tency of certain classes of persons as witnesses, relate
to modes of procedure only, in which no one can be
said to have a vested right, and which the State, upon
grounds of public policy, may regulate at pleasure.
Such regulations of the mode in which the facts constituting guilt may be placed before the jury, can be
made applicable to prosecutions or trials thereafter had,
without reference to the date of the commission of the
offence charged." Id., at 589-590 (emphases added).

Thompson v. Missouri, also relied upon by Texas, involved
a similar ex post facto challenge to the retrospective application of a law permitting the introduction of expert handwriting testimony as competent evidence, where the rule
in place at the time of the offense did not permit such evidence to be introduced. Mainly on the authority of Hopt,
the Court rejected Thompson's ex post facto challenge as
well.

Texas' reliance on Hopt is misplaced. Article 38.07 is
simply not a witness competency rule.31 It does not "simply enlarge the class of persons who may be competent to
testify," and it does not "only remove existing restrictions
upon the competency of certain classes of persons as witnesses." 110 U. S., at 589-590. Both before and after the
amendment, the victim's testimony was competent evidence.
Texas Rule of Criminal Evidence 601(a) already prescribes
that "[e]very person is competent to be a witness except
as otherwise provided in these rules," and Rule 601(a)(2)
already contains its own provision respecting child wit31 We recognize that the Court of Appeals stated Article 38.07 "merely
`removes existing restrictions upon the competency of certain classes of
persons as witnesses,' " 963 S. W. 2d, at 836 (quoting Hopt, 110 U. S., at
590); see supra, at 520. Whether a state law is properly characterized as
falling under the Ex Post Facto Clause, however, is a federal question
we determine for ourselves. Cf. Lindsey v. Washington, 301 U. S. 397,
400 (1937).

Opinion of the Court
nesses.32 As explained earlier, see supra, at 517-518, 531-533, Article 38.07 is a sufficiency of the evidence rule. As

such, it does not merely "regulat[e] . . . the mode in whichthe facts constituting guilt may be placed before the jury,"
(Rule 601(a) already does that), but governs the sufficiencyof those facts for meeting the burden of proof. Indeed, Hopt
expressly distinguished witness competency laws from thoselaws that "alter the degree, or lessen the amount or measure,
of the proof which was made necessary to conviction whenthe crime was committed." 110 U. S., at 589; see also

id.,at 590 (felon witness law "leav[es] untouched . . . the amount

or degree of proof essential to conviction").It is profitable, in this respect, to compare the statutes in
Hopt and Thompson with the text of Article 38.07. The lawin Hopt proscribed a " `rul[e] for determining the competency
of witnesses' " that stated " `persons . . . convict[ed of a]felony . . . shall not be witnesses.' " 110 U. S., at 587-588.
The statute in Thompson, similarly, specified that " `com-parison of a disputed writing . . . shall be permitted to be
made by witnesses, and such writings . . . may be submittedto the court and jury as evidence.' " 171 U. S., at 381. Article 38.07, however, speaks in terms of whether "[a] convic32 That subsection contains an exception for "[c]hildren or other persons who, after being examined by the court, appear not to possess sufficient intellect to relate transactions with respect to which they are
interrogated."

It is also worth observing that before 1986, Rule 601(a) was codified as
Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 38.06 (Vernon 1979)--the section immediately preceding the law at issue in this case. (The provision then
read: "All persons are competent to testify in criminal cases," and contained a similar exception for child witnesses.) We think it fair to infer
that Texas was well aware of the differences in the language used in these
adjacent provisions, and understood that the laws served two different
functions. The dissent views Article 38.07 as an exception to the general
rule of former Article 38.06. It finds it logical that the exception would
be placed next to the general rule, post, at 564, n. 8, but does not suggest
a reason why it would be logical for the supposed exception to be phrased
in language so utterly different from the general rule.

Opinion of the Court
tion . . . is supportable on" certain evidence. It is Rule601(a), not Article 38.07, that addresses who is "competent to

testify." We think the differences in these laws are plain.33Moreover, a sufficiency of the evidence rule resonates with
the interests to which the Ex Post Facto Clause is addressedin a way that a witness competency rule does not. In particular, the elements of unfairness and injustice in subvertingthe presumption of innocence are directly implicated by
rules lowering the quantum of evidence required to convict.Such rules will

always run in the prosecution's favor, be-cause they always make it easier to convict the accused.

This is so even if the accused is not in fact guilty, becausethe coercive pressure of a more easily obtained conviction
may induce a defendant to plead to a lesser crime ratherthan run the risk of conviction on a greater crime. Witness
competency rules, to the contrary, do not necessarily runin the State's favor. A felon witness competency rule, for
example, might help a defendant if a felon is able to relatecredible exculpatory evidence.

Nor do such rules necessarily affect, let alone subvert,the presumption of innocence. The issue of the admissibility
of evidence is simply different from the question whetherthe properly admitted evidence is sufficient to convict the
defendant. Evidence admissibility rules do not go to thegeneral issue of guilt, nor to whether a conviction, as a
matter of law, may be sustained. Prosecutors may satisfyall the requirements of any number of witness competency

33 The dissent seems unwilling to concede this distinction. Though it
admits that under Article 38.07 the uncorroborated victim is "not literally
forbidden from testifying," post, at 563, it also insists that testimony is
"inadmissible," post, at 571, and that "the jury will not be permitted to
consider it," post, at 555, n. 3. See also post, at 557, 565 (referring to
Article 38.07 as a rule about witness "credibility"); post, at 556, 570, 575
(referring to Texas' law as a rule of "admissibility"); post, at 553, 557, 563,
564, and n. 8, 575 (referring to the law as one about "competency"). We
think it is clear from the text of Article 38.07 and Rule 601, however, that
the victim's testimony alone is not inadmissible; it is just insufficient.

Opinion of the Court
rules, but this says absolutely nothing about whether theyhave introduced a quantum of evidence sufficient to convict

the offender. Sufficiency of the evidence rules (by defini-tion) do just that--they inform us whether the evidence introduced is sufficient to convict as a matter of law (which isnot to say the jury must convict, but only that, as a matter
of law, the case may be submitted to the jury and the jurymay convict). In the words of Article 38.07, "[a] conviction . . . is supportable" when its requirements are met.

The dissent contends that Article 38.07 is not a sufficiencyof the evidence rule. It begins its argument by describing

at length how the corroboration requirement "is premised ona legislative judgment that accusations made by sexual assault victims above a certain age are not independentlytrustworthy." Post, at 556; see also post, at 557-559. But
it does not follow from that premise that Article 38.07 cannotbe a sufficiency of the evidence rule. Surely the legislature
can address trustworthiness issues through witness compe-tency rules and sufficiency of the evidence rules alike. Indeed, the statutory history to which the dissent points cutsagainst its own argument. Article 38.07's statutory antecedent, the dissent says, was a "replac[ement]" for the oldcommon-law rule that seduced females were " `incompetent' "
as witnesses. Post, at 557, 558. In 1891, Texas substituteda law stating that " `the female alleged to have been seduced
shall be permitted to testify; but no conviction shall be hadupon the testimony of the said female,

unless the same iscorroborated . . . .' " Post, at 558 (emphasis added). That

statute was recodified as Article 38.07 in 1965, was repealedin 1973, and then replaced in 1975 by another version of Article 38.07. As reenacted, the law's language changed from"no conviction shall be had" to its current language that "[a]
conviction . . . is supportable." We think this legislative his-tory, to the extent it is relevant for interpreting the current

Opinion of the Court
law, demonstrates that Texas perceived the issue of witnesstrustworthiness as

both an admissibility issue and as a sufficiency question; that it long ago abandoned its rule that vic-tims of these types of crimes are incompetent as witnesses;

and that Article 38.07 codifies Texas' sufficiency of the evi-dence solution to the trustworthiness issue.

Next, the dissent argues that under Texas' law "the prosecution need not introduce the victim's testimony at all, muchless any corroboration of that testimony."

Post, at 559. Instead, "[u]nder both the old and new versions of the statute,a conviction could be sustained on the testimony of a single

third-party witness, on purely circumstantial evidence, or
in any number of other ways." Ibid. Because other avenues of prosecution--besides the victim's testimony (with or
without corroboration or outcry)--remain available to the
State, Article 38.07 "did not change the quantity of proof
necessary to convict in every case." Post, at 560 (emphasis
added in part and deleted in part); see also post, at 561 ("Article 38.07 has never dictated what it takes in all cases . . .
for evidence to be sufficient to convict" (emphasis added)).
Accordingly, the dissent urges, more evidence (in the form
of corroboration) is not really required under Article 38.07.
See post, at 560-561, 574. It is unclear whether the dissent's
argument is that laws cannot be sufficiency of the evidence
rules unless they apply to every conviction for a particular
crime, or whether the dissent means that sufficiency rules
not applicable in every prosecution for a particular crime do
not fall within Calder's fourth category, which refers to less
testimony "required . . . in order to convict the offender."
3 Dall., at 390 (emphasis added in part and deleted in part).
Either way, the argument fails.

Fenwick's case once again provides the guide. The dissent agrees that "[t]he treason statute in effect at the time
of John Fenwick's conspiracy, like the Treason Clause of
our Constitution, embodied . . . a quantitative sufficiency
[of the evidence] rule." Post, at 573. But, it argues, Fen529US2 Unit: $U52 [09-26-01 10:36:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
wick's law and the Treason Clause are different from Article
38.07; with the first two laws, "two witnesses [were] necessary to support a conviction," ibid. (emphasis added),
whereas with Article 38.07, the victim's testimony plus corroboration is not "necessary to convict in every case," post,
at 560 (emphasis added). But a closer look at Fenwick's law
and at the Treason Clause shows that this supposed distinction is simply incorrect. Fenwick's law stated that no
person could be convicted of high treason "but by and
upon the Oaths and Testimony of Two lawfull Witnesses . . .
unlesse the Party indicted and arraigned or tryed shall
willingly without violence in open Court confesse the
same or shall stand Mute or refuse to plead . . ." See
n. 15, supra (emphasis added). And the Treason Clause, of
course, states that "No Person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the Testimony of two Witnesses to the same
overt Act, or on Confession in open Court." U. S. Const.,
Art. III, $ 3 (emphasis added). Plainly, in neither instance
were two witnesses "necessary to support a conviction," as
the dissent claims. Accordingly, its assertion that Article
38.07 "is nothing like the two-witness rule on which Fenwick
vainly relied" appears erroneous, as does its accusation that
our reliance on Fenwick's case "simply will not wash." Post,
at 573.34

The dissent's final argument relies upon Hopt and runs
something like this. The "effect" of Article 38.07, it claims,
is the same, in certain cases, as a witness credibility rule.
See post, at 559, 563-566, 575. However differently Hopt34 Perhaps one can draw a distinction between convictions based on confessions in open court and convictions based on third-party evidence and
the like (though how such a distinction would comport with the language
of the fourth category is not apparent). For example, an accused's confession might be thought to be outside of the State's control. But see n. 24,
supra. It is not clear at all, though, that the availability of evidence other
than the victim's testimony is any more within the State's control than is
the defendant's confession.

Opinion of the Court
type laws and Article 38.07 may seem to operate on theirface, in practical application (at least in certain instances)

their consequences are no different, and, accordingly, theyought to be treated alike. For example, if there were a
rule declaring a victim to be incompetent to testify unlessshe was under a certain age at the time of the offense, or
had made an outcry within a specified period of time, or had
other corroborating evidence, and the prosecution attemptedto rest its case on the victim's testimony alone without satisfying those requirements, the end result would be a judg-ment of acquittal.

Post, at 564-565. Likewise, under Article 38.07, if the prosecution attempts to rest its case on the
victim's testimony alone without satisfying the Article's requirements, the result would also be an acquittal. Thus,
Hopt-type laws and Article 38.07 should be treated the same
way for ex post facto purposes.

This argument seeks to make Hopt controlling by ignoring
what the case says. Hopt specifically distinguished laws
that "alter the degree, or lessen the amount or measure,
of the proof " required to convict from those laws that
merely respect what kind of evidence may be introduced
at trial. See supra, at 545. The above argument, though,
simply denies any meaningful distinction between those
types of laws, on the premise that they produce the same
results in some situations. See post, at 563 ("Such a victim
is of course not literally forbidden from testifying, but that
cannot make the difference for Ex Post Facto Clause purposes between a sufficiency of the evidence rule and a witness competency rule"); post, at 571 ("Hopt cannot meaningfully be distinguished from the instant case"). In short,
the argument finds Hopt controlling by erasing the case's
controlling distinction.

The argument also pays no heed to the example laid down
by Fenwick's case. Surely we can imagine a witness competency rule that would operate in a manner similar to the
law in that case (e. g., a witness to a treasonous act is not

529US2 Unit: $U52 [09-26-01 10:36:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN

551Cite as: 529 U. S. 513 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
competent to testify unless corroborated by another witness). Plainly, the imagined rule does not mean that Fenwick's case is not an example of an ex post facto law. But if
that is so, why should it be any different for Article 38.07?
Just as we can imagine a witness competency rule that would
operate similarly to the statute in Fenwick's case, the above
argument imagines a witness competency rule that operates
similarly to Article 38.07. If the former does not change our
view of the law in Fenwick's case, why should the latter
change our view in the present circumstances?

Moreover, the argument fails to account for what Calder's
fourth category actually says, and tells only half the story of
what a witness competency rule does. As for what Calder
says, the fourth category applies to "[e]very law that alters
the legal rules of evidence, and receives less, or different,
testimony, than the law required at the time of the commission of the offence, in order to convict the offender." 3 Dall.,
at 390 (emphasis deleted). The last six words are crucial.
The relevant question is whether the law affects the quantum of evidence required to convict; a witness competency
rule that (in certain instances at least) has the practical
effect of telling us what evidence would result in acquittal
does not really speak to Calder's fourth category.

As for relating only half the story, the dissent's argument
rests on the assertion that sometimes a witness competency
rule will result in acquittals in the same instances in which
Article 38.07 would also demand an acquittal. That may be
conceded, but it is only half the story--and, as just noted,
not the most relevant half. The other half concerns what a
witness competency rule has to say about the evidence
"required . . . in order to convict the offender." The answer
is, nothing at all. As mentioned earlier, see supra, at 546-
547, prosecutors may satisfy all the requirements of any
number of witness competency rules, but this says absolutely
nothing about whether they have introduced a quantum of

For these reasons, we hold that petitioner's convictions oncounts 7 through 10, insofar as they are not corroborated by

other evidence, cannot be sustained under the Ex Post FactoClause, because Texas' amendment to Article 38.07 falls
within Calder's fourth category. It seems worth remem-bering, at this point, Joseph Story's observation about the
Clause:

" `If the laws in being do not punish an offender, let himgo unpunished; let the legislature, admonished of the

35 The dissent contends that the witness competency rule "would produce the same results" as a sufficiency rule, post, at 564-565 (emphasis deleted), and above we have been willing to assume as much for argument's
sake. But the dissent's statement is not entirely correct. It would not
be the witness competency rule that would produce the same result, but
that rule in combination with the normally operative sufficiency rule.
Failure to comply with the requirements of Article 38.07, by contrast,
would mean that the evidence is insufficient to convict by the force of that
law alone. That difference demonstrates the very distinction between
witness competency rules and sufficiency of the evidence rules, points to
precisely the distinction that Hopt drew, and illustrates why (contrary to
the dissent's contention) our conclusion about Article 38.07 does not apply
to "countless evidentiary rules." Post, at 571.

That is also why the dissent's statement that we have been "misdirected" by the plain text of Article 38.07 is wrong. Post, at 564. The
dissent asserts that "any evidence" admitted under an applicable rule
of evidence could "potentially" support a conviction, ibid., and therefore
Article 38.07's explicit specification that a conviction "is supportable" if
its requirements are met does not distinguish it from ordinary rules of
evidence. Once again, we point out that whether certain evidence can
support a conviction is not determined by the rule of admissibility itself,
but by some other, separate, normally operative sufficiency of the evidence rule. The distinction the dissent finds illusive is that Article 38.07
itself determines the evidence's sufficiency (that is why it is a sufficiency
of the evidence rule), while witness competency rules and other ordinary
rules of evidence do not (because they are admissibility rules, not sufficiency rules). See also n. 23, supra.

civil liberty, essentially depend.' " 3 Commentaries on
the Constitution $ 1338, at 211, n. 2.

And, of course, nothing in the Ex Post Facto Clause prohibits
Texas' prospective application of its amendment. Accordingly, the judgment of the Texas Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not
inconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice Ginsburg, with whom The Chief Justice, Jus-

and Justice Kennedy join, dissenting.

The Court today holds that the amended version of Article
38.07 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure reduces the
amount of proof necessary to support a sexual assault conviction, and that its retroactive application therefore violates
the Ex Post Facto Clause. In so holding, the Court misreads both the Texas statute and our precedents concerning
the Ex Post Facto Clause. Article 38.07 is not, as the Court
would have it, most accurately characterized as a "sufficiency
of the evidence rule"; it is in its essence an evidentiary provision dictating the circumstances under which the jury may
credit victim testimony in sexual offense prosecutions. The
amended version of Article 38.07 does nothing more than
accord to certain victims of sexual offenses full testimonial
stature, giving them the same undiminished competency to
testify that Texas extends to witnesses generally in the
State's judicial proceedings. Our precedents make clear
that such a witness competency rule validly may be applied
to offenses committed before its enactment. I therefore
dissent.

Ginsburg, J., dissenting

* * *
Petitioner Scott Leslie Carmell began sexually abusing hisstepdaughter, "K. M.," in the spring of 1991, when K. M. was

13 years old. He continued to do so through March 1995.The specific question before the Court concerns Carmell's
sexual assault on K. M. in June 1992, when K. M. was 14.1K. M. did not inform anyone about that assault or about any
of Carmell's other sexual advances toward her until some-time around March 1995, when she told a friend and then
her mother, Eleanor Alexander. Alexander went to the po-lice, and Carmell was arrested and charged in a 15-count
indictment.Under Article 38.07 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure as it stood at the time of the assault, a conviction forsexual assault was supportable on the uncorroborated testimony of the victim if the victim was younger than 14 yearsold at the time of the offense. If the victim was 14 years
old or older, however, the victim's testimony could support aconviction only if that testimony was corroborated by other
evidence. One form of corroboration, specifically describedin Article 38.07 itself, was known as "outcry": The victim's
testimony could support a conviction if he or she had in-formed another person, other than the defendant, about the
offense within six months of its occurrence. Tex. CodeCrim. Proc. Ann., Art. 38.07 (Vernon 1983).

Article 38.07 was amended in 1993. Under the new ver-sion, which was in effect at the time of Carmell's trial, the
victim's uncorroborated testimony can support a convic-tion as long as the victim was under 18 years of age at the
time of the offense. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 38.07(Vernon Supp. 2000). The corroboration requirement con1 The Court correctly notes that Carmell's ex post facto challenge applies

tinues in force for victims aged 18 or older, with a modi-fied definition of outcry not material here. Thus, under the

version of Article 38.07 in effect at the time of Carmell'strial but not the version in effect at the time of the offense,
his conviction was supportable by the uncorroborated testi-mony of K. M. The new version of Article 38.07 was applied
at Carmell's trial, and he was convicted.2 Carmell argues
that the application of the new version of Article 38.07 to histrial violated the

$ 10, cl. 1. I

A proper understanding of Article 38.07 of the Texas Code
of Criminal Procedure is central to this case. Accordingly,
I turn first to the effect and purpose of that statute.

The effect of Article 38.07 in sexual offense prosecutions is
plain. If the victim is of a certain age, the jury, in assessing
whether the prosecution has met its burden of demonstrating
guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, must give no weight to her
testimony unless that testimony is corroborated, either by
other evidence going directly to guilt or by "outcry." 3 For
victims (such as K. M.) who were between the ages of 14 and

2 The Texas Court of Appeals did not rule on whether the State in fact
did corroborate K. M.'s testimony at trial. I note the testimony of K. M.'s
mother that when she visited Carmell in jail and told him he needed to
confess if he was sorry for what he had done, he wrote " `adultery with
[K. M.]' " on a piece of paper. 963 S. W. 2d 833, 835 (Tex. App. 1998).
That testimony might count as corroboration. Because this question is
outside the grant of certiorari, I (like the Court, see ante, at 519, n. 4) do
not further address it.

3 At first glance one might object that the statute permits the jury to

give such testimony some weight, just not enough to support a conviction.
See, e. g., ante, at 546, n. 33 (contending that under the old Article 38.07,
"the victim's testimony alone is not inadmissible, it is just insufficient").
A moment's reflection should reveal, however, that this distinction is illusory. If a particular item of evidence cannot by itself support a conviction, then the jury will not be permitted to consider it unless and until
corroborating evidence is introduced.

556 CARMELL v. TEXAS

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
18 at the time of the offense, the 1993 amendment repealedthis corroboration requirement. The amended version of

Article 38.07 thus permits sexual assault victims between 14and 18 to have their testimony considered by the jury in the
same manner and with the same effect as that of witnessesgenerally in Texas prosecutions.

This sort of corroboration requirement--still embodied
in Article 38.07 for victims aged 18 or older--is a common,if increasingly outmoded, rule of evidence. Its purpose is to

rein in the admissibility of testimony the legislature hasdeemed insufficiently credible standing alone. Texas' requirement of corroboration or outcry, like similar provisions
in other jurisdictions, is premised on a legislative judgment
that accusations made by sexual assault victims above a certain age are not independently trustworthy. See Villareal
v. State, 511 S. W. 2d 500, 502 (Tex. Crim. App. 1974) ("The
basis of this rule is that the failure to make an outcry or
promptly report the rape diminishes the credibility of the
prosecutrix."); cf., e. g., Battle v. United States, 630 A. 2d 211,
217 (D. C. 1993) (evidence of outcry "rebuts an implied charge
of recent fabrication, which springs from some jurors' assumptions that sexual offense victims are generally lying
and that the victim's failure to report the crime promptly
is inconsistent with the victim's current statement that the
assault occurred").

Legislatures in many States, including Texas, have enacted similar evidentiary provisions requiring corroboration
for the testimony of other categories of witnesses, particularly accomplices. See, e. g., Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann.,
Art. 38.14 (Vernon Supp. 2000) ("A conviction cannot be
had upon the testimony of an accomplice unless corroborated
by other evidence tending to connect the defendant with the
offense committed . . . ."). Such provisions--generally on
the wane but still in force in several States--are, like Article 38.07, designed to ensure the credibility of the relevant
witness. See, e. g., State v. Haugen, 448 N. W. 2d 191, 194

(N. D. 1989) ("The purpose of corroborating evidence is toshow that accomplices are reliable witnesses and worthy of

credit."); Holladay v. State, 709 S. W. 2d 194, 196 (Tex. Crim.App. 1986) ("Because such a witness [

i. e., an accomplice] is
usually deemed to be corrupt, his testimony is always lookedupon with suspicion.");

Fleming v. State, 760 P. 2d 208, 209-
210 (Okla. Crim. App. 1988) ("The purpose behind the requirement of corroboration is to protect an accused frombeing falsely implicated by another criminal in the hope of

clemency, a desire for revenge, or for any other reason.").I make no judgment here as to the propriety of the Texas
Legislature's decision to view the testimony of certain sexual assault victims in the same light as that of accomplices.
Ex post facto analysis does not depend on an assessment
of a statute's wisdom. For current purposes it suffices to
note that Article 38.07's corroboration requirement rests on
the same rationale that underpins accomplice corroboration
requirements: the notion that a particular witness, because
of his or her role in the events at issue, might not give trustworthy testimony. See Reed v. State, 991 S. W. 2d 354, 361
(Tex. App. 1999) ("Generally speaking, the need to corroborate the testimony of a sexual assault victim stems from the
notion that the victim, if over the age of consent, could be
an accomplice rather than a victim."); Hernandez v. State,
651 S. W. 2d 746, 751 (Tex. Crim. App. 1983) (concurring opinion adopted on rehearing) (Article 38.07's corroboration requirement "was meant to deal only with testimony of a victim of a sexual offense who, for one reason or another, was
held to be an `accomplice witness' and, perforce, whose testimony must be corroborated.").

The history of Article 38.07 bears out the view that its
focus has always been on the competency and credibility of
the victim as witness. The origins of the statute could be
traced to the fact that in Texas, "for many years a seduced
female was an incompetent witness as a matter of law."
Holladay, 709 S. W. 2d, at 200. See, e. g., Cole v. State, 40

Tex. 147 (1874); see also Hernandez, 651 S. W. 2d, at 751-752(tracing the current Article 38.07 to the earlier seduction

victim competency rule). In 1891, this common-law disabil-ity was lifted by statute and replaced by a corroboration requirement: "In prosecutions for seduction . . . the femalealleged to have been seduced shall be permitted to testify;
but no conviction shall be had upon the testimony of the said
female, unless the same is corroborated by other evidencetending to connect the defendant with the offense charged."

Tex. Rev. Crim. Stat., Tit. 8, ch. 7, Art. 789 (1911). The ap-plication of this statute to offenses committed before its
enactment was upheld by the Texas courts on the authority
of Hopt v. Territory of Utah, 110 U. S. 574 (1884). See
Mrous v. State, 31 Tex. Crim. App. 597, 21 S. W. 764 (1893).
The corroboration requirement for seduction prosecutions,
recodified in 1965 at Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 38.07,
remained in effect until 1973, when the entire 1925 Penal
Code (including the offense of seduction) was repealed.

In 1975, Article 38.07 was enacted substantially in its present form. As revised, the article covered all sexual offenses
in Chapter 21 of the Texas Penal Code; however, it contained
no express exemption from the corroboration requirement
for the testimony of the youngest victims. Tex. Code Crim.
Proc. Ann., Art. 38.07 (Vernon 1979). The exemption for
victims under the age of 14 was added in 1983, and extended
in 1993 to cover those under the age of 18, as already described. As initially proposed, the 1993 change would have
eliminated the corroboration/outcry requirement altogether.

tion; neither should Texas." Id., at 14. The historical de-velopment of Article 38.07 reveals a progressive alleviation

of restrictions on the competency of victim testimony, nota legislative emphasis on the quantum of evidence needed
to convict.The version of Article 38.07 applied at Carmell's trial was
thus, in both effect and purpose, an evidentiary rule gov-erning the weight that may be given to the testimony of
sexual assault victims who had attained the age of 14. TheCourt's efforts to paint it as something more than that are
detached from the statute's moorings and are consequentlyunpersuasive.

To begin with, it is beyond doubt that Article 38.07 doesnot establish an element of the offense. See

Love v. State,499 S. W. 2d 108, 108 (Tex. Crim. App. 1973) ("[O]utcry is

not one of the elements of the offense charged."). To con-vict a defendant of sexual assault in Texas today as before
1993, the prosecution need not introduce the victim's testi-mony at all, much less any corroboration of that testimony.
The Court is therefore less than correct in asserting that"[u]nder the law in effect at the time the acts were committed, the prosecution's case was legally insufficient andpetitioner was entitled to a judgment of acquittal, unless the
State could produce both the victim's testimony and corrobo-rative evidence."

Ante, at 530. Under both the old andnew versions of the statute, a conviction could be sustained

on the testimony of a single third-party witness, on purelycircumstantial evidence, or in any number of other ways--so
long as the admissible evidence presented is sufficient toprove all of the elements of the offense beyond a reasonable
doubt.4 And under either version of Article 38.07, of course,

Under both the old and new versions of the statute, the prosecution's evidence will not support a conviction unless it is adequate to prove all the
elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.

the accused could be convicted, like any other defendant, on
the basis of a guilty plea or a voluntary confession. Article
38.07, in other words, does not define "sexual assault proven
by corroborated victim testimony" as a distinct offense from
"sexual assault." Rather, the measure operates only to restrict the State's method of proving its case.5

And it does so without affecting in any way the burden of
persuasion that the prosecution must satisfy to support a
conviction. Under both the old and new versions of the statute, the applicable standard is proof beyond a reasonable
doubt. The amendment in 1993 that repealed the corroboration requirement for victims between the ages of 14 and 18
did nothing to change that standard.

The Court recognizes that Article 38.07 does not affect the
applicable burden of persuasion, see ante, at 539, but several
times it asserts that the amended version of the statute
"changed the quantum of evidence necessary to sustain a
conviction," ante, at 530 (emphasis added). See also ante, at
531 (amended law "permitted petitioner to be convicted with
less than the previously required quantum of evidence");
ante, at 532-533 (amended law "[r]educ[es] the quantum of
evidence necessary to meet the burden of proof " (emphases
added)). If by the word "quantum" the Court means to
refer to the burden of persuasion, these statements are
simply incorrect and contradict the Court's own acknowledgment. And if, as appears more likely, "quantum" refers to
some required quantity or amount of proof, the Court is also
wrong. The partial repeal of Article 38.07's corroboration
requirement did not change the quantity of proof necessary
to convict in every case, for the simple reason that Texas has
never required the prosecution to introduce any particular

for victims between the ages of 14 and 18 plainly did not deprive sexual
assault defendants of any defense they previously enjoyed.

number of witnesses or items of proof to support a sexual
assault conviction.6

The Court also declares several times that the amended
version of Article 38.07 "subverts the presumption of innocence." See ante, at 532; see also ante, at 533, nn. 22,
23, 546. The phrase comes from Cummings v. Missouri,
4 Wall. 277 (1867), in which the Court struck down a series
of post-Civil War amendments to the Missouri Constitution that imposed penalties on persons unable or unwilling
to swear an oath that they had not aided the Confederacy.
The amendments, the Court said in Cummings, "subvert
the presumptions of innocence" because "[t]hey assume that
the parties are guilty [and] . . . call upon [them] to establish their innocence" by swearing the oath. Id., at 328.
Nothing of the kind is involved here. Article 38.07 did
not impose a presumption of guilt on Carmell and then
saddle him with the task of overcoming it. The burden of
persuasion remained at all times with the State. See Tex.
Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 38.03 (Vernon Supp. 2000).
Carmell's presumption of innocence is thus untouched by the
current Article 38.07's recognition of K. M.'s full testimonial
stature.

The Court places perhaps its greatest weight on the "sufficiency of the evidence" label, see ante, at 547-552, but the
label will not stick. As just noted, Article 38.07 has never
dictated what it takes in all cases, quantitatively or qualitatively, for evidence to be sufficient to convict. To the contrary, under both the old and new versions of the statute the

6 Moreover, even in a case founded on the victim's testimony, the pre1993 version of Article 38.07 would permit the prosecution to corroborate
that testimony without introducing any additional evidence going to the
defendant's guilt, because corroboration could be provided by outcry,
which is hearsay and inadmissible to prove the truth of the matter asserted. See Heckathorne v. State, 697 S. W. 2d 8, 12 (Tex. App. 1985)
("[A]n outcry should not be admitted for its truth, but merely as evidence
that the victim informed someone of the offense.").

prosecution's admissible evidence will be sufficient to sup-port a conviction if a rational factfinder presented with that

evidence could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonabledoubt. The 1993 repeal of the corroboration requirement
for victims between the ages of 14 and 18 did not lower that"sufficiency of the evidence" hurdle; it simply expanded the
range of methods the State could use to surmount it.

To be sure, one might descriptively say in an individ-ual case that the uncorroborated testimony of the victim

would be "sufficient" to convict under the new version ofArticle 38.07 and "insufficient" under the old. But that cannot be enough to invalidate a statute as ex post facto. If
it were, then all evidentiary rules that work to the defendant's detriment would be unconstitutional as applied
to offenses committed before their enactment--an outcome
our cases decisively reject. See infra, at 570-571 (discussing Thompson v. Missouri, 171 U. S. 380 (1898), and Hopt v.
Territory of Utah, 110 U. S. 574 (1884), which upheld the
retroactive application of evidentiary rules governing the
authentication of documents and the competency of felons to
testify, respectively). A defendant whose conviction turned,
for example, on an item of hearsay evidence considered inadmissible at the time of the offense but made admissible by
a later enacted statute might accurately describe the new
statute as one that permits conviction on less evidence than
was "sufficient" under prior law. But our precedents establish that such a defendant has no valid ex post facto claim.
See infra, at 570-571. Neither does Carmell.

The Court attempts to distinguish Article 38.07 from
garden-variety evidentiary rules by asserting that the latter
"are ordinarily evenhanded, in the sense that they may benefit either the State or the defendant in any given case."
Ante, at 533, n. 23. The truth of this assertion is not at all
clear. Evidence is never admissible in its own right; it must
be admitted for some purpose. Rules of admissibility typically take that basic fact into account, often restricting the

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
use of evidence in a way that systematically disadvantages
one side. Consider, for example, a rule providing that evidence of a rape victim's sexual relations with persons other
than the accused is admissible to prove consent, or a rule
providing that evidence of a sexual assault defendant's prior
sexual offenses is inadmissible to show a propensity to commit that type of crime. A statute repealing either of the
above rules would "always run in the prosecution's favor . . .
[by] mak[ing] it easier to convict the accused." Ante, at
546.7 Yet no one (until today) has suggested that such a
statute would be ex post facto as applied to offenses committed before its enactment.

The Court resists the conclusion that Article 38.07 functions as a rule of witness competency by asserting that
"[b]oth before and after the amendment, the victim's testimony was competent evidence." Ante, at 544. In all but
the most technical sense that blanket statement is dubious.
If the victim was 14 years old or older at the time of the
offense (18 or older under the amended statute) and her testimony is unbolstered by corroboration or outcry, the jury
may not credit that testimony in determining whether the
State has met its burden of proof. Such a victim is of course
not literally forbidden from testifying, but that cannot make
the difference for Ex Post Facto Clause purposes between a
sufficiency of the evidence rule and a witness competency
rule. Evidence to which the jury is not permitted to assign
weight is, in reality, incompetent evidence.

7 Cf. Fed. Rules Evid. 412(a)(1) (restricting admissibility of "[e]vidence
offered to prove that any alleged victim [of sexual misconduct] engaged in
other sexual behavior"); 412(b)(1)(B) (providing that "evidence of specific
instances of sexual behavior by the alleged victim with respect to the
person accused" is admissible to prove consent); 413(a) (providing that
"evidence of the defendant's commission of another offense or offenses of
sexual assault is admissible" in sexual assault cases notwithstanding Rule
404(b)'s general prohibition on the introduction of prior bad acts evidence
"to show action in conformity therewith").

564 CARMELL v. TEXAS

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
Perhaps the Court has been misdirected by the wording
of Article 38.07, which speaks in both its old and new versions of evidence upon which a "conviction . . . is supportable." See ante, at 547. That sounds like a "sufficiency
of the evidence rule," until one realizes that any evidence
admissible in a criminal case--i. e., any evidence that a jury
is entitled to consider in determining whether the prosecution has met its burden of persuasion--is at least potentially
evidence upon which a "conviction . . . is supportable." Conversely, as I have just said, evidence to which the jury may
give no weight in making that determination is effectively
inadmissible.8

In short, no matter how it is phrased, the corroboration
requirement of Article 38.07 is functionally identical to a
conditional rule of witness competency. If the former version of Article 38.07 had provided instead that "the testimony of the victim shall be inadmissible to prove the defendant's guilt unless corroborated," it would produce the

8 It is thus no wonder that before 1986 the general rule of witness competency was codified at Article 38.06 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, and the statute now at issue immediately followed it. Article 38.07
was an exception to the general rule laid out in Article 38.06. It is logical
to put an exception right after the rule. Yet the Court draws the opposite
inference from that juxtaposition. See ante, at 545, n. 32.

The Court's related observation that Texas' general witness competency
statute "already contains its own provision respecting child witnesses,"
ante, at 544-545, is true but irrelevant. Article 38.07's corroboration requirement has nothing to do with the diminished credibility of child witnesses. Indeed, the statute has always permitted juries to credit fully
the testimony of sexual offense victims below a certain age (first 14, then
18) without any corroboration, the reason apparently being that the legislature considers victims under a certain age to be too young to consent to
sex and then lie about it. See, e. g., Scoggan v. State, 799 S. W. 2d 679,
681 (Tex. Crim. App. 1990); Hernandez v. State, 651 S. W. 2d 746, 752-753
(Tex. Crim. App. 1983) (concurring opinion adopted on rehearing). The
corroboration requirement attaches only to victims above a certain age,
and thus would not be appropriate for inclusion in a "provision respecting
child witnesses."

same results as the actual statute in every case. Not "in
certain instances," ante, at 551, or "in some situations,"
ante, at 550, but in every case.9 Recognizing this equivalency, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has noted that
the Texas accomplice corroboration rule is "a mere rule of
evidence" even though "statutorily worded as a sufficiency
standard." Malik v. State, 953 S. W. 2d 234, 240, n. 6
(1997).10

In sum, the function and purpose of the corroboration
requirement embedded in the former version of Article 38.07
was to ensure the credibility of the victim's testimony, not
otherwise to impede the defendant's conviction. Our precedents, I explain next, make clear that the retroactive repeal

9 The Court contends that the effect of Article 38.07 is distinct from
that of a witness competency rule because noncompliance with the former
dictates acquittal ex proprio vigore while noncompliance with the latter
dictates acquittal "in combination with the normally operative sufficiency
rule." Ante, at 552, n. 35. This is a distinction without a difference, because the "normally operative sufficiency rule" in question--when the
prosecution submits no admissible evidence, its case will be deemed insufficient--is a bedrock requirement of due process, applicable in every
criminal trial.

10 The Court observes that the characterization of a state law under the

Ex Post Facto Clause is a federal question. Ante, at 544, n. 31. This
undoubtedly correct observation stands in some tension, however, with
the Court's reliance on the assertion that "Texas courts treat Article
38.07 as a sufficiency of the evidence rule." Ante, at 518, n. 2. In any
event, the latter assertion is inaccurate, as Malik's discussion of the accomplice corroboration rule suggests. It is true that a trial court's failure
to comply with Article 38.07 results on appeal in the entry of an order
of acquittal. But it is not true that the remedy on appeal for the introduction of inadmissible evidence is always a remand for a new trial.
When the only evidence introduced by the prosecution is evidence that
may not be considered by a jury in determining the defendant's guilt, the
proper result is always acquittal. By the same reasoning, as this Court
decided just this Term, when a court of appeals has found that evidence
was improperly admitted in a civil trial and that the remaining evidence is insufficient, it may enter judgment as a matter of law rather than
ordering a new trial. Weisgram v. Marley Co., 528 U. S. 440 (2000).

of such an evidentiary rule does not violate the Ex Post
Facto Clause.

II

The Ex Post Facto Clause, this Court has said repeatedly,
furthers two important purposes. First, it serves "to as-sure that legislative Acts give fair warning of their effect and

permit individuals to rely on their meaning until explicitlychanged."

Weaver v. Graham, 450 U. S. 24, 28-29 (1981).11
Second, it "restricts governmental power by restrainingarbitrary and potentially vindictive legislation."

Id., at 29;
see also Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244,
267 (1994); Miller v. Florida, 482 U. S. 423, 429-430 (1987).
The latter purpose has much to do with the separation of
powers; like its textual and conceptual neighbor the Bill
of Attainder Clause, the Ex Post Facto Clause aims to ensure that legislatures do not meddle with the judiciary's
task of adjudicating guilt and innocence in individual cases.
Weaver, 450 U. S., at 29, n. 10.

The Court does not even attempt to justify its extension
of the Clause in terms of these two fundamental purposes.
That is understandable, for today's decision serves neither
purpose. The first purpose (fair warning and reliance), vital
as it is, cannot tenably be relied upon by Carmell. He had
ample notice that the conduct in which he engaged was
illegal. He certainly cannot claim to have relied in any way
on the preamendment version of Article 38.07: He tendered

11 Today's opinion apart, see ante, at 531, n. 21, this Court has consistently stressed " `lack of fair notice' " as one of the "central concerns of the
Ex Post Facto Clause." Lynce v. Mathis, 519 U. S. 433, 441 (1997) (quoting Weaver v. Graham, 450 U. S. 24, 30 (1981)). See also Landgraf v.
USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244, 266-267 (1994); Miller v. Florida, 482
U. S. 423, 430 (1987); Weaver, 450 U. S., at 28-29; Marks v. United States,
430 U. S. 188, 191-192 (1977). The implausibility of ex ante reliance on
rules of admissibility like the one at issue here helps explain why the
Ex Post Facto Clause has never been held to apply to changes in such
rules.

no reason to anticipate that K. M. would not report the as-sault within the outcry period, nor any cause to expect that

corroborating evidence would not turn up sooner or later.Nor is the Clause's second purpose relevant here, for there
is no indication that the Texas Legislature intended to singleout this defendant or any class of defendants for vindictive
or arbitrary treatment. Instead, the amendment of Article
38.07 simply brought the rules governing certain victimtestimony in sexual offense prosecutions into conformity

with Texas law governing witness testimony generally.In holding the new Article 38.07 unconstitutional as applied to Carmell, the Court relies heavily on the fourth category of ex post facto statutes enumerated by Justice Chase
in his opinion in Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 390 (1798):
"Every law that alters the legal rules of evidence, and receives less, or different, testimony, than the law required at
the time of the commission of the offence, in order to convict
the offender." Justice Chase's formulation was dictum, of
course, because Calder involved a civil statute and the Court
held that the statute was not ex post facto for that reason
alone. Moreover, Justices Paterson and Iredell in their own
seriatim opinions gave no hint that they considered rules of
evidence to fall within the scope of the Clause. See id., at
395-397 (Paterson, J.); id., at 398-400 (Iredell, J.). Still, this
Court has come to view Justice Chase's categorical enumeration as an authoritative gloss on the Ex Post Facto Clause's
reach. Just a decade ago in Collins v. Youngblood, 497 U. S.
37 (1990), for instance, this Court reiterated that "the prohibition which may not be evaded is the one defined by the
Calder categories." Id., at 46.

If those words are placed in the context of the full text of
the Collins opinion, however, a strong case can be made that
Collins pared the number of Calder categories down to
three, eliminating altogether the fourth category on which
the Court today so heavily relies. As long ago as 1925, in
Beazell v. Ohio, 269 U. S. 167, the Court cataloged ex post

529US2 Unit: $U52 [09-26-01 10:36:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN
568 CARMELL v. TEXAS

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
facto laws without mentioning Chase's fourth category at all.Id., at 169-170. And in Collins the Court cited with apparent approval Beazell's omission of the fourth category, 497U. S., at 43, n. 3, declaring that "[t]he Beazell formulation is
faithful to our best knowledge of the original understandingof the Ex Post Facto Clause: Legislatures may not retroactively alter the definition of crimes or increase the pun-ishment for criminal acts."

Id., at 43. Collins concludedby reciting in the plainest terms the prohibitions laid

down by the Ex Post Facto Clause: A statute may not"punish as a crime an act previously committed, which was
innocent when done; nor make more burdensome the pun-ishment for a crime, after its commission; nor deprive one
charged with crime of any defense available according tolaw at the time when the act was committed." Id., at 52.
This recitation conforms to Calder's first three categories,but not the fourth; changes in evidentiary rules are nowhere mentioned.12The majority asserts that the Court has repeatedly endorsed Justice Chase's formulation, "including, in particu-lar, the fourth category," and it offers an impressive-looking
string citation in support of the claim. Ante, at 525. Yetall of those cases simply quoted or paraphrased Chase's enumeration, a mechanical task that naturally entailed a recita-tion of the fourth category. Not one of them depended on
that category for the judgment the Court reached.13 Nei12 In California Dept. of Corrections v. Morales, 514 U. S. 499, 504-505
(1995), the Court similarly enumerated the categories of ex post facto laws
without mentioning the fourth category.

13 The Court in Cummings v. Missouri, 4 Wall. 277 (1867), invoked the

fourth category, see id., at 328, but that invocation was hardly necessary
to the Court's holding. In Cummings, as already noted, the Court invalidated on Bill of Attainder Clause and Ex Post Facto Clause grounds state
constitutional amendments that imposed punishment on persons unable to
swear an oath that they had not taken up arms against the Union in the
Civil War. The Court recognized that the challenged amendments,
though framed in terms of a method of proof, were "aimed at past acts,

ther did Justice Washington's opinion in Ogden v. Saunders,12 Wheat. 213 (1827), which is quoted extensively by the

Court, ante, at 532. In fact, the Court has never until todayrelied on the fourth Calder category to invalidate the application of a statute under the Ex Post Facto Clause.It is true that the Court has on two occasions struck down
as ex post facto the retroactive application of rules governingthe functioning of the criminal trial process--but both decisions have since been overruled. In Kring v. Missouri, 107U. S. 221 (1883), the Court held that Missouri was forbidden
to apply retroactively a state constitutional amendment pro-viding that a plea of guilty to second-degree murder would
not automatically serve on retrial as an acquittal of thecharge of first-degree murder. And in

Thompson v. Utah,170 U. S. 343 (1898), the Court held that a change in state

law reducing the number of petit jurors in criminal trialsfrom 12 to 8 was ex post facto because it deprived the defendant of "a substantial right involved in his liberty."
Id., at 352. The Court in Collins overruled both Kring andThompson v. Utah, concluding that neither decision was

"consistent with the understanding of the term `ex post factolaw' at the time the Constitution was adopted." Collins, 497
U. S., at 47, 50, 51-52.The Court today offers a different reading of Collins. It
concludes that Collins overruled Kring and Thompson v.Utah because those cases improperly construed the Ex Post
Facto Clause to cover all "substantial protections," andthat the fourth Calder category consequently remains intact.

and not future acts," id., at 327, for only those who had aided the Confederacy would be unable to take the expurgatory oath. The Court held that
the amendments violated Calder's first category by retroactively creating
new offenses, 4 Wall., at 327-328, and violated the third category by retroactively imposing new punishments, id., at 328. As for Calder's fourth
category, the Court said only that the amendments "subvert[ed] the presumptions of innocence" by "assum[ing] that the parties [we]re guilty."
4 Wall., at 328. As already discussed, supra, at 561, that analysis is of no
help to Carmell here.

570 CARMELL v. TEXAS

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
That is a plausible reading of Collins, and I might well beprepared to accept it, were the issue presented here. But it

is not. For purposes of this case, it does not matter whetherCollins eliminated the fourth Calder category or left it undisturbed. For even if the fourth category remains viable,our precedents make clear that it cannot be stretched to
fit the statutory change at issue here. Those precedents--decisions that fully acknowledged the fourth

Calder cate-gory--firmly establish that retroactively applied changes

in rules concerning the admissibility of evidence and thecompetency of witnesses do not raise Ex Post Facto Clause
concerns.In Thompson v. Missouri, 171 U. S. 380 (1898), this Court
upheld against ex post facto attack the retroactive ap-plication of a statute that permitted the introduction of
previously inadmissible evidence to demonstrate the authen-ticity of disputed writings. The new statute, the Court reasoned, "did nothing more than remove an obstacle arisingout of a rule of evidence that withdrew from the consideration of the jury testimony which, in the opinion of thelegislature, tended to elucidate the ultimate, essential fact
to be established, namely, the guilt of the accused." Id., at387.

The case most similar to the one before us is Hopt v. Territory of Utah, 110 U. S. 574 (1884). In that case, a statutein effect at the time of the offense but repealed by the time

of trial provided that felons were incompetent to testify.The defendant, whose conviction for capital murder had been
based in large part on the testimony of a felon, claimed thatthe application of the new law to his trial was ex post facto.
The Court rejected the defendant's claim, adopting reasoningapplicable to the instant case:

"Statutes which simply enlarge the class of persons whomay be competent to testify in criminal cases are not
ex post facto in their application to prosecutions forcrimes committed prior to their passage; for they do

not attach criminality to any act previously done, andwhich was innocent when done; nor aggravate any

crime theretofore committed; nor provide a greaterpunishment therefor than was prescribed at the time of
its commission; nor do they alter the degree, or lessenthe amount or measure, of the proof which was made
necessary to conviction when the crime was committed."
Id., at 589.

As the quoted passage shows, the Court in Hopt rejectedthe defendant's Ex Post Facto Clause claim while retaining

Calder's fourth category. The same outcome should obtaintoday, for

Hopt cannot meaningfully be distinguished fromthe instant case.

The Court asserts that "Article 38.07 plainly fits" thefourth Calder category, because "[r]equiring only the victim's testimony to convict, rather than the victim's testi-mony plus other corroborating evidence is surely `less testimony required to convict' in any straightforward senseof those words." Ante, at 530. Yet to declare Article 38.07
ex post facto on that basis is to overrule Hopt without sayingso. For if the amended version of Article 38.07 requires
"less testimony . . . to convict," then so do countless eviden-tiary rules, including the felon competency rule whose retroactive application we upheld in Hopt. In both this case and
Hopt, a conviction based on evidence previously deemed in-admissible was sustained pursuant to a broadened rule regarding the competency of testimonial evidence. The merefact that the new version of Article 38.07 makes some convictions easier to obtain cannot be enough to preclude itsretroactive application. "Even though it may work to the
disadvantage of a defendant, a procedural change is notex post facto." Dobbert v. Florida, 432 U. S. 282, 293 (1977).

In short, the Court's expansive new reading of the Ex PostFacto Clause cannot be squared with this Court's prior decisions. Rather than embrace such an unprecedented ap-proach, I would advance a "commonsense understanding of

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
Calder's fourth category," ante, at 530, one that comportswith our precedents and with the underlying purposes of the

Ex Post Facto Clause: Laws that reduce the burden of per-suasion the prosecution must satisfy to win a conviction may
not be applied to offenses committed before their enactment.To be sure, this reading would leave the fourth category with
considerably less independent effect than it would have
had in Justice Chase's day, given our intervening decisionsestablishing the "beyond a reasonable doubt" standard as a

constitutional minimum under the Due Process Clause. See,
e. g., In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358 (1970); Jackson v. Virginia,
443 U. S. 307 (1979). But it is not a reading that necessarily
renders the category meaningless even today. Imagine, for
example, a statute requiring the prosecution to prove a
particular sentencing enhancement factor--leadership role
in the offense, say, or obstruction of justice--beyond a reasonable doubt. A new statute providing that the factor
could be established by a mere preponderance of the evidence might rank as ex post facto if applied to offenses committed before its enactment. The same might be said of a
statute retroactively increasing the defendant's burden of
persuasion as to an affirmative defense.

Burdens of persuasion are qualitative tests of sufficiency.
Calder's fourth category, however, encompasses quantitative sufficiency rules as well, for Justice Chase did speak of
a law that "receives less . . . testimony, than the law required
at the time of the commission of the offence." 3 Dall., at 390
(emphasis added). Cf. Hopt, 110 U. S., at 590 ("Any statutory alteration of the legal rules of evidence which would
authorize conviction upon less proof, in amount or degree,
than was required when the offence was committed" might
be ex post facto. (emphasis added)). Quantitative sufficiency
rules are rare in modern Anglo-American law, but some
do exist. Criminal statutes sometimes limit the prosecution
to a particular form of proof, for example, the testimony of
two witnesses to the same overt act. In modern Anglo529US2 Unit: $U52 [09-26-01 10:36:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN

American law, such instances have been almost exclusivelyconfined to two contexts: perjury, see Weiler v. United

States, 323 U. S. 606 (1945), and treason, see U. S. Const.,Art. III, $ 3, cl. 1 ("No Person shall be convicted of Treason
unless on the Testimony of two Witnesses to the same overtAct, or on Confession in open Court."). See generally Wigmore, Required Numbers of Witnesses; A Brief History ofthe Numerical System in England, 15 Harv. L. Rev. 83, 100-
108 (1901).The treason statute in effect at the time of John Fenwick's
conspiracy, like the Treason Clause of our Constitution, em-bodied just such a quantitative sufficiency rule: As long as
the accused traitor put the prosecution to its proof by plead-ing not guilty, the sworn testimony of two witnesses was
necessary to support a conviction. The Court describes atgreat length the attainder of Fenwick, which served as a
cautionary model for Justice Chase's explication of the fourthcategory in

Calder. See ante, at 526-530.14 This excursioninto post-Restoration English history is diverting, but the

Court's statement that "the circumstances of petitioner'scase parallel those of Fenwick's case 300 years earlier,"

ante,at 530, simply will not wash. The preamendment version of

Article 38.07 is nothing like the two-witness rule on whichFenwick vainly relied.

First, the preamendment version of Article 38.07, unlikea two-witness rule, did not apply indifferently to all who

testify. Rather, it branded a particular class of witnesses--

14 Tellingly, the Court offers no evidence that anyone at the time of
the Framers considered witness corroboration requirements of the type
involved here to fall within the scope of the ex post facto prohibition.

15 When the Texas Legislature wants to enact a two-witness rule, it

knows how to do so. See Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 38.15 (Vernon
Supp. 2000) ("No person can be convicted of treason except upon the testimony of at least two witnesses to the same overt act, or upon his own
confession in open court."); Art. 38.18(a) ("No person may be convicted of
perjury or aggravated perjury if proof that his statement is false rests
solely upon the testimony of one witness other than the defendant.").

sexual assault victims aged 14 or older--as less competentthan others to speak in court. Second, as I have already

described, the Texas statute did not restrict the State toone prescribed form of proof. Both before and after the
1993 amendment, introduction of the victim's corroboratedtestimony was neither required nor necessarily sufficient to
sustain a conviction. Prosecutors' compliance with both the
old and new versions of Article 38.07 thus "says absolutelynothing about whether they have introduced a quantum of

evidence sufficient to convict the offender." Ante, at 547,551-552.

16 On the contrary, the only sufficiency rule applicable in Texas sexual offense prosecutions has always beena qualitative one: The State's evidence must be sufficient

to prove every element of the offense beyond a reasonabledoubt.

That should not be surprising. It makes little sense in ourmodern legal system to conceive of standards of proof in
quantitative terms. In a civil case, the winner is the party
that produces better evidence, not the party that produces
more evidence. Similarly, in a criminal trial the prosecution
need not introduce any fixed amount of evidence, so long as
the evidence it does introduce could persuade a rational factfinder beyond a reasonable doubt. "Our system of justice
rests on the general assumption that the truth is not to be
determined merely by the number of witnesses on each side
of a controversy. In gauging the truth of conflicting evidence, a jury has no simple formulation of weights and measures on which to rely. The touchstone is always credibility;
the ultimate measure of testimonial worth is quality and not

16 Noncompliance with the former version of Article 38.07 does say
something: The statute mandates acquittal if the prosecution comes forward with no evidence beyond the victim's testimony, which is deemed
unreliable standing alone. But as the Court itself recognizes, "a witness
competency rule that . . . has the practical effect of telling us what evidence would result in acquittal does not really speak to Calder's fourth
category." Ante, at 551.

quantity." Weiler, 323 U. S., at 608. If the Court wishes torely on the fourth Calder category to render Texas' altered

evidentiary rule prospective only, it should do so forthrightlyby overruling Hopt and Thompson v. Missouri, rather than
by attempting to portray Article 38.07 as a quantitative suf-ficiency rule indistinguishable from the two-witness requirement that figured in John Fenwick's case.

* * *
In sum, it is well settled (or was until today) that retro-active changes to rules concerning the admissibility of evidence and the competency of witnesses to testify cannot beex post facto. Because Article 38.07 is in both function and
purpose a rule of admissibility, Thompson v. Missouri, Hopt,Beazell, and Collins dictate that its retroactive application
does not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause. That conclusioncomports perfectly with the dual purposes that underlie the
Clause: ensuring fair notice so that individuals can rely onthe laws in force at the time they engage in conduct, and
sustaining the separation of powers while preventing thepassage of vindictive legislation. The Court today thus not
only brings about an "undefined enlargement of the Ex Post
Facto Clause," Collins, 497 U. S., at 46, that conflicts withestablished precedent, it also fails to advance the Clause's

fundamental purposes. For these reasons, I dissent.

CHRISTENSEN et al. v. HARRIS COUNTY et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 98-1167. Argued February 23, 2000--Decided May 1, 2000
The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA), 29 U. S. C. $ 201(o), permits

States and their political subdivisions to compensate their employees
for overtime work by granting them compensatory time in lieu of cash
payment. If the employees do not use their accumulated compensatory
time, the employer must pay cash compensation under certain circumstances. $$ 207(o)(3)-(4). Fearing the consequences of having to pay
for accrued compensatory time, Harris County adopted a policy requiring its employees to schedule time off in order to reduce the amount of
accrued time. Petitioners, county deputy sheriffs, sued, claiming that
the FLSA does not permit an employer to compel an employee to use
compensatory time in the absence of an agreement permitting the employer to do so. The District Court granted petitioners summary judgment and entered a declaratory judgment that the policy violated the
FLSA. The Fifth Circuit reversed, holding that the FLSA did not
speak to the issue and thus did not prohibit the county from implementing its policy.

Held: Nothing in the FLSA or its implementing regulations prohibits a

public employer from compelling the use of compensatory time. Petitioners' claim that $ 207(o)(5) implicitly prohibits compelled use of compensatory time in the absence of an agreement is unpersuasive. The
proposition that when a statute limits a thing to be done in a particular
mode, it includes a negative of any other mode, Raleigh & Gaston R.
Co. v. Reid, 13 Wall. 269, 270, does not resolve this case in petitioners'
favor. Section 207(o)(5) provides that an employee who requests to use
compensatory time must be permitted to do so unless the employer's
operations would be unduly disrupted. The negative inference to be
drawn is only that an employer may not deny a request for a reason
other than that provided in $ 207(o)(5). Section 207(o)(5) simply ensures that an employee receive some timely benefit for overtime work.
The FLSA's nearby provisions reflect a similar concern. At bottom,
the best reading of the FLSA is that it ensures liquidation of compensatory time; it says nothing about restricting an employer's efforts to require employees to use the time. Because the statute is silent on this
issue and because the county's policy is entirely compatible with

$ 207(o)(5), petitioners cannot, as $ 216(b) requires, prove that the county

Syllabus
has violated $ 207. Two other features of the FLSA support this interpretation: Employers are permitted to decrease the number of hours
that employees work, and employers also may cash out accumulated
compensatory time by paying the employee his regular hourly wage for
each hour accrued. The county's policy merely involves doing both of
these steps at once. A Department of Labor opinion letter taking the
position that an employer may compel the use of compensatory time
only if the employee has agreed in advance to such a practice is not
entitled to deference under Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources
Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837. Interpretations such as those in
opinion letters--like interpretations contained in policy statements,
agency manuals, and enforcement guidelines, all of which lack the force
of law--do not warrant Chevron-style deference. They are "entitled to
respect," but only to the extent that they are persuasive, Skidmore v.
Swift & Co., 323 U. S. 134, 140, which is not the case here. Chevron
deference does apply to an agency interpretation contained in a regulation, but nothing in the Department of Labor's regulation even arguably
requires that an employer's compelled use policy must be included in an
agreement. And deference to an agency's interpretation of its regulation is warranted under Auer v. Robbins, 519 U. S. 452, 461, only when
the regulation's language is ambiguous, which is not the case here.

for the excess hours at a rate not less than 11/2 times theirregular hourly wage. $ 207(a)(1). Although this requirement did not initially apply to public-sector employers, Con-gress amended the FLSA to subject States and their political
subdivisions to its constraints, at first on a limited basis, seeFair Labor Standards Amendments of 1966, Pub. L. 89-601,

$ 102(b), 80 Stat. 831 (extending the FLSA to certain catego-ries of state and local employees), and then more broadly, see
Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1974, Pub. L. 93-259,$$ 6(a)(1)-(2), 88 Stat. 58-59 (extending the FLSA to all state
and local employees, save elected officials and their staffs).States and their political subdivisions, however, did not feel
the full force of this latter extension until our decision in
Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469U. S. 528 (1985), which overruled our holding in National

League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U. S. 833 (1976), that theFLSA could not constitutionally restrain traditional governmental functions.In the months following

Garcia, Congress acted to miti-gate the effects of applying the FLSA to States and their

political subdivisions, passing the Fair Labor StandardsAmendments of 1985, Pub. L. 99-150, 99 Stat. 787. See
generally Moreau v. Klevenhagen, 508 U. S. 22, 26 (1993).Those amendments permit States and their political subdivisions to compensate employees for overtime by grantingthem compensatory time at a rate of 1

1/2 hours for every hour

worked. See 29 U. S. C. $ 207(o)(1). To provide this formof compensation, the employer must arrive at an agreement

or understanding with employees that compensatory timewill be granted instead of cash compensation.

580 CHRISTENSEN v. HARRIS COUNTY

Opinion of the Court
The FLSA expressly regulates some aspects of accrualand preservation of compensatory time. For example, the

FLSA provides that an employer must honor an employee'srequest to use compensatory time within a "reasonable period" of time following the request, so long as the use of thecompensatory time would not "unduly disrupt" the employer's operations. $ 207(o)(5); 29 CFR $ 553.25 (1999). TheFLSA also caps the number of compensatory time hours that
an employee may accrue. After an employee reaches thatmaximum, the employer must pay cash compensation for additional overtime hours worked. $ 207(o)(3)(A). In addi-tion, the FLSA permits the employer at any time to cancel
or "cash out" accrued compensatory time hours by payingthe employee cash compensation for unused compensatory
time. $ 207(o)(3)(B); 29 CFR $ 553.26(a) (1999). And theFLSA entitles the employee to cash payment for any accrued
compensatory time remaining upon the termination of em-ployment. $ 207(

o)(4). B

Petitioners are 127 deputy sheriffs employed by respond-ents Harris County, Texas, and its sheriff, Tommy B. Thomas
(collectively, Harris County). It is undisputed that each ofthe petitioners individually agreed to accept compensatory
time, in lieu of cash, as compensation for overtime.As petitioners accumulated compensatory time, Harris
County became concerned that it lacked the resources to paymonetary compensation to employees who worked overtime
after reaching the statutory cap on compensatory time ac-crual and to employees who left their jobs with sizable reserves of accrued time. As a result, the county began look-ing for a way to reduce accumulated compensatory time. It
wrote to the United States Department of Labor's Wage andHour Division, asking "whether the Sheriff may schedule
non-exempt employees to use or take compensatory time."Brief for Petitioners 18-19. The Acting Administrator of
the Division replied:

581Cite as: 529 U. S. 576 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
"[I]t is our position that a public employer may scheduleits nonexempt employees to use their accrued FLSA

compensatory time as directed if the prior agreementspecifically provides such a provision . . . .

"Absent such an agreement, it is our position that nei-ther the statute nor the regulations permit an employer
to require an employee to use accrued compensatorytime." Opinion Letter from Dept. of Labor, Wage and
Hour Div. (Sept. 14, 1992), 1992 WL 845100 (OpinionLetter).

After receiving the letter, Harris County implemented apolicy under which the employees' supervisor sets a maximum number of compensatory hours that may be accumu-lated. When an employee's stock of hours approaches that
maximum, the employee is advised of the maximum and isasked to take steps to reduce accumulated compensatory
time. If the employee does not do so voluntarily, a supervi-sor may order the employee to use his compensatory time at
specified times.Petitioners sued, claiming that the county's policy violates
the FLSA because $ 207(o)(5)--which requires that an em-ployer reasonably accommodate employee requests to use
compensatory time--provides the exclusive means of uti-lizing accrued time in the absence of an agreement or understanding permitting some other method. The DistrictCourt agreed, granting summary judgment for petitioners
and entering a declaratory judgment that the county's policyviolated the FLSA. Moreau v. Harris County, 945 F. Supp.
1067 (SD Tex. 1996). The Court of Appeals for the FifthCircuit reversed, holding that the FLSA did not speak to the
issue and thus did not prohibit the county from implementingits compensatory time policy. Moreau v. Harris County,
158 F. 3d 241 (1998). Judge Dennis concurred in part anddissented in part, concluding that the employer could not
compel the employee to use compensatory time unless theemployee agreed to such an arrangement in advance.

II
Both parties, and the United States as amicus curiae, con-cede that nothing in the FLSA expressly prohibits a State

or subdivision thereof from compelling employees to utilizeaccrued compensatory time. Petitioners and the United
States, however, contend that the FLSA implicitly prohibitssuch a practice in the absence of an agreement or understanding authorizing compelled use.3 Title 29 U. S. C.$ 207(

o)(5) provides:

"An employee . . .
"(A) who has accrued compensatory time off . . . , and
"(B) who has requested the use of such compensatorytime,

"shall be permitted by the employee's employer to usesuch time within a reasonable period after making the
request if the use of the compensatory time does notunduly disrupt the operations of the public agency."

Petitioners and the United States rely upon the canon expressio unius est exclusio alterius, contending that the ex-press grant of control to employees to use compensatory

time, subject to the limitation regarding undue disruptions

2 Compare, e. g., Collins v. Lobdell, 188 F. 3d 1124, 1129-1130 (CA9 1999)
(upholding employer's policy compelling compensatory time use), with
Heaton v. Moore, 43 F. 3d 1176, 1180-1181 (CA8 1994) (striking down policy compelling compensatory time use), cert. denied sub nom. Schriro v.
Heaton, 515 U. S. 1104 (1995).

3 We granted certiorari on the question " `[w]hether a public agency governed by the compensatory time provisions of the Fair Labor Standards
Act of 1938, 29 U. S. C. $ 207(o), may, absent a preexisting agreement, require its employees to use accrued compensatory time?' " 528 U. S. 926,
927 (1999). As such, we decide this case on the assumption that no agreement or understanding exists between the employer and employees on the
issue of compelled use of compensatory time.

of workplace operations, implies that all other methods of
spending compensatory time are precluded.4

We find this reading unpersuasive. We accept the proposition that "[w]hen a statute limits a thing to be done in a
particular mode, it includes a negative of any other mode."
Raleigh & Gaston R. Co. v. Reid, 13 Wall. 269, 270 (1872).
But that canon does not resolve this case in petitioners'
favor. The "thing to be done" as defined by $ 207(o)(5) is
not the expenditure of compensatory time, as petitioners
would have it. Instead, $ 207(o)(5) is more properly read as
a minimal guarantee that an employee will be able to make
some use of compensatory time when he requests to use it.
As such, the proper expressio unius inference is that an employer may not, at least in the absence of an agreement, deny
an employee's request to use compensatory time for a reason
other than that provided in $ 207(o)(5). The canon's application simply does not prohibit an employer from telling an
employee to take the benefits of compensatory time by
scheduling time off work with full pay.

In other words, viewed in the context of the overall statutory scheme, $ 207(o)(5) is better read not as setting forth
the exclusive method by which compensatory time can be
used, but as setting up a safeguard to ensure that an em4 Justice Stevens asserts that the parties never make this argument.
See post, at 593, n. 1 (dissenting opinion). Although the United States
and petitioners fail to make their arguments in Latin, we believe a fair
reading of the briefs reveals reliance upon the expressio unius canon.
See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 16 ("Congress . . . identified only one circumstance in which an employer may exercise some

Opinion of the Court
ployee will receive timely compensation for working over-time. Section 207(

o)(5) guarantees that, at the very minimum, an employee will get to use his compensatory time(

i. e., take time off work with full pay) unless doing so would
disrupt the employer's operations. And it is precisely thisconcern over ensuring that employees can timely "liquidate"

compensatory time that the Secretary of Labor identified in
her own regulations governing $ 207(o)(5):

"Compensatory time cannot be used as a means toavoid statutory overtime compensation. An employee

has the right to use compensatory time earned and mustnot be coerced to accept more compensatory time than
an employer can realistically and in good faith expect to
be able to grant within a reasonable period of his orher making a request for use of such time." 29 CFR

$ 553.25(b) (1999).
This reading is confirmed by nearby provisions of theFLSA that reflect a similar concern for ensuring that the

employee receive some timely benefit for overtime work.For example, $ 207(

o)(3)(A) provides that workers may not
accrue more than 240 or 480 hours of compensatory time, depending upon the nature of the job. See also $ 207(o)(2)(B)(conditioning the employer's ability to provide compensatory

time upon the employee not accruing compensatory time inexcess of the $ 207(

o)(3)(A) limits). Section 207(o)(3)(A) helps
guarantee that employees only accrue amounts of compensa-tory time that they can reasonably use. After all, an employer does not need $ 207(o)(3)(A)'s protection; it is freeat any time to reduce the number of hours accrued by exchanging them for cash payment, $ 207(o)(3)(B), or by halting the accrual of compensatory time by paying cash compensation for overtime work, 29 CFR $ 553.26(a) (1999). Thus,

$ 207(o)(3)(A), like $ 207(o)(5), reflects a concern that employees receive some timely benefit in exchange for overtime work. Moreover, on petitioners' view, the compensa529US2 Unit: $U53 [09-26-01 10:37:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
tory time exception enacted by Congress in the wake of
Garcia would become a nullity when employees who refuse
to use compensatory time reach the statutory maximums onaccrual. Petitioners' position would convert $ 207(

o)(3)(A)'s
shield into a sword, forcing employers to pay cash compen-sation instead of providing compensatory time to employees

who work overtime.

At bottom, we think the better reading of $ 207(o)(5) isthat it imposes a restriction upon an employer's efforts to

prohibit the use of compensatory time when employees re-quest to do so; that provision says nothing about restricting
an employer's efforts to require employees to use compensatory time. Because the statute is silent on this issue and
because Harris County's policy is entirely compatible with

$ 207(o)(5), petitioners cannot, as they are required to do by
29 U. S. C. $ 216(b), prove that Harris County has violated

$ 207.

Our interpretation of $ 207(o)(5)--one that does not prohibit employers from forcing employees to use compensatory
time--finds support in two other features of the FLSA.
First, employers remain free under the FLSA to decrease
the number of hours that employees work. An employer
may tell the employee to take off an afternoon, a day, or even
an entire week. Cf. Barrentine v. Arkansas-Best Freight
System, Inc., 450 U. S. 728, 739 (1981) ("[T]he FLSA was
designed . . . to ensure that each employee covered by the
Act . . . would be protected from the evil of overwork . . ."
(internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted)). Second,
the FLSA explicitly permits an employer to cash out accumulated compensatory time by paying the employee his regular hourly wage for each hour accrued. $ 207(o)(3)(B); 29
CFR $ 553.27(a) (1999). Thus, under the FLSA an employer
is free to require an employee to take time off work, and an
employer is also free to use the money it would have paid in
wages to cash out accrued compensatory time. The compelled use of compensatory time challenged in this case

529US2 Unit: $U53 [09-26-01 10:37:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN
586 CHRISTENSEN v. HARRIS COUNTY

Opinion of the Court
merely involves doing both of these steps at once. It would
make little sense to interpret $ 207(o)(5) to make the combination of the two steps unlawful when each independently
is lawful.5

III

In an attempt to avoid the conclusion that the FLSA does
not prohibit compelled use of compensatory time, petitioners
and the United States contend that we should defer to the
Department of Labor's opinion letter, which takes the position that an employer may compel the use of compensatory
time only if the employee has agreed in advance to such a
practice. Specifically, they argue that the agency opinion
letter is entitled to deference under our decision in Chevron
U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467
U. S. 837 (1984). In Chevron, we held that a court must give

5 Justice Stevens does not dispute this argument. In fact, he expressly endorses half of it. See post, at 594, 595 (employer free to cash
out compensatory time). Instead, Justice Stevens claims that we
"stumbl[e]" by failing to identify "the relevant general rule" that employees have "a statutory right to compensation for overtime work payable in
cash." Post, at 592. We fail to do so only because the general rule is not
relevant to this case. Both parties to this case agreed that compensatory
time would be provided in lieu of cash and thus $ 207(a)'s general requirement of cash compensation is supplanted. Petitioners and the United
States do assert that the requirement of cash compensation is relevant by
analogy. They claim that an employer cannot compel compensatory time
use because compensatory time should be treated like employee cash in
the bank--that is, under the exclusive control of the employee. But this
analogy is wholly inapt under the very terms of the FLSA. The FLSA
grants significant control to the employer over accrued compensatory
time. For example, the employer is free to buy out compensatory time
at any time by providing cash compensation. $ 207(o)(3)(B); 29 CFR

$ 553.27(a) (1999). Additionally, an employer is free to deny any request
to use compensatory time when such use would unduly disrupt the employer's operations. $ 207(o)(5)(B); 29 CFR $ 553.25(d) (1999). The cash
analogy is therefore directly undermined by unambiguous provisions of
the statute.

effect to an agency's regulation containing a reasonable in-terpretation of an ambiguous statute.

Id., at 842-844.
Here, however, we confront an interpretation contained inan opinion letter, not one arrived at after, for example, a

formal adjudication or notice-and-comment rulemaking. In-terpretations such as those in opinion letters--like interpretations contained in policy statements, agency manuals, and
enforcement guidelines, all of which lack the force of law--do not warrant

Chevron-style deference. See, e. g., Reno v.
Koray, 515 U. S. 50, 61 (1995) (internal agency guideline,which is not "subject to the rigors of the Administrative Procedur[e] Act, including public notice and comment," entitled
only to "some deference" (internal quotation marks omitted)); EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244,
256-258 (1991) (interpretative guidelines do not receive
Chevron deference); Martin v. Occupational Safety and
Health Review Comm'n, 499 U. S. 144, 157 (1991) (interpretative rules and enforcement guidelines are "not entitled to
the same deference as norms that derive from the exercise
of the Secretary's delegated lawmaking powers"). See generally 1 K. Davis & R. Pierce, Administrative Law Treatise

$ 3.5 (3d ed. 1994). Instead, interpretations contained in formats such as opinion letters are "entitled to respect" under
our decision in Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U. S. 134, 140
(1944), but only to the extent that those interpretations have
the "power to persuade," ibid. See Arabian American Oil
Co., supra, at 256-258. As explained above, we find unpersuasive the agency's interpretation of the statute at issue in
this case.

Of course, the framework of deference set forth in Chevron
does apply to an agency interpretation contained in a regulation. But in this case the Department of Labor's regulation
does not address the issue of compelled compensatory time.
The regulation provides only that "[t]he agreement or understanding [between the employer and employee] may include
other provisions governing the preservation, use, or cashing

(emphasis added). Nothing in the regulation even arguablyrequires that an employer's compelled use policy must be
included in an agreement. The text of the regulation itselfindicates that its command is permissive, not mandatory.

Seeking to overcome the regulation's obvious meaning, theUnited States asserts that the agency's opinion letter interpreting the regulation should be given deference under ourdecision in

Auer v. Robbins, 519 U. S. 452 (1997). In Auer,we held that an agency's interpretation of its own regulation

is entitled to deference. Id., at 461. See also Bowles v.Seminole Rock & Sand Co., 325 U. S. 410 (1945). But Auer
deference is warranted only when the language of the regula-tion is ambiguous. The regulation in this case, however, is
not ambiguous--it is plainly permissive. To defer to theagency's position would be to permit the agency, under the
guise of interpreting a regulation, to create de facto a newregulation. Because the regulation is not ambiguous on the
issue of compelled compensatory time, Auer deference isunwarranted.

* * *
As we have noted, no relevant statutory provision ex-pressly or implicitly prohibits Harris County from pursuing

its policy of forcing employees to utilize their compensatorytime. In its opinion letter siding with the petitioners, the
Department of Labor opined that "it is our position that nei-ther the statute nor the regulations permit an employer to
require an employee to use accrued compensatory time."Opinion Letter (emphasis added). But this view is exactly
backwards. Unless the FLSA prohibits respondents fromadopting its policy, petitioners cannot show that Harris
County has violated the FLSA. And the FLSA containsno such prohibition. The judgment of the Court of Appeals
is affirmed.

It is so ordered.

Justice Scalia, concurring in part and concurring in the

I join the judgment of the Court and all of its opinion except Part III, which declines to give effect to the position of
the Department of Labor in this case because its opinion letter is entitled only to so-called "Skidmore deference," see
Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U. S. 134, 140 (1944). Skidmore deference to authoritative agency views is an anachronism, dating from an era in which we declined to give
agency interpretations (including interpretive regulations,
as opposed to "legislative rules") authoritative effect. See
EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244, 259
(1991) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). This former judicial attitude accounts for that provision of the 1946 Administrative Procedure Act which
exempted "interpretative rules" (since they would not be
authoritative) from the notice-and-comment requirements
applicable to rulemaking, see 5 U. S. C. $ 553(b)(A).

That era came to an end with our watershed decision in
Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council,
Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 844 (1984), which established the principle
that "a court may not substitute its own construction of a
statutory provision for a reasonable interpretation made by
the administrator of an agency." * While Chevron in fact

involved an interpretive regulation, the rationale of the case
was not limited to that context: " `The power of an administrative agency to administer a congressionally created . . .
program necessarily requires the formulation of policy and
the making of rules to fill any gap left, implicitly or explicitly,
by Congress.' " Id., at 843, quoting Morton v. Ruiz, 415
U. S. 199, 231 (1974). Quite appropriately, therefore, we
have accorded Chevron deference not only to agency regulations, but to authoritative agency positions set forth in a variety of other formats. See, e. g., INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre,
526 U. S. 415, 425 (1999) (adjudication); NationsBank of
N. C., N. A. v. Variable Annuity Life Ins. Co., 513 U. S. 251,

Corp. to restore pension benefit plan); Young v. Community

type deference can be inapplicable for only three reasons: (1) the statute is
unambiguous, so there is no room for administrative interpretation; (2) no
interpretation has been made by personnel of the agency responsible for
administering the statute; or (3) the interpretation made by such personnel was not authoritative, in the sense that it does not represent the official
position of the expert agency. All of these reasons preclude Skidmore
deference as well. The specific example of the inapplicability of Chevron
that Justice Breyer posits, viz., "where one has doubt that Congress
actually intended to delegate interpretive authority to the agency," post,
at 597, appears to assume that, after finding a statute to be ambiguous,
we must ask in addition, before we can invoke Chevron deference, whether
Congress intended the ambiguity to be resolved by the administering
agency. That is not so. Chevron establishes a presumption that ambiguities are to be resolved (within the bounds of reasonable interpretation)
by the administering agency. The implausibility of Congress's leaving
a highly significant issue unaddressed (and thus "delegating" its resolution to the administering agency) is assuredly one of the factors to be
considered in determining whether there is ambiguity, see MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. American Telephone & Telegraph Co., 512 U. S.
218, 231 (1994), but once ambiguity is established the consequences of
Chevron attach.

Drug Administration's "longstanding interpretation of thestatute," reflected in no-action notice published in the Federal Register).In my view, therefore, the position that the county's action
in this case was unlawful unless permitted by the terms ofan agreement with the sheriff 's department employees warrants Chevron deference if it represents the authoritative
view of the Department of Labor. The fact that it appearsin a single opinion letter signed by the Acting Administrator

of the Wage and Hour Division might not alone persuade methat it occupies that status. But the Solicitor General of the
United States, appearing as an amicus in this action, hasfiled a brief, cosigned by the Solicitor of Labor, which represents the position set forth in the opinion letter to be theposition of the Secretary of Labor. That alone, even without
existence of the opinion letter, would in my view entitle theposition to

Chevron deference. What we said in a case involving an agency's interpretation of its own regulations ap-plies equally, in my view, to an agency's interpretation of its

governing statute:

"Petitioners complain that the Secretary's interpretation comes to us in the form of a legal brief; but thatdoes not, in the circumstances of this case, make it unworthy of deference. The Secretary's position is in no
sense a `post hoc rationalizatio[n]' advanced by anagency seeking to defend past agency action against

attack, Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hospital, 488 U. S.204, 212 (1988). There is simply no reason to suspect
that the interpretation does not reflect the agency's fair
and considered judgment on the matter in question."
Auer v. Robbins, 519 U. S. 452, 462 (1997).

I nonetheless join the judgment of the Court because, for
the reasons set forth in Part II of its opinion, the Secretary's
position does not seem to me a reasonable interpretation of
the statute.

592 CHRISTENSEN v. HARRIS COUNTY

Stevens, J., dissenting
Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Ginsburg and
Justice Breyer join, dissenting.

Because the disagreement between the parties concernsthe scope of an exception to a general rule, it is appropriate

to begin with a correct identification of the relevant generalrule. That rule gives all employees protected by the Fair
Labor Standards Act of 1938 a statutory right to compensa-tion for overtime work payable in cash, whether they work
in the private sector of the economy or the public sector. 29U. S. C. $$ 206, 207 (1994 ed. and Supp. III). In 1985, Congress enacted an exception to that general rule that permits
States and their political subdivisions to use compensatorytime instead of cash as compensation for overtime. The exception, however, is not applicable unless the public employerfirst arrives at an agreement with its employees to substitute that type of compensation for cash. $ 207(o); 29 CFR$ 553.23 (1999). As I read the statute, the employer has no
right to impose compensatory overtime payment upon itsemployees except in accordance with the terms of the agreement authorizing its use.The Court stumbles because it treats $ 207's limited and
conditional exception as though it were the relevant generalrule. The Court begins its opinion by correctly asserting
that public employers may "compensate their employees for
overtime by granting them compensatory time or `comptime,' which entitles them to take time off work with full

pay." Ante, at 578. It is not until it reaches the bottom ofthe second page, however, that the Court acknowledges that
what appeared to be the relevant general rule is really anexception from the employees' basic right to be paid in cash.
Ante, at 579.In my judgment, the fact that no employer may lawfully
make any use of "comp time" without a prior agreement withthe affected employees is of critical importance in answering
the question whether a particular method of using that form

529US2 Unit: $U53 [09-26-01 10:37:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN

593Cite as: 529 U. S. 576 (2000)
Stevens, J., dissenting
of noncash compensation may be imposed on those employeeswithout their consent. Because their consent is a condition

without which the employer cannot qualify for the exceptionfrom the general rule, it seems clear to me that their agreement must encompass the way in which the compensatory
time may be used.

In an effort to avoid addressing this basic point, the Court
mistakenly characterizes petitioners' central argument as
turning upon the canon expressio unius est exclusio alterius.1 According to the Court, petitioners and the United
States as amicus curiae contend that because employees are
granted the power under the Act to use their compensatory
time subject solely to the employers' ability to make employees wait a "reasonable time" before using it, "all other methods of spending compensatory time are precluded." Ante,
at 583. The Court concludes that expressio unius does not
help petitioners because the "thing to be done" as prescribed
by the statute (and because of which all other "things" are
excluded) is simply a guarantee that employees will be allowed to make some use of compensatory time upon request,
rather than an open-ended promise that employees will be
able to choose (subject only to the "reasonable time" limitation) how to spend it. Ibid.

This description of the debate misses the primary thrust
of petitioners' position. They do not, as the Court implies,
contend that employers generally must afford employees essentially unlimited use of accrued comp time under the statute; the point is rather that rules regarding both the avail1 It must be noted that neither petitioners' brief nor the brief for the
United States as amicus curiae actually relies upon this canon. Indeed,
the sole mention of it in either brief is in petitioners' statement of the
case, in which petitioners refer in a single sentence to an argument made
by the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in Heaton v. Moore, 43
F. 3d 1176 (1994) (rejecting compelled-use policy absent agreement to that
effect), cert. denied sub nom. Schriro v. Heaton, 515 U. S. 1104 (1995).

594 CHRISTENSEN v. HARRIS COUNTY

Stevens, J., dissenting
ability and the use of comp time must be contained withinan

agreement. The "thing to be done" under the Act is for
the parties to come to terms. It is because they have notdone so with respect to the use of comp time here that the

county may not unilaterally force its expenditure.The Court is thus likewise mistaken in its insistence that
under petitioners' reading, the comp time exception "would
become a nullity" because employees could "forc[e] employ-ers to pay cash compensation instead of providing compensatory time" for overtime work. Ante, at 585. Quite the con-trary, employers can only be "forced" either to abide by the
arrangements to which they have agreed, or to comply with
the basic statutory requirement that overtime compensation
is payable in cash.

Moreover, as the Court points out, ante, at 580, 584, even
absent an agreement on the way in which comp time may be
used, employers may at any time require employees to "cash
out" of accumulated comp time, thereby readily avoiding
any forced payment of comp time employees may accrue.

$ 207(o)(3)(B); 29 CFR $ 553.26(a) (1999). Neither can it be
said that Congress somehow assumed that the right to force
employees to use accumulated comp time was to be an implied term in all comp time agreements. Congress specifically contemplated that employees might well reach the statutory maximum of accrued comp time, by requiring, in

$ 207(o)(3)(A), that once the statutory maximum is reached,
employers must compensate employees in the preferred
form--cash--for every hour over the limit.

Finally, it is not without significance in the present case
that the Government department responsible for the statute's enforcement shares my understanding of its meaning.
Indeed, the Department of Labor made its position clear to
the county itself in response to a direct question posed by
the county before it decided--agency advice notwithstanding--to implement its forced-use policy nonetheless. The
Department of Labor explained:

Stevens, J., dissenting
"[A] public employer may schedule its nonexempt em-ployees to use their accrued FLSA compensatory time

as directed if the prior agreement specifically providessuch a provision, and the employees have knowingly and
voluntarily agreed to such provision . . . ."Absent such an agreement, it is our position that neither the statute nor the regulations permit an employerto require an employee to use accrued compensatory
time." Opinion Letter from Dept. of Labor, Wage andHour Div. (Sept. 14, 1992), 1992 WL 845100.

The Department, it should be emphasized, does not suggestthat forced-use policies are forbidden by the statute or regulations. Rather, its judgment is simply that, in accordancewith the basic rule governing compensatory time set down
by the statutory and regulatory scheme, such policies maybe pursued solely according to the parties'

agreement. Be-cause there is no reason to believe that the Department's

opinion was anything but thoroughly considered and consist-ently observed, it unquestionably merits our respect. See
Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U. S. 134, 140 (1944).2In the end, I do not understand why it should be any more
difficult for the parties to come to an agreement on this termof employment than on the antecedent question whether
compensatory time may be used at all. State employersenjoy substantial bargaining power in negotiations with
their employees; by regulation, agreements governing theavailability and use of compensatory time can be essentially
as informal as the parties wish. See 29 CFR $ 553.23(c)(1999). And, as we have said, employers retain the ability
to "cash out" of accrued leave at any time. That simple stepis, after all, the method that the Department of Labor years
ago suggested the county should pursue here, and that would

I respectfully dissent.
Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins,
dissenting.

Justice Scalia may well be right that the position of the
Department of Labor, set forth in both brief and letter, is an"authoritative" agency view that warrants deference under

Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council,
Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984). Ante, at 590 (opinion concurring
in part and concurring in judgment). But I do not object tothe majority's citing

Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U. S. 134
(1944), instead. And I do disagree with Justice Scalia'sstatement that what he calls "

Skidmore deference" is "an
anachronism." Ante, at 589.

Skidmore made clear that courts may pay particular attention to the views of an expert agency where they represent
"specialized experience," 323 U. S., at 139, even if they do
not constitute an exercise of delegated lawmaking authority.
The Court held that the "rulings, interpretations and opinions of " an agency, "while not controlling upon the courts by
reason of their authority, do constitute a body of experience
and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may
properly resort for guidance." Id., at 140; see also Martin
v. Occupational Safety and Health Review Comm'n, 499
U. S. 144, 157 (1991). As Justice Jackson wrote for the
Court, those views may possess the "power to persuade,"
even where they lack the "power to control." Skidmore,
supra, at 140.

Chevron made no relevant change. It simply focused
upon an additional, separate legal reason for deferring to certain agency determinations, namely, that Congress had delegated to the agency the legal authority to make those determinations. See Chevron, supra, at 843-844. And, to the
extent there may be circumstances in which Chevron-type

Breyer, J., dissenting
deference is inapplicable--e. g., where one has doubt thatCongress actually intended to delegate interpretive authority to the agency (an "ambiguity" that Chevron does notpresumptively leave to agency resolution)--I believe that
Skidmore nonetheless retains legal vitality. If statutes areto serve the human purposes that called them into being,
courts will have to continue to pay particular attention inappropriate cases to the experience-based views of expert
agencies.I agree with

Justice Stevens that, when "thoroughlyconsidered and consistently observed," an agency's views,

particularly in a rather technical case such as this one,"meri[t] our respect." Ante, at 595 (dissenting opinion).
And, of course, I also agree with Justice Stevens that,for the reasons he sets forth, ante, at 592-594, the Labor
Department's position in this matter is eminently reasonable,hence persuasive, whether one views that decision through
Chevron's lens, through Skidmore's, or through both.

UNITED STATES v. MORRISON et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fourth circuit

No. 99-5. Argued January 11, 2000--Decided May 15, 2000*
Petitioner Brzonkala filed suit, alleging, inter alia, that she was raped

by respondents while the three were students at Virginia Polytechnic
Institute, and that this attack violated 42 U. S. C. $ 13981, which provides a federal civil remedy for the victims of gender-motivated
violence. Respondents moved to dismiss on the grounds that the complaint failed to state a claim and that $ 13981's civil remedy is unconstitutional. Petitioner United States intervened to defend the section's
constitutionality. In dismissing the complaint, the District Court held
that it stated a claim against respondents, but that Congress lacked
authority to enact $ 13981 under either the Commerce Clause or $ 5 of
the Fourteenth Amendment, which Congress had explicitly identified
as the sources of federal authority for $ 13981. The en banc Fourth
Circuit affirmed.

Held: Section 13981 cannot be sustained under the Commerce Clause or

$ 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. Pp. 607-627.

(a) The Commerce Clause does not provide Congress with authority to enact $ 13981's federal civil remedy. A congressional enactment
will be invalidated only upon a plain showing that Congress has exceeded its constitutional bounds. See United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S.
549, 568, 577-578. Petitioners assert that $ 13981 can be sustained
under Congress' commerce power as a regulation of activity that substantially affects interstate commerce. The proper framework for analyzing such a claim is provided by the principles the Court set out
in Lopez. First, in Lopez, the noneconomic, criminal nature of possessing a firearm in a school zone was central to the Court's conclusion
that Congress lacks authority to regulate such possession. Similarly,
gender-motivated crimes of violence are not, in any sense, economic
activity. Second, like the statute at issue in Lopez, $ 13981 contains no
jurisdictional element establishing that the federal cause of action is in
pursuance of Congress' regulation of interstate commerce. Although
Lopez makes clear that such a jurisdictional element would lend support
to the argument that $ 13981 is sufficiently tied to interstate commerce

*Together with No. 99-29, Brzonkala v. Morrison et al., also on certiorari to the same court.

Syllabus
to come within Congress' authority, Congress elected to cast $ 13981's
remedy over a wider, and more purely intrastate, body of violent crime.
Third, although $ 13981, unlike the Lopez statute, is supported by
numerous findings regarding the serious impact of gender-motivated
violence on victims and their families, these findings are substantially weakened by the fact that they rely on reasoning that this Court
has rejected, namely, a but-for causal chain from the initial occurrence
of violent crime to every attenuated effect upon interstate commerce.
If accepted, this reasoning would allow Congress to regulate any crime
whose nationwide, aggregated impact has substantial effects on employment, production, transit, or consumption. Moreover, such reasoning will not limit Congress to regulating violence, but may be applied
equally as well to family law and other areas of state regulation since
the aggregate effect of marriage, divorce, and childrearing on the national economy is undoubtedly significant. The Constitution requires
a distinction between what is truly national and what is truly local, and
there is no better example of the police power, which the Founders undeniably left reposed in the States and denied the central Government, than the suppression of violent crime and vindication of its
victims. Congress therefore may not regulate noneconomic, violent
criminal conduct based solely on the conduct's aggregate effect on interstate commerce. Pp. 607-619.

(b) Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, which permits Congress to enforce by appropriate legislation the constitutional guarantee
that no State shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process, or deny any person equal protection of the laws, City
of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U. S. 507, 517, also does not give Congress the
authority to enact $ 13981. Petitioners' assertion that there is pervasive bias in various state justice systems against victims of gendermotivated violence is supported by a voluminous congressional record.
However, the Fourteenth Amendment places limitations on the manner in which Congress may attack discriminatory conduct. Foremost
among them is the principle that the Amendment prohibits only state
action, not private conduct. This was the conclusion reached in United
States v. Harris, 106 U. S. 629, and the Civil Rights Cases, 109 U. S. 3,
which were both decided shortly after the Amendment's adoption.
The force of the doctrine of stare decisis behind these decisions stems
not only from the length of time they have been on the books, but also
from the insight attributable to the Members of the Court at that time,
who all had intimate knowledge and familiarity with the events surrounding the Amendment's adoption. Neither United States v. Guest,
383 U. S. 745, nor District of Columbia v. Carter, 409 U. S. 418, casts
any doubt on the enduring vitality of the Civil Rights Cases and Harris.

Assuming that there has been gender-based disparate treatment by
state authorities in these cases, it would not be enough to save $ 13981's
civil remedy, which is directed not at a State or state actor but at individuals who have committed criminal acts motivated by gender bias.
Section 13981 visits no consequence on any Virginia public official involved in investigating or prosecuting Brzonkala's assault, and it is
thus unlike any of the $ 5 remedies this Court has previously upheld.
See, e. g., South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U. S. 301. Section 13981
is also different from previously upheld remedies in that it applies uniformly throughout the Nation, even though Congress' findings indicate
that the problem addressed does not exist in all, or even most, States.
In contrast, the $ 5 remedy in Katzenbach was directed only to those
States in which Congress found that there had been discrimination.

victims of gender-motivated violence. The United StatesCourt of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, sitting en banc,

struck down $ 13981 because it concluded that Congresslacked constitutional authority to enact the section's civil
remedy. Believing that these cases are controlled by ourdecisions in United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549 (1995),
United States v. Harris, 106 U. S. 629 (1883), and the Civil
Rights Cases, 109 U. S. 3 (1883), we affirm.

Petitioner Christy Brzonkala enrolled at Virginia Poly-technic Institute (Virginia Tech) in the fall of 1994. In September of that year, Brzonkala met respondents AntonioMorrison and James Crawford, who were both students
at Virginia Tech and members of its varsity football team.Brzonkala alleges that, within 30 minutes of meeting Morrison and Crawford, they assaulted and repeatedly raped her.After the attack, Morrison allegedly told Brzonkala, "You
better not have any . . . diseases." Complaint || 22. In themonths following the rape, Morrison also allegedly announced in the dormitory's dining room that he "like[d] toget girls drunk and . . . ."

Id., || 31. The omitted portions,quoted verbatim in the briefs on file with this Court, consist

of boasting, debased remarks about what Morrison woulddo to women, vulgar remarks that cannot fail to shock and

Opinion of the Court
antidepressant medication. Shortly after the rape Brzon-kala stopped attending classes and withdrew from the

university.In early 1995, Brzonkala filed a complaint against respondents under Virginia Tech's Sexual Assault Policy. Duringthe school-conducted hearing on her complaint, Morrison
admitted having sexual contact with her despite the fact
that she had twice told him "no." After the hearing, Vir-ginia Tech's Judicial Committee found insufficient evidence

to punish Crawford, but found Morrison guilty of sexualassault and sentenced him to immediate suspension for two
semesters.

Virginia Tech's dean of students upheld the judicial committee's sentence. However, in July 1995, Virginia Tech informed Brzonkala that Morrison intended to initiate a court
challenge to his conviction under the Sexual Assault Policy.
University officials told her that a second hearing would be
necessary to remedy the school's error in prosecuting her
complaint under that policy, which had not been widely circulated to students. The university therefore conducted a
second hearing under its Abusive Conduct Policy, which was
in force prior to the dissemination of the Sexual Assault
Policy. Following this second hearing the Judicial Committee again found Morrison guilty and sentenced him to an
identical 2-semester suspension. This time, however, the
description of Morrison's offense was, without explanation,
changed from "sexual assault" to "using abusive language."

Morrison appealed his second conviction through the
university's administrative system. On August 21, 1995,
Virginia Tech's senior vice president and provost set aside
Morrison's punishment. She concluded that it was " `excessive when compared with other cases where there has
been a finding of violation of the Abusive Conduct Policy,' "
Brzonkala v. Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State
Univ., 132 F. 3d 950, 955 (CA4 1997). Virginia Tech did not
inform Brzonkala of this decision. After learning from a

newspaper that Morrison would be returning to VirginiaTech for the fall 1995 semester, she dropped out of the

university.In December 1995, Brzonkala sued Morrison, Crawford,
and Virginia Tech in the United States District Court for theWestern District of Virginia. Her complaint alleged that
Morrison's and Crawford's attack violated $ 13981 and thatVirginia Tech's handling of her complaint violated Title IX
of the Education Amendments of 1972, 86 Stat. 373-375,20 U. S. C. $$ 1681-1688. Morrison and Crawford moved to
dismiss this complaint on the grounds that it failed to statea claim and that $ 13981's civil remedy is unconstitutional.
The United States, petitioner in No. 99-5, intervened to de-fend $ 13981's constitutionality.

The District Court dismissed Brzonkala's Title IX claimsagainst Virginia Tech for failure to state a claim upon which
relief can be granted. See Brzonkala v. Virginia Polytechnic and State Univ., 935 F. Supp. 772 (WD Va. 1996).It then held that Brzonkala's complaint stated a claim against

Morrison and Crawford under $ 13981, but dismissed thecomplaint because it concluded that Congress lacked authority to enact the section under either the Commerce Clause or$ 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Brzonkala v. VirginiaPolytechnic and State Univ., 935 F. Supp. 779 (WD Va. 1996).

A divided panel of the Court of Appeals reversed theDistrict Court, reinstating Brzonkala's $ 13981 claim and
her Title IX hostile environment claim.1 Brzonkala v. Vir-ginia Polytechnic and State Univ., 132 F. 3d 949 (CA4 1997).
The full Court of Appeals vacated the panel's opinion andreheard the case en banc. The en banc court then issued
an opinion affirming the District Court's conclusion thatBrzonkala stated a claim under $ 13981 because her complaint alleged a crime of violence and the allegations ofMorrison's crude and derogatory statements regarding his

treatment of women sufficiently indicated that his crime was
motivated by gender animus.2 Nevertheless, the court by
a divided vote affirmed the District Court's conclusion that
Congress lacked constitutional authority to enact $ 13981's
civil remedy. Brzonkala v. Virginia Polytechnic and State
Univ., 169 F. 3d 820 (CA4 1999). Because the Court of Appeals invalidated a federal statute on constitutional grounds,
we granted certiorari. 527 U. S. 1068 (1999).

Section 13981 was part of the Violence Against Women
Act of 1994, $ 40302, 108 Stat. 1941-1942. It states that "[a]ll
persons within the United States shall have the right to be
free from crimes of violence motivated by gender." 42
U. S. C. $ 13981(b). To enforce that right, subsection (c)
declares:

"A person (including a person who acts under color of
any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage of
any State) who commits a crime of violence motivated
by gender and thus deprives another of the right declared in subsection (b) of this section shall be liable to
the party injured, in an action for the recovery of compensatory and punitive damages, injunctive and declaratory relief, and such other relief as a court may deem
appropriate."

Section 13981 defines a "crim[e] of violence motivated by
gender" as "a crime of violence committed because of gender

that Brzonkala failed to state a claim alleging disparate treatment under

the claim in abeyance pending this Court's decision in Davis v. Monroe

of certiorari did not encompass Brzonkala's Title IX claims, and we thus
do not consider them in this opinion.

animus based on the victim's gender." $ 13981(d)(1). Italso provides that the term "crime of violence" includes any

"(A) . . . act or series of acts that would constitutea felony against the person or that would constitute a
felony against property if the conduct presents a seriousrisk of physical injury to another, and that would come
within the meaning of State or Federal offenses de-scribed in section 16 of Title 18, whether or not those
acts have actually resulted in criminal charges, prosecu-tion, or conviction and whether or not those acts were
committed in the special maritime, territorial, or prisonjurisdiction of the United States; and

"(B) includes an act or series of acts that would constitute a felony described in subparagraph (A) but forthe relationship between the person who takes such

action and the individual against whom such action istaken." $ 13981(d)(2).

Further clarifying the broad scope of $ 13981's civil remedy, subsection (e)(2) states that "[n]othing in this sectionrequires a prior criminal complaint, prosecution, or conviction to establish the elements of a cause of action under subsection (c) of this section." And subsection (e)(3) provides a$ 13981 litigant with a choice of forums: Federal and state

courts "shall have concurrent jurisdiction" over complaintsbrought under the section.

Although the foregoing language of $ 13981 covers a wideswath of criminal conduct, Congress placed some limitations on the section's federal civil remedy. Subsection (e)(1)states that "[n]othing in this section entitles a person to a
cause of action under subsection (c) of this section for random
acts of violence unrelated to gender or for acts that cannot
be demonstrated, by a preponderance of the evidence, to be
motivated by gender." Subsection (e)(4) further states that

$ 13981 shall not be construed "to confer on the courts of the
United States jurisdiction over any State law claim seeking

Opinion of the Court
the establishment of a divorce, alimony, equitable distribu-tion of marital property, or child custody decree."

Every law enacted by Congress must be based on one ormore of its powers enumerated in the Constitution. "The
powers of the legislature are defined and limited; and thatthose limits may not be mistaken, or forgotten, the constitution is written." Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 176(1803) (Marshall, C. J.). Congress explicitly identified the
sources of federal authority on which it relied in enacting$ 13981. It said that a "Federal civil rights cause of action"
is established "[p]ursuant to the affirmative power of Con-gress . . . under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to
the Constitution, as well as under section 8 of Article I ofthe Constitution." 42 U. S. C. $ 13981(a). We address Congress' authority to enact this remedy under each of theseconstitutional provisions in turn.

II
Due respect for the decisions of a coordinate branch ofGovernment demands that we invalidate a congressional

enactment only upon a plain showing that Congress hasexceeded its constitutional bounds. See

United States v.Lopez, 514 U. S., at 568, 577-578 (K
ennedy, J., concurring);
United States v. Harris, 106 U. S., at 635. With this pre-sumption of constitutionality in mind, we turn to the question whether $ 13981 falls within Congress' power underArticle I, $ 8, of the Constitution. Brzonkala and the United
States rely upon the third clause of the section, which givesCongress power "[t]o regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the IndianTribes."

As we discussed at length in Lopez, our interpreta-tion of the Commerce Clause has changed as our Nation
has developed. See 514 U. S., at 552-557; id., at 568-574(

Kennedy, J., concurring); id., at 584, 593-599 (Thomas, J.,concurring). We need not repeat that detailed review of

Opinion of the Court
the Commerce Clause's history here; it suffices to say that,in the years since NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp.,

301 U. S. 1 (1937), Congress has had considerably greaterlatitude in regulating conduct and transactions under the
Commerce Clause than our previous case law permitted.See Lopez, 514 U. S., at 555-556; id., at 573-574 (

Kennedy,J., concurring).

Lopez emphasized, however, that even under our modern,expansive interpretation of the Commerce Clause, Congress' regulatory authority is not without effective bounds.Id., at 557.

"[E]ven [our] modern-era precedents which haveexpanded congressional power under the Commerce
Clause confirm that this power is subject to outer limits.In Jones & Laughlin Steel, the Court warned that the
scope of the interstate commerce power `must be con-sidered in the light of our dual system of government
and may not be extended so as to embrace effectsupon interstate commerce so indirect and remote that
to embrace them, in view of our complex society, wouldeffectually obliterate the distinction between what is national and what is local and create a completely central-ized government.' "

Id., at 556-557 (quoting Jones &Laughlin Steel, supra, at 37).

3

As we observed in Lopez, modern Commerce Clause juris-prudence has "identified three broad categories of activity
that Congress may regulate under its commerce power."

3 Justice Souter's dissent takes us to task for allegedly abandoning Jones & Laughlin Steel in favor of an inadequate "federalism of
some earlier time." Post, at 641-643, 655. As the foregoing language
from Jones & Laughlin Steel makes clear however, this Court has always
recognized a limit on the commerce power inherent in "our dual system
of government." 301 U. S., at 37. It is the dissent's remarkable theory
that the commerce power is without judicially enforceable boundaries
that disregards the Court's caution in Jones & Laughlin Steel against
allowing that power to "effectually obliterate the distinction between
what is national and what is local." Ibid.

& Reclamation Assn., Inc., 452 U. S. 264, 276-277 (1981);
Perez v. United States, 402 U. S. 146, 150 (1971)). "First,
Congress may regulate the use of the channels of interstate

Inc. v. United States, 379 U. S. 241, 256 (1964); United States
v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100, 114 (1941)). "Second, Congress is
empowered to regulate and protect the instrumentalities
of interstate commerce, or persons or things in interstate
commerce, even though the threat may come only from intrastate activities." 514 U. S., at 558 (citing Shreveport Rate
Cases, 234 U. S. 342 (1914); Southern R. Co. v. United States,
222 U. S. 20 (1911); Perez, supra, at 150). "Finally, Congress' commerce authority includes the power to regulate
those activities having a substantial relation to interstate
commerce, . . . i. e., those activities that substantially affect
interstate commerce." 514 U. S., at 558-559 (citing Jones &
Laughlin Steel, supra, at 37).

Petitioners do not contend that these cases fall within
either of the first two of these categories of Commerce
Clause regulation. They seek to sustain $ 13981 as a regulation of activity that substantially affects interstate commerce. Given $ 13981's focus on gender-motivated violence
wherever it occurs (rather than violence directed at the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, interstate markets,
or things or persons in interstate commerce), we agree that
this is the proper inquiry.

Since Lopez most recently canvassed and clarified our
case law governing this third category of Commerce Clause
regulation, it provides the proper framework for conducting
the required analysis of $ 13981. In Lopez, we held that the
Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990, 18 U. S. C. $ 922(q)(1)(A),
which made it a federal crime to knowingly possess a firearm in a school zone, exceeded Congress' authority under the
Commerce Clause. See 514 U. S., at 551. Several significant considerations contributed to our decision.

529US3 Unit: $U54 [10-04-01 09:35:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN
610 UNITED STATES v. MORRISON

Opinion of the Court
First, we observed that $ 922(q) was "a criminal statutethat by its terms has nothing to do with `commerce' or any

sort of economic enterprise, however broadly one might de-fine those terms."

Id., at 561. Reviewing our case law, we
noted that "we have upheld a wide variety of congressionalActs regulating intrastate economic activity where we have

concluded that the activity substantially affected interstate
commerce." Id., at 559. Although we cited only a few ex-amples, including

Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111 (1942);
Hodel, supra; Perez, supra; Katzenbach v. McClung, 379U. S. 294 (1964); and

Heart of Atlanta Motel, supra, we
stated that the pattern of analysis is clear. Lopez, 514 U. S.,
at 559-560. "Where economic activity substantially affects
interstate commerce, legislation regulating that activity will
be sustained." Id., at 560.

Both petitioners and Justice Souter's dissent downplay
the role that the economic nature of the regulated activity
plays in our Commerce Clause analysis. But a fair reading
of Lopez shows that the noneconomic, criminal nature of the
conduct at issue was central to our decision in that case.
See, e. g., id., at 551 ("The Act [does not] regulat[e] a commercial activity"), 560 ("Even Wickard, which is perhaps
the most far reaching example of Commerce Clause authority over intrastate activity, involved economic activity in a
way that the possession of a gun in a school zone does not"),
561 ("Section 922(q) is not an essential part of a larger regulation of economic activity"), 566 ("Admittedly, a determination whether an intrastate activity is commercial or noncommercial may in some cases result in legal uncertainty.
But, so long as Congress' authority is limited to those powers
enumerated in the Constitution, and so long as those enumerated powers are interpreted as having judicially enforceable outer limits, congressional legislation under the Commerce Clause always will engender `legal uncertainty' "), 567
("The possession of a gun in a local school zone is in no
sense an economic activity that might, through repetition

Opinion of the Court
elsewhere, substantially affect any sort of interstate com-merce"); see also

id., at 573-574 (Kennedy, J., concurring)
(stating that Lopez did not alter our "practical conceptionof commercial regulation" and that Congress may "regulate

in the commercial sphere on the assumption that we have asingle market and a unified purpose to build a stable national
economy"), 577 ("Were the Federal Government to take over
the regulation of entire areas of traditional state concern,areas having nothing to do with the regulation of commercial

activities, the boundaries between the spheres of federaland state authority would blur"), 580 ("[U]nlike the earlier
cases to come before the Court here neither the actors northeir conduct has a commercial character, and neither the
purposes nor the design of the statute has an evident com-mercial nexus. The statute makes the simple possession
of a gun within 1,000 feet of the grounds of the schoola criminal offense. In a sense any conduct in this interdependent world of ours has an ultimate commercial origin
or consequence, but we have not yet said the commerce
power may reach so far" (citation omitted)). Lopez's review
of Commerce Clause case law demonstrates that in those
cases where we have sustained federal regulation of intrastate activity based upon the activity's substantial effects
on interstate commerce, the activity in question has been
some sort of economic endeavor. See id., at 559-560.4

The second consideration that we found important in
analyzing $ 922(q) was that the statute contained "no express jurisdictional element which might limit its reach to
a discrete set of firearm possessions that additionally have

4 Justice Souter's dissent does not reconcile its analysis with our
holding in Lopez because it apparently would cast that decision aside.
See post, at 637-643. However, the dissent cannot persuasively contradict
Lopez's conclusion that, in every case where we have sustained federal
regulation under the aggregation principle in Wickard v. Filburn, 317
U. S. 111 (1942), the regulated activity was of an apparent commercial
character. See, e. g., Lopez, 514 U. S., at 559-560, 580.

529US3 Unit: $U54 [10-04-01 09:35:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN
612 UNITED STATES v. MORRISON

Opinion of the Court
an explicit connection with or effect on interstate com-merce."

Id., at 562. Such a jurisdictional element may establish that the enactment is in pursuance of Congress' regu-lation of interstate commerce.

Third, we noted that neither $ 922(q) " `nor its legislativehistory contain[s] express congressional findings regarding
the effects upon interstate commerce of gun possession in a
school zone.' " Ibid. (quoting Brief for United States, O. T.1994, No. 93-1260, pp. 5-6). While "Congress normally is

not required to make formal findings as to the substantialburdens that an activity has on interstate commerce," 514
U. S., at 562 (citing McClung, supra, at 304; Perez, 402 U. S.,
at 156), the existence of such findings may "enable us to evaluate the legislative judgment that the activity in question
substantially affect[s] interstate commerce, even though no
such substantial effect [is] visible to the naked eye." 514
U. S., at 563.

Finally, our decision in Lopez rested in part on the fact
that the link between gun possession and a substantial effect
on interstate commerce was attenuated. Id., at 563-567.
The United States argued that the possession of guns may
lead to violent crime, and that violent crime "can be expected to affect the functioning of the national economy in
two ways. First, the costs of violent crime are substantial,
and, through the mechanism of insurance, those costs are
spread throughout the population. Second, violent crime
reduces the willingness of individuals to travel to areas
within the country that are perceived to be unsafe." Id.,
at 563-564 (citation omitted). The Government also argued
that the presence of guns at schools poses a threat to the
educational process, which in turn threatens to produce a
less efficient and productive work force, which will negatively affect national productivity and thus interstate commerce. Ibid.

We rejected these "costs of crime" and "national productivity" arguments because they would permit Congress

529US3 Unit: $U54 [10-04-01 09:35:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN

613Cite as: 529 U. S. 598 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
to "regulate not only all violent crime, but all activities thatmight lead to violent crime, regardless of how tenuously they

relate to interstate commerce." Id., at 564. We noted that,under this but-for reasoning:

"Congress could regulate any activity that it found wasrelated to the economic productivity of individual citizens: family law (including marriage, divorce, and childcustody), for example. Under the[se] theories . . . , it is
difficult to perceive any limitation on federal power,even in areas such as criminal law enforcement or education where States historically have been sovereign.Thus, if we were to accept the Government's arguments,
we are hard pressed to posit any activity by an individ-ual that Congress is without power to regulate."

Ibid.

With these principles underlying our Commerce Clausejurisprudence as reference points, the proper resolution of

the present cases is clear. Gender-motivated crimes of vio-lence are not, in any sense of the phrase, economic activity.
While we need not adopt a categorical rule against aggre-gating the effects of any noneconomic activity in order to
decide these cases, thus far in our Nation's history our caseshave upheld Commerce Clause regulation of intrastate activity only where that activity is economic in nature. See, e. g.,
id., at 559-560, and the cases cited therein.Like the Gun-Free School Zones Act at issue in Lopez,

$ 13981 contains no jurisdictional element establishing thatthe federal cause of action is in pursuance of Congress' power
to regulate interstate commerce. Although Lopez makesclear that such a jurisdictional element would lend support
to the argument that $ 13981 is sufficiently tied to interstatecommerce, Congress elected to cast $ 13981's remedy over a
wider, and more purely intrastate, body of violent crime.5

5 Title 42 U. S. C. $ 13981 is not the sole provision of the Violence Against
Women Act of 1994 to provide a federal remedy for gender-motivated
crime. Section 40221(a) of the Act creates a federal criminal remedy to

614 UNITED STATES v. MORRISON

Opinion of the Court
In contrast with the lack of congressional findings that we
faced in Lopez, $ 13981 is supported by numerous findings
regarding the serious impact that gender-motivated violence
has on victims and their families. See, e. g., H. R. Conf. Rep.
No. 103-711, p. 385 (1994); S. Rep. No. 103-138, p. 40 (1993);
S. Rep. No. 101-545, p. 33 (1990). But the existence of congressional findings is not sufficient, by itself, to sustain the
constitutionality of Commerce Clause legislation. As we
stated in Lopez, " `[S]imply because Congress may conclude
that a particular activity substantially affects interstate
commerce does not necessarily make it so.' " 514 U. S., at
557, n. 2 (quoting Hodel, 452 U. S., at 311 (Rehnquist, J.,
concurring in judgment)). Rather, " `[w]hether particular
operations affect interstate commerce sufficiently to come

punish "interstate crimes of abuse including crimes committed against
spouses or intimate partners during interstate travel and crimes committed by spouses or intimate partners who cross State lines to continue
the abuse." S. Rep. No. 103-138, p. 43 (1993). That criminal provision
has been codified at 18 U. S. C. $ 2261(a)(1), which states:

"A person who travels across a State line or enters or leaves Indian country with the intent to injure, harass, or intimidate that person's spouse or
intimate partner, and who, in the course of or as a result of such travel,
intentionally commits a crime of violence and thereby causes bodily injury
to such spouse or intimate partner, shall be punished as provided in subsection (b)."

The Courts of Appeals have uniformly upheld this criminal sanction as
an appropriate exercise of Congress' Commerce Clause authority, reasoning that "[t]he provision properly falls within the first of Lopez's categories
as it regulates the use of channels of interstate commerce--i. e., the use
of the interstate transportation routes through which persons and goods
move." United States v. Lankford, 196 F. 3d 563, 571-572 (CA5 1999)
(collecting cases) (internal quotation marks omitted).

Opinion of the Court
In these cases, Congress' findings are substantially weak-ened by the fact that they rely so heavily on a method of

reasoning that we have already rejected as unworkable if weare to maintain the Constitution's enumeration of powers.
Congress found that gender-motivated violence affects inter-state commerce

"by deterring potential victims from traveling inter-state, from engaging in employment in interstate business, and from transacting with business, and in placesinvolved in interstate commerce; . . . by diminishing national productivity, increasing medical and other costs,and decreasing the supply of and the demand for interstate products." H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 103-711, at 385.
Accord, S. Rep. No. 103-138, at 54. Given these findings and
petitioners' arguments, the concern that we expressed in
Lopez that Congress might use the Commerce Clause to
completely obliterate the Constitution's distinction betweennational and local authority seems well founded. See

Lopez,
supra, at 564. The reasoning that petitioners advance seeksto follow the but-for causal chain from the initial occurrence

of violent crime (the suppression of which has always been
the prime object of the States' police power) to every attenu-ated effect upon interstate commerce. If accepted, petitioners' reasoning would allow Congress to regulate any crimeas long as the nationwide, aggregated impact of that crime
has substantial effects on employment, production, transit,or consumption. Indeed, if Congress may regulate gendermotivated violence, it would be able to regulate murder orany other type of violence since gender-motivated violence,
as a subset of all violent crime, is certain to have lesser economic impacts than the larger class of which it is a part.

Petitioners' reasoning, moreover, will not limit Congress
to regulating violence but may, as we suggested in Lopez,
be applied equally as well to family law and other areas
of traditional state regulation since the aggregate effect of

Opinion of the Court
marriage, divorce, and childrearing on the national economyis undoubtedly significant. Congress may have recognized

this specter when it expressly precluded $ 13981 from beingused in the family law context.

6 See 42 U. S. C. $ 13981(e)(4).

Under our written Constitution, however, the limitationof congressional authority is not solely a matter of legislative grace.7 See Lopez, supra, at 575-579 (Kennedy, J.,concurring);

Marbury, 1 Cranch, at 176-178.

6 We are not the first to recognize that the but-for causal chain must
have its limits in the Commerce Clause area. In Lopez, 514 U. S., at 567,
we quoted Justice Cardozo's concurring opinion in A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U. S. 495 (1935):

"There is a view of causation that would obliterate the distinction between
what is national and what is local in the activities of commerce. Motion at
the outer rim is communicated perceptibly, though minutely, to recording
instruments at the center. A society such as ours `is an elastic medium
which transmits all tremors throughout its territory; the only question is
of their size.' " Id., at 554 (quoting United States v. A. L. A. Schechter
Poultry Corp., 76 F. 2d 617, 624 (CA2 1935) (L. Hand, J., concurring)).

7 Justice Souter's theory that Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1 (1824),

Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528
(1985), and the Seventeenth Amendment provide the answer to these
cases, see post, at 645-652, is remarkable because it undermines this central principle of our constitutional system. As we have repeatedly noted,
the Framers crafted the federal system of Government so that the people's
rights would be secured by the division of power. See, e. g., Arizona v.
Evans, 514 U. S. 1, 30 (1995) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting); Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 458-459 (1991) (cataloging the benefits of the federal
design); Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234, 242 (1985)
("The `constitutionally mandated balance of power' between the States
and the Federal Government was adopted by the Framers to ensure the
protection of `our fundamental liberties' ") (quoting Garcia, supra, at 572
(Powell, J., dissenting)). Departing from their parliamentary past, the
Framers adopted a written Constitution that further divided authority at
the federal level so that the Constitution's provisions would not be defined
solely by the political branches nor the scope of legislative power limited
only by public opinion and the Legislature's self-restraint. See, e. g., Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 176 (1803) (Marshall, C. J.) ("The powers
of the legislature are defined and limited; and that those limits may not
be mistaken, or forgotten, the constitution is written"). It is thus a " `per529US3 Unit: $U54 [10-04-01 09:35:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN

617Cite as: 529 U. S. 598 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
We accordingly reject the argument that Congress mayregulate noneconomic, violent criminal conduct based solely

on that conduct's aggregate effect on interstate commerce.The Constitution requires a distinction between what is

manent and indispensable feature of our constitutional system' " that " `the
federal judiciary is supreme in the exposition of the law of the Constitution.' " Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S. 900, 922-923 (1995) (quoting Cooper
v. Aaron, 358 U. S. 1, 18 (1958)).

No doubt the political branches have a role in interpreting and applying the Constitution, but ever since Marbury this Court has remained
the ultimate expositor of the constitutional text. As we emphasized in
United States v. Nixon, 418 U. S. 683 (1974): "In the performance of assigned constitutional duties each branch of the Government must initially
interpret the Constitution, and the interpretation of its powers by any
branch is due great respect from the others. . . . Many decisions of this
Court, however, have unequivocally reaffirmed the holding of Marbury
that `[i]t is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department
to say what the law is.' " Id., at 703 (citation omitted).

Contrary to Justice Souter's suggestion, see post, at 647-652, and
n. 14, Gibbons did not exempt the commerce power from this cardinal rule
of constitutional law. His assertion that, from Gibbons on, public opinion
has been the only restraint on the congressional exercise of the commerce
power is true only insofar as it contends that political accountability is and
has been the only limit on Congress' exercise of the commerce power
within that power's outer bounds. As the language surrounding that relied upon by Justice Souter makes clear, Gibbons did not remove from
this Court the authority to define that boundary. See Gibbons, supra, at
194-195 ("It is not intended to say that these words comprehend that
commerce, which is completely internal, which is carried on between
man and man in a State, or between different parts of the same State,
and which does not extend to or affect other States. . . . Comprehensive
as the word `among' is, it may very properly be restricted to that commerce which concerns more States than one. The phrase is not one which
would probably have been selected to indicate the completely interior
traffic of a State, because it is not an apt phrase for that purpose; and the
enumeration of the particular classes of commerce to which the power was
to be extended, would not have been made, had the intention been to
extend the power to every description. The enumeration presupposes
something not enumerated; and that something, if we regard the language
or the subject of the sentence, must be the exclusively internal commerce
of a State").

Opinion of the Court
truly national and what is truly local. Lopez, 514 U. S., at
568 (citing Jones & Laughlin Steel, 301 U. S., at 30). In recognizing this fact we preserve one of the few principles that
has been consistent since the Clause was adopted. The regulation and punishment of intrastate violence that is not directed at the instrumentalities, channels, or goods involved
in interstate commerce has always been the province of the
States. See, e. g., Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 426, 428
(1821) (Marshall, C. J.) (stating that Congress "has no general
right to punish murder committed within any of the States,"
and that it is "clear . . . that congress cannot punish felonies
generally"). Indeed, we can think of no better example of
the police power, which the Founders denied the National
Government and reposed in the States, than the suppression
of violent crime and vindication of its victims.8 See, e. g.,
Lopez, 514 U. S., at 566 ("The Constitution . . . withhold[s]
from Congress a plenary police power"); id., at 584-585
(Thomas, J., concurring) ("[W]e always have rejected read8 Justice Souter disputes our assertion that the Constitution reserves
the general police power to the States, noting that the Founders failed
to adopt several proposals for additional guarantees against federal encroachment on state authority. See post, at 645-646, and n. 14. This
argument is belied by the entire structure of the Constitution. With its
careful enumeration of federal powers and explicit statement that all powers not granted to the Federal Government are reserved, the Constitution
cannot realistically be interpreted as granting the Federal Government an
unlimited license to regulate. See, e. g., New York v. United States, 505
U. S. 144, 156-157 (1992). And, as discussed above, the Constitution's separation of federal power and the creation of the Judicial Branch indicate
that disputes regarding the extent of congressional power are largely subject to judicial review. See n. 7, supra. Moreover, the principle that
" `[t]he Constitution created a Federal Government of limited powers,' "
while reserving a generalized police power to the States, is deeply ingrained in our constitutional history. New York, supra, at 155 (quoting
Gregory v. Ashcroft, supra, at 457); see also Lopez, 514 U. S., at 584-599
(Thomas, J., concurring) (discussing the history of the debates surrounding
the adoption of the Commerce Clause and our subsequent interpretation

ings of the Commerce Clause and the scope of federal powerthat would permit Congress to exercise a police power"),

596-597, and n. 6 (noting that the first Congresses did notenact nationwide punishments for criminal conduct under
the Commerce Clause). III

Because we conclude that the Commerce Clause does notprovide Congress with authority to enact $ 13981, we address
petitioners' alternative argument that the section's civil rem-edy should be upheld as an exercise of Congress' remedial
power under $ 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. As notedabove, Congress expressly invoked the Fourteenth Amendment as a source of authority to enact $ 13981.The principles governing an analysis of congressional legislation under $ 5 are well settled. Section 5 states thatCongress may " `enforce' by `appropriate legislation' the constitutional guarantee that no State shall deprive any personof `life, liberty, or property, without due process of law,'
nor deny any person `equal protection of the laws.' " City
of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U. S. 507, 517 (1997). Section 5 is"a positive grant of legislative power," Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U. S. 641, 651 (1966), that includes authority to"prohibi[t] conduct which is not itself unconstitutional and
[to] intrud[e] into `legislative spheres of autonomy previ-ously reserved to the States.' "

Flores, supra, at 518 (quot-ing Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U. S. 445, 455 (1976)); see also

Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 528 U. S. 62, 81 (2000).However, "[a]s broad as the congressional enforcement
power is, it is not unlimited." Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U. S.112, 128 (1970); see also Kimel, supra, at 81. In fact, as we
discuss in detail below, several limitations inherent in $ 5'stext and constitutional context have been recognized since
the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted.Petitioners' $ 5 argument is founded on an assertion that
there is pervasive bias in various state justice systemsagainst victims of gender-motivated violence. This asser529US3 Unit: $U54 [10-04-01 09:35:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN
620 UNITED STATES v. MORRISON

Opinion of the Court
tion is supported by a voluminous congressional record.Specifically, Congress received evidence that many participants in state justice systems are perpetuating an arrayof erroneous stereotypes and assumptions. Congress concluded that these discriminatory stereotypes often resultin insufficient investigation and prosecution of gendermotivated crime, inappropriate focus on the behavior and
credibility of the victims of that crime, and unacceptably le-nient punishments for those who are actually convicted of

gender-motivated violence. See H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 103-711, at 385-386; S. Rep. No. 103-138, at 38, 41-55; S. Rep.
No. 102-197, at 33-35, 41, 43-47. Petitioners contend that
this bias denies victims of gender-motivated violence the
equal protection of the laws and that Congress therefore
acted appropriately in enacting a private civil remedy
against the perpetrators of gender-motivated violence to
both remedy the States' bias and deter future instances
of discrimination in the state courts.

As our cases have established, state-sponsored gender
discrimination violates equal protection unless it " `serves
"important governmental objectives and . . . the discriminatory means employed" are "substantially related to the
achievement of those objectives." ' " United States v. Virginia, 518 U. S. 515, 533 (1996) (quoting Mississippi Univ.
for Women v. Hogan, 458 U. S. 718, 724 (1982), in turn quoting Wengler v. Druggists Mut. Ins. Co., 446 U. S. 142, 150
(1980)). See also Craig v. Boren, 429 U. S. 190, 198-199
(1976). However, the language and purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment place certain limitations on the manner in which Congress may attack discriminatory conduct.
These limitations are necessary to prevent the Fourteenth
Amendment from obliterating the Framers' carefully crafted
balance of power between the States and the National
Government. See Flores, supra, at 520-524 (reviewing the
history of the Fourteenth Amendment's enactment and discussing the contemporary belief that the Amendment " `does

Opinion of the Court
not concentrate power in the general government for anypurpose of police government within the States' ") (quoting

T. Cooley, Constitutional Limitations 294, n. 1 (2d ed. 1871)).Foremost among these limitations is the time-honored principle that the Fourteenth Amendment, by its very terms, pro-hibits only state action. "[T]he principle has become firmly
embedded in our constitutional law that the action inhibited
by the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment is onlysuch action as may fairly be said to be that of the States.

That Amendment erects no shield against merely privateconduct, however discriminatory or wrongful."

Shelley v.
Kraemer, 334 U. S. 1, 13, and n. 12 (1948).

Shortly after the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted, we
decided two cases interpreting the Amendment's provisions,
United States v. Harris, 106 U. S. 629 (1883), and the Civil
Rights Cases, 109 U. S. 3 (1883). In Harris, the Court considered a challenge to $ 2 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871.
That section sought to punish "private persons" for "conspiring to deprive any one of the equal protection of the
laws enacted by the State." 106 U. S., at 639. We concluded that this law exceeded Congress' $ 5 power because
the law was "directed exclusively against the action of private persons, without reference to the laws of the State, or
their administration by her officers." Id., at 640. In so
doing, we reemphasized our statement from Virginia v.
Rives, 100 U. S. 313, 318 (1880), that " `these provisions of
the fourteenth amendment have reference to State action
exclusively, and not to any action of private individuals.' "
Harris, supra, at 639 (misquotation in Harris).

We reached a similar conclusion in the Civil Rights Cases.
In those consolidated cases, we held that the public accommodation provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1875, which
applied to purely private conduct, were beyond the scope
of the $ 5 enforcement power. 109 U. S., at 11 ("Individual
invasion of individual rights is not the subject-matter of
the [Fourteenth] [A]mendment"). See also, e. g., Romer v.

of one citizen as against another. It simply furnishes an additional guaranty against any encroachment by the States
upon the fundamental rights which belong to every citizen
as a member of society").

The force of the doctrine of stare decisis behind these
decisions stems not only from the length of time they have
been on the books, but also from the insight attributable to
the Members of the Court at that time. Every Member had
been appointed by President Lincoln, Grant, Hayes, Garfield,
or Arthur--and each of their judicial appointees obviously
had intimate knowledge and familiarity with the events surrounding the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Petitioners contend that two more recent decisions have
in effect overruled this longstanding limitation on Congress'

$ 5 authority. They rely on United States v. Guest, 383 U. S.
745 (1966), for the proposition that the rule laid down in the
Civil Rights Cases is no longer good law. In Guest, the
Court reversed the construction of an indictment under 18
U. S. C. $ 241, saying in the course of its opinion that "we
deal here with issues of statutory construction, not with
issues of constitutional power." 383 U. S., at 749. Three
Members of the Court, in a separate opinion by Justice
Brennan, expressed the view that the Civil Rights Cases

Opinion of the Court
were wrongly decided, and that Congress could under $ 5
prohibit actions by private individuals. 383 U. S., at 774
(opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). Three
other Members of the Court, who joined the opinion of the
Court, joined a separate opinion by Justice Clark which in
two or three sentences stated the conclusion that Congress
could "punis[h] all conspiracies--with or without state action--that interfere with Fourteenth Amendment rights."
Id., at 762 (concurring opinion). Justice Harlan, in another
separate opinion, commented with respect to the statement
by these Justices:

"The action of three of the Justices who joined the
Court's opinion in nonetheless cursorily pronouncing
themselves on the far-reaching constitutional questions
deliberately not reached in Part II seems to me, to say
the very least, extraordinary." Id., at 762, n. 1 (opinion
concurring in part and dissenting in part).

Though these three Justices saw fit to opine on matters
not before the Court in Guest, the Court had no occasion
to revisit the Civil Rights Cases and Harris, having determined "the indictment [charging private individuals with
conspiring to deprive blacks of equal access to state facilities]
in fact contain[ed] an express allegation of state involvement." 383 U. S., at 756. The Court concluded that the
implicit allegation of "active connivance by agents of the
State" eliminated any need to decide "the threshold level
that state action must attain in order to create rights under
the Equal Protection Clause." Ibid. All of this Justice
Clark explicitly acknowledged. See id., at 762 (concurring
opinion) ("The Court's interpretation of the indictment
clearly avoids the question whether Congress, by appropriate legislation, has the power to punish private conspiracies that interfere with Fourteenth Amendment rights,
such as the right to utilize public facilities").

624 UNITED STATES v. MORRISON

Opinion of the Court
To accept petitioners' argument, moreover, one must addto the three Justices joining Justice Brennan's reasoned explanation for his belief that the Civil Rights Cases werewrongly decided, the three Justices joining Justice Clark's
opinion who gave no explanation whatever for their similarview. This is simply not the way that reasoned constitutional adjudication proceeds. We accordingly have no hesitation in saying that it would take more than the nakeddicta contained in Justice Clark's opinion, when added to

Justice Brennan's opinion, to cast any doubt upon the endur-ing vitality of the

Civil Rights Cases and Harris.
Petitioners also rely on District of Columbia v. Carter,409 U. S. 418 (1973).

Carter was a case addressing the question whether the District of Columbia was a "State" withinthe meaning of Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983--a section

which by its terms requires state action before it may beemployed. A footnote in that opinion recites the same
litany respecting Guest that petitioners rely on. This litanyis of course entirely dicta, and in any event cannot rise above
its source. We believe that the description of the $ 5 power
contained in the Civil Rights Cases is correct:

"But where a subject is not submitted to the generallegislative power of Congress, but is only submitted

thereto for the purpose of rendering effective some prohibition against particular [s]tate legislation or [s]tateaction in reference to that subject, the power given is

limited by its object, and any legislation by Congress inthe matter must necessarily be corrective in its character, adapted to counteract and redress the operation of
such prohibited state laws or proceedings of [s]tate officers." 109 U. S., at 18.

Petitioners alternatively argue that, unlike the situation
in the Civil Rights Cases, here there has been gender-based
disparate treatment by state authorities, whereas in those
cases there was no indication of such state action. There is

Opinion of the Court
abundant evidence, however, to show that the Congressesthat enacted the Civil Rights Acts of 1871 and 1875 had a

purpose similar to that of Congress in enacting $ 13981:There were state laws on the books bespeaking equality of
treatment, but in the administration of these laws there wasdiscrimination against newly freed slaves. The statement
of Representative Garfield in the House and that of Senator
Sumner in the Senate are representative:

"[T]he chief complaint is not that the laws of the Stateare unequal, but that even where the laws are just

and equal on their face, yet, by a systematic mal-administration of them, or a neglect or refusal to enforce their provisions, a portion of the people are denied
equal protection under them." Cong. Globe, 42d Cong.,1st Sess., App. 153 (1871) (statement of Rep. Garfield).

"The Legislature of South Carolina has passed a lawgiving precisely the rights contained in your `supplementary civil rights bill.' But such a law remains adead letter on her statute-books, because the State
courts, comprised largely of those whom the Senatorwishes to obtain amnesty for, refuse to enforce it."
Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 2d Sess., 430 (1872) (statementof Sen. Sumner).

See also, e. g., Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., at 653 (state-ment of Sen. Osborn);

id., at 457 (statement of Rep. Coburn);
id., at App. 78 (statement of Rep. Perry); 2 Cong. Rec. 457(1874) (statement of Rep. Butler); 3 Cong. Rec. 945 (1875)

(statement of Rep. Lynch).But even if that distinction were valid, we do not believe
it would save $ 13981's civil remedy. For the remedy is simply not "corrective in its character, adapted to counteract and redress the operation of such prohibited [s]tate
laws or proceedings of [s]tate officers." Civil Rights Cases,
supra, at 18. Or, as we have phrased it in more recent cases,
prophylactic legislation under $ 5 must have a " `congru529US3 Unit: $U54 [10-04-01 09:35:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Section 13981 is not aimed at proscribing discrimination byofficials which the Fourteenth Amendment might not itself

proscribe; it is directed not at any State or state actor, but
at individuals who have committed criminal acts motivatedby gender bias.

In the present cases, for example, $ 13981 visits no con-sequence whatever on any Virginia public official involved in
investigating or prosecuting Brzonkala's assault. The section is, therefore, unlike any of the $ 5 remedies that we have
previously upheld. For example, in Katzenbach v. Morgan,
384 U. S. 641 (1966), Congress prohibited New York from
imposing literacy tests as a prerequisite for voting because
it found that such a requirement disenfranchised thousands
of Puerto Rican immigrants who had been educated in the
Spanish language of their home territory. That law, which
we upheld, was directed at New York officials who administered the State's election law and prohibited them from using
a provision of that law. In South Carolina v. Katzenbach,
383 U. S. 301 (1966), Congress imposed voting rights requirements on States that, Congress found, had a history
of discriminating against blacks in voting. The remedy was
also directed at state officials in those States. Similarly, in
Ex parte Virginia, 100 U. S. 339 (1880), Congress criminally
punished state officials who intentionally discriminated in
jury selection; again, the remedy was directed to the culpable state official.

Section 13981 is also different from these previously upheld remedies in that it applies uniformly throughout the
Nation. Congress' findings indicate that the problem of discrimination against the victims of gender-motivated crimes
does not exist in all States, or even most States. By contrast, the $ 5 remedy upheld in Katzenbach v. Morgan, supra,

the remedy was directed only to those States in which Con-gress found that there had been discrimination.

For these reasons, we conclude that Congress' powerunder $ 5 does not extend to the enactment of $ 13981.

IV
Petitioner Brzonkala's complaint alleges that she was thevictim of a brutal assault. But Congress' effort in $ 13981

to provide a federal civil remedy can be sustained neitherunder the Commerce Clause nor under $ 5 of the Fourteenth
Amendment. If the allegations here are true, no civilizedsystem of justice could fail to provide her a remedy for the
conduct of respondent Morrison. But under our federalsystem that remedy must be provided by the Commonwealth
of Virginia, and not by the United States. The judgment ofthe Court of Appeals is

Affirmed.
Justice Thomas, concurring.
The majority opinion correctly applies our decision inUnited States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549 (1995), and I join it

in full. I write separately only to express my view thatthe very notion of a "substantial effects" test under the
Commerce Clause is inconsistent with the original under-standing of Congress' powers and with this Court's early
Commerce Clause cases. By continuing to apply this root-less and malleable standard, however circumscribed, the
Court has encouraged the Federal Government to persist inits view that the Commerce Clause has virtually no limits.
Until this Court replaces its existing Commerce Clausejurisprudence with a standard more consistent with the
original understanding, we will continue to see Congressappropriating state police powers under the guise of regulating commerce.

628 UNITED STATES v. MORRISON

dissenting
Justice Souter, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice
Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.

The Court says both that it leaves Commerce Clause
precedent undisturbed and that the Civil Rights Remedy
of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994, 42 U. S. C.

$ 13981, exceeds Congress's power under that Clause. I find
the claims irreconcilable and respectfully dissent.1

I
Our cases, which remain at least nominally undisturbed,
stand for the following propositions. Congress has the
power to legislate with regard to activity that, in the aggregate, has a substantial effect on interstate commerce. See
Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111, 124-128 (1942); Hodel v.
Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn., Inc., 452
U. S. 264, 277 (1981). The fact of such a substantial effect is
not an issue for the courts in the first instance, ibid., but
for the Congress, whose institutional capacity for gathering
evidence and taking testimony far exceeds ours. By passing legislation, Congress indicates its conclusion, whether
explicitly or not, that facts support its exercise of the commerce power. The business of the courts is to review the
congressional assessment, not for soundness but simply for
the rationality of concluding that a jurisdictional basis
exists in fact. See ibid. Any explicit findings that Congress chooses to make, though not dispositive of the question of rationality, may advance judicial review by identifying factual authority on which Congress relied. Applying

those propositions in these cases can lead to only one
conclusion.

One obvious difference from United States v. Lopez, 514
U. S. 549 (1995), is the mountain of data assembled by Con1 Finding the law a valid exercise of Commerce Clause power, I have
no occasion to reach the question whether it might also be sustained as an
exercise of Congress's power to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment.

2 It is true that these data relate to the effects of violence against women
generally, while the civil rights remedy limits its scope to "crimes of violence motivated by gender"--presumably a somewhat narrower subset
of acts. See 42 U. S. C. $ 13981(b). But the meaning of "motivated by
gender" has not been elucidated by lower courts, much less by this one,
so the degree to which the findings rely on acts not redressable by the
civil rights remedy is unclear. As will appear, however, much of the
data seems to indicate behavior with just such motivation. In any event,
adopting a cramped reading of the statutory text, and thereby increasing the constitutional difficulties, would directly contradict one of the
most basic canons of statutory interpretation. See NLRB v. Jones &
Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U. S. 1, 30 (1937). Having identified the problem of violence against women, Congress may address what it sees as the
most threatening manifestation; "reform may take one step at a time."

Based on the data thus partially summarized, Congress
found that

"crimes of violence motivated by gender have a substantial adverse effect on interstate commerce, by deterring potential victims from traveling interstate, from
engaging in employment in interstate business, and
from transacting with business, and in places involved,
in interstate commerce . . . [,] by diminishing national
productivity, increasing medical and other costs, and
decreasing the supply of and the demand for interstate
products . . . ." H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 103-711, p. 385
(1994).

Congress thereby explicitly stated the predicate for the
exercise of its Commerce Clause power. Is its conclusion
irrational in view of the data amassed? True, the methodology of particular studies may be challenged, and some of
the figures arrived at may be disputed. But the sufficiency
of the evidence before Congress to provide a rational basis
for the finding cannot seriously be questioned. Cf. Turner

Indeed, the legislative record here is far more voluminousthan the record compiled by Congress and found sufficient in
two prior cases upholding Title II of the Civil Rights Actof 1964 against Commerce Clause challenges. In Heart of
Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U. S. 241 (1964),and

Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U. S. 294 (1964), the Courtreferred to evidence showing the consequences of racial discrimination by motels and restaurants on interstate com-merce. Congress had relied on compelling anecdotal reports that individual instances of segregation cost thousandsto millions of dollars. See Civil Rights--Public Accommodations, Hearings on S. 1732 before the Senate Committeeon Commerce, 88th Cong., 1st Sess., App. V, pp. 1383-1387
(1963). Congress also had evidence that the average blackfamily spent substantially less than the average white family
in the same income range on public accommodations, andthat discrimination accounted for much of the difference.

discrimination in the 1960's in reducing the mobility ofemployees and their production and consumption of goods

shipped in interstate commerce. Like racial discrimina-tion, "[g]ender-based violence bars its most likely targets--
women--from full partic[ipation] in the national economy."Id., at 54.

If the analogy to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is not plainenough, one can always look back a bit further. In

Wickard,we upheld the application of the Agricultural Adjustment

Act to the planting and consumption of homegrown wheat.The effect on interstate commerce in that case followed from
the possibility that wheat grown at home for personal con-sumption could either be drawn into the market by rising
prices, or relieve its grower of any need to purchase wheatin the market. See 317 U. S., at 127-129. The Commerce
Clause predicate was simply the effect of the production ofwheat for home consumption on supply and demand in interstate commerce. Supply and demand for goods in interstatecommerce will also be affected by the deaths of 2,000 to
4,000 women annually at the hands of domestic abusers,see S. Rep. No. 101-545, at 36, and by the reduction in
the work force by the 100,000 or more rape victims wholose their jobs each year or are forced to quit, see

id., at 56;H. R. Rep. No. 103-395, at 25-26. Violence against women

may be found to affect interstate commerce and affect itsubstantially.

exercising it to the limit. I and other Members of this Court appearing
before Congress have repeatedly argued against the federalization of traditional state crimes and the extension of federal remedies to problems
for which the States have historically taken responsibility and may deal
with today if they have the will to do so. See Hearings before a Subcommittee of the House Committee on Appropriations, 104th Cong., 1st

The Act would have passed muster at any time between
Wickard in 1942 and Lopez in 1995, a period in which thelaw enjoyed a stable understanding that congressional power

under the Commerce Clause, complemented by the authorityof the Necessary and Proper Clause, Art. I, $ 8, cl. 18, extended to all activity that, when aggregated, has a substan-tial effect on interstate commerce. As already noted, this
understanding was secure even against the turmoil at thepassage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, in the aftermath of
which the Court not only reaffirmed the cumulative effectsand rational basis features of the substantial effects test,
see Heart of Atlanta, supra, at 258; McClung, supra, at301-305, but declined to limit the commerce power through
a formal distinction between legislation focused on "com-merce" and statutes addressing "moral and social wrong[s],"
Heart of Atlanta, supra, at 257.The fact that the Act does not pass muster before the
Court today is therefore proof, to a degree that Lopez wasnot, that the Court's nominal adherence to the substantial
effects test is merely that. Although a new jurisprudencehas not emerged with any distinctness, it is clear that some
congressional conclusions about obviously substantial, cumu-lative effects on commerce are being assigned lesser values
than the once-stable doctrine would assign them. These de-valuations are accomplished not by any express repudiation
of the substantial effects test or its application throughthe aggregation of individual conduct, but by supplanting
rational basis scrutiny with a new criterion of review.

Thus the elusive heart of the majority's analysis in thesecases is its statement that Congress's findings of fact are

"weakened" by the presence of a disfavored "method ofreasoning." Ante, at 615. This seems to suggest that the
"substantial effects" analysis is not a factual enquiry, forCongress in the first instance with subsequent judicial review looking only to the rationality of the congressional con-clusion, but one of a rather different sort, dependent upon a
uniquely judicial competence.This new characterization of substantial effects has no
support in our cases (the self-fulfilling prophecies of Lopezaside), least of all those the majority cites. Perhaps this
explains why the majority is not content to rest on itscited precedent but claims a textual justification for moving
toward its new system of congressional deference subject toselective discounts. Thus it purports to rely on the sensible
and traditional understanding that the listing in the Con-stitution of some powers implies the exclusion of others
unmentioned. See Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 195 (1824);ante, at 610; The Federalist No. 45, p. 313 (J. Cooke ed. 1961)
(J. Madison).11 The majority stresses that Art. I, $ 8, enu11 The claim that powers not granted were withheld was the chief Federalist argument against the necessity of a bill of rights. Bills of rights,
Hamilton claimed, "have no application to constitutions professedly
founded upon the power of the people, and executed by their immediate
representatives and servants. Here, in strictness, the people surrender
nothing, and as they retain every thing, they have no need of particular
reservations." The Federalist No. 84, at 578. James Wilson went further in the Pennsylvania ratifying convention, asserting that an enumeration of rights was positively dangerous because it suggested, conversely, that every right not reserved was surrendered. See 2 J. Elliot,
Debates in the Several State Conventions on the Adoption of the Federal
Constitution 436-437 (2d ed. 1863) (hereinafter Elliot's Debates). The
Federalists did not, of course, prevail on this point; most States voted
for the Constitution only after proposing amendments and the First Congress speedily adopted a Bill of Rights. See Garcia v. San Antonio

merates the powers of Congress, including the commercepower, an enumeration implying the exclusion of powers not

enumerated. It follows, for the majority, not only that theremust be some limits to "commerce," but that some particular
subjects arguably within the commerce power can be identi-fied in advance as excluded, on the basis of characteristics
other than their commercial effects. Such exclusions comeinto sight when the activity regulated is not itself commercial or when the States have traditionally addressed it inthe exercise of the general police power, conferred under the
state constitutions but never extended to Congress underthe Constitution of the Nation, see

Lopez, 514 U. S., at 566.Ante, at 615-616.

The premise that the enumeration of powers implies thatother powers are withheld is sound; the conclusion that
some particular categories of subject matter are thereforepresumptively beyond the reach of the commerce power is,
however, a non sequitur. From the fact that Art. I, $ 8, cl. 3,grants an authority limited to regulating commerce, it follows only that Congress may claim no authority under that

commerce power may overlap the reserved state police power, in such
cases federal authority is supreme. See, e. g., Lake Shore & Michigan

acts with reference to a matter confided to it by the Constitution, then
its statutes displace all conflicting local regulations touching that matter,
although such regulations may have been established in pursuance of a
power not surrendered by the States to the General Government"); United

Obviously, it would not be inconsistent with the text of
the Commerce Clause itself to declare "noncommercial" pri-mary activity beyond or presumptively beyond the scope

of the commerce power. That variant of categorical ap-proach is not, however, the sole textually permissible way
of defining the scope of the Commerce Clause, and any suchneat limitation would at least be suspect in the light of the
final sentence of Art. I, $ 8, authorizing Congress to make
"all Laws . . . necessary and proper" to give effect toits enumerated powers such as commerce. See

United
States v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100, 118 (1941) ("The power ofCongress . . . extends to those activities intrastate which so

affect interstate commerce or the exercise of the power ofCongress over it as to make regulation of them appropriate
means to the attainment of a legitimate end, the exercise ofthe granted power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce"). Accordingly, for significant periods of our history,the Court has defined the commerce power as plenary, unsusceptible to categorical exclusions, and this was the view expressed throughout the latter part of the 20th century inthe substantial effects test. These two conceptions of the

commerce power, plenary and categorically limited, are infact old rivals, and today's revival of their competition summons up familiar history, a brief reprise of which may behelpful in posing what I take to be the key question going to
the legitimacy of the majority's decision to breathe new lifeinto the approach of categorical limitation.

Chief Justice Marshall's seminal opinion in Gibbons v.
Ogden, 9 Wheat., at 193-194, construed the commerce power
from the start with "a breadth never yet exceeded," Wickardv.

Filburn, 317 U. S., at 120. In particular, it is worth
noting, the Court in Wickard did not regard its holding asexceeding the scope of Chief Justice Marshall's view of

interstate commerce; Wickard applied an aggregate effects
test to ostensibly domestic, noncommercial farming con-sistently with Chief Justice Marshall's indication that the

commerce power may be understood by its exclusion ofsubjects, among others, "which do not affect other States,"
Gibbons, 9 Wheat., at 195. This plenary view of the power
has either prevailed or been acknowledged by this Court at
every stage of our jurisprudence. See, e. g., id., at 197;
Nashville, C. & St. L. R. Co. v. Alabama, 128 U. S. 96, 99-100
(1888); Lottery Case, 188 U. S. 321, 353 (1903); Minnesota

supra, at 115; Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States,
379 U. S., at 255; Hodel v. Indiana, 452 U. S., at 324. And it
was this understanding, free of categorical qualifications,
that prevailed in the period after 1937 through Lopez, as
summed up by Justice Harlan: " `Of course, the mere fact that
Congress has said when particular activity shall be deemed
to affect commerce does not preclude further examination by
this Court. But where we find that the legislators . . . have
a rational basis for finding a chosen regulatory scheme necessary to the protection of commerce, our investigation is at an
end.' " Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U. S. 183, 190 (1968) (quoting
Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U. S., at 303-304).

Justice Harlan spoke with the benefit of hindsight, for he
had seen the result of rejecting the plenary view, and today's
attempt to distinguish between primary activities affecting
commerce in terms of the relatively commercial or noncommercial character of the primary conduct proscribed
comes with the pedigree of near tragedy that I outlined in

United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S., at 603 (dissenting opinion).In the half century following the modern activation of the

commerce power with passage of the Interstate CommerceAct in 1887, this Court from time to time created categorical
enclaves beyond congressional reach by declaring such activ-ities as "mining," "production," "manufacturing," and union
membership to be outside the definition of "commerce" and
by limiting application of the effects test to "direct" ratherthan "indirect" commercial consequences. See,

e. g., United
States v. E. C. Knight Co., 156 U. S. 1 (1895) (narrowly con-struing the Sherman Antitrust Act in light of the distinction

between "commerce" and "manufacture"); In re Heff, 197
U. S. 488, 505-506 (1905) (stating that Congress could not
regulate the intrastate sale of liquor); The Employers' Liability Cases, 207 U. S. 463, 495-496 (1908) (invalidating law
governing tort liability for common carriers operating in
interstate commerce because the effects on commerce were
indirect); Adair v. United States, 208 U. S. 161 (1908) (holding that labor union membership fell outside "commerce");
Hammer v. Dagenhart, 247 U. S. 251 (1918) (invalidating
law prohibiting interstate shipment of goods manufactured
with child labor as a regulation of "manufacture"); A. L. A.
Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U. S. 495, 545-
548 (1935) (invalidating regulation of activities that only
"indirectly" affected commerce); Railroad Retirement Bd.
v. Alton R. Co., 295 U. S. 330, 368-369 (1935) (invalidating
pension law for railroad workers on the grounds that conditions of employment were only indirectly linked to commerce); Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U. S. 238, 303-304
(1936) (holding that regulation of unfair labor practices in
mining regulated "production," not "commerce").

Since adherence to these formalistically contrived confines
of commerce power in large measure provoked the judicial
crisis of 1937, one might reasonably have doubted that
Members of this Court would ever again toy with a return
to the days before NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp.,

301 U. S. 1 (1937), which brought the earlier and nearly dis-astrous experiment to an end. And yet today's decision can

only be seen as a step toward recapturing the prior mistakes.Its revival of a distinction between commercial and noncommercial conduct is at odds with Wickard, which re-pudiated that analysis, and the enquiry into commercial
purpose, first intimated by the Lopez concurrence, see Lopez,
supra, at 580 (opinion of Kennedy, J.), is cousin to theintent-based analysis employed in

Hammer, supra, at 271-
272, but rejected for Commerce Clause purposes in Heart
of Atlanta, supra, at 257, and Darby, 312 U. S., at 115.

Why is the majority tempted to reject the lesson so pain-fully learned in 1937? An answer emerges from contrasting Wickard with one of the predecessor cases it superseded.It was obvious in

Wickard that growing wheat for consumption right on the farm was not "commerce" in the commonvocabulary,

13 but that did not matter constitutionally so

long as the aggregated activity of domestic wheat growing
affected commerce substantially. Just a few years before

13 Contrary to the Court's suggestion, ante, at 611, n. 4, Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111 (1942), applied the substantial effects test to domestic
agricultural production for domestic consumption, an activity that cannot
fairly be described as commercial, despite its commercial consequences in
affecting or being affected by the demand for agricultural products in the
commercial market. The Wickard Court admitted that Filburn's activity
"may not be regarded as commerce" but insisted that "it may still, whatever its nature, be reached by Congress if it exerts a substantial economic
effect on interstate commerce . . . ." Id., at 125. The characterization of
home wheat production as "commerce" or not is, however, ultimately beside the point. For if substantial effects on commerce are proper subjects
of concern under the Commerce Clause, what difference should it make
whether the causes of those effects are themselves commercial? Cf., e. g.,
National Organization for Women, Inc. v. Scheidler, 510 U. S. 249, 258
(1994) ("An enterprise surely can have a detrimental influence on interstate or foreign commerce without having its own profit-seeking motives"). The Court's answer is that it makes a difference to federalism,
and the legitimacy of the Court's new judicially derived federalism is the
crux of our disagreement. See infra, at 644-646.

Wickard, however, it had certainly been no less obviousthat "mining" practices could substantially affect commerce,

even though Carter Coal Co., supra, had held mining regu-lation beyond the national commerce power. When we try
to fathom the difference between the two cases, it is clearthat they did not go in different directions because the
Carter Coal Court could not understand a causal connection
that the Wickard Court could grasp; the difference, rather,turned on the fact that the Court in

Carter Coal had a
reason for trying to maintain its categorical, formalisticdistinction, while that reason had been abandoned by the

time Wickard was decided. The reason was laissez-faire
economics, the point of which was to keep government interference to a minimum. See Lopez, supra, at 605-606
(Souter, J., dissenting). The Court in Carter Coal was
still trying to create a laissez-faire world out of the 20thcentury economy, and formalistic commercial distinctions
were thought to be useful instruments in achieving that object. The Court in Wickard knew it could not do any such
thing and in the aftermath of the New Deal had long since
stopped attempting the impossible. Without the animating
economic theory, there was no point in contriving formalisms in a war with Chief Justice Marshall's conception of the
commerce power.

If we now ask why the formalistic economic/noneconomic
distinction might matter today, after its rejection in Wickard, the answer is not that the majority fails to see causal
connections in an integrated economic world. The answer
is that in the minds of the majority there is a new animating
theory that makes categorical formalism seem useful again.
Just as the old formalism had value in the service of an
economic conception, the new one is useful in serving a
conception of federalism. It is the instrument by which
assertions of national power are to be limited in favor of
preserving a supposedly discernible, proper sphere of state
autonomy to legislate or refrain from legislating as the in529US3 Unit: $U54 [10-04-01 09:35:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN

dividual States see fit. The legitimacy of the Court's cur-rent emphasis on the noncommercial nature of regulated

activity, then, does not turn on any logic serving the textof the Commerce Clause or on the realism of the majority's
view of the national economy. The essential issue is ratherthe strength of the majority's claim to have a constitutional
warrant for its current conception of a federal relation-ship enforceable by this Court through limits on otherwise
plenary commerce power. This conception is the subjectof the majority's second categorical discount applied today
to the facts bearing on the substantial effects test.

The Court finds it relevant that the statute addresses con-duct traditionally subject to state prohibition under domestic

criminal law, a fact said to have some heightened signifi-cance when the violent conduct in question is not itself aimed
directly at interstate commerce or its instrumentalities.Ante, at 609. Again, history seems to be recycling, for the
theory of traditional state concern as grounding a limitingprinciple has been rejected previously, and more than once.
It was disapproved in Darby, 312 U. S., at 123-124, and heldinsufficient standing alone to limit the commerce power in
Hodel, 452 U. S., at 276-277. In the particular context ofthe Fair Labor Standards Act it was rejected in

Marylandv. Wirtz, 392 U. S. 183 (1968), with the recognition that

"[t]here is no general doctrine implied in the Federal Con-stitution that the two governments, national and state, are
each to exercise its powers so as not to interfere with thefree and full exercise of the powers of the other." Id., at
195 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court held itto be "clear that the Federal Government, when acting
within a delegated power, may override countervailing stateinterests, whether these be described as `governmental' or
`proprietary' in character." Ibid. While Wirtz was lateroverruled by

833 (1976), that case was itself repudiated in Garcia v. San
Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528
(1985), which held that the concept of "traditional govern-mental function" (as an element of the immunity doctrine

under Hodel) was incoherent, there being no explanation
that would make sense of the multifarious decisions placing
some functions on one side of the line, some on the other.
469 U. S., at 546-547. The effort to carve out inviolable
state spheres within the spectrum of activities substantially
affecting commerce was, of course, just as irreconcilable with
Gibbons's explanation of the national commerce power as
being as "absolut[e] as it would be in a single government,"
9 Wheat., at 197.14

14 The Constitution of 1787 did, in fact, forbid some exercises of the
commerce power. Article I, $ 9, cl. 6, barred Congress from giving preference to the ports of one State over those of another. More strikingly,
the Framers protected the slave trade from federal interference, see
Art. I, $ 9, cl. 1, and confirmed the power of a State to guarantee the
chattel status of slaves who fled to another State, see Art. IV, $ 2, cl. 3.
These reservations demonstrate the plenary nature of the federal power;
the exceptions prove the rule. Apart from them, proposals to carve
islands of state authority out of the stream of commerce power were
entirely unsuccessful. Roger Sherman's proposed definition of federal
legislative power as excluding "matters of internal police" met Gouverneur Morris's response that "[t]he internal police . . . ought to be infringed in many cases" and was voted down eight to two. 2 Records
of the Federal Convention of 1787, pp. 25-26 (M. Farrand ed. 1911) (hereinafter Farrand). The Convention similarly rejected Sherman's attempt
to include in Article V a proviso that "no state shall . . . be affected in its
internal police." 5 Elliot's Debates 551-552. Finally, Rufus King suggested an explicit bill of rights for the States, a device that might indeed
have set aside the areas the Court now declares off-limits. 1 Farrand 493
("As the fundamental rights of individuals are secured by express provisions in the State Constitutions; why may not a like security be provided
for the Rights of States in the National Constitution"). That proposal,
too, came to naught. In short, to suppose that enumerated powers must
have limits is sensible; to maintain that there exist judicially identifiable
areas of state regulation immune to the plenary congressional commerce

The objection to reviving traditional state spheres ofaction as a consideration in commerce analysis, however,

not only rests on the portent of incoherence, but is com-pounded by a further defect just as fundamental. The defect, in essence, is the majority's rejection of the Found-ers' considered judgment that politics, not judicial review,
should mediate between state and national interests as thestrength and legislative jurisdiction of the National Government inevitably increased through the expected growthof the national economy.

15 Whereas today's majority takes

a leaf from the book of the old judicial economists in sayingthat the Court should somehow draw the line to keep the

federal relationship in a proper balance, Madison, Wilson,and Marshall understood the Constitution very differently.

Although Madison had emphasized the conception of aNational Government of discrete powers (a conception that
a number of the ratifying conventions thought was too in-determinate to protect civil liberties),

16 Madison himself

must have sensed the potential scope of some of the powersgranted (such as the authority to regulate commerce), for he

power even though falling within the limits defined by the substantial
effects test is to deny our constitutional history.

15 That the national economy and the national legislative power expand

in tandem is not a recent discovery. This Court accepted the prospect
well over 100 years ago, noting that the commerce powers "are not confined to the instrumentalities of commerce, or the postal service known or
in use when the Constitution was adopted, but they keep pace with the
progress of the country, and adapt themselves to the new developments
of time and circumstances." Pensacola Telegraph Co. v. Western Union
Telegraph Co., 96 U. S. 1, 9 (1878). See also, e. g., Farmers Loan & Trust
Co. v. Minnesota, 280 U. S. 204, 211-212 (1930) ("Primitive conditions have
passed; business is now transacted on a national scale").

16 As mentioned in n. 11, supra, many state conventions voted in favor

of the Constitution only after proposing amendments. See 1 Elliot's Debates 322-323 (Massachusetts), 325 (South Carolina), 325-327 (New Hampshire), 327 (Virginia), 327-331 (New York), 331-332 (North Carolina), 334-

took care in The Federalist No. 46 to hedge his argument for
limited power by explaining the importance of national politics in protecting the States' interests. The National Government "will partake sufficiently of the spirit [of the States],
to be disinclined to invade the rights of the individual States,
or the prerogatives of their governments." The Federalist
No. 46, p. 319 (J. Cooke ed. 1961). James Wilson likewise
noted that "it was a favorite object in the Convention" to
secure the sovereignty of the States, and that it had been
achieved through the structure of the Federal Government.
2 Elliot's Debates 438-439.17 The Framers of the Bill of
Rights, in turn, may well have sensed that Madison and Wilson were right about politics as the determinant of the federal balance within the broad limits of a power like commerce, for they formulated the Tenth Amendment without
any provision comparable to the specific guarantees proposed
for individual liberties.18 In any case, this Court recognized
the political component of federalism in the seminal Gibbons
opinion. After declaring the plenary character of congressional power within the sphere of activity affecting commerce, the Chief Justice spoke for the Court in explaining
that there was only one restraint on its valid exercise:

17 Statements to similar effect pervade the ratification debates. See,
e. g., 2 id., at 166-170 (Massachusetts, remarks of Samuel Stillman); 2 id.,
at 251-253 (New York, remarks of Alexander Hamilton); 4 id., at 95-98
(North Carolina, remarks of James Iredell).

18 The majority's special solicitude for "areas of traditional state regulation," ante, at 615, is thus founded not on the text of the Constitution
but on what has been termed the "spirit of the Tenth Amendment,"
Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S., at 585
(O'Connor, J., dissenting) (emphasis in original). Susceptibility to what
Justice Holmes more bluntly called "some invisible radiation from the
general terms of the Tenth Amendment," Missouri v. Holland, 252 U. S.
416, 434 (1920), has increased in recent years, in disregard of his admonition that "[w]e must consider what this country has become in deciding
what that Amendment has reserved," ibid.

"The wisdom and the discretion of Congress, their iden-tity with the people, and the influence which their constituents possess at elections, are, in this, as in manyother instances, as that, for example, of declaring war,
the sole restraints on which they have relied, to securethem from its abuse. They are the restraints on which
the people must often rely solely, in all representativegovernments."

Gibbons, 9 Wheat., at 197.

Politics as the moderator of the congressional employmentof the commerce power was the theme many years later in

Wickard, for after the Court acknowledged the breadth ofthe

Gibbons formulation it invoked Chief Justice Marshallyet again in adding that "[h]e made emphatic the embracing

and penetrating nature of this power by warning that effec-tive restraints on its exercise must proceed from political
rather than judicial processes." Wickard, 317 U. S., at 120(citation omitted). Hence, "conflicts of economic interest . . .
are wisely left under our system to resolution by Congressunder its more flexible and responsible legislative process.
Such conflicts rarely lend themselves to judicial determi-nation. And with the wisdom, workability, or fairness, of
the plan of regulation we have nothing to do." Id., at 129(footnote omitted).

As with "conflicts of economic interest," so with sup-posed conflicts of sovereign political interests implicated
by the Commerce Clause: the Constitution remits them topolitics. The point can be put no more clearly than the
Court put it the last time it repudiated the notion thatsome state activities categorically defied the commerce
power as understood in accordance with generally acceptedconcepts. After confirming Madison's and Wilson's views
with a recitation of the sources of state influence in thestructure of the National Constitution,

Garcia, 469 U. S.,at 550-552, the Court disposed of the possibility of identifying "principled constitutional limitations on the scope ofCongress' Commerce Clause powers over the States merely

by relying on a priori definitions of state sovereignty," id.,at 548. It concluded that

"the Framers chose to rely on a federal system in whichspecial restraints on federal power over the States inhered principally in the workings of the National Gov-ernment itself, rather than in discrete limitations on the
objects of federal authority. State sovereign interests,then, are more properly protected by procedural safeguards inherent in the structure of the federal systemthan by judicially created limitations on federal power."
Id., at 552.
The Garcia Court's rejection of "judicially created limitations" in favor of the intended reliance on national poli-tics was all the more powerful owing to the Court's explicit

recognition that in the centuries since the framing the rela-tive powers of the two sovereign systems have markedly
changed. Nationwide economic integration is the norm,
the national political power has been augmented by its vast
revenues, and the power of the States has been drawn down
by the Seventeenth Amendment, eliminating selection of
senators by state legislature in favor of direct election.

The Garcia majority recognized that economic growth
and the burgeoning of federal revenue have not amended
the Constitution, which contains no circuit breaker to preclude the political consequences of these developments. Nor
is there any justification for attempts to nullify the natural
political impact of the particular amendment that was
adopted. The significance for state political power of ending
state legislative selection of senators was no secret in 1913,
and the amendment was approved despite public comment
on that very issue. Representative Franklin Bartlett, after
quoting Madison's Federalist No. 62, as well as remarks by
George Mason and John Dickinson during the Constitutional Convention, concluded, "It follows, therefore, that the

framers of the Constitution, were they present in this Houseto-day, would inevitably regard this resolution as a most

direct blow at the doctrine of State's rights and at the integ-rity of the State sovereignties; for if you once deprive a State
as a collective organism of all share in the General Govern-ment, you annihilate its federative importance." 26 Cong.
Rec. 7774 (1894). Massachusetts Senator George Hoar like-wise defended indirect election of the Senate as "a great security for the rights of the States." S. Doc. No. 232, 59thCong., 1st Sess., 21 (1906). And Elihu Root warned that
if the selection of senators should be taken from state leg-islatures, "the tide that now sets toward the Federal Government will swell in volume and power." 46 Cong. Rec.2243 (1911). "The time will come," he continued, "when
the Government of the United States will be driven tothe exercise of more arbitrary and unconsidered power, will
be driven to greater concentration, will be driven to extendits functions into the internal affairs of the States."

Ibid.See generally Rossum, The Irony of Constitutional Democracy: Federalism, the Supreme Court, and the SeventeenthAmendment, 36 San Diego L. Rev. 671, 712-714 (1999) (noting federalism-based objections to the Seventeenth Amend-ment). These warnings did not kill the proposal; the
Amendment was ratified, and today it is only the ratification,not the predictions, which this Court can legitimately heed.

19 The majority tries to deflect the objection that it blocks an intended
political process by explaining that the Framers intended politics to set
the federal balance only within the sphere of permissible commerce legislation, whereas we are looking to politics to define that sphere (in derogation even of Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137 (1803)), ante, at 616.
But we all accept the view that politics is the arbiter of state interests
only within the realm of legitimate congressional action under the commerce power. Neither Madison nor Wilson nor Marshall, nor the Jones &
Laughlin, Darby, Wickard, or Garcia Courts, suggested that politics defines the commerce power. Nor do we, even though we recognize that

Amendments that alter the balance of power betweenthe National and State Governments, like the Fourteenth,

or that change the way the States are represented withinthe Federal Government, like the Seventeenth, are not rips
in the fabric of the Framers' Constitution, inviting judicialrepairs. The Seventeenth Amendment may indeed have
lessened the enthusiasm of the Senate to represent theStates as discrete sovereignties, but the Amendment did
not convert the judiciary into an alternate shield againstthe commerce power.

C
The Court's choice to invoke considerations of traditionalstate regulation in these cases is especially odd in light of

a distinction recognized in the now-repudiated opinion forthe Court in Usery. In explaining that there was no inconsistency between declaring the States immune to thecommerce power exercised in the Fair Labor Standards Act,
but subject to it under the Economic Stabilization Act of1970, as decided in Fry v. United States, 421 U. S. 542 (1975),
the Court spoke of the latter statute as dealing with a se-rious threat affecting all the political components of the fedof influence for politics than the Framers would have envisioned. Politics
has legitimate authority, for all of us on both sides of the disagreement,
only within the legitimate compass of the commerce power. The majority
claims merely to be engaging in the judicial task of patrolling the outer
boundaries of that congressional authority. See ante, at 616-617, n. 7.
That assertion cannot be reconciled with our statements of the substantial
effects test, which have not drawn the categorical distinctions the majority
favors. See, e. g., Wickard, 317 U. S., at 125; United States v. Darby, 312
U. S. 100, 118-119 (1941). The majority's attempt to circumscribe the
commerce power by defining it in terms of categorical exceptions can only
be seen as a revival of similar efforts that led to near tragedy for the
Court and incoherence for the law. If history's lessons are accepted as
guides for Commerce Clause interpretation today, as we do accept them,
then the subject matter of the Act falls within the commerce power and
the choice to legislate nationally on that subject, or to except it from national legislation because the States have traditionally dealt with it, should
be a political choice and only a political choice.

eral system, "which only collective action by the NationalGovernment might forestall." Usery, 426 U. S., at 853.

Today's majority, however, finds no significance whateverin the state support for the Act based upon the States'
acknowledged failure to deal adequately with gender-basedviolence in state courts, and the belief of their own law enforcement agencies that national action is essential.20The National Association of Attorneys General supported
the Act unanimously, see Violence Against Women: Victimsof the System, Hearing on S. 15 before the Senate Committee
on the Judiciary, 102d Cong., 1st Sess., 37-38 (1991), andAttorneys General from 38 States urged Congress to enact
the Civil Rights Remedy, representing that "the current sys-tem for dealing with violence against women is inadequate,"
see Crimes of Violence Motivated by Gender, Hearing before
the Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights of theHouse Committee on the Judiciary, 103d Cong., 1st Sess.,

34-36 (1993). It was against this record of failure at the
state level that the Act was passed to provide the choiceof a federal forum in place of the state-court systems found

inadequate to stop gender-biased violence. See Womenand Violence, Hearing before the Senate Committee on the
Judiciary, 101st Cong., 2d Sess., 2 (1990) (statement ofSen. Biden) (noting importance of federal forum).

21 The Act

accordingly offers a federal civil rights remedy aimed exactly

20 See n. 7, supra. The point here is not that I take the position that
the States are incapable of dealing adequately with domestic violence if
their political leaders have the will to do so; it is simply that the Congress
had evidence from which it could find a national statute necessary, so that
its passage obviously survives Commerce Clause scrutiny.

21 The majority's concerns about accountability strike me as entirely

misplaced. Individuals, such as the defendants in this action, haled into
federal court and sued under the United States Code, are quite aware of
which of our dual sovereignties is attempting to regulate their behavior.
Had Congress chosen, in the exercise of its powers under $ 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, to proceed instead by regulating the States, rather
than private individuals, this accountability would be far less plain.

at violence against women, as an alternative to the genericstate tort causes of action found to be poor tools of action by

the state task forces. See S. Rep. No. 101-545, at 45 (notingdifficulty of fitting gender-motivated crimes into commonlaw categories). As the 1993 Senate Report put it, "TheViolence Against Women Act is intended to respond both to
the underlying attitude that this violence is somehow lessserious than other crime and to the resulting failure of our
criminal justice system to address such violence. Its goalsare both symbolic and practical . . . ." S. Rep. No. 103-138,
at 38.The collective opinion of state officials that the Act was
needed continues virtually unchanged, and when the CivilRights Remedy was challenged in court, the States came
to its defense. Thirty-six of them and the Commonwealthof Puerto Rico have filed an

amicus brief in support ofpetitioners in these cases, and only one State has taken respondents' side. It is, then, not the least irony of these casesthat the States will be forced to enjoy the new federalism
whether they want it or not. For with the Court's decisiontoday, Antonio Morrison, like

Carter Coal's James Carterbefore him, has "won the states' rights plea against the

states themselves." R. Jackson, The Struggle for JudicialSupremacy 160 (1941).

All of this convinces me that today's ebb of the com-merce power rests on error, and at the same time leads me

to doubt that the majority's view will prove to be enduringlaw. There is yet one more reason for doubt. Although we
sense the presence of Carter Coal, Schechter, and Usery onceagain, the majority embraces them only at arm's-length.
Where such decisions once stood for rules, today's opinionpoints to considerations by which substantial effects are discounted. Cases standing for the sufficiency of substantialeffects are not overruled; cases overruled since 1937 are not
quite revived. The Court's thinking betokens less clearly

Carter Coal and Usery than to something like the unsteady
state of obscenity law between Redrup v. New York, 386
U. S. 767 (1967) (per curiam), and Miller v. California,
413 U. S. 15 (1973), a period in which the failure to provide
a workable definition left this Court to review each case
ad hoc. See id., at 22, n. 3; Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. Dallas,
390 U. S. 676, 706-708 (1968) (Harlan, J., dissenting). As our
predecessors learned then, the practice of such ad hoc review cannot preserve the distinction between the judicial
and the legislative, and this Court, in any event, lacks the
institutional capacity to maintain such a regime for very
long. This one will end when the majority realizes that the
conception of the commerce power for which it entertains
hopes would inevitably fail the test expressed in Justice
Holmes's statement that "[t]he first call of a theory of law is
that it should fit the facts." O. Holmes, The Common Law
167 (Howe ed. 1963). The facts that cannot be ignored today
are the facts of integrated national commerce and a political relationship between States and Nation much affected
by their respective treasuries and constitutional modifications adopted by the people. The federalism of some earlier
time is no more adequate to account for those facts today
than the theory of laissez-faire was able to govern the national economy 70 years ago.

No one denies the importance of the Constitution's federalist principles. Its state/federal division of authority
protects liberty--both by restricting the burdens that government can impose from a distance and by facilitating
citizen participation in government that is closer to home.

original federalist understanding where the CommerceClause is at issue.

I
The majority holds that the federal commerce powerdoes not extend to such "noneconomic" activities as "noneconomic, violent criminal conduct" that significantly affectsinterstate commerce only if we "aggregate" the interstate
"effect[s]" of individual instances. Ante, at 617. Justice
Souter explains why history, precedent, and legal logic mili-tate against the majority's approach. I agree and join his

opinion. I add that the majority's holding illustrates the dif-ficulty of finding a workable judicial Commerce Clause touchstone--a set of comprehensible interpretive rules that courtsmight use to impose some meaningful limit, but not too great
a limit, upon the scope of the legislative authority that theCommerce Clause delegates to Congress.

A
Consider the problems. The "economic/noneconomic" dis-tinction is not easy to apply. Does the local street corner

mugger engage in "economic" activity or "noneconomic" ac-tivity when he mugs for money? See

Perez v. United States,402 U. S. 146 (1971) (aggregating local "loan sharking" instances); United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 559 (1995)(loan sharking is economic because it consists of "intrastate
extortionate credit transactions"); ante, at 610. Would evi-dence that desire for economic domination underlies many
brutal crimes against women save the present statute? SeeUnited States General Accounting Office, Health, Education,
and Human Services Division, Domestic Violence: Preva-lence and Implications for Employment Among Welfare Recipients 7-8 (Nov. 1998); Brief for Equal Rights Advocateset al. as

exceptions. The Court itself would permit Congress to ag-gregate, hence regulate, "noneconomic" activity taking place

at economic establishments. See Heart of Atlanta Motel,
Inc. v. United States, 379 U. S. 241 (1964) (upholding civil
rights laws forbidding discrimination at local motels); Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U. S. 294 (1964) (same for restaurants); Lopez, supra, at 559 (recognizing congressional powerto aggregate, hence forbid, noneconomically motivated discrimination at public accommodations); ante, at 610 (same).
And it would permit Congress to regulate where that regu-lation is "an essential part of a larger regulation of economic activity, in which the regulatory scheme could beundercut unless the intrastate activity were regulated."
Lopez, supra, at 561; cf. Controlled Substances Act, 21
U. S. C. $ 801 et seq. (regulating drugs produced for home
consumption). Given the former exception, can Congress
simply rewrite the present law and limit its application to
restaurants, hotels, perhaps universities, and other places of
public accommodation? Given the latter exception, can Congress save the present law by including it, or much of it, in
a broader "Safe Transport" or "Workplace Safety" act?

More important, why should we give critical constitutional
importance to the economic, or noneconomic, nature of an
interstate-commerce-affecting cause? If chemical emanations through indirect environmental change cause identical,
severe commercial harm outside a State, why should it matter whether local factories or home fireplaces release them?
The Constitution itself refers only to Congress' power to
"regulate Commerce . . . among the several States," and to
make laws "necessary and proper" to implement that power.
Art. I, $ 8, cls. 3, 18. The language says nothing about either
the local nature, or the economic nature, of an interstatecommerce-affecting cause.

This Court has long held that only the interstate commercial effects, not the local nature of the cause, are constitutionally relevant. See NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp.,
301 U. S. 1, 38-39 (1937) (focusing upon interstate effects);

commerce that feels the pinch, it does not matter how localthe operation which applies the squeeze' " (quoting

United
States v. Women's Sportswear Mfrs. Assn., 336 U. S. 460, 464(1949))). Nothing in the Constitution's language, or that of

earlier cases prior to Lopez, explains why the Court should
ignore one highly relevant characteristic of an interstate-commerce-affecting cause (how "local" it is), while placing

critical constitutional weight upon a different, less obviouslyrelevant, feature (how "economic" it is).

Most importantly, the Court's complex rules seem unlikely
to help secure the very object that they seek, namely, the
protection of "areas of traditional state regulation" from
federal intrusion. Ante, at 615. The Court's rules, even
if broadly interpreted, are underinclusive. The local pickpocket is no less a traditional subject of state regulation
than is the local gender-motivated assault. Regardless,
the Court reaffirms, as it should, Congress' well-established
and frequently exercised power to enact laws that satisfy
a commerce-related jurisdictional prerequisite--for example,
that some item relevant to the federally regulated activity
has at some time crossed a state line. Ante, at 609, 611-612,

$ 922(g)(1) (prohibiting felons from shipping, transporting, receiving, or possessing firearms "in interstate . . . commerce").And in a world where most everyday products or their

component parts cross interstate boundaries, Congress willfrequently find it possible to redraft a statute using language
that ties the regulation to the interstate movement of some
relevant object, thereby regulating local criminal activity
or, for that matter, family affairs. See, e. g., Child Support
Recovery Act of 1992, 18 U. S. C. $ 228. Although this possibility does not give the Federal Government the power to
regulate everything, it means that any substantive limitation
will apply randomly in terms of the interests the majority
seeks to protect. How much would be gained, for example,
were Congress to reenact the present law in the form of
"An Act Forbidding Violence Against Women Perpetrated
at Public Accommodations or by Those Who Have Moved in,
or through the Use of Items that Have Moved in, Interstate Commerce"? Complex Commerce Clause rules creating fine distinctions that achieve only random results do little
to further the important federalist interests that called them
into being. That is why modern (pre-Lopez) case law rejected them. See Wickard, supra, at 120; United States v.
Darby, 312 U. S. 100, 116-117 (1941); Jones & Laughlin Steel
Corp., supra, at 37.

The majority, aware of these difficulties, is nonetheless
concerned with what it sees as an important contrary consideration. To determine the lawfulness of statutes simply
by asking whether Congress could reasonably have found
that aggregated local instances significantly affect interstate
commerce will allow Congress to regulate almost anything.

Virtually all local activity, when instances are aggregated,can have "substantial effects on employment, production,

transit, or consumption." Hence Congress could "regulateany crime," and perhaps "marriage, divorce, and childrearing" as well, obliterating the "Constitution's distinctionbetween national and local authority."

Ante, at 615, 616;
Lopez, 514 U. S., at 558; cf. A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp.
v. United States, 295 U. S. 495, 548 (1935) (need for distinc-tion between "direct" and "indirect" effects lest there "be

virtually no limit to the federal power"); Hammer v. Dagenhart, 247 U. S. 251, 276 (1918) (similar observation).

This consideration, however, while serious, does not reflect
a jurisprudential defect, so much as it reflects a practical
reality. We live in a Nation knit together by two centuries
of scientific, technological, commercial, and environmental
change. Those changes, taken together, mean that virtually
every kind of activity, no matter how local, genuinely can
affect commerce, or its conditions, outside the State--at least
when considered in the aggregate. Heart of Atlanta Motel,
379 U. S., at 251. And that fact makes it close to impossible
for courts to develop meaningful subject-matter categories
that would exclude some kinds of local activities from ordinary Commerce Clause "aggregation" rules without, at the
same time, depriving Congress of the power to regulate
activities that have a genuine and important effect upon
interstate commerce.

Since judges cannot change the world, the "defect" means
that, within the bounds of the rational, Congress, not the
courts, must remain primarily responsible for striking the
appropriate state/federal balance. Garcia v. San Antonio

Federalism, 100 Colum. L. Rev. 215 (2000) (focusing on roleof political process and political parties in protecting state
interests). Congress is institutionally motivated to do so.Its Members represent state and local district interests.
They consider the views of state and local officials when theylegislate, and they have even developed formal procedures
to ensure that such consideration takes place. See, e. g., Un-funded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, Pub. L. 104-4, 109
Stat. 48 (codified in scattered sections of 2 U. S. C.). More-over, Congress often can better reflect state concerns for
autonomy in the details of sophisticated statutory schemesthan can the Judiciary, which cannot easily gather the relevant facts and which must apply more general legal rulesand categories. See,

e. g., 42 U. S. C. $ 7543(b) (Clean AirAct); 33 U. S. C. $ 1251 et seq. (Clean Water Act); see also

New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144, 167-168 (1992) (col-lecting other examples of "cooperative federalism"). Not
surprisingly, the bulk of American law is still state law, andoverwhelmingly so.

B
I would also note that Congress, when it enacted the stat-ute, followed procedures that help to protect the federalism

values at stake. It provided adequate notice to the Statesof its intent to legislate in an "are[a] of traditional state regulation." Ante, at 615. And in response, attorneys generalin the overwhelming majority of States (38) supported congressional legislation, telling Congress that "[o]ur experienceas Attorneys General strengthens our belief that the problem of violence against women is a national one, requiringfederal attention, federal leadership, and federal funds."

supra, at 77-84 (Conference of Chief Justices opposinglegislation).

Moreover, as Justice Souter has pointed out, Congress
compiled a "mountain of data" explicitly documenting theinterstate commercial effects of gender-motivated crimes of

violence. Ante, at 628-635, 653-654 (dissenting opinion).After considering alternatives, it focused the federal law
upon documented deficiencies in state legal systems. And it
tailored the law to prevent its use in certain areas of traditional state concern, such as divorce, alimony, or child custody. 42 U. S. C. $ 13981(e)(4). Consequently, the law before us seems to represent an instance, not of state/federal
conflict, but of state/federal efforts to cooperate in order

to help solve a mutually acknowledged national problem.
Cf. $$ 300w-10, 3796gg, 3796hh, 10409, 13931 (providing federal moneys to encourage state and local initiatives to combat gender-motivated violence).

I call attention to the legislative process leading up to
enactment of this statute because, as the majority recognizes, ante, at 614, it far surpasses that which led to the
enactment of the statute we considered in Lopez. And even
were I to accept Lopez as an accurate statement of the law,
which I do not, that distinction provides a possible basis for
upholding the law here. This Court on occasion has pointed
to the importance of procedural limitations in keeping the
power of Congress in check. See Garcia, supra, at 554

Clause powers must find its justification in the procedural
nature of this basic limitation, and it must be tailored to compensate for possible failings in the national political process

Commentators also have suggested that the thoroughness
of legislative procedures--e. g., whether Congress took a"hard look"--might sometimes make a determinative difference in a Commerce Clause case, say, when Congress legis-lates in an area of traditional state regulation. See,

e. g.,

congressional prerogatives and embody difficult definitional
problems. But the intrusion, problems, and consequences
all would seem less serious than those embodied in the
majority's approach. See supra, at 656-659.

I continue to agree with Justice Souter that the Court's
traditional "rational basis" approach is sufficient. Ante, at

dissenting
of Congress' own procedural approach--in which case thelaw may evolve toward a rule that, in certain difficult Commerce Clause cases, takes account of the thoroughness withwhich Congress has considered the federalism issue.

For these reasons, as well as those set forth by Justice
Souter, this statute falls well within Congress' CommerceClause authority, and I dissent from the Court's contrary

conclusion. II

Given my conclusion on the Commerce Clause question,I need not consider Congress' authority under $ 5 of the
Fourteenth Amendment. Nonetheless, I doubt the Court'sreasoning rejecting that source of authority. The Court
points out that in United States v. Harris, 106 U. S. 629(1883), and the Civil Rights Cases, 109 U. S. 3 (1883), the
Court held that $ 5 does not authorize Congress to usethe Fourteenth Amendment as a source of power to remedy
the conduct of private persons. Ante, at 621-622. That iscertainly so. The Federal Government's argument, however, is that Congress used $ 5 to remedy the actions of stateactors, namely, those States which, through discriminatory
design or the discriminatory conduct of their officials, failedto provide adequate (or any) state remedies for women
injured by gender-motivated violence--a failure that theStates, and Congress, documented in depth. See

ante, at630-631, n. 7, 653-654 (S
outer, J., dissenting) (collectingsources).

Neither Harris nor the Civil Rights Cases considered thiskind of claim. The Court in

Harris specifically said that ittreated the federal laws in question as "directed exclusively

against the action of private persons, without reference tothe laws of the State or their administration by her officers."
106 U. S., at 640 (emphasis added); see also Civil RightsCases, supra, at 14 (observing that the statute did "not profess to be corrective of any constitutional wrong committedby the States" and that it established "rules for the conduct

dissenting
of individuals in society towards each other, . . . without re-ferring in any manner to any supposed action of the State or

its authorities").The Court responds directly to the relevant "state actor"
claim by finding that the present law lacks " `congruence andproportionality' " to the state discrimination that it purports
to remedy. Ante, at 625-626; see City of Boerne v. Flores,
521 U. S. 507, 526 (1997). That is because the law, unlikefederal laws prohibiting literacy tests for voting, imposing

voting rights requirements, or punishing state officials whointentionally discriminated in jury selection,

Katzenbach v.
Morgan, 384 U. S. 641 (1966); South Carolina v. Katzenbach,
383 U. S. 301 (1966); Ex parte Virginia, 100 U. S. 339 (1880),
is not "directed . . . at any State or state actor." Ante,
at 626.

But why can Congress not provide a remedy against
private actors? Those private actors, of course, did not
themselves violate the Constitution. But this Court has
held that Congress at least sometimes can enact remedial
"[l]egislation . . . [that] prohibits conduct which is not itself
unconstitutional." Flores, supra, at 518; see also Katzenbach v. Morgan, supra, at 651; South Carolina v. Katzenbach, supra, at 308. The statutory remedy does not in any
sense purport to "determine what constitutes a constitutional violation." Flores, supra, at 519. It intrudes little
upon either States or private parties. It may lead state
actors to improve their own remedial systems, primarily
through example. It restricts private actors only by imposing liability for private conduct that is, in the main, already forbidden by state law. Why is the remedy "disproportionate"? And given the relation between remedy and
violation--the creation of a federal remedy to substitute for
constitutionally inadequate state remedies--where is the
lack of "congruence"?

The majority adds that Congress found that the problem
of inadequacy of state remedies "does not exist in all States,

dissenting
or even most States." Ante, at 626. But Congress had be-fore it the task force reports of at least 21 States documenting constitutional violations. And it made its ownfindings about pervasive gender-based stereotypes hampering many state legal systems, sometimes unconstitution-ally so. See, e. g., S. Rep. No. 103-138, pp. 38, 41-42, 44-47
(1993); S. Rep. No. 102-197, pp. 39, 44-49 (1991); H. R. Conf.Rep. No. 103-711, p. 385 (1994). The record nowhere reveals
a congressional finding that the problem "does not exist"elsewhere. Why can Congress not take the evidence before
it as evidence of a national problem? This Court has notpreviously held that Congress must document the existence
of a problem in every State prior to proposing a nationalsolution. And the deference this Court gives to Congress'
chosen remedy under $ 5, Flores, supra, at 536, suggests thatany such requirement would be inappropriate.

Despite my doubts about the majority's $ 5 reasoning,I need not, and do not, answer the $ 5 question, which I
would leave for more thorough analysis if necessary on an-other occasion. Rather, in my view, the Commerce Clause
provides an adequate basis for the statute before us. AndI would uphold its constitutionality as the "necessary and
proper" exercise of legislative power granted to Congress bythat Clause.

667OCTOBER TERM, 1999
Syllabus

FISCHER v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eleventh circuit

No. 99-116. Argued February 22, 2000--Decided May 15, 2000
Petitioner, while president and part owner of Quality Medical Consultants,

Inc. (QMC), negotiated a $1.2 million loan to QMC from West Volusia
Hospital Authority (WVHA), a municipal agency responsible for operating two Florida hospitals, both of which participate in the federal Medicare program. In 1993 WVHA received between $10 and $15 million
in Medicare funds. After a 1994 audit of WVHA raised questions about
the QMC loan, petitioner was indicted for violations of the federal bribery statute, including defrauding an organization which receives benefits
under a federal assistance program, 18 U. S. C. $ 666(a)(1)(A), and paying
a kickback to one of its agents, $ 666(a)(2). A jury convicted him on all
counts, and the District Court sentenced him to imprisonment, imposed
a term of supervised release, and ordered the payment of restitution.
On appeal petitioner argued that the Government failed to prove
WVHA, as the organization affected by his wrongdoing, received "benefits in excess of $10,000 under a Federal program," as required by

$ 666(b). In rejecting that argument and affirming the convictions, the
Eleventh Circuit held that funds received by an organization constitute
"benefits" within $ 666's meaning if the source of the funds is a federal
program, like Medicare, which provides aid or assistance to participating organizations.

Held: Health care providers such as the one defrauded by petitioner

receive "benefits" within the meaning of $ 666(b). Pp. 671-682.

(a) Medicare's nature and purposes provide essential instruction in
resolving this controversy. Medicare is a federally funded medical insurance program for the elderly and disabled. The Federal Government is the single largest source of funds for hospitals participating
in Medicare. Such providers qualify to participate upon satisfying a
comprehensive series of statutory and regulatory requirements, including licensing, quality assurance, staffing, and other standards. Compliance with these standards provides the Government with assurance that
participating providers possess the capacity to fulfill their statutory obligation of providing "medically necessary" services "of a quality which
meets professionally recognized standards of health care." 42 U. S. C.

$ 1320c-5(a). Medicare attains its objectives through an elaborate funding structure designed not only to compensate providers for the reason529US3 Unit: $U55 [09-26-01 13:01:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN
668 FISCHER v. UNITED STATES

Syllabus
able cost of the services actually rendered to patients, but also to enhance health care organizations' capacity to provide ongoing, quality
services to the community at large. In the normal course Medicare
disbursements occur periodically, often in advance of a provider's rendering services, in order to protect providers' liquidity and thereby assist in the ongoing provision of such services. The program, then, establishes correlating and reinforcing incentives: The Government has an
interest in making available a high level of quality of care for the elderly
and disabled; and providers, because of their financial dependence upon
the program, have incentives to achieve program goals. Pp. 671-675.

(b) Medicare provider payments are "benefits," as that term is used
in its ordinary sense and as it is intended in $ 666(b). The Court rejects
petitioner's argument that Medicare provides benefits only to the elderly and disabled, not to participating health care organizations.
While standard definitions of the term "benefit" and provisions of Medicare support petitioner's assertion that qualifying patients rank as the
program's primary beneficiaries, the fact that one beneficiary of an assistance program can be identified does not foreclose the existence of
others. Section 666(b)'s language specifying that benefits can be in the
form of "a grant, contract, subsidy, loan, guarantee, insurance, or other
form of Federal assistance," coupled with $ 666(a)'s broad substantive
prohibitions, reveals Congress' unambiguous intent to ensure the integrity of organizations participating in federal assistance programs. In
removing from the statute's coverage any "bona fide salary, wages, fees,
or other compensation paid, or expenses paid or reimbursed, in the usual
course of business," $ 666(c) does not exclude the payments here at issue
from the meaning of "benefits" within $ 666(b). Medicare payments are
not simply compensation or reimbursement. The payments, in contrast, assist the hospital in making available and maintaining a certain
level and quality of medical care in both its own interests and those of
the greater community. The provider itself is the object of substantial
Government regulation, and adequate payment and assistance to the
provider is itself one of Medicare's objectives. Accordingly, the health
care provider is receiving a benefit in the conventional sense of the term,
unlike the case of a contractor whom the Government does not regulate
or assist for long-term objectives or for purposes beyond performance
of an immediate transaction. Pp. 675-681.

(c) The Court does not suggest that federal funds disbursed under an
assistance program will result in coverage of all recipient fraud under

$ 666(b). Adopting a broad, almost limitless use of the term "benefits"
would upset the proper federal balance. The statutory inquiry should
examine the conditions under which the federal payments are received.
The answer could depend, as it does here, on whether the recipient's

own operations are one of the reasons for maintaining the program.
The Government has a legitimate and significant interest in prohibiting
financial fraud or bribery being perpetrated upon Medicare providers:
Such acts threaten the program's integrity and raise the risk participating organizations will lack the resources needed to provide the requisite
level and quality of care. Pp. 681-682.

Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.
The federal bribery statute prohibits defrauding organiza-tions which "receiv[e], in any one year period, benefits in

excess of $10,000 under a Federal program." 18 U. S. C.$ 666(b). We granted certiorari to determine whether the
statute covers fraud perpetrated on organizations participat-ing in the Medicare program. Upon consideration of the
role and regulated status of hospitals as health care provid-ers under the Medicare program, we hold they receive "benefits" within the meaning of the statute. We affirm petition-er's convictions.

tion which performed billing audits for health care organiza-tions. In 1993 petitioner, on QMC's behalf, negotiated a $1.2

million loan from West Volusia Hospital Authority (WVHA),a municipal agency responsible for operating two hospitals
located in West Volusia County, Florida. Both hospitalsparticipate in the Medicare program, and in 1993 WVHA
received between $10 and $15 million in Medicare funds.

A February 1994 audit of WVHA's financial affairs raisedquestions about the QMC loan. An investigation revealed

QMC used the loan proceeds to repay creditors and to raisethe salaries of its five owner-employees, including petitioner.
It was determined that petitioner had arranged for QMC to
advance at least $100,000 to a private company owned by an
individual who had assisted QMC in securing a letter of
credit in connection with the WVHA loan. QMC, at petitioner's directive, also committed portions of the loan proceeds to speculative securities. These investments yielded
losses of almost $400,000. The investigation further uncovered use of the loan proceeds to pay, through an intermediate
transfer, a $10,000 kickback to WVHA's chief financial officer,
the individual with whom petitioner had negotiated the loan
in the first instance. QMC defaulted on its obligation to
WVHA and filed for bankruptcy.

In 1996 petitioner was indicted by a federal grand jury on
13 counts, including charges of defrauding an organization
which receives benefits under a federal assistance program,
18 U. S. C. $ 666(a)(1)(A), and of paying a kickback to one of
its agents, $ 666(a)(2). A jury convicted petitioner on all
counts charged, and the District Court sentenced him to 65
months' imprisonment and a 3-year term of supervised
release. Petitioner, in addition, was ordered to pay $1.2
million in restitution.

On appeal petitioner argued that the Government failed to
prove WVHA, as the organization affected by his wrongdoing, received "benefits in excess of $10,000 under a Federal

funds is a federal program, like Medicare, which provides aidor assistance to participating organizations. Id., at 1276-

A

The nature and purposes of the Medicare program giveus essential instruction in resolving the present controversy.

Established in 1965 as part of the Social Security Act, 42U. S. C. $ 1395 et seq. (1994 ed. and Supp. III), Medicare is a
federally funded medical insurance program for the elderlyand disabled. In fiscal 1997 some 38.8 million individuals
were enrolled in the program, and over 6,100 hospitals wereauthorized to provide services to them. U. S. Dept. of
Health and Human Services, Health Care Financing Admin-istration, 1998 Data Compendium 45, 75 (Aug. 1998). Medi529US3 Unit: $U55 [09-26-01 13:01:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN

care expenditures for hospital services exceeded $123 billionin 1998, making the Federal Government the single largest

source of funds for participating hospitals. See Cowenet al., National Health Expenditures, 1998, 21 Health Care
Financing Review 165, 208 (Winter 1999) (Table 11). Thisamount constituted 32% of the hospitals' total receipts.
Ibid.

Providers of health care services, such as the two hospitalsoperated by WVHA, qualify to participate in the program

upon satisfying a comprehensive series of statutory andregulatory requirements, including particular accreditation
standards. Hospitals, for instance, must satisfy licensing
standards, 42 CFR $ 482.11 (1999); possess a governing body
to "ensure that there is an effective, hospital-wide quality
assurance program to evaluate the provision of patient care,"

$ 482.21; and employ a "well organized" medical staff accountable on matters relating to "the quality of the medical care
provided to patients," $ 482.22(b). Medicare's implementing
regulations also require hospitals, among many other standards, to maintain and provide 24-hour nursing services,

$ 482.23; complete medical record services, $ 482.24; "pharmaceutical services that meet the needs of the patients,"

$ 482.25; and organized dietary services staffed with qualified
personnel, $ 482.28. The regulations go further, requiring
hospital facilities to "be constructed, arranged, and maintained to ensure the safety of the patient, and to provide
facilities for diagnosis and treatment and for special hospital services appropriate to the needs of the community."

$ 482.41. Compliance with these standards provides the
Government with assurance that participating providers possess the capacity to fulfill their statutory obligation of providing "medically necessary" services "of a quality which
meets professionally recognized standards of health care."
42 U. S. C. $ 1320c-5(a). Peer review organizations monitor
providers' compliance with these and other obligations.

reflect the "reasonable cost" of services rendered, defined
as "the costs necessary in the efficient delivery of neededhealth services to individuals covered [by the program]."

$ 1395x(v)(1)(A). Necessary costs are not limited to the im-mediate costs of an individual treatment procedure. Instead
they are defined in broader terms: "Necessary and proper
costs are costs that are appropriate and helpful in developing
and maintaining the operation of patient care facilities and
activities." 42 CFR $ 413.9(b)(2) (1999). Allowable costs
include amounts which enhance the organization's capacity
to provide ongoing, quality services not only to eligible patients but also to the community at large. By way of example, amounts incurred for "certain educational programs for
interns and residents, known as [graduate medical education]
programs, are `allowable cost[s]' for which a hospital (a provider) may receive reimbursement." Regions Hospital v.
Shalala, 522 U. S. 448, 452 (1998) (citing 42 CFR $ 413.85(a)
(1996)); see also $ 413.85(b) (1999); Thomas Jefferson Univ.
v. Shalala, 512 U. S. 504, 507-508 (1994) (describing regulation of education programs). "These programs," the Medicare regulations explain, "contribute to the quality of patient
care within an institution and are necessary to meet the community's needs for medical and paramedical personnel. . . .
[M]any communities have not assumed responsibility for financing these programs and it is necessary that support be
provided by those purchasing healthcare. Until communities undertake to bear these costs, the program will participate appropriately in the support of these activities." 42
CFR $ 413.85(c) (1999). Medicare also permits, indeed encourages, these providers to deposit the amounts of reim529US3 Unit: $U55 [09-26-01 13:01:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN

$ 413.134(e). Investment income earned on these funds doesnot operate to reduce a provider's interest expense,

$ 413.153(b)(2)(iii), creating incentives to maintain modernmedical equipment and facilities.

The Medicare regulations, furthermore, afford certain provider organizations "special treatment," intended to ensurethe ongoing availability of medical services for qualifying

patients. See 42 CFR pt. 412G (1999). Providers qualify-ing as "Medicare-dependent, small rural hospital[s]," for instance, are entitled to additional, "lump sum" payments to
compensate for significant declines in demand for patient
care. $ 412.108. The additional funds enable a provider to
"maintai[n] [its] necessary core staff and services" and to satisfy its "fixed (and semi-fixed) costs." $$ 412.108(d)(3)(A),
(B). So too does the Medicare program authorize "special
treatment" for, among other providers, "sole community hospitals," "renal transplantation centers," and "hospitals that
serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients." See

$$ 412.92, 412.100, 412.106. The subsidies assist providers in
satisfying those financial obligations necessary to continue as
going concerns in accordance with the program's requirements. See, e. g., $ 412.92(d)(2).

In the normal course Medicare disbursements occur on a
periodic basis, often in advance of a provider's rendering
services, 42 U. S. C. $ 1395g(a); 42 CFR $$ 413.60, 413.64

liquidity," Good Samaritan Hospital v. Shalala, 508 U. S.
402, 406 (1993), thereby assisting in the ongoing provision of
services. 42 CFR $ 413.5(b)(1) (1999) (requiring reimbursement method to "result in current payment so that institutions will not be disadvantaged, as they sometimes are under
other arrangements, by having to put up money for the purchase of goods and services well before they receive reimbursement"); $ 413.5(b)(6) (reimbursement system must oper529US3 Unit: $U55 [09-26-01 13:01:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN

in making available a high level of quality of care for theelderly and disabled; and providers, because of their financial
dependence upon the program, have incentives to achieveprogram goals. The nature of the program bears on the
question of statutory coverage.

B
Section 666 of Title 18 of the United States Code prohibitsacts of theft and fraud against organizations receiving funds

under federal assistance programs. The statute in relevantpart provides as follows:

"(a) Whoever, if the circumstance described in sub-section (b) of this section exists--
"(1) being an agent of an organization, or of a State,local, or Indian tribal government, or any agency
thereof--"(A) embezzles, steals, obtains by fraud, or otherwise
without authority knowingly converts to the use of anyperson other than the rightful owner or intentionally
misapplies, property that--"(i) is valued at $5,000 or more, and

"(ii) is owned by, or is under the care, custody, or con-trol of such organization, government, or agency; or
"(B) corruptly solicits or demands for the benefit ofany person, or accepts or agrees to accept, anything of
value from any person, intending to be influenced orrewarded in connection with any business, transaction,
or series of transactions of such organization, govern-ment, or agency involving anything of value of $5,000 or
more; or"(2) corruptly gives, offers, or agrees to give anything
of value to any person, with intent to influence or re529US3 Unit: $U55 [09-26-01 13:01:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
ward an agent of an organization or of a State, local
or Indian tribal government, or any agency thereof, in
connection with any business, transaction, or series
of transactions of such organization, government, or
agency involving anything of value of $5,000 or more;

"shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than
10 years, or both.

"(b) The circumstance referred to in subsection (a) of
this section is that the organization, government, or
agency receives, in any one year period, benefits in
excess of $10,000 under a Federal program involving
a grant, contract, subsidy, loan, guarantee, insurance,
or other form of Federal assistance.

"(c) This section does not apply to bona fide salary,
wages, fees, or other compensation paid, or expenses
paid or reimbursed, in the usual course of business."

Liability for the acts prohibited by subsection (a) is predicated upon a showing that the defrauded organization "receive[d], in any one period, benefits in excess of $10,000
under a Federal program." $ 666(b). Those benefits can be
in the form of "a grant, contract, subsidy, loan, guarantee,
insurance, or other form of Federal assistance." Ibid. All
agree Medicare is a federal assistance program, see 42 CFR

$ 400.200 (1999), and that WVHA, as the organization defrauded by petitioner's actions, received in excess of $10,000
in payments under the program. The sole point in contention is whether those payments constituted "benefits" within
the meaning of subsection (b).

Petitioner argues that the Medicare program provides
benefits to the elderly and disabled but not to the health care
organizations. Provider organizations, in petitioner's view,
do no more than render services in exchange for compensation. Under petitioner's submission the Medicare program
envisions a single beneficiary, the qualifying patient. The
Government, in opposition, urges that a determination

677Cite as: 529 U. S. 667 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
whether an organization receives "benefits" within themeaning of $ 666(b) turns on whether the Federal Government was the source of the payment. Funds received undera federal assistance program, the Government asserts, can
be traced from federal coffers, often through an intermediaryor carrier, to the health care provider. Under its view, the
"federal-program source of the funds" satisfies the benefits
definition. Brief for United States 11.We reject petitioner's reading of the statute but without

endorsing the Government's broader position. We concludeMedicare payments are "benefits," as the term is used in its
ordinary sense and as it is intended in the statute. The
noun "benefit" means "something that guards, aids, or promotes well-being: advantage, good"; "useful aid"; "payment,
gift [such as] financial help in time of sickness, old age, or
unemployment"; or "a cash payment or service provided
for under an annuity, pension plan, or insurance policy."
Webster's Third New International Dictionary 204 (1971).
These definitions support petitioner's assertion that qualifying patients receive benefits under the Medicare program.
It is commonplace for individuals to refer to their retirement
or health plans as "benefits." So it ought not to be disputed
that the elderly and disabled rank as the primary beneficiaries of the Medicare program. See 42 U. S. C. $$ 1395c, 1395j;
42 CFR $ 400.202 (1999) (defining "beneficiary" as the "person who is entitled to Medicare benefits"); Shalala v. Guernsey Memorial Hospital, 514 U. S. 87, 91 (1995) ("Under the
Medicare reimbursement scheme . . . participating hospitals
furnish services to program beneficiaries and are reimbursed
by the Secretary through fiscal intermediaries"); Good Samaritan Hospital, 508 U. S., at 404 (same).

That one beneficiary of an assistance program can be identified does not foreclose the existence of others, however. In
this respect petitioner's construction would give incomplete
meaning to the term "benefits." Medicare operates with a
purpose and design above and beyond point-of-sale patient

678 FISCHER v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
care, and it follows that the benefits of the program extendin a broader manner as well. The argument limiting the

term "benefits" to the program's targeted or primary bene-ficiaries would exclude, for example, a Medicare intermediary (such as Blue Cross and Blue Shield), a result both par-ties disavow. For present purposes it cannot be disputed
the providers themselves derive significant advantage by
satisfying the participation standards imposed by the Gov-ernment. These advantages constitute benefits within the

meaning of the federal bribery statute, a statute we havedescribed as "expansive," "both as to the [conduct] forbidden
and the entities covered." Salinas v. United States, 522
U. S. 52, 56 (1997).

Subsection (b) identifies several sources as providing benefits under a federal program--"a grant, contract, subsidy,
loan, guarantee, insurance, or other form of Federal assistance." 18 U. S. C. $ 666(b). This language indicates that
Congress viewed many federal assistance programs as providing benefits to participating organizations. Coupled with
the broad substantive prohibitions of subsection (a), the language of subsection (b) reveals Congress' expansive, unambiguous intent to ensure the integrity of organizations participating in federal assistance programs.

Subsection (c) of the statute bears on the analysis. The
provision removes from the statute's coverage any "bona fide
salary, wages, fees, or other compensation paid, or expenses
paid or reimbursed, in the usual course of business."

$ 666(c). Petitioner argues that the subsection operates to
exclude the payments in question because they are either
"compensation" or "expenses paid or reimbursed," or some
combination of the two, and that the payments are made in
the "usual course of business." We disagree.

The subsection provides that the specified sorts of payments are not ones to which the section applies. One inference from this formulation is that the described payments
would have been benefits but for the subsection (c) exemp529US3 Unit: $U55 [09-26-01 13:01:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN

679Cite as: 529 U. S. 667 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
tion. We need not go so far. Even assuming the examplesof subsection (c) bear upon the definition of benefits, statutory examples of nonapplicability do not necessarily give riseto the inference that absent the enumeration the statute
would otherwise apply. To define all subsection (c) pay-ments as exempted benefits would go well beyond the ordinary meaning of the word. On the other hand, the statute
is not written to say: "The term `benefits' does not includebona fide salary, wages, fees, or other compensation paid, or

expenses paid or reimbursed, in the usual course of busi-ness." We must construe the term "benefits," then, in a
manner consistent with Congress' intent not to reach the
enumerated class of transactions. See S. Rep. No. 98-225,
p. 370 (1984) ("[N]ot every Federal contract or disbursement
of funds would be covered [under $ 666]. For example, if a
government agency lawfully purchases more than $10,000 in
equipment from a supplier, it is not the intent of this section
to make a theft of $5,000 or more from the supplier a Federal crime").

We do not accept the view that the Medicare payments
here in question are for the limited purposes of compensating
providers or reimbursing them for ordinary course expenditures. The payments are made for significant and substantial reasons in addition to compensation or reimbursement,
so that neither these terms nor the usual course of business
conditions set forth in subsection (c) are met here. The payments in question have attributes and purposes well beyond
those described in subsection (c). These attributes and purposes are consistent with the definition of "benefit." While
the payments might have similarities to payments an insurer
would remit to a hospital quite without regard to the Medicare program, the Government does not make the payment
unless the hospital complies with its intricate regulatory
scheme. The payments are made not simply to reimburse
for treatment of qualifying patients but to assist the hospital
in making available and maintaining a certain level and qual529US3 Unit: $U55 [09-26-01 13:01:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN
680 FISCHER v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
ity of medical care, all in the interest of both the hospitaland the greater community.

Here, as we have explained, the provider itself is the ob-ject of substantial Government regulation. Medicare is designed to the end that the Government receives not only re-ciprocal value from isolated transactions but also long-term
advantages from the existence of a sound and effective
health care system for the elderly and disabled. The Gov-ernment enacted specific statutes and regulations to secure

its own interests in promoting the well being and advantageof the health care provider, in addition to the patient who
receives care. The health care provider is receiving a benefit in the conventional sense of the term, unlike the case of a
contractor whom the Government does not regulate or assist
for long-term objectives or for significant purposes beyond
performance of an immediate transaction. Adequate payment and assistance to the health care provider is itself one
of the objectives of the program. These purposes and effects suffice to make the payment a benefit within the meaning of the statute.

The structure and operation of the Medicare program
reveal a comprehensive federal assistance enterprise aimed
at ensuring the availability of quality health care for

the broader community. Participating health care organizations, as our above discussion shows, must satisfy a series
of qualification and accreditation requirements, standards
aimed in part at ensuring the provision of a certain quality
of care. See 42 CFR pt. 482 (1999). By reimbursing participating providers for a wide range of costs and expenses,
including medical treatment costs, overhead costs, and education costs, Medicare's reimbursement system furthers this
objective. This scheme is structured to ensure that providers possess the capacity to render, on an ongoing basis, medical care to the program's qualifying patients. The structure, moreover, proves untenable petitioner's assertion that
Congress has no interest in the financial stability of pro529US3 Unit: $U55 [09-26-01 13:01:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN

stability. $ 413.5(b); Good Samaritan Hospital, 508 U. S.,at 406. Incentives are given for long-term improvements,
such as capital costs and education. $$ 413.85, 413.134(e),413.153(b)(2)(iii). Subsidies, defined as "special treatment,"
are awarded to certain providers. Id., pt. 412G. In short,
provider organizations play a vital role and maintain a highlevel of responsibility in carrying out the program's purposes. Medicare funds, in turn, provide benefits extendingbeyond isolated, point-of-sale treatment transactions. The
funds health care organizations receive for participating in
the Medicare program constitute "benefits" within the meaning of 18 U. S. C. $ 666(b).

Our discussion should not be taken to suggest that federal
funds disbursed under an assistance program will result in
coverage of all recipient fraud under $ 666(b). Any receipt
of federal funds can, at some level of generality, be characterized as a benefit. The statute does not employ this broad,
almost limitless use of the term. Doing so would turn almost every act of fraud or bribery into a federal offense,
upsetting the proper federal balance. To determine
whether an organization participating in a federal assistance
program receives "benefits," an examination must be undertaken of the program's structure, operation, and purpose.
The inquiry should examine the conditions under which the
organization receives the federal payments. The answer
could depend, as it does here, on whether the recipient's own
operations are one of the reasons for maintaining the program. Health care organizations participating in the Medicare program satisfy this standard.

The Government has a legitimate and significant interest
in prohibiting financial fraud or acts of bribery being perpetrated upon Medicare providers. Fraudulent acts threaten
the program's integrity. They raise the risk participating
organizations will lack the resources requisite to provide the

level and quality of care envisioned by the program. Cf. Sa-linas, 522 U. S., at 61 (stating that acceptance of bribes by

an official of a jail housing federal prisoners pursuant to anagreement with the Government "was a threat to the integrity and proper operation of the federal program").Other cases may present questions requiring further examination and elaboration of the term "benefits." Here itsuffices to hold that health care providers such as the one
defrauded by petitioner receive benefits within the meaningof the statute. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is
affirmed.

It is so ordered.

Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Scalia joins,dissenting.

In my view, the only persons who receive "benefits" underMedicare are the individual elderly and disabled Medicare
patients, not the medical providers who serve them. Pay-ments made by the Federal Government to a Medicare
health care provider to reimburse the provider for the costsof services rendered, rather than to provide financial aid to
the hospital, are not "benefits." I respectfully dissent.

I
The jurisdictional provision of 18 U. S. C. $ 666(b) requiresthat an "organization, government, or agency receiv[e], in

any one year period, benefits in excess of $10,000 under aFederal program involving a grant, contract, subsidy, loan,
guarantee, insurance, or other form of Federal assistance."As the Court notes, an organization is not a beneficiary of
a federal program merely because the organization receivesfederal funds. Ante, at 677, 681. Rather, as the Court admits, a "benefit" is something that "guards, aids, or promoteswell-being"; "useful aid"; or a "payment, gift [as] financial help in time of sickness, old age, or unemployment."Webster's Third New International Dictionary 204 (1971).

Thomas, J., dissenting
Therefore, the Court acknowledges, an organization "re-ceives . . . benefits" within the meaning of $ 666(b) only if

the federal funds are designed to guard, aid, or promote thewell-being of the organization, to provide useful aid to the
organization, or to give the organization financial help intime of trouble. In my view, payments made by the Federal
Government to a Medicare health care provider as part of amarket transaction are not "benefits."

1

The statutory and regulatory scheme governing Medicarereimbursements leaves no doubt that hospitals do not receive

"benefits" from the Federal Government within this meaningof the term, but merely receive payments for costs pursuant
to a market transaction. Although the Medicare reimburse-ment scheme is quite complex, it suffices to point out a few
critical components.2Under the "reasonable cost" reimbursement provisions relied on by the Court, ante, at 673-675, the Federal Govern-ment reimburses providers for "the cost actually incurred,
excluding therefrom any part of incurred cost found to beunnecessary in the efficient delivery of needed health serv1 Even if I thought that, under a reading of $ 666(b) standing alone, a
market exchange of payment for services might amount to "benefits,"

$ 666(c) would eliminate that doubt. Section 666(c) makes clear that "bona
fide . . . expenses paid or reimbursed, in the usual course of business," are
not covered by the statute. As discussed below, Medicare payments to
health care providers are precisely this type of payment.

2 In 1993, the year relevant to the instant case, Medicare consisted of

two separate programs, Parts A and B. Part A provides insurance for
certain elderly or disabled persons to cover the costs of inpatient hospital
care, nursing facility care, home health services, and hospice care. See
generally 42 U. S. C. $$ 1395c to 1395i-4. Part B is a voluntary program
that provides supplemental benefits to elderly or disabled Medicare participants to cover the costs of, among other things, physician services, laboratory and diagnostic tests, ambulance services, and prescription drugs.
See generally $$ 1395j to 1395w-4. The Government did not present evidence at petitioner's trial regarding which provisions of Medicare accounted for the payments made to the West Volusia Hospital Authority
in 1993.

ices." 42 U. S. C. $ 1395x(v)(1)(A). The Social Security Actthat created Medicare instructed the Secretary of Health and

Human Services to promulgate regulations establishing themethods of determining "reasonable costs" and specifically
directed the Secretary to consider, among other things, reim-bursement methods used by private insurers.

Ibid. See
also Shalala v. Guernsey Memorial Hospital, 514 U. S. 87,
91-92 (1995).Under these regulations, the Federal Government reimburses medical providers based upon the lower of the provid-er's reasonable cost of furnishing these services to beneficiaries or the provider's customary charges for the services.
42 CFR $ 413.1(b) (1999). The regulations are designed
to provide reimbursement for the actual cost of providing
care to elderly and disabled Medicare beneficiaries. See

$ 413.5(a) ("Thus, the application of this approach, with appropriate accounting support, will result in meeting actual
costs of services to beneficiaries"). The regulations make
clear that the Federal Government will reimburse hospitals
only for the costs of providing medical care to Medicare
patients, as opposed to nonbeneficiary patients. $ 413.80(d)
("Under Medicare . . . costs of services provided for other
than beneficiaries are not to be borne by the Medicare program"); $ 413.9(a) ("All payments to providers of services
must be based on the reasonable cost of services covered
under Medicare and related to the care of beneficiaries");

$ 413.9(c)(3) ("The determination of reasonable cost of services must be based on cost related to the care of Medicare
beneficiaries").

Although these reimbursement provisions permit hospitals to recover capital costs, such as the cost of maintaining
building facilities, $ 413.9(c), the allowable reimbursement for
these expenditures is only the amount reasonably attributable to Medicare patients as opposed to general maintenance
of the facilities. See $ 413.9(b) ("The objective is that under
the methods of determining costs, the costs with respect to

529US3 Unit: $U55 [09-26-01 13:01:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Thomas, J., dissenting
individuals covered by the program will not be borne by indi-viduals not so covered, and the costs with respect to individuals not so covered will not be borne by the program").The "prospective payment system" adopted by Congress
in 1983 to increase efficiency and reduce costs operates some-what differently from the "reasonable cost" provisions but
is also designed to reimburse hospitals for the cost of providing care to Medicare beneficiaries. 42 U. S. C. $ 1395ww;42 CFR pt. 412 (1999). Under this system, the Medicare

program pays hospitals a fixed price for each case based onthe patient's diagnosis related grouping (DRG), which is
assigned based on the patient's diagnosis, age, and sex,
among other things. 42 U. S. C. $ 1395ww(e); 24 CFR

$ 412.60 (1999). The DRG figure represents the average
cost of treating patients within the DRG. 42 U. S. C.

$ 1395ww(d)(2); 49 Fed. Reg. 251 (1984). Significantly, because hospitals are paid fixed amounts based on the DRG,
the hospital, like any other private contractor, bears the risk
of higher costs. See Kinney, Making Hard Choices under
the Medicare Prospective Payment System: One Administrative Model for Allocating Medical Resources under a Government Health Insurance Program, 19 Ind. L. Rev. 1151, 1151-
1152 (1986).

Thus, the statute and regulations make clear that medical
providers are entitled only to reimbursement for the actual
or estimated cost of services rendered to Medicare patients
and that individual elderly and disabled patients--not hospitals--are the beneficiaries of the Medicare program. Indeed, the Social Security Act explicitly says so. See 42
U. S. C. $ 1395a(b)(5) (1994 ed., Supp. III) ("The term `medicare beneficiary' means an individual who is entitled to
benefits" (emphasis added)). The Act repeatedly refers
to Medicare "benefits" as assistance provided to individual
participants, rather than to medical providers. See, e. g.,

$ 1395a ("Any individual entitled to insurance benefits under
this subchapter"); $ 1395b-2 ("Such notice shall be mailed an529US3 Unit: $U55 [09-26-01 13:01:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN

nually to individuals entitled to benefits under part A or partB of this subchapter and when an individual applies for benefits under part A of this subchapter or enrolls under part Bof this subchapter"); $ 1395b-4(a) ("health insurance coverage to individuals who are eligible to receive benefits underthis subchapter"); $ 1395b-4(b)(2)(A)(i) ("information that
may assist individuals in obtaining benefits"). In contrast,the Act commonly refers to "payments" to providers of medical services. See, e. g., $ 1395g(a) ("no such payments shallbe made to any provider unless it has furnished such information as the Secretary may request"); $ 1395f(a) ("paymentfor services furnished an individual may be made only to
providers of services"); $ 1395n(a) (1994 ed. and Supp. III)("payment for services . . . furnished an individual may be
made only to providers of services which are eligible").This terminology, and the Medicare regulations defining allowable costs, reflect the fact that Medicare is a program forproviding "financial help" to individual elderly and disabled
patients rather than to the health care providers who treatthem. Medicare's provisions for reimbursing providers'
costs do nothing more than establish a market exchange ofpayment for services, and so cannot be said to provide "benefits" within the meaning of 18 U. S. C. $ 666(b).

II
Although the statutory provisions and regulations citedabove demonstrate that Medicare operates as a reimbursement scheme with respect to health care providers, and notas a means of providing them "useful aid" or "financial help,"
the Court finds in the statute and regulations evidence thathealth care providers are, along with the individual elderly
and disabled patients, also target beneficiaries of the pro-gram. I think that the Court's reasoning is both unpersuasive and boundless; any funds flowing from a federal assist-ance program could be deemed "benefits" under the Court's
rationale, notwithstanding the Court's concluding disclaimer

Thomas, J., dissenting
of such a result. Thus, although the Court purports toreject the Government's argument that "benefits" means

"funds that originate in a federal assistance program," theCourt, in practice, adopts it.

A
First, the Court describes Medicare's elaborate fundingstructure and notes that Medicare's reasonable cost recovery

system allows recovery of certain capital costs and the costsof education and training. Ante, at 673-674. These provisions of Medicare do not establish that hospitals receive"benefits." To the contrary, the capital costs recoverable
under those provisions of Medicare are the costs tied to thetreatment of Medicare patients. See

supra, at 684-685. Inthis sense, the cost provisions of Medicare expressly defeat

any suggestion that they are meant to provide a "benefit" tothe hospital. These provisions are not designed to provide
financial assistance to the hospital; they are designed to en-sure that Medicare beneficiaries receive quality medical care.
And again, the Medicare program picks up only the portionof the costs attributable to the care of Medicare beneficiaries.
42 CFR $$ 413.50, 413.85 (1999). In fact, the Court does notgrapple with the evidence that Medicare systematically
under-compensates health care providers, evidence thatwould further undermine the notion that hospitals are receiving some form of financial assistance from the program.See Utz, Federalism in Health Care: Costs and Benefits, 28
Conn. L. Rev. 127, 138-139 (1995).Second, the Court relies on the numerous obligations imposed on health care providers participating in Medicare.
Ante, at 672-675. The Court notes that health care provid-ers must satisfy licensing standards, provide a laundry list

of particular health care services, and ensure an effectivequality-assurance program. I assume, however, that the
same could be said of most Government contractors. Thedefense contractor who agrees to build the military's equip529US3 Unit: $U55 [09-26-01 13:01:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN
688 FISCHER v. UNITED STATES

Thomas, J., dissenting
ment is, no doubt, subject to an extensive list of statutoryand regulatory requirements, not because the Government

intends to provide "benefits" to the contractor, but becausethe Federal Government intends to place controls on the expenditure of federal dollars. See United States v. Copeland,143 F. 3d 1439, 1442 (CA11 1998) (discussing regulatory burdens on defense contractors). Similarly, private insurers no
doubt impose various requirements on those who receive re-imbursements from them. In requiring hospitals to meet

certain standards, the Federal Government is no differentfrom these private insurers, except that the Federal Government exercises vastly greater market power. In other
words, the imposition on health care providers of an intricate
regulatory scheme is irrelevant to the question whether
funds paid pursuant to that scheme are benefits.

Third, the Court contends that some health care providers
receive "special treatment" in the form of lump sum payments designed to ensure the providers' ability to satisfy
financial obligations. Ante, at 674. This feature of Medicare is also insufficient to show that any "benefits" were received by West Volusia Hospital Authority. These payments,
which are part of the prospective payment system, see
supra, at 685, are based on estimated costs of providing services to Medicare beneficiaries. See, e. g., 42 CFR $ 412.108
(1999). Like the standard reimbursement schemes outlined
above, this payment system does not subsidize the hospital,
it pays the hospital prospectively for performing a service.

Finally, the Court concludes, based on its observations of
Medicare, that "Medicare operates with a purpose and design
above and beyond point-of-sale patient care," namely, "ensuring the availability of quality health care for the broader
community." Ante, at 677, 680. According to the Court,
Medicare guarantees that "providers possess the capacity to
render, on an ongoing basis, medical care to the program's
qualifying patients." Ante, at 680. In other words, Medicare exists to guarantee patients' access to quality medical

Thomas, J., dissenting
care. Quality medical care is available only if medical pro-viders remain financially viable. Medicare payments create

demand for medical services and, therefore, provide "bene-fits" to health care providers. This syllogism, however,
amounts to nothing more than the self-evident point thatMedicare aims to ensure that the beneficiaries of the program--patients--are able to receive the program's intendedbenefits. It does not establish that Medicare exists to put
hospitals on the dole.In short, none of the components of Medicare cited by
the Court establishes that benefits flow to hospitals. Itis significant that, although the Court repeatedly invokes,
mantra-like, its conclusion that Medicare exists for a purposeabove and beyond reimbursing hospitals for treating Medicare patients, see, e. g., ante, at 677-678, 679, 680, 681, whenthe Court comes around to actually identifying this purpose,
it can only state: "The structure and operation of the Medi-care program reveal a comprehensive federal assistance enterprise aimed at ensuring the availability of quality healthcare for the broader community." Ante, at 680. The Court
cannot bring itself to say, as it must, that Medicare exists forthe hospital.

3

3 And even if I were to accept that some provisions of Medicare--the
special treatment provisions, for example--provide a benefit to health care
providers, there is no evidence in the record that West Volusia Hospital
Authority received any such payments. Without such evidence, the
Court's reliance on special provisions to uphold petitioner's conviction is
improper. Title 18 U. S. C. $ 666(b) is, after all, a jurisdictional provision
that allows federal prosecution only if the specific organization at issue
received more than $10,000 in "benefits." The Court treats the provision
as window dressing. It is not necessary, under the Court's view, to show
that this organization received benefits. It is sufficient to show that some
hospitals receive them.

This approach is particularly inappropriate because $ 666(b), or some
similar jurisdictional provision, is constitutionally required. Section 666
was adopted pursuant to Congress' spending power, Art. I, $ 8, cl. 1. We
have held that the spending power requires, at least, that the exercise of
federal power be related "to the federal interest in particular national

B
Although the Court disclaims the Government's argumentthat "benefits" means only funds provided under a federal

assistance program, the Court, in practice, adopts it. TheCourt's expansive rationale could be applied to any federal
assistance program that provides funds to any organization.This result is inconsistent with the plain meaning of the statute. If Congress had meant to apply $ 666 to any organiza-tion that receives "funds" totaling more than $10,000 per
annum, it would have said so. Cf. 18 U. S. C. $ 665 ("Who-ever, being . . . connected in any capacity with any agency
or organization receiving financial assistance or any fundsunder [a certain federal program] knowingly enrolls an ineligible participant, embezzles, willfully misapplies, steals, orobtains by fraud any of the moneys, funds, assets, or property which are the subject of a financial assistance agree-ment or contract pursuant to such Act shall be [punished]").
Congress, for that matter, could have omitted the word "ben-efits" from the statute and provided simply that any organization that "receives, in any one year period, in excess of$10,000 under a Federal program involving a . . . form of
federal assistance" is covered by the statute. That Con-gress did not do so suggests that the word "benefits" has a

projects or programs." South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U. S. 203, 207 (1987)
(internal quotation marks omitted). See id., at 213 (O'Connor, J., dissenting). Arguably, if Congress attempted to criminalize acts of theft or
bribery based solely on the fact that--in circumstances unrelated to the
theft or bribery--the victim organization received federal funds as payment for a market transaction, this constitutional requirement would not
be satisfied. Without a jurisdictional provision that would ensure that in
each case the exercise of federal power is related to the federal interest
in a federal program, $ 666 would criminalize routine acts of fraud or bribery, which, as the Court admits, would "upse[t] the proper federal balance." Ante, at 681. Cf. United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 561 (1995)
("[Section] 922(q) contains no jurisdictional element which would ensure,
through case-by-case inquiry, that the firearm possession in question affects interstate commerce").

Thomas, J., dissenting
meaning separate and apart from the words "under a Federalprogram involving a . . . form of federal assistance." I am

doubtful that the Court's interpretation gives any meaningat all to the word "benefits" in $ 666(b) because, under the
Court's rationale, any organization that receives $10,000under a federal program involving federal assistance receives "benefits" in such an amount.This expansive construction of $ 666(b) is, at the very least,
inconsistent with the rule of lenity--which the Court doesnot discuss. This principle requires that, to the extent that
there is any ambiguity in the term "benefits," we should re-solve that ambiguity in favor of the defendant. See

UnitedStates v. Bass, 404 U. S. 336, 347 (1971) ("In various ways

over the years, we have stated that when choice has to bemade between two readings of what conduct Congress has
made a crime, it is appropriate, before we choose the harsheralternative, to require that Congress should have spoken in
language that is clear and definite" (internal quotationmarks omitted)).

C
I doubt that there is any federal assistance program thatdoes not provide "benefits" to organizations under the

Court's expansive rationale, but will illustrate my point withjust one example employed by two lower courts. See
United States v. Wyncoop, 11 F. 3d 119, 123 (CA9 1993);United States v. LaHue, 998 F. Supp. 1182, 1187 (Kan. 1998),
aff 'd, 170 F. 3d 1026 (CA10 1999). Many grocery stores ac-cept more than $10,000 per annum in food stamps distributed
to individual beneficiaries as part of the Federal Food Stampand Food Distribution Program. Like Medicare providers,
stores participating in the Food Stamp Program are requiredto satisfy a comprehensive series of statutory and regulatory
requirements. See 7 CFR pt. 278 (1999). For example,stores are qualified to participate only if they sell an adequate percentage of staple foods such as meat, cereal, anddairy products. $ 278.1(b)(1). Stores must document an

ability to attract food stamp business and demonstrate thebusiness integrity and reputation of the store owners

and managers. $$ 278.1(b)(2)-(3). Like Medicare, the FoodStamp Program monitors the providers' compliance with the
program's requirements. See $ 278.1(n). Like Medicare,the Food Stamp Program sanctions noncompliance with dismissal from the program. $ 278.1(l). And, the Food Stamp
Program is like Medicare in that it can be described as hav-ing "a purpose and design above and beyond point-of-sale" of

food. Ante, at 677. Undoubtedly, the Food Stamp Programhelps to address the "grocery gap," that is, the lack of availability of reasonably priced nutritional foods in some lowincome and rural areas. See Note, Food Stamp Trafficking:
Why Small Groceries Need Judicial Protection from the Department of Agriculture (And from Their Own Employees),
96 Mich. L. Rev. 2156, 2176-2177 (1998); Department of Agriculture, Office of Analysis & Evaluation, Food Retailers in
the Food Stamp Program: Characteristics and Service to
Program Participants 15 (Feb. 1997) (Table 6). There is
ample evidence on the face of the statute and regulations
that Congress and the agency had in mind the need to ensure
that low-income communities have access to grocery stores.
See 7 U. S. C. $ 2021(a) (1994 ed., Supp. IV) (requiring the
Secretary to consider hardship to the community in making
disqualification determinations); 7 CFR $ 278.1(b)(1)(ii)(C)
(1999) (listing availability of food stores in the community as
a factor relevant to a firm's application to participate in the
program). It could be said, therefore, that the grocery
store's "own operations are one of the reasons for maintaining the program." Ante, at 681.

To my mind, the reason that a corner grocery does not
receive "benefits" is simply that it merely receives payment
from the Government in a market transaction. I fail to see,
however, how the Court could reach the same conclusion that
I would. Although the Court assures us that its holding
today is narrow and factbound, depending on the "structure,

operation, and purpose" of Medicare, ibid., the consequencesof the Court's reasoning are far reaching. In fact, the Court

candidly acknowledges that its interpretation is expansivewhen it reads 18 U. S. C. $ 666(b) to suggest that "Congress
viewed many federal assistance programs as providing bene-fits to participating organizations." Ante, at 678 (emphasis
added). In contrast, I think that the plain language of$ 666(b) reflects a congressional intent to reach only those
organizations that are themselves the beneficiaries of "usefulaid" or "financial help in time of sickness, old age, or unemployment," rather than organizations that merely receivefunds as part of a market transaction for goods or services.

For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.

JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe sixth circuit

No. 99-5153. Argued February 22, 2000--Decided May 15, 2000
The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 replaced most forms of parole with

supervised release overseen by the sentencing court. If release conditions are violated, that court may "revoke [the] release, and require
the person to serve in prison all or part of the [supervised release]
term . . . without credit for time previously served on postrelease
supervision . . . ." 18 U. S. C. $ 3583(e)(3). In March 1994, the District
Court sentenced petitioner Johnson to imprisonment followed by a term
of supervised release. After beginning supervised release in 1995,
Johnson violated two conditions of his release. The District Court revoked his release and ordered him to serve an 18-month prison term to
be followed by an additional 12 months of supervised release. The
court cited no authority for ordering additional supervised release, but,
under Circuit law, it might have relied on 18 U. S. C. $ 3583(h), a subsection added to the statute in 1994, which explicitly gave district courts
that power. Johnson appealed, arguing that $ 3583(e)(3) did not give
the district courts power to order a new supervised release term following reimprisonment, and that applying $ 3583(h) to him violated the Ex
Post Facto Clause. Although the Sixth Circuit had previously taken
the same position as Johnson with regard to $ 3583(e)(3), it affirmed his
sentence, reasoning that $ 3583(h)'s application was not retroactive
because revocation of supervised release was punishment for Johnson's violation of his release conditions, which occurred after the 1994
amendments.

Held:

1. Section 3583(h) does not apply retroactively, so no ex post facto
issue arises in this case. To prevail on his ex post facto claim, Johnson
must show, inter alia, that the law operates retroactively. Contrary to
the Sixth Circuit's reasoning, postrevocation penalties are attributable
to the original conviction, not to defendants' new offenses for violating
their supervised release conditions. Thus, to sentence Johnson under

$ 3583(h) would be to apply that section retroactively. However, absent
a clear statement of congressional intent, $ 3583(h) applies only to cases
in which the initial offense occurred after the amendment's effective
date, September 13, 1994. The Government offers nothing indicating a
contrary intent. The decision to alter $ 3583(e)(3)'s supervised release

rule does not reveal when or how that legislative decision was intended
to take effect; and the omission of an express effective date simply indicates that, absent clear congressional direction, it takes effect on its
enactment date, Gozlon-Peretz v. United States, 498 U. S. 395, 404. Nor
did Congress expressly identify the relevant conduct in a way that
would point to retroactive intent. Thus, this case turns not on an ex
post facto question, but on whether $ 3583(e)(3) permitted imposition of
supervised release following a recommitment. Pp. 699-703.

2. Section 3583(e)(3), at the time of Johnson's conviction, gave the District Court the authority to reimpose supervised release. Subsection
(e)(3) does not speak directly to this question. And if the Court were
to concentrate exclusively on the verb "revoke," it would not detect any
suggestion that reincarceration might be followed by another supervised
release term, for the conventional understanding of "revoke" is to annul
by recalling or taking back. However, there are textual reasons to
think that the option of further supervised release was intended. Subsection (e)(1) unequivocally "terminate[s]" a supervised release term
without the possibility of its reimposition or continuation at a later time.
Had Congress likewise meant subsection (3) to conclude any possibility
of supervised release later, it would have been natural for Congress to
write in like terms. That it chose "revoke" rather than "terminate"
left the door open to a reading of subsection (3) that would not preclude
further supervised release. The pre-1994 version of subsection (3) provided that a court could revoke a term of supervised release and require
the person to serve in prison all or part of the "term of supervised
release." This indicates that a revoked supervised release term continues to have some effect. If it could be served in prison, then the balance of it should remain effective when the reincarceration is over.
This interpretation means that Congress used "revoke" in an unconventional way. However, the unconventional sense is not unheard of, for
"revoke" can also mean to call or summon back without the implication
of annulment. There is nothing surprising about the consequences of
this reading. It also serves the congressional policy of providing for
supervised release after incarceration in order to improve the odds of a
successful transition from prison to liberty, and no prisoner would seem
to need it more than one who has tried liberty and failed. This reading
is also supported by pre-Sentencing-Guidelines parole practice. Congress repeatedly used "revoke" in providing for the consequences of
parole violations, and there seems never to have been a question that a
new parole term could follow a prison sentence imposed after revocation
of an initial parole term. Since parole revocation followed by reincarceration was not a mere termination of a limited liberty that a defendant
could experience only once per conviction, it is fair to suppose that,

absent some textual bar, revocation of parole's replacement, supervised
release, was meant to leave open the possibility of further supervised
release, as well. "Revoke" is no such bar, and the Court finds no
other. Pp. 703-713.

Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.
The issue in this case grows out of an Ex Post FactoClause challenge to the retroactive application of 18 U. S. C.

$ 3583(h), which authorizes a district court to impose an addi-tional term of supervised release following the reimprisonment of those who violate the conditions of an initial term.The United States argues that district courts had the power
to do so under the prior law, and that this cures any ex post
facto problems. We agree with the Government as to theinterpretation of prior law, and we find that consideration of

the Ex Post Facto Clause is unnecessary.

supervised release, a form of postconfinement monitoring
overseen by the sentencing court, rather than the Parole
Commission. See Gozlon-Peretz v. United States, 498 U. S.
395, 400-401 (1991). The sentencing court was authorized
to impose a term of supervised release to follow imprisonment, with the maximum length of the term varying according to the severity of the initial offense. See 18 U. S. C.

$$ 3583(a), (b). While on supervised release, the offender
was required to abide by certain conditions, some specified by statute and some imposable at the court's discretion.
See $ 3583(d). Upon violation of a condition, 18 U. S. C.

$ 3583(e)(3) (1988 ed., Supp. V) authorized the court to "revoke a term of supervised release, and require the person to
serve in prison all or part of the term of supervised release
without credit for time previously served on post-release
supervision . . . ." 1 Such was done here.

In October 1993, petitioner Cornell Johnson violated 18
U. S. C. $ 1029(b)(2), a Class D felony. In March 1994, the
United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee sentenced him to 25 months' imprisonment, to be followed by three years of supervised release, the maximum
term available under $ 3583(b) for a Class D felony. Johnson
was released from prison on August 14, 1995, having received good-conduct credits, and began serving his 3-year
term of supervised release. Some seven months into that
term, he was arrested in Virginia and later convicted of four
state forgery-related offenses. He was thus found to have
violated one of the conditions of supervised release made
mandatory by $ 3583(d), that he not commit another crime
during his term of supervised release, and one imposed by
the District Court, that he not leave the judicial district
without permission.

1 The current version of $ 3583(e)(3) reads slightly differently, but
for reasons discussed below, we focus on the law in effect at the time of
Johnson's initial crime.

698 JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
The District Court revoked Johnson's supervised release,imposed a prison term of 18 months, and ordered Johnson

placed on supervised release for 12 months following im-prisonment. App. 40-41. For this last order, the District
Court did not identify the source of its authority, thoughunder Circuit law it might have relied on $ 3583(h), a subsection added to the statute in 1994, see Violent Crime Controland Law Enforcement Act of 1994, $ 110505(2)(B), 108 Stat.
2017. Subsection (h) explicitly gave district courts thepower to impose another term of supervised release following imprisonment, a power not readily apparent from thetext of $ 3583(e)(3) (set out

infra, at 704).Johnson appealed his sentence, arguing that $ 3583(e)(3)

gave district courts no such power and that applying$ 3583(h) to him violated the Ex Post Facto Clause of the
Constitution, Art. I, $ 9. The Sixth Circuit, joining the ma-jority of the Federal Courts of Appeals, had earlier taken
Johnson's position as far as the interpretation of $ 3583(e)(3)was concerned, holding that it did not authorize a district
court to impose a new term of supervised release followingrevocation and reimprisonment. See

United States v.Truss, 4 F. 3d 437 (CA6 1993).
2 It nonetheless affirmed the

District Court, judgt. order reported at 181 F. 3d 105 (1999),reasoning that the application of $ 3583(h) was not retroactive at all, since revocation of supervised release was punish-ment for Johnson's violation of the conditions of supervised

2 Of the 11 Circuits to consider the issue, 9 had reached this conclusion.
See, e. g., United States v. Koehler, 973 F. 2d 132 (CA2 1992); United States
v. Malesic, 18 F. 3d 205 (CA3 1994); United States v. Cooper, 962 F. 2d 339
(CA4 1992); United States v. Holmes, 954 F. 2d 270 (CA5 1992); United

that $ 3583(e)(3) did grant district courts such power. See United States

release, which occurred after the 1994 amendments. Withno retroactivity, there could be no Ex Post Facto Clause violation. See App. 49 (citing United States v. Abbington, 144F. 3d 1003, 1005 (CA6), cert. denied, 525 U. S. 933 (1998)).
Other Circuits had held to the contrary, that revocation andreimprisonment were punishment for the original offense.
From that perspective, application of $ 3583(h) was retro-active and at odds with the

Ex Post Facto Clause.3 Wegranted certiorari to resolve the conflicts, 528 U. S. 950

(1999), and now affirm. II

The heart of the Ex Post Facto Clause, U. S. Const., Art. I,$ 9, bars application of a law "that changes the punishment,
and inflicts a greater punishment, than the law annexed tothe crime, when committed . . . ." Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall.
386, 390 (1798) (emphasis deleted). To prevail on this sortof ex post facto claim, Johnson must show both that the law
he challenges operates retroactively (that it applies to con-duct completed before its enactment) and that it raises the
penalty from whatever the law provided when he acted.See California Dept. of Corrections v. Morales, 514 U. S.
499, 506-507, n. 3 (1995). A

The Sixth Circuit, as mentioned earlier, disposed of theex post facto challenge by applying its earlier cases holding
the application of $ 3583(h) not retroactive at all: revocation

3 See, e. g., United States v. Eske, 189 F. 3d 536, 539 (CA7 1999); United
States v. Lominac, 144 F. 3d 308, 312 (CA4 1998); United States v. Dozier,
119 F. 3d 239, 241 (CA3 1997); United States v. Collins, 118 F. 3d 1394,
1397 (CA9 1997); United States v. Meeks, 25 F. 3d 1117, 1124 (CA2 1994)
(addressing $ 3583(g)). In contrast to these cases, the First and Eighth
Circuits, relying on their broader construction of $ 3583(e)(3), concluded
that application of $ 3583(h) did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause. See
United States v. Sandoval, 69 F. 3d 531 (CA1 1995) (unpublished), cert.
denied, 519 U. S. 821 (1996); United States v. St. John, 92 F. 3d 761 (CA8

Opinion of the Court
of supervised release "imposes punishment for defendants'
new offenses for violating the conditions of their supervised
release." United States v. Page, 131 F. 3d 1173, 1176 (1997).
On this theory, that is, if the violation of the conditions of
supervised release occurred after the enactment of $ 3583(h),
as Johnson's did, the new law could be given effect without
applying it to events before its enactment.

While this understanding of revocation of supervised release has some intuitive appeal, the Government disavows it,
and wisely so in view of the serious constitutional questions
that would be raised by construing revocation and reimprisonment as punishment for the violation of the conditions of
supervised release. Although such violations often lead to
reimprisonment, the violative conduct need not be criminal
and need only be found by a judge under a preponderance of
the evidence standard, not by a jury beyond a reasonable
doubt. See 18 U. S. C. $ 3583(e)(3) (1988 ed., Supp. V).
Where the acts of violation are criminal in their own right,
they may be the basis for separate prosecution, which would
raise an issue of double jeopardy if the revocation of supervised release were also punishment for the same offense.
Treating postrevocation sanctions as part of the penalty for
the initial offense, however (as most courts have done),
avoids these difficulties. See, e. g., United States v. Wyatt,
102 F. 3d 241, 244-245 (CA7 1996) (rejecting double jeopardy
challenge on ground that sanctions for violating the conditions of supervised release are part of the original sentence);
United States v. Beals, 87 F. 3d 854, 859-860 (CA7 1996) (noting that punishment for noncriminal violations must be justified by reference to original crimes), overruled on other
grounds, United States v. Withers, 128 F. 3d 1167 (1997);
United States v. Meeks, 25 F. 3d 1117, 1123 (CA2 1994) (noting absence of constitutional procedural protections in revocation proceedings). Cf. Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U. S. 778,
782 (1973) ("Probation revocation . . . is not a stage of a crimi529US3 Unit: $U56 [09-28-01 09:22:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
nal prosecution"). For that matter, such treatment is all butentailed by our summary affirmance of Greenfield v. Scafati,

277 F. Supp. 644 (Mass. 1967) (three-judge court), summarilyaff 'd, 390 U. S. 713 (1968), in which a three-judge panel forbade on ex post facto grounds the application of a Massachu-setts statute imposing sanctions for violation of parole to
a prisoner originally sentenced before its enactment. Wetherefore attribute postrevocation penalties to the original
conviction. B

Since postrevocation penalties relate to the original of-fense, to sentence Johnson to a further term of supervised
release under $ 3583(h) would be to apply this section retro-actively (and to raise the remaining

ex post facto question,whether that application makes him worse off). But before

any such application (and constitutional test), there is a ques-tion that neither party addresses. The Ex Post Facto
Clause raises to the constitutional level one of the most basicpresumptions of our law: legislation, especially of the criminal sort, is not to be applied retroactively. See, e. g., Lyncev. Mathis, 519 U. S. 433, 439 (1997); Landgraf v. USI Film
Products, 511 U. S. 244, 265 (1994). Quite independent ofthe question whether the Ex Post Facto Clause bars retroactive application of $ 3583(h), then, there is the questionwhether Congress intended such application. Absent a
clear statement of that intent, we do not give retroactive
effect to statutes burdening private interests. See id., at270.

The Government offers nothing indicating congressionalintent to apply $ 3583(h) retroactively. The legislative decision to alter the rule of law established by the majorityinterpretation of $ 3583(e)(3) (no authority for supervised
release after revocation and reimprisonment) does not, byitself, tell us when or how that legislative decision was
intended to take effect. See Rivers v. Roadway Express,

702 JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
Inc., 511 U. S. 298, 304-307 (1994). Neither is there any in-dication of retroactive purpose in the omission of an express

effective date from the statute. The omission simply remitsus to the general rule that when a statute has no effective
date, "absent a clear direction by Congress to the contrary,[it] takes effect on the date of its enactment."

GozlonPeretz, 498 U. S., at 404.4

Nor, finally, has Congress given us anything expresslyidentifying the relevant conduct in a way that would point

to retroactive intent. It may well be that Congress, like theSixth Circuit, believed that $ 3583(h) would naturally govern
sentencing proceedings for violations of supervised releasethat took place after the statute's enactment, simply because
the violation was the occasion for imposing the sanctions.5But Congress gave us no clear indication to this effect, and
we have already rejected that theory; the relevant conductis the initial offense. In sum, there being no contrary intent,
our longstanding presumption directs that $ 3583(h) appliesonly to cases in which that initial offense occurred after the
effective date of the amendment, September 13, 1994.

Given this conclusion, the case does not turn on whetherJohnson is worse off under $ 3583(h) than he previously was

under $ 3583(e)(3), as subsection (h) does not apply, and the
ex post facto question does not arise. The case turns, in4 Indeed, the Sentencing Guidelines identify the effective date of

$ 3583(h) as September 13, 1994. United States Sentencing Commission,
Guidelines Manual $ 7B1.3, comment., n. 2 (Nov. 1998) (USSG). So, too,
have the federal courts. See, e. g., United States v. Hale, 107 F. 3d 526,
529, n. 3 (CA7 1997).

5 The failure to specify an effective date evidences at least arguable

diffidence on this point. Another section of the same Act that added

$ 3583(h) amended 18 U. S. C. $ 3553 to limit the applicability of some statutory minimum sentences. See $ 80001, 108 Stat. 1985. That amendment,
the section made explicit, "shall apply to all sentences imposed on or after
the 10th day beginning after the date of enactment of this Act."

relating to the modification of probation, if it is satisfiedthat such action is warranted by the conduct of the person released and the interest of justice;"(2) extend a term of supervised release if less than

provisions applicable to the initial setting of the termsand conditions of post-release supervision;

U. S. 10 (1993). The respondents in that case were private developers
who had entered into contracts with the Department of Housing and
Urban Development. When the Department sought to recalibrate payments it owed under the contracts, the developers sued, and the Ninth
Circuit ruled that the Department's proposed method of calculating payments was prohibited by the contracts. Congress subsequently passed
legislation explicitly authorizing that method of calculation. The developers resisted application of that legislation to their contracts on the grounds
that it retroactively deprived them of vested contractual rights, in violation of the Due Process Clause. We ruled (disagreeing with the Ninth
Circuit's earlier holding) that the Department's methodology was acceptable under the contracts as signed. Finding the governmental action permitted by the old law, we declined to consider the constitutional consequences of a legislative attempt to change the applicable law.

Opinion of the Court
"(3) revoke a term of supervised release, and requirethe person to serve in prison all or part of the term of

supervised release without credit for the time pre-viously served on postrelease supervision, if it finds by
a preponderance of the evidence that the person violateda condition of supervised release, pursuant to the provisions of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure thatare applicable to probation revocation and to the provisions of applicable policy statements issued by the Sen-tencing Commission . . . ."

The text of subsection (e)(3) does not speak directly to thequestion whether a district court revoking a term of supervised release in favor of reimprisonment may require serviceof a further term of supervised release following the further
incarceration. And if we were to concentrate exclusively onthe verb "revoke," we would not detect any suggestion that
the reincarceration might be followed by another term ofsupervised release, the conventional understanding of "revoke" being simply "to annul by recalling or taking back."Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1944 (1981).
There are reasons, nonetheless, to think that the option offurther supervised release was intended.

First, there are some textual reasons, starting with thepreceding subsection (e)(1). This is an unequivocal provision for ending the term of supervised release without thepossibility of its reimposition or continuation at a later time.
Congress wrote that when a court finds that a defendant'sconduct and the interests of justice warrant it, the court may
"terminate a term of supervised release and discharge theperson released," once at least a year of release time has
been served. If application of subsection (3) had likewisebeen meant to conclude any possibility of supervised release
later, it would have been natural for Congress to write inlike terms. It could have provided that upon finding a defendant in violation of the release conditions the court could"terminate a term of supervised release" and order the de529US3 Unit: $U56 [09-28-01 09:22:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN

705Cite as: 529 U. S. 694 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
fendant incarcerated for a term as long as the original super-vised release term. But that is not what Congress did. Instead of using "terminate" with the sense of finality justillustrated in subsection (1), Congress used the verb "revoke" and so at the least left the door open to a reading ofsubsection (3) that would not preclude further supervised
release after the initial revocation.7 In fact, the phrasing of
subsection (3) did more than just leave the door open to thenonpreclusive reading.

As it was written before the 1994 amendments, subsection(3) did not provide (as it now does) that the court could revoke the release term and require service of a prison termequal to the maximum authorized length of a term of supervised release. It provided, rather, that the court could "re-voke a term of supervised release, and require the person
to serve in prison all or part of the term of supervisedrelease . . . ." So far as the text is concerned, it is not a
"term of imprisonment" that is to be served, but all or part
of "the term of supervised release." But if "the term of
supervised release" is being served, in whole or part, in
prison, then something about the term of supervised release
survives the preceding order of revocation. While this
sounds very metaphysical, the metaphysics make one thing
clear: unlike a "terminated" order of supervised release, one

7 The dissent offers an erudite explanation of the different senses of the
two words, intending to demonstrate that Congress displayed "an admirably precise use of language," by using "revoke" to mean "annul" and "terminate" to indicate that "[t]he supervised release is treated as fulfilled,
and the sentence is complete." Post, at 717 (opinion of Scalia, J.). That
is virtuoso lexicography, but it shows only that English is rich enough to
give even textualists room for creative readings. This one encounters
serious difficulties; the very same section of the statute (as in effect at the
time of Johnson's offense) provides that if the person released is found in
possession of a controlled substance, "the court shall terminate the term
of supervised release and require the defendant to serve in prison not less
than one-third of the term of supervised release." 18 U. S. C. $ 3583(g)

that is "revoked" continues to have some effect. And sinceit continues in some sense after revocation even when part

of it is served in prison, why can the balance of it not remaineffective as a term of supervised release when the reincarceration is over? 8Without more, we would have to admit that Congress had
used "revoke" in an unconventional way in subsection (3),but it turns out that the unconventional sense is not unheard
of. See United States v. O'Neil, 11 F. 3d 292, 295-296 (CA11993). Webster's Third New International Dictionary (our
edition of which was issued three years before the 1984 Act)reveals that "revoke" can mean "to call or summon back,"
without the implication (here) that no further supervised re-lease is subsequently possible. It gives "recall" as a synonym and comments that "RECALL in this sense indicatesa calling back, suspending, or abrogating, either finally as
erroneous or ill-advised or tentatively for deliberation . . . ."
Ibid.9 The unconventional dictionary definition is not, of

8 Justice Scalia, post, at 721, thinks the "term" survives only as a
measure of duration, but of course the statute does not read "require the
person to serve a term in prison equal to all or part of the term of supervised release . . . ."

9 While this sense is of course less common, the most recent editions of

the most authoritative dictionaries do not tag it as rare or obsolete. The
Oxford English Dictionary gives five examples of this usage, albeit hardly
recent ones: three are drawn from the late 16th century and the most
recent from 1784. 13 Oxford English Dictionary 838 (2d ed. 1989). But
the OED is unabashedly antiquarian; of its examples for the more common
meaning of "revoke," the most recent dates from 1873. Ibid. Webster's,
it should be noted, includes the less common meaning, without antiquarian
reproach, in its third edition. Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1944 (1981).

As Justice Scalia remarks, in relying on an uncommon sense of the
word, we are departing from the rule of construction that prefers ordinary
meaning, see post, at 715. But this is exactly what ought to happen when
the ordinary meaning fails to fit the text and when the realization of clear
congressional policy (here, favoring the ability to impose supervised release) is in tension with the result that customary interpretive rules would
deliver. See, e. g., Commissioner v. Brown, 380 U. S. 563, 571 (1965) (recognizing "some `scope for adopting a restricted rather than a literal or

Opinion of the Court
course, dispositive (although the emphasis placed upon it by
Justice Scalia might suggest otherwise, see post, at 718-719). What it does do, however, is to soften the strangeness

of Congress's unconventional sense of "revoke" as allowing a"revoked" term of supervised release to retain vitality after
revocation. It shows that saying a "revoked" term of super-vised release survives to be served in prison following the
court's reconsideration of it is consistent with a secondarybut recognized definition, and so is saying that any balance
not served in prison may survive to be served out as super-vised release.

A final textually based point is that the result of recogniz-ing Congress's unconventional usage of "revoke" is far less
remarkable even than the unconventional usage. Let ussuppose that Congress had legislated in language that unusual meaning of its words where acceptance of that meaning . . . would
thwart the obvious purpose of the statute' ") (quoting Helvering v. Hammel, 311 U. S. 504, 510-511 (1941); In re Chapman, 166 U. S. 661, 667 (1897)
("[N]othing is better settled, than that statutes should receive a sensible
construction, such as will effectuate the legislative intention, and, if possible, so as to avoid an unjust or an absurd conclusion"). When text implies
that a word is used in a secondary sense and clear legislative purpose is
at stake, Justice Scalia's cocktail-party textualism, post, at 718, must
yield to the Congress of the United States. (Not that we consider usage
at a cocktail party a very sound general criterion of statutory meaning: a
few nips from the flask might actually explain the solecism of the dissent's
gunner who "revoked" his bird dog, post, at 719-720, n. 4; in sober moments he would know that dogs cannot be revoked, even though sentencing orders can be. His mistake, in any case, tells us nothing about how
Congress may have used "revoke" in the statute. The gunner's error is,
as Justice Scalia notes, one of current usage. (It is not merely that we
do not "revoke" dogs in a "literal" sense today, as Justice Scalia puts it;
we do not revoke them at all.) The question before us, however, is one
of definition as distinct from usage: when Congress employed the modern
usage in providing that a term of supervised release could be revoked,
was it employing the most modern meaning of the term "revoke"? Usage
can be a guide but not a master in answering a question of meaning like
this one. Justice Scalia's argument from the current unacceptability of
the dog and ox examples thus jeopardizes sound statutory construction
rather more severely than his sportsman ever threatened a bird.)

708 JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
equivocally supported the dissent, by writing subsection (3)
to provide that the judge could "revoke" or "terminate" the
term of supervised release and sentence the defendant to a
further term of incarceration. There is no reason to think
that under that regime the court would lack the power to
impose a subsequent term of supervised release in accordance with its general sentencing authority under 18 U. S. C.

$ 3583(a). This section provides that "[t]he court, in imposing a sentence to a term of imprisonment for a felony or
a misdemeanor, may include as a part of the sentence a
requirement that the defendant be placed on a term of supervised release after imprisonment . . . ." Thus, on the
dissent's reading, when Johnson's supervised release was
revoked and he was committed to prison, the District Court
"impos[ed] a sentence to a term of imprisonment." See,
e. g., App. 36, 39. And that sentence was, as already noted,
imposed for his initial offense, the Class D felony violation of

$ 1029(b)(2). See supra, at 699-701. Nor would it be mere
formalism to link the second prison sentence to the initial
offense; the gravity of the initial offense determines the maximum term of reimprisonment, see $ 3583(e)(3), just as it controls the maximum term of supervised release in the initial
sentencing, see $ 3583(b). Since on the dissent's understanding the resentencing proceeding would fall literally and sensibly within the terms of $ 3583(a), a plain meaning approach
would find authority for reimposition of supervised release
there. Cf. United States v. Wesley, 81 F. 3d 482, 483-484
(CA4 1996) (finding that $ 3583(a) grants power to impose a
term of supervised release following reimprisonment at resentencing for violation of probation).

There is, then, nothing surprising about the consequences
of our reading. The reading also enjoys the virtue of serving the evident congressional purpose. The congressional
policy in providing for a term of supervised release after
incarceration is to improve the odds of a successful transition

Opinion of the Court
from the prison to liberty. See, e. g., United States v. Johnson, ante, at 59 ("Congress intended supervised release to
assist individuals in their transition to community life. Supervised release fulfills rehabilitative ends, distinct from
those served by incarceration"). The Senate Report was
quite explicit about this, stating that the goal of supervised
release is "to ease the defendant's transition into the community after the service of a long prison term for a particularly
serious offense, or to provide rehabilitation to a defendant
who has spent a fairly short period in prison for punishment or other purposes but still needs supervision and
training programs after release." S. Rep. No. 98-225, p. 124
(1983).

Prisoners may, of course, vary in the degree of help needed
for successful reintegration. Supervised release departed
from the parole system it replaced by giving district courts
the freedom to provide postrelease supervision for those, and
only those, who needed it. See id., at 125 ("In effect, the
term of supervised release provided by the bill takes the
place of parole supervision under current law. Unlike current law, however, probation officers will only be supervising
those releasees from prison who actually need supervision,
and every releasee who does need supervision will receive
it"). Congress aimed, then, to use the district courts' discretionary judgment to allocate supervision to those releasees
who needed it most. But forbidding the reimposition of supervised release after revocation and reimprisonment would
be fundamentally contrary to that scheme. A violation of
the terms of supervised release tends to confirm the judgment that help was necessary, and if any prisoner might
profit from the decompression stage of supervised release,
no prisoner needs it more than one who has already tried
liberty and failed. He is the problem case among problem
cases, and a Congress asserting that "every releasee who
does need supervision will receive it," ibid., seems very un529US3 Unit: $U56 [09-28-01 09:22:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN

likely to have meant to compel the courts to wash their handsof the worst cases at the end of reimprisonment.

10

The idea that a sentencing court should have authority tosubject a reincarcerated prisoner to further supervised release has support, moreover, in the pre-Guidelines practice
with respect to nondetentive monitoring, as illuminated in
United States v. O'Neil, 11 F. 3d 292 (CA1 1993). The Sentencing Guidelines, after all, "represent an approach that begins with, and builds upon," pre-Guidelines law, see USSG,
ch. 1, pt. A, intro. comment. 3, and when a new legal regime
develops out of an identifiable predecessor, it is reasonable
to look to the precursor in fathoming the new law. Cf. INS
v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U. S. 421, 432-434 (1987) (examining
practice under precursor statute to determine meaning of
amended statute).

Two sorts of nondetentive monitoring existed before the
introduction of supervised release: probation and parole. Of
these pre-Guidelines options, the one more closely analogous

10 Justice Scalia attributes the strong preference for supervised release at the conclusion of a prison term to this Court, post, at 724, when
that view of penal policy comes not from the Court but from Congress.
The point is crucial. Our obligation is to give effect to congressional purpose so long as the congressional language does not itself bar that result.
See, e. g., Holloway v. United States, 526 U. S. 1, 9 (1999) (noting that
statutory language should be interpreted in light of congressional policy);
Caron v. United States, 524 U. S. 308, 315 (1998) (rejecting petitioner's
reading of a statute because it "yields results contrary to a likely, and
rational, congressional policy"). One who believes that courts must not
look beyond text might well find any invocation of policy unjustified (even
willful), at least when the policy does not rise unbidden from the words of
the statute, but we have never treated the text as such a jealous guide
and have traditionally sought to construe a statute so as to reach results
consistent with what Chief Justice Taney called "its object and policy."
See United States v. Heirs of Boisdore', 8 How. 113, 122 (1849). And in
what Chief Justice Marshall called the attempt "to discover the design of
the legislature," we have "seize[d] every thing from which aid can be derived." United States v. Fisher, 2 Cranch 358, 386 (1805).

Opinion of the Court
to supervised release following imprisonment was parole,which by definition was a release under supervision of a parole officer following service of some term of incarceration.Courts have commented on the similarity. See,

e. g., Meeks,
25 F. 3d, at 1121 ("[S]upervised release is essentially similar
to parole"); United States v. Paskow, 11 F. 3d 873, 881 (CA9
1993) ("Supervised release and parole are virtually identical
systems").

In thinking about this case, it is striking that the provisions of the former parole scheme dealing with the consequences of violating parole conditions repeatedly used the
verb "revoke." See, e. g., 18 U. S. C. $ 4214(d)(5) (1982 ed.)
(repealed 1984, Pub. L. 98-473, $$ 218(a)(5), 235, 98 Stat.
2027, 2031) (revocation of parole); 21 U. S. C. $ 841(c) (1982
ed.) (repealed 1984) (revocation of special parole). And yet
there seems never to have been a question that a new term
of parole could follow a prison sentence imposed after revocation of an initial parole term.11 See, e. g., 28 CFR $ 2.52(b)

11 The same is true of special parole, part of the required sentence for
certain drug offenses. Though the special parole statute did not explicitly
authorize reimposition of special parole after revocation of the initial term
and reimprisonment, the Parole Commission required it. See 28 CFR

$ 2.57(c) (1999). Some courts have recently decided that this regulation is
inconsistent with 21 U. S. C. $ 841(c) (1982 ed.), see, e. g., Evans v. United
States Parole Comm'n, 78 F. 3d 262 (CA7 1996), but this does not affect
the backdrop against which Congress legislated in 1984.

As for probation, the sentencing court's power to order a new term
following revocation was the subject of some disagreement. The preGuidelines statute authorized the court to "revoke the probation and . . .
impose any sentence which might originally have been imposed." 18
U. S. C. $ 3653 (1982 ed.) (repealed). The statute thus clearly specified
that the options for postrevocation sentencing were those available at the
original sentencing; courts disputed only whether probation was a "sentence" that could be imposed. See O'Neil, 11 F. 3d, at 298-299 (collecting
cases). The dispute over what counted as a sentence does not affect the
broader point that a court's powers at the original sentencing are the
baseline from which powers at resentencing are determined. Nor is our

712 JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
(1999) (following revocation of parole, Sentencing Commis-sion will determine whether reparole is warranted); O'Neil,

supra, at 299; United States Parole Comm'n v. Williams, 54F. 3d 820, 824 (CADC 1995) (noting "the established preGuidelines sentencing principle that parole is available un-less expressly precluded" (citation and internal quotation
marks omitted)).12 Thus, "revocation" of parole followed byfurther imprisonment was not a mere termination of a limited liberty that a defendant could experience only once perconviction, and it is fair to suppose that in the absence of any
textual bar "revocation" of parole's replacement, supervisedrelease, was meant to leave open the possibility of further
supervised release, as well.As seen already, "revoke" is no such bar, and we find no
other. The proceeding that follows a violation of the conditions of supervised release is not, to be sure, a precise reen-actment of the initial sentencing. Section 3583(e)(3) limits

the possible prison term to the duration of the term of supervised release originally imposed. (If less than the maximumhas been imposed, a court presumably may, before revoking

the term, extend it pursuant to $ 3583(e)(2); this would allowthe term of imprisonment to equal the term of supervised
release authorized for the initial offense.) The new prisonterm is limited further according to the gravity of the original offense. See $ 3583(e)(3). But nothing in these specific
analysis of supervised release drawn into question by the fact that courts
could not, for violations of probation, impose imprisonment followed by
probation. Probation, unlike supervised release, was an alternative to imprisonment. Courts did not have the power to impose both at the original
sentencing, so their inability to do so at subsequent sentencings is no
surprise.

12 The dissent seems to misconstrue our discussion of pre-Guidelines

practice, see post, at 724-726, claiming that the practice is unilluminating
because the possibility of parole inhered in any prison sentence. But our
point simply is that, metaphysics aside, Congress gave no indication that
it thought supervised release after reincarceration would be less valuable
than reparole after reincarceration had been.

provisions suggests that the possibility of supervised releasefollowing imprisonment was meant to be eliminated.

13

In sum, from a purely textual perspective, the more plau-sible reading of $ 3583(e)(3) before its amendment and the

addition of subsection (h) leaves open the possibility of su-pervised release after reincarceration. Pre-Guidelines practice, linguistic continuity from the old scheme to the current
one, and the obvious thrust of congressional sentencing pol-icy confirm that, in applying the law as before the enactment

of subsection (h), district courts have the authority to orderterms of supervised release following reimprisonment.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the SixthCircuit is

Affirmed.
Justice Kennedy, concurring in part.
The Court holds that 18 U. S. C. $ 3583(e)(3), as it stood
before the amendment adding what is now subsection (h),permits a trial court to impose further incarceration followed

by a period of supervised release after revoking an earlier
supervised release because the conditions were violated. In
my view this is the correct result. The subsection permits
a court to "require [a] person to serve in prison all or part
of the term of supervised release" originally imposed. 18
U. S. C. $ 3583(e)(3) (1988 ed., Supp. V). This indicates that
after the right to be on supervised release has been revoked
there is yet an unexpired term of supervised release that can
be allocated, in the court's discretion, in whole or in part
to confinement and to release on such terms and conditions

13 Nor does our traditional rule of lenity in interpreting criminal statutes
demand a contrary result. Lenity applies only when the equipoise of competing reasons cannot otherwise be resolved (not the case here), and in
any event the rule of lenity would be Delphic in this case. There is simply
no way to tell whether sentencing courts given the option of supervised
release will generally be more or less lenient in fixing the second prison
sentence.

as the court specifies. This was the convincing analysisadopted by the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in

reaching the same conclusion, and it suffices to resolve thecase. See

United States v. O'Neil, 11 F. 3d 292 (1993). The
analysis, moreover, is no less fair than Justice Scalia's,
post, at 722, n. 5 (dissenting opinion), which, after explaining
at length that the only possible meaning of "revoke a term"
is " `to annul' " it, post, at 715, to " `cancel' " it, post, at 716,and to treat it "as though it had never existed,"

post, at 717,
explains away the statute's later inconvenient reference to"the term of supervised release" as "describ[ing] the

length
of the permitted imprisonment by reference to that nowdefunct term of supervised release," post, at 721. This, of
course, is not what the text says. Indeed, for support
Justice Scalia turns to Congress' use of "terminate" in

$ 3583(g)--which Justice Scalia elsewhere concedes "was
a mistake." Post, at 718, n. 2. Faced with a choice between
two difficult readings of what all must admit is not optimal
statutory text, the Court is correct to adopt the interpretation that makes the most sense.

I would not go on to suggest, as the Court does, that a
court could extend a term of supervised release pursuant
to $ 3583(e)(2) prior to revoking the term under $ 3583(e)(3).
Ante, at 712. The subparts of $ 3583(e) are phrased in the
disjunctive; and $ 3583(e)(3) must stand on its own. This
suggests the term of imprisonment plus any further term of
supervised release imposed under $ 3583(e)(3) may not exceed the original term of supervised release that had been
imposed and then violated.

Nor would I invoke 18 U. S. C. $ 3583(a), ante, at 708, which
raises more issues than it resolves, not the least of which is
the description of the District Court's action as "imposing a
sentence." Petitioner's sentence was imposed upon conviction. What is at issue in this case is the appropriate adjustment to make to that sentence when the prisoner has violated the conditions of supervised release.

Justice Thomas, concurring in the judgment.
I agree with the Court's textual analysis of 18 U. S. C.

$ 3583(e)(3) (1988 ed., Supp. V), and think that analysis sufficient to resolve this case. I agree with Justice Kennedythat the Court's discussions of $ 3583(a),

ante, at 707-708, and

$ 3583(e)(2), ante, at 712, are unnecessary to the result. Iwould not rely, as the Court (

ante, at 708-710) and Justice
Kennedy (ante this page (opinion concurring in part)) do, onany apparent congressional purpose supporting the Court's

reading of $ 3583(e)(3). With these observations, I concur inthe judgment.

Justice Scalia, dissenting.
I agree with Parts I and II of the Court's opinion, andthus, like the Court, believe that the case ultimately turns

on the meaning of 18 U. S. C. $ 3583(e)(3) (1988 ed., Supp. V).
I do not agree, however, with the Court's interpretation of
that provision. The section provides that when the conditions of supervised release are violated, the court may "revoke a term of supervised release, and require the person to
serve in prison all or part of the term of supervised release
without credit for time previously served on postrelease supervision." Finding in this an authorization for imposition
of additional supervised release is an act of willpower rather
than of judgment.

The term "revoke" is not defined by the statute, and thus
should be construed "in accordance with its ordinary or natural meaning." FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U. S. 471, 476 (1994). As
the Court recognizes, the ordinary meaning of "revoke" is
" `to annul by recalling or taking back.' " Ante, at 704 (quoting Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1944
(1981)); see also American Heritage Dictionary 1545 (3d ed.

716 JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES

Scalia, J., dissenting
1992) (defining "revoke" as "[t]o void or annul by recalling,withdrawing, or reversing; cancel; rescind"). Under this

reading, the "revoked" term of supervised release is simplycanceled; and since there is no authorization for a new term
of supervised release to replace the one that has been re-voked, additional supervised release is unavailable.

The Court is not content with this natural reading, how-ever, and proceeds to adopt what it calls an "unconventional"
reading of "revoke," ante, at 706, as meaning "to call or sum-mon back" without annulling,

ibid.1 It thereby concludesthat the revoked term of supervised release retains some

effect, and thus that additional supervised release may berequired after reimprisonment. The Court suggests that its
abandonment of ordinary meaning is justified by the text,by congressional purpose, and by analogy to pre-Guidelines
practice regarding nondetentive monitoring. None of theproffered reasons is convincing.

The Court claims textual support for its "unconventional"reading in the fact that subsection (e)(3), at issue here, uses
the term "revoke," while subsection (e)(1) uses the term"terminate." Since, the Court reasons, the two terms
should not be interpreted to have exactly the same meaning,(1) the statute must intend a "less common" meaning of "revoke," namely, "call back," see ante, at 706, and n. 9; and (2)this "less common" meaning authorizes the later imposition
of supervised release. Each part of this two-step analysis ispatently false.

1 Describing the Court's reading as "unconventional" makes it sound perfectly O. K. There are, after all, unconventional houses, unconventional
hairdos, even unconventional batting stances, all of which are fine.
Houses, hairdos, and batting stances, however, have an independent existence apart from convention, whereas words are nothing but a convention--
particular sounds which by agreement represent particular concepts, and
(in the case of most written languages) particular symbols which by agreement represent particular sounds. Thus, when the Court admits that it
is giving the word "revoke" an "unconventional" meaning, it says that it
is choosing to ignore the word "revoke."

Scalia, J., dissenting
As to the first: The usual, ordinary-English definition of"revoke" is already amply distinguishable from "terminate,"

and does not have to be tortured into Old English (or actu-ally, transliteration from Old Latin) in order to explain the
choice of words. "Terminate" connotes completion ratherthan cancellation. See American Heritage Dictionary 1852
(3d ed. 1992) (defining "terminate" as "[t]o bring to an endor a halt" or "[t]o occur at or form the end of; conclude or
finish"); Webster's New International Dictionary 2605 (2d ed.1942) (defining "terminate" as "[t]o put an end to; to make to
cease; to end . . . to form the conclusion of . . ."). Using"terminate" in subsection (e)(1) and "revoke" (in its ordinary
sense) in subsection (e)(3) is not only not inexplicable; it re-flects an admirably precise use of language. In subsection
(e)(1), the term of supervised release is "terminated"
("brought to an end") because termination is warranted "bythe conduct of the defendant released and the interest of justice." The supervised release is treated as fulfilled, and thesentence is complete. In subsection (e)(3), by contrast, the
supervised release term is not merely brought to an end; it
is annulled and treated as though it had never existed, thedefendant receiving no credit for any supervised release

served. It would be hard to pick two words more clearlyconnoting these distinct consequences than "terminate" and
"revoke." 2

2 The Court is correct, ante, at 705, n. 7, that my suggested explanation
of the difference between "terminate" and "revoke" does not comport with
the use of "terminate" in $ 3583(g). But the use of the term in that subsection also contradicts the Court's explanation of the difference between
the two terms--viz., that "terminate," unlike in its view "revoke," "conclude[s] any possibility of supervised release later," ante, at 704. For the
Court evidently believes (contrary to the use of "terminate" in $ 3583(g))
that further supervised release is available when a supervisee is reimprisoned for possession of a controlled substance. It would be "fundamentally
contrary" to the congressional scheme, the Court asserts, if supervised
release following reimprisonment were not available for "one who has already tried liberty and failed," ante, at 709. But the use of "terminate" in

529US3 Unit: $U56 [09-28-01 09:22:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN
718 JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES

Scalia, J., dissenting
The first step of the Court's analysis--its inference thatthe use of "terminate" in subsection (e)(1) requires its alternative meaning of "revoke" in subsection (e)(3)--is alsowrong because the alternative meaning that the Court posits
("to call or summon back," without the implication of annul-ment, ante, at 706) is not merely (as the Court says) "less
common," ante, at 706, n. 9; in the context that is relevanthere, it is utterly unheard of. One can "call or summon
back" a person or thing without implication of annulment,but it is quite impossible to "call or summon back" an order
or decree without that implication--which is precisely whythe primary meaning of revoke has shifted from its root
meaning ("call or summon back") to the meaning that itbears in its most common context,

i. e., when applied to or-ders or decrees ("cancel or annul"). Of course the acid test

of whether a word can reasonably bear a particular meaningis whether you could use the word in that sense at a cocktail
party without having people look at you funny. The Court'sassigned meaning would surely fail that test, even late in the
evening. Try telling someone, "Though I do not cancel orannul my earlier action, I revoke it." The notion that Con$ 3583(g) prescribes just that. Further, $ 3583(g) undermines the Court's
argument that because $ 3583(e)(3) authorizes the court to "revoke a term
of supervised release" and then to require "all or part of the term" to be
served in prison, the revoked term must retain some metaphysical vitality.
See ante, at 705-706. This is so because $ 3583(g) provides that the court
shall "terminate the term of supervised release" (hence extinguishing it
even in the Court's view), and yet goes on to provide that the court shall
require the defendant to serve at least one-third of "the term of supervised release" in prison. See infra, at 721. So on either the Court's interpretation of the difference between "terminate" and "revoke" or on mine,
the use of "terminate" in $ 3583(g) was a mistake--which is why Congress
has since amended it to read "revoke." See $ 110505, 108 Stat. 2017. See
also Brief for United States 25, n. 20 ("Congress apprehended that the
term `terminate' was inappropriate [in $ 3583(g)]"). If we both concede
it was a mistake, that leaves my explanation of the difference between
"terminate" in $ 3583(e)(1) and "revoke" in $ 3583(e)(3) uncontradicted.

gress, by the phrase "revoke a term of supervised release,"meant "recall but not cancel a term of supervised release" is

both linguistically and conceptually absurd.The dictionary support that the Court seeks to enlist for
its definition is fictitious. It is indeed the case that both theOxford English Dictionary and Webster's Third New International Dictionary give as a meaning of "revoke" "to call orsummon back"; but neither of them adds the fillip that is
essential to the Court's point--that the thing called back "re-tain vitality."

Ante, at 707. They say nothing at all aboutthe implication of calling or summoning back--which, in the

case of calling or summoning back an order or decree, is nec-essarily annulment.

3 Further, while the dictionaries the

Court mentions do not give its chosen meaning "antiquarianreproach," ante, at 706, n. 9, many dictionaries do. The New

Shorter Oxford shows this usage as obsolete, see NewShorter Oxford English Dictionary 2583 (1993), and the previous edition of Webster's New International shows it asrare, see Webster's New International Dictionary 2134 (2d
ed. 1942). Other dictionaries also show the Court's chosenmeaning as rare,

e. g., Chambers English Dictionary 1257(1988), as obsolete or archaic, e. g., Cassell Concise English

Dictionary 1149 (1992); Funk and Wagnalls New StandardDictionary 2104 (1957), or do not give it as a meaning at all,
e. g., American Heritage Dictionary 1545 (3d ed. 1992).4

3 As the Court suggests in its quotation of Webster's Third's definition
of "RECALL," see ante, at 706, the annulment may be only temporary (a
"suspension"); but that is so only if there is some authority for repromulgation after the revocation--which leaves the Court no further along than it
was before it dipped into the more obscure meanings of "revoke": it must
identify some authority to reimpose supervised release. This blends into
the next point made in text.

4 Whether one attributes any currency to "revoke" in the sense of "call

back" depends, I think, on whether one counts as current usage figurative
usage. The OED, while not showing the meaning "to call back" as obsolete, does indicate that its current usage is "chiefly fig[urative]." 13 Ox529US3 Unit: $U56 [09-28-01 09:22:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Scalia, J., dissenting
As for the second step of the Court's analysis: Even if
there were justification for giving "revoke" something other
than its normal meaning, and even if the meaning the Court
adopts were not unheard of, the latter meaning still does not
provide the needed authorization for reimposition of supervised release. The statute does not say that the court may
"revoke" ("call back," as the Court would have it) only part
of the term of supervised release, so there is no argument
that some portion remains in place for later use. Thus, even
if "revoke" means "call back," a court would need statutory
authorization to reimpose this "called back" term of supervised release. But $ 3583(e)(3) provides no such authorization. The court is empowered to "revoke" the term; it is
empowered to require that "all or part" of the term be
served in prison; it is not empowered to reimpose "all or
part" of the term as a later term of supervised release.

ford English Dictionary 838 (2d ed. 1989) (OED). Just as current usage
would allow one to say that "the emperor called back his decree," so also
it would allow one to say that the emperor "revoked" his decree in that
figurative sense of "calling it back"--i. e., in the sense of canceling it. It
is assuredly not current usage, however--I think not even rare current
usage--to use "revoke" to connote a literal calling back. ("Since my bird
dog was ranging too far afield, I revoked him.")

The Court chastises this example, suggesting that only a tippling hunter
would "revoke" his bird dog, as "dogs cannot be revoked, even though
sentencing orders can be." Ante, at 707, n. 9. I could not agree more.
However, the definition the Court employs ("call back" without the implication of cancellation) envisions that dogs can be revoked--thus illustrating its obscurity. The OED definition on which the Court relies, see ante,
at 706, n. 9, defines "revoke" as "to recall; to call or summon back . . . an
animal or thing." 13 OED 838 (2d ed. 1989). The first example it gives
of this usage is as follows: "These hounds . . . being acquainted with their
masters watchwordes, eyther in revoking or imboldening them to serve
the game." Ibid. Of course the Court's "not unheard of" usage, ante, at
706, is not limited to recalling dogs--oxen can be revoked as well, as the
OED's third example illustrates: "Ye must revoke The patient Oxe unto
the Yoke." 13 OED 838.

Scalia, J., dissenting
The Court opines that no authorization for further super-vised release is needed, because the fact that the district

court may require "all or part of the term of supervised re-lease" to be served in prison demonstrates that the revoked
term continues to have some metaphysical effect, ante, at705-706, so that "the balance of it [can] remain effective as a
term of supervised release when the reincarceration is over,"
ante, at 706. It demonstrates no such thing. In allowingthe district court to require that "all or part of the term of

supervised release" be spent in prison, the statute simplydescribes the

length of the permitted imprisonment by reference to that now-defunct term of supervised release. It is
quite beyond me how the Court can believe that the statute
"does not read" this way, ante, at 706, n. 8, and the concurrence that "[t]his . . . is not what the text says," ante, at 714.
A "term of supervised release" in what might be called the
substantive rather than the temporal sense--i. e., the sentence to a period of supervised release--cannot possibly be
served in prison. To be in prison is not to be released. The
only sense in which "all or part of the term of supervised
release" can be served in prison is the temporal sense. Cf.
United States v. Johnson, ante, at 57 ("To say respondent
was released while still imprisoned diminishes the concept
the word intends to convey"). The Court's unrealistic reading is also undermined by the fact that $ 3583(g) provides for
serving in prison part of "the term of supervised release,"
in spite of the fact that the term there has been "terminated," so that even the Court would not claim it has ongoing
vitality. See n. 2, supra. And finally, in concluding that the
term of supervised release remains in place, the Court essentially reads the phrase "revoke a term of supervised release"
out of the statute, treating the subsection as if it did no more
than authorize the court to "require the person to serve in
prison all or part of the term of supervised release" originally imposed, $ 3583(e)(3). Of course the statute could have
been drafted to say just that--allowing the court to require

Scalia, J., dissenting
part of the term of supervised release to be served in prison,with the rest of the term remaining in place to be served on

supervised release. In the text actually adopted, however,the supervised-release term is not left in place, but is explicitly "revoked." 5Further, if one assumes, as the Court does, that a revoked
term somehow "survives the . . . order of revocation," ante,at 705, and retains effect (even without any statutory authorization for reimposition or reactivation), then it wouldfollow that whatever part of it is not required to be served
in prison is necessarily still in effect. Thus the districtcourt would have no discretion

not to require the remainderof the term to be served on supervised release. Yet the

Court seems to view further supervised release as only an"option." Ante, at 704, 713, n. 13; accord, ante, at 713-714
(Kennedy, J., concurring in part).The Court's confusing discussion of how $ 3583(a) would
produce consequences similar to those its opinion achieves--
and consequences that are entirely reasonable--i f$ 3583(e)(3) read differently from the way it does read,

ante,
at 707-708, is entirely irrelevant. I do not contend that theresult the Court reaches is any way remarkable, only that it

is not the result called for by the statute. The Court care-fully

does not maintain--and it could not, for reasons I need
not describe--that subsection (a) justifies imposition of post5 The concurrence adjusts for that inconvenient fact by simply changing
the object of the verb, concluding that "after the right to be on supervised
release has been revoked there is yet an unexpired term of supervised
release that can be allocated . . . in whole or in part to confinement and to
release . . . ." Ante, at 713 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part) (emphasis
added). The statute, however, does not revoke "the right to be on supervised release"; it revokes the "term of supervised release" itself, see

$ 3583(e)(3), which is utterly incompatible with the notion that the term
remains in place. Switching the object of "revoke" is no fair in itself, and
it leaves the provision entirely redundant, since revoking "the right to be
on supervised release" adds nothing to "requir[ing] the person to serve in
prison all or part of the term," $ 3583(e)(3).

revocation supervisory release given the actual text of sub-section (e)(3), and nothing more is pertinent here. Hypothetical discussion of what role $ 3583(a) might play hadCongress legislated differently is beside the point.

The Court next turns to questions of policy--framed as aninquiry into "congressional purpose."

Ante, at 708. Citing
legislative history (although not legislative history discussing the particular subsection at issue), ante, at 709-710, theCourt explains what it views as the policies Congress seeks

to serve with supervised release generally, and then explainshow these general policies would be undermined by reading

$ 3583(e)(3) as written. "Our obligation," the Court says, "is
to give effect to congressional purpose so long as the congressional language does not itself bar that result." Ante,
at 710, n. 10. I think not. Our obligation is to go as far

in achieving the general congressional purpose as the text
of the statute fairly prescribes--and no further. We stop
where the statutory language does, and do not require explicit prohibition of our carrying the ball a few yards beyond.
In any event, as read by any English speaker except one who
talks of revoking a dog, the statute does "bar" the result the
Court reaches here. The proper canon to govern the present case is quite simple: "[W]here, as here, the statute's language is plain, `the sole function of the courts is to enforce
it according to its terms,' " United States v. Ron Pair Enterprises, Inc., 489 U. S. 235, 241 (1989) (quoting Caminetti v.
United States, 242 U. S. 470, 485 (1917)).

Perhaps there is a scrivener's error exception to that
canon, see, e. g., Holloway v. United States, 526 U. S. 1, 19,
n. 2 (1999) (Scalia, J., dissenting); Green v. Bock Laundry
Machine Co., 490 U. S. 504, 527-528 (1989) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment), but the words of today's author in another case well describe why that is inapplicable here: "This
case is a far cry from the rare one where the effect of implementing the ordinary meaning of the statutory text would
be patent absurdity or demonstrably at odds with the inten529US3 Unit: $U56 [09-28-01 09:22:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tions of its drafters." BFP v. Resolution Trust Corporation, 511 U. S. 531, 563 (1994) (Souter, J., dissenting) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). It would havebeen entirely reasonable for Congress to conclude that a prisoner who had broken the terms of supervised release seri-ously enough to be reincarcerated should not be trusted in
that status again; and that a judge should not be tempted to
impose an inappropriately short period of reimprisonmentby the availability of further supervised release. Congress

might also have wished to eliminate the unattractive pros-pect that a prisoner would go through one or even more repetitions of the violation-reimprisonment-supervised-release
sequence--which is avoided by requiring the district court
confronted with a violation either to leave the prisoner on
supervised release (perhaps with tightened conditions and
lengthened term, as $ 3583(e)(2) permits) or to impose imprisonment, but not to combine the two. Because the interpretation demanded by the text is an entirely plausible one,
this Court's views of what is prudent policy are beside the
point. And that is so whether those policy views are forthrightly stated as such ("[I]f any prisoner might profit from
the decompression stage of supervised release, no prisoner
needs it more than one who has already tried liberty and
failed," ante, at 709), or whether, to give an interpretive odor
to the opinion, they are recast as policies that it "seems very
unlikely" for Congress to have intended ("Congress . . .
seems very unlikely to have meant to compel the courts to
wash their hands of the worst cases at the end of reimprisonment," ante, at 709-710).

Finally, the Court appeals to pre-Guidelines practice with
regard to nondetentive monitoring. But this cannot cure
the lack of statutory authorization for additional supervised
release. Even if the language of $ 3583(e)(3) were ambiguous (which it is not), that history would be of little relevance,
since the Sentencing Reform Act's adoption of supervised
release was meant to make a significant break with prior

practice, see Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361, 366(1989) (describing the Act's "sweeping reforms"); GozlonPeretz v. United States, 498 U. S. 395, 407 (1991) ("Super-vised release is a unique method of postconfinement supervision invented by the Congress for a series of sentencingreforms").

6 The Court's effort to equate parole and supervised release, ante, at 710-712, is unpersuasive. Unlike pa-role, which replaced a portion of a defendant's prison sentence, supervised release is a separate term imposed at thetime of initial sentencing. Compare 18 U. S. C. $ 3583(a)
with 18 U. S. C. $$ 4205(a), 4206 (1982 ed.) (repealed); see alsoUSSG ch. 7, pt. A, intro. comment. 2(b). This distinction has
important consequences for the present question, since whenparole was "revoked" (unlike when supervised release is
revoked), there was no need to impose a new term ofimprisonment; the term currently being served (on parole)
was still in place. Similarly, there was no occasion to imposea new term of parole, since the possibility of parole was inherent in the remaining sentence. See 18 U. S. C. $ 4205(a)(1982 ed.) ("Whenever confined and serving a definite term

6 United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual ch. 1, pt. A,
intro. comment. 3 (Nov. 1998) (USSG), is not to the contrary. The Court
quotes the comment for the broad proposition that "[t]he Sentencing
Guidelines, after all, `represent an approach that begins with, and builds
upon,' pre-Guidelines law." Ante, at 710. The comment itself, however,
makes the much more narrow point that data on sentences imposed preGuidelines were used as a "starting point" in devising sentencing ranges
under the Guidelines. The sentence from which the Court quotes states:
"Despite . . . policy-oriented departures from pre-guidelines practice, the
guidelines represent an approach that begins with, and builds upon, empirical data." USSG ch. 1, pt. A, intro. comment. 3. This sheds no light on
the extent to which prior practice in matters other than length of sentence
underlay the Guidelines, much less on the extent to which such prior practice is a meaningful guide to statutory interpretation in general--and even
less to statutory interpretation pertaining to supervised release, which
the Guidelines elsewhere refer to as "a new form of post-imprisonment
supervision created by the Sentencing Reform Act," id., ch. 7, pt. A, intro.

or terms of more than one year, a prisoner shall be eligiblefor release on parole after serving one-third of such

term . . ."). The question whether further supervised re-lease may be required after revocation of supervised release
is so entirely different from the question whether furtherparole may be accorded after revocation of parole, that the
Court's appeal to the parole practice demonstrates nothingexcept the dire scarcity of arguments available to support
its conclusion.7

7 The Court also appeals to pre-Guidelines practice regarding probation
and special parole. Ante, at 711-712, n. 11. The pre-Guidelines probation practice is altogether inapt, since the governing statute explicitly provided for resentencing after violation, and specifically allowed the court
to "impose any sentence which might originally have been imposed." 18
U. S. C. $ 3653 (1982 ed.) (repealed). This makes it quite impossible for
probation practice to support the Court's "broader point that a court's
powers at the original sentencing are the baseline from which powers at
resentencing are determined," ante, at 711, n. 11; all it proves is that they
are the baseline where the statute says so. Indeed, the fact that the statute found it necessary to say so tends to contradict the Court's position.

Special parole, while more akin to supervised release than either parole
or probation, hardly provides clear support for the Court's reading of

$ 3583(e)(3). In fact, the majority of Courts of Appeals have read the
relevant statute regarding special parole, 21 U. S. C. $ 841(c) (1982 ed.) (repealed), as not allowing reimposition of special parole in circumstances
analogous to those at issue here. See Manso v. Federal Detention Center,
182 F. 3d 814, 817 (CA11 1999) (citing cases). The Court's reliance on the
Parole Commission's 1977 interpretation of the special parole statute, see
28 CFR $ 2.57(c) (1999), is misplaced. The principle that Congress is presumed to legislate in light of existing administrative interpretations does
not stretch to cover an administrative interpretation of a statute dealing
with a different subject, of recent vintage, and unsupported by judicial opinion. Cf. Bragdon v. Abbott, 524 U. S. 624, 645 (1998) (repetition
of existing statutory language assumed to incorporate "uniform body of
administrative and judicial precedent" that had "settled the meaning" of
existing provision); Haig v. Agee, 453 U. S. 280, 297 (1981) (assuming
congressional awareness of "longstanding administrative construction").
Further, some courts have found it unclear whether the Parole Commission's regulation itself envisions reimposition of special parole. See, e. g.,
Fowler v. United States Parole Commission, 94 F. 3d 835, 841 (CA3 1996).

This is not an important case, since it deals with the inter-pretation of a statute that has been amended to eliminate,

for the future, the issue we today resolve. But an institu-tion that is careless in small things is more likely to be careless in large ones; and an institution that is willful in smallthings is almost certain to be willful in large ones. The fact
that nothing but the Court's views of policy and "congres-sional purpose" supports today's judgment is a matter of
great concern, if only because of what it tells district andcircuit judges. The overwhelming majority of the Courts of
Appeals--9 out of 11--notwithstanding what they mighthave viewed as the more desirable policy arrangement,
reached the result unambiguously demanded by the statu-tory text. See ante, at 698, n. 2. Today's decision invites

PUBLIC LANDS COUNCIL et al. v. BABBITT,

SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR, et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe tenth circuit

No. 98-1991. Argued March 1, 2000--Decided May 15, 2000
The Taylor Grazing Act, inter alia, grants the Secretary of the Interior

authority to divide the public rangelands into grazing districts, to specify the amount of grazing permitted in each district, and to issue grazing
leases or permits to "settlers, residents, and other stock owners," 43
U. S. C. $$ 315, 315a, 315b; gives preference with respect to permits to
"landowners engaged in the livestock business, bona fide occupants or
settlers, or owners of water or water rights," $ 315b; and specifies that
grazing privileges "shall be adequately safeguarded," but that the creation of a grazing district or the issuance of a permit does not create
"any right, title, interest, or estate in or to the lands," ibid. Since 1938,
conditions placed on grazing permits have reflected the grazing privileges' leasehold nature, and the grazing regulations in effect have preserved the Secretary's authority to (1) cancel a permit under certain
circumstances, (2) reclassify and withdraw land from grazing to devote
it to a more valuable or suitable use, and (3) suspend animal unit months
(AUMs) of grazing privileges in the event of range depletion. Petitioners, ranching-related organizations, challenged several 1995 amendments to the regulations. The District Court found four of the new
regulations unlawful. The Tenth Circuit reversed as to three of them,
upholding regulations that (1) changed the definition of "grazing preference," 43 CFR $ 4100.0-5; (2) permitted those who are not "engaged in
the livestock business" to qualify for grazing permits, $ 4110.1(a); and
(3) granted the United States title to all future "permanent" range improvements, $ 4120.3-2.

Held: The regulatory changes do not exceed the Secretary's Taylor Grazing Act authority. Pp. 739-750.

(a) Section 4100.0-5's new definition of "grazing preference" does not
violate 43 U. S. C. $ 315b's requirement that "grazing privileges" "be
adequately safeguarded." Before its amendment, $ 4100.0-5 defined
"grazing preference" as "the total number of [AUMs] of livestock grazing on public lands apportioned and attached to base property owned or
controlled by a permittee or lessee," but the 1995 version refers only to
a priority, not to a specific number of AUMs, and it adds a new term,

Syllabus
"permitted use," which refers to forage "allocated by, or under the guidance of an applicable land use plan." The new definitions do not exceed
the Secretary's authority under $ 315b. First, $ 315b's words "so far as
consistent with the purposes" of the Act and "issuance of a permit"
creates no "right, title, interest, or estate" make clear that the ranchers'
interest in permit stability is not absolute and that the Secretary is
free reasonably to determine just how, and the extent to which, grazing
privileges are to be safeguarded. Moreover, since Congress itself has
directed development of land use plans, and their use in the allocation
process, it is difficult to see how a definitional change that simply refers
to using such plans could violate the Taylor Act by itself, without more.
Given the broad discretionary powers that the Taylor Act grants the
Secretary, the Act must be read as here granting him at least ordinary
administrative leeway to assess "safeguard[ing]" in terms of the Act's
other purposes and provisions. Second, the pre-1995 AUM system that
petitioners seek to "safeguard" did not offer them anything like absolute
security, for the Secretary had well-established pre-1995 authority to
cancel, modify, or decline to review permits, including the power to do
so pursuant to a land use plan. Third, the new definitional regulations
by themselves do not automatically bring about a self-executing change
that would significantly diminish the security of grazing privileges.
The Interior Department represents that the new definitions merely
clarify terminology. The new regulations do seem to tie grazing privileges to land use plans more explicitly than did the old. However, all
Bureau of Land Management lands have been covered by land use plans
for nearly 20 years, yet the ranchers have not provided a single example
in which interaction of plan and permit has jeopardized or might jeopardize permit security. A particular land use plan might lead to a denial
of privileges that the pre-1995 regulations would have provided, but
the question here is whether the definition changes by themselves violate the Act's requirement that grazing privileges be "adequately safeguarded." They do not. Pp. 739-744.

(b) The deletion of the phrase "engaged in the livestock business"
from $ 4110.1(a) does not violate the statutory limitation to "stock owners." Section 315b, just two sentences after using "stock owners,"
gives preference to "landowners engaged in the livestock business."
This indicates that Congress did not intend to make the phrases synonyms. Neither the Act's legislative history nor its basic purpose suggests an absolute limit to those engaged in the livestock business was
intended by the term "stock owner." The ranchers' underlying concern
is that the amendment is part of a scheme to end grazing on public lands

by allowing individuals to acquire a few livestock, obtain a permit for
conservation, and then effectively mothball the permit. However, the
remaining regulations, for livestock grazing use or suspended use, do
not encompass the situation that the ranchers describe. Pp. 745-748.

(c) Section 4120.3-2, which specifies that title to permanent range improvements, such as fences, wells, and pipelines, made pursuant to cooperative agreements with the Government shall be in the name of the
United States, does not violate the Act. Nothing in the statute denies
the Secretary authority reasonably to decide when or whether to grant
title to those who make improvements. Any such person remains free
to negotiate the terms upon which he will make those improvements,
including how he might be compensated in the future for his work,
either by the Government or by those granted a Government permit.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case requires us to interpret several provisions ofthe 1934 Taylor Grazing Act, 48 Stat. 1269, 43 U. S. C. $ 315

et seq. The petitioners claim that each of three grazing reg-ulations, 43 CFR $$ 4100.0-5, 4110.1(a), and 4120.3-2 (1998),
exceeds the authority that this statute grants the Secretaryof the Interior. We disagree and hold that the three regulations do not violate the Act.

I
We begin with a brief description of the Act's background,provisions, and related administrative practice.

A
The Taylor Grazing Act's enactment in 1934 marked aturning point in the history of the western rangelands,

the vast, dry grasslands and desert that stretch from west-ern Nebraska, Kansas, and Texas to the Sierra Nevada.
Ranchers once freely grazed livestock on the publicly ownedrange as their herds moved from place to place, searching
for grass and water. But the population growth that fol-lowed the Civil War eventually doomed that unregulated
economic freedom.A new era began in 1867 with the first successful long
drive of cattle north from Texas. Cowboys began regularlydriving large herds of grazing cattle each year through thousands of miles of federal lands to railheads like Abilene, Kan-sas. From there or other towns along the rail line, trains
carried live cattle to newly opened eastern markets. Thelong drives initially brought high profits, which attracted
more ranchers and more cattle to the land once home only toIndian tribes and buffalo. Indeed, an early-1880's boom in
the cattle market saw the number of cattle grazing the GreatPlains grow well beyond 7 million. See R. White, "It's Your
Misfortune and None of My Own": A History of the Ameri-can West 223 (1991); see generally E. Osgood, The Day of the

Opinion of the Court
Cattleman 83-113 (1929); W. Webb, The Great Plains 205-268 (1931).

But more cattle meant more competition for ever-scarcerwater and grass. And that competition was intensified by
the arrival of sheep in the 1870's. Many believed that sheepwere destroying the range, killing fragile grass plants by
cropping them too closely. The increased competition for
forage, along with droughts, blizzards, and growth in home-steading, all aggravated natural forage scarcity. This led, in

turn, to overgrazing, diminished profits, and hostility amongforage competitors--to the point where violence and "wars"
broke out, between cattle and sheep ranchers, between
ranchers and homesteaders, and between those who fenced
and those who cut fences to protect an open range. See
W. Gard, Frontier Justice 81-149 (1949). These circumstances led to calls for a law to regulate the land that once
was free.

The calls began as early as 1878 when the legendary southwestern explorer, Major John Wesley Powell, fearing water
monopoly, wrote that ordinary homesteading laws would not
work and pressed Congress to enact "a general law . . . to
provide for the organization of pasturage districts." Report
on the Lands of the Arid Region of the United States,
H. Exec. Doc. No. 73, 45th Cong., 2d Sess., 28 (1878). From
the end of the 19th century on, Members of Congress regularly introduced legislation of this kind, often with Presidential support. In 1907, President Theodore Roosevelt reiterated Powell's request and urged Congress to pass laws that
would "provide for Government control of the public pasture
lands of the West." S. Doc. No. 310, 59th Cong., 2d Sess.,
5 (1907). But political opposition to federal regulation was
strong. President Roosevelt attributed that opposition to
"those who do not make their homes on the land, but who
own wandering bands of sheep that are driven hither and
thither to eat out the land and render it worthless for the
real home maker"; along with "the men who have already

obtained control of great areas of the public land . . . who
object . . . because it will break the control that these few
big men now have over the lands which they do not actually
own." Ibid. Whatever the opposition's source, bills reflecting Powell's approach did not become law until 1934.

By the 1930's, opposition to federal regulation of the federal range had significantly diminished. Population growth,
forage competition, and inadequate range control all began
to have consequences both serious and apparent. With a
horrifying drought came `dawns without day' as dust storms
swept the range. The devastating storms of the Dust Bowl
were in the words of one Senator "the most tragic, the most
impressive lobbyist, that ha[s] ever come to this Capitol."
79 Cong. Rec. 6013 (1935). Congress acted; and on June 28,
1934, President Franklin Roosevelt signed the Taylor Grazing Act into law.

B

The Taylor Act seeks to "promote the highest use of the
public lands." 43 U. S. C. $ 315. Its specific goals are to
"stop injury" to the lands from "overgrazing and soil deterioration," to "provide for their use, improvement and development," and "to stabilize the livestock industry dependent on
the public range." 48 Stat. 1269. The Act grants the Secretary of the Interior authority to divide the public rangelands into grazing districts, to specify the amount of grazing
permitted in each district, to issue leases or permits "to
graze livestock," and to charge "reasonable fees" for use of
the land. 43 U. S. C. $$ 315, 315a, 315b. It specifies that
preference in respect to grazing permits "shall be given . . .
to those within or near" a grazing district "who are landowners engaged in the livestock business, bona fide occupants or
settlers, or owners of water or water rights." $ 315b. And,
as particularly relevant here, it adds:

"So far as consistent with the purposes and provisions
of this subchapter, grazing privileges recognized and ac529US3 Unit: $U57 [09-26-01 12:19:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN

knowledged shall be adequately safeguarded, but thecreation of a grazing district or the issuance of a

permit . . . shall not create any right, title, interest, orestate in or to the lands." Ibid.

C
The Taylor Act delegated to the Interior Department anenormous administrative task. To administer the Act, the

Department needed to determine the bounds of the publicrange, create grazing districts, determine their grazing capacity, and divide that capacity among applicants. It soonset bounds encompassing more than 140 million acres, and
by 1936 the Department had created 37 grazing districts, seeDepartment of Interior Ann. Rep. 15 (1935); W. Calef, Private Grazing and Public Lands 58-59 (1960). The Secretarythen created district advisory boards made up of local
ranchers and called on them for further help. See 2 App.809-811 (Rules for Administration of Grazing Districts (Mar.
2, 1936)). Limited department resources and the enormityof the administrative task made the boards "the effective
governing and administrative body of each grazing district."Calef,

supra, at 60; accord, P. Foss, Politics and Grass 199-200 (1960).

By 1937 the Department had set the basic rules for allo-cation of grazing privileges. Those rules recognized that
many ranchers had long maintained herds on their own pri-vate lands during part of the year, while allowing their herds
to graze farther afield on public land at other times. Therules consequently gave a first preference to owners of stock
who also owned "base property," i. e., private land (or waterrights) sufficient to support their herds,

and who had grazedthe public range during the five years just prior to the Taylor

Act's enactment. See 2 App. 818-819 (Rules for Adminis-tration of Grazing Districts (June 14, 1937)). They gave a
second preference to other owners of nearby "base" property

529US3 Unit: $U57 [09-26-01 12:19:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN

735Cite as: 529 U. S. 728 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
lacking prior use. Ibid. And they gave a third preference
to stock owners without base property, like the nomadic
sheep herder. Ibid. Since lower preference categories divided capacity left over after satisfaction of all higher preference claims, this system, in effect, awarded grazing privileges to owners of land or water. See Foss, supra, at 63
(quoting Grazing Division Director F. R. Carpenter's remarks that grazing privileges are given to ranchers "not as
individuals, nor as owners of livestock," but to "build up [the]
lands and give them stability and value").

As grazing allocations were determined, the Department
would issue a permit measuring grazing privileges in terms
of "animal unit months" (AUMs), i. e., the right to obtain
the forage needed to sustain one cow (or five sheep) for one
month. Permits were valid for up to 10 years and usually
renewed, as suggested by the Act. See 43 U. S. C. $ 315b;
Public Land Law Review Commission, One Third of the Nation's Land 109 (1970). But the conditions placed on permits
reflected the leasehold nature of grazing privileges, consistent with the fact that Congress had made the Secretary the
landlord of the public range and basically made the grant of
grazing privileges discretionary. The grazing regulations
in effect from 1938 to the present day made clear that the
Department retained the power to modify, fail to renew, or
cancel a permit or lease for various reasons.

First, the Secretary could cancel permits if, for example,
the permit holder persistently overgrazed the public lands,
lost control of the base property, failed to use the permit, or
failed to comply with the Range Code. See, e. g., 43 CFR

$$ 160.26(a)-(f) (1938); Department of Interior, Federal
Range Code $$ 6(c)(6), (7), (10) (1942) (hereinafter 1942
Range Code); 43 CFR $$ 161.6(c)(6)-(7), (10)-(12) (1955); 43
CFR $$ 4115.2-1(d), (e)(7)-(11) (1964); 43 CFR $$ 4115.2-
1(d) (e)(7)-(11) (1977); 43 CFR $ 4170.1-2 (1994); 43 CFR

$ 4170.1-2 (1998). Second, the Secretary, consistent first

Opinion of the Court
with 43 U. S. C. $ 315f, and later the land use planning mandated by 43 U. S. C. $ 1712 (discussed infra, at 737-738), was
authorized to reclassify and withdraw land from grazing
altogether and devote it to a more valuable or suitable use.
See, e. g., 43 CFR $ 160.22 (1938); 1942 Range Code $ 6(c)(4);
43 CFR $ 161.6(c)(5) (1955); 43 CFR $$ 4111.4-2(f ), 4115.2-
1(e)(6) (1964); 43 CFR $$ 4111.4-3(f ), 4115.2-1(e)(6) (1977);
43 CFR $ 4110.4-2(a) (1994); 43 CFR $ 4110.4-2(a) (1998).
Third, in the event of range depletion, the Secretary maintained a separate authority, not to take areas of land out of
grazing use altogether as above, but to reduce the amount of
grazing allowed on that land, by suspending AUMs of grazing privileges "in whole or in part," and "for such time as
necessary." 43 CFR $ 4115.2-1(e)(5) (1964); see also 43 CFR

$ 160.30 (1938) (reservation (b)); 1942 Range Code $ 6(c)(8);
43 CFR $ 161.4(8) (1955); 43 CFR $$ 4111.4-3, 4115.2-1(e)(5)
(1977); 43 CFR $ 4110.3-2 (1994); 43 CFR $ 4110.3-2 (1998).

Indeed, the Department so often reduced individual permit AUM allocations under this last authority that by 1964
the regulations had introduced the notion of "active AUMs,"
i. e., the AUMs that a permit initially granted minus the
AUMs that the department had "suspended" due to diminished range capacity. Thus, three ranchers who had initially
received, say, 3,000, 2,000, and 1,000 AUMs respectively,
might find that they could use only two-thirds of that number
because a 33% reduction in the district's grazing capacity had
led the Department to "suspend" one-third of each allocation.
The "active/suspended" system assured each rancher, however, that any capacity-related reduction would take place
proportionately among permit holders, see 43 CFR $ 4111.4-
2(a)(3) (1964), and that the Department would try to restore
grazing privileges proportionately should the district's capacity later increase, see $ 4111.4-1.

In practice, active grazing on the public range declined
dramatically and steadily (from about 18 million to about

Brief for Respondents 9a.
Despite the reductions in grazing, and some improvementsfollowing the passage of the Taylor Act, see App. 374-379

(Department of Interior, 50 Years of Public Land Manage-ment 1934-1984), the range remained in what many considered an unsatisfactory condition. In 1962, a congressionallymandated survey found only 16.6% of the range in excellent
or good condition, 53.1% in fair condition, and 30.3% in poorcondition. Department of Interior Ann. Rep. 62 (1962).
And in 1978 Congress itself determined that "vast segmentsof the public rangelands are . . . in an unsatisfactory condition." 92 Stat. 1803 (codified as 43 U. S. C. $ 1901(a)(1)).

D
In the 1960's, as the range failed to recover, the Secretaryof the Interior increased grazing fees by more than 50%

(from 19 cents to 30 cents per AUM/year), thereby helpingto capture a little more of the economic costs that grazing
imposed upon the land. Department of Interior Ann. Rep.
66 (1963). And in 1976, Congress enacted a new law, the

Opinion of the Court
Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA),90 Stat. 2744, 43 U. S. C. $ 1701 et seq., which instructed the

Interior Department to develop districtwide land use plansbased upon concepts of "multiple use" (use for various purposes, such as recreation, range, timber, minerals, water-shed, wildlife and fish, and natural and scenic, scientific, and
historical usage), $ 1702(c), and "sustained yield" (regular re-newable resource output maintained in perpetuity), $ 1702(h).
The FLPMA strengthened the Department's existing au-thority to remove or add land from grazing use, allowing
such modification pursuant to a land use plan, $$ 1712, 1714,while specifying that existing grazing permit holders would
retain a "first priority" for renewal so long as the land useplan continued to make land "available for domestic livestock
grazing," $ 1752(c).In 1978, the Department's grazing regulations were, in
turn, substantially amended to comply with the new law.See 43 Fed. Reg. 29067. As relevant here, the 1978 regulations tied permit renewal and validity to the land useplanning process, giving the Secretary the power to cancel, suspend, or modify grazing permits due to increasesor decreases in grazing forage or acreage made available
pursuant to land planning. See 43 CFR $$ 4110.3-2(b),4110.4-2 (1978); see also 43 CFR $ 4110.4-2 (1994); 43 CFR

$ 4110.4-2 (1998).That same year Congress again increased grazing fees for
the period 1979 to 1986. See Public Rangelands Improve-ment Act of 1978, 43 U. S. C. $ 1905. However neither of the
two Acts from the 1970's significantly modified the particularprovisions of the Taylor Act at issue in this case.

E
This case arises out of a 1995 set of Interior Departmentamendments to the federal grazing regulations. 60 Fed.

Reg. 9894 (1995) (Final Rule). The amendments representa stated effort to "accelerate restoration" of the rangeland,

529US3 Unit: $U57 [09-26-01 12:19:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
make the rangeland management program "more compatiblewith ecosystem management," "streamline certain administrative functions," and "obtain for the public fair and reason-able compensation for the grazing of livestock on public
lands." 58 Fed. Reg. 43208 (1993) (Proposed Rule). Theamendments in final form emphasize individual "stewardship" of the public land by increasing the accountability ofgrazing permit holders; broaden membership on the district
advisory boards; change certain title rules; and change ad-ministrative rules and practice of the Bureau of Land Management to bring them into closer conformity with relatedForest Service management practices. See 60 Fed. Reg.
9900-9906 (1995).Petitioners Public Lands Council and other nonprofit
ranching-related organizations with members who hold graz-ing permits brought this lawsuit against the Secretary and
other defendants in Federal District Court, challenging 10 ofthe new regulations. The court found 4 of 10 unlawful. 929
F. Supp. 1436, 1450-1451 (Wyo. 1996). The Court of Appealsreversed the District Court in part, upholding three of the
four. 167 F. 3d 1287, 1289 (CA10 1999). Those three (whichwe shall describe further below) (1) change the definition of
"grazing preference"; (2) permit those who are not "engagedin the livestock business" to qualify for grazing permits; and
(3) grant the United States title to all future "permanent"range improvements. One judge on the Court of Appeals
dissented in respect to the Secretary's authority to promul-gate the first and the third regulations. See id., at 1309-
1318. We granted certiorari to consider the ranchers' claimthat these three regulatory changes exceed the authority
that the Taylor Act grants the Secretary. 528 U. S. 926(1999).

II

A
The ranchers attack the new "grazing preference" reg-ulations first and foremost. Their attack relies upon the

529US3 Unit: $U57 [09-26-01 12:19:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN
740 PUBLIC LANDS COUNCIL v. BABBITT

Opinion of the Court
provision in the Taylor Act stating that "grazing privi-leges recognized and acknowledged shall be adequately

safeguarded . . . ." 43 U. S. C. $ 315b. Before 1995 the reg-ulations defined the term "grazing preference" in terms of
the AUM-denominated amount of grazing privileges thata permit granted. The regulations then defined "grazing
preference" as

"the total number of animal unit months of livestockgrazing on public lands apportioned and attached to base

property owned or controlled by a permittee or lessee."43 CFR $ 4100.0-5 (1994).

The 1995 regulations changed this definition, however, sothat it now no longer refers to grazing privileges "apportioned," nor does it speak in terms of AUMs. The newdefinition defines "grazing preference" as

"a superior or priority position against others forthe purpose of receiving a grazing permit or lease.
This priority is attached to base property owned orcontrolled by the permittee or lessee." 43 CFR

$ 4100.0-5 (1995).
The new definition "omits reference to a specified quantityof forage." 60 Fed. Reg. 9921 (1995). It refers only to a

priority, not to a specific number of AUMs attached to a baseproperty. But at the same time the new regulations add a
new term, "permitted use," which the Secretary defines as

"the forage allocated by, or under the guidance of, anapplicable land use plan for livestock grazing in an allotment under a permit or lease and is expressed inAUMs." 43 CFR $ 4100.0-5 (1995).

This new "permitted use," like the old "grazing preference,"is defined in terms of allocated rights, and it refers to AUMs.
But this new term as defined refers, not to a rancher's foragepriority, but to forage "allocated by, or under the guidance

529US3 Unit: $U57 [09-26-01 12:19:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN

741Cite as: 529 U. S. 728 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
of an applicable land use plan." Ibid. (emphasis added).And therein lies the ranchers' concern.

The ranchers refer us to the administrative history of Tay-lor Act regulations, much of which we set forth in Part I.
In the ranchers' view, history has created expectations inrespect to the security of "grazing privileges"; they have relied upon those expectations; and the statute requires the
Secretary to "safeguar[d]" that reliance. Supported by var-ious farm credit associations, they argue that defining their

privileges in relation to land use plans will undermine thatsecurity. They say that the content of land use plans is difficult to predict and easily changed. Fearing that the result-ing uncertainty will discourage lenders from taking mortgages on ranches as security for their loans, they concludethat the new regulations threaten the stability, and possibly
the economic viability, of their ranches, and thus fail to "safe-guard" the "grazing privileges" that Department regulations
previously "recognized and acknowledged." Brief for Peti-tioners 22-23.

We are not persuaded by the ranchers' argument for three
basic reasons. First, the statute qualifies the duty to "safe-guard" by referring directly to the Act's various goals and

the Secretary's efforts to implement them. The full subsec-tion says:

"So far as consistent with the purposes and provisions
of this subchapter, grazing privileges recognized and acknowledged shall be adequately safeguarded, but thecreation of a grazing district or the issuance of a permit

pursuant to the provisions of this subchapter shall not
create any right, title, interest or estate in or to the
lands." 43 U. S. C. $ 315b (emphasis added).

The words "so far as consistent with the purposes . . . of
this subchapter" and the warning that "issuance of a permit"
creates no "right, title, interest or estate" make clear that
the ranchers' interest in permit stability cannot be absolute;

529US3 Unit: $U57 [09-26-01 12:19:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN
742 PUBLIC LANDS COUNCIL v. BABBITT

Opinion of the Court
and that the Secretary is free reasonably to determine just
how, and the extent to which, "grazing privileges" shall be
safeguarded, in light of the Act's basic purposes. Of course,
those purposes include "stabiliz[ing] the livestock industry,"
but they also include "stop[ping] injury to the public grazing
lands by preventing overgrazing and soil deterioration," and
"provid[ing] for th[e] orderly use, improvement, and development" of the public range. 48 Stat. 1269; see supra, at 733.

Moreover, Congress itself has directed development of
land use plans, and their use in the allocation process, in
order to preserve, improve, and develop the public rangelands. See 43 U. S. C. $$ 1701(a)(2), 1712. That being so, it
is difficult to see how a definitional change that simply refers
to the use of such plans could violate the Taylor Act by itself,
without more. Given the broad discretionary powers that
the Taylor Act grants the Secretary, we must read that Act
as here granting the Secretary at least ordinary administrative leeway to assess "safeguard[ing]" in terms of the Act's
other purposes and provisions. Cf. $$ 315, 315a (authorizing
Secretary to establish grazing districts "in his discretion"
(emphasis added), and to "make provision for protection, administration, regulation, and improvement of such grazing
districts").

Second, the pre-1995 AUM system that the ranchers seek
to "safeguard" did not offer them anything like absolute security--not even in respect to the proportionate shares of
grazing land privileges that the "active/suspended" system
suggested. As discussed above, the Secretary has long had
the power to reduce an individual permit's AUMs or cancel
the permit if the permit holder did not use the grazing privileges, did not use the base property, or violated the Range
Code. See supra, at 735 (collecting CFR citations 1938-
1998). And the Secretary has always had the statutory authority under the Taylor Act and later FLPMA to reclassify
and withdraw rangeland from grazing use, see 43 U. S. C.

Opinion of the Court

$ 315f (authorizing Secretary, "in his discretion, to examineand classify any lands . . . which are more valuable or suitable

for the production of agricultural crops . . . or any other usethan [grazing]"); $$ 1712, 1752(c) (authorizing renewal of permits "so long as the lands . . . remain available for domesticlivestock grazing in accordance with land use plans" (emphasis added)). The Secretary has consistently reserved theauthority to cancel or modify grazing permits accordingly.
See supra, at 735-736 (collecting CFR citations). Giventhese well-established pre-1995 Secretarial powers to cancel,
modify, or decline to renew individual permits, including the
power to do so pursuant to the adoption of a land use plan,the ranchers' diminishment-of-security point is at best a matter of degree.Third, the new definitional regulations by themselves do
not automatically bring about a self-executing change thatwould significantly diminish the security of granted grazing
privileges. The Department has said that the new defini-tions do "not cancel preference," and that any change is
"merely a clarification of terminology." 60 Fed. Reg. 9922(1995). It now assures us through the Solicitor General that
the definitional changes "preserve all elements of prefer-ence" and "merely clarify the regulations within the statutory framework." See Brief in Opposition 13, 14.The Secretary did consider making a more sweeping
change by eliminating the concept of "suspended use"; a
change that might have more reasonably prompted theranchers' concerns. But after receiving comments, he

changed his mind. See 59 Fed. Reg. 14323 (1994). The De-partment has instead said that "suspended" AUMs will

"continue to be recognized and have a priority for addi-tional grazing use within the allotment. Suspended use
provides an important accounting of past grazing use forthe ranching community and is an insignificant administrative workload to the agency." Bureau of Land Man529US3 Unit: $U57 [09-26-01 12:19:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
agement, Rangeland Reform '94: Final EnvironmentalImpact Statement 144 (1994).

Of course, the new definitions seem to tie grazing privi-leges to land use plans more explicitly than did the old. But,
as we have pointed out, the Secretary has since 1976 had theauthority to use land use plans to determine the amount of
permissible grazing, 43 U. S. C. $ 1712. The Secretary alsopoints out that since development of land use plans began
nearly 20 years ago, "all BLM lands in the lower 48 Statesare covered by land use plans," and "all grazing permits in
those States have now been issued or renewed in accordancewith such plans, or must now conform to them." Brief for
Respondents 26. Yet the ranchers have not provided uswith a single example in which interaction of plan and permit
has jeopardized or might yet jeopardize permit security. An
amicus brief filed by a group of Farm Credit Institutionssays that the definitional change will "threate[n]" their

"lending policies." Brief for Farm Credit Institutions asAmicus Curiae 3. But they do not explain why that is so,
nor do they state that the new definitions will, in fact, leadthem to stop lending to ranchers.

We recognize that a particular land use plan could changepre-existing grazing allocation in a particular district. And
that change might arguably lead to a denial of grazing privi-leges that the pre-1995 regulations would have provided.
But the affected permit holder remains free to challengesuch an individual effect on grazing privileges, and the
courts remain free to determine its lawfulness in context.We here consider only whether the changes in the definitions
by themselves violate the Taylor Act's requirement thatrecognized grazing privileges be "adequately safeguarded."
Given the leeway that the statute confers upon the Secre-tary, the less-than-absolute pre-1995 security that permit
holders enjoyed, and the relatively small differences that thenew definitions create, we conclude that the new definitions
do not violate that law.

Opinion of the Court

B
The ranchers' second challenge focuses upon a provision ofthe Taylor Act that limits issuance of permits to "settlers,

residents, and other stock owners . . . ." 43 U. S. C. $ 315b(emphasis added). In 1936, the Secretary, following this requirement, issued a regulation that limited eligibility tothose who "ow[n] livestock." 2 App. 808 (Rules for Administration of Grazing Districts (Mar. 2, 1936)). But in 1942, theSecretary changed the regulation's wording to limit eligibility to those "engaged in the livestock business," 1942 RangeCode $ 3(a), and so it remained until 1994. The new regulation eliminates the words "engaged in the livestock busi-ness," thereby seeming to make eligible otherwise qualified
applicants even if they do not engage in the livestock busi-ness. See 43 CFR $ 4110.1(a) (1995).

The new change is not as radical as the text of the newregulation suggests. The new rule deletes the entire phrase
"engaged in the livestock business" from $ 4110.1, and seemsto require only that an applicant "own or control land or
water base property . . . ." Ibid. But the omission, stand-ing alone, does not render the regulation facially invalid, for
the regulation cannot change the statute, and a regulationpromulgated to guide the Secretary's discretion in exercising
his authority under the Act need not also restate all relatedstatutory language. Ultimately it is

both the Taylor Act andthe regulations promulgated thereunder that constrain the

Secretary's discretion in issuing permits. The statute con-tinues to limit the Secretary's authorization to issue permits
to "bona fide settlers, residents, and other stock owners."43 U. S. C. $ 315b (emphasis added).

Nor will the change necessarily lead to widespread issu-ance of grazing permits to "stock owners" who are not in the
livestock business. Those in the business continue to enjoya preference in the issuance of grazing permits. The same
section of the Taylor Act mandates that the Secretary accorda preference to "landowners engaged in the livestock busi529US3 Unit: $U57 [09-26-01 12:19:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
ness, bona fide occupants or settlers." Ibid. And this stat-utory language has been extremely important in practice.

See supra, at 734-735.The ranchers nonetheless contend that the deletion of the
term "engaged in the livestock business" violates the statu-tory limitation to "stock owners" in $ 315b. The words
"stock owner," they say, meant "commercial stock owner" in
1934, and a commercial stock owner is not simply one whoowns livestock, but one who engages in the business.

Hence, they argue, the Secretary lacks the authority to allowthose who are not engaged in the business to apply for
permits.

The words "stock owner" and "stock owner engaged in the
livestock business," however, are not obvious synonyms.
And we have found no convincing indication that Congress
intended that we treat them as such. Just two sentences
after using the words "stock owner," Congress said that,
among those eligible for permits (i. e., stock owners), preference should be given to "landowners engaged in the livestock
business, bona fide occupants or settlers, or owners of water
or water rights." $ 315b (emphasis added). Why would
Congress add the words "engaged in the livestock business"
if (as the ranchers' argument implies) they add nothing? Cf.
United States v. Nordic Village, Inc., 503 U. S. 30, 36 (1992)
("[A] statute must, if possible, be construed in such fashion
that every word has some operative effect"). The legislative history to which the ranchers point shows that Congress
expected that ordinarily permit holders would be ranchers,
who do engage in the livestock business, but does not show
any such absolute requirement. See, e. g., H. R. Rep.
No. 903, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., 2 (1934); Hearings on H. R. 2835
and H. R. 6462 before the House Committee on the Public
Lands, 73d Cong., 1st and 2d Sess., 96 (1933-1934); Hearings
on H. R. 6462 before the Senate Committee on Public Lands
and Surveys, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., 40 (1934). Nor does the
statute's basic purpose require that the two sets of different

Opinion of the Court
words mean the same thing. Congress could reasonablyhave written the statute to mandate a preference in the

granting of permits to those actively involved in the live-stock business, while not absolutely excluding the possibility
of granting permits to others. The Secretary has not ex-ceeded his powers under the statute.

The ranchers' underlying concern is that the qualifications
amendment is part of a scheme to end livestock grazing onthe public lands. They say that "individuals or organizations owning small quantities of stock [will] acquire grazingpermits, even though they intend not to graze at all or to
graze only a nominal number of livestock--all the while excluding others from using the public range for grazing."
Brief for Petitioners 47-48. The new regulations, they
charge, will allow individuals to "acquire a few livestock, . . .
obtain a permit for what amounts to a conservation purpose
and then effectively mothball the permit." Id., at 48.

But the regulations do not allow this. The regulations
specify that regular grazing permits will be issued for livestock grazing or suspended use. See 43 CFR $$ 4130.2(a),
4130.2(g) (1998). New regulations allowing issuance of permits for conservation use were held unlawful by the Court
of Appeals, see 167 F. 3d, at 1307-1308, and the Secretary
did not seek review of that decision.

Neither livestock grazing use nor suspended use encompasses the situation that the ranchers describe. With regard to the former, the regulations state that permitted livestock grazing "shall be based upon the amount of forage
available for livestock grazing as established in the land use
plan . . . ." 43 CFR $ 4110.2-2(a) (1998) (emphasis added).
Permitted livestock use is not simply a symbolic upper limit.
Under the regulations, a permit holder is expected to make
substantial use of the permitted use set forth in the grazing
permit. For example, the regulations prohibit a permit
holder from "[f]ailing to make substantial grazing use as authorized for 2 consecutive fee years." $ 4140.1(a)(2). If a

748 PUBLIC LANDS COUNCIL v. BABBITT

Opinion of the Court
permit holder does fail to make substantial use as authorizedin his permit for two consecutive years, the Secretary is authorized to cancel from the grazing permit that portion ofpermitted use that the permit holder has failed to use. See

$ 4170.1-2. On the basis of these regulations, the Secretaryhas represented to the Court that "[a] longstanding rule requires that a grazing permit be used for grazing." Brief forRespondents 43, n. 25. Suspended use, in turn, is generally
imposed by the Secretary in response to changing range con-ditions. See

supra, at 736. Permittees may also apply toplace forage in "[t]emporary nonuse" for financial reasons,

but the Secretary must approve such nonuse on an annualbasis and may not grant it for more than three consecutive
years. 43 CFR $ 4130.2(g)(2) (1998). A successful tempo-rary nonuse application, moreover, does not necessarily take
the land out of grazing use--the Secretary may allocateto others the forage temporarily made available via nonrenewable permit. See $$ 4130.2(h), 4130.6-2. In short,nothing in the change to $ 4110.1(a) undermines the Taylor
Act's requirement that the Secretary grant permits "to grazelivestock." 43 U. S. C. $ 315b.

C
The ranchers' final challenge focuses upon a change in theway the new rules allocate ownership of range improvements, such as fencing, well drilling, or spraying for weedson the public lands. The Taylor Act provides that permit
holders may undertake range improvements pursuant to (1)a cooperative agreement with the United States, or (2) a
range improvement permit. 43 U. S. C. $ 315c; see 43 CFR$$ 4120.3-2, 4120.3-3 (1998). The pre-1995 regulations applicable to cooperative agreements gave the United Statesfull title to "nonstructural" improvements, such as spraying
for weeds, and to "non-removable improvements," such aswells. 43 CFR $ 4120.3-2 (1994). But for "structural or removable improvements," such as fencing, stock tanks, or

Opinion of the Court
pipelines, the regulations shared title between the permitholder and the United States "in proportion to the actual

amount of the respective contribution to the initial construc-tion."

Ibid. And for range improvements made pursuant
to permit, the pre-1995 regulations gave the permittee "titleto removable range improvements." $ 4120.3-3(b).

The 1995 regulations change the title rules for range improvements made pursuant to a cooperative agreement, butnot the rules for improvements made pursuant to permit.

For cooperative agreements, they specify that "title to per-manent range improvements" (authorized in the future)
"such as fences, wells, and pipelines . . . shall be in the nameof the United States." 43 CFR $ 4120.3-2(b) (1995).

The ranchers argue that this change violates 43 U. S. C.$ 315c, which says:

"No permit shall be issued which shall entitle the per-mittee to the use of such [range] improvements constructed and owned by a prior occupant until the appli-cant has paid to such prior occupant the reasonable
value of such improvements . . . ." (Emphasis added.)
In their view, the word "owned" foresees ownership by a
"prior occupant" of at least some such improvements, a possi-bility they say is denied by the new rule mandating blanket

Government ownership of permanent range improvements.The Secretary responds that, since the statute gives him
the power to authorize range improvements pursuant to acooperative agreement--a greater power, $ 315c--he also has
the power to set the terms of title ownership to such im-provements--a lesser power--just like any landlord. See
R. Schoshinski, American Law of Landlord and Tenant $ 5:31
(1980) (ownership of tenant improvements is a matter open
to negotiation with landlord); H. Bronson, A Treatise on the
Law of Fixtures $ 40 (1904); 2 J. Taylor, A Treatise on the
American Law of Landlord and Tenant $ 554, pp. 164-166
(1887). Under this reading, the subsequent statutory provi529US3 Unit: $U57 [09-26-01 12:19:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN

concurring
sion relating to "ownership" simply provides for compensa-tion by some future permit holder

in the event that the Secretary decides to grant title.As detailed above, the Secretary did grant ownership

rights to range improvements under certain circumstancesprior to 1995. We see nothing in the statute that prevents
him from changing his mind in respect to the future. And
the Secretary has now changed his mind for reasons of ad-ministrative convenience and because what he takes as the

original purpose of this provision (assuring that, in 1934,ranchers would pay compensation to nomadic sheep herders)
is no longer important. In any event, the provision retainseven the "contemplation of ownership" meaning stressed by
the ranchers, for permit holders may still "own" removablerange improvements, such as "corrals, creep feeders, and
loading chutes, and temporary structural improvements suchas troughs for hauled water," 43 CFR $ 4120.3-3(b) (1995),
which could be transferred to a new permit holder and thuscompel compensation under $ 315f.

In short, we find nothing in the statute that denies the
Secretary authority reasonably to decide when or whetherto grant title to those who make improvements. And any

such person remains free to negotiate the terms upon whichhe will make those improvements irrespective of where title
formally lies, including how he might be compensated in thefuture for the work he had done, either by the Government
directly or by those to whom the Government later grants
a permit. Cf. 43 U. S. C. $ 1752(g) (requiring the United
States to pay compensation to a permittee for his "interest"
in range improvements if it cancels a permit).

First, in Part II-A, the Court holds that the Secretary didnot exceed his authority under the Taylor Grazing Act by

promulgating the new "grazing preference" and "permitteduse" rules. I agree with that holding but would place special emphasis on the Court's third reason for rejecting peti-tioners' facial challenge to the regulations. Petitioners have
not shown how the new regulations themselves--rather than
specific actions the Secretary might take pursuant to thoseregulations--violate the Taylor Grazing Act's requirement

that "grazing privileges recognized and acknowledged . . . beadequately safeguarded." 43 U. S. C. $ 315b. It is of particular importance, as the Court notes, ante, at 743, that theSecretary has assured us that the new regulations do not in
actual practice "alter the active use/suspended use formulain grazing permits" and that " `present suspended use would
continue to be recognized and have a priority for additionalgrazing use within the allotment.' " Brief for Respondents
22 (quoting Bureau of Land Management, Rangeland Reform'94: Final Environmental Impact Statement 144 (1994)).
For these reasons, petitioners' facial challenge to the regulations must fail. Should a permit holder find, however, thatthe Secretary's specific application of the new regulations

deviates from the above assurances and in the process deprives the permit holder of grazing privileges to such an extent that the Secretary's conduct can be termed a failure to
adequately safeguard such privileges, the permit holder may
bring an as-applied challenge to the Secretary's action at
that time. The Court's holding today in no way forecloses
such a challenge. See ante, at 744 ("[T]he affected permit
holder remains free to challenge such an individual [denial
of] grazing privileges, and the courts remain free to determine its lawfulness in context").

Second, it is important to note that the Court's decision
today only rejects petitioners' claim that the 1995 regulations exceed the Secretary's authority under the Taylor
Grazing Act. We are not presented in this case with a claim
under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U. S. C.

$ 706(2)(A), that the Secretary acted arbitrarily and capri-ciously in promulgating the new regulations. Under our decision in Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v.State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463 U. S. 29, 42 (1983),
an agency that departs from its previous rules will be foundto have acted arbitrarily and capriciously if it fails "to supply
a reasoned analysis for the change . . . ." Although peti-tioners pressed precisely such an "arbitrary and capricious"
challenge before the District Court, for whatever reason,they chose not to raise it before this Court. Regardless of
whether the "arbitrary and capricious" claim remains opento these permit holders, the Court's decision does not foreclose such an APA challenge generally by permit holders af-fected by the 1995 regulations.

With these understandings, I join the Court's opinion.

753OCTOBER TERM, 1999
Syllabus

OHLER v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 98-9828. Argued March 20, 2000--Decided May 22, 2000
Petitioner Ohler was tried on drug charges. The Federal District Court

granted the Government's motion in limine to admit her prior felony
drug conviction as impeachment evidence under Federal Rule of Evidence 609(a)(1). Ohler testified at trial and admitted the prior conviction on direct examination. The jury convicted her. In affirming, the
Ninth Circuit rejected her challenge to the District Court's in limine
ruling, holding that she waived her objection by introducing the evidence during her direct examination.

Held: A defendant who pre-emptively introduces evidence of a prior conviction on direct examination may not challenge the admission of such
evidence on appeal. Ohler attempts to avoid the well-established commonsense principle that a party introducing evidence cannot complain
on appeal that the evidence was erroneously admitted by invoking Federal Rules of Evidence 103 and 609. However, neither Rule addresses
the question at issue here. She also argues that applying such a waiver
rule in this situation would compel a defendant to forgo the tactical
advantage of pre-emptively introducing the conviction in order to appeal
the in limine ruling. But both the Government and the defendant in a
criminal trial must make choices as the trial progresses. Ohler's submission would deny to the Government its usual right to choose, after
she testifies, whether or not to use her prior conviction against her.
She seeks to short-circuit that decisional process by offering the conviction herself (and thereby removing the sting) and still preserve its
admission as a claim of error on appeal. But here she runs into the
position taken by the Court in Luce v. United States, 469 U. S. 38, 41,
that any possible harm flowing from a district court's in limine ruling
permitting impeachment by a prior conviction is wholly speculative.
Only when the Government exercises its option to elicit the testimony
is an appellate court confronted with a case where, under normal trial
rules, the defendant can claim the denial of a substantial right if in fact
the district court's in limine ruling proved to be erroneous. Finally,
applying this rule to Ohler's situation does not unconstitutionally burden her right to testify, because the rule does not prevent her from
taking the stand and presenting any admissible testimony she chooses.

briefs was Mario G. Conte.

Barbara McDowell argued the cause for the UnitedStates. With her on the brief were Solicitor General Waxman, Assistant Attorney General Robinson, Deputy Solici-tor General Dreeben, and Jonathan L. Marcus.*

Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of theCourt.
Petitioner, Maria Ohler, was arrested and charged withimportation of marijuana and possession of marijuana with
the intent to distribute. The District Court granted theGovernment's motion

in limine seeking to admit evidenceof her prior felony conviction as impeachment evidence

under Federal Rule of Evidence 609(a)(1). Ohler testifiedat trial and admitted on direct examination that she had
been convicted of possession of methamphetamine in 1993.The jury convicted her of both counts, and the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. We agree with theCourt of Appeals that Ohler may not challenge the

in limineruling of the District Court on appeal.

Maria Ohler drove a van from Mexico to California in July1997. As she passed through the San Ysidro Port of Entry,
a customs inspector noticed that someone had tamperedwith one of the van's interior panels. Inspectors searched
the van and discovered approximately 81 pounds of mari-juana. Ohler was arrested and charged with importation
of marijuana and possession of marijuana with the intent to

Opinion of the Court
distribute. Before trial, the Government filed motions in

limine seeking to admit Ohler's prior felony conviction as
character evidence under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b)and as impeachment evidence under Rule 609(a)(1). The

District Court denied the motion to admit the convictionas character evidence, but reserved ruling on whether the
conviction could be used for impeachment purposes. On the
first day of trial, the District Court ruled that if Ohler tes-tified, evidence of her prior conviction would be admissible

under Rule 609(a)(1). App. 97-98. She testified in her owndefense, denying any knowledge of the marijuana. She also
admitted on direct examination that she had been convicted of possession of methamphetamine in 1993. The jury
found Ohler guilty of both counts, and she was sentenced
to 30 months in prison and 3 years' supervised release. Id.,
at 140-141.

On appeal, Ohler challenged the District Court's in limine
ruling allowing the Government to use her prior conviction
for impeachment purposes. The Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that Ohler waived her objection by introducing evidence of the conviction during
her direct examination. 169 F. 3d 1200 (1999). We granted
certiorari to resolve a conflict among the Circuits regarding
whether appellate review of an in limine ruling is available
in this situation. 528 U. S. 950 (1999). See United States v.
Fisher, 106 F. 3d 622 (CA5 1997) (allowing review); United
States v. Smiley, 997 F. 2d 475 (CA8 1993) (holding objection
waived). We affirm.

Generally, a party introducing evidence cannot complain
on appeal that the evidence was erroneously admitted. See

756 OHLER v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
this well-established commonsense principle by invoking
Rules 103 and 609 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. But
neither of these Rules addresses the question at issue here.
Rule 103 sets forth the unremarkable propositions that a
party must make a timely objection to a ruling admitting
evidence and that a party cannot challenge an evidentiary
ruling unless it affects a substantial right.1 The Rule does
not purport to determine when a party waives a prior objection, and it is silent with respect to the effect of introducing evidence on direct examination, and later assigning
its admission as error on appeal.

Rule 609(a) is equally unavailing for Ohler; it merely
identifies the situations in which a witness' prior conviction may be admitted for impeachment purposes.2 The Rule
originally provided that admissible prior conviction evidence could be elicited from the defendant or established by
public record during cross-examination, but it was amended
in 1990 to clarify that the evidence could also be introduced
on direct examination. According to Ohler, it follows from
this amendment that a party does not waive her objection
to the in limine ruling by introducing the evidence herself.
However, like Rule 103, Rule 609(a) simply does not address
this issue. There is no question that the Rule authorizes

1 Federal Rule of Evidence 103(a): "Error may not be predicated upon a
ruling which admits or excludes evidence unless a substantial right of the
party is affected, and

"(1) . . . In case the ruling is one admitting evidence, a timely objection
or motion to strike appears of record, stating the specific ground of objection, if the specific ground was not apparent from the context . . . ."

2 Rule 609(a): "For the purpose of attacking the credibility of a witness,

(1) evidence that a witness other than an accused has been convicted of a
crime shall be admitted, subject to Rule 403, if the crime was punishable
by death or imprisonment in excess of one year under the law under which
the witness was convicted, and evidence that an accused has been convicted of such a crime shall be admitted if the court determines that the
probative value of admitting this evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect
to the accused . . . ."

757Cite as: 529 U. S. 753 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
the eliciting of a prior conviction on direct examination, butit does no more than that.

Next, Ohler argues that it would be unfair to apply sucha waiver rule in this situation because it compels a defendant to forgo the tactical advantage of pre-emptively introduc-ing the conviction in order to appeal the

in limine ruling.
She argues that if a defendant is forced to wait for evidence
of the conviction to be introduced on cross-examination, thejury will believe that the defendant is less credible because

she was trying to conceal the conviction. The Governmentdisputes that the defendant is unduly disadvantaged by waiting for the prosecution to introduce the conviction on crossexamination. First, the Government argues that it is debatable whether jurors actually perceive a defendant to be
more credible if she introduces a conviction herself. Brief
for United States 28. Second, even if jurors do consider the
defendant more credible, the Government suggests that it is
an unwarranted advantage because the jury does not realize
that the defendant disclosed the conviction only after failing
to persuade the court to exclude it. Ibid.

Whatever the merits of these contentions, they tend to
obscure the fact that both the Government and the defendant
in a criminal trial must make choices as the trial progresses.
For example, the defendant must decide whether or not to
take the stand in her own behalf. If she has an innocent
or mitigating explanation for evidence that might otherwise incriminate, acquittal may be more likely if she takes
the stand. Here, for example, Ohler testified that she had
no knowledge of the marijuana discovered in the van, that
the van had been taken to Mexico without her permission, and that she had gone there simply to retrieve the van.
But once the defendant testifies, she is subject to crossexamination, including impeachment by prior convictions,
and the decision to take the stand may prove damaging instead of helpful. A defendant has a further choice to make
if she decides to testify, notwithstanding a prior conviction.

529US3 Unit: $U58 [09-26-01 12:26:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN
758 OHLER v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
The defendant must choose whether to introduce the conviction on direct examination and remove the sting or to
take her chances with the prosecutor's possible elicitation of
the conviction on cross-examination.

The Government, too, in a case such as this, must make
a choice. If the defendant testifies, it must choose whether
or not to impeach her by use of her prior conviction. Here
the trial judge had indicated he would allow its use,3 but
the Government still had to consider whether its use might
be deemed reversible error on appeal. This choice is often
based on the Government's appraisal of the apparent effect
of the defendant's testimony. If she has offered a plausible,
innocent explanation of the evidence against her, it will be
inclined to use the prior conviction; if not, it may decide
not to risk possible reversal on appeal from its use.

Due to the structure of trial, the Government has one
inherent advantage in these competing trial strategies.
Cross-examination comes after direct examination, and
therefore the Government need not make its choice until
the defendant has elected whether or not to take the stand
in her own behalf and after the Government has heard the
defendant testify.

Ohler's submission would deny to the Government its
usual right to decide, after she testifies, whether or not to
use her prior conviction against her. She seeks to short
circuit that decisional process by offering the conviction herself (and thereby removing the sting) and still preserve its
admission as a claim of error on appeal.

3 The District Court ruled on the first day of trial that Ohler's prior
conviction would be admissible for impeachment purposes, and the court
likely would have abided by that ruling at trial. However, in limine
rulings are not binding on the trial judge, and the judge may always
change his mind during the course of a trial. See Luce v. United States,
469 U. S. 38, 41-42 (1984). Ohler's position, therefore, would deprive the
trial court of the opportunity to change its mind after hearing all of the
defendant's testimony.

Opinion of the Court
But here Ohler runs into the position taken by the Courtin a similar, but not identical, situation in Luce v. United

States, 469 U. S. 38 (1984), that "[a]ny possible harm flowingfrom a district court's in limine ruling permitting impeachment by a prior conviction is wholly speculative." Id., at 41.Only when the Government exercises its option to elicit the
testimony is an appellate court confronted with a case where,under the normal rules of trial, the defendant can claim the
denial of a substantial right if in fact the district court's
in limine ruling proved to be erroneous. In our view, thereis nothing "unfair," as Ohler puts it, about putting her to her

choice in accordance with the normal rules of trial.Finally, Ohler argues that applying this rule to her situation unconstitutionally burdens her right to testify. She re-lies on Rock v. Arkansas, 483 U. S. 44 (1987), where we held
that a prohibition of hypnotically refreshed testimony in-terfered with the defendant's right to testify. But here the
rule in question does not prevent Ohler from taking thestand and presenting any admissible testimony which she
chooses. She is of course subject to cross-examination andsubject to impeachment by the use of a prior conviction. In
a sense, the use of these tactics by the Government maydeter a defendant from taking the stand. But, as we said in
McGautha v. California, 402 U. S. 183, 215 (1971):

"It has long been held that a defendant who takes thestand in his own behalf cannot then claim the privilege

against cross-examination on matters reasonably relatedto the subject matter of his direct examination. . . . It is
not thought overly harsh in such situations to requirethat the determination whether to waive the privilege
take into account the matters which may be brought outon cross-examination. It is also generally recognized
that a defendant who takes the stand in his own behalfmay be impeached by proof of prior convictions or the
like. . . . Again, it is not thought inconsistent with theenlightened administration of criminal justice to require

Souter, J., dissenting
the defendant to weigh such pros and cons in decidingwhether to testify."

For these reasons, we conclude that a defendant who pre-emptively introduces evidence of a prior conviction on direct examination may not on appeal claim that the admissionof such evidence was error.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the NinthCircuit is therefore affirmed.

It is so ordered.
Justice Souter, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice
Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.

The majority holds that a testifying defendant perforcewaives the right to appeal an adverse

in limine ruling ad-mitting prior convictions for impeachment. The holding is

without support in precedent, the rules of evidence, or thereasonable objectives of trial, and I respectfully dissent.

The only case of this Court that the majority claims aseven tangential support for its waiver rule is Luce v. United
States, 469 U. S. 38 (1984). Ante, at 759. We held therethat a criminal defendant who remained off the stand could
not appeal an in limine ruling to admit prior convictionsas impeachment evidence under Federal Rule of Evidence
609(a). Since the defendant had not testified, he had neversuffered the impeachment, and the question was whether he
should be allowed to appeal the in limine ruling anyway, onthe rationale that the threatened impeachment had discouraged the exercise of his right to defend by his own testimony.The answer turned on the practical realities of appellate
review.An appellate court can neither determine why a defendant
refused to testify, nor compare the actual trial with the onethat would have occurred if the accused had taken the stand.
With unavoidable uncertainty about whether and how muchthe

in limine ruling harmed the defendant, and whetherit affected the trial at all, a rule allowing a silent defend529US3 Unit: $U58 [09-26-01 12:26:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Souter, J., dissenting
ant to appeal would require courts either to attempt whollyspeculative harmless-error analysis, or to grant new trials to

some defendants who were not harmed by the ruling, andto some who never even intended to testify. In requiring
testimony and actual impeachment before a defendant couldappeal an in limine ruling to admit prior convictions, therefore, Luce did not derive a waiver rule from some generalnotion of fairness; it merely acknowledged the incapacity
of an appellate court to assess the significance of the rulingfor a defendant who remains silent.

This case is different, there being a factual record on whichOhler's claim can be reviewed. She testified, and there is
no question that the in limine ruling controlled her counsel'sdecision to enquire about the earlier conviction; defense lawyers do not set out to impeach their own witnesses, muchless their clients. Since analysis for harmless error is made
no more difficult by the fact that the convictions came outon direct examination, not cross-examination, the case raises
none of the practical difficulties on which Luce turned, andLuce does not dictate today's result.

1

In fact, the majority's principal reliance is not on prece-dent but on the "commonsense" rule that "a party introducing evidence cannot complain on appeal that the evi1 The Luce Court anticipated as much: "It is clear, of course, that had
petitioner testified and been impeached by evidence of a prior conviction, the District Court's decision to admit the impeachment evidence
would have been reviewable on appeal along with any other claims of
error. The Court of Appeals would then have had a complete record
detailing the nature of petitioner's testimony, the scope of the crossexamination, and the possible impact of the impeachment on the jury's
verdict." 469 U. S., at 41. There are, of course, practical issues that
may arise in these cases; for example, the trial court may feel unable to
render a final and definitive in limine ruling. The majority does not
focus on these potential difficulties, and neither do I, though some lower
courts have addressed them. See, e. g., Wilson v. Williams, 182 F. 3d 562
(CA7 1999) (en banc). For the purposes of this case, we need consider
only the circumstance in which a district court makes a ruling that is
plainly final.

dence was erroneously admitted." Ante, at 755. But thisis no more support for today's holding than

Luce is, for the
common sense that approves the rule also limits its reach toa point well short of this case. The general rule makes

sense, first, when a party who has freely chosen to introduceevidence of a particular fact later sees his opponent's evidence of the same fact erroneously admitted. He suffers no
prejudice. See Mercer v. Theriot, 377 U. S. 152, 154 (1964)
(per curiam); 21 C. Wright & K. Graham, Federal Practice
and Procedure $ 5039, p. 203 (1977). The rule makes sense,second, when the objecting party takes inconsistent positions, first requesting admission and then assigning error
to the admission of precisely the same evidence at his opponent's behest. "The party should not be permitted `to
blow hot and cold' in this way." 1 J. Strong, McCormick on
Evidence $ 55, p. 246, n. 14 (5th ed. 1999).

Neither of these reasons applies when (as here) the defendant has opposed admission of the evidence and introduced it herself only to mitigate its effect in the hands of her
adversary. Such a case falls beyond the scope of the general
principle, and the scholarship almost uniformly treats it as
exceptional. See, e. g., 1 J. Wigmore, Evidence $ 18, p. 836
(P. Tillers rev. 1983) ("[A] party who has made an unsuccessful motion in limine to exclude evidence that he expects
the proponent to offer may be able to first offer that same
evidence without waiving his claim of error"); M. Graham,
Handbook of Federal Evidence $ 103.4, p. 17 (1981) ("However, the party may . . . himself bring out evidence ruled
admissible over his objection to minimize its effect without
it constituting a waiver of his objection"); 1 McCormick,
supra, $ 55, at 246 ("[W]hen [a party's] objection is made
and overruled, he is entitled to treat this ruling as the `law
of the trial' and to explain or rebut, if he can, the evidence
admitted over his protest"); D. Louisell & C. Mueller, Federal Evidence $ 11, p. 65 (1977) ("Having done his best by
objecting, the adversary would be indeed ill treated if then

Souter, J., dissenting
he was held to have thrown it all away by doing his best toprotect his position by offering evidence of his own").

2 The

general thrust of the law of evidence, then, not only fails tosupport the majority's approach, but points rather clearly in

the other direction.With neither precedent nor principle to support its chosen
rule, the majority is reduced to saying that "there is noth-ing `unfair' . . . about putting petitioner to her choice in
accordance with the normal rules of trial." 3 Ante, at 759.Things are not this simple, however.

Any claim of a new rule's fairness under normal trial con-ditions will have to stand or fall on how well the rule would
serve the objects that trials in general, and the Rules of Evi-dence in particular, are designed to achieve. Thus the provisions of Federal Rule of Evidence 102, that "[t]hese rulesshall be construed to secure fairness in administration, elimination of unjustifiable expense and delay, and promotion ofgrowth and development of the law of evidence to the end
that the truth may be ascertained and proceedings justlydetermined." A judge's job, accordingly, is to curb the tactics of the trial battle in favor of weighing evidence calmlyand getting to the most sensible understanding of whatever
gave rise to the controversy before the court. The questionis not which side gains a tactical advantage, but which rule
assists in uncovering the truth. Today's new rule can makeno such claim.

2 The point on which the analysis of the cited treatises turns, it should
be clear, is not which party first introduces the evidence, but rather which
party seeks introduction and which exclusion. A defense lawyer who
elicits testimony about prior convictions on direct examination, having
failed in an attempt to have them excluded, is plainly making a defensive
use of the convictions; he has no desire to impeach his client. The fact
that it is the defense lawyer who first introduces the convictions, then, is
irrelevant to the principle the majority invokes.

3 For the reasons just given, this begs the question, which is whether

the "normal rules of trial" apply beyond the normal circumstances for
which they were devised.

764 OHLER v. UNITED STATES

Souter, J., dissenting
Previously convicted witnesses may testify honestly, butsome convictions raise more than the ordinary question

about the witness's readiness to speak truthfully. A fact-finder who appreciates a heightened possibility of perjury
will respond with heightened scrutiny, and when a defend-ant discloses prior convictions at the outset of her testimony,
the jury will bear those convictions in mind as she testifies,and will scrutinize what she says more carefully. The purpose of Rule 609, in making some convictions admissible toimpeach a witness's credibility, is thus fully served by a defendant's own testimony that the convictions occurred.It is true that when convictions are revealed only on
cross-examination, the revelation also warns the factfinder,but the timing of their disclosure may do more. The jury
may feel that in testifying without saying anything aboutthe convictions the defendant has meant to conceal them.
The jury's assessment of the defendant's testimony may beaffected not only by knowing that she has committed crimes
in the past, but by blaming her for not being forthcomingwhen she seemingly could have been. Creating such an
impression of current deceit by concealment is very muchat odds with any purpose behind Rule 609, being obviously
antithetical to dispassionate factfinding in support of a soundconclusion. The chance to create that impression is a tactical advantage for the Government, but only in the majority'sdismissive sense of the term; it may affect the outcome of
the trial, but only if it disserves the search for truth.Allowing the defendant to introduce the convictions on
direct examination thus tends to promote fairness of trialwithout depriving the Government of anything to which it
is entitled. There is no reason to discourage the defendantfrom introducing the conviction herself, as the majority's
waiver rule necessarily does.

VERMONT AGENCY OF NATURAL RESOURCES v.UNITED STATES

ex rel. STEVENS

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe second circuit

No. 98-1828. Argued November 29, 1999--Decided May 22, 2000
Under the False Claims Act (FCA), a private person (the relator) may

bring a qui tam civil action "in the name of the [Federal] Government,"
31 U. S. C. $ 3730(b)(1), against "[a]ny person" who, inter alia, "knowingly presents . . . to . . . the . . . Government . . . a false or fraudulent
claim for payment," $ 3729(a). The relator receives a share of any proceeds from the action. $$ 3730(d)(1)-(2). Respondent Stevens brought
such an action against petitioner state agency, alleging that it had
submitted false claims to the Environmental Protection Agency in connection with federal grant programs the EPA administered. Petitioner
moved to dismiss, arguing that a State (or state agency) is not a "person" subject to FCA liability and that a qui tam action in federal court
against a State is barred by the Eleventh Amendment. The District
Court denied the motion, and petitioner filed an interlocutory appeal.
Respondent United States intervened in the appeal in support of respondent Stevens. The Second Circuit affirmed.

Held: A private individual may not bring suit in federal court on behalf

of the United States against a State (or state agency) under the FCA.
Pp. 771-788.

(a) A private individual has standing to bring suit in federal court
on behalf of the United States under the FCA. Stevens meets the requirements necessary to establish Article III standing. In particular,
he has demonstrated "injury in fact"--a harm that is both "concrete"
and "actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical." Whitmore
v. Arkansas, 495 U. S. 149, 155. He contends he is suing to remedy
injury in fact suffered by the United States--both the injury to its
sovereignty arising from violation of its laws and the proprietary injury resulting from the alleged fraud. The concrete private interest
that Stevens has in the outcome of his suit, in the form of the bounty
he will receive if the suit is successful, is insufficient to confer standing, since that interest does not consist of obtaining compensation for,
or preventing, the violation of a legally protected right. An adequate
basis for Stevens' standing, however, is found in the doctrine that the
assignee of a claim has standing to assert the injury in fact suffered by
the assignor. Because the FCA can reasonably be regarded as effect529US3 Unit: $U59 [09-26-01 12:32:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN
766 VERMONT AGENCY OF NATURAL RESOURCES v.

UNITED STATES ex rel. STEVENS

Syllabus

ing a partial assignment of the Government's damages claim, the United
States' injury in fact suffices to confer standing on Stevens. This conclusion is confirmed by the long tradition of qui tam actions in England
and the American Colonies, which conclusively demonstrates that such
actions were "cases and controversies of the sort traditionally amenable to, and resolved by, the judicial process." Steel Co. v. Citizens for
Better Environment, 523 U. S. 83, 102. Pp. 771-778.

(b) The FCA does not subject a State (or state agency) to liability in
a federal-court suit by a private individual on behalf of the United
States. Such a State or agency is not a "person" subject to qui tam
liability under $ 3729(a). The Court's longstanding interpretive presumption that "person" does not include the sovereign applies to the
text of $ 3729(a). Although not a hard and fast rule of exclusion, the
presumption may be disregarded only upon some affirmative showing
of statutory intent to the contrary. As the historical context makes
clear, various features of the FCA, both as originally enacted and as
amended, far from providing the requisite affirmative indications that
the term "person" included States for purposes of qui tam liability, indicate quite the contrary. This conclusion is buttressed by the ordinary rule of statutory construction that if Congress intends to alter
the usual constitutional balance between States and the Federal Government, it must make its intention to do so unmistakably clear in the
statute's language, and by the doctrine that statutes should be construed so as to avoid difficult constitutional questions. The Court expresses no view as to whether an action in federal court by a qui tam
relator against a State would run afoul of the Eleventh Amendment,
but notes that there is "a serious doubt" on that score. Ashwander v.

officer or employee of the United States Government . . . afalse or fraudulent claim for payment or approval." 31
U. S. C. $ 3729(a). The defendant is liable for up to trebledamages and a civil penalty of up to $10,000 per claim. Ibid.
An FCA action may be commenced in one of two ways.First, the Government itself may bring a civil action against
the alleged false claimant. $ 3730(a). Second, as is relevanthere, a private person (the relator) may bring a

qui tam civilaction "for the person and for the United States Government" against the alleged false claimant, "in the name ofthe Government." $ 3730(b)(1).

If a relator initiates the FCA action, he must deliver acopy of the complaint, and any supporting evidence, to the
Government, $ 3730(b)(2), which then has 60 days to in-tervene in the action, $$ 3730(b)(2), (4). If it does so, it
assumes primary responsibility for prosecuting the action,$ 3730(c)(1), though the relator may continue to participate
in the litigation and is entitled to a hearing before voluntarydismissal and to a court determination of reasonableness
before settlement, $ 3730(c)(2). If the Government declinesto intervene within the 60-day period, the relator has the
exclusive right to conduct the action, $ 3730(b)(4), and theGovernment may subsequently intervene only on a showing
of "good cause," $ 3730(c)(3). The relator receives a shareof any proceeds from the action--generally ranging from 15

share of recovery against a person contracting with Indians in an unlawful

to 25 percent if the Government intervenes (depending upon
the relator's contribution to the prosecution), and from 25
to 30 percent if it does not (depending upon the court's
assessment of what is reasonable)--plus attorney's fees and
costs. $$ 3730(d)(1)-(2).

Respondent Jonathan Stevens brought this qui tam action in the United States District Court for the District
of Vermont against petitioner Vermont Agency of Natural
Resources, his former employer, alleging that it had submitted false claims to the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) in connection with various federal grant programs
administered by the EPA. Specifically, he claimed that petitioner had overstated the amount of time spent by its employees on the federally funded projects, thereby inducing
the Government to disburse more grant money than petitioner was entitled to receive. The United States declined
to intervene in the action. Petitioner then moved to dismiss, arguing that a State (or state agency) is not a "person"
subject to liability under the FCA and that a qui tam action
in federal court against a State is barred by the Eleventh
Amendment. The District Court denied the motion in an
unpublished order. App. to Pet. for Cert. 86-87. Petitioner then filed an interlocutory appeal,2 and the District
Court stayed proceedings pending its outcome. Respondent
United States intervened in the appeal in support of respondent Stevens. A divided panel of the Second Circuit
affirmed, 162 F. 3d 195 (1998), and we granted certiorari,
527 U. S. 1034 (1999).

2 The denial of a motion to dismiss based on a claim of Eleventh Amendment immunity is immediately appealable. See Puerto Rico Aqueduct
and Sewer Authority v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., 506 U. S. 139 (1993). The
Second Circuit exercised pendent appellate jurisdiction over the statutory
question. See Swint v. Chambers County Comm'n, 514 U. S. 35, 50-51
(1995).

Opinion of the Court

II
We first address the jurisdictional question whether re-spondent Stevens has standing under Article III of the Constitution to maintain this suit. See Steel Co. v. Citizens for
Better Environment, 523 U. S. 83, 93-102 (1998).As we have frequently explained, a plaintiff must meet

three requirements in order to establish Article III standing.See, e. g., Friends of Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental
Services (TOC), Inc., 528 U. S. 167, 180-181 (2000). First,he must demonstrate "injury in fact"--a harm that is both
"concrete" and "actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypo-thetical."

Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U. S. 149, 155 (1990)(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Second, he

must establish causation--a "fairly . . . trace[able]" connec-tion between the alleged injury in fact and the alleged
conduct of the defendant. Simon v. Eastern Ky. WelfareRights Organization, 426 U. S. 26, 41 (1976). And third, he
must demonstrate redressability--a "substantial likelihood"that the requested relief will remedy the alleged injury in
fact. Id., at 45. These requirements together constitutethe "irreducible constitutional minimum" of standing, Lujan
v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560 (1992), which isan "essential and unchanging part" of Article III's case-orcontroversy requirement, ibid., and a key factor in dividingthe power of government between the courts and the two
political branches, see id., at 559-560.

Respondent Stevens contends that he is suing to remedyan injury in fact suffered by the United States. It is beyond

doubt that the complaint asserts an injury to the UnitedStates--both the injury to its sovereignty arising from violation of its laws (which suffices to support a criminal law-suit by the Government) and the proprietary injury resulting
from the alleged fraud. But "[t]he Art. III judicial powerexists only to redress or otherwise to protect against injury
to the complaining party." Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490,

Opinion of the Court

499 (1975) (emphasis added); see also Sierra Club v. Morton,
405 U. S. 727, 734-735 (1972). It would perhaps suffice to
say that the relator here is simply the statutorily designated
agent of the United States, in whose name (as the statute
provides, see 31 U. S. C. $ 3730(b)) the suit is brought--and
that the relator's bounty is simply the fee he receives out
of the United States' recovery for filing and/or prosecuting a
successful action on behalf of the Government. This analysis is precluded, however, by the fact that the statute gives
the relator himself an interest in the lawsuit, and not merely
the right to retain a fee out of the recovery. Thus, it provides that "[a] person may bring a civil action for a violation of section 3729 for the person and for the United States
Government," $ 3730(b) (emphasis added); gives the relator
"the right to continue as a party to the action" even when
the Government itself has assumed "primary responsibility"
for prosecuting it, $ 3730(c)(1); entitles the relator to a hearing before the Government's voluntary dismissal of the suit,

$ 3730(c)(2)(A); and prohibits the Government from settling
the suit over the relator's objection without a judicial determination of "fair[ness], adequa[cy] and reasonable[ness],"

$ 3730(c)(2)(B). For the portion of the recovery retained by
the relator, therefore, some explanation of standing other
than agency for the Government must be identified.

There is no doubt, of course, that as to this portion of the
recovery--the bounty he will receive if the suit is successful--a qui tam relator has a "concrete private interest in
the outcome of [the] suit." Lujan, supra, at 573. But the
same might be said of someone who has placed a wager upon
the outcome. An interest unrelated to injury in fact is insufficient to give a plaintiff standing. See Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church
and State, Inc., 454 U. S. 464, 486 (1982); Sierra Club, supra,
at 734-735. The interest must consist of obtaining compensation for, or preventing, the violation of a legally pro529US3 Unit: $U59 [09-26-01 12:32:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
tected right. See Lujan, supra, at 560-561. A qui tam relator has suffered no such invasion--indeed, the "right" he
seeks to vindicate does not even fully materialize until the
litigation is completed and the relator prevails.3 This is not
to suggest that Congress cannot define new legal rights,
which in turn will confer standing to vindicate an injury
caused to the claimant. See Warth, supra, at 500. As we
have held in another context, however, an interest that is
merely a "byproduct" of the suit itself cannot give rise to a
cognizable injury in fact for Article III standing purposes.
See Steel Co., supra, at 107 ("[A] plaintiff cannot achieve
standing to litigate a substantive issue by bringing suit for
the cost of bringing suit"); see also Diamond v. Charles, 476
U. S. 54, 69-71 (1986) (holding that assessment of attorney's
fees against a party does not confer standing to pursue the
action on appeal).

We believe, however, that adequate basis for the relator's
suit for his bounty is to be found in the doctrine that the
assignee of a claim has standing to assert the injury in fact
suffered by the assignor. The FCA can reasonably be regarded as effecting a partial assignment of the Government's damages claim.4 Although we have never expressly
recognized "representational standing" on the part of assignees, we have routinely entertained their suits, see, e. g.,

3 Blackstone noted, with regard to English qui tam actions, that "no
particular person, A or B, has any right, claim or demand, in or upon
[the bounty], till after action brought," and that the bounty constituted an
"inchoate imperfect degree of property . . . [which] is not consummated
till judgment." 2 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *437.

4 In addressing the Eleventh Amendment issue that we leave open

today, the dissent suggests that we are asserting that a qui tam relator
"is, in effect, suing as an assignee of the United States." Post, at 802
(opinion of Stevens, J.); see also post, at 796 (same). More precisely, we
are asserting that a qui tam relator is, in effect, suing as a partial assignee
of the United States.

Musick, Peeler & Garrett v. Employers Ins. of Wausau,
508 U. S. 286, 288 (1993). We conclude, therefore, that the
United States' injury in fact suffices to confer standing on
respondent Stevens.

We are confirmed in this conclusion by the long tradition
of qui tam actions in England and the American Colonies.
That history is particularly relevant to the constitutional
standing inquiry since, as we have said elsewhere, Article
III's restriction of the judicial power to "Cases" and "Controversies" is properly understood to mean "cases and controversies of the sort traditionally amenable to, and resolved
by, the judicial process." Steel Co., 523 U. S., at 102; see
also Coleman v. Miller, 307 U. S. 433, 460 (1939) (opinion of
Frankfurter, J.) (the Constitution established that "[ j]udicial power could come into play only in matters that were
the traditional concern of the courts at Westminster and
only if they arose in ways that to the expert feel of lawyers
constituted `Cases' or `Controversies' ").

Qui tam actions appear to have originated around the
end of the 13th century, when private individuals who had
suffered injury began bringing actions in the royal courts
on both their own and the Crown's behalf. See, e. g., Prior
of Lewes v. De Holt (1300), reprinted in 48 Selden Society 198 (1931). Suit in this dual capacity was a device for
getting their private claims into the respected royal courts,
which generally entertained only matters involving the
Crown's interests. See Milsom, Trespass from Henry III to
Edward III, Part III: More Special Writs and Conclusions,

Opinion of the Court
74 L. Q. Rev. 561, 585 (1958). Starting in the 14th century,
as the royal courts began to extend jurisdiction to suits involving wholly private wrongs, the common-law qui tam action gradually fell into disuse, although it seems to have
remained technically available for several centuries. See 2
W. Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown 369 (8th ed. 1824).

At about the same time, however, Parliament began enacting statutes that explicitly provided for qui tam suits.
These were of two types: those that allowed injured parties
to sue in vindication of their own interests (as well as the
Crown's), see, e. g., Statute Providing a Remedy for Him
Who Is Wrongfully Pursued in the Court of Admiralty, 2
Hen. IV, ch. 11 (1400), and--more relevant here--those that
allowed informers to obtain a portion of the penalty as a
bounty for their information, even if they had not suffered
an injury themselves, see, e. g., Statute Prohibiting the Sale
of Wares After the Close of Fair, 5 Edw. III, ch. 5 (1331); see
generally Common Informers Act, 14 & 15 Geo. VI, ch. 39,
sched. (1951) (listing informer statutes). Most, though not
all, of the informer statutes expressly gave the informer a
cause of action, typically by bill, plaint, information, or action
of debt. See, e. g., Bill for Leases of Hospitals, Colleges, and
Other Corporations, 33 Hen. VIII, ch. 27 (1541); Act to Avoid
Horse-Stealing, 31 Eliz. I, ch. 12, $ 2 (1589); Act to Prevent
the Over-Charge of the People by Stewards of Court-Leets
and Court-Barons, 2 Jac. I, ch. 5 (1604).

For obvious reasons, the informer statutes were highly
subject to abuse, see M. Davies, The Enforcement of English
Apprenticeship 58-61 (1956)--particularly those relating to
obsolete offenses, see generally 3 E. Coke, Institutes of the
Laws of England 191 (4th ed. 1797) (informer prosecutions
under obsolete statutes had been used to "vex and entangle
the subject"). Thus, many of the old enactments were repealed, see Act for Continuing and Reviving of Divers Statutes and Repeal of Divers Others, 21 Jac. I, ch. 28, $ 11

(1623), and statutes were passed deterring and penalizing
vexatious informers, limiting the locations in which informer
suits could be brought, and subjecting such suits to relatively
short statutes of limitation, see Act to Redress Disorders in
Common Informers, 18 Eliz. I, ch. 5 (1576); Act Concerning
Informers, 31 Eliz. I, ch. 5 (1589); see generally Davies,
supra, at 63-76. Nevertheless, laws allowing qui tam suits
by informers continued to exist in England until 1951, when
all of the remaining ones were repealed. See Note, The History and Development of Qui Tam, 1972 Wash. U. L. Q. 81,
88, and n. 44 (citing Common Informers Act, 14 & 15 Geo. VI,
ch. 39 (1951)).

Qui tam actions appear to have been as prevalent in
America as in England, at least in the period immediately
before and after the framing of the Constitution. Although
there is no evidence that the Colonies allowed commonlaw qui tam actions (which, as we have noted, were dying
out in England by that time), they did pass several informer statutes expressly authorizing qui tam suits. See,
e. g., Act for the Restraining and Punishing of Privateers
and Pirates, 1st Assembly, 4th Sess. (N. Y. 1692), reprinted
in 1 Colonial Laws of New York 279, 281 (1894) (allowing
informers to sue for, and receive share of, fine imposed
upon officers who neglect their duty to pursue privateers
and pirates). Moreover, immediately after the framing, the
First Congress enacted a considerable number of informer
statutes.5 Like their English counterparts, some of them

5 In addition, the First Congress passed one statute allowing injured
parties to sue for damages on both their own and the United States'
behalf. See Act of May 31, 1790, ch. 15, $ 2, 1 Stat. 124-125 (allowing
author or proprietor to sue for and receive half of penalty for violation
of copyright); cf. Act of Mar. 1, 1790, ch. 2, $ 6, 1 Stat. 103 (allowing census taker to sue for and receive half of penalty for failure to cooperate

Opinion of the Court

U. S., at 102. When combined with the theoretical justifi-cation for relator standing discussed earlier, it leaves no

room for doubt that a qui tam relator under the FCA hasArticle III standing.

8 We turn, then, to the merits.

III
Petitioner makes two contentions: (1) that a State (or stateagency) is not a "person" subject to qui tam liability under

the FCA; and (2) that if it is, the Eleventh Amendment barssuch a suit. The Courts of Appeals have disagreed as to
the order in which these statutory and Eleventh Amendmentimmunity questions should be addressed. Compare

UnitedStates ex rel. Long v. SCS Business & Technical Institute,

Inc., 173 F. 3d 890, 893-898 (CADC 1999) (statutory questionfirst), with United States ex rel. Foulds v. Texas Tech Univ.,
171 F. 3d 279, 285-288 (CA5 1999) (Eleventh Amendmentimmunity question first).

Questions of jurisdiction, of course, should be given pri-ority--since if there is no jurisdiction there is no authority
to sit in judgment of anything else. See Steel Co., supra,at 93-102. "Jurisdiction is power to declare the law, and
when it ceases to exist, the only function remaining tothe court is that of announcing the fact and dismissing the

8 In so concluding, we express no view on the question whether qui tam
suits violate Article II, in particular the Appointments Clause of $ 2 and
the "take Care" Clause of $ 3. Petitioner does not challenge the qui tam
mechanism under either of those provisions, nor is the validity of qui tam
suits under those provisions a jurisdictional issue that we must resolve
here. See Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, 523 U. S. 83, 102,
n. 4 (1998) ("[O]ur standing jurisprudence, . . . though it may sometimes
have an impact on Presidential powers, derives from Article III and not
Article II"); see also Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 576-
578 (1992).

The dissent implicitly attacks us for "introduc[ing] [this question] sua
sponte." Post, at 801. We raise the question, however, only to make
clear that it is not at issue in this case. It is only the dissent that proceeds
to volunteer an answer. See post, at 801-802.

cause." Ex parte McCardle, 7 Wall. 506, 514 (1869). Evenjurisdiction over the person (as opposed to subject-matter

jurisdiction) "is `an essential element of the jurisdictionof a district . . . court,' without which the court is `powerless
to proceed to an adjudication.' " Ruhrgas AG v. Marathon
Oil Co., 526 U. S. 574, 584 (1999) (quoting Employers Reinsurance Corp. v. Bryant, 299 U. S. 374, 382 (1937)).

We nonetheless have routinely addressed before the ques-tion whether the Eleventh Amendment forbids a particular

statutory cause of action to be asserted against States, thequestion whether the statute itself

permits the cause of action it creates to be asserted against States (which it can do
only by clearly expressing such an intent). See, e. g., Kimel
v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 528 U. S. 62, 73-78 (2000); Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44, 55-57 (1996);
cf. Hafer v. Melo, 502 U. S. 21, 25-31 (1991); Mt. Healthy City
Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle, 429 U. S. 274, 277-281 (1977). When
these two questions are at issue, not only is the statutory
question "logically antecedent to the existence of " the Eleventh Amendment question, Amchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U. S. 591, 612 (1997), but also there is no realistic
possibility that addressing the statutory question will expand the Court's power beyond the limits that the jurisdictional restriction has imposed. The question whether the
statute provides for suits against the States (as opposed, for
example, to the broader question whether the statute creates
any private cause of action whatever, or the question
whether the facts alleged make out a "false claim" under the
statute) does not, as a practical matter, permit the court to
pronounce upon any issue, or upon the rights of any person,
beyond the issues and persons that would be reached under
the Eleventh Amendment inquiry anyway. The ultimate
issue in the statutory inquiry is whether States can be sued
under this statute; and the ultimate issue in the Eleventh
Amendment inquiry is whether unconsenting States can be
sued under this statute. This combination of logical priority

and virtual coincidence of scope makes it possible, and indeedappropriate, to decide the statutory issue first. We therefore begin (and will end) with the statutory question.The relevant provision of the FCA, 31 U. S. C. $ 3729(a),
subjects to liability "[a]ny person" who, inter alia, "know-ingly presents, or causes to be presented, to an officer or
employee of the United States Government . . . a falseor fraudulent claim for payment or approval." We must
apply to this text our longstanding interpretive presumptionthat "person" does not include the sovereign. See

UnitedStates v. Cooper Corp., 312 U. S. 600, 604 (1941); United

States v. Mine Workers, 330 U. S. 258, 275 (1947).9 The

9 The dissent claims that, "[a]lthough general statutory references to
`persons' are not normally construed to apply to the enacting sovereign, when Congress uses that word in federal statutes enforceable by the
Federal Government or by a federal agency, it applies to States and state
agencies as well as to private individuals and corporations." Post, at 790
(citation omitted). The dissent cites three cases in support of this assertion. None of them, however, involved a statutory provision authorizing
private suit against a State. California v. United States, 320 U. S. 577
(1944), disregarded the presumption in a case brought against a State
by the Federal Government (and under a statutory provision authorizing suit only by the Federal Government). See id., at 585-586. United
States v. California, 297 U. S. 175 (1936), found the presumption overcome in similar circumstances--and with regard to a statute that used not
the word "person," but rather the phrase "common carrier." See id., at
186-187. And Georgia v. Evans, 316 U. S. 159 (1942), held that the presumption was overcome when, if a State were not regarded as a "person"
for purposes of bringing an action under $ 7 of the Sherman Act, it would
be left "without any redress for injuries resulting from practices outlawed
by that Act." Id., at 162.

The dissent contends that "[t]he reason for presuming that an enacting
sovereign does not intend to authorize litigation against itself simply
does not apply to federal statutes that apply equally to state agencies and
private entities." Post, at 798. That is true enough, but in the American system there is a different reason, equally valid. While the States do
not have the immunity against federally authorized suit that international
law has traditionally accorded foreign sovereigns, see National City Bank
of N. Y. v. Republic of China, 348 U. S. 356, 358-359 (1955), they are sovereigns nonetheless, and both comity and respect for our federal system

presumption is "particularly applicable where it is claimed
that Congress has subjected the States to liability to which
they had not been subject before." Will v. Michigan Dept.
of State Police, 491 U. S. 58, 64 (1989); Wilson v. Omaha
Tribe, 442 U. S. 653, 667 (1979). The presumption is, of
course, not a "hard and fast rule of exclusion," Cooper Corp.,
supra, at 604-605, but it may be disregarded only upon
some affirmative showing of statutory intent to the contrary.
See International Primate Protection League v. Administrators of Tulane Ed. Fund, 500 U. S. 72, 83 (1991).

As the historical context makes clear, and as we have
often observed, the FCA was enacted in 1863 with the principal goal of "stopping the massive frauds perpetrated by
large [private] contractors during the Civil War." United
States v. Bornstein, 423 U. S. 303, 309 (1976); see also United
States ex rel. Marcus v. Hess, 317 U. S. 537, 547 (1943).10 Its

demand that something more than mere use of the word "person" demonstrate the federal intent to authorize unconsented private suit against
them. In any event, Justice Stevens fought and lost this battle in Will
v. Michigan Dept. of State Police, 491 U. S. 58 (1989), in which the Court
applied the presumption to a federal statute when the "person" at issue
was a State. See id., at 64; but see id., at 73 (Brennan, J., dissenting,
joined by Marshall, Blackmun, and Stevens, JJ.). Moreover, Justice
Stevens actually joined the Court's opinion in Wilson v. Omaha Tribe,
442 U. S. 653 (1979), in which the Court likewise applied the presumption
to a federal statute in a case involving a State. See id., at 667. (Wilson
is omitted from the dissent's discussion of "[c]ases decided before 1986,"
which it claims "uniformly support" its reading of the statute. Post,
at 790.)

10 The dissent contends that the FCA was "intended to cover the full

range of fraudulent acts, including those perpetrated by States." Post,
at 793, and n. 4 (quoting United States v. Neifert-White Co., 390 U. S. 228,

Rep. No. 99-660, p. 18 (1985)). The sources the dissent quotes, however,
support its contention only as far as the comma. They stand for the unobjectionable proposition (codified in $ 3729(c)) that the FCA was intended
to cover all types of fraud, not for the additional proposition that the FCA
was intended to cover all types of fraudsters, including States.

Opinion of the Court

liability provision--the precursor to today's $ 3729(a)--bore
no indication that States were subject to its penalties. Indeed, far from indicating that States were covered, it did
not even make clear that private corporations were, since
it applied only to "any person not in the military or naval
forces of the United States, nor in the militia called into
or actually employed in the service of the United States,"
and imposed criminal penalties that included imprisonment.11
Act of Mar. 2, 1863, ch. 67, $ 3, 12 Stat. 698. We do not
suggest that these features directed only at natural persons
cast doubt upon the courts' assumption that $ 3729(a) extends
to corporations, see, e. g., United States ex rel. Woodard v.
Country View Care Center, Inc., 797 F. 2d 888, 890 (CA10
1986)--but that is because the presumption with regard to
corporations is just the opposite of the one governing here:
they are presumptively covered by the term "person," see
1 U. S. C. $ 1. But the text of the original statute does less
than nothing to overcome the presumption that States are
not covered.

Although the liability provision of the original FCA has
undergone various changes, none of them suggests a broadening of the term "person" to include States. In 1982, Congress made a housekeeping change, replacing the phrase
"any person not in the military or naval forces of the United
States, nor in the militia called into or actually employed
in the service of the United States" with the phrase "[a] person not a member of an armed force of the United States,"
thereby incorporating the term of art "member of an armed
force" used throughout Title 10 of the United States Code.

Forces, replacing the phrase "[a] person not a member of an

armed force of the United States" with the current "[a]ny
person." 31 U. S. C. $ 3729(a).12

Several features of the current statutory scheme further
support the conclusion that States are not subject to qui
tam liability. First, another section of the FCA, 31 U. S. C.

$ 3733, which enables the Attorney General to issue civil investigative demands to "any person . . . possessi[ng] information relevant to a false claims law investigation," $ 3733(a)(1),

12 The dissent claims that "[t]he term `person' in $ 3729(a) that we are
interpreting today was enacted by the 1986 Congress, not by the 1863
Congress." Post, at 794, n. 5. But the term "person" has remained in
the statute unchanged since 1863; the 1986 amendment merely changed
the modifier "[a]" to "[a]ny." This no more caused the word "person" to
include States than did the replacement of the word "any" with "[a]" four
years earlier. The dissent's sole basis for giving the change from "[a]" to
"[a]ny" this precise and unusual consequence is a single sentence of legislative history from the 1986 Congress. That would be unequal to the
task in any event, but as it happens the sentence was not even describing
the consequence of the proposed revision, but was setting forth a Senate
Committee's (erroneous) understanding of the meaning of the statutory
term enacted some 123 years earlier. The paragraph in which the sentence appears discusses the FCA "[i]n its present," i. e., pre-1986, "form."
S. Rep. No. 99-345, p. 8 (1986).

The dissent contradicts its contention that the "intent" of the 1986
Congress, rather than that of the 1863 Congress, controls here, by relying heavily on a House Committee Report from 1862. Post, at 791-792
(citing H. R. Rep. No. 2, 37th Cong., 2d Sess., pt. ii-a, pp. xxxviii-xxxix
(1862)). Even for those disposed to allow the meaning of a statute to be
determined by a single committee, that Report is utterly irrelevant, since
it was not prepared in connection with the 1863 Act, or indeed in connection with any proposed false claims legislation. In repeating the Second
Circuit's unsupported assertion that Congress must have had this Report
in mind a year later when it enacted the FCA, the dissent asks us to
indulge even a greater suspension of disbelief than legislative history normally requires. And finally, this irrelevant committee Report does not
provide the promised support for the view that "[t]he False Claims Act
is . . . as capable of being violated by state as by individual action," post,
at 791. The cited portion details a single incident of fraud by a state
official against a State, not an incident of fraud by a State against the
Federal Government.

l)(4).13 The
presence of such a definitional provision in $ 3733, togetherwith the absence of such a provision from the definitional

provisions contained in $ 3729, see $$ 3729(b)-(c), suggeststhat States are not "persons" for purposes of

qui tam liability under $ 3729.14

Second, the current version of the FCA imposes damages
that are essentially punitive in nature, which would be in13 The dissent points out that the definition of "person" in $ 3733(l)(4)
also applies to $ 3733(l)(2), a definitional provision which defines the
phrase "false claims law investigation" as "any inquiry conducted by any
false claims law investigator for the purpose of ascertaining whether
any person is or has been engaged in any violation of a false claims law."
See post, at 789, 795. But the effect of assuming a State to be a "person"
for purposes of that definitional section is not to embrace investigations
of States within the definition. A "false claims investigation" will still
not include an investigation of a State, since whether a "person" (however
broadly defined) "is or has been engaged in any violation of a false claims
law" depends on whether that person is subject to the "false claims law,"
which refers us back to $ 3729, to which $ 3733(l)(4)'s definition of "person"
is explicitly made inapplicable. What the application of $ 3733(l)(4) to

$ 3733(l)(2) does achieve is to subject States, not to qui tam liability, but
to civil investigative demands. That is entirely appropriate, since States
will often be able to provide useful evidence in investigations of private
contractors.

14 The dissent contends that our argument "prove[s] too much," since

the definition of "person" in $ 3733(l)(4) includes not just States, but also
"any natural person, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal
entity"; under our reasoning, it contends, all of those entities would also
be excluded from the definition of "person" under $ 3729. Post, at 799.
That is not so. Unlike States, all of those entities are presumptively
covered by the term "person." See 1 U. S. C. $ 1. The addition of States
to 31 U. S. C. $ 3733, and the failure to add States to $ 3729, suggests that
States are not subject to qui tam liability under $ 3729.

The dissent attempts to explain the absence of a definitional provision in $ 3729 by suggesting that Congress "simply saw no need to
add a definition of `person' in $ 3729 because . . . the meaning of the term
`person' was already well understood." Post, at 799. If that were so, and
if the "understanding" included States, there would have been no need
to include a definition of "person" in $ 3733.

consistent with state qui tam liability in light of the presumption against imposition of punitive damages on governmental entities. See, e. g., Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc.,
453 U. S. 247, 262-263 (1981).15 Although this Court suggested that damages under an earlier version of the FCA
were remedial rather than punitive, see Bornstein, 423 U. S.,
at 315; but see Smith v. Wade, 461 U. S. 30, 85 (1983) (Rehn-
quist, J., dissenting), that version of the statute imposed
only double damages and a civil penalty of $2,000 per claim,
see 31 U. S. C. $ 231 (1976 ed.); the current version, by contrast, generally imposes treble damages and a civil penalty of up to $10,000 per claim, see 31 U. S. C. $ 3729(a).16

15 The dissent attempts to distinguish Newport on the basis of a single
sentence in that opinion stating that "courts vie[w] punitive damages
[against governmental bodies] as contrary to sound public policy, because
such awards would burden the very taxpayers and citizens for whose benefit the wrongdoer was being chastised." Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc.,
453 U. S., at 263. The dissent contends that Newport is inapplicable
where, as here, "[t]he taxpaying `citizens for whose benefit' the [statute] is
designed are the citizens of the United States, not the citizens of any
individual State that might violate the [statute]." Post, at 801. The
problem with this is that Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983--the statute
at issue in Newport--is, like the FCA, a federal law designed to benefit
"the citizens of the United States, not the citizens of any individual State
that might violate the [statute]." A better reading of Newport is that we
were concerned with imposing punitive damages on taxpayers under any
circumstances. " `[Punitive damages], being evidently vindictive, cannot,
in our opinion, be sanctioned by this court, as they are to be borne by
widows, orphans, aged men and women, and strangers, who, admitting
that they must repair the injury inflicted by the Mayor on the plaintiff,
cannot be bound beyond that amount, which will be sufficient for her indemnification.' " Newport, supra, at 261 (quoting McGary v. President &
Council of City of Lafayette, 12 Rob. 668, 677 (La. 1846)).

16 As the dissent correctly points out, see post, at 801, n. 11, treble damages may be reduced to double damages in certain cases, see $ 3729(a).
This exception, however, applies only in some of those (presumably few)
cases involving defendants who provide information concerning the violation before they have knowledge that an investigation is underway.
See ibid.

Opinion of the Court

original FCA were not punitive, but suggesting that treble
damages, such as those in the antitrust laws, would have
been). "The very idea of treble damages reveals an intent
to punish past, and to deter future, unlawful conduct, not to
ameliorate the liability of wrongdoers." Texas Industries,
Inc. v. Radcliff Materials, Inc., 451 U. S. 630, 639 (1981).

Third, the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act of 1986
(PFCRA), a sister scheme creating administrative remedies for false claims--and enacted just before the FCA was
amended in 1986--contains (unlike the FCA) a definition
of "persons" subject to liability, and that definition does not
include States. See 31 U. S. C. $ 3801(a)(6) (defining "person" as "any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or private organization"). It would be most peculiar
to subject States to treble damages and civil penalties in
qui tam actions under the FCA, but exempt them from
the relatively smaller damages provided under the PFCRA.
See $ 3802(a)(1).17

17 The dissent attempts to distinguish the PFCRA on the ground that
it is a separate and subsequently enacted statute. See post, at 799-800,
and n. 10. But it is well established that a court can, and should, interpret the text of one statute in the light of text of surrounding statutes,
even those subsequently enacted. See FDA v. Brown & Williamson
Tobacco Corp., ante, at 133; United States v. Fausto, 484 U. S. 439, 453
(1988). Moreover, there is no question that the PFCRA was designed to
operate in tandem with the FCA. Not only was it enacted at virtually
the same time as the FCA was amended in 1986, but its scope is virtually
identical to that of the FCA. Compare $ 3729(a) (FCA) ("Any person
who . . . knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, to an officer or
employee of the United States Government . . . a false or fraudulent claim
for payment or approval . . .") with $ 3802(a)(1) (PFCRA) ("Any person
who makes, presents, or submits, or causes to be made, presented, or submitted, a claim that the person knows or has reason to know . . . is false,
fictitious, or fraudulent . . ."). The dissent would, in any event, subject
States to suit under the PFCRA no less than under the FCA--despite its
detailed definition of "person" that does not include States. In justification of this the dissent again cites California v. United States, 320 U. S.,

Opinion of the Court
In sum, we believe that various features of the FCA, bothas originally enacted and as amended, far from providing

the requisite affirmative indications that the term "per-son" included States for purposes of qui tam liability, indicate quite the contrary. Our conclusion is buttressed bytwo other considerations that we think it unnecessary to
discuss at any length: first, "the ordinary rule of statutoryconstruction" that "if Congress intends to alter the usual
constitutional balance between States and the Federal Gov-ernment, it must make its intention to do so unmistakably
clear in the language of the statute," Will, 491 U. S., at 65(internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see also
Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 460-461 (1991); United
States v. Bass, 404 U. S. 336, 349 (1971), and second, thedoctrine that statutes should be construed so as to avoid

difficult constitutional questions. We of course express noview on the question whether an action in federal court
by a qui tam relator against a State would run afoul of theEleventh Amendment, but we note that there is "a serious
doubt" on that score. Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 348(1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring) (internal quotation marks
and citation omitted).18

We hold that a private individual has standing to bringsuit in federal court on behalf of the United States under

the False Claims Act, 31 U. S. C. $$ 3729-3733, but that the
at 585, and Evans, 316 U. S., at 160. In addition to being inapposite because they did not authorize suits against States by private parties, see
n. 9, supra, the definitions of "person" in the statutes at issue in those
cases were not as detailed as that of the PFCRA, and set forth what the
term "person" included, rather than, as the PFCRA does, what the term
"person" "means," see 31 U. S. C. $ 3801(a)(6) (emphasis added).

18 Although the dissent concludes that States can be "persons" for purposes of commencing an FCA qui tam action under $ 3730(b), see post,
at 794-795, we need not resolve that question here, and therefore leave
it open.

I join the Court's judgment and here state the extent towhich I subscribe to the Court's opinion.
I agree with the Court that the qui tam relator is prop-erly regarded as an assignee of a portion of the Government's claim for damages. See ante, at 773. And I agree,most vitally, that "Article III's restriction of the judicial
power to `Cases' and `Controversies' is properly under-stood to mean `cases and controversies of the sort traditionally amenable to, and resolved by, the judicial process.' "
Ante, at 774. On that key matter, I again agree that history's pages place the qui tam suit safely within the "case"
or "controversy" category. See ante, at 774-778.

In Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, 523 U. S.

citizen suit, a court should dismiss the citizen suitor's complaint without opining "on the constitutionality of what Congress might have done, but did not do." Id., at 134 (opinion
concurring in judgment). I therefore agree that the Court
properly turns first to the statutory question here presented:
Did Congress authorize qui tam suits against the States.
Concluding that Congress did not authorize such suits, the
Court has no cause to engage in an Eleventh Amendment
inquiry, and appropriately leaves that issue open.

ante, at 787-788. I note, however,
that the clear statement rule applied to private suits againsta State has not been applied when the United States is the

plaintiff. See, e. g., Sims v. United States, 359 U. S. 108, 112(1959) (state agency ranks as a "person" subject to suit by
the United States under federal tax levy provision); United
States v. California, 297 U. S. 175, 186-187 (1936) (state-owned railway ranks as a "common carrier" under Federal

Safety Appliance Act subject suit for penalties by the UnitedStates). I read the Court's decision to leave open the question whether the word "person" encompasses States whenthe United States itself sues under the False Claims Act.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Souter joins,
dissenting.

In 1986, Congress amended the False Claims Act (FCA
or Act) to create a new procedure known as a "civil investigative demand," which allows the Attorney General to obtain documentary evidence "for the purpose of ascertaining
whether any person is or has been engaged in" a violation of the Act--including a violation of 31 U. S. C. $ 3729.
The 1986 amendments also declare that a "person" who
could engage in a violation of $ 3729--thereby triggering the
civil investigative demand provision--includes "any State or
political subdivision of a State." See $ 6(a), 100 Stat. 3168
(codified at 31 U. S. C. $$ 3733(l)(1)(A), (2), (4)). In my view,
this statutory text makes it perfectly clear that Congress
intended the term "person" in $ 3729 to include States. This
understanding is supported by the legislative history of the
1986 amendments, and is fully consistent with this Court's
construction of federal statutes in cases decided before those
amendments were enacted.

Since the FCA was amended in 1986, however, the Court
has decided a series of cases that cloak the States with an
increasingly protective mantle of "sovereign immunity" from

liability for violating federal laws. It is through the lens ofthose post-1986 cases that the Court has chosen to construe

the statute at issue in this case. To explain my disagree-ment with the Court, I shall comment on pre-1986 cases, the
legislative history of the 1986 amendments, and the statutorytext of the FCA--all of which support the view that Congress understood States to be included within the meaningof the word "person" in $ 3729. I shall then briefly explain
why the State's constitutional defenses fail, even under theCourt's post-1986 construction of the doctrine of sovereign
immunity. I

Cases decided before 1986 uniformly support the proposi-tion that the broad language used in the FCA means what it
says. Although general statutory references to "persons"are not normally construed to apply to the enacting sovereign, United States v. Mine Workers, 330 U. S. 258, 275(1947), when Congress uses that word in federal statutes enforceable by the Federal Government or by a federal agency,it applies to States and state agencies as well as to private
individuals and corporations. Thus, for example, the word"person" in the Sherman Act does not include the sovereign
that enacted the statute (the Federal Government), United
States v. Cooper Corp., 312 U. S. 600 (1941), but it does in-clude the States,

Georgia v. Evans, 316 U. S. 159 (1942).Similarly, States are subject to regulation as a "person"

within the meaning of the Shipping Act of 1916, Californiav.

United States, 320 U. S. 577 (1944), and as a "common carrier" within the meaning of the Safety Appliance Act, United
States v. California, 297 U. S. 175 (1936). In the latter case,
the State of California "invoke[d] the canon of constructionthat a sovereign is presumptively not intended to be bound"

by a statute unless the Act expressly declares that to bethe case.

Id., at 186. We rejected the applicability of that
canon, stating:

"We can perceive no reason for extending it so as toexempt a business carried on by a state from the otherwise applicable provisions of an act of Congress, all-embracing in scope and national in its purpose, which is
as capable of being obstructed by state as by individualaction. Language and objectives so plain are not to be
thwarted by resort to a rule of construction whose purpose is but to resolve doubts, and whose application in
the circumstances would be highly artificial." Id., at

The False Claims Act is also all-embracing in scope,
national in its purpose, and as capable of being violated
by state as by individual action.2 It was enacted during

the Civil War, shortly after a congressional committee

1 The difference between the post-1986 lens through which the Court
views sovereign immunity issues, on the one hand, and the actual intent
of Congress in statutes like the one before us today, on the other hand, is
well illustrated by the congressional rejection of the holdings in Hoffman
v. Connecticut Dept. of Income Maintenance, 492 U. S. 96 (1989), and
United States v. Nordic Village, Inc., 503 U. S. 30 (1992). In those cases,
the Court refused to find the necessary unequivocal waiver of sovereign
immunity against both the States and the Federal Government in $ 106(c)
of the Bankruptcy Code.

Congress, however, thought differently: "In enacting section 106(c), Congress intended . . . to make the States subject to a money judgment. But
the Supreme Court in Hoffman v. Connecticut Department of Income
Maintenance, 492 U. S. 96 (1989), held [otherwise.] In using such a narrow construction, the Court . . . did not find in the text of the statute an
`unmistakenly clear' intent of Congress to waive sovereign immunity . . . .
The Court applied this reasoning in United States v. Nordic Village, Inc."
See 140 Cong. Rec. 27693 (1994). Congress therefore overruled both of
those decisions by enacting the current version of 11 U. S. C. $ 106.

2 It is thus at the opposite pole from the statute construed in Wilson v.

Omaha Tribe, 442 U. S. 653 (1979), which held that the term "white person" did not include the State of Iowa because "it is apparent that in
adopting $ 22 Congress had in mind only disputes arising in Indian country,
disputes that would not arise in or involve any of the States." Id., at 668.

had decried the "fraud and peculation" by state officials in
connection with the procurement of military supplies and
Government contracts--specifically mentioning the purchases of supplies by the States of Illinois, Indiana, New
York, and Ohio. See H. R. Rep. No. 2, 37th Cong., 2d Sess.,
pt. ii-a, pp. xxxviii-xxxix (1862). Although the FCA was
not enacted until the following year, the Court of Appeals
for the Second Circuit correctly observed that "it is difficult to suppose that when Congress considered the bills
leading to the 1863 Act a year later it either meant to exclude the States from the `persons' who were to be liable for
presentation of false claims to the federal government or had
forgotten the results of this extensive investigation." 162
F. 3d 195, 206 (1998). That observation is faithful to the
broad construction of the Act that this Court consistently
endorsed in cases decided before 1986 (and hardly requires
any "suspension of disbelief " as the majority supposes, ante,
at 783, n. 12).

Thus, in United States v. Neifert-White Co., 390 U. S. 228,
232 (1968), after noting that the Act was passed as a result
of investigations of the fraudulent use of federal funds during
the Civil War, we inferred "that the Act was intended to
reach all types of fraud, without qualification, that might result in financial loss to the Government." See also Rainwater v. United States, 356 U. S. 590, 592 (1958) ("It seems
quite clear that the objective of Congress [in the FCA] was
broadly to protect the funds and property of the Government
from fraudulent claims"); H. R. Rep. No. 99-660, p. 18 (1986)
("[T]he False Claims Act is used as . . . the primary vehicle
by the Government for recouping losses suffered through
fraud"). Indeed, the fact that Congress has authorized
qui tam actions by private individuals to supplement the
remedies available to the Federal Government provides additional evidence of its intent to reach all types of fraud that
cause financial loss to the Federal Government. Finally, the

Stevens, J., dissenting
breadth of the "claims" to which the FCA applies 3 onlyconfirms the notion that the law was intended to cover the

full range of fraudulent acts, including those perpetratedby States.

4

The legislative history of the 1986 amendments disclosesthat both federal and state officials understood that States

were "persons" within the meaning of the statute. Thus, ina section of the 1986 Senate Report describing the history
of the Act, the committee unequivocally stated that the Actreaches all parties who may submit false claims and that
"[t]he term `person' is used in its broad sense to includepartnerships, associations, and corporations . . . as well as
States and political subdivisions thereof." S. Rep. No. 99-345, pp. 8-9.

5

3 Title 31 U. S. C. $ 3729(c) reads: "For purposes of this section, `claim'
includes any request or demand, whether under a contract or otherwise,
for money or property which is made to a contractor, grantee, or other
recipient if the United States Government provides any portion of the
money or property which is requested or demanded, or if the Government
will reimburse such contractor, grantee, or other recipient for any portion
of the money or property which is requested or demanded."

4 When Congress amended the FCA in 1986, it noted that "[e]vidence

of fraud in Government programs and procurement is on a steady rise."
H. R. Rep. No. 99-660, at 18. And at that time, federal grants to state
and local governments had totaled over $108 billion. See U. S. Dept. of
Commerce National Data Book and Guide to Sources, Statistical Abstract
of the United States 301 (108th ed. 1988) (compiling data from 1986). It
is therefore difficult to believe, as the Court contends, that Congress
intended "to cover all types of fraud, [but not] all types of fraudsters,"
ante, at 781, n. 10, a conclusion that would exclude from coverage such a
large share of potential fraud.

5 Petitioner argues that the Senate Report's statement was simply inaccurate, because the three cases to which the Report cited for support
did not interpret the meaning of the word "person" in the FCA. Brief
for Petitioner 25-26. The cases stand for the proposition that the statutory term "person" may include States and local governments--exactly
the proposition I have discussed above. See supra, at 790. Petitioner's
observation that none of the cases cited is directly on point only indicates

Indeed, a few federal courts had accepted jurisdiction in
qui tam cases brought by the States--thus indicating their
view that States were included among the "persons" who
may bring qui tam actions as relators under $ 3730(b)(1).
See United States ex rel. Woodard v. Country View Care
Center, Inc., 797 F. 2d 888 (CA10 1986); United States ex rel.
Wisconsin v. Dean, 729 F. 2d 1100 (CA7 1984); see also
United States ex rel. Hartigan v. Palumbo Bros., Inc., 797
F. Supp. 624 (ND Ill. 1992). Not only do these cases express
the view of those federal judges who thought a State could
be a "person" under $ 3730(b)(1), but the cases also demonstrate that the States considered themselves to be statutory
"persons." In fact, in the Dean case, the United States filed
a statement with the court explicitly stating its view that
"[t]he State is a proper relator." 729 F. 2d, at 1103, n. 2.
And when the Seventh Circuit in that case dismissed Wisconsin's qui tam claim on grounds unrelated to the definition

that the Senate's understanding was based on an analogy rather than on
controlling precedent.

Petitioner further argues that the text of the FCA as it was originally
enacted in 1863 could not have included States as "persons," and therefore the Senate's understanding of the pre-1986 Act was erroneous. See
also ante, at 778. Assuming for argument's sake that the Senate incorrectly ascertained what Congress meant in 1863, petitioner's argument
is beside the point. The term "person" in $ 3729(a) that we are interpreting today was enacted by the 1986 Congress, not by the 1863 Congress.
See 100 Stat. 3153 (deleting entirely the previously existing introductory
clause in $ 3729, including the phrase "[a] person not a member of an armed
force of the United States" and replacing it with the new phrase "[a]ny
person"). Therefore, even if the 1986 Congress were mistaken about
what a previous Legislature had meant by the word "person," it clearly
expressed its own view that when the 1986 Congress itself enacted the
word "person" (and not merely the word "any" as the Court insists, ante,
at 783, n. 12), it meant the reference to include States. There is not the
least bit of contradiction (as the Court suggests, ibid.) in one Congress
informing itself of the general understanding of a statutory term it enacts
based on its own (perhaps erroneous) understanding of what a past Congress thought the term meant.

of the word "person," the National Association of AttorneysGeneral adopted a resolution urging Congress to make it

easier for States to be relators.6 When Congress amendedthe FCA in 1986--and enacted the word "person" in $ 3729
at issue here--it had all of this information before it, i. e.,that federal judges had accepted States as relators (and
hence as "persons"); that the States considered themselvesto be statutory "persons" and wanted greater freedom to be
"persons" who could sue under the Act; and that the UnitedStates had taken a like position. See S. Rep. No. 99-345,
at 12-13.In sum, it is quite clear that when the 1986 amendments
were adopted, there was a general understanding that Statesand state agencies were "persons" within the meaning of
the Act. II

The text of the 1986 amendments confirms the pre-existingunderstanding. The most significant part of the amendments is the enactment of a new $ 3733 granting authorityto the Attorney General to issue a civil investigative demand (CID) before commencing a civil proceeding on be-half of the United States. A series of interwoven definitions in $ 3733 unambiguously demonstrates that a State is a
"person" who can violate $ 3729.

Section 3733 authorizes the Attorney General to issue aCID when she is conducting a "false claims law investigation." $ 3733(a). A "false claims law investigation" isdefined as an investigation conducted "for the purpose of ascertaining whether any person is or has been engaged inany violation of a false claims law." $ 3733(

l)(2) (emphasis
added). And a "false claims law" includes $ 3729--the pro-vision at issue in this case. $ 3733(

gaged in a violation of $ 3729. Finally, a "person" is definedto include "any State or political subdivision of a State."

$ 3733(l)(4). Hence, the CID provisions clearly state that a"person" who may be "engaged in any violation of a false
claims law," including $ 3729, includes a "State or a politi-cal subdivision of a State."

7 These CID provisions thus

unmistakably express Congress' understanding that a Statemay be a "person" who can violate $ 3729.

Elsewhere in the False Claims Act the term "person"includes States as well. For example, $ 3730 of the Act--
both before and after the 1986 amendments--uses the word
"person" twice. First, subsection (a) of $ 3730 directs theAttorney General to investigate violations of $ 3729, and

provides that if she "finds that a person has violated oris violating" that section, she may bring a civil action
"under this section against the person." (Emphases added.)Second, subsection (b) of $ 3730 also uses the word "person,"
though for a different purpose; in that subsection the wordis used to describe the plaintiffs who may bring

qui tam
actions on behalf of themselves and the United States.

Quite clearly, a State is a "person" against whom theAttorney General may proceed under $ 3730(a).

8 And as

I noted earlier, see supra, at 794, before 1986 States wereconsidered "persons" who could bring a

qui tam action
as a relator under $ 3730(b)--and the Court offers nothingto question that understanding. See

ante, at 787, n. 18.
Moreover, when a qui tam relator brings an action on behalfof the United States, he or she is, in effect, authorized to act

as an assignee of the Federal Government's claim. See ante,at 773. Given that understanding, combined with the fact

7 Because this concatenation of definitions expressly references and incorporates $ 3729, it is no answer that the definitions listed in $ 3733 apply,
by their terms, "[f]or the purposes of" $ 3733.

8 Justice Ginsburg, who joins in the Court's judgment, is careful to

point out that the Court does not disagree with this reading of $ 3730(a).

that $ 3730(a) does not make any distinction between possibledefendants against whom the Attorney General may bring

an action, the most normal inference to draw is that qui

tam actions may be brought by relators against the same
category of "persons" that may be sued by the AttorneyGeneral.

To recapitulate, it is undisputed that (under the CID provision) a State is a "person" who may violate $ 3729; that aState is a "person" who may be named as a defendant in an

action brought by the Attorney General; and that a Stateis a "person" who may bring a

qui tam action on behalf of
the United States. It therefore seems most natural to read
the adjacent uses of the term "person" in $$ 3729, 3730(a),
3730(b), and 3733 to cover the same category of defendants.
See United States v. Cooper Corp., 312 U. S., at 606 ("It is
hardly credible that Congress used the term `person' in
different senses in the same sentence"). And it seems even
more natural to read the single word "person" (describing
who may commit a violation under $ 3729) to have one consistent meaning regardless of whether the action against
that violator is brought under $ 3730(a) or under $ 3730(b).
See Ratzlaf v. United States, 510 U. S. 135, 143 (1994)
("A term appearing in several places in a statutory text is
generally read the same way each time it appears. We have
even stronger cause to construe a single formulation . . . the
same way each time it is called into play" (citation omitted)).
Absent powerful arguments to the contrary, it should follow
that a State may be named as a defendant in an action
brought by an assignee of the United States. Rather than
pointing to any such powerful arguments, however, the
Court comes to a contrary conclusion on the basis of an inapplicable presumption and rather strained inferences drawn
from three different statutory provisions.

The Court's principal argument relies on "our longstanding interpretive presumption that `person' does not include
the sovereign." Ante, at 780. As discussed earlier, that

798 VERMONT AGENCY OF NATURAL RESOURCES v.

UNITED STATES ex rel. STEVENS

Stevens, J., dissenting

"presumption" does not quite do the heavy lifting the Court
would like it to do. What's more, the doctrinal origins of
that "presumption" meant only that the enacting sovereign
was not normally thought to be a statutory "person." See,
e. g., United States v. California, 297 U. S., at 186 ("[T]he
canon of construction that a sovereign is presumptively
not intended to be bound by its own statute unless named
in it . . . has its historical basis in the English doctrine that
the Crown is unaffected by acts of Parliament not specifically
directed against it. The presumption is an aid to consistent construction of statutes of the enacting sovereign when
their purpose is in doubt" (emphasis added)); see also United
States v. Mine Workers, 330 U. S., at 275; United States
v. Fox, 94 U. S. 315, 321 (1877); Will v. Michigan Dept.
of State Police, 491 U. S. 58, 73 (1989) (Brennan, J., dissenting). The reason for presuming that an enacting sovereign does not intend to authorize litigation against itself
simply does not apply to federal statutes that apply equally
to state agencies and private entities. Finally, the "affirmative showing" the Court would require to demonstrate
that the word "person" includes States, ante, at 781, is
plainly found in the statutory text discussed above.

The Court's first textual argument is based on the fact
that the definition of the term "person" included in $ 3733's
CID provision expressly includes States. "The presence of
such a definitional provision in $ 3733," the Court argues,
"together with the absence of such a provision from the
definitional provisions contained in $ 3729 . . . suggests that
States are not `persons' for purposes of qui tam liability
under $ 3729." Ante, at 784. Leaving aside the fact that

$ 3733's definition actually cuts in the opposite direction,
see supra, at 795-796, this argument might carry some
weight if the definitional provisions in $ 3729 included some
definition of "person" but simply neglected to mention
States. But the definitional provisions in $ 3729 do not in529US3 Unit: $U59 [09-26-01 12:32:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN

799Cite as: 529 U. S. 765 (2000)
Stevens, J., dissenting
clude any definition of "person" at all. The negative infer-ence drawn by the Court, if taken seriously, would therefore

prove too much. The definition of "person" in $ 3733 in-cludes not only States, but also "any natural person, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity."$ 3733(l)(4). If the premise of the Court's argument were
correct--that the inclusion of certain items as a "person" in$ 3733 implies their exclusion as a "person" in $ 3729--then
there would be absolutely no one left to be a "person" under$ 3729.

9 It is far more reasonable to assume that Congress

simply saw no need to add a definition of "person" in $ 3729because (as both the legislative history, see

supra, at 791-795, and the definitions in the CID provisions demonstrate)

the meaning of the term "person" was already well under-stood. Congress likely thought it unnecessary to include a
definition in $ 3729 itself.The Court also relies on the definition of "person" in a
separate, but similar, statute, the Program Fraud Civil Rem-edies Act of 1986 (PFCRA).

Ante, at 786. The definitionof "person" found in that law includes "any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or private organization."31 U. S. C. $ 3801(a)(6). It is first worth pointing out the
obvious: Although the PFCRA sits next to the FCA in theUnited States Code, they are separate statutes. It is therefore not altogether clear why the former has much bearingon the latter.

10 Regardless, the Court's whole argument

9 Not so, the Court says, because natural persons and other entities,
unlike States, are presumed to be included within the term "person."
Ante, at 784, n. 14. In other words, this supposedly independent textual argument does nothing on its own without relying entirely on
the presumption already discussed. See supra, at 797-798; ante, at 780-
784. The negative inference adds nothing on its own.

10 Indeed, reliance on the PFCRA seems to contradict the Court's central premise--that in 1863 the word "person" did not include States and
that scattered intervening amendments have done nothing to change that.
Ante, at 781-782. If that were so, the relevant meaning of the word

UNITED STATES ex rel. STEVENS

Stevens, J., dissenting

about the PFCRA rests entirely on the premise that its
definition of "person" does not include States. That premise, in turn, relies upon the fact that $ 3801(a)(6) in the
PFCRA defines a "person" to include "any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or private organization,"
but does not mention States. We have, however, interpreted similar definitions of "person," which included corporations, partnerships, and associations, to include States as
well, even though States were not expressly mentioned in
the statutory definition. See California v. United States,
320 U. S., at 585; Georgia v. Evans, 316 U. S., at 160.
(I draw no definitive conclusions as to whether States are
subject to suit under the PFCRA; I only mean to suggest
that the Court's premise is not as obvious as it presumes
it to be.) In any event, the ultimate relevant question is
whether the text and legislative history of the FCA make it
clear that $ 3729's use of the word "person" includes States.
Because they do, nothing in any other piece of legislation
narrows the meaning of that term.

Finally, the Court relies on the fact that the current
version of the FCA includes a treble damages remedy that
is "essentially punitive in nature." Ante, at 784. Citing
Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc., 453 U. S. 247, 262-263 (1981),
the Court invokes the "presumption against imposition of
punitive damages on governmental entities." Ante, at 785.
But as Newport explains, "courts vie[w] punitive damages
[against governmental bodies] as contrary to sound public
policy, because such awards would burden the very tax"person" would be the meaning adopted by the 1863 Congress, not the
1986 Congress. And on that premise, why should it matter what a different Congress, in a different century, did in a separate statute? Of course,
as described earlier, see n. 5, supra, I believe it is the 1986 Congress'
understanding of the word "person" that controls, because it is that word
as enacted by the 1986 Congress that we are interpreting in this case.
But on the Court's premise, it is the 1863 Congress' understanding that
controls and the PFCRA should be irrelevant.

payers and citizens for whose benefit the wrongdoer wasbeing chastised." 453 U. S., at 263. That rationale is inapplicable here. The taxpaying "citizens for whose benefit"the FCA is designed are the citizens of the United States,
not the citizens of any individual State that might violate theAct. It is true, of course, that the taxpayers of a State that
violates the FCA will ultimately bear the burden of payingthe treble damages. It is not the coffers of the State (and
hence state taxpayers), however, that the FCA is designedto protect, but the coffers of the National Government (and
hence the federal taxpayers). Accordingly, a treble dam-ages remedy against a State does not "burden the very taxpayers" the statute was designed to protect.11

III
Each of the constitutional issues identified in the Court'sopinion requires only a brief comment. The historical evidence summarized by the Court, ante, at 774-778, is obvi-ously sufficient to demonstrate that

qui tam actions are"cases" or "controversies" within the meaning of Article III.

That evidence, together with the evidence that privateprosecutions were commonplace in the 19th century, see
Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, 523 U. S. 83,127-128, and nn. 24-25 (1998) (S

tevens, J., concurring injudgment), is also sufficient to resolve the Article II question

that the Court has introduced sua sponte, ante, at 778, n. 8.As for the State's "Eleventh Amendment" sovereign immunity defense, I adhere to the view that Seminole Tribe
of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44 (1996), was wrongly decided.See

Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 528 U. S. 62, 97-99(2000) (S

sufficient to abrogate any common-law defense of sovereignimmunity. Moreover, even if one accepts Seminole Tribe

as controlling, the State's immunity claim would still fail.Given the facts that (1) respondent is, in effect, suing as an
assignee of the United States, ante, at 773; (2) the EleventhAmendment does not provide the States with a defense to
claims asserted by the United States, see, e. g., United Statesv.

Mississippi, 380 U. S. 128, 140 (1965) ("[N]othing in [theEleventh Amendment] or any other provision of the Constitution prevents or has ever been seriously supposed to pre-vent a State's being sued by the United States"); and (3) the
Attorney General retains significant control over a relator'saction, see 162 F. 3d, at 199-201 (case below), the Court of
Appeals correctly affirmed the District Court's order deny-ing petitioner's motion to dismiss. Compare New Hampshire v. Louisiana, 108 U. S. 76 (1883), with South Dakota v.North Carolina, 192 U. S. 286 (1904).

12 I would, accordingly,

affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

12 The agency argues that this is essentially an "end run" around the
Eleventh Amendment. Brief for Petitioner 33. It is not at all clear to
me, though, why a qui tam action would be considered an "end run"
around that Amendment, yet precisely the same form of action is not an
"end run" around Articles II and III.

UNITED STATES et al. v. PLAYBOY ENTERTAIN-MENT GROUP, INC.
appeal from the united states district court for thedistrict of delaware

No. 98-1682. Argued November 30, 1999--Decided May 22, 2000
Section 505 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 requires cable television operators providing channels "primarily dedicated to sexuallyoriented programming" either to "fully scramble or otherwise fully
block" those channels or to limit their transmission to hours when children are unlikely to be viewing, set by administrative regulation as
between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. Even before $ 505's enactment, cable operators used signal scrambling to limit access to certain programs to paying
customers. Scrambling could be imprecise, however; and either or both
audio and visual portions of the scrambled programs might be heard or
seen, a phenomenon known as "signal bleed." The purpose of $ 505 is
to shield children from hearing or seeing images resulting from signal
bleed. To comply with $ 505, the majority of cable operators adopted
the "time channeling" approach, so that, for two-thirds of the day, no
viewers in their service areas could receive the programming in question. Appellee Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc., filed this suit challenging $ 505's constitutionality. A three-judge District Court concluded that $ 505's content-based restriction on speech violates the First
Amendment because the Government might further its interests in less
restrictive ways. One plausible, less restrictive alternative could be
found in $ 504 of the Act, which requires a cable operator, "[u]pon request by a cable service subscriber . . . without charge, [to] fully scramble or otherwise fully block" any channel the subscriber does not wish
to receive. As long as subscribers knew about this opportunity, the
court reasoned, $ 504 would provide as much protection against unwanted programming as would $ 505.

Held: Because the Government failed to prove $ 505 is the least restrictive

means for addressing a real problem, the District Court did not err in
holding the statute violative of the First Amendment. Pp. 811-827.

(a) Two points should be understood: (1) Many adults would find the
material at issue highly offensive, and considering that the material
comes unwanted into homes where children might see or hear it against
parental wishes or consent, there are legitimate reasons for regulating
it; and (2) Playboy's programming has First Amendment protection.

GROUP, INC.

Syllabus

Section 505 is a content-based regulation. It also singles out particular
programmers for regulation. It is of no moment that the statute does
not impose a complete prohibition. Since $ 505 is content based, it can
stand only if it satisfies strict scrutiny. E. g., Sable Communications
of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U. S. 115, 126. It must be narrowly tailored
to promote a compelling Government interest, and if a less restrictive
alternative would serve the Government's purpose, the legislature must
use that alternative. Cable television, like broadcast media, presents
unique problems, but even where speech is indecent and enters the
home, the objective of shielding children does not suffice to support a
blanket ban if the protection can be obtained by a less restrictive alternative. There is, moreover, a key difference between cable television
and the broadcasting media: Cable systems have the capacity to block
unwanted channels on a household-by-household basis. Targeted blocking is less restrictive than banning, and the Government cannot ban
speech if targeted blocking is a feasible and effective means of furthering its compelling interests. Pp. 811-815.

(b) No one disputes that $ 504 is narrowly tailored to the Government's goal of supporting parents who want sexually explicit channels
blocked. The question here is whether $ 504 can be effective. Despite
empirical evidence that $ 504 generated few requests for household-byhousehold blocking during a period when it was the sole federal blocking
statute in effect, the District Court correctly concluded that $ 504, if
publicized in an adequate manner, could serve as an effective, less restrictive means of reaching the Government's goals. When the Government restricts speech, the Government bears the burden of proving the
constitutionality of its actions. E. g., Greater New Orleans Broadcasting Assn., Inc. v. United States, 527 U. S. 173, 183. Of three explanations for the lack of individual blocking requests under $ 504--(1) individual blocking might not be an effective alternative, due to technological or other limitations; (2) although an adequately advertised blocking
provision might have been effective, $ 504 as written does not require
sufficient notice to make it so; and (3) the actual signal bleed problem
might be far less of a concern than the Government at first had supposed--the Government had to show that the first was the right answer.
According to the District Court, however, the first and third possibilities
were "equally consistent" with the record before it, and the record was
not clear as to whether enough notice had been issued to give $ 504 a
fighting chance. Unless the District Court's findings are clearly erroneous, the tie goes to free expression. With regard to signal bleed itself,
the District Court's thorough discussion exposes a central weakness in
the Government's proof: There is little hard evidence of how widespread

Syllabus
or how serious the problem is. There is no proof as to how likely any
child is to view a discernible explicit image, and no proof of the duration
of the bleed or the quality of the pictures or sound. Under $ 505, sanctionable signal bleed can include instances as fleeting as an image appearing on a screen for just a few seconds. The First Amendment requires a more careful assessment and characterization of an evil in order
to justify a regulation as sweeping as this. The Government has failed
to establish a pervasive, nationwide problem justifying its nationwide
daytime speech ban. The Government also failed to prove $ 504, with
adequate notice, would be ineffective. There is no evidence that a
well-promoted voluntary blocking provision would not be capable at
least of informing parents about signal bleed (if they are not yet aware
of it) and about their rights to have the bleed blocked (if they consider
it a problem and have not yet controlled it themselves). A court should
not assume a plausible, less restrictive alternative would be ineffective;
and a court should not presume parents, given full information, will fail
to act. The Government also argues society's independent interests
will be unserved if parents fail to act on that information. Even upon
the assumption that the Government has an interest in substituting itself for informed and empowered parents, its interest is not sufficiently
compelling to justify this widespread restriction on speech. The regulatory alternative of a publicized $ 504, which has the real possibility of
promoting more open disclosure and the choice of an effective blocking
system, would provide parents the information needed to engage in active supervision. The Government has not shown that this alternative
would be insufficient to secure its objective, or that any overriding harm
justifies its intervention. Although, under a voluntary blocking regime,
even with adequate notice, some children will be exposed to signal
bleed, children will also be exposed under time channeling, which does
not eliminate signal bleed around the clock. The record is silent as to
the comparative effectiveness of the two alternatives. Pp. 816-826.

Appellee Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc., challengedthe statute as unnecessarily restrictive content-based legislation violative of the First Amendment. After a trial, athree-judge District Court concluded that a regime in which
viewers could order signal blocking on a household-by-household basis presented an effective, less restrictive alternative to $ 505. 30 F. Supp. 2d 702, 719 (Del. 1998). Findingno error in this conclusion, we affirm.

I
Playboy Entertainment Group owns and prepares pro-grams for adult television networks, including Playboy Television and Spice. Playboy transmits its programming tocable television operators, who retransmit it to their subscribers, either through monthly subscriptions to premiumchannels or on a so-called "pay-per-view" basis. Cable operators transmit Playboy's signal, like other premium channelsignals, in scrambled form. The operators then provide
paying subscribers with an "addressable converter," a boxplaced on the home television set. The converter permits
the viewer to see and hear the descrambled signal. It isconceded that almost all of Playboy's programming consists
of sexually explicit material as defined by the statute.The statute was enacted because not all scrambling technology is perfect. Analog cable television systems may useeither "RF" or "baseband" scrambling systems, which may
not prevent signal bleed, so discernible pictures may ap-pear from time to time on the scrambled screen. Furthermore, the listener might hear the audio portion of theprogram.

Opinion of the Court

These imperfections are not inevitable. The problem is
that at present it appears not to be economical to convert
simpler RF or baseband scrambling systems to alternative
scrambling technologies on a systemwide scale. Digital
technology may one day provide another solution, as it presents no bleed problem at all. Indeed, digital systems are
projected to become the technology of choice, which would
eliminate the signal bleed problem. Digital technology is
not yet in widespread use, however. With imperfect scrambling, viewers who have not paid to receive Playboy's channels may happen across discernible images of a sexually explicit nature. How many viewers, how discernible the scene
or sound, and how often this may occur are at issue in this
case.

Section 505 was enacted to address the signal bleed phenomenon. As noted, the statute and its implementing regulations require cable operators either to scramble a sexually
explicit channel in full or to limit the channel's programming
to the hours between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. 47 U. S. C. $ 561
(1994 ed., Supp. III); 47 CFR $ 76.227 (1999). Section 505
was added by floor amendment, without significant debate, to
the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (Act), a major legislative
effort designed "to reduce regulation and encourage `the
rapid deployment of new telecommunications technologies.' "

Opinion of the Court
On March 7, 1996, Playboy obtained a temporary restraining order (TRO) enjoining the enforcement of $ 505. 918
F. Supp. 813 (Del.), and brought this suit in a three-judge
District Court pursuant to $ 561 of the Act, 110 Stat. 142,
note following 47 U. S. C. $ 223 (1994 ed., Supp. III). Playboy sought a declaration that $ 505 violates the Constitution
and an injunction prohibiting the law's enforcement. The
District Court denied Playboy a preliminary injunction, 945
F. Supp. 772 (Del. 1996), and we summarily affirmed, 520
U. S. 1141 (1997). The TRO was lifted, and the Federal
Communications Commission announced it would begin enforcing $ 505 on May 18, 1997. In re Implementation of Section 505 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, 12 FCC
Rcd. 5212, 5214 (1997).

When the statute became operative, most cable operators
had "no practical choice but to curtail [the targeted] programming during the [regulated] sixteen hours or risk the
penalties imposed . . . if any audio or video signal bleed occur[red] during [those] times." 30 F. Supp. 2d, at 711. The
majority of operators--"in one survey, 69%"--complied with

$ 505 by time channeling the targeted programmers. Ibid.
Since "30 to 50% of all adult programming is viewed by
households prior to 10 p.m.," the result was a significant restriction of communication, with a corresponding reduction
in Playboy's revenues. Ibid.

In March 1998, the District Court held a full trial and concluded that $ 505 violates the First Amendment. Id., at 702.
The District Court observed that $ 505 imposed a contentbased restriction on speech. Id., at 714-715. It agreed that
the interests the statute advanced were compelling but concluded the Government might further those interests in less
restrictive ways. Id., at 717-720. One plausible, less restrictive alternative could be found in another section of the
Act: $ 504, which requires a cable operator, "[u]pon request
by a cable service subscriber . . . without charge, [to] fully

$ 560 (1994 ed., Supp. III). As long as subscribers knewabout this opportunity, the court reasoned, $ 504 would provide as much protection against unwanted programming aswould $ 505. 30 F. Supp. 2d, at 718-720. At the same time,

$ 504 was content neutral and would be less restrictive ofPlayboy's First Amendment rights.

Ibid.The court described what "adequate notice" would include, suggesting

"[operators] should communicate to their subscribers theinformation that certain channels broadcast sexuallyoriented programming; that signal bleed . . . may appear;that children may view signal bleed without their parents' knowledge or permission; that channel blockingdevices . . . are available free of charge . . . ; and that a
request for a free device . . . can be made by a telephonecall to the [operator]."

Id., at 719.

The means of providing this notice could include

"inserts in monthly billing statements, barker channels(preview channels of programming coming up on PayPer-View), and on-air advertisement on channels otherthan the one broadcasting the sexually explicit programming." Ibid.
The court added that this notice could be "conveyed on aregular basis, at reasonable intervals," and could include notice of changes in channel alignments. Ibid.The District Court concluded that $ 504 so supplemented
would be an effective, less restrictive alternative to $ 505,and consequently declared $ 505 unconstitutional and enjoined its enforcement. Id., at 719-720. The court also re-quired Playboy to insist on these notice provisions in its contracts with cable operators. Ibid.The United States filed a direct appeal in this Court pursuant to $ 561. The District Court thereafter dismissed for

Two essential points should be understood concerning thespeech at issue here. First, we shall assume that many

adults themselves would find the material highly offensive;and when we consider the further circumstance that the material comes unwanted into homes where children might seeor hear it against parental wishes or consent, there are legitimate reasons for regulating it. Second, all parties bring thecase to us on the premise that Playboy's programming has
First Amendment protection. As this case has been liti-gated, it is not alleged to be obscene; adults have a constitutional right to view it; the Government disclaims any interestin preventing children from seeing or hearing it with the
consent of their parents; and Playboy has concomitant rightsunder the First Amendment to transmit it. These points
are undisputed.The speech in question is defined by its content; and the
statute which seeks to restrict it is content based. Section505 applies only to channels primarily dedicated to "sexually
explicit adult programming or other programming that is in-decent." The statute is unconcerned with signal bleed from
any other channels. See 945 F. Supp., at 785 ("[Section 505]does not apply when signal bleed occurs on other premium
channel networks, like HBO or the Disney Channel"). Theoverriding justification for the regulation is concern for the
effect of the subject matter on young viewers. Section 505is not " `justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech.' " Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S.781, 791 (1989) (quoting

Clark v. Community for CreativeNon-Violence, 468 U. S. 288, 293 (1984)). It "focuses only

on the content of the speech and the direct impact thatspeech has on its listeners."

Boos v. Barry, 485 U. S. 312,

GROUP, INC.

Opinion of the Court

321 (1988) (opinion of O'Connor, J.). This is the essence ofcontent-based regulation.

Not only does $ 505 single out particular programming con-tent for regulation, it also singles out particular programmers. The speech in question was not thought by Congressto be so harmful that all channels were subject to restriction.
Instead, the statutory disability applies only to channels
"primarily dedicated to sexually-oriented programming."47 U. S. C. $ 561(a) (1994 ed., Supp. III). One sponsor of the

measure even identified appellee by name. See 141 Cong.Rec. 15587 (1995) (statement of Sen. Feinstein) (noting the
statute would apply to channels "such as the Playboy and
Spice channels"). Laws designed or intended to suppress or
restrict the expression of specific speakers contradict basic
First Amendment principles. Section 505 limited Playboy's
market as a penalty for its programming choice, though other
channels capable of transmitting like material are altogether exempt.

The effect of the federal statute on the protected speech
is now apparent. It is evident that the only reasonable way
for a substantial number of cable operators to comply with
the letter of $ 505 is to time channel, which silences the protected speech for two-thirds of the day in every home in a
cable service area, regardless of the presence or likely presence of children or of the wishes of the viewers. According
to the District Court, "30 to 50% of all adult programming is
viewed by households prior to 10 p.m.," when the safe-harbor
period begins. 30 F. Supp. 2d, at 711. To prohibit this
much speech is a significant restriction of communication between speakers and willing adult listeners, communication
which enjoys First Amendment protection. It is of no moment that the statute does not impose a complete prohibition. The distinction between laws burdening and laws banning speech is but a matter of degree. The Government's
content-based burdens must satisfy the same rigorous scrutiny as its content-based bans.

Opinion of the Court
Since $ 505 is a content-based speech restriction, it canstand only if it satisfies strict scrutiny.

Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U. S. 115, 126 (1989). If astatute regulates speech based on its content, it must be narrowly tailored to promote a compelling Government interest.
Ibid. If a less restrictive alternative would serve the Government's purpose, the legislature must use that alternative.
Reno, 521 U. S., at 874 ("[The CDA's Internet indecency pro-visions'] burden on adult speech is unacceptable if less restrictive alternatives would be at least as effective in achiev-ing the legitimate purpose that the statute was enacted to
serve"); Sable Communications, supra, at 126 ("The Government may . . . regulate the content of constitutionally
protected speech in order to promote a compelling interest
if it chooses the least restrictive means to further the articulated interest"). To do otherwise would be to restrict
speech without an adequate justification, a course the First
Amendment does not permit.

Our precedents teach these principles. Where the designed benefit of a content-based speech restriction is to
shield the sensibilities of listeners, the general rule is that
the right of expression prevails, even where no less restrictive alternative exists. We are expected to protect our own
sensibilities "simply by averting [our] eyes." Cohen v. California, 403 U. S. 15, 21 (1971); accord, Erznoznik v. Jacksonville, 422 U. S. 205, 210-211 (1975). Here, of course, we consider images transmitted to some homes where they are not
wanted and where parents often are not present to give immediate guidance. Cable television, like broadcast media,
presents unique problems, which inform our assessment of
the interests at stake, and which may justify restrictions
that would be unacceptable in other contexts. See Denver

GROUP, INC.

Opinion of the Court

U. S. 726 (1978). No one suggests the Government must beindifferent to unwanted, indecent speech that comes into the

home without parental consent. The speech here, all agree,is protected speech; and the question is what standard the
Government must meet in order to restrict it. As we con-sider a content-based regulation, the answer should be clear:
The standard is strict scrutiny. This case involves speech
alone; and even where speech is indecent and enters thehome, the objective of shielding children does not suffice to

support a blanket ban if the protection can be accomplishedby a less restrictive alternative.

In Sable Communications, for instance, the feasibility of
a technological approach to controlling minors' access to
"dial-a-porn" messages required invalidation of a complete
statutory ban on the medium. 492 U. S., at 130-131. And,
while mentioned only in passing, the mere possibility that
user-based Internet screening software would " `soon be
widely available' " was relevant to our rejection of an overbroad restriction of indecent cyberspeech. Reno, supra, at
876-877. Compare Rowan v. Post Office Dept., 397 U. S.
728, 729-730 (1970) (upholding statute "whereby any householder may insulate himself from advertisements that offer
for sale `matter which the addressee in his sole discretion
believes to be erotically arousing or sexually provocative' "
(quoting then 39 U. S. C. $ 4009(a) (1964 ed., Supp. IV))), with
Bolger v. Youngs Drug Products Corp., 463 U. S. 60, 75
(1983) (rejecting blanket ban on the mailing of unsolicited
contraceptive advertisements). Compare also Ginsberg v.
New York, 390 U. S. 629, 631 (1968) (upholding state statute
barring the sale to minors of material defined as "obscene on
the basis of its appeal to them"), with Butler v. Michigan,
352 U. S. 380, 381 (1957) (rejecting blanket ban of material
" `tending to incite minors to violent or depraved or immoral
acts, manifestly tending to the corruption of the morals of
youth' " (quoting then Mich. Penal Code $ 343)). Each of
these cases arose in a different context--Sable Communica529US3 Unit: $U60 [09-26-01 12:39:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
tions and Reno, for instance, also note the affirmative stepsnecessary to obtain access to indecent material via the media

at issue--but they provide necessary instruction for comply-ing with accepted First Amendment principles.

Our zoning cases, on the other hand, are irrelevant to thequestion here.

Post, at 838 (Breyer, J., dissenting) (citing
Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U. S. 41 (1986), and
Young v. American Mini Theatres, Inc., 427 U. S. 50 (1976)).We have made clear that the lesser scrutiny afforded regulations targeting the secondary effects of crime or decliningproperty values has no application to content-based regulations targeting the primary effects of protected speech.
Reno, supra, at 867-868; Boos, 485 U. S., at 320-321. The
statute now before us burdens speech because of its content;
it must receive strict scrutiny.

There is, moreover, a key difference between cable television and the broadcasting media, which is the point on which
this case turns: Cable systems have the capacity to block
unwanted channels on a household-by-household basis. The
option to block reduces the likelihood, so concerning to the
Court in Pacifica, supra, at 744, that traditional First
Amendment scrutiny would deprive the Government of all
authority to address this sort of problem. The corollary, of
course, is that targeted blocking enables the Government to
support parental authority without affecting the First
Amendment interests of speakers and willing listeners--listeners for whom, if the speech is unpopular or indecent, the
privacy of their own homes may be the optimal place of receipt. Simply put, targeted blocking is less restrictive than
banning, and the Government cannot ban speech if targeted
blocking is a feasible and effective means of furthering its
compelling interests. This is not to say that the absence of
an effective blocking mechanism will in all cases suffice to
support a law restricting the speech in question; but if a less
restrictive means is available for the Government to achieve
its goals, the Government must use it.

Opinion of the Court

III
The District Court concluded that a less restrictive al-ternative is available: $ 504, with adequate publicity. 30

F. Supp. 2d, at 719-720. No one disputes that $ 504, whichrequires cable operators to block undesired channels at individual households upon request, is narrowly tailored to theGovernment's goal of supporting parents who want those
channels blocked. The question is whether $ 504 can beeffective.

When a plausible, less restrictive alternative is offered toa content-based speech restriction, it is the Government's obligation to prove that the alternative will be ineffective toachieve its goals. The Government has not met that burden
here. In support of its position, the Government citesempirical evidence showing that $ 504, as promulgated and
implemented before trial, generated few requests forhousehold-by-household blocking. Between March 1996 and
May 1997, while the Government was enjoined from enforc-ing $ 505, $ 504 remained in operation. A survey of cable
operators determined that fewer than 0.5% of cable subscrib-ers requested full blocking during that time. Id., at 712.
The uncomfortable fact is that $ 504 was the sole blockingregulation in effect for over a year; and the public greeted it
with a collective yawn.The District Court was correct to direct its attention to
the import of this tepid response. Placing the burden ofproof upon the Government, the District Court examined
whether $ 504 was capable of serving as an effective, lessrestrictive means of reaching the Government's goals.

Id.,at 715, 718-719. It concluded that $ 504, if publicized in an

adequate manner, could be. Id., at 719-720.The District Court employed the proper approach. When
the Government restricts speech, the Government bearsthe burden of proving the constitutionality of its actions.

the burden of identifying a substantial interest and justi-fying the challenged restriction");

Reno, 521 U. S., at 879
("The breadth of this content-based restriction of speechimposes an especially heavy burden on the Government to

explain why a less restrictive provision would not be aseffective . . .");

Edenfield v. Fane, 507 U. S. 761, 770-771
(1993) ("[A] governmental body seeking to sustain a restriction on commercial speech must demonstrate that the harmsit recites are real and that its restriction will in fact alleviate

U. S. 503, 509 (1969) ("In order for the State . . . to justify
prohibition of a particular expression of opinion, it must be
able to show that its action was caused by something more
than a mere desire to avoid the discomfort and unpleasantness that always accompany an unpopular viewpoint").
When the Government seeks to restrict speech based on its
content, the usual presumption of constitutionality afforded
congressional enactments is reversed. "Content-based regulations are presumptively invalid," R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505
U. S. 377, 382 (1992), and the Government bears the burden
to rebut that presumption.

This is for good reason. "[T]he line between speech unconditionally guaranteed and speech which may legitimately
be regulated, suppressed, or punished is finely drawn."
Speiser v. Randall, 357 U. S. 513, 525 (1958). Error in marking that line exacts an extraordinary cost. It is through
speech that our convictions and beliefs are influenced, expressed, and tested. It is through speech that we bring
those beliefs to bear on Government and on society. It is
through speech that our personalities are formed and expressed. The citizen is entitled to seek out or reject certain
ideas or influences without Government interference or
control.

818 UNITED STATES v. PLAYBOY ENTERTAINMENT

GROUP, INC.

Opinion of the Court

When a student first encounters our free speech jurisprudence, he or she might think it is influenced by the philosophy that one idea is as good as any other, and that in art
and literature objective standards of style, taste, decorum,
beauty, and esthetics are deemed by the Constitution to be
inappropriate, indeed unattainable. Quite the opposite is
true. The Constitution no more enforces a relativistic philosophy or moral nihilism than it does any other point of
view. The Constitution exists precisely so that opinions and
judgments, including esthetic and moral judgments about art
and literature, can be formed, tested, and expressed. What
the Constitution says is that these judgments are for the
individual to make, not for the Government to decree, even
with the mandate or approval of a majority. Technology expands the capacity to choose; and it denies the potential of
this revolution if we assume the Government is best positioned to make these choices for us.

It is rare that a regulation restricting speech because of
its content will ever be permissible. Indeed, were we to
give the Government the benefit of the doubt when it attempted to restrict speech, we would risk leaving regulations in place that sought to shape our unique personalities
or to silence dissenting ideas. When First Amendment compliance is the point to be proved, the risk of nonpersuasion--
operative in all trials--must rest with the Government, not
with the citizen. Id., at 526.

With this burden in mind, the District Court explored
three explanations for the lack of individual blocking requests. 30 F. Supp. 2d, at 719. First, individual blocking
might not be an effective alternative, due to technological or
other limitations. Second, although an adequately advertised blocking provision might have been effective, $ 504 as
written did not require sufficient notice to make it so.
Third, the actual signal bleed problem might be far less of a
concern than the Government at first had supposed. Ibid.

529US3 Unit: $U60 [09-26-01 12:39:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN

819Cite as: 529 U. S. 803 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
To sustain its statute, the Government was required to
show that the first was the right answer. According to the
District Court, however, the first and third possibilities were
"equally consistent" with the record before it. Ibid. As for
the second, the record was "not clear" as to whether enough
notice had been issued to give $ 504 a fighting chance. Ibid.
The case, then, was at best a draw. Unless the District
Court's findings are clearly erroneous, the tie goes to free
expression.

The District Court began with the problem of signal bleed
itself, concluding "the Government has not convinced us that
[signal bleed] is a pervasive problem." Id., at 708-709, 718.
The District Court's thorough discussion exposes a central
weakness in the Government's proof: There is little hard evidence of how widespread or how serious the problem of signal bleed is. Indeed, there is no proof as to how likely any
child is to view a discernible explicit image, and no proof of
the duration of the bleed or the quality of the pictures or
sound. To say that millions of children are subject to a risk
of viewing signal bleed is one thing; to avoid articulating the
true nature and extent of the risk is quite another. Under

$ 505, sanctionable signal bleed can include instances as
fleeting as an image appearing on a screen for just a few
seconds. The First Amendment requires a more careful assessment and characterization of an evil in order to justify a
regulation as sweeping as this. Although the parties have
taken the additional step of lodging with the Court an assortment of videotapes, some of which show quite explicit bleeding and some of which show television static or snow, there
is no attempt at explanation or context; there is no discussion, for instance, of the extent to which any particular tape
is representative of what appears on screens nationwide.

The Government relied at trial on anecdotal evidence to
support its regulation, which the District Court summarized
as follows:

529US3 Unit: $U60 [09-26-01 12:39:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN
820 UNITED STATES v. PLAYBOY ENTERTAINMENT

GROUP, INC.

Opinion of the Court

"The Government presented evidence of two city
councillors, eighteen individuals, one United States Senator, and the officials of one city who complained either
to their [cable operator], to their local Congressman, or
to the FCC about viewing signal bleed on television. In
each instance, the local [cable operator] offered to, or did
in fact, rectify the situation for free (with the exception
of 1 individual), with varying degrees of rapidity. Included in the complaints was the additional concern that
other parents might not be aware that their children are
exposed to this problem. In addition, the Government
presented evidence of a child exposed to signal bleed at
a friend's house. Cindy Omlin set the lockout feature
on her remote control to prevent her child from tuning
to adult channels, but her eleven year old son was nevertheless exposed to signal bleed when he attended a
slumber party at a friend's house.

"The Government has presented evidence of only a
handful of isolated incidents over the 16 years since 1982
when Playboy started broadcasting. The Government
has not presented any survey-type evidence on the magnitude of the `problem.' " Id., at 709 (footnote and record citations omitted).

Spurred by the District Court's express request for more
specific evidence of the problem, see 945 F. Supp., at 779,
n. 16, the Government also presented an expert's spreadsheet estimate that 39 million homes with 29.5 million children had the potential to be exposed to signal bleed, 30
F. Supp. 2d, at 708-709. The Government made no attempt
to confirm the accuracy of its estimate through surveys or
other field tests, however. Accordingly, the District Court
discounted the figures and made this finding: "[T]he Government presented no evidence on the number of households
actually exposed to signal bleed and thus has not quantified
the actual extent of the problem of signal bleed." Id., at

529US3 Unit: $U60 [09-26-01 12:39:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN

821Cite as: 529 U. S. 803 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
709. The finding is not clearly erroneous; indeed it is allbut required.

Once $ 505 went into effect, of course, a significant percent-age of cable operators felt it necessary to time channel their
sexually explicit programmers. Id., at 711, and n. 14. Thisis an indication that scrambling technology is not yet perfected. That is not to say, however, that scrambling is
completely ineffective. Different cable systems use differ-ent scrambling systems, which vary in their dependability.

"The severity of the problem varies from time to time andplace to place, depending on the weather, the quality of the
equipment, its installation, and maintenance." Id., at 708.
At even the good end of the spectrum a system might bleed
to an extent sufficient to trigger the time-channeling requirement for a cautious cable operator. (The statute requires
the signal to be "fully block[ed]." 47 U. S. C. $ 561(a) (1994
ed., Supp. III) (emphasis added).) A rational cable operator,
faced with the possibility of sanctions for intermittent bleeding, could well choose to time channel even if the bleeding is
too momentary to pose any concern to most households. To
affirm that the Government failed to prove the existence of
a problem, while at the same time observing that the statute
imposes a severe burden on speech, is consistent with the
analysis our cases require. Here, there is no probative evidence in the record which differentiates among the extent of
bleed at individual households and no evidence which otherwise quantifies the signal bleed problem.

In addition, market-based solutions such as programmable
televisions, VCR's, and mapping systems (which display a
blue screen when tuned to a scrambled signal) may eliminate
signal bleed at the consumer end of the cable. 30 F. Supp.
2d, at 708. Playboy made the point at trial that the Government's estimate failed to account for these factors. Id., at
708-709. Without some sort of field survey, it is impossible
to know how widespread the problem in fact is, and the only
indicator in the record is a handful of complaints. Cf.

Opinion of the Court

Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 520 U. S. 180, 187
(1997) (reviewing " `a record of tens of thousands of pages' of
evidence" developed through "three years of pre-enactment
hearings, . . . as well as additional expert submissions, sworn
declarations and testimony, and industry documents" in support of complex must-carry provisions). If the number of
children transfixed by even flickering pornographic television images in fact reached into the millions we, like the
District Court, would have expected to be directed to more
than a handful of complaints.

No support for the restriction can be found in the near
barren legislative record relevant to this provision. Section
505 was added to the Act by floor amendment, accompanied
by only brief statements, and without committee hearing or
debate. See 141 Cong. Rec. 15586-15589 (1995). One of the
measure's sponsors did indicate she considered time channeling to be superior to voluntary blocking, which "put[s] the
burden of action on the subscriber, not the cable company."
Id., at 15587 (statement of Sen. Feinstein). This sole conclusory statement, however, tells little about the relative efficacy of voluntary blocking versus time channeling, other
than offering the unhelpful, self-evident generality that voluntary measures require voluntary action. The Court has
declined to rely on similar evidence before. See Sable Communications, 492 U. S., at 129-130 ("[A]side from conclusory
statements during the debates by proponents of the bill, . . .
the congressional record presented to us contains no evidence as to how effective or ineffective the . . . regulations
were or might prove to be" (footnote omitted)); Reno, 521
U. S., at 858, and n. 24, 875-876, n. 41 (same). This is not to
suggest that a 10,000-page record must be compiled in every

Opinion of the Court
the Government has failed to establish a pervasive, nation-wide problem justifying its nationwide daytime speech ban.

Nor did the District Court err in its second conclusion.The Government also failed to prove $ 504 with adequate notice would be an ineffective alternative to $ 505. Once again,the District Court invited the Government to produce its
proof. See 945 F. Supp., at 781 ("If the $ 504 blocking option
is not being promoted, it cannot become a meaningful alter-native to the provisions of $ 505. At the time of the permanent injunction hearing, further evidence of the actual andpredicted impact and efficacy of $ 504 would be helpful
to us"). Once again, the Government fell short. See 30
F. Supp. 2d, at 719 ("[The Government's argument that $ 504
is ineffective] is premised on adequate notice to subscribers.
It is not clear, however, from the record that notices of the
provisions of $ 504 have been adequate"). There is no evidence that a well-promoted voluntary blocking provision
would not be capable at least of informing parents about signal bleed (if they are not yet aware of it) and about their
rights to have the bleed blocked (if they consider it a problem
and have not yet controlled it themselves).

The Government finds at least two problems with the conclusion of the three-judge District Court. First, the Government takes issue with the District Court's reliance, without proof, on a "hypothetical, enhanced version of Section
504." Brief for Appellants 32. It was not the District
Court's obligation, however, to predict the extent to which
an improved notice scheme would improve $ 504. It was for
the Government, presented with a plausible, less restrictive
alternative, to prove the alternative to be ineffective, and

$ 505 to be the least restrictive available means. Indeed, to
the extent the District Court erred, it was only in attempting
to implement the less restrictive alternative through judicial
decree by requiring Playboy to provide for expanded notice
in its cable service contracts. The appropriate remedy was
not to repair the statute, it was to enjoin the speech restric529US3 Unit: $U60 [09-26-01 12:39:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN

GROUP, INC.

Opinion of the Court

tion. Given the existence of a less restrictive means, if theLegislature wished to improve its statute, perhaps in the

process giving careful consideration to other alternatives, itthen could do so.

The Government also contends a publicized $ 504 will bejust as restrictive as $ 505, on the theory that the cost of
installing blocking devices will outstrip the revenues from
distributing Playboy's programming and lead to its cancella-tion. See 30 F. Supp. 2d, at 713. This conclusion rests on

the assumption that a sufficient percentage of households,informed of the potential for signal bleed, would consider it
enough of a problem to order blocking devices--an assumption for which there is no support in the record. Id., at 719.
It should be noted, furthermore, that Playboy is willing to
incur the costs of an effective $ 504. One might infer that
Playboy believes an advertised $ 504 will be ineffective for
its object, or one might infer the company believes the signal
bleed problem is not widespread. In the absence of proof,
it is not for the Court to assume the former.

It is no response that voluntary blocking requires a consumer to take action, or may be inconvenient, or may not go
perfectly every time. A court should not assume a plausible, less restrictive alternative would be ineffective; and a
court should not presume parents, given full information,
will fail to act. If unresponsive operators are a concern,
moreover, a notice statute could give cable operators ample
incentive, through fines or other penalties for noncompliance,
to respond to blocking requests in prompt and efficient
fashion.

Having adduced no evidence in the District Court showing
that an adequately advertised $ 504 would not be effective to
aid desirous parents in keeping signal bleed out of their own
households, the Government can now cite nothing in the record to support the point. The Government instead takes
quite a different approach. After only an offhand suggestion that the success of a well-communicated $ 504 is "highly

Opinion of the Court
unlikely," the Government sets the point aside, arguing in-stead that society's independent interests will be unserved if

parents fail to act on that information. Brief for Appellants32-33 ("[U]nder . . . an enhanced version of Section 504, parents who had strong feelings about the matter could see toit that their children did not view signal bleed--at least in
their own homes"); id., at 33 ("Even an enhanced version of
Section 504 would succeed in blocking signal bleed only if,and after, parents affirmatively decided to avail themselves

of the means offered them to do so. There would certainlybe parents--perhaps a large number of parents--who out of
inertia, indifference, or distraction, simply would take no action to block signal bleed, even if fully informed of the problem and even if offered a relatively easy solution"); Reply
Brief for Appellants 12 ("[Society's] interest would of course
be served in instances . . . in which parents request blocking
under an enhanced Section 504. But in cases in which parents fail to make use of an enhanced Section 504 procedure
out of distraction, inertia, or indifference, Section 505 would
be the only means to protect society's independent interest").

Even upon the assumption that the Government has an
interest in substituting itself for informed and empowered
parents, its interest is not sufficiently compelling to justify
this widespread restriction on speech. The Government's
argument stems from the idea that parents do not know their
children are viewing the material on a scale or frequency
to cause concern, or if so, that parents do not want to take
affirmative steps to block it and their decisions are to be
superseded. The assumptions have not been established;
and in any event the assumptions apply only in a regime
where the option of blocking has not been explained. The
whole point of a publicized $ 504 would be to advise parents
that indecent material may be shown and to afford them an
opportunity to block it at all times, even when they are not
at home and even after 10 p.m. Time channeling does not
offer this assistance. The regulatory alternative of a publi529US3 Unit: $U60 [09-26-01 12:39:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN

GROUP, INC.

Opinion of the Court

cized $ 504, which has the real possibility of promoting moreopen disclosure and the choice of an effective blocking system, would provide parents the information needed to en-gage in active supervision. The Government has not shown
that this alternative, a regime of added communication andsupport, would be insufficient to secure its objective, or that
any overriding harm justifies its intervention.There can be little doubt, of course, that under a voluntary
blocking regime, even with adequate notice, some childrenwill be exposed to signal bleed; and we need not discount the
possibility that a graphic image could have a negative impacton a young child. It must be remembered, however, that
children will be exposed to signal bleed under time channel-ing as well. Time channeling, unlike blocking, does not
eliminate signal bleed around the clock. Just as adolescentsmay be unsupervised outside of their own households, it is
hardly unknown for them to be unsupervised in front of thetelevision set after 10 p.m. The record is silent as to the
comparative effectiveness of the two alternatives.

Basic speech principles are at stake in this case. Whenthe purpose and design of a statute is to regulate speech by

reason of its content, special consideration or latitude is notaccorded to the Government merely because the law can
somehow be described as a burden rather than outright sup-pression. We cannot be influenced, moreover, by the perception that the regulation in question is not a major onebecause the speech is not very important. The history of
the law of free expression is one of vindication in cases in-volving speech that many citizens may find shabby, offensive,
or even ugly. It follows that all content-based restrictionson speech must give us more than a moment's pause. If
television broadcasts can expose children to the real risk ofharmful exposure to indecent materials, even in their own
home and without parental consent, there is a problem the

Government can address. It must do so, however, in a wayconsistent with First Amendment principles. Here the Government has not met the burden the First Amendmentimposes.

The Government has failed to show that $ 505 is the leastrestrictive means for addressing a real problem; and the District Court did not err in holding the statute violative of the
First Amendment. In light of our ruling, it is unnecessary
to address the second question presented: whether the District Court was divested of jurisdiction to consider the Government's postjudgment motions after the Government filed
a notice of appeal in this Court. The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.

It is so ordered.

Because Justice Scalia has advanced an argument that
the parties have not addressed, a brief response is in order.
Relying on Ginzburg v. United States, 383 U. S. 463 (1966),
Justice Scalia would treat programs whose content is, he
assumes, protected by the First Amendment as though they
were obscene because of the way they are advertised. The
four separate dissenting opinions in Ginzburg, authored by
Justices Black, Harlan, Douglas, and Stewart, amply demonstrated the untenable character of the Ginzburg decision
when it was rendered. The Ginzburg theory of obscenity is
a legal fiction premised upon a logical bait and switch; adver529US3 Unit: $U60 [09-26-01 12:39:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tising a bareheaded dancer as "topless" might be deceptive,but it would not make her performance obscene.

As I explained in my dissent in Splawn v. California, 431U. S. 595, 602 (1977),

Ginzburg was decided before the Court
extended First Amendment protection to commercial speech,
Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer
Council, Inc., 425 U. S. 748 (1976). Justice Scalia's proposal is thus not only anachronistic, it also overlooks a keypremise upon which our commercial speech cases are based.

The First Amendment assumes that, as a general matter,"information is not in itself harmful, that people will perceive
their own best interests if only they are well enough in-formed, and that the best means to that end is to open the
channels of communication rather than to close them." Id.,
at 770. The very fact that the programs marketed by Playboy are offensive to many viewers provides a justification for
protecting, not penalizing, truthful statements about their
content.

Justice Thomas, concurring.
It would seem to me that, with respect to at least some of
the cable programming affected by $ 505 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the Government has ample constitutional
and statutory authority to prohibit its broadcast entirely. A
governmental restriction on the distribution of obscene
materials receives no First Amendment scrutiny. Roth v.
United States, 354 U. S. 476, 485 (1957). Though perhaps
not all of the programming at issue in the case is obscene as
this Court defined the term in Miller v. California, 413 U. S.
15, 24 (1973), one could fairly conclude that, under the standards applicable in many communities, some of the programming meets the Miller test. If this is so, the Government
is empowered by statute to sanction these broadcasts with
criminal penalties. See 47 U. S. C. $ 559 (1994 ed., Supp. III)
("Whoever transmits over any cable system any matter
which is obscene or otherwise unprotected by the Constitu529US3 Unit: $U60 [09-26-01 12:39:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tion of the United States shall be fined under title 18 or im-prisoned not more than 2 years, or both").*

However, as the Court points out, this case has been liti-gated on the assumption that the programming at issue is
not obscene, but merely indecent. We have no factual find-ing that any of the materials at issue are, in fact, obscene.
Indeed, the District Court described the materials as inde-cent but not obscene. 945 F. Supp. 772, 774, n. 4 (Del. 1996).
The Government does not challenge that characterization inthis Court, Tr. of Oral Arg. 9-10, but instead asks this Court
to ratify the statute on the assumption that this is protectedspeech. I am unwilling, in the absence of factual findings or
advocacy of the position, to rely on the view that some of therelevant programming is obscene.

What remains then is the assumption that the program-ming restricted by $ 505 is not obscene, but merely indecent.
The Government, having declined to defend the statute as aregulation of obscenity, now asks us to dilute our stringent
First Amendment standards to uphold $ 505 as a proper reg-ulation of protected (rather than unprotected) speech. See
Brief for Appellants 18-29 (arguing that traditional strictscrutiny does not apply). I am unwilling to corrupt the
First Amendment to reach this result. The "starch" in ourconstitutional standards cannot be sacrificed to accommodate
the enforcement choices of the Government. See DenverArea Ed. Telecommunications Consortium, Inc. v. FCC, 518
U. S. 727, 774 (1996) (Souter, J., concurring) ("Reviewing

*I am referring, here, to unscrambled programming on the Playboy and
Spice channels, examples of which were lodged with the Court. The Government also lodged videotapes containing signal bleed from these channels. I assume that if the unscrambled programming on these channels
is obscene, any scrambled but discernible images from the programs would
be obscene as well. In fact, some of the examples of signal bleed contained in the record may fall within our definition of obscenity more easily
than would the unscrambled programming because it is difficult to dispute
that signal bleed "lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific
value." Miller v. California, 413 U. S. 15, 24 (1973).

speech regulations under fairly strict categorical rules keepsthe starch in the standards for those moments when the daily

politics cries loudest for limiting what may be said").Applying the First Amendment's exacting standards, the
Court has correctly determined that $ 505 cannot be upheldon the theory argued by the Government. Accordingly,
I join the opinion of the Court.

Justice Scalia, dissenting.
I agree with the principal dissent in this case that $ 505 ofthe Telecommunications Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104-104, 110

Stat. 136, 47 U. S. C. $ 561 (1994 ed., Supp. III), is supportedby a compelling state interest and is narrowly tailored. I
write separately to express my view that $ 505 can be upheldin simpler fashion: by finding that it regulates the business
of obscenity.

To be sure, $ 505 and the Federal Communications Commission's implementing regulation, see 47 CFR $ 76.227
(1999), purport to capture programming that is indecent
rather than merely that which is obscene. And I will assume for purposes of this discussion (though it is a highly
fanciful assumption) that none of the transmissions at issue
independently crosses the boundary we have established for
obscenity, see Miller v. California, 413 U. S. 15, 24 (1973), so
that the individual programs themselves would enjoy First
Amendment protection. In my view, however, that assumption does not put an end to the inquiry.

We have recognized that commercial entities which engage
in "the sordid business of pandering" by "deliberately emphasiz[ing] the sexually provocative aspects of [their nonobscene products], in order to catch the salaciously disposed,"
engage in constitutionally unprotected behavior. Ginzburg

(1964) (Warren, C. J., dissenting) ("In my opinion, the useto which various materials are put--not just the words and
pictures themselves--must be considered in determiningwhether or not the materials are obscene"). This is so
whether or not the products in which the business trafficsindependently meet the high hurdle we have established for
delineating the obscene, viz., that they contain no "seriousliterary, artistic, political, or scientific value."

Miller,supra, at 24. See Ginzburg, 383 U. S., at 471. We are more

permissive of government regulation in these circumstancesbecause it is clear from the context in which exchanges between such businesses and their customers occur that nei-ther the merchant nor the buyer is interested in the work's
literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. "The deliber-ate representation of petitioner's publications as erotically
arousing . . . stimulate[s] the reader to accept them as pruri-ent; he looks for titillation, not for saving intellectual content." Id., at 470. Thus, a business that "(1) offer[s] . . .hardcore sexual material, (2) as a constant and intentional
objective of [its] business, [and] (3) seek[s] to promote it assuch" finds no sanctuary in the First Amendment.

FW/PBS, supra, at 261 (
Scalia J., concurring in part and dis-senting in part).

Section 505 regulates just this sort of business. Its cover-age is limited to programming that "describes or depicts sexual or excretory activities or organs in a patently offensive
manner as measured by contemporary community standards[for cable television]." 47 CFR $ 76.227(d) (1999) (emphasis

added). It furthermore applies only to those channels thatare "

primarily dedicated to sexually-oriented program-ming."

might not hold itself forth as primarily dedicated to sex--in
which case its productions which contain "serious literary,
artistic, political, or scientific value" (if any) would be as entitled to First Amendment protection as the statuary rooms of
the National Gallery. But in the competitive world of cable
programming, the possibility that a channel devoted to sex
would not advertise itself as such is sufficiently remote, and
the number of such channels sufficiently small (if not indeed
nonexistent), as not to render the provision substantially
overbroad.2

Playboy itself illustrates the type of business $ 505 is designed to reach. Playboy provides, through its networks--
Playboy Television, AdulTVision, Adam & Eve, and Spice--

2 Justice Stevens misapprehends in several respects the nature of the
test I would apply. First, he mistakenly believes that the nature of the
advertising controls the obscenity analysis, regardless of the nature of the
material being advertised. I entirely agree with him that "advertising a
bareheaded dancer as `topless' might be deceptive, but it would not make
her performance obscene." Ante, at 828-829 (concurring opinion). I believe, however, that if the material is "patently offensive" and it is being
advertised as such, we have little reason to think it is being proffered for
its socially redeeming value.

Justice Stevens's second misapprehension flows from the first: He
sees the test I would apply as incompatible with the Court's commercialspeech jurisprudence. See ante, at 829 (concurring opinion); see also
Splawn v. California, 431 U. S. 595, 603, n. 2 (1977) (Stevens, J., dissenting) ("Ginzburg cannot survive [Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia
Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U. S. 748 (1976)]"). There is no
such conflict. Although the Ginzburg test, like most obscenity tests, has
ordinarily been applied in a commercial context (most purveyors of obscenity are in the business for the money), its logic is not restricted to that
context. The test applies equally to the improbable case in which a collector of indecent materials wishes to give them away, and takes out a classified ad in the local newspaper touting their salacious appeal. Commercial
motive or not, the " `[c]ircumstances of . . . dissemination are relevant to
determining whether [the] social importance claimed for [the] material
[is] . . . pretense or reality.' " Splawn, supra, at 598 (quoting jury instruction approved). Perhaps this is why the Court in Splawn did not accept
Justice Stevens's claim of incompatibility.

"virtually 100% sexually explicit adult programming." 30F. Supp. 2d 702, 707 (Del. 1998). For example, on its Spice

network, Playboy describes its own programming as depict-ing such activities as "female masturbation/external," "girl/
girl sex," and "oral sex/cunnilingus." 1 Record, Exh. 73,p. TWC00132. As one would expect, given this content,
Playboy advertises accordingly, with calls to "Enjoy the sexiest, hottest adult movies in the privacy of your own home."6

id., Exh. 136, at 2P009732. An example of the promotion
for a particular movie is as follows: "Little miss country girlsare aching for a quick roll in the hay! Watch southern hospitality pull out all the stops as these ravin' nymphos teardown the barn and light up the big country sky." 7

id., Exh.
226, at 2P009187. One may doubt whether--or marvelthat--this sort of embarrassingly juvenile promotion really

attracts what Playboy assures us is an "adult" audience.But it is certainly marketing sex.

Thus, while I agree with Justice Breyer's childprotection analysis, it leaves me with the same feeling of

3 Both the Court, see ante, at 811, and Justice Thomas, see ante, at
830 (concurring opinion), find great importance in the fact that "this case
has been litigated on the assumption that the programming at issue is not
obscene, but merely indecent," see ibid. (emphasis deleted). But as I
noted in FW/PBS, Inc. v. Dallas, 493 U. S. 215, 262-263 (1990) (opinion
concurring in part and dissenting in part), we have not allowed the parties'
litigating positions to place limits upon our development of obscenity law.
See, e. g., Miller v. California, 413 U. S. 15, 24-25 (1973) (abandoning "utterly without redeeming social value" test sua sponte); Ginzburg v. United
States, 383 U. S. 463 (1966) (adopting pandering theory unargued by the
Government); Mishkin v. New York, 383 U. S. 502 (1966) (upholding convictions on theory that obscenity could be defined by looking to the intent of
the disseminator, despite respondent's express disavowal of that theory).
As for Justice Thomas's concern that there has been no factual finding
of obscenity in this case, see ante, at 830 (concurring opinion): This is not
an as-applied challenge, in which the issue is whether a particular course
of conduct constitutes obscenity; it is a facial challenge, in which the issue
is whether the terms of this statute address obscenity. That is not for
the factfinder below, but for this Court.

true-but-inadequate as the conclusion that Al Capone did notaccurately report his income. It is not only children who

can be protected from occasional uninvited exposure to whatappellee calls "adult-oriented programming"; we can all be.
Section 505 covers only businesses that engage in the "com-mercial exploitation of erotica solely for the sake of their
prurient appeal," Ginzburg, 383 U. S., at 466--which, as
Playboy's own advertisements make plain, is what "adult"programming is all about. In most contexts, contemporary

American society has chosen to permit such commercial ex-ploitation. That may be a wise democratic choice, if only
because of the difficulty in many contexts (though not thisone) of identifying the panderer to sex. It is, however, not
a course compelled by the Constitution. Since the Government is entirely free to block these transmissions, it may
certainly take the less drastic step of dictating how, and during what times, they may occur.

Justice Breyer, with whom The Chief Justice, Jus-

and Justice Scalia join, dissenting.

This case involves the application, not the elucidation, of
First Amendment principles. We apply established First
Amendment law to a statute that focuses upon the broadcast
of "sexually explicit adult programming" on AdulTVision,
Adam & Eve, Spice, and Playboy cable channels. These
channels are, as the statute requires, "primarily dedicated to
sexually-oriented programming." Telecommunications Act
of 1996, Pub. L. 104-104, $ 505(a), 110 Stat. 136, 47 U. S. C.

$ 561(a) (1994 ed., Supp. III). Section 505 prohibits cable operators from sending these adult channels into the homes of
viewers who do not request them. In practice, it requires a
significant number of cable operators either to upgrade their
scrambling technology or to avoid broadcasting these channels during daylight and evening hours (6 a.m. to 10 p.m.).
We must decide whether the First Amendment permits Congress to enact this statute.

Breyer, J., dissenting

The basic, applicable First Amendment principles are notat issue. The Court must examine the statute before us

with great care to determine whether its speech-related re-strictions are justified by a "compelling interest," namely,
an interest in limiting children's access to sexually explicitmaterial. In doing so, it recognizes that the Legislature
must respect adults' viewing freedom by "narrowly tailor-ing" the statute so that it restricts no more speech than necessary, and choosing instead any alternative that would fur-ther the compelling interest in a "less restrictive" but "at
least as effective" way. See ante, at 813; Reno v. American
Civil Liberties Union, 521 U. S. 844, 874 (1997).Applying these principles, the majority invalidates $ 505

for two reasons. It finds that (1) the "Government has failedto establish a pervasive, nationwide problem justifying its
nationwide daytime speech ban," ante, at 823, and (2) the"Government . . . failed to prove" the "ineffective[ness]" of
an alternative, namely, notified viewers requesting that thebroadcaster of sexually explicit material stop sending it,
ibid. In my view, the record supports neither reason.

At the outset, I would describe the statutory schemesomewhat differently than does the majority. I would emphasize three background points. First, the statutoryscheme reflects more than a congressional effort to control
incomplete scrambling. Previously, federal law had leftcable operators free to decide whether, when, and how to
transmit adult channels. Most channel operators on theirown had decided not to send adult channels into a subscriber's home except on request. But the operators then imple-mented that decision with inexpensive technology. Through
signal "bleeding," the scrambling technology (either inad-vertently or by way of enticement) allowed nonsubscribers
to see and hear what was going on. That is why Congressdecided to act.

In 1995, Senator Dianne Feinstein, the present statute'slegislative cosponsor, pointed out that "numerous cable operators across the country are still automatically broadcast-ing sexually explicit programming into households across
America, regardless of whether parents want this or sub-scribers want it." 141 Cong. Rec. 15588. She complained
that the "industry has only taken baby steps to address this
problem through voluntary policies that simply recommendaction,"

ibid., adding that the "problem is that there are no
uniform laws or regulations that govern such sexually ex-plicit adult programming on cable television,"

id., at 15587.
She consequently proposed, and Congress enacted, the present statute.

The statute is carefully tailored to respect viewer preferences. It regulates transmissions by creating two "default
rules" applicable unless the subscriber decides otherwise.
Section 504 requires a cable operator to "fully scramble" any
channel (whether or not it broadcasts adult programming) if
a subscriber asks not to receive it. Section 505 requires a
cable operator to "fully scramble" every adult channel unless
a subscriber asks to receive it. Taken together, the two provisions create a scheme that permits subscribers to choose
to see what they want. But each law creates a different
"default" assumption about silent subscribers. Section 504
assumes a silent subscriber wants to see the ordinary (nonadult) channels that the cable operator includes in the paidfor bundle sent into the home. Section 505 assumes that a
silent subscriber does not want to receive adult channels.
Consequently, a subscriber wishing to view an adult channel
must "opt in," and specifically request that channel. See

$ 505. A subscriber wishing not to view any other channel
(sent into the home) must "opt out." See $ 504.

The scheme addresses signal bleed but only indirectly.
From the statute's perspective signal "bleeding"--i. e., a failure to fully "rearrange the content of the signal . . . so that
the programming cannot be viewed or heard in an under529US3 Unit: $U60 [09-26-01 12:39:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN

standable manner," $ 504(c)--amounts to transmission into
a home. Hence "bleeding" violates the statute whenever
a clear transmission of an unrequested adult channel would
violate the statute.

Second, the majority's characterization of this statutory
scheme as "prohibit[ing] . . . speech" is an exaggeration.
Ante, at 812. Rather, the statute places a burden on adult
channel speech by requiring the relevant cable operator
either to use better scrambling technology, or, if that technology is too expensive, to broadcast only between 10 p.m. and
6 a.m. Laws that burden speech, say, by making speech less
profitable, may create serious First Amendment issues, but
they are not the equivalent of an absolute ban on speech
itself. Cf. Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528
U. S. 377 (2000). Thus, this Court has upheld laws that do
not ban the access of adults to sexually explicit speech, but
burden that access through geographical or temporal zoning.
See, e. g., Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U. S. 41
(1986); FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U. S. 726 (1978);
Young v. American Mini Theatres, Inc., 427 U. S. 50 (1976).
This Court has also recognized that material the First
Amendment guarantees adults the right to see may not be
suitable for children. And it has consequently held that legislatures maintain a limited power to protect children by restricting access to, but not banning, adult material. Compare Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U. S. 629 (1968) (upholding
ban on sale of pornographic magazines to minors), with Butler v. Michigan, 352 U. S. 380 (1957) (invalidating ban on all
books unfit for minors); see also Denver Area Ed. Telecommunications Consortium, Inc. v. FCC, 518 U. S. 727, 737-753
(1996) (plurality opinion); Pacifica Foundation, supra, at
748-750; Reno, supra, at 887-889 (O'Connor, J., concurring
in part and dissenting in part). The difference--between
imposing a burden and enacting a ban--can matter even
when strict First Amendment rules are at issue.

Breyer, J., dissenting
Third, this case concerns only the regulation of commercialactors who broadcast "virtually 100% sexually explicit" material. 30 F. Supp. 2d 702, 707 (Del. 1998). The channelsdo not broadcast more than trivial amounts of more serious
material such as birth control information, artistic images,or the visual equivalents of classical or serious literature.
This case therefore does not present the kind of narrow tai-loring concerns seen in other cases. See,

e. g., Reno, 521U. S., at 877-879 ("The breadth of the [statutue's] coverage

is wholly unprecedented. . . . [It] cover[s] large amounts ofnonpornographic material with serious educational or other
value"); Butler, supra, at 381-384 (invalidating ban on books" `tending to the corruption of the morals of youth' ").

With this background in mind, the reader will better un-derstand my basic disagreement with each of the Court's
two conclusions. II

The majority first concludes that the Government failed toprove the seriousness of the problem--receipt of adult channels by children whose parents did not request their broad-cast. Ante, at 819-822. This claim is flat-out wrong. For
one thing, the parties concede that basic RF scrambling doesnot scramble the audio portion of the program. 30 F. Supp.
2d, at 707. For another, Playboy itself conducted a surveyof cable operators who were asked: "Is your system in full
compliance with Section 505 (no discernible audio or video
bleed)?" To this question, 75% of cable operators answered"no." See Def. Exh. 254, 2 Record 2. Further, the Government's expert took the number of homes subscribing to Play-boy or Spice, multiplied by the fraction of cable households
with children and the average number of children per house-hold, and found 29 million children are potentially exposed
to audio and video bleed from adult programming. Def.Exh. 82, 10 Record 11-12. Even discounting by 25% for systems that might be considered in full compliance, this left 22

million children in homes with faulty scrambling systems.See id., at 12. And, of course, the record contains additional

anecdotal evidence and the concerns expressed by electedofficials, probative of a larger problem. See 30 F. Supp. 2d,
at 709, and n. 10; see also 141 Cong. Rec. 15586 (1995).I would add to this empirical evidence the majority's own
statement that "most cable operators had `no practical choicebut to curtail' " adult programming by switching to nighttime only transmission of adult channels. Ante, at 809 (em-phasis added) (quoting 30 F. Supp. 2d, at 711).

If signalbleed is not a significant empirical problem, then why, in

light of the cost of its cure, must so many cable operatorsswitch to nighttime hours? There is no realistic answer to
this question. I do not think it realistic to imagine that sig-nal bleed occurs just enough to make cable operators skittish,
without also significantly exposing children to these images.See ante, at 821.

If, as the majority suggests, the signal bleed problem isnot significant, then there is also no significant burden on
speech created by $ 505. The majority cannot have this evi-dence both ways. And if, given this logical difficulty and
the quantity of empirical evidence, the majority still believesthat the Government has not proved its case, then it imposes
a burden upon the Government beyond that suggested in anyother First Amendment case of which I am aware.

III
The majority's second claim--that the Government failedto demonstrate the absence of a "less restrictive alternative"--presents a closer question. The specific question iswhether $ 504's "opt-out" amounts to a "less restrictive," but
similarly practical and effective, way to accomplish $ 505'schild-protecting objective. As

Reno tells us, a "less restric-tive alternativ[e]" must be "at least as effective in achieving

the legitimate purpose that the statute was enacted toserve." 521 U. S., at 874.

Breyer, J., dissenting
The words I have just emphasized, "similarly" and "effec-tive," are critical. In an appropriate case they ask a judge

not to apply First Amendment rules mechanically, but to de-cide whether, in light of the benefits and potential alternatives, the statute works speech-related harm (here to adultspeech) out of proportion to the benefits that the statute
seeks to provide (here, child protection).

These words imply a degree of leeway, however small, forthe Legislature when it chooses among possible alternatives

in light of predicted comparative effects. Without somesuch empirical leeway, the undoubted ability of lawyers and
judges to imagine some kind of slightly less drastic or restrictive an approach would make it impossible to write laws
that deal with the harm that called the statute into being.
As Justice Blackmun pointed out, a "judge would be unimaginative indeed if he could not come up with something a little
less `drastic' or a little less `restrictive' in almost any situation, and thereby enable himself to vote to strike legislation down." Illinois Bd. of Elections v. Socialist Workers
Party, 440 U. S. 173, 188-189 (1979) (concurring opinion).
Used without a sense of the practical choices that face legislatures, "the test merely announces an inevitable [negative]
result, and the test is no test at all." Id., at 188.

The majority, in describing First Amendment jurisprudence, scarcely mentions the words "at least as effective"--
a rather surprising omission since they happen to be what
this case is all about. But the majority does refer to Reno's
understanding of less restrictive alternatives, ante, at 813,
and it addresses the Government's effectiveness arguments,
ante, at 823-826. I therefore assume it continues to recognize their role as part of the test that it enunciates.

I turn then to the major point of disagreement. Unlike
the majority, I believe the record makes clear that $ 504's
opt-out is not a similarly effective alternative. Section 504
(opt-out) and $ 505 (opt-in) work differently in order to
achieve very different legislative objectives. Section 504

gives parents the power to tell cable operators to keep any
channel out of their home. Section 505 does more. Unless
parents explicitly consent, it inhibits the transmission of
adult cable channels to children whose parents may be unaware of what they are watching, whose parents cannot easily supervise television viewing habits, whose parents do not
know of their $ 504 "opt-out" rights, or whose parents are
simply unavailable at critical times. In this respect, $ 505
serves the same interests as the laws that deny children access to adult cabarets or X-rated movies. E. g., Del. Code
Ann., Tit. 11, $ 1365(i)(2) (1995); D. C. Code Ann. $ 22-
2001(b)(1)(B) (1996). These laws, and $ 505, all act in the
absence of direct parental supervision.

This legislative objective is perfectly legitimate. Where
over 28 million school age children have both parents or their
only parent in the work force, where at least 5 million children are left alone at home without supervision each week,
and where children may spend afternoons and evenings
watching television outside of the home with friends, $ 505
offers independent protection for a large number of families.
See U. S. Dept. of Education, Office of Research and Improvement, Bringing Education into the After-School Hours
3 (summer 1999). I could not disagree more when the majority implies that the Government's independent interest in
offering such protection--preventing, say, an 8-year-old child
from watching virulent pornography without parental consent--might not be "compelling." Ante, at 825. No previous case in which the protection of children was at issue has
suggested any such thing. Indeed, they all say precisely the
opposite. See Reno, supra, at 865 (State has an "independent interest in the well-being of its youth"); Denver Area,
518 U. S., at 743; New York v. Ferber, 458 U. S. 747, 756-757
(1982); Ginsberg, 390 U. S., at 640; Prince v. Massachusetts,
321 U. S. 158, 165 (1944). They make clear that Government
has a compelling interest in helping parents by preventing

Breyer, J., dissenting
minors from accessing sexually explicit materials in the ab-sence of parental supervision. See

Ginsberg, supra, at 640.
By definition, $ 504 does nothing at all to further the com-pelling interest I have just described. How then is it a similarly effective $ 505 alternative?The record, moreover, sets forth empirical evidence showing that the two laws are not equivalent with respect to the
Government's objectives. As the majority observes, duringthe 14 months the Government was enjoined from enforcing

$ 505, "fewer than 0.5% of cable subscribers requested fullblocking" under $ 504.

Ante, at 816. The majority describes this public reaction as "a collective yawn," ibid., adding that the Government failed to prove that the "yawn" reflected anything other than the lack of a serious signal bleed
problem or a lack of notice which better information about

$ 504 might cure. The record excludes the first possibility--
at least in respect to exposure, as discussed above. See
supra, at 839-840. And I doubt that the public, though it
may well consider the viewing habits of adults a matter of
personal choice, would "yawn" when the exposure in question concerns young children, the absence of parental consent, and the sexually explicit material here at issue. See
ante, at 833-834 (Scalia, J., dissenting).

Neither is the record neutral in respect to the curative
power of better notice. Section 504's opt-out right works
only when parents (1) become aware of their $ 504 rights, (2)
discover that their children are watching sexually explicit
signal "bleed," (3) reach their cable operator and ask that it
block the sending of its signal to their home, (4) await installation of an individual blocking device, and, perhaps (5)
(where the block fails or the channel number changes) make
a new request. Better notice of $ 504 rights does little to
help parents discover their children's viewing habits (step 2).
And it does nothing at all in respect to steps 3 through 5.
Yet the record contains considerable evidence that those
problems matter, i. e., evidence of endlessly delayed phone

call responses, faulty installations, blocking failures, andother mishaps, leaving those steps as significant $ 504 obstacles. See, e. g., Deposition of J. Cavalier in Civ. ActionNo. 96-94, pp. 17-18 (D. Del., Dec. 5, 1997) ("It's like calling
any utilities; you sit there, and you wait and wait on thephone . . . . [It took] [t]hree weeks, numerous phone
calls. . . . [E]very time I call Cox Cable . . . I get different
stories"); Telephonic Deposition of M. Bennett, id., at 10-11(D. Del., Dec. 9, 1997) ("After two [failed installations,] no,

I don't recall calling them again. I just said well, I guessthis is something I'm going to have to live with").

Further, the District Court's actual plan for "better notice"--the only plan that makes concrete the majority's "better notice" requirement--is fraught with difficulties. The
District Court ordered Playboy to insist that cable operators
place notice of $ 504 in "inserts in monthly billing statements,
barker channels . . . and on-air advertising." 30 F. Supp. 2d,
at 719. But how can one say that placing one more insert
in a monthly billing statement stuffed with others, or calling
additional attention to adult channels through a "notice" on
"barker" channels, will make more than a small difference?
More importantly, why would doing so not interfere to some
extent with the cable operators' own freedom to decide what
to broadcast? And how is the District Court to supervise
the contracts with thousands of cable operators that are to
embody this requirement?

Even if better notice did adequately inform viewers of
their $ 504 rights, exercise of those rights by more than 6%
of the subscriber base would itself raise Playboy's costs to
the point that Playboy would be forced off the air entirely,
30 F. Supp. 2d, at 713--a consequence that would not seem
to further anyone's interest in free speech. The majority,
resting on its own earlier conclusion that signal bleed is not
widespread, denies any likelihood that more than 6% of viewers would need $ 504. But that earlier conclusion is unsound. See supra, at 839-840. The majority also relies on

529US3 Unit: $U60 [09-26-01 12:39:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN

845Cite as: 529 U. S. 803 (2000)
Breyer, J., dissenting
the fact that Playboy, presumably aware of its own economicinterests, "is willing to incur the costs of an effective $ 504."

Ante, at 824. Yet that denial, as the majority admits, maysimply reflect Playboy's knowledge that $ 504, even with better notice, will not work. Section 504 is not a similarly ef-fective alternative to $ 505 (in respect to the Government's
interest in protecting children), unless more than a minimalnumber of viewers actually use it; yet the economic evidence
shows that if more than 6% do so, Playboy's programmingwould be totally eliminated. The majority provides no answer to this argument in its opinion--and this evidence issufficient in and of itself to dispose of this case.

Of course, it is logically possible that "better notice" willbring about near perfect parental knowledge (of what children watch and $ 504 opt-out rights), that cable operatorswill respond rapidly to blocking requests, and that still 94%
of all informed parents will decided not to have adult chan-nels blocked for free. But the

probability that this remote
possibility will occur is neither a "draw" nor a "tie." Ante,at 819. And that fact is sufficient for the Government to

have met its burden of proof.All these considerations show that $ 504's opt-out, even
with the Court's plan for "better notice," is not similarly ef-fective in achieving the legitimate goals that the statute was
enacted to serve. IV

Section 505 raises the cost of adult channel broadcasting.In doing so, it restricts, but does not ban, adult speech.
Adults may continue to watch adult channels, though lessconveniently, by watching at night, recording programs with
a VCR, or by subscribing to digital cable with better block-ing systems. Cf. Renton, 475 U. S., at 53-55 (upholding zoning rules that force potential adult theater patrons to travelto less convenient locations). The Government's justification for imposing this restriction--limiting the access ofchildren to channels that broadcast virtually 100% "sexu529US3 Unit: $U60 [09-26-01 12:39:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ally explicit" material--is "compelling." The record shows
no similarly effective, less restrictive alternative. Consequently $ 505's restriction, viewed in light of the proposed
alternative, is proportionate to need. That is to say, it restricts speech no more than necessary to further that compelling need. Taken together, these considerations lead to
the conclusion that $ 505 is lawful.

I repeat that my disagreement with the majority lies in
the fact that, in my view, the Government has satisfied its
burden of proof. In particular, it has proved both the existence of a serious problem and the comparative ineffectiveness of $ 504 in resolving that problem. This disagreement
is not about allocation of First Amendment burdens of proof,
basic First Amendment principle, nor the importance of that
Amendment to our scheme of Government. See ante, at
826-827. First Amendment standards are rigorous. They
safeguard speech. But they also permit Congress to enact
a law that increases the costs associated with certain speech,
where doing so serves a compelling interest that cannot be
served through the adoption of a less restrictive, similarly
effective alternative. Those standards at their strictest
make it difficult for the Government to prevail. But they
do not make it impossible for the Government to prevail.

The majority here, however, has applied those standards
without making a realistic assessment of the alternatives.
It thereby threatens to leave Congress without power to
help the millions of parents who do not want to expose their
children to commercial pornography--but will remain ill
served by the Court's chosen remedy. Worse still, the logic
of the majority's "505/504" comparison (but not its holding
that the problem has not been established) would seem to
apply whether "bleeding" or totally unscrambled transmission is at issue. If so, the public would have to depend solely
upon the voluntary conduct of cable channel operators to
avert considerably greater harm.

Case law does not mandate the Court's result. To thecontrary, as I have pointed out, our prior cases recognize

that, where the protection of children is at issue, the FirstAmendment poses a barrier that properly is high, but not
insurmountable. It is difficult to reconcile today's decisionwith our foundational cases that have upheld similar laws,
such as FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U. S. 726 (1978),
and Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U. S. 629 (1968). It is notdifficult to distinguish our cases striking down such laws--

either because they applied far more broadly than the nar-row regulation of adult channels here, see,

e. g., Reno v.
American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U. S. 844 (1997), imposed a total ban on a form of adult speech, see, e. g., Sable
Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U. S. 115 (1989);
Bolger v. Youngs Drug Products Corp., 463 U. S. 60 (1983),
or because a less restrictive, similarly effective alternative
was otherwise available, see, e. g., Denver Area, 518 U. S.,
at 753-760.

Nor is it a satisfactory answer to say, as does Justice
Thomas, that the Government remains free to prosecute
under the obscenity laws. Ante, at 829-830. The obscenity
exception permits censorship of communication even among
adults. See, e. g., Miller v. California, 413 U. S. 15 (1973).
It must be kept narrow lest the Government improperly interfere with the communication choices that adults have
freely made. To rely primarily upon law that bans speech
for adults is to overlook the special need to protect children.

Congress has taken seriously the importance of maintaining adult access to the sexually explicit channels here at
issue. It has tailored the restrictions to minimize their impact upon adults while offering parents help in keeping unwanted transmissions from their children. By finding "adequate alternatives" where there are none, the Court reduces
Congress' protective power to the vanishing point. That is
not what the First Amendment demands.

I respectfully dissent.

JONES v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe seventh circuit

No. 99-5739. Argued March 21, 2000--Decided May 22, 2000
Petitioner Jones tossed a Molotov cocktail into a home owned and occupied

by his cousin as a dwelling place for everyday family living. The ensuing fire severely damaged the home. Jones was convicted in the District Court of violating, inter alia, 18 U. S. C. $ 844(i), which makes it a
federal crime to "maliciously damag[e] or destro[y], . . . by means of fire
or an explosive, any building . . . used in interstate or foreign commerce
or in any activity affecting interstate or foreign commerce." The Seventh Circuit affirmed, rejecting Jones's contention that $ 844(i), when
applied to the arson of a private residence, exceeds the authority vested
in Congress under the Commerce Clause.

Held: Because an owner-occupied residence not used for any commercial

purpose does not qualify as property "used in" commerce or commerceaffecting activity, arson of such a dwelling is not subject to federal
prosecution under $ 844(i). Pp. 852-859.

(a) In support of its argument that $ 844(i) reaches the arson of an
owner-occupied private residence, the Government relies principally on
the breadth of the statutory term "affecting . . . commerce," words that,
when unqualified, signal Congress' intent to invoke its full Commerce
Clause authority. But $ 844(i) contains the qualifying words "used in"
a commerce-affecting activity. The key word is "used." Congress did
not define the crime as the explosion of a building whose damage or
destruction might affect interstate commerce, but required that the
damaged or destroyed property itself have been used in commerce or in
an activity affecting commerce. The proper inquiry, therefore, is into
the function of the building itself, and then into whether that function
affects interstate commerce. The Court rejects the Government's argument that the Indiana residence involved in this case was constantly
"used" in at least three "activit[ies] affecting commerce": (1) it was
"used" as collateral to obtain and secure a mortgage from an Oklahoma
lender, who, in turn, "used" it as security for the loan; (2) it was "used"
to obtain from a Wisconsin insurer a casualty insurance policy, which
safeguarded the interests of the homeowner and the mortgagee; and (3)
it was "used" to receive natural gas from sources outside Indiana. Section 844(i)'s use-in-commerce requirement is most sensibly read to mean
active employment for commercial purposes, and not merely a passive,

Syllabus
passing, or past connection to commerce. See, e. g., Bailey v. United
States, 516 U. S. 137, 143, 145. It surely is not the common perception
that a private, owner-occupied residence is "used" in the "activity" of
receiving natural gas, a mortgage, or an insurance policy. Cf. id., at
145. The Government does not allege that the residence here served
as a home office or the locus of any commercial undertaking. The
home's only "active employment," so far as the record reveals, was for
the everyday living of Jones's cousin and his family. Russell v. United
States, 471 U. S. 858, 862--in which the Court held that particular property was being used in an "activity affecting commerce" under $ 844(i)
because its owner was renting it to tenants at the time he attempted to
destroy it by fire--does not warrant a less "use"-centered reading of

$ 844(i) in this case. The Court there observed that "[b]y its terms,"

$ 844(i) applies only to "property that is `used' in an `activity' that affects
commerce," and ruled that "the rental of real estate" fits that description, ibid. Here, the homeowner did not use his residence in any trade
or business. Were the Court to adopt the Government's expansive interpretation, hardly a building in the land would fall outside $ 844(i)'s
domain, and the statute's limiting language, "used in," would have
no office. Judges should hesitate to treat statutory terms in any setting as surplusage, particularly when the words describe an element
of a crime. E. g., Ratzlaf v. United States, 510 U. S. 135, 140-141.
Pp. 852-857.

(b) The foregoing reading is in harmony with the guiding principle
that where a statute is susceptible of two constructions, by one of which
grave and doubtful constitutional questions arise and by the other of
which such questions are avoided, the Court's duty is to adopt the latter.
See, e. g., Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Building &
Constr. Trades Council, 485 U. S. 568, 575. In holding that a statute
making it a federal crime to possess a firearm within 1,000 feet of a

compass. Construing the statute's text, we hold that anowner-occupied residence not used for any commercial purpose does not qualify as property "used in" commerce or

commerce-affecting activity; arson of such a dwelling, there-fore, is not subject to federal prosecution under $ 844(i).

Our construction of $ 844(i) is reinforced by the Court's opin-ion in United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549 (1995), and the
interpretive rule that constitutionally doubtful constructionsshould be avoided where possible, see Edward J. DeBartolo

Council, 485 U. S. 568, 575 (1988).

I
On February 23, 1998, petitioner Dewey Jones tossed aMolotov cocktail through a window into a home in Fort

Wayne, Indiana, owned and occupied by his cousin. No onewas injured in the ensuing fire, but the blaze severely damaged the home. A federal grand jury returned a three-countindictment charging Jones with arson, 18 U. S. C. $ 844(i)
(1994 ed., Supp. IV); using a destructive device during andin relation to a crime of violence (the arson), 18 U. S. C.

$ 924(c); and making an illegal destructive device, 26 U. S. C.$ 5861(f). Jones was tried under that indictment in the
Northern District of Indiana and convicted by a jury on allthree counts.

1 The District Court sentenced him, pursuant

to the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, to a total prison termof 35 years, to be followed by five years of supervised release.

The court also ordered Jones to pay $77,396.87 to the insurerof the damaged home as restitution for its loss. Jones appealed, and the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuitaffirmed the judgment of the District Court. 178 F. 3d 479
(1999).Jones unsuccessfully urged, both before the District Court
and on appeal to the Seventh Circuit, that $ 844(i), when ap-plied to the arson of a private residence, exceeds the authority vested in Congress under the Commerce Clause of the

Opinion of the Court
Constitution, Art. I, $ 8, cl. 3. Courts of Appeals have di-vided both on the question whether $ 844(i) applies to buildings not used for commercial purposes,2 and on the constitu-tionality of such an application.

3 We granted certiorari, 528

U. S. 1002 (1999), and framed as the question presented:

"Whether, in light of United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S.549 (1995), and the interpretive rule that constitutionally doubtful constructions should be avoided, see Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Build-ing & Constr. Trades Council, 485 U. S. 568, 575 (1988),

18 U. S. C. $ 844(i) applies to the arson of a private resi-dence; and if so, whether its application to the private
residence in the present case is constitutional."
Satisfied that $ 844(i) does not reach an owner-occupied resi-dence that is not used for any commercial purpose, we reverse the Court of Appeals' judgment.

Opinion of the Court
United States, 471 U. S. 858, 860, n. 5 (1985) (citation omit-ted). The word "fire," which did not appear in $ 844(i) as

originally composed, was introduced by statutory amend-ment in 1982.

4 As now worded, $ 844(i) (1994 ed., Supp. IV)

reads in relevant part:

"Whoever maliciously damages or destroys, or attemptsto damage or destroy, by means of fire or an explosive,

any building, vehicle, or other real or personal propertyused in interstate or foreign commerce or in any activity
affecting interstate or foreign commerce shall be impris-oned for not less than 5 years and not more than 20
years, fined under this title, or both . . . ."
We previously construed $ 844(i) in Russell v. UnitedStates, 471 U. S. 858 (1985), and there held that $ 844(i)

applies to a building "used as rental property," ibid. Thepetitioner-defendant in Russell had unsuccessfully attempted to set fire to a two-unit apartment building heowned. He earned rental income from the property and
"treated it as business property for tax purposes." Id., at859. Our decision stated as the dispositive fact: "Petitioner
was renting his apartment building to tenants at the time heattempted to destroy it by fire."

Id., at 862. It followedfrom that fact, the Russell opinion concluded, that "[t]he

property was . . . being used in an activity affecting com-merce within the meaning of $ 844(i)." Ibid.

4 See Pub. L. 97-298, $ 2(c), 96 Stat. 1319 (amending $ 844(i) to insert
the words "fire or" before the words "an explosive"). The House Report
accompanying the 1982 legislation explained that the original measure,
which was confined to damage caused by "an explosive," had resulted in
problems of practical application. H. R. Rep. No. 678, 97th Cong., 2d
Sess., 2 (1982). In particular, the Report noted a Circuit conflict on the
question whether the measure covered use of gasoline or other flammable
liquids to ignite a fire. Id., at 2, and nn. 5-6.

5 We noted in Russell that the original version of the bill that became

$ 844(i) applied to destruction, by means of explosives, of property used
" `for business purposes.' " 471 U. S., at 860, n. 5. After some House

854 JONES v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
We now confront a question that was not before the Court
in Russell: Does $ 844(i) cover property occupied and used
by its owner not for any commercial venture, but as a private
residence. Is such a dwelling place, in the words of $ 844(i),
"used in . . . any activity affecting . . . commerce"?

In support of its argument that $ 844(i) reaches the arson
of an owner-occupied private residence, the Government
relies principally on the breadth of the statutory term
"affecting . . . commerce," see Brief for United States 10,
16-17, words that, when unqualified, signal Congress' intent
to invoke its full authority under the Commerce Clause.
But $ 844(i) contains the qualifying words "used in" a
commerce-affecting activity. The key word is "used."
"Congress did not define the crime described in $ 844(i) as
the explosion of a building whose damage or destruction
might affect interstate commerce . . . ." United States v.
Mennuti, 639 F. 2d 107, 110 (CA2 1981) (Friendly, J.).6 Congress "require[d] that the damaged or destroyed property
must itself have been used in commerce or in an activity
affecting commerce." Ibid. The proper inquiry, we agree,
"is into the function of the building itself, and then a determination of whether that function affects interstate commerce."

members indicated that they thought the provision should apply to the
bombings of schools, police stations, and places of worship, the words
"for business purposes" were omitted. Id., at 860-861. The House
Report accompanying the final bill, we further noted in Russell, described

$ 844(i) as " `a very broad provision covering substantially all business
property.' " Id., at 861, and n. 8 (citing H. R. Rep. No. 91-1549, pp. 69-70
(1970)).

6 The defendants in Mennuti destroyed two buildings. One was the

residence of the owner and her family, the other was a rental property.
See 639 F. 2d, at 108-109, n. 1. The Second Circuit affirmed the District
Court's dismissal of the entire indictment. Our decision in Russell v.
United States, 471 U. S. 858 (1985), supersedes Mennuti with respect to
the building held for rental. Regarding the family residence, we find
Mennuti's reasoning persuasive.

Opinion of the Court
United States v. Ryan, 9 F. 3d 660, 675 (CA8 1993) (Arnold,C. J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).

7

The Government urges that the Fort Wayne, Indiana,residence into which Jones tossed a Molotov cocktail was

constantly "used" in at least three "activit[ies] affectingcommerce." First, the homeowner "used" the dwelling as
collateral to obtain and secure a mortgage from an Oklahomalender; the lender, in turn, "used" the property as security
for the home loan. Second, the homeowner "used" the resi-dence to obtain a casualty insurance policy from a Wisconsin
insurer. That policy, the Government points out, safe-guarded the interests of the homeowner and the mortgagee.
Third, the homeowner "used" the dwelling to receive naturalgas from sources outside Indiana. See Brief for United
States 19-23.The Government correctly observes that $ 844(i) excludes
no particular type of building (it covers "any building"); theprovision does, however, require that the building be "used"
in an activity affecting commerce. That qualification is mostsensibly read to mean active employment for commercial
purposes, and not merely a passive, passing, or past connec-tion to commerce. Although "variously defined," the word
"use," in legislation as in conversation, ordinarily signifies"active employment." Bailey v. United States, 516 U. S.
137, 143, 145 (1995); see also Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer,513 U. S. 179, 187 (1995) ("When terms used in a statute are
undefined, we give them their ordinary meaning.").

7 In Ryan, Chief Judge Arnold dissented from a panel decision holding
that the arson of a permanently closed fitness center fell within $ 844(i)'s
prohibition. The panel majority considered adequate either of two interstate commerce connections: the building was owned and leased by out-ofstate parties, and received natural gas from across state borders. The
panel added, however, that it would not extend the decision "to property
which is purely private in nature, such as a privately owned home, used
solely for residential purposes." 9 F. 3d, at 666-667. Sitting en banc,
the Eighth Circuit affirmed the panel's judgment. See United States v.
Ryan, 41 F. 3d 361 (1994), cert. denied, 514 U. S. 1082 (1995).

856 JONES v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
It surely is not the common perception that a private,
owner-occupied residence is "used" in the "activity" of receiving natural gas, a mortgage, or an insurance policy. Cf.
Bailey, 516 U. S., at 145 (interpreting the word "use," as it
appears in 18 U. S. C. $ 924(c)(1), to mean active employment
of a firearm and rejecting the Government's argument that
a gun is "used" whenever its presence "protect[s] drugs" or
"embolden[s]" a drug dealer). The Government does not allege that the Indiana residence involved in this case served
as a home office or the locus of any commercial undertaking.
The home's only "active employment," so far as the record
reveals, was for the everyday living of Jones's cousin and
his family.

Our decision in Russell does not warrant a less
"use"-centered reading of $ 844(i). In that case, which involved the arson of property rented out by its owner, see
supra, at 853, the Court referred to the recognized distinction between legislation limited to activities "in commerce"
and legislation invoking Congress' full power over activity
substantially "affecting . . . commerce." 471 U. S., at 859-
860, and n. 4. The Russell opinion went on to observe, however, that "[b]y its terms," $ 844(i) applies only to "property
that is `used' in an `activity' that affects commerce." Id., at
862. "The rental of real estate," the Court then stated, "is
unquestionably such an activity." Ibid.8 Here, as earlier
emphasized, the owner used the property as his home, the
center of his family life. He did not use the residence in any
trade or business.

8 Notably, the Court in Russell did not rest its holding on the expansive
interpretation advanced by the Government both in Russell and in this
case. Compare Brief for United States in Russell v. United States, O. T.
1984, No. 435, p. 15 ("Petitioner used his building on South Union Street
in an activity affecting interstate commerce by heating it with gas that
moved interstate."), with Russell, 471 U. S., at 862 (focusing instead on
fact that "[t]he rental of real estate is unquestionably . . . an activity"
affecting commerce).

857Cite as: 529 U. S. 848 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
Were we to adopt the Government's expansive interpreta-tion of $ 844(i), hardly a building in the land would fall outside the federal statute's domain. Practically every buildingin our cities, towns, and rural areas is constructed with supplies that have moved in interstate commerce, served by util-ities that have an interstate connection, financed or insured
by enterprises that do business across state lines, or bearssome other trace of interstate commerce. See,

e. g., FERCv. Mississippi, 456 U. S. 742, 757 (1982) (observing that electric energy is consumed "in virtually every home" and that"[n]o State relies solely on its own resources" to meet its
inhabitants' demand for the product). If such connectionssufficed to trigger $ 844(i), the statute's limiting language,
"used in" any commerce-affecting activity, would have no of-fice. See United States v. Monholland, 607 F. 2d 1311, 1316
(CA10 1979) (finding in $ 844(i) no indication that Congressintended to include "everybody and everything"). "Judges
should hesitate . . . to treat statutory terms in any set-ting [as surplusage], and resistance should be heightened
when the words describe an element of a criminal offense."
Ratzlaf v. United States, 510 U. S. 135, 140-141 (1994); ac-cord, Bailey, 516 U. S., at 145.

III
Our reading of $ 844(i) is in harmony with the guiding prin-ciple that "where a statute is susceptible of two constructions, by one of which grave and doubtful constitutionalquestions arise and by the other of which such questions are
avoided, our duty is to adopt the latter." United States exrel. Attorney General v. Delaware & Hudson Co., 213 U. S.
366, 408 (1909), quoted in Jones v. United States, 526 U. S.227, 239 (1999); see also DeBartolo, 485 U. S., at 575; Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 348 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concur-ring). In Lopez, this Court invalidated the Gun-Free School
Zones Act, former 18 U. S. C. $ 922(q) (1988 ed., Supp. V),which made it a federal crime to possess a firearm within

Opinion of the Court
1,000 feet of a school. The defendant in that case, a 12thgrade student, had been convicted for knowingly possessing
a concealed handgun and bullets at his San Antonio, Texas,
high school, in violation of the federal Act. Holding that
the Act exceeded Congress' power to regulate commerce, the
Court stressed that the area was one of traditional state concern, see 514 U. S., at 561, n. 3, 567; id., at 577 (Kennedy, J.,
concurring), and that the legislation aimed at activity in
which "neither the actors nor their conduct has a commercial
character," id., at 580 (Kennedy, J., concurring); id., at 560-
562 (opinion of the Court).

Given the concerns brought to the fore in Lopez, it is appropriate to avoid the constitutional question that would
arise were we to read $ 844(i) to render the "traditionally
local criminal conduct" in which petitioner Jones engaged "a
matter for federal enforcement." United States v. Bass, 404
U. S. 336, 350 (1971). Our comprehension of $ 844(i) is additionally reinforced by other interpretive guides. We have
instructed that "ambiguity concerning the ambit of criminal
statutes should be resolved in favor of lenity," Rewis v.
United States, 401 U. S. 808, 812 (1971), and that "when
choice has to be made between two readings of what conduct
Congress has made a crime, it is appropriate, before we
choose the harsher alternative, to require that Congress
should have spoken in language that is clear and definite,"
United States v. Universal C. I. T. Credit Corp., 344 U. S.
218, 221-222 (1952). We have cautioned, as well, that "unless Congress conveys its purpose clearly, it will not be
deemed to have significantly changed the federal-state balance" in the prosecution of crimes. Bass, 404 U. S., at 349.
To read $ 844(i) as encompassing the arson of an owneroccupied private home would effect such a change, for arson
is a paradigmatic common-law state crime. See generally
Poulos, The Metamorphosis of the Law of Arson, 51 Mo.
L. Rev. 295 (1986).

Stevens, J., concurring

IV
We conclude that $ 844(i) is not soundly read to make virtu-ally every arson in the country a federal offense. We hold

that the provision covers only property currently used incommerce or in an activity affecting commerce. The home
owned and occupied by petitioner Jones's cousin was not soused--it was a dwelling place used for everyday family living. As we read $ 844(i), Congress left cases of this genreto the law enforcement authorities of the States.

Our holding that $ 844(i) does not cover the arson of anowner-occupied dwelling means that Jones's $ 844(i) conviction must be vacated. Accordingly, the judgment of theCourt of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for
further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.
Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Thomas joins,concurring.

Part II of the Court's opinion convincingly explains whyits construction of 18 U. S. C. $ 844(i) better fits the text and
context of the provision than the Government's expansivereading. It also seems appropriate, however, to emphasize
the kinship between our well-established presumptionagainst federal pre-emption of state law, see

Ray v. AtlanticRichfield Co., 435 U. S. 151, 157 (1978), and our reluctance to

"believe Congress intended to authorize federal interventionin local law enforcement in a marginal case such as this."
United States v. Altobella, 442 F. 2d 310, 316 (CA7 1971).The fact that petitioner received a sentence of 35 years in
prison when the maximum penalty for the comparable stateoffense was only 10 years, Ind. Code $$ 35-43-1-1, 35-50-
2-5 (1993), illustrates how a criminal law like this may effec-tively displace a policy choice made by the State. Even
when Congress has undoubted power to pre-empt local law,

we have wisely decided that "unless Congress conveys itspurpose clearly, it will not be deemed to have significantly

changed the federal-state balance." United States v. Bass,404 U. S. 336, 349 (1971). For this reason, I reiterate my
firm belief that we should interpret narrowly federal crimi-nal laws that overlap with state authority unless congressional intention to assert its jurisdiction is plain.*

Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Scalia joins,concurring.

In joining the Court's opinion, I express no view on thequestion whether the federal arson statute, 18 U. S. C. $ 844(i)
(1994 ed., Supp. IV), as there construed, is constitutional inits application to all buildings used for commercial activities.

861OCTOBER TERM, 1999
Syllabus

GEIER et al. v. AMERICAN HONDA MOTOR CO., INC.,

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe district of columbia circuit

No. 98-1811. Argued December 7, 1999--Decided May 22, 2000
Pursuant to its authority under the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle

Safety Act of 1966, the Department of Transportation (DOT) promulgated Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 208, which required auto manufacturers to equip some but not all of their 1987 vehicles with passive restraints. Petitioner Alexis Geier was injured in an
accident while driving a 1987 Honda Accord that did not have such restraints. She and her parents, also petitioners, sought damages under
District of Columbia tort law, claiming, inter alia, that respondents
(hereinafter American Honda) were negligent in not equipping the Accord with a driver's side airbag. Ruling that their claims were expressly pre-empted by the Act, the District Court granted American
Honda summary judgment. In affirming, the Court of Appeals concluded that, because petitioners' state tort claims posed an obstacle to
the accomplishment of the objectives of FMVSS 208, those claims conflicted with that standard and that, under ordinary pre-emption principles, the Act consequently pre-empted the lawsuit.

Held: Petitioners' "no airbag" lawsuit conflicts with the objectives of

FMVSS 208 and is therefore pre-empted by the Act. Pp. 867-886.

(a) The Act's pre-emption provision, 15 U. S. C. $ 1392(d), does not expressly pre-empt this lawsuit. The presence of a saving clause, which
says that "[c]ompliance with" a federal safety standard "does not exempt
any person from any liability under common law," $ 1397(k), requires
that the pre-emption provision be read narrowly to pre-empt only state
statutes and regulations. The saving clause assumes that there are a
significant number of common-law liability cases to save. And reading
the express pre-emption provision to exclude common-law tort actions
gives actual meaning to the saving clause's literal language, while leaving adequate room for state tort law to operate where, for example,
federal law creates only a minimum safety standard. Pp. 867-868.

(b) However, the saving clause does not bar the ordinary working of
conflict pre-emption principles. Nothing in that clause suggests an intent to save state tort actions that conflict with federal regulations.
The words "[c]ompliance" and "does not exempt" sound as if they simply

bar a defense that compliance with a federal standard automatically exempts a defendant from state law, whether the Federal Government
meant that standard to be an absolute, or a minimum, requirement.
This interpretation does not conflict with the purpose of the saving provision, for it preserves actions that seek to establish greater safety than
the minimum safety achieved by a federal regulation intended to provide a floor. Moreover, this Court has repeatedly declined to give
broad effect to saving clauses where doing so would upset the careful
regulatory scheme established by federal law, a concern applicable here.
The pre-emption provision and the saving provision, read together, reflect a neutral policy, not a specially favorable or unfavorable one,
toward the application of ordinary conflict pre-emption. The preemption provision itself favors pre-emption of state tort suits, while the
saving clause disfavors pre-emption at least some of the time. However, there is nothing in any natural reading of the two provisions that
would favor one policy over the other where a jury-imposed safety
standard actually conflicts with a federal safety standard. Pp. 869-874.

(c) This lawsuit actually conflicts with FMVSS 208 and the Act itself.
DOT saw FMVSS 208 not as a minimum standard, but as a way to
provide a manufacturer with a range of choices among different passive
restraint systems that would be gradually introduced, thereby lowering
costs, overcoming technical safety problems, encouraging technological
development, and winning widespread consumer acceptance--all of
which would promote FMVSS 208's safety objectives. The standard's
history helps explain why and how DOT sought these objectives. DOT
began instituting passive restraint requirements in 1970, but it always
permitted passive restraint options. Public resistance to an ignition
interlock device that in effect forced occupants to buckle up their manual
belts influenced DOT's subsequent initiatives. The 1984 version of
FMVSS 208 reflected several significant considerations regarding the
effectiveness of manual seatbelts and the likelihood that passengers
would leave their manual seatbelts unbuckled, the advantages and disadvantages of passive restraints, and the public's resistance to the installation or use of then-available passive restraint devices. Most importantly, it deliberately sought variety, rejecting an "all airbag"
standard because perceived or real safety concerns threatened a backlash more easily overcome with a mix of several different devices. A
mix would also help develop data on comparative effectiveness, allow
the industry time to overcome safety problems and high production
costs associated with airbags, and facilitate the development of alternative, cheaper, and safer passive restraint systems, thereby building
public confidence necessary to avoid an interlock-type fiasco. The
1984 standard also deliberately sought to gradually phase in passive

Syllabus
restraints, starting with a 10% requirement in 1987 vehicles. The
requirement was also conditional and would stay in effect only if twothirds of the States did not adopt mandatory buckle-up laws. A rule of
state tort law imposing a duty to install airbags in cars such as petitioners' would have presented an obstacle to the variety and mix of devices
that the federal regulation sought and to the phase-in that the federal
regulation deliberately imposed. It would also have made adoption of
state mandatory seatbelt laws less likely. This Court's pre-emption
cases assume compliance with the state law duty in question, and do not
turn on such compliance-related considerations as whether a private
party would ignore state legal obligations or how likely it is that state
law actually would be enforced. Finally, some weight is placed upon
DOT's interpretation of FMVSS 208's objectives and its conclusion that
a tort suit such as this one would stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of those objectives. DOT is likely to have a thorough understanding of its own regulation and its objectives and is
uniquely qualified to comprehend the likely impact of state requirements. Because there is no reason to suspect that the Solicitor General's representation of these views reflects anything other than the
agency's fair and considered judgment on the matter, DOT's failure in
promulgating FMVSS 208 to address pre-emption explicitly is not determinative. Nor do the agency's views, as presented here, lack coherence. Pp. 874-886.

Opinion of the Court
1987 vehicles with passive restraints. We ask whether theAct pre-empts a state common-law tort action in which the

plaintiff claims that the defendant auto manufacturer, whowas in compliance with the standard, should nonetheless
have equipped a 1987 automobile with airbags. We concludethat the Act, taken together with FMVSS 208, pre-empts
the lawsuit. I

In 1992, petitioner Alexis Geier, driving a 1987 Honda Ac-cord, collided with a tree and was seriously injured. The
car was equipped with manual shoulder and lap belts whichGeier had buckled up at the time. The car was not equipped
with airbags or other passive restraint devices.Geier and her parents, also petitioners, sued the car's manufacturer, American Honda Motor Company, Inc., and its af-filiates (hereinafter American Honda), under District of Columbia tort law. They claimed, among other things, thatAmerican Honda had designed its car negligently and defectively because it lacked a driver's side airbag. App. 3. TheDistrict Court dismissed the lawsuit. The court noted that
FMVSS 208 gave car manufacturers a choice as to whetherto install airbags. And the court concluded that petitioners'
lawsuit, because it sought to establish a different safetystandard--

i. e., an airbag requirement--was expressly pre-empted by a provision of the Act which pre-empts "any

safety standard" that is not identical to a federal safetystandard applicable to the same aspect of performance, 15
U. S. C. $ 1392(d) (1988 ed.); Civ. No. 95-CV-0064 (D. D. C.,Dec. 9, 1997), App. 17. (We, like the courts below and the
parties, refer to the pre-1994 version of the statute through-out the opinion; it has been recodified at 49 U. S. C. $ 30101
et seq.)The Court of Appeals agreed with the District Court's conclusion but on somewhat different reasoning. It had doubts,given the existence of the Act's "saving" clause, 15 U. S. C.

Opinion of the Court
tential creation of the kind of "safety standard" to which theSafety Act's express pre-emption provision refers. But it

declined to resolve that question because it found that peti-tioners' state-law tort claims posed an obstacle to the accomplishment of FMVSS 208's objectives. For that reason, itfound that those claims conflicted with FMVSS 208, and that,
under ordinary pre-emption principles, the Act consequently
pre-empted the lawsuit. The Court of Appeals thus af-firmed the District Court's dismissal. 166 F. 3d 1236, 1238-

1243 (CADC 1999).Several state courts have held to the contrary, namely, that
neither the Act's express pre-emption nor FMVSS 208 preempts a "no airbag" tort suit. See, e. g., Drattel v. Toyota
Motor Corp., 92 N. Y. 2d 35, 43-53, 699 N. E. 2d 376, 379-386
(1998); Minton v. Honda of America Mfg., Inc., 80 Ohio
St. 3d 62, 70-79, 684 N. E. 2d 648, 655-661 (1997); Munroe v.
Galati, 189 Ariz. 113, 115-119, 938 P. 2d 1114, 1116-1120
(1997); Wilson v. Pleasant, 660 N. E. 2d 327, 330-339 (Ind.
1995); Tebbetts v. Ford Motor Co., 140 N. H. 203, 206-207,
665 A. 2d 345, 347-348 (1995). All of the Federal Circuit
Courts that have considered the question, however, have
found pre-emption. One rested its conclusion on the Act's
express pre-emption provision. See, e. g., Harris v. Ford
Motor Co., 110 F. 3d 1410, 1413-1415 (CA9 1997). Others,
such as the Court of Appeals below, have instead found preemption under ordinary pre-emption principles by virtue of
the conflict such suits pose to FMVSS 208's objectives, and
thus to the Act itself. See, e. g., Montag v. Honda Motor
Co., 75 F. 3d 1414, 1417 (CA10 1996); Pokorny v. Ford Motor
Co., 902 F. 2d 1116, 1121-1125 (CA3 1990); Taylor v. General
Motors Corp., 875 F. 2d 816, 825-827 (CA11 1989); Wood v.
General Motors Corp., 865 F. 2d 395, 412-414 (CA1 1988).
We granted certiorari to resolve these differences. We now
hold that this kind of "no airbag" lawsuit conflicts with the
objectives of FMVSS 208, a standard authorized by the Act,
and is therefore pre-empted by the Act.

Opinion of the Court
In reaching our conclusion, we consider three subsidiaryquestions. First, does the Act's express pre-emption provision pre-empt this lawsuit? We think not. Second, do or-dinary pre-emption principles nonetheless apply? We hold
that they do. Third, does this lawsuit actually conflict withFMVSS 208, hence with the Act itself? We hold that it
does. II

We first ask whether the Safety Act's express pre-emptionprovision pre-empts this tort action. The provision reads
as follows:

"Whenever a Federal motor vehicle safety standard es-tablished under this subchapter is in effect, no State or

political subdivision of a State shall have any authorityeither to establish, or to continue in effect, with respect
to any motor vehicle or item of motor vehicle equip-ment[,] any safety standard applicable to the same aspect of performance of such vehicle or item of equipmentwhich is not identical to the Federal standard." 15
U. S. C. $ 1392(d) (1988 ed.).
American Honda points out that a majority of this Court hassaid that a somewhat similar statutory provision in a different federal statute--a provision that uses the word "require-ments"--may well expressly pre-empt similar tort actions.
See, e. g., Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U. S. 470, 502-504(1996) (plurality opinion);

id., at 503-505 (Breyer, J., concur-ring in part and concurring in judgment); id., at 509-512

(O'Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).Petitioners reply that this statute speaks of pre-empting a
state-law "safety standard," not a "requirement," and that atort action does not involve a safety standard. Hence, they
conclude, the express pre-emption provision does not apply.We need not determine the precise significance of the use
of the word "standard," rather than "requirement," however,for the Act contains another provision, which resolves the

529US3 Unit: $U62 [09-26-01 12:54:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN
868 GEIER v. AMERICAN HONDA MOTOR CO.

Opinion of the Court
disagreement. That provision, a "saving" clause, says that"[c]ompliance with" a federal safety standard "does not exempt any person from any liability under common law." 15U. S. C. $ 1397(k) (1988 ed.). The saving clause assumes that
there are some significant number of common-law liabilitycases to save. And a reading of the express pre-emption
provision that excludes common-law tort actions gives actual
meaning to the saving clause's literal language, while leavingadequate room for state tort law to operate--for example,

where federal law creates only a floor, i. e., a minimum safetystandard. See,

e. g., Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 21 (explaining that common-law claim that a vehicle is
defectively designed because it lacks antilock brakes would
not be pre-empted by 49 CFR $ 571.105 (1999), a safety
standard establishing minimum requirements for brake performance). Without the saving clause, a broad reading of
the express pre-emption provision arguably might pre-empt
those actions, for, as we have just mentioned, it is possible
to read the pre-emption provision, standing alone, as applying to standards imposed in common-law tort actions, as well
as standards contained in state legislation or regulations.
And if so, it would pre-empt all nonidentical state standards
established in tort actions covering the same aspect of performance as an applicable federal standard, even if the federal standard merely established a minimum standard. On
that broad reading of the pre-emption clause little, if any,
potential "liability at common law" would remain. And few,
if any, state tort actions would remain for the saving clause
to save. We have found no convincing indication that Congress wanted to pre-empt, not only state statutes and regulations, but also common-law tort actions, in such circumstances. Hence the broad reading cannot be correct. The
language of the pre-emption provision permits a narrow
reading that excludes common-law actions. Given the presence of the saving clause, we conclude that the pre-emption
clause must be so read.

Opinion of the Court

III
We have just said that the saving clause at least removestort actions from the scope of the express pre-emption

clause. Does it do more? In particular, does it foreclose orlimit the operation of ordinary pre-emption principles insofar
as those principles instruct us to read statutes as pre-empting state laws (including common-law rules) that "actually conflict" with the statute or federal standards promul-gated thereunder?

Fidelity Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. Dela Cuesta, 458 U. S. 141, 153 (1982). Petitioners concede, as

they must in light of Freightliner Corp. v. Myrick, 514 U. S.280 (1995), that the pre-emption provision, by itself, does not
foreclose (through negative implication) "any possibility ofimplied [conflict] pre-emption,"

id., at 288 (discussing Cipol-lone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U. S. 504, 517-518 (1992)).

But they argue that the saving clause has that very effect.We recognize that, when this Court previously considered
the pre-emptive effect of the statute's language, it appearedto leave open the question of how, or the extent to which,
the saving clause saves state-law tort actions that conflictwith federal regulations promulgated under the Act. See
Freightliner, supra, at 287, n. 3 (declining to addresswhether the saving clause prevents a manufacturer from
"us[ing] a federal safety standard to immunize itself fromstate common-law liability"). We now conclude that the saving clause (like the express pre-emption provision) does notbar the ordinary working of conflict pre-emption principles.

Nothing in the language of the saving clause suggests anintent to save state-law tort actions that conflict with federal
regulations. The words "[c]ompliance" and "does not ex-empt," 15 U. S. C. $ 1397(k) (1988 ed.), sound as if they simply
bar a special kind of defense, namely, a defense that compli-ance with a federal standard automatically exempts a defendant from state law, whether the Federal Governmentmeant that standard to be an absolute requirement or only a
minimum one. See Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products

Opinion of the Court
Liability $ 4(b), Comment e (1997) (distinguishing betweenstate-law compliance defense and a federal claim of preemption). It is difficult to understand why Congress wouldhave insisted on a compliance-with-federal-regulation precondition to the provision's applicability had it wished theAct to "save" all state-law tort actions, regardless of their
potential threat to the objectives of federal safety standards
promulgated under that Act. Nor does our interpretationconflict with the purpose of the saving provision, say, by

rendering it ineffectual. As we have previously explained,the saving provision still makes clear that the express
pre-emption provision does not of its own force pre-empt
common-law tort actions. And it thereby preserves those
actions that seek to establish greater safety than the minimum safety achieved by a federal regulation intended to provide a floor. See supra, at 867-868.

Moreover, this Court has repeatedly "decline[d] to give
broad effect to saving clauses where doing so would upset
the careful regulatory scheme established by federal law."
United States v. Locke, ante, at 106-107; see American Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. Central Office Telephone, Inc., 524
U. S. 214, 227-228 (1998) (AT&T); Texas & Pacific R. Co. v.
Abilene Cotton Oil Co., 204 U. S. 426, 446 (1907). We find
this concern applicable in the present case. And we conclude that the saving clause foresees--it does not foreclose--
the possibility that a federal safety standard will pre-empt a
state common-law tort action with which it conflicts. We do
not understand the dissent to disagree, for it acknowledges
that ordinary pre-emption principles apply, at least sometimes. Post, at 899-900 (opinion of Stevens, J.).

Neither do we believe that the pre-emption provision, the
saving provision, or both together, create some kind of "special burden" beyond that inherent in ordinary pre-emption
principles--which "special burden" would specially disfavor
pre-emption here. Cf. post, at 898-899. The two provisions, read together, reflect a neutral policy, not a specially

871Cite as: 529 U. S. 861 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
favorable or unfavorable policy, toward the application of or-dinary conflict pre-emption principles. On the one hand, the

pre-emption provision itself reflects a desire to subject theindustry to a single, uniform set of federal safety standards.
Its pre-emption of all state standards, even those that mightstand in harmony with federal law, suggests an intent to
avoid the conflict, uncertainty, cost, and occasional risk to
safety itself that too many different safety-standard cooksmight otherwise create. See H. R. Rep. No. 1776, 89th

Cong., 2d Sess., 17 (1966) ("Basically, this preemption subsec-tion is intended to result in uniformity of standards so that
the public as well as industry will be guided by one set of
criteria rather than by a multiplicity of diverse standards");
S. Rep. No. 1301, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., 12 (1966). This policy
by itself favors pre-emption of state tort suits, for the rules
of law that judges and juries create or apply in such suits
may themselves similarly create uncertainty and even conflict, say, when different juries in different States reach different decisions on similar facts.

On the other hand, the saving clause reflects a congressional determination that occasional nonuniformity is a small
price to pay for a system in which juries not only create, but
also enforce, safety standards, while simultaneously providing necessary compensation to victims. That policy by itself
disfavors pre-emption, at least some of the time. But we
can find nothing in any natural reading of the two provisions
that would favor one set of policies over the other where a
jury-imposed safety standard actually conflicts with a federal
safety standard.

Why, in any event, would Congress not have wanted ordinary pre-emption principles to apply where an actual conflict
with a federal objective is at stake? Some such principle is
needed. In its absence, state law could impose legal duties
that would conflict directly with federal regulatory mandates, say, by premising liability upon the presence of the
very windshield retention requirements that federal law re529US3 Unit: $U62 [09-26-01 12:54:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN
872 GEIER v. AMERICAN HONDA MOTOR CO.

Opinion of the Court
quires. See, e. g., 49 CFR $ 571.212 (1999). Insofar as peti-tioners' argument would permit common-law actions that

"actually conflict" with federal regulations, it would takefrom those who would enforce a federal law the very ability
to achieve the law's congressionally mandated objectives thatthe Constitution, through the operation of ordinary preemption principles, seeks to protect. To the extent that
such an interpretation of the saving provision reads into aparticular federal law toleration of a conflict that those principles would otherwise forbid, it permits that law to defeatits own objectives, or potentially, as the Court has put it
before, to " `destroy itself.' " AT&T, supra, at 228 (quoting
Abilene Cotton, supra, at 446). We do not claim that Congress lacks the constitutional power to write a statute that
mandates such a complex type of state/federal relationship.
Cf. post, at 900, n. 16. But there is no reason to believe
Congress has done so here.

The dissent, as we have said, contends nonetheless that
the express pre-emption and saving provisions here, taken
together, create a "special burden," which a court must impose "on a party" who claims conflict pre-emption under
those principles. Post, at 898. But nothing in the Safety
Act's language refers to any "special burden." Nor can one
find the basis for a "special burden" in this Court's precedents. It is true that, in Freightliner Corp. v. Myrick, 514
U. S. 280 (1995), the Court said, in the context of interpreting
the Safety Act, that "[a]t best" there is an "inference that an
express pre-emption clause forecloses implied pre-emption."
Id., at 289 (emphasis added). But the Court made this statement in the course of rejecting the more absolute argument
that the presence of the express pre-emption provision entirely foreclosed the possibility of conflict pre-emption. Id.,
at 288. The statement, headed with the qualifier "[a]t best,"
and made in a case where, without any need for inferences
or "special burdens," state law obviously would survive, see
id., at 289-290, simply preserves a legal possibility. This

529US3 Unit: $U62 [09-26-01 12:54:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN

873Cite as: 529 U. S. 861 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
Court did not hold that the Safety Act does create a "specialburden," or still less that such a burden necessarily arises

from the limits of an express pre-emption provision. Andconsiderations of language, purpose, and administrative
workability, together with the principles underlying thisCourt's pre-emption doctrine discussed above, make clear
that the express pre-emption provision imposes no unusual,
"special burden" against pre-emption. For similar reasons,we do not see the basis for interpreting the saving clause to

impose any such burden.A "special burden" would also promise practical difficulty
by further complicating well-established pre-emption principles that already are difficult to apply. The dissent does not
contend that this "special burden" would apply in a case in
which state law penalizes what federal law requires--i. e., a
case of impossibility. See post, at 892-893, n. 6, 900, n. 16.
But if it would not apply in such a case, then how, or when,
would it apply? This Court, when describing conflict preemption, has spoken of pre-empting state law that "under
the circumstances of th[e] particular case . . . stands as an
obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress"--whether that "obstacle"
goes by the name of "conflicting; contrary to; . . . repugnance;
difference; irreconcilability; inconsistency; violation; curtailment; . . . interference," or the like. Hines v. Davidowitz,
312 U. S. 52, 67 (1941); see Jones v. Rath Packing Co., 430
U. S. 519, 526 (1977). The Court has not previously driven a
legal wedge--only a terminological one--between "conflicts"
that prevent or frustrate the accomplishment of a federal
objective and "conflicts" that make it "impossible" for private parties to comply with both state and federal law.
Rather, it has said that both forms of conflicting state law
are "nullified" by the Supremacy Clause, De la Cuesta, 458
U. S., at 152-153; see Locke, ante, at 109; English v. General
Elec. Co., 496 U. S. 72, 78-79 (1990), and it has assumed that
Congress would not want either kind of conflict. The Court

874 GEIER v. AMERICAN HONDA MOTOR CO.

Opinion of the Court
has thus refused to read general "saving" provisions to toler-ate actual conflict both in cases involving impossibility, see,

e. g., AT&T, 524 U. S., at 228, and in "frustration-of-purpose"cases, see, e. g., Locke, ante, at 103-112; International Paper
Co. v. Ouellette, 479 U. S. 481, 493-494 (1987); see also Chi-cago & North Western Transp. Co. v. Kalo Brick & Tile Co.,
450 U. S. 311, 328-331 (1981). We see no grounds, then,for attempting to distinguish among types of federal-state
conflict for purposes of analyzing whether such a conflictwarrants pre-emption in a particular case. That kind of
analysis, moreover, would engender legal uncertainty withits inevitable systemwide costs (

e. g., conflicts, delay, andexpense) as courts tried sensibly to distinguish among varieties of "conflict" (which often shade, one into the other)when applying this complicated rule to the many federal
statutes that contain some form of an express pre-emptionprovision, a saving provision, or as here, both. Nothing in
the statute suggests Congress wanted to complicate ordinaryexperience-proved principles of conflict pre-emption with an
added "special burden." Indeed, the dissent's willingness toimpose a "special burden" here stems ultimately from its
view that "frustration-of-purpos[e]" conflict pre-emption is afreewheeling, "inadequately considered" doctrine that might
well be "eliminate[d]." Post, at 907-908, and n. 22. In aword, ordinary pre-emption principles, grounded in longstanding precedent, Hines, supra, at 67, apply. We wouldnot further complicate the law with complex new doctrine.

IV
The basic question, then, is whether a common-law "noairbag" action like the one before us actually conflicts with

FMVSS 208. We hold that it does.In petitioners' and the dissent's view, FMVSS 208 sets a
minimum airbag standard. As far as FMVSS 208 is con-cerned, the more airbags, and the sooner, the better. But
that was not the Secretary's view. The Department of

Opinion of the Court
Transportation's (DOT's) comments, which accompanied thepromulgation of FMVSS 208, make clear that the standard

deliberately provided the manufacturer with a range ofchoices among different passive restraint devices. Those
choices would bring about a mix of different devices intro-duced gradually over time; and FMVSS 208 would thereby
lower costs, overcome technical safety problems, encouragetechnological development, and win widespread consumer
acceptance--all of which would promote FMVSS 208's safetyobjectives. See generally 49 Fed. Reg. 28962 (1984).

A
The history of FMVSS 208 helps explain why and howDOT sought these objectives. See generally

Motor VehicleMfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463 U. S. 29, 34-38 (1983). In 1967, DOT,understanding that seatbelts would save many lives, required manufacturers to install manual seatbelts in all auto-mobiles. 32 Fed. Reg. 2408, 2415. It became apparent,
however, that most occupants simply would not buckle uptheir belts. See 34 Fed. Reg. 11148 (1969). DOT then
began to investigate the feasibility of requiring "passive re-straints," such as airbags and automatic seatbelts. Ibid.
In 1970, it amended FMVSS 208 to include some passive pro-tection requirements, 35 Fed. Reg. 16927, while making clear
that airbags were one of several "equally acceptable" devicesand that it neither " `favored' [n]or expected the introduction
of airbag systems." Ibid. In 1971, it added an express pro-vision permitting compliance through the use of nondetachable passive belts, 36 Fed. Reg. 12858, 12859, and in 1972, itmandated full passive protection for all front seat occupants
for vehicles manufactured after August 15, 1975, 37 Fed.Reg. 3911. Although the agency's focus was originally on
airbags, 34 Fed. Reg. 11148 (1969) (notice of proposed rule-making);

State Farm, 463 U. S., at 35, n. 4; see also id., at 46,n. 11 (noting view of commentators that, as of 1970, FMVSS

Opinion of the Court
208 was " `a de facto airbag mandate' " because of the stateof passive restraint technology), at no point did FMVSS 208

formally require the use of airbags. From the start, as in1984, it permitted passive restraint options.

DOT gave manufacturers a further choice for new vehiclesmanufactured between 1972 and August 1975. Manufacturers could either install a passive restraint device such as automatic seatbelts or airbags or retain manual belts and addan "ignition interlock" device that in effect forced occupants

to buckle up by preventing the ignition otherwise from turn-ing on. 37 Fed. Reg. 3911 (1972). The interlock soon became popular with manufacturers. And in 1974, when the
agency approved the use of detachable automatic seatbelts,
it conditioned that approval by providing that such systems
must include an interlock system and a continuous warning
buzzer to encourage reattachment of the belt. 39 Fed. Reg.
14593. But the interlock and buzzer devices were most unpopular with the public. And Congress, responding to public pressure, passed a law that forbade DOT from requiring,
or permitting compliance by means of, such devices. Motor
Vehicle and Schoolbus Safety Amendments of 1974, $ 109, 88
Stat. 1482 (previously codified at 15 U. S. C. $ 1410b(b) (1988
ed.)).

That experience influenced DOT's subsequent passive restraint initiatives. In 1976, DOT Secretary William T. Coleman, Jr., fearing continued public resistance, suspended the
passive restraint requirements. He sought to win public acceptance for a variety of passive restraint devices through a
demonstration project that would involve about half a million
new automobiles. State Farm, supra, at 37. But his successor, Brock Adams, canceled the project, instead amending
FMVSS 208 to require passive restraints, principally either
airbags or passive seatbelts. 42 Fed. Reg. 34289 (1977).

Andrew Lewis, a new DOT Secretary in a new administration, rescinded the Adams requirements, primarily because
DOT learned that the industry planned to satisfy those

Opinion of the Court
requirements almost exclusively through the installationof detachable automatic seatbelts. 46 Fed. Reg. 53419-

53420 (1981). This Court held the rescission unlawful.State Farm, supra, at 34, 46. And the stage was set for
then-DOT Secretary, Elizabeth Dole, to amend FMVSS 208once again, promulgating the version that is now before us.
49 Fed. Reg. 28962 (1984). B

Read in light of this history, DOT's own contemporaneousexplanation of FMVSS 208 makes clear that the 1984 version
of FMVSS 208 reflected the following significant considera-tions. First, buckled up seatbelts are a vital ingredient of
automobile safety. Id., at 29003; State Farm, supra, at 52("We start with the accepted ground that if used, seatbelts
unquestionably would save many thousands of lives andwould prevent tens of thousands of crippling injuries").
Second, despite the enormous and unnecessary risks that apassenger runs by not buckling up manual lap and shoulder
belts, more than 80% of front seat passengers would leavetheir manual seatbelts unbuckled. 49 Fed. Reg. 28983 (1984)
(estimating that only 12.5% of front seat passengers buckledup manual belts). Third, airbags could make up for the dangers caused by unbuckled manual belts, but they could notmake up for them entirely.

Id., at 28986 (concluding that,although an airbag plus a lap and shoulder belt was the most

"effective" system, airbags alone were less effective thanbuckled up manual lap and shoulder belts).

Fourth, passive restraint systems had their own disadvan-tages, for example, the dangers associated with, intrusiveness of, and corresponding public dislike for, nondetach-able automatic belts.

Id., at 28992-28993. Fifth, airbagsbrought with them their own special risks to safety, such

as the risk of danger to out-of-position occupants (usuallychildren) in small cars. Id., at 28992, 29001; see also 65
Fed. Reg. 30680, 30681-30682 (2000) (finding 158 confirmedairbag-induced fatalities as of April 2000, and amending rule

Opinion of the Court
to add new requirements, test procedures, and injury criteriato ensure that "future air bags be designed to create less

risk of serious airbag-induced injuries than current air bags,particularly for small women and young children"); U. S.
Dept. of Transportation, National Highway Traffic SafetyAdministration, National Accident Sampling System Crashworthiness Data System 1991-1993, p. viii (Aug. 1995) (finding that airbags caused approximately 54,000 injuries be-tween 1991 and 1993).

Sixth, airbags were expected to be significantly moreexpensive than other passive restraint devices, raising the
average cost of a vehicle price $320 for full frontal airbags
over the cost of a car with manual lap and shoulder seatbelts
(and potentially much more if production volumes were low).
49 Fed. Reg. 28990 (1984). And the agency worried that the
high replacement cost--estimated to be $800--could lead car
owners to refuse to replace them after deployment. Id., at
28990, 29000-29001; see also id., at 28990 (estimating total
investment costs for mandatory airbag requirement at $1.3
billion compared to $500 million for automatic seatbelts).
Seventh, the public, for reasons of cost, fear, or physical intrusiveness, might resist installation or use of any of the
then-available passive restraint devices, id., at 28987-
28989--a particular concern with respect to airbags, id., at
29001 (noting that "[a]irbags engendered the largest quantity
of, and most vociferously worded, comments").

FMVSS 208 reflected these considerations in several ways.
Most importantly, that standard deliberately sought variety--a mix of several different passive restraint systems.
It did so by setting a performance requirement for passive
restraint devices and allowing manufacturers to choose
among different passive restraint mechanisms, such as airbags, automatic belts, or other passive restraint technologies
to satisfy that requirement. Id., at 28996. And DOT explained why FMVSS 208 sought the mix of devices that
it expected its performance standard to produce. Id., at

529US3 Unit: $U62 [09-26-01 12:54:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN

879Cite as: 529 U. S. 861 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
28997. DOT wrote that it had rejected a proposed FMVSS208 "all airbag" standard because of safety concerns (perceived or real) associated with airbags, which concernsthreatened a "backlash" more easily overcome "if airbags"
were "not the only way of complying." Id., at 29001. Itadded that a mix of devices would help develop data on
comparative effectiveness, would allow the industry time to
overcome the safety problems and the high production costsassociated with airbags, and would facilitate the development of alternative, cheaper, and safer passive restraint sys-tems.

Id., at 29001-29002. And it would thereby build
public confidence, id., at 29001-29002, necessary to avoid
another interlock-type fiasco.

The 1984 FMVSS 208 standard also deliberately sought a
gradual phase-in of passive restraints. Id., at 28999-29000.
It required the manufacturers to equip only 10% of their car
fleet manufactured after September 1, 1986, with passive restraints. Id., at 28999. It then increased the percentage in
three annual stages, up to 100% of the new car fleet for cars
manufactured after September 1, 1989. Ibid. And it explained that the phased-in requirement would allow more
time for manufacturers to develop airbags or other, better,
safer passive restraint systems. It would help develop information about the comparative effectiveness of different
systems, would lead to a mix in which airbags and other nonseatbelt passive restraint systems played a more prominent
role than would otherwise result, and would promote public
acceptance. Id., at 29000-29001.

Of course, as the dissent points out, post, at 903, FMVSS
208 did not guarantee the mix by setting a ceiling for each
different passive restraint device. In fact, it provided a
form of extra credit for airbag installation (and other nonbelt
passive restraint devices) under which each airbag-installed
vehicle counted as 1.5 vehicles for purposes of meeting
FMVSS 208's passive restraint requirement. 49 CFR

$ 571.208, S4.1.3.4(a)(1) (1999); 49 Fed. Reg. 29000 (1984).

529US3 Unit: $U62 [09-26-01 12:54:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN
880 GEIER v. AMERICAN HONDA MOTOR CO.

Opinion of the Court
But why should DOT have bothered to impose an airbag ceil-ing when the practical threat to the mix it desired arose from

the likelihood that manufacturers would install, not too manyairbags too quickly, but too few or none at all? After all,
only a few years earlier, Secretary Dole's predecessor haddiscovered that manufacturers intended to meet the thencurrent passive restraint requirement almost entirely (more
than 99%) through the installation of more affordable auto-matic belt systems. 46 Fed. Reg. 53421 (1981);

State Farm,
463 U. S., at 38. The extra credit, as DOT explained, wasdesigned to "encourage manufacturers to equip

at least some
of their cars with airbags." 49 Fed. Reg. 29001 (1984) (emphasis added) (responding to comment that failure to mandate airbags might mean the "end of . . . airbag technology");
see also id., at 29000 (explaining that the extra credit for
airbags "should promote the development of what may be
better alternatives to automatic belts than would otherwise
be developed" (emphasis added)). The credit provision reinforces the point that FMVSS 208 sought a gradually developing mix of passive restraint devices; it does not show the
contrary.

Finally, FMVSS 208's passive restraint requirement was
conditional. DOT believed that ordinary manual lap and
shoulder belts would produce about the same amount of
safety as passive restraints, and at significantly lower
costs--if only auto occupants would buckle up. See id., at
28997-28998. Thus, FMVSS 208 provided for rescission of
its passive restraint requirement if, by September 1, 1989,
two-thirds of the States had laws in place that, like those of
many other nations, required auto occupants to buckle up
(and which met other requirements specified in the standard). Id., at 28963, 28993-28994, 28997-28999. The Secretary wrote that "coverage of a large percentage of the American people by seatbelt laws that are enforced would largely
negate the incremental increase in safety to be expected
from an automatic protection requirement." Id., at 28997.

881Cite as: 529 U. S. 861 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
In the end, two-thirds of the States did not enact mandatorybuckle-up laws, and the passive restraint requirement remained in effect.In sum, as DOT now tells us through the Solicitor General,
the 1984 version of FMVSS 208 "embodies the Secretary'spolicy judgment that safety would best be promoted if manufacturers installed alternative protection systems in their
fleets rather than one particular system in every car." Brieffor United States as

Amicus Curiae 25; see 49 Fed. Reg.
28997 (1984). Petitioners' tort suit claims that the manufac-turers of the 1987 Honda Accord "had a duty to design, manufacture, distribute and sell a motor vehicle with an effective
and safe passive restraint system, including, but not limited
to, airbags." App. 3 (Complaint, || 11).

In effect, petitioners' tort action depends upon its claim
that manufacturers had a duty to install an airbag when they
manufactured the 1987 Honda Accord. Such a state law--
i. e., a rule of state tort law imposing such a duty--by its
terms would have required manufacturers of all similar cars
to install airbags rather than other passive restraint systems, such as automatic belts or passive interiors. It
thereby would have presented an obstacle to the variety and
mix of devices that the federal regulation sought. It would
have required all manufacturers to have installed airbags in
respect to the entire District-of-Columbia-related portion of
their 1987 new car fleet, even though FMVSS 208 at that
time required only that 10% of a manufacturer's nationwide
fleet be equipped with any passive restraint device at all. It
thereby also would have stood as an obstacle to the gradual
passive restraint phase-in that the federal regulation deliberately imposed. In addition, it could have made less likely
the adoption of a state mandatory buckle-up law. Because
the rule of law for which petitioners contend would have
stood "as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution
of " the important means-related federal objectives that we
have just discussed, it is pre-empted. Hines, 312 U. S., at

67; see also Ouellette, 479 U. S., at 493; De la Cuesta, 458U. S., at 156 (finding conflict and pre-emption where state

law limited the availability of an option that the fed-eral agency considered essential to ensure its ultimate
objectives).Petitioners ask this Court to calculate the precise size of
the "obstacle," with the aim of minimizing it, by considering
the risk of tort liability and a successful tort action'sincentive-related or timing-related compliance effects. See

Brief for Petitioners 45-50. The dissent agrees. Post, at900-905. But this Court's pre-emption cases do not ordinarily turn on such compliance-related considerations as
whether a private party in practice would ignore state legal
obligations--paying, say, a fine instead--or how likely it
is that state law actually would be enforced. Rather, this
Court's pre-emption cases ordinarily assume compliance
with the state-law duty in question. The Court has on occasion suggested that tort law may be somewhat different, and
that related considerations--for example, the ability to pay
damages instead of modifying one's behavior--may be relevant for pre-emption purposes. See Goodyear Atomic Corp.
v. Miller, 486 U. S. 174, 185 (1988); Cipollone, 505 U. S., at
536-539 (Blackmun, J., concurring in part, concurring in
judgment in part, and dissenting in part); see also English,
496 U. S., at 86; Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp., 464 U. S. 238,
256 (1984). In other cases, the Court has found tort law to
conflict with federal law without engaging in that kind of
an analysis. See, e. g., Ouellette, supra, at 494-497; Kalo
Brick, 450 U. S., at 324-332. We need not try to resolve
these differences here, however, for the incentive or compliance considerations upon which the dissent relies cannot, by
themselves, change the legal result. Some of those considerations rest on speculation, see, e. g., post, at 901 (predicting
risk of "no airbag " liability and manufacturers' likely response to such liability); some rest in critical part upon the
dissenters' own view of FMVSS 208's basic purposes--a view

Opinion of the Court
which we reject, see, e. g., post, at 901-904 (suggesting thatpre-existing risk of "no airbag" liability would have made

FMVSS 208 unnecessary); and others, if we understand themcorrectly, seem less than persuasive, see,

e. g., post, at 902
(suggesting that manufacturers could have complied with amandatory state airbag duty by installing a

different kind of
passive restraint device). And in so concluding, we do not
"put the burden" of proving pre-emption on petitioners.
Post, at 907. We simply find unpersuasive their arguments
attempting to undermine the Government's demonstration ofactual conflict.

One final point: We place some weight upon DOT's interpretation of FMVSS 208's objectives and its conclusion, as
set forth in the Government's brief, that a tort suit such as
this one would " `stan[d] as an obstacle to the accomplishment
and execution' " of those objectives. Brief for United States
as Amicus Curiae 25-26 (quoting Hines, supra, at 67).
Congress has delegated to DOT authority to implement the
statute; the subject matter is technical; and the relevant
history and background are complex and extensive. The
agency is likely to have a thorough understanding of its own
regulation and its objectives and is "uniquely qualified" to
comprehend the likely impact of state requirements. Medtronic, 518 U. S., at 496; see id., at 506 (Breyer, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). And DOT has
explained FMVSS 208's objectives, and the interference that
"no airbag" suits pose thereto, consistently over time. Brief
for United States as Amicus Curiae in Freightliner Corp. v.
Myrick, O. T. 1994, No. 94-286, pp. 28-29; Brief for United
States as Amicus Curiae in Wood v. General Motors Corp.,
O. T. 1989, No. 89-46, pp. 7, 11-16. In these circumstances,
the agency's own views should make a difference. See City

884 GEIER v. AMERICAN HONDA MOTOR CO.

Opinion of the Court
We have no reason to suspect that the Solicitor General'srepresentation of DOT's views reflects anything other than

"the agency's fair and considered judgment on the matter."
Auer v. Robbins, 519 U. S. 452, 461-462 (1997); cf. Hillsborough County, supra, at 721 (expressing reluctance, in theabsence of strong evidence, to find an actual conflict between

state law and federal regulation where agency that promulgated the regulation had not, at the time the regulation waspromulgated

or subsequently, concluded that such a conflict
existed). The failure of the Federal Register to addresspre-emption explicitly is thus not determinative.

The dissent would require a formal agency statement of
pre-emptive intent as a prerequisite to concluding that a conflict exists. It relies on cases, or portions thereof, that did
not involve conflict pre-emption. See post, at 908-909; California Coastal Comm'n v. Granite Rock Co., 480 U. S. 572,
583 (1987); Hillsborough, supra, at 718. And conflict preemption is different in that it turns on the identification of
"actual conflict," and not on an express statement of preemptive intent. English, supra, at 78-79; see Hillsborough, supra, at 720-721; Jones, 430 U. S., at 540-543. While
"[p]re-emption fundamentally is a question of congressional
intent," English, supra, at 78, this Court traditionally distinguishes between "express" and "implied" pre-emptive intent,
and treats "conflict" pre-emption as an instance of the latter.
See, e. g., Freightliner, 514 U. S., at 287; English, supra, at
78-79; see also Cipollone, supra, at 545, 547-548 (Scalia, J.,
concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). And
though the Court has looked for a specific statement of preemptive intent where it is claimed that the mere "volume
and complexity" of agency regulations demonstrate an implicit intent to displace all state law in a particular area,
Hillsborough, supra, at 717; see post, at 908-909, n. 23--
so-called "field pre-emption"--the Court has never before required a specific, formal agency statement identifying conflict in order to conclude that such a conflict in fact exists.

Opinion of the Court
Indeed, one can assume that Congress or an agency ordi-narily would not intend to permit a significant conflict.

While we certainly accept the dissent's basic position that acourt should not find pre-emption too readily in the absence
of clear evidence of a conflict, English, supra, at 90, for thereasons set out above we find such evidence here. To insist
on a specific expression of agency intent to pre-empt, made
after notice-and-comment rulemaking, would be in certaincases to tolerate conflicts that an agency, and therefore Congress, is most unlikely to have intended. The dissent, as wehave said, apparently welcomes that result, at least where
"frustration-of-purpos[e]" pre-emption by agency regulationis at issue.

Post, at 907-908, and n. 22. We do not.
Nor do we agree with the dissent that the agency's views,as presented here, lack coherence.

Post, at 904-905. The
dissent points, ibid., to language in the Government's briefstating that

"a claim that a manufacturer should have chosen to in-stall airbags rather than another type of passive restraint in a certain model of car because of other design
features particular to that car . . . would not necessarily
frustrate Standard 208's purposes." Brief for UnitedStates as

Amicus Curiae 26, n. 23 (emphasis added).

And the dissent says that these words amount to a conces-sion that there is no conflict in this very case.

Post, at 905.
But that is not what the words say. Rather, as the italicizedphrase emphasizes, they simply leave open the question

whether FMVSS 208 would pre-empt a different kind of tortcase--one

not at issue here. It is possible that some special
design-related circumstance concerning a particular kind of
car might require airbags, rather than automatic belts, and
that a suit seeking to impose that requirement could escape
pre-emption--say, because it would affect so few cars that
its rule of law would not create a legal "obstacle" to 208's
mixed-fleet, gradual objective. But that is not what peti529US3 Unit: $U62 [09-26-01 12:54:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Stevens, J., dissenting
tioners claimed. They have argued generally that, to besafe, a car must have an airbag. See App. 4.

Regardless, the language of FMVSS 208 and the contem-poraneous 1984 DOT explanation is clear enough--even
without giving DOT's own view special weight. FMVSS208 sought a gradually developing mix of alternative passive
restraint devices for safety-related reasons. The rule ofstate tort law for which petitioners argue would stand as
an "obstacle" to the accomplishment of that objective. Andthe statute foresees the application of ordinary principles
of pre-emption in cases of actual conflict. Hence, the tortaction is pre-empted.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.

It is so ordered.
Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Souter, Justice
Thomas, and Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.

Airbag technology has been available to automobile manu-facturers for over 30 years. There is now general agreement on the proposition "that, to be safe, a car must have anairbag." Ante this page. Indeed, current federal law imposes that requirement on all automobile manufacturers.See 49 U. S. C. $ 30127; 49 CFR $ 571.208, S4.1.5.3 (1998).
The question raised by petitioners' common-law tort actionis whether that proposition was sufficiently obvious when
Honda's 1987 Accord was manufactured to make the failureto install such a safety feature actionable under theories of
negligence or defective design. The Court holds that an in-terim regulation motivated by the Secretary of Transportation's desire to foster gradual development of a variety ofpassive restraint devices deprives state courts of jurisdiction
to answer that question. I respectfully dissent from thatholding, and especially from the Court's unprecedented extension of the doctrine of pre-emption. As a preface to anexplanation of my understanding of the statute and the regulation, these preliminary observations seem appropriate.

believe, however, that it is fair to state that if it had beenexpressly adopted by the Secretary of Transportation, it
would have read as follows:

"No state court shall entertain a common-law tort actionbased on a claim that an automobile was negligently or

defectively designed because it was not equipped withan airbag;
"Provided, however, that this rule shall not apply to carsmanufactured before September 1, 1986, or after such
time as the Secretary may require the installation ofairbags in all new cars; and
"Provided further, that this rule shall not preclude aclaim by a driver who was not wearing her seatbelt that
an automobile was negligently or defectively designedbecause it was not equipped with any passive restraint
whatsoever, or a claim that an automobile with particu-lar design features was negligently or defectively designed because it was equipped with one type of passiverestraint instead of another."

Perhaps such a rule would be a wise component of a legisla-tive reform of our tort system. I express no opinion about

that possibility. It is, however, quite clear to me that Con-gress neither enacted any such rule itself nor authorized the

Secretary of Transportation to do so. It is equally clear tome that the objectives that the Secretary intended to achieve
through the adoption of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Stand-ard 208 would not be frustrated one whit by allowing state
courts to determine whether in 1987 the lifesaving advan-tages of airbags had become sufficiently obvious that their
omission might constitute a design defect in some new cars.Finally, I submit that the Court is quite wrong to characterize its rejection of the presumption against pre-emption,and its reliance on history and regulatory commentary
rather than either statutory or regulatory text, as "ordi-nary experience-proved principles of conflict pre-emption."

The question presented is whether either the NationalTraffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 (Safety Act or
Act), 80 Stat. 718, 15 U. S. C. $ 1381 et seq. (1988 ed.),1 orthe version of Standard 208 promulgated by the Secretary
of Transportation in 1984, 49 CFR $ 571.208, S4.1.3-S4.1.4(1998), pre-empts common-law tort claims that an automobile
manufactured in 1987 was negligently and defectively de-signed because it lacked "an effective and safe passive restraint system, including, but not limited to, airbags."App. 3. In Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc.
v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463 U. S. 29, 34-38(1983), we reviewed the first chapters of the "complex and
convoluted history" of Standard 208. It was the "unaccept-ably high" rate of deaths and injuries caused by automobile
accidents that led to the enactment of the Safety Act in 1966.Id., at 33. The purpose of the Act, as stated by Congress,

Because the changes made to the Act as part of the recodification process
were not intended to be substantive, throughout this opinion I shall refer
to the pre-1994 version of the statute, as did the Court of Appeals.

was "to reduce traffic accidents and deaths and injuries topersons resulting from traffic accidents." 15 U. S. C. $ 1381.

The Act directed the Secretary of Transportation or his dele-gate to issue motor vehicle safety standards that "shall be
practicable, shall meet the need for motor vehicle safety, andshall be stated in objective terms." $ 1392(a). The Act defines the term "safety standard" as a "minimum standardfor motor vehicle performance, or motor vehicle equipment
performance." $ 1391(2).Standard 208 covers "[o]ccupant crash protection." Its
purpose "is to reduce the number of deaths of vehicle occu-pants, and the severity of injuries, by specifying vehicle
crashworthiness requirements . . . [and] equipment require-ments for active and passive restraint systems." 49 CFR

$ 571.208, S2 (1998). The first version of that standard, is-sued in 1967, simply required the installation of manual seatbelts in all automobiles. Two years later the Secretary for-mally proposed a revision that would require the installation
of "passive occupant restraint systems," that is to say, de-vices that do not depend for their effectiveness on any action
by the vehicle occupant. The airbag is one such system.2The Secretary's proposal led to a series of amendments to
Standard 208 that imposed various passive restraint require-ments, culminating in a 1977 regulation that mandated such
restraints in all cars by the model year 1984. The two com-mercially available restraints that could satisfy this mandate

2 "The airbag is an inflatable device concealed in the dashboard and
steering column. It automatically inflates when a sensor indicates that
deceleration forces from an accident have exceeded a preset minimum,
then rapidly deflates to dissipate those forces. The lifesaving potential of
these devices was immediately recognized, and in 1977, after substantial
on-the-road experience with both devices, it was estimated by [the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)] that passive restraints could prevent approximately 12,000 deaths and over 100,000 serious injuries annually. 42 Fed. Reg. 34298." Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn.

were airbags and automatic seatbelts; the regulation allowedeach vehicle manufacturer to choose which restraint to install. In 1981, however, following a change of administra-tion, the new Secretary first extended the deadline for compliance and then rescinded the passive restraint requirementaltogether. In Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn., we affirmed a decision by the Court of Appeals holding that this rescissionwas arbitrary. On remand, Secretary Elizabeth Dole promulgated the version of Standard 208 that is at issue inthis case.

The 1984 standard provided for a phase-in of passive re-straint requirements beginning with the 1987 model year.
In that year, vehicle manufacturers were required to equipa minimum of 10% of their new passenger cars with such
restraints. While the 1987 Honda Accord driven by Ms.Geier was not so equipped, it is undisputed that Honda complied with the 10% minimum by installing passive restraintsin certain other 1987 models. This minimum passive restraint requirement increased to 25% of 1988 models and 40%of 1989 models; the standard also mandated that "after September 1, 1989, all new cars must have automatic occupantcrash protection." 49 Fed. Reg. 28999 (1984); see 49 CFR

$ 571.208, S4.1.3-S4.1.4 (1998). In response to a 1991 amend-ment to the Safety Act, the Secretary amended the standard
to require that, beginning in the 1998 model year, all newcars have an airbag at both the driver's and right front passenger's positions.3Given that Secretary Dole promulgated the 1984 standard
in response to our opinion invalidating her predecessor's re-scission of the 1977 passive restraint requirement, she provided a full explanation for her decision not to require air3 See 49 U. S. C. $ 30127; 49 CFR $ 571.208, S4.1.5.3 (1998). Congress
stated that it did not intend its amendment or the Secretary's consequent
alteration of Standard 208 to affect the potential liability of vehicle manufacturers under applicable law related to vehicles with or without airbags.

bags in all cars and to phase in the new requirements. Theinitial 3-year delay was designed to give vehicle manufacturers adequate time for compliance. The decision to give man-ufacturers a choice between airbags and a different form of
passive restraint, such as an automatic seatbelt, was moti-vated in part by safety concerns and in part by a desire not
to retard the development of more effective systems. 49Fed. Reg. 29000-29001 (1984). An important safety concern
was the fear of a "public backlash" to an airbag mandatethat consumers might not fully understand. The Secretary
believed, however, that the use of airbags would avoid possi-ble public objections to automatic seatbelts and that many of
the public concerns regarding airbags were unfounded. Id.,at 28991.

Although the standard did not require airbags in all cars,it is clear that the Secretary did intend to encourage wider
use of airbags. One of her basic conclusions was that "[a]u-tomatic occupant protection systems that do not totally rely
upon belts, such as airbags . . . , offer significant additionalpotential for preventing fatalities and injuries, at least in
part because the American public is likely to find them lessintrusive; their development and availability should be encouraged through appropriate incentives." Id., at 28963; seealso id., at 28966, 28986 (noting conclusion of both Secretary
and manufacturers that airbags used in conjunction withmanual lap and shoulder belts would be "the most effective
system of all" for preventing fatalities and injuries). TheSecretary therefore included a phase-in period in order to
encourage manufacturers to comply with the standard by in-stalling airbags and other (perhaps more effective) nonbelt
technologies that they might develop, rather than by install-ing less expensive automatic seatbelts.

4 As a further incen4 "If the Department had required full compliance by September 1, 1987,
it is very likely all of the manufacturers would have had to comply through
the use of automatic belts. Thus, by phasing-in the requirement, the Department makes it easier for manufacturers to use other, perhaps better,

tive for the use of such technologies, the standard providedthat a vehicle equipped with an airbag or other nonbelt system would count as 1.5 vehicles for the purpose of determin-ing compliance with the required 10, 25, or 40% minimum
passive restraint requirement during the phase-in period.49 CFR $ 571.208, S4.1.3.4(a)(1) (1998). With one oblique exception,5 there is no mention, either in the text of the finalstandard or in the accompanying comments, of the possibility
that the risk of potential tort liability would provide an in-centive for manufacturers to install airbags. Nor is there
any other specific evidence of an intent to preclude common-law tort actions.

II
Before discussing the pre-emption issue, it is appropriateto note that there is a vast difference between a rejection of

Honda's threshold arguments in favor of federal pre-emptionand a conclusion that petitioners ultimately would prevail
on their common-law tort claims. I express no opinion onthe possible merit, or lack of merit, of those claims. I do
observe, however, that even though good-faith compliancewith the minimum requirements of Standard 208 would not
provide Honda with a complete defense on the merits,6 I assystems such as airbags and passive interiors." 49 Fed. Reg. 29000
(1984).

5 In response to a comment that the manufacturers were likely to use

the cheapest system to comply with the new standard, the Secretary
stated that she believed "that competition, potential liability for any deficient systems[,] and pride in one's product would prevent this." Ibid.

6 Wood v. General Motors Corp., 865 F. 2d 395, 417 (CA1 1988) (collecting cases). The result would be different, of course, if petitioners had
brought common-law tort claims challenging Honda's compliance with a
mandatory minimum federal standard--e. g., claims that a 1999 Honda was
negligently and defectively designed because it was equipped with airbags
as required by the current version of Standard 208. Restatement (Third)

sume that such compliance would be admissible evidencetending to negate charges of negligent and defective design.

In addition, if Honda were ultimately found liable, such com-pliance would presumably weigh against an award of punitive damages. Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp., 485 F. Supp.566, 583-584 (WD Okla. 1979) (concluding that substantial
compliance with regulatory scheme did not bar award of pu-nitive damages, but noting that "[g]ood faith belief in, and
efforts to comply with, all government regulations would beevidence of conduct inconsistent with the mental state requisite for punitive damages" under state law).8The parties have not called our attention to any appellate
court opinions discussing the merits of similar no-airbagclaims despite the fact that airbag technology was available
for many years before the promulgation of the 1984 stand-ard--a standard that is not applicable to any automobiles
manufactured before September 1, 1986. Given that an ar-guable basis for a pre-emption defense did not exist until
that standard was promulgated, it is reasonable to infer thatthe manufacturers' assessment of their potential liability for
compensatory and punitive damages on such claims--even
cussing problem of basing state tort liability upon compliance with mandatory federal regulatory requirement as question of pre-emption rather
than of liability on the merits); Florida Lime & Avocado Growers, Inc. v.
Paul, 373 U. S. 132, 142-143 (1963) ("A holding of federal exclusion of state
law is inescapable and requires no inquiry into congressional design where
compliance with both federal [regulations and state tort law] is a physical impossibility . . .").

without any pre-emption defense--did not provide themwith a sufficient incentive to engage in widespread installation of airbags.Turning to the subject of pre-emption, Honda contends
that the Safety Act's pre-emption provision, 15 U. S. C.$ 1392(d), expressly pre-empts petitioners' common-law noairbag claims. It also argues that the claims are in any
event impliedly pre-empted because the imposition of liabil-ity in cases such as this would frustrate the purposes

of Standard 208. I discuss these alternative arguments inturn.

III
When a state statute, administrative rule, or common-law
cause of action conflicts with a federal statute, it is axiomaticthat the state law is without effect. U. S. Const., Art. VI,

cl. 2; Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U. S. 504, 516(1992). On the other hand, it is equally clear that the Supremacy Clause does not give unelected federal judges carte
blanche to use federal law as a means of imposing their own
ideas of tort reform on the States.9 Because of the role ofStates as separate sovereigns in our federal system, we have

long presumed that state laws--particularly those, such asthe provision of tort remedies to compensate for personal
injuries, that are within the scope of the States' historic police powers--are not to be pre-empted by a federal statuteunless it is the clear and manifest purpose of Congress to do

so. Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U. S. 470, 485 (1996); Gadev.

National Solid Wastes Management Assn., 505 U. S. 88,
116-117 (1992) (Souter, J., dissenting) ("If the [federal] stat-ute's terms can be read sensibly not to have a pre-emptive

effect, the presumption controls and no pre-emption may beinferred").

9 Regrettably, the Court has not always honored the latter proposition
as scrupulously as the former. See, e. g., Boyle v. United Technologies
Corp., 487 U. S. 500 (1988).

When a federal statute contains an express pre-emption
provision, "the task of statutory construction must in the
first instance focus on the plain wording of [that provision],
which necessarily contains the best evidence of Congress'
pre-emptive intent." CSX Transp., Inc. v. Easterwood, 507
U. S. 658, 664 (1993). The Safety Act contains both an express pre-emption provision, 15 U. S. C. $ 1392(d), and a
saving clause that expressly preserves common-law claims,

$ 1397(k). The relevant part of the former provides:

"Whenever a Federal motor vehicle safety standard established under this subchapter is in effect, no State or
political subdivision of a State shall have any authority
either to establish, or to continue in effect, with respect
to any motor vehicle or item of motor vehicle equipment[,] any safety standard applicable to the same aspect of performance of such vehicle or item of equipment
which is not identical to the Federal standard." 10

The latter states:

"Compliance with any Federal motor vehicle safety
standard issued under this subchapter does not exempt
any person from any liability under common law." 11

10 This provision is now codified at 49 U. S. C. $ 30103(b)(1). Because
both federal and state opinions construing this provision have consistently
referred to it as "$ 1392(d)," I shall follow that practice. Section 1392(d)
contains these additional sentences: "Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing any State from enforcing any safety standard which
is identical to a Federal safety standard. Nothing in this section shall be
construed to prevent the Federal Government or the government of any
State or political subdivision thereof from establishing a safety requirement applicable to motor vehicles or motor vehicle equipment procured
for its own use if such requirement imposes a higher standard of performance than that required to comply with the otherwise applicable Federal
standard."

Stevens, J., dissenting
Relying on $ 1392(d) and legislative history discussing Con-gress' desire for uniform national safety standards,

12 Honda

argues that petitioners' common-law no-airbag claims are ex-pressly pre-empted because success on those claims would

necessarily establish a state "safety standard" not identicalto Standard 208. It is perfectly clear, however, that the
term "safety standard" as used in these two sections refersto an objective rule prescribed by a legislature or an administrative agency and does not encompass case-specific deci-sions by judges and juries that resolve common-law claims.
That term is used three times in these sections; presumablyit is used consistently.

Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U. S.561, 570 (1995). The two references to a federal safety

standard are necessarily describing an objective administra-tive rule. 15 U. S. C. $ 1392(a). When the pre-emption provision refers to a safety standard established by a "State orpolitical subdivision of a State," therefore, it is most naturally read to convey a similar meaning. In addition, whenthe two sections are read together, they provide compelling
evidence of an intent to distinguish between legislative andadministrative rulemaking, on the one hand, and commonlaw liability, on the other. This distinction was certainly arational one for Congress to draw in the Safety Act given
that common-law liability--unlike most legislative or admin-istrative rulemaking--necessarily performs an important remedial role in compensating accident victims. Cf. Silkwoodv.

Kerr-McGee Corp., 464 U. S. 238, 251, 256 (1984).It is true that in three recent cases we concluded that

broadly phrased pre-emptive commands encompassedcommon-law claims. In Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc.,
while we thought it clear that the pre-emption provision inthe 1965 Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act

applied only to "rulemaking bodies," 505 U. S., at 518, weconcluded that the broad command in the subsequent 1969

amendment that "[n]o requirement or prohibition . . . shall
be imposed under State law" did include certain common-law
claims. Id., at 548-549 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
in part and dissenting in part).13 In CSX Transp., Inc. v.
Easterwood, where the pre-emption clause of the Federal
Railroad Safety Act of 1970 expressly provided that federal
railroad safety regulations would pre-empt any incompatible
state " `law, rule, regulation, order, or standard relating to
railroad safety,' " 14 we held that a federal regulation governing maximum train speed pre-empted a negligence claim that
a speed under the federal maximum was excessive. And in
Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, we recognized that the statutory
reference to "any requirement" imposed by a State or its
political subdivisions may include common-law duties. 518
U. S., at 502-503 (plurality opinion); id., at 503-505 (Breyer,
J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); id., at
509-512 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in
part).

The statutes construed in those cases differed from the
Safety Act in two significant respects. First, the language
in each of those pre-emption provisions was significantly
broader than the text of $ 1392(d). Unlike the broader language of those provisions, the ordinary meaning of the term
"safety standard" includes positive enactments, but does not
include judicial decisions in common-law tort cases.

Second, the statutes at issue in Cipollone, CSX, and Medtronic did not contain a saving clause expressly preserving
common-law remedies. The saving clause in the Safety Act

13 The full text of the 1969 provision read: " `No requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health shall be imposed under State law with
respect to the advertising or promotion of any cigarettes the packages of
which are labeled in conformity with the provisions of this Act.' " 505
U. S., at 515 (quoting Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969, 84

Stevens, J., dissenting
unambiguously expresses a decision by Congress that com-pliance with a federal safety standard does not exempt a

manufacturer from any common-law liability. In light ofthis reference to common-law liability in the saving clause,
Congress surely would have included a similar reference in$ 1392(d) if it had intended to pre-empt such liability. Chicago v. Environmental Defense Fund, 511 U. S. 328, 338(1994) (noting presumption that Congress acts intentionally
when it includes particular language in one section of a stat-ute but omits it in another).

The Court does not disagree with this interpretation of theterm "safety standard" in $ 1392(d). Because the meaning of
that term as used by Congress in this statute is clear, thetext of $ 1392(d) is itself sufficient to establish that the Safety
Act does not expressly pre-empt common-law claims. Inorder to avoid the conclusion that the saving clause is superfluous, therefore, it must follow that it has a different pur-pose: to limit, or possibly to foreclose entirely, the possible
pre-emptive effect of safety standards promulgated by theSecretary. The Court's approach to the case has the practical effect of reading the saving clause out of the statutealtogether.

15

Given the cumulative force of the fact that $ 1392(d) doesnot expressly pre-empt common-law claims and the fact that

$ 1397(k) was obviously intended to limit the pre-emptive ef-fect of the Secretary's safety standards, it is quite wrong for
the Court to assume that a possible implicit conflict with thepurposes to be achieved by such a standard should have the
same pre-emptive effect " `as an obstacle to the accomplish-ment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of
Congress.' " Ante, at 873. Properly construed, the SafetyAct imposes a special burden on a party relying on an arguable, implicit conflict with a temporary regulatory policy--

15 The Court surely cannot believe that Congress included that clause in
the statute just to avoid the danger that we would otherwise fail to give
the term "safety standard" its ordinary meaning.

rather than a conflict with congressional policy or with thetext of any regulation--to demonstrate that a common-law

claim has been pre-empted.

IV
Even though the Safety Act does not expressly pre-emptcommon-law claims, Honda contends that Standard 208--of

its own force--implicitly pre-empts the claims in this case.

"We have recognized that a federal statute implicitlyoverrides state law either when the scope of a statute

indicates that Congress intended federal law to occupya field exclusively, English v. General Elec. Co., 496 U. S.
72, 78-79 (1990), or when state law is in actual conflictwith federal law. We have found implied conflict preemption where it is `impossible for a private party tocomply with both state and federal requirements,'

id.,at 79, or where state law `stands as an obstacle to the

accomplishment and execution of the full purposes andobjectives of Congress.' Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S.
52, 67 (1941)." Freightliner Corp. v. Myrick, 514 U. S.280, 287 (1995).

In addition, we have concluded that regulations "intended topre-empt state law" that are promulgated by an agency acting nonarbitrarily and within its congressionally delegatedauthority may also have pre-emptive force. Fidelity Fed.
Sav. & Loan Assn. v. De la Cuesta, 458 U. S. 141, 153-154(1982). In this case, Honda relies on the last of the implied
pre-emption principles stated in Freightliner, arguing thatthe imposition of common-law liability for failure to install
an airbag would frustrate the purposes and objectives ofStandard 208.

Both the text of the statute and the text of the standardprovide persuasive reasons for rejecting this argument.
The saving clause of the Safety Act arguably denies the Sec-retary the authority to promulgate standards that would

pre-empt common-law remedies.16 Moreover, the text of
Standard 208 says nothing about pre-emption, and I am not
persuaded that Honda has overcome our traditional presumption that it lacks any implicit pre-emptive effect.

Honda argues, and the Court now agrees, that the risk of
liability presented by common-law claims that vehicles without airbags are negligently and defectively designed would
frustrate the policy decision that the Secretary made in
promulgating Standard 208. This decision, in their view,
was that safety--including a desire to encourage "public acceptance of the airbag technology and experimentation with
better passive restraint systems" 17--would best be promoted

16 The Court contends, in essence, that a saving clause cannot foreclose
implied conflict pre-emption. Ante, at 873-874. The cases it cites to
support that point, however, merely interpreted the language of the particular saving clauses at issue and concluded that those clauses did not
foreclose implied pre-emption; they do not establish that a saving clause
in a given statute cannot foreclose implied pre-emption based on frustration of that statute's purposes, or even (more importantly for our present
purposes) that a saving clause in a given statute cannot deprive a regulation issued pursuant to that statute of any implicit pre-emptive effect.
See United States v. Locke, ante, at 104-107; International Paper Co. v.
Ouellette, 479 U. S. 481, 493 (1987) ("Given that the Act itself does not
speak directly to the issue, the Court must be guided by the goals and
policies of the Act in determining whether it in fact pre-empts an action");
Chicago & North Western Transp. Co. v. Kalo Brick & Tile Co., 450 U. S.
311, 328, 331 (1981). As stated in the text, I believe the language of this
particular saving clause unquestionably limits, and possibly forecloses entirely, the pre-emptive effect that safety standards promulgated by the
Secretary have on common-law remedies. See Louisiana Pub. Serv.
Comm'n v. FCC, 476 U. S. 355, 374 (1986). Under that interpretation,
there is by definition no frustration of federal purposes--that is, no "tolerat[ion of] actual conflict," ante, at 874--when tort suits are allowed to go
forward. Thus, because there is a textual basis for concluding that Congress intended to preserve the state law at issue, I think it entirely appropriate for the party favoring pre-emption to bear a special burden in attempting to show that valid federal purposes would be frustrated if that
state law were not pre-empted.

through gradual implementation of a passive restraint re-quirement making airbags only one of a variety of systems

that a manufacturer could install in order to comply, ratherthan through a requirement mandating the use of one particular system in every vehicle. In its brief supporting Honda,the United States agreed with this submission. It argued
that if the manufacturers had known in 1984 that they might
later be held liable for failure to install airbags, that risk"would likely have led them to install airbags in all cars,"

thereby frustrating the Secretary's safety goals and interfer-ing with the methods designed to achieve them. Brief for
United States as Amicus Curiae 25.

There are at least three flaws in this argument that provide sufficient grounds for rejecting it. First, the entire argument is based on an unrealistic factual predicate. Whatever the risk of liability on a no-airbag claim may have been
prior to the promulgation of the 1984 version of Standard
208, that risk did not lead any manufacturer to install airbags
in even a substantial portion of its cars. If there had been
a realistic likelihood that the risk of tort liability would have
that consequence, there would have been no need for Standard 208. The promulgation of that standard certainly did
not increase the pre-existing risk of liability. Even if the
standard did not create a previously unavailable pre-emption
defense, it likely reduced the manufacturers' risk of liability
by enabling them to point to the regulation and their compliance therewith as evidence tending to negate charges of negligent and defective design. See Part II, supra. Given
that the pre-1984 risk of liability did not lead to widespread
airbag installation, this reduced risk of liability was hardly
likely to compel manufacturers to install airbags in all cars--
or even to compel them to comply with Standard 208 during
the phase-in period by installing airbags exclusively.

Second, even if the manufacturers' assessment of their risk
of liability ultimately proved to be wrong, the purposes of
Standard 208 would not be frustrated. In light of the inevi529US3 Unit: $U62 [09-26-01 12:54:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN

table time interval between the eventual filing of a tort ac-tion alleging that the failure to install an airbag is a design

defect and the possible resolution of such a claim against amanufacturer, as well as the additional interval between
such a resolution (if any) and manufacturers' "compliancewith the state-law duty in question," ante, at 882, by modifying their designs to avoid such liability in the future, it isobvious that the phase-in period would have ended long before its purposes could have been frustrated by the specterof tort liability. Thus, even without pre-emption, the public
would have been given the time that the Secretary deemednecessary to gradually adjust to the increasing use of airbag
technology and allay their unfounded concerns about it.Moreover, even if any no-airbag suits were ultimately resolved against manufacturers, the resulting incentive to
modify their designs would have been quite different from adecision by the Secretary to mandate the use of airbags in

every vehicle. For example, if the extra credit provided forthe use of nonbelt passive restraint technologies during the
phase-in period had (as the Secretary hoped) ultimately encouraged manufacturers to develop a nonbelt system moreeffective than the airbag, manufacturers held liable for failing to install passive restraints would have been free to re-spond by modifying their designs to include such a system
instead of an airbag.18 It seems clear, therefore, that any

18 The Court's failure to "understand [this point] correctly," ante, at 883,
is directly attributable to its fundamental misconception of the nature of
duties imposed by tort law. A general verdict of liability in a case seeking
damages for negligent and defective design of a vehicle that (like Ms.
Geier's) lacked any passive restraints does not amount to an immutable,
mandatory "rule of state tort law imposing . . . a duty [to install an airbag]." Ante, at 881; see also ante, at 871 (referring to verdict in commonlaw tort suit as a "jury-imposed safety standard"). Rather, that verdict
merely reflects the jury's judgment that the manufacturer of a vehicle
without any passive restraint system breached its duty of due care by
designing a product that was not reasonably safe because a reasonable
alternative design--"including, but not limited to, airbags," App. 3--could

potential tort liability would not frustrate the Secretary'sdesire to encourage both experimentation with better passive restraint systems and public acceptance of airbags.Third, despite its acknowledgment that the saving clause
"preserves those actions that seek to establish greater safetythan the minimum safety achieved by a federal regulation
intended to provide a floor," ante, at 870, the Court com-pletely ignores the important fact that by definition all of the
standards established under the Safety Act--like the Britishregulations that governed the number and capacity of lifeboats aboard the Titanic 19--impose minimum, rather thanfixed or maximum, requirements. 15 U. S. C. $ 1391(2); see
Norfolk Southern R. Co. v. Shanklin, ante, at 359 (Breyer,J., concurring) ("[F]ederal

minimum safety standards shouldnot pre-empt a state tort action"); Hillsborough County v.

Automated Medical Laboratories, Inc., 471 U. S. 707, 721(1985). The phase-in program authorized by Standard 208
thus set minimum percentage requirements for the installa-tion of passive restraints, increasing in annual stages of 10,
25, 40, and 100%. Those requirements were not ceilings,and it is obvious that the Secretary favored a more rapid
increase. The possibility that exposure to potential tort liahave reduced the foreseeable risks of harm posed by the product. See
Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability $ 2(b), and Comment d
(1997); id., $ 1, Comment a (noting that $ 2(b) is rooted in concepts of both
negligence and strict liability). Such a verdict obviously does not foreclose the possibility that more than one alternative design exists the use
of which would render the vehicle reasonably safe and satisfy the manufacturer's duty of due care. Thus, the Court is quite wrong to suggest that,
as a consequence of such a verdict, only the installation of airbags would
enable manufacturers to avoid liability in the future.

bility might accelerate the rate of increase would actuallyfurther the only goal explicitly mentioned in the standard

itself: reducing the number of deaths and severity of injuriesof vehicle occupants. Had gradualism been independently
important as a method of achieving the Secretary's safetygoals, presumably the Secretary would have put a ceiling as
well as a floor on each annual increase in the required per-centage of new passive restraint installations. For similar
reasons, it is evident that variety was not a matter of inde-pendent importance to the Secretary. Although the standard allowed manufacturers to comply with the minimum per-centage requirements by installing passive restraint systems
other than airbags (such as automatic seatbelts), it encour-aged them to install airbags and other nonbelt systems that
might be developed in the future. The Secretary did not actto ensure the use of a variety of passive restraints by placing
ceilings on the number of airbags that could be used in com-plying with the minimum requirements.

20 Moreover, even

if variety and gradualism had been independently importantto the Secretary, there is nothing in the standard, the accompanying commentary, or the history of airbag regulation tosupport the notion that the Secretary intended to advance
those purposes at all costs, without regard to the detrimen-tal consequences that pre-emption of tort liability could have
for the achievement of her avowed purpose of reducing ve-hicular injuries. See Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp., 464
U. S., at 257.My disagreement with Honda and the Government runs
deeper than these flaws, however. In its brief, the Govern-ment concedes that "[a] claim that a manufacturer should

21 Petitioners' claims

here are quite similar to the claim described by the Govern-ment: their complaint discusses other design features particular to the 1987 Accord (such as the driver's seat) that alleg-edly rendered it unreasonably dangerous to operate without
an airbag. App. 4-5. The only distinction is that in thiscase, the particular 1987 Accord driven by Ms. Geier included
no passive restraint of any kind because Honda chose to com-ply with Standard 208's 10% minimum requirement by installing passive restraints in other 1987 models. I fail to seehow this distinction makes a difference to the purposes of
Standard 208, however. If anything, the type of claim fa-vored by the Government--

e. g., that a particular model ofcar should have contained an airbag instead of an automatic

seatbelt--would seem to trench even more severely upon thepurposes that the Government and Honda contend were behind the promulgation of Standard 208: that having a varietyof passive restraints, rather than only airbags, was necessary
to promote safety. Thus, I conclude that the Government,on the Secretary's behalf, has failed to articulate a coherent
view of the policies behind Standard 208 that would be frus-trated by petitioners' claims.

pre-emption of state laws that allegedly frustrate federalpurposes: it has not demonstrated that allowing a commonlaw no-airbag claim to go forward would impose an obligationon manufacturers that directly and irreconcilably contradicts
any primary objective that the Secretary set forth with clar-ity in Standard 208.

Gade v. National Solid Wastes Management Assn., 505 U. S., at 110 (Kennedy, J., concurring in
part and concurring in judgment); id., at 111 ("A freewheel-ing judicial inquiry into whether [state law] is in tension with

federal objectives would undercut the principle that it isCongress [and federal agencies,] rather than the courts[,]
that pre-emp[t] state law"). Furthermore, it is important to
note that the text of Standard 208 (which the Court does not
even bother to quote in its opinion), unlike the regulation we
reviewed in Fidelity Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. De la Cuesta,
458 U. S., at 158, does not contain any expression of an intent
to displace state law. Given our repeated emphasis on the
importance of the presumption against pre-emption, see,
e. g., CSX Transp., Inc. v. Easterwood, 507 U. S., at 663-664;
Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U. S. 218, 230 (1947),
this silence lends additional support to the conclusion that
the continuation of whatever common-law liability may exist
in a case like this poses no danger of frustrating any of the
Secretary's primary purposes in promulgating Standard 208.
See Hillsborough County v. Automated Medical Laboratories, Inc., 471 U. S., at 721; Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp.,
464 U. S., at 251 ("It is difficult to believe that [the Secretary]
would, without comment, remove all means of judicial recourse for those injured by illegal conduct").

The Court apparently views the question of pre-emption
in this case as a close one. Ante, at 883 (relying on Secretary's interpretation of Standard 208's objectives to bolster

its finding of pre-emption). Under "ordinary experienceproved principles of conflict pre-emption," ante, at 874,
therefore, the presumption against pre-emption should control. Instead, the Court simply ignores the presumption,

preferring instead to put the burden on petitioners to showthat their tort claim would not frustrate the Secretary's purposes. Ante, at 882 (noting that petitioners' arguments"cannot, by themselves, change the legal result"). In view
of the important principles upon which the presumption isfounded, however, rejecting it in this manner is profoundly
unwise.

Our presumption against pre-emption is rooted in theconcept of federalism. It recognizes that when Congress

legislates "in a field which the States have traditionallyoccupied . . . [,] we start with the assumption that the historic
police powers of the States were not to be superseded by the
Federal Act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose
of Congress." Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U. S.,
at 230; see Jones v. Rath Packing Co., 430 U. S. 519, 525
(1977). The signal virtues of this presumption are its placement of the power of pre-emption squarely in the hands of
Congress, which is far more suited than the Judiciary to
strike the appropriate state/federal balance (particularly in
areas of traditional state regulation), and its requirement
that Congress speak clearly when exercising that power. In
this way, the structural safeguards inherent in the normal
operation of the legislative process operate to defend state
interests from undue infringement. Garcia v. San Antonio
Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528, 552 (1985);
see United States v. Morrison, ante, at 660-663 (Breyer, J.,
dissenting); Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 528 U. S. 62,
93-94 (2000) (Stevens, J., dissenting); Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson, 513 U. S. 265, 292-293 (1995) (Thomas,
J., dissenting); Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 460-464
(1991). In addition, the presumption serves as a limiting
principle that prevents federal judges from running amok
with our potentially boundless (and perhaps inadequately
considered) doctrine of implied conflict pre-emption based on
frustration of purposes--i. e., that state law is pre-empted if
it "stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execu529US3 Unit: $U62 [09-26-01 12:54:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN

While the presumption is important in assessing the pre-emptive reach of federal statutes, it becomes crucial when

the pre-emptive effect of an administrative regulation is atissue. Unlike Congress, administrative agencies are clearly
not designed to represent the interests of States, yet withrelative ease they can promulgate comprehensive and detailed regulations that have broad pre-emption ramificationsfor state law. We have addressed the heightened federalism
and nondelegation concerns that agency pre-emption raisesby using the presumption to build a procedural bridge across
the political accountability gap between States and adminis-trative agencies. Thus, even in cases where implied regulatory pre-emption is at issue, we generally "expect an admin-istrative regulation to declare any intention to pre-empt
state law with some specificity. " 23 Cali fornia Coastal

22 Recently, one commentator has argued that our doctrine of
frustration-of-purposes (or "obstacle") pre-emption is not supported by the
text or history of the Supremacy Clause, and has suggested that we attempt to bring a measure of rationality to our pre-emption jurisprudence
by eliminating it. Nelson, Preemption, 86 Va. L. Rev. 225, 231-232 (2000)
("Under the Supremacy Clause, preemption occurs if and only if state law
contradicts a valid rule established by federal law, and the mere fact that
the federal law serves certain purposes does not automatically mean that
it contradicts everything that might get in the way of those purposes").
Obviously, if we were to do so, there would be much less need for the
presumption against pre-emption (which the commentator also criticizes).
As matters now stand, however, the presumption reduces the risk that
federal judges will draw too deeply on malleable and politically unaccountable sources such as regulatory history in finding pre-emption based on
frustration of purposes.

23 The Court brushes aside our specificity requirement on the ground

that the cases in which we relied upon it were not cases of implied conflict
pre-emption. Ante, at 884. The Court is quite correct that Hillsborough
County v. Automated Medical Laboratories, Inc., 471 U. S. 707 (1985),
and California Coastal Comm'n v. Granite Rock Co., 480 U. S. 572 (1987),
are cases in which field pre-emption, rather than conflict pre-emption, was

Inc., 471 U. S., at 717-718 (noting that too easily implyingpre-emption "would be inconsistent with the federal-state
balance embodied in our Supremacy Clause jurisprudence,"and stating that "because agencies normally address problems in a detailed manner and can speak through a varietyof means, including regulations, preambles, interpretive
statements, and responses to comments, we can expect thatthey will make their intentions clear if they intend for their
regulations to be exclusive"); Fidelity Fed. Sav. & Loan
Assn. v. De la Cuesta, 458 U. S., at 154 (noting that pre-emption inquiry is initiated "[w]hen the administrator promulgates regulations intended to pre-empt state law").This expectation, which is shared by the Executive Branch,

24

serves to ensure that States will be able to have a dialog

would like. Our cases firmly establish that conflict and field pre-emption
are alike in that both are instances of implied pre-emption that by definition do "not [turn] on an express statement of pre-emptive intent." Ante,
at 884; see, e. g., Freightliner Corp. v. Myrick, 514 U. S. 280, 287 (1995)
(quoted supra, at 899); English v. General Elec. Co., 496 U. S. 72, 79-80,
and n. 5 (1990) (noting that field pre-emption rests on an inference of
congressional intent to exclude state regulation and that it "may be understood as a species of conflict pre-emption"); Fidelity Fed. Sav. &
Loan Assn. v. De la Cuesta, 458 U. S. 141, 153 (1982). Given that our
specificity requirement was adopted in cases involving implied preemption, the Court cannot persuasively claim that the requirement is incompatible with our implied pre-emption jurisprudence in the federal regulatory context.

with agencies regarding pre-emption decisions ex antethrough the normal notice-and-comment procedures of the

Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U. S. C. $ 553.When the presumption and its underpinnings are properly
understood, it is plain that Honda has not overcome the pre-sumption in this case. Neither Standard 208 nor its accompanying commentary includes the slightest specific indication
of an intent to pre-empt common-law no-airbag suits. In-deed, the only mention of such suits in the commentary tends

to suggest that they would not be pre-empted. See n. 5,
supra. In the Court's view, however, "[t]he failure of the
Federal Register to address pre-emption explicitly is . . . not
determinative," ante, at 884, because the Secretary's consistent litigating position since 1989, the history of airbag regulation, and the commentary accompanying the final version
of Standard 208 reveal purposes and objectives of the Secretary that would be frustrated by no-airbag suits. Preempting on these three bases blatantly contradicts the presumption against pre-emption. When the 1984 version of
Standard 208 was under consideration, the States obviously
were not afforded any notice that purposes might someday
be discerned in the history of airbag regulation that would
support pre-emption. Nor does the Court claim that the notice of proposed rulemaking that led to Standard 208 provided the States with notice either that the final version of
the standard might contain an express pre-emption provision
or that the commentary accompanying it might contain a
statement of purposes with arguable pre-emptive effect.
Finally, the States plainly had no opportunity to comment
upon either the commentary accompanying the final version
of the standard or the Secretary's ex post litigating position
that the standard had implicit pre-emptive effect.

Furthermore, the Court identifies no case in which we
have upheld a regulatory claim of frustration-of-purposes implied conflict pre-emption based on nothing more than an
ex post administrative litigating position and inferences from

regulatory history and final commentary. The latter twosources are even more malleable than legislative history.

Thus, when snippets from them are combined with theCourt's broad conception of a doctrine of frustration-ofpurposes pre-emption untempered by the presumption, avast, undefined area of state law becomes vulnerable to preemption by any related federal law or regulation. In myview, however, "preemption analysis is, or at least should
be, a matter of precise statutory [or regulatory] constructionrather than an exercise in free-form judicial policymaking."
1 L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law $ 6-28, p. 1177 (3ded. 2000).

As to the Secretary's litigating position, it is clear that "aninterpretation contained in a [legal brief], not one arrived
at after, for example, a formal adjudication or notice-and-comment rulemaking[,] . . . do[es] not warrant

Chevron-styledeference." Christensen v. Harris County, ante, at 587.

Moreover, our pre-emption precedents and the APA estab-lish that even if the Secretary's litigating position were coherent, the lesser deference paid to it by the Court todaywould be inappropriate. Given the Secretary's contention
that he has the authority to promulgate safety standardsthat pre-empt state law and the fact that he could promulgate a standard such as the one quoted supra, at 887, withrelative ease, we should be quite reluctant to find preemption based only on the Secretary's informal effort to re-cast the 1984 version of Standard 208 into a pre-emptive
mold.25 See Hillsborough County v. Automated Medical

Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Kennedy and JusticeThomas join, dissenting.

Petitioners Claude and Micheline Lambert own the CornellHotel in San Francisco. The hotel has 24 residential units and
34 tourist units. After experiencing difficulty renting the hotel'sresidential units, petitioners applied to the San Francisco Planning Commission for a conditional use permit to convert thoseunits to tourist use.* That request implicated two bodies of San
Francisco's land-use law: the Planning Code and the ResidentialHotel Unit Conversion and Demolition Ordinance (HCO). The
Planning Code provides that a tourist hotel may not be "signifi-cantly altered, enlarged, or intensified, except upon approval of a
new conditional use application." S. F. Planning Code, Art. 1.7,$ 178(c) (2000). The HCO prohibits the issuance of a permit for
the conversion of units from residential to tourist use unless theproprietor agrees to provide either one-to-one replacement for
those units or to pay a portion of the replacement costs. SeeS. F. Admin. Code, ch. 41, $ 41.13 (2000).

*When petitioners first sought to convert their residential units to touristuse, the hotel contained 31 residential units. Petitioners were successful,
however, in convincing the San Francisco Board of Permit Appeals to reclas-sify seven of those as tourist units, producing the hotel's configuration noted
in the text.

dissenting 529 U. S.
Pursuant to the HCO, the city obtained two appraisals of thereplacement costs for the units petitioners wished to convert.
See 67 Cal. Rptr. 2d 562, 570 (1997) (Strankman, P. J., dissenting).The first appraisal was $488,584 and the second was $612,887; the
city settled on $600,000. See ibid. Petitioners, however, offeredonly $100,000. See ibid. After the Planning Commission denied
the permit application, petitioners brought the present suit.They contended that the replacement fee is unconstitutional under
this Court's decisions in Nollan v. California Coastal Comm'n,483 U. S. 825 (1987), and Dolan v. City of Tigard, 512 U. S. 374
(1994), which held that a burden imposed as a condition of permitapproval must be related to the public harm that would justify
denying the permit, and must be roughly proportional to what isneeded to eliminate that harm. The California Court of Appeal
affirmed the trial court's rejection of petitioners' claim. It heldthat the HCO played no part in the commission's decision, and
therefore "San Francisco did not demand anything from [petition-ers] as a condition of a use permit." 67 Cal. Rptr. 2d, at 569.
Instead, the court maintained, the commission relied solely on thePlanning Code and, basing its decision upon such traditional zoning concerns as compatibility with surrounding development, ef-fect on traffic patterns, and availability of housing stock, "simply
denied the permit outright." Ibid. Because, the court contin-ued, "neither a property right nor money was in fact taken from
[petitioners], there [was] no reason to determine if a taking wouldhave occurred had [petitioners] been required to pay $600,000 as
a condition of a use permit, and thus there [was] nothing requiringreview under" Nollan and Dolan. 67 Cal. Rptr. 2d, at 569.

The record belies the Court of Appeal's claim that the commis-sion ignored petitioners' refusal to meet its demand for a $600,000
payment. After acknowledging petitioners' offer of $100,000, thecommission compared this figure with the amounts offered by two
other hotels that had successfully requested similar conversions.1 Appellants' App. in No. A076116 (Cal. Ct. App.), pp. 100, 102.
It noted that in those two applications, the fee amounted to$10,000 and $15,000 per room, respectively. See id., at 102. (The
fee in petitioners' case, by contrast, amounted to only $3,226 perroom. See 67 Cal. Rptr. 2d, at 571.) The commission then found
that petitioners' application was "not comparable to those pre-viously granted . . . ," because petitioners "failed to demonstrate
that the amount offered" was "sufficient to mitigate the loss of

dissenting1045
housing stock." 1 Appellants' App., at 102. It is simply andobviously not true that the commission ignored petitioners' refusal to satisfy its fee demand.The Court of Appeal itself, after asserting that "San Francisco
did not demand anything" from petitioners, 67 Cal. Rptr. 2d, at569, in the next breath found it "somewhat disturbing that San
Francisco's concerns about congestion, parking and preservationof a neighborhood might have been overcome by payment of [a]
significant sum of money," ibid. (emphasis added). This observa-tion makes no sense, of course, unless the court concluded from
the record that the commission might have rendered a differentdecision if petitioners had been more generous. It sought to
evade the natural consequence of that conclusion with the follow-ing unelaborated assertion: "That the Planning Commission might
have granted the permit upon payment of $600,000 does not makeits refusal to issue the permit into a taking." Ibid. (emphasis
added).There are three possible readings of the Court of Appeal's opinion. First, and most obviously, one might take at face value thecourt's factual finding that the fee played no role in the decision.
That would be a gross distortion of the record.Secondly, one might ignore the court's initial see-no-evil disclaimer, and assume that it accepted what the record undeniablyshowed, that petitioners' refusal to meet the fee demand was a
motivating force behind the commission's decision. On that as-sumption, the court's refusal to apply Nollan and Dolan might
be thought to rest upon its determination that that factor wasirrelevant, since the commission also relied upon ordinary criteria
under the Planning Code. But it is always the case that if thepermit applicant does not yield to the extortionate demand, the
ordinary criteria will be invoked to deny his permit. If indeedunjustified denial can constitute a taking (the question presented
by the third basis for the decision, discussed below), Nollan andDolan can surely not be evaded by simply adding boilerplate
"ordinary criteria" language to the denial. The increasing com-plexity of land-use permitting processes, and of the criteria by
which permit applications are judged, makes an "ordinary crite-ria" claim almost always plausible. When there is uncontested
evidence of a demand for money or other property--and still as-suming that denial of a permit because of failure to meet such a
demand constitutes a taking--it should be up to the permitting

dissenting 529 U. S.
authority to establish either (1) that the demand met the require-ments of Nollan and Dolan, or (2) that denial would have ensued
even if the demand had been met. Cf. Mt. Healthy City Bd. ofEd. v. Doyle, 429 U. S. 274 (1977). The record (and the Court of
Appeal's opinion) make clear that the latter cannot be estab-lished here.

Finally, and still on the assumption that the Court of Appealacknowledged that petitioners' failure to accede to the fee demand
was a motivating factor in the commission's denial, the court'srefusal to apply Nollan and Dolan might rest upon the distinction
that it drew between the grant of a permit subject to an unlawfulcondition and the denial of a permit when an unlawful condition is
not met. See Cal. Rptr. 2d, at 569 (Strankman, P. J., dissenting)(characterizing the majority's opinion in this fashion). From one
standpoint, of course, such a distinction makes no sense. Theobject of the Court's holding in Nollan and Dolan was to protect
against the State's cloaking within the permit process " `an out-and-out plan of extortion,' " Nollan, 483 U. S., at 837 (quoting
J. E. D. Associates, Inc. v. Atkinson, 121 N. H. 581, 584, 432 A. 2d12, 14-15 (1981)). There is no apparent reason why the phrasing
of an extortionate demand as a condition precedent rather thanas a condition subsequent should make a difference. It is undeniable, on the other hand, that the subject of any supposed takingin the present case is far from clear. Whereas in Nollan there
was arguably a completed taking of an easement (the homeownerhad completed construction that had been conditioned upon conveyance of the easement), and in Dolan there was at least athreatened taking of an easement (if the landowner had gone
ahead with her contemplated expansion plans the easement wouldhave attached), in the present case there is neither a taking nor
a threatened taking of any money. If petitioners go ahead withthe conversion of their apartments, the city will not sue for
$600,000 imposed as a condition of the conversion; it will sue toenjoin and punish a conversion that has been prohibited.

The first two of the conceivable bases for the Court of Appeal'sdecision are so implausible as to call into question the state court's
willingness to hold state administrators to the Fifth Amendmentstandards set forth by this tribunal. There is reason to believe
that this may be more than a local and isolated phenomenon.See, e. g., Delaney, Development Agreements: The Road from Prohibition to "Let's Make a Deal!" 25 Urb. Law. 49, 52 (1993) ("In

addition to anti-development attitudes and vesting problems,property owners and developers are confronting decisions of state
courts which either ignore or do not follow the `essential nexus'standard set forth in

Nollan v. California Coastal Comm'n tovalidate development exactions" (footnote omitted)); M. Berger,

Recent Developments in the Law of Inverse Condemnation, Q203ALI-ABA Video Law Review Study 1, 4 (1991) ("Last year, we

California Coastal Comm'n (1987) 483 U. S. 825 by seekingways to evade their evident mandate, either procedurally or substantively"). Were they the only arguable bases for the decisionI would favor summary reversal, and remand for conduct of the
Nollan-Dolan analysis. The third basis, however, is at least aplausible one, and raises a question that will doubtless be presented in many cases. Though I am unaware of a conflict ofauthority on the precise point, the other grounds upon which the
court relied entitle this case to our attention, and should overcome
our usual preference for cases that present actual conflicts. I
would therefore grant certiorari and schedule the case forargument.

Justice Thomas, dissenting.
"Any system of prior restraints of expression comes to thisCourt bearing a heavy presumption against its constitutional validity." Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan, 372 U. S. 58, 70 (1963).The presumption is by no means rebutted here. For one, the
unprecedented injunction entered by the courts below, which barspetitioner John Lawrence from uttering in the workplace any of
a judicially drawn list of words deemed offensive to Latino em-ployees, very likely suppresses fully protected speech. But even
if some types of harassing speech in the workplace do not enjoyFirst Amendment protection, there has been no showing that a
prior restraint, rather than the less severe remedy of money dam-ages for any future violations, is necessary to regulate Lawrence's
speech. Further, the injunction here is not narrowly tailored, asit applies even to isolated remarks and to remarks outside the
hearing of respondents or any Latino employee. For these rea-sons, I respectfully dissent from the Court's denial of certiorari.

Respondents, who are Latinos, were employed as drivers atpetitioner Avis Rent A Car System, Inc.'s San Francisco airport

facility. According to the complaint, Lawrence, another employeeof the facility, routinely harassed only the Latino drivers, calling
them derogatory names and demeaning them on the basis of theirrace, national origin, and lack of English language skills. Lawrence also appears to have engaged in uninvited touching of theLatino drivers. Respondents filed suit against Lawrence and
Avis in California court under that State's Fair Employment andHousing Act (FEHA), which makes it unlawful "[f]or an
employer . . . or any other person, because of race . . . [or] nationalorigin . . . to harass an employee or applicant." Cal. Govt. Code
Ann. $ 12940(h) (West 1992). A jury returned special verdictsin favor of respondents, finding that Lawrence had engaged in
harassment and that Avis knew or should have known of Law-rence's conduct. Respondents were each awarded $25,000 in
damages, except for one who was found by the jury not to havesuffered emotional distress.

The trial court then considered respondents' request for in-junctive relief. Over the objection of petitioners that there was
no evidence of ongoing harm such as would justify an injunction(Lawrence had not harassed anyone at work for two years),
the trial court granted the requested injunction. Specifically,it ordered:

"1. Defendant John Lawrence shall cease and desist fromusing any derogatory racial or ethnic epithets directed at, or
descriptive of, Hispanic/Latino employees of Avis Rent A CarSystem, Inc., and shall further refrain from any uninvited
intentional touching of said Hispanic/Latino employees, aslong as he is employed by Avis Rent A Car System, Inc.
in California."2. Defendant Avis Rent A Car System, Inc. shall cease
and desist from allowing defendant John Lawrence to commitany of the acts described in paragraph 1 above, under circumstances in which it knew or should have known of suchacts . . . ." App. to Pet. for Cert. C2.

Lawrence and Avis appealed from the injunction portion of thejudgment, claiming it is impermissibly overbroad and vague. The
Court of Appeal agreed to an extent, holding that the injunction

must be restricted to Lawrence's speech in the workplace andarticulated in the form of an exemplary list of forbidden words,
but upheld the injunction in all other respects.A divided California Supreme Court affirmed. 21 Cal. 4th 121
(1999). The plurality opinion, at the outset, declined to entertainpetitioners' contention that the First Amendment prohibits application of employment discrimination laws to the sort of harassingspeech that creates a "hostile environment," deeming the argument waived by petitioners' decision not to challenge the juryfindings of liability and damages for their past conduct. Id., at
131, n. 3, 136-137, n. 5. The plurality then turned to the propri-ety of the injunctive remedy, accepting at face value the trial
court's finding of a " `substantial likelihood' " that Lawrence wouldharass again unless restrained. Id., at 132. The plurality rejected petitioners' First Amendment objection, holding that theinjunction is not an invalid prior restraint "because the order was
issued only after the jury determined that defendants had en-gaged in employment discrimination, and the order simply precluded defendants from continuing their unlawful activity." Id.,at 138. A concurring opinion addressed the threshold question
deemed waived by the plurality, concluding that, while FEHA'srestrictions are content based when applied to pure speech, the
First Amendment does not prohibit such application of FEHA.Id., at 164, 166 (opinion of Werdegar, J.). Justices Mosk, Kennard,
and Brown each filed dissenting opinions. See id., at 169 (opinionof Mosk, J.); id., at 176 (opinion of Kennard, J.); id., at 189 (opinion
of Brown, J.). II

I would grant certiorari to address the troubling First Amend-ment issues raised by this injunction. Attaching liability to the
utterance of words in the workplace is likely invalid for the simplereason that this speech is fully protected speech.

1 No one claims

1 Like the concurring and dissenting justices below, I do not consider this
argument waived by virtue of petitioners' decision not to appeal the moneydamages portion of the judgment. A First Amendment objection is, as a

matter of logic, available against the money damages portion, the injunctionportion, or both. Petitioners may well have thought their First Amendment
claim weaker with respect to the money damages portion because Law-rence's past conduct consisted of speech and conduct (whereas the injunction
prohibits pure speech independent of any conduct), cf. NLRB v. VirginiaElec. & Power Co., 314 U. S. 469, 478 (1941), and because prior restraints

Thomas, J., dissenting1138
that the words on the "exemplary list" (to be drafted by the trialcourt on remand) qualify as fighting words, see Chaplinsky v.
New Hampshire, 315 U. S. 568, 572 (1942), obscenity, see Millerv. California, 413 U. S. 15, 24 (1973), or some other category of
speech currently recognized as outside the scope of First Amend-ment protection. Even if these words do constitute so-called
"low-value speech," the content-based nature of FEHA's restric-tion--which bars speech based upon "race, religious creed, color,
national origin, ancestry, physical disability, mental disability,medical condition, marital status, sex, age, or sexual orientation,"
Cal. Govt. Code Ann. $ 12940(h)(1) (West Supp. 2000) but notbecause of political affiliation, union membership, or numerous
other traits--renders it invalid under our current jurisprudence.R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377, 391 (1992).

To uphold the application of a content-based antidiscriminationlaw such as FEHA to pure speech in the workplace, then, we
would have to substantially modify our First Amendment juris-prudence. This is not to say that there are no doctrinal bases
for such a modification. As the concurring opinion below pointedout, for example, we have held that public employers retain some
leeway to regulate their employees' speech in the workplace, see21 Cal. 4th, at 156 (Werdegar, J., concurring) (citing Connick v.
Myers, 461 U. S. 138 (1983)), and have occasionally stated thatspeech may be more readily restricted when the audience is "captive" and cannot avoid the objectionable speech, see 21 Cal. 4th,at 159 (Werdegar, J., concurring) (citing Frisby v. Schultz, 487
U. S. 474 (1988)). On the other hand, these analogies may notquite translate to the instant problem. See, e. g., 21 Cal. 4th,
at 184-185 (Kennard, J., dissenting) (discussing captive audiencedoctrine); Volokh, Freedom of Speech and Workplace Harassment,
39 UCLA L. Rev. 1791, 1821 (1992) (arguing that this Court'scases on speech in the workplace do not support a "workplace
speech exception" broad enough to justify harassment law). Inlight of the difficulty of these issues, it is not surprising that even
those commentators who conclude the First Amendment generallypermits application of harassment laws to workplace speech recognize exceptions where First Amendment interests are especiallystrong. See, e. g., Fallon, Sexual Harassment, Content Neutrality,

are especially suspect under the First Amendment, see, e. g., SoutheasternPromotions, Ltd. v. Conrad, 420 U. S. 546, 558-559 (1975).

and the First Amendment Dog that Didn't Bark, 1994 S. Ct. Rev.1, 41, 47 (exception for speech that is reasonably designed or
intended to contribute to reasoned debate on issues of publicconcern).

But even assuming that some pure speech in the workplacemay be proscribed consistent with the First Amendment when it
violates a workplace harassment law, special First Amendmentproblems are presented when, as here, the proscription takes the
form of a prior restraint. We have, since Near v. Minnesota exrel. Olson, 283 U. S. 697 (1931), evaluated injunctions against
speech as prior restraints, which entails the strictest scrutinyknown to our First Amendment jurisprudence. As we have
explained:

"The presumption against prior restraints is heavier--andthe degree of protection broader--than that against limits on

expression imposed by criminal penalties. Behind the dis-tinction is a theory deeply etched in our law: a free society
prefers to punish the few who abuse rights of speech afterthey break the law than to throttle them and all others beforehand. It is always difficult to know in advance whatan individual will say, and the line between legitimate and
illegitimate speech is often so finely drawn that the risks offreewheeling censorship are formidable." Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad, 420 U. S. 546, 558-559 (1975).
The instant injunction is insufficiently tailored in at least threerespects, raising serious doubts concerning whether "the challenged provisions of the injunction burden no more speech thannecessary to serve a significant government interest." Madsen
v. Women's Health Center, Inc., 512 U. S. 753, 765 (1994).2First, the injunction prohibits even a single utterance of a prohibited word. Yet a hostile environment for purposes of FEHAonly arises "[w]hen the workplace is permeated with discrimina2 Although a content-neutral injunction is not treated as a prior restraint,
see Schenck v. Pro-Choice Network of Western N. Y., 519 U. S. 357, 372(1997); Madsen, 512 U. S., at 763-764, n. 2, the instant injunction is indisputably content based. See 21 Cal. 4th 121, 164 (1999) (Werdegar, J., concur-ring); id., at 172 (Mosk, J., dissenting). I apply the Madsen standard here
because, if the injunction fails the Madsen standard for content-neutralinjunctions, a fortiori it fails whatever standard applies to content-based
injunctions.

tory intimidation, ridicule, and insult, that is sufficiently severeor pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim's employment
and create an abusive working environment." Harris v. ForkliftSystems, Inc., 510 U. S. 17, 21 (1993) (internal quotation marks
and citation omitted); see 21 Cal. 4th, at 130 (plurality opinion)("California courts have adopted the [Harris] standard in evaluating claims under the FEHA"). It simply cannot be known inadvance whether a particular utterance will create (or recreate)
a hostile environment under this standard, and speculation simplydoes not suffice to rebut the heavy presumption against a prior
restraint. See Southeastern Promotions, supra, at 561; NewYork Times Co. v. United States, 403 U. S. 713, 725-726 (1971)
(Brennan, J., concurring) ("[T]he First Amendment tolerates abso-lutely no prior judicial restraints of the press predicated upon
surmise or conjecture that untoward consequences may result").The alternative remedy of a money damages judgment for future
violations would solve the problem. Second, there has been noshowing that the prospect of a money damages judgment for
future violations would fall short of deterring petitioners fromrecreating a hostile environment, especially when a second money
damages judgment might include hefty punitive damages andattorney's fees. See 21 Cal. 4th, at 194 (Brown, J., dissenting).
Indeed, it appears from the transcript of the injunction hearingheld in 1994 that Lawrence had not engaged in any harassing
speech or conduct since 1992. See App. to Brief in OppositionA9. Third, the prohibition applies without regard to whether the
utterance is directed at, or within earshot of, respondents (or, forthat matter, any Latino employee), and contains no exception for
speech that might contribute to reasoned debate.My colleagues are perhaps dissuaded from granting certiorari
by the paucity of lower court decisions addressing the FirstAmendment implications of workplace harassment law, and by the
incomplete factual record in this case. Neither is a persuasivereason to deny certiorari. First, we must remember that we deal
here with a claim at the core of the First Amendment--that theState is suppressing speech that it dislikes. For the same reason
that we evaluate prior restraints under a heavy presumptionagainst their validity (the harm from delay), we should decide the
issue now. And the thorough treatment of the issues by theseveral opinions below makes it especially unnecessary to await
a split in the lower courts. Second, while it is true that the

its grant of injunctive relief, the record does plainly indicate thescope of the injunction and the conclusory nature of the trial
court's findings as to the need for an injunction. Though therecord may disable us from resolving here and now every detail
of the interaction between the First Amendment and workplaceharassment law, an incremental approach to this area would seem
wise in any event. I respectfully dissent.

Rule 5003. Records kept by the clerk.. . . . .

(e) Register of mailing addresses of federal and state gov-ernmental units.--The United States or the state or territory in which the court is located may file a statement desig-nating its mailing address. The clerk shall keep, in the form
and manner as the Director of the Administrative Office ofthe United States Courts may prescribe, a register that includes these mailing addresses, but the clerk is not requiredto include in the register more than one mailing address for
each department, agency, or instrumentality of the UnitedStates or the state or territory. If more than one address
for a department, agency, or instrumentality is included inthe register, the clerk shall also include information that
would enable a user of the register to determine the circum-stances when each address is applicable, and mailing notice
to only one applicable address is sufficient to provide effec-tive notice. The clerk shall update the register annually, effective January 2 of each year. The mailing address in theregister is conclusively presumed to be a proper address for
the governmental unit, but the failure to use that mailingaddress does not invalidate any notice that is otherwise effective under applicable law.(

f ) Other books and records of the clerk.--The clerk shallkeep any other books and records required by the Director

of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts.

Rule 14. Third-party practice.

(a) When defendant may bring in third party.--At any
time after commencement of the action a defending party, as
a third-party plaintiff, may cause a summons and complaint
to be served upon a person not a party to the action who is
or may be liable to the third-party plaintiff for all or part of
the plaintiff 's claim against the third-party plaintiff. The
third-party plaintiff need not obtain leave to make the service if the third-party plaintiff files the third-party complaint
not later than 10 days after serving the original answer.
Otherwise the third-party plaintiff must obtain leave on motion upon notice to all parties to the action. The person
served with the summons and third-party complaint, hereinafter called the third-party defendant, shall make any defenses to the third-party plaintiff 's claim as provided in Rule
12 and any counterclaims against the third-party plaintiff
and cross-claims against other third-party defendants as provided in Rule 13. The third-party defendant may assert
against the plaintiff any defenses which the third-party
plaintiff has to the plaintiff 's claim. The third-party defendant may also assert any claim against the plaintiff arising out
of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of
the plaintiff 's claim against the third-party plaintiff. The
plaintiff may assert any claim against the third-party defendant arising out of the transaction or occurrence that is the
subject matter of the plaintiff 's claim against the third-party
plaintiff, and the third-party defendant thereupon shall assert any defenses as provided in Rule 12 and any counterclaims and cross-claims as provided in Rule 13. Any party
may move to strike the third-party claim, or for its severance
or separate trial. A third-party defendant may proceed
under this rule against any person not a party to the action
who is or may be liable to the third-party defendant for all or
part of the claim made in the action against the third-party
defendant. The third-party complaint, if within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, may be in rem against a vessel, cargo, or other property subject to admiralty or maritime

C(6)(b)(i) in the property arrested.. . . . .

(c) Admiralty and maritime claims.--When a plaintiff as-serts an admiralty or maritime claim within the meaning of
Rule 9(h), the defendant or person who asserts a right underSupplemental Rule C(6)(b)(i), as a third-party plaintiff, may
bring in a third-party defendant who may be wholly or partlyliable, either to the plaintiff or to the third-party plaintiff, by
way of remedy over, contribution, or otherwise on accountof the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions
or occurrences. In such a case the third-party plaintiff mayalso demand judgment against the third-party defendant in
favor of the plaintiff, in which event the third-party defendant shall make any defenses to the claim of the plaintiff aswell as to that of the third-party plaintiff in the manner provided in Rule 12 and the action shall proceed as if the plain-tiff had commenced it against the third-party defendant as
well as the third-party plaintiff.

disclosure.

(a) Required disclosures; methods to discover additional
matter.(

awaiting a discovery request, provide to other parties:

(A) the name and, if known, the address and telephone number of each individual likely to have discover-able information that the disclosing party may use to

support its claims or defenses, unless solely for impeach-ment, identifying the subjects of the information;

things that are in the possession, custody, or controlof the party and that the disclosing party may use

to support its claims or defenses, unless solely forimpeachment;

(C) a computation of any category of damages claimedby the disclosing party, making available for inspection
and copying as under Rule 34 the documents or otherevidentiary material, not privileged or protected from
disclosure, on which such computation is based, includ-ing materials bearing on the nature and extent of injuries suffered; and(D) for inspection and copying as under Rule 34 any
insurance agreement under which any person carryingon an insurance business may be liable to satisfy part or
all of a judgment which may be entered in the action orto indemnify or reimburse for payments made to satisfy
the judgment.(E) The following categories of proceedings are exempt from initial disclosure under Rule 26(a)(1):

(i) an action for review on an administrativerecord;

(ii) a petition for habeas corpus or other proceed-ing to challenge a criminal conviction or sentence;
(iii) an action brought without counsel by a per-son in custody of the United States, a state, or a
state subdivision;(iv) an action to enforce or quash an administrative summons or subpoena;(v) an action by the United States to recover benefit payments;(vi) an action by the United States to collect on a
student loan guaranteed by the United States;(vii) a proceeding ancillary to proceedings in
other courts; and

(viii) an action to enforce an arbitration award.

These disclosures must be made at or within 14 days
after the Rule 26(f) conference unless a different time is
set by stipulation or court order, or unless a party obDate/Time: 08-17-01 13:25:22

1164 RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

jects during the conference that initial disclosures arenot appropriate in the circumstances of the action and

states the objection in the Rule 26(f) discovery plan. Inruling on the objection, the court must determine what
disclosures--if any--are to be made, and set the timefor disclosure. Any party first served or otherwise
joined after the Rule 26(f) conference must make thesedisclosures within 30 days after being served or joined
unless a different time is set by stipulation or courtorder. A party must make its initial disclosures based
on the information then reasonably available to it and isnot excused from making its disclosures because it has
not fully completed its investigation of the case orbecause it challenges the sufficiency of another party's
disclosures or because another party has not made itsdisclosures.
. . . . .
(3) Pretrial disclosures.--In addition to the disclosuresrequired by Rule 26(a)(1) and (2), a party must provide to

other parties and promptly file with the court the followinginformation regarding the evidence that it may present at
trial other than solely for impeachment:

(A) the name and, if not previously provided, the ad-dress and telephone number of each witness, separately

identifying those whom the party expects to present andthose whom the party may call if the need arises;

(B) the designation of those witnesses whose testimony is expected to be presented by means of a deposi-tion and, if not taken stenographically, a transcript of

the pertinent portions of the deposition testimony; and

(C) an appropriate identification of each document orother exhibit, including summaries of other evidence,

separately identifying those which the party expects tooffer and those which the party may offer if the need
arises.
Unless otherwise directed by the court, these disclosures
must be made at least 30 days before trial. Within 14 days

Date/Time: 08-17-01 13:25:22
Job: 529RUL Unit: U3CV Pagination Table: RULES1

1165RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE
thereafter, unless a different time is specified by the court,
a party may serve and promptly file a list disclosing (i) any
objections to the use under Rule 32(a) of a deposition designated by another party under Rule 26(a)(3)(B), and (ii) any
objection, together with the grounds therefor, that may be
made to the admissibility of materials identified under Rule
26(a)(3)(C). Objections not so disclosed, other than objections under Rules 402 and 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, are waived unless excused by the court for good cause.

(4) Form of disclosures.--Unless the court orders otherwise, all disclosures under Rules 26(a)(1) through (3) must
be made in writing, signed, and served.. . . . .

(b) Discovery scope and limits.--Unless otherwise limited
by order of the court in accordance with these rules, the
scope of discovery is as follows:

(1) In general.--Parties may obtain discovery regarding
any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the claim or
defense of any party, including the existence, description, nature, custody, condition, and location of any books, documents, or other tangible things and the identity and location
of persons having knowledge of any discoverable matter.
For good cause, the court may order discovery of any matter
relevant to the subject matter involved in the action. Relevant information need not be admissible at the trial if the
discovery appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. All discovery is subject to
the limitations imposed by Rule 26(b)(2)(i), (ii), and (iii).

(2) Limitations.--By order, the court may alter the limits
in these rules on the number of depositions and interrogatories or the length of depositions under Rule 30. By order
or local rule, the court may also limit the number of requests
under Rule 36. The frequency or extent of use of the discovery methods otherwise permitted under these rules and
by any local rule shall be limited by the court if it determines
that: (i) the discovery sought is unreasonably cumulative or
duplicative, or is obtainable from some other source that is

Date/Time: 08-17-01 13:25:22
Job: 529RUL Unit: U3CV Pagination Table: RULES1

1166 RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE
more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive; (ii) the
party seeking discovery has had ample opportunity by discovery in the action to obtain the information sought; or (iii)
the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs
its likely benefit, taking into account the needs of the case,
the amount in controversy, the parties' resources, the importance of the issues at stake in the litigation, and the importance of the proposed discovery in resolving the issues. The
court may act upon its own initiative after reasonable notice
or pursuant to a motion under Rule 26(c).. . . . .

(d) Timing and sequence of discovery.--Except in categories of proceedings exempted from initial disclosure under
Rule 26(a)(1)(E), or when authorized under these rules or
by order or agreement of the parties, a party may not seek
discovery from any source before the parties have conferred
as required by Rule 26(f). Unless the court upon motion,
for the convenience of parties and witnesses and in the interests of justice, orders otherwise, methods of discovery may
be used in any sequence, and the fact that a party is conducting discovery, whether by deposition or otherwise, does not
operate to delay any other party's discovery.. . . . .

( f ) Conference of parties; planning for discovery.--Except in categories of proceedings exempted from initial disclosure under Rule 26(a)(1)(E) or when otherwise ordered,
the parties must, as soon as practicable and in any event
at least 21 days before a scheduling conference is held or a
scheduling order is due under Rule 16(b), confer to consider
the nature and basis of their claims and defenses and the
possibilities for a prompt settlement or resolution of the case,
to make or arrange for the disclosures required by Rule
26(a)(1), and to develop a proposed discovery plan that indicates the parties' views and proposals concerning:

(1) what changes should be made in the timing, form,
or requirement for disclosures under Rule 26(a), includDate/Time: 08-17-01 13:25:22
Job: 529RUL Unit: U3CV Pagination Table: RULES1

1167RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE
ing a statement as to when disclosures under Rule
26(a)(1) were made or will be made;

(2) the subjects on which discovery may be needed,
when discovery should be completed, and whether discovery should be conducted in phases or be limited to or
focused upon particular issues;

(3) what changes should be made in the limitations on
discovery imposed under these rules or by local rule,
and what other limitations should be imposed; and

(4) any other orders that should be entered by the
court under Rule 26(c) or under Rule 16(b) and (c).

The attorneys of record and all unrepresented parties that
have appeared in the case are jointly responsible for arranging the conference, for attempting in good faith to agree on
the proposed discovery plan, and for submitting to the court
within 14 days after the conference a written report outlining the plan. A court may order that the parties or attorneys attend the conference in person. If necessary to comply with its expedited schedule for Rule 16(b) conferences, a
court may by local rule (i) require that the conference between the parties occur fewer than 21 days before the scheduling conference is held or a scheduling order is due under
Rule 16(b), and (ii) require that the written report outlining
the discovery plan be filed fewer than 14 days after the conference between the parties, or excuse the parties from submitting a written report and permit them to report orally on
their discovery plan at the Rule 16(b) conference.. . . . .

Rule 30. Depositions upon oral examination.. . . . .

(d) Schedule and duration; motion to terminate or limit
examination.

(1) Any objection during a deposition must be stated
concisely and in a non-argumentative and nonsuggestive manner. A person may instruct a deponent
not to answer only when necessary to preserve a priviDate/Time: 08-17-01 13:25:22

lege, to enforce a limitation directed by the court, or to
present a motion under Rule 30(d)(4).

(2) Unless otherwise authorized by the court or stipulated by the parties, a deposition is limited to one day
of seven hours. The court must allow additional time
consistent with Rule 26(b)(2) if needed for a fair examination of the deponent or if the deponent or another
person, or other circumstance, impedes or delays the
examination.

(3) If the court finds that any impediment, delay, or
other conduct has frustrated the fair examination of the
deponent, it may impose upon the persons responsible
an appropriate sanction, including the reasonable costs
and attorney's fees incurred by any parties as a result
thereof.

(4) At any time during a deposition, on motion of a
party or of the deponent and upon a showing that the
examination is being conducted in bad faith or in such
manner as unreasonably to annoy, embarrass, or oppress
the deponent or party, the court in which the action is
pending or the court in the district where the deposition
is being taken may order the officer conducting the examination to cease forthwith from taking the deposition,
or may limit the scope and manner of the taking of the
deposition as provided in Rule 26(c). If the order made
terminates the examination, it may be resumed thereafter only upon the order of the court in which the action
is pending. Upon demand of the objecting party or deponent, the taking of the deposition must be suspended
for the time necessary to make a motion for an order.
The provisions of Rule 37(a)(4) apply to the award of
expenses incurred in relation to the motion.. . . . .

( f ) Certification and delivery by officer; exhibits; copies.

(1) The officer must certify that the witness was
duly sworn by the officer and that the deposition is a
true record of the testimony given by the witness. This

certificate must be in writing and accompany the recordof the deposition. Unless otherwise ordered by the

court, the officer must securely seal the deposition in anenvelope or package indorsed with the title of the action
and marked "Deposition of [here insert name of wit-ness]" and must promptly send it to the attorney who
arranged for the transcript or recording, who must storeit under conditions that will protect it against loss, destruction, tampering, or deterioration. Documents andthings produced for inspection during the examination
of the witness must, upon the request of a party, be
marked for identification and annexed to the depositionand may be inspected and copied by any party, except

that if the person producing the materials desires to retain them the person may (A) offer copies to be marked
for identification and annexed to the deposition and to
serve thereafter as originals if the person affords to all
parties fair opportunity to verify the copies by comparison with the originals, or (B) offer the originals to be
marked for identification, after giving to each party an
opportunity to inspect and copy them, in which event
the materials may then be used in the same manner as
if annexed to the deposition. Any party may move for
an order that the original be annexed to and returned
with the deposition to the court, pending final disposition of the case.. . . . .

Rule 37. Failure to make disclosure or cooperate in discovery; sanctions.. . . . .

(c) Failure to disclose; false or misleading disclosure;
refusal to admit.

(1) A party that without substantial justification
fails to disclose information required by Rule 26(a) or
26(e)(1), or to amend a prior response to discovery as
required by Rule 26(e)(2), is not, unless such failure is
harmless, permitted to use as evidence at a trial, at a

the court, on motion and after affording an opportunityto be heard, may impose other appropriate sanctions.
In addition to requiring payment of reasonable ex-penses, including attorney's fees, caused by the failure,
these sanctions may include any of the actions author-ized under Rule 37(b)(2)(A), (B), and (C) and may include
informing the jury of the failure to make the disclosure.. . . . .

that the government will seek the forfeiture of property as
part of any sentence in accordance with the applicable
statute.

1184 RULES OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE

(b) Entry of preliminary order of forfeiture; post verdicthearing.

(1) As soon as practicable after entering a guilty ver-dict or accepting a plea of guilty or nolo contendere on
any count in an indictment or information with regardto which criminal forfeiture is sought, the court shall
determine what property is subject to forfeiture underthe applicable statute. If forfeiture of specific property
is sought, the court shall determine whether the govern-ment has established the requisite nexus between the
property and the offense. If the government seeks apersonal money judgment against the defendant, the
court shall determine the amount of money that the de-fendant will be ordered to pay. The court's determination may be based on evidence already in the record,including any written plea agreement or, if the forfeiture
is contested, on evidence or information presented bythe parties at a hearing after the verdict or finding of
guilt.

(2) If the court finds that property is subject to for-feiture, it shall promptly enter a preliminary order of

forfeiture setting forth the amount of any money judg-ment or directing the forfeiture of specific property
without regard to any third party's interest in all or part
of it. Determining whether a third party has such aninterest shall be deferred until any third party files a

claim in an ancillary proceeding under Rule 32.2(c).(3) The entry of a preliminary order of forfeiture authorizes the Attorney General (or a designee) to seizethe specific property subject to forfeiture; to conduct
any discovery the court considers proper in identifying,locating, or disposing of the property; and to commence
proceedings that comply with any statutes governingthird-party rights. At sentencing--or at any time before sentencing if the defendant consents--the order offorfeiture becomes final as to the defendant and shall be
made a part of the sentence and included in the judgment. The court may include in the order of forfeiture

Date/Time: 08-17-01 13:26:35
Job: 529RUL Unit: U3CR Pagination Table: RULES1

1185RULES OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE
conditions reasonably necessary to preserve the prop-erty's value pending any appeal.

(4) Upon a party's request in a case in which a juryreturns a verdict of guilty, the jury shall determine
whether the government has established the requisitenexus between the property and the offense committed
by the defendant.
(c) Ancillary proceeding; final order of forfeiture.

(1) If, as prescribed by statute, a third party files apetition asserting an interest in the property to be forfeited, the court shall conduct an ancillary proceedingbut no ancillary proceeding is required to the extent that
the forfeiture consists of a money judgment.

(A) In the ancillary proceeding, the court may, on
motion, dismiss the petition for lack of standing, forfailure to state a claim, or for any other lawful reason. For purposes of the motion, the facts set forthin the petition are assumed to be true.

(B) After disposing of any motion filed underRule 32.2(c)(1)(A) and before conducting a hearing
on the petition, the court may permit the parties to
conduct discovery in accordance with the FederalRules of Civil Procedure if the court determines

that discovery is necessary or desirable to resolvefactual issues. When discovery ends, a party may
move for summary judgment under Rule 56 of theFederal Rules of Civil Procedure.
(2) When the ancillary proceeding ends, the courtshall enter a final order of forfeiture by amending the
preliminary order as necessary to account for any third-party rights. If no third party files a timely claim, the
preliminary order becomes the final order of forfeiture,if the court finds that the defendant (or any combination
of defendants convicted in the case) had an interest inthe property that is forfeitable under the applicable statute. The defendant may not object to the entry of the
final order of forfeiture on the ground that the property

Date/Time: 08-17-01 13:26:35
Job: 529RUL Unit: U3CR Pagination Table: RULES1

1186 RULES OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE

belongs, in whole or in part, to a codefendant or third
party, nor may a third party object to the final order
on the ground that the third party had an interest in
the property.

(3) If multiple third-party petitions are filed in the
same case, an order dismissing or granting one petition
is not appealable until rulings are made on all petitions,
unless the court determines that there is no just reason
for delay.

(4) An ancillary proceeding is not part of sentencing.

(d) Stay pending appeal.--If a defendant appeals from a
conviction or order of forfeiture, the court may stay the
order of forfeiture on terms appropriate to ensure that the
property remains available pending appellate review. A
stay does not delay the ancillary proceeding or the determination of a third party's rights or interests. If the court
rules in favor of any third party while an appeal is pending,
the court may amend the order of forfeiture but shall not
transfer any property interest to a third party until the decision on appeal becomes final, unless the defendant consents
in writing or on the record.

(e) Subsequently located property; substitute property.

(1) On the government's motion, the court may at any
time enter an order of forfeiture or amend an existing
order of forfeiture to include property that:

(A) is subject to forfeiture under an existing
order of forfeiture but was located and identified
after that order was entered; or

(B) is substitute property that qualifies for forfeiture under an applicable statute.

(2) If the government shows that the property is subject to forfeiture under Rule 32.2(e)(1), the court shall:

(A) enter an order forfeiting that property, or
amend an existing preliminary or final order to include it; and

(B) if a third party files a petition claiming aninterest in the property, conduct an ancillary proceeding under Rule 32.2(c).
(3) There is no right to trial by jury under Rule32.2(e).

Rule 38. Stay of execution.. . . . .

(e) Notice to victims and restitution.--A sanction im-posed as part of the sentence pursuant to 18 U. S. C. $$ 3555
or 3556 may, if an appeal of the conviction or sentence istaken, be stayed by the district court or by the court of appeals upon such terms as the court finds appropriate. Thecourt may issue such orders as may be reasonably necessary
to ensure compliance with the sanction upon disposition ofthe appeal, including the entering of a restraining order or
an injunction or requiring a deposit in whole or in part ofthe monetary amount involved into the registry of the district court or execution of a performance bond.. . . . .

AMENDMENTS TO THE FEDERAL RULES

OF EVIDENCE

Rule 103. Rulings on evidence.

(a) Effect of erroneous ruling.--Error may not be predicated upon a ruling which admits or excludes evidence unless
a substantial right of the party is affected, and

(1) Objection.--In case the ruling is one admitting evidence, a timely objection or motion to strike appears of
record, stating the specific ground of objection, if the
specific ground was not apparent from the context; or

(2) Offer of proof.--In case the ruling is one excluding
evidence, the substance of the evidence was made known
to the court by offer or was apparent from the context
within which questions were asked.

Once the court makes a definitive ruling on the record admitting or excluding evidence, either at or before trial, a
party need not renew an objection or offer of proof to preserve a claim of error for appeal.

(b) Record of offer and ruling.--The court may add any
other or further statement which shows the character of the
evidence, the form in which it was offered, the objection
made, and the ruling thereon. It may direct the making of
an offer in question and answer form.

(c) Hearing of jury.--In jury cases, proceedings shall be
conducted, to the extent practicable, so as to prevent inadmissible evidence from being suggested to the jury by any
means, such as making statements or offers of proof or asking questions in the hearing of the jury.

(d) Plain error.--Nothing in this rule precludes taking
notice of plain errors affecting substantial rights although
they were not brought to the attention of the court.

CONSTITUTIONAL LAW. See also Criminal Law, 5; False Claims

Act.

I. Commerce Clause.

Violence Against Women Act of 1994--Impact on interstate commerce.--Congress had no authority under Commerce Clause to enact 42
U. S. C. $ 13981, which provides victims of gender-motivated violence a
federal civil remedy. United States v. Morrison, p. 598.

II. Due Process.

1. Attorney's fees--Amendment of fee award.--Due process was violated when a District Court amended its attorney's fees judgment for respondent by joining petitioner--president and sole shareholder of defendant--as a party and simultaneously making petitioner liable for fee award.
Nelson v. Adams USA, Inc., p. 460.

2. Prosecutor's comments on presence at trial.--A prosecutor's comments that respondent had an opportunity to hear all other witnesses before testifying and tailor his testimony accordingly did not violate his
Fourteenth Amendment right to due process. Portuondo v. Agard, p. 61.

III. Enforcement Power.

Violence Against Women Act of 1994--Civil remedy against private individuals.--Congress had no authority under $ 5 of Fourteenth Amendment
to enact 42 U. S. C. $ 13981, which provides victims of gender-motivated
violence a federal civil remedy against private individuals. United States
v. Morrison, p. 598.

IV. Ex Post Facto Laws.

1. Extending intervals between parole considerations.--Retroactive
application of a Georgia law permitting extension of intervals between
parole considerations does not necessarily violate Ex Post Facto Clause,
but case is remanded for a determination whether Georgia law, in its
operation, violates Clause. Garner v. Jones, p. 244.

2. Sexual offenses--Repeal of corroboration requirement.--Retrospective application of a Texas statute repealing a corroboration requirement
for conviction of a defendant charged with certain sexual offenses violates
Ex Post Facto Clause. Carmell v. Texas, p. 513.

V. Freedom of Expression.

Banning public nudity.--Pennsylvania Supreme Court's judgment invalidating, on freedom of expression grounds, Erie's ordinance banning
public nudity is reversed. Erie v. Pap's A. M., p. 277.

VI. Freedom of Speech.

1. Public university--Funding student speech.--First Amendment permits a public university to charge its students an activity fee used to fund

1209INDEX
CONSTITUTIONAL LAW--Continued.
a viewpoint-neutral program to facilitate extracurricular student speech.
Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis. System v. Southworth, p. 217.

2. Telecommunications Act of 1996--Cable television regulation--Sexually oriented programming.--Because Government failed to prove that

$ 505 of Act, which requires cable television operators to fully scramble
sexually oriented programming before 10 p.m., is least restrictive means
for addressing "signal bleed," District Court did not err in holding statute
violative of First Amendment. United States v. Playboy Entertainment
Group, Inc., p. 803.

VII. Privilege Against Self-Incrimination.

Prosecutor's comments on presence at trial.--A prosecutor's comments
that respondent had an opportunity to hear all other witnesses before
testifying and tailor his testimony accordingly did not violate his Fifth
Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. Portuondo v. Agard,
p. 61.

VIII. Right to be Present at Trial and Confront Accusers.

Prosecutor's comments.--A prosecutor's comments that respondent had
an opportunity to hear all other witnesses before testifying and tailor his
testimony accordingly did not violate his Sixth Amendment rights to be
present at trial and confront his accusers. Portuondo v. Agard, p. 61.

IX. Right to Counsel.

Effective assistance--Failure to present mitigating evidence.--Fourth
Circuit's decision concluding that petitioner was not denied his right to
effective assistance of counsel when his trial lawyers failed to investigate
and to present substantial mitigating evidence is reversed. Williams v.
Taylor, p. 362.

X. Searches and Seizures.

1. Bus passenger--Manipulation of luggage.--A law enforcement officer's physical manipulation of a bus passenger's carry-on luggage violates
Fourth Amendment's proscription against unreasonable searches. Bond
v. United States, p. 334.

2. Stop and frisk--Anonymous tip.--An anonymous tip that a person
is carrying a gun is not, without more, sufficient to justify a police officer's
stop and frisk of that person. Florida v. J. L., p. 266.

CONVICTIONS AS EVIDENCE. See Criminal Law, 3.
CRIMINAL LAW. See Constitutional Law, II, 2; IV; VII-X; Habeas

in" commerce or commerce-affecting activity, arson of such a dwelling
is not subject to federal prosecution under 18 U. S. C. $ 844(i). Jones v.
United States, p. 848.

2. Federal bribery statute--Medicare provider fraud.--In prohibiting
defrauding organizations that "receiv[e] . . . benefits in excess of $10,000
under a Federal program," 18 U. S. C. $ 666(b) covers fraud perpetrated
on organizations participating in Medicare. Fischer v. United States,
p. 667.

3. Prior conviction--Pre-emptive admission by defendant.--Where
Government's motion in limine to admit a defendant's prior felony conviction as impeachment evidence is granted and defendant then preemptively introduces that prior conviction evidence on direct examination,
defendant may not challenge admission of such evidence on appeal. Ohler
v. United States, p. 753.

4. Supervised release--Effect of excess prison time.--Controlling statute, 18 U. S. C. $ 3624(e), by its necessary operation, does not reduce length
of a supervised release term by reason of excess time served in prison.
United States v. Johnson, p. 53.

5. Supervised release following reimprisonment.--In authorizing a district court to impose an additional term of supervised release following
reimprisonment of those who violate conditions of an initial term, 18
U. S. C. $ 3583(h) does not apply retroactively, so no ex post facto violation occurred in this case; but $ 3583(e)(3), at time of Johnson's conviction,
gave District Court authority to reimpose supervised release. Johnson v.

as amended by Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, a
"fail[ure] to develop the factual basis of [a] claim in State court" is not
established unless there is a lack of diligence, or some greater fault, attributable to federal habeas petitioner or his counsel. Williams v. Taylor, p. 420.

3. Successive petition--Dismissal on procedural grounds.--A federal
habeas corpus petition filed after an initial petition was dismissed on procedural grounds without reaching prisoner's underlying constitutional
