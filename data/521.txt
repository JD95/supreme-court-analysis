CASES ADJUDGED

IN THE

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

AT
OCTOBER TERM, 1996

UNITED STATES v. ALASKA
on exceptions to report of special master
No. 84, Orig. Argued February 24, 1997--Decided June 19, 1997
This suit involves a dispute between the United States and Alaska over

the ownership of submerged lands along the State's Arctic Coast. The
Alaska Statehood Act expressly provides that the federal Submerged
Lands Act applies to Alaska. The latter Act entitles Alaska to submerged lands beneath tidal and inland navigable waters and submerged
lands extending three miles seaward of the State's coastline. The
United States claims a right to offer lands in the Beaufort Sea for mineral leasing, and Alaska seeks to quiet its title to coastal submerged
lands within two federal reservations, the National Petroleum ReserveAlaska (Reserve) and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, formerly
known as the Arctic National Wildlife Range (Range). Both parties
have filed exceptions to the Special Master's Report.

Held:

1. Alaska's exception to the recommended ruling that the State's submerged lands in the vicinity of barrier islands along its Arctic Coast
should be measured as a 3-mile belt from a coastline following the
normal baseline under the Convention on the Territorial Sea and the
Contiguous Zone (Convention) is overruled. The coastline from which
a State measures its Submerged Lands Act grant corresponds to the
baseline from which the United States measures its territorial sea under
the Convention. According to the Convention's normal baseline approach, each island has its own belt of territorial sea, measured outward
from a baseline corresponding to the low-water line along the island's
coast. Alaska objects to the application of this approach to the Stefans1

2 UNITED STATES v. ALASKA

Syllabus
son Sound--where some offshore islands are more than six miles apart
or more than six miles from the mainland--because it gives the United
States "enclaves" of submerged lands, wholly or partly surrounded by
state-owned submerged lands, beneath waters more than three miles
from the mainland but not within three miles of an island. United
States v. Louisiana, 470 U. S. 93, does not foreclose the conclusion that
the Convention's normal baseline principles apply here. Alaska has not
identified a firm and continuing United States rule treating waters between the mainland and fringing islands as "inland waters" when the
openings between the off-lying islands are no more than 10 miles wide.
The sources before the Master showed that, in its foreign relations, particularly in the period 1930 to 1949, the United States had advocated a
rule under which objectionable pockets of high seas between the mainland and fringing islands would be assimilated to a coastal nation's territorial sea. Such a rule would have been inconsistent with Alaska's 10-
mile rule, under which no objectionable pockets of high seas would have
existed. The United States also advocated a rule for treating the waters of a strait leading to an inland sea as inland waters, but it is not
equivalent to Alaska's rule. Pp. 7-22.

2. Alaska's exception to the recommended ruling that a gravel and
ice formation known as Dinkum Sands is not an island constituting part
of Alaska's coastline under the Submerged Lands Act is overruled. The
Master did not err in concluding that Dinkum Sands does not meet the
standard for an island because it is frequently below mean high water.
The Convention's drafting history suggests that, to qualify as an island,
a feature must be above high water except in abnormal circumstances.
It does not support the broader conclusion that a feature with a seasonal
loss in elevation that brings it below mean high water, such as Dinkum
Sands, qualifies. Nor is there any precedent for deeming Dinkum
Sands an island during the periods when it is above mean high water.
Pp. 22-32.

3. Alaska's exception to the recommended ruling that submerged
lands beneath tidally influenced waters within the Reserve's boundary
did not pass to Alaska at statehood is overruled. The United States
can reserve submerged lands under federal control for an appropriate
public purpose. Under the strict standards of Utah Div. of State Lands
v. United States, 482 U. S. 193, the 1923 Executive Order creating the
Reserve reflected a clear intent to include submerged lands within the
Reserve. In addition to the fact that the Order refers to coastal features and necessarily covers the tidelands, excluding submerged lands
beneath the coastal features would have been inconsistent with the Reserve's purpose--to secure an oil supply that would necessarily exist

Syllabus
beneath both submerged lands and uplands. Section 11(b) of the Alaska
Statehood Act, which noted that the United States owned the Reserve
and included a statement of exclusive legislative jurisdiction under the
Enclave Clause, reflects Congress' intent to ratify the inclusion of submerged lands within the Reserve and to defeat the State's title to those
lands. Pp. 32-46.

4. The United States' exception to the recommended ruling that offshore submerged lands within the Range's boundaries passed to Alaska
at statehood is sustained. The United States did not transfer such
lands to Alaska at statehood. The 1957 Bureau of Sport Fisheries
and Wildlife application to create a wildlife refuge clearly encompassed
submerged lands. Since its seaward boundary is the low-water line
along Alaska's coast, the Range necessarily encompasses the tidelands.
The justification statement accompanying the application, which describes the habitat of various species along the coast and beneath inland
waters, further reflects a clear intent to withhold submerged lands.
A Department of the Interior regulation in effect when the application
was filed and when Congress passed the Alaska Statehood Act operated
to "segregate" the lands for which the application was pending. Section
6(e) of that Act expressly prevented lands that had been "set apart as
[a] refug[e]" from passing to Alaska. It follows that, because all of the
lands covered by the 1957 application had been so "set apart," the
United States retained title to submerged lands within the Range.
Pp. 46-61.

Exceptions of Alaska overruled; exception of United States sustained;

Special Master's recommendations adopted to the extent consistent with
the Court's opinion.

Opinion of the Court
of Alaska, Joanne M. Grace, Assistant Attorney General, and
John Briscoe.*

Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.
This original action presents a dispute between the United
States and the State of Alaska over the ownership of submerged lands along Alaska's Arctic Coast. In 1979, with
leave of the Court, 442 U. S. 937, the United States filed a
bill of complaint setting out a dispute over the right to offer
lands in the Beaufort Sea for mineral leasing. Alaska counterclaimed, seeking a decree quieting its title to coastal
submerged lands within two federal reservations, the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska and the Arctic National
Wildlife Range (now the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge).
The Court appointed a Special Master. 444 U. S. 1065
(1980). Between 1980 and 1986, the Special Master oversaw
extensive hearings and briefing. Before us now are the report of the Special Master and the exceptions of the parties.
We overrule Alaska's exceptions and sustain that of the
United States.

Opinion of the Court
leases for offshore exploration and to share in oil and gasrevenues from the contested lands.

Several general principles govern our analysis of the par-ties' claims. Ownership of submerged lands--which carries
with it the power to control navigation, fishing, and other
public uses of water--is an essential attribute of sovereignty.
Utah Div. of State Lands v. United States, 482 U. S. 193, 195
(1987). Under the doctrine of Lessee of Pollard v. Hagan, 3How. 212, 228-229 (1845), new States are admitted to the

Union on an "equal footing" with the original 13 Coloniesand succeed to the United States' title to the beds of navigable waters within their boundaries. Although the United
States has the power to divest a future State of its equal
footing title to submerged lands, we do not "lightly infer"
such action. Utah Div. of State Lands, supra, at 197.

In United States v. California, 332 U. S. 19 (1947) (California I), we distinguished between submerged lands located
shoreward of the low-water line along the State's coast and
submerged lands located seaward of that line. Only lands
shoreward of the low-water line--that is, the periodically
submerged tidelands and inland navigable waters--pass to
a State under the equal footing doctrine. The original 13
Colonies had no right to lands seaward of the coastline, and
newly created States therefore cannot claim them on an
equal footing rationale. Id., at 30-33. Accordingly, the
United States has paramount sovereign rights in submerged
lands seaward of the low-water line. Id., at 33-36. In 1953,
following the California I decision, Congress enacted the
Submerged Lands Act, 67 Stat. 29, 43 U. S. C. $ 1301 et seq.
That Act "confirmed" and "established" States' title to and
interest in "lands beneath navigable waters within the
boundaries of the respective States." $ 1311(a). The Act
defines "lands beneath navigable waters" to include both
lands that would ordinarily pass to a State under the equal
footing doctrine and lands over which the United States has
paramount sovereign rights, beneath a 3-mile belt of the ter521US1 Unit: $U74 [11-17-99 14:25:33] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
ritorial sea. $ 1301(a). The Act essentially confirms States'equal footing rights to tidelands and submerged lands beneath inland navigable waters; it also establishes States' titleto submerged lands beneath a 3-mile belt of the territorial
sea, which would otherwise be held by the United States.
California ex rel. State Lands Comm'n v. United States, 457U. S. 273, 283 (1982). The Alaska Statehood Act expressly

provides that the Submerged Lands Act applies to Alaska.Pub. L. 85-508, $ 6(m), 72 Stat. 343 (1958). As a general
matter, then, Alaska is entitled under both the equal footingdoctrine and the Submerged Lands Act to submerged lands
beneath tidal and inland navigable waters, and under the
Submerged Lands Act alone to submerged lands extending
three miles seaward of its coastline.

In hearings before the Special Master, the parties identified 15 specific issues for resolution, which we treat in three
groups. First, the parties disputed the legal principles governing Alaska's ownership of submerged lands near certain
barrier islands along the Arctic Coast. Second, the parties
contested the proper legal characterization of particular
coastal features, including a gravel and ice formation in the
Flaxman Island chain known as Dinkum Sands. Third, the
parties disputed whether, when Alaska became a State, the
United States retained ownership of certain submerged
lands located within two federal reservations, the National
Petroleum Reserve-Alaska in the northwest and the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge in the northeast. For each reservation, the Master considered both whether the seaward
boundary encompassed certain disputed waters and whether
particular executive and congressional actions prevented the
lands beneath tidally influenced waters from passing to
Alaska at statehood.

Alaska excepts to three of the Master's recommendations.
First, it claims that the Master erred in concluding that waters between the Alaskan mainland and certain barrier islands were not "inland waters," the limits of which would

Opinion of the Court
form a portion of the State's coastline for purposes ofmeasuring the State's 3-mile Submerged Lands Act grant.

Alaska argues that, at the time of its statehood, the UnitedStates had a clear policy of enclosing waters behind nearfringing islands as "inland waters." In abandoning thatpolicy in 1971, Alaska argues, the Federal Government
impermissibly "contracted" Alaska's recognized territory.Second, the State challenges the Master's conclusion that
Dinkum Sands is not an "island." Under the Master's ap-proach, the low-water line on Dinkum Sands is not part of
Alaska's coastline, and the State cannot claim ownership ofsubmerged lands, covering an area of 28 square miles, surrounding the feature. Alaska argues that the Master erredin construing the relevant definition of an "island" and in
applying that definition to Dinkum Sands. Third, the Stateclaims that the Master erred in determining that the United
States retained ownership of certain submerged lands withinthe boundaries of the National Petroleum Reserve at Alaska's statehood. Alaska argues both that the Executivelacked authority to prevent submerged lands from passing to
Alaska, and that any attempt to include submerged landswithin the Reserve was not sufficiently clear to defeat Alaska's title under the equal footing doctrine or under the Sub-merged Lands Act.

The United States excepts to the Master's recommenda-tion concerning the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The
Master concluded, among other things, that an administra-tive application for the Refuge was insufficient to "set apart"
submerged lands within the proposed boundaries. As aresult, the Master concluded, submerged lands within the
Refuge passed to Alaska at statehood.We consider these exceptions in turn.

8 UNITED STATES v. ALASKA

Opinion of the Court
343 (1958), Congress granted the State title to submergedlands beneath a 3-mile belt of the territorial sea, measured

from the State's "coast line." 43 U. S. C. $$ 1301(a)(2),1311(a). The Act defines the term "coast line" as "the line
of ordinary low water along that portion of the coast which
is in direct contact with the open sea and the line markingthe seaward limit of inland waters." $ 1301(c). Alaska's

first exception requires us to consider how the presence ofbarrier islands along its northern shore affects the delimitation of its coastline. The issue is of primary relevance in theBeaufort Sea, between the National Petroleum ReserveAlaska and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. A joint
federal-state sale of mineral leases covering this so-called
Leased Area, conducted in December 1979, yielded large
sums now held in escrow awaiting the outcome of this suit.

In cases in which the Submerged Lands Act does not expressly address questions that might arise in locating a
coastline, we have relied on the definitions and principles of
the Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous
Zone, Apr. 29, 1958, [1964] 15 U. S. T. 1606 (Convention).
See United States v. California, 381 U. S. 139, 165 (1965)
(California II). Specifically, the coastline from which a
State measures its Submerged Lands Act grant corresponds
to the "baseline" from which the United States measures its
territorial sea under the Convention. The Government argued before the Special Master that the United States measures its territorial sea from a "normal baseline"--the lowwater line along the coast, Art. 3, supplemented by closing
lines drawn across bays and mouths of rivers, see Arts. 7,
13. Under Article 10(2) of the Convention, each island has
its own belt of territorial sea, measured outward from a baseline corresponding to the low-water line along the island's
coast.

Although the United States now claims a territorial sea
belt of 12 nautical miles, see Presidential Proclamation No.
5928, 3 CFR 547 (1988 Comp.), note following 43 U. S. C.

Opinion of the Court

$ 1331, we are concerned in this case only with the 3-milebelt of the territorial sea that determines a State's Submerged Lands Act grant. Under Article 6 of the Conven-tion, the outer limit of that territorial sea belt is a line every
point of which is three miles from the nearest point of the
baseline. This means of measuring the outer limit of thebelt is also known as the "arcs-of-circles" method.

Alaska objected to application of the Article 3 "normalbaseline" approach to its Arctic Coast. In the Leased Area
of the Beaufort Sea, some offshore islands are more than sixmiles apart or more than six miles from the mainland. If
Alaska owns only those offshore submerged lands beneath
each 3-mile belt of territorial sea, the United States will own
"enclaves" of submerged lands, wholly or partly surrounded
by state-owned submerged lands, beneath waters more than
three miles from the mainland but not within three miles of
an island. Two such federal enclaves exist in the Leased
Area between the mainland and the Flaxman Island chain,
beneath the waters of Stefansson Sound. To eliminate these
enclaves, Alaska offered alternative theories for determining
the seaward limit of its submerged lands in the vicinity of
barrier islands. Alaska principally contended that the
United States should be required to draw "straight baselines" connecting the barrier islands and to measure the territorial sea from those baselines. Article 4 of the Convention permits a nation to use straight baselines to measure its
territorial sea "[i]n localities where the coast line is deeply
indented and cut into, or if there is a fringe of islands along
the coast in its immediate vicinity." The parties agree that
Alaska's coastline satisfies this description. Under this approach, waters landward of the baseline would be treated as
"inland" waters, and Alaska would own all submerged lands
beneath those waters.

The Master rejected this approach, finding that the use of
straight baselines under Article 4 is permissive, not mandatory, and that the decision whether to use straight baselines

521US1 Unit: $U74 [11-17-99 14:25:33] PAGES PGT: OPIN
10 UNITED STATES v. ALASKA

Opinion of the Court
is normally one for the Federal Government. Report of the
Special Master 45 (hereinafter Report). The United States
has never opted to draw straight baselines under Article 4.
See California II, supra, at 167-169; United States v. Louisiana, 394 U. S. 11, 72-73 (1969) (Louisiana Boundary
Case); United States v. Louisiana, 470 U. S. 93, 99 (1985)
(Alabama and Mississippi Boundary Case); United States v.
Maine, 475 U. S. 89, 94, n. 9 (1986) (Massachusetts Boundary
Case). As a variant of its straight baselines argument,
Alaska claimed that the United States has historically
treated waters between the mainland and fringing islands as
"inland waters," so long as the openings between the offlying islands are no more than 10 miles wide. Alaska did
not argue that the United States had ever specifically asserted, in its dealings with foreign nations, that the waters
of Stefansson Sound are inland waters. Rather, Alaska attempted to identify a general but consistent "10-mile rule"
invoked by the United States in its domestic and international affairs. If applied to Alaska's Arctic Coast, the State
argued, this rule would require treating the waters of Stefansson Sound as inland waters.

The Master examined the boundary delimitation practices
of the United States and concluded that the United States
did not have a well-established rule for treating waters between the mainland and fringing islands as inland waters.
The Master recognized that, in the Alabama and Mississippi Boundary Case, we suggested that between 1903 and
1961 the United States had "enclos[ed] as inland waters those
areas between the mainland and off-lying islands that were
so closely grouped that no entrance exceeded 10 geographical
miles." 470 U. S., at 106-107. Observing that this statement was not "strictly necessary" to the decision in the Alabama and Mississippi Boundary Case, the Master declined
to rely on it here. The Master therefore concluded that, for
purposes of measuring Alaska's submerged lands, the State's

521US1 Unit: $U74 [11-17-99 14:25:33] PAGES PGT: OPIN

11Cite as: 521 U. S. 1 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
coastline should correspond to a normal baseline under Arti-cle 3 of the Convention.

For the reasons discussed below, we find no error in theMaster's approach.

A
Under the Convention, a nation's past boundary delimita-tion practice is relevant in a narrow context: specifically,

when a nation claims that certain waters are "historic" in-land waters under Article 7(6) of the Convention. If certain
geographic criteria are met, Article 7(4) of the Conventionpermits a nation to draw a "closing line" across the mouth of
a bay and to measure its territorial sea outward from thatline. Waters enclosed by the line are considered internal
waters. Article 7(6) also permits a nation to enclose "his-toric" bays, even if those waters do not satisfy the geographic criteria of Article 7(4). For a body of water to qual-ify as a historic bay, the coastal nation "must have effectively
exercised sovereignty over the area continuously during atime sufficient to create a usage and have done so under the
general toleration" of the community of nations. Id., at 102(citing Juridical Regime of Historic Waters, Including Historic Bays 56, U. N. Doc. A/CN.4/143 (1962)) (internal quota-tion marks omitted). Accordingly, where a State within the
United States wishes to claim submerged lands based on anarea's status as historic inland waters, the State must demonstrate that the United States: (1) exercises authority overthe area; (2) has done so continuously; and (3) has done so
with the acquiescence of foreign nations. See Alabama andMississippi Boundary Case, supra, at 101-102.

Recognizing these strict evidentiary requirements, Alaskadoes not contend that the waters of Stefansson Sound are
historic inland waters. Alaska does not purport to show any
specific assertion by the United States that the waters ofStefansson Sound are inland waters. Rather, Alaska argues

that, at the time it was admitted to the Union, the UnitedStates had a general, publicly stated policy of enclosing as

521US1 Unit: $U74 [11-17-99 14:25:33] PAGES PGT: OPIN
12 UNITED STATES v. ALASKA

Opinion of the Court
inland waters areas between the mainland and closelygrouped fringing islands. If this general formula is applied

to the Alaska's Arctic Coast, the State argues, the waters ofStefansson Sound qualify as inland waters. Alaska maintains that this policy was in effect from the early 1900's to
1971, when the United States published a set of chartsstrictly applying the arcs-of-circles method to Stefansson

Sound. In Alaska's view, relying solely on the Convention'snormal baseline approach to delimit the State's submerged
lands impermissibly contracts the State's recognized terri-tory from that which existed at the time of statehood.

Since adopting the Convention's definitions to give content
to the Submerged Lands Act, we have never sustained a
State's claim to submerged lands based solely on an assertion
that the United States had adhered to a certain general
boundary delimitation practice at the time of statehood. In
the Louisiana Boundary Case, we left open the possibility
that Louisiana could claim ownership of certain submerged
lands by demonstrating a "firm and continuing international
policy" of enclosing waters between the mainland and island
fringes as "inland waters." 394 U. S., at 74, n. 97. Had that
been the United States' "consistent official international
stance," the Government "arguably could not abandon that
stance solely to gain advantage in a lawsuit to the detriment
of Louisiana." Ibid. In that litigation, the State ultimately
failed to demonstrate any firm and continuing international
policy of enclosing waters behind island fringes as inland
waters. See United States v. Louisiana, 420 U. S. 529, 529-
530 (1975) (per curiam) (decree) (accepting Master's recommendation that certain actions by the United States did not
establish a general policy of applying straight baselines to
near-fringing islands); Report of Special Master in United
States v. Louisiana, O. T. 1974, No. 9 Orig., pp. 7-13. Alaska
nevertheless claims that in the Alabama and Mississippi
Boundary Case the Court identified a "firm and continuing"
10-mile rule for fringing islands. Alaska first contends that

521US1 Unit: $U74 [11-17-99 14:25:33] PAGES PGT: OPIN

13Cite as: 521 U. S. 1 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
the Alabama and Mississippi Boundary Case precludes theGovernment from claiming that the waters of Stefansson

Sound are not inland waters. The State then argues in thealternative that independent evidence supports its formulation of the rule. We address Alaska's points in turn.

B
In the Alabama and Mississippi Boundary Case, theCourt considered the States' claim that the waters of Mississippi Sound constituted "historic" inland waters under Arti-cle 7(6) of the Convention. In discussing whether the States
had shown that the United States had continuously assertedthe inland water status of Mississippi Sound, the Court identified a general policy "of enclosing as inland waters thoseareas between the mainland and off-lying islands that were
so closely grouped that no entrance exceeded 10 geographicalmiles." 470 U. S., at 106.

Alaska argues that the Government is estopped from ques-tioning application of this general coastline delimitation
practice to its Arctic Coast. Alaska recognizes the rule thatthe doctrine of nonmutual collateral estoppel is generally unavailable in litigation against the United States, see United
States v. Mendoza, 464 U. S. 154, 160-163 (1984), but suggeststhat the policy considerations underlying this rule do not

apply to cases arising under the Court's original jurisdiction,where the Court acts as factfinder and the United States has
an incentive to fully litigate all essential issues.We have not had occasion to consider application of nonmutual collateral estoppel in an original jurisdiction case, andwe see no reason to develop an exception to

Mendoza here.Even if the doctrine applied against the Government in an

original jurisdiction case, it could only preclude relitigationof issues of fact or law

necessary to a court's judgment.Montana v. United States, 440 U. S. 147, 153 (1979); Mendoza, supra, at 158. A careful reading of the Alabama andMississippi Boundary Case makes clear that the Court did

521US1 Unit: $U74 [11-17-99 14:25:33] PAGES PGT: OPIN
14 UNITED STATES v. ALASKA

Opinion of the Court
not attach controlling legal significance to any general de-limitation formula.

The Master in that case recited a series of statements andprecedents following Mississippi's admission to the Union
supporting the view that the Federal Government had
treated the waters of Mississippi Sound as inland waters.These statements included multiple references to a rule for

closing gulfs, bays, and estuaries with mouths less than 10miles wide as inland waters, Report of Special Master in

Alabama and Mississippi Boundary Case, O. T. 1983, No. 9Orig., pp. 40, 42, 48-49, 52, and to a rule for closing straits

leading to inland waters, id., at 42, 49-50. In addition, the
Master cited a 1961 letter from the Solicitor General to the
Director of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey
concerning coastline delimitation principles for the Gulf of
Mexico, proposing to treat " `[w]aters enclosed between the
mainland and offlying islands . . . so closely grouped that no
entrance exceeds ten miles' " as inland waters. Id., at 52.

In excepting to the Master's conclusion that the waters of
Mississippi Sound qualified as historic inland waters, the
United States argued that the "generalized . . . formulations"
recited by the Master could not support the States' claim,
without evidence of specific federal claims to inland waters
status for Mississippi Sound. Exceptions of United States
in Alabama and Mississippi Boundary Case, O. T. 1983, No.
9 Orig., pp. 32-33. The Court assumed that the United
States' position was correct, but concluded that the States
had in fact identified "specific assertions of the status of [Mississippi] Sound as inland waters." 470 U. S., at 107; see id.,
at 108-110.

In light of the Court's assumption that specific assertions
of dominion would be critical to the States' historic title
claim, we cannot conclude that any general delimitation policy identified in the Alabama and Mississippi Boundary
Case is controlling here. The Court's inquiry in the Alabama and Mississippi Boundary Case was not whether the

15Cite as: 521 U. S. 1 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
States had demonstrated a "firm and continuing interna-tional policy" of enclosing waters between the mainland and

island fringes as inland waters, sufficiently well defined tocover the waters of Mississippi Sound. Rather, the inquiry
was whether the States had demonstrated that the Soundmet the specific requirements for a historic inland waters
claim under Article 7(6) of the Convention. In the contextof that claim, the variation or imprecision in the United
States' general boundary delimitation principles might havebeen irrelevant because the State could point to specific federal assertions that Mississippi Sound consisted of inland wa-ters. But variation and imprecision in general boundary delimitation principles become relevant where, as here, a Staterelies solely on such principles for its claim that certain waters were inland waters at statehood. The United States istherefore free to argue that any 10-mile rule is not sufficiently well defined to support Alaska's claim that the watersof Stefansson Sound constitute inland waters.

C
Alaska argues that even if principles of collateral estoppeldo not apply, the evidence before the Master established that

the United States had a well-defined, "firm and continuing"10-mile rule that would require treating certain areas along
Alaska's Arctic Coast as inland waters. The Master exhaus-tively cataloged documents and statements reflecting the
United States' views and practices on boundary delimitation,both in its international relations and in disputes with various States, between 1903 and 1971. The Master found that"the exact nature of the United States' historic practice is a
matter of some intricacy," and concluded that any 10-milerule was not sufficiently well defined to require treating the
waters of Stefansson Sound as inland waters. Report 55.Alaska argues that the Master afforded "undue significance
to minor variations in the way the United States expressedits otherwise consistent policy over time, ignoring the prin521US1 Unit: $U74 [11-17-99 14:25:33] PAGES PGT: OPIN
16 UNITED STATES v. ALASKA

Opinion of the Court
ciple that minor uncertainties and even contradictions in anation's practice are legally insignificant." Exceptions of

State of Alaska 14 (Alaska Exceptions Brief). The relevantsources do not bear out Alaska's claim.

Of particular importance for our analysis is the position of
the United States in its foreign relations between 1930 and1949. In March 1930, the United States formally proposed

certain principles for delimiting inland waters to the Leagueof Nations Conference for the Codification of International
Law. See 3 Acts of the Conference for the Codification ofInternational Law, Territorial Waters 195-201 (1930) (Acts
of the Conference). As the Geographer of the Department
of State later observed, where the mainland and offshore islands are assigned individual 3-mile belts of territorial sea,
there will remain "small pockets of the high sea deeply indenting territorial waters." U. S. Exh. 85-223 (Boggs, Delimitation of the Territorial Sea, 24 Am. J. Int'l L. 541, 552
(1930)). Because such pockets would "constitute no useful
portion of the high sea from the viewpoint of navigation,"
ibid., the United States proposed that countries "assimilate"
these small enclaves of high seas to the adjacent territorial
sea where a single straight line of no more than four nautical
miles in length would enclose an enclave, 3 Acts of the Conference 201. At the same Conference, the United States
also proposed a rule for straits. Where a strait connected
"two seas having the character of high seas," the waters of
the strait would be considered territorial waters of the
coastal nation, as long as both entrances of the strait were
less than six nautical miles wide. Id., at 200. Where a
strait was "merely a channel of communication with an inland
sea," rules regarding closing of bays would apply. Id., at
201. Under those rules, waters shoreward of closing lines
less than 10 nautical miles in length would be treated as
"inland" waters. Id., at 198.

The United States' 1930 "assimilation" proposal is inconsistent with Alaska's assertion that, since the early 1900's,

17Cite as: 521 U. S. 1 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
the United States had followed a firm and continuing 10-milerule for fringing islands. If the United States' policy had

been to draw a baseline connecting islands no more than 10miles apart, all waters between that line and the mainland
would have been treated as "inland waters." Under the
1930 formula, however, there were "small pockets of the highsea" between that line and the mainland, and those pockets

would have been assimilated to territorial waters (that is,waters seaward of the coastline), not to inland waters (that
is, waters enclosed by the coastline). Alaska now arguesthat the 1930 assimilation proposal "was at most one of the
legally insignificant uncertainties or contradictions" rather
than a change from a firm 10-mile rule. Alaska Exceptions
Brief 25 (internal quotation marks omitted). Alaska took a
different position before the Special Master, where it argued
that the United States "unequivocally embraced the `assimilation' practice as the official United States position" between 1930 and 1949. Brief for Alaska on Island Fringes
54, 60-61; see Alaska Exh. 85-63 (Memorandum of United
States in Response to Request of Special Master in United
States v. California, O. T. 1949, No. 11 Orig., p. 19); Alaska
Exh. 85-82 (Aide-Me' moire from the Department of State to
the Government of Norway, Sept. 29, 1949, pp. 4-5). Alaska
cannot explain why the United States would have pointed to
the assimilation formula as its official position between 1930
and 1949 if a 10-mile rule for islands was in effect during
that time.

Nor does the United States' proposal on straits demonstrate a policy of connecting near-fringing islands with
straight baselines of less than 10 miles. If the mainland and
offshore islands form the two coasts of a strait, under the
United States' proposal the strait would be treated as territorial waters (not inland waters) if it linked two areas of high
seas. The distance between the fringing islands may have
some bearing on whether those islands in fact form the coast
of a strait, but not on whether the waters they enclose are

521US1 Unit: $U74 [11-17-99 14:25:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN
18 UNITED STATES v. ALASKA

Opinion of the Court
territorial or inland waters. In other words, under the 1930proposal, the character of the waters to which a strait leads,

not the distance between the islands forming one coast of thestrait, determines the character of the strait itself.

Rather than treating the mainland and a line connecting
fringing islands as the two coasts of a strait, Alaska appearsto view a passageway between two offshore islands, leading

to the waters between the islands and the mainland, as astrait. With this geographic configuration in mind, Alaska
argues that the proposal to apply a 10-mile bay-closing ruleto a strait serving as a "channel of communication with an
inland sea" is "fully consistent" with a 10-mile rule. Alaska
Exceptions Brief 25. But even under this approach, a rule
that straits leading to an inland sea are themselves inland
waters is not equivalent to a simple 10-mile rule. Again,
under the United States' 1930 proposal, the character of the
strait depends on the character of the waters to which it
leads. A 10-mile bay-closing rule would apply only if the
waters between the strait and the mainland were inland waters under some other principle. Under the simple 10-mile
rule that Alaska advocates, the fact that the islands are less
than 10 miles apart itself determines that the waters behind
the islands are inland waters.

In sum, although Alaska is correct that the United States'
position at the League of Nations Conference did not call for
strict application of the arcs-of-circles method, ibid., neither
the assimilation proposal nor the proposal for straits is fully
consistent with a simple rule that islands less than 10 miles
apart enclose inland waters.

The discussion above leads to the conclusion that, if the
United States had a 10-mile rule at Alaska's statehood, that
rule developed after 1949. Even if a rule developed within
a decade of Alaska's statehood could be considered a "firm
and continuing" one, Alaska has not shown that any such
rule would encompass the islands off its Arctic Coast. For
the period between 1950 and Alaska's statehood, Alaska fo521US1 Unit: $U74 [11-17-99 14:25:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
cuses principally on the United States' position in a series ofdisputes with States over ownership of submerged lands in

the vicinity of near-fringing islands, rather than on positionstaken in its international relations. First, in 1950, the State
Department and the Justice Department proposed a boundary between Louisiana's inland and territorial waters for usein the

Louisiana Boundary Case. That boundary, known
as the Chapman Line, followed certain barrier islandsalong Louisiana's southeast coast, enclosing Chandeleur and

Breton Sounds and Calliou Bay as inland waters. Accordingto Alaska, the Chapman Line shows the use of a simple 10-
mile rule. Second, in 1951, the Justice Department asked
the State Department to outline the United States' approach
to demarcating inland and territorial waters, for purposes of
submerged lands litigation between the United States and
California. A letter from the Acting Secretary of State
stated that an island "was to be surrounded by its own belt
of territorial waters measured in the same manner as in the
case of the mainland." Alaska Exh. 85-94 (Letter from
James E. Webb to J. Howard McGrath, Attorney General,
Nov. 13, 1951, p. 3). The letter also drew upon the 1930
Hague proposals for straits, noting that the waters of a strait
connecting high seas were never inland waters, but that
bay-closing rules should apply to a strait serving as "a channel of communication to an inland sea." Id., at 4. Third, in
a submission to the Court in 1958, the United States commented that waters behind certain islands in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama were inland waters. Brief for United
States in Support of Motion for Judgment on Amended Complaint in United States v. Louisiana, O. T. 1958, No. 9 Orig.,
pp. 177, 254, 261.

We agree with the Special Master that the United States
did not exclusively employ a simple 10-mile rule in its disputes with the Gulf States and with California. The 1951
State Department letter in the California litigation merely
echoed the United States' proposal at the Hague Conference

521US1 Unit: $U74 [11-17-99 14:25:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN
20 UNITED STATES v. ALASKA

Opinion of the Court
concerning straits leading to inland waters. As discussed
supra, at 18-19, a rule applying 10-mile bay-closing principles to straits leading to inland waters would not alwayslead to the same result as a simple 10-mile rule. Under

the former approach, the critical factor is where the strait
leads, not the width of the strait. Alaska does not attemptto show that Stefansson Sound is a strait leading to inland

waters.Nor does the 1950 Chapman Line reflect a "firm and continuing" policy of enclosing waters behind fringing islandsas "inland waters." The Chapman Line may be consistent
with such a policy, but as the Master noted, no contemporaneous document explains the theory behind the Chapman
Line in terms of a simple 10-mile rule. Report 85-88. Indeed, a 1950 draft memorandum from the State Department
Geographer to the Justice Department opined that Chandeleur and Breton Sounds should be treated as inland waters
not only because they were screened by a chain of islands
that were less than 10 miles apart, but also because they
were "not extensively traversed by foreign vessels" and because the islands covered "more than half the total arc of the
territorial sea." U. S. Exh. 85-400. These criteria go far
beyond the simple 10-mile rule, and Alaska does not show
how they would apply to Stefansson Sound. Finally, statements in the briefs filed by the United States in litigation
with the Gulf States that certain waters behind offshore islands were inland waters do not explicitly rely on a 10-mile
rule. Moreover, in our decision in United States v. Louisiana, 363 U. S. 1, 67, n. 108 (1960), we made clear that we did
not take the Government's concession that certain islands off
Louisiana's shore enclosed inland waters "to settle the location of the coastline of Louisiana or that of any other State."

These and other documents considered by the Master support his conclusion that Alaska has not identified a firm and
continuing 10-mile rule that would clearly require treating
the waters of Stefansson Sound as inland waters at the time

of Alaska's statehood. Indeed, we note that the resultAlaska seeks would be in tension with the outcome of the

Massachusetts Boundary Case, 475 U. S. 89 (1986), where, ayear after deciding the Alabama and Mississippi Boundary
Case, we concluded that the waters of Nantucket Sound arenot inland waters. Following the Court's decision in the
Alabama and Mississippi Boundary Case, Massachusettsargued that a 10-mile rule would make the waters of Nantucket Sound inland waters. The Master in that case recog-nized that no entrance between the islands enclosing Nantucket Sound exceeded 10 miles, but nevertheless concludedthat Massachusetts had not shown that the waters of Nantucket Sound were inland waters. Report of Special Masterin Massachusetts Boundary Case, O. T. 1984, No. 35 Orig.,
pp. 69.2-70. We rejected the Commonwealth's claim to in-land waters status for Nantucket Sound, framed in its exception to the Master's recommendation as an "ancient title"claim. Massachusetts Boundary Case, supra, at 105. If
the case could have been resolved by reference to a simple10-mile rule for all fringing islands, we need not have entertained such a claim. D

In sum, we conclude that Alaska's entitlement to sub-merged lands along its Arctic Coast must be determined by
applying the Convention's normal baseline principles. The
Alabama and Mississippi Boundary Case does not foreclosethis conclusion. The sources before the Master showed that,

in its foreign relations, particularly in the period 1930 to1949, the United States had advocated a rule under which
objectionable pockets of high seas would be assimilated to acoastal nation's territorial sea. Such a rule would have been
inconsistent with the maintenance of a 10-mile rule for fring-ing islands. The United States also advocated a rule for
treating the waters of a strait leading to an inland sea asinland waters, but that rule is not equivalent to Alaska's simple 10-mile rule. Whether the waters of Stefansson Sound

Opinion of the Court
would be considered inland waters under the 1930 proposalfor straits is unclear.

Accordingly, we overrule Alaska's first exception.

III
Alaska next excepts to the Master's conclusion that a smallgravel and ice formation in the Flaxman Island chain, known

as Dinkum Sands, is not an island. Whether Dinkum Sandsis an island affects Alaska's ownership of offshore submerged
lands in the feature's vicinity.As discussed above, a State's coastline provides the starting point for measuring its 3-mile Submerged Lands Actgrant. See 43 U. S. C. $$ 1301(a)(2), 1311(a). Generally, the
State's coastline corresponds to a "baseline" from which,under the 1958 Convention, the United States measures
its territorial sea for international purposes. Supra, at 8.Article 10(1) of the Convention defines an island as "a
naturally-formed area of land, surrounded by water, whichis above water at high-tide." A line of ordinary low water
along the coast of an island can serve as a baseline for mea-suring the territorial sea. See Arts. 10(2), 3. The Convention also permits a nation to claim a belt of territorial seaaround certain features that are not above water at high tide,
so long as they are located wholly or partly within the terri-torial sea belt of the mainland or an island. Arts. 11(1)-(2).
Again, for purposes of determining a State's ownershiprights under the Submerged Lands Act, we are concerned
with a 3-mile belt of the territorial sea. See supra, at 8-9.Because Dinkum Sands is not within three miles of the nearest islands or the mainland, it does not meet the require-ments of Article 11. Accordingly, Dinkum Sands has its own
belt of territorial sea--and Alaska owns submerged landsbeneath that belt--only if Dinkum Sands satisfies the requirements of Article 10(1).The issue here has been narrowed to whether Dinkum
Sands is "above water at high-tide." Dinkum Sands has fre521US1 Unit: $U74 [11-17-99 14:25:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
quently been submerged. Apart from daily shifts in thetide and seasonal shifts in sea level, the feature itself changes

height. Report 275, 280-283, 309, n. 66. This phenomenonmay be at least in part attributable to what the United
States' expert witness termed "ice collapse." Dinkum
Sands is formed by layers of ice and gravel mixed with ice.As the summer months approach, ice within Dinkum Sands

melts and the feature slumps in elevation. 7 Tr. 986-987,8 Tr. 1060-1062 (July 23, 1984).

Alaska and the United States agree that "high-tide" underArticle 10(1) should be defined as "mean high water," an
average measure of high water over a 19-year period. Cf.
United States v. California, 382 U. S. 448, 449-450 (1966)
(per curiam) (entering decree defining an island as "above
the level of mean high water" and defining mean high water
as "the average elevation of all the high tides occurring over
a period of 18.6 years"); Borax Consol., Ltd. v. Los Angeles,
296 U. S. 10, 26-27 (1935) (approving definition of "mean high
tide line" based on "average height of all the high waters . . .
over a considerable period of time," at least 18.6 years).
They disagree over how frequently a feature of variable elevation such as Dinkum Sands must be above mean high
water to qualify as an island. Based on the drafting history
of Article 10, the Master concluded that an island must "generally," "normally," or "usually" be above mean high water.
Report 302. Applying this standard, the Master reviewed
historical hydrographic and cartographic evidence and the
results of a joint monitoring project conducted by the parties in 1981 and 1982. He concluded that Dinkum Sands is
frequently below mean high water and therefore is not an
island. Id., at 310.

Alaska excepts to this conclusion on three grounds. First,
Alaska challenges the legal conclusion that Article 10(1)
requires an island to be above mean high water at least "generally," "normally," or "usually." Second, Alaska disputes
the Master's factual finding that Dinkum Sands is fre521US1 Unit: $U74 [11-17-99 14:25:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN
24 UNITED STATES v. ALASKA

Opinion of the Court
quently below mean high water. Finally, Alaska argues thatDinkum Sands should be treated as an island when it is in

fact above mean high water. We find no error in the Mas-ter's conclusion.

A
In the proceedings before the Master, the United Statestook the position that an island must be "permanently" above

mean high water, Brief for United States on Dinkum Sands17-29, while Alaska argued that Article 10 permits a feature
"to slump on occasion below" mean high water but still qual-ify as an island, Brief for Alaska on Dinkum Sands 64. The
Master essentially rejected the United States' position infavor of a somewhat more lenient standard, under which an
island must "generally," "normally," or "usually" be abovemean high water. Although Alaska now objects to this
standard, Alaska Exceptions Brief 44-45, 51, it sets forth noclear alternative. Alaska's observation that "an island that
is occasionally submerged is no less an island," id., at 45, isnot inconsistent with the Master's approach.

If Alaska is now implicitly claiming that a feature needappear only episodically above mean high water to qualify as
an island, its position is without merit. Because Article10(1) does not specify how frequently a feature must be
above mean high water to qualify as an island, we must lookto the Convention's drafting history for guidance. See Louisiana Boundary Case, 394 U. S., at 42-47. In urging thatthe Master's interpretation of Article 10(1) is inconsistent
with the development of that provision, Alaska focuses onthe fact that earlier drafts specified that an island must be
"permanently above high-water mark." Report 297 (citing
J. Franc,ois, Report on the Re' gime of the Territorial Sea,[1952] 2 Y. B. Int'l L. Comm'n 25, 36, U. N. Doc. A/CN.4/53

(in French; translation from Alaska Exh. 84A-21, p. 41)); seeAlaska Exceptions Brief 50. The eventual deletion of the
modifier "permanently," in Alaska's view, suggests that Arti521US1 Unit: $U74 [11-17-99 14:25:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN

25Cite as: 521 U. S. 1 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
cle 10(1) contains no implicit modifier at all, such as "generally," "normally," or "usually."

Alaska's reading of Article 10(1)'s drafting history is selective. In fact, the drafting history supports a standard at
least as stringent as that adopted by the Master. The provision was first introduced at the League of Nations Conference for the Codification of International Law, held at The
Hague in 1930. A preparatory committee offered the following as a basis for discussion: "In order that an island may
have its own territorial waters, it is necessary that it should
be permanently above the level of high tide." 2 Conference
for the Codification of International Law, Bases of Discussion, Territorial Waters 54 (1929). A subcommittee revised
the definition but retained the element of permanence: "An
island is an area of land, surrounded by water, which is permanently above high-water mark." 3 Acts of the Conference 219. When the International Law Commission of the
United Nations revived the work of the Conference in 1951,
a special rapporteur reintroduced the subcommittee's definition. Report 297.

In 1954, the British delegate proposed adding the modifier
"in normal circumstances," so that an island's status would
not be questioned because it was temporarily submerged at
high tide in an "exceptional cas[e]." See Summary Records
of the 260th Meeting, [1954] 1 Y. B. Int'l L. Comm'n 92. The
Commission adopted that proposal, id., at 94, and in its final
report defined an island as "an area of land, surrounded by
water, which in normal circumstances is permanently above
high-water mark," Report of the International Law Commission to the General Assembly, Art. 10, U. N. Gen. Ass. Off.
Rec., 11th Sess., Supp. No. 9, U. N. Doc. A/3159, p. 16 (1956).

In 1957, an internal State Department memorandum evaluating the Commission's work suggested that the words
"permanently" and "in normal circumstances" appeared to
be inconsistent and could both be omitted, because "current

Opinion of the Court
international law does not purport to solve such minor prob-lems" as how to treat formations that would be submerged

at unusually high states of high tide. Alaska Exh. 84A-21(Memorandum from Benjamin H. Read, Islands, Drying
Rocks and Drying Shoals, Sept. 1957, p. 11). The United
States presented that position at the 1958 United NationsConference on the Law of the Sea, arguing that "there is no

established state practice regarding the effect of subnormalor abnormal or seasonal tidal action on the status of islands."
3 United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, OfficialRecords: First Committee (Territorial Sea and Contiguous
Zone), Summary Records of Meetings and Annexes, U. N.
Doc. A/CONF.13/C1. /L.112, p. 242 (1958). The Conference
adopted the United States' recommendation, and excised the
words "permanently" and "in normal circumstances" from
the definition of an island.

As the Master recognized, in including the phrase "in normal circumstances," the Convention's drafters had sought to
accommodate abnormal events that would cause temporary
inundation of a feature otherwise qualifying as an island.
Report 300. The United States' view that the international
definition of an island need not address abnormal or seasonal
tidal activity ultimately prevailed. But the change from the
Commission's draft to the final language of the Convention
did not signal an intent to cover features that are only sometimes or occasionally above high tide. In fact, the problem
of abnormal or seasonal tidal activity that the 1954 amendment addressed is fully solved by the United States' practice
of construing "high tide" to mean "mean high water." Averaging high waters over a 19-year period accounts for periodic
variations attributable to astronomic forces; nonperiodic, meteorological variations can be assumed to balance out over
this length of time. See 2 A. Shalowitz, Shore and Sea
Boundaries 58-59 (1964). Accordingly, even if a feature
would be submerged at the highest monthly tides during a
particular season or in unusual weather, the feature might

27Cite as: 521 U. S. 1 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
still be above "mean high water" and therefore qualify asan island.

What Alaska seeks is insular status not for a feature thatis submerged at abnormally high states of tide, but for a
feature that rises above and falls below mean high water--a tidal datum that has already accounted for the tidal abnormalities about which the drafters of Article 10(1) were con-cerned. Even if Article 10(1)'s drafting history could support insular status for a feature that slumps below mean highwater because of an

abnormal change in elevation, it doesnot support insular status for a feature that exhibits a pattern of slumping below mean high water because of seasonalchanges in elevation. Alaska nevertheless contends that
there is support for according island status to features more"ephemera[l]" than Dinkum Sands. See Alaska Exceptions
Brief 45-50. The authorities Alaska cites all predate theConvention and are therefore unhelpful in construing Article
10(1). Alaska also relies on an analogy to the "mudlumps"of the Mississippi delta, features whose status under the
Convention has never been determined. See Report of Spe-cial Master in United States v. Louisiana, O. T. 1974, No. 9
Orig., p. 4 (filed July 31, 1974) (concluding that Louisiana'sSubmerged Lands Act grant could be measured from two
mudlumps, but not deciding whether the mudlumps were is-lands under Article 10(1) or low-tide elevations under Article
11(1)); United States v. Louisiana, 420 U. S. 529 (1975) (over-ruling exceptions).

In sum, the Convention's drafting history suggests that, toqualify as an island, a feature must be above high water except in abnormal circumstances. Alaska identifies no basisfor according insular status to a feature that is frequently
below mean high water. B

In disputing the Master's factual conclusion that DinkumSands is "frequently below mean high water," Report 39,
Alaska relies on three cartographic sources. First, two nau521US1 Unit: $U74 [11-17-99 14:25:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN
28 UNITED STATES v. ALASKA

Opinion of the Court
tical charts produced following a 1949-1950 survey of theBeaufort Sea by a United States Coast and Geodetic Survey

party depict Dinkum Sands as an island, consistent with asurvey note describing a "new gravel bar baring about three
feet" at mean high water. Alaska Exh. 84A-203 (U. S. Coast
and Geodetic Survey, Descriptive Report to Accompany Hy-drographic Survey H-7761, p. 3); see Alaska Exh. 84A-202

(U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, Addendum to DescriptiveReport to Accompany Hydrographic Survey H-7760, p. 4).
Second, in 1971, an ad hoc interagency group known as theBaseline Committee, charged with delimiting the United
States' coastline, produced baseline charts treating Dinkum
Sands as an island. Third, a 1979 map developed for a joint
federal-state oil and gas lease sale in the Prudhoe Bay area
assigned ownership of a 3-mile belt of territorial sea around
Dinkum Sands to Alaska.

As Alaska appears to acknowledge, see Alaska Exceptions
Brief 53, the 1971 baseline chart and the 1979 leasing map
were based on the 1949-1950 survey rather than independent observations. In 1956, the United States Coast and
Geodetic Survey resumed charting Dinkum Sands as a lowtide elevation, based on observations of a Navy vessel made
the prior year. It is undisputed that one of the members of
the Baseline Committee persuaded the Committee to treat
Dinkum Sands as an island based solely on his personal observation of Dinkum Sands as a member of the 1949-1950
survey party. See Alaska Exh. 84A-207 (Department of
State, Memorandum to Members of the Baseline Committee,
Minutes of Oct. 10, 1979, Meeting, p. 2) (noting that the Committee "has used Dinkum Sands as a basepoint for determining the breadth of the territorial sea . . . because early surveys showed Dinkum Sands to be above high water and
Admiral Nygren had personally observed it above high
water"). The 1979 leasing map relied on the 1971 baseline
chart in assigning Dinkum Sands its own 3-mile belt of territorial sea.

Opinion of the Court
The question, then, is whether the 1949-1950 survey par-ty's conclusion that Dinkum Sands is three feet above mean

high water, taken together with visual observations ofDinkum Sands above water, undermines the Master's factual
finding that Dinkum Sands is "frequently below mean high
water." Report 309. It does not.Alaska emphasizes that Dinkum Sands has been observed

"many times . . . above water" and only "occasionally . . .submerged." Alaska Exceptions Brief 44. But visual observations of Dinkum Sands are not dispositive; the questionis not whether Dinkum Sands is above or below high tide on
any given day, but where the feature lies in relation to mean
high water. To address precisely this problem, the parties
jointly commissioned a $2.5 million study to calculate mean
high water in the feature's vicinity and to determine the feature's elevation in relation to that datum. First, using a
year of tidal readings, the National Ocean Survey computed
a mean high-water datum at Dinkum Sands and calculated
an error band to account for the fact that the level would
ordinarily be based on 19 years of readings. Second, an engineering firm measured Dinkum Sands' highest points in
March, June, and August 1981.

Comparing the feature's highest elevation measurements
to the mean high-water level, the Master found that Dinkum
Sands was not above mean high water at any time it was
surveyed. The two highest points of the survey were
within the error band for the mean high-water level, but the
Master found this fact to be of little weight because the
measurements were likely taken from piles of gravel disturbed by the March measurements, rather than from
Dinkum Sands' true highest points. Alaska continued to
measure Dinkum Sands in relation to mean high water in
1982 and 1983. The feature was found to be above mean
high water on a visit in July 1982. By September, the feature had fallen in elevation, possibly by more than a foot, see
Report 281-282, placing it below the mean high-water datum.

30 UNITED STATES v. ALASKA

Opinion of the Court
Between May and July 1983, the feature was observed abovewater several times, although its elevation in relation to

mean high water was not known. Based on two helicopterobservations of the feature and estimates of sea level in relation to mean high water, the Master concluded that Dinkum
Sands could have been above high water by a matter ofinches in September 1983. The Master found that the feature was "consistently" below mean high water in 1981 andbelow mean high water by September--the end of the open
water season--in both 1981 and 1982. Id., at 309. Relyinglargely on the 1981-1983 data, the Master concluded that
Dinkum Sands is not an island.

Alaska makes no mention of the 1981 joint monitoring
project. The Master discussed the State's methodological
objections to the results at length, see id., at 255-269, and
we see no reason to revisit the Master's conclusion that those
objections are unpersuasive. Alaska does not explain why
the Master should have relied on a single August 1949 measurement of Dinkum Sands' elevation in relation to mean high
water rather than on the exhaustive survey expressly designed to determine Dinkum Sands' status under Article
10(1) of the Convention. In contending that Dinkum Sands
has been above mean high water except on a "handful of
occasions," Alaska recognizes that Dinkum Sands slumps in
elevation during the open water season between late July
and September. Alaska Exceptions Brief 54. Alaska suggests that natural processes build up Dinkum Sands "just . . .
prior to the autumn freeze-up," and that the feature then
remains above mean high water for 9 to 10 months of the
year. See ibid. There is no basis in the record, however,
for concluding that Dinkum Sands is above mean high
water during the winter months. During the winter, the
area is completely covered by pack ice. The sole measurement of the feature's elevation during the winter was that
taken in March 1981, and it was then below mean high water.
Report 286. But even if the record demonstrated that the

Opinion of the Court
feature remained above mean high water until "ice collapse"caused it to slump, that would not compel a ruling in Alaska's

favor. Although Article 10(1)'s drafting history may sug-gest that a feature submerged at abnormally high tides does
not lose its insular status, it does not support the broaderconclusion that a feature with a

seasonal loss in elevation,bringing it below mean high water, qualifies as an island.

See supra, at 27.In sum, we find no error in the Master's conclusion that
Dinkum Sands is frequently below mean high water andtherefore does not meet the standard for an island.

C
Alaska finally urges a compromise resolution, under whichDinkum Sands would be deemed an island when above mean

high water. Alaska attempts to find support for its positionin this Court's recognition in prior cases of the concept of an
"ambulatory coast line." Alaska Exceptions Brief 55. Inadopting the 1958 Convention to aid interpretation of the
Submerged Lands Act, we recognized that the Conventiontreats a nation's coastline as its modern, ambulatory coastline. See United States v. Louisiana, 394 U. S. 1, 5 (1969)
(Texas Boundary Case); Louisiana Boundary Case, 394U. S., at 32-34. Shifts in a low-water line along the shore,

we acknowledged, could lead to a shift in the baseline formeasuring a maritime zone for international purposes. In
turn, the State's entitlement to submerged lands beneath theterritorial sea would change.

An island may very well have its own ambulatory coast-line. What Alaska seeks here, however, is not an entitlement to submerged lands seaward of a gradually accretingor eroding shore. Rather, Alaska's ownership of submerged
lands around Dinkum Sands would appear and disappear pe-riodically, depending upon whether the feature was above or
below mean high water. Not only does Article 10(1) of theConvention not support such a reading, but Alaska's position

521US1 Unit: $U74 [11-17-99 14:25:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN
32 UNITED STATES v. ALASKA

Opinion of the Court
makes a sensible application of other provisions of the Con-vention impossible. The Convention separately categorizes

features that are below mean high water, but above waterat low tide. See Art. 11. In addition, under Articles 10(2)
and 3, an island's belt of territorial sea is measured from theline of low water. As Dinkum Sands' elevation shifts and
the feature slumps toward the mean high-water datum,below the mean high-water datum, and possibly below the
low-water datum, the baseline for measuring the surround-ing maritime zone would shift and then disappear. Quite
apart from the fact that Alaska's proposal would lead tocostly and time-consuming monitoring efforts, we agree with
the Master that Alaska has identified no precedent for treat-ing as an island a feature that oscillates above and below
mean high water. IV

Alaska's third exception concerns the ownership of sub-merged lands within the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska
(Reserve), a 23-million acre federal reservation in the north-western part of the State. The Reserve's seaward boundary
runs along the Arctic Ocean from Icy Cape at the west to themouth of the Colville River at the east. When this litigation
began, Alaska and the United States disputed the location ofthe Reserve's boundary, focusing in particular on whether
the boundary followed the sinuosities of the coast or insteadcut across certain inlets, bays, and river estuaries. Alaska
initially conceded federal ownership of submerged landswithin that boundary. In light of this Court's decision in
Montana v. United States, 450 U. S. 544 (1981), and with theconsent of the United States, the Special Master granted
Alaska relief from its concession, and Alaska claimed owner-ship of submerged lands beneath certain coastal features
within the Reserve's boundaries. Order of Special Masterin United States v. Alaska, O. T. 1983, No. 84 Orig. (Jan. 4,

Opinion of the Court
Federal District Court, Alaska v. United States, Nos. A83-343, A84-435, A86-191 (D. Alaska), and has been stayed until

resolution of the present case, see Report 347, n. 4.The parties no longer dispute the location of the Reserve's
boundary. Accordingly, we consider only the Master's rec-ommendation concerning the ownership of submerged lands
beneath certain coastal features within that boundary. TheMaster concluded that the United States retained ownership
of the submerged lands in question at Alaska's statehood.That conclusion rested principally on three premises: first,
that the United States can prevent lands beneath navigablewaters from passing to a State upon admission to the Union
by reserving those lands in federal ownership (as opposed toconveying them to a third party); second, that Congress had
authorized the President to reserve submerged lands with a1910 statute known as the Pickett Act; and third, that the
1923 Executive Order creating the Reserve reflected a clearintent to reserve all submerged lands within the boundaries
of the Reserve and to defeat the State's title to the sub-merged lands in question. Alaska excepts to the Master's
conclusion on several grounds, arguing that the Governmentdid not show a sufficiently clear intent to reserve submerged
lands or to defeat state title and that the 1923 ExecutiveOrder was promulgated without proper authority. We discuss some background principles and then consider thesearguments in turn.

A
The Property Clause, Art. IV, $ 3, cl. 2, provides that "Con-gress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful

Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or otherProperty belonging to the United States." In

Shively v.Bowlby, 152 U. S. 1, 48 (1894), the Court concluded that this

power extended to granting submerged lands to private par-ties, and thereby defeating a future State's equal footing
title, "to carry out . . . public purposes appropriate to theobjects for which the United States hold the Territory." We

34 UNITED STATES v. ALASKA

Opinion of the Court
agree with the Special Master that Congress can also reservesubmerged lands under federal control for an appropriate

public purpose, and thus resolve a question left open in Utah
Div. of State Lands, 482 U. S., at 201, in the United States'
favor.

As drawn by the Master, the boundary of the Reserve en-compasses both those lands that would ordinarily pass to

Alaska under the equal footing doctrine--that is, tidelandsand submerged lands beneath inland navigable waters--and
those lands that would pass to Alaska only by virtue of theSubmerged Lands Act--that is, lands beneath the 3-mile territorial sea. As a result, the parties dispute the principles
governing ownership of the submerged lands.

Under our equal footing cases, "[a] court deciding a question of title to the bed of navigable water must . . . begin
with a strong presumption" against defeat of a State's title.
Montana, supra, at 552; see Utah Div. of State Lands,
supra, at 197-198. We will not infer an intent to defeat a
future State's title to inland submerged lands "unless the
intention was definitely declared or otherwise made very
plain." United States v. Holt State Bank, 270 U. S. 49, 55
(1926). The United States argues that the presumption
against defeat of state title does not apply to lands passing
solely under the Submerged Lands Act--that is, lands beneath the territorial sea--over which the United States has
paramount authority: Any grant of such lands is to be " `construed strictly in favor of the United States.' " United
States Opposition Brief 53 (quoting California ex rel. State
Lands Comm'n, 457 U. S., at 287). The Master agreed with
the Government's approach, concluding that the United
States can demonstrate that it retained title to submerged
lands beneath the territorial sea under a "less demanding
standard" than our equal footing cases require. Report 394.
Nevertheless, the Master analyzed the withdrawal under the
"stricter" standards of Utah Div. of State Lands and Montana, reasoning that the less demanding test for lands be521US1 Unit: $U74 [11-17-99 14:25:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN

35Cite as: 521 U. S. 1 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
neath the territorial sea would be relevant only if the UnitedStates failed to satisfy the more stringent test. Report 394.

Neither the Submerged Lands Act itself nor our case lawsupports the United States' approach. The Submerged
Lands Act grants States submerged lands beneath a 3-mile
belt of the territorial sea. The statute is a grant of federalproperty, and the scope of that grant must be construed

strictly in the United States' favor. But that principle doesnot permit us to ignore the statute's terms, which provide
that a State receives title to submerged lands beneath theterritorial sea unless the United States "

expressly retain[s]"
them. 43 U. S. C. $ 1313(a) (emphasis added). We cannot
resolve "doubts" about whether the United States has withheld state title to submerged lands beneath the territorial
sea in the United States' favor, for doing so would require
us to find an "express" retention of submerged lands where
none exists. The Submerged Lands Act does not call into
question cases holding that the United States has paramount
sovereign authority over submerged lands beneath the territorial sea. See California I, 332 U. S., at 35-36; United
States v. Louisiana, 339 U. S. 699, 704 (1950); United States
v. Texas, 339 U. S. 707, 719 (1950). But Congress has chosen
to exercise that authority by presumptively granting those
lands to the States, unless the United States has "expressly
retained" submerged lands.

Reinforcing this reading of the Act is the fact that the
Act's terms reach lands governed by the equal footing doctrine as well as lands beneath the territorial sea. Under the
terms of the statute, equal footing lands, like those beneath
the territorial sea, pass to a State unless the United States
"expressly retained" them. In passing the Act, Congress
would have legislated against the backdrop of our early equal
footing cases. See Montana, 450 U. S., at 552, n. 2. There
is no indication that, in formulating the "expressly retained"
standard, Congress intended to upset settled doctrine and to
impose on the Federal Government a more or less demanding

standard than the one reflected in those cases, see, e. g., HoltState Bank, supra, at 55 (holding that intent to defeat state

title to submerged lands must be "definitely declared or oth-erwise made very plain"), and carried forward in Montana
and Utah Div. of State Lands. Whether title to submergedlands rests with a State, of course, is ultimately a matter
of federal intent. In construing a single federal instrumentcreating a reserve, we see no reason to apply the phrase
"expressly retained" differently depending upon whether thelands in question would pass to a State by virtue of a statutory grant or by virtue of the equal footing doctrine, as con-firmed by statute.

Applying Montana and Utah Div. of State Lands, then,we must ask whether the United States intended to include
submerged lands within the Reserve and to defeat Alaska'stitle to those lands.

President Harding created the National Petroleum Re-serve by Executive Order in 1923. The order described a

boundary following the Arctic "coast line," measured along"the ocean side of the sandspits and islands forming the barrier reefs and extending across small lagoons from point topoint, where such barrier reefs are not over three miles off
shore." Exec. Order No. 3797-A, in Presidential ExecutiveOrders (1980) (microform, reel 6). Because the boundary
follows the ocean side of the islands, the Reserve necessarilyincludes tidelands landward of the islands. The Reserve
also contains coastal features, including "small lagoons" (towhich the Order explicitly refers) and the mouths of rivers
and bays (which the Master concluded were within the Re-serve's boundary). Report 381. Alaska argues that the
fact that the United States included certain water areaswithin the exterior boundaries of the Reserve does not necessarily mean that the United States clearly intended to re521US1 Unit: $U74 [11-17-99 14:25:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
serve the submerged lands beneath those waters. Alaska
Exceptions Brief 62. In support of this proposition, Alaska
points primarily to our decisions in Montana, supra, at 554,
and Utah Div. of State Lands, 482 U. S., at 202.

In Montana, the United States, as trustee for the Crow
Tribe, sought a declaratory judgment that it owned the
riverbed of the Big Horn River and had conveyed a beneficial
interest in the submerged lands to the Tribe. The river was
located inside the boundaries of the Crow Reservation established by treaty in 1868, but the treaty did not expressly
refer to the riverbed. 450 U. S., at 548, 554. Applying the
"strong presumption against conveyance by the United
States" to defeat a State's title, id., at 552, we concluded that
the "mere fact that the bed of a navigable water lies within
the boundaries described in the treaty does not make the
riverbed part of the conveyed land, especially when there is
no express reference to the riverbed that might overcome
the presumption against its conveyance," id., at 554. Even
though creation of an Indian reservation could be an "appropriate public purpose" justifying a conveyance of submerged
lands, a conveyance of submerged lands beneath the river
would not have been necessary for the Government's purpose, because fishing was not important to the Crow Tribe's
way of life. Id., at 556.

In Utah Div. of State Lands, the Court found that the
United States had not prevented the bed of Utah Lake from
passing to Utah at statehood. The Sundry Appropriations
Act of 1888, 25 Stat. 505, authorized the United States Geological Survey to select "sites for reservoirs and other hydraulic works necessary for the storage and utilization of
water for irrigation and the prevention of floods and overflows." Id., at 526. The Survey selected Utah Lake as a
reservoir site. 482 U. S., at 199. In 1890, when Congress
repealed the 1888 Act, it provided "that reservoir sites heretofore located or selected shall remain segregated and re521US1 Unit: $U74 [11-17-99 14:25:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
served from entry or settlement as provided by [the 1888Act]." Sundry Appropriations Act of 1890, 26 Stat. 391.

In concluding that the 1888 Act did not reflect a clear in-tent to include submerged lands within lands reserved for
reservoir sites, the Court focused in part on the fact that the
Act was motivated by concerns that settlers would claimlands suitable for reservoir sites or other reclamation efforts.

482 U. S., at 198, 203. These concerns of "monopolizationand speculation" "had nothing to do with the beds of navigable rivers and lakes." Id., at 203. Moreover, the Govern-ment's ability to control and develop navigable waters would
not be impaired if the land beneath the navigable waters
passed to the State. Id., at 202; see also Arizona v. California, 373 U. S. 546, 597-598 (1963); Arizona v. California, 283
U. S. 423, 451-452, 457 (1931). We also considered whether
certain references to the bed of Utah Lake in reports by the
Geological Survey, coupled with the 1890 Act's requirement
that selected sites remain segregated, accomplished a reservation of the lake bed. We concluded that the references to
the lake bed in the Survey documents, when placed in proper
context, did not indicate that the bed was included within
the reservation. Utah Div. of State Lands, supra, at 206.
Finally, we held that even if the 1888 or 1890 Acts reflected a
clear intent to include submerged lands within a reservation,
there was no evidence that the United States intended to
defeat future States' entitlement to any land reserved.
Again, our analysis focused on the fact that the transfer of
title to the lake bed would not prevent the Government from
developing a reservoir or water reclamation project at the
lake. Id., at 208.

Montana and Utah Div. of State Lands establish that the
fact that navigable waters are within the boundaries of a
conveyance or reservation does not in itself mean that submerged lands beneath those waters were conveyed or reserved. But Alaska's reliance on these cases is misplaced
for two reasons. First, the Executive Order of 1923 does

521US1 Unit: $U74 [11-17-99 14:25:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN

39Cite as: 521 U. S. 1 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
not merely define a boundary that encloses a body of naviga-ble water. Rather, in describing a boundary following the

ocean side of offshore islands and reefs, the Order createda Reserve that necessarily embraced certain submerged
lands--specifically, tidelands shoreward of the barrier is-lands.

1 Second, Montana and Utah Div. of State Lands establish that the purpose of a conveyance or reservation isa critical factor in determining federal intent. See also

Alaska Pacific Fisheries v. United States, 248 U. S. 78, 87-89(1918) (reservation of "body of lands" in southeastern Alaska
for Metlakahtla Indians included adjacent waters and sub-merged lands, because fishing was necessary for Indians'
subsistence). The Executive Order of 1923 sought to retainfederal ownership of land containing oil deposits. The
Order recited that "there are large seepages of petroleumalong the Arctic Coast of Alaska and conditions favorable to
the occurrence of valuable petroleum fields on the ArcticCoast," and described the goal of securing a supply of oil
for the Navy as "at all times a matter of national concern."Petroleum resources exist in subsurface formations necessarily extending beneath submerged lands and uplands. The
purpose of reserving in federal ownership all oil and gasdeposits within the Reserve's boundaries would have been

undermined if those deposits underlying lagoons and othertidally influenced waters had been excluded. It is simply

1 In light of the fact that the Order necessarily encompasses tidelands,
the partial dissent's conclusion that the United States owns no submerged
lands within the Reserve is puzzling. The dissent suggests that the
United States retains submerged lands only if the relevant instrument
" `in terms embraces the land under the waters.' " Post, at 66 (Thomas,
J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (quoting Packer v. Bird, 137
U. S. 661, 672 (1891)). By its terms, the Executive Order of 1923 certainly
embraces all tidelands landward of the barrier islands. Accordingly, even
if the dissent were correct that a federal intent to retain submerged lands
can never be inferred, no inference is required for the conclusion that,
at the very least, the United States retained the tidelands within the
Reserve.

521US1 Unit: $U74 [11-17-99 14:25:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN
40 UNITED STATES v. ALASKA

Opinion of the Court
not plausible that the United States sought to reserve onlythe upland portions of the area.

Alaska also argues that any inclusion of submerged landswithin the Reserve was not supported by an appropriate
public purpose. Specifically, Alaska claims that only a "public exigency" or "international duty" will support a reserva-tion of submerged lands. In

Shively, the Court recognized
a general congressional policy of granting away land beneathnavigable waters only "in case of some international duty or

public exigency," 152 U. S., at 50. But that is a congres-sional policy, not a constitutional obligation.

Utah Div. of
State Lands, 482 U. S., at 197. The only constitutional limitation on a conveyance or reservation of submerged lands
is that it serve an appropriate public purpose: The United
States has the power to dispose of submerged lands in prestatehood territories " `in order to perform international
obligations, or to effect the improvement of such lands for
the promotion and convenience of commerce with foreign
nations and among the several States, or to carry out other
public purposes appropriate to the objects for which the
United States hold the Territory.' " Id., at 196-197 (emphasis added) (quoting Shively, supra, at 48). There is no
question that, as the Master concluded, the inclusion of
submerged lands within the Reserve fulfilled an appropriate
public purpose--namely, securing an oil supply for the national defense.

In sum, the 1923 Executive Order creating the Reserve
reflects a clear intent to include submerged lands within the
Reserve. The boundary by its terms embraces certain
coastal features, and the Master interpreted it to embrace
others. In light of the purpose of the Reserve, it is simply
not plausible that the Order was intended to exclude submerged lands, and thereby to forfeit ownership of valuable
petroleum resources beneath those lands. The importance
of submerged lands to the United States' goal of securing a
supply of oil distinguishes this case from Montana and Utah

Opinion of the Court
Div. of State Lands, where the disputed submerged lands
were unnecessary for achieving the federal objectives.

2
Under Utah Div. of State Lands, we must ask not only
whether the United States intended a reservation to include
submerged lands, but also whether the United States intended to defeat a future State's title to those lands. The
Master found that Congress expressed a clear intent to defeat state title in $ 11(b) of the Alaska Statehood Act. Pub.
L. 85-508, 72 Stat. 347. That section provides that the
United States has the "power of exclusive legislation . . . as
provided by [the Enclave Clause of the Constitution, Art. I,

$ 8, cl. 17,] over such tracts or parcels of land as, immediately
prior to the admission of said State, are owned by the United
States and held for military . . . purposes, including naval
petroleum reserve numbered 4 [the National Petroleum Reserve]." The Master concluded that $ 11(b), "in referring

to the Reserve as `owned by the United States,' clearly contemplate[d] continued federal ownership of the Reserve."
Report 433.

Alaska argues that $ 11(b)'s reference to exclusive federal
legislative authority over the Reserve under the Enclave
Clause says nothing about United States' title to submerged
lands within the Reserve. Alaska suggests that the United
States need not own all lands within a military area to exercise jurisdiction, and Congress "had no reason to defeat
State title to submerged lands [since] it always retains plenary authority to regulate navigable waters for defense purposes." Alaska Exceptions Brief 64. Alaska thus attempts
to align this case with Utah Div. of State Lands, where we
found no clear intent to defeat state title to the bed of Utah
Lake, in part because the United States need not have defeated state title to preserve its ability to develop a reservoir
or water reclamation project at the lake. 482 U. S., at 208.

521US1 Unit: $U74 [11-17-99 14:25:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN
42 UNITED STATES v. ALASKA

Opinion of the Court
Alaska's argument fails for several reasons. First, Alaskaignores the fact the Reserve was not created to preserve the

United States' "authority to regulate navigable waters fordefense purposes," but to preserve the Government's ability
to extract petroleum resources. Ownership may not be necessary for federal regulation of navigable waters, but it isnecessary to prevent the Reserve's petroleum resources from

being drained from beneath submerged lands. Second,when the United States exercises its power of "exclusive legislation" under the Enclave Clause, it necessarily acquirestitle to the property. See

James v. Dravo Contracting Co.,
302 U. S. 134, 141, 142 (1937) ("[The Enclave Clause] governs
those cases where the United States acquires lands with the
consent of the legislature of the State for the purposes there
described" (emphasis added)); see also Collins v. Yosemite
Park & Curry Co., 304 U. S. 518, 527 (1938). Third, Alaska's
argument that $ 11(b) of the Statehood Act says nothing
about federal ownership of the Reserve ignores the fact that,
on its face, $ 11(b) states that the United States "owned"
the Reserve.

As discussed supra, at 38-41, the Reserve included submerged lands. Section 11(b) thus reflects a clear congressional statement that the United States owned and would
continue to own submerged lands included within the Reserve. The conclusion that Congress was aware when it
passed the Alaska Statehood Act that the Reserve encompassed submerged lands is reinforced by other legislation,
enacted just before Alaska's admission to the Union, granting certain offshore lands to the Territory of Alaska. See
Pub. L. 85-303, $ 2(a), 71 Stat. 623. Congress expressly exempted from that grant "all oil and gas deposits located in
the submerged lands along the Arctic coast of naval petroleum reserve numbered 4 [the National Petroleum Reserve]." $ 3(d) (emphasis added). Moreover, in contrast to
Utah Div. of State Lands, defeating state title to submerged
lands was necessary to achieve the United States' objec521US1 Unit: $U74 [11-17-99 14:25:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN

43Cite as: 521 U. S. 1 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
tive--securing a supply of oil and gas that would necessarily
exist beneath uplands and submerged lands. The transfer
of submerged lands at statehood--and the loss of ownership
rights to the oil deposits beneath those lands--would have
thwarted that purpose.

C

Alaska argues that even if the 1923 Executive Order purported to include submerged lands within the Reserve for an
appropriate public purpose and even if $ 11(b) reflects a clear
intent to defeat state title to all lands within the Reserve,
title still passed to Alaska because the President lacked the
authority to include submerged lands within the Reserve.
Alaska Exceptions Brief 58-60. The argument is based in
part on Utah Div. of State Lands, where we referred to the
authority of Congress to dispose of property under the Property Clause, Art. IV, $ 3, cl. 2. Since Utah Div. of State
Lands concerned congressional enactments, it discloses little
about the circumstances under which action by the Executive will defeat a State's equal footing claim to submerged
lands.

As authority for inclusion of submerged lands within the
Reserve, the Master focused on the Act of June 25, 1910,
ch. 421, 36 Stat. 847, also known as the Pickett Act. The
Act stated:

"[T]he President may, at any time in his discretion, temporarily withdraw from settlement, location, sale, or
entry any of the public lands of the United States including the District of Alaska and reserve the same for
water-power sites, irrigation, classification of lands, or
other public purposes to be specified in the orders of
withdrawals, and such withdrawals or reservations shall
remain in force until revoked by him or by an Act of
Congress." $ 1, 36 Stat. 847 (repealed by the Federal
Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, Pub. L. 94-
579, $ 704(a), 90 Stat. 2792).

521US1 Unit: $U74 [11-17-99 14:25:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN
44 UNITED STATES v. ALASKA

Opinion of the Court
The Pickett Act nowhere specifically mentions submergedlands, and Alaska therefore challenges the Master's conclusion that the Pickett Act gave the President the express au-thority to dispose of them. Its argument rests mainly on
the proposition that the Pickett Act's reference to "withdraw[al]" of "public lands" cannot include submerged lands,because such lands are not subject to sale, settlement, or

entry under the general land laws and therefore need not be"withdrawn." Cf.

Utah Div. of State Lands, 482 U. S., at
203 (1888 Act stated that lands designated for reservoir siteswere " `reserved from sale as the property of the United

States, and shall not be subject . . . to entry, settlement or
occupation' "; rejecting claim that Act authorized inclusion of
submerged lands in part because such lands were already
exempt from sale, entry, or occupation); Mann v. Tacoma
Land Co., 153 U. S. 273, 284 (1894) ("[T]he general legislation
of Congress in respect to public lands does not extend to
tide lands"); Shively, 152 U. S., at 48 ("Congress has never
undertaken by general laws to dispose of " land under navigable waters).

Assuming, arguendo, that Alaska's construction of the
Pickett Act is correct, it does not control the outcome of this
case. We conclude that Congress ratified the terms of the
1923 Executive Order in $ 11(b) of the Statehood Act. Despite Alaska's protestations to the contrary, there would
have been no barrier to Congress retaining a petroleum reserve, including submerged lands, at the point of Alaska's
statehood, provided it satisfied Utah Div. of State Lands'
requirements of demonstrating a clear intent to include
submerged lands within the Reserve's scope and a clear intent to defeat Alaska's title. It follows that Congress could
achieve the same result by explicitly recognizing, at the point
of Alaska's statehood, an Executive reservation that clearly
included submerged lands. Cf. Utah Div. of State Lands,
supra, at 205-207 (examining United States' claim that references to the bed of Utah Lake made by the Geological

Opinion of the Court
Survey in reserving Utah Lake, taken together with 1890Act providing that reservoir sites selected by the Geological

Survey "shall remain segregated and reserved from entryor settlement," signaled Congress' ratification of the reservation of the lake bed; rejecting claim on the ground thatCongress was not on notice that the Geological Survey had
reserved the bed of the lake); Holden v. Joy, 17 Wall. 211,247 (1872) (rejecting Property Clause challenge to President's treaty with Cherokee Nation; although terms of treatyexceeded express delegation of authority by Congress to the
President, Congress had "repeatedly recognized" the validityof the treaty by enacting appropriation statutes). As discussed supra, at 38-41, the 1923 Executive Order reflected aclear intent to include submerged lands within the Reserve.
That instrument placed Congress on notice that the Presi-dent had construed his reservation authority to extend to
submerged lands and had exercised that authority to setaside uplands and submerged lands in the Reserve to secure
a source of oil for the Navy. Congress acknowledged theUnited States' ownership of and jurisdiction over the Reserve in $ 11(b) of the Statehood Act. Accordingly, Congressratified the inclusion of submerged lands within the Reserve,
whether or not it had intended the President's reservationauthority under the Pickett Act to extend to such lands.

D
In sum, we conclude that the United States retained own-ership of submerged lands beneath certain coastal features

within the Reserve at Alaska's statehood. Under the strictstandards of

Utah Div. of State Lands, the Executive Orderof 1923 reflected a clear intent to include submerged lands

within the Reserve. In addition to the fact that the Orderrefers to coastal features and necessarily covers the tidelands, excluding submerged lands beneath the coastal fea-tures would have been inconsistent with the purpose of the
Reserve--to secure a supply of oil that would necessarily

Opinion of the Court
exist beneath both submerged lands and uplands. Section11(b) of the Alaska Statehood Act, which noted that the

United States owned the Reserve and which included astatement of exclusive legislative jurisdiction under the Enclave Clause, reflects Congress' intent to ratify the inclusionof submerged lands within the Reserve and to defeat the
State's title to those lands. V

The United States excepts to the Master's conclusion thatsubmerged lands within a federal reservation in northeastern Alaska, now known as the Arctic National Wildlife Ref-uge, passed to Alaska upon its admission to the Union in
1959. In November 1957, the Department of the Interior'sBureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife submitted an application to the Secretary of the Interior for withdrawal of 8.9million acres of land "to establish an Arctic Wildlife Range
within all or such portion of the described lands as may befinally determined to be necessary for the preservation of
the wildlife and wilderness resources of that region of north-eastern Alaska." Alaska Exh. 81 (Application for Withdrawal by Public Land Order, p. 1). This application wasstill pending in July 1958, when Congress passed the Alaska
Statehood Act, and in January 1959, when Alaska was for-mally admitted to the Union. On December 6, 1960, the Secretary of the Interior issued Public Land Order 2214, which"reserved" the area "for use of the United States Fish and
Wildlife Service as the Arctic National Wildlife Range." 25Fed. Reg. 12598. In 1980, Congress expanded the Range
to include an additional 9.2 million acres and renamedit the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Pub. L. 96-487,

$ 303(2)(A), 94 Stat. 2390.Before the Master, the parties disputed whether the 1957
Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife application for with-drawal and creation of the Range--filed before but granted
after Alaska's admission to the Union--could prevent title tosubmerged lands within the Range from passing to Alaska at

Opinion of the Court
statehood. The Alaska Statehood Act transferred to Alaskacertain real property used for the conservation and protection of wildlife, but withheld from the State "lands with-drawn or otherwise set apart as refuges or reservations for
the protection of wildlife." Pub. L. 85-508, $ 6(e), 72 Stat.
341. Among other things, the United States argued that thelands within the Range, including coastal submerged lands,

had been "set apart" by the combined effect of the applica-tion and a Department of the Interior regulation in force
when the application was filed and when Congress passedthe Alaska Statehood Act. That regulation provided that
the filing of an application "shall temporarily segregate
such lands from settlement, location, sale, selection, entry,
lease, and other forms of disposal under the public land
laws, including the mining and the mineral leasing laws,
to the extent that the withdrawal or reservation applied
for, if effected, would prevent such forms of disposal." 43
CFR $ 295.11(a) (Supp. 1958). Accordingly, under the United
States' principal theory, the 1957 Bureau of Sport Fisheries
and Wildlife application had the legal effect of segregating
or "setting apart" all lands within the projected boundaries
of the Range, including submerged lands, as a wildlife refuge.
If this were so, $ 6(e) of the Alaska Statehood Act withheld
such lands from Alaska at statehood.

The Special Master rejected this approach. He focused
on the fact that $ 6(e) prevents transfer only of those lands
"set apart as refuges or reservations for the protection of
wildlife." (Emphasis added.) The Master concluded that,
taken together, the 1957 application and the Department of

the Interior regulation "caused land to be set apart for the
purpose of a wildlife reservation," but found that the land
"was not yet set apart as a refuge or reservation" upon Alaska's admission to the Union, because the application had not
yet been granted. Report 464 (first emphasis added). Since
the application and regulation did not withhold the lands
within the Range from Alaska under $ 6(e) of the Alaska

521US1 Unit: $U74 [11-17-99 14:25:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN
48 UNITED STATES v. ALASKA

Opinion of the Court
Statehood Act, the Master concluded that coastal submergedlands within the Range passed to Alaska upon its admission

to the Union. Because real property used for conservationof wildlife, but not set apart as a wildlife refuge or reservation, would have been transferred to Alaska, the Master's
approach arguably calls into question federal ownership of
uplands as well as submerged lands within the Range. See
infra, at 60-61.Alaska had argued in the alternative that, even if the application was effective to prevent submerged lands withinthe Range from passing to Alaska at statehood, the boundaries of the Range did not embrace certain submerged lands
between the mainland and the barrier islands along Alaska's
northeastern coast. The Master's recommendation in Alaska's favor on the effect of the application, if accepted, would
have made irrelevant the dispute concerning the boundaries
of the Range. The Master nevertheless addressed Alaska's
alternative argument and resolved the boundary dispute in
the United States' favor. Report 478-495. The Master
also considered the effect of Montana and Utah Div. of State
Lands on Alaska's ownership of submerged lands within the
Range. In supplemental briefing submitted after we decided those cases, Alaska argued that the 1957 application
reflected no clear intent to include submerged lands within
the Range. Even if the application embraced submerged
lands, Alaska asserted, the United States had identified no
evidence that Congress intended to defeat Alaska's title to
those lands. Relying principally on a statement of justification attached to the 1957 application, the Master found a
clear intent to include submerged lands within the Range.
That statement of justification described the seacoast as
"provid[ing] habitat for polar bears, Arctic foxes, seals, and
whales," Alaska Exh. 16 (Memorandum from the Director of
the Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife to the Bureau of
Land Management, Nov. 7, 1957, p. 2); the Master reasoned
that the drafters of the application "[could] not have thought

Opinion of the Court
this habitat was only upland," Report 496. In addition, theMaster noted that the original boundary of the Range was

the high water mark along the Arctic Coast; the drafterschanged the boundary to the extreme low water mark so as
to include the tidelands within the Range. Ibid. The Mas-ter also found that the application reflected an intent to defeat Alaska's title, pointing out that the reservation was"meant to have permanent effect," not merely to hold whatever submerged lands were made part of the Range untilAlaska's admission to the Union.

Ibid.The United States excepts to the Special Master's conclusion that the 1957 application and the Department of the In-terior regulation, read together, did not have the effect of

"setting apart" lands within the Range "as [a] refug[e] . . . forthe protection of wildlife." Alaska defends the Master's conclusion concerning the legal effect of the application. Alaskaalso defends on alternative grounds the ultimate conclusion
that submerged lands within the Range passed to Alaska,arguing that the United States did not clearly intend to include submerged lands within the Range and that the UnitedStates did not clearly intend to defeat Alaska's title to those
lands. In essence, Alaska challenges the Master's conclu-sion that the 1957 application met the requirements of Montana and Utah Div. of State Lands--a conclusion appearingin a section of the Report to which it did not except. See
Report 495-499. As will become clear, however, althoughthe Master considered separately whether the application
had the effect of "setting apart" lands within the Rangewithin the meaning of $ 6(e) and whether the requirements
of Montana and Utah Div. of State Lands had been met,those inquiries overlap considerably. We therefore must
address the application of Montana and Utah Div. of State
Lands to this case. A

Applying the logic of Montana and Utah Div. of State
Lands, therefore, we ask whether the United States clearlyincluded submerged lands within the Range and intended to

defeat state title to such lands. If it did, the United Stateswill have demonstrated that it "expressly retained" the
coastal submerged lands at issue in this case, including tide-lands and lands beneath the territorial sea.

B
The Master examined the legal effect of the 1957 applica-tion in one section of his Report and applied the analysis of

Montana and Utah Div. of State Lands in another. Theseinquiries overlap significantly, as the Government's argument makes clear. The Government claims that the 1957Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife application reflected
the United States' clear intent to include submerged landswithin the proposed Range, satisfying the first inquiry under
Utah Div. of State Lands. As for the second inquiry, theGovernment argues that the United States expressly retained all lands within the Range, including submergedlands, with $ 6(e) of the Alaska Statehood Act. That subsection prevented the transfer to Alaska of any lands "set apart"as a refuge. The Government maintains that the legal effect
of the 1957 application was to "set apart" the Range as arefuge. If so, the Government argues, $ 6(e) reflects a clear

Opinion of the Court
congressional intent to defeat state title. We address theterms of the application and the proper interpretation of

$ 6(e) in turn. 1

It is clear that the 1957 application by the Bureau of SportFisheries and Wildlife for withdrawal of lands in northeastern Alaska included submerged lands. The application con-tained a boundary description beginning from "the line of
extreme low water of the Arctic Ocean" at the Canadian bor-der and following "westerly along the said line of extreme
low water, including all offshore bars, reefs, and islands" toBrownlow Point. Alaska Exh. 81, p. 3. Because the boundary follows the line of extreme low water, the Range neces-sarily encompasses the periodically submerged tidelands.
The boundary description also expressly refers to certainsubmerged lands, including offshore "bars" and "reefs."
Moreover, a statement of justification accompanying the ap-plication illustrates that the Range was intended to include
submerged lands beneath other bodies of water. The state-ment explained that "countless lakes, ponds, and marshes
[within the proposed Range] are nesting grounds for largenumbers of migratory waterfowl that spend about half of
each year in the United States. . . . The river bottoms withtheir willow thickets furnish habitat for moose. This section
of the seacoast provides habitat for polar bears, Arctic foxes,seals, and whales." Alaska Exh. 16, p. 2. As the Master
concluded, the drafters of the application would not havethought that the habitats mentioned were only upland. Report 496.The express reference to bars and reefs and the purpose
of the proposed Range each distinguish this case from Mon-tana and Utah Div. of State Lands. In those cases, we concluded that submerged lands beneath certain bodies of waterhad not been conveyed or reserved, despite the fact that the
bodies of water fell within the boundaries of the conveyanceor reservation. Neither case involved an instrument of con521US1 Unit: $U74 [11-17-99 14:25:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN
52 UNITED STATES v. ALASKA

Opinion of the Court
veyance or reservation that, properly understood, referredto submerged lands. See

Montana, 450 U. S., at 548, 554;
Utah Div. of State Lands, 482 U. S., at 203. Moreover, ineach case, we focused on the purpose of the conveyance or

reservation as a critical factor in determining federal intent.
See supra, at 38-40. In Montana, we reasoned that a con-veyance of a beneficial interest in submerged lands beneath

a river on the Crow Reservation would not have been neces-sary to achieve the Government's purpose in creating the
reservation, because fishing was not important to the CrowTribe's way of life. 450 U. S., at 556. Similarly, in

Utah
Div. of State Lands, we concluded that the Federal Government could prevent settlers from claiming lands adjacent to
waters suitable for reservoir sites and could control the development of those waters, even if lands beneath the waters
in question passed to the State. 482 U. S., at 202, 208.
Here, in contrast, the statement of justification accompanying the 1957 Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife application demonstrated that waters within the boundaries of the
Range were an essential part of the habitats of the species
the Range was designed to protect, and that retention of
lands underlying those waters was critical to the Government's goal of preserving these aquatic habitats.

Alaska resists the conclusion that the application reflected
an intent to include submerged lands within the Range on
two grounds. First, Alaska focuses on the fact that the application sought only to withdraw lands within the Range
from " `all forms of appropriation under the public land laws'
except mineral leasing and mining locations." Reply Brief
for State of Alaska 17 (quoting Alaska Exh. 81, p. 1). Relying on language in Utah Div. of State Lands, Alaska argues
that submerged lands are not subject to disposal under the
public land laws and there would have been no need to exempt them from appropriation under those laws. Alaska
Opposition Brief 17; see 482 U. S., at 203 (rejecting claim that
1888 Act authorized inclusion of submerged lands in part be521US1 Unit: $U74 [11-17-99 14:25:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN

53Cite as: 521 U. S. 1 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
cause such lands were already exempt from sale, entry, oroccupation).

Alaska misreads the application. Although the applica-tion did seek to preclude appropriation of lands within the
proposed Range under the public land laws (presumably
where those laws would otherwise apply), the applicationhad a far broader purpose: to establish a reservation for the

use of the Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife. SeeAlaska Exh. 81, p. 1 ("The purpose of this withdrawal is to
establish an Arctic Wildlife Range within all or such portionof the described lands as may be finally determined to be
necessary for the preservation of the wildlife and wilderness
resources of that region of northeastern Alaska"). Because
the application was not designed solely to prevent appropriation of lands governed by the public land laws, focusing on
whether the public land laws reach submerged lands cannot
end our inquiry into whether the application embraced submerged lands.

Second, Alaska argues that no "international duty or public exigency" supported the inclusion of submerged lands
within the application. As we concluded earlier, however,
the United States need only identify an "appropriate public
purpose" for conveying or reserving submerged lands. See
supra, at 40. Creation of a wildlife refuge is an appropriate
public purpose that is served by including submerged lands
within the refuge. Alaska also appears to suggest that an
application alone can never reveal an appropriate public purpose, because until the application is granted it cannot be
known whether submerged lands are necessary to achieve
that purpose. See Reply Brief for State of Alaska 14. If
the Secretary of the Interior had granted the withdrawal
application before Alaska's statehood--thereby confirming
that an appropriate public purpose supported the reservation of submerged lands--Alaska presumably would have no
claim that the application had never covered submerged
lands in the first place. It follows that Alaska objects not to

521US1 Unit: $U74 [11-17-99 14:25:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN
54 UNITED STATES v. ALASKA

Opinion of the Court
the notion that the application covered submerged lands, but
rather to the proposition that Alaska's title to submerged
lands covered by the application could be defeated even
though the application was still pending when Alaska was
admitted to the Union. We address below whether the
United States could have defeated Alaska's title to lands not
yet part of a completed reservation. See infra, at 59-61.

Finally, it is important to point out what Alaska does not
argue at this stage of the proceedings. Alaska does not defend the Master's ultimate recommendation on the alternative ground that the Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife
lacked the authority to include submerged lands within an
application to set aside lands for a wildlife refuge. In connection with its exception to the Master's recommendation that the United States retained submerged lands within
the Reserve, Alaska argued that Congress had not properly
delegated to the Executive its authority under the Property Clause, Art. IV, $ 3, cl. 2, to divest a future State of
its title to submerged lands. Alaska makes no parallel argument here. Tr. of Oral Arg. 80-81. In any event, the
Government does not claim here that Executive actions
alone establish in this case that the United States retained
submerged lands within the Range. Rather, the Government relies squarely on congressional intent underlying

$ 6(e) of the Alaska Statehood Act. Our prior discussion of
ratification of Executive action applies equally here. See
supra, at 44-46. There would have been no constitutional
impediment to Congress designating a wildlife refuge encompassing submerged lands and retaining title to it upon
Alaska's admission to the Union, provided Congress' actions
were sufficiently clear to meet the requirements of our submerged lands cases. It follows that Congress could accomplish the same result by recognizing prior Executive actions.
We discuss below whether Congress did so here. See infra,
at 56-61.

Opinion of the Court
In sum, we conclude that the application by the Bureau ofSport Fisheries and Wildlife to withdraw lands for a wildlife

refuge reflected a clear intent to reserve submerged lands aswell as uplands. The Range's boundary was drawn so that
the periodically submerged tidelands were necessarily in-cluded within it; the boundary description referred on its
face to submerged features such as bars and reefs. More-over, the purpose of the federal reservation--protecting the
habitats of various species found along the coast and in othernavigable water bodies within the Range--supported inclusion of submerged lands within the Range.

2
We now consider whether, prior to Alaska's admission tothe Union, the United States defeated the future State's title

to the submerged lands included within the proposed Range.The Alaska Statehood Act set forth a general rule that the
United States would retain title to all property it held priorto Alaska's admission to the Union, while the State of Alaska
would acquire title to all property held by the Territory ofAlaska or its subdivisions. Pub. L. 85-508, $ 5, 72 Stat. 340.
There were several exceptions to that provision. Of pri-mary relevance here is $ 6(e), which transferred to Alaska
"[a]ll real and personal property of the United States situ-ated in the Territory of Alaska which is specifically used for
the sole purpose of conservation and protection of the fisher-ies and wildlife of Alaska . . . [provided] [t]hat such transfer
shall not include lands withdrawn or otherwise set apart asrefuges or reservations for the protection of wildlife . . . ."
Id., at 340-341.In our view, under $ 6(e) of the Alaska Statehood Act, the
United States retained the Range as lands "withdrawn orotherwise set apart as refuges or reservations for the protection of wildlife," rather than transferring the lands to Alaska.As discussed above, the 1957 application reflected an intent
to include submerged lands within the Range. Shortly after

Opinion of the Court
the application was filed, the Secretary of the Interior pub-licly announced the action. See U. S. Exh. 12 (Department

of the Interior Press Release, Nov. 20, 1957); U. S. Exh. 32(statement of Secretary Seaton). Formal notice of the application was published in the Federal Register in January 1958.23 Fed. Reg. 364. Moreover, later in 1958, while Congress
was considering Alaska's admission to the Union, the Sec-retary of the Interior informed Congress that the application
for the Range was pending and submitted maps showing thearea as a federal enclave embracing submerged lands. See
U. S. Exh. 61 (Department of Interior, Bureau of Land Man-agement, Alaska: Federal Land Withdrawals and Reservations, July 1958, Section No. 8).2 By virtue of that submis-sion, Congress was on notice when it passed the Alaska
Statehood Act that the Secretary of the Interior had con-strued his authority to withdraw or reserve lands, delegated
by the President, see Exec. Order No. 10355, 3 CFR 873(1949-1953 Comp.), to reach submerged lands. If the 1957
application in fact had the legal effect of "withdraw[ing] orotherwise set[ting] apart" lands within the proposed Range
"as refuges or reservations for the protection of wildlife"within the meaning of $ 6(e), then the United States retained
title to submerged lands as well as uplands within the Range.This is so despite $ 6(m) of the Statehood Act, which applied
the Submerged Lands Act of 1953 to Alaska. The Sub-merged Lands Act operated to confirm Alaska's title to equal
footing lands and to transfer title to submerged lands be2 Alaska claims that the map submitted to Congress did not depict the
Range, but a 1943 withdrawal under Public Land Order 82, 8 Fed. Reg.
1599, revoked, 25 Fed. Reg. 12599 (1960). Five million acres of the land
to be included in the Range were covered by PLO 82, and the Secretary
of the Interior announced a modification of the terms of PLO 82 and the
filing of the application for the Range at the same time. See U. S. Exh.
12, p. 2; U. S. Exh. 32, p. 2. The importance of the map is not that it
precisely depicts the Range's current boundaries, but that it shows the
area encompassing the Range as a proposed federal enclave embracing
submerged lands.

Opinion of the Court
neath the territorial sea to Alaska at statehood, unless theUnited States clearly withheld submerged lands within

either category prior to statehood. In $ 6(e) of the State-hood Act, Congress clearly contemplated continued federal
ownership of certain submerged lands--both inland sub-merged lands and submerged lands beneath the territorial
sea--so long as those submerged lands were among those"withdrawn or otherwise set apart as refuges or reservations for the protection of wildlife."Under

Montana and Utah Div. of State Lands, an intentto defeat state title to submerged lands must be clear. As

this discussion illustrates, the operative provision of theAlaska Statehood Act, $ 6(e), reflects a very clear intent to
defeat state title. The only remaining question is whetheran application by the head of the Bureau of Sport Fisheries
and Wildlife, upon which the Secretary of the Interior hadnot yet acted, had the effect of "withdraw[ing] or otherwise
set[ting] apart" lands within the proposed Range "as refugesor reservations for the protection of wildlife" within the
meaning of $ 6(e).Under a Department of the Interior regulation first promulgated in 1952, 17 Fed. Reg. 7368, and in effect at thetime Congress passed the Statehood Act, an application for
a withdrawal temporarily segregated the lands covered bythe application. That regulation provided:

"The noting of the receipt of the application . . . shalltemporarily segregate such lands from settlement, location, sale, selection, entry, lease, and other forms of dis-posal under the public land laws . . . to the extent that
the withdrawal or reservation applied for, if effected,would prevent such forms of disposal. To that extent,
action on all prior applications the allowance of which isdiscretionary, and on all subsequent applications, respecting such lands will be suspended until final actionon the application for withdrawal or reservation has
been taken." 43 CFR $ 295.11(a) (Supp. 1958).

521US1 Unit: $U74 [11-17-99 14:25:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN
58 UNITED STATES v. ALASKA

Opinion of the Court
The regulation temporarily foreclosed any use of the landthat a decision by the Secretary of the Interior to grant the

application would prevent. It also suspended all pendingdiscretionary applications and all subsequent applications
for other uses of the land. This temporary segregation remained in effect unless and until the Secretary of the Inte-rior denied an application. $ 295.13(c).

The Special Master adopted the United States' view thatthe application and the regulation together "set apart" all
lands within the Range. Report 464. We agree that thisconclusion follows from a straightforward application of

$ 295.11. Alaska argues that the regulation was not intended to operate on submerged lands. The object of the
regulation is quite clear: to prevent, during the pendency of
an application, any use of the land that would frustrate
federal control if the application were ultimately granted.
That goal is implicated wherever a threat to future federal
control exists--whether the lands in question are uplands or
submerged lands. The State focuses on the fact that the
regulation segregates lands from sale, entry, or other forms
of disposal, and argues that submerged lands are ordinarily
not subject to such forms of disposal. Cf. Utah Div. of State
Lands, 482 U. S., at 203. But the language in Utah Div.
of State Lands on which Alaska relies reflects the Court's
recognition that under the general land laws opening up
lands for settlement, private parties ordinarily cannot lay
claims to submerged lands. In Alaska, however, specific
laws had opened up certain submerged lands for mining well
prior to the filing of the application for the Range. See, e. g.,
Act of June 6, 1900, $ 26, 31 Stat. 329-330 (providing that
"land and shoal water between low and mean high tide on
the shores, bays, and inlets of Bering Sea . . . shall be subject
to exploration and mining for gold and other precious metals"); Act of May 31, 1938, ch. 297, 52 Stat. 588 (extending
provisions beyond the Bering Sea to "the shores, bays, and
inlets of Alaska"); Act of Aug. 8, 1947, 61 Stat. 916 (extending

Opinion of the Court
provisions to lands beneath nontidal navigable waters). Inlight of these provisions, Alaska's premise--that there would

have been no need to withdraw or set apart submerged landsto preserve ultimate federal control--is flawed.

Although the Master concluded that the application and
regulation together "set apart" all lands within the Range,the Master accepted Alaska's argument that the lands had

not been set apart "as [a] refug[e] . . . for the protection ofwildlife" within the meaning of $ 6(e) of the Alaska Statehood
Act. (Emphasis added.) The Master found that the appli-cation "did not have the same effect as a reservation of lands,
dedicating them to a specific public purpose." Report 464.
The Master reasoned that under the proviso to $ 6(e), the
United States would retain ownership only of "wildlife
refuges or reservations already established at statehood."
Ibid. (emphasis added). Because the application had not yet
been granted, the proviso to $ 6(e) would not prevent the
transfer of lands within the Range to Alaska.

We disagree. Under the Master's interpretation, $ 6(e)
applies only to completed reservations of land. But Congress did not limit $ 6(e) to completed reservations. Rather,
Congress provided that the United States would not transfer to Alaska lands "withdrawn or otherwise set apart as
refuges" for the protection of wildlife. (Emphasis added.)
The Master's reading of $ 6(e) would render the broader terminology superfluous. The Court will avoid an interpretation of a statute that "renders some words altogether redundant." Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U. S. 561, 574 (1995).
In light of Congress' clear intent, it was error for the Master
to conclude that the lands within the Range were not "otherwise set apart as [a] refug[e]" unless the United States could
point to a completed reservation. In the phrase "set apart
as [a] refug[e]," the word "as" does not carry the requirement
that the refuge be presently established; the phrase aptly
describes the administrative segregation of lands designated
to become a wildlife refuge. Accordingly, the application

521US1 Unit: $U74 [11-17-99 14:25:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN
60 UNITED STATES v. ALASKA

Opinion of the Court
and regulation, taken together, placed the Range squarelywithin the proviso of $ 6(e), preventing a transfer of lands

covered by the application to Alaska.The partial dissent's contrary conclusion rests on the view
that the lands covered by the application "had no certainty
of ever becoming a refuge or reservation." Post, at 71(

Thomas, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). But
the dissent identifies nothing in $ 6(e) requiring "certainty"that a projected final action will in fact occur, converting

lands designated for a particular use into lands so used, inorder for $ 6(e)'s proviso to prevent the transfer of such lands
to Alaska. Moreover, our reading of the proviso of $ 6(e) is
reinforced by Alaska's concession that the uplands within
the Range are held by the United States, not Alaska. Tr.
of Oral Arg. 79; Letter from Attorney General Bruce M.
Botelho to the Clerk of the Court, Mar. 3, 1997, p. 1. If the
Master were correct that the application and regulation did
not operate to "set apart" submerged lands in the proposed
Range within the meaning of $ 6(e), then it follows that the
same instruments could not set apart uplands within the
Range. Nevertheless, Alaska disclaims ownership of the
uplands. The State argues that it could only have claimed
uplands within the Refuge under $ 6(b) of the Alaska Statehood Act, which authorized Alaska to select a specified
amount of "vacant, unappropriated, and unreserved" federal
land. Since Alaska did not select the uplands before the
Secretary of the Interior approved the application for the
Range in 1960, and since after 1960 the uplands were no
longer "vacant, unappropriated, and unreserved," the State
cannot now argue that it owns the uplands. Ibid. But the
State's argument ignores the main clause of $ 6(e). Under
that clause, the United States transferred to Alaska "[a]ll
real and personal property of the United States situated in
the Territory of Alaska which is specifically used for the sole
purpose of conservation and protection of the fisheries and
wildlife of Alaska . . . ." The State does not explain why all

61Cite as: 521 U. S. 1 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
of the lands within the Range--uplands as well as sub-merged lands--would not have been transferred to Alaska at

statehood as real property used for the protection of wildlifeunless covered by the proviso. Unless all lands--submerged
lands and uplands--covered by the application were "setapart" within the meaning of the proviso to $ 6(e), they would
have passed to Alaska under the main clause of $ 6(e).There is no basis for concluding that the United States retained uplands but not submerged lands within the Range.

C
In sum, we conclude that the United States did not trans-fer to Alaska submerged lands within the Range at statehood. The 1957 application to create the wildlife refugeclearly encompassed submerged lands. Since its seaward
boundary is the low-water line along Alaska's coast, theRange necessarily encompasses the tidelands. Further reflecting an intent to withhold submerged lands is the state-ment of justification accompanying the application, which describes the habitat of various species along the coast andbeneath inland waters. A Department of the Interior regulation in effect when the application was filed and whenCongress passed the Alaska Statehood Act operated to "segregate" the lands for which the application was pending.Section 6(e) of the Alaska Statehood Act expressly prevented
lands that had been "set apart as [a] refug[e]" from passingto Alaska. It follows that, because all of the lands covered
by the 1957 application had been "set apart" for future useas a refuge, the United States retained title to submerged
lands within the Range. We therefore sustain the UnitedStates' exception to the Master's recommendation.

VI
We overrule Alaska's exceptions to the Special Master'srecommended rulings that (1) Alaska's submerged lands in

the vicinity of barrier islands should be measured as a 3-mile

belt from a coastline following the normal baseline under theConvention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone;

(2) Dinkum Sands is not an island constituting part of Alas-ka's coastline under the Submerged Lands Act; and (3) submerged lands beneath tidally influenced waters within theboundary of the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska did not
pass to Alaska at statehood. We sustain the United States'exception to the Special Master's recommended ruling that
offshore submerged lands within the boundaries of the ArcticNational Wildlife Refuge passed to Alaska at statehood.

The recommendations of the Special Master are adoptedto the extent that they are consistent with this opinion. The
parties are directed to prepare and submit an appropriatedecree for this Court's consideration. The Court retains jurisdiction to entertain such further proceedings, enter suchorders, and issue such writs as from time to time may be
determined necessary or advisable to effectuate and supple-ment the forthcoming decree and the rights of the respective parties.The parties shall bear their own costs.

It is so ordered.
Justice Thomas, with whom The Chief Justice and
Justice Scalia join, concurring in part and dissenting inpart.

I agree with the Court that the limit of inland waters inthe area of Stefansson Sound should be determined by reference to the Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contig-uous Zone, in which Alaska's proposed 10-mile rule finds
no purchase. I also agree that Dinkum Sands is not an is-land within the meaning of the Convention. Accordingly, I
join Parts I, II, and III of the Court's opinion. I do notshare the Court's view that the United States holds title
to submerged lands within National Petroleum ReserveNumber 4. Nor do I agree with the Court's conclusion that,
"at the time of [Alaska's] statehood," the then-unapprovedapplication to create the Arctic Wildlife Range "expressly

Opinion of Thomas, J.
retained" the submerged lands within the boundaries de-scribed in that application under the Submerged Lands Act.

I thus respectfully dissent from Parts IV and V of theCourt's opinion.

I
I turn first to the Court's discussion of the National Petroleum Reserve. The Master's Report posited two possiblemeasures for the specificity with which Congress must declare its intent to retain submerged lands that would other-wise pass to a new State. For those lands under inland waters--lands historically viewed as held by the United States
"for the ultimate benefit of future States," Utah Div. of State
Lands v. United States, 482 U. S. 193, 201 (1987) (internal
quotation marks omitted)--the Special Master employed a
strict presumption of state ownership. The Master determined that lands under the territorial sea--those lands
vested in the States solely by the Submerged Lands Act--
ought to be presumed to remain in federal hands under "the
principle that federal grants are to be construed strictly in
favor of the United States." California ex rel. State Lands
Comm'n v. United States, 457 U. S. 273, 287 (1982).

It is my view, however, that, since the enactment of the
Submerged Lands Act, the test for determining whether
submerged lands--inland or territorial--are conveyed to a
newly created State or retained by the United States is that
set forth in the Act.

Following in the wake of our decision in United States v.
California, 332 U. S. 19 (1947), as it did, the Submerged
Lands Act is widely recognized for having deeded to coastal
States the submerged lands lying within 3-mile bands surrounding their coasts. See $ 3(a), 43 U. S. C. $ 1311(a); see
also United States v. Maine, 420 U. S. 515, 525 (1975). The
Act declared it in the

"public interest that (1) title to and ownership of the
lands beneath navigable waters within the boundaries of
the respective States, and the natural resources within

such lands and waters, and (2) the right and power tomanage, administer, lease, develop, and use the said

lands and natural resources all in accordance with appli-cable State law be, and they are, subject to the provisions hereof, recognized, confirmed, established, andvested in and assigned to the respective States . . . ."

$ 3(a).
The definition of "lands beneath navigable waters" includedthose submerged lands under the territorial sea. See

$ 2(a)(2), 43 U. S. C. $ 1301(a)(2). The Act's undertaking to"ves[t] in and assig[n] to" the States the rights to those lands
thus conveyed to the States lands that this Court had foundin United States v. California to be exclusively federal enclaves. The definition of "lands beneath navigable waters"also included those lands beneath inland waters. See

$ 2(a)(1) (defining "lands beneath navigable waters" to in-clude "all lands within the boundaries of each of the respective States which are covered by nontidal waters that werenavigable" (emphasis added)). Accordingly--and the majority and I agree to this point--coastal States entering theUnion after the passage of the Submerged Lands Act gained
title to offshore submerged lands and to inland submergedlands through the operation of that statute.

Section 3, which conveyed and confirmed the States' titleto submerged lands, was subject to a series of exceptions.
As relevant here, $ 5 of the Act excepted from $ 3's terms "alllands expressly retained by or ceded to the United States
when the State entered the Union (otherwise than by a gen-eral retention or cession of lands underlying the marginal
sea)." $ 5(a), 43 U. S. C. $ 1313(a) (emphasis added). As tolands beneath the marginal (or territorial) sea, it is undisputed that the "expressly retained" exception sets forth thetest for determining whether a withdrawal or reservation of
land by the United States is effective in preventing convey-ance of title to submerged lands. It seems clear to me that
it is also the test for determining whether the United States

has retained title to inland submerged lands. Section 3(a)
lands include those beneath both inland and territorial waters. In the case of a State, like Alaska, that received title
to all of its submerged lands by virtue of the Submerged
Lands Act, there is no need to consult conflicting presumptions, two-part tests, or anything other than the stated policy
on which Congress has finally settled.1

The Court seems to agree with me that the Act is now the
expression of Congress' policy on submerged lands retention.
But, the Court also seems to view the phrase "expressly retained" in the Act as shorthand for the test we employed in
Utah Div. of State Lands, a case decided three decades after
passage of the Act. That is, to determine whether submerged lands have been "expressly retained," we must determine whether Congress "clearly intended to include land
under navigable waters within the federal reservation," and
whether Congress "affirmatively intended to defeat the future State's title to such land." 482 U. S., at 202 (emphases
added). I find the Court's reading of the "expressly retained" language curious. First, as I discuss below, the language does not lend itself to the Court's construction. Second, it is not the case that the test set forth in Utah Div. of
State Lands was simply a restatement of the test employed
by the Court before the enactment of the Submerged Lands
Act. Were it so, then the majority's assertion that the
standard in the Act was described in pre-Act cases and simply "carried forward," ante, at 36, into Utah Div. of State
Lands might be colorable. As it happens, in Utah Div. of

1 It is, I think, an open question whether the Submerged Lands Act has
any operation as to land beneath inland waters in States that entered the
Union prior to its enactment, thus initially obtaining title to submerged
lands independently of the Act. Determining whether and how the Act
applies to pre-existing States involves, at the least, complex retroactivity
questions not presented by this case, given that Alaska became a State
after the enactment of the Submerged Lands Act, which Alaska's Statehood Act expressly incorporates.

66 UNITED STATES v. ALASKA

Opinion of Thomas, J.
State Lands, the Court addressed for the first time the argu-ment that a retention--as opposed to a conveyance--of submerged lands by the United States could defeat a futureState's title to those lands, 482 U. S., at 200. In response,
the Court crafted the two-part test relied on by the majority
today. Id., at 202. Whatever can be said of that test, itwas not before the drafters of the Submerged Lands Act.

Accordingly, there is no reason to believe that, when Con-gress employed the phrase "expressly retained," it intended
a meaning not obvious from those words and not set forth inan opinion of this Court until three decades after the Act
became effective.

But the Submerged Lands Act, I think, embraces at least
part of the policy that we had attributed to Congress in several pre-Act cases. We have, for example, stated that we
would not affirm a conveyance of inland submerged lands
that was not set out in "clear and especial words," Martin v.
Lessee of Waddell, 16 Pet. 367, 411 (1842), or "unless the
claim . . . in terms embraces the land under the waters of
the stream," Packer v. Bird, 137 U. S. 661, 672 (1891). It
is, I believe, the meaning of these passages that "expressly
retained" captures. Because the only "lands" described in

$ 3(a) of the Act are submerged lands, the requirement that
any retention of them be "expres[s]" means that the retention must "in terms embrac[e] the land under the waters."
Accordingly, contrary to the Master's conclusion and much of
the majority's analysis, a retention of lands cannot be inferred from, for example, the purpose of a given attempted
federal undertaking. To be sure, prior to the passage of the
Submerged Lands Act, the Court looked beyond the words
used in efforts to prevent passage of submerged lands to
newly created States. For example, in United States v. Holt
State Bank, 270 U. S. 49 (1926), the Court noted that "disposals by the United States during the territorial period are not
lightly to be inferred, and should not be regarded as intended unless the intention was definitely declared or other521US1 Unit: $U74 [11-17-99 14:25:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of Thomas, J.
wise made very plain." Id., at 55 (emphases added). Afterthe enactment of the Submerged Lands Act, it appears that

not only is retention of submerged lands not "lightly to beinferred," it is not to be inferred at all. In this respect, Congress has required of itself a higher standard than either theMaster or the majority attribute to it.

2

Neither the Master, in his exhaustive Report, nor the ma-jority, in its only slightly less exhaustive opinion, cites anything meeting what I believe to be the requirement of anexpress retention of submerged lands within the boundaries
of the National Petroleum Reserve. The majority focuses,instead, on the "

purpose of a conveyance or reservation" asa "critical factor in determining federal intent." Ante, at 39

(emphasis in original). The Court concludes that the pur-poses for establishing the Reserve--primarily to ensure federal possession of petroleum resources within the Reserve'sboundaries--would be undermined if the United States did
not retain the submerged lands. So "[i]t is simply not plau-sible," says the majority, "that the United States sought
to reserve only the upland portions of the area." Ante, at39-40. To me, these considerations are wholly beside the
point. Congress, when it incorporated the Submerged LandsAct into $ 6(m) of the Alaska Statehood Act, Pub. L. 85-508, 72
Stat. 343, demanded of itself an express retention of sub-merged lands to prevent their passage to Alaska. If Congress
had the purpose attributed to it by the majority, the bestway--indeed, the only legal way--for it to realize that purpose
was to state "expressly" that the submerged lands inside the

2 Section 5(a)'s standard is at the same time somewhat more generous
to the United States. In Utah Div. of State Lands v. United States, 482
U. S. 193 (1987), we asserted that a reservation--as opposed to a conveyance--of land would not be held to defeat state title to submerged lands
even if those lands were manifestly included in the reservation where
there was lacking an indication from Congress that it "affirmatively" intended to defeat a future State's title to those lands. See id., at 202.
This was, we thought, required by congressional policy. I do not, however, perceive that requirement in the language of $ 5(a).

Opinion of Thomas, J.
National Petroleum Reserve were retained for the UnitedStates. It may well be, as the majority concludes, that

Congress can retain lands by ratification of or reference toan earlier instrument describing those lands (the majority
points here to President Harding's 1923 Executive Order).But, congressional ratification of an instrument that does
not--as President Harding's order does not--"in terms em-brac[e] the land under the waters" cannot, anymore than a
statute that fails to do so, constitute an express retention asrequired by the Submerged Lands Act.

3

Absent an express retention of submerged lands, the Sub-merged Lands Act effected the transfer of all submerged

lands within the Territory of Alaska to the State of Alaska--including those within the boundaries of National Petroleum
Reserve Number 4. I dissent from the Court's contraryconclusion.

II
The majority rejects the Master's recommendation thatAlaska be found to hold title to the submerged lands within

the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Although I acknowl-edge that the question is close, I agree with the Master and
would overrule the United States' exception.4

3 The majority points to a prestatehood enactment, Pub. L. 85-303,

$ 2(a), 71 Stat. 623, granting certain offshore lands to the Territory of
Alaska, but excepting from that grant " `oil and gas deposits located in the
submerged lands' " along the Arctic coast of the Reserve. See ante, at
42 (emphasis in original). This statute is said to "reinforc[e]" the "conclusion that Congress was aware when it passed the Alaska Statehood Act
that the Reserve encompassed submerged lands." Ibid. But the statute
proves little more than that Congress was, circa Alaska's statehood, capable of expressly referring to submerged lands. It does not--and the majority does not claim that it could--operate as an express retention.

4 This conclusion arises out of my review of the United States' exception

to the Master's recommendation on Question 9. Before I turn to it, I
must admit some bafflement as to why the majority undertakes a review
of the Master's recommendation on Question 10. See ante, at 51-55. In
answer to Question 10, the Special Master, using reasoning parallel to that
of his discussion of National Petroleum Reserve No. 4, concluded that the

69Cite as: 521 U. S. 1 (1997)
Opinion of Thomas, J.
The United States contends that the submerged lands
within the Refuge were "expressly retained" when Alaska
became a State. Section 5 of the Alaska Statehood Act
keeps for the United States "title to all property, real and
personal, to which it has title, including public lands." 72
Stat. 340. The various subsections of $ 6 of the Statehood
Act exclude from that general retention a variety of lands.
Section 6(e) provides that federal agencies will "transfe[r]
and conve[y]" to Alaska "[a]ll real and personal property of
the United States situated in the Territory of Alaska which
is specifically used for the sole purpose of conservation and
protection of the fisheries and wildlife of Alaska" under three
statutes. Ibid. A proviso to $ 6(e), however, states that
"such transfer shall not include lands withdrawn or otherwise set apart as refuges or reservations for the protection
of wildlife." Id., at 341.5

The United States contends that the Refuge was, as of
Alaska's statehood, "set apart as [a] refug[e]." This was accomplished, it is argued, by means of an application filed with
the Secretary of the Interior in November 1957 by the Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife "to establish an Arctic
Wildlife Range" within certain lands in Alaska's northeastern corner. See Report of Special Master 447, n. 1 (Report)

application for withdrawal of the land within the Refuge included submerged lands. Alaska failed to file an exception to that recommendation,
and we have no more occasion to take it up than any of the several other
questions on which the Master offered recommendations to which neither
party has objected. Because it is not before us, I express no view on the
Master's conclusion as to Question 10.

5 The term "lands" employed in $ 6(e) is presumably to be read in pari

materia with the same term in $ 5. Section 5 makes no express mention
of submerged lands, so one can inquire whether, under the Submerged
Lands Act, $ 5 (never mind $ 6(e), which, as a proviso to an exception to

$ 5, cannot outstrip $ 5) "expressly retained" submerged lands for the
United States. Alaska, in forgoing its right to except to the Master's
recommendation as to Question 10, has, I think, given up its opportunity
to make any such argument and I will not take it up.

70 UNITED STATES v. ALASKA

Opinion of Thomas, J.
(citing Alaska Exh. 81).6 The Government does not arguethat the Refuge was "withdrawn" by the application within

the meaning of $ 6(e). See Brief for United States 41; Re-port 463. Rather, the application falls within $ 6(e) because,
we are told, the application "was the legal mechanism bywhich the Interior Department at that time `set apart' public
lands for the creation of a wildlife refuge." Brief for UnitedStates 41. Under the Department of the Interior's regulations in effect at the time, the effect of an application was to"temporarily segregate such lands from settlement, location,
sale, selection, entry, lease, and other forms of disposal underthe public land laws, . . . to the extent that the withdrawal
or reservation applied for, if effected, would prevent suchforms of disposal." 43 CFR $ 295.11(a) (1958), 22 Fed. Reg.
6614 (1957). The regulation further provided that "[s]uchtemporary segregation shall not affect the administrative
jurisdiction over the segregated lands." Ibid.The Master acknowledged the regulation's effect, but determined that, while it may have been to "set apart" thesubmerged lands within the Range, the lands were not "set
apart as a refuge or reservation." Report 464 (emphasis inoriginal). The majority disagrees, asserting that "[i]n the
phrase `set apart as [a] refug[e],' the word `as' does not carrythe requirement that the refuge be presently established."
Ante, at 59. "[T]he phrase," concludes the majority, "aptlydescribes the administrative segregation of lands designated
to become a wildlife refuge." Ibid.I disagree. As the language of the Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife's application made clear, at the time of theapplication (and at the time of statehood), no one could say
with any certainty what lands--if any--included within theboundaries set forth in the application were at that time
"designated to become a wildlife refuge." See Report 447,

6 The United States no longer contends that the application, of its
own force, "expressly retained" submerged lands. See Brief for United
States 29.

n. 1 (" `The purpose of this withdrawal is to establish an Arc-tic Wildlife Range within all or

such portion of the described
lands as may be finally determined to be necessary for thepreservation of the wildlife and wilderness resources of that

region of northeastern Alaska' " (quoting Alaska Exhibit 81,
p. 1) (emphasis added)). Not only was it unknown whetherthe lands (or any of them) would ultimately become a refuge

or reservation, but also, during the pendency of the applica-tion, the "administrative jurisdiction" over the lands remained with the Bureau of Land Management. See 43 CFR$ 295.11(a) (1958). The Fish and Wildlife Service did not
begin to administer the Refuge until the application for it
was finally adopted after Alaska's statehood. See Report
464. As of the time of the Alaska Statehood Act, the lands
within the application had no certainty of ever becoming a
refuge or reservation, and were not then administered as
one.

This is not to say that the application and regulation did
not have any effect on the lands described in the application.
The lands within the application were, by operation of the
regulation, free from certain "forms of disposal" during the
pendency of the application. 43 CFR $ 295.11(a) (1958). I
am willing to agree with the Master and the majority that,
under the regulation, the lands were "set apart." But, they
were "set apart" temporarily and merely to preserve the status quo pending the Secretary's decision on the application
in order that a decision by the Secretary that such lands
should become a refuge or reservation would not be a nullity.
Contrary to the suggestion of the United States that the regulation "was the legal mechanism by which the Interior Department at that time `set apart' public lands for the creation
of a wildlife refuge," Brief for United States 41, that regulation applied to all applications for withdrawals or reservations of land, not merely those to create wildlife refuges.
See, e. g., 43 CFR $ 295.9 (1958) (listing who may apply for
withdrawals or reservation without limitation to agencies

Opinion of Thomas, J.
seeking to create wildlife refuges). In my view, then, theMaster overstated the effect of the application and regulation when he said that they "caused land to be set apart for
the purpose of a wildlife reservation." Report 464 (emphasis added). The effect of the set-apart was to ensure that
any decision to create a wildlife refuge--if that were the de-cision ultimately made--would not be undermined by prior

land actions adverse to any such decision. Only if the proce-dures that intervened between the Bureau's application and
the Secretary's decision were merely ministerial, which theGovernment is wise not to argue, see 43 CFR $ 295.12 (1958)
(describing procedures), could the set-apart be accurately de-scribed as "

for the purpose of a wildlife reservation." Thus,
it goes without saying that I do not agree with the majority's
even more ambitious conclusion that the lands were "setapart

as [a] refug[e]." 7Nor do I agree with the majority's contention that the

Master's reading would render the "otherwise set apart"
portion of $ 6(e) redundant, as only a "completed reservation"
of land would prevent that land from passing to Alaska.
Ante, at 59. I believe that the proviso in $ 6(e) is set forth
in broad language in an attempt to capture all ways in which
a refuge or reservation for the protection of wildlife can be
created--not unlike Congress' attempt in $ 3(a) of the Submerged Lands Act to capture every way in which title to
submerged lands could be conferred. See supra, at 63. Accordingly, Congress' use of the phrase "lands withdrawn or
otherwise set apart" fairly encompasses every way in which
lands can be segregated "as refuges or reservations." Re7 That Alaska has acquiesced in the United States' ownership of the uplands within the boundaries of the Refuge says nothing whatever about
Congress' intent in enacting the Alaska Statehood Act. Accordingly, I do
not understand the majority's citation to this point. Ante, at 60. Indeed,
if Alaska's poststatehood actions are relevant, it must surely be equally
relevant that Alaska strenuously disputes ownership of the submerged
lands within the Refuge.

quiring a completed refuge or reservation--by whatevermeans created--does not render any portion of the proviso

redundant.For these reasons, I conclude that the Master correctly
determined that the Bureau's application was not sufficientfor purposes of $ 6(e)'s proviso. I would overrule the United
States' exception to his recommendation.

III
I would overrule Alaska's exceptions to the Master's rec-ommendation on the method for determining the limits of

Alaska's offshore submerged lands, and his recommendationconcerning Dinkum Sands' insular status. I concur with the
majority on these two points. I would also overrule theUnited States' exception to the Master's recommendation
concerning the Arctic Wildlife Refuge. And, finally, I wouldsustain Alaska's objection to the Master's recommendation
as to the ownership of submerged lands within NationalPetroleum Reserve No. 4. On these last two points, I respectfully dissent.

ABRAMS et al. v. JOHNSON et al.
appeal from the united states district court for thesouthern district of georgia

No. 95-1425. Argued December 9, 1996--Decided June 19, 1997*
The electoral district lines for Georgia's congressional delegation are here

a second time, appeal now being taken from the District Court's rulings
and determinations on remand after Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S. 900, in
which this Court affirmed the finding that the State's Eleventh District
was unconstitutional because race was a predominant factor in its drawing, id., at 915-917. The plan challenged contained three majorityblack districts, and after remand the complaint was amended to challenge another of these, the then-Second District, which the trial court
found was also improperly drawn under Miller. The court deferred to
Georgia's Legislature to draw a new plan, but the legislature could not
reach agreement. The court then drew its own plan, containing but one
majority-black district, the Fifth; this Court declined to stay the order;
and the 1996 general elections were held under it. The appellants, various voters and the United States, now seek to set the trial court's plan
aside, claiming that it does not adequately take into account the interests of Georgia's black population.

Held: The District Court's redistricting plan is not unconstitutional.

Pp. 79-101.

(a) The trial court did not exceed its remedial power under the general rule of Upham v. Seamon, 456 U. S. 37, 43 (per curiam), whereby
courts drawing voting district lines must be guided by the legislative
policies underlying the existing plan, to the extent they do not lead to
violations of the Constitution or the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (Act).
Appellants' argument that this rule required the trial court to adopt
three majority-black districts, as in the 1992 plan at issue in Miller, or
two such districts, as in the Georgia Legislature's original 1991 plan, is
unavailing, given the background against which the legislature--and
later the trial court--attempted to draw districts. The considerable
evidence of Justice Department pressure on Georgia to create the maximum number of majority-black districts, leading the state legislature to
act based on an overriding concern with race, disturbed any sound basis
for the trial court to defer to the 1991 plan; the unconstitutional pre*Together with No. 95-1460, United States v. Johnson et al., also on
appeal from the same court.

Syllabus
dominance of race in the 1992 plan's provenance of the Second and Eleventh Districts caused them to be improper departure points; and the
proposals for either two or three majority-black districts in plans urged
in the remedy phase of this litigation were flawed by evidence of predominant racial motive in their design. Thus, the trial court acted well
within its discretion in deciding it could not draw two majority-black
districts without engaging in racial gerrymandering. Pp. 79-90.

(b) The court-ordered plan does not contravene $ 2 of the Act, a violation of which occurs if "it is shown that the political processes leading
to . . . election . . . are not equally open to participation by members of
[a racial minority] . . . ," 42 U. S. C. $ 1973(b). The Court rejects appellants' contrary position premised on impermissible vote dilution in the
trial court's failure to create a second majority-black district. A plaintiff seeking to establish such dilution must, inter alia, meet three requirements set forth in Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S. 30, 50-51. Because the trial court found, without clear error, that the black population
was not sufficiently compact for a second majority-black district, the
first of these factors is not satisfied. Nor can it be said, given evidence
of significant white crossover voting, that the trial court clearly erred
in finding insufficient racial polarization to meet the second and third
Gingles factors, that the minority group is "politically cohesive" and
that the majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it to defeat the
minority's preferred candidate. The Court disagrees with appellants'
arguments that the trial court's $ 2 findings are not owed deference because its rulings that $ 2 required maintenance of the Fifth District but
not creation of a new majority-black district are inconsistent, because it
did not hold a separate hearing on whether its remedial plan violated

$ 2, and because it barred private intervention to defend the Second
District's constitutionality. Pp. 90-95.

(c) The plan does not violate $ 5 of the Act, which requires that covered jurisdictions obtain either administrative preclearance by the
United States Attorney General or approval from the United States
District Court for the District of Columbia for any voting-procedure
change, and that such a change "not have the purpose [or] effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color," 42 U. S. C.

$ 1973c. The section aims to prevent changes leading to a retrogression
in the position of racial minorities with respect to their effective exercise of the electoral franchise. Beer v. United States, 425 U. S. 130, 141.
Although a court-devised redistricting plan such as the one at issue need
not be precleared under $ 5, Connor v. Johnson, 402 U. S. 690, 691 (per
curiam), the court should take into account the appropriate $ 5 standards in fashioning such a plan, McDaniel v. Sanchez, 452 U. S. 130, 149.
Even were this Court to accept one of appellants' proposed benchmarks

521US1 Unit: $U75 [11-17-99 14:36:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN
76 ABRAMS v. JOHNSON

Syllabus
for measuring retrogression, their desired remedy would be impermissible because they have not demonstrated it was possible to create a second majority-black district within constitutional bounds. Moreover,
none of their proposed benchmarks--the 1991 plan, the State's supposed
policy of creating two majority-black districts, and the 1992 plan shorn
of its constitutional defects--was ever in effect, and thus none could
operate as a benchmark under the Attorney General's regulations and,
e. g., Holder v. Hall, 512 U. S. 874, 883-884. Nor can the 1992 plan,
constitutional defects and all, be the benchmark, since $ 5 cannot be used
to freeze in place the very aspects of a plan found unconstitutional. The
appropriate benchmark is, in fact, what the District Court concluded it
would be: the 1982 plan, in effect for a decade. Appellants have not
shown that black voters in any particular district suffered a retrogression in their voting strength under the court plan measured against the
1982 plan. Pp. 95-98.

(d) The plan does not violate the constitutional guarantee of one person, one vote under Article I, $ 2. Although court-ordered districts
must ordinarily achieve that provision's goal of population equality with
little more than de minimis variation, e. g., Chapman v. Meier, 420 U. S.
1, 26-27, slight deviations are allowed upon enunciation of unique features or historically significant state policies, id., at 26, including, e. g.,
the desire to respect municipal boundaries and to preserve the cores of
prior districts, Karcher v. Daggett, 462 U. S. 725, 740. Here, the trial
court's plan has an overall population deviation lower than any other
plan presented to it which was not otherwise constitutionally defective.
Moreover, the court recited in detail those factors supporting the plan's
slight deviation, including Georgia's strong historical preference for not
splitting counties outside the Atlanta area and for not splitting precincts, as well as the State's interests in maintaining core districts and
communities of interest, given its unusually high number of counties.
Even if this Court found the plan's population deviation unacceptable,
the solution would not be adoption of appellants' constitutionally infirm,
race-based, plans, but simply the shifting of a few precincts to even out
the districts with the greatest deviations. Moreover, equitable considerations--the passage of more than six years since the census on which
appellants' data is based and Georgia's ongoing and dramatic population
shifts and changes--disfavor requiring yet another reapportionment to
correct the court plan's deviation. See id., at 732. Pp. 98-101.

Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.
The electoral district lines for Georgia's congressional del-egation are before us a second time, appeal now being taken

from the trial court's rulings and determinations after ourremand in Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S. 900 (1995). The
three-judge panel of the United States District Court for theSouthern District of Georgia was affirmed in Miller after it
found the Eleventh Congressional District unconstitutionalas then drawn. Race, we held, must not be a predominant
factor in drawing the district lines. Id., at 915-917.Given the contorted shape of the district and the undue
predominance of race in drawing its lines, it was unlikely thedistrict could be redrawn without changing most or all of
Georgia's congressional districts, 11 in total number. The

78 ABRAMS v. JOHNSON

Opinion of the Court
plan being challenged contained three majority-black dis-tricts, and after our remand the complaint was amended to

challenge another of these, the then-Second District. Thetrial court found this district, too, was improperly drawn
under the standards we confirmed in Miller. Johnson v.
Miller, 922 F. Supp. 1552 (1995).For the task of drawing a new plan, the court deferred

to Georgia's Legislature, but the legislature could not reachagreement. The court then drew its own plan,

Johnson v.
Miller, 922 F. Supp. 1556 (1995); we declined to stay theorder; and the 1996 general elections were held under it.

The court's plan contained but one majority-black district.
The absence of a second, if not a third, majority-black district
has become the principal point of contention. Though the
elections have been completed, the plan remains in effect
until changed by a valid legislative Act, and the appellants
ask us to set it aside.

The private appellants are various voters, defendantintervenors below, who contend that the interests of Georgia's black population were not adequately taken into account. The United States, also a defendant-intervenor, joins
in the appeal. The state officials, defendants below, do not
object to the plan and appeared before us as appellees to
defend it. The other set of appellees are the private plaintiffs below, who argued that racial gerrymandering under
the previous plan violated their right to equal protection.

The private appellants attack the court's plan on five
grounds. First, citing Upham v. Seamon, 456 U. S. 37 (1982)
(per curiam), they say the District Court erred in disregarding the State's legislative policy choices and in making more
changes than necessary to cure constitutional defects in the
previous plan. Second and third, they allege the plan violates $$ 2 and 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 42 U. S. C.

$$ 1973, 1973c. Fourth, they argue the court's plan contains
significant population deviations and so violates the constitutional one-person, one-vote requirement. Fifth, they claim

Opinion of the Court
the District Court erred in not allowing private interventionon the question of the Second District's unconstitutionality.

The Justice Department included questions one, two, andfour in its jurisdictional statement. Private appellants did
not brief their fifth contention, and we will not address it.The remaining challenges are unavailing as well, and we
affirm the judgment of the District Court.

I
We first address appellants' argument that the court ex-ceeded the remedial power authorized by our decisions, particularly Upham v. Seamon, supra, by failing to follow poli-cies of the state legislature. When faced with the necessity
of drawing district lines by judicial order, a court, as a gen-eral rule, should be guided by the legislative policies underlying the existing plan, to the extent those policies do notlead to violations of the Constitution or the Voting Rights
Act. 456 U. S., at 43. Much of the argument from the par-ties centers around what legislative redistricting principles
the District Court should have acknowledged in drawing itsplan. The appellants say the relevant redistricting guideline should be the three majority-black districts of the pre-cleared plan at issue in Miller v. Johnson; and, if not, the
two majority-black districts in an earlier legislative effort.These contentions require us to recite some of the background against which the Georgia Legislature--and later thetrial court--attempted to draw the districts.

A
Much of the history is recounted in Miller v. Johnson, andwe repeat only some of it here. The need for redistricting

arose in 1990 when Georgia, because of its population in-crease, went from 10 authorized congressional seats to 11.
To move ahead with redistricting, a special session of thelegislature opened in August 1991. Because Georgia is a
covered jurisdiction under $ 4(b) of the Voting Rights Act, 42

Opinion of the Court
U. S. C. $ 1973b(b), $ 5 of the Act requires it to obtain eitheradministrative preclearance by the Attorney General or approval by the United States District Court for the Districtof Columbia for any change in a "standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting." 42 U. S. C. $ 1973c. The proposed change must not have the purpose or effect "of deny-ing or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color."

Ibid. The legislature submitted a plan to the Attorney Gen-eral for preclearance on October 1, 1991. See Appendix to
this opinion (hereinafter Appendix), fig. 1. The plan con-tained two majority-black districts, the Fifth and the Eleventh. Previously, Georgia had one majority-black district,
the Fifth.

The Department of Justice refused preclearance of this
plan in January 1992. It then refused preclearance of a second plan submitted by the legislature, also with two
majority-black districts. In its second refusal, the Department of Justice cited several alternative plans proposing
three majority-black districts, including one called the
"max-black" plan, drafted by the American Civil Liberties
Union (ACLU) for the General Assembly's black caucus. At
that point, the General Assembly set out to create three
majority-black districts to gain preclearance. See Appendix, fig. 2. The plan as adopted used the ACLU's max-black
plan as a model. One of the three majority-black districts,
the Eleventh, was a geographic " `monstrosity, stretching
from Atlanta to Savannah. Its core is the plantation country in the center of the state, lightly populated, but heavily
black. It links by narrow corridors the black neighborhoods
in Augusta, Savannah and southern DeKalb County.' " 515
U. S., at 909 (quoting M. Barone & G. Ujifusa, Almanac of
American Politics 356 (1994)). The district as so drawn
served its purpose, however, which was to secure preclearance from the Department of Justice.

On November 4, 1992, elections were held under the new
plan, and all three majority-black districts elected black can521US1 Unit: $U75 [11-17-99 14:36:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
didates. In 1994, five white voters from the Eleventh District filed suit in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of Georgia, alleging a racial gerrymander
in the lines of the Eleventh District, in violation of the Equal
Protection Clause as interpreted in Shaw v. Reno, 509 U. S.
630 (1993). The District Court panel found the district
invalid, with one judge dissenting. Johnson v. Miller, 864
F. Supp. 1354 (1994).

We affirmed. Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S. 900 (1995).
We rejected appellants' argument that "regardless of the legislature's purposes, a plaintiff must demonstrate that a district's shape is so bizarre that it is unexplainable other than
on the basis of race." Id., at 910. We said "the essence of
the equal protection claim recognized in Shaw is that the
State has used race as a basis for separating voters into districts." Id., at 911. And we explained that "[t]he plaintiff 's
burden is to show, either through circumstantial evidence of
a district's shape and demographics or more direct evidence
going to legislative purpose, that race was the predominant
factor motivating the legislature's decision to place a significant number of voters within or without a particular district." Id., at 916.

We upheld two principal findings of the District Court indicating race was the predominant factor in constructing the
Eleventh District. First, it was " `exceedingly obvious' "
from the district's contorted shape, together with the relevant racial demographics, that it was designed to bring in
black populations. Id., at 917 (quoting 864 F. Supp., at 1375).
Second, considerable evidence--including the State's own
concessions--showed that the General Assembly was driven
by "a predominant, overriding desire" to create three
majority-black districts to satisfy the Department of Justice.
515 U. S., at 917. The Justice Department, indeed, " `would
accept nothing less than abject surrender to its maximization
agenda.' " Ibid. (quoting 864 F. Supp., at 1366, n. 11).

Opinion of the Court
We then considered whether the race-based districtingsatisfied strict scrutiny because it was narrowly tailored to

achieve a compelling governmental interest. As we noted,"[o]ur presumptive skepticism of all racial classifications"
prohibited us "from accepting on its face the Justice Department's conclusion that racial districting is necessary underthe Voting Rights Act." 515 U. S., at 922. After reviewing

the evidence, we concluded that "[i]nstead of grounding itsobjections on evidence of a discriminatory purpose, it would
appear the Government was driven by its policy of maximiz-ing majority-black districts."

Id., at 924.
On remand, the District Court deferred to the Georgia
Legislature, giving it time to draw a new congressional map.
The Governor called a special session of the General Assembly, which met from August 14 to September 12, 1995. The
legislature, however, deadlocked on the congressional reapportionment plan. The Georgia House of Representatives
adopted a plan with two majority-black districts, Status Report of Defendants Miller, Howard, and Cleland, Aug. 31,
1995, Record, Pleadings Vol. 11, Doc. No. 295, while the Senate adopted a plan with one, Status Report of Defendants
Miller, Howard, and Cleland, Sept. 5, 1995, id., Doc. No. 300.
On September 13, 1995, defendants notified the District
Court that the legislature was unable to resolve its differences and had adjourned, leaving the District Court to develop a remedy.

Plaintiffs had moved to amend their complaint to challenge
the Second District as unconstitutional on the same grounds
as the Eleventh District, and the court received additional
evidence for the purpose. None of the private defendantintervenors lived in the Second District and, assuming their
lack of standing to defend it, they asked for the addition of
other parties. The court disallowed the request, ruling the
State could defend this aspect of the plan under review.

The court found that race was the "overriding and predominant factor" in drawing the Second District's borders. 922

Opinion of the Court
F. Supp., at 1553. The district, the court noted, split 12 ofthe district's 35 counties, 28 of its precincts, and numerous

cities. Linda Meggers, Director of Reapportionment Serv-ices for the Georgia General Assembly, was qualified as an
expert witness and testified it was not possible to create a
majority-black Second District without including the blackpopulation centers in Columbus and Muscogee Counties, Albany and Dougherty Counties, and Macon and Bibb Coun-ties, which account for most of these splits. She also testified that in constructing the Second District, she followedthe ACLU's max-black plan.

Id., at 1554-1555. As with
the Eleventh District, the trial court found no compelling
reason for the race-based districting of the Second District
sufficient to survive strict scrutiny. The appellants do not
appeal the determination by the trial court that the Second
District as drawn could not survive scrutiny under the
standards set forth in Miller, but they do say the trial court
erred in not devising a second majority-black district for its
own plan.

During the remedy phase, the defendants proposed a variety of plans. One was the 1991 unprecleared plan passed by
the Georgia Legislature, with two majority-black districts.
The Eleventh District in the 1991 plan closely resembled the
Eleventh District in the precleared plan, which has been
found improper. The ACLU submitted four plans. One of
these, ACLU 1A, with two majority-black districts, was
known as the "least change" plan because it was designed to
make the minimal changes perceived to be necessary to correct constitutional defects in the existing plan. Another of
the ACLU plans, Abrams A, had three majority-black districts. Abrams A split nine counties in the Second District
and three in the Eleventh, and for racial reasons. Yet another plan, Abrams C, had two majority-black districts.
And a plan jointly sponsored by John Lewis, a black Democratic Member of the United States House of Representatives from Georgia, and Newt Gingrich, a white Republican

Opinion of the Court
Member--the Lewis-Gingrich Amici-R plan--contained twomajority-black districts. In response, it is said, to a submission by plaintiffs, the Justice Department submitted its"Illustrative Plan." The Justice Department did not do
so, however, until after the evidence closed. The plan contained two majority-black districts and split two countiesoutside the Atlanta area and numerous precincts. The

plaintiffs objected to the submission. The District Courtmentioned the Illustrative Plan in its opinion but did not
give an explicit ruling on the objection. The late submissionprevented the Justice Department's demographer from being
cross-examined about racial motivations, and for this reason
its significance must be discounted.

The District Court considered the plans submitted by the
various parties and then adopted its own. See Appendix,
fig. 3. Noting the Justice Department's thorough "subversion of the redistricting process" since the 1990 census, it
based its plan on the State's 1972 and 1982 plans. 922
F. Supp., at 1563. The court first had to decide where to
locate the new Eleventh District, and did so in an area of
significant population growth near Atlanta, so as to displace
the fewest counties. It then considered Georgia's traditional redistricting principles based on maintaining: district
cores, four traditional "corner districts" in the corners of the
State, political subdivisions such as counties and cities, and
an urban majority-black district in the Atlanta area. Protecting incumbents from contests with each other was another factor, which the court subordinated to the others because it was "inherently more political." Id., at 1565. The
District Court stated that, in fashioning a remedy, it considered the possibility of creating a second majority-black district but decided doing so would require it to "subordinate
Georgia's traditional districting policies and consider race
predominantly, to the exclusion of both constitutional norms
and common sense." Id., at 1566. Georgia did not have a
black population of sufficient concentration to allow creation

Opinion of the Court
of a second majority-black district, the court found, addingthat if it had the court "would have included one since Georgia's legislature probably would have done so." Id., at 1567,n. 16. The resulting plan contained one majority-black district, the Fifth. The plan split no counties outside the At-lanta area. The District Court rejected potential objections
to the plan based on $$ 2 and 5 of the Voting Rights Act andthe constitutional requirement of one person, one vote.

B
Given this background, appellants say, the District Court'splan violates our direction in

Upham v. Seamon to takeaccount of legislative preferences. In Upham, the District

Court considered a reapportionment plan passed by theTexas Legislature. The Attorney General had objected
under $ 5 of the Voting Rights Act to a specific part of theplan, namely, the lines drawn for two contiguous districts in
south Texas. He had approved the other 25 districts. Thetrial court, required to draw new lines, redrew not just the
two districts found objectionable and their neighbors but alsosome unrelated districts in Dallas County, hundreds of miles
to the north. 456 U. S., at 38. In the absence of a findingthat the legislature's reapportionment plan offended either
the Constitution or the Voting Rights Act, we held, the Dis-trict Court "was not free . . . to disregard the political program" of the state legislature. Id., at 43. See also Whitev. Weiser, 412 U. S. 783, 797 (1973).

The instant action presents a quite different situation fromUpham, and for several reasons. In the first place, the precleared plan is not owed Upham deference to the extent theplan subordinated traditional districting principles to racial
considerations. Upham called on courts to correct--not fol-low--constitutional defects in districting plans. 456 U. S.,
at 43. In Miller, we found that when the Georgia Legisla-ture yielded to the Justice Department's threats, it also
adopted the Justice Department's entirely race-focused ap521US1 Unit: $U75 [11-17-99 14:36:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN
86 ABRAMS v. JOHNSON

Opinion of the Court
proach to redistricting--the max-black policy. 515 U. S., at917-918. Using the precleared plan as the basis for a remedy would validate the very maneuvers that were a majorcause of the unconstitutional districting.

Second, the constitutional violation here affects a large
geographic area of the State; any remedy of necessity mustaffect almost every district. In

Upham, only 2 contiguous
districts out of 27 were in violation. Here, as the DistrictCourt pointed out, 2 of 11 districts were found unconstitutional, on opposite sides of the State, districts containing be-tween them all or parts of nearly a third of Georgia's counties. 922 F. Supp., at 1561. Almost every major population
center in Georgia was split along racial lines. Under the
circumstances, the District Court was justified in making
substantial changes to the existing plan consistent with
Georgia's traditional districting principles, and considering
race as a factor but not allowing it to predominate. This
approach conforms to the rule explained in Upham.

Appellants' most specific objection under Upham is that
the court's plan does not contain two majority-black districts.
In particular, they point to the State's original 1991 redistricting plan, denied preclearance, which contained two
majority-black districts. As we have suggested above, however, the State was subjected to steady Justice Department
pressure to create the maximum number of majority-black
districts, and there is considerable evidence the State was
predominantly driven by this consideration even in developing its 1991 plan. In support of their position, appellants
rely on broad assertions in the State's brief in this Court in
Johnson v. Miller that the original plan "was not perceived
as a `racial gerrymander.' " Brief for Miller Appellants in
Miller v. Johnson, O. T. 1994, No. 94-631, p. 49. Against
these assertions, appellees point to the testimony of Ms.
Meggers, Director of Reapportionment Services for the
Georgia General Assembly, that the second majority-black
district was originally designed as a concession to the Justice

Opinion of the Court
Department's max-black policy. After being presented witha proposed map of the Eleventh District, "[t]he initial response in our office was that's ridiculous." "It was said thatit doesn't make any sense and I said maybe not, but . . . we
may get in trouble with the Justice Department if we don't
draw [it] . . . like that and I think that was . . . the mainreason" it was originally drawn. Tr. 431-432 (Oct. 30, 1995).

Ms. Meggers referred to an "understanding" between theleadership in the legislature and the black caucus that a second majority-black district would be created. Id., at 431.The testimony of several legislators indicated that any such
understanding was arrived at in the shadow of the Justice
Department's max-black goal, and that all other policies were
to give way to this racial consideration. Robert Hanner,
chairman of the House Reapportionment Committee, so indicated in his testimony. Id., at 74-75. Sonny Dixon, a member of the House Reapportionment Committee, confirmed
this account and said legislators felt pressure from the Justice Department in 1990 to create all possible majority-black
districts. Id., at 81. Thomas Murphy, Speaker of the Georgia House of Representatives in 1990 and now, said in his
deposition that the initial 1991 reapportionment plan was
based on "what we at least perceived to be the direction and
instructions of the Justice Department." Deposition of
Thomas B. Murphy, Record 22-23; see also id., at 4, 6. This
evidence all refers to development of the original 1991 legislative plan, not the 1992 precleared plan, and thus undermines the contention that the legislature's original plan
should have been controlling on the District Court.

There is strong support, then, for finding the second
majority-black district in Georgia's 1991 unprecleared plan
resulted in substantial part from the Justice Department's
policy of creating the maximum number of majority-black
districts. It is not Justice Department interference per se
that is the concern, but rather the fact that Justice Department pressure led the State to act based on an overriding

88 ABRAMS v. JOHNSON

Opinion of the Court
concern with race. Given this background, it would havebeen most problematic for the trial court to insist on retaining a second majority-black district without regard to other,neutral districting factors. The trial court did not adopt
this course. Instead, it gave careful consideration to creation of a second black district on grounds that a black votingpopulation was one factor in drawing a district; and it concluded it could not draw the second majority-black districtwithout allowing that one consideration to predominate over
other traditional and neutral districting principles, principleswhich were a valid expression of legislative policy. There is
ample basis in the record to support these conclusions. No
other plan demonstrated a second majority-black district
could be drawn while satisfying the constitutional requirement that race not predominate over traditional districting
principles. The District Court said in its opinion that "[i]f
Georgia had a concentrated minority population large
enough to create a second majority-minority district without
subverting traditional districting principles, the Court would
have included one since Georgia's legislature probably would
have done so." 922 F. Supp., at 1567, n. 16. The statements
of several witnesses support the trial court's independent
conclusion it was not possible to do so. Ms. Meggers testified that, unless race was the predominant motive, a second
majority-black district could not be drawn in Georgia. Tr.
434-435 (Oct. 30, 1995). Speaker Murphy doubted "very seriously" a second majority-black district could be drawn in
Georgia without violating the principles we laid down in
Miller. Deposition, Oct. 26, 1995, Record 24.

The court found the 1991 unprecleared plan shared many
of the constitutional defects of the precleared plan. Among
other things, it connected the south DeKalb County urban
black population with the mainly rural east Georgian minority population. 922 F. Supp., at 1563, n. 9. Indeed, the
Eleventh District in the 1991 plan in many respects was almost the geographical monstrosity it became in the pre521US1 Unit: $U75 [11-17-99 14:36:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
cleared plan. The ACLU plans were introduced at the re-medial hearing by Selwyn Carter, an employee of the

Atlanta-based private Southern Regional Council whose jobwas to draw and advocate reapportionment plans across the
South. Mr. Carter said his "basic goal" in preparing the
plans was "[t]o show that it is possible to draw a plan inwhich African American voters comprise approximately 50

percent of the voting age population of a district and at thesame time show that race was not a factor." Tr. 296 (Oct.
30, 1995). The "least-change" plan, ACLU 1A, has numer-ous flaws. Besides its high population deviation, to be discussed, the Eleventh District has an iguana-like shape betraying the same invidious purpose we condemned in Miller.
The only two plans close to the trial court's in terms of population deviation are Abrams A and the Justice Department's
Illustrative Plan. Abrams A, with its three majority-black
districts, splits nine counties in the Second District and three
in the Eleventh, as well as numerous other counties in different parts of the State. The twisted shapes of its Second and
Eleventh Districts again bear witness to racial motivation.
The Illustrative Plan splits Bibb County--a county never before split in apportionment plans--to subsume Macon's black
population. Although the Justice Department submitted
the plan after the close of evidence, and in consequence its
demographer could not be cross-examined on the question of
racial motivation, the District Court recognized its apparent
racial impetus. 922 F. Supp., at 1561, n. 4. Indeed, the Justice Department acknowledged a racial motivation at oral argument before the Court. Tr. of Oral Arg. 12, 16. The Justice Department also suggested it was proper to split Bibb
County because the mayor and city council of Macon supported splitting the county and city into different districts.
Id., at 13. Macon's alleged urge to be segregated for congressional districting purposes, however, cannot vitiate the
equal protection rights of the Eleventh District's objecting
voters.

90 ABRAMS v. JOHNSON

Opinion of the Court
Interference by the Justice Department, leading the statelegislature to act based on an overriding concern with race,

disturbed any sound basis to defer to the 1991 unpreclearedplan; the unconstitutional predominance of race in the provenance of the Second and Eleventh Districts of the 1992 pre-cleared plan caused them to be improper departure points;
and the proposals for either two or three majority-black dis-tricts in plans urged upon the trial court in the remedy phase
were flawed by evidence of predominant racial motive intheir design. In these circumstances, the trial court acted
well within its discretion in deciding it could not draw twomajority-black districts without itself engaging in racial
gerrymandering. II

The court-ordered plan is not violative of $ 2 of the VotingRights Act. We reject appellants' contrary position, which
is premised on impermissible vote dilution in the court's fail-ure to create a second majority-black district. Section 2 of
the Voting Rights Act applies to any "voting qualification orprerequisite to voting or standard, practice, or procedure . . .
imposed or applied by any State or political subdivision . . . ."42 U. S. C. $ 1973(a). On its face, $ 2 does not apply to a
court-ordered remedial redistricting plan, but we will as-sume courts should comply with the section when exercising
their equitable powers to redistrict. A violation of $ 2 oc-curs if "it is shown that the political processes leading to
nomination or election in the State or political subdivisionare not equally open to participation by members of [a racial
minority] . . . in that its members have less opportunity thanother members of the electorate to participate in the political
process and to elect representatives of their choice." 42U. S. C. $ 1973(b).

Our decision in Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S. 30 (1986),set out the basic framework for establishing a vote dilution
claim against at-large, multimember districts; we have sinceextended the framework to single-member districts. Growe

Opinion of the Court
v. Emison, 507 U. S. 25, 40-41 (1993). Plaintiffs must showthree threshold conditions: first, the minority group "is sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a ma-jority in a single-member district"; second, the minority
group is "politically cohesive"; and third, the majority "votes
sufficiently as a bloc to enable it . . . to defeat the minority'spreferred candidate." 478 U. S., at 50-51. Once plaintiffs

establish these conditions, the court considers whether, "onthe totality of circumstances," minorities have been denied
an "equal opportunity" to "participate in the political processand to elect representatives of their choice." 42 U. S. C.

$ 1973(b).

The trial court found that to create a second majorityblack district in Georgia would require subordinating Georgia's traditional districting policies and allowing race to
predominate. 922 F. Supp., at 1566. We considered the
determination in our discussion above and concluded it was
well founded. If race is the predominant motive in creating
districts, strict scrutiny applies, Bush v. Vera, 517 U. S. 952,
962 (1996), and the districting plan must be narrowly tailored
to serve a compelling governmental interest in order to survive. We have assumed, without deciding, that compliance
with $ 2 can be a compelling state interest. See, e. g., id., at
977; Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S., at 921. Here, there was
no "strong basis in evidence," Shaw v. Reno, 509 U. S., at
656 (internal quotation marks omitted), to conclude that vote
dilution, in violation of $ 2, would occur in consequence of the
court's plan. In fact, none of the three Gingles factors, the
threshold findings for a vote dilution claim, were established
here. See Bush, supra, at 976-979.

Here the District Court found, without clear error, that
the black population was not sufficiently compact for a second majority-black district. 922 F. Supp., at 1567. So the
first of the Gingles factors is not satisfied. As we have
noted before, $ 2 does not require a State to create, on predominantly racial lines, a district that is not "reasonably

compact." Johnson v. De Grandy, 512 U. S. 997, 1008 (1994).And the $ 2 compactness inquiry should take into account

"traditional districting principles such as maintaining com-munities of interest and traditional boundaries."

Bush,
supra, at 977.

The trial court also found the second and third Ginglesfactors--the extent of racially polarized voting--wanting.

In the Eleventh District inquiry, the District Court foundthat $ 2 did not justify drawing racial lines, and it discussed
evidence of racial polarization at great length. The courtfound the statistical evidence was for the most part inconclusive and conflicting, but that the State's expert, Dr. Joseph
Katz, was convincing in his refutation of Dr. Allan Lichtman,
the United States' expert. 864 F. Supp., at 1388. The court
found "a significant degree of crossover voting in Georgia
and the Eleventh District," id., at 1390, and that the record
"fail[ed] to demonstrate . . . chronic bloc voting," id., at 1392.
The court found that the average percentage of whites voting for black candidates across Georgia ranged from 22% to
38%, and the average percentage of blacks voting for white
candidates ranged from 20% to 23%. Id., at 1390. As the
court noted, "[b]lack and black-preferred candidates in Georgia have achieved many electoral victories in local and statewide elections and have received significant--occasionally
overwhelming--support from both black and white voters
within the Eleventh Congressional District." Id., at 1390-
1391. The results of the 1992 Democratic primary in the
Eleventh District suggested to the court "a general willingness of white voters to vote for black candidates": black candidates in that primary received about 55% of the white vote,
and Cynthia McKinney, a black, won the runoff against a
white with 23% of the white vote. Id., at 1391.

For the inquiry concerning the Second District and the
remedy, appellants relied exclusively on the Eleventh District trial record. After the remedy hearing, the District
Court reaffirmed its earlier findings and cited additional evi521US1 Unit: $U75 [11-17-99 14:36:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
dence of crossover voting. 922 F. Supp., at 1567. At thehearing concerning the Second District, Ms. Meggers stated

that election results in the district indicated significant whitecrossover voting, and Representative Sanford Bishop, the
black congressman elected in the Second District, agreed.
Tr. 438, 142 (Oct. 30, 1995).Appellants take issue with the District Court's assessment

of the level of white crossover voting, but argue that, in anyevent, the level of polarization the District Court found is
sufficient to satisfy the Gingles threshold. Under the cir-cumstances, we cannot say the District Court clearly erred
in finding insufficient racial polarization in voting to meet
the Gingles requirements. The results of the 1996 general
elections tend to support the District Court's earlier finding
of "a general willingness of white voters to vote for black
candidates." 864 F. Supp., at 1391. All three black incumbents won elections under the court plan, two in majoritywhite districts running against white candidates. (In Gingles, the Court indicated that incumbency is a "special
circumstanc[e]" to be taken into account in evaluating racial
bloc voting. 478 U. S., at 57. And in this action, the black
candidates' success in two majority-white districts, quite
different from their previous districts, is testimony to the
"general willingness" of whites to vote for blacks.) These
results also underscore the weakness of the Justice Department's methodology of calculating the likelihood of a blackpreferred candidate winning based on strict racial percentages. Brief for United States 27, and n. 18. The Justice
Department predicted that a black-preferred candidate
"would likely be foreclosed from winning" in the court plan's
Tenth District, and that "[t]he same result would follow even
more clearly" in the court's Fourth District, which had a
black voting age population of 33%. Id., at 27. In fact,
Representative McKinney won in the Fourth District.

Appellants argue the District Court's findings on $ 2 are
inconsistent and not owed deference, since the court held $ 2

94 ABRAMS v. JOHNSON

Opinion of the Court
required maintenance of the majority-black Fifth Districtbut not creation of a new majority-black district. The District Court found the black population in the Fifth District"is sufficiently compact and, being an urban minority population, has a sufficiently strong community of interest to warrant being a majority-minority district." 922 F. Supp., at1568. The court also said the probability of electing a candidate is below 50% when the percentage of black registeredvoters is 50%,

ibid., and therefore the percentage of black
registered voters should be kept as close to 55% as possiblein the Fifth District. (The District Court noted, however,

that it was uncomfortable using percentages of registered
voters rather than voting age population, since "that in essence condones voter apathy." Id., at 1568, n. 18.) The
court made no explicit findings about differences in the racial
polarization of voting between the Fifth and Eleventh
Districts.

We do not agree that the District Court's maintenance of
the Fifth District as a majority-black district under $ 2 indicates its $ 2 findings in reference to other districts are conflicting and not entitled to deference. The District Court
noted that maintenance of a majority-black district in the
Atlanta area--created in 1972 for compliance with the Voting
Rights Act--had become a state districting policy. Id., at
1565. Further, it is possible, although we do not express
any opinion on the subject, that changing the racial majority of the district would have violated $ 5 retrogression
principles.

Private appellants also argue no deference is due the District Court's $ 2 finding both because the court did not hold
a separate hearing on whether its remedial plan violated $ 2
and because it barred private intervention to defend the constitutionality of the Second District. We do not agree.
First, neither our precedents nor the Act require the court
to hold a separate hearing on the adequacy under $ 2 of a
remedial plan. Second, the private defendant-intervenors

Opinion of the Court
had ample opportunity to present evidence of the need for asecond majority-black district under $ 2 at the remedy hearing, in which they fully participated. The finding that ap-pellants have not shown the threshold Gingles factors for a

$ 2 violation is owed deference, and we find it not clearlyerroneous.

III
The private appellants contend the District Court's planalso violates $ 5 of the Voting Rights Act. Although the

Justice Department did not include this claim in its juris-dictional statement, it agrees with private appellants and
briefed the issue.As we noted above, $ 5 requires covered jurisdictions to
obtain either administrative preclearance by the AttorneyGeneral or approval from the United States District Court
for the District of Columbia for any change in a "standard,practice, or procedure with respect to voting," and requires
that the proposed change "not have the purpose and will nothave the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote
on account of race or color." 42 U. S. C. $ 1973c. We haveexplained that "the purpose of $ 5 has always been to insure
that no voting-procedure changes would be made that wouldlead to a retrogression in the position of racial minorities
with respect to their effective exercise of the electoralfranchise." Beer v. United States, 425 U. S. 130, 141 (1976).

The question arises whether a court decree is subject to$ 5. We have held that "[a] decree of the United States District Court is not within reach of Section 5 of the VotingRights Act" such that it must be precleared. Connor v.
Johnson, 402 U. S. 690, 691 (1971) (per curiam). The excep-tion applies to judicial plans, devised by the court itself, not
to plans submitted to the court by the legislature of a cov-ered jurisdiction in response to a determination of unconstitutionality. McDaniel v. Sanchez, 452 U. S. 130, 148-152(1981). Here, the District Court made clear it had devised
its own plan, a proposition not in dispute. In Sanchez, we

521US1 Unit: $U75 [11-17-99 14:36:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN
96 ABRAMS v. JOHNSON

Opinion of the Court
emphasized language in a Senate Committee Report sayingthat, although preclearance does not apply to court-devised

plans, " `in fashioning the plan, the court should follow theappropriate Section 5 standards, including the body of administrative and judicial precedents developed in Section 5cases.' "

Id., at 149 (quoting S. Rep. No. 94-295, p. 19(1975)). This is a reasonable standard, at the very least as

an equitable factor to take into account, if not as a statu-tory mandate.

Appellants, however, have some difficulty fixing on abenchmark against which to measure any retrogression.
Private appellants say the benchmark should be either theState's initial 1991 plan, containing two majority-black districts, or the State's "policy and goal of creating two majorityblack districts." Brief for Appellants 48. The Justice Department, for its part, contends the proper benchmark isthe 1992 precleared plan, altered to cure its constitutional
defects.Here, as we have noted above in our discussions of both
Upham and $ 2, appellants have not demonstrated it was pos-sible to create a second majority-black district within constitutional bounds. So, even were we to accept one of theirproposed benchmarks, their desired remedy would be unconstitutional. As it happens, none of appellants' proposedbenchmarks is appropriate. The private appellants' first
proposal was not in effect in Georgia because it was refusedpreclearance. It thus could not operate as a benchmark
under the Attorney General's regulations:

"In determining whether a submitted change is retro-gressive the Attorney General will normally compare

the submitted change to the voting practice or pro-cedure in effect at the time of the submission. If the
existing practice or procedure upon submission was notin effect on the jurisdiction's applicable date for coverage . . . and is not otherwise legally enforceable undersection 5, it cannot serve as a benchmark, and . . . the

comparison shall be with the last legally enforceablepractice or procedure used by the jurisdiction." 28

CFR $ 51.54(b)(1) (1996).
See also Holder v. Hall, 512 U. S. 874, 883-884 (1994)("Under $ 5, then, the proposed voting practice is measured

against the existing voting practice . . . . The baseline forcomparison is present by definition; it is the existing
status. . . . [T]here is little difficulty in discerning the twovoting practices to compare to determine whether retrogression would occur"); Reno v. Bossier Parish School Board,520 U. S. 471, 478 (1997). There are sound reasons for requiring benchmarks to be plans that have been in effect;otherwise a myriad of benchmarks would be proposed in
every case, with attendant confusion. This rule is all themore appropriate when one considers the attempt to use as
a benchmark the State's supposed policy of creating twomajority-black districts. And the Justice Department's proposed benchmark--the 1992 plan shorn of its constitutionaldefects--was also never in effect. Nor can the 1992 plan,
constitutional defects and all, be the benchmark. Section 5cannot be used to freeze in place the very aspects of a plan
found unconstitutional.The appropriate benchmark is, in fact, what the District
Court concluded it would be: the 1982 plan, in effect for adecade. 922 F. Supp., at 1569, n. 20. Appellants have not
shown that black voters in any particular district suffered aretrogression in their voting strength under the court plan
measured against the 1982 plan. Absent such proof, thereis no violation of $ 5. We reject appellants' assertion that,
even using the 1982 plan as a benchmark, the court's plan isretrogressive. They claim that under the 1982 plan 1 of the
10 districts (10%) was majority black, while under the Dis-trict Court's plan 1 of 11 districts (9%) is majority black, and
therefore blacks do not have the same electoral opportunitiesunder the District Court's plan. Under that logic, each time
a State with a majority-minority district was allowed to add

98 ABRAMS v. JOHNSON

Opinion of the Court
one new district because of population growth, it would haveto be majority-minority. This the Voting Rights Act does

not require. IV

Finally, appellants contend the District Court's plan vio-lates the constitutional guarantee of one person, one vote
under Article I, $ 2. This provision requires congressionaldistricts to achieve population equality "as nearly as is practicable." Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 U. S. 1, 7-8 (1964).Court-ordered districts are held to higher standards of population equality than legislative ones. A court-ordered planshould "ordinarily achieve the goal of population equality
with little more than de minimis variation." Chapman v.
Meier, 420 U. S. 1, 26-27 (1975); Connor v. Finch, 431 U. S.407, 414 (1977) (same). Here the District Court was not designing districts to remedy a one-person, one-vote violation,but courts should keep in mind that "absolute population
equality [is] the paramount objective." Karcher v. Daggett,462 U. S. 725, 732 (1983). Slight deviations are allowed
under certain circumstances. Chapman, supra, at 26("With a court plan, any deviation from approximate population equality must be supported by enunciation of histori-cally significant state policy or unique features");

Connor,
supra, at 419-420 (same); Karcher, supra, at 740 ("Any num-ber of consistently applied legislative policies might justify

some variance, including, for instance, making districtscompact, respecting municipal boundaries, preserving the
cores of prior districts, and avoiding contests betweenincumbent[s]").

To help in interpreting what follows, we explain a fewterms. Overall population deviation is the difference in population between the two districts with the greatest disparity.Average population deviation is the average of all districts'
deviation from perfect one-person, one-vote allocation. Ifpopulation allocation in Georgia were perfect, each district
would have 588,928 people, according to 1990 census data.

99Cite as: 521 U. S. 74 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
Here, the District Court plan has an overall populationdeviation of 0.35%, and an average deviation of 0.11%. The

plan has a lower deviation than: the 1992 plan (with its 0.93%overall deviation and its 0.35% average deviation); the 1982
plan; or "any other plan presented to the Court which was
not otherwise constitutionally defective." 922 F. Supp., at1561. Private appellants and

amici in fact proposed plans
with much higher deviations. ACLU 1A, the "least change"plan, had an overall population deviation of 0.94%; Abrams

C had an overall deviation of 0.99%; and the Lewis-GingrichAmici-R plan came in last place with an overall deviation of
1.86%. The only plans with lower overall deviations than
the court's plan were the Justice Department's Illustrative
Plan (0.19%) and the ACLU's Abrams A (0.29%), whose constitutional infirmities are discussed above.

The District Court recited in detail those state policies and
conditions which support the plan's slight deviations. The
court explained Georgia's "strong historical preference" for
not splitting counties outside the Atlanta area, 922 F. Supp.,
at 1561, and for not splitting precincts, id., at 1562. (The
court observed that some splitting of precincts was unavoidable in Cobb County because of noncontiguous annexation
patterns, and that it had split some precincts in Clayton
County to achieve lower population deviations. Id., at 1562,
n. 6.) The court acknowledged that maintaining political
subdivisions alone was not enough to justify less than perfect
deviation in a court plan. See, e. g., Kirkpatrick v. Preisler,
394 U. S. 526, 533-534 (1969) ("[W]e do not find legally acceptable the argument that variances are justified if they
necessarily result from a State's attempt to avoid fragmenting political subdivisions by drawing congressional district
lines along existing county, municipal, or other political subdivision boundaries"). The District Court, in conformance
with this standard, considered splitting counties outside the
Atlanta area, but found other factors "unique to Georgia"
weighed against it. See Chapman, supra, at 26. These in521US1 Unit: $U75 [11-17-99 14:36:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN
100 ABRAMS v. JOHNSON

Opinion of the Court
cluded maintaining core districts and communities of inter-est. Georgia has an unusually high number of counties: 159,

the greatest number of any State in the Union apart fromthe much-larger Texas. These small counties represent
communities of interest to a much greater degree than is
common, and we agree with the District Court that "such aproliferation" provides "ample building blocks for acceptable

voting districts without chopping any of those blocks in half."864 F. Supp., at 1377.

In any case, even if we had found the court plan's popula-tion deviation unacceptable, the solution would not be adoption of the constitutionally infirm, because race-based, plans
of appellants. Indeed, before this Court at oral argument
private appellants acknowledged the remedy for any oneperson, one-vote violation would not be creation of a second
majority-black district. Tr. of Oral Arg. 28-29. Rather, we
would require some very minor changes in the court's plan--
a few shiftings of precincts--to even out districts with the
greatest deviations.

That exercise, however, and appellant's objections to the
court plan's slight population deviations, are increasingly futile. We are now more than six years from the last census,
on which appellants' data is based. The difference between
the court plan's average deviation (0.11%) and the Illustrative Plan's (0.07%) is 0.04%, which represents 328 people out
of a perfect district population of 588,928. The population
of Georgia has not stood still. Georgia is one of the fastestgrowing States, and continues to undergo population shifts
and changes. U. S. Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census,
Statistical Abstract of the United States 29 (1996) (Table 28)
(showing Georgia tied for seventh place among the States in
percentage of population growth from 1990 to 1995, with
11.2% growth). In light of these changes, the tinkerings appellants propose would not reflect Georgia's true population
distribution in any event. The Karcher Court, in explaining
the absolute equality standard, acknowledged that "census

Opinion of the Court
data are not perfect," and that "population counts for partic-ular localities are outdated long before they are completed."

462 U. S., at 732. Karcher was written only two years fromthe previous census, however, and we are now more than six
years from one. The magnitude of population shifts sincethe census is far greater here than was likely to be so in
Karcher. These equitable considerations disfavor requiringyet another reapportionment to correct the deviation.

V
The task of redistricting is best left to state legislatures,elected by the people and as capable as the courts, if not

more so, in balancing the myriad factors and traditions inlegitimate districting policies. Here, the legislative process
was first distorted and then unable to reach a solution. TheDistrict Court was left to embark on a delicate task with
limited legislative guidance. The court was careful to takeinto account traditional state districting factors, and it remained sensitive to the constitutional requirement of equalprotection of the laws.

The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.

It is so ordered.

Georgia elects 11 Members of the United States House ofRepresentatives. Georgia's African-American voting age

population is just over 1.7 million, or about 27 percent of atotal voting age population of about 6.5 million. See Miller
v. Johnson, 515 U. S. 900, 906 (1995). In 1992 Georgia's Leg-islature redrew congressional district boundaries so as to
create an African-American voting age majority in 3 of 11districts. This Court held that three-district plan unconstitutional. Id., at 928. On remand, the District Court, inter
alia, drew up a new redistricting plan with one majority-minority district. Johnson v. Miller, 922 F. Supp. 1556,

1560-1561 (SD Ga. 1995). The basic legal issue before usnow is whether the District Court should have retained (not
one but) two majority-minority districts.The majority holds that the District Court could lawfully
create a new districting plan that retained only one such dis-trict. But in my view that decision departs dramatically
from the Georgia Legislature's preference for two such dis-tricts--a preference embodied in the legislature's earlier congressional district plans. A two-district plan is not uncon-stitutional. And the District Court here, like the District
Court in Upham v. Seamon, 456 U. S. 37, 43 (1982) (per cu-riam), "was not free . . . to disregard the political program of
the . . . Legislature." For that reason, and others, I dissent.

I
The majority fully understands the relevance, and the im-portance, here of this Court's Upham decision. In Upham

the Court said:

" `Just as a federal district court . . . should follow thepolicies and preferences of the State, as expressed . . .

in the reapportionment plans proposed by the state leg-islature, whenever adherence to state policy does not detract from the requirements of the Federal Constitution,

521US1 Unit: $U75 [11-17-99 14:36:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN
104 ABRAMS v. JOHNSON

Breyer, J., dissenting
. . . a district court should similarly honor state policiesin the context of congressional reapportionment.' " Id.,

at 41 (quoting White v. Weiser, 412 U. S. 783, 794-795(1973)).

The majority here, referring to this language, agrees:

"[A] court, as a general rule, should be guided by thelegislative policies underlying the existing plan, to the

extent those policies do not lead to violations of the Con-stitution or the Voting Rights Act."

Ante, at 79 (citingUpham, supra, at 43).

It is therefore common ground among us that the DistrictCourt should have drawn boundaries so as to leave two
majority-minority districts rather than one--unless therewas no such state policy or preference;

unless the creationof two such districts would have violated the Constitution or

the Voting Rights Act of 1965; or unless doing so simplywould have proved impractical in light of other important
districting objectives. See Upham, supra, at 41-42 (quot-ing White, supra, at 794-795). Unlike the majority, I cannot find present here any of these three countervailingjustifications.

A
No one denies that, if one looks at the redistricting plansproposed by the Georgia Legislature, one will find in them

expressions of state " `policies and preferences' " for twomajority-minority districts. 456 U. S., at 41; see also Appendix to this opinion (Appendix), 1991 Plan, infra. Afterthe 1990 Census, which increased the size of Georgia's congressional delegation from 10 to 11, App. in Miller v. John-son, O. T. 1994, No. 94-631, p. 9, the state legislature began
a lengthy political process of redistricting and consideredthe majority-minority district issue, among others.

Id., at10-14; see also Deposition of Linda Meggers, Record 11-17,

20-22, 32-33, 85 (May 6, 1994). The legislature proposedone plan in 1991 with two such districts. See Appendix,

1991 Plan, infra. When the United States Department ofJustice (DOJ or Justice Department) denied preclearance

under $ 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA), 42 U. S. C.$ 1973, the legislature proposed a second plan, which also
contained two such districts. Subsequently the legislature
proposed a third plan with three such districts--a plan ap-proved by the Justice Department but struck down by this

Court in Miller, supra.What the District Court and the majority deny is that the
"preferences" expressed in these three redistricting plansreflect the Georgia Legislature's

true preference. The District Court said that "Georgia's current plan was not theproduct of Georgia's legislative will," but rather "was tainted

by unconstitutional DOJ interference" into the "process" that
produced the plan. 922 F. Supp., at 1560. The majority re-peats the District Court's comment about DOJ's "thorough

`subversion of the redistricting process' since the 1990 cen-sus,"

ante, at 84, adds that the "State was predominantly
driven" by "steady Justice Department pressure," ante, at86, and concludes:

"Interference by the Justice Department . . . disturbedany sound basis to defer to the 1991 unprecleared
plan . . . ." Ante, at 90.
I believe, however, that the majority's conclusion--its reason
for refusing to recognize the Georgia Legislature's two-district preference--is wrong both as a matter of fact and as

a matter of law.The conclusion is factually inadequate because the testimony cited, ante, at 86-87, to show unusual DOJ pressure
in the 1991 redistricting process shows nothing unusual. It
shows only that the Justice Department told Georgia that it
must comply with the VRA, which statement Georgia legislators might have considered an exhortation to create more
than one majority-minority district. Tr. 16 (Apr. 18, 1994);

supra, at 22, 32. It also shows that the 1991
two-district plan was the result of an " `understanding' between the leadership in the legislature and the black caucus."
Ante, at 87; see also Tr. 32 (Apr. 18, 1994); id., at 431-432
(Oct. 30, 1995); Deposition of Linda Meggers, supra, at 22,32; that the 1991 "two district" plan (as the State conceded)

"was not perceived as a `racial gerrymander,' " ante, at 86(quoting Brief for Appellants Miller et al. in

Miller v. Johnson, O. T. 1994, No. 94-631, p. 49); and that the 1991 "two
district" plan (as the District Court found), "like most redistricting efforts, was the culmination of committee meetings,
public hearings, examination of various districting proposals,
and many hours spent with an extremely sophisticated computer." Johnson v. Miller, 864 F. Supp. 1354, 1363 (1994).
Indeed, much of the departmental "interference" to which
the majority refers took place after adoption of the 1991
plan, see ante, at 80; Tr. 21, 39-40, 43, 75 (Oct. 30, 1995);
Deposition of Linda Meggers, supra, at 79-80; Miller, 515
U. S., at 906-907; App. in No. 94-641, p. 16, and likely reflected departmental concern related to Georgia's voting discrimination history. See Busbee v. Smith, 549 F. Supp. 494,
500, aff 'd, 459 U. S. 1166 (1982); App. 139-140.

The majority is legally wrong because this Court has
said that a court should determine a State's redistricting
preferences by looking to the " `plans proposed by the state
legislature,' " Upham, 456 U. S., at 41 (quoting White, 412
U. S., at 794-795), not by evaluating the various political
pressures that might have led individual legislators to vote
one way rather than another (or, for that matter, by reviewing after-the-fact testimony regarding legislative intent).
Cf. Upham, supra, at 41; White, supra, at 794-795; see also

Pildes & Niemi, Expressive Harms, "Bizarre Districts," andVoting Rights: Evaluating Election-District Appearances

after Shaw v. Reno, 92 Mich. L. Rev. 483, 585-586 (1993)).
District plans, like other legislative Acts, may reflect notonly reasoned argument but also political pressures, brought

to bear by many different individuals and groups using sub-tle or unsubtle suggestions, promises, or threats of votes,
support, publicity, and even lawsuits.How can a court say that a legislative Act is legitimate--
that it reflects legislative preferences or policies--when
those who reason or cajole (or threaten suit) are farmers,
businessmen, or consumer groups, but that the same legislative Act becomes illegitimate--that it does not reflect "true"
legislative policy or preference--simply because those who
seek to persuade (or threaten suit) represent the Justice Department. One cannot say that the Justice Department's
power is any less legitimate than that exercised by the many
other groups that seek to influence legislative decisions; and
its employees' sworn duty to uphold the law would seem
more suitably characterized as a reason for paying greater
attention to its views rather than as a reason for heeding
them less. Regardless, I am not aware of any legal principle
that supports the kind of distinction (among legislative pressures) that the District Court made; and the District Court's
necessary reliance upon such a distinction, by itself, should
warrant vacating the District Court's decision.

Moreover, what reason is there to believe that Georgia's
Legislature did not "really" want the two majority-minority
districts that its earlier plans created? There is--as I indicated earlier--evidence that a number of legislators did
want two majority-minority districts. See supra, at 106.
And the legislature was aware of Georgia's long, welldocumented history of past discrimination in voting. See

in Quiet Revolution in the South: The Impact of the Voting
Rights Act, 1965-1990, pp. 67-74 (C. Davidson & B. Grofman
eds. 1994).

The Georgia Legislature was likely aware of the many unfortunate consequences that have flowed from this history.
They include the facts that, when Congress first enacted the
VRA, fewer than 30 percent of African-Americans eligible to
vote in Georgia had registered to vote, ibid., and that no
African-American had represented Georgia in Congress
since Reconstruction, App. 140, when Congressman Jefferson
Franklin Long briefly represented the State. B. Ragsdale &
J. Treese, Black Americans in Congress, 1870-1989, p. 81
(1990).

The Georgia Legislature also might have thought that
some degree of (indeed, a less than proportionate amount of)
majority-minority districting could help to overcome some of
the problems these facts suggest. Forty-two members of
Georgia's (180 member) House of Representatives themselves were elected from majority-black districts; 30 of those
members are black, 12 are white. App. 116. One hundred
thirty-eight members of Georgia's House were elected from
majority-white districts; 1 of those members is black, 137 are
white. Ibid. Forty-three members of Georgia's (56 mem521US1 Unit: $U75 [11-17-99 14:36:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ber) Senate are elected from majority-white districts; allof those members are white. Ibid. Until 1972, Georgia

had not elected any African-American Members of Con-gress since Reconstruction. 1 Reference Library of Black
America 67 (K. Estell ed. 1994). Since then, it has elected atotal of four. Sherman, Diluting Black Votes for a Stronger
Voice; Politicians Debate Impact of Remap, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Dec. 17, 1995, p. G3. Each of those Members
originally represented a majority-minority district (althoughtwo of them were recently reelected as incumbents after
boundary changes created white majorities in their districts).
Ante, at 93.These circumstances help to explain why the 1991 Georgia

Legislature might have thought that the creation of twomajority-minority districts would help overcome racerelated barriers--barriers erected by history and prejudice,reinforced by inertia and nonparticipation. Not only the
three-district plan, but also the 1991 plan and the first (un-precleared) 1992 plan suggest that that is what the legislature did think. And I can find no reason in the record notto take at face value what all the legislature's plans thereby
suggest, namely, that two majority-minority districts repre-sent a significant legislative "policy and preference."

B
The majority says that the legislature's two-district pref-erence is not owed Upham deference because a plan that

embodied that preference is (or would be) "flawed by evi-dence of predominant racial motive," ante, at 90, or based
upon race to a degree not reasonably necessary to complywith $ 2 of the VRA, 42 U. S. C. $ 1973. The majority means
that a two-district plan would be unlawful--that it wouldviolate the Constitution as interpreted in

Miller. I cannotagree.

Miller considered the constitutionality of a three-districtplan. Its five-Justice majority included one Member who

521US1 Unit: $U75 [11-17-99 14:36:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN
110 ABRAMS v. JOHNSON

Breyer, J., dissenting
subsequently made clear that, even if racial considerations"predominate" in a State's drawing of a district boundary,

that district is nonetheless lawful (because there is a compel-ling, hence redeeming, interest) if the State has "a strong
basis in evidence for concluding" that the district would otherwise violate VRA $ 2. Bush, 517 U. S., at 994 (O'Connor,
J., concurring); see also Miller, 515 U. S., at 921; Shaw v.
Reno, 509 U. S. 630, 656-657 (1993). That " `strong basis inevidence' need not take any particular form,"

Bush, 517
U. S., at 994 (O'Connor, J., concurring), and where it is pres-ent, the State "may create a majority-minority district without awaiting judicial findings," ibid.; see also Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Ed., 476 U. S. 267, 289-291 (1986) (O'Connor, J.,
concurring); McDaniel v. Barresi, 402 U. S. 39, 41 (1971).
The majority does not reject this standard. Ante, at 90-91.
And it cannot deny that there is a "strong basis in the evidence" for believing that, after the 1990 census, VRA $ 2, $ 5,
or both, required the creation of a second majority-minority
district.

As the majority agrees, $ 2 requires a second majorityminority district here, if the "totality of [the] circumstances"
suggests that racial minorities are excluded from "participat[ing] in the political process" and "elect[ing] representatives
of their choice," 42 U. S. C. $ 1973(b), and the evidence shows
that (1) the minority group "is sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority" in a second
"single-member district"; (2) the minority group is "politically cohesive"; and (3) the majority "votes sufficiently as a
bloc to enable it . . . usually to defeat the minority's preferred
candidate." Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S. 30, 50-51
(1986).

The majority discusses only these last (Gingles) requirements at any length. As to the first requirement--compactness--the plans before the District Court raised two possibilities: first, the creation of a majority-minority district in
southwest Georgia--in approximately the area labeled Dis521US1 Unit: $U75 [11-17-99 14:36:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN

111Cite as: 521 U. S. 74 (1997)
Breyer, J., dissenting
trict 2 in the court's plan (Appendix, 1995 Court Plan, infra);and second, the creation of the majority-minority district in

southeastern central Georgia--in approximately the arealabeled District 11 in the Justice Department's Illustrative
Plan (Appendix, Illustrative Plan, infra).

The first possibility could have involved a compactlyshaped district. Regardless, the DOJ's Illustrative Plan

(which the District Court considered on the merits, 922 F.Supp., at 1561, n. 4) suggests a newly drawn District 11 with
an African-American population of 54.60 percent, anAfrican-American voting age population of 51.04 percent,
and a population deviation of 0.10. (This deviation percentage--the highest in the Illustrative Plan--was still lower
than the deviation in two of the districts contained in the
Court Plan.) It suggests that the District Court's statement that "the only way Georgia could create a majorityminority district out of the minority concentrations in eastcentral Georgia was to link" rural and urban communities by
using "land bridges and appendages" similar to those used
in the unconstitutional 1992 plan, 922 F. Supp., at 1566, n. 15,
was erroneous. The proposed district is different from its
unconstitutional predecessor. It does not try to build a land
bridge linking southern Atlanta with Savannah. Cf. Miller,
supra, at 908. And its boundaries are far more regular.

Moreover, it strikes me that the District Court's finding
that a district in east-central Georgia that encompassed both
rural and urban African-American communities could not be
"compact" confuses a number of issues. Shaw v. Reno and
Miller compactness, which concerns the shape or boundaries
of a district, differs from $ 2 compactness, which concerns
a minority group's compactness. Additionally, where (as
here) the racial minority group is geographically compact,
see Appendix, Illustrative Plan, infra, the fact that communities are rural or urban has more to do with political cohesiveness--whether communities share common interests--
than with $ 2 compactness. To my knowledge, no case has

112 ABRAMS v. JOHNSON

Breyer, J., dissenting
ever held that rural and urban racial minorities cannot
together create a compact minority for $ 2 compactness
purposes. Moreover, it seems clear that rural and urban
African-American voters who live near each other might
share important common interests; and I have found nothing
in the record that suggests that the rural and urban black
voters here, living near each other, do not share many common interests--in respect to many important legislative
matters. See Karlan & Levinson, Why Voting Is Different,
84 Calif. L. Rev. 1201, 1216-1220 (1996); see also Gingles,
supra, at 64 (citing Butler, Constitutional and Statutory
Challenges to Election Structures: Dilution and the Value
of the Right to Vote, 42 La. L. Rev. 851, 902 (1982), and
S. Verba & N. Nie, Participation in America 151-152 (1972)).

The District Court considered the remaining two Gingles
factors (the minority's "political cohesiveness" and the majority's "bloc voting") under a single rubric, which the majority calls "the extent of racially polarized voting." Ante, at
92. Of course, Georgia's history, including the political results that I have mentioned before--the fact that AfricanAmerican representatives have come almost exclusively
from majority-minority districts--strongly support the
existence of that "polarization." Moreover, appellants
produced experts who testified that the percentage of District 11 white voters willing to vote for a black candidate
varied from 0 to 26 percent, while the number of black voters
willing to vote for a white candidate varied from 3 to 11
percent. App. 54-61, 69-70, 72. Other expert testimony
suggested less polarization (placing the relevant numbers at
22 to 38 percent white-for-black and 20 percent to 23 percent
black-for-white). Johnson v. Miller, 864 F. Supp., at 1390.
But that other testimony rested in considerable part on local
(and judicial, and primary) election results with multiple
candidates or other special features that discouraged racial
bloc voting, and for that reason they may have overstated

Breyer, J., dissenting
the significance of the numerical results. See App. 93-94;
Gingles, 478 U. S., at 57, nn. 25 and 26.

Regardless, as the majority says, the District Court foundthe statistical evidence inconclusive and "conflicting." 922

F. Supp., at 1567. And the District Court conceded the
existence of "some degree of vote polarization." Ibid. (Itsimply said that the "degree" was not " `alarming.' "

Ibid.)
That African-American incumbents were reelected doesnot, without more, disprove polarization.

Gingles, supra, at
75 (" `[T]he election of a few minority candidates does not"necessarily foreclose the possibility of dilution of the black

vote . . ." ' ") (quoting S. Rep. No. 97-417, p. 29, n. 115 (1982),
in turn quoting Zimmer v. McKeithen, 485 F. 2d 1297, 1307
(CA5 1973) (en banc), aff 'd sub nom. East Carroll Parish
School Bd. v. Marshall, 424 U. S. 636 (1976) (per curiam));
478 U. S., at 75 (citing S. Rep. No. 97-417, supra, at 29, n. 115)
(listing incumbency as a special factor in assessing vote
polarization).

The majority says that, despite this evidence, the District
Court's findings--of no $ 2 violation and no $ 5 violation--are
adequately supported. Ante, at 94, 97. But that is because
the District Court asked the wrong question. We need not
decide whether the evidence shows the failure to create a
second majority-minority district violates $ 2. Cf. ante, at
90-95. (Nor, for that matter, need we decide whether the
consequent reduction of such districts from 1 in 10 to 1 in 11
would, other things being equal, violate $ 5--which it might
do. Cf. ante, at 95-98.) The question is not about whether
the evidence proves $ 2 in fact requires two majorityminority districts. The question is whether the evidence is
strong enough to justify a legislature's reasonable belief that
that was so. The record rather clearly demonstrates a
"strong basis in the evidence" for believing that $ 2 or $ 5
required two majority-minority districts. The legislature
thus could very reasonably have believed that was so. And,
that is what I had believed the law, as set forth in this

521US1 Unit: $U75 [11-17-99 14:36:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN
114 ABRAMS v. JOHNSON

Breyer, J., dissenting
Court's opinions, required as legal justification for a districtthat otherwise would violate the basic predominant factor

test of Miller.This legal distinction--between whether a plan really violates $ 2 or might well violate $ 2--may seem technical. Butit is not. A legal rule that permits legislatures to take account of race only when $ 2 really requires them to do so isa rule that shifts the power to redistrict from legislatures to
federal courts (for only the latter can say what $ 2 reallyrequires). A rule that rests upon a reasonable view of the
evidence (i. e., that permits the legislature to use race if ithas a

"strong basis" for believing it necessary to do so) is arule that leaves at least a modicum of discretionary (racerelated) redistricting authority in the hands of legislators.Again (and at a minimum), the District Court's use of the
wrong test requires vacating its judgment.

C
To create a second majority-minority district is not im-practical nor would doing so significantly interfere with

other important districting objectives. The easiest way tounderstand why this is so is to look at three plans that I
have placed in the Appendix, infra. I shall call the GeorgiaLegislature's 1991 two-district reapportionment Plan A.
Appendix, 1991 Plan, infra. I shall call the one-district planadopted by the court Plan B. Appendix, 1995 Court Plan,
infra. And I shall call the two-district Illustrative Planproposed by the Justice Department Plan C. Appendix, Illustrative Plan, infra. Inspection of the three plans sug-gests that the District Court's plan (B) is very similar to the
other two (A and C) but for one critical feature, namely, thatit has one majority-minority district rather than two.

Now consider the three plans in respect to each of thefive districting considerations that the District Court called
traditional and important. They are: (a) retaining one dis-trict in each corner of the State; (b) creating an urban minor521US1 Unit: $U75 [11-17-99 14:36:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN

115Cite as: 521 U. S. 74 (1997)
Breyer, J., dissenting
ity district; (c) maintaining political subdivisions; (d) protect-ing incumbents; and (e) maintaining traditional district cores.

922 F. Supp., at 1564-1565.All three plans are identical in respect to the first two
considerations. Each maintains districts in three of the four
state corners; each creates at least one urban minority dis-trict. Plan B--the District Court's plan--is marginally superior in respect to the third criterion (maintaining politicalsubdivisions). Plan B splits six counties within the Atlanta
area but none outside the Atlanta area. Id., at 1564. PlanC splits two counties (Bibb and Muscogee) outside the Atlanta area. (Appellants, however, advance nonracial justifications for the latter splits.)

Plan C is superior to Plan B in respect to the remaining two considerations. Plan C displaces no incumbents.
Plan B displaces three incumbents (including two AfricanAmericans). Plan C maintains all district cores. Plan B
moves many more Georgians into new districts.

Plan C has certain other advantages: It maintains, as provided in the legislature's 1991 plan, 138 of Georgia's 159 counties. Plan B maintains 123. Plan C has greater population
uniformity among its districts. And, of course, Plan C provides for two majority-minority districts--the number the
legislature provided in two of its three redistricting plans.

I add one point. This is not a suit in which there are
claims of interference with the right to cast a ballot or "dilution" of the majority's vote. Cf. White v. Regester, 412 U. S.
755 (1973); Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533 (1964); and Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U. S. 339 (1960); see also Karlan &
Levinson, 84 Calif. L. Rev., at 1212-1216. Rather, the legislature's plans, insofar as they were race conscious, sought
only to prevent what the legislature could reasonably have
believed to be unlawful vote dilution--i. e., to prevent a violation of VRA $ 2, or perhaps $ 5. See Tr. 103 (Oct. 30, 1995)
(testimony of Rep. Sanford Bishop). Given this fact and
given the three sets of considerations just mentioned, I do

116 ABRAMS v. JOHNSON

Breyer, J., dissenting
not see how the majority, consistently with Upham, canaffirm the District Court's determination.

II
In other cases dissenting judges have expressed concernsthat the Court's holdings and particularly its test--"predominant racial motive"--would prove unworkable, that theywould improperly shift redistricting authority from legislatures to courts, and that they would prevent the legitimateuse (among others the remedial use) of race as a political
factor in redistricting, sometimes making unfair distinctionsbetween racial minorities and others. See,

e. g., Shaw v.Reno, 509 U. S., at 676-679 (
Stevens, J., dissenting); id., at679-687 (
Souter, J., dissenting); Miller, 515 U. S., at 929(
Stevens, J., dissenting); id., at 934 (Ginsburg, J., dissent-ing);

Bush, 517 U. S., at 1003 (Stevens, J., dissenting); id.,at 1045 (

Souter, J., dissenting); Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U. S. 899,918 (1996) (

Stevens, J., dissenting). This suit exacerbatesthose concerns.

Legislators, for example, may ask just what the words"predominant racial motive" mean. The question has no obvious answer because racial motives (here efforts to includesome additional African-American voters in a particular district) never explain a predominant portion of a district's en-tire boundary (most of which inevitably reflects county lines,
other geographical features, and sometimes even a discrimi-natory history, see App. 120-121); yet those motives always
predominate in respect to those voters (whether few ormany) whom the legislature, with consciousness of race,
places for that reason in one district rather than another.More importantly, here, unlike other cases that use somewhat similar words, the Court has not turned to other consid-erations, such as discriminatory intent, or vote dilution, or
even a district's bizarre geographical shape, to help explain,or to limit the scope of, the words themselves. Cf.

Shaw v.Hunt, supra; Regester, supra; Reynolds, supra; and Gomil521US1 Unit: $U75 [11-17-99 14:36:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN

117Cite as: 521 U. S. 74 (1997)
Breyer, J., dissenting
lion, supra. Thus, given today's suit, a legislator might rea-sonably wonder whether he can ever knowingly place racial

minorities in a district because, for example, he considersthem part of a "community" already there; because he thinks
doing so will favor the Democrats (or the Republicans); because he wants to help an African-American incumbent; be-cause he believes doing so will encourage participation in

the political process by racial minorities in whom historicaldiscrimination has induced apathy; because he believes that
doing so will help those same voters secure representativesthat better reflect their needs and desires; or simply because
he wants to see more racial minorities elected to office in a
Nation that has become increasingly diverse.

The Court has not said that the Constitution forbids the
use of race in all these instances. See Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pen~ a, 515 U. S. 200, 237 (1995); see also Shaw v.
Reno, supra, at 646-647; Miller, supra, at 920; Bush, supra,
at 1004 (Stevens, J., dissenting); Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of
Ed., 476 U. S., at 280; Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S.
469, 493-494 (1989). If the use of race as a criterion is
wrong in some, but not all, of these instances, the legislator
will need to know when, and why. And the legislator will
need a legal principle that tells him whether, or when, the
answers to such questions vary depending upon whether the
group is racial or reflects, say, economics, education, or national origin. Miller, supra, at 944-945 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting). It seems particularly difficult--without the use of
some guiding or limiting principle, such as intent, vote dilution, or even bizarre district shape--to find principled legal
answers to what, in the redistricting context, are traditionally political questions.

The decision also increases the risk of significant judicial
entanglement in the inherently political redistricting process. See, e. g., Bush, supra, at 1035-1040 (Stevens, J., dissenting); Miller, supra, at 934-935 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting); see also Growe v. Emison, 507 U. S. 25, 33-34 (1993);

in any (or all) of the circumstances listed above will simultaneously permit plaintiffs to bring lawsuits complaining aboutthe covert use of what was overtly forbidden. Any redistricting plan will generate potentially injured plaintiffs, will-ing and able to carry on their political battles in a judicial
forum. And judges (unable to refer, say, to intent, dilution,shape, or some other limiting principle) will find it difficult
to dismiss those claims--particularly if (as the majority here
says) the law deprives the legislature even of such defenses
as a reasonable belief that a particular use of race was legally required.

Nor can I find any legal principle that might constitute a
simple, administrable stopping place--a principle that could
serve the same function in this context as does the oneperson, one-vote rule in the context of reapportionment.
See Miller, supra, at 938-939 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting). A
simple "color blind" test--a test that rules out race consciousness across the board--will not work. Bush, supra,
at 1060-1062 (Souter, J., dissenting). Legislators can and
should use race consciously to prevent creating districting
plans that discriminate against racial minorities, say, by
"diluting" their votes. Cf. Adarand Constructors, Inc., 515
U. S., at 237. Moreover, this Court, recognizing the harm
caused by slavery and 80 subsequent years of legal segregation, has held that legislators, within limits, can make conscious use of race in an effort to overcome the present effects
of past discrimination. Ibid.; see also Shaw v. Reno, supra,
at 646-647; Miller, 515 U. S., at 920. There may be other
instances as well. Further, any test that applied only to
race, ignoring, say, religion or national origin, would place at
a disadvantage the very group, African-Americans, whom
the Civil War Amendments sought to help, see id., at 936-

Breyer, J., dissenting
938 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting). But judicial administrationof a test that applied to all such voter group characteristics

would involve courts yet more deeply in the basically politi-cal task of drawing and redrawing district boundaries.

In focusing on these practical considerations, I repeat whatprevious dissents have argued. I do so because the holding
here underscores the problems mentioned in those earlierdissents; and those problems, in turn, cast further doubt
upon the soundness of today's decision.

III
I do not necessarily agree or disagree with those otheraspects of the majority's opinion that I have not mentioned.

But I shall stop with the main point. The Court, perhapsby focusing upon what it considered to be unreasonably pervasive positive use of race as a redistricting factor, hascreated a legal doctrine that will unreasonably restrict legislators' use of race, even for the most benign, or antidiscrimi-natory, purposes. And that doctrine will draw the Court
too deeply into an area of legislative responsibility. For thereasons set forth here, and in previous dissenting opinions, I
do not believe that the Constitution embodies the doctrinethat the majority enunciates. And I believe that Upham
requires us to vacate the District Court's judgment andremand the suit.

121OCTOBER TERM, 1996
Syllabus

METROPOLITAN STEVEDORE CO. v. RAMBO et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 96-272. Argued March 17, 1997--Decided June 19, 1997
Respondent Rambo, injured while doing longshore work for petitioner

Metropolitan Stevedore Company, received a compensation award under
the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA or
Act), based on the parties' stipulation that he had sustained permanent
partial disability. After Rambo acquired new skills as a longshorecrane operator and began making about three times his preinjury earnings, Metropolitan moved to modify his LHWCA award. Despite an
absence of evidence that Rambo's physical condition had improved, the
Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) ordered his benefits discontinued because of his increased earnings. The Benefits Review Board affirmed,
but the Ninth Circuit reversed on the ground that LHWCA $ 22 authorizes modification of an award only for changed physical conditions. This
Court in turn reversed in Metropolitan Stevedore Co. v. Rambo, 515
U. S. 291, holding that the Act's fundamental purpose is economic, to
compensate employees for wage-earning capacity lost because of injury;
where that capacity has been reduced, restored, or improved, the basis
for compensation changes and the statutory scheme allows for modification, id., at 296-298, even without any change in physical condition, id.,
at 301. On remand, the Ninth Circuit again reversed the order discontinuing compensation. It recognized that when a worker suffers a significant physical impairment without experiencing a present loss of
earnings, there may be serious tension between $ 8(h)'s mandate to account for disability's future effects in determining wage-earning capacity (and thus entitlement to compensation), and $ 22's prohibition against
issuing any new order to pay benefits more than one year after compensation ends or an award denial is entered. The court reconciled the two
provisions by reading the Act to authorize a present nominal award
subject to later modification if conditions should change. It held that
the order discontinuing benefits was based on the ALJ's overemphasis
on Rambo's current status and failure to consider his permanent partial
disability's effect on his future earnings, and remanded the case for

Syllabus
earning capacity under current circumstances, but there is a significant
potential that the injury will cause diminished capacity under future
conditions. The Act refers to compensable economic harm as "disability," defining that term as the measure of earning capacity lost as a
result of work-related injury, $ 2(10). Section 8(c)(21) sets compensation for permanent partial disability due to unscheduled injuries at a
percentage of the difference between the worker's average weekly preinjury wages and his wage-earning capacity thereafter, while $ 8(h) explains that such capacity is to be determined by the worker's actual
earnings if they fairly and reasonably represent that capacity; if not, the
factfinder may, "in the interest of justice," fix such capacity as shall be
"reasonable," having due regard for, inter alia, "the effect of disability
as it may naturally extend into the future." A problem in applying
these provisions arises in the situation here at issue, where a worker
presently earning at least as much as before his injury, but having a
basis to anticipate that a future combination of the injury and jobmarket conditions will leave him with a lower earning capacity, must
nevertheless file his disability claim within a year of the injury under

$ 13(a). If the worker is awarded no compensation, $ 22 will bar him
from seeking a modification in response to future changes in condition
after one year. To implement $ 8(h)'s mandate in this class of cases,
"disability" must be read broadly enough to cover loss of capacity not
just as a product of the worker's injury and present job market conditions, but as a potential product of injury and market opportunities in
the future. Thus, a potential disability is treated as a present disability,
albeit a presently nominal one. It is "reasonable" and "in the interest
of justice" (to use $ 8(h)'s language) to reflect merely nominal current
disability with a correspondingly nominal award. Ordering nominal
compensation holds open the possibility of a modification upward under

$ 22 if in the future circumstances so warrant. This approach is consistent with the wait-and-see approach the Act adopts generally with respect to benefits modification questions, and is the best way to reconcile

$ 8(h)'s mandate to consider future effects with the requirements of

$$ 13(a) and 22. The Court's view on this point coincides with, and is
reinforced by, the position of the Director of the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP), who is charged with administering the
Act. It would be imprudent for the Court to attempt to resolve for all
time the question of how high the potential for disability need be to be
recognized as nominal, since that issue was not addressed by the parties.
Those lower courts to have dealt with the matter have required a showing of a significant possibility of a future decline in wage-earning capacity, and, in the absence of rulemaking by the OWCP on the point, the
Court adopts that standard. Pp. 126-138.

Opinion of the Court
2. Although the Ninth Circuit adopted the correct legal standard, it
erred in directing entry of a nominal award based on its own appraisal
of the evidence, rather than remanding the case to the ALJ for further
findings of fact. Since the ALJ is the factfinder under the Act, see

$$ 21(b)(3), (c), it is the ALJ's duty, not the Court of Appeals's, to consider whether a future decline in Rambo's earning capacity is sufficiently
likely to justify nominal compensation. The ALJ failed to do so.

124 METROPOLITAN STEVEDORE CO. v. RAMBO

Opinion of the Court

I
Respondent John Rambo injured his back and leg in 1980
while doing longshore work for petitioner Metropolitan Stevedore Company. Rambo claimed against Metropolitan for
compensation under the Longshore and Harbor Workers'
Compensation Act (LHWCA or Act), 44 Stat. 1424, as
amended, 33 U. S. C. $ 901 et seq., and the parties stipulated
that Rambo had sustained a 221/2% permanent partial disability, which would normally reflect a $120.24 decline in his preinjury $534.38 weekly wage. This, in turn, was reduced to
an award of $80.16 per week under $ 8(c)(21) of the Act, 33
U. S. C. $ 908(c)(21), providing for compensation at the rate
of 662/3% of the difference between an employee's preinjury
wages and postinjury wage-earning capacity. An Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) entered an order incorporating this
stipulated award. App. 51; Metropolitan Stevedore Co. v.
Rambo (Rambo I), 515 U. S. 291, 293 (1995).

Rambo was later trained as a longshore crane operator and
got full-time work with his new skills, with occasional stints
as a heavy-truck operator to earn extra pay. His resulting
annual earnings between 1985 and 1990 were about three
times what he had made before his injury. As a consequence, Metropolitan moved in 1989 to modify Rambo's earlier disability award, see $ 22, 33 U. S. C. $ 922, and a hearing
was held before an ALJ. While there was no evidence that
Rambo's physical condition had improved, the ALJ ordered
the disability payments discontinued based on the tripling of
Rambo's preinjury earnings:

"After taking into consideration the increase in wages
due to the rate of inflation and any increase in salary for
the particular job, it is evident that [Rambo] no longer
has a wage-earning capacity loss. Although [Rambo]
testified that he might lose his job at some future time,
the evidence shows that [Rambo] would not be at any

Opinion of the Court
greater risk of losing his job than anyone else. More-over, no evidence has been offered to show that [Rambo's] age, education, and vocational training are suchthat he would be at greater risk of losing his present job
or in seeking new employment in the event that heshould be required to do so. Likewise, the evidence
does not show that [Rambo's] employer is a beneficentone. On the contrary, the evidence shows that [Rambo]
is not only able to work full time as a crane operator,but that he is able to work as a heavy lift truck operator
when the time is available within which to do so."App. 55.

See also Rambo I, supra, at 293-294.The Benefits Review Board affirmed the modification
order, App. 57, 61, but the Court of Appeals for the NinthCircuit reversed on the ground that $ 22 authorizes modification of an award only for changed physical conditions, Rambov. Director, OWCP, 28 F. 3d 86 (1994). We in turn reversed
in Rambo I, holding that "[t]he fundamental purpose of theAct is to compensate employees (or their beneficiaries) for
wage-earning capacity lost because of injury; where thatwage-earning capacity has been reduced, restored, or improved, the basis for compensation changes and the statutoryscheme allows for modification." 515 U. S., at 298. Since
the essence of wage-earning capacity is economic, not physi-cal,

id., at 296-298, that capacity may be affected "even with-out any change in the employee's physical condition," id.,

at 301.On remand, the Court of Appeals again reversed the order
discontinuing compensation payments. It recognized thatwhen a worker suffers a significant physical impairment
without experiencing a present loss of earnings, there maybe serious tension between the statutory mandate to account
for future effects of disability in determining a claimant'swage-earning capacity (and thus entitlement to compensa521US1 Unit: $U76 [11-17-99 14:54:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tion), see $ 8(h), 33 U. S. C. $ 908(h), and the statutory prohi-bition against issuing any new order to pay benefits more

than one year after compensation ends or an order is entereddenying an award, see $ 22, 33 U. S. C. $ 922. The Court of
Appeals reconciled the two provisions by reading the statuteto authorize a present nominal award subject to later modification if conditions should change. Rambo v. Director,
OWCP, 81 F. 3d 840, 844 (1996). The court reversed theorder ending Rambo's benefits as unsupported by substantial

evidence, due to "overemphasi[s on] Rambo's current statusand fail[ure] to consider the effect of Rambo's permanent partial disability on his future earnings," ibid., and it remandedfor entry of a nominal award reflecting Rambo's permanent
partial disability, id., at 845.1 We granted certiorari. 519U. S. 1002 (1996). While we agree that nominal compensation may be awarded under certain circumstances despitethe worker's present ability to earn more than his preinjury
wage, we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals di-recting entry of such an award and remand for factfinding
by the ALJ. II

The LHWCA authorizes compensation not for physical in-jury as such, but for economic harm to the injured worker
from decreased ability to earn wages. See Rambo I, supra,at 297-298. The Act speaks of this economic harm as "disability," defined as the "incapacity because of injury to earnthe wages which the employee was receiving at the time of
injury in the same or any other employment," $ 2(10), 33U. S. C. $ 902(10). Such incapacity is conclusively presumed
for certain enumerated or "scheduled" injuries, which arecompensated at 66

2/3% of the worker's preinjury wages over

specified periods of time. See $$ 8(c)(1)-8(c)(20), 8(c)(22),33 U. S. C. $$ 908(c)(1)-908(c)(20), 908(c)(22);

Opinion of the Court
grams, 449 U. S. 268, 269 (1980). For other, so-called "un-scheduled" injuries resulting in less than total disability, the

Act sets compensation at "662/3 per centum of the differencebetween the average weekly [preinjury] wages of the employee and the employee's wage-earning capacity there-after." $ 8(c)(21), 33 U. S. C. $ 908(c)(21) (permanent partial
disability); see also $ 8(e), 33 U. S. C. $ 908(e) (temporary partial disability). For figuring this difference, $ 8(h) explainsthat the claimant's postinjury "wage-earning capacity" is to

be determined

"by his actual earnings if such actual earnings fairly and
reasonably represent his wage-earning capacity: Provided, however, That if the employee has no actual earnings or his actual earnings do not fairly and reasonablyrepresent his wage-earning capacity, the deputy commissioner may, in the interest of justice, fix such wage-earning capacity as shall be reasonable, having due regard to the nature of his injury, the degree of physicalimpairment, his usual employment, and any other factors or circumstances in the case which may affect his
capacity to earn wages in his disabled condition, includ-ing the effect of disability as it may naturally extend

into the future." $ 8(h), 33 U. S. C. $ 908(h).
See also $ 10, 33 U. S. C. $ 910 (method for determining prein-jury wages). See generally

Rambo I, 515 U. S., at 297-298.
We may summarize these provisions and their implications
this way. Disability is a measure of earning capacity lost asa result of work-related injury. By distinguishing between

the diminished capacity and the injury itself, and by defining
capacity in relation both to the injured worker's old job and
to other employment, the statute makes it clear that disability is the product of injury and opportunities in the job
market. Capacity, and thus disability, is not necessarily
reflected in actual wages earned after injury, see id., at
300-301; Potomac Elec. Power, supra, at 272, n. 5, and when

Opinion of the Court
it is not, the factfinder under the Act must make a determi-nation of disability that is "reasonable" and "in the interest

of justice," and one that takes account of the disability'sfuture effects, $ 8(h).

In some cases a disparity between the worker's actual
postinjury wages and his job-market capacity will be obvi-ous, along with the reasons for it. If a disabled worker with

some present capacity chooses not to work at all, or to workat less than his capacity, a windfall is avoided by determining
present disability and awarding a benefit accordingly. See,
e. g., Penrod Drilling Co. v. Johnson, 905 F. 2d 84, 87-88
(CA5 1990). At the other extreme, a worker with some
present disability may nonetheless be fortunate enough to
receive not merely the market wages appropriate for his diminished capacity, but full preinjury wages (say, because an
employer is generous, for whatever reason). See, e. g., Travelers Ins. Co. v. McLellan, 288 F. 2d 250, 251 (CA2 1961); see
also Edwards v. Director, OWCP, 999 F. 2d 1374, 1375-1376
(CA9 1993) (holding that wages from short-lived employment
do not represent actual earning capacity on open market).
Once again, the present disability may still be calculated and
a corresponding award made.

A problem in applying the provisions applicable when
there is a disparity between current wages and wageearning capacity arises in a case like this one, however. The
worker now receives appropriate market wages as high or
higher than those before his injury, thus experiencing no
decline in present capacity. And yet (we assume for now)
there is some particular likelihood that in the future the combination of injury and market conditions may leave him with
a lower capacity. The question is whether such a person is
presently disabled within the meaning of the statute, and if
so, what provision should be made for the potential effects
of disability in the future.

There are two reasons to treat such a person as presently
disabled under the statute. The first follows from the provi521US1 Unit: $U76 [11-17-99 14:54:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN

129Cite as: 521 U. S. 121 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
sion of law that on its face bars an injured worker from wait-ing for adverse economic effects to occur in the future before

bringing his disability claim, which generally must be filedwithin a year of injury. $ 13(a), 33 U. S. C. $ 913(a); Pillsbury v. United Engineering Co., 342 U. S. 197 (1952). He isalso barred from seeking a new, modified award after one
year from the date of any denial or termination of benefits.$ 22, 33 U. S. C. $ 922. Because an injured worker who has
a basis to anticipate wage loss in the future resulting from acombination of his injury and job-market opportunities must
nonetheless claim promptly, it is likely that Congress in-tended "disability" to include the injury-related potential for
future wage loss.2 And because a losing claimant loses forall time after one year from the denial or termination of benefits, it is equally likely that Congress intended such a claim-ant to obtain some award of benefits in anticipation of the
future potential loss.

2 A different conclusion might, perhaps, be drawn from our observation
46 years ago in Pillsbury, 342 U. S., at 198-199, that the agency allowed
claims to be filed within one year of injury but before recovery for present
disability could be had. If that practice were assumed to be authorized
by the Act, an injured worker who anticipated future loss of earning capacity could file a claim within the 1-year period permitted by $ 13(a) yet
defer litigation of the claim indefinitely until a capacity loss manifested
itself, thereby undercutting our inference from the limitations provision
that present disability must be conceived as including the potential for
future decline in capacity. But it seems unlikely that when Congress
enacted $ 13(a) it intended workers to be able to file claims before they
could establish all the elements entitling them to compensation. Moreover, while the practical effect of permitting protective filings and indefinitely deferring adjudication is in one respect the same as awarding nominal compensation when there is a significant possibility of future capacity
loss, in that both approaches hold open the possibility of compensating a
worker when the potential future economic effects of his injury actually
appear, the former approach, unlike the latter, has the defect of putting
off the adjudication of every element of the worker's claim, including such
matters as the work-related nature of the injury, until long after the evidence grows stale. We therefore think that the inference we draw from
the limitations provision is the better one.

130 METROPOLITAN STEVEDORE CO. v. RAMBO

Opinion of the Court
This conclusion is confirmed by the provision of $ 8(h) thatin cases of disparity between actual wages and earning capacity, the natural effects of disability that will occur in thefuture must be given "due regard" as one of the "factors
or circumstances in the case which may affect [a claimant's]capacity to earn wages in his disabled condition." Although
this mandate is phrased in general terms, its practical effectis limited to the class of cases at issue here, where the
worker is presently able to earn at least as much as beforehis injury. In all other cases, when injury depresses the
claimant's wage-earning capacity under the conditions pre-vailing at the time of an award, so that the present effects
of his disability are unquestionably compensable immedi-ately, the Act already makes provision for the future effects
of disability by means of $ 22, which liberally permits modi-fication of awards in response to changed conditions that
occur within one year of the last payment of compensation(or a denial or termination of benefits). 33 U. S. C. $ 922.
Rambo I held that this provision allows modification when-ever a changed combination of training and economic (let
alone physical) circumstances reduces, restores, or improveswage-earning capacity. 515 U. S., at 296-297.

3 Since ongoing awards may be modified if future possibilities becomepresent realities, there is no need to account for such possibilities in calculating a worker's immediately compensabledisability; the Act plainly takes a wait-and-see approach to
future contingencies here.4 The first award in this case was

3 As we noted in Rambo I, however, not every fluctuation in actual
wages is a ground for modification, but only those shifts reflecting a
change in the worker's underlying capacity, see 515 U. S., at 300-301, such
as a change in physical condition, skill level, or the availability of suitable
jobs. "There may be cases raising difficult questions as to what constitutes a change in wage-earning capacity, but we need not address them
here." Ibid.

4 In liberally permitting modification, the Act resembles virtually all

other workers' compensation schemes. See 3 A. Larson & L. Larson, Law
of Workmen's Compensation $ 81.10, p. 15-1045 (1996). "[I]t is one of the

Opinion of the Court
a standard illustration of the proper practice of basing capac-ity determinations and compensation awards on present reality. If Rambo's initial award had already been discountedto reflect the odds of his obtaining less strenuous but higher
paying work in the future, Rambo I could hardly have heldthat the Act permitted reduction of that initial award again
when Rambo actually received training as a crane operatorand found work using his new skills. The first award simply
reflected the degree of diminished capacity operative at thetime it was made, and it was proper to revise it when conditions changed.Thus, if $ 8(h)'s admonition to consider future effects when
calculating capacity has any practical application, it must bebecause it may apply in a case such as this one, in which
there is no present wage loss and would thus be no presentaward if compensation were to be based solely on present
employment conditions. If the future were ignored andcompensation altogether denied whenever present earning
capacity had not (yet) declined, $ 22 would bar modificationin response to future changes in condition after one year.

main advantages of the reopening device [in workers' compensation
schemes] that it permits a commission to make the best estimate of disability it can at the time of the original award, although at that moment it
may be impossible to predict the extent of future disability, without having
to worry about being forever bound by the first appraisal." Id., $ 81.31(a),
at 15-1127 to 15-1132 (footnotes omitted).

The need for finality in workers' compensation awards is further reduced because compensation is paid periodically over the life of the disability, rather than in a lump sum, see $$ 14(a), (b), 33 U. S. C. $$ 914(a), (b)
(providing for periodic payment of compensation). Thus, modifying a
worker's compensation award generally affects future payments only,
rather than retroactively adjusting a prior lump-sum payment. "Under
the typical award in the form of periodic payments . . . , the objectives of
[workers' compensation] legislation are best accomplished if the commission can increase, decrease, revive, or terminate payments to correspond
to a claimant's changed condition," subject, under most such laws, to
certain time limitations. 3 Larson, Law of Workmen's Compensation

132 METROPOLITAN STEVEDORE CO. v. RAMBO

Opinion of the Court
To implement the mandate of $ 8(h) in this class of cases,then, "disability" must be read broadly enough to cover loss

of capacity not just as a product of the worker's injury andpresent market conditions, but as a potential product of injury and market opportunities in the future. There must, inother words, be a cognizable category of disability that is
potentially substantial, but presently nominal in character.There being, then, a need to account for potential future
effects in a present determination of wage-earning capacity(and thus disability) when capacity does not immediately decline, the question is which of two basic methods to chooseto do this. The first would be to make a one-time calculation
of a periodic benefit following the approach of the commonlaw of torts, which bases lump-sum awards for loss of future
earnings on an estimate of "the difference . . . between thevalue of the plaintiff 's services as they will be in view of the
harm and as they would have been had there been no harm."Restatement (Second) of Torts $ 924, Comment d, p. 525
(1977). This predictive approach ordinarily requires consid-eration of every possible variable that could have an impact
on ability to earn, including "[e]nvironmental factors such asthe condition of the labor market, the chance of advancement
or of being laid off, and the like." 4 F. Harper, F. James, &O. Gray, Law of Torts $ 25.8, pp. 550-551 (2d ed. 1986) (footnote omitted). Prediction of future employment may wellbe the most troublesome step in this wide-ranging enquiry.
As the tripling of Rambo's own earnings shows, a claimant'sfuture ability to earn wages will vary as greatly as opportunity varies, and any estimate of wage-earning potential turnsin part on the probabilities over time that suitable jobs
within certain ranges of pay will actually be open. In thesecalculations, there is room for error.

5 Cf. id., $ 25.8, at 553

5 As a simplified example of the sort of calculation that would be required under this approach, a factfinder might decide in the present case
that Rambo has a 75% chance of keeping work as a crane operator with

521US1 Unit: $U76 [11-17-99 14:54:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
(to determine lost wage-earning capacity, juries must often"use their judgment (in effect, . . . speculate)"). That juries

in tort cases must routinely engage in such difficult predic-tions (compounded further by discounting for present value)
is the price paid by the common-law approach for the finality
of a one-time lump-sum judgment.

The second possible way to account for future developments would be to do in this situation just what the Act
already does through the modification provision in the run
of cases: to wait and see, that is, to base calculation of diminished wage-earning capacity, and thus compensation, on current realities and to permit modifications reflecting the actual effects of an employee's disability as manifested over
time. This way, finality is exchanged for accuracy, both in
compensating a worker for the actual economic effects of his
injury, and in charging the employer and his insurer for that
amount alone.

Metropolitan denies that the second, wait-and-see alternative is even open, arguing that $ 8(h) gives the factfinder only
two choices: either deny compensation altogether because a
claimant's actual wages have not diminished, or, if the ALJ
concludes that the worker's current income does not fairly
represent his present wage-earning capacity, calculate the

annual earnings of $60,000, and a 25% chance of being laid off from that

job and remaining unemployed with no income because his injuries would
prevent him from performing more strenuous work, for a weighted average future wage-earning capacity of $45,000. (($60,0002.75)~($02.25)
$$45,000.) Of course, even if the factfinder somehow got the probabilities and earnings for each possible future state right, the weighted average future capacity would rarely correspond to actual developments. In
our hypothetical, Rambo's actual future capacity would be $15,000 a year
more than his predicted capacity if he kept his job as a crane operator,
and $45,000 less if he lost that job and found no other. Thus, if a compensation award were based on the weighted average, Rambo would necessarily end up either overcompensated or undercompensated, even though the
Act might meet its objectives for the system as a whole.

Opinion of the Court
extent of the worker's disability (and his consequent entitle-ment to compensation)

in toto based on all relevant factors,
including the future effects of the disability. See Brief forPetitioner 9. What we have already said, however, shows

the unsoundness of Metropolitan's two options.

The practical effect of denying any compensation to a dis-abled claimant on the ground that he is presently able to

earn as much as (or more than) before his injury would run
afoul of the Act's mandate to account for the future effects
of disability in fashioning an award, since those effects would
not be reflected in the current award and the 1-year statute
of limitations for modification after denial of compensation
would foreclose responding to such effects on a wait-andsee basis as they might arise.6 On the other hand, trying to
honor that mandate by basing a present award on a comprehensive prediction of an inherently uncertain future
would, as we have seen, almost always result in present
overcompensation or undercompensation. And it would be
passing strange to credit Congress with the intent to guarantee fairness to employers and employees by a wait-and-see
approach in most cases where future effects are imperfectly
foreseeable, but to find no such intent in one class of cases,
those in which wage-earning ability does not immediately
decline.7

6 The one possible escape from this conclusion rests on an implausible
reading of the Act. A claimant could, arguably, preserve a right to compensation in the future by reapplying within the 1-year period and successively each year thereafter. See $ 22, 33 U. S. C. $ 922 (permitting modification "at any time prior to one year after the rejection of a claim"). But
this would be a strange way to administer the Act, for its very premise is
that a claimant would repeatedly file reapplications knowing his disability
to be without present effect and (on Metropolitan's theory) himself without
any good-faith claim to the present compensation sought.

7 The legislative history to the 1938 amendments to the Act, which added

$ 8(h), indicates that Congress understood that the reference to future effects in the new subsection would interact with $ 22 by allowing compensation for permanent partial disability for employees whose job opportunities are narrowed by injury but whose wages have not declined:

Opinion of the Court
There is moreover an even more fundamental objection toMetropolitan's proposed options. They implicitly reject the

very conclusion required to make sense of the combined pro-visions limiting claims and mandating consideration of future
effects: that a disability whose substantial effects are onlypotential is nonetheless a present disability, albeit a presently nominal one. It is, indeed, this realization that pointstoward a way to employ the wait-and-see approach to provide for the future effects of disability when capacity doesnot immediately decline. It is simply "reasonable" and "in
the interest of justice" (to use the language of $ 8(h)) to re-flect merely nominal current disability with a correspondingly nominal award. Ordering nominal compensation holdsopen the possibility of a modified award if a future conjunction of injury, training, and employment opportunity shouldlater depress the worker's ability to earn wages below the
preinjury level, turning the potential disability into an actualone. It allows full scope to the mandate to consider the future effects of disability, it promotes accuracy, it preservesadministrative simplicity by obviating cumbersome enquiries
relating to the entire range of possible future states of af-fairs,

8 and it avoids imputing to Congress the unlikely intent

"[Section 8(h)] provides for consideration of the effects of an injury . . .
upon the employee's future ability to earn. . . . Often an employee returns
to work earning for the time being the same wages as he earned prior to
injury, although still in a disabled condition and with his opportunity to
secure gainful employment definitely limited. . . . It is clear that in such a
case the employee's ability to compete in the labor market has been definitely affected; and, though at present the employee is paid his former
full-time earnings, he suffers permanent partial disability which should be
compensable under the . . . Act . . . .

"In a case such as that . . . , an unscrupulous employer might with profit
to himself continue the original wages . . . until the . . . right of review of
the case (sec. 22) had run, . . . thus defeat[ing] the beneficent provisions of
the . . . Act." H. R. Rep. No. 1945, 75th Cong., 3d Sess., 5-6 (1938); S. Rep.

136 METROPOLITAN STEVEDORE CO. v. RAMBO

Opinion of the Court
to join a wait-and-see rule for most cases with a predict-the-future method when the disability results in no current decline in what the worker can earn.Our view, as it turns out, coincides on this point with the
position taken by the Director of the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP), who is charged with the ad-ministration of the Act, and who also construes the Act as

permitting nominal compensation as a mechanism for takingfuture effects of disability into account when present wageearning ability remains undiminished. See Brief for Direc-tor, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs 12-21, 24-31.
The Secretary of Labor has delegated the bulk of her statutory authority to administer and enforce the Act, including
rulemaking power, to the Director, see Director, Office of
Workers' Compensation Programs v. Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co., 514 U. S. 122, 125-126 (1995);
Ingalls Shipbuilding, Inc. v. Director, Office of Workers'
Compensation Programs, 519 U. S. 248, 262-263 (1997), and
the Director's reasonable interpretation of the Act brings at
least some added persuasive force to our conclusion, see, e. g.,
Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U. S. 134, 140 (1944) (giving
weight to agency's persuasive interpretation, even when
agency lacks "power to control"); Robinson v. Shell Oil Co.,
519 U. S. 337, 345-346 (1997).

There is, of course, the question of how high the potential
for disability need be to be recognized as nominal, but that
is an issue not addressed by the parties, and it would be
imprudent of us to address it now with any pretense of settling it for all time. Here it is enough to recall that in those
cases where an injury immediately depresses ability to earn
wages under present conditions, the payment of actual compensation holds open the option of modification under $ 22
even for future changes in condition whose probability of occurrence may well be remote at the time of the original
award. Consistent application of the Act's wait-and-see approach thus suggests that nominal compensation permitting

Opinion of the Court
future modification should not be limited to instances wherea decline in capacity can be shown to a high degree of statistical likelihood. Those courts to have dealt with the matterexplicitly have required a showing that there is a significant
possibility that a worker's wage-earning capacity will atsome future point fall below his preinjury wages, see

Hole v.Miami Shipyards Corp., 640 F. 2d 769, 772 (CA5 1981); Randall v. Comfort Control, Inc., 725 F. 2d 791, 800 (CADC1984), and, in the absence of rulemaking by the agency specifying how substantial the possibility of future decline in ca-pacity must be to justify a nominal award, we adopt this
standard.9

9 The OWCP Director argues that when the employee has the burden of
persuasion, the Administrative Procedure Act's (APA's) preponderance of
the evidence standard (see infra, at 139) requires him to show that an
injury-related future decline in wages is more likely than not to occur.
Brief for Director, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs 22-23.
The Director's position confuses the degree of certainty needed to find a
fact or element under the preponderance standard with the fact or element
to be so established, which in this case is the statistical odds that wageearning capacity will decline in the future. "The burden of showing something by a preponderance of the evidence . . . simply requires the trier of
fact to believe that the existence of a fact is more probable than its nonexistence before [he] may find in favor of the party who has the burden to
persuade the [judge] of the fact's existence." Concrete Pipe & Products
of Cal., Inc. v. Construction Laborers Pension Trust for Southern Cal.,
508 U. S. 602, 622 (1993) (internal quotation marks omitted). In other
words, the preponderance standard goes to how convincing the evidence
in favor of a fact must be in comparison with the evidence against it before
that fact may be found, but does not determine what facts must be proven
as a substantive part of a claim or defense. See Greenwich Collieries v.
Director, OWCP, 990 F. 2d 730, 736 (CA3 1993) ("A preponderance of the
evidence is . . . [e]vidence which is . . . more convincing than the evidence
. . . offered in opposition to it . . ." (internal quotation marks omitted)),
aff'd, 512 U. S. 267 (1994). Unlike other standards of proof such as reasonable doubt or clear and convincing evidence, the preponderance standard
"allows both parties to share the risk of error in roughly equal fashion,"
Herman & MacLean v. Huddleston, 459 U. S. 375, 390 (1983) (internal
quotation marks omitted), except that "when the evidence is evenly balanced, the [party with the burden of persuasion] must lose," Director, Of521US1 Unit: $U76 [11-17-99 14:54:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN
138 METROPOLITAN STEVEDORE CO. v. RAMBO

Opinion of the Court
We therefore hold that a worker is entitled to nominalcompensation when his work-related injury has not diminished his present wage-earning capacity under current cir-cumstances, but there is a significant potential that the injury will cause diminished capacity under future conditions.

III
The application of this legal standard to the case before usdepends in part on how the burden of persuasion is allocated.

Section 7(c) of the APA, 5 U. S. C. $ 556(d), which applies toadjudications under the Act, see Director, Office of Workers'
Compensation Programs v. Greenwich Collieries, 512 U. S.267, 270 (1994), places the burden of persuasion on the proponent of an order, id., at 272-281; when the evidence is evenly
fice of Workers' Compensation Programs v. Greenwich Collieries, 512
U. S. 267, 281 (1994). Thus, under the preponderance standard, proof that
a future decline in capacity is more likely than not (in the sense that the
evidence predicting such a decline is more convincing than the evidence
predicting none) would be required only if the fact of such a decline, rather
than some degree of probability of its occurrence, were a substantive element of a claim for nominal compensation, which the Director does not
maintain.

Even assuming that the Director's formally promulgated construction
of the LHWCA would be entitled to deference under Chevron U. S. A.
Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984), see
Director, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs v. Newport News
Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co., 514 U. S. 122, 134 (1995), we do not defer
to the Director's interpretation here of the APA's provision for allocating
the burden of persuasion under the preponderance of the evidence standard, for three reasons. (1) The APA is not a statute that the Director is
charged with administering. Cf. Ardestani v. INS, 502 U. S. 129, 148
(1991) (Blackmun, J., dissenting); Chevron, supra, at 842; Professional Reactor Operator Soc. v. NRC, 939 F. 2d 1047, 1051 (CADC 1991). (2) This
interpretation does not appear to be embodied in any regulation or similar
binding policy pronouncement to which such deference would apply. See
Smiley v. Citibank (South Dakota), N. A., 517 U. S. 735, 740-741 (1996); 1
K. Davis & R. Pierce, Administrative Law Treatise $ 3.5, p. 120 (3d ed.
1994). (3) The interpretation is couched in a logical non sequitur, as just
explained.

Opinion of the Court
balanced, the proponent loses, see id., at 281. On the initialclaim for nominal compensation under the Act, then, the employee has the burden of showing by a preponderance of theevidence that he has been injured and that the odds are significant that his wage-earning capacity will fall below his
preinjury wages at some point in the future. But when anemployer seeks modification of previously awarded compensation, the employer is the proponent of the order with theburden of establishing a change in conditions justifying modification. In a case like this, where the prior award wasbased on a finding of economic harm resulting from an actual
decline in wage-earning capacity at the time the award was
entered, the employer satisfies this burden by showing that
as a result of a change in capacity the employee's wages have
risen to a level at or above his preinjury earnings. Once
the employer makes this showing, $ 8(h) gives rise to the
presumption that the employee's wage-earning capacity is
equal to his current, higher wage and, in the face of this
presumption, the burden shifts back to the claimant to show
that the likelihood of a future decline in capacity is sufficient
for an award of nominal compensation. We emphasize that
the probability of a future decline is a matter of proof; it is
not to be assumed pro forma as an administrative convenience in the run of cases.

In this case, the first award of compensation was based on
the parties' stipulation that Rambo suffered 221/2% permanent partial disability as a result of his injury, whereby
Rambo established that the injury impaired his ability to
undertake at least some types of previously available gainful
labor and thus prevented him from earning as much as he
had before his accident. Metropolitan sought termination of
the award based solely on evidence, which the ALJ found
persuasive, that Rambo is now able to earn market wages
as a crane operator significantly greater than his preinjury
earnings. There is therefore substantial evidence in the
record supporting the ALJ's decision to terminate actual (as

opposed to nominal) benefits, since under present conditionsRambo's capacity to earn wages is no longer depressed. But

the ALJ failed to consider whether there is a significantpossibility that Rambo's wage-earning capacity will decline
again in the future.10 Because there is no evidence in therecord of the modification proceedings showing that Rambo's
physical condition has improved to the point of full recovery,the parties' earlier stipulation of permanent partial disability
at least raises the possibility that Rambo's ability to earnwill decline in the event he loses his current employment as
a crane operator. The ALJ's order altogether terminatingbenefits must therefore be vacated for failure to consider
whether a future decline in Rambo's earning capacity issufficiently likely to justify nominal compensation. Since
the ALJ is the factfinder under the Act, see $$ 21(b)(3), (c),33 U. S. C. $$ 921(b)(3), (c), however, the Court of Appeals
should have remanded to the agency for further findings offact, see, e. g., Randall v. Comfort Control, Inc., 725 F. 2d,
at 799-800 (remanding for consideration of nominal award),instead of directing entry of a nominal award based on its
own appraisal of the evidence. We therefore vacate theNinth Circuit's judgment insofar as it directs entry of an

10 The dissent argues that the ALJ expressly found that Rambo's present wages adequately reflect his future prospects. Post, at 148-150. In
our view, however, the language in the modification order relied on by the
dissent addresses whether Rambo's current wages accurately reflect his
earning capacity under present market conditions, see supra, at 128 (current wages do not always reflect current capacity); Edwards v. Director,
OWCP, 999 F. 2d 1374, 1375 (CA9 1993) (adopting OWCP Director's position that "earnings in post-injury employment must be sufficiently regular
to establish true earning capacity"), not the distinct question whether
there is a significant chance that his ability to earn will again decline in
the future. See App. 53 (ALJ characterized his task as "consider[ing]
wage-earning capacity in an open labor market under normal employment
conditions"). The ALJ's failure to consider the latter question is not surprising, since prior to this case there was no governing authority from
this Court or the Ninth Circuit approving nominal awards for possible
future declines.

award of nominal compensation, and remand the case forfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.
Justice O'Connor, with whom Justice Scalia and
Justice Thomas join, dissenting.

The Court holds today that an administrative law judgecan award nominal worker's compensation benefits to an injured longshoreman whose wage-earning capacity has notdropped, and probably will never drop, below his preinjury
capacity. Because I believe that $ 8(h) of the Longshore andHarbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA or Act), 33
U. S. C. $ 908(h), requires that a worker be compensated if
and only if a preponderance of the evidence demonstrates
that he has a reduced wage-earning capacity--that is, a present or future loss of earning power--I respectfully dissent.

As an initial matter, I note my agreement with some of
the starting points for the Court's analysis. It is common
ground that "disability" under the LHWCA is an economic,
rather than a medical, concept. Ante, at 126; Metropolitan
Stevedore Co. v. Rambo, 515 U. S. 291, 297 (1995). Likewise,
I agree that a worker's eligibility for compensation (i. e., his
disability) under the LHWCA turns on his wage-earning capacity, which depends on his ability to earn wages now and
in the future. That is, I agree that an injured worker who
is currently receiving high wages, but who is likely to be
paid less in the future due to his injury, is disabled under the
LHWCA and is therefore eligible for compensation today.
See ante, at 128-129.

I part company with the Court first because, in my view,

$ 8(h) of the LHWCA, 33 U. S. C. $ 908(h), requires an administrative law judge (ALJ) to make an up-front finding that
"fix[es]" the worker's wage-earning capacity (and hence his
eligibility for compensation) by taking into account both the
worker's present and future ability to earn wages. Second,

O'Connor, J., dissenting
a finding of future economic harm must be supported by apreponderance of the evidence pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U. S. C. $ 551 et seq., in order toaffect a claimant's wage-earning capacity. Finally, because I
read the ALJ's decision as expressly finding that respondentRambo will probably suffer no future loss of earning power,
and because that finding is supported by substantial evi-dence, I would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals
and direct the entry of judgment for petitioner MetropolitanStevedore Co.

I
My first point of disagreement with the Court is over howan ALJ should fix the wage-earning capacity of a worker like

Rambo, whose current wages exceed his preinjury wages,but who claims that his ability to earn money may drop in
the future. Section 8(h) of the LHWCA provides:

"The wage-earning capacity of an injured employee incases of partial disability . . . shall be determined by his

actual earnings if such actual earnings fairly and reason-ably represent his wage-earning capacity: Provided,
however, That if the employee has no actual earnings orhis actual earnings do not fairly and reasonably represent his wage-earning capacity, the deputy commis-sioner may, in the interest of justice, fix such wageearning capacity as shall be reasonable, having dueregard to the nature of his injury, the degree of physical
impairment, his usual employment, and any other fac-tors or circumstances in the case which may affect his
capacity to earn wages in his disabled condition, includ-ing the effect of disability as it may naturally extend
into the future."
The Court holds that $ 8(h) permits an adjudicator simply topostpone any determination of whether the worker will suffer a loss in earning power so long as there is a "significantpossibility" that such a loss will someday come to pass.

O'Connor, J., dissenting
Ante, at 137. Until then, the Court rules, the ALJ canaward nominal compensation, thereby propping open the

agency's door for the worker to seek modification of theaward in the future.

In my opinion, the LHWCA does not permit an ALJ to
award purely nominal benefits in order to guard against thepossibility of a future drop in earning power. Instead, the

Act requires that a future reduction in a longshoreman's abil-ity to earn money be immediately factored into a

present
determination of his wage-earning capacity. That an ALJmust make a concrete, immediate finding about a worker's

wage-earning capacity is dictated by the language of $ 8(h),
which calls for a determination whether a worker's actual
earnings "fairly and reasonably represent his wage-earning
capacity." A comparison between a worker's current wages
and his earning potential is possible only if the ALJ assigns
a dollar amount to the claimant's wage-earning capacity.
Section 8(h) further instructs that, if the worker's current
pay does not correspond to his true earning capacity, the
adjudicator must "fix such wage-earning capacity as shall be
reasonable." Again, "fix[ing]" the worker's wage-earning
capacity requires the ALJ to make a definite assessment of
whether the claimant's capacity has gone up, down, or remained the same; it leaves no room for the equivocal finding
that a worker's capacity might have changed.

The "wage-earning capacity" that an ALJ must fix is a
composite concept, measured partly by the claimant's present earning ability and partly by his future earning ability.
Accordingly, the ALJ's finding must reflect predictable
changes in the worker's ability to earn wages. Section 8(h)
lists the main factors to be taken into account: the nature
of his injury, the degree of physical impairment, his usual
employment, and the effect of the disability as it may naturally extend into the future. Thus, if an ALJ credits a doctor's testimony that a claimant can work for only five years
before his injury leaves him bedridden, that worker would

O'Connor, J., dissenting
presently have a reduced "wage-earning capacity" within themeaning of the LHWCA, regardless of whether his current

wages were as high as his preinjury wages. Just becausemarket conditions and the claimant's physical condition may
vary over time does not mean that an ALJ should not consider predicted variations when fixing the worker's wage-earning capacity. Quite to the contrary, the ALJ must consider them; otherwise, he would not be "fix[ing]" theworker's capacity at all, but simply putting off that determination for another day.Because an ALJ must make a definite finding regarding a
worker's wage-earning capacity, I disagree with the Court
that a worker can ever, for purposes of the LHWCA, have a
"nominal current disability." Ante, at 135. A worker either
has a reduced wage-earning capacity (however slight it may
be), or he does not. To say that a claimant has a "nominal
current disability," as far as I can tell, means only that he is
currently making as much as his preinjury wages. But that
answers only half the question, since the worker's future
earning potential is also relevant to whether he has a reduced wage-earning capacity today and, hence, a compensable disability.

The Court conflates a worker's foreseeable future earning
power, which must be considered when awarding benefits,
with unforeseeable future developments, which justify reopening an award under $ 22 of the LHWCA, 33 U. S. C.

$ 922. Section 22 acknowledges that a worker's wageearning capacity can change over time, since it authorizes
the Benefits Review Board to modify compensation orders in
light of a "change in conditions." All that means is that
when circumstances arise that were not predictable in the
original benefits determination, and hence were not factored
into a prior determination of a worker's wage-earning capacity, an ALJ can adjust an award. If, on the other hand,
those circumstances were predicted in the original proceeding, they should have been included in the initial fixing of

145Cite as: 521 U. S. 121 (1997)
O'Connor, J., dissenting
the claimant's wage-earning capacity. The catch is that $ 22permits recognition of changed conditions only within one

year of the denial of a claim or the last payment on an award.The Court's mechanism for awarding nominal damages is
designed solely to circumvent $ 22's 1-year limit for reopening terminated or denied claims. The Court effectively rec-ognizes as much, since it candidly admits that under its approach, "finality is exchanged for accuracy." Ante, at 133.That is, the 1-year limitations period established by $ 22 is
sacrificed in order to avoid the overcompensation and under-compensation that may result from a straightforward application of the LHWCA. Ibid. Congress has already evaluated these policy concerns, however, and has come down on
the side of finality by enacting $ 22. When a worker cannot
demonstrate a reduction in his wage-earning capacity, in
terms of his present or future ability to obtain gainful employment, $ 22 gives that employee only one year to show
that conditions have changed. To hold open a case simply
because a "change in conditions" may someday arise certainly violates the spirit, if not the letter, of $ 22.

The proper tradeoff between finality and accuracy is open
to reasoned debate. Indeed, some state legislatures have
agreed with the Court that when a worker does not immediately suffer as a result of his work-related injury, it is better
to postpone compensation until his disability manifests itself.
Accordingly, they have amended their workers' compensation statutes to allow precisely the sort of nominal-benefits
mechanism that the Court approves today. See, e. g., Cal.
Lab. Code Ann. $ 5802 (West 1989) ("If, in any proceeding
under this division, it is proved that an injury has been suffered . . . , but it is not proved that any disability has resulted, the appeals board may, instead of dismissing the application, award a nominal disability indemnity, if it appears
that disability is likely to result at a future time"). But until
Congress amends the LHWCA, I do not think that the
Court's approach is open to us. I would therefore hold that

146 METROPOLITAN STEVEDORE CO. v. RAMBO

O'Connor, J., dissenting
an ALJ cannot circumvent $ 22's 1-year limitations period by
awarding nominal compensation. He must instead make a
present determination of the longshoreman's wage-earning
capacity, taking into account both his present and future ability to earn money.

II

I further believe that the APA requires that a claimant's
future economic injury be proved by a preponderance of the
evidence before such an injury can provide a basis for awarding disability benefits under the LHWCA. This is true regardless of whether such a finding leads to an award of nominal benefits (as the Court holds) or whether such an injury
should instead be factored into a claimant's wage-earning capacity immediately (as I believe). I therefore disagree with
the Court's holding that merely a "significant possibility" of
a future drop in a worker's wage-earning potential is relevant to a present benefits determination.

As explained in Part I, the ultimate fact to be determined
in an LHWCA benefits proceeding is a worker's "wageearning capacity," which has both a present and a future
component. Thus, contrary to the Court, I think that "the
fact of such a decline [in a worker's wage-earning capacity],
rather than some degree of probability of its occurrence,"
ante, at 138, n. 9, must be shown in order to justify a finding
of disability. The Court recognizes that the APA governs
benefit determinations under the LHWCA, ante, at 138, so
that "the proponent of a rule or order has the burden of
proof," 5 U. S. C. $ 556(d); see 33 U. S. C. $ 919(d) ("[A]ny
hearing held under [the LHWCA] shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of " the APA). And this proof
must be by a preponderance of the evidence. Director,
Office of Workers' Compensation Programs v. Greenwich
Collieries, 512 U. S. 267, 270-271 (1994). It follows that
whether a worker has a reduced wage-earning capacity is a
fact to be determined by a preponderance of the evidence.

O'Connor, J., dissenting
The Court's "significant possibility" standard falls farshort of the APA's preponderance of the evidence standard.

Indeed, although the Court fails to define its standard withany specificity, it at least tells us that a "significant possibility" is certainly less than a "high degree of statistical likelihood." Ante, at 137. Thus, a longshoreman whose pay-check has not shrunk, and is unlikely ever to shrink, below

preinjury levels is apparently entitled to an award of nomi-nal damages under the Court's holding today. Such a result,
it seems to me, is exactly backwards.Not only does the "significant possibility" standard conflict
with the APA, but the Court plucks it out of thin air. The
Court seems to rely purely on its perception of "symmetry"
in the LHWCA: Where an injury immediately depresses a
worker's ability to earn wages, "the payment of actual compensation holds open the option of modification under $ 22
even for future changes in condition whose probability of
occurrence may well be remote at the time of the original
award. Consistent application of the Act's wait-and-see approach thus suggests that nominal compensation permitting
future modification should not be limited to instances where
a decline in capacity can be shown to a high degree of statistical likelihood." Ante, at 136-137. But if symmetry is the
goal, then there should logically be no threshold showing (beyond the injury itself) required to award nominal benefits
under the LHWCA. Because $ 22 permits modification of
ongoing awards even for completely unforeseeable changes
of conditions, "[c]onsistent application" of the Court's "waitand-see" theory (derived from $ 22) would call for keeping
open every case to guard against the possibility that new
events might someday reduce a worker's wage-earning capacity. The Court apparently realizes that such a result
would completely eviscerate $ 22's 1-year limitations period,
and so it feels obliged to screen out at least the most attenuated claims that conditions may change in the future. As a
stopgap, it invents the "significant possibility" test.

O'Connor, J., dissenting
This supposed "asymmetry" in the LHWCA is not some-thing to be circumvented, however, since it is attributable to

Congress' decision to place a strict 1-year time limit on thereopening of denied or terminated claims. Under the
proper interpretation of the LHWCA, a worker's wage-earning capacity is partly a function of his future ability to
earn money, as proved by a preponderance of the evidence.This preponderance standard screens out claims where a
worker cannot show a reduction in his future earning power.Accordingly, there is no need to engage in the sort of arbitrary line-drawing that brings us the "significant possibility"standard, in order to salvage some role for $ 22's 1-year limitations period. III

As a final matter, I believe that the ALJ's conclusion thatRambo "no longer has a wage-earning capacity loss," App.
55, should be upheld regardless of whether the standard forfixing a worker's wage-earning capacity is the one set forth
by the Court or the one described in this dissent.I agree with the Court that Metropolitan, as the proponent
of a modified compensation order, met its burden of demon-strating a "change in conditions" by proving that Rambo's
actual earnings had risen significantly since he began stead-ily working as a crane operator.

Ante, at 139. Upon thatshowing, $ 8(h) shifted to Rambo the burden of proving that

his new earnings did not fairly and reasonably reflect hiswage-earning capacity. Ibid. In other words, Rambo must
show that his ability to earn wages in the future is morelikely than not to dip below his preinjury levels.

In his written ruling, the ALJ gave this issue his full con-sideration. As the ALJ observed, "higher post-injury gains/
losses are not necessarily determinative of an employee'swage-earning capacity. One has to consider wage-earning
capacity in an open labor market under normal employmentconditions." App. 53 (citation omitted). The ALJ then specifically commented on Rambo's future job prospects: "Claim521US1 Unit: $U76 [11-17-99 14:54:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ant no longer has a wage-earning capacity loss. Although
Claimant testified that he might lose his job at some future
time, the evidence shows that Claimant would not be at any
greater risk of losing his job than anyone else. Moreover,
no evidence has been offered to show that Claimant's age,
education, and vocational training are such that he would be
at greater risk of losing his present job or in seeking new
employment in the event that he should be required to do
so. Likewise, the evidence does not show that Claimant's
employer is a beneficent one." Id., at 55. As I read this
statement, the ALJ found that Rambo's current earnings adequately reflected his future job prospects--that is, he found
that Rambo would not suffer any future economic loss due
to his injury.

The ALJ's findings must be upheld if they are supported
by substantial evidence. See 33 U. S. C. $ 921(b)(3) (setting
standard of review that Benefits Review Board must apply
to ALJ's findings). The substantial evidence standard is extremely deferential to the factfinder: "Substantial evidence
is more than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion." Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB, 305
U. S. 197, 229 (1938). Based on the evidence submitted by
the parties, a "reasonable mind" could undoubtedly have
found that Rambo's current earnings accurately reflected his
wage-earning capacity, with regard to both his present and
future job prospects. Rambo testified that he had learned
to operate cranes and heavy lift trucks (tasks that he can
perform despite his injury), App. 30-31; that he had worked
steadily as a crane operator for one shipping line for the last
21/2 years, id., at 37; and that his new job paid a much higher
wage than he had received before his injury, id., at 38. The
record clearly permitted a finding that, despite his injury,
Rambo "no longer has a wage-earning capacity loss." Id.,
at 55.

Because the ALJ properly found that Rambo's currentearnings reasonably reflected his wage-earning capacity, I

O'DELL v. NETHERLAND, WARDEN, et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fourth circuit

No. 96-6867. Argued March 18, 1997--Decided June 19, 1997
At the penalty phase of petitioner's state trial on capital murder, rape,

and sodomy charges, evidence was presented that he had been convicted
of a host of other offenses--including the kidnaping and assault of another woman while he was on parole and the murder of a fellow prisoner
during a previous prison stint. The court denied his request for a jury
instruction that he was ineligible for parole if sentenced to life in prison.
The jury determined that petitioner presented a future danger, and he
was sentenced to death. In subsequently granting federal habeas relief, the District Court concluded that this Court's intervening decision
in Simmons v. South Carolina, 512 U. S. 154--which requires that a
capital defendant be permitted to inform his sentencing jury that he is
parole ineligible if the prosecution argues his future dangerousness--
was not a "new" rule within the meaning of Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S.
288, and thus entitled petitioner to resentencing. The Fourth Circuit
reversed.

Held: Simmons' rule was new and cannot, therefore, be used to disturb

petitioner's death sentence. Pp. 156-168.

(a) Under Teague, this Court will not disturb a final state conviction
or sentence unless it can be said that, at the time the conviction or
sentence became final, a state court would have acted objectively unreasonably by not extending the relief later sought in federal court.
Teague requires a federal habeas court to determine the date on which
the conviction became final; to consider whether a state court considering the defendant's claim at the time it became final would have felt
compelled by existing precedent to conclude that the rule he seeks was
required by the Constitution; and if not, to determine whether that new
rule nonetheless falls within one of two narrow exceptions to the Teague
doctrine. Lambrix v. Singletary, 520 U. S. 518, 527. Pp. 156-157.

(b) Petitioner's conviction became final in 1988 and Simmons was decided in 1994. Simmons is an unlikely candidate for "old-rule" status.
There was no opinion for the Court in Simmons, and the array of views
expressed there suggests that the rule announced was, in light of this
Court's precedent, "susceptible to debate among reasonable minds."
Butler v. McKellar, 494 U. S. 407, 415. An assessment of the legal land521US1 Unit: $U77 [11-17-99 14:58:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN

scape existing at the time petitioner's conviction and sentence became
final bolsters this conclusion. Contrary to petitioner's position, the result in Simmons did not follow ineluctably from the decisions in Gardner v. Florida, 430 U. S. 349, and Skipper v. South Carolina, 476 U. S.
1. The seven opinions in Gardner produced a narrow holding that a
death penalty procedure permitting consideration of secret information
relevant to the offender's character and record--there a presentence
report not provided to the defendant--violates the Eighth Amendment.
Petitioner points to no secret evidence in his case. And the evidence
he sought to present to the jury was not historical evidence about his
character and record but evidence concerning what might happen, under
then-extant law, after a sentence was imposed. In Skipper, too, it was
evidence of past behavior that the defendant was unconstitutionally prevented from adducing. The distinction between information concerning
state postsentencing law and evidence specifically related to the defendant was also at the heart of two other cases in 1988's complex legal
landscape. In California v. Ramos, 463 U. S. 992, the Court concluded
that California had reasonably chosen to provide some, limited, postsentence information to the capital sentencing jury, namely, the possibility
of pardon. But the Court emphasized that this conclusion did not override the choices of other States not to permit their juries to be informed
of postsentencing proceedings, including parole. The general proposition that the States retained the prerogative to determine how much (if
at all) juries would be informed about the postsentencing legal regime
was given further credence in Caldwell v. Mississippi, 472 U. S. 320.
The Court determined there that the prosecution and judge had improperly left the jury with the impression that a death sentence was not
final because it would be extensively reviewed, with a plurality concluding that, Ramos notwithstanding, sentencing juries were never to be
given information about postsentencing appellate proceedings, and Justice O'Connor concluding that such information--if accurate--could
be provided. In light of these cases, it would hardly have been unreasonable for a jurist in 1988 to conclude that his State had acted constitutionally by choosing not to advise its jurors as to events that would (or
would not) follow their death sentence recommendation. Accordingly,
Simmons announced a new rule that may not be applied here unless it
falls within a Teague exception. Pp. 157-166.

(c) Simmons' narrow right of rebuttal is not a watershed rule of criminal procedure implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the
criminal proceeding under the second exception to Teague. Gideon v.
Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335, distinguished. P. 167.

95 F. 3d 1214, affirmed.

Opinion of the Court
Thomas, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Rehnquist,
C. J., and O'Connor, Scalia, and Kennedy, JJ., joined. Stevens, J.,
filed a dissenting opinion, in which Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ.,
joined, post, p. 168.

Robert S. Smith, by appointment of the Court, 520 U. S.1114, argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the

briefs were Alan Effron and Michele J. Brace.

Katherine P. Baldwin, Assistant Attorney General ofVirginia, argued the cause for respondents. With her on

the brief were James S. Gilmore III, Attorney General, andDavid E. Anderson, Chief Deputy Attorney General.

Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case presents the question whether the rule set outin Simmons v. South Carolina, 512 U. S. 154 (1994)--which

requires that a capital defendant be permitted to inform hissentencing jury that he is parole ineligible if the prosecution
argues that he presents a future danger--was "new" withinthe meaning of

Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989), andthereby inapplicable to an already final death sentence. We

conclude that it was new, and that it cannot, therefore, beused to disturb petitioner's death sentence, which had been
final for six years when Simmons was decided.

Helen Schartner was last seen alive late in the evening ofFebruary 5, 1985, leaving the County Line Lounge in Virginia Beach, Virginia. Her lifeless body was discovered thenext day, in a muddy field across a highway from the lounge.
Schartner's head had been laid open by several blows withthe barrel of a handgun, and she had been strangled with
such violence that bones in her neck were broken and fingerimprints were left on her skin. An abundance of physical
evidence linked petitioner to the crime scene and crime--among other things, tire tracks near Schartner's body were
consistent with petitioner's car, and bodily fluids recovered

Opinion of the Court
from Schartner's body matched petitioner. He was indictedon counts of capital murder, rape, sodomy, and abduction

(which count was later dismissed).After a jury trial, petitioner was found guilty on the murder, rape, and sodomy counts. During the subsequent sen-tencing hearing, the prosecution sought to establish two aggravating factors: that petitioner presented a future danger,and that the murder had been "wanton, vile or inhuman."
Evidence was presented that, prior to Schartner's murder,petitioner had been convicted of a host of other offenses, including the kidnaping and assault of another woman whilehe was on parole, and the murder of a fellow inmate during
an earlier prison stint. Petitioner sought a jury instructionexplaining that he was not eligible for parole if sentenced to
life in prison. The trial judge denied petitioner's request.After the sentencing hearing, the jury found beyond a reasonable doubt that petitioner "would constitute a continuousserious threat to society" and that "his conduct in committing the offense was outrageously wanton, vile or inhuman."46 Record 208. The jury recommended that petitioner be
sentenced to death.1 The trial judge adopted the jury's rec-ommendation and sentenced petitioner to 40 years' imprisonment each for the rape and sodomy convictions, and to deathby electrocution for Schartner's murder. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court of Virginia, which affirmedboth the conviction and the sentence. O'Dell v. Commonwealth, 234 Va. 672, 364 S. E. 2d 491 (1988). We denied cer-tiorari.

O'Dell v. Virginia, 488 U. S. 871 (1988). Petition-er's efforts at state habeas relief were unsuccessful, and we

again denied certiorari. O'Dell v. Thompson, 502 U. S. 995(1991).

1 The Virginia Supreme Court concluded that the jury's recommendation
of a death sentence was based only on the first aggravating factor--petitioner's future dangerousness. O'Dell v. Commonwealth, 234 Va. 672,
706, 364 S. E. 2d 491, 510 (1988). Only that aggravating factor is before
us.

Opinion of the Court
Petitioner then filed a federal habeas claim. He contended, inter alia, that newly obtained DNA evidence established that he was actually innocent, and that his death
sentence was faulty because he had been prevented from
informing the jury of his ineligibility for parole. The District Court rejected petitioner's claim of innocence. O'Dell
v. Thompson, Civ. Action No. 3:92CV480 (ED Va., Sept. 6,
1994), App. 171-172. But it agreed with petitioner that he
was entitled to resentencing under the intervening decision
in Simmons v. South Carolina, supra. The District Court
described Simmons as holding that "where the defendant's
future dangerousness is at issue, and state law prohibits the
defendant's release on parole, the Due Process Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment requires that the sentencing jury be
informed that the defendant is not eligible for parole." App.
198. The court concluded that the Simmons rule was not
new and thus was available to petitioner. Because the
prosecutor "obviously used O'Dell's prior releases on crossexamination, and in his closing argument, to argue that the
defendant presented a future danger to society," App. 201
(citations omitted), the District Court held that petitioner
was entitled to be resentenced if it could be demonstrated
that he was in fact ineligible for parole.

A divided en banc Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit
reversed. 95 F. 3d 1214 (1996). After an exhaustive review
of our precedents, the Court of Appeals majority determined
that "Simmons was the paradigmatic `new rule,' " id., at
1218, and, as such, could not aid petitioner. The Fourth Circuit was closely divided as to whether Simmons set forth a
new rule, but every member of the court agreed that petitioner's "claim of actual innocence [was] not even colorable."
95 F. 3d, at 1218; see also id., at 1255-1256 (Ervin, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). We declined review on
petitioner's claim of actual innocence, but granted certiorari
to determine whether the rule of Simmons was new. 519

Opinion of the Court
U. S. 1050 (1996); see also ibid. (Scalia, J., respecting thegrant of certiorari).

II
Before a state prisoner may upset his state conviction orsentence on federal collateral review, he must demonstrate

as a threshold matter that the court-made rule of which heseeks the benefit is not "new." We have stated variously
the formula for determining when a rule is new. See, e. g.,
Graham v. Collins, 506 U. S. 461, 467 (1993) ("A holding con-stitutes a `new rule' within the meaning of

Teague if it`breaks new ground,' `imposes a new obligation on the States

or the Federal Government,' or was not `dictated by prece-dent existing at the time the defendant's conviction became
final' ") (quoting Teague, 489 U. S., at 301) (emphasis in origi-nal). At bottom, however, the Teague doctrine "validates
reasonable, good-faith interpretations of existing precedentsmade by state courts even though they are shown to be contrary to later decisions." Butler v. McKellar, 494 U. S. 407,414 (1990) (citation omitted). "Reasonableness, in this as in
many other contexts, is an objective standard." Stringer v.
Black, 503 U. S. 222, 237 (1992). Accordingly, we will notdisturb a final state conviction or sentence unless it can be

said that a state court, at the time the conviction or sentencebecame final, would have acted objectively unreasonably by
not extending the relief later sought in federal court.The

Teague inquiry is conducted in three steps. First, thedate on which the defendant's conviction became final is determined. Lambrix v. Singletary, 520 U. S. 518, 527 (1997).Next, the habeas court considers whether " `a state court
considering [the defendant's] claim at the time his convictionbecame final would have felt compelled by existing precedent
to conclude that the rule [he] seeks was required by the Con-stitution.' "

Ibid. (quoting Saffle v. Parks, 494 U. S. 484, 488(1990)) (alterations in Lambrix). If not, then the rule is

new. If the rule is determined to be new, the final step inthe Teague analysis requires the court to determine whether

521US1 Unit: $U77 [11-17-99 14:58:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN

157Cite as: 521 U. S. 151 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
the rule nonetheless falls within one of the two narrow ex-ceptions to the Teague doctrine. 520 U. S., at 527. The

first, limited exception is for new rules "forbidding criminalpunishment of certain primary conduct [and] rules prohibiting a certain category of punishment for a class of defendantsbecause of their status or offense."

Penry v. Lynaugh, 492U. S. 302, 330 (1989). The second, even more circumscribed,

exception permits retroactive application of "watershedrules of criminal procedure implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding." Graham,supra, at 478 (quoting Teague, supra, at 311) (internal quotation marks omitted). "Whatever the precise scope of this[second] exception, it is clearly meant to apply only to a small
core of rules requiring observance of those procedures that. . . are implicit in the concept of ordered liberty."

Graham,supra, at 478 (internal quotation marks omitted).

III
Petitioner's conviction became final on October 3, 1988,when we declined to review the Virginia Supreme Court's

decision affirming his sentence on direct review. Simmons,the rule of which petitioner now seeks to avail himself, was
decided in 1994.In

Simmons, the defendant had been found guilty of capi-tal murder for the brutal killing of an elderly woman. The

defendant had also assaulted other elderly women, resultingin convictions that rendered him--at least as of the time he
was sentenced--ineligible for parole. Prosecutors in SouthCarolina are permitted to argue to sentencing juries that
defendants' future dangerousness is an appropriate consider-ation in determining whether to affix a sentence of death.
512 U. S., at 162-163 (plurality opinion). Simmons soughtto rebut the prosecution's "generalized argument of future
dangerousness" by presenting the jury with evidence that"his dangerousness was limited to elderly women," none of
whom he was likely to encounter in prison. Id., at 157.

521US1 Unit: $U77 [11-17-99 14:58:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN
158 O'DELL v. NETHERLAND

Opinion of the Court
Simmons' efforts to shore up this argument by demonstrating to the jury that, under South Carolina law, he was ineligible for parole were rebuffed by the trial court. This Court
reversed the judgment of the South Carolina Supreme Court
upholding Simmons' death sentence. A plurality of the
Court noted that a prosecutor's future dangerousness argument will "necessarily [be] undercut" by "the fact that the
alternative sentence to death is life without parole." Id., at
169. The plurality, relying on Gardner v. Florida, 430 U. S.
349 (1977), and Skipper v. South Carolina, 476 U. S. 1 (1986),
concluded that "[b]ecause truthful information of parole ineligibility allows the defendant to `deny or explain' the showing of future dangerousness, due process plainly requires
that he be allowed to bring it to the jury's attention." 512
U. S., at 169.

Justice O'Connor, joined by The Chief Justice and
Justice Kennedy, concurred in the judgment, providing
the dispositive votes necessary to sustain it. The concurrence recognized:

"[The Court has] previously noted with approval . . . that
`[m]any state courts have held it improper for the jury
to consider or to be informed--through argument or instruction--of the possibility of commutation, pardon, or
parole.' California v. Ramos, 463 U. S. [992, 1013, n. 30
(1983)]. The decision whether or not to inform the jury
of the possibility of early release is generally left to the
States." Id., at 176.

The concurrence also distinguished Skipper, noting that
Skipper involved an attempt to introduce "factual evidence"
regarding the defendant himself, while Simmons "sought to
rely on the operation of South Carolina's sentencing law" to
demonstrate that he did not present a future danger. 512
U. S., at 176. But the concurrence nonetheless concluded
that, "[w]hen the State seeks to show the defendant's future

521US1 Unit: $U77 [11-17-99 14:58:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
dangerousness," the defendant "should be allowed to bringhis parole ineligibility to the jury's attention." Id., at 177.

Petitioner asserts that the Simmons rule covers his case,and that because he was parole ineligible--but not allowed
to relay that information to the jury in order to rebut theprosecutor's argument as to his future dangerousness--

Sim-mons requires vacatur of his sentence. Before we can decide whether petitioner's claim falls within the scope of Sim-mons, we must determine whether the rule of Simmons was
new for Teague purposes, and, if so, whether that rule fallswithin one of the two exceptions to Teague's bar.

A
We observe, at the outset, that Simmons is an unlikelycandidate for "old-rule" status. As noted above, there was

no opinion for the Court. Rather, Justice Blackmun's plural-ity opinion, for four Members, concluded that the Due Process Clause required allowing the defendant to inform thejury--through argument or instruction--of his parole ineligibility in the face of a prosecution's future dangerousness ar-gument. 512 U. S., at 168-169. Two Members of the plurality, Justice Souter and Justice Stevens, would havefurther held that the Eighth Amendment mandated that the
trial court instruct the jury on a capital defendant's paroleineligibility even if future dangerousness was not at issue.
Id., at 172-174 (Souter, J., concurring). Justice Ginsburg, also a Member of the plurality, wrote a concurrencegrounded in the Due Process Clause.

Id., at 174-175. The
Chief Justice and Justice Kennedy joined Justice
O'Connor's decisive opinion concurring in the judgment, asdescribed above.

Id., at 175-178. And, two Justices dis-sented, arguing that the result did not "fit" the Court's precedents and that it was not, in any case, required by the Con-stitution. Id., at 180, 185 (opinion of

Scalia, J., joined by
Thomas, J.). The array of views expressed in Simmons it-self suggests that the rule announced there was, in light of

160 O'DELL v. NETHERLAND

Opinion of the Court
this Court's precedent, "susceptible to debate among reason-able minds." Butler, 494 U. S., at 415; cf. Sawyer v. Smith,

497 U. S. 227, 236-237 (1990) (citing, as evidence that Cald-well v. Mississippi, 472 U. S. 320 (1985), announced a new
rule, the views of the three Caldwell dissenters). An as-sessment of the legal landscape existing at the time petitioner's conviction and sentence became final bolsters thisconclusion.

1
Petitioner's review of the relevant precedent discloses thedecisions relied upon in Simmons, namely, Gardner v. Florida, supra, and Skipper v. South Carolina, supra. Peti-tioner asserts that a reasonable jurist considering his claim
in light of those two decisions "would have felt `compelled. . . to conclude that the rule [petitioner] seeks was required
by the Constitution.' " Brief for Petitioner 14 (quoting Saffle, 494 U. S., at 488) (emphasis deleted).In Gardner, the defendant received a death sentence from

a judge who had reviewed a presentence report that wasnot made available to the defendant. Gardner produced no
opinion for the Court. A plurality of the Court concludedthat the defendant "was denied due process of law when the
death sentence was imposed, at least in part, on the basis ofinformation which he had no opportunity to deny or explain."
430 U. S., at 362. Justice White concurred in the judgment,providing the narrowest grounds of decision among the Justices whose votes were necessary to the judgment. Cf.
Marks v. United States, 430 U. S. 188, 193 (1977). He con-cluded that the Eighth Amendment was violated by a "procedure for selecting people for the death penalty which permitsconsideration of such secret information relevant to the

char-acter and record of the individual offender." 430 U. S., at

364 (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis added).In Skipper, the prosecutor argued during the penalty
phase that a death sentence was appropriate because the de-fendant "would pose disciplinary problems if sentenced to

521US1 Unit: $U77 [11-17-99 14:58:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN

161Cite as: 521 U. S. 151 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
prison and would likely rape other prisoners." 476 U. S., at3. Skipper's efforts to introduce evidence that he had behaved himself in, and made a "good adjustment" to, jail inthe time between his arrest and his trial were rejected by
the trial court. Ibid. The Court concluded: "[E]videncethat the defendant would not pose a danger if spared (but
incarcerated) must be considered potentially mitigating.Under

Eddings [v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104 (1982)], such evi-dence may not be excluded from the sentencer's consideration." 476 U. S., at 5 (footnote omitted). This holding wasgrounded, as was Eddings, in the Eighth Amendment. The
Court also cited the Due Process Clause, stating that"[w]here the prosecution specifically relies on a prediction of
future dangerousness in asking for the death penalty," dueprocess required that "a defendant not be sentenced to death
`on the basis of information which he had no opportunity todeny or explain.' " 476 U. S., at 5, n. 1 (quoting

Gardner,supra, at 362).

Simmons, argues petitioner, presented merely a variationon the facts of

Skipper. In each, the prosecution raised theissue of future dangerousness. Skipper was unconstitutionally prevented from demonstrating that he had behaved inprison and thus would not be a danger to his fellow prisoners. Simmons, likewise, says petitioner, was not allowed toinform the jury that he would be in, rather than out of,
prison and so could not present a danger to elderly women.Because the rule of

Simmons was allegedly set forth in the1986 decision in Skipper, which in turn relied upon the 1977

decision in Gardner, petitioner argues that his death sen-tence was flawed when affirmed in 1988, and we may set it
aside without running afoul of Teague.2

2 Petitioner makes much of language in the Simmons plurality opinion
that the "principle announced in Gardner was reaffirmed in Skipper, and
it compels our decision today." Simmons v. South Carolina, 512 U. S.
154, 164-165 (1994) (emphasis added). While this language, expressing
the view of four Justices, is certainly evidence tending to prove that the

521US1 Unit: $U77 [11-17-99 14:58:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN
162 O'DELL v. NETHERLAND

Opinion of the Court
Even were these two cases the sum total of relevant prece-dent bearing on the rule of Simmons, petitioner's argument

that the result in Simmons followed ineluctably would notbe compelling. Gardner produced seven opinions, none for a
majority of the Court. Taking the view expressed in JusticeWhite's opinion concurring in the judgment as the rule of
Gardner, see Marks, supra, at 193, the holding is a narrowone--that "[a] procedure for selecting people for the death
penalty which permits consideration of . . . secret informa-tion relevant to the

character and record of the individualoffender" violates the Eighth Amendment's requirement of

"reliability in the determination that death is the appropriatepunishment." 430 U. S., at 364 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis added). Petitioner points tono secret evidence given to the sentencer but not to him.
And, the evidence that he sought to present to the jury wasnot historical evidence about his "character and record," but
evidence concerning the operation of the extant legal regime.In

Skipper, too, the evidence that the defendant was un-constitutionally prevented from adducing was evidence of his

past behavior. It is a step from a ruling that a defendantmust be permitted to present evidence of that sort to a requirement that he be afforded an opportunity to describe theextant legal regime. Cf.

Simmons, 512 U. S., at 176 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment).

Whatever support Gardner and Skipper, standing alone,might lend to petitioner's claim that

Simmons was a fore-gone conclusion, the legal landscape in 1988 was far more

complex. Respondents point to, and the Fourth Circuit marule of Simmons was not new--i. e., that it was "dictated" by thenexisting precedent--it is far from conclusive. We have noted that
"[c]ourts frequently view their decisions as being `controlled' or `governed'
by prior opinions even when aware of reasonable contrary conclusions
reached by other courts." Butler v. McKellar, 494 U. S. 407, 415 (1990).

jority relied on, two other cases that had been decided by
the time petitioner's conviction became final and that bear
on its constitutionality: California v. Ramos, 463 U. S. 992
(1983), and Caldwell v. Mississippi, 472 U. S. 320 (1985). In
Ramos, the Court upheld an instruction that informed the
jury that a defendant sentenced to life in prison without
parole could nonetheless be rendered parole eligible if the
Governor elected to commute his sentence. The Court concluded that the instruction neither introduced a constitutionally irrelevant factor into the sentencing process, 463 U. S.,
at 1001-1004, nor diverted the jury's attention from the task
of rendering an "individualized sentencing determination,"
id., at 1005. Within the bounds of the Constitution, the
Court stated that it would defer to California's "identification of the Governor's power to commute a life sentence
as a substantive factor to be presented for the sentencing
jury's consideration." Id., at 1013. We emphasized, however, that this conclusion was not to be taken to "override
the contrary judgment of state legislatures" that capital
juries not learn of a Governor's commutation power. Ibid.
"Many state courts," we pointed out, "have held it improper
for the jury to consider or to be informed--through argument or instruction--of the possibility of commutation, pardon, or parole." Id., at 1013, n. 30 (emphasis added); see
also ibid. (citing, inter alia, Ga. Code Ann. $ 17-8-76 (1982),
and describing that statute as "prohibiting argument as to
possibility of pardon, parole, or clemency" (emphasis added)).
"We sit as judges, not as legislators, and the wisdom of the
decision to permit juror consideration of possible commutation is best left to the States." 463 U. S., at 1014. The dissenters in Ramos disputed the constitutionality of ever informing juries of the Governor's power to commute a death
sentence. See id., at 1018 (opinion of Marshall, J., joined
by Brennan and Blackmun, JJ.); see also id., at 1019-1020
(asserting that consideration by a capital sentencing jury

Opinion of the Court
of a defendant's prospects for commutation or parole isunconstitutional).

The general proposition that the States retained the pre-rogative to determine how much (if at all) juries would be
informed about the postsentencing legal regime was givenfurther credence in

Caldwell v. Mississippi, supra. In thatcase, the prosecution and the judge had, the Court concluded,

improperly left the jury with the impression that a deathsentence was not final because it would be extensively reviewed. Justice Marshall authored the opinion for theCourt except for one portion. In that portion, Justice
Marshall--writing for a plurality--concluded that, Ramosnotwithstanding, sentencing juries were not to be given information about postsentencing appellate proceedings. Justice O'Connor, who provided the fifth vote necessary tothe judgment, did not join this portion of Justice Marshall's

opinion. She wrote separately, stating that, under Ramos,a State could choose whether or not to "instruc[t] the jurors
on the sentencing procedure, including the existence and lim-ited nature of appellate review," so long as any information
it chose to provide was accurate. 472 U. S., at 342 (opinionconcurring in part and concurring in judgment).

3
In light of Ramos and Caldwell, we think it plain that areasonable jurist in 1988 would not have felt

compelled toadopt the rule later set out in Simmons. As noted above,

neither Gardner nor Skipper involved a prohibition on im-parting information concerning what might happen, under
then-extant law, after a sentence was imposed. Rather, theinformation at issue in each case was information pertaining
to the defendant's "character and record." Although theprincipal opinions in

Simmons found Skipper (which, in turn,relied on Gardner) persuasive,

Justice O'Connor distin-guished
Skipper from the facts presented in Simmons onthis very ground, see 512 U. S., at 176 (opinion concurring

Opinion of the Court
in judgment), suggesting that the rule announced in Simmons was not inevitable. See also id., at 183 (Scalia, J.,
dissenting).That distinction--between information concerning state

postsentencing law on the one hand and evidence specifically
related to the defendant on the other--was also at the heartof

Ramos and Caldwell. In Ramos, the majority concluded
that California had reasonably chosen to provide some, lim-ited, postsentence information to the capital sentencing

jury--though it noted that many other States had electedjust the opposite. The principal dissent in

Ramos would
have forbidden the provision of any information about postsentence occurrences for the very reason that it did not constitute evidence concerning the defendant's "character or the
nature of his crime." 463 U. S., at 1022 (opinion of Marshall,
J.). In Caldwell, the plurality and Justice O'Connor contested whether the fact that "appellate review is available to
a capital defendant sentenced to death" was "simply a factor
that in itself is wholly irrelevant to the determination of the
appropriate sentence" (as the plurality concluded, 472 U. S.,
at 336), or whether provision of that information was a constitutional "policy choice in favor of jury education" (as Justice O'Connor concluded, id., at 342 (opinion concurring in
part and concurring in judgment)).

A reasonable jurist in 1988, then, could have drawn a distinction between information about a defendant and information concerning the extant legal regime. It would hardly
have been unreasonable in light of Ramos and Caldwell for
the jurist to conclude that his State had acted constitutionally by choosing not to advise its jurors as to events that
would (or would not) follow their recommendation of a death
sentence, as provided by the legal regime of the moment.
Indeed, given the sentiments, expressed in Justice Marshall's
Ramos dissent and Caldwell plurality, that information
about postsentence procedures was never to go to the jury

and given that the decision whether to provide such informa521US1 Unit: $U77 [11-17-99 14:58:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN
166 O'DELL v. NETHERLAND

Opinion of the Court
tion had been described by the Ramos majority opinion and
Justice O'Connor's concurrence in Caldwell as a "policy
choice" left to the States, the reasonable jurist may well have
concluded that the most surely constitutional course, when
confronted with a request to inform a jury about a defendant's parole eligibility, was silence.

Teague asks state-court judges to judge reasonably, not
presciently. See Stringer v. Black, 503 U. S., at 244 (Souter, J., dissenting). In Simmons, the Court carved out an
exception to the general rule described in Ramos by, for the
first time ever, requiring that a defendant be allowed to inform the jury of postsentencing legal eventualities. A 1988
jurist's failure to predict this cannot, we think, be deemed
unreasonable. Accordingly, the rule announced in Simmons
was new, and petitioner may not avail himself of it unless
the rule of Simmons falls within one of the exceptions to
Teague's bar.3

3 Our conclusion that the rule of Simmons was new finds support in the
decisions of the state courts and the lower federal courts. See Butler,
494 U. S., at 415. By 1988, no state or federal court had adopted the rule
of Simmons. In fact, both before and after Skipper v. South Carolina,
476 U. S. 1 (1986), several courts had upheld against constitutional challenge practices similar, if not identical, to that later forbidden in Simmons.
See, e. g., Turner v. Bass, 753 F. 2d 342, 354 (CA4 1985), rev'd on other
grounds sub nom. Turner v. Murray, 476 U. S. 28 (1986); O'Bryan v. Estelle, 714 F. 2d 365, 389 (CA5 1983), cert. denied sub nom. O'Bryan v.

Circuit in this case, concluded that the rule of Simmons was new. See,

Opinion of the Court

B
Petitioner contends that, even if it is new, the rule of Simmons falls within the second exception to Teague, which per-mits retroactive application of " `watershed rules of criminal

procedure' implicating the fundamental fairness and accu-racy of the criminal proceeding." Graham, 506 U. S., at 478
(quoting Teague, 489 U. S., at 311). Petitioner describes the"practice condemned in

Simmons" as a "shocking one."
Brief for Petitioner 33. The rule forbidding it, we are told,
is "on par" with Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 (1963)--which we have cited as an example of the sort of rule falling

within Teague's second exception, see Saffle, 494 U. S., at495--because "both cases rest upon this Court's belief that

certain procedural protections are essential to prevent a mis-carriage of justice," Brief for Petitioner 35 (citations omitted). We disagree.4 Unlike the sweeping rule of Gideon,which established an affirmative right to counsel in all felony
cases, the narrow right of rebuttal that Simmons affords todefendants in a limited class of capital cases has hardly " ` "alter[ed] our understanding of the bedrock procedural elements" ' essential to the fairness of a proceeding." Sawyer,
497 U. S., at 242 (quoting Teague, supra, at 311, quoting, in
turn, Mackey v. United States, 401 U. S. 667, 693 (1971) (Har-lan, J., concurring in judgments in part and dissenting in

part) (emphasis in Teague)). Simmons possesses little ofthe "watershed" character envisioned by

Teague's second
exception.

4 It is by no means inevitable that, absent application of the rule of

Simmons, "miscarriage[s] of justice" will occur. We note, for example,
that at the time he was sentenced to death for Helen Schartner's murder,
petitioner had already been convicted of a murder committed while he was
in prison. Informing his sentencing jury that petitioner would spend the
rest of his days in prison would not, then, necessarily have rebutted an
argument that he presented a continuing danger.

Stevens, J., dissenting

IV
For the reasons stated herein, the judgment of the Courtof Appeals is affirmed.

It is so ordered.
Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Souter, Justice
Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.

Although petitioner's guilt has been established, it is un-disputed that the conduct of the sentencing hearing that led

to the imposition of his death penalty violated the Due Proc-ess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. His eligibility
for a death sentence depended on the prosecutor's ability toconvince the jury that there was a "probability that he would
commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a con-tinuous threat to society." App. 69. In support of his argument to the jury that nothing short of the death penaltywould be sufficient, the prosecutor emphasized petitioner's
misconduct when he was "outside of the prison system," id.,at 61,

1 and stated that petitioner had "forfeited his right to

live among us," id., at 66. Nevertheless, the trial court re1 During his closing statement at the sentencing proceeding, the prosecutor observed: "Isn't it interesting that he is only able to be outside of
the prison system for a matter of months to a year and a half before
something has happened again?" App. 61. And, after drawing out the
parallels between the Virginia murder and a kidnaping and robbery for
which petitioner had been convicted in Florida some years earlier, the
prosecutor said: "We are a society of fair, honest people who believe in our
government and who believe in our justice system; and I submit to you
there was a failure in the Florida criminal justice system for paroling this
man when they did." Id., at 64.

The prosecutor concluded his argument by saying: "[Y]ou may still sentence him to life in prison, but I ask you ladies and gentlemen[,] in a
system, in a society that believes in its criminal justice system and its
government, what does this mean? . . . [A]ll the times he has committed
crimes before and been before other juries and judges, no sentence ever
meted out to this man has stopped him. Nothing has stopped him, and
nothing ever will except the punishment that I now ask you to impose."
Id., at 66.

fused to allow petitioner to advise the jury that if the deathsentence were not imposed, he would be imprisoned for the

rest of his life without any possibility of parole. Thus, hewas denied the opportunity to make a fair response to the
prosecutor's misleading argument about the future danger
that he allegedly posed to the community.Our virtually unanimous decision in

Simmons v. South
Carolina, 512 U. S. 154 (1994),2 recognized the fundamentalunfairness of the restrictive procedure followed in this case.

As Justice O'Connor's opinion, which has been treated asexpressing the narrowest ground on which the decision
rested, explained:

" `Capital sentencing proceedings must of course satisfy the dictates of the Due Process Clause,' Clemons
v. Mississippi, 494 U. S. 738, 746 (1990), and one of the
hallmarks of due process in our adversary system is the
defendant's ability to meet the State's case against him.
Cf. Crane v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 683, 690 (1986). In capital cases, we have held that the defendant's future dangerousness is a consideration on which the State may
rely in seeking the death penalty. See California v.
Ramos, 463 U. S. 992, 1002-1003 (1983). But `[w]here
the prosecution specifically relies on a prediction of future dangerousness in asking for the death penalty, . . .
the elemental due process requirement that a defendant
not be sentenced to death "on the basis of information
which he had no opportunity to deny or explain" [requires that the defendant be afforded an opportunity to
introduce evidence on this point].' Skipper v. South
Carolina, 476 U. S. 1, 5, n. 1 (1986), quoting Gardner v.

Florida, 430 U. S. 349, 362 (1977) (plurality opinion); see

2 In the years following our decision in Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S.
238 (1972) (per curiam), unanimous Court opinions in capital cases have
been virtually nonexistent. The decision in Simmons v. South Carolina,
512 U. S. 154 (1994), came closer than most, for only two Justices dissented.

also 476 U. S., at 9-10 (Powell, J., concurring in judg-ment)." Id., at 175 (opinion concurring in judgment).

Thus, this case is not about whether petitioner was givena fair sentencing hearing; instead, the question presented is
whether, despite the admittedly unfair hearing, he should beput to death because his trial was conducted before Simmons was decided. Because the Court regards the holdingin Simmons as nothing more than a novel "court-made rule,"
ante, at 156, it rejects petitioner's plea. In my view, ourdecision in

Simmons applied a fundamental principle that isas old as the adversary system itself, and that had been quite

clearly articulated by this Court in two earlier opinions.Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.

I
My analysis begins where the majority tersely ends--withpetitioner's contention that the rule in Simmons implicates

"the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal pro-ceeding,"

Saffle v. Parks, 494 U. S. 484, 495 (1990), and there-fore should be retroactively applied even if it would constitute a "new" rule under Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288, 307(1989).

Our decision in Teague recognized two exceptions to thegeneral rule of nonretroactivity. The relevant exception for
our purposes establishes that "a new rule should be appliedretroactively if it requires the observance of `those procedures that . . . are "implicit in the concept of ordered lib-erty." ' "

and dissenting in part), in turn quoting Palko v. Connecticut,302 U. S. 319, 325 (1937)). In the opinion that provided the
basis for the limitations on collateral review adopted in
Teague, Justice Harlan emphasized the importance of pro-tecting "bedrock procedural elements" that are "essential to

the substance of a full hearing." Mackey, 401 U. S., at 693-694. We endorsed that view, with the caveat that this

Stevens, J., dissenting
exception should be limited to those "procedures without
which the likelihood of an accurate [determination of guilt
or innocence] is seriously diminished." Teague, 489 U. S.,
at 313.3

Since Teague was decided, this Court has never found a
rule so essential to the fairness of a proceeding that it would
fall under this exception.4 In my view, the right in Simmons--the right to respond to an inaccurate or misleading
argument--is surely a bedrock procedural element of a full
and fair hearing. As Justice O'Connor recognized in her
opinion in Simmons, this right to rebut the prosecutor's arguments is a "hallmar[k] of due process," 512 U. S., at 175
(opinion concurring in judgment). See also id., at 174 (Ginsburg, J., concurring) ("This case is most readily resolved
under a core requirement of due process, the right to be
heard"). When a defendant is denied the ability to respond
to the state's case against him, he is deprived of "his fundamental constitutional right to a fair opportunity to present a
defense." Crane v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 683, 687 (1986).

The Court today argues that Simmons defined only a
"narrow right of rebuttal [for] defendants in a limited class
of capital cases," ante, at 167, and therefore that the rule
cannot be in that class of rules so essential to the accuracy of

3 Although Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989), focused on the accuracy
of a guilt-innocence determination, we have long recognized that sentencing procedures, as well as trials, must satisfy the dictates of the Due Process Clause, see, e. g., Clemons v. Mississippi, 494 U. S. 738, 746 (1990), and
that the unique character of the death penalty mandates special scrutiny
of those procedures in capital cases. An unfair procedure that seriously
diminishes the likelihood of an accurate determination that a convicted
defendant should receive the death penalty rather than life without parole--that the defendant is "innocent of the death penalty," see Sawyer
v. Whitley, 505 U. S. 333, 341-343 (1992)--is plainly encompassed by
Teague's exception.

4 The most commonly cited example of a rule so fundamental that it

would fit this category is the right to counsel articulated in Gideon v.
Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 (1963).

Stevens, J., dissenting
a criminal proceeding that they are excepted from Teague'snonretroactivity principle.

The majority appears not to appreciate that the reasonSimmons' holding applied directly to only a narrow class of
capital defendants is because only a very few States had inplace procedures that allowed the prosecutor to argue future
dangerousness while at the same time prohibiting defend-ants from using "the only way that [they] can successfully
rebut the State's case." 512 U. S., at 177 (O'Connor, J., con-curring in judgment).

5 The prevailing rule in the States

that provided a life-without-parole sentencing alternativerequired an instruction explaining that alternative to the

jury.6Although the majority relies on the limited impact of the
Simmons rule to discount its importance, the broad consen-sus in favor of giving the jury accurate information in fact
underscores the importance of the rule applied in Simmons.The rule's significance is further demonstrated by evidence
of the effect that information about the life-without-parolealternative has on capital jury deliberations. For example,
only 2 death sentences have been imposed in Virginia forcrimes committed after January 1, 1995--whereas 10 were
imposed in 1994 alone--and the decline in the number ofdeath sentences has been attributed to the fact that juries
in Virginia must now be informed of the life-without-parolealternative. See Green, Death Sentences Decline in Virginia, Richmond Times-Dispatch, Nov. 24, 1996,7 p. A1. The

Stevens, J., dissenting
consensus among the scholars and practitioners who draftedthe Model Penal Code is that instructing the jury completely

about the available sentencing alternatives is the best wayto ensure accuracy in sentencing. See American Law Institute, Model Penal Code $ 210.6 (1980). And we affirmed this
basic point in Beck v. Alabama, 447 U. S. 625, 637 (1980),when we acknowledged that the likelihood that a jury would

find an obviously guilty defendant eligible for the death pen-alty was significantly increased when an arguably more appropriate sentencing alternative was not available.Thus, even if the rule in

Simmons could properly be
viewed as a "new" rule, it is of such importance to the accu-racy and fairness of a capital sentencing proceeding that it

should be applied consistently to all prisoners whose death
sentences were imposed in violation of the rule, whetherthey were sentenced before

Simmons was decided or after.
Moreover, to the extent that the fundamental principles un-derlying the rule needed explicit articulation by this Court,

they clearly had been expressed well before petitioner's 1988sentencing proceeding.

II
Distinguishing new rules from those that are not new
under our post-Teague jurisprudence is not an easy task, butit is evident to me that if there is such a thing as a rule that

is not new for these purposes, the rule announced in Simmons is one.

In Gardner v. Florida, 430 U. S. 349 (1977), a plurality of
the Court concluded that the defendant's due process rightshad been violated because his "death sentence was imposed,

at least in part, on the basis of information which he had noopportunity to deny or explain."

nine Justices cited Gardner, with approval, as establishingthe "elemental due process requirement that a defendant not

be sentenced to death `on the basis of information which hehad no opportunity to deny or explain.'

When the Court was presented with the facts in Simmons,it was no surprise that Justice Blackmun said that "[t]he

principle announced in Gardner was reaffirmed in Skipper,and it compels our decision today." 512 U. S., at 164-165
(plurality opinion). Or that Justice O'Connor quoted
Gardner and Skipper for the proposition that "elemental dueprocess" requires that a defendant must be allowed to answer a prosecutor's "prediction of future dangerousness"
with "evidence on this point." 512 U. S., at 175 (internal
quotation marks omitted).

Today, however, the Court seeks to revise the import of
this line of cases. The first misstep in the Court's analysis
is its treatment of Gardner. The majority makes much of
the fact that the lead opinion was joined by only three Justices,8 and instead of accepting the plurality's due process
analysis as the rule of Gardner, the Court takes Justice
White's concurring opinion, which was grounded in the
Eighth Amendment, as expressing the holding of the case.
The Court's reading of Gardner ignores the fact that Justice
White himself squarely adopted the due process holding of

agreed with the plurality's conclusion that sentencing a defendant based
on information he was not permitted to deny or explain violated due process, but refused to join the judgment insofar as it permitted further

endorsing the Gardner plurality's statement of the law and
emphasizing that this "elemental due process requirement"
provided an even more basic justification for the Court's
holding.9 Moreover, in his opinion concurring in the judgment in Skipper, Justice Powell, joined by the Chief Justice
and then-Justice Rehnquist, rejected the mitigating evidence rationale, relying instead on "the rule in Gardner."
476 U. S., at 10-11. Thus, in Skipper, all nine Justices then
serving on the Court endorsed Gardner's holding that due
process was violated when a sentencing determination
rested on information that a defendant was not permitted to
explain or deny. See also Clemons v. Mississippi, 494 U. S.
738, 746 (1990) (citing Gardner for the proposition that
"[c]apital sentencing proceedings must of course satisfy the
dictates of the Due Process Clause"); Simmons, 512 U. S., at
180 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (quoting Skipper and Gardner as
"indicat[ing] that petitioner's due process rights would be
violated if he was `sentenced to death "on the basis of information which he had no opportunity to deny or explain," ' "
but concluding that the petitioner could not show that his
sentence violated this principle).

9 "Where the prosecution specifically relies on a prediction of future dangerousness in asking for the death penalty, it is not only the rule of Lockett
[v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586 (1978),] and Eddings [v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104
(1982),] that requires that the defendant be afforded an opportunity to
introduce evidence on this point; it is also the elemental due process requirement that a defendant not be sentenced to death `on the basis of
information which he had no opportunity to deny or explain.' Gardner v.
Florida, 430 U. S. 349, 362 (1977)." Skipper v. South Carolina, 476 U. S.

176 O'DELL v. NETHERLAND

Stevens, J., dissenting
As to Skipper, the only distinction the majority is able todraw between that case and

Simmons is that the defendant
in Skipper sought to introduce "evidence of his past behav-ior," while Simmons wished "an opportunity to describe the

extant legal regime." Ante, at 162. This distinction is simply not enough to make the rule in Simmons "new." Inboth cases, the prosecution was seeking to mislead the jury

with an argument that excluded facts essential to the defend-ant's actual circumstances. The rule in

Skipper and Gardner--that a defendant must be allowed an opportunity torebut arguments put forward by the prosecution--simply

cannot turn on whether his rebuttal relies on the fact that
he is ineligible for parole or on the fact that he is a model
prisoner.

The two cases on which the majority relies to argue that
a reasonable jurist in 1988 would have thought that petitioner did not have a right to rebut the prosecutor's future
dangerousness arguments simply provide further support for
the conclusion that Simmons did not announce a new rule of
law. In both California v. Ramos, 463 U. S. 992 (1983), and
Caldwell v. Mississippi, 472 U. S. 320 (1985), the Court focused its analysis on whether the information being presented (or withheld) in a sentencing determination permitted
accurate and informed decisionmaking on the part of the
sentencer.

In Ramos, the Court held that California's capital sentencing procedure--in which the judge was required to inform
the jury that it could sentence the defendant to death or to
life without parole, and then to provide the further instruction that the Governor could commute a life sentence without
parole--was not constitutionally infirm. (This further instruction is, of course, only relevant when the jury has first
been advised that the alternative to the death sentence is
the option that was concealed from the jury in Simmons and
in this case.) The Court correctly explained that the instruction on commutation of the life sentence was relevant

Stevens, J., dissenting
to the issue of future dangerousness, 463 U. S., at 1003, andconsistent with the rule of Gardner because it provided the

jury with accurate information and did not preclude the de-fendant from offering argument or evidence regarding the
Governor's power to commute a life sentence. 463 U. S., at1004. In a comment that anticipated the precise holding in
Simmons, the Court concluded that the instruction underreview "corrects a misconception and supplies the jury with
accurate information for its deliberation in selecting an ap-propriate sentence." 463 U. S., at 1009.

10

While the Ramos Court concluded that a State could constitutionally require trial judges to inform sentencing juriesabout the possibility of commutation of a life sentence, the

Court did not hold that a State was constitutionally com-pelled to do so. The majority today,

ante, at 163-164, suggests that the Ramos Court's endorsement of that option--
involving a choice between two nonmisleading instructions,one mentioning and the other not mentioning the remote

"possibility" of parole--might have led reasonable statejudges to conclude that they could allow juries to be misled
on the future dangerousness issue by concealing entirely thelegal certainty of parole

impossibility. But the general rule
applied in Ramos simply permits state courts to give accu-rate instructions that will prevent juries from being misled

about sentencing options in capital cases. In order to decide
Simmons correctly, there was no need to "carv[e] out an ex-ception,"

ante, at 166, from that rule.
The Court's reading of Caldwell is equally unpersuasive.In that case, the prosecutor had urged the jury not to view

itself as finally determining whether the defendant would

10 The Court cited with approval the provision of the Model Penal Code
recommending that the jury be advised of "the nature of the sentence of
imprisonment that may be imposed, including its implication with respect
to possible release upon parole, if the jury verdict is against sentence of
death." California v. Ramos, 463 U. S., at 1009, n. 23 (quoting American
Law Institute, Model Penal Code $ 210.6 (Prop. Off. Draft 1962)).

Stevens, J., dissenting
die, because the death sentence was subject to appellatereview. As

Justice O'Connor's controlling opinion ex-plained, the prosecutor's remarks were improper "because

they were inaccurate and misleading in a manner that dimin-ished the jury's sense of responsibility." 472 U. S., at 342.
Because Justice Marshall's plurality opinion suggested thatany comment on appellate review was "wholly irrelevant" to
the sentencing determination, id., at 336, the Court todaysuggests that state judges might reasonably have concluded
"that information about postsentence procedures was neverto go to the jury." Ante, at 165. Apart from the fact that
an instruction describing a sentencing alternative does notrelate to "postsentence procedures," I see no basis for assuming that concerns about describing the process of appellatereview to a jury might have anything to do with the necessity for providing the jury with accurate information aboutsentencing options when the prosecutor makes the misleading argument that the death penalty is the only way to pre-vent a defendant's future dangerousness "outside of the
prison system."The Court has consistently, and appropriately, shown a
particular concern for procedures that protect the accuracyof sentencing determinations in capital cases.

11 Today, the

majority discards this concern when it relies on a nonexist-ent tension between

Gardner and Skipper on the one handand Ramos and Caldwell on the other to justify its refusal

to apply the rule in Simmons to this case.I respectfully dissent.

11 See Gardner, 430 U. S., at 357-358 ("From the point of view of the
defendant, it is different in both its severity and its finality. From the
point of view of society, the action of the sovereign in taking the life of
one of its citizens also differs dramatically from any other legitimate state
action. It is of vital importance to the defendant and to the community
that any decision to impose the death sentence be, and appear to be, based
on reason rather than caprice or emotion"). See also, e. g., California v.
Ramos, 463 U. S. 992, 998-999 (1983); Beck v. Alabama, 447 U. S. 625,

KLEHR et ux. v. A. O. SMITH CORP. et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eighth circuit

No. 96-663. Argued April 21, 1997--Decided June 19, 1997
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) makes

it a crime "to conduct" an "enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity." 18 U. S. C. $ 1962(c). A "pattern" requires at
least two acts of racketeering activity, the last of which occurred within
10 years after the commission of a prior act. $ 1961(5). A person injured by a violation of RICO's criminal provisions may recover treble
damages and attorney's fees in a civil RICO action, $ 1964(c), but civil
actions are subject to the 4-year limitations period in $ 4B of the Clayton
Act--the statute of limitations governing private civil antitrust actions
seeking treble damages, Agency Holding Corp. v. Malley-Duff & Associates, Inc., 483 U. S. 143, 156. The petitioners Klehr filed a civil RICO
action against respondents (hereinafter Harvestore) in August 1993,
claiming that their injury began in 1974, when they purchased a
Harvestore-brand silo for their dairy farm based on Harvestore's false
representations that it would prevent moldy and fermented cattle feed,
thereby producing healthier cows, more milk, and higher profits. In
fact, the feed became moldy and fermented and both milk production
and profits declined. They added that Harvestore committed other
predicate acts, consisting of repeated misrepresentations to the Klehrs
and to others, and sales to others, over many years. Harvestore moved
to dismiss on the ground that the limitations period had run because the
Klehrs' claim had accrued before August 1989, and no special legal doctrine applied to toll the running of the limitations period or to estop
Harvestore from asserting a statute of limitations defense. The Klehrs
responded that because Harvestore had taken affirmative steps to conceal its fraud, they did not become sufficiently suspicious to investigate
the silo and to discover the mold until 1991. The District Court found
the Klehrs' lawsuit untimely. The Eighth Circuit affirmed, holding that
a civil RICO action accrues as soon as the plaintiff discovers, or reasonably should discover, both the existence and source of his injury and
that the injury is part of a pattern; and that the Klehrs had suffered
one single, continuous injury sometime in the 1970's which they should
have discovered well before August 1989. The Circuit refused to toll
the running of the statute on a "fraudulent concealment" theory because, among other things, the Klehrs had not been sufficiently diligent

180 KLEHR v. A. O. SMITH CORP.

Syllabus
in discovering their claim. Like the Eighth Circuit, some Circuits apply
an "injury and pattern discovery" civil RICO accrual rule; others apply
an "injury discovery" rule, under which the statute begins to run when
the plaintiff knows or reasonably should know of his injury; and the
Third Circuit applies a "last predicate act" rule, under which the statute
begins to run when the plaintiff knows or reasonably should know of
the last injury or last predicate act in the pattern, whether or not the
plaintiff himself has suffered any injury from that last act.

Held:

1. The "last predicate act" rule is not an appropriate interpretation
of RICO. Pp. 186-193.

(a) Only the Third Circuit's accrual rule can help the Klehrs. For
purposes of assessing its lawfulness, this Court assumes that the rule
means that as long as Harvestore committed one predicate act within
the limitations period, the Klehrs can recover, not just for any harm
caused by that late-committed act, but for all the harm caused by all
the acts that make up the total "pattern"; that the Klehrs can show at
least one such late-committed act; and that they are knowledgeable
about the pattern. Pp. 186-187.

(b) The rule is unlawful for two reasons. First, because a series
of predicate acts can continue indefinitely, it creates a longer limitations
period than Congress could have contemplated, in conflict with a basic
objective--repose--underlying limitations periods. See, e. g., Wilson v.
Garcia, 471 U. S. 261, 271. Civil RICO has no compensatory objective
warranting so significant an extension of the limitations period, and civil
RICO's further purpose--encouraging potential private plaintiffs diligently to investigate, see Malley-Duff, 483 U. S., at 151--suggests the
contrary. RICO's criminal limitations period, which runs from the most
recent predicate act, does not provide an apt analogy for civil RICO
actions. Id., at 155-156. Second, the rule is inconsistent with $ 4B of
the Clayton Act, under which "a cause of action accrues . . . when a
defendant commits an act that injures a plaintiff's business." Zenith
Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 401 U. S. 321, 338. The Clayton Act analogy is generally useful in civil RICO cases, since Congress
consciously patterned civil RICO after that Act, and since, by the time
civil RICO was enacted, the Clayton Act's accrual rule was well established. The Clayton Act accrual rule may not apply without modification in every civil RICO case. However, in this case the petitioners
knew of the facts underlying their cause of action, and thus the Clayton
Act rule makes clear precisely where, and how, the Third Circuit's rule
goes too far. The Klehrs invoke the "separate accrual" civil RICO rule

Syllabus
adopted by some Circuits, which is similar to the "continuing violation"
doctrine in antitrust, in that the commission of a separate, new predicate
act within the 4-year limitations period permits a plaintiff to recover
for the additional damages that act caused. Under the separate accrual
rule, however, the plaintiff cannot use an independent, new act as a
bootstrap to recover for injuries caused by other predicate acts that
took place outside the limitations period. See, e. g., Grimmett v.
Brown, 75 F. 3d 506, 513. Thus acts taking place after August 1989 do
not help the Klehrs, for they have not shown any additional damages,
and the Third Circuit rule is incorrect insofar as it would allow the
presence of a new act to help them recover for injuries caused by pre1989 acts. This case also does not present the kind of special circumstance in which courts might permit plaintiffs to recover for injuries
that were so speculative or unprovable at the time of Harvestore's unlawful act that starting the limitations period when the act first caused
injury would have left the Klehrs without relief. Zenith, supra, at 339-
340, distinguished. Pp. 187-191.

(c) Resolving the conflicts among the various discovery accrual
rules used by other Circuits would not affect the outcome of this case,
as the petitioners' civil RICO claim is barred under the most liberal
accrual rule, as applied by the Eighth Circuit. There is no clear or
obvious error in the Eighth Circuit's application of its "injury and pattern discovery" rule and it is beyond the scope of the writ to reconsider
whether the Klehrs reasonably should have discovered the silo's flaws
before 1989. Pp. 191-193.

2. A plaintiff who is not reasonably diligent in trying to discover his
civil RICO cause of action may not rely upon "fraudulent concealment"
to toll the limitations period or to estop a defendant from asserting a
limitations defense. This requirement is uniformly supported by relevant authority in the related antitrust context, where the "fraudulent
concealment" doctrine is invoked fairly often. And while those courts
that do not require "reasonable diligence" in contexts other than antitrust cases have said that the doctrine is concerned only with defendants' behavior, that is not the case with respect to antitrust or civil
RICO. In both of these contexts private civil actions seek not only to
compensate victims but also to encourage those victims diligently to
investigate and thereby to uncover unlawful activity. See Malley-Duff,
supra, at 151. The Klehrs' fact-based question whether the Eighth
Circuit properly applied the "due diligence" requirement to the evidentiary materials before it is beyond the scope of this Court's writ.
Pp. 193-196.

87 F. 3d 231, affirmed.

Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.
The petition in this case asked us to consider two aspectsof "statute of limitations" law. One concerns the date upon

which a civil action accrues under the Racketeer Influencedand Corrupt Organizations Act and the limitations period
starts to run. The other concerns "fraudulent concealment,"a doctrine that extends the time for a plaintiff to file suit. In
respect to the first, we focus upon, and disapprove, an accrualrule followed in the Third Circuit called the "last predicate
act" rule. In respect to the second, we hold that a plaintiffmay not rely upon "fraudulent concealment" unless he has been
reasonably diligent in trying to discover his cause of action.

Opinion of the Court

I
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act
(RICO), 18 U. S. C. $$ 1961-1968, among other things, makes
it a crime "to conduct" an "enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity." $ 1962(c). The phrase "racketeering activity" is a term of art defined in terms of activity
that violates other laws, including more than 50 specifically
mentioned federal statutes, which forbid, for example,
murder-for-hire, extortion, and various kinds of fraud.

$ 1961(1). The word "pattern" is also a term of art defined
to require "at least two acts of racketeering activity, . . . the
last of which occurred within ten years . . . after the commission of a prior act of racketeering activity." $ 1961(5).

A special RICO provision--commonly known as civil
RICO--permits "[a]ny person injured in his business or
property by reason of a violation" of RICO's criminal provisions to recover treble damages and attorney's fees.

$ 1964(c). RICO does not say what limitations period governs the filing of civil RICO claims. But in Agency Holding
Corp. v. Malley-Duff & Associates, Inc., 483 U. S. 143, 156
(1987), this Court held that civil RICO actions are subject to
the 4-year limitations period contained in $ 4B of the Clayton
Act (Antitrust), as added by 69 Stat. 283, and as amended, 15
U. S. C. $ 15b--the statute of limitations that governs private
civil antitrust actions seeking treble damages.

Marvin and Mary Klehr, the petitioners here, are dairy
farmers. They filed this civil RICO action on August 27,
1993, claiming that A. O. Smith Corporation and A. O. Smith
Harvestore Products, Inc. (whom we shall simply call
"Harvestore"), had committed several acts of mail and wire
fraud, 18 U. S. C. $$ 1341, 1343, thereby violating RICO and
causing them injury. Their injury, they said, began in 1974,
when Harvestore sold them a special "Harvestore" brand
silo, which they used for storing cattle feed. The Klehrs
alleged that they bought the silo in reliance on Harvestore's
representations, made through advertisements and a local

Opinion of the Court
dealer, that the silo would limit the amount of oxygen incontact with the silage, thus preventing moldy and fermented feed, and thereby producing healthier cows, moremilk, and higher profits. The representations, they claim,
were false; the silo did not keep oxygen away from the feed,the feed became moldy and fermented, the cows ate the bad
feed, and milk production and profits went down. They addthat Harvestore committed other acts--consisting primarily
of additional representations made to them and to others andsales made to others--over a period of many years after
1974.Harvestore, pointing out that the Klehrs had filed suit almost 20 years after they had bought the silo, moved to dis-miss the lawsuit on the ground that the limitations period
had long since run. The Klehrs could not file suit, Harvestoresaid, unless their claim had accrued within the four years
prior to filing, i. e., after August 25, 1989, or unless somespecial legal doctrine nonetheless tolled the running of the
limitations period or estopped Harvestore from asserting astatute of limitations defense. See

Holmberg v. Armbrecht,327 U. S. 392, 396-397 (1946); Bailey v. Glover, 21 Wall. 342,

349-350 (1875); Cada v. Baxter Healthcare Corp., 920 F. 2d446, 450-451 (CA7 1990), cert. denied, 501 U. S. 1261 (1991).

The Klehrs responded by producing evidentiary materialdesigned to support a legal justification for the late filing.
Essentially they claimed that Harvestore had covered up itsfraud--preventing them from noticing the silo's malfunction--for example, by means of an unloading device that hidthe mold by chopping up the feed instantly as it emerged;
through continued dealer misrepresentations; with adver-tisements that tried to convince farmers that warm, brown,
molasses-smelling feed was not fermented feed, but goodfeed; and even by hanging on the silo itself a plaque that said:

"DANGERDO NOT ENTER
NOT ENOUGH OXYGENTO SUPPORT LIFE"

Opinion of the Court
Not until 1991, say the Klehrs, did they become sufficientlysuspicious to investigate the silo, at which time, by opening

the silo wall and chopping through the feed with an ice chisel,they discovered " `mold hanging all over the silage.' " Brief
for Petitioners 16.The District Court, after examining the Klehrs' evidence,
found their lawsuit untimely. The Eighth Circuit affirmed
the dismissal, and said that a civil RICO action accrues

" `as soon as the plaintiff discovers, or reasonably should
have discovered, both the existence and source of hisinjury and that the injury is part of a pattern.' " 87 F.

3d 231, 238 (1996) (quoting Association of Commonwealth Claimants v. Moylan, 71 F. 3d 1398, 1402 (CA8

1995)).

After examining the Klehrs' evidence de novo, the Circuit
held that they failed to satisfy the standard. It said theyhad suffered "one single, continuous injury . . . sometime in

the 1970s"; and that they should have discovered "the exist-ence and source of [their] injury," as well as any related "pattern," well before August 1989. 87 F. 3d, at 239. The Cir-cuit refused to find "fraudulent concealment" because, among
other things, the Klehrs had not been sufficiently "diligen[t]."
Id., at 238, 239, n. 11.

We granted certiorari in this case to consider the Klehrs'
claim in light of a split of authority among the Courts ofAppeals. Two other Circuits, like the Eighth Circuit here,

have applied forms of an "injury and pattern discovery" civilRICO accrual rule.

applies). One court, the Third Circuit, has applied a "lastpredicate act" rule, which we shall discuss below. We also
agreed to decide the Klehrs' argument that "reasonable dili-gence" is not a necessary component of the doctrine of
"fraudulent concealment."For reasons we shall describe, we affirm the judgment of
the Court of Appeals. II

A
We shall first discuss the Third Circuit's accrual rule--the"last predicate act" rule--for it is the only accrual rule that

can help the Klehrs. Like the Eighth Circuit, the Third Cir-cuit believes that the limitations period starts to run when
a plaintiff knew or should have known that the RICO claim(including a "pattern of racketeering activity") existed, but
the Third Circuit has added an important exception, whichit states as follows:

"[If], as a part of the same pattern of racketeering activ-ity, there is further injury to the plaintiff or further
predicate acts occur, . . . the accrual period shall runfrom the time when the plaintiff knew or should have
known of the last injury or the last predicate act whichis part of the same pattern of racketeering activity.
The last predicate act need not have resulted in injuryto the plaintiff but must be part of the same pattern."
Keystone Ins. Co. v. Houghton, 863 F. 2d 1125, 1130(1988).

For purposes of assessing the rule's lawfulness, we assume,as do the Klehrs, that this rule means that as long as

521US1 Unit: $U78 [11-30-99 19:28:33] PAGES PGT: OPIN

187Cite as: 521 U. S. 179 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
Harvestore committed one predicate act within the limita-tions period (

i. e., the four years preceding suit), the Klehrs
can recover, not just for any added harm caused them bythat late-committed act, but for all the harm caused them by

all the acts that make up the total "pattern." We also assume that they can show at least one such late-committedact. Finally, we note that the point of difference between

the Third Circuit and the other Circuits has nothing todo with the plaintiff 's state of mind or knowledge. It concerns only the accrual consequences of a late-committed act.Consequently, we can consider the merits of the rule on
the simplifying assumption that the plaintiff is perfectly
knowledgeable.

We conclude that the Third Circuit's rule is not a proper
interpretation of the law. We have two basic reasons.
First, as several other Circuits have pointed out, the last
predicate act rule creates a limitations period that is longer
than Congress could have contemplated. Because a series
of predicate acts (including acts occurring at up to 10-year
intervals) can continue indefinitely, such an interpretation, in
principle, lengthens the limitations period dramatically. It
thereby conflicts with a basic objective--repose--that underlies limitations periods. See Wilson v. Garcia, 471 U. S. 261,
271 (1985) (citing Adams v. Woods, 2 Cranch 336, 342 (1805));
Crown, Cork & Seal Co. v. Parker, 462 U. S. 345, 352 (1983).
Indeed, the rule would permit plaintiffs who know of the
defendant's pattern of activity simply to wait, "sleeping on
their rights," ibid., as the pattern continues and treble damages accumulate, perhaps bringing suit only long after the
"memories of witnesses have faded or evidence is lost," Wilson, supra, at 271. We cannot find in civil RICO a compensatory objective that would warrant so significant an extension of the limitations period, and civil RICO's further
purpose--encouraging potential private plaintiffs diligently
to investigate, see Malley-Duff, 483 U. S., at 151--suggests
the contrary.

188 KLEHR v. A. O. SMITH CORP.

Opinion of the Court
We recognize that RICO's criminal statute of limitationsruns from the last, i. e., the most recent, predicate act. But

there are significant differences between civil and criminalRICO actions, and this Court has held that criminal RICO
does not provide an apt analogy. Id., at 155-156 (decliningto apply criminal RICO's 5-year statute of limitations to civil
RICO actions and noting "competing equities unique to civilRICO actions or, indeed, any other federal civil remedy").

Second, the Third Circuit rule is inconsistent with the or-dinary Clayton Act rule, applicable in private antitrust treble damages actions, under which "a cause of action accruesand the statute begins to run when a defendant commits an
act that injures a plaintiff 's business." Zenith Radio Corp.v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 401 U. S. 321, 338 (1971); Connors v. Hallmark & Son Coal Co., 935 F. 2d 336, 342, n. 10(CADC 1991); 1 C. Corman, Limitation of Actions $ 6.5.5.1,
p. 449 (1991) (hereinafter Corman); 2 P. Areeda & H. Hoven-kamp, Antitrust Law || 338b, p. 145 (rev. ed. 1995) (hereinafter Areeda). We do not say that a pure injury accrualrule always applies without modification in the civil RICO
setting in the same way that it applies in traditional antitrustcases. For example, civil RICO requires not just a single
act, but rather a "pattern" of acts. Furthermore, there issome debate as to whether the running of the limitations
period depends on the plaintiff 's awareness of certain ele-ments of the cause of action. As we said earlier, however,
for purposes of evaluating the Third Circuit's rule we canassume knowledgeable parties. Hence the special problems
associated with a discovery rule, see Part II-B, infra, arenot at issue. And we believe, in these circumstances, the
Clayton Act analogy is helpful.In Malley-Duff, this Court indicated why the analogy is
useful. It concluded

"that there is a need for a uniform statute of limitationsfor civil RICO, that the Clayton Act clearly provides a

far closer analogy than any available state statute, and

Opinion of the Court
that the federal policies that lie behind RICO and thepracticalities of RICO litigation make the selection of

the 4-year statute of limitations for Clayton Act actions. . . the most appropriate limitations period for RICO
actions." 483 U. S., at 156 (citing 15 U. S. C. $ 15b).
The Court left open the accrual question. But it did notrule out the use of a Clayton Act analogy. As the Court has

explained, Congress consciously patterned civil RICO afterthe Clayton Act. 483 U. S., at 150-151 (comparing 15
U. S. C. $ 15(a) with 18 U. S. C. $ 1964(c)); see also Sedima,S. P. R. L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U. S. 479, 489 (1985). And by
the time civil RICO was enacted, the Clayton Act's accrualrule was well established. See Crummer Co. v. DuPont, 223
F. 2d 238, 247-248 (CA5), cert. denied, 350 U. S. 848 (1955);Foster & Kleiser Co. v. Special Site Sign Co., 85 F. 2d 742,
750-751 (CA9 1936), cert. denied, 299 U. S. 613 (1937); Bluefields S. S. Co. v. United Fruit Co., 243 F. 1, 20 (CA3 1917).The Clayton Act helps here because it makes clear precisely where, and how, the Third Circuit's rule goes too far.Antitrust law provides that, in the case of a "continuing violation," say, a price-fixing conspiracy that brings about a se-ries of unlawfully high priced sales over a period of years,
"each overt act that is part of the violation and that injuresthe plaintiff,"

e. g., each sale to the plaintiff, "starts the statu-tory period running again, regardless of the plaintiff 's knowledge of the alleged illegality at much earlier times." 2Areeda || 338b, at 145 (footnote omitted); see also Zenith,
supra, at 338; Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. United Shoe MachineryCorp., 392 U. S. 481, 502, n. 15 (1968); DXS, Inc. v. Siemens
Medical Systems, Inc., 100 F. 3d 462, 467 (CA6 1996). Butthe commission of a separate new overt act generally does
not permit the plaintiff to recover for the injury caused byold overt acts outside the limitations period.

Similarly, some Circuits have adopted a "separate accrual"rule in civil RICO cases, under which the commission of a
separable, new predicate act within a 4-year limitations pe-riod permits a plaintiff to recover for the additional damages
caused by that act. But, as in the antitrust cases, the plaintiff cannot use an independent, new predicate act as a bootstrap to recover for injuries caused by other earlier predicate acts that took place outside the limitations period. See,
e. g., Grimmett, 75 F. 3d, at 512-514; McCool v. Strata Oil
Co., 972 F. 2d, at 1465-1466, and n. 10; Bivens Gardens Office
Building, Inc. v. Barnett Bank, 906 F. 2d, at 1552, n. 9; State
Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Ammann, 828 F. 2d 4, 5 (CA9
1987) (Kennedy, J., concurring). But see Bingham v. Zolt,
66 F. 3d 553, 560 (CA2 1995) (citing Bankers Trust, 859 F.
2d, at 1103). Thus, the Klehrs may point to new predicate
acts that took place after August 1989, such as sales to other
farmers or the printing of new Harvestore advertisements.
But that fact does not help them, for, as the Court of Appeals
pointed out, they have not shown how any new act could
have caused them harm over and above the harm that the
earlier acts caused. 87 F. 3d, at 239. Nor can the presence
of the new act help them recover for the injuries caused by
pre-1989 acts, for it is in this respect that we find the Third
Circuit's rule incorrect.

Petitioners also point to Zenith, a case in which this Court
considered antitrust damages that were so "speculative" or
"unprovable," 401 U. S., at 339, at the time of a defendant's
unlawful act (and plaintiff 's initial injury) that to follow the
normal accrual rule (starting the limitations period at the

Opinion of the Court
point the act first causes injury) would have left the plaintiff
without relief. This Court held that, in such a case, a claim
for the injuries that had been speculative would accrue when
those injuries occurred, even though the act that caused
them had taken place more than four years earlier. Id., at
339-340. This case does not help the petitioners here, however, for their injuries--the harm to their farm--have always been specific and calculable.

B
We recognize that our holding in Part II-A does not resolve other conflicts among the Circuits. For example, the
Circuits have applied "discovery" accrual rules, which extend accrual periods for plaintiffs who could not reasonably
obtain certain key items of information. The use of a discovery rule may reflect the fact that a high percentage of
civil RICO cases, unlike typical antitrust cases, involve fraud
claims. See Sedima, supra, at 499, n. 16 (most civil RICO
claims involve underlying fraud offense); 1 A. Mathews, A.
Weissman, & J. Sturc, Civil RICO Litigation, p. 1-6 (2d ed.
1992) (citing Report of the Ad Hoc Civil RICO Task Force of
the ABA Section of Corporation, Banking and Business Law
243 (1985)) (as of 1985, approximately 90% of civil RICO
cases resulting in a published decision involved mail, wire,
or securities fraud as a predicate offense); cf. Connors, 935
F. 2d, at 342 (federal courts generally apply discovery accrual
rule when statute does not call for a different rule); 1 Corman $ 6.5.5.1, at 449 (same). Moreover, different Circuits
have applied discovery accrual rules that differ, one from the
other, in important ways. Compare, e. g., Bankers Trust,
supra, at 1103 (civil RICO cause of action accrues when the
plaintiff discovers or should have discovered his injury), with
87 F. 3d, at 238 (civil RICO cause of action accrues when, in
addition, plaintiff discovers or should have discovered the
"source" of injury and a "pattern").

521US1 Unit: $U78 [11-30-99 19:28:33] PAGES PGT: OPIN
192 KLEHR v. A. O. SMITH CORP.

Opinion of the Court
We further realize that, contrary to our assumption in PartII-A,

supra (where we discussed a legal issue in respect to
which knowledge was irrelevant), the Klehrs did claim thatthey lacked knowledge of the faulty silo--the "source" of

their injury. But that particular "lack of knowledge" claim
does not require us to consider the various "discovery rule"differences among the Circuits, because the Klehrs failed the

"knowledge" test that favors them the most--the EighthCircuit's "injury plus source plus pattern" rule. That rule
would have found the Klehrs' action timely had it not beenthe case that the Klehrs reasonably "should have discovered"
all of those elements prior to 1989. 87 F. 3d, at 239. If the
Klehrs cannot fit their case through the Eighth Circuit's
larger hole, they cannot squeeze it through a smaller one.

In addition, the major difference among the Circuits--
whether a discovery rule includes knowledge about a "pattern"--is clearly not at issue here. Harvestore marketed
and sold its "oxygen-limiting" silos for many years before
the Klehrs purchased theirs, and the Klehrs have not claimed
lack of knowledge of a "pattern." Nor has anyone argued
any other legal differences among the Circuits' various tests
that would affect the outcome in this case.

In these circumstances, we believe we should not consider
differences among the various discovery accrual rules used
by the Circuits. The legal questions involved may be subtle
and difficult. Compare id., at 238 (claim accrues with discovery of existence and source of injury, plus pattern), with
Bivens Gardens, supra, at 1554 (claim accrues with discovery
of injury and pattern); see also Cada, 920 F. 2d, at 451 (describing differences among various discovery rules and doctrines of "equitable tolling" and "equitable estoppel"). And
the facts of this case do not force focused argument as to
how the traditional Clayton Act "injury" accrual rule, principles of equitable tolling, and doctrines of equitable estoppel
should interact in circumstances where the application of
one, or another, of these different limitations doctrines would

193Cite as: 521 U. S. 179 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
make a significant legal difference. To say this is not, as theconcurrence claims, to advocate a "mix-and-match" statute of

limitations theory. Post, at 200, n. 3. Rather, it is to recog-nize that the Clayton Act's express statute of limitations
does not necessarily provide all the answers. We shall, atthe very least, wait for a case that clearly presents these or
related issues, providing an opportunity for full argument,before we attempt to resolve them.

Finally, the Klehrs have asked us to review the EighthCircuit's application of its rule in this case. Doing so would
involve examining an evidentiary record of several thousandpages to determine the validity of the independent conclusion of each of two lower courts that the Klehrs should rea-sonably have discovered the silo's flaws before 1989 (and that
a reasonable factfinder could not conclude to the contrary).That conclusion is highly fact based, depending not only upon
how much mold the Klehrs noticed in their silage and when,but also upon such matters as the effect of the Klehrs' failure
to consult the herd performance records they were continu-ously sent, and whether their having done so would have led
them to tell veterinarians a more revealing story, to questionHarvestore's representatives more fully, or to investigate the
silo sooner. See 87 F. 3d, at 234. We have no reason tobelieve that there is any very obvious or exceptional error
below. And our writ of certiorari commits us to decide onlythe purely legal question whether or not a claim accrues
"where the Respondent continues to commit predicate acts"in the 4-year period immediately preceding suit. Pet. for
Cert. i. We have answered that question in Part II-A.And we shall not go beyond the writ's question to reexamine
the fact-based rule-application issue that the Klehrs nowraise, and which the Eighth Circuit decided in Harvestore's
favor. III

Our writ of certiorari contained one further question,namely, whether

521US1 Unit: $U78 [11-30-99 19:28:33] PAGES PGT: OPIN
194 KLEHR v. A. O. SMITH CORP.

Opinion of the Court
"affirmative continuing acts of fraud . . . coupled withactive cover up of the fraud, act to equitably toll the

statute of limitations . . . whether or not Petitioners haveexercised reasonable diligence to discover their claim."
Ibid. (emphasis added).
This question refers to the doctrine of "fraudulent conceal-ment," which some courts have said "equitably tolls" the running of a limitations period, see, e. g., Grimmett, 75 F. 3d, at514, while other courts have said it is a form of "equitable
estoppel," see, e. g., Wolin v. Smith Barney Inc., 83 F. 3d 847,852 (CA7 1996). Regardless, the question presented here
focuses upon a relevant difference among the Circuits in re-spect to the requirement of "reasonable diligence" on the
part of the plaintiff. Some Circuits have held that when aplaintiff does not, in fact, know of a defendant's unlawful activity, and when the defendant takes "affirmative steps" toconceal that unlawful activity, those circumstances are sufficient to toll the limitations period (or to "estop" the defend-ant from asserting a limitations defense)

irrespective of whatthe plaintiff should have known. See, e. g., id., at 852-853.

Other courts have held that a plaintiff who has not exercisedreasonable diligence may not benefit from the doctrine.
See, e. g., Wood v. Carpenter, 101 U. S. 135, 143 (1879); Bailey, 21 Wall., at 349-350; J. Geils Band Employee BenefitPlan v. Smith Barney Shearson, Inc., 76 F. 3d 1245, 1252-

1255 (CA1 1996) (diligence required for fraudulent conceal-ment under federal law); Urland v. Merrell-Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 822 F. 2d 1268, 1273-1274 (CA3 1987) (samewith respect to Pennsylvania law); see also 2 Corman $ 9.7.1,
at 56-57, 60-61, 64-66.We limit our consideration of the question to the context
of civil RICO. In that context, we conclude that "reasonablediligence" does matter, and a plaintiff who is not reasonably
diligent may not assert "fraudulent concealment." Wereach this conclusion for two reasons. First, in the related
antitrust context, where the "fraudulent concealment" doc521US1 Unit: $U78 [11-30-99 19:28:33] PAGES PGT: OPIN

195Cite as: 521 U. S. 179 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
trine is invoked fairly often, relevant authority uniformlysupports the requirement. Professor Areeda says, for example, that "[t]he concealment requirement is satisfied onlyif the plaintiff shows that he neither knew nor, in the exercise of due diligence, could reasonably have known of the
offense." 2 Areeda || 338, at 152; see also I. Scher, AntitrustAdviser $ 10.27, p. 10-62 (4th ed. 1995). We have found

many antitrust cases that say the same, and none that saysthe contrary. See,

e. g., Conmar Corp. v. Mitsui & Co., 858
F. 2d 499, 502 (CA9 1988), cert. denied sub nom. VSL Corp.v.

Conmar Corp., 488 U. S. 1010 (1989); Texas v. Allan
Constr. Co., 851 F. 2d 1526, 1533 (CA5 1988); Pinney Dock &
Transport Co. v. Penn Central Corp., 838 F. 2d 1445, 1465
(CA6), cert. denied sub nom. Pinney Dock & Transport Co.
v. Norfolk & Western R. Co., 488 U. S. 880 (1988); New York
v. Hendrickson Bros., Inc., 840 F. 2d 1065, 1083 (CA2), cert.
denied, 488 U. S. 848 (1988); Berkson v. Del Monte Corp., 743
F. 2d 53, 56 (CA1 1984), cert. denied, 470 U. S. 1056 (1985);
Charlotte Telecasters, Inc. v. Jefferson-Pilot Corp., 546 F. 2d
570, 574 (CA4 1976).

Second, those courts that do not require "reasonable diligence" have said that the "fraudulent concealment" doctrine
seeks to punish defendants for affirmative, discrete acts of
concealment; the behavior of plaintiffs is consequently irrelevant. See Wolin, supra, at 852; Robertson v. Seidman &
Seidman, 609 F. 2d 583, 593 (CA2 1979); cf. Urland, supra,
at 1280-1281 (Becker, J., dissenting). Whether or not that
is so in the legal contexts at issue in those cases (which were
not antitrust cases), it is not so in respect either to antitrust
or to civil RICO. Rather, in both of those latter contexts
private civil actions seek not only to compensate victims but
also to encourage those victims themselves diligently to investigate and thereby to uncover unlawful activity. See
Malley-Duff, 483 U. S., at 151. That being so, we cannot say
that the "fraudulent concealment" is concerned only with the
behavior of defendants. For that reason, and in light of the

196 KLEHR v. A. O. SMITH CORP.

Opinion of Scalia, J.
consensus of authority, we conclude that "fraudulent conceal-ment" in the context of civil RICO embodies a "due diligence" requirement.In their brief on the merits, petitioners have asked us to
examine whether the Eighth Circuit properly applied the"due diligence" requirement to the evidentiary materials before it. That fact-based question, however, is beyond thescope of our writ; and for reasons similar to those discussed
earlier, see supra, at 193, we shall not consider it.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is

Affirmed.
Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas joins,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.
Twice this Term we have received full briefing and heardoral argument on the question of when a civil Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) cause ofaction accrues; when we rise for our summer recess, the
question will remain unanswered. We did not reach it inGrimmett v. Brown, 519 U. S. 233 (1997), because we dismissed the writ of certiorari as improvidently granted. Andwe do not reach it today for no particular reason except timidity--declining to say what the correct accrual rule is, butmerely rejecting the only one of the four candidates

1 under

which these petitioners could recover. We thus leave re-duced but unresolved the well-known split in authority that

prompted us to take this case. There will remain in effect,in some Circuits, one of the three remaining accrual rules--
the one that their Courts of Appeals or District Courts haveadopted; in the remaining Circuits litigants will have to

1 The Court's opinion could be read to suggest that there are only three
different possible accrual rules--last predicate act, injury discovery, and
injury and pattern discovery. See ante, at 185-186, 191-193. In fact, as
is alluded to in its rejection of the Third Circuit's last predicate act rule,
see ante, at 188-189, there is a fourth accrual rule--the Clayton Act "injury" rule.

197Cite as: 521 U. S. 179 (1997)
Opinion of Scalia, J.
guess which of the three to follow; and in all of the Circuitsno one will know for sure which rule is right--until, at some

future date, we receive briefing and argument a third orfourth time, and finally summon up the courage to "unravel,"
as one commentator has put it, "the mess that characterizes
civil RICO accrual decisions," Abrams, Crime Legislationand the Public Interest: Lessons from Civil RICO, 50 SMU

L. Rev. 33, 70 (1996).Worse still, the reason the Court gives for regarding the
accrual issue as too complex ("subtle and difficult," ante, at192) to be decided on only the second try is a reason that
implicates the merits, and that in my view gets the merits
wrong. One cannot, the Court says, leap impetuously to the
conclusion that the antitrust "injury" accrual rule applies,
rather than a "discovery" accrual rule, because civil RICO
cases are unlike antitrust cases, in that "a high percentage"
of them "involve fraud claims." Ante, at 191. This erases,
it seems to me, the one clear path back out of the current
forest of confusion, which is the proposition that RICO is
similar to the Clayton Act. This is the proposition that
caused us to adopt the Clayton Act statute of limitations in
the first place, specifically rejecting the argument the Court
now finds plausible, that the preponderance of fraud claims
under RICO makes the Clayton Act an inappropriate model.
We said the similarity was close enough: "Although the large
majority of civil RICO complaints use [fraud] as the required
predicate offenses, a not insignificant number of complaints
allege criminal activity of a type generally associated with
professional criminals such as arson, bribery, theft and political corruption." Agency Holding Corp. v. Malley-Duff &
Associates, Inc., 483 U. S. 143, 149 (1987) (rejecting for this
reason the use of state-law fraud statutes of limitations).
Elsewhere in today's opinion, curiously enough, the Court is
quite willing to say that what is good for antitrust is good for
RICO--even with respect to a matter much more intimately
connected with fraud than the accrual rule, namely, whether

521US1 Unit: $U78 [11-30-99 19:28:33] PAGES PGT: OPIN
198 KLEHR v. A. O. SMITH CORP.

Opinion of Scalia, J.
invocation of the "fraudulent concealment" rule requires
"reasonable diligence" on the plaintiff 's part. On this point
the Court finds arguments taken from "the related antitrust
context" entirely persuasive. Ante, at 194. (Apart from
that illogical reliance, it seems to me also illogical even to
resolve the question whether a statute should be tolled by
fraudulent concealment without having resolved the antecedent question of when the statute begins to run.) Similarly,
the Court relies heavily on the antitrust injury accrual rule
in its analysis rejecting the Third Circuit's last predicate act
rule. Ante, at 188-191.

I would resolve the Circuit split we granted certiorari to
consider, and would hold that, of the four main accrual rules
(injury, injury discovery, injury and pattern discovery, and
last predicate act), the appropriate accrual rule is the Clayton Act "injury" rule--the "cause of action accrues and the
statute begins to run when a defendant commits an act that
injures a plaintiff 's business." Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 401 U. S. 321, 338 (1971) (referring, of
course, to "an act" that violates the governing statute). In
Malley-Duff, we held that the appropriate statute of limitations for civil RICO actions is the 4-year limitations period
found in the Clayton Act. We reasoned that "RICO was
patterned after the Clayton Act," 483 U. S., at 150, and that
the purpose, structure, and aims of the two schemes were
quite similar, id., at 151-152.2 Although we expressly ac2 "Both RICO and the Clayton Act are designed to remedy economic
injury by providing for the recovery of treble damages, costs, and attorney's fees. Both statutes bring to bear the pressure of `private attorneys
general' on a serious national problem for which public prosecutorial resources are deemed inadequate; the mechanism chosen to reach the objective in both the Clayton Act and RICO is the carrot of treble damages.
Moreover, both statutes aim to compensate the same type of injury; each
requires that a plaintiff show injury `in his business or property by reason
of' a violation." 483 U. S., at 151.

Opinion of Scalia, J.
knowledged in Malley-Duff that we "ha[d] no occasion to
decide the appropriate time of accrual for a RICO claim,"
id., at 157, it takes no profound analysis to figure out what
that decision must be. "Presumably the accrual standards
developed by the lower federal courts in . . . civil antitrust
litigation should be equally applicable to civil enforcement
RICO actions." 1 C. Corman, Limitation of Actions $ 6.5.5.1,
pp. 447-448 (1991).

We have said that "[a]ny period of limitation . . . is understood fully only in the context of the various circumstances
that suspend it from running against a particular cause of
action." Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, Inc., 421
U. S. 454, 463 (1975). It is just as true, I think, that any
period of limitation is utterly meaningless without specification of the event that starts it running. As a practical matter, a 4-year statute of limitations means nothing at all unless one knows when the four years start running. If they
start, for example, on the 10th anniversary of the injury, the
4-year statute is more akin to a 14-year statute than to the
Clayton Act. We would thus have been foolish, in MalleyDuff, to speak of "adopting" the Clayton Act statute, and of
"patterning" the RICO limitations period after the Clayton
Act, if all we meant was using the Clayton Act number of
years.

We have recognized this principle in our more established
practice (first departed from in DelCostello v. Teamsters, 462
U. S. 151 (1983)) of borrowing state rather than federal statutes of limitations. We have consistently followed "[s]tate
law . . . in a variety of cases that raised questions concerning
the overtones and details of application of the state limitation period to the federal cause of action. Auto Workers v.

e. g., Chardon v. Fumero Soto, 462 U. S. 650, 657, 662 (1983).
"In virtually all statutes of limitations the chronological
length of the limitation period is interrelated with provisions
regarding tolling, revival, and questions of application.
Courts thus should not unravel state limitations rules unless
their full application would defeat the goals of the federal
statute at issue." Hardin v. Straub, 490 U. S. 536, 539 (1989)

(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). There is
no conceivable reason why the same principle should not
apply to the borrowing of an analogous federal, rather than
state, limitations period.

Both the allurement and the vice of the "mix-and-match"
approach to statutes-of-limitations borrowing (the possibility
of which the Court today entertains) is that it provides broad
scope for judicial lawmaking. We should have resisted that
allurement today,3 as we resisted it in the past: "[W]e find
no support in our cases for the practice of borrowing only a
portion of an express statute of limitations. Indeed, such a
practice comes close to the type of judicial policymaking
that our borrowing doctrine was intended to avoid."
Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis & Petigrow v. Gilbertson,
501 U. S. 350, 362, n. 8 (1991) (emphasis added). It is, in
other words, no wonder that the Court finds the question
it has posed for itself today "subtle and difficult"; judicial
policywonking is endlessly demanding, and constructing a
statute of limitations is much more complicated than adopting one. Finding the most analogous cause of action whose

3 The Court disclaims any intent to adopt a "mix-and-match" approach,
ante, at 193, but that seems to me inconsistent with its repeated references
to the possibility of a discovery accrual rule--which is (and has been
thought to be) the antithesis of the Clayton Act injury accrual rule. If
the Court merely means to say that it is not sure how the Clayton Act
accrual rule would apply in this case, then it should simply say so--
thereby going a long way toward resolving the Circuit split and rendering
this concurrence unnecessary.

Opinion of Scalia, J.
limitations provision can be adopted is relatively simple (forthe cause of action before us, we did it in

Malley-Duff); but
limiting the adoption to merely the term of years set forthin the limitations provision, and then selecting, to go with

that term of years, the precise accrual rule, tolling rule, estoppel rule, etc., that will clothe the limitations-naked stat-ute with an ensemble of policy perfection--well that is, I

concede, a task that should not be attacked all at once, butrather undertaken piecemeal, over several decades, as the
Court has chosen to do today. I prefer to stand by theruder, humbler, but more efficient and predictable practice
we have followed in the past: When we adopt a statute of
limitations from an analogous federal cause of action we
adopt it in whole, with all its accoutrements. Perhaps
(though I am dubious) there is room for an exception similar
to the one made in our state-borrowing practice, see Hardin,
supra, that would permit rejection of an element that "would
defeat the goals of the federal statute at issue," 490 U. S., at
539. But unless this exception is to gobble up the rule, nothing so extreme is represented by the Clayton Act accrual
rule.

Applying the Clayton Act accrual rule, I agree with the
Court that petitioners' cause of action accrued more than
four years before the filing of this action on August 27, 1993.
See ante, at 192. Since the Court of Appeals determined,
under a more relaxed accrual rule, that petitioners should
have discovered all of the RICO elements (which would include their injury) prior to 1989, it follows, a fortiori, that
under the Clayton Act injury accrual rule, petitioners' cause
of action is untimely.

I also agree with the Court that petitioners are not entitled to invoke the fraudulent concealment doctrine. As the
Court persuasively demonstrates, in the antitrust context
" `[t]he concealment requirement is satisfied only if the plaintiff shows that he neither knew nor, in the exercise of due
diligence, could reasonably have known of the offense.' "

AGOSTINI et al. v. FELTON et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe second circuit

No. 96-552. Argued April 15, 1997--Decided June 23, 1997*
In Aguilar v. Felton, 473 U. S. 402, 413, this Court held that New York

City's program that sent public school teachers into parochial schools to
provide remedial education to disadvantaged children pursuant to Title
I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 necessitated
an excessive entanglement of church and state and violated the First
Amendment's Establishment Clause. On remand, the District Court
entered a permanent injunction reflecting that ruling. Some 10 years
later, petitioners--the parties bound by the injunction--filed motions in
the same court seeking relief from the injunction's operation under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(5). They emphasized the significant
costs of complying with Aguilar and the assertions of five Justices in
Board of Ed. of Kiryas Joel Village School Dist. v. Grumet, 512 U. S.
687, that Aguilar should be reconsidered, and argued that relief was
proper under Rule 60(b)(5) and Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail,
502 U. S. 367, 388, because Aguilar cannot be squared with this Court's
intervening Establishment Clause jurisprudence and is no longer good
law. The District Court denied the motion on the merits, declaring that
Aguilar's demise has "not yet occurred." The Second Circuit agreed
and affirmed.

Held:

1. A federally funded program providing supplemental, remedial instruction to disadvantaged children on a neutral basis is not invalid
under the Establishment Clause when such instruction is given on the
premises of sectarian schools by government employees under a program containing safeguards such as those present in New York City's
Title I program. Accordingly, Aguilar, as well as that portion of
its companion case, School Dist. of Grand Rapids v. Ball, 473 U. S.
373, addressing a "Shared Time" program, are no longer good law.
Pp. 215-236.

(a) Under Rufo, supra, at 384, Rule 60(b)(5)--which states that,
"upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party . . . from a
final judgment . . . [when] it is no longer equitable that the judgment

*Together with No. 96-553, Chancellor, Board of Education of the City

Syllabus
should have prospective application"--authorizes relief from an injunction if the moving party shows a significant change either in factual
conditions or in law. Since the exorbitant costs of complying with the
injunction were known at the time Aguilar was decided, see, e. g., 473
U. S., at 430-431 (O'Connor, J., dissenting), they do not constitute a
change in factual conditions sufficient to warrant relief, accord, Rufo,
supra, at 385. Also unavailing is the fact that five Justices in Kiryas
Joel expressed the view that Aguilar should be reconsidered or overruled. Because the question of Aguilar's propriety was not before the
Court in that case, those Justices' views cannot be said to have effected
a change in Establishment Clause law. Thus, petitioners' ability to satisfy Rule 60(b)(5)'s prerequisites hinges on whether the Court's later
Establishment Clause cases have so undermined Aguilar that it is no
longer good law. Pp. 215-218.

(b) To answer that question, it is necessary to understand the rationale upon which Aguilar and Ball rested. One of the programs evaluated in Ball was the Grand Rapids, Michigan, Shared Time program,
which is analogous to New York City's Title I program. Applying the
three-part Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602, 612-613, test, the Ball
Court acknowledged that the Shared Time program satisfied the test's
first element in that it served a purely secular purpose, 473 U. S., at 383,
but ultimately concluded that it had the impermissible effect of advancing religion, in violation of the test's second element, id., at 385. That
conclusion rested on three assumptions: (i) any public employee who
works on a religious school's premises is presumed to inculcate religion
in her work, see id., at 385-389; (ii) the presence of public employees on
private school premises creates an impermissible symbolic union between church and state, see id., at 389, 391; and (iii) any public aid that
directly aids the educational function of religious schools impermissibly
finances religious indoctrination, even if the aid reaches such schools as
a consequence of private decisionmaking, see id., at 385, 393, 395-397.
Additionally, Aguilar set forth a fourth assumption: that New York
City's Title I program necessitates an excessive government entanglement with religion, in violation of the Lemon test's third element, because public employees who teach on religious school premises must be
closely monitored to ensure that they do not inculcate religion. See 473
U. S., at 409, 412-414. Pp. 218-222.

(c) The Court's more recent cases have undermined the assumptions upon which Ball and Aguilar relied. Contrary to Aguilar's conclusion, placing full-time government employees on parochial school
campuses does not as a matter of law have the impermissible effect
of advancing religion through indoctrination. Subsequent cases have
modified in two significant respects the approach the Court uses to as521US1 Unit: $U79 [11-30-99 19:30:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN

205Cite as: 521 U. S. 203 (1997)
Syllabus
sess whether the government has impermissibly advanced religion by
inculcating religious beliefs. First, the Court has abandoned Ball's presumption that public employees placed on parochial school grounds will
inevitably inculcate religion or that their presence constitutes a symbolic union between government and religion. Zobrest v. Catalina
Foothills School Dist., 509 U. S. 1, 12-13. No evidence has ever shown
that any New York City instructor teaching on parochial school premises attempted to inculcate religion in students. Second, the Court has
departed from Ball's rule that all government aid that directly aids the
educational function of religious schools is invalid. Witters v. Washington Dept. of Servs. for Blind, 474 U. S. 481, 487; Zobrest, supra, at 10,
12. In all relevant respects, the provision of the instructional services
here at issue is indistinguishable from the provision of a sign-language
interpreter in Zobrest. Zobrest and Witters make clear that, under current law, the Shared Time program in Ball and New York City's Title I
program will not, as a matter of law, be deemed to have the effect of
advancing religion through indoctrination. Thus, both this Court's
precedent and its experience require rejection of the premises upon
which Ball relied. Pp. 222-230.

(d) New York City's Title I program does not give aid recipients
any incentive to modify their religious beliefs or practices in order to
obtain program services. Although Ball and Aguilar completely ignored this consideration, other Establishment Clause cases before and
since have examined the criteria by which an aid program identifies its
beneficiaries to determine whether the criteria themselves have the effect of advancing religion by creating a financial incentive to undertake
religious indoctrination. Cf., e. g., Witters, supra, at 488; Zobrest,
supra, at 10. Such an incentive is not present where, as here, the aid
is allocated on the basis of neutral, secular criteria that neither favor
nor disfavor religion, and is made available to both religious and secular
beneficiaries on a nondiscriminatory basis. Under such circumstances,
the aid is less likely to have the effect of advancing religion. See
Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S. 263, 274. New York City's Title I services are available to all children who meet the eligibility requirements,
no matter what their religious beliefs or where they go to school.
Pp. 230-232.

(e) The Aguilar Court erred in concluding that New York City's
Title I program resulted in an excessive entanglement between church
and state. Regardless of whether entanglement is considered in the
course of assessing if a program has an impermissible effect of advancing religion, Walz v. Tax Comm'n of City of New York, 397 U. S. 664,
674, or as a factor separate and apart from "effect," Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S., at 612-613, the considerations used to assess its exces521US1 Unit: $U79 [11-30-99 19:30:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN
206 AGOSTINI v. FELTON

Syllabus
siveness are similar: The Court looks to the character and purposes of
the benefited institutions, the nature of the aid that the State provides,
and the resulting relationship between the government and religious
authority. Id., at 615. It is simplest to recognize why entanglement
is significant and treat it--as the Court did in Walz--as an aspect of the
inquiry into a statute's effect. The Aguilar Court's finding of "excessive" entanglement rested on three grounds: (i) the program would require "pervasive monitoring by public authorities" to ensure that Title
I employees did not inculcate religion; (ii) the program required "administrative cooperation" between the government and parochial schools;
and (iii) the program might increase the dangers of "political divisiveness." 473 U. S., at 413-414. Under the Court's current Establishment Clause understanding, the last two considerations are insufficient
to create an "excessive entanglement" because they are present no matter where Title I services are offered, but no court has held that Title I
services cannot be offered off campus. E. g., Aguilar, supra. Further,
the first consideration has been undermined by Zobrest. Because the
Court in Zobrest abandoned the presumption that public employees will
inculcate religion simply because they happen to be in a sectarian environment, there is no longer any need to assume that pervasive monitoring of Title I teachers is required. There is no suggestion in the record
that the system New York City has in place to monitor Title I employees
is insufficient to prevent or to detect inculcation. Moreover, the Court
has failed to find excessive entanglement in cases involving far more
onerous burdens on religious institutions. See Bowen v. Kendrick, 487
U. S. 589, 615-617. Pp. 232-235.

(f) Thus, New York City's Title I program does not run afoul of any
of three primary criteria the Court currently uses to evaluate whether
government aid has the effect of advancing religion: It does not result
in governmental indoctrination, define its recipients by reference to religion, or create an excessive entanglement. Nor can this carefully constrained program reasonably be viewed as an endorsement of religion.
Pp. 234-235.

(g) The stare decisis doctrine does not preclude this Court from
recognizing the change in its law and overruling Aguilar and those portions of Ball that are inconsistent with its more recent decisions. E. g.,
United States v. Gaudin, 515 U. S. 506, 521. Moreover, in light of the
Court's conclusion that Aguilar would be decided differently under current Establishment Clause law, adherence to that decision would undoubtedly work a "manifest injustice," such that the law of the case
doctrine does not apply. Accord, Davis v. United States, 417 U. S. 333,
342. Pp. 235-236.

2. The significant change in this Court's post-Aguilar Establishment
Clause law entitles petitioners to relief under Rule 60(b)(5). The
Court's general practice is to apply the rule of law it is announcing to
the parties before it, Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490 U. S. 477, 485, even when it is overruling a case, e. g.,
Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pen~ a, 515 U. S. 200, 237-238. The Court
neither acknowledges nor holds that other courts should ever conclude
that its more recent cases have, by implication, overruled an earlier
precedent. Rather, lower courts should follow the case which directly
controls, leaving to this Court the prerogative of overruling its own
decisions. Rodriguez de Quijas, supra, at 484. Respondents' various
arguments as to why relief should not be granted in this litigation--that
a different analysis is required because the Court is here reviewing for
abuse of discretion the District Court's denial of relief; that petitioners'
unprecedented use of Rule 60(b)(5) as a vehicle for effecting changes in
the law, rather than as a means of recognizing them, will encourage
litigants to burden the federal courts with a deluge of Rule 60(b)(5)
motions; that petitioners' use of Rule 60(b) in this context will erode the
Court's institutional integrity; and that the Court should wait for a "better vehicle" in which to evaluate Aguilar's continuing vitality--are not
persuasive. Pp. 237-240.

In 1965, Congress enacted Title I of the Elementary andSecondary Education Act of 1965, 79 Stat. 27, as modified,
20 U. S. C. $ 6301 et seq., to "provid[e] full educational op-portunity to every child regardless of economic background."
S. Rep. No. 146, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., 5 (1965) (hereinafterTitle I). Toward that end, Title I channels federal funds,
through the States, to "local educational agencies" (LEA's).20 U. S. C. $$ 6311, 6312.* The LEA's spend these funds to

34 CFR $$ 200.10(a), 200.11(b) (1996).

An LEA providing services to children enrolled in private
schools is subject to a number of constraints that are not
imposed when it provides aid to public schools. Title I services may be provided only to those private school students
eligible for aid, and cannot be used to provide services on
a "school-wide" basis. Compare 34 CFR $ 200.12(b) (1996)
with 20 U. S. C. $ 6314 (allowing "school-wide" programs
at public schools). In addition, the LEA must retain complete control over Title I funds; retain title to all materials
used to provide Title I services; and provide those services through public employees or other persons independent of the private school and any religious institution.

$$ 6321(c)(1), (2). The Title I services themselves must be
"secular, neutral, and nonideological," $ 6321(a)(2), and must
"supplement, and in no case supplant, the level of services"
already provided by the private school, 34 CFR $ 200.12(a)
(1996).

Petitioner Board of Education of the City of New York
(hereinafter Board), an LEA, first applied for Title I funds
in 1966 and has grappled ever since with how to provide Title
I services to the private school students within its jurisdiction. Approximately 10% of the total number of students
eligible for Title I services are private school students. See
App. 38, 620. Recognizing that more than 90% of the private schools within the Board's jurisdiction are sectarian,
Felton v. Secretary, United States Dept. of Ed., 739 F. 2d
48, 51 (CA2 1984), the Board initially arranged to transport
children to public schools for after-school Title I instruction.
But this enterprise was largely unsuccessful. Attendance
was poor, teachers and children were tired, and parents were
concerned for the safety of their children. Ibid. The Board
then moved the after-school instruction onto private school

Opinion of the Court
campuses, as Congress had contemplated when it enacted
Title I. See Wheeler v. Barrera, 417 U. S. 402, 422 (1974).
After this program also yielded mixed results, the Board implemented the plan we evaluated in Aguilar v. Felton, 473
U. S. 402 (1985).

That plan called for the provision of Title I services on
private school premises during school hours. Under the
plan, only public employees could serve as Title I instructors and counselors. Id., at 406. Assignments to private
schools were made on a voluntary basis and without regard
to the religious affiliation of the employee or the wishes of
the private school. Ibid.; 739 F. 2d, at 53. As the Court of
Appeals in Aguilar observed, a large majority of Title I
teachers worked in nonpublic schools with religious affiliations different from their own. 473 U. S., at 406. The vast
majority of Title I teachers also moved among the private
schools, spending fewer than five days a week at the same
school. Ibid.

Before any public employee could provide Title I instruction at a private school, she would be given a detailed set of
written and oral instructions emphasizing the secular purpose of Title I and setting out the rules to be followed to
ensure that this purpose was not compromised. Specifically,
employees would be told that (i) they were employees of the
Board and accountable only to their public school supervisors; (ii) they had exclusive responsibility for selecting students for the Title I program and could teach only those children who met the eligibility criteria for Title I; (iii) their
materials and equipment would be used only in the Title I
program; (iv) they could not engage in team teaching or
other cooperative instructional activities with private school
teachers; and (v) they could not introduce any religious matter into their teaching or become involved in any way with
the religious activities of the private schools. Ibid. All religious symbols were to be removed from classrooms used

Opinion of the Court
for Title I services. Id., at 407. The rules acknowledgedthat it might be necessary for Title I teachers to consult with

a student's regular classroom teacher to assess the student'sparticular needs and progress, but admonished instructors
to limit those consultations to mutual professional concernsregarding the student's education. 739 F. 2d, at 53. To ensure compliance with these rules, a publicly employed fieldsupervisor was to attempt to make at least one unannounced
visit to each teacher's classroom every month. 473 U. S.,at 407.

In 1978, six federal taxpayers--respondents here--suedthe Board in the District Court for the Eastern District of
New York. Respondents sought declaratory and injunctiverelief, claiming that the Board's Title I program violated the
Establishment Clause. The District Court permitted theparents of a number of parochial school students who were
receiving Title I services to intervene as codefendants. TheDistrict Court granted summary judgment for the Board,
but the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed.While noting that the Board's Title I program had "done so
much good and little, if any, detectable harm," 739 F. 2d,at 72, the Court of Appeals nevertheless held that

Meek v.Pittenger, 421 U. S. 349 (1975), and Wolman v. Walter, 433

U. S. 229 (1977), compelled it to declare the program uncon-stitutional. In a 5-to-4 decision, this Court affirmed on the
ground that the Board's Title I program necessitated an "excessive entanglement of church and state in the administra-tion of [Title I] benefits." 473 U. S., at 414. On remand,

the District Court permanently enjoined the Board

"from using public funds for any plan or program under
[Title I] to the extent that it requires, authorizes or per-mits public school teachers and guidance counselors to

provide teaching and counseling services on the prem-ises of sectarian schools within New York City." App.

Opinion of the Court
The Board, like other LEA's across the United States,
modified its Title I program so it could continue serving
those students who attended private religious schools.
Rather than offer Title I instruction to parochial school students at their schools, the Board reverted to its prior practice of providing instruction at public school sites, at leased
sites, and in mobile instructional units (essentially vans converted into classrooms) parked near the sectarian school.
The Board also offered computer-aided instruction, which
could be provided "on premises" because it did not require
public employees to be physically present on the premises of
a religious school. App. 315.

It is not disputed that the additional costs of complying
with Aguilar's mandate are significant. Since the 1986-
1987 school year, the Board has spent over $100 million
providing computer-aided instruction, leasing sites and mobile instructional units, and transporting students to those
sites. App. 333 ($93.2 million spent between 1986-1987 and
1993-1994 school years); id., at 336 (annual additional costs
average around $15 million). Under the Secretary of Education's regulations, those costs "incurred as a result of implementing alternative delivery systems to comply with the requirements of Aguilar v. Felton" and not paid for with other
state or federal funds are to be deducted from the federal
grant before the Title I funds are distributed to any student.
34 CFR $ 200.27(c) (1996). These "Aguilar costs" thus reduce the amount of Title I money an LEA has available
for remedial education, and LEA's have had to cut back on
the number of students who receive Title I benefits. From
Title I funds available for New York City children between
the 1986-1987 and the 1993-1994 school years, the Board had
to deduct $7.9 million "off-the-top" for compliance with
Aguilar. App. 333. When Aguilar was handed down, it
was estimated that some 20,000 economically disadvantaged
children in the city of New York, see 473 U. S., at 431

would experience a decline in Title I services. See alsoS. Rep. No. 100-222, p. 14 (1987) (estimating that

Aguilar
costs have "resulted in a decline of about 35 percent in the
number of private school children who are served").In October and December of 1995, petitioners--the Board

and a new group of parents of parochial school students enti-tled to Title I services--filed motions in the District Court
seeking relief under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)from the permanent injunction entered by the District Court
on remand from our decision in Aguilar. Petitioners argued
that relief was proper under Rule 60(b)(5) and our decision
in Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, 502 U. S. 367, 388
(1992), because the "decisional law [had] changed to make
legal what the [injunction] was designed to prevent." Specifically, petitioners pointed to the statements of five Justices
in Board of Ed. of Kiryas Joel Village School Dist. v.
Grumet, 512 U. S. 687 (1994), calling for the overruling of
Aguilar. The District Court denied the motion. The District Court recognized that petitioners, "at bottom," sought
"a procedurally sound vehicle to get the [propriety of the
injunction] back before the Supreme Court," App. to Pet. for
Cert. in No. 96-553, p. A12, and concluded that "the Board
ha[d] properly proceeded under Rule 60(b) to seek relief
from the injunction." Id., at A19. Despite its observations
that "the landscape of Establishment Clause decisions has
changed," id., at A10, and that "[t]here may be good reason
to conclude that Aguilar's demise is imminent," id., at A20,
the District Court denied the Rule 60(b) motion on the merits because Aguilar's demise had "not yet occurred." The
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit "affirmed substantially for the reasons stated in" the District Court's opinion.

Opinion of the Court

II
The question we must answer is a simple one: Are petition-ers entitled to relief from the District Court's permanent injunction under Rule 60(b)? Rule 60(b)(5), the subsectionunder which petitioners proceeded below, states:

"On motion and upon such terms as are just, the courtmay relieve a party . . . from a final judgment [or] order
. . . [when] it is no longer equitable that the judgmentshould have prospective application."

In Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, supra, at 384, weheld that it is appropriate to grant a Rule 60(b)(5) motion
when the party seeking relief from an injunction or consentdecree can show "a significant change either in factual conditions or in law." A court may recognize subsequent changesin either statutory or decisional law. See

Railway Employees v. Wright, 364 U. S. 642, 652-653 (1961) (consent decreeshould be vacated under Rule 60(b) in light of amendments

to the Railway Labor Act); Rufo, supra, at 393 (vacating de-nial of Rule 60(b)(5) motion and remanding so District Court
could consider whether consent decree should be modifiedin light of Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520 (1979)); Pasadena
City Bd. of Ed. v. Spangler, 427 U. S. 424, 437-438 (1976)(injunction should have been vacated in light of

Swann v.Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed., 402 U. S. 1 (1971)). A

court errs when it refuses to modify an injunction or consentdecree in light of such changes. See Wright, supra, at
647 ("[T]he court cannot be required to disregard signifi-cant changes in law or facts if it is satisfied that what it has
been doing has been turned through changed circumstancesinto an instrument of wrong" (internal quotation marks
omitted)).Petitioners point to three changes in the factual and legal
landscape that they believe justify their claim for reliefunder Rule 60(b)(5). They first contend that the exorbitant
costs of complying with the District Court's injunction con521US1 Unit: $U79 [11-30-99 19:30:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN
216 AGOSTINI v. FELTON

Opinion of the Court
stitute a significant factual development warranting modifi-cation of the injunction. See Brief for Petitioner Agostini

et al. 38-40. Petitioners also argue that there have beentwo significant legal developments since

Aguilar was decided: a majority of Justices have expressed their views that
Aguilar should be reconsidered or overruled, see supra, at214; and

Aguilar has in any event been undermined by subsequent Establishment Clause decisions, including Witters v.
Washington Dept. of Servs. for Blind, 474 U. S. 481 (1986),
Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist., 509 U. S. 1 (1993),and

Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515
U. S. 819 (1995).

Respondents counter that, because the costs of providing
Title I services off site were known at the time Aguilar was
decided, and because the relevant case law has not changed,
the District Court did not err in denying petitioners' motions. Obviously, if neither the law supporting our original
decision in this litigation nor the facts have changed, there
would be no need to decide the propriety of a Rule 60(b)(5)
motion. Accordingly, we turn to the threshold issue
whether the factual or legal landscape has changed since we
decided Aguilar.

We agree with respondents that petitioners have failed to
establish the significant change in factual conditions required
by Rufo. Both petitioners and this Court were, at the time
Aguilar was decided, aware that additional costs would be
incurred if Title I services could not be provided in parochial
school classrooms. See App. 66-68 (Defendants' Joint Statement of Material Facts Not In Dispute, filed in 1982, detailing costs of providing off-premises services); Aguilar, 473
U. S., at 430-431 (O'Connor, J., dissenting) (observing that
costs of complying with Aguilar decision would likely cause
a decline in Title I services for 20,000 New York City students). That these predictions of additional costs turned out
to be accurate does not constitute a change in factual conditions warranting relief under Rule 60(b)(5). Accord, Rufo,

Opinion of the Court
supra, at 385 ("Ordinarily . . . modification should not begranted where a party relies upon events that actually were

anticipated at the time [the order was entered]").We also agree with respondents that the statements made
by five Justices in Kiryas Joel do not, in themselves, furnish
a basis for concluding that our Establishment Clause juris-prudence has changed. In

Kiryas Joel, we considered the
constitutionality of a New York law that carved out a publicschool district to coincide with the boundaries of the village

of Kiryas Joel, which was an enclave of the Satmar Hasidicsect. Before the new district was created, Satmar children
wishing to receive special educational services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), 20 U. S. C.

$ 1400 et seq., could receive those services at public schools
located outside the village. Because Satmar parents rarely
permitted their children to attend those schools, New York
created a new public school district within the boundaries of
the village so that Satmar children could stay within the
village but receive IDEA services on public school premises
from publicly employed instructors. In the course of our
opinion, we observed that New York had created the special
school district in response to our decision in Aguilar, which
had required New York to cease providing IDEA services to
Satmar children on the premises of their private religious
schools. 512 U. S., at 692. Five Justices joined opinions
calling for reconsideration of Aguilar. See 512 U. S., at 718
(O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); id., at 731 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment); id.,
at 750 (Scalia, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and Thomas,
J., dissenting). But the question of Aguilar's propriety was
not before us. The views of five Justices that the case
should be reconsidered or overruled cannot be said to have
effected a change in Establishment Clause law.

In light of these conclusions, petitioners' ability to satisfy the prerequisites of Rule 60(b)(5) hinges on whether
our later Establishment Clause cases have so undermined

Opinion of the Court
Aguilar that it is no longer good law. We now turn tothat inquiry.

III

A

In order to evaluate whether Aguilar has been eroded byour subsequent Establishment Clause cases, it is necessary

to understand the rationale upon which Aguilar, as well asits companion case, School Dist. of Grand Rapids v. Ball,
473 U. S. 373 (1985), rested.In

Ball, the Court evaluated two programs implementedby the School District of Grand Rapids, Michigan. The district's Shared Time program, the one most analogous to TitleI, provided remedial and "enrichment" classes, at public expense, to students attending nonpublic schools. The classeswere taught during regular school hours by publicly employed teachers, using materials purchased with publicfunds, on the premises of nonpublic schools. The Shared
Time courses were in subjects designed to supplement the"core curriculum" of the nonpublic schools.

Id., at 375-376.Of the 41 nonpublic schools eligible for the program, 40 were

" `pervasively sectarian' " in character--that is, " `the pur-pos[e] of [those] schools [was] to advance their particular religions.' " Id., at 379.The Court conducted its analysis by applying the threepart test set forth in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602(1971):

"First, the statute must have a secular legislative pur-pose; second, its principal or primary effect must be one
that neither advances nor inhibits religion; finally, thestatute must not foster an excessive government entanglement with religion." 473 U. S., at 382-383 (quoting
Lemon, supra, at 612-613) (citations and internal quota-tion marks omitted).

The Court acknowledged that the Shared Time programserved a purely secular purpose, thereby satisfying the first

521US1 Unit: $U79 [11-30-99 19:30:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN

219Cite as: 521 U. S. 203 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
part of the so-called Lemon test. 473 U. S., at 383. Never-theless, it ultimately concluded that the program had the impermissible effect of advancing religion. Id., at 385.The Court found that the program violated the Establishment Clause's prohibition against "government-financed or
government-sponsored indoctrination into the beliefs of aparticular religious faith" in at least three ways.

Ibid.
First, drawing upon the analysis in Meek v. Pittenger, 421U. S. 349 (1975), the Court observed that "the teachers

participating in the programs may become involved in in-tentionally or inadvertently inculcating particular religious
tenets or beliefs." 473 U. S., at 385. Meek invalidated a
Pennsylvania program in which full-time public employees
provided supplemental "auxiliary services"--remedial and
accelerated instruction, guidance counseling and testing, and
speech and hearing services--to nonpublic school children at
their schools. 473 U. S., at 367-373. Although the auxiliary
services themselves were secular, they were mostly dispensed on the premises of parochial schools, where "an atmosphere dedicated to the advancement of religious belief
[was] constantly maintained." Meek, 421 U. S., at 371. Instruction in that atmosphere was sufficient to create "[t]he
potential for impermissible fostering of religion." Id., at
372. Cf. Wolman v. Walter, 433 U. S., at 248 (upholding programs employing public employees to provide remedial instruction and guidance counseling to nonpublic school children at sites away from the nonpublic school).

The Court concluded that Grand Rapids' program shared
these defects. 473 U. S., at 386. As in Meek, classes were
conducted on the premises of religious schools. Accordingly,
a majority found a " `substantial risk' " that teachers--even
those who were not employed by the private schools--might
"subtly (or overtly) conform their instruction to the [pervasively sectarian] environment in which they [taught]." 473
U. S., at 388. The danger of "state-sponsored indoctrination" was only exacerbated by the school district's failure to

521US1 Unit: $U79 [11-30-99 19:30:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN
220 AGOSTINI v. FELTON

Opinion of the Court
monitor the courses for religious content. Id., at 387. No-tably, the Court disregarded the lack of evidence of any

specific incidents of religious indoctrination as largely ir-relevant, reasoning that potential witnesses to any indoctrination--the parochial school students, their parents, or parochial school officials--might be unable to detect or have littleincentive to report the incidents.

Id., at 388-389.
The presence of public teachers on parochial schoolgrounds had a second, related impermissible effect: It created a "graphic symbol of the `concert or union or depend-ency' of church and state,"

id., at 391 (quoting Zorach v.
Clauson, 343 U. S. 306, 312 (1952)), especially when perceived by "children in their formative years," 473 U. S., at
390. The Court feared that this perception of a symbolic
union between church and state would "conve[y] a message
of government endorsement . . . of religion" and thereby
violate a "core purpose" of the Establishment Clause. Id.,
at 389.

Third, the Court found that the Shared Time program impermissibly financed religious indoctrination by subsidizing
"the primary religious mission of the institutions affected."
Id., at 385. The Court separated its prior decisions evaluating programs that aided the secular activities of religious
institutions into two categories: those in which it concluded
that the aid resulted in an effect that was "indirect, remote,
or incidental" (and upheld the aid); and those in which it concluded that the aid resulted in "a direct and substantial advancement of the sectarian enterprise" (and invalidated the
aid). Id., at 393 (internal quotation marks omitted). In
light of Meek and Wolman, Grand Rapids' program fell into
the latter category. In those cases, the Court ruled that a
state loan of instructional equipment and materials to parochial schools was an impermissible form of "direct aid" because it "advanced the primary, religion-oriented educational
function of the sectarian school," 473 U. S., at 395 (citations
and internal quotation marks omitted), by providing "in521US1 Unit: $U79 [11-30-99 19:30:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN

221Cite as: 521 U. S. 203 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
kind" aid (e. g., instructional materials) that could be used toteach religion and by freeing up money for religious indoctrination that the school would otherwise have devoted to secu-lar education. Given the holdings in

Meek and Wolman, the
Shared Time program--which provided teachers as well as
instructional equipment and materials--was surely invalid.473 U. S., at 395. The

Ball Court likewise placed no weight
on the fact that the program was provided to the studentrather than to the school. Nor was the impermissible effect

mitigated by the fact that the program only supplementedthe courses offered by the parochial schools.

Id., at 395-
397.

The New York City Title I program challenged in Aguilar
closely resembled the Shared Time program struck down in
Ball, but the Court found fault with an aspect of the Title I
program not present in Ball: The Board had "adopted a system for monitoring the religious content of publicly funded
Title I classes in the religious schools." 473 U. S., at 409.
Even though this monitoring system might prevent the Title
I program from being used to inculcate religion, the Court
concluded, as it had in Lemon and Meek, that the level of
monitoring necessary to be "certain" that the program had
an exclusively secular effect would "inevitably resul[t] in the
excessive entanglement of church and state," thereby running afoul of Lemon's third prong. 473 U. S., at 409; see
Lemon, 403 U. S., at 619 (invalidating Rhode Island program
on entanglement grounds because "[a] comprehensive, discriminating, and continuing state surveillance will inevitably
be required to ensure that th[e] restrictions [against indoctrination] are obeyed"); Meek, supra, at 370 (invalidating
Pennsylvania program on entanglement grounds because
excessive monitoring would be required for the State to be
certain that public school officials do not inculcate religion).
In the majority's view, New York City's Title I program suffered from the "same critical elements of entanglement"
present in Lemon and Meek: the aid was provided "in a per521US1 Unit: $U79 [11-30-99 19:30:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN
222 AGOSTINI v. FELTON

Opinion of the Court
vasively sectarian environment . . . in the form of teachers,"requiring "ongoing inspection . . . to ensure the absence of

a religious message." 473 U. S., at 412. Such "pervasivemonitoring by public authorities in the sectarian schools infringes precisely those Establishment Clause values at theroot of the prohibition of excessive entanglement."

Id., at413. The Court noted two further forms of entanglement

inherent in New York City's Title I program: the "adminis-trative cooperation" required to implement Title I services
and the "dangers of political divisiveness" that might growout of the day-to-day decisions public officials would have to
make in order to provide Title I services. Id., at 413-414.Distilled to essentials, the Court's conclusion that the
Shared Time program in Ball had the impermissible effectof advancing religion rested on three assumptions: (i) any
public employee who works on the premises of a religiousschool is presumed to inculcate religion in her work; (ii) the
presence of public employees on private school premises cre-ates a symbolic union between church and state; and (iii) any
and all public aid that directly aids the educational functionof religious schools impermissibly finances religious indoctrination, even if the aid reaches such schools as a consequenceof private decisionmaking. Additionally, in Aguilar there
was a fourth assumption: that New York City's Title I pro-gram necessitated an excessive government entanglement
with religion because public employees who teach on thepremises of religious schools must be closely monitored to
ensure that they do not inculcate religion.

B
Our more recent cases have undermined the assumptionsupon which Ball and Aguilar relied. To be sure, the general principles we use to evaluate whether government aidviolates the Establishment Clause have not changed since
Aguilar was decided. For example, we continue to askwhether the government acted with the purpose of advanc521US1 Unit: $U79 [11-30-99 19:30:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN

223Cite as: 521 U. S. 203 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
ing or inhibiting religion, and the nature of that inquiry hasremained largely unchanged. See Witters, 474 U. S., at 485-

486; Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U. S. 589, 602-604 (1988) (con-cluding that Adolescent Family Life Act had a secular purpose); Board of Ed. of Westside Community Schools (Dist.
66) v. Mergens, 496 U. S. 226, 248-249 (1990) (concluding thatEqual Access Act has a secular purpose); cf. Edwards v.

Aguillard, 482 U. S. 578 (1987) (striking down Louisiana lawthat required creationism to be discussed with evolution in
public schools because the law lacked a legitimate secularpurpose). Likewise, we continue to explore whether the aid
has the "effect" of advancing or inhibiting religion. Whathas changed since we decided

Ball and Aguilar is our under-standing of the criteria used to assess whether aid to religion

has an impermissible effect.

1
As we have repeatedly recognized, government inculcationof religious beliefs has the impermissible effect of advancing

religion. Our cases subsequent to Aguilar have, however,modified in two significant respects the approach we use to
assess indoctrination. First, we have abandoned the pre-sumption erected in

Meek and Ball that the placement ofpublic employees on parochial school grounds inevitably results in the impermissible effect of state-sponsored indoctri-nation or constitutes a symbolic union between government
and religion. In Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist.,509 U. S. 1 (1993), we examined whether the IDEA, 20
U. S. C. $ 1400 et seq., was constitutional as applied to a deafstudent who sought to bring his state-employed signlanguage interpreter with him to his Roman Catholic highschool. We held that this was permissible, expressly disavowing the notion that "the Establishment Clause [laid]down [an] absolute bar to the placing of a public employee
in a sectarian school." 509 U. S., at 13. "Such a flat rule,smacking of antiquated notions of `taint,' would indeed exalt

521US1 Unit: $U79 [11-30-99 19:30:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN
224 AGOSTINI v. FELTON

Opinion of the Court
form over substance." Ibid. We refused to presume thata publicly employed interpreter would be pressured by the

pervasively sectarian surroundings to inculcate religion by"add[ing] to [or] subtract[ing] from" the lectures translated.
Ibid. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, we assumed instead that the interpreter would dutifully dischargeher responsibilities as a full-time public employee and comply

with the ethical guidelines of her profession by accuratelytranslating what was said.

Id., at 12. Because the only
government aid in Zobrest was the interpreter, who was her-self not inculcating any religious messages, no

government
indoctrination took place and we were able to conclude that"the provision of such assistance [was] not barred by the

Establishment Clause." Id, at 13. Zobrest therefore expressly rejected the notion--relied on in Ball and Aguilar--that, solely because of her presence on private school property, a public employee will be presumed to inculcate religionin the students.

Zobrest also implicitly repudiated another
assumption on which Ball and Aguilar turned: that the pres-ence of a public employee on private school property creates

an impermissible "symbolic link" between government andreligion.

Justice Souter contends that Zobrest did not undermine
the "presumption of inculcation" erected in Ball and
Aguilar, and that our conclusion to the contrary rests on
a "mistaken reading" of Zobrest. Post, at 248 (dissenting
opinion). In his view, Zobrest held that the Establishment
Clause tolerates the presence of public employees in sectarian schools "only . . . in . . . limited circumstances"--i. e.,
when the employee "simply translates for one student the
material presented to the class for the benefit of all students." Post, at 249. The sign-language interpreter in Zobrest is unlike the remedial instructors in Ball and Aguilar
because signing, Justice Souter explains, "[cannot] be understood as an opportunity to inject religious content in what
[is] supposed to be secular instruction." Post, at 248-249.
He is thus able to conclude that Zobrest is distinguishable

521US1 Unit: $U79 [11-30-99 19:30:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN

225Cite as: 521 U. S. 203 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
from--and therefore perfectly consistent with--Ball and
Aguilar.

In Zobrest, however, we did not expressly or implicitly rely
upon the basis Justice Souter now advances for distinguishing Ball and Aguilar. If we had thought that signers
had no "opportunity to inject religious content" into their
translations, we would have had no reason to consult the
record for evidence of inaccurate translations. 509 U. S., at
13. The signer in Zobrest had the same opportunity to inculcate religion in the performance of her duties as do Title
I employees, and there is no genuine basis upon which to
confine Zobrest's underlying rationale--that public employees will not be presumed to inculcate religion--to signlanguage interpreters. Indeed, even the Zobrest dissenters
acknowledged the shift Zobrest effected in our Establishment Clause law when they criticized the majority for
"stray[ing] . . . from the course set by nearly five decades of
Establishment Clause jurisprudence." Id., at 24 (Blackmun,
J., dissenting). Thus, it was Zobrest--and not this litigation--that created "fresh law." Post, at 249. Our refusal
to limit Zobrest to its facts despite its rationale does not, in
our view, amount to a "misreading" of precedent.

Second, we have departed from the rule relied on in Ball
that all government aid that directly assists the educational
function of religious schools is invalid. In Witters v. Washington Dept. of Servs. for Blind, 474 U. S. 481 (1986), we held
that the Establishment Clause did not bar a State from issuing a vocational tuition grant to a blind person who wished
to use the grant to attend a Christian college and become a
pastor, missionary, or youth director. Even though the
grant recipient clearly would use the money to obtain religious education, we observed that the tuition grants were
" `made available generally without regard to the sectariannonsectarian, or public-nonpublic nature of the institution
benefited.' " Id., at 487 (quoting Committee for Public
Ed. & Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, 413 U. S. 756, 782-783,

521US1 Unit: $U79 [11-30-99 19:30:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN
226 AGOSTINI v. FELTON

Opinion of the Court
n. 38 (1973)). The grants were disbursed directly to stu-dents, who then used the money to pay for tuition at the

educational institution of their choice. In our view, thistransaction was no different from a State's issuing a paycheck to one of its employees, knowing that the employee
would donate part or all of the check to a religious institu-tion. In both situations, any money that ultimately went to

religious institutions did so "only as a result of the genuinelyindependent and private choices of " individuals. 474 U. S.,
at 487. The same logic applied in Zobrest, where we allowedthe State to provide an interpreter, even though she would
be a mouthpiece for religious instruction, because the
IDEA's neutral eligibility criteria ensured that the interpreter's presence in a sectarian school was a "result of the private decision of individual parents" and "[could not] be attributed to state decisionmaking." 509 U. S., at 10 (emphasis
added). Because the private school would not have provided an interpreter on its own, we also concluded that the
aid in Zobrest did not indirectly finance religious education
by "reliev[ing] [the] sectarian schoo[l] of costs [it] otherwise

Zobrest and Witters make clear that, under current law,
the Shared Time program in Ball and New York City's Title
I program in Aguilar will not, as a matter of law, be deemed
to have the effect of advancing religion through indoctrination. Indeed, each of the premises upon which we relied in
Ball to reach a contrary conclusion is no longer valid. First,
there is no reason to presume that, simply because she enters
a parochial school classroom, a full-time public employee such
as a Title I teacher will depart from her assigned duties and
instructions and embark on religious indoctrination, any
more than there was a reason in Zobrest to think an interpreter would inculcate religion by altering her translation of
classroom lectures. Certainly, no evidence has ever shown
that any New York City Title I instructor teaching on parochial school premises attempted to inculcate religion in stu521US1 Unit: $U79 [11-30-99 19:30:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Thus, both our precedent and our experience require us to
reject respondents' remarkable argument that we must pre-sume Title I instructors to be "uncontrollable and sometimes

very unprofessional." Tr. of Oral Arg. 39.As discussed above,

Zobrest also repudiates Ball's assumption that the presence of Title I teachers in parochial schoolclassrooms will, without more, create the impression of a

"symbolic union" between church and state. Justice Souter maintains that Zobrest is not dispositive on this point
because Aguilar's implicit conclusion that New York City's
Title I program created a "symbolic union" rested on more
than the presence of Title I employees on parochial school
grounds. Post, at 250. To him, Title I continues to foster
a "symbolic union" between the Board and sectarian schools
because it mandates "the involvement of public teachers in
the instruction provided within sectarian schools," ibid., and
"fus[es] public and private faculties," post, at 254. Justice
Souter does not disavow the notion, uniformly adopted by
lower courts, that Title I services may be provided to sectarian school students in off-campus locations, post, at 246-247,
even though that notion necessarily presupposes that the
danger of "symbolic union" evaporates once the services are
provided off campus. Taking this view, the only difference
between a constitutional program and an unconstitutional
one is the location of the classroom, since the degree of cooperation between Title I instructors and parochial school faculty is the same no matter where the services are provided.
We do not see any perceptible (let alone dispositive) difference in the degree of symbolic union between a student receiving remedial instruction in a classroom on his sectarian
school's campus and one receiving instruction in a van parked
just at the school's curbside. To draw this line based solely on

228 AGOSTINI v. FELTON

Opinion of the Court
the location of the public employee is neither "sensible" nor"sound,"

post, at 247, and the Court in Zobrest rejected it.
Nor under current law can we conclude that a programplacing full-time public employees on parochial campuses to

provide Title I instruction would impermissibly finance religious indoctrination. In all relevant respects, the provisionof instructional services under Title I is indistinguishable

from the provision of sign-language interpreters under theIDEA. Both programs make aid available only to eligible
recipients. That aid is provided to students at whateverschool they choose to attend. Although Title I instruction is
provided to several students at once, whereas an interpreter
provides translation to a single student, this distinction is
not constitutionally significant. Moreover, as in Zobrest,
Title I services are by law supplemental to the regular curricula. 34 CFR $ 200.12(a) (1996). These services do not,
therefore, "reliev[e] sectarian schools of costs they otherwise
would have borne in educating their students." 509 U. S.,
at 12.

Justice Souter finds our conclusion that the IDEA and
Title I programs are similar to be "puzzling," and points to
three differences he perceives between the programs: (i)
Title I services are distributed by LEA's "directly to the
religious schools" instead of to individual students pursuant
to a formal application process; (ii) Title I services "necessarily reliev[e] a religious school of `an expense that it otherwise
would have assumed' "; and (iii) Title I provides services to
more students than did the programs in Witters and Zobrest.
Post, at 251-252. None of these distinctions is meaningful.
While it is true that individual students may not directly
apply for Title I services, it does not follow from this premise
that those services are distributed "directly to the religious
schools," post, at 252. In fact, they are not. No Title I
funds ever reach the coffers of religious schools, cf. Committee for Public Ed. and Religious Liberty v. Regan, 444 U. S.
646, 657-659 (1980) (involving a program giving "direct cash

521US1 Unit: $U79 [11-30-99 19:30:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
reimbursement" to religious schools for performing certainstate-mandated tasks), and Title I services may not be provided to religious schools on a schoolwide basis, 34 CFR$ 200.12(b) (1996). Title I funds are instead distributed to a
public agency (an LEA) that dispenses services directly to
the eligible students within its boundaries, no matter wherethey choose to attend school. 20 U. S. C. $$ 6311, 6312.

Moreover, we fail to see how providing Title I services di-rectly to eligible students results in a greater financing of
religious indoctrination simply because those students arenot first required to submit a formal application.

We are also not persuaded that Title I services supplant
the remedial instruction and guidance counseling already
provided in New York City's sectarian schools. Although
Justice Souter maintains that the sectarian schools provide such services and that those schools reduce those services once their students begin to receive Title I instruction,
see post, at 244, 246, 251-252, 254, his claims rest on speculation about the impossibility of drawing any line between supplemental and general education, see post, at 246, and not on
any evidence in the record that the Board is in fact violating
Title I regulations by providing services that supplant those
offered in the sectarian schools. See 34 CFR $ 200.12(a)
(1996). We are unwilling to speculate that all sectarian
schools provide remedial instruction and guidance counseling
to their students, and are unwilling to presume that the
Board would violate Title I regulations by continuing to provide Title I services to students who attend a sectarian
school that has curtailed its remedial instruction program in
response to Title I. Nor are we willing to conclude that the
constitutionality of an aid program depends on the number
of sectarian school students who happen to receive the otherwise neutral aid. Zobrest did not turn on the fact that
James Zobrest had, at the time of litigation, been the only
child using a publicly funded sign-language interpreter to
attend a parochial school. Accord, Mueller v. Allen, 463

Opinion of the Court
U. S. 388, 401 (1983) ("We would be loath to adopt a rulegrounding the constitutionality of a facially neutral law on

annual reports reciting the extent to which various classesof private citizens claimed benefits under the law").

What is most fatal to the argument that New York City'sTitle I program directly subsidizes religion is that it applies
with equal force when those services are provided off cam-pus, and

Aguilar implied that providing the services off cam-pus is entirely consistent with the Establishment Clause.

Justice Souter resists the impulse to upset this implica-tion, contending that it can be justified on the ground that
Title I services are "less likely to supplant some of whatwould otherwise go on inside [the sectarian schools] and to
subsidize what remains" when those services are offered offcampus.

Post, at 247. But Justice Souter does not ex-plain why a sectarian school would not have the same incentive to "make patently significant cutbacks" in its curriculumno matter where Title I services are offered, since the school
would ostensibly be excused from having to provide the TitleI-type services itself. See

ibid. Because the incentive isthe same either way, we find no logical basis upon which to

conclude that Title I services are an impermissible subsidyof religion when offered on campus, but not when offered off
campus. Accordingly, contrary to our conclusion in Aguilar,placing full-time employees on parochial school campuses
does not as a matter of law have the impermissible effect ofadvancing religion through indoctrination.

2
Although we examined in Witters and Zobrest the criteriaby which an aid program identifies its beneficiaries, we did

so solely to assess whether any use of that aid to indoctrinatereligion could be attributed to the State. A number of our
Establishment Clause cases have found that the criteria usedfor identifying beneficiaries are relevant in a second respect,
apart from enabling a court to evaluate whether the program

521US1 Unit: $U79 [11-30-99 19:30:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN

231Cite as: 521 U. S. 203 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
subsidizes religion. Specifically, the criteria might them-selves have the effect of advancing religion by creating a

financial incentive to undertake religious indoctrination.Cf.

Witters, 474 U. S., at 488 (upholding neutrally available
program because it did not "creat[e a] financial incentive for
students to undertake sectarian education"); Zobrest, supra,at 10 (upholding neutrally available IDEA aid because it

"creates no financial incentive for parents to choose a sectar-ian school"); accord,

post, at 253 (Souter, J., dissenting)
("[E]venhandedness is a necessary but not a sufficient condi-tion for an aid program to satisfy constitutional scrutiny").

This incentive is not present, however, where the aid is allocated on the basis of neutral, secular criteria that neither
favor nor disfavor religion, and is made available to both religious and secular beneficiaries on a nondiscriminatory basis.
Under such circumstances, the aid is less likely to have the
effect of advancing religion. See Widmar v. Vincent, 454
U. S. 263, 274 (1981) ("The provision of benefits to so broad a
spectrum of groups is an important index of secular effect").

In Ball and Aguilar, the Court gave this consideration no
weight. Before and since those decisions, we have sustained
programs that provided aid to all eligible children regardless
of where they attended school. See, e. g., Everson v. Board
of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U. S. 1, 16-18 (1947) (sustaining local
ordinance authorizing all parents to deduct from their state
tax returns the costs of transporting their children to school
on public buses); Board of Ed. of Central School Dist. No. 1
v. Allen, 392 U. S. 236, 243-244 (1968) (sustaining New York
law loaning secular textbooks to all children); Mueller v.
Allen, supra, at 398-399 (sustaining Minnesota statute
allowing all parents to deduct actual costs of tuition, textbooks, and transportation from state tax returns); Witters,
supra, at 487-488 (sustaining Washington law granting all
eligible blind persons vocational assistance); Zobrest, 509
U. S., at 10 (sustaining section of IDEA providing all "disabled" children with necessary aid).

521US1 Unit: $U79 [11-30-99 19:30:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN
232 AGOSTINI v. FELTON

Opinion of the Court
Applying this reasoning to New York City's Title I pro-gram, it is clear that Title I services are allocated on the

basis of criteria that neither favor nor disfavor religion.34 CFR $ 200.10(b) (1996); see supra, at 209-210. The services are available to all children who meet the Act's eligi-bility requirements, no matter what their religious beliefs
or where they go to school, 20 U. S. C. $ 6312(c)(1)(F). TheBoard's program does not, therefore, give aid recipients any
incentive to modify their religious beliefs or practices inorder to obtain those services.

3
We turn now to Aguilar's conclusion that New York City'sTitle I program resulted in an excessive entanglement between church and state. Whether a government aid pro-gram results in such an entanglement has consistently been
an aspect of our Establishment Clause analysis. We haveconsidered entanglement both in the course of assessing
whether an aid program has an impermissible effect of ad-vancing religion, Walz v. Tax Comm'n of City of New York,
397 U. S. 664, 674 (1970), and as a factor separate and apartfrom "effect," Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S., at 612-613.
Regardless of how we have characterized the issue, however,the factors we use to assess whether an entanglement is "excessive" are similar to the factors we use to examine "effect."That is, to assess entanglement, we have looked to "the character and purposes of the institutions that are benefited, thenature of the aid that the State provides, and the resulting
relationship between the government and religious author-ity."

Id., at 615. Similarly, we have assessed a law's "ef-fect" by examining the character of the institutions benefited

(e. g., whether the religious institutions were "predominantlyreligious"), see

Meek, 421 U. S., at 363-364; cf. Hunt v. Mc-Nair, 413 U. S. 734, 743-744 (1973), and the nature of the aid

that the State provided (e. g., whether it was neutral andnonideological), see Everson, supra, at 18; Wolman, 433

521US1 Unit: $U79 [11-30-99 19:30:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN

233Cite as: 521 U. S. 203 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
U. S., at 244. Indeed, in Lemon itself, the entanglementthat the Court found "independently" to necessitate the program's invalidation also was found to have the effect of inhib-iting religion. See,

e. g., 403 U. S., at 620 ("[W]e cannot ignore here the danger that pervasive modern governmental
power will ultimately intrude on religion . . ."). Thus, it issimplest to recognize why entanglement is significant and

treat it--as we did in Walz--as an aspect of the inquiry intoa statute's effect.

Not all entanglements, of course, have the effect of advanc-ing or inhibiting religion. Interaction between church and
state is inevitable, see 403 U. S., at 614, and we have always
tolerated some level of involvement between the two. Entanglement must be "excessive" before it runs afoul of the
Establishment Clause. See, e. g., Bowen v. Kendrick, 487
U. S., at 615-617 (no excessive entanglement where government reviews the adolescent counseling program set up by
the religious institutions that are grantees, reviews the materials used by such grantees, and monitors the program by
periodic visits); Roemer v. Board of Public Works of Md.,
426 U. S. 736, 764-765 (1976) (no excessive entanglement
where State conducts annual audits to ensure that categorical state grants to religious colleges are not used to teach
religion).

The pre-Aguilar Title I program does not result in an "excessive" entanglement that advances or inhibits religion.
As discussed previously, the Court's finding of "excessive"
entanglement in Aguilar rested on three grounds: (i) the
program would require "pervasive monitoring by public authorities" to ensure that Title I employees did not inculcate
religion; (ii) the program required "administrative cooperation" between the Board and parochial schools; and (iii) the
program might increase the dangers of "political divisiveness." 473 U. S., at 413-414. Under our current understanding of the Establishment Clause, the last two considerations are insufficient by themselves to create an "excessive"

521US1 Unit: $U79 [11-30-99 19:30:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN
234 AGOSTINI v. FELTON

Opinion of the Court
entanglement. They are present no matter where Title Iservices are offered, and no court has held that Title I services cannot be offered off campus. Aguilar, supra (limitingholding to on-premises services);

Walker v. San Francisco
Unified School Dist., 46 F. 3d 1449 (CA9 1995) (same); Pulido
v. Cavazos, 934 F. 2d 912, 919-920 (CA8 1991); Committee
for Public Ed. & Religious Liberty v. Secretary, United
States Dept. of Ed., 942 F. Supp. 842 (EDNY 1996) (same).Further, the assumption underlying the first consideration

has been undermined. In Aguilar, the Court presumed thatfull-time public employees on parochial school grounds would
be tempted to inculcate religion, despite the ethical standards they were required to uphold. Because of this risk pervasive monitoring would be required. But after Zobrest we
no longer presume that public employees will inculcate religion simply because they happen to be in a sectarian environment. Since we have abandoned the assumption that
properly instructed public employees will fail to discharge
their duties faithfully, we must also discard the assumption
that pervasive monitoring of Title I teachers is required.
There is no suggestion in the record before us that unannounced monthly visits of public supervisors are insufficient
to prevent or to detect inculcation of religion by public employees. Moreover, we have not found excessive entanglement in cases in which States imposed far more onerous burdens on religious institutions than the monitoring system at
issue here. See Bowen, supra, at 615-617.

To summarize, New York City's Title I program does not
run afoul of any of three primary criteria we currently use
to evaluate whether government aid has the effect of advancing religion: It does not result in governmental indoctrination; define its recipients by reference to religion; or create
an excessive entanglement. We therefore hold that a federally funded program providing supplemental, remedial instruction to disadvantaged children on a neutral basis is not
invalid under the Establishment Clause when such instruc521US1 Unit: $U79 [11-30-99 19:30:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
tion is given on the premises of sectarian schools by govern-ment employees pursuant to a program containing safeguards such as those present here. The same considerationsthat justify this holding require us to conclude that this carefully constrained program also cannot reasonably be viewedas an endorsement of religion. Accord,

Witters, 474 U. S.,at 488-489 ("[T]he mere circumstance that [an aid recipient]

has chosen to use neutrally available state aid to help payfor [a] religious education [does not] confer any message of
state endorsement of religion"); Bowen, supra, at 613-614(finding no " `symbolic link' " when Congress made federal
funds neutrally available for adolescent counseling). Ac-cordingly, we must acknowledge that

Aguilar, as well asthe portion of Ball addressing Grand Rapids' Shared Time

program, are no longer good law.

C
The doctrine of stare decisis does not preclude us fromrecognizing the change in our law and overruling

Aguilarand those portions of Ball inconsistent with our more recent

decisions. As we have often noted, "[s]tare decisis is not aninexorable command," Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 828
(1991), but instead reflects a policy judgment that "in mostmatters it is more important that the applicable rule of law
be settled than that it be settled right," Burnet v. Coronado
Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393, 406 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissent-ing). That policy is at its weakest when we interpret the

Constitution because our interpretation can be altered onlyby constitutional amendment or by overruling our prior decisions. Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44, 63(1996);

Payne, supra, at 828; St. Joseph Stock Yards Co. v.United States, 298 U. S. 38, 94 (1936) (Stone and Cardozo, JJ.,

concurring in result) ("The doctrine of stare decisis . . . hasonly a limited application in the field of constitutional law").
Thus, we have held in several cases that stare decisis doesnot prevent us from overruling a previous decision where

521US1 Unit: $U79 [11-30-99 19:30:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN
236 AGOSTINI v. FELTON

Opinion of the Court
there has been a significant change in, or subsequent development of, our constitutional law. United States v. Gaudin,
515 U. S. 506, 521 (1995) (stare decisis may yield where a
prior decision's "underpinnings [have been] eroded, by subsequent decisions of this Court"); Alabama v. Smith, 490 U. S.
794, 803 (1989) (noting that a "later development of . . . constitutional law" is a basis for overruling a decision); Planned
Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833, 857
(1992) (observing that a decision is properly overruled where
"development of constitutional law since the case was decided has implicitly or explicitly left [it] behind as a mere
survivor of obsolete constitutional thinking"). As discussed
above, our Establishment Clause jurisprudence has changed
significantly since we decided Ball and Aguilar, so our decision to overturn those cases rests on far more than "a present doctrinal disposition to come out differently from the
Court of [1985]." Casey, supra, at 864. We therefore overrule Ball and Aguilar to the extent those decisions are
inconsistent with our current understanding of the Establishment Clause.

Nor does the "law of the case" doctrine place any additional constraints on our ability to overturn Aguilar.
Under this doctrine, a court should not reopen issues decided
in earlier stages of the same litigation. Messenger v. Anderson, 225 U. S. 436, 444 (1912). The doctrine does not apply
if the court is "convinced that [its prior decision] is clearly
erroneous and would work a manifest injustice." Arizona
v. California, 460 U. S. 605, 618, n. 8 (1983). In light of our
conclusion that Aguilar would be decided differently under
our current Establishment Clause law, we think adherence to
that decision would undoubtedly work a "manifest injustice,"
such that the law of the case doctrine does not apply. Accord, Davis v. United States, 417 U. S. 333, 342 (1974) (Court
of Appeals erred in adhering to law of the case doctrine
despite intervening Supreme Court precedent).

We therefore conclude that our Establishment Clauselaw has "significant[ly] change[d]" since we decided

Agui-lar. See Rufo, 502 U. S., at 384. We are only left to decide whether this change in law entitles petitioners to reliefunder Rule 60(b)(5). We conclude that it does. Our general
practice is to apply the rule of law we announce in a caseto the parties before us. Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/
American Express, Inc., 490 U. S. 477, 485 (1989) ("The gen-eral rule of long standing is that the law announced in the
Court's decision controls the case at bar"). We adhere tothis practice even when we overrule a case. In

AdarandConstructors, Inc. v. Pen
~ a, 515 U. S. 200 (1995), for example,the District Court and Court of Appeals rejected the argument that racial classifications in federal programs should beevaluated under strict scrutiny, relying upon our decision
in Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC, 497 U. S. 547 (1990).When we granted certiorari and overruled Metro Broadcasting, we did not hesitate to vacate the judgments of the lowercourts. In doing so, we necessarily concluded that those
courts relied on a legal principle that had not withstood thetest of time. 515 U. S., at 237-238. See also Hubbard v.
United States, 514 U. S. 695, 715 (1995) (overruling decisionrelied upon by Court of Appeals and reversing the lower
court's judgment that relied upon the overruled case).We do not acknowledge, and we do not hold, that other
courts should conclude our more recent cases have, by impli-cation, overruled an earlier precedent. We reaffirm that
"[i]f a precedent of this Court has direct application in a case,yet appears to rest on reasons rejected in some other line of
decisions, the Court of Appeals should follow the case whichdirectly controls, leaving to this Court the prerogative of
overruling its own decisions." Rodriguez de Quijas, supra,at 484. Adherence to this teaching by the District Court
and Court of Appeals in this litigation does not insulate alegal principle on which they relied from our review to deter521US1 Unit: $U79 [11-30-99 19:30:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
mine its continued vitality. The trial court acted within itsdiscretion in entertaining the motion with supporting allegations, but it was also correct to recognize that the motionhad to be denied unless and until this Court reinterpreted
the binding precedent.

Respondents and Justice Ginsburg urge us to adopt adifferent analysis because we are reviewing the District

Court's denial of petitioners' Rule 60(b)(5) motion for anabuse of discretion. See

Browder v. Director, Dept. of Corrections of Ill., 434 U. S. 257, 263, n. 7 (1978). It is true thatthe trial court has discretion, but the exercise of discretion

cannot be permitted to stand if we find it rests upon a legal
principle that can no longer be sustained. See Cooter & Gell
v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U. S. 384, 405 (1990). The standard
of review we employ in this litigation does not therefore require us to depart from our general practice. See Adarand,
supra; Hubbard, supra.

Respondents nevertheless contend that we should not
grant Rule 60(b)(5) relief here, in spite of its propriety in
other contexts. They contend that petitioners have used
Rule 60(b)(5) in an unprecedented way--not as a means of
recognizing changes in the law, but as a vehicle for effecting
them. If we were to sanction this use of Rule 60(b)(5), respondents argue, we would encourage litigants to burden the
federal courts with a deluge of Rule 60(b)(5) motions premised on nothing more than the claim that various judges or
Justices have stated that the law has changed. See also
post, at 260 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (contending that
granting Rule 60(b)(5) relief in this litigation will encourage
"invitations to reconsider old cases based on `speculat[ions]
on chances from changes in [the Court's membership]"). We
think their fears are overstated. As we noted above, a
judge's stated belief that a case should be overruled does not
make it so. See supra, at 217.

Most importantly, our decision today is intimately tied
to the context in which it arose. This litigation involves a

521US1 Unit: $U79 [11-30-99 19:30:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
party's request under Rule 60(b)(5) to vacate a continuinginjunction entered some years ago in light of a bona fide,

significant change in subsequent law. The clause of Rule60(b)(5) that petitioners invoke applies by its terms only to
"judgment[s] hav[ing] prospective application." Intervening developments in the law by themselves rarely constitutethe extraordinary circumstances required for relief under

Rule 60(b)(6), the only remaining avenue for relief on thisbasis from judgments lacking any prospective component.
See 12 J. Moore et al., Moore's Federal Practice $ 60.48[5][b],p. 60-181 (3d ed. 1997) (collecting cases). Our decision will
have no effect outside the context of ordinary civil litigation
where the propriety of continuing prospective relief is at
issue. Cf. Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989) (applying a
more stringent standard for recognizing changes in the law
and "new rules" in light of the "interests of comity" present
in federal habeas corpus proceedings). Given that Rule
60(b)(5) specifically contemplates the grant of relief in the
circumstances presented here, it can hardly be said that
we have somehow warped the Rule into a means of "allowing an `anytime' rehearing." See post, at 259 (Ginsburg,
J., dissenting).

Respondents further contend that "[p]etitioners' [p]roposed [u]se of Rule 60(b) [w]ill [e]rode the [i]nstitutional [i]ntegrity of the Court." Brief for Respondents 26. Respondents do not explain how a proper application of Rule 60(b)(5)
undermines our legitimacy. Instead, respondents focus on
the harm occasioned if we were to overrule Aguilar. But

as discussed above, we do no violence to the doctrine of stare
decisis when we recognize bona fide changes in our decisional
law. And in those circumstances, we do no violence to the
legitimacy we derive from reliance on that doctrine. Casey,
505 U. S., at 865-866.

As a final matter, we see no reason to wait for a "better vehicle" in which to evaluate the impact of subsequent
cases on Aguilar's continued vitality. To evaluate the Rule

or signals any departure from "the responsive, non-agenda-setting character of this Court." Post, at 260 (

Ginsburg,
J., dissenting). Indeed, under these circumstances, it wouldbe particularly inequitable for us to bide our time waiting

In this novel proceeding, petitioners seek relief from aninjunction the District Court entered 12 years ago to implement our decision in Aguilar v. Felton, 473 U. S. 402 (1985).
For the reasons given by Justice Ginsburg, see post,p. 255, the Court's holding that petitioners are entitled to

relief under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) is seri-ously mistaken. The Court's misapplication of the Rule is
tied to its equally erroneous reading of our more recentEstablishment Clause cases, which the Court describes as
having rejected the underpinnings of Aguilar and portionsof

Aguilar's companion case, School Dist. of Grand Rapids
v. Ball, 473 U. S. 373 (1985). The result is to repudiate the
very reasonable line drawn in Aguilar and Ball, and toauthorize direct state aid to religious institutions on an un521US1 Unit: $U79 [11-30-99 19:30:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN

government.I respectfully dissent.

In both Aguilar and Ball, we held that supplemental in-struction by public school teachers on the premises of religious schools during regular school hours violated the Estab-lishment Clause. Aguilar, of course, concerned the very
school system before us here and the same Title I program atissue now, see ante, at 211-212, under which local educational
agencies receive public funds to provide remedial education,guidance, and job counseling to eligible students, including those attending religious schools. Immediately before
Aguilar, New York City used Title I funds to provide guid-ance services and classes in remedial reading, remedial mathematics, and English as a second language to students atreligious schools, as it did by sending employees of the public
school system, including teachers, guidance counselors, psy-chologists, and social workers, into the religious schools.
See Aguilar, supra, at 406. Ball involved a program similarin many respects to Title I called Shared Time,

1 under which

the local school district provided religious school studentswith "supplementary" classes in their religious schools,

taught by teachers who were full-time employees of the pub-lic schools, in subjects including remedial math and reading,
art, music, and physical education. See 473 U. S., at 375.We held that both schemes ran afoul of the Establishment
Clause. The Shared Time program had the impermissibleeffect of promoting religion in three ways: first, state-paid
teachers conducting classes in a sectarian environment might

program.

inadvertently (or intentionally) manifest sympathy with thesectarian aims to the point of using public funds for religious

educational purposes, id., at 388; second, the government'sprovision of secular instruction in religious schools produced
a symbolic union of church and state that tended to convey
a message to students and to the public that the State sup-ported religion,

id., at 390-392; and, finally, the Shared Time
program subsidized the religious functions of the religiousschools by assuming responsibility for teaching secular subjects the schools would otherwise be required to provide, id.,at 395-396. Our decision in

Aguilar noted the similarity
between the Title I and Shared Time programs, and held
that the system New York City had adopted to monitor the
religious content of Title I classes held in religious schools
would necessarily result in excessive entanglement of church
and state, and violate the Establishment Clause for that reason. See 473 U. S., at 412-414.

As I will indicate as I go along, I believe Aguilar was a
correct and sensible decision, and my only reservation about
its opinion is that the emphasis on the excessive entanglement produced by monitoring religious instructional content
obscured those facts that independently called for the application of two central tenets of Establishment Clause
jurisprudence. The State is forbidden to subsidize religion directly and is just as surely forbidden to act in any
way that could reasonably be viewed as religious endorsement. See, e. g., Ball, 473 U. S., at 385 ("Although Establishment Clause jurisprudence is characterized by few absolutes,
the Clause does absolutely prohibit government-financed or
government-sponsored indoctrination into the beliefs of a
particular religious faith"); id., at 389 ("Government promotes religion as effectively when it fosters a close identification of its powers and responsibilities with those of any--
or all--religious denominations as when it attempts to inculcate specific religious doctrines") (citing Lynch v. Donnelly,

465 U. S. 668, 688 (1984) (O'Connor, J., concurring)).

As is explained elsewhere, the flat ban on subsidizationantedates the Bill of Rights and has been an unwavering rule

in Establishment Clause cases, qualified only by the conclu-sion two Terms ago that state exactions from college students are not the sort of public revenues subject to the ban.
See Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515U. S. 819, 868-876 (1995) (

Souter, J., dissenting); see also
id., at 850 (O'Connor, J., concurring). The rule expressesthe hard lesson learned over and over again in the American

past and in the experiences of the countries from which wehave come, that religions supported by governments are
compromised just as surely as the religious freedom of dissenters is burdened when the government supports religion.
"When the government favors a particular religion or sect,
the disadvantage to all others is obvious, but even the favored religion may fear being `taint[ed] . . . with a corrosive
secularism.' The favored religion may be compromised as
political figures reshape the religion's beliefs for their own
purposes; it may be reformed as government largesse brings
government regulation." Lee v. Weisman, 505 U. S. 577, 608
(1992) (Blackmun, J., concurring) (quoting Ball, supra, at
385); see also Memorial and Remonstrance against Religious
Assessments 1785, in The Complete Madison 299, 309 (S.
Padover ed. 1953) ("Religion flourishes in greater purity,
without than with the aid of Gov[ernment]"); M. Howe, The
Garden and the Wilderness 6 (1965) (noting Roger Williams's
view that "worldly corruptions . . . might consume the
churches if sturdy fences against the wilderness were not
maintained"). The ban against state endorsement of religion addresses the same historical lessons. Governmental
approval of religion tends to reinforce the religious message
(at least in the short run) and, by the same token, to carry a
message of exclusion to those of less favored views. See,
e. g., Ball, supra, at 390 ("[A]n important concern of the effects test is whether the symbolic union of church and state
effected by the challenged governmental action is sufficiently

likely to be perceived by adherents of the controlling denomi-nations as an endorsement, and by the nonadherents as a

disapproval, of their individual religious choices"); Lee,
supra, at 606-607 (Blackmun, J., concurring) ("When the government puts its imprimatur on a particular religion, it conveys a message of exclusion to all those who do not adhereto the favored beliefs. A government cannot be premised

on the belief that all persons are created equal when it as-serts that God prefers some");

Engel v. Vitale, 370 U. S. 421,
429 (1962) ("[A]nguish, hardship and bitter strife" result"when zealous religious groups struggl[e] with one another

to obtain the Government's stamp of approval"). The
human tendency, of course, is to forget the hard lessons, and
to overlook the history of governmental partnership with
religion when a cause is worthy, and bureaucrats have programs. That tendency to forget is the reason for having the
Establishment Clause (along with the Constitution's other
structural and libertarian guarantees), in the hope of stopping the corrosion before it starts.

These principles were violated by the programs at issue
in Aguilar and Ball, as a consequence of several significant
features common to both Title I, as implemented in New
York City before Aguilar, and the Grand Rapids Shared
Time program: each provided classes on the premises of the
religious schools, covering a wide range of subjects including
some at the core of primary and secondary education, like
reading and mathematics; while their services were termed
"supplemental," the programs and their instructors necessarily assumed responsibility for teaching subjects that the
religious schools would otherwise have been obligated to
provide, cf. Wolman v. Walter, 433 U. S. 229, 243 (1977) (provision of diagnostic tests to religious schools provides only
an incidental benefit); the public employees carrying out the
programs had broad responsibilities involving the exercise
of considerable discretion, cf. Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills
School Dist., 509 U. S. 1, 13 (1993) (sign-language interpreter

must transmit exactly what is said); Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403
U. S. 602, 616-617 (1971) (distinguishing, for Establishment
Clause purposes, books provided by the State to students
from teachers paid by the State); while the programs offered
aid to nonpublic school students generally (and Title I went
to public school students as well), participation by religious
school students in each program was extensive, cf. Witters v.
Washington Dept. of Servs. for Blind, 474 U. S. 481, 488
(1986) (only one student sought state tuition assistance for
religious education); and, finally, aid under Title I and Shared
Time flowed directly to the schools in the form of classes and
programs, as distinct from indirect aid that reaches schools
only as a result of independent private choice, cf. Zobrest,
supra, at 12 ("[A]ny attenuated financial benefit that parochial schools do ultimately receive . . . is attributable to `the
private choices of individual parents' ") (quoting Mueller v.
Allen, 463 U. S. 388, 400 (1983)); Witters, supra, at 487 (aid
issued to students reached religious institution "only as a
result of the genuinely independent and private choices of
aid recipients"); Mueller, supra, at 399-400 (same).

What, therefore, was significant in Aguilar and Ball about
the placement of state-paid teachers into the physical and
social settings of the religious schools was not only the consequent temptation of some of those teachers to reflect the
schools' religious missions in the rhetoric of their instruction,
with a resulting need for monitoring and the certainty of
entanglement. See Aguilar, 473 U. S., at 412-414 (monitoring); Ball, 473 U. S., at 388 (risk of indoctrination). What
was so remarkable was that the schemes in issue assumed a
teaching responsibility indistinguishable from the responsibility of the schools themselves. The obligation of primary
and secondary schools to teach reading necessarily extends
to teaching those who are having a hard time at it, and the
same is true of math. Calling some classes remedial does
not distinguish their subjects from the schools' basic sub521US1 Unit: $U79 [11-30-99 19:30:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN
246 AGOSTINI v. FELTON

Souter, J., dissenting
jects, however inadequately the schools may have been ad-dressing them.

What was true of the Title I scheme as struck down in
Aguilar will be just as true when New York reverts to the
old practices with the Court's approval after today. There
is simply no line that can be drawn between the instructionpaid for at taxpayers' expense and the instruction in any

subject that is not identified as formally religious. While itwould be an obvious sham, say, to channel cash to religious
schools to be credited only against the expense of "secular"instruction, the line between "supplemental" and general education is likewise impossible to draw. If a State may constitutionally enter the schools to teach in the manner in question, it must in constitutional principle be free to assume, or
assume payment for, the entire cost of instruction provided
in any ostensibly secular subject in any religious school.
This Court explicitly recognized this in Ball, supra, at 394,
396, and although in Aguilar the Court concentrated on
entanglement it noted the similarity to Ball, see Aguilar,
supra, at 409, and Judge Friendly's opinion for the Second
Circuit made it expressly clear that there was no stopping
place in principle once the public teacher entered the religious schools to teach their secular subjects. See Felton v.
Secretary, U. S. Dept. of Education, 739 F. 2d 48, 66-67 (CA2
1984), aff 'd sub nom. Aguilar v. Felton, 473 U. S. 402 (1985).

It may be objected that there is some subsidy in remedial
education even when it takes place off the religious premises,
some subsidy, that is, even in the way New York City has
administered the Title I program after Aguilar. In these
circumstances, too, what the State does, the religious school
need not do; the schools save money and the program makes
it easier for them to survive and concentrate their resources
on their religious objectives. This argument may, of course,
prove too much, but if it is not thought strong enough to bar
even off-premises aid in teaching the basics to religious
school pupils (an issue not before the Court in Aguilar or

521US1 Unit: $U79 [11-30-99 19:30:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Souter, J., dissenting
today), it does nothing to undermine the sense of drawing aline between remedial teaching on and off premises. The

off-premises teaching is arguably less likely to open the doorto relieving religious schools of their responsibilities for secular subjects simply because these schools are less likely(and presumably legally unable) to dispense with those subjects from their curriculums or to make patently significantcutbacks in basic teaching within the schools to offset the
outside instruction; if the aid is delivered outside of theschools, it is less likely to supplant some of what would otherwise go on inside them and to subsidize what remains. Ontop of that, the difference in the degree of reasonably perceptible endorsement is substantial. Sharing the teaching re-sponsibilities within a school having religious objectives is
far more likely to telegraph approval of the school's missionthan keeping the State's distance would do. This is clear at
every level. As the Court observed in Ball, "[t]he symbol-ism of a union between church and state [effected by placing
the public school teachers into the religious schools] is mostlikely to influence children of tender years, whose experience
is limited and whose beliefs consequently are the function ofenvironment as much as of free and voluntary choice." 473
U. S., at 390. When, moreover, the aid goes overwhelminglyto one religious denomination, minimal contact between
state and church is less likely to feed the resentment of otherreligions that would like access to public money for their own
worthy projects.In sum, if a line is to be drawn short of barring all state
aid to religious schools for teaching standard subjects, theAguilar-Ball line was a sensible one capable of principled
adherence. It is no less sound, and no less necessary, today.

II
The Court today ignores this doctrine and claims that re-cent cases rejected the elemental assumptions underlying

Aguilar and much of Ball. But the Court errs. Its holding

521US1 Unit: $U79 [11-30-99 19:30:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN
248 AGOSTINI v. FELTON

Souter, J., dissenting
that Aguilar and the portion of Ball addressing the SharedTime program are "no longer good law," ante, at 235, rests

on mistaken reading. A

Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist., 509 U. S., at13-14, held that the Establishment Clause does not prevent
a school district from providing a sign-language interpreterto a deaf student enrolled in a sectarian school. The Court
today relies solely on Zobrest to support its contention thatwe have "abandoned the presumption erected in

Meek [v.Pittenger, 421 U. S. 349 (1975),] and Ball that the placement

of public employees on parochial school grounds inevitablyresults in the impermissible effect of state-sponsored indoctrination or constitutes a symbolic union between govern-ment and religion." Ante, at 223. Zobrest, however, is no
such sanction for overruling Aguilar or any portion of Ball.In

Zobrest, the Court did indeed recognize that the Estab-lishment Clause lays down no absolute bar to placing public

employees in a sectarian school, 509 U. S., at 13, and n. 10,but the rejection of such a per se rule was hinged expressly
on the nature of the employee's job, sign-language interpre-tation (or signing) and the circumscribed role of the signer.
On this point (and without reference to the facts that thebenefited student had received the same aid before enrolling
in the religious school and the employee was to be assignedto the student, not to the school) the Court explained itself
this way: "[T]he task of a sign-language interpreter seemsto us quite different from that of a teacher or guidance
counselor. . . . Nothing in this record suggests that a sign-language interpreter would do more than accurately interpret whatever material is presented to the class as a whole.In fact, ethical guidelines require interpreters to `transmit
everything that is said in exactly the same way it was in-tended.' " Id., at 13. The signer could thus be seen as more
like a hearing aid than a teacher, and the signing could notbe understood as an opportunity to inject religious content

521US1 Unit: $U79 [11-30-99 19:30:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN

249Cite as: 521 U. S. 203 (1997)
Souter, J., dissenting
in what was supposed to be secular instruction. Zobrestaccordingly holds only that in these limited circumstances

where a public employee simply translates for one studentthe material presented to the class for the benefit of all students, the employee's presence in the sectarian school does
not violate the Establishment Clause. Id., at 13-14. Cf.
Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S., at 617 ("[T]eachers have a
substantially different ideological character from books [and][i]n terms of potential for involving some aspect of faith or

morals in secular subjects, a textbook's content is ascertain-able, but a teacher's handling of a subject is not").

The Court, however, ignores the careful distinction drawn
in Zobrest and insists that a full-time public employee such
as a Title I teacher is just like the signer, asserting that
"there is no reason to presume that, simply because she enters a parochial school classroom, [this] teacher will depart
from her assigned duties and instructions and embark on religious indoctrination . . . ." Ante, at 226. Whatever may
be the merits of this position (and I find it short on merit),
it does not enjoy the authority of Zobrest. The Court may
disagree with Ball's assertion that a publicly employed
teacher working in a sectarian school is apt to reinforce the
pervasive inculcation of religious beliefs, but its disagreement is fresh law.

The Court tries to press Zobrest into performing another
service beyond its reach. The Court says that Ball and
Aguilar assumed "that the presence of a public employee on
private school property creates an impermissible `symbolic
link' between government and religion," ante, at 224, and
that Zobrest repudiated this assumption, ibid. First, Ball
and Aguilar said nothing about the "mere presence" of public employees at religious schools. It was Ball that specifically addressed the point and held only that when teachers
employed by public schools are placed in religious schools to
provide instruction to students during the schoolday a symbolic union of church and state is created and will reasonably

Souter, J., dissenting
be seen by the students as endorsement, see Ball, 473 U. S.,at 390-392; Aguilar adopted the same conclusion by reference, see 473 U. S., at 409. Zobrest did not, implicitly or oth-erwise, repudiate the view that the involvement of public
teachers in the instruction provided within sectarian schoolslooks like a partnership or union and implies approval of the
sectarian aim. On the subject of symbolic unions and thestrength of their implications, the lesson of

Zobrest is merelythat less is less.

B
The Court next claims that Ball rested on the assumptionthat "any and all public aid that directly aids the educational

function of religious schools impermissibly finances religiousindoctrination, even if the aid reaches such schools as a
consequence of private decisionmaking." Ante, at 222.After

Ball, the opinion continues, the Court departed fromthe rule that "all government aid that directly assists the

educational function of religious schools is invalid." Ante,at 225. But this mischaracterizes

Ball's discussion on thepoint, and misreads Witters and Zobrest as repudiating the

more modest proposition on which Ball in fact rested.Ball did not establish that "any and all" such aid to religious schools necessarily violates the Establishment Clause.It held that the Shared Time program subsidized the religious functions of the parochial schools by taking over a sig-nificant portion of their responsibility for teaching secular
subjects. See 473 U. S., at 396-397. The Court noted that
it had "never accepted the mere possibility of subsidization. . . as sufficient to invalidate an aid program," and instead

enquired whether the effect of the proffered aid was " `direct
and substantial' " (and, so, unconstitutional) or merely "indi-rect and incidental" (and, so, permissible), emphasizing that

the question " `is one of degree.' " Id., at 394 (quoting Committee for Public Ed. & Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, 413
U. S. 756, 784-785, n. 39 (1973), and Zorach v. Clauson, 343

521US1 Unit: $U79 [11-30-99 19:30:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Souter, J., dissenting
U. S. 306, 314 (1952)). Witters and Zobrest did nothing torepudiate the principle, emphasizing rather the limited nature of the aid at issue in each case as well as the fact thatreligious institutions did not receive it directly from the
State. In Witters, the Court noted that the State would
issue the disputed vocational aid directly to one student who
would then transmit it to the school of his choice, and that
there was no record evidence that "any significant portion of
the aid expended under the Washington program as a whole
will end up flowing to religious education." 474 U. S., at
488. Zobrest also presented an instance of a single beneficiary, see 509 U. S., at 4, and emphasized that the student
(who had previously received the interpretive services in a
public school) determined where the aid would be used, that
the aid at issue was limited, and that the religious school
was "not relieved of an expense that it otherwise would have
assumed in educating its students," id., at 12.

It is, accordingly, puzzling to find the Court insisting that
the aid scheme administered under Title I and considered
in Aguilar was comparable to the programs in Witters and
Zobrest. Instead of aiding isolated individuals within a
school system, New York City's Title I program before
Aguilar served about 22,000 private school students, all but
52 of whom attended religious schools. See App. 313-314.2
Instead of serving individual blind or deaf students, as such,
Title I as administered in New York City before Aguilar
(and as now to be revived) funded instruction in core subjects (remedial reading, reading skills, remedial mathemat2 The Court's refusal to recognize the extent of student participation as

for Blind, 474 U. S. 481 (1986), on this very point. See id., at 488 (noting,
among relevant factors, that "[n]o evidence ha[d] been presented indicating
that any other person ha[d] ever sought to finance religious education or
activity pursuant to the State's program").

ics, English as a second language) and provided guidanceservices. See Aguilar, supra, at 406. Instead of providing

a service the school would not otherwise furnish, the TitleI services necessarily relieved a religious school of "an
expense that it otherwise would have assumed," Zobrest,
supra, at 12, and freed its funds for other, and sectarian,uses.

Finally, instead of aid that comes to the religious schoolindirectly in the sense that its distribution results from private decisionmaking, a public educational agency distributesTitle I aid in the form of programs and services directly to
the religious schools. In Zobrest and Witters, it was fairto say that individual students were themselves applicants
for individual benefits on a scale that could not amount toa systemic supplement. But under Title I, a local educational agency (which in New York City is the Board of Edu-cation) may receive federal funding by proposing programs
approved to serve individual students who meet the crite-ria of need, which it then uses to provide such programs at
the religious schools, see App. 28-29, 38, 60, 242-243; stu-dents eligible for such programs may not apply directly for
Title I funds.3 The aid, accordingly, is not even formally aidto the individual students (and even formally individual aid
must be seen as aid to a school system when so many indi-viduals receive it that it becomes a significant feature of the
system, see Wolman v. Walter, 433 U. S., at 264 (opinion ofPowell, J.)).

In sum, nothing since Ball and Aguilar and before thislitigation has eroded the distinction between "direct and substantial" and "indirect and incidental." That principled lineis being breached only here and now.

3 For this reason, the Court's attempted analogy between Title I and the
Individuals with Disabilities Education Act fails, see ante, at 228; James
Zobrest, unlike students receiving Title I services, applied individually for
the interpretative services at issue in Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School
Dist., 509 U. S. 1, 4 (1993).

C
The Court notes that aid programs providing benefitssolely to religious groups may be constitutionally suspect,

while aid allocated under neutral, secular criteria is lesslikely to have the effect of advancing religion.

Ante, at 230-231. The opinion then says that Ball and Aguilar "gave

this consideration no weight," ante, at 231, and accordinglyconflict with a number of decisions. But what exactly the
Court thinks Ball and Aguilar inadequately considered isnot clear, given that evenhandedness is a necessary but not
a sufficient condition for an aid program to satisfy constitu-tional scrutiny. Title I services are available to all eligible
children regardless of whether they go to religious or publicschools, but, as I have explained elsewhere and am not alone
in recognizing, see, e. g., Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at 846-847(

O'Connor, J., concurring); id., at 879-885 (Souter, J., dis-senting); see also

Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U. S. 589, 614, 621(1988), that fact does not define the reach of the Establishment Clause. If a scheme of government aid results in sup-port for religion in some substantial degree, or in endorsement of its value, the formal neutrality of the scheme doesnot render the Establishment Clause helpless or the holdings
in Aguilar and Ball inapposite.

III
Finally, there is the issue of precedent. Stare decisis isno barrier in the Court's eyes because it reads Aguilar and

Ball for exaggerated propositions that Witters and Zobrestare supposed to have limited to the point of abandoned doctrine. Cf. Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164,173-174 (1989). The Court's dispensation from

stare decisisis, accordingly, no more convincing than its reading of those

cases. Since Aguilar came down, no case has held thatthere need be no concern about a risk that publicly paid
school teachers may further religious doctrine; no case hasrepudiated the distinction between direct and substantial aid

521US1 Unit: $U79 [11-30-99 19:30:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN
254 AGOSTINI v. FELTON

Souter, J., dissenting
and aid that is indirect and incidental; no case has held thatfusing public and private faculties in one religious school

does not create an impermissible union or carry an impermis-sible endorsement; and no case has held that direct subsidization of religious education is constitutional or that the
assumption of a portion of a religious school's teaching re-sponsibility is not direct subsidization.

The continuity of the law, indeed, is matched by the persis-tence of the facts. When

Aguilar was decided everyone
knew that providing Title I services off the premises of thereligious schools would come at substantial cost in efficiency,

convenience, and money. Title I had begun off the premises
in New York, after all, and dissatisfaction with the arrangement was what led the city to put the public school teachers
into the religious schools in the first place. See Felton v.
Secretary, U. S. Dept. of Education, 739 F. 2d, at 51. When
Aguilar required the end of that arrangement, conditions
reverted to those of the past and they have remained unchanged: teaching conditions are often poor, it is difficult to
move children around, and it costs a lot of money. That is,
the facts became once again what they were once before, as
everyone including the Members of this Court knew they
would be. No predictions have gone so awry as to excuse
the litigation from the claim of precedent, see Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393, 412 (1932) (Brandeis, J.,
dissenting), let alone excuse the Court from adhering to its
own prior decision in this very litigation.

That is not to deny that the facts just recited are regrettable; the object of Title I is worthy without doubt, and the
cost of compliance is high. In the short run there is much
that is genuinely unfortunate about the administration of the
scheme under Aguilar's rule. But constitutional lines have
to be drawn, and on one side of every one of them is an
otherwise sympathetic case that provokes impatience with
the Constitution and with the line. But constitutional lines
are the price of constitutional government.

Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice Souter, and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.

The Court today finds a way to rehear a legal questiondecided in respondents' favor in this very case some 12 years

ago. See Aguilar v. Felton, 473 U. S. 402 (1985). Sub-sequent decisions, the majority says, have undermined
Aguilar and justify our immediate reconsideration. ThisCourt's Rules do not countenance the rehearing here
granted. For good reason, a proper application of thoseRules and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure would lead
us to defer reconsideration of Aguilar until we are presentedwith the issue in another case.

We have a rule on rehearing, Rule 44, but it provides onlyfor petitions filed within 25 days of the entry of the judgment
in question. See this Court's Rule 44.1. Although theCourt or a Justice may "shorte[n] or exten[d]" this period, I
am aware of no case in which we have extended the time forrehearing years beyond publication of our adjudication on
the merits. Cf. Reid v. Covert, 354 U. S. 1 (1957) (originaldecision issued June 11, 1956; rehearing granted Nov. 5,
1956); Jones v. Opelika, 319 U. S. 103 (1943) (per curiam)
(original decision issued October Term 1941; rehearinggranted October Term 1942). Moreover, nothing in our procedures allows us to grant rehearing, timely or not, "except. . . at the instance of a Justice who concurred in the judgment or decision." This Court's Rule 44.1. Petitionershave not been so bold (or so candid) as to style their plea as
one for rehearing in this Court, and the Court has not takenup the petition at the instance of

Justice Stevens, the only
still-sitting Member of the Aguilar majority.

Lacking any rule or practice allowing us to reconsider the
Aguilar judgment directly, the majority accepts as a substitute a rule governing relief from judgments or orders of thefederal trial courts. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 60(b)(5). The

service to which Rule 60(b) has been impressed is unprece-dented, and neither the Court nor those urging reconsidera521US1 Unit: $U79 [11-30-99 19:30:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
tion of Aguilar contend otherwise. See, e. g., ante, at 238;Tr. of Oral Arg. 11 (acknowledgment by counsel for the

United States that "we do not know of another instance inwhich Rule 60(b) has been used in this way"). The Court
makes clear, fortunately, that any future efforts to expandtoday's ruling will not be favored. See

ante, at 238-239. Itherefore anticipate that the extraordinary action taken in

this case will remain aberrational.Rule 60(b) provides, in relevant part:

"On motion and upon such terms as are just, the [dis-trict] court may relieve a party or a party's legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding forthe following reasons: . . . (5) . . . it is no longer equitable
that the judgment should have prospective application."
Under that Rule, a district court may, in its discretion, grantrelief from a final judgment with prospective effect if the

party seeking modification can show "a significant changeeither in factual conditions or in law" that renders continued
operation of the judgment inequitable. Rufo v. Inmates ofSuffolk County Jail, 502 U. S. 367, 384 (1992) (addressing
modification of consent decree in institutional-reform set-ting); see 12 J. Moore, Moore's Federal Practice $ 60.47[2][c],
pp. 60-163 to 60-166 (3d ed. 1997); 11 C. Wright, A. Miller, &M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure $ 2863, pp. 336-347
(2d ed. 1995) (hereinafter Wright, Miller, & Kane).Appellate courts review denials of Rule 60(b) motions for
abuse of discretion. See Browder v. Director, Dept. of Corrections of Ill., 434 U. S. 257, 263, n. 7 (1978); Railway Em-ployees v. Wright, 364 U. S. 642, 648-650 (1961). As we recognized in our unanimous opinion in Browder, "an appealfrom denial of Rule 60(b) relief does not bring up the underlying judgment for review." 434 U. S., at 263, n. 7. For inthis context,

"[w]e are not framing a decree. We are asking our-selves whether anything has happened that will justify

521US1 Unit: $U79 [11-30-99 19:30:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
us now in changing a decree. The injunction, whetherright or wrong, is not subject to impeachment in its application to the conditions that existed at its making.We are not at liberty to reverse under the guise of readjusting." United States v. Swift & Co., 286 U. S. 106,119 (1932).

Cf. Illinois v. Illinois Central R. Co., 184 U. S. 77, 91-92(1902) (cautioning against entertaining successive appeals of
legal questions open to dispute in an initial appeal, and ob-serving that tolerance of such appeals would allow parties,
inter alia, to " `speculate on chances from changes in [acourt's] members' ") (quoting

Roberts v. Cooper, 20 How. 467,481 (1858)).

In short, relitigation of the legal or factual claims underly-ing the original judgment is not permitted in a Rule 60(b)
motion or an appeal therefrom. See 11 Wright, Miller, &Kane $ 2863, p. 340 (Rule 60(b) "does not allow relitigation of
issues that have been resolved by the judgment."); see also
Fortin v. Commissioner, Mass. Dept. of Public Welfare, 692F. 2d 790, 799 (CA1 1982) (warning against transformation

of Rule 60(b) "modification procedure into an impermissibleavenue of collateral attack"). Thus, under settled practice,
the sole question legitimately presented on appeal of the Dis-trict Court's decision denying petitioners' Rule 60(b)(5) motion to modify the Aguilar injunction would be: Did the Dis-trict Court abuse its discretion when it concluded that
neither the facts nor the law had so changed as to warrantalteration of the injunction?

The majority acknowledges that there has been no signifi-cant change in factual conditions. See

ante, at 216-217.The majority also recognizes that
Aguilar had not beenoverruled, but remained the governing Establishment

Clause law, until this very day. See ante, at 217, 236. Be-cause Aguilar had not been overruled at the time the District Court acted, the law the District Court was bound torespect had not changed. The District Court therefore did

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
not abuse its discretion in denying petitioners' Rule 60(b)motion.

We have declared that lower courts lack authority to de-termine whether adherence to a judgment of this Court is
inequitable. Those courts must "follow the [Supreme Court]
case which directly controls, leaving to this Court theprerogative of overruling its own decisions."

Rodriguez
de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490 U. S.477, 484 (1989); see also

ante, at 237-238. The District
Court would have disobeyed the plain command of Shearson/
American Express had it granted petitioners' Rule 60(b) motion based upon a view that our more recent Establishment
Clause decisions are in tension with Aguilar.

Without the teaching of Shearson/American Express,
Rule 60(b) might have been employed in a case of this kind.
Before that firm instruction, lower courts sometimes inquired whether an earlier ruling of this Court had been
eroded to the point that it was no longer good law. See,
e. g., Rowe v. Peyton, 383 F. 2d 709, 714 (CA4 1967), aff 'd,
391 U. S. 54 (1968); Perkins v. Endicott Johnson Corp., 128
F. 2d 208, 217-218 (CA2 1942), aff 'd, 317 U. S. 501 (1943);
Healy v. Edwards, 363 F. Supp. 1110, 1117 (ED La. 1973),
vacated and remanded for consideration of mootness, 421
U. S. 772 (1975) (per curiam); Browder v. Gayle, 142 F. Supp.
707, 716-717 (MD Ala.), summarily aff 'd, 352 U. S. 903 (1956).
Shearson/American Express now controls, however, so the
District Court and Court of Appeals in this case had no
choice but to follow Aguilar. Of course, "[a] district court
would necessarily abuse its discretion if it based its ruling
on an erroneous view of the law," Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx
Corp., 496 U. S. 384, 405 (1990) (cited ante, at 238), but the
District Court made no legal error in determining that
Aguilar had not been overruled. And our appellate role
here is limited to reviewing that determination.

The Court says that the District Court was right to "entertai[n]" the Rule 60(b) motion and also right to reject it,

521US1 Unit: $U79 [11-30-99 19:30:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
leaving to this Court the option of overruling our previouslybinding decision. See

ante, at 238. The Court thus acknowledges that Rule 60(b)(5) had no office to perform inthe District Court, given the no-competence instruction of

Shearson/American Express. All the lower courts could do
was pass the case up to us. The Court thus bends Rule60(b) to a purpose--allowing an "anytime" rehearing in this

case--unrelated to the governance of district court proceed-ings to which the Rule, as part of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure, is directed. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 1.In an effort to make today's use of Rule 60(b) appear palatable, the Court describes its decision not as a determination
of whether Aguilar should be overruled, but as an exploration whether Aguilar already has been "so undermined . . .
that it is no longer good law." Ante, at 217-218; see also
ante, at 222-235. But nothing can disguise the reality that,
until today, Aguilar had not been overruled. Good or bad,
it was in fact the law.

Despite the problematic use of Rule 60(b), the Court
"see[s] no reason to wait for a `better vehicle.' " Ante, at
239. There are such vehicles in motion, and the Court does
not say otherwise. See, e. g., Committee for Public Ed. and
Religious Liberty v. Secretary, U. S. Dept. of Ed., 942
F. Supp. 842 (EDNY 1996) (PEARL II); Helms v. Cody, 856
F. Supp. 1102 (ED La. 1994); cf. Brief for U. S. Secretary of
Education 45 (noting that a school district other than New
York City could bring an action against the Secretary to
challenge an Aguilar-based Title I funding decision). The
Helms case, which has been appealed to the Fifth Circuit,
involves an Establishment Clause challenge to Louisiana's
special education program. In PEARL II, the District
Court upheld aspects of New York City's current Title I program that were challenged under the Establishment Clause.
The plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal in that case, but the
parties later stipulated to withdraw the appeal, without
prejudice to reinstatement, pending our decision in this case.

of Helms, PEARL II, or perhaps another case in whichour review appropriately may be sought, before deciding
whether Aguilar should remain the law of the land. Thatcause lies in the maintenance of integrity in the interpretation of procedural rules, preservation of the responsive,non-agenda-setting character of this Court, and avoidance of
invitations to reconsider old cases based on "speculat[ions]on chances from changes in [the Court's membership]."

IDAHO et al. v. COEUR d'ALENE TRIBE OFIDAHO

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 94-1474. Argued October 16, 1996--Decided June 23, 1997
Alleging ownership in the submerged lands and bed of Lake Coeur d'Alene

and various of its navigable tributaries and effluents lying within the
original boundaries of the Coeur d'Alene Reservation (the submerged
lands), the Coeur d'Alene Tribe and various of its members (collectively,
the Tribe) filed this federal-court action against the State of Idaho, various state agencies, and numerous state officials in their individual capacities. The Tribe sought, inter alia, a declaratory judgment establishing
its entitlement to the exclusive use and occupancy and the right to quiet
enjoyment of the submerged lands, a declaration of the invalidity of all
Idaho laws, customs, or usages purporting to regulate those lands, and
a preliminary and permanent injunction prohibiting defendants from
taking any action in violation of the Tribe's rights in the lands. The
District Court dismissed the suit, but the Ninth Circuit affirmed in part,
reversed in part, and remanded. As here relevant, the latter court
agreed with the District Court that the Eleventh Amendment barred
all claims against the State and its agencies, as well as the quiet title
action against the officials. However, it found the doctrine of Ex parte
Young, 209 U. S. 123, applicable and allowed the claims for declaratory
and injunctive relief against the officials to proceed insofar as they
sought to preclude continuing violations of federal law. The court reasoned that those claims are based on Idaho's ongoing interference with
the Tribe's alleged ownership rights, and found it conceivable that the
Tribe could prove facts entitling it to relief on the claims.

Held: The judgment is reversed in part, and the case is remanded.
42 F. 3d 1244, reversed in part and remanded.

Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to
Parts I, II-A, and III, concluding that the Tribe's suit against the state
officials may not proceed in federal court. Pp. 267-270, 281-288.

(a) Because States enjoy Eleventh Amendment immunity in suits by
Indian tribes, Blatchford v. Native Village of Noatak, 501 U. S. 775, 782,
the present suit is barred unless it falls within the exception this Court
has recognized for certain suits seeking declaratory and injunctive relief
against state officers in their individual capacities, see, e. g., Ex parte

Syllabus
Young, supra. The Court does not question the continuing validity of
the Young doctrine, but acknowledges that questions will arise as to its
proper scope and application. In resolving these questions, the Court
must ensure that the sovereign immunity doctrine remains meaningful,
while also giving recognition to the need to prevent violations of federal
law. In a suit commenced against such officials, even if they are named
and served as individuals, the State itself will have a continuing interest
in the litigation whenever state policies or procedures are at stake.
See, e. g., Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U. S.
89, 114, n. 25. Pp. 267-270.

(b) The Tribe may not avoid the Eleventh Amendment bar and avail
itself of the Young exception in this action. In support of Young's applicability, the Tribe alleges an ongoing violation of its property rights
under federal law, seeks prospective injunctive relief, and attempts to
rely on the plurality decision in Florida Dept. of State v. Treasure Salvors, Inc., 458 U. S. 670. The latter case is not helpful because the state
officials there were acting beyond their state-conferred authority, id., at
696-697, a theory the Tribe does not even attempt to pursue in this
case. Moreover, although a request for prospective relief from an allegedly ongoing federal-law violation is ordinarily sufficient to invoke the
Young fiction, this case is unusual in that the Tribe's suit is the functional equivalent of a quiet title action implicating special sovereignty
interests. This is especially troubling when coupled with the farreaching and invasive relief the Tribe seeks, which would shift substantially all benefits of ownership and control of vast areas from the State
to the Tribe, and thereby entail consequences going well beyond those
typically present in a real property quiet title action. Furthermore,
the requested relief would divest the State of its control over lands
underlying navigable waters, which have historically been considered
uniquely "sovereign lands," see, e. g., Utah Div. of State Lands v. United
States, 482 U. S. 193, 195-198, title to which is conferred on the States
by the Constitution itself, see Oregon ex rel. State Land Bd. v. Corvallis
Sand & Gravel Co., 429 U. S. 363, 374. Indeed, Idaho law views its
interest in the submerged lands in such terms. Under these particular
and special circumstances, the Young exception is inapplicable. The
dignity and status of its statehood allows Idaho to rely on its Eleventh
Amendment immunity and to insist upon responding to these claims
in its own courts, which are open to hear and determine the case.

264 IDAHO v. COEUR d'ALENE TRIBE OF IDAHO

Opinion of the Court
I, II-A, and III, and an opinion with respect to Parts II-B,
II-C, and II-D, in which The Chief Justice joins.

In the northern region of Idaho, close by the Coeur
d'Alene Mountains which are part of Bitterroot Range, lies
tranquil Lake Coeur d'Alene. One of the Nation's most
beautiful lakes, it is some 24 miles long and 1 to 3 miles wide.
The Spokane River originates here and thence flows west,
while the lake in turn is fed by other rivers and streams,
including Coeur d'Alene River which flows to it from the
east, as does the forested Saint Joe River which begins high
in the Bitterroots and gathers their waters along its 130-mile
journey. To the south of the lake lies the more populated
part of the Coeur d'Alene Reservation. Whether the Coeur
d'Alene Tribe's ownership extends to the banks and submerged lands of the lake and various of these rivers and
streams, or instead ownership is vested in the State of Idaho,
is the underlying dispute. We are limited here, however, to
the important, preliminary question whether the Eleventh
Amendment bars a federal court from hearing the Tribe's
claim.

I

Alleging ownership in the submerged lands and bed of
Lake Coeur d'Alene and of the various navigable rivers
and streams that form part of its water system, the Coeur
d'Alene Tribe, a federally recognized Tribe, together with
various individual Tribe members, sued in federal court.
As there is no relevant distinction between the Tribe and
those of its members who have joined the suit, for purposes
of the issue we decide, we refer to them all as the Tribe.
The Coeur d'Alene Reservation consists of some 13,032 acres
of tribal land, 55,583 acres of allotted land, and 330 Government owned acres. Statistical Record of Native North
Americans 53 (M. Raddy ed. 1995). The Tribe claimed the
beneficial interest, subject to the trusteeship of the United
States, in the beds and banks of all navigable watercourses

Opinion of the Court
and waters (the "submerged lands") within the originalboundaries of the Coeur d'Alene Reservation, as defined by

Executive Order on November 8, 1873. Exec. Order of Nov.8, 1873, reprinted in 1 C. Kappler, Indian Affairs: Laws and
Treaties 837 (1904). The area in dispute includes the banks
and beds and submerged lands of Lake Coeur d'Alene andsome portions of the various rivers and streams we have

described. In the alternative, the Tribe claimed ownershipof the submerged lands pursuant to unextinguished aboriginal title. A state forum was available, see Idaho Code$ 5-328 (1990), but the Tribe brought this action in the
United States District Court for the District of Idaho.

The suit named the State of Idaho, various state agencies,
and numerous state officials in their individual capacities.
In addition to its title claims, the Tribe further sought a declaratory judgment to establish its entitlement to the exclusive use and occupancy and the right to quiet enjoyment of
the submerged lands as well as a declaration of the invalidity
of all Idaho statutes, ordinances, regulations, customs, or

usages which purport to regulate, authorize, use, or affect in
any way the submerged lands. Finally, it sought a preliminary and permanent injunction prohibiting defendants from
regulating, permitting, or taking any action in violation of
the Tribe's rights of exclusive use and occupancy, quiet enjoyment, and other ownership interest in the submerged
lands along with an award for costs and attorney's fees and
such other relief as the court deemed appropriate.

The defendants moved to dismiss the Tribe's complaint on
Eleventh Amendment immunity grounds and for failure to
state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The court
held the Eleventh Amendment barred the claims against
Idaho and the agencies. It concluded further that the action
against the officials for quiet title and declaratory relief was
barred by the Eleventh Amendment because these claims
were the functional equivalents of a damages award against
the State. It dismissed the claim for injunctive relief

Opinion of the Court
against the officials, on the merits, since Idaho was in rightful possession of the submerged lands as a matter of law. It
explained that Idaho acquired ownership of the submerged
lands upon its statehood in 1890 under the equal footing doctrine. The court did not discuss the Tribe's claim to aboriginal title. 798 F. Supp. 1443 (1992).

The Ninth Circuit affirmed in part, reversed in part, and
remanded. 42 F. 3d 1244 (1994). It agreed with the District Court that the Eleventh Amendment barred all claims
against the State and its agencies, as well as the quiet title
action against the officials. The Court of Appeals found the
Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123 (1908), doctrine applicable and
allowed the claims for declaratory and injunctive relief
against the officials to proceed insofar as they sought to preclude continuing violations of federal law. The requested
declaratory and injunctive relief, the Court of Appeals reasoned, is based upon Idaho's ongoing interference with the
Tribe's alleged ownership rights premised on the 1873 Executive Order as later ratified by federal statute. See Act of
Mar. 3, 1891, ch. 543, $ 19, 26 Stat. 1026-1029. It further
found it conceivable that the Tribe could prove facts entitling
it to relief. It reversed the District Court's dismissal of the
declaratory and injunctive relief claims and ordered the case
remanded. It also remanded for consideration of the Tribe's
claim for declaratory relief based on aboriginal title. We
granted certiorari, 517 U. S. 1132 (1996), to consider whether
the suit for declaratory and injunctive relief based on the
Tribe's purported beneficial interest in title may proceed,
and we now reverse in part.

After issuance of the District Court's opinion the United
States filed suit against the State of Idaho on behalf of the
Tribe seeking to quiet title to approximately a third of the
land covered by this suit. United States v. Idaho, No. 94-
0328 (D. Idaho, filed July 21, 1994). The Government's separate suit is still pending and is not implicated here.

Opinion of the Court

II

A

The grant of federal judicial power is cast in terms of itsreach or extent. Article III, $ 2, of the Constitution provides the "judicial Power shall extend" to the cases it enu-merates, including "all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising
under this Constitution [and] the Laws of the United States."The Eleventh Amendment, too, employs the term "extend."
It provides:

"The Judicial power of the United States shall not beconstrued to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United Statesby Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects
of any Foreign State."
This point of commonality could suggest that the EleventhAmendment, like the grant of Article III, $ 2, jurisdiction, is

cast in terms of reach or competence, so the federal courtsare altogether disqualified from hearing certain suits
brought against a State. This interpretation, however, hasbeen neither our tradition nor the accepted construction of
the Amendment's text. Rather, a State can waive its Elev-enth Amendment protection and allow a federal court to hear
and decide a case commenced or prosecuted against it. TheAmendment, in other words, enacts a sovereign immunity
from suit, rather than a nonwaivable limit on the FederalJudiciary's subject-matter jurisdiction. The immunity is
one the States enjoy save where there has been " `a surren-der of this immunity in the plan of the convention.' " Principality of Monaco v. Mississippi, 292 U. S. 313, 322-323(1934) (quoting The Federalist No. 81).

The Court's recognition of sovereign immunity has notbeen limited to the suits described in the text of the Eleventh Amendment. To respect the broader concept of immu-nity, implicit in the Constitution, which we have regarded

Opinion of the Court
the Eleventh Amendment as evidencing and exemplifying,
we have extended a State's protection from suit to suits
brought by the State's own citizens. Hans v. Louisiana, 134
U. S. 1 (1890). Furthermore, the dignity and respect afforded a State, which the immunity is designed to protect,
are placed in jeopardy whether or not the suit is based on
diversity jurisdiction. As a consequence, suits invoking the
federal-question jurisdiction of Article III courts may also
be barred by the Amendment. Seminole Tribe of Fla. v.
Florida, 517 U. S. 44 (1996).

In extended criticisms of the Court's recognition that the
immunity can extend to suits brought by a State's own citizens and to suits premised on federal questions, some of
them as recent as last Term, see id., at 83-93 (Stevens, J.,
dissenting); id., at 109-110 (Souter, J., dissenting), various
dissenting and concurring opinions have urged a change in
direction. See, e. g., Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon,
473 U. S. 234, 247 (1985) (Brennan, J., dissenting). Were we
to abandon our understanding of the Eleventh Amendment
as reflecting a broader principle of sovereign immunity, the
Tribe's suit, which is based on its purported federal property
rights, might proceed. These criticisms and proposed doctrinal revisions, however, have not found acceptance with a
majority of the Court. We adhere to our precedent.

Under well-established principles, the Coeur d'Alene
Tribe, and, a fortiori, its members, are subject to the Eleventh Amendment. In Blatchford v. Native Village of Noatak, 501 U. S. 775, 779-782 (1991), we rejected the contention
that sovereign immunity only restricts suits by individuals
against sovereigns, not by sovereigns against sovereigns.
Since the plan of the Convention did not surrender Indian
tribes' immunity for the benefit of the States, we reasoned
that the States likewise did not surrender their immunity for
the benefit of the tribes. Indian tribes, we therefore concluded, should be accorded the same status as foreign sover521US1 Unit: $U80 [11-18-99 18:46:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
eigns, against whom States enjoy Eleventh Amendment immunity. Id., at 782.

The Tribe's suit, accordingly, is barred by Idaho's Eleventh
Amendment immunity unless it falls within the exception
this Court has recognized for certain suits seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against state officers in their individual capacities. See Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123 (1908).
The Young exception to sovereign immunity was an important part of our jurisprudence when the Court adhered to its
precedents in the face of the criticisms we have mentioned,
and when the Court, overruling Pennsylvania v. Union Gas
Co., 491 U. S. 1 (1989), held that Congress, in the exercise of
its power to regulate commerce with Indian tribes, may not
abrogate state sovereign immunity. Seminole Tribe, supra,
at 71, n. 14. We do not, then, question the continuing validity of the Ex parte Young doctrine. Of course, questions
will arise as to its proper scope and application. In resolving these questions we must ensure that the doctrine of sovereign immunity remains meaningful, while also giving recognition to the need to prevent violations of federal law.

When suit is commenced against state officials, even if
they are named and served as individuals, the State itself
will have a continuing interest in the litigation whenever
state policies or procedures are at stake. This commonsense
observation of the State's real interest when its officers are
named as individuals has not escaped notice or comment
from this Court, either before or after Young. See, e. g., Osborn v. Bank of United States, 9 Wheat. 738, 846-847 (1824)
(stating that the State's interest in the suit was so "direct"
that "perhaps no decree ought to have been pronounced in
the cause, until the State was before the court") (Marshall,
C. J.); Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman,
465 U. S. 89, 114, n. 25 (1984) (noting that Young rests on a
fictional distinction between the official and the State); see
also Florida Dept. of State v. Treasure Salvors, Inc., 458

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
U. S. 670, 685 (1982) (opinion of Stevens, J.) (recognizing theirony that a state official's conduct may be considered " `state

action' " for Fourteenth Amendment purposes yet not forpurposes of the Eleventh Amendment). Indeed, the suit in
Young, which sought to enjoin the state attorney generalfrom enforcing state law, implicated substantial state interests. 209 U. S., at 174 ("[T]he manifest, indeed the avowedand admitted, object of seeking [the requested] relief [is]

totie the hands of the State") (Harlan, J., dissenting). We

agree with these observations.To interpret Young to permit a federal-court action to proceed in every case where prospective declaratory and injunc-tive relief is sought against an officer, named in his individual
capacity, would be to adhere to an empty formalism and toundermine the principle, reaffirmed just last Term in

Semi-nole Tribe, that Eleventh Amendment immunity represents

a real limitation on a federal court's federal-question juris-diction. The real interests served by the Eleventh Amendment are not to be sacrificed to elementary mechanics of cap-tions and pleading. Application of the

Young exceptionmust reflect a proper understanding of its role in our federal

system and respect for state courts instead of a reflexivereliance on an obvious fiction. See, e. g., Pennhurst, supra,
at 102-103, 114, n. 25 (explaining that the limitation in Edel-man v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651 (1974), of Young to prospective
relief represented a refusal to apply the fiction in every con-ceivable circumstance).

B
Putting aside the acts of state officials which are plainlyultra vires under state law itself, see

Pennhurst, supra, at101-102, n. 11, there are, in general, two instances where

Young has been applied. The first is where there is no stateforum available to vindicate federal interests, thereby placing upon Article III courts the special obligation to ensurethe supremacy of federal statutory and constitutional law.
This is a most important application of the Ex parte Young

521US1 Unit: $U80 [11-18-99 18:46:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN

271Cite as: 521 U. S. 261 (1997)
Opinion of Kennedy, J.
doctrine and is exemplified by the facts in Young itself. See209 U. S., at 146 ("The necessary effect and result of [the

challenged] legislation must be to preclude a resort to thecourts (either state or Federal) for the purpose of testing
its validity").

As is well known, the ultimate question in Young waswhether the State's attorney general could enforce a state

ratesetting scheme said by the objecting shareholders of rail-road companies to be unconstitutional. The shareholders
sought a federal injunction against Attorney General Young,prohibiting enforcement of the rate scheme. Attempting to
show the lack of necessity for federal intervention, Young
maintained the shareholders could wait until a state enforcement proceeding was brought against the railroads and then
test the law's validity by raising constitutional defenses.
The Court rejected the argument, first because a single violation might not bring a prompt prosecution; and second because the penalties for violations were so severe a railroad
official could not test the law without grave risk of heavy
fines and imprisonment. The Court added that a federal
suit for injunctive relief would be "undoubtedly the most
convenient, the most comprehensive and the most orderly
way in which the rights of all parties can be properly, fairly
and adequately passed upon." Id., at 166.

Where there is no available state forum the Young rule
has special significance. In that instance providing a federal
forum for a justiciable controversy is a specific application of
the principle that the plan of the Convention contemplates a
regime in which federal guarantees are enforceable so long
as there is a justiciable controversy. The Federalist No. 80,
p. 475 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton) ("[T]here ought
always to be a constitutional method of giving efficacy to
constitutional provisions"). We, of course, express no opinion as to the circumstances in which the unavailability of
injunctive relief in state court would raise constitutional concerns under current doctrine.

272 IDAHO v. COEUR d'ALENE TRIBE OF IDAHO

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
Young was not an isolated example of an instance where a
state forum was unavailable. See, e. g., Osborn, supra, at
842-843 (explaining that if it was within the power of the
plaintiff to make the State a party to the suit it would "certainly [be] true" that a suit against state officials would be
barred, but if the "real principal" is "exempt from all judicial
process" an officer suit could proceed); United States v. Lee,
106 U. S. 196 (1882) (permitting suit for injunctive relief to
proceed where there did not otherwise exist a legal remedy
for the alleged trespass); Poindexter v. Greenhow, 114 U. S.
270, 299 (1885) (explaining that the state-law remedy for Virginia's unconstitutional refusal to accept its own bond coupons in satisfaction of state taxes was, in fact, "no remedy").
In these early cases, the Court, although expressing concern
over the lack of a forum, did not rely on the lack of a forum
as its doctrinal basis. After abandonment of Osborn's rule
that a suit was not against the State so long as the State was
not a party of record, see Governor of Georgia v. Madrazo,
1 Pet. 110, 124 (1828), the Young fiction was employed where
"the act complained of, considered apart from the official authority alleged as its justification, and as the personal act of
the individual defendant, constituted a violation of right for
which the plaintiff was entitled to a remedy at law or in
equity against the wrongdoer in his individual character."
In re Ayers, 123 U. S. 443, 502 (1887). In other words,
where the individual would have been liable at common law
for his actions, sovereign immunity was no bar regardless of
the person's official position. See, e. g., Lee, supra, at 221
(common-law tort of trespass); Belknap v. Schild, 161 U. S.
10, 18 (1896) (common-law tort of patent infringement);
Tindal v. Wesley, 167 U. S. 204, 221-222 (1897) (common-law
tort of trespass); Scully v. Bird, 209 U. S. 481, 483 (1908)
(common-law tort of injuring plaintiff 's reputation and sale
of certain products). Under this line of reasoning, a state
official who committed a common-law tort was said to have

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
been "stripped" of his official or representative character.See

Young, supra, at 159-160; Poindexter, supra, at 288.
With the growth of statutory and complex regulatoryschemes, this mode of analysis might have been somewhat

obscured. Part of the significance of Young, in this respect,
lies in its treatment of a threatened suit by an official toenforce an unconstitutional state law as if it were a commonlaw tort. See 209 U. S., at 158 (treating this possibility asa "specific wrong or trespass");

id., at 167 ("The difference
between an actual and direct interference with tangibleproperty and the enjoining of state officers from enforcing

an unconstitutional act, is not of a radical nature"). Treatment of a threatened suit to enforce an unconstitutional statute as a tort found support in Reagan v. Farmers' Loan &
Trust Co., 154 U. S. 362 (1894), and Smyth v. Ames, 169 U. S.
466 (1898). See Currie, Sovereign Immunity and Suits
Against Government Officers, 1984 S. Ct. Rev. 149, 154, and
n. 35. By employing the common-law injury framework, the
Young Court underscored the inadequacy of state procedures for vindicating the constitutional rights at stake. 209
U. S., at 163-166. The enforcement scheme in Young, which
raised obstacles to the vindication of constitutional claims,
was not unusual. See, e. g., Willcox v. Consolidated Gas Co.,
212 U. S. 19, 53-54 (1909) (discussing the "enormous and
overwhelming" penalties for violating the challenged statutes); Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Andrews, 216 U. S. 165
(1910) (penalties for each violation of the challenged statute
included $1,000 fine); Herndon v. Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co.,
218 U. S. 135, 151 (1910) (penalties for violating the challenged statute could "in a short time . . . amount to many
thousands of dollars"); Oklahoma Operating Co. v. Love, 252
U. S. 331, 336 (1920) (penalties for violations are "such as
might well deter even the boldest and most confident"). In
many situations, as in the above-cited cases, the exercise of a
federal court's equitable jurisdiction was necessary to avoid
"excessive and oppressive penalties, [the] possibility of [a]

multiplicity of suits causing irreparable damage, or [the] lackof proper opportunities for [state] review." Warren, Federal

and State Court Interference, 43 Harv. L. Rev. 345, 377-378(1930).

The reluctance to place much reliance on the availabilityof a state forum can be understood in part by the prevalence
of the idea that if a State consented to suit in a state forumit had consented, by that same act, to suit in a federal forum.
See, e. g., Davis v. Gray, 16 Wall. 203, 221 (1873); Reagan v.
Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., supra, at 391. Today, by con-trast, it is acknowledged that States have real and vital interests in preferring their own forums in suits broughtagainst them, interests that ought not to be disregarded
based upon a waiver presumed in law and contrary to fact.See,

e. g., Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S., at 673. In this case,there is neither warrant nor necessity to adopt the Young

device to provide an adequate judicial forum for resolvingthe dispute between the Tribe and the State. Idaho's courts
are open to hear the case, and the State neither has norclaims immunity from their process or their binding

judgment. C

Even if there is a prompt and effective remedy in a stateforum, a second instance in which

Young may serve an im-portant interest is when the case calls for the interpretation

of federal law. This reasoning, which is described as theinterest in having federal rights vindicated in federal courts,
can lead to expansive application of the Young exception.See, e. g., Green v. Mansour, 474 U. S. 64, 68 (1985) (explaining that Young furthers the federal interest in vindicatingfederal law);

Pennhurst, 465 U. S., at 105 ("[T]he Young doc-trine has been accepted as necessary to permit the federal

courts to vindicate federal rights" (citation omitted)). It isdifficult to say States consented to these types of suits in the
plan of the Convention. Neither in theory nor in practicehas it been shown problematic to have federal claims re521US1 Unit: $U80 [11-18-99 18:46:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
solved in state courts where Eleventh Amendment immunitywould be applicable in federal court but for an exception

based on Young. For purposes of the Supremacy Clause, itis simply irrelevant whether the claim is brought in state or
federal court. Federal courts, after all, did not have general
federal-question jurisdiction until 1875. Assuming theavailability of a state forum with the authority and procedures adequate for the effective vindication of federal law,due process concerns would not be implicated by having
state tribunals resolve federal-question cases.In some cases, it is true, the federal courts play an indispensable role in maintaining the structural integrity of the
constitutional design. A federal forum assures the peaceful
resolution of disputes between the States, South Dakota v.
North Carolina, 192 U. S. 286 (1904), and suits initiated by
the United States against States, United States v. Texas, 143
U. S. 621 (1892). While we can assume there is a special role
for Article III courts in the interpretation and application of
federal law in other instances as well, we do not for that
reason conclude that state courts are a less than adequate
forum for resolving federal questions. A doctrine based on
the inherent inadequacy of state forums would run counter
to basic principles of federalism. In Stone v. Powell, 428
U. S. 465 (1976), we expressed our "emphatic reaffirmation
. . . of the constitutional obligation of the state courts to
uphold federal law, and [our] expression of confidence in
their ability to do so." Allen v. McCurry, 449 U. S. 90, 105
(1980).

Interpretation of federal law is the proprietary concern of
state, as well as federal, courts. It is the right and duty of
the States, within their own judiciaries, to interpret and to
follow the Constitution and all laws enacted pursuant to it,
subject to a litigant's right of review in this Court in a proper
case. The Constitution and laws of the United States are
not a body of law external to the States, acknowledged and
enforced simply as a matter of comity. The Constitution is

276 IDAHO v. COEUR d'ALENE TRIBE OF IDAHO

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
the basic law of the Nation, a law to which a State's ties areno less intimate than those of the National Government itself. The separate States and the Government of the UnitedStates are bound in the common cause of preserving the
whole constitutional order. Federal and state law "together
form one system of jurisprudence." Claflin v. Houseman,93 U. S. 130, 137 (1876). It would be error coupled with

irony were we to bypass the Eleventh Amendment, whichenacts a scheme solicitous of the States, on the sole rationale
that state courts are inadequate to enforce and interpret fed-eral rights in every case.

It is a principal concern of the court system in any State
to define and maintain a proper balance between the State's
courts on one hand, and its officials and administrative agencies on the other. This is of vital concern to States. As the
Idaho State Attorney General has explained: "Everywhere a
citizen turns--to apply for a life-sustaining public benefit, to
obtain a license, to respond to a complaint--it is [administrative law] that governs the way in which their contact with
state government will be carried out." EchoHawk, Introduction to Administrative Procedure Act Issue, 30 Idaho L.
Rev. 261 (1994). In the States there is an ongoing process
by which state courts and state agencies work to elaborate
an administrative law designed to reflect the State's own
rules and traditions concerning the respective scope of judicial review and administrative discretion. An important
case such as the instant one has features which instruct and
enrich the elaboration of administrative law that is one of
the primary responsibilities of the state judiciary. Where,
as here, the parties invoke federal principles to challenge
state administrative action, the courts of the State have a
strong interest in integrating those sources of law within
their own system for the proper judicial control of state
officials.

Our precedents do teach us, nevertheless, that where prospective relief is sought against individual state officers in a

521US1 Unit: $U80 [11-18-99 18:46:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN

277Cite as: 521 U. S. 261 (1997)
Opinion of Kennedy, J.
federal forum based on a federal right, the Eleventh Amend-ment, in most cases, is not a bar. See,

e. g., Willcox, 212
U. S., at 40. Indeed, since Edelman we have consistentlyallowed suits seeking prospective injunctive relief based on

federal violations to proceed. Last Term, however, we did
not allow a suit raising a federal question to proceed basedon Congress' provision of an alternative review mechanism.

Whether the presumption in favor of federal-court jurisdic-tion in this type of case is controlling will depend upon the
particular context. What is really at stake where a stateforum is available is the desire of the litigant to choose a
particular forum versus the desire of the State to have the
dispute resolved in its own courts. The Eleventh Amendment's background principles of federalism and comity need
not be ignored in resolving these conflicting preferences.
The Young exception may not be applicable if the suit would
"upset the balance of federal and state interests that it embodies." Papasan v. Allain, 478 U. S. 265, 277 (1986). The
exception has been "tailored to conform as precisely as possible to those specific situations in which it is necessary to
permit the federal courts to vindicate federal rights." Ibid.
(citation and internal quotation marks omitted); see also
Pennhurst, 465 U. S., at 104, n. 13.

The course of our case law indicates the wisdom and necessity of considering, when determining the applicability
of the Eleventh Amendment, the real affront to a State of
allowing a suit to proceed. As we explained in Ford Motor
Co. v. Department of Treasury of Ind., 323 U. S. 459 (1945):
"[T]he nature of a suit as one against the state is to be determined by the essential nature and effect of the proceeding." Id., at 464. We held that "when the action is in essence one for the recovery of money from the state, the state
is the real, substantial party in interest and is entitled to
invoke its sovereign immunity from suit even though individual officials are nominal defendants." Ibid. In re Ayers,
cited with approval in Young, stated that it is not "conclu521US1 Unit: $U80 [11-18-99 18:46:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
sive of the principal question in this case, that the [State]is not named as a party defendant. Whether it is the actual party, in the sense of the prohibition of the Constitu-tion, must be determined by a consideration of the nature
of the case as presented on the whole record." 123 U. S.,at 492. See also

Ex parte New York, 256 U. S. 490, 500(1921) (Young 's applicability "is to be determined not by the

mere names of the titular parties but by the essential na-ture and effect of the proceeding, as it appears from the entire record"). Of course, the State's interests are almostalways implicated to a certain extent in Young actions,
but the statements we cite reflect the Court's recognition"that the need to promote the supremacy of federal law
must be accommodated to the constitutional immunity of theStates."

Pennhurst, supra, at 105.

D
Our recent cases illustrate a careful balancing and accom-modation of state interests when determining whether the

Young exception applies in a given case. In Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651 (1974), the relief granted by the FederalDistrict Court required state officials to release and remit

federal benefits. While the District Court's order mighthave served the goal of deterrence as well as compensation,
we concluded the suit was barred by the Eleventh Amend-ment because it was not necessary for the vindication of federal rights. In reaching this conclusion, we explained that"we must judge the award actually made in this case, and
not one which might have been differently tailored in adifferent case."

Id., at 665. There was no need for the
Edelman Court to consider the other relief granted by theDistrict Court, prospectively enjoining state officials from

failing to abide by federal requirements, since it was con-ceded that Young was sufficient for this purpose. 415 U. S.,
at 664. The second time the Edelman litigation came beforethe Court, in Quern v. Jordan, 440 U. S. 332 (1979), we made

521US1 Unit: $U80 [11-18-99 18:46:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN

279Cite as: 521 U. S. 261 (1997)
Opinion of Kennedy, J.
a point of saying the relief sought pursuant to the Youngaction was a notice "simply inform[ing] class members that

their federal suit is at an end, that the federal court canprovide them with no further relief, and that there are existing state administrative procedures . . . . Petitioner raises
no objection to the expense of preparing or sending it. Theclass members are given no more . . . than what they would

have gathered by sitting in the courtroom." 440 U. S., at349 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).

Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U. S. 267 (1977), is consistent withthis approach. Although authorizing relief having an undeniably substantial effect on the State, Milliken does not obviate the need for careful consideration of a suit's impact.
Milliken concerned a Young suit against various Michigan
officials resulting in a District Court order requiring the
State, along with the Detroit School Board, to pay for a comprehensive education program for schoolchildren who had
been subjected to past acts of de jure segregation. The gravamen of the complaint and its ultimate purpose was to vindicate the plaintiffs' civil liberties, not to establish ownership
over state resources or funds. The Milliken lawsuit and the
resulting order were a direct result of the State's "official
acts of racial discrimination committed by both the Detroit
School Board and the State of Michigan" in violation of the
Fourteenth Amendment. 433 U. S., at 269. If Congress
pursuant to its $ 5 remedial powers under the Fourteenth
Amendment may abrogate sovereign immunity, even if the
resulting legislation goes beyond what is constitutionally
necessary, see, e. g., Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U. S. 445 (1976)
(concluding that Title VII's authorization of federal-court jurisdiction to award money damages against a state government to individuals subjected to employment discrimination
does not violate the Eleventh Amendment since Congress
was exercising its $ 5 remedial powers), it follows that the
substantive provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment themselves offer a powerful reason to provide a federal forum.

280 IDAHO v. COEUR d'ALENE TRIBE OF IDAHO

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
The Milliken Court, for similar reasons, rejected a TenthAmendment challenge to the order. 433 U. S., at 291. In

short, "[t]he theme that thus emerges from [our recent
Young cases] . . . is one of balancing of state and federal
interests." Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., 491 U. S., at 27
(Stevens, J., concurring).This case-by-case approach to the

Young doctrine has been
evident from the start. Before Larson v. Domestic and
Foreign Commerce Corp., 337 U. S. 682 (1949) (a federal sovereign immunity case), we allowed suits to proceed, as ex-plained above, if the official committed a tort as defined by

the common law. While Larson rejected this reliance on
the common law of torts, see id., at 692-695, the importance
of case-by-case analysis was recognized again in Seminole
Tribe. There, in holding the Young exception inapplicable
to a suit based on federal law, we relied on Schweiker v.
Chilicky, 487 U. S. 412 (1988). Chilicky, in turn, addressed
whether a Bivens type of action, a right of action stemming
from the Constitution itself, see Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed.
Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388 (1971), applied in a suit alleging due process violations in the denial of Social Security
disability benefits. A Bivens action was unavailable, the
Chilicky Court held, given the particular circumstances
present in the case. Seminole Tribe's implicit analogy of
Young to Bivens is instructive. Both the Young and Bivens
lines of cases reflect a sensitivity to varying contexts, and
courts should consider whether there are "special factors
counselling hesitation," 403 U. S., at 396, before allowing a
suit to proceed under either theory. The range of concerns
to be considered in answering this inquiry is broad. See id.,
at 407 (Harlan, J., concurring).

As no one disputes, the Young fiction is an exercise in
line-drawing. There is no reason why the line cannot be
drawn to reflect the real interests of States consistent with
the clarity and certainty appropriate to the Eleventh
Amendment's jurisdictional inquiry.

Opinion of the Court

III
We now turn to consider whether the Tribe may avoid theEleventh Amendment bar and avail itself of the

Young ex-ception. Although the "difference between the type of relief

barred by the Eleventh Amendment and that permittedunder Ex parte Young will not in many instances be that
between day and night," Edelman, 415 U. S., at 667, this suit,we decide, falls on the Eleventh Amendment side of the line,
and Idaho's sovereign immunity controls.The Tribe has alleged an ongoing violation of its property
rights in contravention of federal law and seeks prospectiveinjunctive relief. The Tribe argues that it should therefore
be able to avail itself of the Ex parte Young fiction. More-over, the Tribe points to the plurality decision in

FloridaDept. of State v. Treasure Salvors, Inc., 458 U. S. 670 (1982)

(opinion of Stevens, J.), where we allowed a Federal Dis-trict Court to issue a warrant commanding state officials to
turn over various artifacts (mainly treasure from a sunkenSpanish galleon) to the United States Marshal despite the
State's claim of sovereign immunity.An allegation of an ongoing violation of federal law where
the requested relief is prospective is ordinarily sufficient toinvoke the

Young fiction. However, this case is unusual inthat the Tribe's suit is the functional equivalent of a quiet

title action which implicates special sovereignty interests.We do not think

Treasure Salvors, supra, is helpful to theTribe because the state officials there were acting beyond

the authority conferred upon them by the State, id., at 696-697, a theory the Tribe does not even attempt to pursue in

the case before us. We must examine the effect of theTribe's suit and its impact on these special sovereignty interests in order to decide whether the Ex parte Young fictionis applicable.

It is common ground between the parties, at this stage ofthe litigation, that the Tribe could not maintain a quiet title
suit against Idaho in federal court, absent the State's con521US1 Unit: $U80 [11-18-99 18:46:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
sent. The Eleventh Amendment would bar it. Tindal, 167
U. S., at 223. Despite this prohibition, the declaratory and
injunctive relief the Tribe seeks is close to the functional
equivalent of quiet title in that substantially all benefits of
ownership and control would shift from the State to the
Tribe. This is especially troubling when coupled with the
far-reaching and invasive relief the Tribe seeks, relief with
consequences going well beyond the typical stakes in a real
property quiet title action. The suit seeks, in effect, a determination that the lands in question are not even within the
regulatory jurisdiction of the State. The requested injunctive relief would bar the State's principal officers from exercising their governmental powers and authority over the disputed lands and waters. The suit would diminish, even
extinguish, the State's control over a vast reach of lands and
waters long deemed by the State to be an integral part of
its territory. To pass this off as a judgment causing little or
no offense to Idaho's sovereign authority and its standing in
the Union would be to ignore the realities of the relief the
Tribe demands.

Any contention that the State is not implicated by the suit
in a manner having an immediate effect on jurisdictional control over important public lands is belied by the complaint
itself. The state officials who are the named defendants, all
members of the Board of Land Commissioners save Director
Higginson, include: Governor Cecil Andrus, who is Chairman
of the Board and trustee of a public water right in Lake
Coeur d'Alene pursuant to Idaho Code $ 67-4304 (1989); Pete
Cenarrusa, Secretary of State; Larry EchoHawk, Attorney
General; Jerry Evans, Superintendent of Public Instruction;
J. D. Williams, Auditor; and Keith Higginson, Director of the
Department of Water Resources. The power to regulate
and control the use and disposition of public lands, including
the beds of navigable lakes, rivers, and streams, is vested in
the Board of Land Commissioners. Idaho Const., Art. IX,

Opinion of the Court

$ 7 (Supp. 1996); Idaho Code $$ 58-101, 58-104(9) (1994 and
Supp. 1996).

Not only would the relief block all attempts by these officials to exercise jurisdiction over a substantial portion of
land but also would divest the State of its sovereign control
over submerged lands, lands with a unique status in the law
and infused with a public trust the State itself is bound to
respect. As we stressed in Utah Div. of State Lands v.
United States, 482 U. S. 193, 195-198 (1987), lands underlying
navigable waters have historically been considered "sovereign lands." State ownership of them has been "considered
an essential attribute of sovereignty." Id., at 195. The
Court from an early date has acknowledged that the people
of each of the Thirteen Colonies at the time of independence
"became themselves sovereign; and in that character hold
the absolute right to all their navigable waters and the soils
under them for their own common use, subject only to the
rights since surrendered by the Constitution to the general
government." Martin v. Lessee of Waddell, 16 Pet. 367, 410
(1842). Then, in Lessee of Pollard v. Hagan, 3 How. 212
(1845), the Court concluded that States entering the Union
after 1789 did so on an "equal footing" with the original
States and so have similar ownership over these "sovereign
lands." Id., at 228-229. In consequence of this rule, a
State's title to these sovereign lands arises from the equal
footing doctrine and is "conferred not by Congress but by
the Constitution itself." Oregon ex rel. State Land Bd. v.
Corvallis Sand & Gravel Co., 429 U. S. 363, 374 (1977). The
importance of these lands to state sovereignty explains our
longstanding commitment to the principle that the United
States is presumed to have held navigable waters in acquired
territory for the ultimate benefit of future States and "that
disposals by the United States during the territorial period
are not lightly to be inferred, and should not be regarded as
intended unless the intention was definitely declared or

Opinion of the Court
otherwise made very plain." United States v. Holt State
Bank, 270 U. S. 49, 55 (1926).

The principle which underlies the equal footing doctrineand the strong presumption of state ownership is that navigable waters uniquely implicate sovereign interests. The
principle arises from ancient doctrines. See, e. g., Institutesof Justinian, Lib. II, Tit. I, $ 2 (T. Cooper transl. 2d ed. 1841)

("Rivers and ports are public; hence the right of fishing in aport, or in rivers are in common"). The special treatment
of navigable waters in English law was recognized in Brac-ton's time. He stated that "[a]ll rivers and ports are public,
so that the right to fish therein is common to all persons.The use of river banks, as of the river itself, is also public."
2 H. Bracton, De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliae 40 (S.
Thorne transl. 1968). The Magna Carta provided that theCrown would remove "all fish-weirs . . . from the Thames

and the Medway and throughout all England, except on thesea coast." M. Evans & R. Jack, Sources of English Legal
and Constitutional History 53 (1984); see also Waddell,
supra, at 410-413 (tracing tidelands trusteeship back to
Magna Carta).The Court in

Shively v. Bowlby, 152 U. S. 1, 13 (1894), summarizing English common law, stated:

"In England, from the time of Lord Hale, it has been
treated as settled that the title in the soil of the sea, orof arms of the sea, below ordinary high water mark, is

in the King; except so far as an individual or a corporation has acquired rights in it by express grant, or byprescription or usage . . . and that this title,

jus privatum, whether in the King or in a subject, is held subject
to the public right, jus publicum, of navigation and
fishing."

Not surprisingly, American law adopted as its own much of
the English law respecting navigable waters, including the
principle that submerged lands are held for a public purpose.

Opinion of the Court
See Arnold v. Mundy, 6 N. J. L. 1 (1821). A prominentexample is

Illinois Central R. Co. v. Illinois, 146 U. S. 387
(1892), where the Court held that the Illinois Legislature didnot have the authority to vest the State's right and title to

a portion of the navigable waters of Lake Michigan in a private party even though a proviso in the grant declared thatit did not authorize obstructions to the harbor, impairment

of the public right of navigation, or exemption of the privateparty from any act regulating rates of wharfage and dockage
to be charged in the harbor. An attempted transfer wasbeyond the authority of the legislature since it amounted to
abdication of its obligation to regulate, improve, and secure
submerged lands for the benefit of every individual. Id., at
455-460. While Illinois Central was "necessarily a statement of Illinois law," Appleby v. City of New York, 271 U. S.
364, 395 (1926), it invoked the principle in American law recognizing the weighty public interests in submerged lands.

American law, in some ways, enhanced and extended the
public aspects of submerged lands. English law made a distinction between waterways subject to the ebb and flow of
the tide and large enough to accommodate boats (royal rivers) and nontidal waterways (public highways). With respect to the royal rivers, the King was presumed to hold title
to the riverbed and soil while the public retained the right
of passage and the right to fish. With public highways, as
the name suggests, the public retained the right of passage,
but title was typically held by a private party. See J.
Angell, A Treatise on The Common Law in relation to
Water-Courses 14-18 (1824). The riparian proprietor was
presumed to hold title to the stream to the center thread of
the waters (usque ad filum aquae), which accorded him the
exclusive right of fishery in the stream and entitled him to
compensation for any impairment of his right to the enjoyment of his property caused by construction. The State's
obligation to pay compensation could result in substantial
liability. Shrunk v. Schuylkill, 14 Serg. & Rawle 71, 80 (Pa.

Opinion of the Court
1826). State courts, however, early on in Pennsylvania,South Carolina, Alabama, and North Carolina rejected the

distinction and concluded the State presumptively held titleregardless of whether the waterway was subject to the ebb
and flow of the tide. See, e. g., Carson v. Blazer, 2 Binn. 475
(Pa. 1810); Cates v. Wadlington, 1 McCord 580 (S. C. 1822);
Bullock v. Wilson, 2 Port. 436 (Ala. 1835); Collins v. Benbury, 3 Iredell 277 (N. C. 1842); but see Hooker v. Cummings,20 Johns. 90 (N. Y. 1822). And this Court in describing the

concept of sovereign lands rejected the requirement thatnavigable waters need be affected by the tides.

Barney v.
Keokuk, 94 U. S. 324, 337-338 (1877); cf. Propeller Genesee
Chief v. Fitzhugh, 12 How. 443 (1852).

American law, moreover, did not recognize the sovereign's
rights of private property (jus privatum) that existed in
England, apart from the public's rights to this land (jus publicum). In England, for instance, the Crown had the exclusive right to hunt the "grand fishes," e. g., whales and sturgeons, of the sea. J. Angell, A Treatise on the Right of
Property in Tide Waters and in the Soil and Shores Thereof
18-19 (1847). There was a particular aversion to recognizing in States the Crown's jus privatum right to seize private
structures on shores and marshes reclaimed from tidewaters.
See J. Gould, A Treatise on the Law of Waters including
Riparian Rights, and Public And Private Rights In Waters
Tidal And Inland $ 32 (2d ed. 1891). All these developments
in American law are a natural outgrowth of the perceived
public character of submerged lands, a perception which underlies and informs the principle that these lands are tied in
a unique way to sovereignty.

Idaho views its interest in the submerged lands in similar
terms. Idaho law provides: "Water being essential to the
industrial prosperity of the state, and all agricultural development . . . its control shall be in the state, which, in providing for its use, shall equally guard all the various interests
involved. All the waters of the state, when flowing in their

Opinion of the Court
natural channels . . . are declared to be the property of thestate." Idaho Code $ 42-101 (1990). Title to these public

waters is held by the State of Idaho in its sovereign capacityfor the purpose of ensuring that it is used for the public benefit. Poole v. Olaveson, 82 Idaho 496, 503, 356 P. 2d 61, 65
(1960). There are specific statutory provisions concerningLake Coeur d'Alene. The Lake is held in trust by the Governor for the people of the State of Idaho. The "preser-vation of [Lake Coeur d'Alene] for scenic beauty, health, recreation, transportation and commercial purposes [being]necessary and desirable for all the inhabitants of the state is
hereby declared to be a beneficial use of such water." Idaho
Code $ 67-4304 (1989). The "lands belonging to the state of
Idaho between the ordinary high and low water mark at
[Lake Coeur d'Alene] . . . are hereby declared to be devoted
to a public use in connection with the preservation of said
lak[e] in [its] present condition as a health resort and recreation place for the inhabitants of the state." Idaho Code

$ 67-4305 (Supp. 1996).

Our recitation of the ties between the submerged lands
and the State's own sovereignty, and of the severance and
diminishment of state sovereignty were the declaratory and
injunctive relief to be granted, is not in derogation of the
Tribe's own claim. As the Tribe views the case, the lands
are just as necessary, perhaps even more so, to its own dignity and ancient right. The question before us is not the
merit of either party's claim, however, but the relation between the sovereign lands at issue and the immunity the
State asserts.

It is apparent, then, that if the Tribe were to prevail, Idaho's sovereign interest in its lands and waters would be
affected in a degree fully as intrusive as almost any conceivable retroactive levy upon funds in its Treasury. Under
these particular and special circumstances, we find the
Young exception inapplicable. The dignity and status of its
statehood allow Idaho to rely on its Eleventh Amendment

immunity and to insist upon responding to these claims in its
own courts, which are open to hear and determine the case.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed in part,
and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with
this opinion. It is so ordered.

Justice O'Connor, with whom Justice Scalia and
Justice Thomas join, concurring in part and concurring in
the judgment.

The Coeur d'Alene Tribe of Idaho seeks declaratory and
injunctive relief precluding Idaho officials from regulating or
interfering with its possession of submerged lands beneath
Lake Coeur d'Alene. Invoking the doctrine of Ex parte
Young, 209 U. S. 123 (1908), the Tribe argues that the Eleventh Amendment does not bar it from pursuing its claims
against state officials in federal court. I agree with the
Court that the Tribe's claim cannot go forward in federal
court.

In Young, the Court held that a federal court has jurisdiction over a suit against a state officer to enjoin official actions
that violate federal law, even if the State itself is immune
from suit under the Eleventh Amendment. The Young doctrine recognizes that if a state official violates federal law,
he is stripped of his official or representative character and
may be personally liable for his conduct; the State cannot
cloak the officer in its sovereign immunity. Id., at 159-160.
Where a plaintiff seeks prospective relief to end a state
officer's ongoing violation of federal law, such a claim can
ordinarily proceed in federal court. Milliken v. Bradley,
433 U. S. 267, 289-290 (1977). The doctrine is not, however,
without limitations. A federal court cannot award retrospective relief, designed to remedy past violations of federal law. See Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651, 668 (1974);
Green v. Mansour, 474 U. S. 64, 68-69 (1985).

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
This case is unlike a typical Young action in two importantrespects. First, as the Tribe concedes, the suit is the functional equivalent of an action to quiet its title to the bed ofLake Coeur d'Alene. It asks a federal court to declare that
the lands are for the exclusive use, occupancy, and enjoyment
of the Tribe and to invalidate all statutes and ordinancespurporting to regulate the lands. The Tribe could not maintain a quiet title action in federal court without the State'sconsent, and for good reason: A federal court cannot summon
a State before it in a private action seeking to divest theState of a property interest.

Florida Dept. of State v.
Treasure Salvors, Inc., 458 U. S. 670, 699-700 (1982) (plurality opinion); see Ford Motor Co. v. Department of Treasury
of Ind., 323 U. S. 459, 464 (1945). Second, the Tribe does not
merely seek to possess land that would otherwise remain
subject to state regulation, or to bring the State's regulatory
scheme into compliance with federal law. Rather, the Tribe
seeks to eliminate altogether the State's regulatory power
over the submerged lands at issue--to establish not only that
the State has no right to possess the property, but also that
the property is not within Idaho's sovereign jurisdiction at
all. We have repeatedly emphasized the importance of submerged lands to state sovereignty. Control of such lands is
critical to a State's ability to regulate use of its navigable
waters. Utah Div. of State Lands v. United States, 482
U. S. 193, 195 (1987).

The Tribe's claim to federal jurisdiction rests heavily on
cases that, in my view, do not control here. The first is
Treasure Salvors, in which a plurality concluded that a federal court could issue a warrant commanding Florida officials
to release certain artifacts because the suit was not, in effect,
a suit against the State. But the fact that the suit was permitted to proceed in Treasure Salvors does not advance our
inquiry. The plurality's conclusion that the suit was not
against the State was based on its view that state officials
lacked any colorable basis under state law for claiming right521US1 Unit: $U80 [11-18-99 18:46:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN
290 IDAHO v. COEUR d'ALENE TRIBE OF IDAHO

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
ful possession of the artifacts. 458 U. S., at 692-697. Putanother way, the plurality in

Treasure Salvors would have
permitted the suit to proceed not because the plaintiff 's claimof title arguably rested on federal law, see

post, at 311
(Souter, J., dissenting), but because state officials were acting beyond the authority conferred on them by the State,quite apart from whether their conduct also violated federal

law. Because the Tribe does not pursue such a theory,
Treasure Salvors provides little guidance here. In addition,
whether or not the Court's ultimate holding in Treasure Salvors that the suit should proceed remains sound on the theory that the plaintiff identified a federal law basis for its
claim of title, see post, at 307, n. 9 (Souter, J., dissenting),
the only reasoning explicitly offered by the Treasure Salvors plurality was narrowed by our subsequent decision in
Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465
U. S. 89, 106 (1984) (plaintiff cannot invoke Young doctrine
based solely on alleged violation of state law); see 465 U. S.,
at 114, n. 25.

Second, the Tribe invokes a series of cases in which plaintiffs successfully pursued in federal court claims that federal
and state officials wrongfully possessed certain real property. See, e. g., United States v. Lee, 106 U. S. 196 (1882);
Tindal v. Wesley, 167 U. S. 204 (1897). In both Lee and Tindal, the Court made clear that the suits could proceed
against the officials because no judgment would bind the
State. It was possible, the Court found, to distinguish between possession of the property and title to the property.
See Lee, supra, at 222; Tindal, supra, at 223-224. A court
could find that the officials had no right to remain in possession, thus conveying all the incidents of ownership to the
plaintiff, while not formally divesting the State of its title.
As noted, however, this case does not concern ownership and
possession of an ordinary parcel of real property. When
state officials are found to have no right to possess a disputed
parcel of land, the State nevertheless retains its authority to

521US1 Unit: $U80 [11-18-99 18:46:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN

291Cite as: 521 U. S. 261 (1997)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
regulate uses of the land. Here, the Tribe seeks a declara-tion not only that the State does not own the bed of Lake

Coeur d'Alene, but also that the lands are not within theState's sovereign jurisdiction. Whatever distinction can be
drawn between possession and ownership of real property in
other contexts, it is not possible to make such a distinctionfor submerged lands. For this reason,

Lee, Tindal, and
analogous cases do not control here. In my view, becausea ruling in the Tribe's favor, in practical effect, would be

indistinguishable from an order granting the Tribe title tosubmerged lands, the

Young exception to the Eleventh
Amendment's bar is not properly invoked here.

While I therefore agree that the Tribe's suit must be dismissed, I believe that the principal opinion is flawed in several respects. In concluding that the Tribe's suit cannot
proceed, the principal opinion reasons that federal courts determining whether to exercise jurisdiction over any suit
against a state officer must engage in a case-specific analysis
of a number of concerns, including whether a state forum is
available to hear the dispute, what particular federal right
the suit implicates, and whether "special factors counse[l]
hesitation" in the exercise of jurisdiction. Ante, at 274, 275,
278-280 (internal quotation marks omitted). This approach
unnecessarily recharacterizes and narrows much of our
Young jurisprudence. The parties have not briefed whether
such a shift in the Young doctrine is warranted. In my
view, it is not.

The principal opinion begins by examining this Court's
early Young cases and concludes that the Court found the
exercise of federal jurisdiction proper in those cases principally because no state forum was available to vindicate a
plaintiff 's claim that state officers were violating federal law.
Ante, at 270-274. But the principal opinion cites not a single case in which the Court expressly relied on the absence of an available state forum as a rationale for applying
Young. Instead, the principal opinion invokes language in

521US1 Unit: $U80 [11-18-99 18:46:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN
292 IDAHO v. COEUR d'ALENE TRIBE OF IDAHO

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
the Court's opinions suggesting that the plaintiff could not
secure an adequate remedy at law in a state forum. See
Young, 209 U. S., at 163; Osborn v. Bank of United States, 9
Wheat. 738, 838-846 (1824); Lee, supra, at 213, 219. But the
inadequacy of a legal remedy is a prerequisite for equitable
relief in any case. That we pronounced state legal remedies
inadequate before permitting the suit to proceed is unsurprising, and it is not a sufficient basis for the principal opinion's broad conclusion.

Not only do our early Young cases fail to rely on the absence of a state forum as a basis for jurisdiction, but we
also permitted federal actions to proceed even though a state
forum was open to hear the plaintiff 's claims. In fact,
Young itself relied on two such cases, Reagan v. Farmers'
Loan & Trust Co., 154 U. S. 362 (1894), and Smyth v. Ames,
169 U. S. 466 (1898). See 209 U. S., at 153-155. Both
Reagan and Smyth, like Young, involved challenges to state
enforcement of railroad rates. In each case, the Court permitted the federal suit to proceed in part because state statutes authorized state court challenges to those rates. As
Young made clear, however, the fact that the States had
waived immunity in their own courts was not the sole basis
for permitting the federal suit to proceed. Discussing
Reagan, the Young Court stated: "This court held that [language authorizing a suit in state court] permitted a suit in
[federal court], but it also held that, irrespective of that consent, the suit was not in effect a suit against the State (although the Attorney General was enjoined), and therefore
not prohibited under the [Eleventh] [A]mendment. . . . Each
of these grounds is effective and both are of equal force."
209 U. S., at 153 (emphasis added). Similarly, the Young
Court emphasized that the decision in Smyth was not based
solely on the state statute authorizing suit in state court;
rather, it was based on the conclusion that the suit "was not
a suit against a State." 209 U. S., at 154.

293Cite as: 521 U. S. 261 (1997)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
In any event, as the principal opinion ultimately concedes,in more recent cases

Young has been applied "[e]ven if there
is a prompt and effective remedy in a state forum." Ante,at 274. When a plaintiff seeks prospective relief to end an

ongoing violation of federal rights, ordinarily the Eleventh
Amendment poses no bar. Milliken, 433 U. S., at 289-290.Yet the principal opinion unnecessarily questions this basic

principle of federal law, finding it "difficult to say States con-sented to these types of suits in the plan of the Convention.
. . . For purposes of the Supremacy Clause, it is simply irrele-vant whether the claim is brought in state or federal court."
Ante, at 274-275. We have frequently acknowledged the
importance of having federal courts open to enforce and interpret federal rights. See Green v. Mansour, 474 U. S., at
68 ("[T]he availability of prospective relief of the sort
awarded in Ex parte Young gives life to the Supremacy
Clause. Remedies designed to end a continuing violation of
federal law are necessary to vindicate the federal interest in
assuring the supremacy of that law"); Pennhurst, 465 U. S.,
at 105 ("[T]he Young doctrine has been accepted as necessary to permit the federal courts to vindicate federal rights
and hold state officials responsible to the supreme authority
of the United States. . . . Our decisions repeatedly have emphasized that the Young doctrine rests on the need to promote the vindication of federal rights" (citations and internal
quotation marks omitted)). There is no need to call into
question the importance of having federal courts interpret
federal rights--particularly as a means of serving a federal
interest in uniformity--to decide this case. Nor does acknowledging the interpretive function of federal courts suggest that state courts are inadequate to apply federal law.

In casting doubt upon the importance of having federal
courts interpret federal law, the principal opinion lays the
groundwork for its central conclusion: that a case-by-case
balancing approach is appropriate where a plaintiff invokes
the Young exception to the Eleventh Amendment's jurisdic521US1 Unit: $U80 [11-18-99 18:46:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN
294 IDAHO v. COEUR d'ALENE TRIBE OF IDAHO

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
tional bar, even when a complaint clearly alleges a violationof federal law and clearly seeks prospective relief. The

principal opinion characterizes our modern Young cases asfitting this case-by-case model.

Ante, at 278-280. While it
is true that the Court has decided a series of cases on the
scope of the Young doctrine, these cases do not reflect theprincipal opinion's approach. Rather, they establish only

that a Young suit is available where a plaintiff alleges an
ongoing violation of federal law, and where the relief sought

is prospective rather than retrospective. Compare Milliken, supra, at 289-290, with Green, supra, at 68 (Eleventh
Amendment bars notice relief where plaintiffs alleged no ongoing violation of federal law); Pennhurst, supra, at 106
(Eleventh Amendment bars suit alleging violation of state
rather than federal law); Edelman, 415 U. S., at 668 (Eleventh Amendment bars relief for past violation of federal law).

The principal opinion properly notes that the Court found
some of the relief awarded by the lower court in Edelman--
an order requiring state officials to release and remit federal
benefits--barred by the Eleventh Amendment. Ante, at
278; see Edelman, supra, at 668. It then states that the
Court did not consider the propriety of other relief awarded
below--an injunction requiring state officials to abide by federal requirements--because the State conceded that such relief was proper under Young. Ante, at 278. The principal
opinion appears to suggest that the Court could have found
such relief improper in the absence of this concession. But
surely the State conceded this point because the law was
well established. Indeed, Edelman is consistently cited for
the proposition that prospective injunctive relief is available
in a Young suit. See, e. g., Milliken, supra, at 289. Similarly, by focusing on the Court's statement in Quern v. Jordan, 440 U. S. 332, 349 (1979), that the state officials did not
object to preparing or sending notice of class members' possible remedies under state administrative procedures, ante, at

the prospective relief granted there because the relief wasnot particularly invasive. But the question in

Quern was
whether the notice relief was more like the prospective reliefallowed in typical

Young suits, or more like the retrospective
relief disallowed in Edelman. 440 U. S., at 347. The Quern
Court permitted the relief to stand not because it was incon-sequential, but because it was adjudged prospective. Finally, the principal opinion explains this Court's decision in
Milliken--which upheld an order requiring a State to pay
for a comprehensive education for children who had beensubjected to segregation--by focusing on the fact that the

federal interests implicated by the claim in that case were
particularly strong. Ante, at 279-280. Again, however, the
Court upheld the relief not because the complaint sought to
vindicate civil liberties, but because the remedy was prospective rather than retrospective. 433 U. S., at 289. Our
case law simply does not support the proposition that federal
courts must evaluate the importance of the federal right at
stake before permitting an officer's suit to proceed.

Nor can I agree with the principal opinion's attempt to
import the inquiry employed in Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed.
Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388 (1971), into our Young jurisprudence. Ante, at 280. In the Bivens context, where the
issue is whether an implied remedy for money damages exists in a suit against a federal official for a constitutional violation, we have declined to recognize such a remedy where
we have identified "special factors counselling hesitation."
403 U. S., at 396. In likening Young actions to Bivens actions, the principal opinion places great weight on a single
citation in the Court's opinion last Term in Seminole Tribe
of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44 (1996). There, relying on
Schweiker v. Chilicky, 487 U. S. 412, 423 (1988), we noted
that where Congress has created a remedial scheme for the
enforcement of a federal right, we may not supplement that
scheme in a suit against a federal officer with a judicially
created remedy. We reasoned that the same general princi521US1 Unit: $U80 [11-18-99 18:46:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
ple should apply in Young cases. That is, where Congressprescribes a detailed remedial scheme for enforcement of a

statutory right, a court should not lift the Eleventh Amend-ment bar to apply its "full remedial powers" in a suit against
an officer in a manner inconsistent with the legislative
scheme. 517 U. S., at 75. The single citation to a Bivenscase in

Seminole Tribe by no means establishes that a caseby-case balancing approach to the Young doctrine is appro-priate or consistent with our jurisprudence.

In sum, the principal opinion replaces a straightforwardinquiry into whether a complaint alleges an ongoing violation
of federal law and seeks relief properly characterized as pro-spective with a vague balancing test that purports to account
for a "broad" range of unspecified factors. Ante, at 280. In
applying that approach here, the principal opinion relies on
characteristics of this case that do not distinguish it from
cases in which the Young doctrine is properly invoked, such
as the fact that the complaint names numerous public officials
and the fact that the State will have a continuing interest
in litigation against its officials. Ante, at 269-270, 282-283.
These factors cannot supply a basis for deciding this case.
Every Young suit names public officials, and we have never
doubted the importance of state interests in cases falling
squarely within our past interpretations of the Young
doctrine.

While I do not subscribe to the principal opinion's reformulation of the appropriate jurisdictional inquiry for all cases
in which a plaintiff invokes the Young doctrine, I nevertheless agree that the Court reaches the correct conclusion here.
The Young doctrine rests on the premise that a suit against
a state official to enjoin an ongoing violation of federal law
is not a suit against the State. Where a plaintiff seeks to
divest the State of all regulatory power over submerged
lands--in effect, to invoke a federal court's jurisdiction to
quiet title to sovereign lands--it simply cannot be said that
the suit is not a suit against the State. I would not narrow

our Young doctrine, but I would not extend it to reach this
case. Accordingly, I join Parts I, II-A, and III of the
Court's opinion.

Justice Souter, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice
Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.

Congress has implemented the Constitution's grant of
federal-question jurisdiction by authorizing federal courts to
enforce rights arising under the Constitution and federal law.
The federal courts have an obligation to exercise that jurisdiction, and in doing so have applied the doctrine of Ex parte
Young, 209 U. S. 123 (1908), that in the absence of some congressional limitation a federal court may entertain an individual's suit to enjoin a state officer from official action that
violates federal law. The Coeur d'Alene Tribe of Idaho
claims that officers of the State of Idaho are acting to regulate land that belongs to the Tribe under federal law, and the
Tribe prays for declaratory and injunctive relief to halt the
regulation as an ongoing violation of that law.1 The Tribe's
suit falls squarely within the Young doctrine, and the District Court had an obligation to hear it.

The response of today's Court, however, is to deny that
obligation. The principal opinion would redefine the doctrine, from a rule recognizing federal jurisdiction to enjoin
state officers from violating federal law to a principle of equitable discretion as much at odds with Young's result as with
the foundational doctrine on which Young rests. Justice
O'Connor charts a more limited course that wisely rejects
the lead opinion's call for federal jurisdiction contingent on
case-by-case balancing, but sets forth a rule denying jurisdiction here on Eleventh Amendment grounds because the

State itself, but the claim was dismissed as barred by the Eleventh
Amendment, see 42 F. 3d 1244, 1254 (CA9 1994), and we denied certiorari
to review the dismissal. See 517 U. S. 1133 (1996).

Tribe's suit is said to be indistinguishable from one to quiettitle to the submerged lands and could leave the State not

only without possession of the lands but without presentopportunity to regulate them under state law. The Tribe's
suit, however, is no more (or less) against the State than anyof the claims brought in our prior cases applying

Young, andthe State's regulatory authority would be no more imposed

upon than the State's authority in Young itself.While there is reason for great satisfaction that

Justice
O'Connor's view is the controlling one, it is still true thatthe effect of the two opinions is to redefine and reduce the

substance of federal subject-matter jurisdiction to vindicatefederal rights. And it is indeed substance, not form, that is
here at stake, for this case comes on the heels of last Term'sfundamentally erroneous decision in

Seminole Tribe of Fla.v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44 (1996). Consequently, if an individual or Indian tribe may not enter a federal court to obtainrelief against state officers for violating federally derived
property rights, that private plaintiff simply may seek norelief in a federal forum.

I respectfully dissent. I

In Seminole Tribe, the Court declared Ex parte Younginapplicable to the case before it, having inferred that Congress meant to leave no such avenue of relief open to thoseclaiming federal rights under the statute then under consideration. See Seminole Tribe, supra, at 73-76. The Courtleft the basic tenets of

Ex parte Young untouched, however,see Seminole Tribe, supra, at 71-75, nn. 14, 16, 17, and Congress remained free to remove any bar to the invocation of
Young, even in a successive suit by petitioners in SeminoleTribe itself.

When Congress has not so displaced the Young doctrine, afederal court has jurisdiction in an individual's action against
state officers so long as two conditions are met. The plain-tiff must allege that the officers are acting in violation of

federal law,2 see Pennhurst State School and Hospital v.Halderman, 465 U. S. 89, 106 (1984), and must seek prospective relief to address an ongoing violation, not compensationor other retrospective relief for violations past. See Green
v. Mansour, 474 U. S. 64, 68 (1985); Quern v. Jordan, 440U. S. 332, 346-349 (1979);

Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651,664-671 (1974). The Tribe's claim satisfies each condition.

A
The sources of federal law invoked by the Tribe go backto November 8, 1873, when President Grant issued an Executive Order establishing a reservation in the Idaho Territoryfor the Coeur d'Alene Tribe. See 1 C. Kappler, Indian Affairs: Laws and Treaties 837 (1904). The Tribe claims thatthe Executive Order, later ratified by Congress, see Act of
Mar. 3, 1891, ch. 543, $ 19, 26 Stat. 1026-1029, gave it thebeneficial interest, subject only to the trusteeship of the
United States, in the beds and banks of all navigable waterwithin the reservation, including the submerged land under
Lake Coeur d'Alene. See Complaint |||| 19, 24.3 In com-plaining that regulatory actions by the petitioner state officers violate the Tribe's right to exclusive use and occupancyof the submerged lands, the Tribe thus claims that they are
acting in violation of controlling federal legal authority; sincesuch federal authority happens to be necessary for any valid
regulation of Lake Coeur d'Alene's submerged lands and

2 The principal opinion suggests without citation that "in the plan of the
Convention" the States may not have consented to suits in federal courts
against state officers that rest on the interpretation of federal law. Ante,
at 274. Because a suit against a state officer to enjoin an ongoing violation of federal law is not a suit against a State, the scope of state consent
to suit at the founding has no bearing on the availability of officer suits
under Young.

3 The Tribe also claims to hold unextinguished aboriginal title to the

lands, a claim not passed on below, but which we have recognized is based
on federal law. See generally Oneida Indian Nation of N. Y. v. County
of Oneida, 414 U. S. 661 (1974).

navigable waters, the Tribe in effect claims that petitionersare acting ultra vires as a matter of federal law. Petitioners

join issue on just this point, in alleging that the submergedlands were not conveyed by the Executive Order or its ratification but instead passed to Idaho under the equal footing
doctrine when Idaho became a State in 1890. Brief for Pe-titioners 14. While petitioners, as members of the state

board of land commissioners, claim to be implementing thelaw of Idaho in regulating the submerged lands and waters
of Lake Coeur d'Alene as a recreational area and healthresort, see Idaho Code $$ 58-104(9) (Supp. 1996), 67-4304
(1989), 67-4305 (Supp. 1996), they agree with the Tribe that
title to the submerged lands is controlled by federal law.
See Brief for Petitioners 25. The Tribe asked the District
Court to enjoin the state officers from "taking any actions
or enforcing any State statutes, ordinances, regulations, customs or usages which cause [the Tribe and its members] to
be deprived of their rights and privileges of exclusive use
and occupancy to all beds and banks of all navigable water
courses and all waters within the 1873 Coeur d'Alene Reservation boundaries." Complaint || 35.

This is a perfect example of a suit for relief cognizable
under Ex parte Young. Young described the officials' act on
the basis of which jurisdiction was found in that case "simply
[as] an illegal act upon the part of a state official in attempting by the use of the name of the State to enforce a legislative enactment which is void because unconstitutional. . . .
The State has no power to impart to him any immunity from
responsibility to the supreme authority of the United
States." 209 U. S., at 159-160. Later cases have made it
clear that a state official's act is also ultra vires for purposes
of the Young doctrine when it violates other valid federal
law. See, e. g., Larson v. Domestic and Foreign Commerce
Corp., 337 U. S. 682, 698-699 (1949). Such an illegal act
amounting to ultra vires action is, of course, what the Tribe
claims here.

Souter, J., dissenting
This case, to be sure, differs from Young in two respects,but neither of them affects the Tribe's jurisdictional position.

First, the Tribe's claim to have federal law on its side restsupon combined executive and congressional action, not the
National Constitution. If the Tribe is right that the National Government conveyed the submerged lands to theTribe prior to Idaho's admission to statehood, the officials'

action is just as devoid of any valid basis as the acts foundto be void for unconstitutionality in

Young. See Florida
Dept. of State v. Treasure Salvors, Inc., 458 U. S. 670, 675-676, and n. 5, 695-697 (1982) (opinion of

Stevens, J.) (officer
suit may proceed where state officers are acting in violation
of federal statutory law); see also Larson, supra, at 698-699.

The second difference from Young is that this case turns
on federal law governing passage of title to property; but a
government's assumption of title to property is no different
from its assumption of any state authority that it may ultimately turn out not to have. That a claim involves title is
thus irrelevant under Young and has never been treated otherwise. Not only has a title claim never displaced Young so
as to render state officials immune to suit by a rival claimant,
see, e. g., Treasure Salvors, supra, but long before Young had
even been decided United States v. Lee, 106 U. S. 196 (1882),
held federal officers to be subject to a possessory action for
land claimed by the United States on the basis of federal law.
Since for purposes of Young Idaho and its officials claiming
title under federal law are in the same posture as the United
States and its officers in Lee, the appropriate analysis is the
one exemplified in that case. See also Tindal v. Wesley, 167
U. S. 204, 213 (1897) ("[I]t cannot be doubted that the question whether a particular suit is one against the State, within
the meaning of the Constitution, must depend upon the same
principles that determine whether a particular suit is one
against the United States").

In Lee, the Court held there was federal jurisdiction over
an ejectment suit brought by General Lee's son to oust fed521US1 Unit: $U80 [11-18-99 18:46:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Souter, J., dissenting
eral officers from property seized by the United States foralleged nonpayment of taxes and held under an order of the

Secretary of War. The defending officials claimed the "abso-lute immunity from judicial inquiry of every one who

asserts
authority from the executive branch of the government, however clear it may be made that the executive possessed nosuch power," 106 U. S., at 220 (emphasis in original), but they

lost. The Court rejected the proposition that possession ofproperty by federal officers on behalf of the United States
sufficed to immunize the officers from a possessory actionbrought by a private citizen.

4 Lee's suit is seen today as

deciding a claim that the officials involved were acting whollywithout authority as a matter of constitutional law, since

they were barred from dealing with the property by the Gov-ernment's failure to pay the just compensation required by
the Fifth Amendment. See Larson, supra, at 697.

Lee thus illustrates that an issue of property title is no
different from any other legal or constitutional matter that
may have to be resolved in deciding whether the officer of
an immune government is so acting beyond his authority as
to be amenable to suit without necessarily implicating his
government. See Treasure Salvors, supra, at 676, 695-697
(opinion of Stevens, J.) (like this case, involving state officials' reliance on federal law); see also Tindal, supra, at 222.5
Indeed, the decisions of this Court have so held or assumed
as far back as the time of Chief Justice Marshall's statement
in United States v. Peters, 5 Cranch 115, 139-140 (1809), that
"it certainly can never be alleged, that a mere suggestion of
title in a state to property, in possession of an individual,

4 The title claims in this case turn not on a constitutional issue but on
federal title law; this makes no difference under Young. See Larson v.
Domestic and Foreign Commerce Corp., 337 U. S. 682, 698-699 (1949).

5 Whether Tindal is, or must be, amenable to analysis as a federal ultra

vires case we need not now decide; its holding that property title is irrelevant to jurisdictional analysis is not open to question. See 167 U. S., at
222-223.

Souter, J., dissenting
must arrest the proceedings of the court, and prevent theirlooking into the suggestion, and examining the validity of

the title." The contrary rule, Lee later explained, would"sanctio[n] a tyranny which has no existence in the monarchies of Europe, nor in any other government which has a justclaim to well-regulated liberty and the protection of personal
rights." Lee, supra, at 221. Thus did the Chief Justiceforesee that governmental officials are not any the less amenable to suit for relying on their government's claim to prop-erty title, and no decision before today's would have turned
the envious eyes of the old monarchs toward Idaho.

B
The second condition for applying Young is that relief beprospective, not retrospective, a bar to future violations of

federal law, not recompense for past mistakes. See Edelman, 415 U. S., at 664-666. The present complaint asks forjust such relief by seeking to enjoin the State's sport and

recreational regulation of the water covering the lands. Itasks for no damages for past infringement of the tribal interest asserted and no accounting for fees previously collectedby the State in the course of its regulatory oversight.
While there would, of course, be significant consequences tothe State if the Tribe should prevail on the merits, that will
be true whenever Young applies. In Young itself, the Statewas left unable to enforce statutory railroad rate regulation
or collect penalties from violators, and the Young doctrinehas been held to apply even when compliance by the defendant officials will create a charge on the state treasury. Therelief does not cease to be forward looking, nor is the suit
transformed into one against the State itself, so long as itsburden upon the State is merely a "necessary consequence
of [the officers'] compliance in the future with a substantivefederal-question determination." Edelman, supra, at 668.
See also Quern v. Jordan, 440 U. S., at 337 (a "federal court,consistent with the Eleventh Amendment, may enjoin state

officials to conform their future conduct to the requirements
of federal law, even though such an injunction may have an
ancillary effect on the state treasury"). However burdensome it may be to the State when its officers are ordered to
stop violating federal law, it is not the cost of future compliance with federal law, but its character as such, that counts.
See, e. g., id., at 347-349; Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U. S. 267,
288-290 (1977); Edelman, supra, at 664-668.6 In this case,
of course, the State has not identified any charge on its funds
that might be comparable to the cost of compliance approved
in Edelman: the consequence of any success the Tribe might
ultimately have would simply be the end of a regulatory regime (including some fee income) that federal law would

6 While the principal opinion suggests these cases embody a "careful
balancing and accommodation of state interests when determining
whether the Young exception applies in a given case," ante, at 278, in
fact they simply reflect the Court's effort to demarcate the line between
prospective and retrospective relief. That Young represents a "balance
of federal and state interests," Papasan v. Allain, 478 U. S. 265, 277 (1986),
does not mean the doctrine's application should be balanced against other
factors in any given case. Instead, Young's rule recognizing federal judicial power in suits against state officers to enjoin ongoing violations of
federal law itself strikes the requisite balance between state and federal
interests. Where these conditions are met, no additional "balancing" is
required or warranted.

The principal opinion suggests that we held Young to apply in Milliken
v. Bradley, 433 U. S. 267 (1977), because the complaint sought to vindicate
civil liberties and accordingly involved strong federal interest. See ante,
at 279. The undeniable federal interest in protecting civil liberties, however, was not the reason we applied the Young remedy in Milliken. The
sole enquiry in this regard was whether the relief sought was fairly characterized as prospective. See 433 U. S., at 289 (noting that decree "fits
squarely within the prospective-compliance exception reaffirmed by Edelman"). Given that we do not view a suit against a state officer for prospective relief as a suit against the State, the fact, as the majority in
Seminole Tribe reaffirmed, see Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517
U. S. 44, 59 (1996), that Congress may abrogate state immunity from suit
in legislation enacted pursuant to $ 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment has
no bearing on Young's application.

show the officers to lack any authority to maintain on the
State's behalf.

What this straightforward analysis thus shows, precedent
confirms. We have already seen that since the time of
Young, as well as long before it, this Court has consistently
held that a public officer's assertion of property title in the
name of a government immune to suit cannot defeat federal
jurisdiction over an individual's suit to be rid of interference
with the property rights he claims. See, e. g., Treasure Salvors, 458 U. S., at 685-690 (opinion of Stevens, J.); Tindal,
167 U. S., at 221-223; Stanley v. Schwalby, 162 U. S. 255, 270-
271 (1896); Lee, 106 U. S., at 210. By a parity of reasoning,
we have of course drawn the jurisdictional line short of ultimately quieting title (which would run directly against the
State itself as putative title holder and not against its officers) or limiting the affected government in any subsequent
quiet title action. "It is a judgment to the effect only that,
as between the plaintiff and the defendants, the former is
entitled to possession of the property in question, the latter
having shown no valid authority to withhold possession from
the plaintiff." Tindal, supra, at 223; see also Lee, supra, at
222. If dissatisfied with a federal court's interpretation of
federal law in a suit against its officers, a State may itself
subsequently "bring any action that may be appropriate to
establish and protect whatever claim it has to the premises
in dispute." 7 Tindal, supra, at 223; Lee, supra, at 222
("[T]he government is always at liberty, notwithstanding any
such judgment, to avail itself of all the remedies which the

7 One option not available to the State here would be to condemn the
lands outright. Federal law prevents the State from exercising eminent
domain or otherwise acquiring tribal lands directly from the Tribe. See
Rev. Stat. $ 2116, 25 U. S. C. $ 177. Efforts by state and local governments
to regulate or acquire Indian lands accordingly may violate federal law,
but cannot exact a taking. Tribes possess the right under federal common law to sue to enforce their possessory rights in land. County of
Oneida v. Oneida Indian Nation of N. Y., 470 U. S. 226, 235-236 (1985).

law allows to every person, natural or artificial, for the vindi-cation and assertion of its rights"). See also Treasure Salvors, supra, at 688 (opinion of Stevens, J.).8 This, of course,is a right that a State always has after an official has lost a
Young suit, whatever its particular subject.In sum, the Tribe seeks no damages or restitution to compensate for the State's exercise of authority over the land,nor does it ask for rescission of a past transfer of property.
It says that state officers, by their continuing regulation, arecommitting an ongoing violation of federal law that may be
halted by an injunction against the state officers. If theTribe were to prove what it claims, it would establish "precisely the type of continuing violation for which a remedymay permissibly be fashioned under Young." Papasan v.
Allain, 478 U. S. 265, 282 (1986).

II

A

The first of the two points common to the opinions displac-ing Ex parte Young here is that this case pierces Young 's

distinction between State and officer because the relief

8 In this case, were the District Court to hold for the Tribe and conclude
that federal law precludes state regulation, the Quiet Title Act, 28 U. S. C.

$ 2409a, may well preclude the State from bringing a subsequent action to
quiet title to the land at issue, unless the United States consents to suit.
This fact, however, has no bearing on Young's application. The absence
of jurisdiction under the statute to entertain a suit where the Tribe would
be the defendant says nothing about whether the Eleventh Amendment,
as construed by this Court, bars a suit (i. e., whether the State is the true
defendant) where the Tribe is the plaintiff. The two questions are simply
independent of each other. Nor (even assuming that the Young and sovereign immunity rules are convertible into doctrines of equity) does this
state of affairs provide any equitable justification for foreclosing the
Tribe's suit: a congressionally imposed limitation on federal-question jurisdiction is hardly a fault within the meaning of equity practice, see, e. g.,
D. Dobbs, Law of Remedies $ 2.4(2) (2d ed. 1993), and the Tribe, in any
event, bears no responsibility for Congress's decision to enact the statute.

sought would be indistinguishable in practice from a decreequieting title. See ante, at 281 ("Tribe's suit is the functional equivalent of a quiet title action which implicates spe-cial sovereignty interests"); ante, at 282 (relief sought is
"close to the functional equivalent of quiet title"); ante, at 289(opinion of

O'Connor, J.) ("suit is the functional equivalent ofan action to quiet its title"). If this argument were to the

point it would, to begin with, render erroneous the holdingsin Treasure Salvors, for example, and Lee (as interpreted by
Larson, 337 U. S., at 696-697).9 In each of those cases, too,the individual plaintiffs' success against state officers was an
aspersion on the government's claim of title. But a consid-eration of the alternatives shows why such aspersion was
rightly accepted as a fair price to pay for the jurisdiction toconsider individual claims of federal right in those two title
cases, as it has been accepted generally. The one alterna-tive, of settling the matter of title by compelling the State
itself to appear in a federal-question suit, is barred by Elev-enth Amendment doctrine. See,

e. g., Seminole Tribe, 517U. S., at 54; Alabama v. Pugh, 438 U. S. 781, 782 (1978) (per

curiam); Chandler v. Dix, 194 U. S. 590, 591 (1904). The

9 Justice O'Connor says that Treasure Salvors is inapposite because
the plurality's discussion of the property claim there, in her view, focused
on whether the state officials were acting ultra vires state-law authority,
see ante, at 289-290. But the plurality's analysis in Treasure Salvors was
not so limited, and noted that the plaintiff salvage company claimed that
Florida state officials lacked authority to retain treasure recovered from
the sunken galleon because the galleon had been found on submerged land
belonging to the United States, not Florida, as determined under the Submerged Lands Act, $ 2(b), 67 Stat. 29, 43 U. S. C. $ 1301(b), and our decision
in United States v. Florida, 425 U. S. 791 (1976). See Treasure Salvors,
458 U. S., at 676, and n. 5. While the plurality noted further that the
company claimed that the state officials lacked authority under state law
to retain the treasure, see id., at 692-693, there was no question that the
company claimed ownership of the treasure under federal law. Accordingly, I disagree both that Treasure Salvors is inapplicable and that its
reasoning was "narrowed" by Pennhurst State School and Hospital v.
Halderman, 465 U. S. 89 (1984). Cf. ante, at 290 (opinion of O'Connor, J.).

other, of leaving an individual powerless to seek any federal
remedy for violation of a federal right, would deplete the
federal judicial power to a point the Framers could not possibly have intended, given a history of officer liability riding
tandem with sovereign immunity extending back to the Middle Ages. See Jaffe, Suits Against Governments and Officers: Sovereign Immunity, 77 Harv. L. Rev. 1, 18 (1963); Erlich, No. XII: Proceedings Against the Crown (1216-1377)
pp. 28-29, in 6 Oxford Studies in Social and Legal History
(P. Vinogradoff ed. 1921). The holdings in Treasure Salvors
and Lee, like the holding that should obtain here, represent
a line drawn short of such an extreme, and if the Court may
curse it as formalistic so may any line be cursed that must
be drawn somewhere between unacceptable extremes. In
the title cases cited, as in any other such suit, the State could
ultimately settle its title by choosing to litigate the disputed
title once and for all; in most cases, of course, the State may
choose its own forum, though in this instance it would need
the permission of the United States, see n. 8, supra. (As
that note previously explained, the fact that the United
States is required to consent to such a suit against an Indian
tribe has nothing to do with the doctrinal basis of Young and
is hardly an inequity to the States when viewed historically.
See n. 11, infra.) The line is a fair via media between the
extremes.

What is equally significant, finally, is that an officer suit
implicating title is no more or less the "functional equivalent" of an action against the government than any other
Young suit. States are functionally barred from imposing a
railroad rate found unconstitutional when enforced by a state
officer; States are functionally barred from withholding welfare benefits when their officers have violated federal law on
timely payment; States are functionally barred from locking
up prisoners whom their wardens are told to release. There
is nothing unique about the consequences of an officer suit

involving title, and if the Court's reasoning were good in atitle case it would be good in any Young case.

B
The second joint reason that commands a majority turnson the fact that something more than mere title would be

affected if the Tribe were to prevail. As the principal opin-ion puts it, "[t]he suit seeks, in effect, a determination that
the lands in question are not even within the regulatory ju-risdiction of the State,"

ante, at 282, and state ownership ofsubmerged lands "uniquely implicate[s] sovereign interests,"

ante, at 284, such that the injunction sought by the Tribewould have an unusual effect on the State's "dignity and status," ante, at 287. This is the same reason that Justice
O'Connor gives for concluding that Lee and Tindal are notcontrolling here. See

ante, at 290-291. She points out that
Lee and Tindal involved claims to land that remained subjectto state regulation even after the government officers were

held to lack possessory authority, while here, if the Tribewere to prevail, no such regulatory power would be retained
given that the submerged lands would no longer be "withinIdaho's sovereign jurisdiction." Ante, at 289.

While this point is no doubt correct, it has no bearing on
Young's application in this case. The relevant enquiry, asnoted, is whether the state officers are exercising ultra vires

authority over the disputed submerged lands. If they are,a federal court may enjoin their actions, even though such a
ruling would place the land beyond Idaho's regulatory juris-diction and accordingly deny state officers regulatory authority. Idaho indisputably has a significant sovereign interestin regulating its submerged lands, see

Utah Div. of StateLands v. United States, 482 U. S. 193, 195 (1987), but it has no

legitimate sovereign interest in regulating submerged landslocated outside state borders.

If, indeed, there were any doubt that claims implicatingstate regulatory jurisdiction are as much subject to Young

310 IDAHO v. COEUR d'ALENE TRIBE OF IDAHO

Souter, J., dissenting
as cases contesting the possession of property, the facts ofEx parte Young itself would suffice to place that doubt to

rest. Young was a suit to enjoin a State's Attorney Generalfrom enforcing a state statute regulating railroad rates and
threatening violators with heavy sanctions. One wouldhave difficulty imagining a state activity any more central to
state sovereignty than such economic regulation or any moreexpressive of its governmental character than the provision
for heavy fines. A State obliged to choose between powerto regulate a lake and lake bed on an Indian reservation and
power to regulate economic affairs and punish offenderswould not (knowing nothing more) choose the lake. Implications for regulatory jurisdiction, therefore, do nothing todisplace Ex parte Young.

III
The remaining points of exception are, as I understand,confined to the principal opinion.

A
That opinion suggests that the line between officer andState may be dissolved for jurisdictional purposes because

the state officials here were acting in accordance with statelaw in their administration of the disputed land: if state law
purports to authorize the acts complained of, they are notunauthorized for purposes of discerning the line between
officials and their State under the Eleventh Amendment.Ante, at 281, 286-287.

If compliance with state-law authority were a defense toa Young suit, however, there would be precious few Young
suits. State-law compliance is in fact a characteristic cir-cumstance of most cases maintained under

Young, see, e. g.,Edelman, 415 U. S., at 655, which are brought not because

the defendant officials are mavericks under state law but be-cause the state law is claimed to violate federal law made
controlling by the Supremacy Clause. Young, accordingly,made it clear from the start that in a federal-question suit

Souter, J., dissenting
against a state official, action in violation of valid federal lawwas necessarily beyond the scope of any official authority,

thus rendering the official an individual for Eleventh Amend-ment purposes and thus obviating an encroachment on the
State's immunity. 209 U. S., at 159-160; see also Pennhurst,465 U. S., at 102-103, 105;

Quern, 440 U. S., at 337; Scheuerv. Rhodes, 416 U. S. 232, 237 (1974) (noting that since Young,

"it has been settled that the Eleventh Amendment providesno shield for a state official confronted by a claim that he
had deprived another of a federal right under the color ofstate law").

In this case, indeed, the allusion to conformity with statelaw is doubly misplaced, for it is common ground here that
state law is irrelevant if under federal law the combinedexecutive and congressional action vested title to the submerged lands in the Tribe. Each party is claiming underfederal law, and the only issue is whether the regulatory
action by the state officials is authorized or ultra vires asjudged under that federal law. The jurisdictional question
is posed, in other words, just as if this were a suit against afederal officer, as in Larson, 337 U. S., at 701-702, and this
case is essentially like Treasure Salvors, 458 U. S., at 675-676, and n. 5, 695-697, in which the outcome turned directly
on title under federal law. B

The principal opinion's next reason for displacing Youngrests on its view that the declaratory and injunctive relief
the Tribe seeks is functionally equivalent to a money judg-ment and thus would amount to an impermissibly retrospective remedy. "[I]f the Tribe were to prevail, Idaho's sover-eign interest in its lands and waters would be affected in a
degree fully as intrusive as almost any conceivable retro-active levy upon funds in its Treasury."

Ante, at 287. Theprincipal opinion's assumption, in other words, is that intrusiveness is retrospectivity, an equation false to customarylanguage usage and antithetical under extant Eleventh

Amendment doctrine to probably every case decided underEx parte Young, including the original. The exercise of

Young jurisdiction for vindicating individual federal rights isnecessarily "intrusive," simply because state officials sued
under Young are almost always doing exactly what theirStates' legislative and administrative authorities intend
them to do. The state officers in Treasure Salvors were ex-pected to secure 25 percent of the treasure salvaged from a
sunken galleon for the State of Florida; an order to bring thetreasure before a federal court in admiralty was nothing if
not a threat to the State's expectations and intrusive into its
affairs. See 458 U. S., at 678-679, 694 (opinion of Stevens,
J.). So was the injunction requiring the issuance of welfarebenefits within federally mandated time limits in

Edelman,
see 415 U. S., at 656-659; and the order to get out of Arling-ton Cemetery in

Lee, see 106 U. S., at 197, 220-221; and the
order barring enforcement of a rail rate regulation in Youngitself, see 209 U. S., at 132; and any order granting relief in

any federal habeas case, see, e. g., Brennan v. Stewart, 834F. 2d 1248, 1252, n. 6 (CA5 1988). If intrusiveness were to

be a limitation on Young, the limitation would be terminal.10

C
A third reason proposed by the principal opinion in support of today's result is the supposedly supplemental charac-ter of federal-question jurisdiction under

Young, subject to
giving way whenever the private plaintiff would have entree

10 Under existing statutes it would not be even a partial answer to say
that Congress has the power under $ 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to
abrogate state sovereign immunity, as to cases within the subject matter
covered by the state habeas statute, 28 U. S. C. $ 2254, and Rev. Stat.

Will v. Michigan Dept. of State Police, 491 U. S. 58, 71 (1989); and in

to a state forum able to grant the relief sought. But this ismistaken in theory and contrary to practice.

Federal-question jurisdiction turns on subject matter, notthe need to do some job a state court may wish to avoid; it
addresses not the adequacy of a state judicial system, butthe responsibility of federal courts to vindicate what is supposed to be controlling federal law. See Green v. Mansour,474 U. S., at 68 ("[T]he availability of prospective relief of the
sort awarded in Ex parte Young gives life to the SupremacyClause. Remedies designed to end a continuing violation of
federal law are necessary to vindicate the federal interest inassuring the supremacy of that law");

Pennhurst, supra, at105 ("[T]he
Young doctrine has been accepted as necessaryto permit the federal courts to vindicate federal rights and

hold state officials responsible to the supreme authority ofthe United States. . . . Our decisions repeatedly have emphasized that the Young doctrine rests on the need to promotethe vindication of federal rights" (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)). See also Haring v. Prosise, 462U. S. 306, 322-323 (1983) (rejecting proposed rule that would
relegate certain $ 1983 claims to state court in the face ofthe statute's basic policy of providing a federal forum for
vindication of federal rights).11

11 Many federal cases with nondiverse parties, of course, might well have
been brought as state cases if state relief could reasonably have been expected. Section 1983, for example, reflects the "grave congressional concern that the state courts had been deficient in protecting federal rights."

has been an Indian tribe, the readiness of the state courts to vindicate the
federal right has been less than perfect. Cf. United States v. Kagama,

Thus, it is hardly surprising that Ex parte Young itselfgives no hint that the Court thought the relief sought in

federal court was unavailable in the Minnesota state courtsat the time. Young, indeed, relied on prior cases in which
federal courts had entertained suits against state officersnotwithstanding the fact, as the

Young Court expresslynoted, that state forums were available in which the plaintiffs could have vindicated the same claims. See 209 U. S.,at 153-155 (citing Reagan v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., 154
U. S. 362 (1894), and Smyth v. Ames, 169 U. S. 466 (1898)).
Reagan, like Young, was a rate case, in which the plaintiffs
sued the State's Railroad Commission and the State Attorney General in federal court, seeking to enjoin enforcementof the commission's rate order and any attempt by the State's

Attorney General to recover penalties for its violation.Federal jurisdiction was exercised, even though a state statute authorized suit against the commission in state court.While it is true, as the principal opinion notes, see

ante, at
274, that the opinion in Reagan reflects the then-prevalentview that state consent to suit in a state forum amounted to

consent in the federal forum, see Reagan, supra, at 392; contra, Smith v. Reeves, 178 U. S. 436, 441 (1900) (rejecting thatview), the

Reagan Court permitted the suit to proceed in
federal court not on the ground that the state statute author-ized a state suit but regardless of that point. The Court

viewed the case as one to enjoin state officers from enforcinga state statute in violation of federal law, remarking that it
"cannot . . . in any fair sense be considered a suit against theState." 154 U. S., at 392. Likewise, in

challenge the constitutionality of rates imposed on railroads,but the Court permitted the federal suit for injunctive relief

against the State Attorney General to go forward on theground that it was not against the State. See 169 U. S., at
518. Had that not been clear enough, the opinion in Youngwould explain that in

Smyth, the Court "did not base itsdecision on that section [of state law authorizing suit in state

court] when it held that a suit of the nature of that beforeit was not a suit against a State, although brought against
individual state officers for the purpose of enjoining themfrom enforcing, either by civil proceeding or indictment, an
unconstitutional enactment to the injury of the plaintiff 'sright."

Young, supra, at 154.Nor did the Young Court hint that some inadequacy of

state remedies was tantamount to the unavailability of astate forum. See ante, at 271-274 (principal opinion). The
opinion in Young and other cases did indeed include observa-tions that remedies available at law might provide inadequate relief to an aggrieved plaintiff, and Young itself notedthat the failure to comply with the state statute would result
in criminal penalties and hefty fines. But these remarksabout the severity of the sanctions supported the Court's
conviction that an equitable remedy was appropriate, see
Young, supra, at 148, 163-166; see also Poindexter v. Green-how, 114 U. S. 270, 299 (1885), not that a state forum was

unavailable or federal jurisdiction subject to state pre-emption.

12 The principal opinion also appears to rest on a misreading of Osborn
v. Bank of United States, 9 Wheat. 738 (1824), as holding that the officer
suit could proceed only because a suit directly against the State was prohibited. See ante, at 272. Chief Justice Marshall never suggested that
a suit against the officers "would be barred" if the State could be named.
Instead, he made clear that since the suit would be allowed to proceed if
the State could be made a party, it should be allowed to proceed in its
absence. The Chief Justice wrote: "[I]t would be subversive of the best
established principles to say that the laws could not afford the same remedies against the agent employed in doing the wrong, which they would

a state forum should have some bearing on the applicabilityof Ex parte Young is thus as much at odds with precedent

as with basic jurisdictional principles.There is one more strike against the principal opinion's
assumption that there is some significance in the availabilityof a state forum. The day the Court decided

Young, it alsodecided General Oil Co. v. Crain, 209 U. S. 211 (1908). General Oil reviewed an order of the Supreme Court of Tennes-see dismissing a corporation's suit against a state officer for
relief from what it claimed was his violation of the NationalConstitution. The state court had said it lacked jurisdiction
in the matter after construing the suit as one against the
State, which was immune as sovereign. This Court held thedismissal to be reversible error,

13 ruling as a matter of federal law that the suit could not have been construed as being
against the State. See id., at 226-228. State law confer-ring immunity on its officers could not, in other words, constitutionally excuse a state court of general jurisdiction from
an obligation to hear a suit brought to enjoin a state official'saction as exceeding his authority because unconstitutional.

afford against him, could his principal be joined in suit." Osborn, 9
Wheat., at 843. And while the Court recognized the equitable remedy
provided relief "more beneficial and complete than the law can give," id.,
at 845, the Court did not suggest that a remedy in state court was absent,
or that any significance attached to the availability of a state forum.

13 The judgment was not actually reversed because the Court reached

the previously unreviewed challenge to the official's action and found it
meritless. See General Oil Co. v. Crain, 209 U. S., at 231.

14 General Oil's application is not limited to those cases in which a remedy in federal court is unavailable, notwithstanding the observation that
state relief was required given the Eleventh Amendment bar to suit in
federal court, General Oil Co. v. Crain, 209 U. S., at 226, since Young
ensured that the federal courts would be open for injunctive claims just
like those at issue in General Oil. See Fallon, The Ideologies of Federal
Courts Law, 74 Va. L. Rev. 1141, 1209, n. 312 (1988) (sentences surrounding

Cf. Martinez v. California, 444 U. S. 277, 284 (1980) (stateimmunity statute cannot immunize an officer from a $ 1983

officer on state immunity grounds. Insofar as state-courtjurisdiction would count against

L. Rev. 277, 294, n. 97 (1984) ("[I]f prospective relief is a necessary concomitant of a federal right, availability of such relief in federal courts may not
free the states from an obligation to provide it as well").

Nor was General Oil overruled or otherwise "abandoned" by Georgia
R. R. & Banking Co. v. Musgrove, 335 U. S. 900 (1949), in which the Court
dismissed an appeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Georgia holding that state sovereign immunity barred suits asserting constitutional
claims against state officials. Cf. 16B C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper,
Federal Practice and Procedure $ 4024, pp. 363-364 (2d ed. 1996). The
one-paragraph per curiam dismissal in Musgrove stated that an adequate
nonfederal ground supported the state court's decision but did not identify
the state ground involved; the posture of the case suggests that the Court
may have viewed the lower court's decision as based on a valid state law
regarding the timing and not the existence of state remedies. See Fallon,
supra, at 1211, n. 317.

Finally, insofar as General Oil may be read to require that States provide some adequate judicial remedy to redress acts of state officials that
violate federal law, see, e. g., Collins, Article III Cases, State Court Duties,
and the Madisonian Compromise, 1995 Wis. L. Rev. 39, 164, n. 359, but not
necessarily injunctive relief in particular, its relevance for our purposes
remains the same, that is, that every litigant seeking prospective relief in
federal court under Young may obtain some adequate redress in state
court as well.

15 Quite apart even from what General Oil may mandate, it appears that

in all 50 States, as a matter of course, private plaintiffs may obtain declaratory and injunctive relief in state court for the acts of state officials in

LINDH v. MURPHY, WARDEN
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe seventh circuit

No. 96-6298. Argued April 14, 1997--Decided June 23, 1997
Wisconsin tried petitioner Lindh on noncapital murder and attempted

murder charges. In response to his insanity defense, the State called a
psychiatrist who had examined Lindh but who had come under criminal
investigation for sexual exploitation of patients before the trial began.
Lindh's attempt to question the doctor about that investigation in hopes
of showing the doctor's interest in currying favor with the State was
barred by the trial court, and Lindh was convicted. He was denied
relief on his direct appeal, in which he claimed a violation of the Confrontation Clause. He raised that claim again in a federal habeas corpus application, which was denied, and he promptly appealed. Shortly
after oral argument before the Seventh Circuit, the Antiterrorism and
Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (Act) amended the federal habeas
statute. Following an en banc rehearing to consider the Act's impact,
the court held that the amendments to chapter 153 of Title 28, which
governs all habeas proceedings, generally apply to cases pending on
the date of enactment; that applying the new version of 28 U. S. C.

$ 2254(d)--which governs standards affecting entitlement to relief--to
pending cases would not have a retroactive effect barring its application
under Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244, because it would
not attach new legal consequences to events preceding enactment; and
that the statute applied to Lindh's case.

Held: Since the new provisions of chapter 153 generally apply only to

cases filed after the Act became effective, they do not apply to pending
noncapital cases such as Lindh's. Pp. 324-337.

(a) Wisconsin errs in arguing that whenever a new statute on its face
could apply to the litigation of events preceding enactment, there are
only two alternative sources of rules to determine its ultimate temporal
reach: either Congress's express command or application of the Landgraf default rule governing retroactivity. Normal rules of construction
apply in determining a statute's temporal reach generally and whether
a statute's terms would produce a retroactive effect. Although Landgraf's rule would deny application when a retroactive effect would otherwise result, other construction rules may apply to remove even the
possibility of retroactivity (as by rendering the statutory provision

Syllabus
wholly inapplicable to a particular case), as Lindh argues the recognition
of a negative implication would do here. Pp. 324-326.

(b) The statute reveals Congress's general intent to apply the chapter
153 amendments only to cases filed after its enactment. The Act revised chapter 153 for all habeas proceedings. Then $ 107 of the Act
created an entirely new chapter 154 for habeas proceedings in capital
cases, with special rules favorable to those States that meet certain
conditions. Section 107(c) expressly applies chapter 154 to pending
cases. The negative implication is that the chapter 153 amendments
were meant to apply only to cases filed after enactment. If Congress
was reasonably concerned to ensure that chapter 154 applied to pending
cases, only a different intent explains the fact that it did not enact a
similar provision for chapter 153. Had the chapters evolved separately
and been joined together at the last minute, after chapter 154 had acquired its mandate, there might have been a possibility that Congress
intended the same rule for each chapter, but was careless in the roughand-tumble. But those are not the circumstances here: $ 107(c) was
added after the chapters were introduced as a single bill. Section
107(c)'s insertion thus illustrates the familiar rule that negative implications raised by disparate provisions are strongest when the portions
of a statute treated differently had already been joined together and
were being considered simultaneously when the language raising the
implication was inserted. See Field v. Mans, 516 U. S. 59. Respondent's one competing explanation--that $ 107(c) was intended to fix an
ambiguity over when a State would qualify for chapter 154's favorable
rules--is too remote to displace the straightforward inference that chapter 153 was not meant to apply to pending cases. Finally, while new

$ 2264(b)--which was enacted within chapter 154 and provides that new

$$ 2254(d) and (e) in chapter 153 would apply to pending chapter 154
cases--does not speak to the present issue with flawless clarity, it tends
to confirm the interpretation of $ 107(c) adopted here. It shows that
Congress assumed that in the absence of $ 2264(b), new $$ 2254(d) and
(e) would not apply to pending cases. Pp. 326-337.

96 F. 3d 856, reversed and remanded.

Opinion of the Court
applications in noncapital cases that were already pendingwhen the Act was passed. We hold that it does not.

I
Wisconsin tried Aaron Lindh on multiple charges of mur-der and attempted murder. In response to his insanity defense, the State called a psychiatrist who had spoken withLindh immediately after the killings but had later, and before Lindh's trial, come under criminal investigation by theState for sexual exploitation of some of his patients. Although, at trial, Lindh tried to ask the psychiatrist aboutthat investigation, hoping to suggest the witness's interest
in currying favor with the State, the trial court barred thequestioning. Lindh was convicted.

On direct appeal, Lindh claimed a violation of the Confron-tation Clause of the National Constitution, but despite the
denial of relief, Lindh sought neither review in this Courtnor state collateral review. Instead, on July 9, 1992, he filed
a habeas corpus application in the United States DistrictCourt, in which he again argued his Confrontation Clause
claim. When relief was denied in October 1995, Lindhpromptly appealed to the Seventh Circuit. Shortly after
oral argument there, however, the federal habeas statutewas amended, and the Seventh Circuit ordered Lindh's case
be reheard en banc to see whether the new statute appliedto Lindh and, if so, how his case should be treated.

The Court of Appeals held that the Act's amendments tochapter 153 of Title 28 generally did apply to cases pending
on the date of enactment. 96 F. 3d 856, 863 (1996). Sincethe court did not read the statute as itself answering the
questions whether or how the newly amended version of$ 2254(d) would apply to pending applications like Lindh's,
id., at 861-863, it turned to this Court's recent decision inLandgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244 (1994).
Landgraf held that, where a statute did not clearly mandatean application with retroactive effect, a court had to deter521US1 Unit: $U81 [11-30-99 19:32:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
mine whether applying it as its terms ostensibly indicatedwould have genuinely retroactive effect; if so, the judicial

presumption against retroactivity would bar its application.The Seventh Circuit concluded that applying the new

$ 2254(d) to cases already pending would not have genuinelyretroactive effect because it would not attach "new legal consequences" to events preceding enactment, and the courtheld the statute applicable to Lindh's case. 96 F. 3d, at 863-
867 (citing Landgraf, supra, at 270). On the authority of thenew statute, the court then denied relief on the merits. 96
F. 3d, at 868-877.The Seventh Circuit's decision that the new version of

$ 2254(d) applies to pending, chapter 153 cases conflicts withthe holdings of Edens v. Hannigan, 87 F. 3d 1109, 1112, n. 1
(CA10 1996), Boria v. Keane, 90 F. 3d 36, 37-38 (CA2 1996)(per curiam), and Jeffries v. Wood, 114 F. 3d 1484 (CA9
1997). In accord with the Seventh Circuit is the $ 2253(c)case of Hunter v. United States, 101 F. 3d 1565, 1568-1573
(CA11 1996) (en banc) (relying on Lindh to hold certainamendments to chapter 153 applicable to pending cases).
We granted certiorari limited to the question whether thenew $ 2254(d) applies to Lindh's case, 519 U. S. 1074 (1996),
and we now reverse. II

Before getting to the statute itself, we have to addressWisconsin's argument that whenever a new statute on its
face could apply to the litigation of events that occurred be-fore it was enacted, there are only two alternative sources
of rules to determine its ultimate temporal reach: either an"express command" from Congress or application of our
Landgraf default rule. In Landgraf, we said:

"When a case implicates a federal statute enactedafter the events in suit, the court's first task is to determine whether Congress has expressly prescribed thestatute's proper reach. If Congress has done so, of
course, there is no need to resort to judicial default

521US1 Unit: $U81 [11-30-99 19:32:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN

325Cite as: 521 U. S. 320 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
rules. When, however, the statute contains no such ex-press command, the court must determine whether the

new statute would have retroactive effect . . . . If thestatute would operate retroactively, our traditional presumption teaches that it does not govern absent clearcongressional intent favoring such a result."

Landgraf,supra, at 280.

Wisconsin insists that this language means that, in the ab-sence of an express command regarding temporal reach, this
Court must determine that temporal reach for itself byapplying its judicial default rule governing retroactivity, to
the exclusion of all other standards of statutory interpreta-tion. Brief for Respondent 9-14; see also Hunter v. United
States, supra, at 1569 (suggesting that Landgraf may haveannounced a general clear-statement rule regarding the temporal reach of statutes).Wisconsin's reading, however, ignores context. The language quoted disposed of the question whether the practiceof applying the law as it stands at the time of decision represented a retreat from the occasionally conflicting positionthat retroactivity in the application of new statutes is disfavored. The answer given was no, and the presumptionagainst retroactivity was reaffirmed in the traditional rule
requiring retroactive application to be supported by a clearstatement. Landgraf thus referred to "express command[s]," "unambiguous directive[s]," and the like where itsought to reaffirm that clear-statement rule, but only there.
See Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S., at 263 ("[U]n-ambiguous directive" is necessary to authorize "retroactive
application"); id., at 264 (statutes "will not be construed tohave retroactive effect unless their language requires this
result" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)); id.,at 272-273 ("Requiring clear intent assures that Congress
itself has affirmatively considered the potential unfairnessof retroactive application");

id., at 286 (finding "no clear evi-dence of congressional intent" to rebut the "presumption

Opinion of the Court
against statutory retroactivity"); id., at 286 (Scalia, J., con-curring in judgment) (agreeing that "a legislative enactment

affecting substantive rights does not apply retroactively ab-sent clear statement to the contrary").

In determining whether a statute's terms would producea retroactive effect, however, and in determining a statute's
temporal reach generally, our normal rules of constructionapply. Although

Landgraf 's default rule would deny appli-cation when a retroactive effect would otherwise result,

other construction rules may apply to remove even the possi-bility of retroactivity (as by rendering the statutory provision wholly inapplicable to a particular case), as Lindh ar-gues the recognition of a negative implication would do here.
In sum, if the application of a term would be retroactive asto Lindh, the term will not be applied, even if, in the absence
of retroactive effect, we might find the term applicable; if itwould be prospective, the particular degree of prospectivity
intended in the Act will be identified in the normal course inorder to determine whether the term does apply to Lindh.

III
The statute reveals Congress's intent to apply the amend-ments to chapter 153 only to such cases as were filed after

the statute's enactment (except where chapter 154 otherwisemakes select provisions of chapter 153 applicable to pending
cases). Title I of the Act stands more or less independentof the Act's other titles

1 in providing for the revision of federal habeas practice and does two main things. First, in$$ 101-106, it amends $ 2244 and $$ 2253-2255 of chapter 153

of Title 28 of the United States Code, governing all habeascorpus proceedings in the federal courts.

2 110 Stat. 1217-

1 The other titles address such issues as restitution to victims of crime
(Title II), various aspects of international terrorism (Titles II, III, IV, VII,
VIII), restrictions on various kinds of weapons and explosives (Titles V
and VI), and miscellaneous items (Title IX). See 110 Stat. 1214-1217.

2 Section 103 also amends Rule 22 of the Federal Rules of Appellate

Procedure. 110 Stat. 1218.

Opinion of the Court
1221. Then, for habeas proceedings against a State in capi-tal cases, $ 107 creates an entirely new chapter 154 with special rules favorable to the state party, but applicable onlyif the State meets certain conditions, including provision
for appointment of postconviction counsel in state proceed-ings.

3 110 Stat. 1221-1226. In $ 107(c), the Act provides

that "Chapter 154 . . . shall apply to cases pending on or afterthe date of enactment of this Act." 110 Stat. 1226.

We read this provision of $ 107(c), expressly applying chap-ter 154 to all cases pending at enactment, as indicating implicitly that the amendments to chapter 153 were assumedand meant to apply to the general run of habeas cases only
when those cases had been filed after the date of the Act.The significance of this provision for application to pending
cases becomes apparent when one realizes that when chapter154 is applicable, it will have substantive as well as purely
procedural effects. If chapter 154 were merely proceduralin a strict sense (say, setting deadlines for filing and disposition, see 28 U. S. C. $$ 2263, 2266 (1994 ed., Supp. II); 110Stat. 1223, 1224-1226), the natural expectation would be that
it would apply to pending cases. Landgraf, supra, at 275(noting that procedural changes "may often be applied in
suits arising before their enactment without raising concernsabout retroactivity"). But chapter 154 does more, for in its
revisions of prior law to change standards of proof and per-suasion in a way favorable to a State, the statute goes beyond "mere" procedure to affect substantive entitlement torelief. See 28 U. S. C. $ 2264(b) (1994 ed., Supp. II); 110 Stat.
1223 (incorporating revised legal standard of new $ 2254(d)).Landgraf did not speak to the rules for determining the
temporal reach of such a statute (having no need to do so).While the statute might not have a true retroactive effect,
neither was it clearly "procedural" so as to fall within the

328 LINDH v. MURPHY

Opinion of the Court
Court's express (albeit qualified) approval of applying suchstatutes to pending cases. Since Landgraf was the Court's

latest word on the subject when the Act was passed, Con-gress could have taken the opinion's cautious statement
about procedural statutes and its silence about the kindof provision exemplified by the new $ 2254(d) as counseling
the wisdom of being explicit if it wanted such a provisionto be applied to cases already pending. While the terms of

$ 107(c) may not amount to the clear statement required fora mandate to apply a statute in the disfavored retroactive
way,4 they do serve to make it clear as a general matter that

4 In United States v. Nordic Village, Inc., 503 U. S. 30, 34-37 (1992), this
Court held that the existence of "plausible" alternative interpretations
of statutory language meant that that language could not qualify as an
"unambiguous" expression of a waiver of sovereign immunity. And cases
where this Court has found truly "retroactive" effect adequately authorized by a statute have involved statutory language that was so clear that
it could sustain only one interpretation. See Graham & Foster v. Goodcell, 282 U. S. 409, 416-420 (1931) (holding that a statutory provision "was
manifestly intended to operate retroactively according to its terms" where
the tax statute spelled out meticulously the circumstances that defined the
claims to which it applied and where the alternative interpretation was
absurd); Automobile Club of Mich. v. Commissioner, 353 U. S. 180, 184
(1957) (finding a clear statement authorizing the Commissioner of Internal
Revenue to correct tax rulings and regulations "retroactively" where the
statutory authorization for the Commissioner's action spoke explicitly in
terms of "retroactivity"); United States v. Zacks, 375 U. S. 59, 65-67 (1963)
(declining to give retroactive effect to a new substantive tax provision by
reopening claims otherwise barred by statute of limitations and observing
that Congress had provided for just this sort of retroactivity for other
substantive provisions by explicitly creating new grace periods in which
otherwise barred claims could be brought under the new substantive law).
Cf. Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44, 55-57 (1996) (finding a
clear statement of congressional abrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity where the federal statute went beyond granting federal jurisdiction to hear a claim and explicitly contemplated "the State" as defendant
in federal court in numerous provisions of the Act).

Landgraf suggested that the following language from an unenacted precursor of the statute at issue in that case might possibly have qualified as
a clear statement for retroactive effect: "[This Act] shall apply to all

Opinion of the Court
chapter 154 applies to pending cases when its terms fit thosecases at the particular procedural points they have reached.

(As to that, of course, there may well be difficult issues, andit may be that application of Landgraf 's default rule will be
necessary to settle some of them.)The next point that is significant for our purposes is that
everything we have just observed about chapter 154 is trueof changes made to chapter 153. As we have already noted,
amended $ 2254(d) (in chapter 153 but applicable to chapter154 cases) governs standards affecting entitlement to relief.
If, then, Congress was reasonably concerned to ensure thatchapter 154 be applied to pending cases, it should have been
just as concerned about chapter 153, unless it had the differ-ent intent that the latter chapter not be applied to the general run of pending cases.Nothing, indeed, but a different intent explains the different treatment. This might not be so if, for example, the twochapters had evolved separately in the congressional process,
only to be passed together at the last minute, after chapter
154 had already acquired the mandate to apply it to pendingcases. Under those circumstances, there might have been a

real possibility that Congress would have intended the samerule of application for each chapter, but in the rough-andtumble no one had thought of being careful about chapter153, whereas someone else happened to think of inserting a

proceedings pending on or commenced after the date of enactment of
this Act." 511 U. S., at 260 (emphasis added; internal quotation marks
omitted). But, even if that language did qualify, its use of the sort of
absolute language absent from $ 107(c) distinguishes it. Cf. United States

immunity "unequivocally expressed" in language granting jurisdiction

provision in chapter 154. But those are not the circum-stances here. Although chapters 153 and 154 may have

begun life independently and in different Houses of Con-gress,

5 it was only after they had been joined together and

introduced as a single bill in the Senate (S. 735) that what isnow $ 107(c) was added.

6 Both chapters, therefore, had to

have been in mind when $ 107(c) was added. Nor was thereanything in chapter 154 prior to the addition that made the

intent to apply it to pending cases less likely than a similarintent to apply chapter 153. If anything, the contrary is
true, as the discussion of $ 2264(b) will indicate.The insertion of $ 107(c) with its different treatments of
the two chapters thus illustrates the familiar rule that nega-tive implications raised by disparate provisions are strongest
when the portions of a statute treated differently hadalready been joined together and were being considered
simultaneously when the language raising the implicationwas inserted. See Field v. Mans, 516 U. S. 59, 75 (1995)
("The more apparently deliberate the contrast, the strongerthe inference, as applied, for example, to contrasting statutory sections originally enacted simultaneously in relevantrespects . . ."). When $ 107(c) was added, that is, a thoughtful Member of the Congress was most likely to have intendedjust what the later reader sees by inference.

The strength of the implication is not diminished bythe one competing explanation suggested, see Brief for
Respondent 11-12, which goes as follows. Chapter 154provides for expedited filing and adjudication of habeas

5 See 96 F. 3d 856, 861 (CA7 1996). Lindh concedes this much. Brief
for Petitioner 23, n. 15.

6 Amendment 1199, offered by Senator Dole on May 25, 1995, added what

was then $ 607(c) and now is $ 107(c). See 141 Cong. Rec. 14600, 14614
(1995). A comparison of S. 735 as it stood on May 1, 1995, and S. 735 as
it passed the Senate on June 7, after the substitution of Amendment 1199,
reveals that the part of the bill dealing with habeas corpus reform was
substantially the same before and after the amendment in all ways relevant to our interpretation of $ 107(c).

Opinion of the Court
applications in capital cases when a State has met certainconditions. In general terms, applications will be expedited

(for a State's benefit) when a State has made adequate pro-vision for counsel to represent indigent habeas applicants
at the State's expense. Thus, $ 2261(b) provides that "[t]his
chapter is applicable if a State establishes . . . a mechanismfor the appointment, compensation, and payment of reasonable litigation expenses of competent counsel in State post-conviction proceedings brought by indigent prisoners . . . ."
110 Stat. 1221-1222. There is an ambiguity in the provisionjust quoted, the argument runs, for it applies chapter 154
to capital cases only where "a State establishes . . . a mechanism," leaving a question whether the chapter would apply
if a State had already established such a mechanism before
chapter 154 was passed. The idea is that the present tense
of the word "establishes" might be read to rule out a State
that already had "established" a mechanism, suggesting that
when $ 107(c) was added to provide that the chapter would
apply to "cases pending" it was meant to eliminate the ambiguity by showing that all pending cases would be treated
alike.

This explanation of the significance of $ 107(c) is not, however, very plausible. First, one has to strain to find the ambiguity on which the alternative explanation is supposed to
rest. Why would a Congress intent on expediting capital
habeas cases have wanted to disfavor a State that already
had done its part to promote sound resolution of prisoners'
petitions in just the way Congress sought to encourage? It
would make no sense to leave such States on the slower
track, and it seems unlikely that federal courts would so have
interpreted $ 2261(b). Second, anyone who had seen such
ambiguity lurking could have dispatched it in a far simpler
and straightforward fashion than enacting $ 107(c); all the
drafter would have needed to do was to insert three words
into $ 2261(b), to make it refer to a State that "establishes or
has established . . . a mechanism." It simply is not plausible

332 LINDH v. MURPHY

Opinion of the Court
that anyone so sensitive as to find the unlikely ambiguity
would be so delphic as to choose $ 107(c) to fix it. Indeed,

$ 107(c) would (on the ambiguity hypothesis) be at least as
uncertain as the language it was supposed to clarify, since
"cases pending" could be read to refer to cases pending in
States that set up their mechanisms only after the effective
date of the Act. The hypothesis of fixing ambiguity, then,
is too remote to displace the straightforward inference that
chapter 153 was not meant to apply to pending cases.

Finally, we should speak to the significance of the new

$ 2264(b), which Lindh cites as confirming his reading of

$ 107(c) of the Act. While $ 2264(b) does not speak to the
present issue with flawless clarity, we agree with Lindh that
it tends to confirm the interpretation of $ 107(c) that we
adopt. Section 2264(b) is a part of the new chapter 154 and
provides that "[f]ollowing review subject to subsections (a),
(d), and (e) of $ 2254, the court shall rule on the claims [subject to expedited consideration] before it." 110 Stat. 1223.
As we have said before, $ 2254 is part of chapter 153 applying
to habeas cases generally, including cases under chapter 154.
Its subsection (a) existed before the Act, simply providing
for a habeas remedy for those held in violation of federal law.
Although $ 2254 previously had subsections lettered (d) and
(e) (dealing with a presumption of correctness to be accorded
state-court factual findings and the production of state-court
records when evidentiary sufficiency is challenged, respectively) the Act eliminated the old (d) and relettered the old
(e) as (f); in place of the old (d), it inserted a new (d) followed
by a new (e), the two of them dealing with, among other
things, the adequacy of state factual determinations as bearing on a right to federal relief, and the presumption of correctness to be given such state determinations. 110 Stat.
1219. It is to these new provisions (d) and (e), then, that

$ 2264(b) refers when it provides that chapter 154 determinations shall be made subject to them.

Opinion of the Court
Leaving aside the reference to $ 2254(a) for a moment,why would Congress have provided specifically in $ 2264(b)

that chapter 154 determinations shall be made subject to$$ 2254(d) and (e), given the fact that the latter are part of
chapter 153 and thus independently apply to habeas gen-erally? One argument is that the answer lies in $ 2264(a),
which (in expedited capital cases) specially provides an ex-haustion requirement (subject to three exceptions), restricting federal habeas claims to those "raised and decided on themerits in the State courts. . . ." 110 Stat. 1223. See 96
F. 3d, at 862-863. The argument assumes (and we will as-sume for the sake of the argument) that in expedited capital
cases, this provision of $ 2264(a) supersedes the require-ments for exhaustion of state remedies imposed as a general matter by $$ 2254(b) and (c).7 The argument then goes

7 There are reasons why the position that $ 2264(a) replaces rather than
complements $$ 2254(b) and (c) is open to doubt: Lindh argues with some
force that to read $ 2264(a) as replacing the exhaustion requirement of

$$ 2254(b) and (c) would mean that in important classes of cases (those in
the categories of three $ 2264(a) exceptions), the State would not be able
to insist on exhaustion in the state courts. In cases raising claims of
newly discovered evidence, for example, the consequence could be that the
State could not prevent the prisoner from going directly to federal court
and evading $ 2254(e)'s presumption of correctness of state-court factual
findings as well as $ 2254(d)'s new, highly deferential standard for evaluating state-court rulings. It is true that a State might be perfectly content
with the prisoner's choice to go straight to federal court in some cases,
but the State has been free to waive exhaustion to get that result. The
State has not explained why Congress would have wanted to deprive the
States of the $ 2254 exhaustion tools in chapter 154 cases, and we are hard
pressed to come up with a reason, especially considering the Act's apparent general purpose to enhance the States' capacities to control their
own adjudications. It would appear that the State's reading of $ 2264(a)
would also eliminate from chapter 154 cases the provisions of $ 2254 that
define the exhaustion requirement explicitly as requiring a claim to be
raised by any and every available procedure in the State, 28 U. S. C.

$ 2254(c), that newly authorize federal courts to deny unexhausted claims
on the merits, $ 2254(b)(2), and that newly require a State's waiver of

Opinion of the Court
on, that $ 2264(b) is explicit in applying $$ 2254(d) and (e) tosuch capital cases in order to avoid any suggestion that when

Congress enacted $ 2264(a) to supersede $$ 2254(b) and (c) onexhaustion, Congress also meant to displace the neighboring provisions of $$ 2254(d) and (e) dealing with such thingsas the status of state factual determinations. But we find
this unlikely. First, we find it hard to imagine why anyonewould read a superseding exhaustion rule to address the applicability not just of the other exhaustion requirement butof provisions on the effect of state factual determinations.
Anyone who did read the special provision for exhaustionin capital cases to supersede not only the general exhaustion
provisions but evidentiary status and presumption provi-sions as well would have had to assume that Congress could
reasonably have meant to leave the law on expedited capi-tal cases (which is more favorable to the States that fulfill
its conditions) without any presumption of the correctnessof relevant state factual determinations. This would not,
we think, be a reasonable reading and thus not a readingthat Congress would have feared and addressed through

$ 2264(b). We therefore have to find a different function forthe express requirement of $ 2264(b) that chapter 154 determinations be made in accordance with $$ 2254(d) and (e).Continuing on the State's assumption that $ 2264(a) replaces rather than complements $ 2254's exhaustion pro-visions, we can see that the function of providing that

$$ 2254(d) and (e) be applicable in chapter 154 cases is, in fact,
exhaustion to be shown to be express, $ 2254(b)(3). No explanation for
why Congress would have wanted to deny the States these advantages is
apparent or offered by the parties, which suggests that no such effects
were intended at all but that $ 2264(a) was meant as a supplement to
rather than a replacement for $$ 2254(b) and (c).

Nevertheless, as stated in the text, we assume for the sake of argument
that the State's understanding of $ 2264(a) as replacing rather than complementing the chapter 153 exhaustion requirements for chapter 154 is the
correct one. Forceful arguments can be made on each side, and we do not
need to resolve the conflict here.

Opinion of the Court
supportive of the negative implication apparent in $ 107(c).There would have been no need to provide expressly that

subsections (d) and (e) would apply with the same temporalreach as the entirely new provisions of chapter 154 if all the
new provisions in both chapters 153 and 154 were potentially
applicable to cases pending when the Act took effect, as wellas to those filed later. If the special provision for applying

$$ 2254(d) and (e) in cases under chapter 154 has any utility,then, it must be because subsections (d) and (e) might not
apply to all chapter 154 cases; since chapter 154 and the newsections of chapter 153 unquestionably apply alike to cases
filed after the Act took effect, the cases to which subsections
(d) and (e) from chapter 153 would not apply without express
provision must be those cases already pending when the Act
took effect. The utility of $ 2264(b), therefore, is in providing that when a pending case is also an expedited capital
case subject to chapter 154, the new provisions of $$ 2254(d)
and (e) will apply to that case. The provision thus confirms
that Congress assumed that in the absence of such a provision, $$ 2254(d) and (e) (as new parts of chapter 153) would
not apply to pending federal habeas cases.

This analysis is itself consistent, in turn, with Congress's
failure in $ 2264(b) to make any express provision for applying $$ 2254(f ), (g), (h), or (i). Subsections (f) and (g) deal
with producing state-court evidentiary records and their
admissibility as evidence. Congress would obviously have
wanted these provisions to apply in chapter 154 pending
cases, but because they were old provisions, which had already attached to "pending" capital habeas cases (only their
letter designations had been amended), Congress had no
need to make any special provision for their application to
pending capital habeas cases that might immediately or later
turn out to be covered by chapter 154. Subsections (h) and
(i), however, are new; if Congress wanted them to apply to
chapter 154 cases from the start it would on our hypotheses
have had to make the same special provision that $ 2264(b)

336 LINDH v. MURPHY

Opinion of the Court
made for subsections (d) and (e). But there are reasons whyCongress need not have made any special provisions for subsections (h) and (i) to apply to the "pending" chapter 154cases. Subsections (h) and (i) deal, respectively, with the
appointment of counsel for the indigent in the federal proceeding, and the irrelevance to habeas relief of the adequacyof counsel's performance in previous postconviction proceedings. See 110 Stat. 1219-1220. There was no need to makesubsection (h) immediately available to pending cases, capital
or not, because 21 U. S. C. $ 848(q)(4)(B) already authorizedappointment of counsel in such cases. And there was no
reason to make subsection (i) immediately available for a
State's benefit in expedited capital cases, for chapter 154 already dealt with the matter in $ 2261(e), see 110 Stat. 1222.
There is, therefore, a good fit of the $ 2264(b) references with
the inference that amendments to chapter 153 were meant
to apply only to subsequently filed cases; where there was
a good reason to apply a new chapter 153 provision in the
litigation of a chapter 154 case pending when the Act took
effect, $ 2264(b) made it applicable, and when there was no
such reason it did no such thing.

There is only one loose end. Section 2254(a) was an old
provision, without peculiar relevance to chapter 154 cases,
but applicable to them without any need for a special provision; as an old provision it was just like the lettered subsections (f) and (g). Why did $ 2264(b) make an express provision for applying it to chapter 154 cases? No answer leaps
out at us. All we can say is that in a world of silk purses
and pigs' ears, the Act is not a silk purse of the art of statutory drafting.

The upshot is that our analysis accords more coherence
to $$ 107(c) and 2264(b) than any rival we have examined.
That is enough. We hold that the negative implication of

$ 107(c) is that the new provisions of chapter 153 generally apply only to cases filed after the Act became effective.
Because Lindh's case is not one of these, we reverse the

judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case forfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.
Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice Scalia,
Justice Kennedy, and Justice Thomas join, dissenting.

The Court in this case conducts a truncated inquiry into aquestion of congressional intent, and, I believe, reaches the

wrong result. The Court begins, uncontroversially enough,by observing that application of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) to pending casesdepends upon congressional intent, and that our inquiry into
that intent should rely upon the "normal rules" of statutoryconstruction.

Ante, at 326. The Court then proceeds, how-ever, to disregard all of our retroactivity case law--which

it rather oddly disparages as manifestations of "Landgraf 'sdefault rule,"

ibid.--in favor of a permissible, but by nomeans controlling, negative inference that it draws from the

statutory text. I would instead interpret the AEDPA inlight of the whole of our longstanding retroactivity jurisprudence, and accordingly find that the amended 28 U. S. C.$ 2254(d) (1994 ed., Supp. II) applies to pending cases.

The first question we must ask is whether Congress hasexpressly resolved whether the provision in question applies to pending cases. Landgraf v. USI Film Products,511 U. S. 244, 280 (1994). Here, the answer is plainly no.
The AEDPA does not clearly state, one way or the other,whether chapter 153 applies to pending cases. Given congressional silence, we must still interpret that statute, andthat interpretation is in turn guided by the retroactivity
principles we have developed over the years. The Court re-lies on one canon of statutory interpretation, expressio unius
est exclusio alterius, to the exclusion of all others.The Court's opinion rests almost entirely on the negative
inference that can be drawn from the fact that Congress ex-pressly made chapter 154, pertaining to capital cases, ap521US1 Unit: $U81 [11-30-99 19:32:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
plicable to pending cases, but did not make the same ex-press provision in regards to chapter 153. That inference,

however, is by no means necessary, nor is it even clearlythe best inference possible. Certainly, Congress might have
intended that omission to signal its intent that chapter 153not apply to pending cases. But there are other, equally
plausible, alternatives.First, because chapter 154's applicability is conditioned
upon antecedent events--namely, a State's establishing qual-ifying capital habeas representation procedures--Congress
could have perceived a greater likelihood that, absent ex-press provision otherwise, courts would fail to apply that
chapter's provisions to pending capital cases. Second, be-cause of the characteristically extended pendency of collateral attacks on capital convictions,1 and because of Congress'concern with the perceived acquiescence in capital defendants' dilatory tactics by some federal courts (as evidenced bychapter 154's strict time limits for adjudication of capital
cases and, indeed, by the very title of the statute, the "Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996"), Congress could very well have desired to speak with exactingclarity as to the applicability of the AEDPA to pending capital cases. Or third, Congress, while intending the AEDPAdefinitely to apply to pending capital cases, could have been
uncertain or in disagreement as to which of the many por-tions of chapter 153 should or should not apply to pending
cases. Congress could simply have assumed that the courtswould sort out such questions, using our ordinary retroactivity presumptions.None of these competing inferences is clearly superior

to the others. The Court rejects the first, ante, at 330-332,as an "implausible" solution to an "unlikely" ambiguity. But

1 See, e. g., Pet. for Habeas Corpus in In re Mata, O. T. 1995, No. 96-
5679, p. 7 (describing how it took nine years and three months for a Federal District Court to deny, and the Ninth Circuit to affirm, petitioner's
first federal capital habeas petition).

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
the solution is not nearly as implausible as the Court's con-tention that, in order to show that it wished chapter

153 not
to apply to pending cases, Congress chose to make chapter
154 expressly applicable to such cases. If Congress wanted
to make chapter 153 inapplicable to pending cases, the simplest way to do so would be to say so. But, if Congress wasinstead concerned that courts would interpret chapter 154,

because of its contingent nature, as not applying to pendingcases, the most direct way to solve that concern would be
the solution it adopted: expressly stating that chapter 154did indeed apply to pending cases.

The Court finds additional support for its inference in the
new 28 U. S. C. $ 2264(b) (1994 ed., Supp. II), which it believes "tends to confirm," ante, at 332, its analysis. Section
2264 is part of chapter 154 and forbids (subject to narrow
exceptions) federal district courts to consider claims raised
by state capital defendants unless those claims were first
raised and decided on the merits in state court. Section
2264(b) provides, "[f]ollowing review subject to subsections
(a), (d), and (e) of section 2254 [contained within chapter 153],
the court shall rule on the claims properly before it." This
section, I believe, is irrelevant to the question before us.

The Court's somewhat tortured interpretation of this section, as a backhanded way of making $$ 2254(a), (d), and (e)
(but not the rest of chapter 153) apply to pending cases, is
not convincing. For one thing, $ 2264(b) is not phrased at
all as a timing provision; rather than containing temporal
language applying select sections to pending cases, $ 2264(b)
speaks in present tense, about how review should be conducted under chapter 154. Even more tellingly, as the
Court implicitly concedes when it blandly describes this provision as a "loose end," ante, at 336, the AEDPA did not
alter $ 2254(a), and so there is no need for an express provision making it applicable to pending cases.

Chapter 154 establishes special procedures for capital
prisoners. Section 2264(b), by its terms, makes clear that

521US1 Unit: $U81 [11-30-99 19:32:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN
340 LINDH v. MURPHY

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting

$$ 2254(a), (d), and (e) apply to chapter 154 proceedings. Thatclarification makes sense in light of $ 2264(a), which replaces

the exhaustion requirement of $$ 2254(b) and (c) with a re-quirement that federal courts consider (subject to narrow
exceptions) only those claims "raised and decided on the mer-its in the State courts." Without that clarification, doubt
might exist as to whether the rest of $ 2254 still applied incapital proceedings.

Petitioner protests that to read $ 2264(a) as supplanting$$ 2254(b) and (c) would produce "outlandish" results, Brief
for Petitioner 26, a conclusion that the Court finds plausible,
ante, at 333-334, and n. 7 (although it ultimately assumesotherwise). The result would have to be "outlandish," indeed, before a court should refuse to apply the language cho-sen by Congress, but no such result would obtain here.
Petitioner and the Court both fail to appreciate the differentlitigating incentives facing capital and noncapital defendants.
Noncapital defendants, serving criminal sentences in prison,file habeas petitions seeking to be released, presumably as
soon as possible. They have no incentive to delay. In suchcircumstances, $$ 2254(b) and (c) quite reasonably require
that their habeas claims be filed first in state courts, so thatthe state judicial apparatus may have the first opportunity to
address those claims. In contrast, capital defendants, facingimpending execution, seek to avoid being executed. Their
incentive, therefore, is to utilize every means possible todelay the carrying out of their sentence. It is, therefore, not
at all "outlandish" for Congress to have concluded that insuch circumstances $$ 2254(b) and (c) exhaustion would needlessly prolong capital proceedings and that $ 2264(a)'s re-quirement that a claim have been raised and decided on the
merits in state court was a sufficient protection of States'interests in exhaustion.

At this point the Court's analysis stops. Based on theweak inference from Congress' designation of chapter 154 as

applying to pending cases and a strained reading of $ 2264,the Court concludes that Congress impliedly intended for
chapter 153 not to apply to pending cases. I would go on,
and apply our ordinary retroactivity principles, as Congressno doubt assumed that we would.

First, we have generally applied new procedural rules topending cases.

Landgraf, 511 U. S., at 275; see also Beazell
v. Ohio, 269 U. S. 167, 170-171 (1925); Ex parte Collett, 337U. S. 55, 71 (1949);

Dobbert v. Florida, 432 U. S. 282, 293-294
(1977); Collins v. Youngblood, 497 U. S. 37, 45 (1990). Thisis because "rules of procedure regulate secondary rather than

primary conduct." Landgraf, supra, at 275. Here, the primary conduct occurred when Lindh murdered two people inthe sheriff 's office of the City-County Building in Madison, Wisconsin. Obviously, the AEDPA in no way purports
to regulate that past conduct. Lindh's state-court proceedings constituted secondary conduct. Under our retroactivity

tially based. See Judicial Conference of the United States, Ad Hoc Committee on Federal Habeas Corpus in Capital Cases, Committee Report
and Proposal (Aug. 23, 1989). The Committee's Comment to Proposed

$ 2259 (which tracks the AEDPA's $ 2264) explained as follows: "As far as
new or `unexhausted' claims are concerned, [this section] represents a
change in the exhaustion doctrine as articulated in Rose v. Lundy, 455
U. S. 509 (1982). [This section] bars such claims from consideration unless
one of the . . . exceptions is applicable. The prisoner cannot return to
state court to exhaust even if he would like to do so. On the other hand,
if [an exception] is applicable, the district court is directed to conduct an
evidentiary hearing and to rule on the new claim without first exhausting
state remedies as Rose v. Lundy now requires. Because of the existence
of state procedural default rules, exhaustion is futile in the great majority of cases. It serves the state interest of comity in theory, but in practice it results in delay and undermines the state interest in the finality of
its criminal convictions. The Committee believes that the States would
prefer to see post-conviction litigation go forward in capital cases, even
if that entails a minor subordination of their interest in comity as it is
expressed in the exhaustion doctrine." Id., at 22-23 (emphasis added).

precedents, were his state proceedings in federal court, wewould have then applied existing procedural law, even

though Lindh's primary conduct occurred some time earlier.The federal habeas proceeding at issue here is, in a sense,
tertiary conduct. It is not the actual criminal conduct pro-hibited by law, nor is it the proceeding to determine whether
the defendant in fact committed such conduct. Rather, itis a collateral proceeding that, in effect, attacks the judgment of the prior state proceeding. Section 2254(d), the pre-cise section at issue here, simply alters the standard under
which that prior judgment is evaluated, and is in that senseentirely procedural. Cf.

Horning v. District of Columbia,254 U. S. 135, 139 (1920) (applying newly enacted harmlesserror statute, which changed the standard under which priorjudgments were evaluated, to pending case).

Second, we have usually applied changes in law to prospec-tive forms of relief.

Bonjorno, 494 U. S. 827, 852 (1990) (Scalia, J., concurring).Unlike damages actions, which are "quintessentially backward looking," Landgraf, supra, at 282, the writ of habeascorpus is prospective in nature. Habeas does not compensate for past wrongful incarceration, nor does it punish theState for imposing it. See

Lane v. Williams, 455 U. S. 624,631 (1982). Instead, habeas is a challenge to unlawful custody, and when the writ issues it prevents further illegalcustody. See Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 475, 489, 494
(1973).Finally, we have regularly applied statutes ousting jurisdiction to pending litigation.3 Landgraf, supra, at 274; see

such statutes " `speak to the power of the court rather thanto the rights or obligations of the parties.' " Landgraf,
supra, at 274 (quoting Republic Nat. Bank of Miami v.
United States, 506 U. S. 80, 100 (1992) (Thomas, J., concur-ring)); see also 511 U. S., at 293 (

Scalia, J., concurring injudgment) ("Our jurisdiction cases are explained, I think, by

the fact that the purpose of provisions conferring or elimi-nating jurisdiction is to permit or forbid the exercise of judicial power--so that the relevant event for retroactivity pur-poses is the moment at which that power is sought to be
exercised"). This is the principle most relevant to the caseat hand.

There is a good argument that $ 2254(d) is itself jurisdic-tional. See Brown v. Allen, 344 U. S. 443, 460 (1953) ("Jurisdiction over applications for federal habeas corpus is con-trolled by statute"); Sumner v. Mata, 449 U. S. 539, 547, n. 2

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting

$ 2254(d) ("The district courts shall not enjoin . . .")--is "firstand foremost a vehicle to limit drastically federal district

court jurisdiction to interfere with so important a local con-cern as the collection of taxes" (internal quotation marks
omitted)). But even if it is not jurisdictional, it shares the
most salient characteristic of jurisdictional statutes: Itscommands are addressed to courts rather than to individuals.

Section 2254(d) does not address criminal defendants, oreven state prosecutors; it prescribes or proscribes no private conduct. Instead, it is addressed directly to federalcourts, providing, "[a]n application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court shall not be granted . . . unless . . . ."
(Emphasis added.)

Whether the approach is framed in terms of "retroactive
effect," as the Landgraf majority put it, 511 U. S., at 280, or
in terms of "the relevant activity that the rule regulates,"
as Justice Scalia's concurrence put it, see id., at 291 (opinion concurring in judgment), our longstanding practice of
applying procedural, prospective, and jurisdiction-ousting
statutes to pending cases must play an important part in the
decision. These principles all favor application of $ 2254(d)
to pending cases.

It is a procedural statute, regulating prospective relief,
and addressed directly to federal courts and removing their
power to give such relief in specified circumstances. Our
cases therefore strongly suggest that, absent congressional
direction otherwise, we should apply $ 2254(d) to pending
cases. This is not because of any peculiar characteristic intrinsic to the writ of habeas corpus, but rather because modifications to federal courts' authority to issue the writ are
necessarily of that stripe--procedural, prospective, and addressed to courts. It is therefore not surprising that the
parties have not pointed us to a single case where we have
found a modification in the scope of habeas corpus relief inapplicable to pending cases. To the contrary, respondent and

amici have pointed instead to the uniform body of our casesapplying such changes to all pending cases. This has been

true both of statutory changes in the scope of the writ, see,e. g., Gusik v. Schilder, 340 U. S. 128, 131-133, and n. 4 (1950)
(applying 1948 habeas amendments to pending claims);
Smith v. Yeager, 393 U. S. 122, 124-125 (1968) (per curiam)(applying 1966 habeas amendments to pending claims); Carafas v. LaVallee, 391 U. S. 234, 239 (1968) (same); Felker v.Turpin, 518 U. S. 651 (1996) (applying different section of the
AEDPA to pending case), and of judicial changes, see, e. g.,Stone v. Powell, 428 U. S. 465, 495, n. 38 (1976) (rejecting
petitioner's contention that change in law should apply pro-spectively);

Sumner v. Mata, supra, at 539, 549-551 (apply-ing presumption of correctness of state-court findings of fact

to pending case); Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72 (1977)(applying the cause and prejudice doctrine to pending case);
Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U. S. 619, 638-639 (1993) (apply-ing actual prejudice standard to pending case).

Because the Court's inquiry is incomplete, I believe it hasreached the wrong result in this case. I would affirm the
judgment of the Court of Appeals.

KANSAS v. HENDRICKS
certiorari to the supreme court of kansas
No. 95-1649. Argued December 10, 1996--Decided June 23, 1997*
Kansas' Sexually Violent Predator Act establishes procedures for the civil

commitment of persons who, due to a "mental abnormality" or a "personality disorder," are likely to engage in "predatory acts of sexual violence." Kansas filed a petition under the Act in state court to commit
respondent (and cross-petitioner) Hendricks, who had a long history of
sexually molesting children and was scheduled for release from prison.
The court reserved ruling on Hendricks' challenge to the Act's constitutionality, but granted his request for a jury trial. After Hendricks testified that he agreed with the state physician's diagnosis that he suffers
from pedophilia and is not cured and that he continues to harbor sexual
desires for children that he cannot control when he gets "stressed out,"
the jury determined that he was a sexually violent predator. Finding
that pedophilia qualifies as a mental abnormality under the Act, the
court ordered him committed. On appeal, the State Supreme Court
invalidated the Act on the ground that the precommitment condition
of a "mental abnormality" did not satisfy what it perceived to be the
"substantive" due process requirement that involuntary civil commitment must be predicated on a "mental illness" finding. It did not address Hendricks' ex post facto and double jeopardy claims.

Held:

1. The Act's definition of "mental abnormality" satisfies "substantive"
due process requirements. An individual's constitutionally protected
liberty interest in avoiding physical restraint may be overridden even
in the civil context. Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U. S. 11, 26. This
Court has consistently upheld involuntary commitment statutes that detain people who are unable to control their behavior and thereby pose a
danger to the public health and safety, provided the confinement takes
place pursuant to proper procedures and evidentiary standards. Foucha v. Louisiana, 504 U. S. 71, 80. The Act unambiguously requires a
precommitment finding of dangerousness either to one's self or to others,
and links that finding to a determination that the person suffers from a
"mental abnormality" or "personality disorder." Generally, this Court
has sustained a commitment statute if it couples proof of dangerousness

*Together with No. 95-9075, Hendricks v. Kansas, also on certiorari to
the same court.

Syllabus
with proof of some additional factor, such as a "mental illness" or "mental abnormality," see, e. g., Heller v. Doe, 509 U. S. 312, 314-315, for
these additional requirements serve to limit confinement to those who
suffer from a volitional impairment rendering them dangerous beyond
their control. The Act sets forth comparable criteria with its precommitment requirement of "mental abnormality" or "personality disorder."
Contrary to Hendricks' argument, this Court has never required States
to adopt any particular nomenclature in drafting civil commitment statutes and leaves to the States the task of defining terms of a medical
nature that have legal significance. Cf. Jones v. United States, 463 U. S.
354, 365, n. 13. The legislature is therefore not required to use the
specific term "mental illness" and is free to adopt any similar term.
Pp. 356-360.

2. The Act does not violate the Constitution's double jeopardy prohibition or its ban on ex post facto lawmaking. Pp. 360-371.

(a) The Act does not establish criminal proceedings, and involuntary confinement under it is not punishment. The categorization of a
particular proceeding as civil or criminal is a question of statutory construction. Allen v. Illinois, 478 U. S. 364, 368. Nothing on the face of
the Act suggests that the Kansas Legislature sought to create anything
other than a civil commitment scheme. That manifest intent will be
rejected only if Hendricks provides the clearest proof that the scheme
is so punitive in purpose or effect as to negate Kansas' intention to deem
it civil. United States v. Ward, 448 U. S. 242, 248-249. He has failed
to satisfy this heavy burden. Commitment under the Act does not implicate either of the two primary objectives of criminal punishment: retribution or deterrence. Its purpose is not retributive: It does not affix
culpability for prior criminal conduct, but uses such conduct solely for
evidentiary purposes; it does not make criminal conviction a prerequisite for commitment; and it lacks a scienter requirement, an important
element in distinguishing criminal and civil statutes. Nor can the Act
be said to act as a deterrent, since persons with a mental abnormality
or personality disorder are unlikely to be deterred by the threat of
confinement. The conditions surrounding confinement--essentially the
same as conditions for any civilly committed patient--do not suggest a
punitive purpose. Although the commitment scheme here involves an
affirmative restraint, such restraint of the dangerously mentally ill has
been historically regarded as a legitimate nonpunitive objective. Cf.
United States v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 747. The confinement's potentially indefinite duration is linked, not to any punitive objective, but to
the purpose of holding a person until his mental abnormality no longer
causes him to be a threat to others. He is thus permitted immediate
release upon a showing that he is no longer dangerous, and the longest

Syllabus
he can be detained pursuant to a single judicial proceeding is one year.
The State's use of procedural safeguards applicable in criminal trials
does not itself turn the proceedings into criminal prosecutions. Allen,
supra, at 372. Finally, the Act is not necessarily punitive if it fails to
offer treatment where treatment for a condition is not possible, or if
treatment, though possible, is merely an ancillary, rather than an overriding, state concern. The conclusion that the Act is nonpunitive removes an essential prerequisite for both Hendricks' double jeopardy and
ex post facto claims. Pp. 360-369.

(b) Hendricks' confinement does not amount to a second prosecution
and punishment for the offense for which he was convicted. Because
the Act is civil in nature, its commitment proceedings do not constitute
a second prosecution. Cf. Jones, supra. As this commitment is not
tantamount to punishment, the detention does not violate the Double
Jeopardy Clause, even though it follows a prison term. Baxstrom v.
Herold, 383 U. S. 107. Hendricks' argument that, even if the Act survives the "multiple punishments" test, it fails the "same elements" test
of Blockburger v. United States, 284 U. S. 299, is rejected, since that
test does not apply outside of the successive prosecution context.
Pp. 369-370.

(c) Hendricks' ex post facto claim is similarly flawed. The Ex Post
Facto Clause pertains exclusively to penal statutes. California Dept.
of Corrections v. Morales, 514 U. S. 499, 505. Since the Act is not
punishment, its application does not raise ex post facto concerns.
Moreover, the Act clearly does not have retroactive effect. It does not
criminalize conduct legal before its enactment or deprive Hendricks
of any defense that was available to him at the time of his crimes.

350 KANSAS v. HENDRICKS

Opinion of the Court
Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.
In 1994, Kansas enacted the Sexually Violent PredatorAct, which establishes procedures for the civil commitment

of persons who, due to a "mental abnormality" or a "person-ality disorder," are likely to engage in "predatory acts of
sexual violence." Kan. Stat. Ann. $ 59-29a01 et seq. (1994).The State invoked the Act for the first time to commit Leroy
Hendricks, an inmate who had a long history of sexually mo-lesting children, and who was scheduled for release from
prison shortly after the Act became law. Hendricks chal-lenged his commitment on, inter alia, "substantive" due
process, double jeopardy, and ex post facto grounds. TheKansas Supreme Court invalidated the Act, holding that its
precommitment condition of a "mental abnormality" did notsatisfy what the court perceived to be the "substantive" due
process requirement that involuntary civil commitment mustbe predicated on a finding of "mental illness."

In re Hen-dricks, 259 Kan. 246, 261, 912 P. 2d 129, 138 (1996). The

State of Kansas petitioned for certiorari. Hendricks subse-quently filed a cross-petition in which he reasserted his federal double jeopardy and ex post facto claims. We grantedcertiorari on both the petition and the cross-petition, 518
U. S. 1004 (1996), and now reverse the judgment below.

Opinion of the Court
ready had a statute addressing the involuntary commitment
of those defined as "mentally ill," the legislature determined
that existing civil commitment procedures were inadequate
to confront the risks presented by "sexually violent predators." In the Act's preamble, the legislature explained:

"[A] small but extremely dangerous group of sexually
violent predators exist who do not have a mental disease
or defect that renders them appropriate for involuntary
treatment pursuant to the [general involuntary civil
commitment statute] . . . . In contrast to persons appropriate for civil commitment under the [general involuntary civil commitment statute], sexually violent predators generally have anti-social personality features
which are unamenable to existing mental illness treatment modalities and those features render them likely
to engage in sexually violent behavior. The legislature
further finds that sexually violent predators' likelihood
of engaging in repeat acts of predatory sexual violence
is high. The existing involuntary commitment procedure . . . is inadequate to address the risk these sexually
violent predators pose to society. The legislature further finds that the prognosis for rehabilitating sexually
violent predators in a prison setting is poor, the treatment needs of this population are very long term and
the treatment modalities for this population are very
different than the traditional treatment modalities for
people appropriate for commitment under the [general
involuntary civil commitment statute]." Kan. Stat.
Ann. $ 59-29a01 (1994).

As a result, the legislature found it necessary to establish
"a civil commitment procedure for the long-term care and

Ann. $ 59-29a03 (Supp. 1996) (changing notification period from 60 to 90
days); $ 59-29a04 (requiring state attorney general to initiate commitment proceedings).

Opinion of the Court
treatment of the sexually violent predator." Ibid. The Actdefined a "sexually violent predator" as:

"any person who has been convicted of or charged witha sexually violent offense and who suffers from a mental
abnormality or personality disorder which makes theperson likely to engage in the predatory acts of sexual
violence." $ 59-29a02(a).
A "mental abnormality" was defined, in turn, as a "congenital or acquired condition affecting the emotional or volitionalcapacity which predisposes the person to commit sexually

violent offenses in a degree constituting such person a men-ace to the health and safety of others." $ 59-29a02(b).

As originally structured, the Act's civil commitment proce-dures pertained to: (1) a presently confined person who, like
Hendricks, "has been convicted of a sexually violent offense"
and is scheduled for release; (2) a person who has been"charged with a sexually violent offense" but has been found

incompetent to stand trial; (3) a person who has been found"not guilty by reason of insanity of a sexually violent offense"; and (4) a person found "not guilty" of a sexually vio-lent offense because of a mental disease or defect. $ 59-
29a03(a), $ 22-3221 (1995).The initial version of the Act, as applied to a currently
confined person such as Hendricks, was designed to initiate
a specific series of procedures. The custodial agency wasrequired to notify the local prosecutor 60 days before the

anticipated release of a person who might have met the Act'scriteria. $ 59-29a03. The prosecutor was then obligated,
within 45 days, to decide whether to file a petition in statecourt seeking the person's involuntary commitment. $ 59-
29a04. If such a petition were filed, the court was to deter-mine whether "probable cause" existed to support a finding
that the person was a "sexually violent predator" and thus
eligible for civil commitment. Upon such a determination,transfer of the individual to a secure facility for professional

evaluation would occur. $ 59-29a05. After that evaluation,

353Cite as: 521 U. S. 346 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
a trial would be held to determine beyond a reasonable doubtwhether the individual was a sexually violent predator. If

that determination were made, the person would then betransferred to the custody of the Secretary of Social and Rehabilitation Services (Secretary) for "control, care and treat-ment until such time as the person's mental abnormality or
personality disorder has so changed that the person is safeto be at large." $ 59-29a07(a).

In addition to placing the burden of proof upon the State,the Act afforded the individual a number of other procedural
safeguards. In the case of an indigent person, the Statewas required to provide, at public expense, the assistance of
counsel and an examination by mental health care profes-sionals. $ 59-29a06. The individual also received the right
to present and cross-examine witnesses, and the opportun-ity to review documentary evidence presented by the State.

$ 59-29a07.Once an individual was confined, the Act required that
"[t]he involuntary detention or commitment . . . shall con-form to constitutional requirements for care and treatment."

$ 59-29a09. Confined persons were afforded three differentavenues of review: First, the committing court was obligated
to conduct an annual review to determine whether continueddetention was warranted. $ 59-29a08. Second, the Secretary was permitted, at any time, to decide that the confinedindividual's condition had so changed that release was appropriate, and could then authorize the person to petition forrelease. $ 59-29a10. Finally, even without the Secretary's
permission, the confined person could at any time file a re-lease petition. $ 59-29a11. If the court found that the
State could no longer satisfy its burden under the initialcommitment standard, the individual would be freed from
confinement. B

In 1984, Hendricks was convicted of taking "indecent liber-ties" with two 13-year-old boys. After serving nearly 10
years of his sentence, he was slated for release to a halfway

354 KANSAS v. HENDRICKS

Opinion of the Court
house. Shortly before his scheduled release, however, theState filed a petition in state court seeking Hendricks' civil

confinement as a sexually violent predator. On August 19,1994, Hendricks appeared before the court with counsel and
moved to dismiss the petition on the grounds that the Act
violated various federal constitutional provisions. Althoughthe court reserved ruling on the Act's constitutionality, it

concluded that there was probable cause to support a findingthat Hendricks was a sexually violent predator, and therefore ordered that he be evaluated at the Larned State Secu-rity Hospital.

Hendricks subsequently requested a jury trial to deter-mine whether he qualified as a sexually violent predator.
During that trial, Hendricks' own testimony revealed a chilling history of repeated child sexual molestation and abuse,beginning in 1955 when he exposed his genitals to two young

girls. At that time, he pleaded guilty to indecent exposure.Then, in 1957, he was convicted of lewdness involving a
young girl and received a brief jail sentence. In 1960, hemolested two young boys while he worked for a carnival.
After serving two years in prison for that offense, he wasparoled, only to be rearrested for molesting a 7-year-old girl.
Attempts were made to treat him for his sexual deviance,
and in 1965 he was considered "safe to be at large," and was
discharged from a state psychiatric hospital. App. 139-144.

Shortly thereafter, however, Hendricks sexually assaulted
another young boy and girl--he performed oral sex on the
8-year-old girl and fondled the 11-year-old boy. He was
again imprisoned in 1967, but refused to participate in a sex
offender treatment program, and thus remained incarcerated
until his parole in 1972. Diagnosed as a pedophile, Hendricks entered into, but then abandoned, a treatment program. He testified that despite having received professional help for his pedophilia, he continued to harbor sexual
desires for children. Indeed, soon after his 1972 parole,
Hendricks began to abuse his own stepdaughter and stepson.
He forced the children to engage in sexual activity with him

over a period of approximately four years. Then, as notedabove, Hendricks was convicted of "taking indecent liberties" with two adolescent boys after he attempted to fondlethem. As a result of that conviction, he was once again imprisoned, and was serving that sentence when he reached hisconditional release date in September 1994.

Hendricks admitted that he had repeatedly abused chil-dren whenever he was not confined. He explained that
when he "get[s] stressed out," he "can't control the urge" tomolest children.

Id., at 172. Although Hendricks recog-nized that his behavior harms children, and he hoped he

would not sexually molest children again, he stated that theonly sure way he could keep from sexually abusing children
in the future was "to die." Id., at 190. Hendricks readilyagreed with the state physician's diagnosis that he suffers
from pedophilia and that he is not cured of the condition;indeed, he told the physician that "treatment is bull----."
Id., at 153, 190.2The jury unanimously found beyond a reasonable doubt
that Hendricks was a sexually violent predator. The trialcourt subsequently determined, as a matter of state law, that
pedophilia qualifies as a "mental abnormality" as defined by

their repeated sexual abuse at Hendricks' hands. App. 194-212. One of
the girls to whom Hendricks exposed himself in 1955 testified as well.
Id., at 191-194. The State also presented testimony from Lester Lee,
a licensed clinical social worker who specialized in treating male sexual
offenders, and Dr. Charles Befort, the chief psychologist at Larned State
Hospital. Lee testified that Hendricks had a diagnosis of personality trait
disturbance, passive-aggressive personality, and pedophilia. Id., at 219-
220. Dr. Befort testified that Hendricks suffered from pedophilia and is
likely to commit sexual offenses against children in the future if not confined. Id., at 247-248. He further opined that pedophilia qualifies as a
"mental abnormality" within the Act's definition of that term. Id., at 263-
264. Finally, Hendricks offered testimony from Dr. William S. Logan, a
forensic psychiatrist, who stated that it was not possible to predict with
any degree of accuracy the future dangerousness of a sex offender. Id.,

the Act, and thus ordered Hendricks committed to the Secre-tary's custody.

Hendricks appealed, claiming, among other things, thatapplication of the Act to him violated the Federal Constitution's Due Process, Double Jeopardy, and Ex Post Facto
Clauses. The Kansas Supreme Court accepted Hendricks'due process claim. 259 Kan., at 261, 912 P. 2d, at 138. The

court declared that in order to commit a person involuntarilyin a civil proceeding, a State is required by "substantive"
due process to prove by clear and convincing evidence thatthe person is both (1) mentally ill, and (2) a danger to himself
or to others. Id., at 259, 912 P. 2d, at 137. The court thendetermined that the Act's definition of "mental abnormality"
did not satisfy what it perceived to be this Court's "mental
illness" requirement in the civil commitment context. As aresult, the court held that "the Act violates Hendricks' substantive due process rights." Id., at 261, 912 P. 2d, at 138.The majority did not address Hendricks'

ex post facto or
double jeopardy claims. The dissent, however, consideredeach of Hendricks' constitutional arguments and rejected

them. Id., at 264-294, 912 P. 2d, 140-156 (Larson, J.,dissenting).

A

Kansas argues that the Act's definition of "mental abnor-mality" satisfies "substantive" due process requirements.

We agree. Although freedom from physical restraint "hasalways been at the core of the liberty protected by the Due
Process Clause from arbitrary governmental action," Foucha
v. Louisiana, 504 U. S. 71, 80 (1992), that liberty interest is
not absolute. The Court has recognized that an individual's
constitutionally protected interest in avoiding physical restraint may be overridden even in the civil context:

"[T]he liberty secured by the Constitution of the United
States to every person within its jurisdiction does not

Opinion of the Court
import an absolute right in each person to be, at alltimes and in all circumstances, wholly free from restraint. There are manifold restraints to which everyperson is necessarily subject for the common good. On
any other basis organized society could not exist withsafety to its members."

Jacobson v. Massachusetts,197 U. S. 11, 26 (1905).

Accordingly, States have in certain narrow circumstancesprovided for the forcible civil detainment of people who are
unable to control their behavior and who thereby pose a dan-ger to the public health and safety. See, e. g., 1788 N. Y.
Laws, ch. 31 (Feb. 9, 1788) (permitting confinement of the"furiously mad"); see also A. Deutsch, The Mentally Ill in
America (1949) (tracing history of civil commitment in the18th and 19th centuries); G. Grob, Mental Institutions in
America: Social Policy to 1875 (1973) (discussing colonial andearly American civil commitment statutes). We have consistently upheld such involuntary commitment statutes pro-vided the confinement takes place pursuant to proper procedures and evidentiary standards. See Foucha, supra, at 80;
Addington v. Texas, 441 U. S. 418, 426-427 (1979). It thuscannot be said that the involuntary civil confinement of

a limited subclass of dangerous persons is contrary to ourunderstanding of ordered liberty. Cf.

id., at 426.The challenged Act unambiguously requires a finding of

dangerousness either to one's self or to others as a prerequi-site to involuntary confinement. Commitment proceedings
can be initiated only when a person "has been convicted ofor charged with a sexually violent offense," and "suffers from
a mental abnormality or personality disorder which makesthe person likely to engage in the predatory acts of sexual
violence." Kan. Stat. Ann. $ 59-29a02(a) (1994). The stat-ute thus requires proof of more than a mere predisposition to
violence; rather, it requires evidence of past sexually violentbehavior and a present mental condition that creates a likelihood of such conduct in the future if the person is not inca521US1 Unit: $U82 [11-18-99 20:29:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
pacitated. As we have recognized, "[p]revious instances ofviolent behavior are an important indicator of future violent

tendencies." Heller v. Doe, 509 U. S. 312, 323 (1993); see also
Schall v. Martin, 467 U. S. 253, 278 (1984) (explaining that
"from a legal point of view there is nothing inherently unattainable about a prediction of future criminal conduct").A finding of dangerousness, standing alone, is ordinarily

not a sufficient ground upon which to justify indefinite invol-untary commitment. We have sustained civil commitment
statutes when they have coupled proof of dangerousnesswith the proof of some additional factor, such as a "mental
illness" or "mental abnormality." See, e. g., Heller, supra,at 314-315 (Kentucky statute permitting commitment of
"mentally retarded" or "mentally ill" and dangerous individual); Allen v. Illinois, 478 U. S. 364, 366 (1986) (Illinois statutepermitting commitment of "mentally ill" and dangerous individual); Minnesota ex rel. Pearson v. Probate Court of Ramsey Cty., 309 U. S. 270, 271-272 (1940) (Minnesota statute
permitting commitment of dangerous individual with "psy-chopathic personality"). These added statutory requirements serve to limit involuntary civil confinement to thosewho suffer from a volitional impairment rendering them
dangerous beyond their control. The Kansas Act is plainly
of a kind with these other civil commitment statutes: It requires a finding of future dangerousness, and then links that
finding to the existence of a "mental abnormality" or "personality disorder" that makes it difficult, if not impossible,
for the person to control his dangerous behavior. Kan. Stat.
Ann. $ 59-29a02(b) (1994). The precommitment requirement of a "mental abnormality" or "personality disorder" is
consistent with the requirements of these other statutes that
we have upheld in that it narrows the class of persons eligible for confinement to those who are unable to control their
dangerousness.

Hendricks nonetheless argues that our earlier cases dictate a finding of "mental illness" as a prerequisite for civil
commitment, citing Foucha and Addington. He then as521US1 Unit: $U82 [11-18-99 20:29:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN

359Cite as: 521 U. S. 346 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
serts that a "mental abnormality" is not equivalent to a
"mental illness" because it is a term coined by the Kansas
Legislature, rather than by the psychiatric community.
Contrary to Hendricks' assertion, the term "mental illness"
is devoid of any talismanic significance. Not only do "psychiatrists disagree widely and frequently on what constitutes
mental illness," Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U. S. 68, 81 (1985), but
the Court itself has used a variety of expressions to describe
the mental condition of those properly subject to civil confinement. See, e. g., Addington, supra, at 425-426 (using
the terms "emotionally disturbed" and "mentally ill"); Jackson v. Indiana, 406 U. S. 715, 732, 737 (1972) (using the terms
"incompetency" and "insanity"); cf. Foucha, 504 U. S., at 88
(O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (acknowledging State's authority to commit a person
when there is "some medical justification for doing so").

Indeed, we have never required state legislatures to adopt
any particular nomenclature in drafting civil commitment
statutes. Rather, we have traditionally left to legislators
the task of defining terms of a medical nature that have legal
significance. Cf. Jones v. United States, 463 U. S. 354, 365,
n. 13 (1983). As a consequence, the States have, over the
years, developed numerous specialized terms to define mental health concepts. Often, those definitions do not fit precisely with the definitions employed by the medical community. The legal definitions of "insanity" and "competency,"
for example, vary substantially from their psychiatric counterparts. See, e. g., Gerard, The Usefulness of the Medical
Model to the Legal System, 39 Rutgers L. Rev. 377, 391-

394 (1987) (discussing differing purposes of legal system and
the medical profession in recognizing mental illness). Legal
definitions, however, which must "take into account such
issues as individual responsibility . . . and competency,"
need not mirror those advanced by the medical profession.

Manual of Mental Disorders xxiii, xxvii (4th ed. 1994).

360 KANSAS v. HENDRICKS

Opinion of the Court
To the extent that the civil commitment statutes we haveconsidered set forth criteria relating to an individual's inability to control his dangerousness, the Kansas Act sets forthcomparable criteria and Hendricks' condition doubtless satisfies those criteria. The mental health professionals whoevaluated Hendricks diagnosed him as suffering from pedophilia, a condition the psychiatric profession itself classifiesas a serious mental disorder. See,

e. g., id., at 524-525, 527-528; 1 American Psychiatric Association, Treatments of Psychiatric Disorders 617-633 (1989); Abel & Rouleau, Male SexOffenders, in Handbook of Outpatient Treatment of Adults
271 (M. Thase, B. Edelstein, & M. Hersen eds. 1990).3 Hen-dricks even conceded that, when he becomes "stressed out,"
he cannot "control the urge" to molest children. App. 172.This admitted lack of volitional control, coupled with a prediction of future dangerousness, adequately distinguishesHendricks from other dangerous persons who are perhaps
more properly dealt with exclusively through criminal pro-ceedings. Hendricks' diagnosis as a pedophile, which qualifies as a "mental abnormality" under the Act, thus plainlysuffices for due process purposes.

B
We granted Hendricks' cross-petiti on to determinewhether the Act violates the Constitution's double jeopardy

3 We recognize, of course, that psychiatric professionals are not in complete harmony in casting pedophilia, or paraphilias in general, as "mental
illnesses." Compare Brief for American Psychiatric Association as Amicus Curiae 26 with Brief for Menninger Foundation et al. as Amici Curiae
22-25. These disagreements, however, do not tie the State's hands in
setting the bounds of its civil commitment laws. In fact, it is precisely
where such disagreement exists that legislatures have been afforded the
widest latitude in drafting such statutes. Cf. Jones v. United States, 463
U. S. 354, 365, n. 13 (1983). As we have explained regarding congressional
enactments, when a legislature "undertakes to act in areas fraught with
medical and scientific uncertainties, legislative options must be especially
broad and courts should be cautious not to rewrite legislation." Id., at
370 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).

Opinion of the Court
prohibition or its ban on ex post facto lawmaking. Thethrust of Hendricks' argument is that the Act establishes

criminal proceedings; hence confinement under it necessarilyconstitutes punishment. He contends that where, as here,
newly enacted "punishment" is predicated upon past conduct
for which he has already been convicted and forced to servea prison sentence, the Constitution's Double Jeopardy and

Ex Post Facto Clauses are violated. We are unpersuadedby Hendricks' argument that Kansas has established criminal proceedings.The categorization of a particular proceeding as civil or
criminal "is first of all a question of statutory construction."
Allen, 478 U. S., at 368. We must initially ascertain whether
the legislature meant the statute to establish "civil" proceedings. If so, we ordinarily defer to the legislature's stated
intent. Here, Kansas' objective to create a civil proceeding
is evidenced by its placement of the Act within the Kansas
probate code, Kan. Stat. Ann., Art. 29 (1994) ("Care and
Treatment for Mentally Ill Persons"), instead of the criminal code, as well as its description of the Act as creating a
"civil commitment procedure," $ 59-29a01 (emphasis added).
Nothing on the face of the statute suggests that the legislature sought to create anything other than a civil commitment
scheme designed to protect the public from harm.

Although we recognize that a "civil label is not always dispositive," Allen, supra, at 369, we will reject the legislature's
manifest intent only where a party challenging the statute
provides "the clearest proof " that "the statutory scheme [is]
so punitive either in purpose or effect as to negate [the
State's] intention" to deem it "civil," United States v. Ward,
448 U. S. 242, 248-249 (1980). In those limited circumstances, we will consider the statute to have established
criminal proceedings for constitutional purposes. Hendricks, however, has failed to satisfy this heavy burden.

As a threshold matter, commitment under the Act does not
implicate either of the two primary objectives of criminal

521US1 Unit: $U82 [11-18-99 20:29:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN
362 KANSAS v. HENDRICKS

Opinion of the Court
punishment: retribution or deterrence. The Act's purpose isnot retributive because it does not affix culpability for prior

criminal conduct. Instead, such conduct is used solely forevidentiary purposes, either to demonstrate that a "mental
abnormality" exists or to support a finding of future dangerousness. We have previously concluded that an Illinois stat-ute was nonpunitive even though it was triggered by the

commission of a sexual assault, explaining that evidence ofthe prior criminal conduct was "received not to punish past
misdeeds, but primarily to show the accused's mental condi-tion and to predict future behavior."

Allen, supra, at 371.
In addition, the Kansas Act does not make a criminal conviction a prerequisite for commitment--persons absolved of
criminal responsibility may nonetheless be subject to confinement under the Act. See Kan. Stat. Ann. $ 59-29a03(a)
(1994). An absence of the necessary criminal responsibility
suggests that the State is not seeking retribution for a past
misdeed. Thus, the fact that the Act may be "tied to criminal activity" is "insufficient to render the statut[e] punitive."
United States v. Ursery, 518 U. S. 267 (1996).

Moreover, unlike a criminal statute, no finding of scienter
is required to commit an individual who is found to be a sexually violent predator; instead, the commitment determination
is made based on a "mental abnormality" or "personality disorder" rather than on one's criminal intent. The existence
of a scienter requirement is customarily an important element in distinguishing criminal from civil statutes. See
Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U. S. 144, 168 (1963).
The absence of such a requirement here is evidence that confinement under the statute is not intended to be retributive.

Nor can it be said that the legislature intended the Act to
function as a deterrent. Those persons committed under
the Act are, by definition, suffering from a "mental abnormality" or a "personality disorder" that prevents them from
exercising adequate control over their behavior. Such persons are therefore unlikely to be deterred by the threat of

521US1 Unit: $U82 [11-18-99 20:29:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN

363Cite as: 521 U. S. 346 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
confinement. And the conditions surrounding that con-finement do not suggest a punitive purpose on the State's

part. The State has represented that an individual confinedunder the Act is not subject to the more restrictive conditions placed on state prisoners, but instead experiences essentially the same conditions as any involuntarily committedpatient in the state mental institution. App. 50-56, 59-60.

Because none of the parties argues that people institutional-ized under the Kansas general civil commitment statute are
subject to punitive conditions, even though they may be in-voluntarily confined, it is difficult to conclude that persons
confined under this Act are being "punished."

Although the civil commitment scheme at issue here does
involve an affirmative restraint, "the mere fact that a person
is detained does not inexorably lead to the conclusion that
the government has imposed punishment." United States
v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 746 (1987). The State may take
measures to restrict the freedom of the dangerously mentally ill. This is a legitimate nonpunitive governmental objective and has been historically so regarded. Cf. id., at 747.
The Court has, in fact, cited the confinement of "mentally
unstable individuals who present a danger to the public" as
one classic example of nonpunitive detention. Id., at 748-
749. If detention for the purpose of protecting the community from harm necessarily constituted punishment, then all
involuntary civil commitments would have to be considered
punishment. But we have never so held.

Hendricks focuses on his confinement's potentially indefinite duration as evidence of the State's punitive intent.
That focus, however, is misplaced. Far from any punitive
objective, the confinement's duration is instead linked to the
stated purposes of the commitment, namely, to hold the person until his mental abnormality no longer causes him to be
a threat to others. Cf. Jones, 463 U. S., at 368 (noting with
approval that "because it is impossible to predict how long
it will take for any given individual to recover [from insan521US1 Unit: $U82 [11-18-99 20:29:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN
364 KANSAS v. HENDRICKS

Opinion of the Court
ity]--or indeed whether he will ever recover--Congress has
chosen . . . to leave the length of commitment indeterminate,
subject to periodic review of the patient's suitability for release"). If, at any time, the confined person is adjudged
"safe to be at large," he is statutorily entitled to immediate
release. Kan. Stat. Ann. $ 59-29a07 (1994).

Furthermore, commitment under the Act is only potentially indefinite. The maximum amount of time an individual can be incapacitated pursuant to a single judicial proceeding is one year. $ 59-29a08. If Kansas seeks to continue
the detention beyond that year, a court must once again determine beyond a reasonable doubt that the detainee satisfies the same standards as required for the initial confinement. Ibid. This requirement again demonstrates that
Kansas does not intend an individual committed pursuant to
the Act to remain confined any longer than he suffers from
a mental abnormality rendering him unable to control his
dangerousness.

Hendricks next contends that the State's use of procedural
safeguards traditionally found in criminal trials makes the
proceedings here criminal rather than civil. In Allen, we
confronted a similar argument. There, the petitioner
"place[d] great reliance on the fact that proceedings under
the Act are accompanied by procedural safeguards usually
found in criminal trials" to argue that the proceedings were
civil in name only. 478 U. S., at 371. We rejected that argument, however, explaining that the State's decision "to
provide some of the safeguards applicable in criminal trials
cannot itself turn these proceedings into criminal prosecutions." Id., at 372. The numerous procedural and evidentiary protections afforded here demonstrate that the Kansas
Legislature has taken great care to confine only a narrow
class of particularly dangerous individuals, and then only
after meeting the strictest procedural standards. That
Kansas chose to afford such procedural protections does not

Opinion of the Court
transform a civil commitment proceeding into a criminalprosecution.

Finally, Hendricks argues that the Act is necessarily pu-nitive because it fails to offer any legitimate "treatment."
Without such treatment, Hendricks asserts, confinementunder the Act amounts to little more than disguised punishment. Hendricks' argument assumes that treatment for hiscondition is available, but that the State has failed (or refused) to provide it. The Kansas Supreme Court, however,apparently rejected this assumption, explaining:

"It is clear that the overriding concern of the legisla-ture is to continue the segregation of sexually violent
offenders from the public. Treatment with the goal ofreintegrating them into society is incidental, at best.
The record reflects that treatment for sexually violent
predators is all but nonexistent. The legislature concedes that sexually violent predators are not amenableto treatment under [the existing Kansas involuntary

commitment statute]. If there is nothing to treat under[that statute], then there is no mental illness. In that
light, the provisions of the Act for treatment appearsomewhat disingenuous." 259 Kan., at 258, 912 P. 2d,
at 136.
It is possible to read this passage as a determination that
Hendricks' condition was untreatable under the existingKansas civil commitment statute, and thus the Act's sole purpose was incapacitation. Absent a treatable mental illness,the Kansas court concluded, Hendricks could not be detained
against his will.Accepting the Kansas court's apparent determination that
treatment is not possible for this category of individuals does
not obligate us to adopt its legal conclusions. We have al-ready observed that, under the appropriate circumstances

and when accompanied by proper procedures, incapacitation

521US1 Unit: $U82 [11-18-99 20:29:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN
366 KANSAS v. HENDRICKS

Opinion of the Court
may be a legitimate end of the civil law. See Allen, supra,at 373;

Salerno, 481 U. S., at 748-749. Accordingly, the Kansas court's determination that the Act's "overriding concern"was the continued "segregation of sexually violent offenders"

is consistent with our conclusion that the Act establishes civil
proceedings, 259 Kan., at 258, 912 P. 2d, at 136, especiallywhen that concern is coupled with the State's ancillary goal

of providing treatment to those offenders, if such is possible.While we have upheld state civil commitment statutes that
aim both to incapacitate and to treat, see Allen, supra, wehave never held that the Constitution prevents a State from
civilly detaining those for whom no treatment is available,
but who nevertheless pose a danger to others. A State
could hardly be seen as furthering a "punitive" purpose by
involuntarily confining persons afflicted with an untreatable,
highly contagious disease. Accord, Compagnie Francaise
de Navigation a Vapeur v. Louisiana Bd. of Health, 186
U. S. 380 (1902) (permitting involuntary quarantine of persons suffering from communicable diseases). Similarly, it
would be of little value to require treatment as a precondition for civil confinement of the dangerously insane when
no acceptable treatment existed. To conclude otherwise
would obligate a State to release certain confined individuals
who were both mentally ill and dangerous simply because
they could not be successfully treated for their afflictions.
Cf. Greenwood v. United States, 350 U. S. 366, 375 (1956)
("The fact that at present there may be little likelihood of
recovery does not defeat federal power to make this initial
commitment of the petitioner"); O'Connor v. Donaldson, 422
U. S. 563, 584 (1975) (Burger, C. J., concurring) ("[I]t remains
a stubborn fact that there are many forms of mental illness
which are not understood, some which are untreatable in the
sense that no effective therapy has yet been discovered for
them, and that rates of `cure' are generally low").

Alternatively, the Kansas Supreme Court's opinion can be
read to conclude that Hendricks' condition is treatable, but

521US1 Unit: $U82 [11-18-99 20:29:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN

367Cite as: 521 U. S. 346 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
that treatment was not the State's "overriding concern," andthat no treatment was being provided (at least at the time

Hendricks was committed). 259 Kan., at 258, 912 P. 2d, at136. See also

ibid. ("It is clear that the primary objective
of the Act is to continue incarceration and not to provide
treatment"). Even if we accept this determination that theprovision of treatment was not the Kansas Legislature's

"overriding" or "primary" purpose in passing the Act, thisdoes not rule out the possibility that an ancillary purpose of
the Act was to provide treatment, and it does not require usto conclude that the Act is punitive. Indeed, critical language in the Act itself demonstrates that the Secretary,
under whose custody sexually violent predators are committed, has an obligation to provide treatment to individuals
like Hendricks. $ 59-29a07(a) ("If the court or jury determines that the person is a sexually violent predator, the
person shall be committed to the custody of the secretary
of social and rehabilitation services for control, care and
treatment until such time as the person's mental abnormality
or personality disorder has so changed that the person is safe
to be at large" (emphasis added)). Other of the Act's sections echo this obligation to provide treatment for committed
persons. See, e. g., $ 59-29a01 (establishing civil commitment procedure "for the long-term care and treatment of
the sexually violent predator"); $ 59-29a09 (requiring the
confinement to "conform to constitutional requirements for
care and treatment"). Thus, as in Allen, "the State has a
statutory obligation to provide `care and treatment for
[persons adjudged sexually dangerous] designed to effect
recovery,' " 478 U. S., at 369 (quoting Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 38,
|| 105-8 (1985)), and we may therefore conclude that "the
State has . . . provided for the treatment of those it commits,"
478 U. S., at 370.

Although the treatment program initially offered Hendricks may have seemed somewhat meager, it must be remembered that he was the first person committed under the

368 KANSAS v. HENDRICKS

Opinion of the Court
Act. That the State did not have all of its treatment procedures in place is thus not surprising. What is significant,
however, is that Hendricks was placed under the supervision
of the Kansas Department of Health and Social and Rehabilitative Services, housed in a unit segregated from the
general prison population and operated not by employees
of the Department of Corrections, but by other trained individuals.4 And, before this Court, Kansas declared "[a]bsolutely" that persons committed under the Act are now
receiving in the neighborhood of "31-1/2 hours of treatment
per week." Tr. of Oral Arg. 14-15, 16.5

Where the State has "disavowed any punitive intent"; limited confinement to a small segment of particularly dangerous individuals; provided strict procedural safeguards; directed that confined persons be segregated from the general
prison population and afforded the same status as others who
have been civilly committed; recommended treatment if such
is possible; and permitted immediate release upon a showing

4 We have explained that the States enjoy wide latitude in developing
treatment regimens. Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U. S. 307, 317 (1982) (observing that the State "has considerable discretion in determining the nature and scope of its responsibilities"). In Allen v. Illinois, 478 U. S. 364
(1986), for example, we concluded that "the State serves its purpose of
treating rather than punishing sexually dangerous persons by committing
them to an institution expressly designed to provide psychiatric care and
treatment." Id., at 373 (emphasis deleted). By this measure, Kansas has
doubtless satisfied its obligation to provide available treatment.

5 Indeed, we have been informed that in an August 28, 1995, hearing on

Hendricks' petition for state habeas corpus relief, the trial court, over
admittedly conflicting testimony, ruled: "[T]he allegation that no treatment is being provided to any of the petitioners or other persons committed to the program designated as a sexual predator treatment program
is not true. I find that they are receiving treatment." App. 453-454.
Thus, to the extent that treatment is available for Hendricks' condition,
the State now appears to be providing it. By furnishing such treatment,
the Kansas Legislature has indicated that treatment, if possible, is at least
an ancillary goal of the Act, which easily satisfies any test for determining
that the Act is not punitive.

therefore hold that the Act does not establish criminal pro-ceedings and that involuntary confinement pursuant to the
Act is not punitive. Our conclusion that the Act is nonpuni-tive thus removes an essential prerequisite for both Hendricks' double jeopardy and ex post facto claims.

1
The Double Jeopardy Clause provides: "[N]or shall anyperson be subject for the same offence to be twice put in

jeopardy of life or limb." Although generally understood topreclude a second prosecution for the same offense, the
Court has also interpreted this prohibition to prevent theState from "punishing twice, or attempting a second time to
punish criminally, for the same offense." Witte v. United
States, 515 U. S. 389, 396 (1995) (emphasis and internal quota-tion marks omitted). Hendricks argues that, as applied to

him, the Act violates double jeopardy principles because hisconfinement under the Act, imposed after a conviction and a
term of incarceration, amounted to both a second prosecutionand a second punishment for the same offense. We disagree.

Because we have determined that the Kansas Act is civilin nature, initiation of its commitment proceedings does not
constitute a second prosecution. Cf. Jones v. United States,463 U. S. 354 (1983) (permitting involuntary civil commitment after verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity).Moreover, as commitment under the Act is not tantamount
to "punishment," Hendricks' involuntary detention does notviolate the Double Jeopardy Clause, even though that confinement may follow a prison term. Indeed, in Baxstrom v.Herold, 383 U. S. 107 (1966), we expressly recognized that
civil commitment could follow the expiration of a prison termwithout offending double jeopardy principles. We reasoned
that "there is no conceivable basis for distinguishing thecommitment of a person who is nearing the end of a penal

Opinion of the Court
term from all other civil commitments." Id., at 111-112. Ifan individual otherwise meets the requirements for involuntary civil commitment, the State is under no obligation torelease that individual simply because the detention would
follow a period of incarceration.Hendricks also argues that even if the Act survives the
"multiple punishments" test, it nevertheless fails the "sameelements" test of

Blockburger v. United States, 284 U. S. 299(1932). Under Blockburger, "where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provi-sions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are
two offenses or only one, is whether each provision requiresproof of a fact which the other does not."

Id., at 304. TheBlockburger test, however, simply does not apply outside of

the successive prosecution context. A proceeding under theAct does not define an "offense," the elements of which can
be compared to the elements of an offense for which the per-son may previously have been convicted. Nor does the Act
make the commission of a specified "offense" the basis forinvoking the commitment proceedings. Instead, it uses a
prior conviction (or previously charged conduct) for eviden-tiary purposes to determine whether a person suffers from
a "mental abnormality" or "personality disorder" and alsoposes a threat to the public. Accordingly, we are unpersuaded by Hendricks' novel application of the Blockburgertest and conclude that the Act does not violate the Double
Jeopardy Clause. 2

Hendricks' ex post facto claim is similarly flawed. The Ex
Post Facto Clause, which " `forbids the application of any newpunitive measure to a crime already consummated,' " has

been interpreted to pertain exclusively to penal statutes.
California Dept. of Corrections v. Morales, 514 U. S. 499,505 (1995) (quoting Lindsey v. Washington, 301 U. S. 397, 401

(1937)). As we have previously determined, the Act doesnot impose punishment; thus, its application does not raise

ex post facto concerns. Moreover, the Act clearly does nothave retroactive effect. Rather, the Act permits involuntary confinement based upon a determination that the personcurrently both suffers from a "mental abnormality" or "personality disorder" and is likely to pose a future danger to thepublic. To the extent that past behavior is taken into account, it is used, as noted above, solely for evidentiary pur-poses. Because the Act does not criminalize conduct legal
before its enactment, nor deprive Hendricks of any defensethat was available to him at the time of his crimes, the Act
does not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause.

III
We hold that the Kansas Sexually Violent Predator Actcomports with due process requirements and neither runs

afoul of double jeopardy principles nor constitutes an exer-cise in impermissible

ex post facto lawmaking. Accordingly,the judgment of the Kansas Supreme Court is reversed.

It is so ordered.
Justice Kennedy, concurring.
I join the opinion of the Court in full and add these addi-tional comments.

Though other issues were argued to us, as the action hasmatured it turns on whether the Kansas statute is an ex post
facto law. A law enacted after commission of the offenseand which punishes the offense by extending the term of
confinement is a textbook example of an ex post facto law.If the object or purpose of the Kansas law had been to provide treatment but the treatment provisions were adoptedas a sham or mere pretext, there would have been an indication of the forbidden purpose to punish. The Court's opiniongives a full and complete explanation why an

ex post factochallenge based on this contention cannot succeed in the action before us. All this, however, concerns Hendricks alone.My brief, further comment is to caution against dangers in521US1 Unit: $U82 [11-18-99 20:29:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN

herent when a civil confinement law is used in conjunctionwith the criminal process, whether or not the law is given

retroactive application.It seems the dissent, too, would validate the Kansas statute as to persons who committed the crime after its enactment, and it might even validate the statute as to Hendricks,assuming a reasonable level of treatment. As all Members

of the Court seem to agree, then, the power of the State toconfine persons who, by reason of a mental disease or mental
abnormality, constitute a real, continuing, and serious dangerto society is well established.

Addington v. Texas, 441 U. S.
418, 426-427 (1979). Confinement of such individuals is permitted even if it is pursuant to a statute enacted after the
crime has been committed and the offender has begun serving, or has all but completed serving, a penal sentence, provided there is no object or purpose to punish. See Baxstrom v. Herold, 383 U. S. 107, 111-112 (1966). The Kansas
law, with its attendant protections, including yearly review
and review at any time at the instance of the person confined,
is within this pattern and tradition of civil confinement. In
this action, the mental abnormality--pedophilia--is at least
described in the DSM-IV. American Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
524-525, 527-528 (4th ed. 1994).

Notwithstanding its civil attributes, the practical effect of
the Kansas law may be to impose confinement for life. At
this stage of medical knowledge, although future treatments
cannot be predicted, psychiatrists or other professionals engaged in treating pedophilia may be reluctant to find measurable success in treatment even after a long period and may
be unable to predict that no serious danger will come from
release of the detainee.

A common response to this may be, "A life term is exactly
what the sentence should have been anyway," or, in the
words of a Kansas task force member, "SO BE IT." Testimony of Jim Blaufuss, App. 503. The point, however, is not

how long Hendricks and others like him should serve a crimi-nal sentence. With his criminal record, after all, a life term

may well have been the only sentence appropriate to protectsociety and vindicate the wrong. The concern instead is
whether it is the criminal system or the civil system whichshould make the decision in the first place. If the civil system is used simply to impose punishment after the Statemakes an improvident plea bargain on the criminal side, then
it is not performing its proper function. These concernspersist whether the civil confinement statute is put on the
books before or after the offense. We should bear in mindthat while incapacitation is a goal common to both the criminal and civil systems of confinement, retribution and generaldeterrence are reserved for the criminal system alone.

On the record before us, the Kansas civil statute conformsto our precedents. If, however, civil confinement were to
become a mechanism for retribution or general deterrence,or if it were shown that mental abnormality is too imprecise
a category to offer a solid basis for concluding that civil de-tention is justified, our precedents would not suffice to validate it.

Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Stevens and Justice Souter join, and with whom Justice Ginsburg joinsas to Parts II and III, dissenting.

I agree with the majority that the Kansas Sexually ViolentPredator Act's "definition of `mental abnormality' " satisfies
the "substantive" requirements of the Due Process Clause.
Ante, at 356. Kansas, however, concedes that Hendricks'
condition is treatable; yet the Act did not provide Hendricks
(or others like him) with any treatment until after his re-lease date from prison and only inadequate treatment thereafter. These, and certain other, special features of the Actconvince me that it was not simply an effort to commit Hendricks civilly, but rather an effort to inflict further punish-ment upon him. The

hibits the Act's application to Hendricks, who committedhis crimes prior to its enactment.

I
I begin with the area of agreement. This Court has heldthat the civil commitment of a "mentally ill" and "dangerous"

person does not automatically violate the Due ProcessClause provided that the commitment takes place pursuant
to proper procedures and evidentiary standards. See Foucha v. Louisiana, 504 U. S. 71, 80 (1992); Addington v. Texas,441 U. S. 418, 426-427 (1979). The Kansas Supreme Court,

however, held that the Due Process Clause forbids applica-tion of the Act to Hendricks for "substantive" reasons, i. e.,
irrespective of the procedures or evidentiary standards used.The court reasoned that Kansas had not satisfied the "mentally ill" requirement of the Due Process Clause becauseHendricks was not "mentally ill."

In re Hendricks, 259 Kan.246, 260-261, 912 P. 2d 129, 137-138 (1996). Moreover, Kansas had not satisfied what the court believed was an addi-tional "substantive due process" requirement, namely, the
provision of treatment. Id., at 257-258, 912 P. 2d, at 136. Ishall consider each of these matters briefly.

A
In my view, the Due Process Clause permits Kansas toclassify Hendricks as a mentally ill and dangerous person for

civil commitment purposes. Allen v. Illinois, 478 U. S. 364,370-371, 373-375 (1986). I agree with the majority that the
Constitution gives States a degree of leeway in making thiskind of determination.

Ante, at 359; Foucha, supra, at 87(O'
Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judg-ment);

Jones v. United States, 463 U. S. 354, 365, n. 13 (1983).But, because I do not subscribe to all of its reasoning, I shall

set forth three sets of circumstances that, taken together,convince me that Kansas has acted within the limits that the
Due Process Clause substantively sets.

First, the psychiatric profession itself classifies the kind ofproblem from which Hendricks suffers as a serious mental

disorder. E. g., American Psychiatric Assn., Diagnostic andStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders 524-525, 527-528 (4th
ed. 1994) (describing range of paraphilias and discussing how
stress aggravates pedophilic behavior); Abel & Rouleau,Male Sex Offenders, in Handbook of Outpatient Treatment

of Adults 271 (M. Thase, B. Edelstein, & M. Hersen eds.1990). I concede that professionals also debate whether or
not this disorder should be called a mental "illness." SeeR. Slovenko, Psychiatry and Criminal Culpability 57 (1995)
(citing testimony that paraphilias are not mental illnesses);
Schopp & Sturgis, Sexual Predators and Legal Mental Illness for Civil Commitment, 13 Behav. Sci. & The Law 437,
451-452 (1995) (same). Compare Brief for American Psychiatric Association as Amicus Curiae 26 (mental illness
requirement not satisfied) with Brief for Menninger Clinic
et al. as Amici Curiae 22-25 (requirement is satisfied). But
the very presence and vigor of this debate is important.
The Constitution permits a State to follow one reasonable
professional view, while rejecting another. See Addington
v. Texas, supra, at 431. The psychiatric debate, therefore,
helps to inform the law by setting the bounds of what is
reasonable, but it cannot here decide just how States must
write their laws within those bounds. See Jones, supra, at
365, n. 13.

Second, Hendricks' abnormality does not consist simply of
a long course of antisocial behavior, but rather it includes a
specific, serious, and highly unusual inability to control his
actions. (For example, Hendricks testified that, when he
gets "stressed out," he cannot "control the urge" to molest
children, see ante, at 355.) The law traditionally has considered this kind of abnormality akin to insanity for purposes
of confinement. See, e. g., Minnesota ex rel. Pearson v. Probate Court of Ramsey Cty., 309 U. S. 270, 274 (1940) (upholding against a due process challenge the civil confinement of

a dangerous person where the danger flowed from an " `utterlack of power to control . . . sexual impulses' ") (quoting

State
ex rel. Pearson v. Probate Court of Ramsey Cty., 205 Minn.545, 555, 287 N. W. 297, 302 (1939)); 1788 N. Y. Laws, ch. 31

(permitting confinement of those who are "furiously mad");
In re Oakes, 8 Law Rep. 122, 125 (Mass. 1845) (Shaw, C. J.);A. Deutsch, The Mentally Ill in America 419-420 (1949)

(tracing history of commitment of furiously mad people in18th and 19th centuries); Dershowitz, The Origins of Preventative Confinement in Anglo-American Law--Part II: TheAmerican Experience, 43 U. Cin. L. Rev. 781 (1974). Indeed,
the notion of an "irresistible impulse" often has helped to
shape criminal law's insanity defense and to inform the related recommendations of legal experts as they seek to translate the insights of mental health professionals into workable
legal rules. See also American Law Institute, Model Penal
Code $ 4.01 (insanity defense, in part, rests on inability "to
conform . . . conduct to the requirements of law"); A. Goldstein, The Insanity Defense 67-79 (1967) (describing "irresistible impulse" test).

Third, Hendricks' mental abnormality also makes him dangerous. Hendricks "has been convicted of . . . a sexually
violent offense," and a jury found that he "suffers from a
mental abnormality . . . which makes" him "likely to engage"
in similar "acts of sexual violence" in the future. Kan. Stat.
Ann. $$ 59-29a02, 59-29a03 (1994). The evidence at trial favored the State. Dr. Befort, for example, explained why
Hendricks was likely to commit further acts of sexual violence if released. See, e. g., App. 248-254. And Hendricks'
own testimony about what happens when he gets "stressed
out" confirmed Dr. Befort's diagnosis.

Because (1) many mental health professionals consider pedophilia a serious mental disorder; and (2) Hendricks suffers
from a classic case of irresistible impulse, namely, he is so
afflicted with pedophilia that he cannot "control the urge" to
molest children; and (3) his pedophilia presents a serious

Breyer, J., dissenting
danger to those children, I believe that Kansas can classifyHendricks as "mentally ill" and "dangerous" as this Court

used those terms in Foucha.The Kansas Supreme Court's contrary conclusion rested
primarily upon that court's view that Hendricks would notqualify for civil commitment under Kansas' own state civil
commitment statute. The issue before us, however, is oneof constitutional interpretation. The Constitution does not
require Kansas to write all of its civil commitment rules ina single statute or forbid it to write two separate statutes
each covering somewhat different classes of committable in-dividuals. Moreover, Hendricks apparently falls outside the
scope of the Kansas general civil commitment statute be-cause that statute permits confinement only of those who
"lac[k] capacity to make an informed decision concerningtreatment." Kan. Stat. Ann. $ 59-2902(h) (1994). The statute does not tell us why it imposes this requirement. Ca-pacity to make an informed decision about treatment is not
always or obviously incompatible with severe mental illness.Neither Hendricks nor his

amici point to a uniform body ofprofessional opinion that says as much, and we have not

found any. See, e. g., American Psychiatric Assn., Guide-lines for Legislation on the Psychiatric Hospitalization of
Adults, 140 Am. J. Psychiatry 672, 673 (1983); Stromberg &Stone, A Model State Law on Civil Commitment of the Mentally Ill, 20 Harv. J. Legis. 275, 301-302 (1983); DeLand &Borenstein, Medicine Court, II,

Rivers in Practice, 147 Am.J. Psychiatry 38 (1990). Consequently, the boundaries of the

Federal Constitution and those of Kansas' general civil com-mitment statute are not congruent.

B
The Kansas Supreme Court also held that the Due ProcessClause requires a State to provide treatment to those whom

it civilly confines (as "mentally ill" and "dangerous"). Itfound that Kansas did not provide Hendricks with significant

Breyer, J., dissenting
treatment. And it concluded that Hendricks' confinementviolated the Due Process Clause for this reason as well.

This case does not require us to consider whether the DueProcess Clause

always requires treatment--whether, for example, it would forbid civil confinement of an untreatable
mentally ill, dangerous person. To the contrary, Kansas ar-gues that pedophilia is an "abnormality" or "illness" that can

be treated. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 12 (Kansas Attorney Gen-eral, in response to the question "you're claiming that there
is some treatability . . . ?" answering "[a]bsolutely"); Brieffor Petitioner 42-47. Two groups of mental health professionals agree. Brief for Association for the Treatment of
Sexual Abusers as Amicus Curiae 11-12 (stating that "sex
offenders can be treated" and that "increasing evidence"
shows that "state-of-the-art treatment programs . . . significantly reduce recidivism"); Brief for Menninger Foundation
et al. as Amici Curiae 28. Indeed, no one argues the contrary. Hence the legal question before us is whether the
Clause forbids Hendricks' confinement unless Kansas provides him with treatment that it concedes is available.

Nor does anyone argue that Kansas somehow could have
violated the Due Process Clause's treatment concerns had it
provided Hendricks with the treatment that is potentially
available (and I do not see how any such argument could
succeed). Rather, the basic substantive due process treatment question is whether that Clause requires Kansas to
provide treatment that it concedes is potentially available to
a person whom it concedes is treatable. This same question
is at the heart of my discussion of whether Hendricks' confinement violates the Constitution's Ex Post Facto Clause.
See infra, at 383-395. For that reason, I shall not consider
the substantive due process treatment question separately,
but instead shall simply turn to the Ex Post Facto Clause
discussion. As Justice Kennedy points out, ante, p. 371,
some of the matters there discussed may later prove relevant
to substantive due process analysis.

Kansas' 1994 Act violates the Federal Constitution's prohi-bition of "any . . .

ex post facto Law" if it "inflicts" uponHendricks "a greater punishment" than did the law "annexed

to" his "crime[s]" when he "committed" those crimes in 1984.Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 390 (1798) (opinion of Chase, J.);
U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 10. The majority agrees that theClause " `forbids the application of any new punitive measure
to a crime already consummated.' " California Dept. of
Corrections v. Morales, 514 U. S. 499, 505 (1995) (citationomitted; emphasis added). Ante, at 370-371. But it finds

the Act is not "punitive." With respect to that basic ques-tion, I disagree with the majority.

Certain resemblances between the Act's "civil commit-ment" and traditional criminal punishments are obvious.
Like criminal imprisonment, the Act's civil commitmentamounts to "secure" confinement, Kan. Stat. Ann. $ 59-
29a07(a) (1994), and "incarceration against one's will," In re
Gault, 387 U. S. 1, 50 (1967). See Testimony of Terry Davis,SRS Director of Quality Assurance, App. 52-54, 78-81 (confinement takes place in the psychiatric wing of a prison hos-pital where those whom the Act confines and ordinary prisoners are treated alike). Cf. Browning-Ferris Industries of
Vt., Inc. v. Kelco Disposal, Inc., 492 U. S. 257, 298 (1989)(

O'Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).In addition, a basic objective of the Act is incapacitation,

which, as Blackstone said in describing an objective of crimi-nal law, is to "depriv[e] the party injuring of the power to do
future mischief." 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *11-*12(incapacitation is one important purpose of criminal punishment); see also Foucha, 504 U. S., at 99 (Kennedy, J., dis-senting) ("Incapacitation for the protection of society is not
an unusual ground for incarceration"); United States v.Brown, 381 U. S. 437, 458 (1965) ("Punishment serves several
purposes: retributive, rehabilitative, deterrent--and preven-tative. One of the reasons society imprisons those convicted

that does not make imprisonment any the less punishment");
1 W. LaFave & A. Scott, Substantive Criminal Law $ 1.5,
p. 32 (1986); 18 U. S. C. $ 3553(a); United States Sentencing
Guidelines, Guidelines Manual, ch. 1, pt. A (Nov. 1995).

Moreover, the Act, like criminal punishment, imposes its
confinement (or sanction) only upon an individual who has
previously committed a criminal offense. Kan. Stat. Ann.

$$ 59-29a02(a), 59-29a03(a) (1994). Cf. Department of Revenue of Mont. v. Kurth Ranch, 511 U. S. 767, 781 (1994) (fact
that a tax on marijuana was "conditioned on the commission
of a crime" is " `significant of [its] penal and prohibitory intent' " (citation omitted)); Lipke v. Lederer, 259 U. S. 557,
561-562 (1922). And the Act imposes that confinement
through the use of persons (county prosecutors), procedural
guarantees (trial by jury, assistance of counsel, psychiatric
evaluations), and standards ("beyond a reasonable doubt")
traditionally associated with the criminal law. Kan. Stat.
Ann. $$ 59-29a06, 59-29a07 (1994).

These obvious resemblances by themselves, however, are
not legally sufficient to transform what the Act calls "civil
commitment" into a criminal punishment. Civil commitment of dangerous, mentally ill individuals by its very nature
involves confinement and incapacitation. Yet "civil commitment," from a constitutional perspective, nonetheless remains civil. Allen v. Illinois, 478 U. S., at 369-370. Nor
does the fact that criminal behavior triggers the Act make
the critical difference. The Act's insistence upon a prior
crime, by screening out those whose past behavior does not
concretely demonstrate the existence of a mental problem or
potential future danger, may serve an important noncriminal
evidentiary purpose. Neither is the presence of criminal
law-type procedures determinative. Those procedures can
serve an important purpose that in this context one might
consider noncriminal, namely, helping to prevent judgmental

mistakes that would wrongly deprive a person of importantliberty.

Id., at 371-372.
If these obvious similarities cannot by themselves provethat Kansas' "civil commitment" statute is criminal, neither

can the word "civil" written into the statute, $ 59-29a01, by
itself prove the contrary. This Court has said that only the"clearest proof " could establish that a law the legislature

called "civil" was, in reality, a "punitive" measure. United
States v. Ward, 448 U. S. 242, 248-249 (1980). But the Court
has also reiterated that a "civil label is not always disposi-tive,"

Allen v. Illinois, supra, at 369; it has said that in close
cases the label is " `not of paramount importance,' " Kurth
Ranch, supra, at 777 (citation omitted); and it has looked
behind a "civil" label fairly often, e. g., United States v.
Halper, 490 U. S. 435, 447 (1989).

In this circumstance, with important features of the Act
pointing in opposite directions, I would place particular importance upon those features that would likely distinguish
between a basically punitive and a basically nonpunitive purpose. United States v. Ursery, 518 U. S. 267, 278 (1996) (asking whether a statutory scheme was so punitive " `either in
purpose or effect' " to negate the legislature's " `intention to
establish a civil remedial mechanism' " (citations omitted)).
And I note that the Court, in an earlier civil commitment
case, Allen v. Illinois, 478 U. S., at 369, looked primarily to
the law's concern for treatment as an important distinguishing feature. I do not believe that Allen means that a particular law's lack of concern for treatment, by itself, is enough
to make an incapacitative law punitive. But, for reasons I
will point out, when a State believes that treatment does
exist, and then couples that admission with a legislatively
required delay of such treatment until a person is at the end
of his jail term (so that further incapacitation is therefore
necessary), such a legislative scheme begins to look punitive.

In Allen, the Court considered whether, for Fifth Amendment purposes, proceedings under an Illinois statute were

Breyer, J., dissenting
civil or "criminal." The Illinois statute, rather like the Kan-sas statute here, authorized the confinement of persons who

were sexually dangerous, who had committed at least oneprior sexual assault, and who suffered from a "mental disorder." Id., at 366, n. 1. The Allen Court, looking behind the
statute's "civil commitment" label, found the statute civil--in important part because the State had "provided for the

treatment of those it commits." Id., at 370 (also referringto facts that the State had "disavowed any interest in punishment" and that it had "established a system under whichcommitted persons may be released after the briefest time
in confinement").

In reaching this conclusion, the Court noted that the State
Supreme Court had found the proceedings " `essentially
civil' " because the statute's aim was to provide " `treatment,
not punishment.' " Id., at 367 (quoting People v. Allen, 107
Ill. 2d 91, 99-101, 481 N. E. 2d 690, 694-695 (1985)). It observed that the State had "a statutory obligation to provide
`care and treatment . . . designed to effect recovery' " in a
"facility set aside to provide psychiatric care." 478 U. S., at
369 (quoting Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 38, || 105-8 (1985)). And it
referred to the State's purpose as one of "treating rather
than punishing sexually dangerous persons." 478 U. S., at
373; see also ibid. ("Had petitioner shown, for example, that
the confinement . . . imposes . . . a regimen which is essentially identical to that imposed upon felons with no need for
psychiatric care, this might well be a different case").

The Allen Court's focus upon treatment, as a kind of
touchstone helping to distinguish civil from punitive purposes, is not surprising, for one would expect a nonpunitive
statutory scheme to confine, not simply in order to protect,
but also in order to cure. That is to say, one would expect
a nonpunitively motivated legislature that confines because
of a dangerous mental abnormality to seek to help the individual himself overcome that abnormality (at least insofar
as professional treatment for the abnormality exists and is

potentially helpful, as Kansas, supported by some groups ofmental health professionals, argues is the case here, see

supra, at 378). Conversely, a statutory scheme that pro-vides confinement that does not reasonably fit a practically
available, medically oriented treatment objective, more
likely reflects a primarily punitive legislative purpose.Several important treatment-related factors--factors of a

kind that led the five-Member Allen majority to concludethat the Illinois Legislature's purpose was primarily civil,
not punitive--in this action suggest precisely the opposite.First, the State Supreme Court here, unlike the state court
in Allen, has held that treatment is not a significant objective
of the Act. The Kansas court wrote that the Act's purpose
is "segregation of sexually violent offenders," with "treatment" a matter that was "incidental at best." 259 Kan., at
258, 912 P. 2d, at 136. By way of contrast, in Allen the Illinois court had written that " `treatment, not punishment,' "
was "the aim of the statute." Allen, supra, at 367 (quoting
People v. Allen, supra, at 99-101, 481 N. E. 2d, at 694-695).

We have generally given considerable weight to the findings of state and lower federal courts regarding the intent
or purpose underlying state officials' actions, see U. S. Term
Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, 514 U. S. 779, 829 (1995) (ordinarily

of its own law"); Romer v. Evans, 517 U. S. 620, 626 (1996);

utes, see, e. g., R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377, 381 (1992).For example,

Allen's dissenters, as well as its majority, considered the state court's characterization of the state law'spurpose an important factor in determining the constitutionality of that statute. Allen, 478 U. S., at 380 (Stevens, J.,
dissenting) (describing the state court as "the final authorityon the . . . purpose" of the statute).

The record provides support for the Kansas court's con-clusion. The court found that, as of the time of Hendricks'
commitment, the State had not funded treatment, it had notentered into treatment contracts, and it had little, if any,

qualified treatment staff. See 259 Kan., at 249, 258, 912
P. 2d, at 131, 136; Testimony of Dr. Charles Befort, App. 255
(acknowledging that he has no specialized training); Testimony of John House, SRS Attorney, id., at 367 (no contract
has been signed by bidders); Testimony of John House, SRS
Attorney, id., at 369 (no one hired to operate sexually violent predator (SVP) program or to serve as clinical director,
psychiatrist, or psychologist). Indeed, were we to follow
the majority's invitation to look beyond the record in this
case, an invitation with which we disagree, see infra, at
391-393, it would reveal that Hendricks, according to the
commitment program's own director, was receiving "essentially no treatment." Dr. Charles Befort in State Habeas
Corpus Proceeding, App. 393; 259 Kan., at 249, 258, 912 P. 2d,
at 131, 136. See also App. 421 ("[T]he treatment that is prescribed by statute" is "still not available"); id., at 420-421
(the "needed treatment" "hasn't been delivered yet" and
"Hendricks has wasted ten months" in "terms of treatment
effects"); id., at 391-392 (Dr. Befort admitting that he is not
qualified to be SVP program director).

It is therefore not surprising that some of the Act's official
supporters had seen in it an opportunity permanently to confine dangerous sex offenders, e. g., id., at 468 (statement of
Attorney General Robert Stephan); id., at 475-476, 478
(statement of Special Assistant to the Attorney General

Breyer, J., dissenting
Carla Stovall). Others thought that effective treatment didnot exist,

id., at 503 (statement of Jim Blaufuss) ("Because
there is no effective treatment for sex offenders, this Billmay mean a life sentence for a felon that is considered a risk

to women and children. SO BE IT!")--a view, by the way,
that the State of Kansas, supported by groups of informedmental health professionals, here strongly denies. See

supra, at 378.The Kansas court acknowledged the existence of "provisions of the Act for treatment" (although it called them"somewhat disingenuous"). 259 Kan., at 258, 912 P. 2d, at
136. Cf. Kan. Stat. Ann. $ 59-29a01 (1994) (legislative findings that "prognosis for rehabilita[tion] . . . in a prison setting
is poor, . . . treatment needs . . . long term" and "commitment
procedure for . . . long term care and treatment . . . necessary"); $ 59-29a09 ("commitment . . . shall conform to constitutional requirements for care and treatment"). Nor did the
court deny that Kansas could later increase the amount of
treatment it provided. But the Kansas Supreme Court
could, and did, use the Act's language, history, and initial
implementation to help it characterize the Act's primary
purposes.

Second, the Kansas statute, insofar as it applies to previously convicted offenders such as Hendricks, commits,
confines, and treats those offenders after they have served
virtually their entire criminal sentence. That time-related
circumstance seems deliberate. The Act explicitly defers
diagnosis, evaluation, and commitment proceedings until a
few weeks prior to the "anticipated release" of a previously
convicted offender from prison. Kan. Stat. Ann. $ 59-
29a03(a)(1) (1994). But why, one might ask, does the Act not
commit and require treatment of sex offenders sooner, say,
soon after they begin to serve their sentences?

An Act that simply seeks confinement, of course, would
not need to begin civil commitment proceedings sooner.
Such an Act would have to begin proceedings only when an

Breyer, J., dissenting
offender's prison term ends, threatening his release from theconfinement that imprisonment assures. But it is difficult

to see why rational legislators who seek treatment wouldwrite the Act in this way--providing treatment years after
the criminal act that indicated its necessity. See, e. g., Wettstein, A Psychiatric Perspective on Washington's SexuallyViolent Predators Statute, 15 U. Puget Sound L. Rev. 597,

617 (1992) (stating that treatment delay leads to "loss ofmemory" and makes it "more difficult for the offender" to
"accept responsibility," and that time in prison leads to at-titude hardening that "engender[s] a distorted view of the
precipitating offense"). And it is particularly difficult to see
why legislators who specifically wrote into the statute a
finding that "prognosis for rehabilitating . . . in a prison setting is poor" would leave an offender in that setting for
months or years before beginning treatment. This is to
say, the timing provisions of the statute confirm the Kansas
Supreme Court's view that treatment was not a particularly
important legislative objective.

I recognize one possible counterargument. A State,
wanting both to punish Hendricks (say, for deterrence purposes) and also to treat him, might argue that it should be
permitted to postpone treatment until after punishment in
order to make certain that the punishment in fact occurs.
But any such reasoning is out of place here. Much of the
treatment that Kansas offered here (called "ward milieu" and
"group therapy") can be given at the same time as, and in
the same place where, Hendricks serves his punishment.
See, e. g., Testimony of Leroy Hendricks, App. 142-143, 150,
154, 179-181 (stating that Washington and Kansas had both
provided group therapy to Hendricks, and that he had both
taken and refused such treatment at various points); Testimony of Terry Davis, SRS Director of Quality Assurance,
id., at 78-81 (pointing out that treatment under the Act
takes place in surroundings very similar to those in which
prisoners receive treatment); Testimony of John House, SRS

Attorney, id., at 375-376. See also Task Force on Community Protection, Final Report to Booth Gardner, Governor
State of Washington II-2 (1989) (findings of task force that
developed the Washington State Act, which served as a
model for Kansas' Act, stating that "[s]ex offenders can be
treated during incarceration"). The evidence adduced at
the state habeas proceeding, were we to assume it properly
before the Court, see infra, at 392-393, supports this conclusion as well. See Testimony of Dr. Befort at State Habeas
Proceeding, App. 399, 406-408 (describing treatment as ward
milieu and group therapy); id., at 416-417 (stating that Kansas offers similar treatment, on a voluntary basis, to prisoners). Hence, assuming, arguendo, that it would be otherwise permissible, Kansas need not postpone treatment in
order to make certain that sex offenders serve their full
terms of imprisonment, i. e., to make certain that they receive the entire punishment that Kansas criminal law provides. To the contrary, the statement in the Act itself, that
the Act aims to respond to special "long term" "treatment
needs," suggests that treatment should begin during imprisonment. It also suggests that, were those long-term treatment needs (rather than further punishment) Kansas' primary aim, the State would require that treatment begin soon
after conviction, not 10 or more years later. See also Vt.
Stat. Ann., Tit. 18, $ 2815 (1959) (providing for treatment of
sexual psychopaths first, and punishment afterwards).

Third, the statute, at least as of the time Kansas applied
it to Hendricks, did not require the committing authority to
consider the possibility of using less restrictive alternatives,
such as postrelease supervision, halfway houses, or other
methods that amici supporting Kansas here have mentioned.

388 KANSAS v. HENDRICKS

Breyer, J., dissenting
This Court has said that a failure to consider, or to use,"alternative and less harsh methods" to achieve a nonpunitive objective can help to show that legislature's "purpose. . . was to punish."

Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520, 539, n. 20
(1979). And one can draw a similar conclusion here. Legislation that seeks to help the individual offender as well as toprotect the public would avoid significantly greater restriction of an individual's liberty than public safety requires.See Keilitz, Conn, & Gianpetro, Least Restrictive Treatment
of Involuntary Patients: Translating Concepts into Practice,29 St. Louis U. L. J. 691, 693 (1985) (describing "least restrictive alternativ[e]" provisions in the ordinary civil commitment laws of almost all States); Lyon, Levine, & Zusman,
Patients' Bill of Rights: A Survey of State Statutes, 6 Mental
Disability L. Rep. 178, 181-183 (1982) (same). Legislation
that seeks almost exclusively to incapacitate the individual
through confinement, however, would not necessarily concern itself with potentially less restrictive forms of incapacitation. I would reemphasize that this is not a case in which
the State claims there is no treatment potentially available.
Rather, Kansas, and supporting amici, argue that pedophilia
is treatable. See supra, at 378.

Fourth, the laws of other States confirm, through comparison, that Kansas' "civil commitment" objectives do not require the statutory features that indicate a punitive purpose.
I have found 17 States with laws that seek to protect the
public from mentally abnormal, sexually dangerous individuals through civil commitment or other mandatory treatment
programs. Ten of those statutes, unlike the Kansas statute,
begin treatment of an offender soon after he has been apprehended and charged with a serious sex offense. Only seven,
like Kansas, delay "civil" commitment (and treatment) until
the offender has served his criminal sentence (and this figure
includes the Acts of Minnesota and New Jersey, both of
which generally do not delay treatment). Of these seven,
however, six (unlike Kansas) require consideration of less re521US1 Unit: $U82 [11-18-99 20:29:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN

strictive alternatives. See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. $$ 13-4601,4606B (Supp. 1996-1997); Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code Ann.

$$ 6607, 6608 (West Supp. 1997); Minn. Stat. $ 253B.09 (1996);N. J. Stat. Ann. $ 30:4-27.11d (West 1997); Wash. Rev. Code
Ann. $ 71.09.090 (Supp. 1996-1997); Wis. Stat. $ 980.06(2)(b)
(Supp. 1993-1994). Only one State other than Kansas,namely Iowa, both delays civil commitment (and consequent

treatment) and does not explicitly consider less restrictivealternatives. But the law of that State applies prospectively only, thereby avoiding ex post facto problems. SeeIowa Code Ann. $ 709C.12 (Supp. 1997) (Iowa SVP Act only
"applies to persons convicted of a sexually violent offense on
or after July 1, 1997"); see also Appendix, infra. Thus the
practical experience of other States, as revealed by their
statutes, confirms what the Kansas Supreme Court's finding,
the timing of the civil commitment proceeding, and the failure to consider less restrictive alternatives, themselves suggest, namely, that for Ex Post Facto Clause purposes, the
purpose of the Kansas Act (as applied to previously convicted
offenders) has a punitive, rather than a purely civil, purpose.

Kansas points to several cases as support for a contrary
conclusion. It points to Allen--which is, as we have seen, a
case in which the Court concluded that Illinois' "civil commitment" proceedings were not criminal. I have explained in
detail, however, how the statute here differs from that in
Allen, and why Allen's reasoning leads to a different conclusion in this litigation. See supra, at 381-388 and this page.

Kansas also points to Addington v. Texas, where the Court
held that the Constitution does not require application of
criminal law's "beyond a reasonable doubt" standard in a
civil commitment proceeding. 441 U. S., at 428. If some
criminal law guarantees such as "reasonable doubt" did not
apply in Addington, should other guarantees, such as the
prohibition against ex post facto laws, apply here? The answer to this question, of course, lies in the particular statute
at issue in Addington--a Texas statute that, this Court ob521US1 Unit: $U82 [11-18-99 20:29:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Breyer, J., dissenting
served, did "not exercis[e]" state power "in a punitive sense."
Ibid. That statute did not add civil commitment's confinement to imprisonment; rather civil commitment was, at most,a substitute for criminal punishment. See Tex. Rev. Civ.

Stat. Ann. $ 5547-41 (Vernon 1958) (petition must state "proposed patient is not charged with a crime or [is] charged[but] transferred . . . for civil commitment proceedings").

And this Court, relying on the Texas Supreme Court's inter-pretation, wrote that the "State of Texas confines only for
the purpose of providing care designed to treat the individ-ual."

Addington, supra, at 428, n. 4 (citing State v. Turner,
556 S. W. 2d 563, 566 (1977)). Cf. Specht v. Patterson, 386
U. S. 605, 608-609 (1967) (separate postconviction sexual psychopath commitment/sentencing proceeding held after conviction for serious sex crime, imposes a "criminal punishment even though . . . designed not so much as retribution
as . . . to keep individuals from inflicting future harm").
Nothing I say here would change the reach or holding of
Addington in any way. That is, a State is free to commit
those who are dangerous and mentally ill in order to treat
them. Nor does my decision preclude a State from deciding
that a certain subset of people are mentally ill, dangerous,
and untreatable, and that confinement of this subset is therefore necessary (again, assuming that all the procedural safeguards of Addington are in place). But when a State decides offenders can be treated and confines an offender to
provide that treatment, but then refuses to provide it, the
refusal to treat while a person is fully incapacitated begins
to look punitive.

The majority suggests that this is the very case I say it is
not, namely, a case of a mentally ill person who is untreatable. Ante, at 365. And it quotes a long excerpt from the
Kansas Supreme Court's opinion in support. That court,
however, did not find that Hendricks was untreatable; it
found that he was untreated--quite a different matter. Had
the Kansas Supreme Court thought that Hendricks, or oth521US1 Unit: $U82 [11-18-99 20:29:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN

391Cite as: 521 U. S. 346 (1997)
Breyer, J., dissenting
ers like him, are untreatable, it could not have written thewords that follow that excerpt, adopting by reference the

words of another court opinion:

" `The statute forecloses the possibility that offenderswill be evaluated and treated until after they have been

punished. . . . Setting aside the question of whether aprison term exacerbates or minimizes the mental condition of a sex offender, it plainly delays the treatmentthat must constitutionally accompany commitment pursuant to the Statute. The failure of the Statute to pro-vide for examination or treatment prior to the completion of the punishment phase strongly suggests thattreatment is of secondary, rather than primary, concern.' " 259 Kan., at 258, 912 P. 2d, at 136 (quoting Youngv. Weston, 898 F. Supp. 744, 753 (WD Wash. 1995)).

This quotation, and the rest of the opinion, make clear thatthe court is finding it objectionable that the statute, among
other things, has not provided adequate treatment to onewho, all parties here concede, can be treated.

The majority suggests in the alternative that recent evi-dence shows that Kansas is now providing treatment. Ante,
at 366-368. That evidence comes from two sources: First, astatement by the Kansas Attorney General at oral argument
that those committed under the Act are now receiving treat-ment,

ante, at 368; and second, in a footnote, a Kansas trialjudge's statement, in a state habeas proceeding nearly one

year after Hendricks was committed, that Kansas is provid-ing treatment.

Ante, at 368, n. 5. I do not see how either
of these statements can be used to justify the validity of the
Act's application to Hendricks at the time he filed suit.We are reviewing the Kansas Supreme Court's determination of Hendricks' case. Neither the majority nor thelengthy dissent in that court referred to the two facts that
the majority now seizes upon, and for good reason. Thatcourt denied a motion to take judicial notice of the state

habeas proceeding, see Order of Kansas Supreme Court,No. 94-73039, Mar. 1, 1996. The proceeding is thus not part

of the record, and cannot properly be considered by thisCourt. And the Kansas Supreme Court obviously had no
chance to consider Kansas' new claim made at oral argument
before this Court. There is simply no evidence in the recordbefore this Court that comes even close to resembling the

assertion Kansas made at oral argument. It is the record,not the parties' view of it, that must control our decision.
See Russell v. Southard, 12 How. 139, 158-159 (1851); Adickes v. S. H. Kress & Co., 398 U. S. 144, 157-158, n. 16 (1970);
Hopt v. Utah, 114 U. S. 488, 491-492 (1885); Witters v. Washington Dept. of Servs. for Blind, 474 U. S. 481, 489, n. 3
(1986); New Haven Inclusion Cases, 399 U. S. 392, 450, n. 66
(1970); R. Stern, E. Gressman, S. Shapiro, & K. Geller, Supreme Court Practice 555-556, 594 (7th ed. 1993); Fed. Rule
Evid. 201(b).

The prohibition on facts found outside the record is designed to ensure the reliability of the evidence before the
Court. For purposes of my argument in this dissent, however, the material that the majority wishes to consider, when
read in its entirety, shows that Kansas was not providing
treatment to Hendricks. At best, the testimony at the state
hearing contained general and vague references that treatment was about to be provided, but it contains no statement
that Hendricks himself was receiving treatment. And it
provides the majority with no support at all in respect to
that key fact. Indeed, it demonstrates the contrary conclusion. For example, the program's director, Dr. Befort, testified that he would have to tell the court at Hendricks' next
annual review, in October 1995, that Hendricks "has had no
opportunity for meaningful treatment." App. 400. He also
stated that SVP's were receiving "essentially no treatment"
and that the program does not "have adequate staffing."
Id., at 393, 394. And Dr. Befort's last words made clear that
Hendricks has "wasted ten months . . . in terms of treatment

Breyer, J., dissenting
effects" and that, as far as treatment goes, "[t]oday, it's stillnot available."

Id., at 420-421. Nor does the assertion
made by the Kansas Attorney General at oral argument helpthe majority. She never stated that

Hendricks, as opposed
to other SVP's, was receiving this treatment. And we can
find no support for her statement in the record.We have found no other evidence in the record to support

the conclusion that Kansas was in fact providing the treat-ment that all parties agree that it could provide. Thus, even
had the Kansas Supreme Court considered the majority'snew evidence--which it did not--it is not likely to have
changed its characterization of the Act's treatment provisions as "somewhat disingenuous." 259 Kan., at 258, 912
P. 2d, at 136.

Regardless, the Kansas Supreme Court did so characterize
the Act's treatment provisions and did find that treatment
was "at best" an "incidental" objective. Thus, the circumstances here are different from Allen, where the Illinois Supreme Court explicitly found that the statute's aim was to
provide treatment, not punishment. See supra, at 382-384.
There is no evidence in the record that contradicts the finding of the Kansas court. Thus, Allen's approach--its reliance on the state court--if followed here would mean the Act
as applied to Leroy Hendricks (as opposed to others who
may have received treatment or who were sentenced after
the effective date of the Act) is punitive.

Finally, Kansas points to United States v. Salerno, 481
U. S. 739 (1987), a case in which this Court held preventive
detention of a dangerous accused person pending trial constitutionally permissible. Salerno, however, involved the brief
detention of that person, after a finding of "probable cause"
that he had committed a crime that would justify further
imprisonment, and only pending a speedy judicial determination of guilt or innocence. This Court, in Foucha, emphasized the fact that the confinement at issue in Salerno was
"strictly limited in duration." 504 U. S., at 82. It described

521US1 Unit: $U82 [11-18-99 20:29:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN
394 KANSAS v. HENDRICKS

Breyer, J., dissenting
that "pretrial detention of arrestees" as "one of those care-fully limited exceptions permitted by the Due Process

Clause." Id., at 83. And it held that Salerno did not au-thorize the indefinite detention, on grounds of dangerousness, of "insanity acquittees who are not mentally ill but who
do not prove they would not be dangerous to others." 504U. S., at 83. Whatever

Salerno's "due process" implications
may be, it does not focus upon, nor control, the question atissue here, the question of "punishment" for purposes of the

Ex Post Facto Clause.One other case warrants menti on. In

Kennedy v.
Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U. S. 144 (1963), this Court listed
seven factors that helped it determine whether a particular
statute was primarily punitive for purposes of applying the
Fifth and Sixth Amendments. Those factors include
whether a sanction involves an affirmative restraint, how
history has regarded it, whether it applies to behavior already a crime, the need for a finding of scienter, its relationship to a traditional aim of punishment, the presence of a
nonpunitive alternative purpose, and whether it is excessive
in relation to that purpose. Id., at 169. This Court has said
that these seven factors are "neither exhaustive nor dispositive," but nonetheless "helpful." Ward, 448 U. S., at 249.
Paraphrasing them here, I believe the Act before us involves
an affirmative restraint historically regarded as punishment;
imposed upon behavior already a crime after a finding of
scienter; which restraint, namely, confinement, serves a traditional aim of punishment, does not primarily serve an alternative purpose (such as treatment), and is excessive in
relation to any alternative purpose assigned. 372 U. S., at
168-169.

This is not to say that each of the factors the Court mentioned in Martinez-Mendoza on balance argues here in favor
of a constitutional characterization as "punishment." It is
not to say that I have found "a single `formula' for identifying those legislative changes that have a sufficient effect on

substantive crimes or punishments to fall within the con-stitutional prohibition," Morales, 514 U. S., at 509; see also

Halper, 490 U. S., at 447; id., at 453 (Kennedy, J., con-curring). We have not previously done so, and I do not do
so here. Rather, I have pointed to those features of theAct itself, in the context of this litigation, that lead me to
conclude, in light of our precedent, that the added confine-ment the Act imposes upon Hendricks is basically punitive.
This analysis, rooted in the facts surrounding Kansas' fail-ure to treat Hendricks, cannot answer the question whether
the Kansas Act, as it now stands, and in light of its currentimplementation, is punitive toward people other than he.
And I do not attempt to do so here.

III
To find that the confinement the Act imposes upon Hen-dricks is "punishment" is to find a violation of the

Ex PostFacto Clause. Kansas does not deny that the 1994 Act

changed the legal consequences that attached to Hendricks'earlier crimes, and in a way that significantly "disadvantage[d] the offender," Weaver v. Graham, 450 U. S. 24, 29(1981). See Brief for Respondent State of Kansas 37-39.

To find a violation of that Clause here, however, is not tohold that the Clause prevents Kansas, or other States, from
enacting dangerous sexual offender statutes. A statute thatoperates prospectively, for example, does not offend the

ExPost Facto Clause. Weaver, 450 U. S., at 29. Neither does

it offend the Ex Post Facto Clause for a State to sentenceoffenders to the fully authorized sentence, to seek consecutive, rather than concurrent, sentences, or to invokerecidivism statutes to lengthen imprisonment. Moreover, a

Breyer, J., dissenting
The statutory provisions before us do amount to punish-ment primarily because, as I have said, the legislature did

not tailor the statute to fit the nonpunitive civil aim of treat-ment, which it concedes exists in Hendricks' case. The
Clause in these circumstances does not stand as an obstacleto achieving important protections for the public's safety;
rather it provides an assurance that, where so significant arestriction of an individual's basic freedoms is at issue, a
State cannot cut corners. Rather, the legislature must hewto the Constitution's liberty-protecting line. See The Federalist No. 78, p. 466 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton).I therefore would affirm the judgment below.

RICHARDSON et al. v. McKNIGHT
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe sixth circuit

No. 96-318. Argued March 19, 1997--Decided June 23, 1997
Respondent McKnight, a prisoner at a Tennessee correctional center

whose management had been privatized, filed this constitutional tort
action under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 for physical injuries inflicted by petitioner
prison guards. The District Court denied petitioners' motion to dismiss, finding that, since they were employed by a private prison management firm, they were not entitled to qualified immunity from $ 1983
lawsuits. The Court of Appeals affirmed.

Held: Prison guards employed by a private firm are not entitled to a qualified immunity from suit by prisoners charging a $ 1983 violation.
Pp. 402-414.

(a) Four aspects of Wyatt v. Cole, 504 U. S. 158--in which this Court
found no $ 1983 immunity for private defendants charged with invoking
state replevin, garnishment, and attachment statutes later declared unconstitutional--are instructive here. First, $ 1983--which deters state
actors from depriving individuals of their federally protected rights--
can sometimes impose liability upon private individuals. Second, a distinction exists between an immunity from suit--which frees one from
liability whether or not he acted wrongly--and other legal defenses--
which may well involve the essence of the wrong. Third, history and
the purposes underlying $ 1983 immunity determine whether private
defendants enjoy protection from suit. Fourth, the Wyatt holding was
limited to the narrow question before the Court and is not applicable to
all private individuals. Pp. 402-404.

(b) History does not reveal a firmly rooted tradition of immunity
applicable to privately employed prison guards. While governmentemployed prison guards may have enjoyed a kind of immunity defense
arising out of their status as public employees at common law, see Procunier v. Navarette, 434 U. S. 555, 561-562, correctional functions have
never been exclusively public. In the 19th century both private entities
and government itself carried on prison management activities. There
is no conclusive evidence of a historical tradition of immunity for private
parties carrying out these functions. Pp. 404-407.

(c) The immunity doctrine's purposes also do not warrant immunity
for private prison guards. Mere performance of a governmental function does not support immunity for a private person, especially one who

400 RICHARDSON v. McKNIGHT

Syllabus
performs a job without government supervision or direction. Petitioners' argument to the contrary overlooks certain important differences
that are critical from an immunity perspective. First, the most important special government immunity-producing concern--protecting the
public from unwarranted timidity on the part of public officials--is less
likely present when a private company subject to competitive market
pressures operates a prison. A firm whose guards are too aggressive
will face damages that raise costs, thereby threatening its replacement
by another contractor, but a firm whose guards are too timid will face
replacement by firms with safer and more effective job records. Such
marketplace pressures are present here, where the firm is systematically organized, performs independently, is statutorily obligated to carry
insurance, and must renew its first contract after three years. And
they provide the private firm with incentives to avoid overly timid job
performance. To this extent, the employees differ from government
employees, who act within a system that is responsible through elected
officials to the voters and that is often characterized by civil service
rules providing employee security but limiting the government departments' flexibility to reward or punish individual employees. Second,
privatization helps to meet the immunity-related need to ensure that
talented candidates are not deterred by the threat of damages suits from
entering public service. Comprehensive insurance coverage increases
the likelihood of employee indemnification and to that extent reduces the
employment-discouraging fear of unwarranted liability. Since a private
firm is also freed from many civil service restraints, it, unlike a government department, may offset increased employee liability risk with
higher pay or extra benefits. Third, while lawsuits may distract private employees from their duties, the risk of distraction alone cannot be
sufficient grounds for an immunity. Tennessee, which has decided not
to extend sovereign immunity to private prison operators, can, moreover, be understood to have anticipated a certain amount of distraction. Pp. 407-412.

(d) The Court closes with three caveats. First, the focus has been
on $ 1983 immunity, not liability. Second, the immunity question has
been answered narrowly, in the context in which it arose, and, thus, does
not involve a private individual briefly associated with a government
body, serving as an adjunct to government in an essential governmental
activity, or acting under close official supervision. Third, no opinion is
expressed on the issue whether petitioners might assert not immunity,
but a special good-faith defense. Pp. 413-414.

Ronnie Lee McKnight, a prisoner at Tennessee's SouthCentral Correctional Center (SCCC), brought this federal

constitutional tort action against two prison guards, DarrylRichardson and John Walker. He says the guards injured
him by placing upon him extremely tight physical restraints,thereby unlawfully "subject[ing]" him "to the deprivation

Opinion of the Court
and Walker asserted a qualified immunity from $ 1983 law-suits, see Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, 807 (1982), and

moved to dismiss the action. The District Court noted thatTennessee had "privatized" the management of a number of
its correctional facilities, and that consequently a privatefirm, not the state government, employed the guards. See
Tenn. Code Ann. $ 41-24-101 et seq. (1990 and Supp. 1996);see generally Cody & Bennett, The Privatization of Correctional Institutions: The Tennessee Experience, 40 Vand. L.Rev. 829 (1987) (outlining State's history with private correctional services). The court held that, because they workedfor a private company rather than the government, the law
did not grant the guards immunity from suit. It thereforedenied the guards' motion to dismiss. The guards appealed
to the Sixth Circuit. See Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U. S. 511,530 (1985) (permitting interlocutory appeals of qualified immunity determinations); see also Johnson v. Jones, 515 U. S.304 (1995); Behrens v. Pelletier, 516 U. S. 299 (1996). That
court also ruled against them. McKnight v. Rees, 88 F. 3d417, 425 (CA6 1996). The Court of Appeals conceded that
other courts had reached varying conclusions about whether,or the extent to which, private sector defendants are entitled
to immunities of the sort the law provides governmental de-fendants. See,

e. g., Eagon v. Elk City, 72 F. 3d 1480, 1489-1490 (CA10 1996); Williams v. O'Leary, 55 F. 3d 320, 323-324

(CA7), cert. denied, 516 U. S. 993 (1995); Frazier v. Bailey,957 F. 2d 920, 928-929 (CA1 1992). But the court concluded,
primarily for reasons of "public policy," that the privatelyemployed prison guards were not entitled to the immunity
provided their governmental counterparts. 88 F. 3d, at 425.We granted certiorari to review this holding. We now
affirm. II

A
We take the Court's recent case, Wyatt v. Cole, 504 U. S.158 (1992), as pertinent authority. The Court there considered whether private defendants, charged with $ 1983 liabil521US1 Unit: $U83 [11-18-99 20:34:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN

403Cite as: 521 U. S. 399 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
ity for "invoking state replevin, garnishment, and attach-ment statutes" later declared unconstitutional were "entitled

to qualified immunity from suit." Id., at 159. It held thatthey were not. Id., at 169. We find four aspects of Wyatt
relevant here.First, as

Wyatt noted, $ 1983 basically seeks "to deter stateactors from using the badge of their authority to deprive individuals of their federally guaranteed rights" and to providerelated relief. Id., at 161 (emphasis added) (citing Carey v.
Piphus, 435 U. S. 247, 254-257 (1978)); see also Owen v. In-dependence, 445 U. S. 622, 654 (1980). It imposes liability
only where a person acts "under color" of a state "statute,ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage." 42 U. S. C. $ 1983.
Nonetheless, Wyatt reaffirmed that $ 1983 can sometimesimpose liability upon a private individual. 504 U. S., at 162;
see also Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U. S. 922, 924(1982).

Second, Wyatt reiterated that after Harlow, supra, andthis Court's reformulation of the qualified immunity doctrine, see Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U. S. 635, 645 (1987), adistinction exists between an "immunity from suit" and other
kinds of legal defenses. 504 U. S., at 166-167; see alsoMitchell, supra, at 526. As the Wyatt concurrence pointed
out, a legal defense may well involve "the essence of thewrong," while an immunity frees one who enjoys it from a
lawsuit whether or not he acted wrongly. 504 U. S., at 171-172 (

Kennedy, J., concurring).Third, Wyatt specified the legal source of $ 1983 immunities.

It pointed out that although $ 1983 " `creates a species of tortliability that on its face admits of no immunities,' " id., at 163
(quoting Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U. S. 409, 417 (1976)), thisCourt has nonetheless accorded immunity where a

" `tradition of immunity was so firmly rooted in the com-mon law and was supported by such strong policy reasons that "Congress would have specifically so providedhad it wished to abolish the doctrine." ' " 504 U. S., at
164 (quoting Owen v. Independence, supra, at 637).

521US1 Unit: $U83 [11-18-99 20:34:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN
404 RICHARDSON v. McKNIGHT

Opinion of the Court
The Wyatt majority, in deciding whether or not the privatedefendants enjoyed immunity, looked both to history and to

"the special policy concerns involved in suing governmentofficials." 504 U. S., at 167; see also Mitchell, supra, at 526;
Harlow, supra, at 807; Imbler v. Pachtman, supra, at 424.And in this respect--the relevant

sources of the law--boththe Wyatt concurrence and the dissent seemed to agree.

Compare 504 U. S., at 169-171 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (ex-istence of immunity depends upon "historical origins" and
"public policy"), with id., at 175-176 (Rehnquist, C. J., dis-senting) ("immunity" recognized where "similarly situated
defendant would have enjoyed an immunity at common law"or "when important public policy concerns suggest the need
for an immunity").Fourth,

Wyatt did not consider its answer to the questionbefore it as one applicable to all private individuals--irrespective of the nature of their relation to the government,position, or the kind of liability at issue. Rather, Wyatt explicitly limited its holding to what it called a "narrow" ques-tion about "private persons . . . who conspire with state officials," id., at 168, and it answered that question by statingthat private defendants "faced with $ 1983 liability for invoking a state replevin, garnishment, or attachment statute" are
not entitled to immunity, id., at 168-169.Wyatt, then, did not answer the legal question before us,

whether petitioners--two employees of a private prisonmanagement firm--enjoy a qualified immunity from suit
under $ 1983. It does tell us, however, to look both to his-tory and to the purposes that underlie government employee
immunity in order to find the answer. Id., at 164; see also
Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc., 453 U. S. 247, 259 (1981);Owen, supra, at 638; Imbler, supra, at 424.

History does not reveal a "firmly rooted" tradition ofimmunity applicable to privately employed prison guards.

Opinion of the Court
Correctional services in the United States have undergonevarious transformations. See D. Shichor, Punishment for

Profit 33, 36 (1995) (Shichor). Government-employed prisonguards may have enjoyed a kind of immunity defense arising
out of their status as public employees at common law. See
Procunier v. Navarette, 434 U. S. 555, 561-562 (1978) (ex-tending qualified immunity to state prison guards). But

correctional functions have never been exclusively public.Shichor 33, 36. Private individuals operated local jails in
the 18th century, G. Bowman, S. Hakim, & P. Seidenstat, Pri-vatizing the United States Justice System 271, n. 1 (1992),
and private contractors were heavily involved in prison management during the 19th century. Shichor 33, 36.

During that time, some States, including southern States
like Tennessee, leased their entire prison systems to private
individuals or companies which frequently took complete
control over prison management, including inmate labor and
discipline. G. Bowman, S. Hakim, & P. Seidenstat, Privatizing Correctional Institutions 42 (1993); see generally B.
McKelvey, American Prisons: A Study in American Social
History Prior to 1915, pp. 172-180 (1968) (describing 19thcentury American prison system); see also Shichor 34; G. de
Beaumont & A. de Tocqueville, On the Penitentiary System
in the United States and Its Application in France 35 (1833)
(describing more limited prison contracting system in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania). Private prison lease agreements (like inmate suits) seem to have been more prevalent
after $ 1983's enactment, see generally M. Mancini, One Dies,
Get Another (1996), but we have found evidence that the
common law provided mistreated prisoners in prison leasing
States with remedies against mistreatment by those private
lessors. See, e. g., Dade Coal Co. v. Haslett, 83 Ga. 549, 550-
551, 10 S. E. 435, 435-436 (1889) (convict can recover from
contractor for injuries sustained while on lease to private
company); Boswell v. Barnhart, 96 Ga. 521, 522-523, 23 S. E.
414, 415 (1895) (wife can recover from contractor for chain521US1 Unit: $U83 [11-18-99 20:34:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN

gang-related death of husband); Dahlheim v. Lemon, 45 F.225, 228-230 (1891) (contractor liable for convict injuries);

Tillar v. Reynolds, 96 Ark. 358, 360-361, 365-366, 131 S. W.969, 970, 971-972 (1910) (work farm owner liable for inmate
beating death); Weigel v. Brown, 194 F. 652 (CA8 1912)
(prison contractor liable for unlawful whipping); see also
Edwards v. Pocahontas, 47 F. 268 (CC Va. 1891) (inmate can
recover from municipal corporation for injuries caused bypoor jail conditions);

Hall v. O'Neil Turpentine Co., 56 Fla.
324, 47 So. 609 (1908) (private prison contractor and sub-contractor liable to municipality for escaped prisoner under

lease agreement); see generally Mancini, supra (discussing
abuses of 19th-century private lease system). Yet, we have
found no evidence that the law gave purely private companies or their employees any special immunity from such suits.
Cf. Almango v. Board of Supervisors of Albany County, 32
N. Y. Sup. Ct. 551 (1881) (no cause of action against private
contractor where contractor designated state instrumentality by statute). The case on which the dissent rests its
argument, Williams v. Adams, 85 Mass. 171 (1861) (which
could not--without more--prove the existence of such a
tradition and does not, moreover, clearly involve a private
prison operator) actually supports our point. It suggests
that no immunity from suit would exist for the type of intentional conduct at issue in this case. See ibid. (were "battery" at issue, the case would be of a different "character"
and "the defendant might be responsible"); see id., at 176
(making clear that case only involves claim of ordinary negligence for lack of heat and other items, not "gross negligence," "implied malice," or "intention to do the prisoner any
bodily injury"); cf. Tower v. Glover, 467 U. S. 914, 921 (1984)
(concluding that state public defenders do not enjoy immunity from suit where conduct intentional and no history of
immunity for intentional conduct was established).

Correctional functions in England have been more consistently public, see generally 22 Encyclopedia Brittanica,

521US1 Unit: $U83 [11-18-99 20:34:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
"Prison" 361-368 (11th ed. 1911); S. Webb & B. Webb, Eng-lish Prisons Under Local Government (1922) (Webb), but historical sources indicate that England relied upon private jail-ers to manage the detention of prisoners from the Middle
Ages until well into the 18th century. Shichor 21; see alsoWebb 4-5; 1 E. Coke, Institutes 43 (1797). The common law
forbade those jailers to subject " `their prisoners to any painor torment,' " whether through harsh confinement in leg
irons, or otherwise. See In re Birdsong, 39 F. 599, 601 (SDGa. 1889); 1 Coke,

supra, at 315, 316, 381; 2 C. Addison, ATreatise on the Law of Torts $ 1016, pp. 224-225 (1876); see

also 4 Geo. IV, ch. 64, $ X Twelfth. And it apparently au-thorized prisoner lawsuits to recover damages. 2 Addison,
supra, $ 1016. Apparently the law did provide a kind of im-munity for certain private defendants, such as doctors or
lawyers who performed services at the behest of the sover-eign. See

Tower, supra, at 921; J. Bishop, Commentaries onNon-Contract Law $$ 704, 710 (1889). But we have found no

indication of any more general immunity that might haveapplied to private individuals working for profit.

Our research, including the sources that the parties havecited, reveals that in the 19th century (and earlier) sometimes private contractors and sometimes government itselfcarried on prison management activities. And we have
found no conclusive evidence of a historical tradition ofimmunity for private parties carrying out these functions.
History therefore does not provide significant support forthe immunity claim. Cf. Briscoe v. LaHue, 460 U. S. 325,
330-334 (1983) (immunity for witnesses); Pierson v. Ray, 386U. S. 547, 554-555 (1967) (immunity for judges and police officers); Tenney v. Brandhove, 341 U. S. 367, 372-376 (1951)(immunity for legislators).

C
Whether the immunity doctrine's purposes warrant immu-nity for private prison guards presents a closer question.

Wyatt, consistent with earlier precedent, described the doc521US1 Unit: $U83 [11-18-99 20:34:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN
408 RICHARDSON v. McKNIGHT

Opinion of the Court
trine's purposes as protecting "government's ability to perform its traditional functions" by providing immunity where
"necessary to preserve" the ability of government officials
"to serve the public good or to ensure that talented candidates were not deterred by the threat of damages suits from
entering public service." 504 U. S., at 167. Earlier precedent described immunity as protecting the public from
unwarranted timidity on the part of public officials by, for
example, "encouraging the vigorous exercise of official authority," Butz v. Economou, 438 U. S. 478, 506 (1978), by
contributing to " `principled and fearless decision-making,' "
Wood v. Strickland, 420 U. S. 308, 319 (1975) (quoting Pierson, supra, at 554), and by responding to the concern that
threatened liability would, in Judge Hand's words, " `dampen
the ardour of all but the most resolute, or the most irresponsible,' " public officials, Harlow, 457 U. S., at 814 (quoting
Gregoire v. Biddle, 177 F. 2d 579, 581 (CA2 1949) (L. Hand,
J.), cert. denied, 339 U. S. 949 (1950); see also Mitchell, 472
U. S., at 526 (lawsuits may "distrac[t] officials from their governmental duties").

The guards argue that those purposes support immunity
whether their employer is private or public. Brief for Petitioners 35-36. Since private prison guards perform the
same work as state prison guards, they say, they must require immunity to a similar degree. To say this, however,
is to misread this Court's precedents. The Court has sometimes applied a functional approach in immunity cases, but
only to decide which type of immunity--absolute or qualified--a public officer should receive. See, e. g., Buckley v.
Fitzsimmons, 509 U. S. 259 (1993); Burns v. Reed, 500 U. S.
478 (1991); Forrester v. White, 484 U. S. 219 (1988); Cleavinger v. Saxner, 474 U. S. 193 (1985); Harlow, supra. And
it never has held that the mere performance of a governmental function could make the difference between unlimited $ 1983 liability and qualified immunity, see, e. g., Tower,

521US1 Unit: $U83 [11-18-99 20:34:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN

409Cite as: 521 U. S. 399 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
467 U. S., at 922-923, especially for a private person who
performs a job without government supervision or direction. Indeed a purely functional approach bristles with difficulty, particularly since, in many areas, government and
private industry may engage in fundamentally similar activities, ranging from electricity production, to waste disposal,
to even mail delivery.

Petitioners' argument also overlook certain important differences that, from an immunity perspective, are critical.
First, the most important special government immunityproducing concern--unwarranted timidity--is less likely
present, or at least is not special, when a private company
subject to competitive market pressures operates a prison.
Competitive pressures mean not only that a firm whose
guards are too aggressive will face damages that raise costs,
thereby threatening its replacement, but also that a firm
whose guards are too timid will face threats of replacement
by other firms with records that demonstrate their ability to
do both a safer and a more effective job.

These ordinary marketplace pressures are present here.
The private prison guards before us work for a large, multistate private prison management firm. C. Thomas, D. Bolinger, & J. Badalamenti, Private Adult Correctional Facility
Census 1 (10th ed. 1997) (listing the Corrections Corporation
of America as the largest prison management concern in the
United States). The firm is systematically organized to
perform a major administrative task for profit. Cf. Tenn.
Code Ann. $ 41-24-104 (Supp. 1996) (requiring that firms
contracting with the State demonstrate a history of successful operation of correctional facilities). It performs that
task independently, with relatively less ongoing direct state
supervision. Compare $ 41-4-140(c)(5) (exempting private
jails from certain monitoring) with $ 41-4-116 (requiring inspectors to examine publicly operated county jails once a
month or more) and $ 41-4-140(a) (requiring Tennessee Cor521US1 Unit: $U83 [11-18-99 20:34:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
rectional Institute to inspect public correctional facilities on
an annual basis and to report findings of such inspections).
It must buy insurance sufficient to compensate victims of
civil rights torts. $ 41-24-107. And, since the firm's first
contract expires after three years, $ 41-24-105(a), its performance is disciplined, not only by state review, see $$ 41-
24-105(c)-(f), 41-24-109, but also by pressure from potentially competing firms who can try to take its place. Cf.

$ 41-24-104(a)(4) (permitting State, upon notice, to cancel
contract at any time after first year of operation); see also

$$ 41-24-105(c) and (d) (describing standards for renewal of
contract).

In other words, marketplace pressures provide the private
firm with strong incentives to avoid overly timid, insufficiently vigorous, unduly fearful, or "nonarduous" employee
job performance. And the contract's provisions--including
those that might permit employee indemnification and avoid
many civil-service restrictions--grant this private firm freedom to respond to those market pressures through rewards
and penalties that operate directly upon its employees. See

$ 41-24-111. To this extent, the employees before us resemble those of other private firms and differ from government
employees.

This is not to say that government employees, in their efforts to act within constitutional limits, will always, or often,
sacrifice the otherwise effective performance of their duties.
Rather, it is to say that government employees typically act
within a different system. They work within a system that
is responsible through elected officials to voters who, when
they vote, rarely consider the performance of individual
subdepartments or civil servants specifically and in detail.
And that system is often characterized by multidepartment
civil service rules that, while providing employee security,
may limit the incentives or the ability of individual departments or supervisors flexibly to reward, or to punish, individ521US1 Unit: $U83 [11-18-99 20:34:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
ual employees. Hence a judicial determination that "effectiveness" concerns warrant special immunity-type protection
in respect to this latter (governmental) system does not
prove its need in respect to the former. Consequently, we
can find no special immunity-related need to encourage vigorous performance.

Second, "privatization" helps to meet the immunity-related
need "to ensure that talented candidates" are "not deterred
by the threat of damages suits from entering public service." Wyatt, 504 U. S., at 167; see also Mitchell, 472 U. S.,
at 526 (citing Harlow, 457 U. S., at 816). It does so in part
because of the comprehensive insurance-coverage requirements just mentioned. The insurance increases the likelihood of employee indemnification and to that extent reduces
the employment-discouraging fear of unwarranted liability

potential applicants face. Because privatization law also
frees the private prison-management firm from many civil
service law restraints, Tenn. Code Ann. $ 41-24-111 (1990),
it permits the private firm, unlike a government department,
to offset any increased employee liability risk with higher
pay or extra benefits. In respect to this second governmentimmunity-related purpose then, it is difficult to find a special
need for immunity, for the guards' employer can operate like
other private firms; it need not operate like a typical government department.

Third, lawsuits may well " `distrac[t]' " these employees
" `from their . . . duties,' " Mitchell, supra, at 526 (quoting
Harlow, 457 U. S., at 816), but the risk of "distraction" alone
cannot be sufficient grounds for an immunity. Our qualified
immunity cases do not contemplate the complete elimination
of lawsuit-based distractions. Cf. id., at 818-819 (officials
subject to suit for violations of clearly established rights).
And it is significant that, here, Tennessee law reserves certain important discretionary tasks--those related to prison
discipline, to parole, and to good time--for state officials.

412 RICHARDSON v. McKNIGHT

Opinion of the Court
Tenn. Code Ann. $ 41-24-110 (1990). Given a continual and
conceded need for deterring constitutional violations and
our sense that the firm's tasks are not enormously different
in respect to their importance from various other publicly
important tasks carried out by private firms, we are not
persuaded that the threat of distracting workers from their
duties is enough virtually by itself to justify providing an
immunity. Moreover, Tennessee, which has itself decided
not to extend sovereign immunity to private prison operators (and arguably appreciated that this decision would
increase contract prices to some degree), $ 41-24-107, can
be understood to have anticipated a certain amount of
distraction.

D

Our examination of history and purpose thus reveals nothing special enough about the job or about its organizational
structure that would warrant providing these private prison
guards with a governmental immunity. The job is one that
private industry might, or might not, perform; and which
history shows private firms did sometimes perform without
relevant immunities. The organizational structure is one
subject to the ordinary competitive pressures that normally
help private firms adjust their behavior in response to the
incentives that tort suits provide--pressures not necessarily
present in government departments. Since there are no
special reasons significantly favoring an extension of governmental immunity, and since Wyatt makes clear that private
actors are not automatically immune (i. e., $ 1983 immunity
does not automatically follow $ 1983 liability), we must conclude that private prison guards, unlike those who work directly for the government, do not enjoy immunity from suit
in a $ 1983 case. Cf. Forrester v. White, 484 U. S., at 224
(Officers "who seek exemption from personal liability have
the burden of showing that such an exemption is justified");
see also Butz, 438 U. S., at 506.

Opinion of the Court

III
We close with three caveats. First, we have focused onlyon questions of $ 1983 immunity and have not addressed

whether the defendants are liable under $ 1983 even thoughthey are employed by a private firm. Because the Court of
Appeals assumed, but did not decide, $ 1983 liability, it is forthe District Court to determine whether, under this Court's
decision in Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U. S. 922 (1982),defendants actually acted "under color of state law."

Second, we have answered the immunity question nar-rowly, in the context in which it arose. That context is one
in which a private firm, systematically organized to assumea major lengthy administrative task (managing an institution) with limited direct supervision by the government, un-dertakes that task for profit and potentially in competition
with other firms. The case does not involve a private indi-vidual briefly associated with a government body, serving
as an adjunct to government in an essential governmentalactivity, or acting under close official supervision.

Third, Wyatt explicitly stated that it did not decide whetheror not the private defendants before it might assert, not immunity, but a special "good-faith" defense. The Court said that it

"d[id] not foreclose the possibility that private defend-ants faced with $ 1983 liability under

Lugar v. Edmond-son Oil Co., 457 U. S. 922 (1982), could be entitled to an

affirmative defense based on good faith and/or probablecause or that $ 1983 suits against private, rather than
governmental, parties could require plaintiffs to carryadditional burdens." Wyatt, 504 U. S., at 169.

But because those issues were not fairly before the Court, itleft "them for another day." Ibid. Similarly, the Court of
Appeals in this case limited its holding to the question ofimmunity. It said specifically that it

"may be that the appropriate balance to be struck hereis to permit the correctional officers to assert a good

faith defense, rather than qualified immunity. . . . How-ever, that issue is not before this Court in this interlocutory appeal." 88 F. 3d, at 425.
Like the Court in Wyatt, and the Court of Appeals in thiscase, we do not express a view on this last-mentioned question.

For these reasons the judgment of the Court of Appeals is

Affirmed.

Justice Scalia, with whom The Chief Justice, Justice
Kennedy, and Justice Thomas join, dissenting.

In Procunier v. Navarette, 434 U. S. 555 (1978), we heldthat state prison officials, including both supervisory and

subordinate officers, are entitled to qualified immunity in asuit brought under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983. Today the Court declares that this immunity is unavailable to employees of pri-vate prison management firms, who perform the same duties
as state-employed correctional officials, who exercise themost palpable form of state police power, and who may be
sued for acting "under color of state law." This holding is
supported neither by common-law tradition nor public policy,and contradicts our settled practice of determining $ 1983 immunity on the basis of the public function being performed.

I
The doctrine of official immunity against damages actions
under $ 1983 is rooted in the assumption that that statutedid not abolish those immunities traditionally available at

common law. See Buckley v. Fitzsimmons, 509 U. S. 259,268 (1993). I agree with the Court, therefore, that we must
look to history to resolve this case. I do not agree with theCourt, however, that the petitioners' claim to immunity is
defeated if they cannot provide an actual case, antedatingor contemporaneous with the enactment of $ 1983, in which
immunity was successfully asserted by a private prison

guard. It is only the absence of such a case, and not anyexplicit rejection of immunity by any common-law court, that

the Court relies upon. The opinion observes that privatejailers existed in the 19th century, and that they were successfully sued by prisoners. But one could just as easilyshow that government-employed jailers were successfully
sued at common law, often with no mention of possible immu-nity, see Schellenger, Civil liability of sheriff or other officer
charged with keeping jail or prison for death or injury ofprisoner, 14 A. L. R. 2d 353 (1950) (annotating numerous
cases where sheriffs were held liable). Indeed, as far asmy research has disclosed, there may be more case-law support for immunity in the private-jailer context than inthe government-jailer context. The only pre-$ 1983 jailerimmunity case of any sort that I am aware of is Williams v.Adams, 85 Mass. 171 (1861), decided only 10 years before

$ 1983 became law. And that case, which explicitly acknowl-edged that the issue of jailer immunity was "novel," ibid.,
appears to have conferred immunity upon an independent
contractor.1The truth to tell, Procunier v. Navarette, supra, which

established $ 1983 immunity for state prison guards, did nottrouble itself with history, as our later $ 1983 immunity opin1 Williams held that prisoners could not recover damages for negligence
against the master of a house of correction. That official seems to have
been no more a "public officer" than the head of a private company running
a prison. For example, the governing statute provided that he was to be
paid by the prisoners for his expenses in supporting and employing them,
and in event of their default he was given an action indebitatus assumpsit
for the sum due, "which shall be deemed to be his own proper debt."
Mass. Gen. Stat., ch. 143, $ 15 (1835). If he failed to distribute to the
prisoners those "rations or articles of food, soap, fuel, or other necessaries"
directed by the county commissioner (or the mayor and aldermen of Boston), he was subject to a fine. Id., $ 45. The opinion in Williams says
that "[t]he master of the house of correction is not an independent public
officer, having the same relations to those who are confined therein that
a deputy sheriff has to the parties to a writ committed to him to serve."

ions have done, see, e. g., Burns v. Reed, 500 U. S. 478, 489-490 (1991);

Tower v. Glover, 467 U. S. 914, 920 (1984), but
simply set forth a policy prescription. At this stage in ourjurisprudence it is irrational, and productive of harmful policy consequences, to rely upon lack of case support to create
an artificial limitation upon the scope of a doctrine (prison-guard immunity) that was itself not based on case support.

I say an artificial limitation, because the historical principles on which common-law immunity was based, and which
are reflected in our jurisprudence, plainly cover the pri-vate prison guard if they cover the nonprivate. Those principles are two: (1) immunity is determined by function, not
status, and (2) even more specifically, private status is not
disqualifying.

"[O]ur cases clearly indicate that immunity analysis rests
on functional categories, not on the status of the defendant."
Briscoe v. LaHue, 460 U. S. 325, 342 (1983). Immunity
"flows not from rank or title or `location within the Government,' . . . but from the nature of the responsibilities of the
individual official." Cleavinger v. Saxner, 474 U. S. 193, 201
(1985), quoting Butz v. Economou, 438 U. S. 478 (1978).
"Running through our cases, with fair consistency, is a `functional' approach to immunity questions . . . . Under that
approach, we examine the nature of the functions with which
a particular official or class of officials has been lawfully entrusted, and we seek to evaluate the effect that exposure to
particular forms of liability would likely have on the appropriate exercise of those functions." Forrester v. White,
484 U. S. 219, 224 (1988). See also Buckley, supra, at 269;
Burns, supra, at 484-486; Malley v. Briggs, 475 U. S. 335,
342-343 (1986); Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, 810-811
(1982); Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U. S. 409, 420-429 (1976).
The parties concede that petitioners perform a prototypically governmental function (enforcement of state-imposed
deprivation of liberty), and one that gives rise to qualified
immunity.

Scalia, J., dissenting
The point that function rather than status governs theimmunity determination is demonstrated in a prison-guard

case virtually contemporaneous with the enactment of $ 1983.Alamango v. Board of Supervisors of Albany Cty., 32 N. Y.
Sup. Ct. 551 (1881), held that supervisors charged understate law with maintaining a penitentiary were immune from
prisoner lawsuits. Although they were not formally stateofficers, the court emphasized the irrelevance of this fact:

"The duty of punishing criminals is inherent in theSovereign power. It may be committed to agencies
selected for that purpose, but such agencies, while en-gaged in that duty, stand so far in the place of the State
and exercise its political authority, and do not act in anyprivate capacity."

Id., at 552.2

Private individuals have regularly been accorded immu-nity when they perform a governmental function that qualifies. We have long recognized the absolute immunity ofgrand jurors, noting that like prosecutors and judges they
must "exercise a discretionary judgment on the basis of evi-dence presented to them."

Imbler, 424 U. S., at 423, n. 20."It is the functional comparability of [grand jurors'] judgments to those of the judge that has resulted in [their] beingreferred to as `quasi-judicial' officers, and their immunities
being termed `quasi-judicial' as well." Ibid. Likewise, wit2 The Court cites Alamango for the proposition that there is "no cause
of action against [a] private contractor where [the] contractor [is] designated [a] state instrumentality by statute." Ante, at 406. The opinion
in Alamango, however, does not cite any statutory designation of the supervisors as a "state instrumentality," and does not rely on such a designation for its holding. It does identify the Board of Supervisors as "a mere
instrumentality selected by the State," 32 N. Y. Sup. Ct., at 552, but the
same could be said of the prison management firm here (or the master of
the house of corrections in Williams v. Adams, 85 Mass. 171 (1861), see
n. 1, supra). If one were to accept the Court's distinguishing of this case,
all that would be needed to change the outcome in the present suit is the
pointless formality of designating the contractor a "state instrumentality"--hardly a rational resolution of the question before us.

nesses who testify in court proceedings have enjoyed im-munity, regardless of whether they were government employees. "[T]he common law," we have observed, "providedabsolute immunity from subsequent damages liability for all
persons--governmental or otherwise--who were integralparts of the judicial process."

Briscoe, supra, at 335 (em-phasis added). I think it highly unlikely that we would deny

prosecutorial immunity to those private attorneys increas-ingly employed by various jurisdictions in this country to
conduct high-visibility criminal prosecutions. See, e. g.,Kaplan, State Hires Private Lawyer for Bryant Family Trial,
Los Angeles Times, Apr. 28, 1993, p. B4, col. 2; Estrich, OnBuilding the Strongest Possible Prosecution Team, Los
Angeles Times, July 10, 1994, p. M1, col. 1. There is no morereason for treating private prison guards differently.

II
Later in its opinion, the Court seeks to establish that thereare policy reasons for denying to private prison guards the

immunity accorded to public ones. As I have indicatedabove, I believe that history and not judicially analyzed policy governs this matter--but even on its own terms theCourt's attempted policy distinction is unconvincing. The
Court suggests two differences between civil-service prisonguards and those employed by private prison firms which
preclude any "special" need to give the latter immunity.First, the Court says that "unwarranted timidity" on the
part of private guards is less likely to be a concern, sincetheir companies are subject to market pressures that encourage them to be effective in the performance of their duties.If a private firm does not maintain a proper level of order,
the Court reasons, it will be replaced by another one--sothere is no need for qualified immunity to facilitate the maintenance of order.This is wrong for several reasons. First of all, it is fanciful to speak of the consequences of "market" pressures in a

521US1 Unit: $U83 [11-18-99 20:34:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN

419Cite as: 521 U. S. 399 (1997)
Scalia, J., dissenting
regime where public officials are the only purchaser, andother people's money the medium of payment. Ultimately,

one prison-management firm will be selected to replace an-other prison-management firm only if a decision is made by
some political official not to renew the contract. See Tenn.
Code Ann. $$ 41-24-103 to 105 (Supp. 1996). This is a gov-ernment decision, not a market choice. If state officers turn

out to be more strict in reviewing the cost and performanceof privately managed prisons than of publically managed
ones, it will only be because they have chosen to be so. Theprocess can come to resemble a market choice only to the
extent that political actors will such resemblance--that is,to the extent that political actors (1) are willing to pay attention to the issue of prison services, among the many issues
vying for their attention, and (2) are willing to place consid-erations of cost and quality of service ahead of such political

considerations as personal friendship, political alliances, instate ownership of the contractor, etc. Secondly and more
importantly, however, if one assumes a political regime that
is bent on emulating the market in its purchase of prison
services, it is almost certainly the case that, short of mismanagement so severe as to provoke a prison riot, price (not
discipline) will be the predominating factor in such a regime's selection of a contractor. A contractor's price must
depend upon its costs; lawsuits increase costs; 3 and "fearless"
maintenance of discipline increases lawsuits. The incentive
to down-play discipline will exist, moreover, even in those
States where the politicians' zeal for market emulation and
budget cutting has waned, and where prison-management

3 This is true even of successfully defended lawsuits, and even of lawsuits that have been insured against. The Court thinks it relevant to the
factor I am currently discussing that the private prison-management firm
"must buy insurance sufficient to compensate victims of civil rights torts,"
ante, at 410. Belief in the relevance of this factor must be traceable,
ultimately, to belief in the existence of a free lunch. Obviously, as civilrights claims increase, the cost of civil-rights insurance increases.

521US1 Unit: $U83 [11-18-99 20:34:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN
420 RICHARDSON v. McKNIGHT

Scalia, J., dissenting
contract renewal is virtually automatic: the more cautious
the prison guards, the fewer the lawsuits, the higher the
profits. In sum, it seems that "market-competitive" private
prison managers have even greater need than civil-service
prison managers for immunity as an incentive to discipline.

The Court's second distinction between state and private
prisons is that privatization "helps to meet the immunityrelated need to ensure that talented candidates are not deterred by the threat of damages suits from entering public
service" as prison guards. Ante, at 411 (internal quotation
marks omitted). This is so because privatization brings
with it (or at least has brought with it in the case before us)
(1) a statutory requirement for insurance coverage against
civil-rights claims, which assertedly "increases the likelihood
of employee indemnification," and (2) a liberation "from
many civil service law restraints" which prevent increased
employee risk from being "offset . . . with higher pay or extra
benefits," ibid. As for the former (civil-rights liability insurance): surely it is the availability of that protection,
rather than its actual presence in the case at hand, which
decreases (if it does decrease, which I doubt) the need for
immunity protection. (Otherwise, the Court would have to
say that a private prison-management firm that is not required to purchase insurance, and does not do so, is more
entitled to immunity; and that a government-run prison system that does purchase insurance is less entitled to immunity.) And of course civil-rights liability insurance is no less
available to public entities than to private employers. But
the second factor--liberation from civil-service limitations--
is the more interesting one. First of all, simply as a philosophical matter it is fascinating to learn that one of the prime
justifications for $ 1983 immunity should be a phenomenon
(civil-service laws) that did not even exist when $ 1983 was
enacted and the immunity created. Also as a philosophical
matter, it is poetic justice (or poetic revenge) that the Court

521US1 Unit: $U83 [11-18-99 20:34:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN

421Cite as: 521 U. S. 399 (1997)
Scalia, J., dissenting
should use one of the principal economic benefits of "prison
out-sourcing"--namely, the avoidance of civil-service salary
and tenure encrustations--as the justification for a legal rule
rendering out-sourcing more expensive. Of course the savings attributable to out-sourcing will not be wholly lost as a
result of today's holding; they will be transferred in part
from the public to prisoner-plaintiffs and to lawyers. It is a
result that only the American Bar Association and the American Federation of Government Employees could love. But
apart from philosophical fascination, this second factor is
subject to the same objection as the first: governments need
not have civil-service salary encrustations (or can exempt
prisons from them); and hence governments, no more than
private prison employers, have any need for $ 1983 immunity.

There is one more possible rationale for denying immunity
to private prison guards worth discussing, albeit briefly. It
is a theory so implausible that the Court avoids mentioning
it, even though it was the primary reason given in the Court
of Appeals decision that the Court affirms. McKnight v.
Rees, 88 F. 3d 417, 424-425 (CA6 1996). It is that officers of
private prisons are more likely than officers of state prisons
to violate prisoners' constitutional rights because they work
for a profit motive, and hence an added degree of deterrence
is needed to keep these officers in line. The Court of Appeals offered no evidence to support its bald assertion that
private prison guards operate with different incentives than
state prison guards, and gave no hint as to how prison
guards might possibly increase their employers' profits by
violating constitutional rights. One would think that private prison managers, whose $ 1983 damages come out of
their own pockets, as compared with public prison managers,
whose $ 1983 damages come out of the public purse, would,
if anything, be more careful in training their employees to
avoid constitutional infractions. And in fact, States having
experimented with prison privatization commonly report

that the overall caliber of the services provided to prisonershas actually improved in scope and quality. Matters Relating To The Federal Bureau Of Prisons: Hearing before theSubcommittee on Crime of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 104th Cong., 1st Sess., 110 (1995).

* * *
In concluding, I must observe that since there is no appar-ent

reason, neither in history nor in policy, for making immu-nity hinge upon the Court's distinction between public and

private guards, the precise nature of that distinction mustalso remain obscure. Is it privity of contract that separates
the two categories--so that guards paid directly by the Stateare "public" prison guards and immune, but those paid by a
prison-management company "private" prison guards andnot immune? Or is it rather "employee" versus "independent contractor" status--so that even guards whose compen-sation is paid directly by the State are not immune if they
are not also supervised by a state official? Or is perhapsstate supervision alone (without direct payment) enough to
confer immunity? Or is it (as the Court's characterizationof Alamango, see n. 2, supra, suggests) the formal designation of the guards, or perhaps of the guards' employer, as a"state instrumentality" that makes the difference? Since,
as I say, I see no sense in the public-private distinction, nei-ther do I see what precisely it consists of.

Today's decision says that two sets of prison guards whoare indistinguishable in the ultimate source of their authority
over prisoners, indistinguishable in the powers that theypossess over prisoners, and indistinguishable in the duties
that they owe toward prisoners, are to be treated quite dif-ferently in the matter of their financial liability. The only
sure effect of today's decision--and the only purpose, as faras I can tell--is that it will artificially raise the cost of privatizing prisons. Whether this will cause privatization to beprohibitively expensive, or instead simply divert state funds

as a consequence. Neither our precedent, nor the historicalfoundations of $ 1983, nor the policies underlying $ 1983, support this result.I respectfully dissent.

METRO-NORTH COMMUTER RAILROAD CO.

v. BUCKLEY

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe second circuit

No. 96-320. Argued February 18, 1997--Decided June 23, 1997
Respondent Buckley was exposed to insulation dust containing asbestos

while employed as a pipefitter by petitioner railroad. Since attending
an asbestos awareness class, he has feared, with some cause, that he
will develop cancer. Thus far, periodic medical checkups have revealed
no evidence of asbestos-related disease. Buckley filed suit under the
Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA)--which permits a railroad
worker to recover for an "injury . . . resulting from" his employer's
"negligence," 45 U. S. C. $ 51--seeking damages for negligently inflicted
emotional distress and to cover the cost of future checkups. The District Court dismissed the suit after hearing Buckley's case, finding that,
because there had been no physical impact from his exposure, the FELA
did not permit recovery for his emotional injury. See Consolidated
Rail Corporation v. Gottshall, 512 U. S. 532. It did not discuss his
medical monitoring claim. In reversing, the Second Circuit held that
his contact with the insulation dust was what the Gottshall Court had
called a "physical impact" that, when present, permits a FELA plaintiff
to recover for accompanying emotional distress, and that he could also
recover the costs of checkups made necessary by the exposure.

Held:

1. Buckley cannot recover emotional distress damages unless, and
until, he manifests symptoms of a disease. Pp. 428-438.

(a) The critical issue is whether Buckley's physical contact with insulation dust amounts to a "physical impact" as that term was used in
Gottshall, an emotional distress case. In interpreting the word "injury" in FELA $ 1, the Gottshall Court set forth several general legal
principles applicable here: The FELA's purpose is basically humanitarian; the FELA expressly abolishes or modifies a host of common-law
limitations on recovery; it should be interpreted liberally, but liability
rests upon negligence and the railroad is not an insurer for all employee
injuries; and those common-law principles not rejected in the statute's
text are entitled to great weight in interpreting the FELA and play a
significant role in determining whether, or when, an employee can recover damages for negligently inflicted emotional distress. The Court
also identified more specific legal propositions: The common law of torts
does not permit recovery for negligently inflicted emotional distress

Syllabus
unless the distress falls within specific categories that amount to
recovery-permitting exceptions; and FELA $ 1, mirroring many States'
law, allows recovery for such distress where a plaintiff satisfies the
common law's "zone of danger" test, which permits plaintiffs to recover
for emotional injury if they sustain a physical impact from, or are
placed in immediate risk of physical harm by, a defendant's negligence.
Pp. 428-430.

(b) The "physical impact" to which Gottshall referred does not include a simple physical contact with a substance that might cause a
disease at a substantially later time--where that substance, or related
circumstance, threatens no harm other than that disease-related risk.
First, each of the many state cases that Gottshall cited in support of
the "zone of danger" test involved a threatened physical contact that
caused, or might have caused, immediate traumatic harm. Second,
Gottshall's language, read in light of this precedent, seems similarly
limited. Third, with only a few exceptions, common-law courts have
denied recovery for emotional distress to plaintiffs who, like Buckley,
are disease and symptom free. Fourth, general policy reasons to which
Gottshall referred in explaining why common-law courts have restricted recovery for certain classes of negligently caused harms, see
512 U. S., at 557, are present in this case. Thus, there is no legal basis
for adopting the Second Circuit's emotional distress recovery rule.
Pp. 430-436.

(c) Buckley's several arguments in reply--that his evidence of
exposure and enhanced mortality risk is as strong a proof as an accompanying physical symptom of genuine emotional distress, that a series
of common-law cases support his position, and that the FELA's "humanitarian" nature warrants a holding in his favor--are unpersuasive.
Pp. 436-438.

2. Buckley has not shown that he is legally entitled to recover medical
monitoring costs. Insofar as the Second Circuit's opinion suggests it
intended to apply the basic damages law principle that a plaintiff can
recover medical expenses reasonably related to an underlying injury,
the holding that the emotional distress here is not a compensable injury
also requires reversal on this point. Insofar as the court rested its
holding upon the broader ground that medical monitoring costs themselves represent a separate negligently caused economic injury for
which FELA recovery is possible, it suggests the existence of a tort law
cause of action permitting the recovery of medical cost damages in a
lump sum and irrespective of insurance, a holding beyond the bounds of
the "evolving common law" as it currently stands. Gottshall, supra, at
558. The cases authorizing recovery for medical monitoring for asymptomatic plaintiffs do not endorse such a full-blown, traditional tort law
cause of action, but have instead suggested, or imposed, special limita521US1 Unit: $U84 [11-18-99 20:42:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tions on that remedy. Given the mix of competing general policy considerations identified in Gottshall, Buckley's policy-based arguments
that the FELA contains such an unqualified tort liability rule are
unconvincing. Pp. 438-444.

Opinion of the Court
Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA or Act), 35 Stat. 65,as amended, 45 U. S. C. $ 51 et seq., for negligently inflicted

emotional distress. We conclude that the worker before ushere cannot recover unless, and until, he manifests symptoms
of a disease. We also consider a related claim for medicalmonitoring costs, and we hold, for reasons set out below, that
the respondent in this case has not shown that he is legallyentitled to recover those costs.

I
Respondent, Michael Buckley, works as a pipefitter forMetro-North, a railroad. For three years (1985-1988) his

job exposed him to asbestos for about one hour per workingday. During that time Buckley would remove insulation
from pipes, often covering himself with insulation dust thatcontained asbestos. Since 1987, when he attended an "asbestos awareness" class, Buckley has feared that he woulddevelop cancer--and with some cause, for his two expert witnesses testified that, even after taking account of his now-discarded 15-year habit of smoking up to a pack of cigarettes
per day, the exposure created an added risk of death due tocancer, or to other asbestos-related diseases, of either 1% to
5% (in the view of one of plaintiff 's experts), or 1% to 3%(in the view of another). Since 1989, Buckley has received
periodic medical checkups for cancer and asbestosis. So far,those checkups have not revealed any evidence of cancer or
any other asbestos-related disease.Buckley sued Metro-North under the FELA, a statute
that permits a railroad worker to recover for an "injury . . .resulting . . . from" his employer's "negligence." 45 U. S. C.

$ 51. He sought damages for his emotional distress and tocover the cost of future medical checkups. His employer
conceded negligence, but it did not concede that Buckley hadactually suffered emotional distress, and it argued that the
FELA did not permit a worker like Buckley, who had suf-fered no physical harm, to recover for injuries of either sort.

428 METRO-NORTH COMMUTER R. CO. v. BUCKLEY

Opinion of the Court
After hearing Buckley's case, the District Court dismissedthe action. The court found that Buckley did not "offer sufficient evidence to allow a jury to find that he suffered a realemotional injury." App. 623. And, in any event, Buckley
suffered no "physical impact"; hence any emotional injuryfell outside the limited set of circumstances in which, according to this Court, the FELA permits recovery. Id., at 620;see

Consolidated Rail Corporation v. Gottshall, 512 U. S.532 (1994). The District Court did not discuss Buckley's further claim for the costs of medical monitoring.Buckley appealed, and the Second Circuit reversed. 79 F.
3d 1337 (1996). Buckley's evidence, it said, showed that hiscontact with the insulation dust (containing asbestos) was
"massive, lengthy, and tangible," id., at 1345, and that thecontact "would cause fear in a reasonable person,"

id., at1344. Under these circumstances, the court held, the contact was what this Court in Gottshall had called a "physicalimpact"--a "physical impact" that, when present, permits a
FELA plaintiff to recover for accompanying emotional dis-tress. The Second Circuit also found in certain of Buckley's
workplace statements sufficient expression of worry to per-mit sending his emotional distress claim to a jury. Finally,
the court held that Buckley could recover for the costs ofmedical checkups because the FELA permits recovery of all
reasonably incurred extra medical monitoring costs when-ever a "reasonable physician would prescribe . . . a monitoring regime different than the one that would have been pre-scribed in the absence of " a particular negligently caused
exposure to a toxic substance. 79 F. 3d, at 1347 (internalquotation marks omitted).

We granted certiorari to review the Second Circuit's hold-ings in light of Gottshall.

II
The critical question before us in respect to Buckley's"emotional distress" claim is whether the physical contact

with insulation dust that accompanied his emotional distress

429Cite as: 521 U. S. 424 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
amounts to a "physical impact" as this Court used that termin

Gottshall. In Gottshall, an emotional distress case, the
Court interpreted the word "injury" in FELA $ 1, a provi-sion that makes "[e]very common carrier by railroad . . . liable in damages to any person suffering injury while . . . employed" by the carrier if the "injury" results from carrier"negligence." 45 U. S. C. $ 51. In doing so, it initially set

forth several general legal principles applicable here. Gottshall described FELA's purposes as basically "humanitarian." Gottshall, supra, at 542; see also, e. g., Urie v. Thompson, 337 U. S. 163 (1949). It pointed out that the Act
expressly abolishes or modifies a host of common-law doctrines that previously had limited recovery. See, e. g., 45
U. S. C. $$ 51, 53, and 54. It added that this Court has interpreted the Act's language "liberally" in light of its humanitarian purposes. Gottshall, supra, at 543. But, at the same
time, the Court noted that liability under the Act rests upon
"negligence" and that the Act does not make the railroad
" `the insurer' " for all employee injuries. 512 U. S., at 543
(quoting Ellis v. Union Pacific R. Co., 329 U. S. 649, 653
(1947)). The Court stated that "common-law principles,"
where not rejected in the text of the statute, "are entitled
to great weight" in interpreting the Act, and that those principles "play a significant role" in determining whether, or
when, an employee can recover damages for "negligent infliction of emotional distress." 512 U. S., at 544. See also
id., at 558 (Souter, J., concurring) (Court's duty "in interpreting FELA . . . is to develop a federal common law of
negligence . . . informed by reference to the evolving common
law"); Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co. v. Buell, 480 U. S. 557
(1987).

The Court also set forth several more specific legal propositions. It recognized that the common law of torts does not
permit recovery for negligently inflicted emotional distress
unless the distress falls within certain specific categories
that amount to recovery-permitting exceptions. The law,

430 METRO-NORTH COMMUTER R. CO. v. BUCKLEY

Opinion of the Court
for example, does permit recovery for emotional distresswhere that distress accompanies a physical injury, see,

e. g.,
Simmons v. Pacor, Inc., 543 Pa. 664, 678, 674 A. 2d 232, 239(1996); Restatement (Second) of Torts $ 924(a) (1977), and it

often permits recovery for distress suffered by a close relative who witnesses the physical injury of a negligence victim,
e. g., Dillon v. Legg, 68 Cal. 2d 728, 441 P. 2d 912 (1968);
Gottshall, 512 U. S., at 549, n. 10 (citing cases). The Courtthen held that FELA $ 1, mirroring the law of many States,

sometimes permitted recovery "for damages for negligent in-fliction of emotional distress,"

id., at 550, and, in particular,
it does so where a plaintiff seeking such damages satisfiesthe common law's "zone of danger" test. It defined that test

by stating that the law permits "recovery for emotional injury" by

"those plaintiffs who sustain a physical impact as aresult of a defendant's negligent conduct, or who are

placed in immediate risk of physical harm by that conduct." Id., at 547-548 (emphasis added).

The case before us, as we have said, focuses on the itali-cized words "physical impact." The Second Circuit interpreted those words as including a simple physical contactwith a substance that might cause a disease at a future time,
so long as the contact was of a kind that would "cause fear
in a reasonable person." 79 F. 3d, at 1344. In our view,however, the "physical impact" to which

Gottshall referred
does not include a simple physical contact with a substancethat might cause a disease at a substantially later time--

where that substance, or related circumstance, threatens no
harm other than that disease-related risk.

First, Gottshall cited many state cases in support of its
adoption of the "zone of danger" test quoted above. And in
each case where recovery for emotional distress was permitted, the case involved a threatened physical contact that
caused, or might have caused, immediate traumatic harm.

S. W. 2d 141 (Ky. 1980) (holding that exposure to X rays was
"physical contact" supporting recovery for emotional suffering where immediate physical harm to fetus was suspected).

Second, Gottshall's language, read in light of this precedent, seems similarly limited. 512 U. S., at 555 ("zone of
danger test . . . is consistent with FELA's central focus on
physical perils"); id., at 556 (quoting Lancaster v. Norfolk &
Western R. Co., 773 F. 2d 807, 813 (CA7 1985)) (FELA seeks
to protect workers " `from physical invasions or menaces' "),
cert. denied, 480 U. S. 945 (1987); 512 U. S., at 556 (employer
should be liable for "emotional injury caused by the apprehension of physical impact"); id., at 547-548 (quoting Pearson, Liability to Bystanders for Negligently Inflicted Emotional Harm--A Comment on the Nature of Arbitrary Rules,

Opinion of the Court
34 U. Fla. L. Rev. 477, 488-489 (1982)) (" `[T]hose within thezone of danger of physical impact' " should be able to " `recover for fright' " because " `a near miss may be as frighten-ing as a direct hit' ").

Taken together, language and cited precedent indicate that
the words "physical impact" do not encompass every form of"physical contact." And, in particular, they do not include

a contact that amounts to no more than an exposure--anexposure, such as that before us, to a substance that poses
some future risk of disease and which contact causes emo-tional distress only because the worker learns that he may
become ill after a substantial period of time.

Third, common-law precedent does not favor the plaintiff.
Common-law courts do permit a plaintiff who suffers from a
disease to recover for related negligently caused emotional
distress, see supra, at 429, and some courts permit a plaintiff
who exhibits a physical symptom of exposure to recover, see,
e. g., Herber v. Johns-Manville Corp., 785 F. 2d 79, 85 (CA3
1986); Mauro v. Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., 225 N. J.
Super. 196, 542 A. 2d 16 (App. Div. 1988). But with only a
few exceptions, common-law courts have denied recovery to
those who, like Buckley, are disease and symptom free.
E. g., Burns v. Jacquays Mining Corp., 156 Ariz. 375, 752 P.
2d 28 (Ct. App. 1987), review dism'd, 162 Ariz. 186, 781 P. 2d

recovery for fear of cancer in a negligence action unless
plaintiff is "more likely than not" to develop cancer).Fourth, the general policy reasons to which

Gottshall referred--in its explanation of why common-law courts haverestricted recovery for emotional harm to cases falling

within rather narrowly defined categories--militate againstan expansive definition of "physical impact" here. Those
reasons include: (a) special "difficult[y] for judges and juries"
in separating valid, important claims from those that are invalid or "trivial," Gottshall, 512 U. S., at 557; (b) a threat
of "unlimited and unpredictable liability," ibid.; and (c) the
"potential for a flood" of comparatively unimportant, or
"trivial," claims, ibid.

To separate meritorious and important claims from invalid
or trivial claims does not seem easier here than in other
cases in which a plaintiff might seek recovery for typical negligently caused emotional distress. The facts before us illustrate the problem. The District Court, when concluding
that Buckley had failed to present "sufficient evidence to
allow a jury to find . . . a real emotional injury," pointed out
that, apart from Buckley's own testimony, there was virtually no evidence of distress. App. 623-625. Indeed, Buckley continued to work with insulating material "even though
. . . he could have transferred" elsewhere, he "continued to
smoke cigarettes" despite doctors' warnings, and his doctor
did not refer him "either to a psychologist or to a social
worker." Id., at 624. The Court of Appeals reversed because it found certain objective corroborating evidence,
namely, "workers' complaints to supervisors and investigative bodies." 79 F. 3d, at 1346. Both kinds of "objective"
evidence--the confirming and disconfirming evidence--seem
only indirectly related to the question at issue, the existence

434 METRO-NORTH COMMUTER R. CO. v. BUCKLEY

Opinion of the Court
and seriousness of Buckley's claimed emotional distress.Yet, given the difficulty of separating valid from invalid emotional injury claims, the evidence before us may typify thekind of evidence to which parties and the courts would have
to look.

The Court in Gottshall made a similar point:

"[T]esting for the `genuineness' of an injury alone . . .would be bound to lead to haphazard results. Judges

would be forced to make highly subjective determina-tions concerning the authenticity of claims for emotional
injury, which are far less susceptible to objective medical proof than are their physical counterparts. To theextent the genuineness test could limit potential liability, it could do so only inconsistently." 512 U. S., at 552.
And Justice Ginsburg, too, in her opinion concurring in
the judgment in part and dissenting in part, seems to recog-nize this problem, for she would limit recovery in emotional

injury cases to those who can show more objective evidencethan simply having expressed fear and concern to supervisors. See post, at 445.More important, the physical contact at issue here--a simple (though extensive) contact with a carcinogenic sub-stance--does not seem to offer much help in separating valid
from invalid emotional distress claims. That is because contacts, even extensive contacts, with serious carcinogens arecommon. See,

e. g., Nicholson, Perkel, & Selikoff, Occupational Exposure to Asbestos: Population at Risk and Pro-jected Mortality--1980-2030, 3 Am. J. Indust. Med. 259

(1982) (estimating that 21 million Americans have been exposed to work-related asbestos); U. S. Dept. of Health and
Human Services, 1 Seventh Annual Report on Carcinogens
71 (1994) (3 million workers exposed to benzene, a majority
of Americans exposed outside the workplace); Pirkle, et al.,
Exposure of the U S Population to Environmental Tobacco
Smoke, 275 JAMA 1233, 1237 (1996) (reporting that 43% of

521US1 Unit: $U84 [11-18-99 20:42:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN

435Cite as: 521 U. S. 424 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
American children lived in a home with at least one smoker,and 37% of adult nonsmokers lived in a home with at least

one smoker or reported environmental tobacco smoke atwork). They may occur without causing serious emotional
distress, but sometimes they do cause distress, and reasonably so, for cancer is both an unusually threatening and unusu-ally frightening disease. See Statistical Abstract of United

States 94 (1996) (23.5% of Americans who died in 1994 diedof cancer); American Cancer Society, Cancer Facts & Figures--1997, p. 1 (half of all men and one-third of all womenwill develop cancer). The relevant problem, however, remains one of evaluating a claimed emotional reaction to an
increased risk of dying. An external circumstance--exposure--makes some emotional distress more likely. But how
can one determine from the external circumstance of exposure whether, or when, a claimed strong emotional reaction
to an increased mortality risk (say, from 23% to 28%) is reasonable and genuine, rather than overstated--particularly
when the relevant statistics themselves are controversial
and uncertain (as is usually the case), and particularly since
neither those exposed nor judges or juries are experts in
statistics? The evaluation problem seems a serious one.

The large number of those exposed and the uncertainties
that may surround recovery also suggest what Gottshall
called the problem of "unlimited and unpredictable liability."
Does such liability mean, for example, that the costs associated with a rule of liability would become so great that,
given the nature of the harm, it would seem unreasonable to
require the public to pay the higher prices that may result?
Cf. Priest, The Current Insurance Crisis and Modern Tort
Law, 96 Yale L. J. 1521, 1585-1587 (1987). The same characteristics further suggest what Gottshall called the problem
of a "flood" of cases that, if not "trivial," are comparatively
less important. In a world of limited resources, would a
rule permitting immediate large-scale recoveries for widespread emotional distress caused by fear of future disease

436 METRO-NORTH COMMUTER R. CO. v. BUCKLEY

Opinion of the Court
diminish the likelihood of recovery by those who later sufferfrom the disease? Cf. J. Weinstein, Individual Justice in

Mass Tort Litigation 10-11, 141 (1995); Schuck, The WorstShould Go First: Deferral Registries in Asbestos Litigation,
15 Harv. J. L. & Pub. Pol'y 541 (1992).

We do not raise these questions to answer them (for we donot have the answers), but rather to show that general policy

concerns of a kind that have led common-law courts to denyrecovery for certain classes of negligently caused harms are
present in this case as well. That being so, we cannot findin

Gottshall's underlying rationale any basis for departing
from Gottshall's language and precedent or from the current
common-law consensus. That is to say, we cannot find in
Gottshall's language, cited precedent, other common-law
precedent, or related concerns of policy a legal basis for
adopting the emotional distress recovery rule adopted by the
Court of Appeals.

Buckley raises several important arguments in reply. He
points out, for example, that common-law courts do permit
recovery for emotional distress where a plaintiff has physical
symptoms; and he argues that his evidence of exposure and
enhanced mortality risk is as strong a proof as an accompanying physical symptom that his emotional distress is
genuine.

This argument, however, while important, overlooks the
fact that the common law in this area does not examine the
genuineness of emotional harm case by case. Rather, it has
developed recovery-permitting categories the contours of
which more distantly reflect this, and other, abstract general
policy concerns. The point of such categorization is to deny
courts the authority to undertake a case-by-case examination. The common law permits emotional distress recovery
for that category of plaintiffs who suffer from a disease (or
exhibit a physical symptom), for example, thereby finding a
special effort to evaluate emotional symptoms warranted in
that category of cases--perhaps from a desire to make a

Opinion of the Court
physically injured victim whole or because the parties arelikely to be in court in any event. In other cases, however,

falling outside the special recovery-permitting categories, ithas reached a different conclusion. The relevant question
here concerns the validity of a rule that seeks to redefine
such a category. It would not be easy to redefine "physicalimpact" in terms of a rule that turned on, say, the "massive,

lengthy, [or] tangible" nature of a contact that amounted toan exposure, whether to contaminated water, or to germladen air, or to carcinogen-containing substances, such asinsulation dust containing asbestos. But, in any event, for
the reasons we have stated, supra, at 430-436, we cannot
find that the common law has done so.

Buckley also points to a series of common-law cases that
he believes offer him support. Many of these cases, however, find that the plaintiff at issue fell within a category
where the law already permitted recovery for emotional distress. E. g., Marchica v. Long Island R. Co., 31 F. 3d 1197
(CA2 1994) (traumatic injury); Clark v. Taylor, 710 F. 2d 4
(CA1 1983) (intentional infliction of harm); Laxton v. Orkin
Exterminating Co., 639 S. W. 2d 431, 433-434 (Tenn. 1982)
(nuisance claim); Lavelle v. Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp.,
30 Ohio Misc. 2d 11, 507 N. E. 2d 476 (Ct. Common Pleas,
Cayahoga Cty. 1987) (emotional distress damages sought by
asbestosis-afflicted plaintiff). We have found only three
asbestos-related cases, all involving state law, that support
Buckley directly. Watkins v. Fibreboard Corp., 994 F. 2d
253, 259 (CA5 1993) (Texas law) (recognizing cause of action
for emotional distress based on exposures to asbestos in the
absence of physical symptoms); In re Moorenovich, 634
F. Supp. 634 (Me. 1986) (Maine law) (same); Gerardi v. Nuclear Utility Services, Inc., 149 Misc. 2d 657, 566 N. Y. S.
2d 1002 (Westchester Cty. 1991) (same). None of them was
decided by the highest court of the relevant State. And we
do not find that minority view a sufficient basis for reaching
Buckley's proposed conclusion.

438 METRO-NORTH COMMUTER R. CO. v. BUCKLEY

Opinion of the Court
Finally, Buckley argues that the "humanitarian" nature ofthe FELA warrants a holding in his favor. We do not doubt

that the FELA's purpose militates in favor of recovery for aserious and negligently caused emotional harm. Cf. Gottshall, 512 U. S., at 550. But just as courts must interpretthat law to take proper account of the harms suffered by a
sympathetic individual plaintiff, so they must consider thegeneral impact, on workers as well as employers, of the general liability rules they would thereby create. Here the rel-evant question concerns not simply recovery in an individual
case, but the consequences and effects of a rule of law that
would permit that recovery. And if the common law con-cludes that a legal rule permitting recovery here, from a tort

law perspective, and despite benefits in some individualcases, would on balance cause more harm than good, and if
we find that judgment reasonable, we cannot find that con-clusion inconsistent with the FELA's humanitarian purpose.

III
Buckley also sought recovery for a different kind of "in-jury," namely, the economic cost of the extra medical checkups that he expects to incur as a result of his exposure toasbestos-laden insulation dust. The District Court, when it
dismissed the action, did not discuss this aspect of Buckley'scase. But the Second Circuit, when reversing the District
Court, held that "a reasonable jury could award" Buckleythe "costs" of "medical monitoring" in this case. 79 F. 3d,
at 1347. We agreed to decide whether the court correctlyfound that the FELA permitted a plaintiff without symptoms or disease to recover this economic loss.The parties do not dispute--and we assume--that an exposed plaintiff can recover related reasonable medical moni-toring costs if and when he develops symptoms. As the
Second Circuit pointed out, a plaintiff injured through negli-gence can recover related reasonable medical expenses as
an element of damages. Ibid. (citing C. McCormick, Law of

521US1 Unit: $U84 [11-18-99 20:42:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
Damages $ 90 (1935)); see also Restatement (Second) of Torts$ 924(c) (1977); J. Stein, Stein on Personal Injury Damages

$ 5.18 (2d ed. 1991). No one has argued that any differentprinciple would apply in the case of a plaintiff whose "injury"
consists of a disease, a symptom, or those sorts of emotional
distress that fall within the FELA's definition of "injury."See Part II,

supra. Much of the Second Circuit's opinion
suggests it intended only to apply this basic principle of thelaw of damages. See,

e. g., 79 F. 3d, at 1342 ("[T]his case
turns upon whether . . . emotional harm . . . is an injurycompensable under FELA");

id., at 1347 (monitoring costs
are a "traditional element of tort damages"). Insofar as that
is so, Part II of our opinion, holding that the emotional distress at issue here is not a compensable "injury," requires
reversal on this point as well.

Other portions of the Second Circuit's opinion, however,
indicate that it may have rested this portion of its decision
upon a broader ground, namely, that medical monitoring
costs themselves represent a separate negligently caused
economic "injury," 45 U. S. C. $ 51, for which a negligently
exposed FELA plaintiff (including a plaintiff without disease
or symptoms) may recover to the extent that the medical
monitoring costs that a reasonable physician would prescribe
for the plaintiff exceed the medical monitoring costs that
"would have been prescribed in the absence of [the] exposure." 79 F. 3d, at 1347 (citation omitted). This portion of
the opinion, when viewed in light of Buckley's straightforward claim for an "amount of money" sufficient to "compensate" him for "future medical monitoring expenses," Plaintiff 's Proposed Charges to the Jury 25, Record, Doc. 33,
suggests the existence of an ordinary, but separate, tort law
cause of action permitting (as tort law ordinarily permits)
the recovery of medical cost damages in the form of a lump
sum, see Stein, supra, at $$ 5.1 and 5.18, and irrespective of
insurance, Restatement (Second) of Torts, supra, $ 920A(2).
As so characterized, the Second Circuit's holding, in our

440 METRO-NORTH COMMUTER R. CO. v. BUCKLEY

Opinion of the Court
view, went beyond the bounds of currently "evolving com-mon law."

Gottshall, supra, at 558 (Souter, J., concurring).
Guided by the parties' briefs, we have canvassed thestate-law cases that have considered whether the negligent

causation of this kind of harm (i. e., causing a plaintiff,
through negligent exposure to a toxic substance, to incurmedical monitoring costs) by itself constitutes a sufficient

basis for a tort recovery. We have found no other FELAdecisions. We have put to the side several cases that involve special recovery-permitting circumstances, such as thepresence of a traumatic physical impact, or the presence of a
physical symptom, which for reasons explained in Part II areimportant but beside the point here. See,

e. g., Friends for
All Children, Inc. v. Lockheed Aircraft Corp., 746 F. 2d 816,
824-825 (CADC 1984) (traumatic impact); Hagerty v. L & L
Marine Services, Inc., 788 F. 2d 315, modified, 797 F. 2d 256
(CA5 1986) (same); Simmons v. Pacor, Inc., 543 Pa. 664, 674A. 2d 232 (1996) (physical symptom). We have noted that

federal courts, interpreting state law, have come to differentconclusions about the matter. Compare,

e. g., In re Paoli R.
Yard PCB Litigation, 916 F. 2d 829 (CA3 1990) (Pennsylva-nia law), with

Ball v. Joy Technologies, Inc., 958 F. 2d 36
(CA4 1991) (West Virginia and Virginia law). And we have
ended up focusing on several important State Supreme
Court cases that have permitted recovery. Ayers v. Jackson, 106 N. J. 557, 525 A. 2d 287 (1987); Hansen v. Mountain
Fuel Supply Co., 858 P. 2d 970 (Utah 1993); Potter v. Firestone Tire & Rubber Co., 6 Cal. 4th 965, 863 P. 2d 795 (1993);
see also Burns v. Jacquays Mining Corp., 156 Ariz. 375, 752
P. 2d 28 (App. 1987).

We find it sufficient to note, for present purposes, that the
cases authorizing recovery for medical monitoring in the
absence of physical injury do not endorse a full-blown, traditional tort law cause of action for lump-sum damages--of
the sort that the Court of Appeals seems to have endorsed
here. Rather, those courts, while recognizing that medical
monitoring costs can amount to a harm that justifies a tort

521US1 Unit: $U84 [11-18-99 20:42:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
remedy, have suggested, or imposed, special limitations onthat remedy. Compare

Ayers, supra, at 608, 525 A. 2d, at
314 (recommending in future cases creation of "a court-supervised fund to administer medical-surveillance payments"); Hansen, supra, at 982 (suggesting insurance mechanism or court-supervised fund as proper remedy); Potter,
supra, at 1010, n. 28, 863 P. 2d, at 825, n. 28 (suggesting that
a lump-sum damages award would be inappropriate); Burns,
supra, at 381, 752 P. 2d, at 34 (holding that lump-sum damages are not appropriate), with, e. g., Honeycutt v. Walden,294 Ark. 440, 743 S. W. 2d 809 (1988) (damages award for

future medical expenses made necessary by physical injuryare awarded as lump-sum payment);

Rice v. Hill, 315 Pa. 166,
172 A. 289 (1934) (same); and Restatement (Second) of Torts

$ 920A(2) (1977) (ordinarily fact that plaintiff is insured isirrelevant to amount of tort recovery). Cf. Weinstein, Individual Justice in Mass Tort Litigation, at 154. We believethat the note of caution, the limitations, and the expressed
uneasiness with a traditional lump-sum damages remedy areimportant, for they suggest a judicial recognition of some of
the policy concerns that have been pointed out to us here--concerns of a sort that

Gottshall identified.
Since, for example, the particular cancer-related costs at
issue are the extra monitoring costs, over and above those
otherwise recommended, their identification will sometimes
pose special "difficult[ies] for judges and juries." Gottshall,
512 U. S., at 557. Those difficulties in part can reflect uncertainty among medical professionals about just which tests
are most usefully administered and when. Cf. Report of
U. S. Preventive Services Task Force, Guide to Clinical Preventive Services xxvii, xxx-xxxi, xlvii-xcii (2d ed. 1996).
And in part those difficulties can reflect the fact that scientists will not always see a medical need to provide systematic
scientific answers to the relevant legal question, namely,
whether an exposure calls for extra monitoring. Cf. App.
182 (testimony by Buckley's expert conceding that periodic
colon cancer screening "is recommended by the American

Opinion of the Court
Cancer Society anyway"); id., at 164 (testimony by Buckley'sexpert declining to rule out that periodic chest X rays would

likely benefit smokers such as Buckley, even in the absenceof asbestos exposure). Buckley's sole expert, then, was
equivocal about the need for extra monitoring, and the defense had not yet put on its case.Moreover, tens of millions of individuals may have suffered

exposure to substances that might justify some form ofsubstance-exposure-related medical monitoring. See

supra,
at 434-435. (The dissent limits its class of potential plaintiffsto employees suing their employers, see

post, at 454, but other
exposed individuals who satisfy the Paoli test, see post, at
449-450, could sue--at common law.) And that fact, along
with uncertainty as to the amount of liability, could threaten
both a "flood" of less important cases (potentially absorbing resources better left available to those more seriously harmed,
see supra, at 435-436) and the systemic harms that can accompany "unlimited and unpredictable liability" (for example, vast
testing liability adversely affecting the allocation of scarce
medical resources). The dissent assumes that medical monitoring is not a "costly" remedy, see post, at 451 (internal quotation marks omitted). But Buckley here sought damages
worth $950 annually for 36 years; by comparison, of all claims
settled by the Center for Claims Resolution, a group representing asbestos manufacturers, from 1988 until 1993, the average settlement for plaintiffs injured by asbestos was about
$12,500, and the settlement for nonmalignant plaintiffs
among this group averaged $8,810. See App. in Amchem
Products, Inc. v. Windsor, O. T. 1996, No. 96-270, p. 578.

Finally, a traditional, full-blown ordinary tort liability rule
would ignore the presence of existing alternative sources of
payment, thereby leaving a court uncertain about how much
of the potentially large recoveries would pay for otherwise
unavailable medical testing and how much would accrue to
plaintiffs for whom employers or other sources (say, insurance now or in the future) might provide monitoring in any

521US1 Unit: $U84 [11-18-99 20:42:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
event. Cf. 29 CFR $ 1910.1001(l) (1996) (requiring employ-ers to provide medical monitoring for workers exposed to

asbestos). The Occupational Safety and Health Administra-tion regulations (which the dissent cites) help to demonstrate
why the Second Circuit erred: where state and federal
regulations already provide the relief that a plaintiff seeks,creating a full-blown tort remedy could entail systemic costs

without corresponding benefits. Nor could an employer nec-essarily protect itself by offering monitoring, see

post, at
453-454, for that is not part of the rule of law that Justice
Ginsburg would endorse--a rule that, if traditional, would,
as we have noted, allow recovery irrespective of the presence
of a "collateral source" of payment. See post, at 449.

We do not deny important competing considerations--of a
kind that may have led some courts to provide a form of
liability. Buckley argues, for example, that it is inequitable
to place the economic burden of such care on the negligently
exposed plaintiff rather than on the negligent defendant.
See, e. g., Ayers, 106 N. J., at 603-606, 525 A. 2d, at 311-312;
Potter, 6 Cal. 4th, at 1007-1009, 863 P. 2d, at 824. He points
out that providing preventive care to individuals who would
otherwise go without can help to mitigate potentially serious
future health effects of diseases by detecting them in early
stages; again, whether or not this is such a situation, we
may assume that such situations occur. And he adds that,
despite scientific uncertainties, the difficulty of separating
justified from unjustified claims may be less serious than
where emotional distress is the harm at issue. See also
Ayers, supra; Potter, supra.

We do not deny that Justice Ginsburg paints a sympathetic picture of Buckley and his co-workers; this picture has
force because Buckley is sympathetic and he has suffered
wrong at the hands of a negligent employer. But we are
more troubled than is Justice Ginsburg by the potential
systemic effects of creating a new, full-blown, tort law cause
of action--for example, the effects upon interests of other

potential plaintiffs who are not before the court and who de-pend on a tort system that can distinguish between reliable

and serious claims on the one hand, and unreliable and rel-atively trivial claims on the other. See supra, at 438. The
reality is that competing interests are at stake--and thoseinterests sometimes can be reconciled in ways other than
simply through the creation of a full-blown, traditional, tortlaw cause of action. Cf.

post, at 454.We have not tried to balance these, or other, competing

considerations here. We point them out to help explain whywe consider the limitations and cautions to be important--
and integral--parts of the state-court decisions that permitasymptomatic plaintiffs a separate tort claim for medical
monitoring costs. That being so, we do not find sufficientsupport in the common law for the unqualified rule of lumpsum damages recovery that is, at least arguably, before ushere. And given the mix of competing general policy considerations, plaintiff 's policy-based arguments do not con-vince us that the FELA contains a tort liability rule of that
unqualified kind.This limited conclusion disposes of the matter before us.
We need not, and do not, express any view here about theextent to which the FELA might, or might not, accommodate
medical cost recovery rules more finely tailored than the rulewe have considered.

IV
For the reasons stated, we reverse the determination ofthe Second Circuit, and we remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.

Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Stevens joins,concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.
The Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA) was enactedto facilitate recovery for railworkers who suffer injuries as
a result of their employers' negligence. "Congress intended

the creation of no static remedy, but one which would bedeveloped and enlarged to meet changing conditions and

changing concepts of industry's duty toward its workers."
Kernan v. American Dredging Co., 355 U. S. 426, 432 (1958).
Until recently, this Court accorded the FELA a notably "liberal construction in order to accomplish [Congress'] objects."
Urie v. Thompson, 337 U. S. 163, 180 (1949). Today's decision, however, continues the step-back approach taken in
Consolidated Rail Corporation v. Gottshall, 512 U. S. 532
(1994). Even if the Gottshall decision supported the Court'srejection of Michael Buckley's claim for emotional distress,

the Court's disposition of Buckley's medical monitoring claim
marks a new and enigmatic departure from a once "constant
and established course." Urie, 337 U. S., at 181-182.

Buckley's extensive contact with asbestos particles in
Grand Central's tunnels, as I comprehend his situation, constituted "physical impact" as that term was used in Gottshall. Nevertheless, I concur in the Court's judgment with
respect to Buckley's emotional distress claim. In my view,
that claim fails because Buckley did not present objective
evidence of severe emotional distress. See Atchison, T. & S.
F. R. Co. v. Buell, 480 U. S. 557, 566-567, n. 13 (1987) ("severe
emotional injury . . . has generally been required to establish
liability for purely emotional injury"); see also id., at 569,
n. 18. Buckley testified at trial that he was angry at MetroNorth and fearful of developing an asbestos-related disease.
However, he sought no professional help to ease his distress,
and presented no medical testimony concerning his mental
health. See 79 F. 3d 1337, 1341 (CA2 1996). Under these
circumstances, Buckley's emotional distress claim fails as a
matter of law. Cf. Gottshall, 512 U. S., at 563-564, 566-567
(Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (describing as "unquestionably
genuine and severe" emotional distress suffered by one respondent who had a nervous breakdown, and another who
was hospitalized, lost weight, and had, inter alia, suicidal
preoccupations, anxiety, insomnia, cold sweats, and nausea).

446 METRO-NORTH COMMUTER R. CO. v. BUCKLEY

Opinion of Ginsburg, J.
Concerning medical monitoring, the Court of Appealsruled that Buckley stated a triable claim for monitoring

expenses made "necessary because of his exposure to as-bestos," expenses essential "to ensure early detection and
cure of any asbestos-related disease he develops." 79 F. 3d,at 1347. I would not disturb that ruling.

I
As a pipefitter for Metro-North, Michael Buckley repairedand maintained the labyrinth of pipes in the steam tunnels

of Grand Central Terminal in New York City. The pipeswere surrounded by a white insulation material that Buckley
and his co-workers had to remove to perform their jobs.Without any protective gear, the pipefitters would hammer,
slice, and pull the insulation material, which broke apart asit was removed, scattering dust particles into the air. Fans
used to mitigate the intense heat of the steam tunnels spreadfurther dust from insulation pieces that had accumulated on
tunnel floors. The dust coated Buckley's skin and clothing;he testified that he could taste the gritty insulation material
as it entered his mouth and nose. The pipefitters wouldemerge from their work in the tunnels covered from head to
toe with white dust; for this appearance, they were dubbed"the snowmen of Grand Central."

The insulation material covering Grand Central's pipeswas made of asbestos, widely recognized as a carcinogen
since the mid-1970's. Metro-North did not tell the pipefit-ters of, or provide protection against, the danger to which
the workers were exposed until 1987, two years after Buck-ley started working in the steam tunnels. At an asbestos
awareness class on August 31, 1987, Buckley and his co-workers learned of the asbestos in the pipe insulation and of
the diseases asbestos exposure could cause. Buckley wasthen given a respirator and some instruction on the "glove
bag" method of removing asbestos. He testified that his ef-forts to use the respirator and glove bag method proved frus521US1 Unit: $U84 [11-18-99 20:42:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of Ginsburg, J.
trating: the respirator fit poorly and slid down his face as heperspired in the intense heat of the steam tunnels; the plastic

bags used to isolate the asbestos melted on the hot pipes,spilling out the material instead of containing it.

Buckley and as many as 140 other asbestos-exposed work-ers sought legal counsel after their complaints to MetroNorth management went unresolved. In the FELA actionnow before us, Buckley is serving as test plaintiff for the
claims of all the exposed employees. Metro-North stipu-lated in the District Court that it had "negligently exposed
the plaintiff Michael Buckley to asbestos while he was work-ing in Grand Central Terminal from June 1985 to the beginning of September 1987." App. 594 (Admitted and Stipu-lated Facts). "[N]o later than 1986," Metro-North also
conceded, "[it] obtained actual notice of the presence of as-bestos in Grand Central Terminal and notice of the hazard
that working with or around asbestos posed to the healthand welfare of its employees." Ibid. Metro-North further
acknowledged that "it exposed the plaintiff to asbestos with-out warning him that he was being exposed to asbestos and
without training him how to safely handle and remove asbes-tos."

Ibid. Prior to Metro-North's stipulation concedingnegligence, the New York Attorney General's Office and the

Office of the Inspector General of the Metropolitan Transpor-tation Authority conducted a joint investigation, leading to
these conclusions: Metro-North had "seriously disregardedthe health and safety of its workers"; and the railroad's failings were "particularly egregious" because Metro-North wason notice of the asbestos problem as a result of complaints
by its workers, a report by its own consultant, and inspec-tions by the New York State Department of Labor.

Id., at614.

II
Buckley asserted two claims for relief in his FELA-basedcomplaint: first, he charged Metro-North with negligent infliction of emotional distress; second, he sought compensation

448 METRO-NORTH COMMUTER R. CO. v. BUCKLEY

Opinion of Ginsburg, J.
for the cost of future medical monitoring. The Court definitively rejects Buckley's first claim by holding that, under the
FELA, a railworker may not recover damages for emotional
distress unless, and until, he manifests symptoms of a disease. See ante, at 427, 430. As to Buckley's second claim,
however, the Court speaks tentatively. "[T]he respondent
in this case," we are told, "has not shown that he is legally
entitled to recover [medical monitoring] costs." Ante, at
427. "[A]rguably," the Court explains, Buckley demands an
"unqualified rule of lump-sum damages recovery," ante, at
444, a rule for which the Court finds "[in]sufficient support
in the common law," ibid. The Court pointedly refrains,
however, from "express[ing] any view . . . about the extent
to which the FELA might, or might not, accommodate medical cost recovery rules more finely tailored than" a "rule of
[the] unqualified kind." Ibid. (emphasis in original).

It is not apparent why (or even whether) the Court reverses the Second Circuit's determination on Buckley's second claim. The Court of Appeals held that a medical monitoring claim is solidly grounded, and this Court does not hold
otherwise. Hypothesizing that Buckley demands lump-sum
damages and nothing else, the Court ruminates on the appropriate remedy without answering the anterior question:
Does the plaintiff have a claim for relief? Buckley has
shown that Metro-North negligently exposed him to "extremely high levels of asbestos," 79 F. 3d, at 1341, and that
this exposure warrants "medical monitoring in order to detect and treat [asbestos-related] diseases as they may arise."
Id., at 1346. Buckley's expert medical witness estimated
the annual costs of proper monitoring at $950. Ibid.1 We
do not know from the Court's opinion what more a plaintiff
must show to qualify for relief.

1 Metro-North, of course, could contest that estimate as excessive. But
the amount Buckley may recover is a matter discrete from the question
whether he has stated a claim for relief.

Opinion of Ginsburg, J.

A
In my view, the Second Circuit rightly held that a rail-worker negligently exposed to asbestos states a claim for

relief under the FELA; recovery in such cases, again as theCourt of Appeals held, should reflect the difference in cost
between the medical tests a reasonable physician would pre-scribe for unexposed persons and the monitoring regime a
reasonable physician would advise for persons exposed in theway Michael Buckley and his co-workers were. See

id., at1347; see
infra, at 450-451 (defining an asbestos-exposedworker's "injury"); see also In re Paoli R. Yard PCB Litigation, 916 F. 2d 829, 849-852 (CA3 1990) (Paoli I), cert. deniedsub nom. General Elec. Co. v. Knight, 499 U. S. 961 (1991);

sustained medical monitoring claims.2 This Court, respon-sible for developing FELA law, finds little value in these

decisions.These courts have answered the question this Court
passes by: What are the elements of a compensable medical
monitoring claim? The Third Circuit, for example, has enu-merated: A plaintiff can recover the costs of medical monitoring if (1) he establishes that he was significantly exposed toa proven hazardous substance through the negligent actions
of the defendant; (2) as a proximate result of the exposure,the plaintiff suffers a significantly increased risk of contracting a serious latent disease; (3) by reason of the exposure areasonable physician would prescribe a monitoring regime
different from the one that would have been prescribed in
the absence of the exposure; and (4) monitoring and testingprocedures exist that make the early detection and treatment of the disease possible and beneficial. See Paoli I, 916
F. 2d, at 852; Paoli II, 35 F. 3d, at 788. Each factor must
be shown by competent expert testimony. See Paoli I, 916
F. 2d, at 852.

A claim so defined comports with the terms of the FELA.
Under the FELA, a railroad "shall be liable in damages to
any person suffering injury while he is employed by such
carrier . . . for such injury . . . resulting in whole or in part
from the negligence of any of the officers, agents, or employees of such carrier." 45 U. S. C. $ 51. The "injury" sustained by an asbestos-exposed worker seeking to recover
medical monitoring costs is the invasion of that employee's
interest in being free from the economic burden of extraordi2 The state court cases include: Elam v. Alcolac, Inc., 765 S. W. 2d 42,

Traditional tort principles upon which the FELA restswarrant recognition of medical monitoring claims of the kind
Buckley has asserted. As the Third Circuit explained, "[t]hepolicy reasons for recognizing this tort are obvious[:]"

"Medical monitoring claims acknowledge that, in a toxicage, significant harm can be done to an individual by a
tortfeasor, notwithstanding latent manifestation of thatharm. Moreover, . . . recognizing this tort does not require courts to speculate about the probability of future
injury. It merely requires courts to ascertain the prob-ability that the far less costly remedy of medical supervision is appropriate. Allowing plaintiffs to recover thecost of this care deters irresponsible discharge of toxic
chemicals by defendants and encourages plaintiffs to de-tect and treat their injuries as soon as possible. These
are conventional goals of the tort system . . . ." Paoli I,916 F. 2d, at 852.

On all counts--exposure, increased risk of devastating disease, and the necessity of monitoring--Michael Buckley's
complaint presents a textbook case. Through its stipula521US1 Unit: $U84 [11-18-99 20:42:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tions, Metro-North has acknowledged that it failed "to use[the] reasonable care [the FELA requires] in furnishing its

employees with a safe place to work." Buell, 480 U. S., at558. At trial, "[c]ompetent expert testimony . . . established
both that Buckley suffered a substantial impact from asbes-tos that . . . significantly increased his risk of contracting
an asbestos-related disease and that Buckley should receivemedical monitoring in order to ensure early detection and
cure of any asbestos-related disease he develops." 79 F. 3d,at 1347. Thus, Metro-North, "through [its] negligence,
caused the plaintiff, in the opinion of medical experts, to needspecific medical services--a cost that is neither inconsequential nor of a kind the community generally accepts as part ofthe wear and tear of daily life. Under [the] principles of tort
law, the [tortfeasor] should pay." Friends for All Children,746 F. 2d, at 825.

B
The Court, as I read its opinion, leaves open the questionwhether Buckley may state a claim for relief under the

FELA. The Court does not question the medical need formonitoring. It recognizes that cancer, one of the diseases
Buckley faces an increased risk of suffering, is "unusuallythreatening and unusually frightening,"

ante, at 435, andthat detection of disease in early stages "can help to mitigate

potentially serious future health effects," ante, at 443. Onthe other hand, the Court notes there may be "uncertainty
among medical professionals about just which tests are mostusefully administered and when."

Ante, at 441.It is not uncommon, of course, that doctors will agree that

medical attention is needed, yet disagree on what monitoringor treatment course is best. But uncertainty as to which
tests are best or when they should be administered is notcause to deny a claim for relief. Fact triers in tort cases
routinely face questions lacking indubitably clear answers:Did defendant's product cause plaintiff 's disease? What will
plaintiff 's future disability and medical costs be? It bearsrepetition, moreover, that recovery on a FELA medical mon521US1 Unit: $U84 [11-18-99 20:42:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of Ginsburg, J.
itoring claim would be limited to the incremental cost oftests a reasonable physician would recommend as a result of

the plaintiff 's exposure. See 79 F. 3d, at 1347.Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)
regulations governing permissible levels of asbestos expo-sure in the workplace make it plain that medical monitoring
is no "trivial" matter, see ante, at 444; the regulations areinstructive on appropriate standards for necessary monitoring, see 29 CFR $ 1910.1001 (1996); see also 29 U. S. C.$ 655(b)(7) (authorizing Secretary of Labor to require employers to provide medical monitoring to employees exposedto hazardous substances). OSHA's regulations direct employers to provide medical monitoring for employees exposedto certain levels of asbestos, and they describe in detail the
monitoring employers must make available. See 29 CFR$ 1910.1001(l), App. D, App. E (1996). These regulations
apply to all industries covered by the Occupational Safetyand Health Act of 1970 (Act). Although the Act does not
apply to state public employers such as Metro-North, see 29U. S. C. $ 652(5), New York State has adopted OSHA standards for its public employers, see N. Y. Lab. Law $$ 27-a(3)(c), (4)(a) (McKinney 1986 and Supp. 1997). Had MetroNorth assiduously attended to those standards, Buckleymight have been spared the costs he now seeks to recover.

Finally, the Court's anticipation of a " `flood' of less impor-tant cases" and " `unlimited and unpredictable liability' " is

overblown. See ante, at 442. The employee's "injury" inthe claim at stake is the economic burden additional medical

conduct the required monitoring of airborne asbestos in the steam tunnels,
and for that reason only, Metro-North escaped compliance with the requirement that employers provide ongoing medical monitoring of employees. Tr. of Oral Arg. 52. The record supports Buckley's assertion that
Metro-North did not properly monitor the level of asbestos to which its
workers were exposed. See App. 606-607 (noting that in 1986 the New
York Department of Labor cited Metro-North for asbestos-related violations, including failure to monitor accurately the airborne concentrations
of asbestos).

surveillance entails, see supra, at 450-451; if an employerprovides all that a reasonable physician would recommend

for the exposed employee, the employee would incur no costsand hence have no claim for compensation. Nor does the
FELA claim Buckley states pave the way for "tens of mil-lions of individuals" with similar claims. See

ante, at 442.It is doubtful that many legions in the universe of individuals

ever exposed to toxic material could demonstrate that theiremployers negligently exposed them to a known hazardous
substance, and thereby substantially increased the risk thatthey would suffer debilitating or deadly disease.

4 Withholding relief, moreover, is dangerous, for lives will be lost whengrave disease is diagnosed too late.

C
The Court emphasizes most heavily that several courts,while authorizing recovery for medical monitoring, have imposed or suggested special limitations on the tort remedy.See

ante, at 440-441. In lieu of lump-sum damages, the Courtindicates, a court-supervised fund might be the better remedy.

See ante, at 441; see also Potter, 6 Cal. 4th, at 1006-1010, andn. 28, 863 P. 2d, at 821-825, and n. 28 (recognizing claim and
affirming award for medical monitoring; suggesting in foot-note creation of court-supervised fund);

Hansen, 858 P. 2d,at 979-982 (reversing grant of summary judgment and recognizing claim for medical monitoring; suggesting creation ofcourt-supervised fund); Ayers, 106 N. J., at 607-611, 525
A. 2d, at 313-315 (affirming damages award for medical mon-itoring; suggesting creation of court-supervised fund in future cases); Burns, 156 Ariz., at 380-381, 752 P. 2d, at 33-34(recognizing claim for medical monitoring; holding plaintiffs
entitled to award from court-supervised fund).It is scarcely surprising that the Second Circuit did not
consider relief through a court-supervised fund. So far asthe record before us shows, no party argued in the District

Court, the Second Circuit, or even this Court, that medicalmonitoring expenses may be recoverable, but not through a

lump sum, only through a court fund. The question airedbelow was the prime one the Court obscures: Does Buckley's
medical monitoring claim warrant any relief?Buckley sought "an `amount of money' sufficient to `compensate' him for `future medical monitoring expenses.' "See

ante, at 439. He was not more precise about the formrelief should take. The Court infers from Buckley's proposed charges to the jury, however, that he wanted what"tort law ordinarily permits"--damages in a lump sum. See
ibid. I believe his claim qualifies for that relief. If theCourt deems what "tort law ordinarily permits" inappropriate, however, the Court should at least say, for the guidanceof lower courts, "Yes, Buckley has

a claim for relief." Fed-eral Rule of Civil Procedure 54(c) directs a court to grant

the relief to which a prevailing party is entitled, even if theparty did not demand such relief in its pleadings. Rule 54(c)
thus instructs district courts to "compensate the parties orremedy the situation without regard to the constraints of
the antiquated and rigid forms of action." 10 C. Wright, A.Miller, & M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure $ 2662,
pp. 133-134 (2d ed. 1983). Under the Federal Rules, "aparty should experience little difficulty in securing a remedy
other than that demanded in his pleadings when he showshe is entitled to it."

Id., at 135; see also id., $ 2664, at 163(Rule 54(c) "has been utilized when the court awards a different type of relief from that demanded in the complaint"); cf.
Holt Civic Club v. Tuscaloosa, 439 U. S. 60, 65-66 (1978) ("afederal court should not dismiss a meritorious constitutional

claim because the complaint seeks one remedy rather thananother plainly appropriate one") (citing Rule 54(c)).

Unaccountably, the Court resists the straightforward state-ment that would enlighten courts in this and similar cases:
A claim for medical monitoring is cognizable under theFELA; it is a claim entirely in step with " `evolving common
law.' " See ante, at 440 (citing Gottshall, 512 U. S., at 558(

monitoring.

GLICKMAN, SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE v.WILEMAN BROTHERS & ELLIOTT,

INC., et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 95-1184. Argued December 2, 1996--Decided June 25, 1997
Respondents, California tree fruitgrowers, handlers, and processors, initiated administrative proceedings challenging the validity of various regulations contained in marketing orders promulgated by the Secretary of
Agriculture under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937
(AMAA). Congress enacted the AMAA to establish and maintain orderly agricultural-commodity marketing conditions and fair prices; the
program, which is expressly exempted from the antitrust laws, displaces
competition in favor of collective action in the discrete markets regulated. AMAA marketing orders set uniform prices, product standards,
and other conditions for all producers in a particular market; must be
approved by two-thirds of the affected producers; are implemented by
committees of producers appointed by the Secretary; and impose assessments on producers for the expenses of their administration, including
product advertising and promotion. The orders at issue assessed respondents for, inter alia, the cost of generic advertising of California
nectarines, plums, and peaches. After the Department of Agriculture
upheld the generic advertising regulations, respondents sought review
in this action, which was consolidated with enforcement actions brought
by the Secretary. The District Court upheld the orders and entered
judgment for the Secretary, but the Ninth Circuit held that the Government enforced contributions to pay for generic advertising violated respondents' commercial speech rights under the test set forth in Central
Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U. S.
557, 566.

Held: The requirement that respondents finance generic advertising does

not violate the First Amendment. Pp. 467-477.

(a) Respondents' claimed disagreement with the content of some of
the advertising at issue has no bearing on the validity of the entire
generic advertising program. The Ninth Circuit invalidated that program under Central Hudson because the Government failed to prove
that such advertising was more effective than individual advertising
in increasing consumer demand for California tree fruits. The factual
assumption that generic advertising may not be the most effective

Syllabus
method to promote these commodities is neither accepted nor rejected
by this Court, which instead stresses the importance of the statutory
context in which the question at issue arises. Under the AMAA, detailed marketing orders have displaced many aspects of independent
business activity characterizing other portions of the economy in which
competition is fully protected by the antitrust laws. Business entities
are compelled to fund generic advertising as part of a broader collective
enterprise in which the regulatory scheme already constrains their freedom to act independently. It is in this context that the Court considers
whether to review the assessments at issue under the standard appropriate to economic regulation or under a heightened First Amendment
standard. Pp. 467-469.

(b) The Ninth Circuit erred in relying on Central Hudson to test the
constitutionality of market order assessments for promotional advertising. Three characteristics of the generic advertising scheme distinguish it from laws this Court has found to abridge free speech. First,
the marketing orders impose no restraint on any respondents' freedom
to communicate any message to any audience. Second, they do not compel anyone to engage in any actual or symbolic speech. Cf., e. g., West
Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624, 632. Third, they do not
compel anyone to endorse or to finance any political or ideological views.
Cf., e. g., Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U. S. 705. Indeed, since respondents
market California tree fruits, they may all be presumed to agree with
the central message of the speech generated by the generic program.
Thus, none of the Court's First Amendment jurisprudence supports the
suggestion that the promotional regulations should be scrutinized under
a different standard from that applicable to the marketing orders' other
anticompetitive features. Respondents' criticisms of the generic advertising and their contention that the assessments reduce the sums respondents use to conduct their own advertising provide no basis for
concluding that accurate advertising constitutes an abridgment of anybody's right to speak freely. Nor does the First Amendment forbid all
compelled financial contributions to fund advertising. Abood v. Detroit
Bd. of Ed., 431 U. S. 209, and the cases that follow it, prohibit compelled
contributions for expressive activities that conflict with one's freedom
of belief. The advertising here does not promote any particular message with which respondents disagree. The fact that respondents may
prefer to foster that message in other ways does not make this case
comparable to those involving political or ideological disagreement.
Moreover, some of the relevant cases suggest that assessments to fund
a lawful collective program may be used to pay for nonideological speech
over the objection of some members of the group if the speech is germane to the purpose for which the compelled association was justified.

Syllabus
See, e. g., Keller v. State Bar of Cal., 496 U. S. 1, 13-14. This test is
clearly satisfied here because (1) the generic advertising of California
tree fruit is unquestionably germane to the marketing orders' purposes
and, (2) in any event, the assessments are not used to fund ideological
activities. Although the wisdom of the generic advertising program
may be questioned, its debatable features are insufficient to warrant
special First Amendment scrutiny. Pp. 469-474.

(c) The Ninth Circuit's decision to apply the Central Hudson test is
inconsistent with the very nature and purpose of the collective action
program at issue. The AMAA rests on an assumption that in the volatile agricultural commodities markets the public will be best served by
compelling cooperation among producers in making economic decisions
that would be made independently in a free market. The First Amendment does not provide a basis for reviewing such economic regulation,
which enjoys the same strong presumption of validity that this Court
accords to other policy judgments made by Congress. Appropriate respect for Congress' power to regulate interstate commerce provides
abundant support for the marketing orders' constitutionality. Generic
advertising is intended to stimulate consumer demand for an agricultural product in a regulated market. That purpose is legitimate and
consistent with the regulatory goals of the overall statutory scheme.
The mere fact that one or more producers do not wish to foster generic
advertising of their product is not a sufficient reason for judges to override the judgment of the majority of market participants, bureaucrats,
and legislators that such programs are beneficial. Pp. 474-477.

Congress enacted the Agricultural Marketing AgreementAct of 1937 (AMAA), ch. 296, 50 Stat. 246, as amended, 7

U. S. C. $ 601 et seq., in order to establish and maintain or-derly marketing conditions and fair prices for agricultural
commodities. $ 602(1). Marketing orders promulgated pur-suant to the AMAA are a species of economic regulation
that has displaced competition in a number of discrete mar-kets; they are expressly exempted from the antitrust laws.

$ 608b. Collective action, rather than the aggregate conse-quences of independent competitive choices, characterizes
these regulated markets. In order "to avoid unreasonablefluctuations in supplies and prices," $ 602(4), these orders
may include mechanisms that provide a uniform price to allproducers in a particular market,

1 that limit the quality and

the quantity of the commodity that may be marketed,$$ 608c(6)(A), (7), that determine the grade and size of the

commodity, $ 608c(6)(A), and that make an orderly disposi-tion of any surplus that might depress market prices,

ibid.Pursuant to the policy of collective, rather than competitive,

marketing, the orders also authorize joint research anddevelopment projects, inspection procedures that ensure
uniform quality, and even certain standardized packaging re-quirements. $$ 608c(6)(D), (H), (I). The expenses of administering such orders, including specific projects undertaken
to serve the economic interests of the cooperating producers,
are "paid from funds collected pursuant to the marketingorder." $$ 608c(6)(I), 610(b)(2)(ii).

Marketing orders must be approved by either two-thirdsof the affected producers or by producers who market at

least two-thirds of the volume of the commodity. $ 608c(9)(B).The AMAA restricts the marketing orders "to the smallest

regional production areas . . . practicable." $ 608c(11)(b).The orders are implemented by committees composed of
producers and handlers of the regulated commodity, appointed by the Secretary, who recommend rules to the Sec-retary governing marketing matters such as fruit size and

maturity levels. 7 CFR $$ 916.23, 916.62, 917.25, 917.30(1997). The committees also determine the annual rate of
assessments to cover the expenses of administration, in-spection services, research, and advertising and promotion.

$$ 916.31(c), 917.35(f).Among the collective activities that Congress authorized
for certain specific commodities is "any form of marketing
promotion including paid advertising." 7 U. S. C. $ 608c(6)(I).

2 The authorized promotional activities, like the marketing orders themselves, are intended to serve the producers'
common interest in disposing of their output on favorable
terms. The central message of the generic advertising atissue in this case is that "California Summer Fruits" are

wholesome, delicious, and attractive to discerning shoppers.See App. 530. All of the relevant advertising, insofar as it
is authorized by the statute and the Secretary's regulations,is designed to serve the producers' and handlers' common
interest in promoting the sale of a particular product.3

2 Congress amended the AMAA in 1954 to authorize the Secretary to
establish "marketing . . . development projects." See Agricultural Act of
1954, $ 401(c), 68 Stat. 906.

3 Those regulations include provisions minimizing the risk that the generic advertising might adversely affect the interests of any individual
producer. See 7 U. S. C. $ 608c(16)(A)(i) (providing for termination or suspension of an order that does not "effectuate the declared policy" of the
AMAA); $ 608c(16)(B) (providing for termination of an order if a majority
of producers does not support a regulation); $ 608c(15)(A) (allowing handlers subject to a marketing order to petition for modification or exemption from an order that is inconsistent with the statute). For the purpose

Opinion of the Court

II
The regulations at issue in this litigation are contained in
Marketing Order 916, which regulates nectarines grown in
California, and Marketing Order 917, which originally regulated peaches, pears, and plums grown in California.4 A
1966 amendment to the former expressly authorized generic
advertising of nectarines, see 31 Fed. Reg. 8177, and a series
of amendments, beginning in 1971, to the latter authorized
advertising of each of the regulated commodities, see 36 Fed.
Reg. 14381 (1971); 41 Fed. Reg. 14375, 17528 (1976).5 The
advertising provisions relating to pears are not now being
challenged, thus we limit our discussion to generic advertising of California nectarines, plums, and peaches.

Respondent Wileman Bros. & Elliott, Inc., is a large producer of these fruits that packs and markets its own output
as well as that grown by other farmers. In 1987, after encountering problems with some fruit varieties under the maturity and minimum size standards in the orders, it refused
to pay its assessments and filed a petition with the Secretary
challenging those standards. In 1988, it filed a second petition challenging amendments to the maturity standards as
well as the generic advertising regulations. The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), in two separate decisions that are
explained in a total of 769 pages, ruled in favor of Wileman
on the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) issues, without
resolving respondents' First Amendment claims. App. to

those who pay for them. We do not, however, rule out the possibility
that, despite the approval of generic advertising by at least two-thirds of
the handlers, individual advertising might be even more effective.

4 The original marketing order for California peaches and plums was

first issued in 1939. See 4 Fed. Reg. 2135 (1939). The marketing order
for California nectarines was issued in 1958. See 7 CFR $ 937.45 (1959).

5 The plum portion of Order 917 was terminated in 1991 after a majority

of plum producers failed to vote for its continuation, see 56 Fed. Reg.
23772, but because some of the respondents are seeking a refund of 1991
assessments for plum advertising, the validity of that portion of the program is not moot.

464 GLICKMAN v. WILEMAN BROTHERS & ELLIOTT, INC.

Opinion of the Court
Brief in Opposition 393a.6 In a comparably detailed decision, the Judicial Officer of the Department of Agriculture
entirely reversed the ALJ. Wileman, along with 15 other
handlers, then sought review of the Judicial Officer's decision by filing this action in the District Court pursuant to
7 U. S. C. $ 608c(15)(B). A number of enforcement actions
brought by the Secretary to collect withheld assessments
were consolidated with the review proceeding. Acting on
cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court upheld both marketing orders and entered judgment of $3.1
million in past due assessments against the handlers.

In the Court of Appeals the handlers challenged the generic advertising provisions of the orders as violative of both
the APA and the First Amendment. The court rejected the
statutory challenge, concluding that the record contained
substantial evidence justifying both the original decision to
engage in generic advertising 7 and the continuation of the
program. It explained:

6 The ALJ indicated that if respondents "were not to succeed in their
nonconstitutional arguments" she would rule in their favor on the First
Amendment claim. App. to Brief in Opposition 393a.

7 The Court of Appeals quoted the following as a "typical excerpt":

" `The record shows a wide consensus among the peach and pear industries
that promotional activities have been beneficial in increasing demand and
should be continued.. . . . .

" `Media generally is expensive but some things can be done selectively in
this field that are inexpensive and yet create an impact on the buying
trade as well as the consuming public. Trade paper ads, particularly at
the beginning of the season, together with the editorial support which
trade papers are willing to accord an advertiser are helpful in launching a
program for seasonal fruits such as peaches and pears. Spot radio or TV
commercials in the principal markets during peak movement periods have
proved to be successful. It has been found in many fresh promotional
programs that spot announcements, particularly when developed with a
"dealer tag" at the end of each spot, have considerable influence in triggering retail promotions. 41 Fed. Reg. 14,375, 14,376-77 (1976).' " Wileman

Opinion of the Court
"The Nectarine Administrative Committee and thePeach Commodity Committee engage in a careful process each year prior to and during their annual springmeetings in approving the advertising program for the
upcoming season. Prior to the full committee meeting,
the Subcommittee on Advertising and Promotion meetsto review in detail the program developed by its staff.

The staff in turn uses monthly reports on price trends,consumer interests, and general market conditions in
the formation of the proposed advertising program.. . . . .

"[I]t is only because the handlers themselves, throughthe committees, recommend a budget with a generic
advertising component that the program is renewed bythe Secretary every year. In fact, in most years the
recommendations have been unanimous. We cannotassume that the handlers--the parties with firsthand
knowledge of the state of their industry--would make
recommendations that have an adverse effect on theirbusinesses. Of course, the interests of the voting committee members may not always coincide with those ofevery handler in the industry. However, this court has
previously noted that the Supreme Court `upheld theconstitutionality of the system despite the fact that it
may produce results with which some growers or han-dlers will disagree.'

14 F. 3d 429 (CA9 1993), the court began by stating that the"First Amendment right of freedom of speech includes a
right not to be compelled to render financial support forothers' speech." 58 F. 3d, at 1377. It then reviewed the
generic advertising regulations under "the test for restric-tions on commercial speech set out in

Central Hudson Gas &Electric Corp. v. Public Service Commission of New York,

447 U. S. 557, 566 . . . (1980)." Id., at 1378. Although it wassatisfied that the Government interest in enhancing returns
to peach and nectarine growers was substantial, it was notpersuaded that the generic advertising passed either the second or third "prongs" of Central Hudson. With respect tothe former, even though the generic advertising "undoubtedly" has increased peach and nectarine sales, the Govern-ment failed to prove that it did so more effectively than individualized advertising. The court also concluded that theprogram was not "narrowly tailored" because it did not give
the handlers any credit for their own advertising and be-cause California was the only State in which such programs
were in place.8The Court of Appeals' disposition of the First Amendment
claim is in conflict with a decision of the Court of Appealsfor the Third Circuit that rejected a challenge to generic

objections to the content of the advertising,9 the court foundno violation of his First Amendment rights.

We granted the Secretary's petition for certiorari to re-solve the conflict, 517 U. S. 1232 (1996), and now reverse.

III
In challenging the constitutionality of the generic adver-tising program in the Court of Appeals, respondents relied,

in part, on their claimed disagreement with the content ofsome of the generic advertising. 58 F. 3d, at 1377, n. 6.
The District Court had found no merit to this aspect of theirclaim,

10 and the Court of Appeals did not rely on it for its

conclusion that the program was unconstitutional. Rather,the Court of Appeals invalidated the entire program on the

theory that the program could not survive Central Hudsonbecause the Government had failed to prove that generic
advertising was more effective than individual advertisingin increasing consumer demand for California nectarines,
plums, and peaches. That holding did not depend at all oneither the content of the advertising, or on the respondents'
claimed disagreement with any particular message. Al9 The plaintiff had claimed that he disagreed with the point of view expressed in advertising that the consumption of beef is " `desirable, healthy,
nutritious' "; the court concluded that his claim was not "a dispute over
anything more than mere strategy." Frame, 885 F. 2d, at 1137.

10 The District Court stated: "Scattered throughout plaintiffs' briefs are

additional objections which are difficult to characterize or quantify. They
assert that the advertising condones `lying' in that it promotes the `lie'
that red colored fruit is superior, that it rewards mediocrity by advertising
all varieties of California fruit to be of equal quality, that it promotes
sexually subliminal messages as evidenced by an ad depicting a young
girl in a wet bathing suit, and that it promotes the `socialistic programs'
of the Secretary. It is impossible from these `vague claims' to determine
that plaintiffs' first amendment rights have been significantly infringed."

468 GLICKMAN v. WILEMAN BROTHERS & ELLIOTT, INC.

Opinion of the Court
though respondents have continued in this Court to argueabout their disagreement with particular messages, those

arguments, while perhaps calling into question the adminis-tration of portions of the program, have no bearing on the
validity of the entire program.11For purposes of our analysis, we neither accept nor reject
the factual assumption underlying the Court of Appeals' in-validation of the program--namely, that generic advertising
may not be the most effective method of promoting the saleof these commodities. The legal question that we address
is whether being compelled to fund this advertising raises aFirst Amendment issue for us to resolve, or rather is simply
a question of economic policy for Congress and the Executiveto resolve.

11 Respondents argue that assessments were used to fund advertisements conveying the message that red nectarines are superior to other
nectarines, Brief for Respondents Wileman Brothers et al. 33, and advertisements conveying the message that "all California fruit is the same,"
ibid.; Brief for Respondents Gerawan Farming, Inc., et al. 46. They contend that they object to these messages because some of respondent companies grow varieties of nectarines that are not red, and because they
seek to promote the fact that the commodities are highly varied. See
Brief for Respondents Wileman Brothers et al. 33; Brief for Respondents
Gerawan Farming, Inc., et al. 46. Respondents' argument concerning
promotion of red varieties appears to confuse complaints concerning maturity standards imposed on peach and nectarine growers with complaints
concerning advertising. See, e. g., App. 233; id., at 692. The argument
that the advertising promotes a view that all California fruit is the same
is premised upon no particular advertisement, but rather upon testimony
by respondents' executives concerning their general opposition to paying
for generic advertising. See, e. g., id., at 588; id., at 662-663.

Respondents also suggest that assessments were improperly used to
fund materials promoting fruit varieties grown exclusively by their competitors. Brief for Respondents Wileman Brothers et al. 19-20. The
claim, however, arises simply from a single reference to Red Jim nectarines, listed among 25 varieties, on a 1989 chart illustrating the availability
of mid- to late-season summer tree fruits. App. 531.

These complaints, if they have any merit, are all essentially challenges
to the administration of the program that are more properly addressed to
the Secretary.

Opinion of the Court
In answering that question we stress the importance ofthe statutory context in which it arises. California nectarines and peaches are marketed pursuant to detailed market-ing orders that have displaced many aspects of independent
business activity that characterize other portions of the
economy in which competition is fully protected by the anti-trust laws. The business entities that are compelled to fund

the generic advertising at issue in this litigation do so as apart of a broader collective enterprise in which their freedom
to act independently is already constrained by the regulatoryscheme. It is in this context that we consider whether we
should review the assessments used to fund collective adver-tising, together with other collective activities, under the
standard appropriate for the review of economic regulation
or under a heightened standard appropriate for the review
of First Amendment issues.

IV
Three characteristics of the regulatory scheme at issue
distinguish it from laws that we have found to abridge the
freedom of speech protected by the First Amendment.
First, the marketing orders impose no restraint on the freedom of any producer to communicate any message to any
audience.12 Second, they do not compel any person to engage in any actual or symbolic speech.13 Third, they do not
compel the producers to endorse or to finance any political

12 This fact distinguishes the limits on commercial speech at issue in

U. S. 557 (1980), Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U. S. 748 (1976), and 44 Liquormart, Inc. v.
Rhode Island, 517 U. S. 484 (1996).

13 This fact distinguishes the compelled speech in West Virginia Bd. of

Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624 (1943), Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U. S. 705
(1977), Riley v. National Federation of Blind of N. C., Inc., 487 U. S. 781
(1988), and the compelled association in Hurley v. Irish-American Gay,
Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc., 515 U. S. 557 (1995).

Opinion of the Court
or ideological views.14 Indeed, since all of the respondentsare engaged in the business of marketing California nectarines, plums, and peaches, it is fair to presume that they agreewith the central message of the speech that is generated by
the generic program. Thus, none of our First Amendmentjurisprudence provides any support for the suggestion that
the promotional regulations should be scrutinized under adifferent standard from that applicable to the other anticompetitive features of the marketing orders.Respondents advance several arguments in support of
their claim that being required to fund the generic advertis-ing program violates the First Amendment. Respondents
argue that the assessments for generic advertising impingeon their First Amendment rights because they reduce the
amount of money that producers have available to conducttheir own advertising. This is equally true, however, of
assessments to cover employee benefits, inspection fees, orany other activity that is authorized by a marketing order.
The First Amendment has never been construed to requireheightened scrutiny of any financial burden that has the incidental effect of constraining the size of a firm's advertisingbudget. The fact that an economic regulation may indirectly lead to a reduction in a handler's individual advertis-ing budget does not itself amount to a restriction on speech.

The Court of Appeals, perhaps recognizing the expansivenature of respondents' argument, did not rely on the claim
that the assessments for generic advertising indirectly limitthe extent of the handlers' own advertising. Rather, the
Court of Appeals apparently accepted respondents' argu-ment that the assessments infringe First Amendment rights
because they constitute compelled speech. Our compelledspeech case law, however, is clearly inapplicable to the regulatory scheme at issue here. The use of assessments to pay

14 This fact distinguishes cases like Machinists v. Street, 367 U. S. 740

for advertising does not require respondents to repeat anobjectionable message out of their own mouths, cf.

West
Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624, 632 (1943),require them to use their own property to convey an antagonistic ideological message, cf. Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U. S.
705 (1977); Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. Public Util. Comm'n
of Cal., 475 U. S. 1, 18 (1986) (plurality opinion), force them
to respond to a hostile message when they "would prefer toremain silent," see

ibid., or require them to be publicly identified or associated with another's message, cf. PruneYard
Shopping Center v. Robins, 447 U. S. 74, 88 (1980). Respondents are not required themselves to speak, but aremerely required to make contributions for advertising.

With trivial exceptions on which the court did not rely,15none of the generic advertising conveys any message with
which respondents disagree. Furthermore, the advertisingis attributed not to them, but to the California Tree Fruit
Agreement or "California Summer Fruits." See, e. g., App.
530.

Although this regulatory scheme may not compel speech
as recognized by our case law, it does compel financial contributions that are used to fund advertising. As the Court of
Appeals read our decision in Abood, just as the First Amendment prohibits compelled speech, it prohibits--at least without sufficient justification by the government--compelling an
individual to "render financial support for others' speech."
58 F. 3d, at 1377. However, Abood, and the cases that follow
it, did not announce a broad First Amendment right not to
be compelled to provide financial support for any organization that conducts expressive activities. Rather, Abood
merely recognized a First Amendment interest in not being
compelled to contribute to an organization whose expressive
activities conflict with one's "freedom of belief." 431 U. S.,
at 235. We considered, in Abood, whether it was constitu15 See n. 10, supra.

Opinion of the Court
tional for the State of Michigan to require government em-ployees who objected to unions or union activities to contribute to an "agency shop" arrangement requiring all employeesto pay union dues as a condition of employment. We held
that compelled contributions to support activities related to
collective bargaining were "constitutionally justified by thelegislative assessment of the important contribution of the

union shop" to labor relations. Id., at 222. Relying on ourcompelled-speech cases, however, the Court found that compelled contributions for political purposes unrelated to collec-tive bargaining implicated First Amendment interests because they interfere with the values lying at the "heart ofthe First Amendment[--]the notion that an individual should
be free to believe as he will, and that in a free society one's
beliefs should be shaped by his mind and his consciencerather than coerced by the State."

Id., at 234-235; see also
id., at 235.Here, however, requiring respondents to pay the assessments cannot be said to engender any crisis of conscience.None of the advertising in this record promotes any particular message other than encouraging consumers to buy Cali-fornia tree fruit. Neither the fact that respondents may
prefer to foster that message independently in order to promote and distinguish their own products, nor the fact that
they think more or less money should be spent fostering it,
makes this case comparable to those in which an objection
rested on political or ideological disagreement with the content of the message. The mere fact that objectors believe
their money is not being well spent "does not mean [that]
they have a First Amendment complaint." Ellis v. Railway
Clerks, 466 U. S. 435, 456 (1984).

Moreover, rather than suggesting that mandatory funding
of expressive activities always constitutes compelled speech
in violation of the First Amendment, our cases provide affirmative support for the proposition that assessments to
fund a lawful collective program may sometimes be used to
pay for speech over the objection of some members of the

521US2 Unit: $U85 [11-23-99 18:38:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
group. Thus, in Lehnert v. Ferris Faculty Assn., 500 U. S.507 (1991), while we held that the cost of certain publications

that were not germane to collective-bargaining activitiescould not be assessed against dissenting union members, id.,
at 527-528, we squarely held that it was permissible tocharge them for those portions of "the Teachers' Voice that
concern teaching and education generally, professional de-velopment, unemployment, job opportunities, award programs . . . , and other miscellaneous matters." Id., at 529.That holding was an application of the rule announced in
Abood and further refined in Keller v. State Bar of Cal., 496U. S. 1 (1990), a case involving bar association activities.

As we pointed out in Keller, "Abood held that a unioncould not expend a dissenting individual's dues for ideological activities not `germane' to the purpose for which com-pelled association was justified: collective bargaining. Here
the compelled association and integrated bar are justified bythe State's interest in regulating the legal profession and
improving the quality of legal services. The State Bar maytherefore constitutionally fund activities germane to those
goals out of the mandatory dues of all members. It maynot, however, in such manner fund activities of an ideological
nature which fall outside of those areas of activity." Id., at13-14. This test is clearly satisfied in this case because (1)
the generic advertising of California peaches and nectarinesis unquestionably germane to the purposes of the marketing
orders and, (2) in any event, the assessments are not used tofund ideological activities.

16

16 The generic advertising program at issue here is even less likely to
pose a First Amendment burden than the programs upheld in Lehnert v.
Ferris Faculty Assn., 500 U. S. 507 (1991). Lehnert involved collective
programs in the context of a union agency-shop agreement which arguably
always poses some burden on First Amendment rights. See id., at 518
(noting that agency-shop agreements inherently burden First Amendment
rights); see also Abood, 431 U. S., at 222 (recognizing that all compelled
contributions for collective bargaining affect First Amendment interests
because an employee may have ideological, moral, or religious objections
to the union's activities). By contrast, the collective programs authorized

474 GLICKMAN v. WILEMAN BROTHERS & ELLIOTT, INC.

Opinion of the Court
We are not persuaded that any greater weight should begiven to the fact that some producers do not wish to foster

generic advertising than to the fact that many of them maywell object to the marketing orders themselves because they
might earn more money in an unregulated market. Re-spondents' criticisms of generic advertising provide no basis
for concluding that factually accurate advertising constitutesan abridgment of anybody's right to speak freely. Similar
criticisms might be directed at other features of the regula-tory orders that impose restraints on competition that arguably disadvantage particular producers for the benefit of theentire market.

17 Although one may indeed question the wisdom of such a program, its debatable features are insufficientto warrant special First Amendment scrutiny. It was therefore error for the Court of Appeals to rely on Central Hudson for the purpose of testing the constitutionality of marketorder assessments for promotional advertising.

18

V
The Court of Appeals' decision to apply the Central Hudson test is inconsistent with the very nature and purpose ofthe collective action program at issue here. The Court of

by the marketing order do not, as a general matter, impinge on speech or
association rights. Cf. Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U. S. 609,
634, 635 (1984) (opinion of O'Connor, J.) (finding "only minimal constitutional protection of the freedom of commercial association" and that an
association whose "activities are not predominantly of the type protected
by the First Amendment" is subject to "rationally related state regulation
of its membership").

17 As we have already noted, n. 8, supra, respondents failed in their

challenge to the other features of the programs before the District Court
and the Court of Appeals.

18 The Court of Appeals fails to explain why the Central Hudson test,

which involved a restriction on commercial speech, should govern a case
involving the compelled funding of speech. Given the fact that the Court
of Appeals relied on Abood for the proposition that the program implicates
the First Amendment, it is difficult to understand why the Court of Appeals did not apply Abood's "germaneness" test.

475Cite as: 521 U. S. 457 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
Appeals concluded that the advertising program does not"directly advance" the purposes of the marketing orders because the Secretary had failed to prove that generic advertis-ing is any more effective in stimulating consumer demand
for the commodities than the advertising that might otherwise be undertaken by producers acting independently. Wefind this an odd burden of proof to assign to the administrator of marketing orders that reflect a policy of displacingunrestrained competition with Government supervised cooperative marketing programs. If there were no marketingorders at all to set maturity levels, size, quantity, and other
features, competition might well generate greater production
of nectarines, peaches, and plums. It may also be true that
if there were no generic advertising, competition would generate even more advertising and an even larger consumer
demand than does the cooperative program. But the potential benefits of individual advertising do not bear on the
question whether generic advertising directly advances the
statute's collectivist goals. Independent advertising would
be primarily motivated by the individual competitor's interest in maximizing its own sales, rather than in increasing the
overall consumption of a particular commodity. While the
First Amendment unquestionably protects the individual
producer's right to advertise its own brands, the statute is
designed to further the economic interests of the producers
as a group. The basic policy decision that underlies the entire statute rests on an assumption that in the volatile markets for agricultural commodities the public will be best
served by compelling cooperation among producers in making economic decisions that would be made independently
in a free market. It is illogical, therefore, to criticize any
cooperative program authorized by this statute on the
ground that competition would provide greater benefits than
joint action.

On occasion it is appropriate to emphasize the difference
between policy judgments and constitutional adjudication.

476 GLICKMAN v. WILEMAN BROTHERS & ELLIOTT, INC.

Opinion of the Court
Judges who have endorsed the view that the Sherman Act isa charter of economic liberty

19 naturally approach laws that

command competitors to participate in joint ventures witha jaundiced eye. Doubts concerning the policy judgments

that underlie many features of this legislation do not, how-ever, justify reliance on the First Amendment as a basis for
reviewing economic regulations. Appropriate respect forthe power of Congress to regulate commerce among the
States provides abundant support for the constitutionality ofthese marketing orders on the following reasoning.

Generic advertising is intended to stimulate consumer de-mand for an agricultural product in a regulated market.
That purpose is legitimate and consistent with the regula-tory goals of the overall statutory scheme. See $ 602(1).
At least a majority of the producers in each of the marketsin which such advertising is authorized must be persuaded
that it is effective, or presumably the programs would bediscontinued.

20 Whether the benefits from the advertising

justify its cost is a question that not only might be answereddifferently in different markets, but also involves the exercise of policy judgments that are better made by producersand administrators than by judges.

As with other features of the marketing orders, individualproducers may not share the views or the interests of others
in the same market. But decisions that are made by themajority, if acceptable for other regulatory programs, should
be equally so for promotional advertising. Perhaps moremoney may be at stake when a generic advertising program

enjoy the same strong presumption of validity that we ac-cord to other policy judgments made by Congress. The
mere fact that one or more producers "do not wish to foster"generic advertising of their product is not a sufficient reason
for overriding the judgment of the majority of market partic-ipants, bureaucrats, and legislators who have concluded that
such programs are beneficial.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.

It is so ordered.

The Court today finds no First Amendment right to befree of coerced subsidization of commercial speech, for two
principal reasons. First, the Court finds no discernible ele-ment of speech in the implementation of the Government's
marketing orders, beyond what it sees as "germane" to theundoubtedly valid, nonspeech elements of the orders. Second, the Court in any event takes the position that a personwho is neither barred from saying what he wishes, nor subject to personal attribution of speech he dislikes, has no FirstAmendment objection to mandatory subsidization of speech
unless it is ideological or political or contains a message withwhich the objecting person disagrees. I part company with
the Court on each of these closely related points. The legiti-macy of governmental regulation does not validate coerced
subsidies for speech that the government cannot show to bereasonably necessary to implement the regulation, and the
very reasons for recognizing that commercial speech fallswithin the scope of First Amendment protection likewise

justifies the protection of those who object to subsidizing itagainst their will. I therefore conclude that forced payment

for commercial speech should be subject to the same level ofjudicial scrutiny as any restriction on communications in that
category. Because I believe that the advertising schemehere fails that test, I respectfully dissent.

I
The nub of the Court's opinion is its reading of the line ofcases following

Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed., 431 U. S. 209(1977):

"Abood, and the cases that follow it, did not announce abroad First Amendment right not to be compelled to
provide financial support for any organization that con-ducts expressive activities. Rather, Abood merely recognized a First Amendment interest in not being com-pelled to contribute to an organization whose expressive
activities conflict with one's `freedom of belief.' " Ante,at 471 (quoting

Abood, supra, at 235).

While I certainly agree with the Court that a proper under-standing of Abood is necessary for the disposition of this case

(and will dwell on the scope of its holding at some lengthbelow), it seems to me that

Abood appears more readily inits proper size if we begin our analysis with two more basic

principles of First Amendment law: that speech as such issubject to some level of protection unless it falls within a
category, such as obscenity, placing it beyond the Amend-ment's scope, and that protected speech may not be made the
subject of coercion to speak or coercion to subsidize speech.

A
Even before we first recognized commercial speech protec-tion in Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U. S. 748 (1976), we had stated abasic proposition of First Amendment protection, that "[a]ll

ideas having even the slightest redeeming social importance. . . have the full protection of the guaranties [of the First

Amendment]," Roth v. United States, 354 U. S. 476, 484(1957). This premise was later echoed in Virginia Bd. of
Pharmacy, where we asked whether commercial speech "isso removed from any exposition of ideas, and from truth,
science, morality, and arts in general, in its diffusion of lib-eral sentiments on the administration of Government, that it
lacks all protection." 425 U. S., at 762 (citations and internalquotation marks omitted). The answer, of course, was no.

What stood against the claim of social unimportance forcommercial speech was not only the consumer's interest in
receiving information, id., at 763-764, but the commercialspeaker's own economic interest in promoting his wares.
"[W]e may assume that the advertiser's interest is a purelyeconomic one. That hardly disqualifies him from protection
under the First Amendment." Id., at 762. Indeed, so longas self-interest in providing a supply is as legitimate as the
self-interest underlying an informed demand, the law couldhardly treat the advertiser's economic stake as "utterly without redeeming social importance" and isolate the consumer'sinterest as the exclusive touchstone of commercial speech
protection.Nor is the advertiser 's leg itimate interest onedimensional. While the value of a truthful representationof the product offered is central, advertising's persuasive
function is cognizable, too. Like most advertising meant tostimulate demand, the promotions for California fruit at
issue here do more than merely provide objective informa-tion about a product's availability or price; they exploit all
the symbolic and emotional techniques of any modern adcampaign with messages often far removed from simple proposals to sell fruit.1 "Speech has the capacity to convey

complex substance, yielding various insights and interpre-tations depending upon the identity of the listener or the

reader and the context of its transmission. . . . The complexnature of expression is one reason why even so-called commercial speech has become an essential part of the publicdiscourse the First Amendment secures."

Florida Bar v.Went For It, Inc., 515 U. S. 618, 636 (1995) (

Kennedy, J.,dissenting). Since persuasion is an essential ingredient of

the competition that our public law promotes with consider-able effort, the rhetoric of advertising cannot be written off
as devoid of value or beyond protection, any more than canits power to inform. Of course, that value may well be of a
distinctly lower order than the importance of providing accu-rate factual information, and the inextricable linkage between advertising and underlying commercial transaction"may give [the government] a concomitant interest in the
expression itself," Edenfield v. Fane, 507 U. S. 761, 767 (1993)(citation and internal quotation marks omitted); see also 44
Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 517 U. S. 484, 499 (1996)(opinion of

Stevens, J.). But these considerations amountto nothing more than the premise justifying a merely moderate level of scrutiny for commercial speech regulationsgenerally: "the `commonsense' distinction between speech
proposing a commercial transaction, which occurs in an areatraditionally subject to government regulation, and other
varieties of speech." Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 514U. S. 476, 482 (1995) (citations and internal quotation marks

protectible as a speaker's chosen medium of commercial enterprise, it becomes subject to a second First Amendment
principle: that compelling cognizable speech officially is just
as suspect as suppressing it, and is typically subject to the
same level of scrutiny. In Riley v. National Federation of
Blind of N. C., Inc., 487 U. S. 781 (1988), for example, the
State argued that "the First Amendment interest in compelled speech is different [from] the interest in compelled
silence," and ought therefore to merit a more "deferential
test." Id., at 796. We rejected that argument out of hand:
"There is certainly some difference between compelled
speech and compelled silence, but in the context of protected
speech, the difference is without constitutional significance,
for the First Amendment guarantees `freedom of speech,' a
term necessarily comprising the decision of both what to say
and what not to say." Id., at 796-797; see also Hurley v.
Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc., 515 U. S. 557, 573 (1995) ("Since all speech inherently involves choices of what to say and what to leave unsaid, one important manifestation of the principle of free
speech is that one who chooses to speak may also decide what
not to say" (citations and internal quotation marks omitted));
Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U. S. 705, 714 (1977) ("[T]he right
of freedom of thought protected by the First Amendment
against state action includes both the right to speak freely
and the right to refrain from speaking at all"); West Virginia
Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624, 633 (1943) ("[I]nvoluntary affirmation c[an] be commanded only on even more immediate and urgent grounds than silence").

As a familiar corollary to the principle that what may not
be suppressed may not be coerced, we have recognized (thus
far, outside the context of commercial speech) that individuals have a First Amendment interest in freedom from compulsion to subsidize speech and other expressive activities

undertaken by private and quasi-private organizations.2We first considered this issue in

Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed.,
431 U. S. 209 (1977), in addressing the First Amendmentclaims of dissenting employees subject to an "agency-shop"

agreement between their government employer and a union.
The agreement required each employee to pay the union a"service fee" equal to the dues required of union members,

but limited no one's right to speak separately and obliged noemployee to join the union, personally espouse unionism,
or participate in the union in any other way. Id., at 212.Thus, as in this case, the sole imposition upon nonmembers
was the assessment to help pay for the union's activities.And yet, purely financial as the imposition was, we held that
the union's use of dissenters' service fees for expressive
purposes unrelated to collective bargaining violated theFirst Amendment rights of those employees. In so holding,

Abood drew together several lines of First Amendment doctrine; after recognizing the parallels between expression per
se and associating for expressive purposes, id., at 233-234,
the Court relied on compelled-speech cases such as Barnette,
supra, in concluding that just as the government may not
(without a compelling reason) prohibit a person from contributing money to propagate ideas, neither may it force an
individual to contribute money to support some group's
distinctly expressive activities, id., at 234-235. We have repeatedly adhered to this reasoning in cases of compelled contributions to unions in agency shops, see, e. g., Lehnert v.
Ferris Faculty Assn., 500 U. S. 507 (1991); Teachers v. Hudson, 475 U. S. 292 (1986); Ellis v. Railway Clerks, 466 U. S.

2 The Secretary of Agriculture does not argue that the advertisements
at issue represent so-called "government speech," with respect to which
the Government may have greater latitude in selecting content than otherwise permissible under the First Amendment, see Keller v. State Bar of
Cal., 496 U. S. 1, 10-13 (1990); Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed., 431 U. S. 209,

435 (1984) (statutory case); Machinists v. Street, 367 U. S.740 (1961) (statutory case anticipating Abood), and have followed the same rationale in holding that state-compelleddues to an integrated bar association may not constitutionally be used to advance political and ideological causesdistinct from the core objectives of professional regulation,
Keller v. State Bar of Cal., 496 U. S. 1 (1990).

C
The Court recognizes the centrality of the Abood line ofauthority for resolving today's case, but draws the wrong

conclusions from it. Since Abood struck down the man-datory "service fee" only insofar as it funded the union's
expression of support for "ideological causes not germaneto its duties as collective-bargaining representative," 431
U. S., at 235; see also id., at 232, the Court reads Abood forthe proposition that the First Amendment places no limits
on government's power to force one individual to pay foranother's speech, except when the speech in question both is
ideological or political in character and is not germane to anotherwise lawful regulatory program.

Ante, at 471-473.3

1
The Court's first mistaken conclusion lies in treatingAbood as permitting any enforced subsidy for speech that is

germane to permissible economic regulation, in the sensethat it relates to the subject matter of the regulation and

3 That is, the Court appears to hold that a compelled subsidy of speech
does not implicate the First Amendment if the speech either is germane
to an otherwise permissible regulatory scheme or is nonideological, so that
each of these characteristics constitutes an independent, sufficient criterion for upholding the subsidy. See, e. g., ante, at 473 ("[The Abood] test
is clearly satisfied in this case because (1) the generic advertising of California peaches and nectarines is unquestionably germane to the purposes
of the marketing orders and, (2) in any event, the assessments are not
used to fund ideological activities" (emphasis added)).

tends to further its objectives. But Abood and its subse-quent line of cases are not nearly so permissive as the Court

makes out. In Abood, we recognized that even in mattersdirectly related to collective bargaining, compulsory funding
of union activities has an impact on employees' First Amendment interests, since the employees might disagree with po-sitions taken by the union on issues such as the inclusion of

abortion in a medical benefit plan, or negotiating no-strikeagreements, or even the desirability of unionism in general.
431 U. S., at 222. To be sure, we concluded that any inter-ference with such interests was "constitutionally justified by
the legislative assessment of the important contribution of
the union shop to the system of labor relations established
by Congress." Ibid.; see also Keller, supra, at 13-14 ("[T]he
State's interest in regulating the legal profession and improving the quality of legal services" justifies "the compelled
association [inherent in the] integrated bar"). But this was
simply a way of saying that the government's objective of
guaranteeing the opportunity for a union shop, the importance and legitimacy of which were already settled, see
Abood, supra, at 217-232 (following Railway Employes v.
Hanson, 351 U. S. 225 (1956), and Machinists v. Street,
supra), could not be attained without the incidental infringements of the interests in unfettered speech and association
that petitioners there claimed. Collective bargaining, and
related activities such as grievance arbitration and contract
administration, are part and parcel of the very economic
transactions between employees and employer that Congress
can regulate, and which it could not regulate without these
potential impingements on the employees' First Amendment
interests. Abood is thus a specific instance of the general
principle that government retains its full power to regulate
commercial transactions directly, despite elements of speech
and association inherent in such transactions. See Ohralik
v. Ohio State Bar Assn., 436 U. S. 447, 456 (1978) (commercial
conduct may be regulated without offending First Amend521US2 Unit: $U85 [11-23-99 18:38:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ment despite use of language); Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U. S. 609, 634 (1984) (opinion of O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (in contrast toright of expressive association, "there is only minimal constitutional protection of the freedom of commercial association," because "the State is free to impose any rational regu-lation on the commercial transaction itself "); see also

New
York State Club Assn., Inc. v. City of New York, 487 U. S. 1,13 (1988) (constitutional right of expressive association is not

implicated by every instance in which individuals choosetheir associates);

Dallas v. Stanglin, 490 U. S. 19, 25 (1989)
(same); Ellis v. Railway Clerks, 466 U. S., at 456 (funding of

union social activities, as opposed to expressive activities,
has minimal connection with First Amendment rights).

Decisions postdating Abood have made clear, however,
that its limited sanction for laws affecting First Amendment
interests may not be expanded to cover every imposition
that is in some way "germane" to a regulatory program in
the sense of relating sympathetically to it. Rather, to survive scrutiny under Abood, a mandatory fee must not only
be germane to some otherwise legitimate regulatory scheme;
it must also be justified by vital policy interests of the government and not add significantly to the burdening of free
speech inherent in achieving those interests. Lehnert v.
Ferris Faculty Assn., 500 U. S., at 519; accord, Ellis, supra,
at 456.

Thus, in Lehnert eight Justices concluded that a teachers'
union could not constitutionally charge objecting employees
for a public relations campaign meant to raise the esteem
for teachers in the public mind and so increase the public's
willingness to pay for public education. See 500 U. S., at
528-529 (plurality opinion); id., at 559 (Scalia, J., concurring
in judgment in part and dissenting in part). "Expression of
this kind extends beyond the negotiation and grievanceresolution contexts and imposes a substantially greater
burden upon First Amendment rights than do [collective521US2 Unit: $U85 [11-23-99 18:38:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN

bargaining functions]." Id., at 528-529 (plurality opinion).The advertising campaigns here suffer from the same defect

as the public relations effort to stimulate demand for theteachers' product: a local union can negotiate a particular
contract for the benefit of a shop's whole labor force withoutglobally espousing the virtues of teachers, and (in the absence of further explanation) produce markets can be di-rectly regulated in the interest of stability and growth without espousing the virtues of fruit. They were, indeed, for aquarter century, and still are under the many agricultural
marketing orders that authorize no advertising schemes.See

infra, at 494-499. In each instance, the challenged bur-den on dissenters' First Amendment rights is substantially

greater than anything inherent in regulation of the commer-cial transactions. Thus, the

Abood line does not permit thisprogram merely because it is germane to the marketing

orders.4

4 The Court purports to find support for its more permissive reading of
the Abood "germaneness test" in a separate holding of Lehnert allowing
mandatory charges for portions of the union's internal newsletter, the
Teachers' Voice, that concerned " `teaching and education generally, professional development, unemployment, job opportunities, award programs
. . . , and other miscellaneous matters.' " Ante, at 473 (quoting Lehnert v.
Ferris Faculty Assn., 500 U. S. 507, 529 (1991)). But the Lehnert Court
noted that these communications, though plainly speech, were not "public
in nature," ibid.; the Teachers' Voice was the union's means of communicating with its members, not the public at large, see Lehnert v. Ferris
Faculty Assn.-MEA-NEA, 643 F. Supp. 1306, 1328 (WD Mich. 1986), aff'd,
881 F. 2d 1388 (CA6 1989), aff'd in part and rev'd in part on other grounds,
500 U. S. 507 (1991). In upholding charges for this type of internal communication, Lehnert simply followed our earlier decision in Ellis v. Railway Clerks, 466 U. S. 435 (1984), in which we reasoned that "[t]he union
must have a channel for communicating with the employees, including the
objecting ones, about its activities. [The union surely may] charge objecting employees for reporting to them about those activities it can charge
them for doing." Id., at 450-451. In other words, this type of internal
communication about chargeable activities, unlike the public advertising
campaign struck down in Lehnert, was necessary to the union's role as
collective-bargaining agent and imposed no greater burden on the em521US2 Unit: $U85 [11-23-99 18:38:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN

The Court's second misemployment of Abood and its successors is its reliance on them for the proposition that whengovernment neither forbids speech nor attributes it to an

objector, it may compel subsidization for any objectionablemessage that is not political or ideological. But this, of
course, is entirely at odds with the principle that speech sig-nificant enough to be protected at some level is outside the
government's power to coerce or to support by mandatory sub-sidy without further justification.

Supra, at 480-483. Since
a commercial speaker (who does not mislead) may generally
promote commerce as he sees fit, the government requires
some justification (such as its necessity for otherwise valid
regulation) before it may force him to subsidize commercial
speech to which he objects. While it is perfectly true that
cases like Abood and Keller did involve political or ideological speech, and the Court made reference to that character
in explaining the gravity of the First Amendment interests
at stake, nothing in those cases suggests that government
has free rein to compel funding of nonpolitical speech (which
might include art,5 for example, as well as commercial advertising). While an individual's First Amendment interest in
commercial speech, and thus the government's burden in justifying a regulation of it, may well be less weighty than the
interest in ideological speech, Abood continues to stand for
the proposition that being compelled to make expenditures

ployees' First Amendment interests than their compelled association with
the union in the first instance. In these respects, however, the instant
advertising programs are much more like the impermissible public relations campaign than the permissible internal communications at issue in
Lehnert.

5 Cf. Schad v. Mount Ephraim, 452 U. S. 61, 65 (1981) ("Entertainment,

as well as political and ideological speech, is protected; motion pictures,
programs broadcast by radio and television, and live entertainment, such
as musical and dramatic works, fall within the First Amendment
guarantee").

for protected speech "works no less an infringement of . . .constitutional rights" than being prohibited from making

such expenditures. 431 U. S., at 234. The fact that no priorcase of this Court has applied this principle to commercial
and nonideological speech simply reflects the fortuity thatthis is the first commercial speech subsidy case to come before us. 3

An apparent third ground for the Court's conclusion thatthe First Amendment is not implicated here is its assumption
that respondents do not disagree with the advertisementsthey object to subsidizing. See

ante, at 470, 471. But thisassumption is doubtful and would be beside the point even if

true. As the Court itself notes, ante, at 467-468, and n. 11,respondents do claim to disagree with the messages of some
promotions they are being forced to fund: some of the adspromote specific varieties of plums, peaches, and nectarines
marketed by respondents' competitors but not by respond-ents; other ads characterize California tree fruits as a generic and thus fungible commodity, whereas respondentsbelieve that their produce is superior to most grown in
California. While these points of disagreement may seemtrivial to the Court, they in fact relate directly to a vendor's
recognized First Amendment interest in touting his waresas he sees fit, so long as he does not mislead. Supra, at 479.
Whether the "central message," ante, at 470, of the genericadvertising is that all California peaches, plums, and nectarines are equally good, or that only the varieties and charac-teristics featured in the advertisements are desirable, respondents do indeed disagree with that message.In any event, the requirement of disagreement finds no
legal warrant in our compelled-speech cases. In Riley, forexample, we held that the free-speech rights of charitable
solicitors were infringed by a law compelling statements offact with which the objectors could not, and did not profess
to, disagree. See 487 U. S., at 797-798. See also Hurley,

515 U. S., at 573 ("[The] general rule, that the speaker hasthe right to tailor the speech, applies not only to expressions

U. S., at 635 (if the Free Speech Clause bars the governmentfrom making the flag salute a legal duty, nonconformist beliefs are not required to exempt one from saluting). Indeed,the

Abood cases themselves protect objecting employeesfrom being forced to subsidize ideological union activities unrelated to collective bargaining, without any requirementthat the objectors declare that they disagree with the positions espoused by the union. See, e. g., Teachers v. Hudson,475 U. S., at 301-302;

Abood, 431 U. S., at 234. Requiring aprofession of disagreement is likewise at odds with our holding two Terms ago that no articulable message is necessaryfor expression to be protected, Hurley, supra, at 569; protection of speech is not limited to clear-cut propositions sub-ject to assent or contradiction, but covers a broader sphere
of expressive preference. What counts here, then, is notwhether respondents fail to disagree with the generalized
message of the generic ads that California fruit is good, butthat they do indeed deny that the general message is as valuable and worthy of their support as more particular claimsabout the merits of their own brands. One need not "disagree" with an abstractionist when buying a canvas from arepresentational painter; one merely wishes to support a different act of expression. D

The Secretary of Agriculture has a further argument forminimizing or eliminating scrutiny of this subsidization mandate, which deserves some mention even though the Courtdoes not adopt it. The Secretary calls for lesser scrutiny of
forced payments for truthful advertising and promotion thanfor restrictions on commercial speech, on the ground that the
effect of compelled funding is to increase the sum of informa-tion to the consuming public. This argument rests, how521US2 Unit: $U85 [11-23-99 18:38:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ever, on the assumption that regulation of commercial speechis justified solely or largely on preservation of public access

to truthful information, an assumption we have already seento be inaccurate.

Supra, at 478-480. Truth is indeed a justifiable objective of commercial speech protection, but so is
nonmisleading persuasion directed to the advertiser's ownchoice of what to promote.

Although not cited by the Secretary, the closest pass atauthority for his limited rationale of commercial speech
protection is Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel of
Supreme Court of Ohio, 471 U. S. 626 (1985), our only examination of a commercial speech mandate before today. The
state law there required disclosures about the method of calculating a contingent fee when legal representation on that
basis was advertised. In speaking of the objecting lawyer's
comparatively modest interest in challenging the state requirement, we referred to protection of commercial speech
as "justified principally by the value to consumers of the information such speech provides . . . ." Id., at 651 (citation
omitted); see also Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U. S., at 765, 770; Rubin
v. Coors Brewing Co., 514 U. S., at 481. But this proposition
will not bear the weight of the Government's position. We
said "principally," not exclusively, and proceeded to uphold
the state requirement not because a regulation adding to
public information is immune from scrutiny, but because the
mandate at issue bore a reasonable relation to the "State's

For the reasons discussed above, none of the Court'sgrounds suffices for discounting respondents' interests in

expression here and treating these compelled advertisingschemes as regulations of purely economic conduct instead
of commercial speech. I would therefore adhere to the prin-ciple laid down in our compelled-speech cases: laws requiring
an individual to engage in or pay for expressive activitiesare reviewed under the same standard that applies to laws
prohibiting one from engaging in or paying for such activi-ties. Under the test for commercial speech, the law may be
held constitutional only if (1) the interest being pursued bythe government is substantial, and (2) the regulation directly
advances that interest and (3) is narrowly tailored to serveit.

schemes are not removed from the commercial category on the grounds
that they are content based, producing not mere "dissemination of `purely
factual and uncontroversial information,' " Hurley v. Irish-American Gay,

of strict scrutiny. And we have consistently held that advertising does
not automatically lose its character as commercial speech simply because
it may do much more than propose a transaction or disseminate purely
factual information. See, e. g., Board of Trustees of State Univ. of N. Y.

(1989). In this case, the Secretary has failed to establishthat the challenged advertising programs satisfy any of these
three prongs of the Central Hudson test.

A
The express purposes of the Agricultural MarketingAgreement Act of 1937 (AMAA or Act), 7 U. S. C. $ 601

et seq., including the advertising programs established underit, are to stabilize markets for covered agricultural products
and maintain the prices received by farmers. $$ 602(1), (4);see also Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act
of 1996 (FAIR Act) $$ 501(b)(1), (3), Pub. L. 104-127, 110Stat. 888, 1030 (finding by Congress that the purpose of agricultural commodity promotion laws is to maintain and ex-pand the market for covered commodities).

true that at a general level these are substantial governmentinterests, and unless there were some reason to doubt that

undue market instability or income fluctuation has in factaffected a given segment of the economy, governmental

Corp., 463 U. S. 60, 66-68 (1983). The concept of commercial speech would
be reduced to a relic if the threshold for imposing strict scrutiny were
reached simply because certain advertisements evoke vaguely nostalgic
themes of indeterminate political import or because the hypersensitive
may see the specter of sex in the film of a child eating a peach.

7 A subtitle of the FAIR Act, which was enacted on April 4, 1996, authorizes promotion and advertising orders for any agricultural commodity.
Its procedural mechanisms are similar to those put in place by the AMAA,
although there is one noticeable difference (other than breadth of coverage) between the two laws: orders issued under the FAIR Act, unlike
those under the AMAA, must be national in scope. FAIR Act $$ 511-526,

any other federal or state law, such as the AMAA, authorizing promotion

efforts to address such problems would require little to sat-isfy the first

Central Hudson criterion that a substantial
government interest be the object of the regulation. Thus,if the Government were to attack these problems across an

interstate market for a given agricultural commodity or
group of them, the substantiality of the national interestwould not be open to apparent question, and the sole issues

under Central Hudson would seem to be whether the meanschosen were sufficiently direct and well tailored. But when
the government's program targets expression in only a nar-row band of a broad spectrum of similar market activities in
which its interests appear to be at stake, a question naturally
does arise. For the arbitrariness or underinclusiveness of
the scheme chosen by the government may well suggest that
the asserted interests either are not pressing or are not the
real objects animating the restriction on speech. See Rubin
v. Coors Brewing Co., 514 U. S., at 489 ("[E]xemptions and
inconsistencies" in alcohol labeling ban "bring into question
the purpose of the . . . ban," such that it does not survive the
Central Hudson test); City of Ladue v. Gilleo, 512 U. S. 43,

first place"); Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, Inc., 507 U. S.

524, 540 (1989) ("[T]he facial underinclusiveness" of a regulation of speech "raises serious doubts about whether Florida
is, in fact, serving, with this statute, the significant interests"

government's obligation to establish the empirical reality of
the problems it purports to be addressing, see Turner
Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. 622, 664 (1994);
Edenfield v. Fane, supra, at 770-771, requires a sensible reason for drawing the line between those instances in which
the government burdens First Amendment freedom in the
name of the asserted interest and those in which it does not.

Here, the AMAA's authorization of compelled advertisingprograms is so random and so randomly implemented, in

light of the Act's stated purposes, as to unsettle any infer-ence that the Government's asserted interest is either substantial or even real. First, the Act authorizes paid adver-tising programs in marketing orders for 25 listed fruits, nuts,
vegetables, and eggs, but not for any other agricultural com-modity. See 7 U. S. C. $ 608c(6)(I).

8 The list includes onions

but not garlic, tomatoes but not cucumbers, Tokay grapesbut not other grapes, and so on. The selection is puzzling.

The only thing the limited list unambiguously shows is thata need for promotional control does not go hand-in-hand with
a need for market and economic stability, since the authoriza-tion for marketing orders bears no such narrow restriction
to specific types of produce. But no general criterion forselection is stated in the text, and neither Congress nor the
Secretary has so much as suggested that such a criterionexists. Instead, the legislative history shows that from time
to time Congress has simply amended the Act to add par-ticular commodities to the list at the request of interested
producers or handlers, without ever explaining why com8 Section 608c(6)(I) currently provides that marketing orders may include terms "[e]stablishing or providing for the establishment of production research, marketing research and development projects designed to
assist, improve, or promote the marketing, distribution, and consumption
or efficient production of any such commodity or product, the expense of
such projects to be paid from funds collected pursuant to the marketing

raisins, walnuts, tomatoes, or Florida-grown strawberries, such projects
may provide for any form of marketing promotion including paid advertising and with respect to almonds, filberts (otherwise known as hazelnuts),

pelled advertising programs were necessary for the specific
produce chosen and not others.9 The legislative history for
the bill authorizing paid advertising programs for plums,
nectarines, and several other commodities is a good case on
point. The record indicates merely that "[o]ver the past several years, numerous commodity groups have come to the
Congress and asked for authority to provide for [market
development and advertising] activities under the terms of
their agreement and it has always been granted. This bill
combines several such individual requests made by various
producer groups operating under marketing agreements or
orders." H. R. Rep. No. 89-846, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., 2
(1965). A letter from the Acting Secretary of Agriculture
appended to the cited House Report similarly accounts for
the choice of covered products solely by reference to grower
and handler interest. Id., at 3-4. Or, again, the legislative
history of the amendment adding "California-grown peaches"
to the list refers only to the view of the Department of Agri9 The substantive terms of marketing orders under the AMAA as originally enacted were generally limited to restrictions on the total marketable quantity of the commodity, allocations among handlers, disposition
of surplus quantities, and maintenance of reserve supplies. 7 U. S. C.

$ 608c(6) (1934 ed., Supp. III). For the first time in 1954, Congress permitted marketing orders to establish "marketing research and development projects designed to assist, improve, or promote the marketing, distribution, and consumption [of a] commodity or product, the expense of
such projects to be paid from funds collected pursuant to the marketing
order." 68 Stat. 906; 7 U. S. C. $ 608c(6)(I). Since then, Congress has repeatedly amended the Act to authorize, but only for specified commodities,
"any form of marketing promotion including paid advertising." Ibid.
The first such amendment, in 1962, allowed advertising programs for cherries, Pub. L. 87-703, 76 Stat. 632; similar schemes for plums and nectarines
followed in 1965, Pub. L. 89-330, 79 Stat. 1270, and for "California-grown
peaches" in 1971, Pub. L. 92-120, 85 Stat. 340; and today, various authorizations cover the 25 commodities listed in $ 608c(6)(I). The Act now
also permits crediting some or all of a handler's independent expenditures
for advertising against his assessment obligations with respect to six commodities (but not nectarines, plums, or peaches). Ibid.

culture that "any fruit or vegetable commodity group whichactively supports the development of a promotion program

by this means should be given an opportunity to do so."S. Rep. No. 92-295, p. 2 (1971). Nor do the proposed rulemakings for authorizing advertising programs in marketingorders carry findings that might explain why such programs
might be needed for the specified commodities but not oth-ers; the announcements rely instead on a "consensus of the
industry . . . that promotional activities . . . have been bene-ficial in increasing demand," 36 Fed. Reg. 8736 (1971)
(plums); see also 41 Fed. Reg. 14376-14377 (1976) (peaches).10Of course, when government goes no further than regulating the underlying economic activity, this sort of piecemeallegislation in answer to expressions of interest by affected
parties is plainly permissible, short of something so arbitrary
as to fail the rational basis test. See, e. g., Williamson v.
Lee Optical of Okla., Inc., 348 U. S. 483, 487-489 (1955).But when speech is at stake, the government fails to carry

its burden of showing a substantial interest when it doesnothing more than refer to a "consensus" within a limited
interest group that wants the regulation. Instead, the er-ratic pattern of regulation itself places the reality of any public or governmental interest in question, and a correlationwith nothing more than the priorities of particular interest
groups gives no reassuring answer.11

10 A possible exception is the proposed rulemaking for nectarines, which
refers to the relative unfamiliarity of the consuming public with nectarines, due in part to the fact that new varieties that could be marketed
nationally had only recently been developed. See 31 Fed. Reg. 5635, 5636
(1966). This solitary finding does not cure the other defects of the statutory scheme, however.

11 This does not mean that taking the views of the industry into account

in itself renders a program suspect. Both the AMAA and the more general authorization of compelled agricultural advertising programs recently
enacted as part of the FAIR Act require orders implementing such programs to be approved by producers and/or handlers in periodic referenda.

A second element of the arbitrary in this statutory andregulatory scheme inheres in the geographical limitations on

the marketing orders that include the advertising programschallenged in this case, which apply only to peaches, plums,
and nectarines grown in California, unaccompanied by coun-terparts for advertising the same commodities grown elsewhere. Some geographical restriction, it must be said,follows from the general provision of the AMAA limiting
marketing orders to the smallest production or marketingarea practicable and consistent with the policy of the Act.
See 7 U. S. C. $ 608c(11)(B). But this provision merely ex-plains why a substantial governmental interest in advertising a type of produce would have to be manifested in as manyorders under the AMAA as there are defined production or
marketing areas; it does nothing to explain the oddity that aGovernment interest worth vindicating should occur within
such geographically select boundaries and nowhere else, orto negate the suggestion of the evidence already mentioned,
that the Government's asserted interest is nothing more thanthe preference of a local interest group.

The oddity is most pronounced in the instance of peaches,since the statute itself authorizes forced advertising only in
marketing orders for "California-grown peaches," not inorders for peaches grown anywhere else in the country.

$ 608c(6)(I). Although California is the biggest peach-growing State, more than 30 others also grow peaches commercially and together typically account for about half of the
Stat. 1043-1044. Since the asserted purpose of these advertising schemes
is to increase demand for the covered commodities and thereby maintain
the income of producers and handlers, requiring periodic approval by those
most likely to benefit if a program is working as planned may serve as an
additional check on whether the purpose of the program is in fact being
achieved. Contrary to what the majority implies, see ante, at 476-477,
however, the mere vote of a majority is never enough to compel dissenters
to pay for private or quasi-private speech whose message they do not wish
to foster; otherwise, the First Amendment would place no limitation on
this type of majoritarian action.

national crop, and roughly two-thirds of the peaches soldfresh. See App. 389; U. S. Dept. of Agriculture, Agricultural

Statistics, 1995-96, p. V-23 (Table 294). Yet the non-California peaches are utterly ignored in the Government's
promotional orders. The challenged advertising campaignfor "California Summer Fruits," running in markets
throughout the United States and in Canada, see App. 341-343, 477-479, does not proclaim simply that peaches or the
other fruits are good things. Rather, as the Secretary tellsus, the advertising program "promotes California fruit as
unique." Brief for Petitioner 31. It may or may not be, but
promoting a crop from one State at the expense of essentially
the same thing grown in the others reveals nothing about asubstantial national interest justifying the National Government in restricting speech. Without more, the most reason-able inference is not of a substantial Government interest,
but effective politics on the part of producers who see thechance to spread their advertising costs. Nothing more
appears.12The Secretary makes no attempt to explain how the Act's
geographical scope restrictions relate to the asserted goalsof the advertising programs. The general restriction of
marketing orders to the smallest practicable area has beenpart of the Act since it became law, long before Congress
permitted compelled advertising, the authorization for whichwas simply grafted onto the existing Act as a convenient
vehicle for the funding schemes. See n. 9, supra; see also
S. Rep. No. 92-295, supra, at 2 (letter from Department ofAgriculture indicating that the AMAA "could provide the

facility for" financing commodity advertising programs).

12 While plum and nectarine production is more highly concentrated in
California, see U. S. Dept. of Agriculture, Agricultural Statistics, 1995-96,
pp. V-21, V-27 to V-28 (Tables 288, 304-308), the AMAA's requirement
that marketing orders cover the smallest geographical area practicable
still lacks any reasonable connection to the asserted purposes of the advertising programs instituted thereunder.

Nor does any explanation appear for restricting peach ad-vertising programs to California produce. Without some

explanation, one would expect something quite different,that a compelled advertising program of the National Government intended to increase consumer demand for an ag-ricultural commodity would apply to produce grown throughout the land. Indeed, in recently enacting the FAIR Act,which authorizes compulsory advertising programs for all
agricultural commodities on a national basis (but also leavesthe separate provisions of the AMAA intact, see $ 524, 110
Stat. 1047), Congress specifically found that "[t]he coopera-tive development, financing, and implementation of a coordinated national program of research, promotion, and infor-mation regarding agricultural commodities are necessary to
maintain and expand existing markets and to develop newmarkets for these commodities." $ 512(a)(7), id., at 1033
(emphasis added); see also $ 514(a)(2), id., at 1035 ("Eachorder issued under this section shall be national in scope").
The AMAA, of course, actually prohibits orders of nationalscope. In sum, these advertising schemes come with a statutory text and regulatory history so remote from the Gov-ernment's asserted interests as to undermine the reality, let
alone the substantiality, of the claims put forward by theSecretary in attempting to satisfy

Central Hudson's firstrequirement.

B
Even if the Secretary could establish a sufficiently sub-stantial interest, he would need also to show how the compelled advertising programs directly advance that interest,that is, how the schemes actually contribute to stabilizing
agricultural markets and maintaining farm income by stimu-lating consumer demand. To show this required causation,
the Secretary relies on cases concerning governmental banson particular advertising content, where we have accepted
the unremarkable presumption that advertising actuallyworks to increase consumer demand, so that limiting adver521US2 Unit: $U85 [11-23-99 18:38:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tising tends to soften it. See United States v. Edge Broad-casting Co., 509 U. S. 418, 428 (1993); Posadas de Puerto Rico

Associates v. Tourism Co. of P. R., 478 U. S. 328, 341-342(1986); Central Hudson, 447 U. S., at 569. This presumption
is not, however, automatically convertible into support for
the Secretary here. In the cases mentioned, the questionhas been whether some advertising (in the absence of the

government's ban) would be more effective in stimulatingdemand than no advertising (due to the ban). Here, in contrast, the causal question of direct advancement does not in-volve comparing the effectiveness of something with nothing, for even without the coercive promotional schemes therewould be some voluntary advertising. Thus, the question
here requires a comparison of the effectiveness of advertising under the Government's program with the effectivenessof whatever advertising would likely exist without it.

13

For this purpose, the Secretary correctly notes that the
effectiveness of the Government's regulation must be viewed
overall, considering the market behavior of growers and han-dlers generally, not just in its isolated application to one or

a few individuals such as respondents. Edge Broadcasting,
supra, at 427. The Secretary therefore argues that though
respondents have voiced the desire to do more individualadvertising if the system of mandatory assessments were

ended, other handlers who benefit from the Government's

13 Although they do not apply the Central Hudson test, the majority
does criticize the Court of Appeals' application of it as "illogical" insofar
as that court enquired whether collective advertising or purely private
advertising is more effective at stabilizing markets, because the Act's basic
policy is to achieve its economic goals by compelling cooperation in lieu
of independent, competitive decisionmaking. Ante, at 474-475. But the
extent to which the Act eliminates competition varies among different
marketing orders, and the spottiness of collective advertising schemes
under the Act demonstrates that there is no necessary connection between
some compelled economic cooperation and forced collective advertising.
There is thus nothing "illogical" in comparing the effectiveness of collective and private advertising schemes in the context of the marketing
order regime.

program might well become "free riders" if promotion were
to become wholly voluntary, to the point of cutting the sum
total of advertising done. That might happen. It is also
reasonably conceivable, though, that pure self-interest would
keep the level of voluntary advertising high enough that the
mandatory program could only be seen as affecting the details of the ads or shifting their costs, in either event without
effect on market stability or income to producers as a
group.14 We, of course, do not know, but these possibilities
alone should be fatal to the Government here, which has the
burden to establish the factual justification for ordering a
subsidy for commercial speech. Mere speculation about one
or another possibility does not carry the burden, see Turner
Broadcasting System, 512 U. S., at 664; Edenfield v. Fane,
507 U. S., at 770-771, and the Government has to show that
its mandatory scheme appreciably increases the total amount
of advertising for a commodity or somehow does a better job
of sparking the right level of consumer demand than a wholly
voluntary system would. There is no evidence of this in the
record here.

C

Finally, a regulation of commercial speech must be narrowly tailored to achieving the government's interests; there
must be a " `fit' between the legislature's ends and the means
chosen to accomplish those ends,--a fit . . . that represents
not necessarily the single best disposition but one whose

reduced the "problem" of free riders referred to by the Secretary, that
would not be a sufficient freestanding justification for the program.

does not alone empower the state to compel the speech to be paid for,"
Lehnert v. Ferris Faculty Assn., 500 U. S., at 556 (Scalia, J., concurring
in judgment in part and dissenting in part). We have never sustained a
restriction on speech solely because some individuals would ride free on
the private speech of others, but only when the free-rider problem arises
in serving other substantial governmental interests.

scope is in proportion to the interest served." Board of
Trustees of State Univ. of N. Y. v. Fox, 492 U. S., at 480 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). This sense offitness is not precise, to be sure, but it rules out a regulation

if "far less restrictive and more precise means" are available.
Id., at 479 (internal quotation marks omitted). Respondentsargue that the mandatory advertising schemes for California

peaches, plums, and nectarines fail this narrow tailoring re-quirement, because they deny handlers any credit toward
their assessments for some or all of their individual advertis-ing expenditures. The point is well taken. On its face, at
least, a credit system would be a far less restrictive and more
precise way to achieve the Government's stated interests,
eliminating as it would much of the burden on respondents'
speech without diminishing the total amount of advertising
for a particular commodity. Indeed, the remarkable thing is
that the AMAA itself provides for exactly such credits for
individual advertising expenditures under marketing orders
for almonds, filberts, raisins, walnuts, olives, and Florida
Indian River grapefruit, but not for other commodities.
7 U. S. C. $ 608c(6)(I).

The Secretary contends, however, that the purpose of individual "branded" advertising is to increase the market share
of a single handler, and so is at odds with the purpose of the
Government's mandatory program, which is to expand the
overall size of the market through the use of "generic" advertising for a commodity generally. See also FAIR Act

$$ 501(b)(6), (7), 110 Stat. 1030-1031 (congressional finding of
same). Perhaps so, but that does not tell us what to make
of the credit for, say, private raisin advertising. It would be
hard to imagine more effectively "branded" advertising than
promotions for Sun-Maid raisins, but the statute would allow
Sun-Maid a credit. Why would that be consistent with the
Government's generic objective, but a credit for respondents'
nectarine ads not be? The Government gives us no answer.
Without some further explanation, the statute on raisin ad521US2 Unit: $U85 [11-23-99 18:38:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN

vertising seems to reflect a conclusion that could reasonably
be drawn after examining some of the "branded" advertising
in the record before us. A consumer galvanized by respondents' depiction of "Mr. Plum," App. 542, might turn down a
plum by any other name, but I doubt it.15

I acknowledge that in implementing a credit program for
individual advertising in an otherwise valid compulsory program, the Government would need substantial leeway in determining whether such expenditures do in fact further the
goal of expanding markets generally. But where, as here,
no particular evaluation has been made, and the statute dealing with other fruit apparently assumes that some private
advertising does serve the common good, and everything
else is left to assertion, there could be no finding that a program completely denying credits for all individual advertis15 The Secretary also maintains that credit programs are appropriate for
market conditions specific to the almond industry, where a single producer
cooperative has a 92% share of the market for direct sales to consumers,
see Cal-Almond, Inc. v. United States Dept. of Agriculture, 14 F. 3d 429,
438, n. 9 (CA9 1993), because in such circumstances "certain types of individual and brand advertising may accomplish the government's goals of
market stability and increased consumption without creating a significant
free-rider problem." Brief for Petitioner 47. As with the Secretary's
other proffered justifications for the seemingly arbitrary choices made in
the AMAA provisions concerning advertising, this explanation rests on
nothing more than an unsubstantiated assertion, here about the effects
of brand advertising. Moreover, the legislative and regulatory history
provides no indication that this was the reason for permitting credits for
almonds, but not plums, nectarines, or California-grown peaches. To the
extent the record says anything, it seems to say quite the contrary of what
the Secretary claims. See S. Rep. No. 91-1204, p. 2 (1970) (incorporating

Although the government's obligation is not a heavy onein Central Hudson and the cases that follow it, we have understood it to call for some showing beyond plausibility, andthere has been none here. I would accordingly affirm the
judgment of the Ninth Circuit.

Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Scalia joins as toPart II, dissenting.

I
I join Justice Souter's dissent, with the exception ofPart II. My join is thus limited because I continue to disagree with the use of the Central Hudson balancing test andthe discounted weight given to commercial speech generally.
See 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 517 U. S. 484, 518-528 (1996) (

Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring injudgment) (criticizing

Central Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v.
Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 557 (1980)). Be-cause the regulation at issue here fails even the more lenient

Central Hudson test, however, it, a fortiori, would fail thehigher standard that should be applied to all speech, whether
commercial or not. II

I write separately to note my disagreement with the ma-jority's conclusion that coerced funding of advertising by others does not involve "speech" at all and does not even raisea First Amendment "issue." See ante, at 469-474. It is
one thing to differ about whether a particular regulation in-volves an "abridgment" of the freedom of speech, but it is
entirely another matter--and a complete repudiation of ourprecedent--for the majority to deny that "speech" is even at
issue in this case.

Thomas, J., dissenting
In numerous cases, this Court has recognized that payingmoney for the purposes of advertising involves speech.

1

The Court also has recognized that compelling speech raisesa First Amendment issue just as much as restricting speech.

2

Given these two elemental principles of our First Amend-ment jurisprudence, it is incongruous to suggest that forcing

fruitgrowers to contribute to a collective advertising cam-paign does not even

involve speech, while at the same timeeffectively conceding that forbidding a fruitgrower to make

those same contributions voluntarily would violate the FirstAmendment. Compare ante, at 470 (promotional regulations should be scrutinized under the same standard as otheranticompetitive aspects of the marketing orders), with ante,
at 469, and n. 12 (distinguishing this case as not involving a"restraint" on any producer's freedom to communicate with
any audience). Yet, that is precisely what the majority opin-ion does.

What we are now left with, if we are to take the majorityopinion at face value, is one of two disturbing consequences:

Either (1) paying for advertising is not speech at all, whilesuch activities as draft card burning, flag burning, armband

it could not restrict. In either case, surely we have lostour way.

may not "enact Mr. Herbert Spencer's Social Statics," Lochner v. New
York, 198 U. S. 45, 75 (1905) (Holmes, J., dissenting), and thus the Government has a considerable range of authority in regulating the Nation's economic structure, part of the Constitution--the First Amendment--does
enact a distinctly individualistic notion of "the freedom of speech," and
Congress may not simply collectivize that aspect of our society, regardless
of what it may do elsewhere.

CITY OF BOERNE v. FLORES, ARCHBISHOP OFSAN ANTONIO,

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 95-2074. Argued February 19, 1997--Decided June 25, 1997
Respondent, the Catholic Archbishop of San Antonio, applied for a building permit to enlarge a church in Boerne, Texas. When local zoning
authorities denied the permit, relying on an ordinance governing historic preservation in a district which, they argued, included the church,
the Archbishop brought this suit challenging the permit denial under,
inter alia, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA).
The District Court concluded that by enacting RFRA Congress exceeded the scope of its enforcement power under $ 5 of the Fourteenth
Amendment. The court certified its order for interlocutory appeal, and
the Fifth Circuit reversed, finding RFRA to be constitutional.

Held: RFRA exceeds Congress' power. Pp. 512-536.

(a) Congress enacted RFRA in direct response to Employment Div.,
Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U. S. 872, in which the
Court upheld against a free exercise challenge a state law of general
applicability criminalizing peyote use, as applied to deny unemployment
benefits to Native American Church members who lost their jobs because of such use. In so ruling, the Court declined to apply the balancing test of Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U. S. 398, which asks whether the law
at issue substantially burdens a religious practice and, if so, whether
the burden is justified by a compelling government interest. RFRA
prohibits "[g]overnment" from "substantially burden[ing]" a person's
exercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule of general
applicability unless the government can demonstrate the burden "(1)
is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and (2) is the
least restrictive means of furthering that . . . interest." 42 U. S. C.

$ 2000bb-1. RFRA's mandate applies to any branch of Federal or State
Government, to all officials, and to other persons acting under color of
law. $ 2000bb-2(1). Its universal coverage includes "all Federal and
State law, and the implementation of that law, whether statutory or
otherwise, and whether adopted before or after [RFRA's enactment]."

$ 2000bb-3(a). Pp. 512-516.

(b) In imposing RFRA's requirements on the States, Congress relied
on the Fourteenth Amendment, which, inter alia, guarantees that no
State shall make or enforce any law depriving any person of "life, lib521US2 Unit: $U86 [11-20-99 14:39:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN
508 CITY OF BOERNE v. FLORES

Syllabus
erty, or property, without due process of law," or denying any person
the "equal protection of the laws," $ 1, and empowers Congress "to enforce" those guarantees by "appropriate legislation," $ 5. Respondent
Archbishop and the United States contend that RFRA is permissible
enforcement legislation under $ 5. Although Congress certainly can
enact legislation enforcing the constitutional right to the free exercise
of religion, see, e. g., Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U. S. 296, 303, its $ 5
power "to enforce" is only preventive or "remedial," South Carolina v.
Katzenbach, 383 U. S. 301, 326. The Amendment's design and $ 5's text
are inconsistent with any suggestion that Congress has the power to
decree the substance of the Amendment's restrictions on the States.
Legislation which alters the Free Exercise Clause's meaning cannot be
said to be enforcing the Clause. Congress does not enforce a constitutional right by changing what the right is. While the line between
measures that remedy or prevent unconstitutional actions and measures
that make a substantive change in the governing law is not easy to
discern, and Congress must have wide latitude in determining where
it lies, the distinction exists and must be observed. There must be a
congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or
remedied and the means adopted to that end. Lacking such a connection, legislation may become substantive in operation and effect. The
need to distinguish between remedy and substance is supported by the
Fourteenth Amendment's history and this Court's case law, see, e. g.,
Civil Rights Cases, 109 U. S. 3, 13-14, 15; Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U. S.
112, 209, 296. The Amendment's design has proved significant also in
maintaining the traditional separation of powers between Congress and
the Judiciary, depriving Congress of any power to interpret and elaborate on its meaning by conferring self-executing substantive rights
against the States, cf. id., at 325, and thereby leaving the interpretive
power with the Judiciary. Pp. 516-529.

(c) RFRA is not a proper exercise of Congress' $ 5 enforcement power
because it contradicts vital principles necessary to maintain separation
of powers and the federal-state balance. An instructive comparison
may be drawn between RFRA and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, provisions of which were upheld in Katzenbach, supra, and subsequent voting
rights cases. In contrast to the record of widespread and persisting
racial discrimination which confronted Congress and the Judiciary in
those cases, RFRA's legislative record lacks examples of any instances
of generally applicable laws passed because of religious bigotry in the
past 40 years. Rather, the emphasis of the RFRA hearings was on
laws like the one at issue that place incidental burdens on religion. It
is difficult to maintain that such laws are based on animus or hostility to
the burdened religious practices or that they indicate some widespread

Syllabus
pattern of religious discrimination in this country. RFRA's most serious shortcoming, however, lies in the fact that it is so out of proportion
to a supposed remedial or preventive object that it cannot be understood
as responsive to, or designed to prevent, unconstitutional behavior. It
appears, instead, to attempt a substantive change in constitutional protections, proscribing state conduct that the Fourteenth Amendment itself does not prohibit. Its sweeping coverage ensures its intrusion at
every level of government, displacing laws and prohibiting official actions of almost every description and regardless of subject matter. Its
restrictions apply to every government agency and official, $ 2000bb-
2(1), and to all statutory or other law, whether adopted before or after
its enactment, $ 2000bb-3(a). It has no termination date or termination
mechanism. Any law is subject to challenge at any time by any individual who claims a substantial burden on his or her free exercise of religion. Such a claim will often be difficult to contest. See Smith, supra,
at 887. Requiring a State to demonstrate a compelling interest and
show that it has adopted the least restrictive means of achieving that
interest is the most demanding test known to constitutional law. 494
U. S., at 888. Furthermore, the least restrictive means requirement
was not used in the pre-Smith jurisprudence RFRA purported to codify.
All told, RFRA is a considerable congressional intrusion into the States'
traditional prerogatives and general authority to regulate for the health
and welfare of their citizens, and is not designed to identify and counteract state laws likely to be unconstitutional because of their treatment of
religion. Pp. 529-536.

style of the region's earlier history. The church seats about230 worshippers, a number too small for its growing parish.

Some 40 to 60 parishioners cannot be accommodated at someSunday masses. In order to meet the needs of the congregation the Archbishop of San Antonio gave permission to theparish to plan alterations to enlarge the building.

A few months later, the Boerne City Council passed anordinance authorizing the city's Historic Landmark Commission to prepare a preservation plan with proposed historiclandmarks and districts. Under the ordinance, the commission must preapprove construction affecting historic land-marks or buildings in a historic district.

Soon afterwards, the Archbishop applied for a buildingpermit so construction to enlarge the church could proceed.
City authorities, relying on the ordinance and the designa-tion of a historic district (which, they argued, included the
church), denied the application. The Archbishop broughtthis suit challenging the permit denial in the United States
District Court for the Western District of Texas. 877F. Supp. 355 (1995).

The complaint contained various claims, but to this pointthe litigation has centered on RFRA and the question of its
constitutionality. The Archbishop relied upon RFRA as onebasis for relief from the refusal to issue the permit. The
District Court concluded that by enacting RFRA Congressexceeded the scope of its enforcement power under $ 5 of the
Fourteenth Amendment. The court certified its order forinterlocutory appeal and the Fifth Circuit reversed, finding
RFRA to be constitutional. 73 F. 3d 1352 (1996). Wegranted certiorari, 519 U. S. 926 (1996), and now reverse.

Opinion of the Court
Native American Church who were denied unemployment
benefits when they lost their jobs because they had used peyote. Their practice was to ingest peyote for sacramental
purposes, and they challenged an Oregon statute of general
applicability which made use of the drug criminal. In evaluating the claim, we declined to apply the balancing test set
forth in Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U. S. 398 (1963), under which
we would have asked whether Oregon's prohibition substantially burdened a religious practice and, if it did, whether the
burden was justified by a compelling government interest.
We stated:

"[G]overnment's ability to enforce generally applicable
prohibitions of socially harmful conduct . . . cannot depend on measuring the effects of a governmental action
on a religious objector's spiritual development. To
make an individual's obligation to obey such a law contingent upon the law's coincidence with his religious
beliefs, except where the State's interest is `compelling'
. . . contradicts both constitutional tradition and common
sense." 494 U. S., at 885 (internal quotation marks and
citations omitted).

The application of the Sherbert test, the Smith decision explained, would have produced an anomaly in the law, a constitutional right to ignore neutral laws of general applicability.
The anomaly would have been accentuated, the Court reasoned, by the difficulty of determining whether a particular
practice was central to an individual's religion. We explained, moreover, that it "is not within the judicial ken to
question the centrality of particular beliefs or practices to a
faith, or the validity of particular litigants' interpretations of
those creeds." 494 U. S., at 887 (internal quotation marks
and citation omitted).

The only instances where a neutral, generally applicable
law had failed to pass constitutional muster, the Smith Court

noted, were cases in which other constitutional protectionswere at stake.

Id., at 881-882. In Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406
U. S. 205 (1972), for example, we invalidated Wisconsin'smandatory school-attendance law as applied to Amish parents who refused on religious grounds to send their children
to school. That case implicated not only the right to the freeexercise of religion but also the right of parents to control

their children's education.The

Smith decision acknowledged the Court had employed
the Sherbert test in considering free exercise challenges tostate unemployment compensation rules on three occasions

where the balance had tipped in favor of the individual. See
Sherbert, supra; Thomas v. Review Bd. of Indiana Employment Security Div., 450 U. S. 707 (1981); Hobbie v. Unemployment Appeals Comm'n of Fla., 480 U. S. 136 (1987).
Those cases, the Court explained, stand for "the proposition
that where the State has in place a system of individual exemptions, it may not refuse to extend that system to cases
of religious hardship without compelling reason." 494 U. S.,
at 884 (internal quotation marks omitted). By contrast,
where a general prohibition, such as Oregon's, is at issue,
"the sounder approach, and the approach in accord with the
vast majority of our precedents, is to hold the test inapplicable to [free exercise] challenges." Id., at 885. Smith held
that neutral, generally applicable laws may be applied to religious practices even when not supported by a compelling
governmental interest.

Four Members of the Court disagreed. They argued the
law placed a substantial burden on the Native American
Church members so that it could be upheld only if the law
served a compelling state interest and was narrowly tailored
to achieve that end. Id., at 894. Justice O'Connor concluded Oregon had satisfied the test, while Justice Blackmun,
joined by Justice Brennan and Justice Marshall, could see no
compelling interest justifying the law's application to the
members.

Opinion of the Court
These points of constitutional interpretation were debatedby Members of Congress in hearings and floor debates.

Many criticized the Court's reasoning, and this disagreementresulted in the passage of RFRA. Congress announced:

"(1) [T]he framers of the Constitution, recognizing freeexercise of religion as an unalienable right, secured its
protection in the First Amendment to the Constitution;
"(2) laws `neutral' toward religion may burden religiousexercise as surely as laws intended to interfere with religious exercise;
"(3) governments should not substantially burden reli-gious exercise without compelling justification;

"(4) in Employment Division v. Smith, 494 U. S. 872(1990), the Supreme Court virtually eliminated the requirement that the government justify burdens on reli-gious exercise imposed by laws neutral toward religion; and
"(5) the compelling interest test as set forth in priorFederal court rulings is a workable test for striking sensible balances between religious liberty and competingprior governmental interests." 42 U. S. C. $ 2000bb(a).

The Act's stated purposes are:

"(1) to restore the compelling interest test as set forthin Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U. S. 398 (1963) and Wisconsin

v. Yoder, 406 U. S. 205 (1972) and to guarantee its appli-cation in all cases where free exercise of religion is substantially burdened; and
"(2) to provide a claim or defense to persons whosereligious exercise is substantially burdened by government." $ 2000bb(b).
RFRA prohibits "[g]overnment" from "substantially bur-den[ing]" a person's exercise of religion even if the burden

results from a rule of general applicability unless the govern-ment can demonstrate the burden "(1) is in furtherance of

a compelling governmental interest; and (2) is the least re-strictive means of furthering that compelling governmental

interest." $ 2000bb-1. The Act's mandate applies to any"branch, department, agency, instrumentality, and official (or
other person acting under color of law) of the United States,"
as well as to any "State, or . . . subdivision of a State."$ 2000bb-2(1). The Act's universal coverage is confirmed in

$ 2000bb-3(a), under which RFRA "applies to all Federal andState law, and the implementation of that law, whether statutory or otherwise, and whether adopted before or after[RFRA's enactment]." In accordance with RFRA's usage of
the term, we shall use "state law" to include local and munici-pal ordinances.

Under our Constitution, the Federal Government is one ofenumerated powers.

McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat.
316, 405 (1819); see also The Federalist No. 45, p. 292 (C.Rossiter ed. 1961) (J. Madison). The judicial authority to

determine the constitutionality of laws, in cases and controversies, is based on the premise that the "powers of the leg-islature are defined and limited; and that those limits may

not be mistaken, or forgotten, the constitution is written."
Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 176 (1803).

Congress relied on its Fourteenth Amendment enforce-ment power in enacting the most far-reaching and substantial of RFRA's provisions, those which impose its require-ments on the States. See Religious Freedom Restoration
Act of 1993, S. Rep. No. 103-111, pp. 13-14 (1993) (Senate
Report); H. R. Rep. No. 103-88, p. 9 (1993) (House Report).
The Fourteenth Amendment provides, in relevant part:

. . . . .
"Section 5. The Congress shall have power to enforce,
by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article."

The parties disagree over whether RFRA is a proper exercise of Congress' $ 5 power "to enforce" by "appropriatelegislation" the constitutional guarantee that no State shall

deprive any person of "life, liberty, or property, without dueprocess of law," nor deny any person "equal protection of
the laws."

In defense of the Act, respondent the Archbishop con-tends, with support from the United States, that RFRA is

permissible enforcement legislation. Congress, it is said, isonly protecting by legislation one of the liberties guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause,the free exercise of religion, beyond what is necessary under
Smith. It is said the congressional decision to dispensewith proof of deliberate or overt discrimination and instead
concentrate on a law's effects accords with the settled understanding that $ 5 includes the power to enact legislationdesigned to prevent, as well as remedy, constitutional violations. It is further contended that Congress' $ 5 power isnot limited to remedial or preventive legislation.

All must acknowledge that $ 5 is "a positive grant of legis-lative power" to Congress,

641, 651 (1966). In Ex parte Virginia, 100 U. S. 339, 345-346 (1880), we explained the scope of Congress' $ 5 power in

the following broad terms:

"Whatever legislation is appropriate, that is, adapted to
carry out the objects the amendments have in view,
whatever tends to enforce submission to the prohibitions
they contain, and to secure to all persons the enjoyment
of perfect equality of civil rights and the equal protection of the laws against State denial or invasion, if not

prohibited, is brought within the domain of congres-sional power."

Legislation which deters or remedies constitutional viola-tions can fall within the sweep of Congress' enforcement
power even if in the process it prohibits conduct which is notitself unconstitutional and intrudes into "legislative spheres
of autonomy previously reserved to the States." Fitzpat-rick v. Bitzer, 427 U. S. 445, 455 (1976). For example, the
Court upheld a suspension of literacy tests and similar votingrequirements under Congress' parallel power to enforce the
provisions of the Fifteenth Amendment, see U. S. Const.,Amdt. 15, $ 2, as a measure to combat racial discrimination
in voting, South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U. S. 301, 308(1966), despite the facial constitutionality of the tests under
Lassiter v. Northampton County Bd. of Elections, 360 U. S.45 (1959). We have also concluded that other measures protecting voting rights are within Congress' power to enforcethe Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, despite the burdens those measures placed on the States. South Carolinav. Katzenbach, supra (upholding several provisions of the
Voting Rights Act of 1965); Katzenbach v. Morgan, supra(upholding ban on literacy tests that prohibited certain people schooled in Puerto Rico from voting); Oregon v. Mitchell,400 U. S. 112 (1970) (upholding 5-year nationwide ban on literacy tests and similar voting requirements for registeringto vote);

City of Rome v. United States, 446 U. S. 156, 161(1980) (upholding 7-year extension of the Voting Rights Act's

S.545 (1924) (upholding ban on medical prescription of intoxicating malt liquors as appropriate to enforce EighteenthAmendment ban on manufacture, sale, or transportation of

Opinion of the Court
Mitchell, supra, at 128 (opinion of Black, J.). In assessingthe breadth of $ 5's enforcement power, we begin with its

text. Congress has been given the power "to enforce" the"provisions of this article." We agree with respondent, of
course, that Congress can enact legislation under $ 5 enforcing the constitutional right to the free exercise of religion.The "provisions of this article," to which $ 5 refers, include

the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.Congress' power to enforce the Free Exercise Clause follows
from our holding in Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U. S. 296,303 (1940), that the "fundamental concept of liberty embodied in [the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause]
embraces the liberties guaranteed by the First Amendment." See also United States v. Price, 383 U. S. 787, 789
(1966) (there is "no doubt of the power of Congress to enforce
by appropriate criminal sanction every right guaranteed by
the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).

Congress' power under $ 5, however, extends only to "enforc[ing]" the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment.
The Court has described this power as "remedial," South
Carolina v. Katzenbach, supra, at 326. The design of the
Amendment and the text of $ 5 are inconsistent with the suggestion that Congress has the power to decree the substance
of the Fourteenth Amendment's restrictions on the States.
Legislation which alters the meaning of the Free Exercise
Clause cannot be said to be enforcing the Clause. Congress
does not enforce a constitutional right by changing what the
right is. It has been given the power "to enforce," not the
power to determine what constitutes a constitutional violation. Were it not so, what Congress would be enforcing
would no longer be, in any meaningful sense, the "provisions
of [the Fourteenth Amendment]."

While the line between measures that remedy or prevent
unconstitutional actions and measures that make a substantive change in the governing law is not easy to discern, and

Opinion of the Court
Congress must have wide latitude in determining where itlies, the distinction exists and must be observed. There

must be a congruence and proportionality between the in-jury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to
that end. Lacking such a connection, legislation may be-come substantive in operation and effect. History and our
case law support drawing the distinction, one apparent fromthe text of the Amendment.

1
The Fourteenth Amendment's history confirms the reme-dial, rather than substantive, nature of the Enforcement

Clause. The Joint Committee on Reconstruction of the 39thCongress began drafting what would become the Fourteenth
Amendment in January 1866. The objections to the Com-mittee's first draft of the Amendment, and the rejection of
the draft, have a direct bearing on the central issue of defin-ing Congress' enforcement power. In February, Republican
Representative John Bingham of Ohio reported the followingdraft Amendment to the House of Representatives on behalf
of the Joint Committee:

"The Congress shall have power to make all lawswhich shall be necessary and proper to secure to the

citizens of each State all privileges and immunities ofcitizens in the several States, and to all persons in the
several States equal protection in the rights of life, lib-erty, and property." Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess.,
1034 (1866).
The proposal encountered immediate opposition, whichcontinued through three days of debate. Members of Congress from across the political spectrum criticized theAmendment, and the criticisms had a common theme: The
proposed Amendment gave Congress too much legislativepower at the expense of the existing constitutional structure.
E. g., id., at 1063-1065 (statement of Rep. Hale); id., at 1082

521US2 Unit: $U86 [11-20-99 14:39:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
(statement of Sen. Stewart); id., at 1095 (statement of Rep.Hotchkiss);

id., at App. 133-135 (statement of Rep. Rogers).
Democrats and conservative Republicans argued that theproposed Amendment would give Congress a power to intrude into traditional areas of state responsibility, a power
inconsistent with the federal design central to the Constitu-tion. Typifying these views, Republican Representative

Robert Hale of New York labeled the Amendment "an utterdeparture from every principle ever dreamed of by the men
who framed our Constitution," id., at 1063, and warned thatunder it "all State legislation, in its codes of civil and criminal jurisprudence and procedure . . . may be overridden,
may be repealed or abolished, and the law of Congress established instead." Ibid. Senator William Stewart of Nevada
likewise stated the Amendment would permit "Congress to
legislate fully upon all subjects affecting life, liberty, and
property," such that "there would not be much left for the
State Legislatures," and would thereby "work an entire
change in our form of government." Id., at 1082; accord, id.,
at 1087 (statement of Rep. Davis); id., at App. 133 (statement
of Rep. Rogers). Some radicals, like their brethren "unwilling that Congress shall have any such power . . . to establish
uniform laws throughout the United States upon . . . the
protection of life, liberty, and property," id., at 1095 (statement of Rep. Hotchkiss), also objected that giving Congress
primary responsibility for enforcing legal equality would
place power in the hands of changing congressional majorities, ibid. See generally Bickel, The Original Understanding and the Segregation Decision, 69 Harv. L. Rev. 1, 57
(1955); Graham, Our "Declaratory" Fourteenth Amendment,
7 Stan. L. Rev. 3, 21 (1954).

As a result of these objections having been expressed from
so many different quarters, the House voted to table the proposal until April. See, e. g., B. Kendrick, Journal of the Joint
Committee of Fifteen on Reconstruction 215, 217 (1914);
Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., App. 115 (1871) (statement

Opinion of the Court
of Rep. Farnsworth). The congressional action was seen asmarking the defeat of the proposal. See The Nation, Mar.

8, 1866, p. 291 ("The postponement of the amendment . . . isconclusive against the passage of [it]"); New York Times,
Mar. 1, 1866, p. 4 ("It is doubtful if this ever comes before
the House again . . ."); see also Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1stSess., at App. 115 (statement of Rep. Farnsworth) (The

Amendment was "given its quietus by a postponement fortwo months, where it slept the sleep that knows no waking").
The measure was defeated "chiefly because many membersof the legal profession s[aw] in [it] . . . a dangerous centralization of power," The Nation, supra, at 291, and "many leading
Republicans of th[e] House [of Representatives] would not
consent to so radical a change in the Constitution," Cong.
Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., at App. 151 (statement of Rep.
Garfield). The Amendment in its early form was not again
considered. Instead, the Joint Committee began drafting a
new article of Amendment, which it reported to Congress on
April 30, 1866.

Section 1 of the new draft Amendment imposed selfexecuting limits on the States. Section 5 prescribed that
"[t]he Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate
legislation, the provisions of this article." See Cong. Globe,
39th Cong., 1st Sess., at 2286. Under the revised Amendment, Congress' power was no longer plenary but remedial.
Congress was granted the power to make the substantive
constitutional prohibitions against the States effective.
Representative Bingham said the new draft would give Congress "the power . . . to protect by national law the privileges and immunities of all the citizens of the Republic . . .
whenever the same shall be abridged or denied by the unconstitutional acts of any State." Id., at 2542. Representative
Stevens described the new draft Amendment as "allow[ing]
Congress to correct the unjust legislation of the States."
Id., at 2459. See also id., at 2768 (statement of Sen. Howard) ($ 5 "enables Congress, in case the States shall enact

laws in conflict with the principles of the amendment, to cor-rect that legislation by a formal congressional enactment").

See generally H. Brannon, The Rights and Privileges Guar-anteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution
of the United States 387 (1901) (Congress' "powers are only
prohibitive, corrective, vetoing, aimed only at undue processof law");

id., at 420, 452-455 (same); T. Cooley, Constitutional
Limitations 294, n. 1 (2d ed. 1871) ("This amendment of theConstitution does not concentrate power in the general government for any purpose of police government within theStates; its object is to preclude legislation by any State
which shall `abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens
of the United States' "). The revised Amendment proposal
did not raise the concerns expressed earlier regarding broad
congressional power to prescribe uniform national laws with
respect to life, liberty, and property. See, e. g., Cong. Globe,
42d Cong., 1st Sess., at App. 151 (statement of Rep. Garfield)
("The [Fourteenth Amendment] limited but did not oust the
jurisdiction of the State[s]"). After revisions not relevant
here, the new measure passed both Houses and was ratified
in July 1868 as the Fourteenth Amendment.

The significance of the defeat of the Bingham proposal was
apparent even then. During the debates over the Ku Klux
Klan Act only a few years after the Amendment's ratification, Representative James Garfield argued there were limits on Congress' enforcement power, saying "unless we ignore both the history and the language of these clauses we
cannot, by any reasonable interpretation, give to [$ 5] . . . the
force and effect of the rejected [Bingham] clause." Ibid.;
see also id., at App. 115-116 (statement of Rep. Farnsworth).
Scholars of successive generations have agreed with this assessment. See H. Flack, The Adoption of the Fourteenth
Amendment 64 (1908); Bickel, The Voting Rights Cases, 1966
S. Ct. Rev. 79, 97.

The design of the Fourteenth Amendment has proved significant also in maintaining the traditional separation of pow521US2 Unit: $U86 [11-20-99 14:39:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN
524 CITY OF BOERNE v. FLORES

Opinion of the Court
ers between Congress and the Judiciary. The first eightAmendments to the Constitution set forth self-executing

prohibitions on governmental action, and this Court has hadprimary authority to interpret those prohibitions. The Bingham draft, some thought, departed from that tradition byvesting in Congress primary power to interpret and elaborate on the meaning of the new Amendment through legisla-tion. Under it, "Congress, and not the courts, was to judge
whether or not any of the privileges or immunities were notsecured to citizens in the several States." Flack,

supra, at64. While this separation-of-powers aspect did not occasion

the widespread resistance which was caused by the propos-al's threat to the federal balance, it nonetheless attracted the
attention of various Members. See Cong. Globe, 39th Cong.,1st Sess., at 1064 (statement of Rep. Hale) (noting that Bill
of Rights, unlike the Bingham proposal, "provide[s] safe-guards to be enforced by the courts, and not to be exercised
by the Legislature"); id., at App. 133 (statement of Rep. Rog-ers) (prior to Bingham proposal it "was left entirely for the
courts . . . to enforce the privileges and immunities of thecitizens"). As enacted, the Fourteenth Amendment confers
substantive rights against the States which, like the pro-visions of the Bill of Rights, are self-executing. Cf. South
Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U. S., at 325 (discussing Fif-teenth Amendment). The power to interpret the Constitution in a case or controversy remains in the Judiciary.

2
The remedial and preventive nature of Congress' enforce-ment power, and the limitation inherent in the power, were

confirmed in our earliest cases on the Fourteenth Amend-ment. In the Civil Rights Cases, 109 U. S. 3 (1883), the
Court invalidated sections of the Civil Rights Act of 1875which prescribed criminal penalties for denying to any person "the full enjoyment of " public accommodations and con-veyances, on the grounds that it exceeded Congress' power

Opinion of the Court
by seeking to regulate private conduct. The EnforcementClause, the Court said, did not authorize Congress to pass

"general legislation upon the rights of the citizen, but correc-tive legislation, that is, such as may be necessary and proper
for counteracting such laws as the States may adopt or enforce, and which, by the amendment, they are prohibitedfrom making or enforcing . . . ."

Id., at 13-14. The power
to "legislate generally upon" life, liberty, and property, asopposed to the "power to provide modes of redress" against

offensive state action, was "repugnant" to the Constitution.
Id., at 15. See also United States v. Reese, 92 U. S. 214, 218
(1876); United States v. Harris, 106 U. S. 629, 639 (1883);
James v. Bowman, 190 U. S. 127, 139 (1903). Although the
specific holdings of these early cases might have been superseded or modified, see, e. g., Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v.
United States, 379 U. S. 241 (1964); United States v. Guest,
383 U. S. 745 (1966), their treatment of Congress' $ 5 power
as corrective or preventive, not definitional, has not been
questioned.

Recent cases have continued to revolve around the question whether $ 5 legislation can be considered remedial.
In South Carolina v. Katzenbach, supra, we emphasized that
"[t]he constitutional propriety of [legislation adopted under
the Enforcement Clause] must be judged with reference to
the historical experience . . . it reflects." 383 U. S., at 308.
There we upheld various provisions of the Voting Rights Act
of 1965, finding them to be "remedies aimed at areas where
voting discrimination has been most flagrant," id., at 315,
and necessary to "banish the blight of racial discrimination
in voting, which has infected the electoral process in parts
of our country for nearly a century," id., at 308. We noted
evidence in the record reflecting the subsisting and pervasive
discriminatory--and therefore unconstitutional--use of literacy tests. Id., at 333-334. The Act's new remedies, which
used the administrative resources of the Federal Government, included the suspension of both literacy tests and,

Opinion of the Court
pending federal review, all new voting regulations in coveredjurisdictions, as well as the assignment of federal examiners

to list qualified applicants enabling those listed to vote. Thenew, unprecedented remedies were deemed necessary given
the ineffectiveness of the existing voting rights laws, see id.,
at 313-315, and the slow, costly character of case-by-caselitigation,

id., at 328.
After South Carolina v. Katzenbach, the Court continuedto acknowledge the necessity of using strong remedial and

preventive measures to respond to the widespread and per-sisting deprivation of constitutional rights resulting from
this country's history of racial discrimination. See Oregon
v. Mitchell, 400 U. S., at 132 ("In enacting the literacy test
ban . . . Congress had before it a long history of the discriminatory use of literacy tests to disfranchise voters on account
of their race") (opinion of Black, J.); id., at 147 (Literacy tests
"have been used at times as a discriminatory weapon against
some minorities, not only Negroes but Americans of Mexican
ancestry, and American Indians") (opinion of Douglas, J.); id.,
at 216 ("Congress could have determined that racial prejudice is prevalent throughout the Nation, and that literacy
tests unduly lend themselves to discriminatory application,
either conscious or unconscious") (opinion of Harlan, J.); id.,
at 235 ("[T]here is no question but that Congress could legitimately have concluded that the use of literacy tests anywhere within the United States has the inevitable effect of
denying the vote to members of racial minorities whose inability to pass such tests is the direct consequence of previous governmental discrimination in education") (opinion of
Brennan, J.); id., at 284 ("[N]ationwide [suspension of literacy
tests] may be reasonably thought appropriate when Congress acts against an evil such as racial discrimination which
in varying degrees manifests itself in every part of the country") (opinion of Stewart, J.); City of Rome, 446 U. S., at 182

years of statutory remedies were necessary to counter the

Opinion of the Court
perpetuation of 95 years of pervasive voting discriminationis both unsurprising and unassailable"); Morgan, 384 U. S.,

at 656 (Congress had a factual basis to conclude that NewYork's literacy requirement "constituted an invidious discrimination in violation of the Equal Protection Clause").

3
Any suggestion that Congress has a substantive, non-remedial power under the Fourteenth Amendment is not

supported by our case law. In Oregon v. Mitchell, supra, at112, a majority of the Court concluded Congress had exceeded its enforcement powers by enacting legislation lower-ing the minimum age of voters from 21 to 18 in state and
local elections. The five Members of the Court who reachedthis conclusion explained that the legislation intruded into
an area reserved by the Constitution to the States. See 400U. S., at 125 (concluding that the legislation was unconstitutional because the Constitution "reserves to the States thepower to set voter qualifications in state and local elections")
(opinion of Black, J.); id., at 154 (explaining that the "Four-teenth Amendment was never intended to restrict the authority of the States to allocate their political power as theysee fit") (opinion of Harlan, J.);

id., at 294 (concluding thatStates, not Congress, have the power "to establish a qualification for voting based on age") (opinion of Stewart, J., joinedby Burger, C. J., and Blackmun, J.). Four of these five were
explicit in rejecting the position that $ 5 endowed Congresswith the power to establish the meaning of constitutional
provisions. See id., at 209 (opinion of Harlan, J.); id., at 296(opinion of Stewart, J.). Justice Black's rejection of this position might be inferred from his disagreement with Con-gress' interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause. See
id., at 125.There is language in our opinion in Katzenbach v. Morgan,
384 U. S. 641 (1966), which could be interpreted as acknowl-edging a power in Congress to enact legislation that expands

528 CITY OF BOERNE v. FLORES

Opinion of the Court
the rights contained in $ 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment.This is not a necessary interpretation, however, or even the

best one. In Morgan, the Court considered the constitution-ality of $ 4(e) of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which provided that no person who had successfully completed the
sixth primary grade in a public school in, or a private schoolaccredited by, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico in which

the language of instruction was other than English could bedenied the right to vote because of an inability to read or
write English. New York's Constitution, on the other hand,required voters to be able to read and write English. The
Court provided two related rationales for its conclusion that

$ 4(e) could "be viewed as a measure to secure for the Puerto
Rican community residing in New York nondiscriminatory
treatment by government." Id., at 652. Under the first rationale, Congress could prohibit New York from denying the
right to vote to large segments of its Puerto Rican community, in order to give Puerto Ricans "enhanced political
power" that would be "helpful in gaining nondiscriminatory
treatment in public services for the entire Puerto Rican community." Ibid. Section 4(e) thus could be justified as a remedial measure to deal with "discrimination in governmental
services." Id., at 653. The second rationale, an alternative
holding, did not address discrimination in the provision of
public services but "discrimination in establishing voter
qualifications." Id., at 654. The Court perceived a factual
basis on which Congress could have concluded that New
York's literacy requirement "constituted an invidious discrimination in violation of the Equal Protection Clause."
Id., at 656. Both rationales for upholding $ 4(e) rested on
unconstitutional discrimination by New York and Congress'
reasonable attempt to combat it. As Justice Stewart explained in Oregon v. Mitchell, supra, at 296, interpreting
Morgan to give Congress the power to interpret the Constitution "would require an enormous extension of that decision's rationale."

Opinion of the Court
If Congress could define its own powers by altering theFourteenth Amendment's meaning, no longer would the

Constitution be "superior paramount law, unchangeable byordinary means." It would be "on a level with ordinary legislative acts, and, like other acts, . . . alterable when thelegislature shall please to alter it."

Marbury v. Madison, 1Cranch, at 177. Under this approach, it is difficult to conceive of a principle that would limit congressional power.See Van Alstyne, The Failure of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment,46 Duke L. J. 291, 292-303 (1996). Shifting legislative majorities could change the Constitution and effectively circum-vent the difficult and detailed amendment process contained
in Article V.We now turn to consider whether RFRA can be considered enforcement legislation under $ 5 of the FourteenthAmendment.

B
Respondent contends that RFRA is a proper exercise ofCongress' remedial or preventive power. The Act, it is said,

is a reasonable means of protecting the free exercise of reli-gion as defined by Smith. It prevents and remedies laws
which are enacted with the unconstitutional object of target-ing religious beliefs and practices. See

Church of LukumiBabalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U. S. 520, 533 (1993) ("[A]

law targeting religious beliefs as such is never permissible").To avoid the difficulty of proving such violations, it is said,
Congress can simply invalidate any law which imposes a sub-stantial burden on a religious practice unless it is justified
by a compelling interest and is the least restrictive means ofaccomplishing that interest. If Congress can prohibit laws
with discriminatory effects in order to prevent racial dis-crimination in violation of the Equal Protection Clause, see
Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U. S. 448, 477 (1980) (pluralityopinion);

City of Rome, 446 U. S., at 177, then it can do thesame, respondent argues, to promote religious liberty.

530 CITY OF BOERNE v. FLORES

Opinion of the Court
While preventive rules are sometimes appropriate reme-dial measures, there must be a congruence between the

means used and the ends to be achieved. The appropriate-ness of remedial measures must be considered in light of the
evil presented. See South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383
U. S., at 308. Strong measures appropriate to address oneharm may be an unwarranted response to another, lesser

one. Id., at 334.A comparison between RFRA and the Voting Rights Act
is instructive. In contrast to the record which confrontedCongress and the Judiciary in the voting rights cases,
RFRA's legislative record lacks examples of modern instances of generally applicable laws passed because of religious bigotry. The history of persecution in this country detailed in the hearings mentions no episodes occurring in the
past 40 years. See, e. g., Religious Freedom Restoration Act
of 1991, Hearings on H. R. 2797 before the Subcommittee on
Civil and Constitutional Rights of the House Committee on
the Judiciary, 102d Cong., 2d Sess., 331-334 (1993) (statement
of Douglas Laycock) (House Hearings); The Religious Freedom Restoration Act, Hearing on S. 2969 before the Senate
Committee on the Judiciary, 102d Cong., 2d Sess., 30-31
(1993) (statement of Dallin H. Oaks) (Senate Hearing); id., at
68-76 (statement of Douglas Laycock); Religious Freedom
Restoration Act of 1990, Hearing on H. R. 5377 before the
Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights of the
House Committee on the Judiciary, 101st Cong., 2d Sess., 49
(1991) (statement of John H. Buchanan, Jr.) (1990 House
Hearing). The absence of more recent episodes stems from
the fact that, as one witness testified, "deliberate persecution is not the usual problem in this country." House Hearings 334 (statement of Douglas Laycock). See also House
Report 2 ("[L]aws directly targeting religious practices have
become increasingly rare"). Rather, the emphasis of the
hearings was on laws of general applicability which place incidental burdens on religion. Much of the discussion cen521US2 Unit: $U86 [11-20-99 14:39:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN

churches and synagogues. See, e. g., House Hearings 17, 57

Hearing 39 (statement of Robert P. Dugan, Jr.); see also Senate Report 8; House Report 5-6, and n. 14. It is difficult
to maintain that they are examples of legislation enacted or
enforced due to animus or hostility to the burdened religious
practices or that they indicate some widespread pattern of
religious discrimination in this country. Congress' concern
was with the incidental burdens imposed, not the object or
purpose of the legislation. See House Report 2; Senate Report 4-5; House Hearings 64 (statement of Nadine Strossen);
id., at 117-118 (statement of Rep. Stephen J. Solarz); 1990

This lack of support in the legislative record, however, is not
RFRA's most serious shortcoming. Judicial deference, in
most cases, is based not on the state of the legislative record
Congress compiles but "on due regard for the decision of

the body constitutionally appointed to decide." Oregon v.

Opinion of the Court
eral matter, it is for Congress to determine the method bywhich it will reach a decision.

Regardless of the state of the legislative record, RFRAcannot be considered remedial, preventive legislation, if
those terms are to have any meaning. RFRA is so out of
proportion to a supposed remedial or preventive object thatit cannot be understood as responsive to, or designed to

prevent, unconstitutional behavior. It appears, instead, toattempt a substantive change in constitutional protections.
Preventive measures prohibiting certain types of laws maybe appropriate when there is reason to believe that many
of the laws affected by the congressional enactment have asignificant likelihood of being unconstitutional. See

City of
Rome, 446 U. S., at 177 (since "jurisdictions with a demonstrable history of intentional racial discrimination . . . createthe risk of purposeful discrimination," Congress could "prohibit changes that have a discriminatory impact" in thosejurisdictions). Remedial legislation under $ 5 "should be
adapted to the mischief and wrong which the [Fourteenth][A]mendment was intended to provide against."

Civil
Rights Cases, 109 U. S., at 13.RFRA is not so confined. Sweeping coverage ensures its

intrusion at every level of government, displacing laws and
prohibiting official actions of almost every description and
regardless of subject matter. RFRA's restrictions apply
to every agency and official of the Federal, State, and local
Governments. 42 U. S. C. $ 2000bb-2(1). RFRA applies to
all federal and state law, statutory or otherwise, whether
adopted before or after its enactment. $ 2000bb-3(a).
RFRA has no termination date or termination mechanism.
Any law is subject to challenge at any time by any individual
who alleges a substantial burden on his or her free exercise
of religion.

The reach and scope of RFRA distinguish it from other
measures passed under Congress' enforcement power, even
in the area of voting rights. In South Carolina v. Katzenbach, the challenged provisions were confined to those re521US2 Unit: $U86 [11-20-99 14:39:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
gions of the country where voting discrimination had beenmost flagrant, see 383 U. S., at 315, and affected a discrete

class of state laws, i. e., state voting laws. Furthermore, toensure that the reach of the Voting Rights Act was limited
to those cases in which constitutional violations were most
likely (in order to reduce the possibility of overbreadth), thecoverage under the Act would terminate "at the behest of

States and political subdivisions in which the danger of sub-stantial voting discrimination has not materialized during
the preceding five years." Id., at 331. The provisions re-stricting and banning literacy tests, upheld in

Katzenbach v.
Morgan, 384 U. S. 641 (1966), and Oregon v. Mitchell, supra,attacked a particular type of voting qualification, one with a

long history as a "notorious means to deny and abridge voting rights on racial grounds." South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U. S., at 355 (Black, J., concurring and dissenting).
In City of Rome, supra, the Court rejected a challenge tothe constitutionality of a Voting Rights Act provision which

required certain jurisdictions to submit changes in electoralpractices to the Department of Justice for preimplementation review. The requirement was placed only on jurisdic-tions with a history of intentional racial discrimination in
voting. Id., at 177. Like the provisions at issue in South
Carolina v. Katzenbach, this provision permitted a covered
jurisdiction to avoid preclearance requirements under certain conditions and, moreover, lapsed in seven years. This
is not to say, of course, that $ 5 legislation requires termination dates, geographic restrictions, or egregious predicates.
Where, however, a congressional enactment pervasively prohibits constitutional state action in an effort to remedy or to
prevent unconstitutional state action, limitations of this kind
tend to ensure Congress' means are proportionate to ends
legitimate under $ 5.

The stringent test RFRA demands of state laws reflects
a lack of proportionality or congruence between the means
adopted and the legitimate end to be achieved. If an objector can show a substantial burden on his free exercise, the

Opinion of the Court
State must demonstrate a compelling governmental interestand show that the law is the least restrictive means of furthering its interest. Claims that a law substantially bur-dens someone's exercise of religion will often be difficult to
contest. See Smith, 494 U. S., at 887 ("What principle of
law or logic can be brought to bear to contradict a believer'sassertion that a particular act is `central' to his personal

faith?"); id., at 907 ("The distinction between questions ofcentrality and questions of sincerity and burden is admittedly fine . . .") (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment). Re-quiring a State to demonstrate a compelling interest and
show that it has adopted the least restrictive means ofachieving that interest is the most demanding test known
to constitutional law. If " `compelling interest' really means
what it says . . . , many laws will not meet the test. . . . [Thetest] would open the prospect of constitutionally required

religious exemptions from civic obligations of almost everyconceivable kind."

Id., at 888. Laws valid under Smith
would fall under RFRA without regard to whether they hadthe object of stifling or punishing free exercise. We make

these observations not to reargue the position of the major-ity in

Smith but to illustrate the substantive alteration of its
holding attempted by RFRA. Even assuming RFRA would
be interpreted in effect to mandate some lesser test, say, one
equivalent to intermediate scrutiny, the statute nevertheless
would require searching judicial scrutiny of state law with
the attendant likelihood of invalidation. This is a considerable congressional intrusion into the States' traditional prerogatives and general authority to regulate for the health
and welfare of their citizens.

The substantial costs RFRA exacts, both in practical
terms of imposing a heavy litigation burden on the States
and in terms of curtailing their traditional general regulatory power, far exceed any pattern or practice of unconstitutional conduct under the Free Exercise Clause as interpreted
in Smith. Simply put, RFRA is not designed to identify and
counteract state laws likely to be unconstitutional because of

Opinion of the Court
their treatment of religion. In most cases, the state lawsto which RFRA applies are not ones which will have been

motivated by religious bigotry. If a state law disproportion-ately burdened a particular class of religious observers, this
circumstance might be evidence of an impermissible legislative motive. Cf. Washington v. Davis, 426 U. S. 229, 241(1976). RFRA's substantial-burden test, however, is not

even a discriminatory-effects or disparate-impact test. It isa reality of the modern regulatory state that numerous state
laws, such as the zoning regulations at issue here, impose asubstantial burden on a large class of individuals. When the
exercise of religion has been burdened in an incidental wayby a law of general application, it does not follow that the
persons affected have been burdened any more than other
citizens, let alone burdened because of their religious beliefs.In addition, the Act imposes in every case a least restrictive

means requirement--a requirement that was not used in thepreSmith jurisprudence RFRA purported to codify--which
also indicates that the legislation is broader than is appro-priate if the goal is to prevent and remedy constitutional

violations.When Congress acts within its sphere of power and responsibilities, it has not just the right but the duty to make
its own informed judgment on the meaning and force of the
Constitution. This has been clear from the early days of the
Republic. In 1789, when a Member of the House of Representatives objected to a debate on the constitutionality of
legislation based on the theory that "it would be officious" to
consider the constitutionality of a measure that did not affect
the House, James Madison explained that "it is incontrovertibly of as much importance to this branch of the Government
as to any other, that the constitution should be preserved
entire. It is our duty." 1 Annals of Congress 500 (1789).
Were it otherwise, we would not afford Congress the presumption of validity its enactments now enjoy.

Our national experience teaches that the Constitution is
preserved best when each part of the Government respects

both the Constitution and the proper actions and determina-tions of the other branches. When the Court has interpreted the Constitution, it has acted within the province ofthe Judicial Branch, which embraces the duty to say what
the law is. Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch, at 177. Whenthe political branches of the Government act against the
background of a judicial interpretation of the Constitutionalready issued, it must be understood that in later cases and
controversies the Court will treat its precedents with therespect due them under settled principles, including

staredecisis, and contrary expectations must be disappointed.

RFRA was designed to control cases and controversies, suchas the one before us; but as the provisions of the federal
statute here invoked are beyond congressional authority,
it is this Court's precedent, not RFRA, which must control.

* * *
It is for Congress in the first instance to "determin[e]
whether and what legislation is needed to secure the guaran-tees of the Fourteenth Amendment," and its conclusions are

entitled to much deference. Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384U. S., at 651. Congress' discretion is not unlimited, however, and the courts retain the power, as they have since
Marbury v. Madison, to determine if Congress has exceeded
its authority under the Constitution. Broad as the power of
Congress is under the Enforcement Clause of the FourteenthAmendment, RFRA contradicts vital principles necessary to

maintain separation of powers and the federal balance. Thejudgment of the Court of Appeals sustaining the Act's constitutionality is reversed.

It is so ordered.

Justice Stevens, concurring.

If the historic landmark on the hill in Boerne happened tobe a museum or an art gallery owned by an atheist, it would

not be eligible for an exemption from the city ordinancesthat forbid an enlargement of the structure. Because the

exemption from a generally applicable, neutral civil law.Whether the Church would actually prevail under the statute or not, the statute has provided the Church with a legalweapon that no atheist or agnostic can obtain. This governmental preference for religion, as opposed to irreligion, is
forbidden by the First Amendment. Wallace v. Jaffree, 472

Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Stevens joins,concurring in part.

I write to respond briefly to the claim of Justice O'Connor's dissent (hereinafter the dissent) that historical materials support a result contrary to the one reached in Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 494
U. S. 872 (1990). See post, p. 544 (dissenting opinion). Weheld in

Smith that the Constitution's Free Exercise Clause
"does not relieve an individual of the obligation to comply
with a `valid and neutral law of general applicability on theground that the law proscribes (or prescribes) conduct that

his religion prescribes (or proscribes).' " 494 U. S., at 879(quoting

United States v. Lee, 455 U. S. 252, 263, n. 3 (1982)
(Stevens, J., concurring in judgment)). The material thatthe dissent claims is at odds with

Smith either has little to
say about the issue or is in fact more consistent with Smiththan with the dissent's interpretation of the Free Exercise

Clause. The dissent's extravagant claim that the historical
record shows Smith to have been wrong should be comparedwith the assessment of the most prominent scholarly critic

of Smith, who, after an extensive review of the historicalrecord, was willing to venture no more than that "constitu521US2 Unit: $U86 [11-20-99 14:39:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tionally compelled exemptions [from generally applicablelaws regulating conduct] were

within the contemplation of
the framers and ratifiers as a possible interpretation of thefree exercise clause." McConnell, The Origins and Historical Understanding of Free Exercise of Religion, 103 Harv.
L. Rev. 1409, 1415 (1990) (emphasis added); see also Ham-burger, A Constitutional Right of Religious Exemption: An

Historical Perspective, 60 Geo. Wash. Law Rev. 915 (1992)(arguing that historical evidence supports

Smith's interpretation of free exercise).The dissent first claims that

Smith's interpretation of the
Free Exercise Clause departs from the understanding reflected in various statutory and constitutional protections of
religion enacted by Colonies, States, and Territories in the
period leading up to the ratification of the Bill of Rights.
Post, at 550-557. But the protections afforded by those enactments are in fact more consistent with Smith's interpretation of free exercise than with the dissent's understanding of
it. The Free Exercise Clause, the dissent claims, "is best
understood as an affirmative guarantee of the right to participate in religious practices and conduct without impermissible governmental interference, even when such conduct conflicts with a neutral, generally applicable law"; thus, even
neutral laws of general application may be invalid if they
burden religiously motivated conduct. Post, at 546. However, the early "free exercise" enactments cited by the dissent protect only against action that is taken "for" or "in
respect of " religion, post, at 551-553 (Maryland Act Concerning Religion of 1649, Rhode Island Charter of 1663, and New
Hampshire Constitution); or action taken "on account of " religion, post, at 553-554 (Maryland Declaration of Rights of
1776 and Northwest Ordinance of 1787); or "discriminat[ory]"
action, post, at 553 (New York Constitution); or, finally (and
unhelpfully for purposes of interpreting "free exercise" in
the Federal Constitution), action that interferes with the
"free exercise" of religion, post, at 551, 554 (Maryland Act

Concerning Religion of 1649 and Georgia Constitution). Itis eminently arguable that application of neutral, generally

applicable laws of the sort the dissent refers to--such as zon-ing laws,

post, at 547--would not constitute action taken
"for," "in respect of," or "on account of " one's religion, or
"discriminatory" action.Assuming, however, that the affirmative protection of

religion accorded by the early "free exercise" enactmentssweeps as broadly as the dissent's theory would require,
those enactments do not support the dissent's view, sincethey contain "provisos" that significantly qualify the affirmative protection they grant. According to the dissent, the
"provisos" support its view because they would have been
"superfluous" if "the Court was correct in Smith that generally applicable laws are enforceable regardless of religious
conscience." Post, at 554-555. I disagree. In fact, the
most plausible reading of the "free exercise" enactments (if
their affirmative provisions are read broadly, as the dissent's
view requires) is a virtual restatement of Smith: Religious exercise shall be permitted so long as it does not violate general
laws governing conduct. The "provisos" in the enactments
negate a license to act in a manner "unfaithfull to the Lord
Proprietary" (Maryland Act Concerning Religion of 1649), or
"behav[e]" in other than a "peaceabl[e] and quie[t]" manner
(Rhode Island Charter of 1663), or "disturb the public peace"
(New Hampshire Constitution), or interfere with the "peace
[and] safety of th[e] State" (New York, Maryland, and Georgia
Constitutions), or "demea[n]" oneself in other than a "peaceable and orderly manner" (Northwest Ordinance of 1787).
See post, at 551-554. At the time these provisos were
enacted, keeping "peace" and "order" seems to have meant,
precisely, obeying the laws. "[E]very breach of a law is
against the peace." Queen v. Lane, 6 Mod. 128, 87 Eng. Rep.
884, 885 (Q. B. 1704). Even as late as 1828, when Noah Webster published his American Dictionary of the English Language, he gave as one of the meanings of "peace": "8. Public

tranquility; that quiet, order and security which is guaran-teed by the laws; as, to keep the peace; to break the peace."

2 An American Dictionary of the English Language 31(1828).

1 This limitation upon the scope of religious exercise

would have been in accord with the background political phi-losophy of the age (associated most prominently with John

Locke), which regarded freedom as the right "to do onlywhat was not lawfully prohibited," West, The Case Against
a Right to Religion-Based Exemptions, 4 Notre Dame J. L.,Ethics & Pub. Pol'y 591, 624 (1990). "Thus, the disturb-thepeace caveats apparently permitted government to deny re-ligious freedom, not merely in the event of violence or force,
but, more generally, upon the occurrence of illegal actions."Hamburger, supra, at 918-919.

2 And while, under this interpretation, these early "free exercise" enactments support
the Court's judgment in Smith, I see no sensible interpretation that could cause them to support what I understand tobe the position of

Justice O'Connor, or any of Smith's other
critics. No one in that camp, to my knowledge, contendsthat their favored "compelling state interest" test conforms

to any possible interpretation of "breach of peace andorder"--

i. e., that only violence or force, or any other category of action (more limited than "violation of law") whichcan possibly be conveyed by the phrase "peace and order,"

justifies state prohibition of religiously motivated conduct.

1 The word "licentious," used in several of the early enactments, likewise
meant "[e]xceeding the limits of law." 2 An American Dictionary of the
English Language 6 (1828).

2 The same explanation applies, of course, to George Mason's initial draft

of Virginia's religious liberty clause, see post, at 555. When it said "unless, under colour of religion, any man disturb the peace . . . of society," it
probably meant "unless under color of religion any man break the law."
Thus, it is not the case that "both Mason's and [James] Madison's formulations envisioned that, when there was a conflict [between religious exercise and generally applicable laws], a person's interest in freely practicing
his religion was to be balanced against state interests," post, at 556--at
least insofar as regulation of conduct was concerned.

Apart from the early "free exercise" enactments of Colo-nies, States, and Territories, the dissent calls attention to

those bodies', and the Continental Congress's, legislativeaccommodation of religious practices prior to ratification of
the Bill of Rights. Post, at 557-560. This accommoda-tion--which took place both before and after enactment of
the state constitutional protections of religious liberty--sug-gests (according to the dissent) that "the drafters and ratifiers of the First Amendment . . . assumed courts would applythe Free Exercise Clause similarly."

Post, at 560. But thatlegislatures sometimes (though not always)

3 found it "appropriate," post, at 559, to accommodate religious practices doesnot establish that accommodation was understood to be

constitutionally mandated by the Free Exercise Clause. Aswe explained in Smith, "to say that a nondiscriminatory
religious-practice exemption is permitted, or even that it isdesirable, is not to say that it is constitutionally required."
494 U. S., at 890. "Values that are protected against govern-ment interference through enshrinement in the Bill of Rights
are not thereby banished from the political process." Ibid.The dissent's final source of claimed historical support consists of statements of certain of the Framers in the contextof debates about proposed legislative enactments or debates
over general principles (not in connection with the draftingof State or Federal Constitutions). Those statements are
subject to the same objection as was the evidence about leg-islative accommodation: There is no reason to think they
were meant to describe what was constitutionally required(and judicially enforceable), as opposed to what was thought
to be legislatively or even morally desirable. Thus, forexample, the pamphlet written by James Madison opposing
Virginia's proposed general assessment for support of reli3 The dissent mentions, for example, that only 7 of the 13 Colonies had
exempted Quakers from military service by the mid-1700's; and that "virtually all" of the States had enacted oath exemptions by 1789. Post, at

gion, post, at 560-561, does not argue that the assessmentwould violate the "free exercise" provision in the Virginia

Declaration of Rights, although that provision had beenenacted into law only eight years earlier,

post, at 556; rather
the pamphlet argues that the assessment wrongly placed
civil society ahead of personal religious belief and, thus,should not be approved by the legislators,

post, at 560-561.
Likewise, the letter from George Washington to the Quak-ers,

post, at 562, by its own terms refers to Washington's
"wish and desire" that religion be accommodated, not his be-lief that existing constitutional provisions required accommodation. These and other examples offered by the dissent
reflect the speakers' views of the "proper" relationship
between government and religion, post, at 563, but not their
views (at least insofar as the content or context of the material suggests) of the constitutionally required relationship.
The one exception is the statement by Thomas Jefferson that
he considered "the government of the United States as interdicted by the Constitution from intermeddling with religious
institutions, their doctrines, discipline, or exercises," post, at
562 (internal quotation marks omitted); but it is quite clear
that Jefferson did not in fact espouse the broad principle of
affirmative accommodation advocated by the dissent, see McConnell, 103 Harv. L. Rev., at 1449-1452.

It seems to me that the most telling point made by the
dissent is to be found, not in what it says, but in what it fails
to say. Had the understanding in the period surrounding
the ratification of the Bill of Rights been that the various
forms of accommodation discussed by the dissent were constitutionally required (either by State Constitutions or by
the Federal Constitution), it would be surprising not to find
a single state or federal case refusing to enforce a generally
applicable statute because of its failure to make accommodation. Yet the dissent cites none--and to my knowledge, and
to the knowledge of the academic defenders of the dissent's
position, see, e. g., id., at 1504, 1506-1511 (discussing early

521US2 Unit: $U86 [11-20-99 14:39:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN

cases), none exists. The closest one can come in the periodprior to 1850 is the decision of a New York City municipal

court in 1813, holding that the New York Constitution of1777, quoted post, at 553, required acknowledgment of a
priest-penitent privilege, to protect a Catholic priest frombeing compelled to testify as to the contents of a confession.
People v. Phillips, Court of General Sessions, City of NewYork (June 14, 1813), excerpted in Privileged Communications to Clergymen, 1 Cath. Law. 199 (1955). Even this lonecase is weak authority, not only because it comes from a
minor court,4 but also because it did not involve a statute,and the same result might possibly have been achieved (without invoking constitutional entitlement) by the court's simplymodifying the common-law rules of evidence to recognize
such a privilege. On the other side of the ledger, moreover,there are two cases, from the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, flatly rejecting the dissent's view. In Simon's Execu-tors v. Gratz, 2 Pen. & W. 412 (Pa. 1831), the court held that
a litigant was not entitled to a continuance of trial on theground that appearing on his Sabbath would violate his religious principles. And in Stansbury v. Marks, 2 Dall. 213(Pa. 1793), decided just two years after the ratification of the
Bill of Rights, the court imposed a fine on a witness who"refused to be sworn, because it was his Sabbath."

I have limited this response to the new items of "historicalevidence" brought forward by today's dissent. (The dis4 The Court of General Sessions was a mayor's court, and the ruling in
Phillips was made by DeWitt Clinton, the last mayor to preside over that
court, which was subsequently reconstituted as the Court of Common
Pleas. Clinton had never been a jurist, and indeed had never practiced
law. Some years before Phillips, he was instrumental in removing the
political disabilities of Catholics in New York. See 4 Dictionary of American Biography 221-222, 224 (1943).

5 Indeed, the author of Simon's Executors could well have written

Smith: "[C]onsiderations of policy address themselves with propriety to
the legislature, and not to a magistrate whose course is prescribed not by
discretion, but rules already established." 2 Pen. & W., at 417.

sent's claim that "[b]efore Smith, our free exercise caseswere generally in keeping" with the dissent's view,

post, at
546, is adequately answered in Smith itself.) The historicalevidence marshalled by the dissent cannot fairly be said to

demonstrate the correctness of Smith; but it is more supportive of that conclusion than destructive of it. And, toreturn to a point I made earlier, that evidence is not compatible with any theory I am familiar with that has beenproposed as an alternative to

Smith. The dissent's approach
has, of course, great popular attraction. Who can possiblybe against the abstract proposition that government should

not, even in its general, nondiscriminatory laws, place un-reasonable burdens upon religious practice? Unfortunately,
however, that abstract proposition must ultimately be reduced to concrete cases. The issue presented by Smith is,
quite simply, whether the people, through their elected representatives, or rather this Court, shall control the outcome
of those concrete cases. For example, shall it be the determination of this Court, or rather of the people, whether (as the
dissent apparently believes, post, at 547) church construction will be exempt from zoning laws? The historical evidence put forward by the dissent does nothing to undermine
the conclusion we reached in Smith: It shall be the people.

I dissent from the Court's disposition of this case. I agree
with the Court that the issue before us is whether the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA) is a proper
exercise of Congress' power to enforce $ 5 of the Fourteenth

enact RFRA as a means of more rigorously enforcing the

wrongly decided, and I would use this case to reexamine the
Court's holding there. Therefore, I would direct the parties
to brief the question whether Smith represents the correct
understanding of the Free Exercise Clause and set the case
for reargument. If the Court were to correct the misinterpretation of the Free Exercise Clause set forth in Smith, it
would simultaneously put our First Amendment jurisprudence back on course and allay the legitimate concerns of a
majority in Congress who believed that Smith improperly
restricted religious liberty. We would then be in a position
to review RFRA in light of a proper interpretation of the
Free Exercise Clause.

I

I agree with much of the reasoning set forth in Part III-A
of the Court's opinion. Indeed, if I agreed with the Court's
standard in Smith, I would join the opinion. As the Court's
careful and thorough historical analysis shows, Congress
lacks the "power to decree the substance of the Fourteenth
Amendment's restrictions on the States." Ante, at 519 (emphasis added). Rather, its power under $ 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment extends only to enforcing the Amendment's provisions. In short, Congress lacks the ability
independently to define or expand the scope of constitutional
rights by statute. Accordingly, whether Congress has exceeded its $ 5 powers turns on whether there is a "congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented
or remedied and the means adopted to that end." Ante, at
520. This recognition does not, of course, in any way diminish Congress' obligation to draw its own conclusions regarding the Constitution's meaning. Congress, no less than this
Court, is called upon to consider the requirements of the
Constitution and to act in accordance with its dictates. But
when it enacts legislation in furtherance of its delegated
powers, Congress must make its judgments consistent with
this Court's exposition of the Constitution and with the lim521US2 Unit: $U86 [11-20-99 14:39:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN

its placed on its legislative authority by provisions such asthe Fourteenth Amendment.

The Court's analysis of whether RFRA is a constitutionalexercise of Congress' $ 5 power, set forth in Part III-B of its
opinion, is premised on the assumption that Smith correctly
interprets the Free Exercise Clause. This is an assumptionthat I do not accept. I continue to believe that

Smith
adopted an improper standard for deciding free exerciseclaims. In

Smith, five Members of this Court--without
briefing or argument on the issue--interpreted the Free Ex-ercise Clause to permit the government to prohibit, without

justification, conduct mandated by an individual's religious
beliefs, so long as the prohibition is generally applicable.
Contrary to the Court's holding in that case, however, the
Free Exercise Clause is not simply an antidiscrimination
principle that protects only against those laws that single
out religious practice for unfavorable treatment. See
Smith, supra, at 892-903 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment). Rather, the Clause is best understood as an affirmative guarantee of the right to participate in religious practices and conduct without impermissible governmental
interference, even when such conduct conflicts with a neutral, generally applicable law. Before Smith, our free exercise cases were generally in keeping with this idea: where a
law substantially burdened religiously motivated conduct--
regardless whether it was specifically targeted at religion or
applied generally--we required government to justify that
law with a compelling state interest and to use means narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. See 494 U. S., at 894

The Court's rejection of this principle in Smith is sup-ported neither by precedent nor, as discussed below, by history. The decision has harmed religious liberty. For exam-ple, a Federal District Court, in reliance on

Smith, ruled that
the Free Exercise Clause was not implicated where Hmong
natives objected on religious grounds to their son's autopsy,conducted pursuant to a generally applicable state law.

Yang v. Sturner, 750 F. Supp. 558, 559 (RI 1990). The Courtof Appeals for the Eighth Circuit held that application of a
city's zoning laws to prevent a church from conducting serv-ices in an area zoned for commercial uses raised no free exercise concerns, even though the city permitted secular notfor-profit organizations in that area. Cornerstone Bible
Church v. Hastings, 948 F. 2d 464 (1991); see also Rector of
St. Bartholomew's Church v. New York, 914 F. 2d 348, 355
(CA2 1990) (no free exercise claim where city's application
of facially neutral landmark designation law "drastically restricted the Church's ability to raise revenue to carry out its
various charitable and ministerial programs"), cert. denied,
499 U. S. 905 (1991); State v. Hershberger, 462 N. W. 2d 393
(Minn. 1990) (Free Exercise Clause provided no basis for exempting an Amish farmer from displaying a bright orange
triangle on his buggy, to which the farmer objected on religious grounds, even though the evidence showed that some
other material would have served the State's purpose
equally well). These cases demonstrate that lower courts
applying Smith no longer find necessary a searching judicial inquiry into the possibility of reasonably accommodating
religious practice.

Stare decisis concerns should not prevent us from revisiting our holding in Smith. " `[S]tare decisis is a principle
of policy and not a mechanical formula of adherence to the
latest decision, however recent and questionable, when such
adherence involves collision with a prior doctrine more embracing in its scope, intrinsically sounder, and verified by
experience.' " Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pen~ a, 515 U. S.

Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44, 63 (1996)(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). I believe
that, in light of both our precedent and our Nation's traditionof religious liberty,

Smith is demonstrably wrong. More-over, it is a recent decision. As such, it has not engendered

the kind of reliance on its continued application that wouldmilitate against overruling it. Cf. Planned Parenthood
of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833, 855-856 (1992).Accordingly, I believe that we should reexamine our holding in Smith, and do so in this very case. In its place, Iwould return to a rule that requires government to justify
any substantial burden on religiously motivated conduct bya compelling state interest and to impose that burden only
by means narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.

II
I shall not restate what has been said in other opinions,which have demonstrated that Smith is gravely at odds with

our earlier free exercise precedents. See Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U. S. 520, 570-571(1993) (

Souter, J., concurring in part and concurring in judg-ment) (stating that it is "difficult to escape the conclusion

here the early American tradition of religious free exerciseto gain insight into the original understanding of the Free
Exercise Clause--an inquiry the Court in Smith did not un-dertake. We have previously recognized the importance of
interpreting the Religion Clauses in light of their history.

interpretation of the Establishment Clause has comportedwith what history reveals was the contemporaneous understanding of its guarantees"); School Dist. of Abington Town-ship v. Schempp, 374 U. S. 203, 212-214 (1963).

The historical evidence casts doubt on the Court's currentinterpretation of the Free Exercise Clause. The record
instead reveals that its drafters and ratifiers more likelyviewed the Free Exercise Clause as a guarantee that government may not unnecessarily hinder believers from freelypracticing their religion, a position consistent with our preSmith jurisprudence. A

The original Constitution, drafted in 1787 and ratified bythe States in 1788, had no provisions safeguarding individual
liberties, such as freedom of speech or religion. Federalists,the chief supporters of the new Constitution, took the view
that amending the Constitution to explicitly protect individ-ual freedoms was superfluous, since the rights that the
amendments would protect were already completely secure.See, e. g., 1 Annals of Congress 440, 443-444, 448-459 (Gales
and Seaton ed. 1834) (remarks of James Madison, June 8,1789). Moreover, they feared that guaranteeing certain
civil liberties might backfire, since the express mention ofsome freedoms might imply that others were not protected.
According to Alexander Hamilton, a Bill of Rights wouldeven be dangerous, in that by specifying "various exceptions
to powers" not granted, it "would afford a colorable pretextto claim more than were granted." The Federalist No. 84,
p. 513 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961). Anti-Federalists, however, in-sisted on more definite guarantees. Apprehensive that the
newly established Federal Government would overwhelmthe rights of States and individuals, they wanted explicit
assurances that the Federal Government had no power inmatters of personal liberty. T. Curry, The First Freedoms:
Church and State in America to the Passage of the FirstAmendment 194 (1986). Additionally, Baptists and other
Protestant dissenters feared for their religious liberty under

O'Connor, J., dissenting
the new Federal Government and called for an amendmentguaranteeing religious freedom. Id., at 198.

In the end, legislators acceded to these demands. By De-cember 1791, the Bill of Rights had been added to the Constitution. With respect to religious liberty, the First Amend-ment provided: "Congress shall make no law respecting an
establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercisethereof." U. S. Const., Amdt. 1. Neither the First Congress nor the ratifying state legislatures debated the ques-tion of religious freedom in much detail, nor did they directly
consider the scope of the First Amendment's free exerciseprotection. It would be disingenuous to say that the Framers neglected to define precisely the scope of the Free Exer-cise Clause because the words "free exercise" had a precise
meaning. L. Levy, Essays on American Constitutional His-tory 173 (1972). As is the case for a number of the terms
used in the Bill of Rights, it is not exactly clear what theFramers thought the phrase signified. Ibid. ("[I]t is astonishing to discover that the debate on a Bill of Rights wasconducted on a level of abstraction so vague as to convey the
impression that Americans of 1787-1788 had only the mostnebulous conception of the meanings of the particular rights
they sought to insure"). But a variety of sources supple-ment the legislative history and shed light on the original
understanding of the Free Exercise Clause. These materi-als suggest that--contrary to

Smith--the Framers did notintend simply to prevent the government from adopting laws

that discriminated against religion. Although the Framersmay not have asked precisely the questions about religious
liberty that we do today, the historical record indicates thatthey believed that the Constitution affirmatively protects
religious free exercise and that it limits the government'sability to intrude on religious practice.

means new concepts in 1791, when the Bill of Rights wasratified. To the contrary, these principles were first articulated in this country in the Colonies of Maryland, RhodeIsland, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Carolina, in the mid1600's. These Colonies, though established as sanctuaries
for particular groups of religious dissenters, extended free-dom of religion to groups--although often limited to Christian groups--beyond their own. Thus, they encounteredearly on the conflicts that may arise in a society made up of
a plurality of faiths.The term "free exercise" appeared in an American legal
document as early as 1648, when Lord Baltimore extractedfrom the new Protestant Governor of Maryland and his
councilors a promise not to disturb Christians, particularly Roman Catholics, in the "free exercise" of their religion.McConnell, The Origins and Historical Understanding of

Free Exercise of Religion, 103 Harv. L. Rev. 1409, 1425 (1990)(hereinafter Origins of Free Exercise). Soon after, in 1649,
the Maryland Assembly enacted the first free exercise clauseby passing the Act Concerning Religion: "[N]oe person . . .
professing to beleive in Jesus Christ, shall from henceforthbee any waies troubled, Molested or discountenanced for or
in respect of his or her religion nor in the free exercise
thereof . . . nor any way [be] compelled to the beleife or
exercise of any other Religion against his or her consent, soe
as they be not unfaithfull to the Lord Proprietary, or molest
or conspire against the civill Governemt." Act Concerning
Religion of 1649, reprinted in 5 The Founders' Constitution
49, 50 (P. Kurland & R. Lerner eds. 1987) (hereinafter Founders' Constitution). Rhode Island's Charter of 1663 used the
analogous term "liberty of conscience." It protected residents from being in any ways "molested, punished, disquieted, or called in question, for any differences in opinione, in
matters of religion, and doe not actually disturb the civil
peace of our sayd colony." The Charter further provided
that residents may "freely, and fully have and enjoy his and
their own judgments, and conscience in matters of religious

concernments . . . ; they behaving themselves peaceably andquietly and not using this liberty to licentiousness and profaneness; nor to the civil injury, or outward disturbance ofothers." Charter of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, 1663, in 8 W. Swindler, Sources and Documents ofUnited States Constitutions 363 (1979) (hereinafter Swindler). Various agreements between prospective settlers andthe proprietors of Carolina, New York, and New Jersey similarly guaranteed religious freedom, using language that par-alleled that of the Rhode Island Charter of 1663. See New
York Act Declaring Rights & Priviledges (1691); Concessionand Agreement of the Lords Proprietors of the Province of
New Caesarea, or New-Jersey (1664); Laws of West New-Jersey, Art. X (1681); Fundamental Constitutions for East
New-Jersey, Art. XVI (1683); First Charter of Carolina,Art. XVIII (1663). N. Cogan, The Complete Bill of Rights
23-27 (Galley 1997).These documents suggest that, early in our country's
history, several Colonies acknowledged that freedom to pur-sue one's chosen religious beliefs was an essential liberty.
Moreover, these Colonies appeared to recognize that govern-ment should interfere in religious matters only when necessary to protect the civil peace or to prevent "licentiousness."In other words, when religious beliefs conflicted with civil
law, religion prevailed unless important state interests mili-tated otherwise. Such notions parallel the ideas expressed
in our pre-Smith cases--that government may not hinderbelievers from freely exercising their religion, unless necessary to further a significant state interest.

C
The principles expounded in these early charters re-emerged over a century later in state constitutions that were

adopted in the flurry of constitution drafting that followedthe American Revolution. By 1789, every State but Connecticut had incorporated some version of a free exercise

clause into its constitution. Origins of Free Exercise 1455.These state provisions, which were typically longer and

more detailed than the Federal Free Exercise Clause, areperhaps the best evidence of the original understanding of
the Constitution's protection of religious liberty. After all,it is reasonable to think that the States that ratified the First
Amendment assumed that the meaning of the federal freeexercise provision corresponded to that of their existing
state clauses. The precise language of these state precur-sors to the Free Exercise Clause varied, but most guaranteed free exercise of religion or liberty of conscience, limitedby particular, defined state interests. For example, the
New York Constitution of 1777 provided:

"[T]he free exercise and enjoyment of religious profes-sion and worship, without discrimination or preference,

shall forever hereafter be allowed, within this State, toall mankind:

Provided, That the liberty of conscience,hereby granted, shall not be so construed as to excuse

acts of licentiousness, or justify practices inconsistentwith the peace or safety of this State." N. Y. Const.,
Art. XXXVIII, in 7 Swindler 178 (emphasis added).
Similarly, the New Hampshire Constituti on of 1784declared:

"Every individual has a natural and unalienable rightto worship GOD according to the dictates of his own
conscience, and reason; and no subject shall be hurt, mo-lested, or restrained in his person, liberty or estate for
worshipping GOD, in the manner and season most agree-able to the dictates of his own conscience, . . . provided
he doth not disturb the public peace, or disturb others,in their religious worship." N. H. Const., Art. I, $ 5, in
6 Swindler 345 (emphasis added).
The Maryland Declaration of Rights of 1776 read:

"[N]o person ought by any law to be molested in hisperson or estate on account of his religious persuasion

or profession, or for his religious practice; unless, undercolour of religion, any man shall disturb the good order,

peace or safety of the State, or shall infringe the lawsof morality, or injure others, in their natural, civil, or
religious rights." Md. Const., Declaration of Rights,Art. XXXIII in 4 Swindler 374 (emphasis added).

The religious liberty clause of the Georgia Constitution of1777 stated:

"All persons whatever shall have the free exercise oftheir religion; provided

it be not repugnant to the peaceand safety of the State." Ga. Const., Art. LVI, in 2

Swindler 449 (emphasis added).
In addition to these state provisions, the Northwest Ordi-nance of 1787--which was enacted contemporaneously with

the drafting of the Constitution and reenacted by the FirstCongress--established a bill of rights for a territory that included what is now Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, andpart of Minnesota. Article I of the Ordinance declared:

"No person, demeaning himself in a peaceable and orderly manner, shall ever be molested on account of hismode of worship or religious sentiments, in the said territory." Northwest Territory Ordinance of 1787, Art. I,1 Stat. 52 (emphasis added).

The language used in these state constitutional provisionsand the Northwest Ordinance strongly suggests that, around
the time of the drafting of the Bill of Rights, it was generallyaccepted that the right to "free exercise" required, where
possible, accommodation of religious practice. If not--andif the Court was correct in

Smith that generally applicablelaws are enforceable regardless of religious conscience--

there would have been no need for these documents to spec-ify, as the New York Constitution did, that rights of conscience should not be "construed as to excuse acts of licen-tiousness, or justify practices inconsistent with the peace or
safety of [the] State." Such a proviso would have been su521US2 Unit: $U86 [11-20-99 14:39:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN

perfluous. Instead, these documents make sense only if theright to free exercise was viewed as generally superior to

ordinary legislation, to be overridden only when necessaryto secure important government purposes.

The Virginia Legislature may have debated the issue mostfully. In May 1776, the Virginia Constitutional Convention
wrote a constitution containing a Declaration of Rights witha clause on religious liberty. The initial drafter of the
clause, George Mason, proposed the following:

"That religion, or the duty which we owe to ourCREATOR, and the manner of discharging it, can be

(directed) only by reason and conviction, not by force orviolence; and therefore, that all men should enjoy the
fullest toleration in the exercise of religion, accordingto the dictates of conscience, unpunished and unrestrained by the magistrate, unless, under colour of religion, any man disturb the peace, the happiness, orsafety of society. And that it is the mutual duty of all

to practice Christian forbearance, love, and charity to-wards each other." Committee Draft of the Virginia
Declaration of Rights, 1 Papers of George Mason 284-285 (R. Rutland ed. 1970) (emphasis added).

Mason's proposal did not go far enough for a 26-year-oldJames Madison, who had recently completed his studies at
the Presbyterian College of Princeton. He objected first toMason's use of the term "toleration," contending that the
word implied that the right to practice one's religion was agovernmental favor, rather than an inalienable liberty. Second, Madison thought Mason's proposal countenanced toomuch state interference in religious matters, since the "exercise of religion" would have yielded whenever it was deemedinimical to "the peace, happiness, or safety of society."
Madison suggested the provision read instead:

" `That religion, or the duty we owe our Creator, andthe manner of discharging it, being under the direction

O'Connor, J., dissenting
of reason and conviction only, not of violence or compul-sion, all men are equally entitled to the full and free

exercise of it, according to the dictates of conscience;and therefore that no man or class of men ought on account of religion to be invested with peculiar emolu-ments or privileges, nor subjected to any penalties or
disabilities, unless under color of religion the preservation of equal liberty, and the existence of the State bemanifestly endangered.' " G. Hunt, James Madison and

Religious Liberty, in 1 Annual Report of the AmericanHistorical Association, H. R. Doc. No. 702, 57th Cong.,
1st Sess., 163, 166-167 (1901) (emphasis added).
Thus, Madison wished to shift Mason's language of "tolera-tion" to the language of rights. See S. Cobb, The Rise of

Religious Liberty in America 492 (1902) (reprint 1970) (not-ing that Madison objected to the word "toleration" as belonging to "a system where was an established Church, andwhere a certain liberty of worship was granted, not of right,
but of grace"). Additionally, under Madison's proposal, theState could interfere in a believer's religious exercise only if
the State would otherwise "be manifestly endangered." Inthe end, neither Mason's nor Madison's language regarding
the extent to which state interests could limit religious exer-cise made it into the Virginia Constitution's religious liberty
clause. Like the Federal Free Exercise Clause, the Virginiareligious liberty clause was simply silent on the subject, providing only that "all men are equally entitled to the free ex-ercise of religion, according to the dictates of conscience."
Virginia Declaration of Rights, Art. XVI (1776), in 10 Swin-dler 50. For our purposes, however, it is telling that

bothMason's and Madison's formulations envisioned that, when

there was a conflict, a person's interest in freely practic-ing his religion was to be balanced against state interests.
Although Madison endorsed a more limited state interestexception than did Mason, the debate would have been irrelevant if either had thought the right to free exercise did not

include a right to be exempt from certain generally appli-cable laws. Presumably, the Virginia Legislature intended

the scope of its free exercise provision to strike some middleground between Mason's narrower and Madison's broader
notions of the right to religious freedom.

D
The practice of the Colonies and early States bears outthe conclusion that, at the time the Bill of Rights was ratified, it was accepted that government should, when possible,accommodate religious practice. Unsurprisingly, of course,
even in the American Colonies inhabited by people of re-ligious persuasions, religious conscience and civil law rarely
conflicted. Most 17th and 18th century Americans be-longed to denominations of Protestant Christianity whose
religious practices were generally harmonious with coloniallaw. Curry, The First Freedoms, at 219 ("The vast majority of Americans assumed that theirs was a Christian, i. e.Protestant, country, and they automatically expected that
government would uphold the commonly agreed on Prot-estant ethos and morality"). Moreover, governments then
were far smaller and less intrusive than they are today,which made conflict between civil law and religion unusual.

Nevertheless, tension between religious conscience andgenerally applicable laws, though rare, was not unknown in
preconstitutional America. Most commonly, such conflictsarose from oath requirements, military conscription, and religious assessments. Origins of Free Exercise 1466. Theways in which these conflicts were resolved suggest that
Americans in the Colonies and early States thought that, ifan individual's religious scruples prevented him from complying with a generally applicable law, the governmentshould, if possible, excuse the person from the law's coverage. For example, Quakers and certain other Protestantsects refused on Biblical grounds to subscribe to oaths or
"swear" allegiance to civil authority. A. Adams & C. Em521US2 Unit: $U86 [11-20-99 14:39:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN

(hereinafter Adams & Emmerich). Without accommoda-tion, their beliefs would have prevented them from participating in civic activities involving oaths, including testify-ing in court. Colonial governments created alternatives
to the oath requirement for these individuals. In early de-cisions, for example, the Carolina proprietors applied the
religious liberty provision of the Carolina Charter of 1665to permit Quakers to enter pledges in a book. Curry, The
First Freedoms, at 56. Similarly, in 1691, New York en-acted a law allowing Quakers to testify by affirmation, and
in 1734, it permitted Quakers to qualify to vote by affirma-tion. Id., at 64. By 1789, virtually all of the States had
enacted oath exemptions. See Adams & Emmerich 62.Early conflicts between religious beliefs and generally applicable laws also occurred because of military conscriptionrequirements. Quakers and Mennonites, as well as a few
smaller denominations, refused on religious grounds to carryarms. Members of these denominations asserted that liberty of conscience should exempt them from military con-scription. Obviously, excusing such objectors from military
service had a high public cost, given the importance of themilitary to the defense of society. Nevertheless, Rhode Island, North Carolina, and Maryland exempted Quakers frommilitary service in the late 1600's. New York, Massachusetts, Virginia, and New Hampshire followed suit in themid-1700's. Origins of Free Exercise 1468. The Continental Congress likewise granted exemption from conscription:

"As there are some people, who, from religious prin-ciples, cannot bear arms in any case, this Congress intend no violence to their consciences, but earnestly rec-ommend it to them, to contribute liberally in this time
of universal calamity, to the relief of their distressedbrethren in the several colonies, and to do all other services to their oppressed Country, which they can consist521US2 Unit: $U86 [11-20-99 14:39:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ently with their religious principles." Resolution ofJuly 18, 1775, reprinted in 2 Journals of the Continental

Congress, 1774-1789, pp. 187, 189 (W. Ford ed. 1905).
Again, this practice of excusing religious pacifists from mili-tary service demonstrates that, long before the First Amendment was ratified, legislative accommodations were a com-mon response to conflicts between religious practice and civil
obligation. Notably, the Continental Congress exemptedobjectors from conscription to avoid "violence to their consciences," explicitly recognizing that civil laws must some-times give way to freedom of conscience. Origins of Free
Exercise 1468.States and Colonies with established churches encountered a further religious accommodation problem. Typi-cally, these governments required citizens to pay tithes to
support either the government-established church or thechurch to which the tithepayer belonged. But Baptists
and Quakers, as well as others, opposed all government-compelled tithes on religious grounds.

Id., at 1469. Mas-sachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire, and Virginia responded by exempting such objectors from religiousassessments. Ibid. There are additional examples of early
conflicts between civil laws and religious practice that weresimilarly settled through accommodation of religious exercise. Both North Carolina and Maryland excused Quakersfrom the requirement of removing their hats in court; Rhode
Island exempted Jews from the requirements of the statemarriage laws; and Georgia allowed groups of European immigrants to organize whole towns according to their ownfaith.

Id., at 1471.To be sure, legislatures, not courts, granted these early

accommodations. But these were the days before there wasa Constitution to protect civil liberties--judicial review did
not yet exist. These legislatures apparently believed thatthe appropriate response to conflicts between civil law and
religious scruples was, where possible, accommodation of re521US2 Unit: $U86 [11-20-99 14:39:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ligious conduct. It is reasonable to presume that the draft-ers and ratifiers of the First Amendment--many of whom

served in state legislatures--assumed courts would applythe Free Exercise Clause similarly, so that religious liberty
was safeguarded. E

The writings of the early leaders who helped to shape ourNation provide a final source of insight into the original understanding of the Free Exercise Clause. The thoughts ofJames Madison--one of the principal architects of the Bill of
Rights--as revealed by the controversy surrounding Virgin-ia's General Assessment Bill of 1784, are particularly illuminating. Virginia's debate over religious issues did not endwith its adoption of a constitutional free exercise provision.
Although Virginia had disestablished the Church of Englandin 1776, it left open the question whether religion might be
supported on a nonpreferential basis by a so-called "generalassessment." Levy, Essays on American Constitutional
History, at 200. In the years between 1776 and 1784, theissue how to support religion in Virginia--either by general
assessment or voluntarily--was widely debated. Curry,The First Freedoms, at 136.

By 1784, supporters of a general assessment, led by Pat-rick Henry, had gained a slight majority in the Virginia Assembly. M. Malbin, Religion and Politics: The Intentions ofthe Authors of the First Amendment 23 (1978); Levy,

supra,at 200. They introduced "A Bill Establishing a Provision

for the Teachers of the Christian Religion," which proposedthat citizens be taxed in order to support the Christian denomination of their choice, with those taxes not designatedfor any specific denomination to go to a public fund to aid
seminaries. Levy, supra, at 200-201; Curry, supra, at 140-141; Malbin,

supra, at 23. Madison viewed religious assess-ment as a dangerous infringement of religious liberty and led

the opposition to the bill. He took the case against religiousassessment to the people of Virginia in his now-famous "Me521US2 Unit: $U86 [11-20-99 14:39:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN

561Cite as: 521 U. S. 507 (1997)
O'Connor, J., dissenting
morial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments."
Levy, supra, at 201. This pamphlet led thousands of Virginians to oppose the bill and to submit petitions expressing
their views to the legislature. Malbin, supra, at 24. The
bill eventually died in committee, and Virginia instead
enacted a Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom, which
Thomas Jefferson had drafted in 1779. Malbin, supra, at 24.

The "Memorial and Remonstrance" begins with the recognition that "[t]he Religion . . . of every man must be left to
the conviction and conscience of every man; and it is the right
of every man to exercise it as these may dictate." 2 Writings of James Madison 184 (G. Hunt ed. 1901). By its very
nature, Madison wrote, the right to free exercise is "unalienable," both because a person's opinion "cannot follow the dictates of other[s]," and because it entails "a duty towards the
Creator." Ibid. Madison continued:

"This duty [owed the Creator] is precedent both in order
of time and degree of obligation, to the claims of Civil
Society. . . . [E]very man who becomes a member of any
particular Civil Society, [must] do it with a saving of
his allegiance to the Universal Sovereign. We maintain
therefore that in matters of Religion, no man's right is
abridged by the institution of Civil Society, and that Religion is wholly exempt from its cognizance." Id., at
184-185.

To Madison, then, duties to God were superior to duties to
civil authorities--the ultimate loyalty was owed to God
above all. Madison did not say that duties to the Creator
are precedent only to those laws specifically directed at religion, nor did he strive simply to prevent deliberate acts of
persecution or discrimination. The idea that civil obligations are subordinate to religious duty is consonant with the
notion that government must accommodate, where possible,
those religious practices that conflict with civil law.

O'Connor, J., dissenting
Other early leaders expressed similar views regarding religious liberty. Thomas Jefferson, the drafter of Virginia's
Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom, wrote in that document that civil government could interfere in religious exercise only "when principles break out into overt acts against
peace and good order." In 1808, he indicated that he considered " `the government of the United States as interdicted
by the Constitution from intermeddling with religious institutions, their doctrines, discipline, or exercises.' " 11 The
Writings of Thomas Jefferson 428-429 (A. Lipscomb ed.
1904) (quoted in Office of Legal Policy, U. S. Dept. of Justice,
Report to the Attorney General, Religious Liberty under the
Free Exercise Clause 7 (1986)). Moreover, Jefferson believed that " `[e]very religious society has a right to determine for itself the time of these exercises, and the objects
proper for them, according to their own particular tenets;
and this right can never be safer than in their own hands,
where the Constitution has deposited it.' " Ibid.

George Washington expressly stated that he believed that
government should do its utmost to accommodate religious
scruples, writing in a letter to a group of Quakers:

"[I]n my opinion the conscientious scruples of all men
should be treated with great delicacy and tenderness;
and it is my wish and desire, that the laws may always
be as extensively accommodated to them, as a due regard to the protection and essential interests of the nation may justify and permit." Letter from George
Washington to the Religious Society Called Quakers
(Oct. 1789), in George Washington on Religious Liberty
and Mutual Understanding 11 (E. Humphrey ed. 1932).

Oliver Ellsworth, a Framer of the First Amendment and
later Chief Justice of the United States, expressed the similar view that government could interfere in religious matters
only when necessary "to prohibit and punish gross immorali521US2 Unit: $U86 [11-20-99 14:39:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN

O'Connor, J., dissenting
ties and impieties; because the open practice of these is of
evil example and detriment." Oliver Ellsworth, Landholder, No. 7 (Dec. 17, 1787), reprinted in 4 Founders' Constitution 640. Isaac Backus, a Baptist minister who was a delegate to the Massachusetts ratifying convention of 1788,
declared that " `every person has an unalienable right to act
in all religious affairs according to the full persuasion of his
own mind, where others are not injured thereby.' " Backus,
A Declaration of Rights, of the Inhabitants of the State of
Massachusetts-Bay, in Isaac Backus on Church, State, and
Calvinism 487 (W. McLoughlin ed. 1968).

These are but a few examples of various perspectives regarding the proper relationship between church and government that existed during the time the First Amendment was
drafted and ratified. Obviously, since these thinkers approached the issue of religious freedom somewhat differently, see Adams & Emmerich 21-31, it is not possible to
distill their thoughts into one tidy formula. Nevertheless, a
few general principles may be discerned. Foremost, these
early leaders accorded religious exercise a special constitutional status. The right to free exercise was a substantive
guarantee of individual liberty, no less important than the
right to free speech or the right to just compensation for the
taking of property. See P. Kauper, Religion and the Constitution 17 (1964) ("[O]ur whole constitutional history . . . supports the conclusion that religious liberty is an independent
liberty, that its recognition may either require or permit
preferential treatment on religious grounds in some instances . . . "). As Madison put it in the concluding argument of his "Memorial and Remonstrance":

" `[T]he equal right of every citizen to the free exercise
of his Religion according to the dictates of [his] conscience' is held by the same tenure with all our other
rights. . . . [I]t is equally the gift of nature; . . . it cannot
be less dear to us; . . . it is enumerated with equal solem521US2 Unit: $U86 [11-20-99 14:39:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN

nity, or rather studied emphasis." 2 Writings of JamesMadison, at 190.

Second, all agreed that government interference in reli-gious practice was not to be lightly countenanced. Adams &
Emmerich 31. Finally, all shared the conviction that " `truereligion and good morals are the only solid foundation of public liberty and happiness.' " Curry, The First Freedoms, at219 (quoting Continental Congress); see Adams & Emmerich
72 ("The Founders . . . acknowledged that the republic restedlargely on moral principles derived from religion"). To give
meaning to these ideas--particularly in a society characterized by religious pluralism and pervasive regulation--therewill be times when the Constitution requires government to

accommodate the needs of those citizens whose religiouspractices conflict with generally applicable law.

III
The Religion Clauses of the Constitution represent a pro-found commitment to religious liberty. Our Nation's Founders conceived of a Republic receptive to voluntary religiousexpression, not of a secular society in which religious expression is tolerated only when it does not conflict with a gener-ally applicable law. As the historical sources discussed
above show, the Free Exercise Clause is properly understoodas an affirmative guarantee of the right to participate in religious activities without impermissible governmental interference, even where a believer's conduct is in tension with alaw of general application. Certainly, it is in no way anomalous to accord heightened protection to a right identified inthe text of the First Amendment. For example, it has long
been the Court's position that freedom of speech--a rightenumerated only a few words after the right to free exercise--has special constitutional status. Given the centrality
of freedom of speech and religion to the American concept
of personal liberty, it is altogether reasonable to conclude

that both should be treated with the highest degree ofrespect.

Although it may provide a bright line, the rule the Courtdeclared in

Smith does not faithfully serve the purpose of
the Constitution. Accordingly, I believe that it is essential
for the Court to reconsider its holding in Smith--and to doso in this very case. I would therefore direct the parties to

brief this issue and set the case for reargument.I respectfully dissent from the Court's disposition of this
case.

Justice Souter, dissenting.
To decide whether the Fourteenth Amendment gives Congress sufficient power to enact the Religious Freedom Resto-ration Act of 1993, the Court measures the legislation against

the free-exercise standard of Employment Div., Dept. of
Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U. S. 872 (1990).
For the reasons stated in my opinion in Church of Lukumi
Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U. S. 520, 564-577 (1993)
(opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment), I
have serious doubts about the precedential value of the
Smith rule and its entitlement to adherence. These doubts
are intensified today by the historical arguments going to
the original understanding of the Free Exercise Clause presented in Justice O'Connor's dissent, ante, at 548-564,
which raises very substantial issues about the soundness of the
Smith rule. See also ante, p. 537 (Justice Scalia, concurring in part) (addressing historical arguments). But without
briefing and argument on the merits of that rule (which this
Court has never had in any case, including Smith itself, see
Lukumi, 508 U. S., at 571-572), I am not now prepared to
join Justice O'Connor in rejecting it or the majority in
assuming it to be correct. In order to provide full adversarial consideration, this case should be set down for reargument permitting plenary reexamination of the issue. Since
the Court declines to follow that course, our free-exercise

law remains marked by an "intolerable tension," id., at 574,and the constitutionality of the Act of Congress to enforce

the free-exercise right cannot now be soundly decided. Iwould therefore dismiss the writ of certiorari as improvidently granted, and I accordingly dissent from the Court'sdisposition of this case.

Justice Breyer, dissenting.
I agree with Justice O'Connor that the Court shoulddirect the parties to brief the question whether

EmploymentDiv., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U. S.

872 (1990), was correctly decided, and set this case for re-argument. I do not, however, find it necessary to consider
the question whether, assuming Smith is correct, $ 5 of theFourteenth Amendment would authorize Congress to enact
the legislation before us. Thus, while I agree with someof the views expressed in the first paragraph of Part I of
Justice O'Connor's dissent, I do not necessarily agree withall of them. I therefore join

Justice O'Connor's dissent,with the exception of the first paragraph of Part I.

LAWYER v. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE et al.
appeal from the united states district court for themiddle district of florida

No. 95-2024. Argued February 19, 1997--Decided June 25, 1997
Based on the 1990 census, the Florida Legislature adopted a reapportionment plan for State Senate and House districts. When the Justice Department refused to preclear the plan, the State Supreme Court entered
an order encouraging the state legislature to adopt a new plan. Advised that the Governor would not convene an extraordinary session
and that neither the Senate President nor the House Speaker would
convene his respective House, the court concluded that legislative impasse had occurred and revised the redistricting plan itself producing
Plan 330. In 1995, appellant and other residents of Senate District 21
as revised in Plan 330 filed suit against state and federal parties in
the Federal District Court, alleging that District 21 violated the Equal
Protection Clause. The three-judge court permitted intervention by
the State Senate, the House of Representatives, and others. Ultimately, all the parties but appellant agreed to a settlement that would
revise District 21 under a new plan, Plan 386. At a hearing, the District Court rejected appellant's objections that the court was obliged to
find Plan 330 unconstitutional before approving the settlement, and that
Plan 386 was unconstitutional under Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S. 900,
because only race could explain District 21's contours. The court approved the settlement.

Held:

1. The District Court did not err in approving the settlement agreement without formally holding Plan 330 unconstitutional. Pp. 575-580.

(a) State redistricting responsibility should be accorded primacy to
the extent possible when a federal court exercises remedial power.
Growe v. Emison, 507 U. S. 25, 34. A State should be given the opportunity to make its own redistricting decision so long as that is practically
possible and the State chooses to take the opportunity. Ibid.; Wise v.
Lipscomb, 437 U. S. 535, 540. The District Court's decision did not
deny the State's legislature and Supreme Court the opportunity to devise a new redistricting plan here, for the State has selected its opportunity by entering into the settlement agreement. There is no reason to
suppose that the State's attorney general lacked authority to propose a
plan as an incident of his authority to represent the State in the litigation, and the participation of counsel for each legislative chamber con521US2 Unit: $U87 [11-20-99 14:47:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Syllabus
firms this authority as well as the legislature's continuing refusal to
address the issue in formal session. The State has taken advantage of
the opportunity recognized in Growe and Wise. Pp. 575-578.

(b) The District Court was not bound to adjudicate liability before
settlement even though appellant refused to settle. The settlement
agreement did not impermissibly impose duties or obligations on appellant or dispose of his claims. See Firefighters v. Cleveland, 478 U. S.
501, 529. It disposed of his claim not in the forbidden sense of cutting
him off from a remedy to which he was entitled, but only in the legitimate sense of granting him an element of the very relief he had sought:
the elimination of the plan he claimed was unconstitutional. Insofar as
appellant also wanted the new plan to be constitutional, he is in the
same position he would have been with a formal decree: his views on
Plan 386's merits were heard, and his right to attack it in this appeal is
unimpaired. He may not demand the adjudication that the State could
have demanded but instead waived. Pp. 578-580.

2. The District Court's finding that Plan 386 did not subordinate traditional districting principles to race is not clearly erroneous. See
Miller v. Johnson, supra, at 915-917. Appellant's contrary claim is
based on his charges that District 21 encompasses more than one county,
crosses a body of water, is irregular in shape, lacks compactness, and
contains a percentage of black voters significantly higher than the overall percentage in the counties from which the district is drawn. His
first four points ignore unrefuted evidence showing that District 21 is
no different from what Florida's traditional districting principles could
have been expected to produce. As to the final point, this Court has
never suggested that the percentage of black residents in a district may
not exceed the percentage of black residents in any of the counties from
which a district is created, and has never required similar racial composition of different political districts to avoid an inference of racial gerrymandering in any one of them. Pp. 580-582.

Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.
Appellant was one of several plaintiffs in this suit chal-lenging the configuration of a Florida legislative district

under the Equal Protection Clause. All parties except ap-pellant reached a provisional settlement agreement and,
after a fairness hearing, a three-judge District Court ap-proved the remedial districting plan proposed in the agreement. Appellant claims that the District Court acted with-out giving the State an adequate opportunity to make its
own redistricting choice by approving the remedial planwithout first adjudicating the legality of the original plan,
that the court had no authority to approve any settlementover his objection, and that the remedial plan violates the
Constitution. We hold that the State exercised the choiceto which it was entitled under our cases, that appellant has
no right to block the settlement, and that he has failed topoint up any unconstitutionality in the plan proposed.

reapportionment set forth in the State Constitution, see Fla.Const., Art. III, $ 16(c) (1970), the attorney general of Florida petitioned the State Supreme Court for a declaration thatthe plan comported with state and federal law. That court
approved the redistricting plan, while noting that time constraints imposed by the State Constitution precluded a fullreview of objections raised to the plan under $ 2 of the Voting

Rights Act of 1965, 79 Stat. 437, as amended, 42 U. S. C.$ 1973. The court retained jurisdiction to entertain further
objections to the plan. See In re Constitutionality of
Senate Joint Resolution 2G, 597 So. 2d 276, 285-286 (Fla.),
amended, 601 So. 2d 543 (Fla. 1992); Johnson v. De Grandy,

where the city of Tampa is located, are covered jurisdictions
under $ 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 79 Stat. 439, as
amended, 42 U. S. C. $ 1973c, see 28 CFR pt. 51, App. (1996);
see also Johnson, supra, at 1001, n. 2, the state attorney
general submitted the redistricting plan to the United States
Department of Justice for preclearance. On June 16, 1992,
the Department declined to preclear the proposed State Senate districts, on the grounds that the redistricting plan divided "politically cohesive minority populations" in the Hillsborough County area and failed to create a majority-minority
district in that region. Letter from Assistant United States
Attorney General John Dunne to Florida Attorney General
Robert A. Butterworth (quoted in In re Constitutionality of

601 So. 2d, at 544-545. The state court was advised thatthe Governor had no intent to convene the legislature in extraordinary session and that neither the President of theSenate nor the Speaker of the House of Representatives
would convene his respective House. Ibid.; see also 815F. Supp., at 1556. The court concluded that a legislative impasse had occurred and, invoking authority under state law,revised the Senate redistricting plan to address the Justice
Department's objection. 601 So. 2d, at 545.The amended plan, known as Plan 330, called for an irregularly shaped Senate District 21, with a voting-age population45.8% black and 9.4% Hispanic and comprising portions of
four counties in the Tampa Bay area. Id., at 546. The dis-trict included the central portions of Tampa in Hillsborough
County, the eastern shore of Tampa Bay running south toBradenton in Manatee County, central portions of St. Petersburg in Pinellas County, a narrow projection eastwardthrough parts of Hillsborough and Polk Counties, and a narrow finger running north from St. Petersburg to Clearwater.See Juris. Statement 29a. Although the State Supreme
Court acknowledged that the district was "more contorted"than other possible plans and that black residents in different
parts of the district might have little in common besides theirrace, it decided that such concerns "must give way to racial
and ethnic fairness." See 601 So. 2d, at 546. Electionswere held under Plan 330 in 1992 and 1994.

by the State Senate, House of Representatives, Secretary ofState, District 21 Senator James T. Hargrett, Jr., and a group
of black and Hispanic voters residing in District 21. Record33, 78; 159 Tr. 25, 30 (Sept. 27, 1995).

At a status conference held on July 6, 1995, shortly afterwe decided

Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S. 900 (1995), all partiesagreed to the appointment of a mediator to seek resolution

of the suit,2 see Record 78, at 2; 134 Tr. 13, 14, 16 (July 6,1995), though pretrial proceedings continued during the ensuing mediation. After the mediator declared an impasse inlate October, see 166 Tr. 8 (Oct. 26, 1995), the parties continued discussions on their own and on November 2, 1995, filedwith the District Court a settlement agreement signed on
behalf of all parties except appellant. App. 17-21. Theagreement noted that while the defendants and defendantintervenors denied the plaintiffs' claims that District 21 wasunconstitutional, all parties to the settlement concurred that
"there is a reasonable factual and legal basis for the plain-tiffs' claim."

Id., at 17. The agreement proposed revisingDistrict 21 under a new plan, called Plan 386, which would

be subject to public comment and, if approved by the DistrictCourt after a public hearing, would be used in state elections
unless Florida adopted a new plan. Id., at 18-19. District

2 At the time, the District Court had permitted the Florida Senate to
intervene, see Record 33, but had yet to rule on motions to intervene from
Senator Hargrett and from the group of minority voters in District 21.
The District Court indicated that it intended to grant all pending motions
to intervene, and treated prospective intervenors as parties. 134 Tr. 4
(July 6, 1995). The House of Representatives had yet to file a motion to
intervene, but was represented at the status conference and indicated its
intention to file a motion to intervene. Id., at 24. No one at the status

21, as revised in Plan 386, would no longer extend into PolkCounty or north toward Clearwater, would have a boundary

Id., at

counties instead of four and continue to include land on bothsides of Tampa Bay. Record 169, attachment 4.

At a status conference held the same day the parties filedthe settlement agreement, the District Court sought and received specific assurances from lawyers for the President ofthe Senate and the Speaker of the House that they were
authorized to represent their respective government bodies
in the litigation and enter into the settlement proposed. 180
Tr. 23-24 (Nov. 2, 1995). Appellant argued that the District
Court was required to hold Plan 330 unconstitutional before
it could adopt a new districting plan, see id., at 16, but the
District Court disagreed, noting that "there is simply not a
litigable issue with respect to what we have for shorthand
purposes referred to as liability and we ought simply then to
proceed . . . to resolve the issue of the fairness of this proposed settlement and entertain any objections [concerning
it]." Id., at 26.

The District Court scheduled a hearing on the proposed
plan for November 20, giving notice in 13 area newspapers
and making details of the plan available for review in the
clerk's office. See App. 161. Before the hearing, the
settling parties submitted evidence including affidavits and
declarations addressing the factors considered in revising
District 21, Record 188, and appellant submitted his own
remedial plan for a District 21 wholly contained within Hillsborough County, Record 172, at A4. At the hearing, counsel
for the State Senate summarized the prehearing filings submitted by proponents of the settlement and the rationale behind the agreement. App. 160-172. The District Court denied appellant's motion for ruling on his motion for summary

we are in now." Id., at 173. Appellant then argued thatDistrict 21, as redrawn in Plan 386, would still be unconstitutional because only race could explain its contours, see id.,
at 175-188, and counsel for a former state legislator spoke tothe same effect,

id., at 188-190.
On March 19, 1996, the District Court approved the settle-ment. See 920 F. Supp. 1248, 1257 (MD Fla. 1996). The

panel majority first held that it was not obliged to find theexisting District 21 unconstitutional in order to approve the
settlement. While recognizing the need to "guard against
any disingenuous adventures" by litigants, id., at 1252, n. 2,
the majority noted that a State should not be deprived of
the opportunity to avoid "an expensive and protracted contest and the possibility of an adverse and disruptive adjudication" by a rule insisting on "a public mea culpa" as the
sole condition for dispensing with "a dispositive, specific determination of the controlling constitutional issue." Id., at
1252, and n. 2. To balance the competing interests, the
court required a showing of a substantial "evidentiary and
legal" basis for the plaintiffs' claim before the settlement
would be approved, id., at 1252, and it held the standard
satisfied. "Each party either states unequivocally that existing District 21 is unconstitutionally configured or concedes, for purposes of settlement, that the plaintiffs have established prima facie unconstitutionality." Id., at 1253, n. 3.
The majority found that the "boundaries of current District
21 are markedly uneven and, in some respects, extraordinary," id., at 1253, and that the district "bears at least some
of the conspicuous signs of a racially conscious contrivance,"
id., at 1255.

The District Court then turned to the merits of Plan 386
to determine whether its formation had been "dominated by
the single-minded focus" on race that it understood to be
constitutionally forbidden under Miller. 920 F. Supp., at

Opinion of the Court
1254. The court observed that the November 20 hearing"produced but two dissenters, plaintiff Lawyer and a former

state Senator, both of whom neither presented relevant evi-dence nor offered germane legal argument."

Id., at 1255.
The District Court concluded that a "constitutional objection
to the proposed District 21 is not established. In its shapeand composition, proposed District 21 is, all said and done,

demonstrably benign and satisfactorily tidy, especially giventhe prevailing geography."

Ibid. The court noted that the
new district's percentage of minority residents would ap-proximate the racial features of the region surrounding

Tampa Bay better than Plan 330 did, that the district'sboundaries would be "less strained and irregular" than those
in Plan 330, and that all candidates, regardless of race, would
have an opportunity to seek office, with "both a fair chanceto win and the usual risk of defeat."

Id., at 1255, 1256.
Chief Judge Tjoflat concurred specially. He agreed thatPlan 386 was constitutional but thought that the new plan

could not be approved without a judicial determination that
Plan 330 was unconstitutional, as he concluded it was. Id.,
at 1256-1257.

We noted probable jurisdiction, 519 U. S. 926 (1996), and

A

Appellant argues that the District Court erred in approving the settlement agreement without formally holding Plan
330 unconstitutional, thereby denying the State's legislature
and Supreme Court the opportunity to devise a new redistricting plan.3 See Brief for Appellant 23, 32-33. Appel3 We reject appellees' contention that appellant failed to preserve this
claim for appeal. Appellant argued below that the District Court should
rule on the legality of Plan 330 before approving a remedial plan, see, e. g.,
Record 173, and appellant's statements asking that the state legislature
and Supreme Court be given the opportunity to redistrict following a find521US2 Unit: $U87 [11-20-99 14:47:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
lant relies on Growe v. Emison, 507 U. S. 25 (1993), in which
we recognized that " `reapportionment is primarily the duty
and responsibility of the State through its legislature or
other body, rather than of a federal court' [and that] [a]bsent
evidence that these state branches will fail timely to perform
that duty, a federal court must neither affirmatively obstruct
state apportionment nor permit federal litigation to be used
to impede it." Id., at 34 (quoting Chapman v. Meier, 420
U. S. 1, 27 (1975)). Appellant cites Wise v. Lipscomb, 437
U. S. 535 (1978), for the proposition that when a federal court
declares an existing apportionment plan unconstitutional, it
should, if possible, afford "a reasonable opportunity for the
legislature to meet constitutional requirements by adopting
a substitute measure rather than . . . devise and order into
effect its own plan." Id., at 540 (opinion of White, J.). Appellant claims that the District Court's approval of the settlement agreement without first holding Plan 330 unconstitutional impaired the State's interest in exercising "primary
responsibility for apportionment of [its] federal congressional
and state legislative districts," Growe, supra, at 34, and had
the derivative effect of "eviscerat[ing] the individual rights
of " appellant, as a citizen and voter, to "the liberties derived
from the diffusion of sovereign power . . . to representative
state government," Brief for Appellant 26.

The substance of what appellant claims as a right to the
benefit of political diffusion is nothing other than the rule
declared in the cases he cites, that state redistricting responsibility should be accorded primacy to the extent possible
when a federal court exercises remedial power. See Growe,
507 U. S., at 34. A State should be given the opportunity to
make its own redistricting decisions so long as that is practically possible and the State chooses to take the opportunity.

Opinion of the Court
Ibid. When it does take the opportunity, the discretion ofthe federal court is limited except to the extent that the plan

itself runs afoul of federal law.In this case, the State has selected its opportunity by entering into the settlement agreement, which for reasons setout below in Part II-B it had every right to do. And it
has availed itself of that opportunity by proposing a planas embodied in the settlement agreement. There can be no
question on the present record that proponents of the planincluded counsel authorized to represent the State itself, and
there is no reason to suppose that the State's attorney gen-eral lacked authority to propose a plan as an incident of his
authority to represent the State in this litigation.4 The evi-dence, indeed, was entirely in his favor. The participation
of counsel for each legislative chamber confirmed both thecontinuing refusal of the legislature to address the issue in

4 The dissent argues that Article III, $ 16, of the Florida Constitution
provides the exclusive means by which redistricting can take place. See
post, at 585-586, and n. 2. But this article in terms provides only that
the state legislature is bound to redistrict within a certain time after each
decennial census, for which it may be required to convene. See Fla.
Const., Art. III, $ 16(a). The dissent says that the state legislature is
"implicitly authorized to reapportion" after an existing plan is held unconstitutional and, further, that the Supreme Court of Florida has "by implication" the authority to redraw districts in the event a federal court invalidates a redistricting plan on constitutional grounds. See post, at 585-586,
n. 2. We disagree on this question of state law only insofar as the dissent
views this implicit authority to limit the broad discretion possessed by the
attorney general of Florida in representing the State in litigation. See,
e. g., Ervin v. Collins, 85 So. 2d 852, 854 (Fla. 1956) (noting that, under
Florida law, "the Attorney General as the chief law officer of the state and
absent express legislative restriction to the contrary, may exercise his
power and authority in the premises [the power to litigate] as the public
interest may require"); see also State ex rel. Shevin v. Yarborough, 257
So. 2d 891, 894-896 (Fla. 1972) (Ervin, J., specially concurring). Absent a
state-court determination to the contrary, we do not see Article III, $ 16,
as placing the attorney general's settling authority in doubt, over against
his representation to the contrary.

formal session and the authority of the attorney general topropose the settlement plan on the State's behalf.

5

On these facts, the District Court's approval of the settle-ment agreement was entirely consistent with the principles

underlying our cases that have granted relief on the groundthat a district court had failed to respect the affected government's entitlement to originate its own redistricting policy.Since the State, through its attorney general, has taken advantage of the option recognized in Growe and Wise to makeredistricting decisions in the first instance, there are no reasons in those cases to burden its exercise of choice by requir-ing a formal adjudication of unconstitutionality.

B
We find no merit, either, in appellant's apparently distinctclaim that, regardless of any effect on the State's districting

responsibility, the District Court was bound to adjudicateliability before settlement because appellant did not agree
to settle. See Brief for Appellant 27. "It has never beensupposed that one party--whether an original party, a party

5 The District Court indicated that it would look to the Florida House
and Senate as an initial matter to fashion any new districting plan, see Tr.
14, 18-19, 21-22 (Sept. 27, 1995), and directed the state appellees to file a
monthly "report informing the Court of any formal actions initiated by
any public official or branch of government regarding Florida's senatorial
`reapportionment plan.' " Record 78, at 5. The Florida Senate filed such
status reports as directed, indicating that apart from the ongoing litigation, no formal actions had been initiated by any public official or branch
of state government regarding Florida's senatorial plan. Record 121,
141, 160.

The dissent challenges the authority of those representing the State
House and Senate to speak for those bodies and further claims that even if
they were authorized, the District Court was required to "demand clearer
credentials" on their part. See post, at 586. However this may be, the
State was represented by the attorney general and it is by virtue of his
agreement as counsel that the State was a party to the agreement. The
settlement and subsequent judgment do not, of course, prevent the state
legislature from redistricting yet again. See App. 19.

Firefighters v.
Cleveland, 478 U. S. 501, 528-529 (1986).6 While appellantwas entitled to present evidence and have his objections

heard at the hearing to consider approval of the agreement,he "does not have power to block the decree merely by withholding [his] consent." Id., at 529; cf. 7B C. Wright, A.
Miller, & M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure $ 1797.1,p. 412 (2d ed. 1986) (fact of opposition does not necessitate

disapproval of class-action settlement under Federal Rule ofCivil Procedure 23). While a settlement agreement subject
to court approval in a nonclass action may not impose dutiesor obligations on an unconsenting party or "dispose" of his
claims, see Firefighters, supra, at 529, the agreement here
did none of those things. It disposed of appellant's claim notin the forbidden sense of cutting him off from a remedy to

which he was entitled, but only in the legitimate sense of
granting him an element of the very relief he had sought.
As a remedy for what appellant claimed to be an unconstitutional plan he had requested the elimination of that plan, and
the settlement and decree gave him that relief. To afford
him a right to the formality of a decree in addition to the
substance of the relief sought would be to allow a sore winner to obscure the point of the suit. In most civil litigation,
and in this suit in particular, "the judicial decree is not the
end but the means. At the end of the rainbow lies not a
judgment, but some action (or cessation of action) by the
defendant that the judgment produces . . . . The real value
of the judicial pronouncement--what makes it a proper judi6 Notwithstanding the dissent's claim, see post, at 584, nothing in Firefighters limits its rule to remedial consent decrees that follow an adjudication of liability. To the contrary, the holding in Firefighters was expressly
based on the principle that "it is the parties' agreement that serves as the
source of the court's authority to enter any [consent] judgment at all," 478
U. S., at 522, and our opinion in that case makes no reference to any findings of liability.

cial resolution of a `case or controversy' rather than an advisory opinion--is in the settling of some dispute which affects
the behavior of the defendant towards the plaintiff." Hewitt v. Helms, 482 U. S. 755, 761 (1987).

Appellant, of course, wanted something more than being
rid of Plan 330, for he wanted a new plan that would be
constitutional. But insofar as he would have been entitled
to that following a formal decree of the court, he is now in
the same position he would have enjoyed if he had had such
a decree: his views on the merits of the proposed plan were
heard, and his right to attack it in this appeal is entirely
unimpaired. To the extent that he claims anything more, he
is trying to do what we have previously said he may not do:
to demand an adjudication that the State of Florida, represented by the attorney general, could indeed have demanded,
see Growe, 507 U. S., at 34; Wise, 437 U. S., at 540 (opinion
of White, J.), but instead waived.

III
The District Court concluded that Plan 386 did not subordinate traditional districting principles to race.7 See 920
F. Supp., at 1254-1255. That finding is subject to review for
clear error, see Miller, 515 U. S., at 915-917, of which we
find none.

The District Court looked to the shape and composition of
District 21 as redrawn in Plan 386 and found them "demonstrably benign and satisfactorily tidy." 920 F. Supp., at
1255. The district is located entirely in the Tampa Bay area,
has an end-to-end distance no greater than that of most Flor7 There is no merit to appellant's contention that the District Court
failed to adjudicate the constitutionality of District 21. See Brief for Appellant 35. The District Court noted the deference due the State, and
expressly held Plan 386 to be constitutional. 920 F. Supp. 1248, 1255, 1256
(MD Fla. 1996) ("Plan 386 passes any pertinent test of constitutionality
and fairness").

Opinion of the Court
ida Senate districts,8 and in shape does not stand out as different from numerous other Florida House and Senate districts. See App. 26, 60-75. While District 21 crosses a
body of water and encompasses portions of three counties,
evidence submitted showed that both features are common
characteristics of Florida legislative districts, being products
of the State's geography and the fact that 40 Senate districts
are superimposed on 67 counties. See id., at 28, 32-33.9

Addressing composition, the District Court found that the
residents of District 21 "regard themselves as a community."
920 F. Supp., at 1255. Evidence indicated that District 21
comprises a predominantly urban, low-income population,
the poorest of the nine districts in the Tampa Bay region
and among the poorest districts in the State, whose white
and black members alike share a similarly depressed economic condition, see App. 30-31, 49-51, and interests that
reflect it, id., at 149-154. The fact that District 21 under
Plan 386 is not a majority black district, the black voting-age
population being 36.2%, supports the District Court's finding
that the district is not a "safe" one for black-preferred candidates, but one that "offers to any candidate, without regard
to race, the opportunity" to seek and be elected to office.
920 F. Supp., at 1256.

8 The distance is 50 miles and record evidence indicates that only 15 of
the 40 Senate districts in Florida cover less distance from end-to-end.
See App. 26.

9 The Supreme Court of Florida has held that the presence in a district

of a body of water, even without a connecting bridge and even if such
districting necessitates land travel outside the district to reach other parts
of the district, "does not violate this Court's standard for determining
contiguity under the Florida Constitution." In re Constitutionality of
Senate Joint Resolution 2G, 597 So. 2d 276, 280 (Fla. 1992).

In addition, only 9 of the State's 40 Senate districts are located within
a single county, and 5 of those are within Dade County. See App. 33.
Multicounty districting also increases the number of legislators who can
speak for each county, a districting goal traditionally pursued in the State.
See id., at 32, and n. 7.

582 LAWYER v. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

Opinion of the Court
Based on these and other considerations,10 the DistrictCourt concluded that traditional districting principles had

not been subordinated to race in drawing revised District 21.Appellant calls this finding clearly erroneous, charging that
District 21 encompasses more than one county, crosses a
body of water, is irregular in shape, lacks compactness, andcontains a percentage of black voters significantly higher

than the overall percentage of black voters in Hillsborough,Manatee, and Pinellas Counties. Brief for Appellant 40-45.
Appellant's first four points ignore unrefuted evidence show-ing that on each of these points District 21 is no different
from what Florida's traditional districting principles couldbe expected to produce. See

supra, at 580-581. As to appellant's final point, we have never suggested that the percentage of black residents in a district may not exceed thepercentage of black residents in any of the counties from

which the district is created, and have never recognized similar racial composition of different political districts as being
necessary to avoid an inference of racial gerrymandering in
any one of them. Since districting can be difficult, after all,
just because racial composition varies from place to place,
and counties and voting districts do not depend on common
principles of size and location, facts about the one do not as
such necessarily entail conclusions about the other.

In short, the evidence amply supports the trial court's
views that race did not predominate over Florida's traditional districting principles in drawing Plan 386. Appellant
has provided nothing that calls that conclusion into question,
much less that points to any clear error.

10 Record evidence indicates that the design of revised District 21 was
also affected by the need to satisfy one-person, one-vote requirements,
App. 28, the desire to retain the existing partisan balance in the Senate,
id., at 31, and the desire to avoid out-of-cycle elections, id., at 28-29. See
also In re Apportionment Law, 414 So. 2d 1040, 1047-1050 (Fla. 1982)

Scalia, J., dissenting
We accordingly affirm the decision of the District Court.

It is so ordered.

Justice Scalia, with whom Justice O'Connor, Justice
Kennedy, and Justice Thomas join, dissenting.

The Court today affirms a Federal District Court's re-drawing of Florida Senate District 21, despite the fact that

the District Court never determined that District 21 wasunconstitutional, and never gave the State an opportunity
to do its own redrawing of the district to remedy whateverunconstitutional features it contained. In my view, the District Court's actions represent an unprecedented intrusionupon state sovereignty.

I
The District Court held that it could exercise its authorityunder the Fourteenth Amendment to "compel the nullification and re-establishment of state legislative boundaries"without finding a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, so
long as "the case presents a sufficient evidentiary and legalbasis to warrant the

bona fide intervention of a federal courtinto matters typically reserved to a state." 920 F. Supp.

1248, 1251-1252 (MD Fla. 1996). Although acknowledgingthat the " `[d]efendants and defendant-intervenors deny
these assertions [of unconstitutionality],' " id., at 1252-1253,n. 3 (quoting Settlement Agreement), the District Court determined that the claim that District 21 was unconstitutionalwas "fairly litigable,"

id., at 1253, n. 3, and found this enoughto justify its reapportionment order.

The only authority cited by the District Court for theproposition that a court can mandate a remedy without finding liability is Justice O'Connor's concurring opinion in
Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Ed., 476 U. S. 267, 284 (1986). Butthat opinion has no bearing on the present case. It dealt

with the question whether a school board could, consistentwith the Constitution, implement an affirmative-action pro521US2 Unit: $U87 [11-20-99 14:47:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN

gram without first making contemporaneous findings thatsuch a program is justified by specific instances of past discrimination. Id., at 289-291. Quite obviously, whether aState may take voluntary action without first determining
that it has violated the law has nothing to do with whethera federal court may

impose a remedy without first determin-ing that the State has violated the law.

The Court evidently believes that an adjudication of un-constitutionality of District 21 was unnecessary here because
the State entered into a consent agreement accepting judicialimposition of Plan 386. For this proposition it relies upon
Firefighters v. Cleveland, 478 U. S. 501 (1986), which saidthat "it is the parties' agreement that serves as the source
of the [District Court's] authority to enter . . . judgment . . . ."
Id., at 522. However, that passage from Firefighters is ofno help to the Court--even putting aside the fact that the

"agreement" there at issue, unlike the one here, was anagreement to remedy unlawful conduct (a "pattern of racial
discrimination") that had been adjudged, id., at 506, 511-512.

1 Firefighters was a Title VII action by minority firefighters, alleging that the city discriminated against them inpromotions. A union representing the majority of the city's

firefighters intervened as a party-plaintiff and objected tothe settlement, contending, among other things, that its consent was required in order for the District Court to enter aconsent decree. We disagreed. The minority firefighters
and the city, we said, could have reached an out-of-courtagreement to resolve their dispute. See

id., at 522-523, and

1 I am puzzled by the Court's assertion that "our opinion in [Firefighters] makes no reference to any findings of liability." Ante, at 579, n. 6.
We said: "Judge Lambros found that `[t]he documents, statistics, and testimony presented at [the] hearings reveal a historical pattern of racial discrimination in the promotions in the City of Cleveland Fire Department.' "

n. 13. "[T]he choice of an enforcement scheme--whether torely on contractual remedies or to have an agreement entered as a consent decree--is itself made voluntarily by theparties." Id., at 523.

In today's case, by contrast, neither the appellant nor theother original plaintiffs (now appellees) could have concluded
a binding out-of-court "redistricting agreement" with repre-sentatives of the Florida Legislature, or with the state attorney general--and the Court does not contend otherwise.The Florida Constitution, Art. III, $ 16, requires the legislature to draw districts "by joint resolution," and providesno authority for the attorney general to do so.

2 Any "redis2 The Florida Legislature is explicitly required to reapportion "at its
regular session in the second year following each decennial census." Fla.
Const., Art. III, $ 16(a). It seems obvious that the legislature is implicitly
authorized to reapportion when its prior reapportionment has been held
unconstitutional. See In re Constitutionality of Senate Joint Resolution
2G, 601 So. 2d 543, 544 (Fla. 1992); Tr. 29-30 (July 6, 1995) (view of counsel
for the Florida House of Representatives); Record 93, at 2 (view of District
21's incumbent Senator). I cannot imagine any basis for asserting that
anyone else, such as the attorney general, has authority to reapportion
(by exercising his "settling authority," ante, at 577, n. 4), when the State's
last reapportionment has not been invalidated. While the Court is correct that the attorney general has broad discretion in representing Florida
in litigation, see ibid., neither the two cases it cites nor any I could find
comes even close to permitting the attorney general to agree with a private citizen to redistrict the State. The Court also asserts, without citation, that "counsel for each legislative chamber confirmed . . . the authority
of the attorney general to propose the settlement plan on the State's behalf." Ante, at 577-578. I am unaware of any such confirmation, and the
record actually suggests there was none. See Tr. 29-30 (July 6, 1995)
(view of counsel for the Florida House of Representatives); Record 93, at
2 (view of District 21's incumbent Senator).

Moreover, under the Florida Constitution the prescribed body to reapportion when the legislature has failed to do so is the Florida Supreme
Court. The Florida Constitution itself states this explicitly with regard
to the legislature's failure to act after the decennial census, Fla. Const.,
Art. III, $ 16; and the Florida Supreme Court has held that it has authority
to reapportion (absent legislative action) in the event of Justice Department refusal of preclearance, and hence by implication in the event of

tricting agreement" entered into by these officials with indi-vidual voters would obviously be null and void. And a court

decree that does not purport to be in remediation of anadjudged violation of law cannot make it binding. See
Firefighters, supra, at 522-523. See also, e. g., Perkins v.
Chicago Heights, 47 F. 3d 212, 216 (CA7 1995).These principles would suffice to invalidate an unauthorized private agreement as the basis for a federal judicial de-cree in even the ordinary case, but they should apply even
more rigorously to an agreement purportedly supporting afederal judicial decree of state reapportionment, which we
have described as an "unwelcome obligation," Connor v.
Finch, 431 U. S. 407, 415 (1977), that should be undertaken
by a district court only as a last resort, see, e. g., White v.
Weiser, 412 U. S. 783 (1973). Indeed, even if it were possiblefor the Florida Legislature to authorize two of its members

to negotiate an apportionment agreement that could be the
basis for a federal court decree, one would think that the
special solicitude we have shown for preservation of the
States' apportionment authority would cause the court to demand clearer credentials on the part of those who purport to
speak for the legislature.3 The District Court asserted that
"Florida's House and Senate . . . manifested . . . the authority
to consent," 920 F. Supp., at 1251, but it points to no resolufederal-court invalidation, see In re Constitutionality of Senate Joint
Resolution 2G, supra, at 544-545.

3 The Court is of the view that participation by Florida's legislative

branches was beside the point, and that the attorney general alone could
propose a redistricting plan and settle this lawsuit without participation

proposition, and the Court provides none. Moreover, this view is contrary to that of the District Court. See 920 F. Supp. 1248, 1252-1253, n. 3
(MD Fla. 1996); id., at 1255 ("Foremost among the factors commending the
proposed resolution in this action is the consent of Florida's Senate and
House . . ."); ibid. ("[P]roposed District 21, like present District 21, is

tion conferring such authority upon the individual legislatorsbefore the court; and as to the Senate, at least, there is some

evidence no such authority exists. The record contains aletter from State Senator Howard C. Forman to the District
Court reading in part as follows:

"This letter is intended to communicate to you in thestrongest possible terms that the Florida Senate has not

agreed to any proposed settlement. As a constitution-ally established collegial body, the Florida Senate can
agree to nothing without open debate and action by theentire body. As a duly elected Member of the Florida
Senate, I have never waived my constitutional duty andresponsibility to participate in all Senate matters. And,
under no circumstances does any individual Senator, orgroup of individual Senators, have the right to agree to
anything in my name. . . .
"Therefore, I challenge any representation that theFlorida Senate has agreed to any proposed settlement

in this case." Record 152.
But in fact all these inquiries into authorization to enterprivate agreements are supererogatory. Even an

authorized private agreement cannot serve as the basis for a federal apportionment decree. We have said explicitly, and inunmistakable terms, that "[f]ederal courts are

barred from
intervening in state apportionment in the absence of a violation of federal law." Voinovich v. Quilter, 507 U. S. 146, 156
(1993) (emphasis added). As Chief Judge Tjoflat's concur-rence below correctly stated, "to enter the judgment in question, the court must find that District 21 is unconstitutional."920 F. Supp., at 1256-1257. I would adhere to that principle.

Finally, I find no merit in the Court's apparent suggestion,
ante, at 578-580, that appellant has no standing to complainof this defect. A judicial decree entered without jurisdiction has mooted his suit. Surely that is enough to sustainhis appeal.

II
The District Court's failure to find the pre-existing Dis-trict 21 unconstitutional is alone enough to require reversal

of the judgment. But the District Court committed a sec-ond error, in failing to give the Florida Legislature the opportunity to redraw the district before imposing a court-ordered solution. We have repeatedly emphasized that
federal interference with state districting "represents a seri-ous intrusion on the most vital of local functions,"

Miller v.
Johnson, 515 U. S. 900, 915 (1995), and that "reapportion-ment[, which] is primarily the duty and responsibility of the

State," Chapman v. Meier, 420 U. S. 1, 27 (1975), " `is primar-ily a matter for legislative consideration and determination,' " Connor v. Finch, supra, at 414 (quoting Reynolds v.Sims, 377 U. S. 533, 586 (1964)). " `[J]udicial relief becomes

appropriate,' " we have said, " `only when a legislature failsto reapportion according to federal constitutional requisites
in a timely fashion after having had an adequate opportunityto do so.' "

White v. Weiser, supra, at 794-795 (quotingReynolds, supra, at 586). See also Growe v. Emison, 507

U. S. 25, 33-34 (1993); Upham v. Seamon, 456 U. S. 37, 41-42(1982) (per curiam); McDaniel v. Sanchez, 452 U. S. 130, 142
(1981); Wise v. Lipscomb, 437 U. S. 535, 540 (1978) (opinionof White, J.). The District Court's failure to give Florida a
reasonable opportunity to craft its own solution after a judi-cial finding that the current districting was unconstitutional--or even (since here such a finding was never made)
after the judicial finding that a constitutional claim is "fairlylitigable"--was most assuredly error.

The District Court repeatedly referred to Plan 386 as a
"legislative solution," 920 F. Supp., at 1255, and the concur-rence described it as a "plan that the Florida legislature has

proposed," id., at 1257. But judicial characterization doesnot overcome reality. The fact that the Speaker of Florida's
House of Representatives and the President of Florida's Sen521US2 Unit: $U87 [11-20-99 14:47:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ate participated in the negotiations and consented to the set-tlement does not magically convert Plan 386 into a Florida

law. The "opportunity to apportion" that our case law re-quires the state legislature to be afforded is an opportunity
to apportion through normal legislative processes, notthrough courthouse negotiations attended by one member of
each House, followed by a court decree.Appellees contend that the District Court actually offered
the legislature the opportunity to redistrict, but that the leg-islature declined. This contention is based upon the fact
that the representatives of the Florida Legislature informedthe District Court, prior to any proceedings on the merits,
that the legislature would likely not sua sponte redraw thedistricts in response to Miller v. Johnson, supra, and on the
status reports filed by the Florida Senate, see ante, at 578,n. 5. But the requisite opportunity that our cases describe
is an opportunity to redraw districts after the extant dis-tricts have been ruled unconstitutional--not after a Supreme
Court case has been announced which may or may not ulti-mately lead to a ruling that the extant districts are unconstitutional. See, e. g., Growe, supra, at 34; McDaniel, supra,at 142;

Reynolds, supra, at 585-586. The State is under noobligation to redistrict unless and until a determination has

been made that there has been a violation of federal law.

* * *
Because the District Court lacked the authority to man-date redistricting without first having found a constitutional

violation; and because the District Court failed to give theState an opportunity to redistrict on its own after notice of
the constitutional violation (or even after notice of the court'sintention to proceed with its own plan), I would reverse the
judgment of the District Court and remand for further pro-ceedings. Given my conclusion on appellant's first two challenges to the District Court's judgment, I have no occasion

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe third circuit

No. 96-270. Argued February 18, 1997--Decided June 25, 1997
This case concerns the legitimacy under Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of

Civil Procedure of a class-action certification sought to achieve global
settlement of current and future asbestos-related claims. Never intending to litigate, the settling parties--petitioners and the representatives of the plaintiff class described below--presented to the District
Court a class-action complaint, an answer, a proposed settlement agreement, and a joint motion for conditional class certification. The complaint identifies nine lead plaintiffs, designating them and members of
their families as representatives of a class comprised of all persons who
had not previously sued any of the asbestos-manufacturing companies
that are petitioners in this suit, but who (1) had been exposed--occupationally or through the occupational exposure of a spouse or household
member--to asbestos attributable to a petitioner, or (2) whose spouse
or family member had been so exposed. Potentially hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of individuals may fit this description. All
named plaintiffs alleged exposure; more than half of them alleged already manifested physical injuries; the others, so-called "exposure-only"
claimants, alleged that they had not yet manifested any asbestos-related
condition. The complaint delineated no subclasses; all named plaintiffs
were designated as representatives of the entire class.

The exhaustive agreement, inter alia, (1) proposed to settle, and to
preclude nearly all class members from litigating, claims not previously
filed against petitioners; (2) detailed an administrative mechanism and
a schedule of payments to compensate class members who meet defined
exposure and medical criteria; (3) described four categories of compensable cancers and nonmalignant conditions, and specified the range of damages to be paid qualifying claimants for each; (4) did not adjust payments
for inflation; (5) capped the number of claims payable annually for each
disease; and (6) denied compensation for family members' loss-ofconsortium claims, for exposure-only plaintiffs' claims for emotional distress, enhanced risk of disease, and medical monitoring, and for "pleural"
claims involving lung plaques but no physical impairment, even if otherwise applicable state law recognized such claims.

Syllabus
The District Court approved the settling parties' plan for giving notice to the class and certified the proposed class for settlement only.
The court found, over numerous challenges raised by the objectors, that
the settlement was fair, the court's jurisdiction properly invoked, and
representation and notice adequate. Pending the issuance of a final
order, the District Court enjoined class members from separately pursuing asbestos suits in any federal or state court. The Third Circuit ultimately vacated the District Court's orders. Although the objectors
maintained that the case was not justiciable and that the exposure-only
claimants lacked standing to sue, the Court of Appeals declined to reach
these issues, reasoning that they would not exist but for the class certification. The court acknowledged that a class action may be certified
for settlement only, but held that the certification requirements of Rule
23 must be met as if the case were going to be litigated, without taking
the settlement into account. The court nevertheless homed in on the
settlement's terms in examining aspects of the case under Rule 23 criteria. The Court of Appeals explained that certification was inappropriate because the class failed to satisfy, among other provisions, Rule
23(b)(3)'s requirement that questions common to the class "predominate
over" other questions, and Rule 23(a)(4)'s adequacy of representation
requirement. The court therefore ordered the class decertified.

Held:

1. The class certification issues are dispositive here in that their resolution is logically antecedent to the existence of any Article III issues.
This Court therefore declines to resolve objectors' assertions that no
justiciable case or controversy is presented and that the exposure-only
claimants lack standing to sue. Cf. Arizonans for Official English v.
Arizona, 520 U. S. 43, 66-67. The Court follows this path mindful that
Rule 23's requirements must be interpreted in keeping with Article III
constraints, and with the Rules Enabling Act's instruction that procedural rules not abridge, enlarge, or modify any substantive right.
Pp. 612-613.

2. The sprawling class the District Court certified does not satisfy
Rule 23's requirements. Pp. 613-629.

(a) Rule 23 gained its current shape in a 1966 revision. Its subdivisions (a) and (b) enumerate criteria that must be met for a class to be
certified. Rule 23(b)(3) was the most adventuresome innovation of the
1966 Amendments, permitting judgments for money that would bind all
class members save those who opt out. To gain certification under Rule
23(b)(3), a class must satisfy the requirements of Rule 23(a), among
them, that named class representatives will fairly and adequately protect class interests; the class must also meet the Rule 23(b)(3) criteria

Syllabus
that common questions "predominate over any questions affecting only
individual members" and that class resolution be "superior to other
available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy." To alert Rule 23(b)(3) class members to their right to "opt out,"
Rule 23 requires "the best notice practicable under the circumstances."
Rule 23(c)(2). Finally, Rule 23(e) specifies that a class action cannot be
settled without the court's approval, and that notice of the proposed
compromise must be given to all class members in such manner as the
court directs. Pp. 613-619.

(b) Because settlement is relevant to the propriety of class certification, the Third Circuit's statement that Rule 23(a) and (b)(3) "must be
satisfied without taking into account the settlement" bears modification.
But the Third Circuit did not, in fact, ignore the settlement. The court
homed in on settlement terms in explaining why it found absentees'
interests inadequately represented. The Third Circuit's inspection of
the settlement agreement in that regard was altogether proper.
Whether trial would present intractable management problems, see
Rule 23(b)(3)(D), is not a consideration when settlement-only certification is requested, for the proposal is that there be no trial. But other
specifications of the Rule designed to protect absentee class members
by blocking unwarranted or overbroad class definitions are of vital importance in the settlement context, for the court in such a case will lack
the opportunity to adjust the class as litigation unfolds. See Rule 23(c)
and (d). And, of overriding importance, courts must be mindful that
they are bound to enforce the Rule as now composed, for Federal Rules
may be amended only through the extensive deliberative process Congress prescribed. Rule 23(e)'s settlement prescription was designed to
function as an additional requirement, not a superseding direction, to
the class-qualifying criteria of Rule 23(a) and (b). Cf. Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U. S. 156, 176-177. The dominant concern of
Rule 23(a) and (b)--that a proposed class have sufficient unity so that
absentees can fairly be bound by class representatives' decisions--persists when settlement, rather than trial, is proposed. Those subdivisions' safeguards provide practical checks in the settlement context.
First, their standards serve to inhibit class certifications dependent
upon the court's gestalt judgment or overarching impression of the settlement's fairness. Second, if a Rule 23(e) fairness inquiry controlled
certification, eclipsing Rule 23(a) and (b), and permitting certification
despite the impossibility of litigation, both class counsel and court would
be disarmed. Class counsel confined to settlement negotiations could
not use the threat of litigation to press for a better offer, and the court
would face a bargain proffered for its approval without benefit of adversarial investigation. Federal courts, in any case, lack authority to sub521US2 Unit: $U88 [11-23-99 18:43:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Syllabus
stitute for Rule 23's certification criteria a standard never adopted by
the rulemakers--that if a settlement is "fair," then certification is
proper. Pp. 619-622.

(c) Rule 23(b)(3)'s predominance requirement is not met by the
factors relied on by the District Court and the settling parties: class
members' shared experience of asbestos exposure; their common interest in receiving prompt and fair compensation, while minimizing the
risks and transaction costs inherent in the tort system's asbestos litigation process; and the settlement's fairness. The benefits asbestosexposed persons might gain from a grand-scale compensation scheme is
a matter fit for legislative consideration, but it is not pertinent to the
predominance inquiry. That inquiry trains on the legal or factual questions that qualify each class member's case as a genuine controversy,
questions that preexist any settlement, and tests whether proposed
classes are sufficiently cohesive to warrant adjudication by representation. In contrast, the Rule 23(e) inquiry protects unnamed class members from unjust or unfair settlements agreed to by fainthearted or selfinterested class representatives; the Rule 23(e) prescription was not
designed to assure the class cohesion that legitimizes representative
action in the first place. If a common interest in a fair compromise
could satisfy Rule 23(b)(3)'s predominance requirement, that vital prescription would be stripped of any meaning in the settlement context.
The predominance criterion is not satisfied by class members' shared
experience of asbestos exposure, given the greater number of questions
peculiar to the several categories of class members, and to individuals
within each category, and the significance of those uncommon questions.
No settlement class called to the Court's attention is as sprawling as the
one certified here. Although mass tort cases arising from a common
cause or disaster may, depending upon the circumstances, satisfy the
predominance requirement, the Advisory Committee for the 1966 Rule
23 revision advised that such cases are ordinarily not appropriate for
class treatment, and warned district courts to exercise caution when
individual stakes are high and disparities among class members great.
The certification in this case does not follow the counsel of caution.
That certification cannot be upheld, for it rests on a conception of Rule
23(b)(3)'s predominance requirement irreconcilable with the Rule's
design. Pp. 622-625.

(d) Nor can the class approved by the District Court satisfy Rule
23(a)(4)'s adequate representation inquiry. That inquiry serves to uncover conflicts of interest between named parties and the class they
seek to represent. See General Telephone Co. of Southwest v. Falcon,
457 U. S. 147, 157-158, n. 13. Representatives must be part of the class
and possess the same interest and suffer the same injury as the class

Syllabus
members. E. g., East Tex. Motor Freight System, Inc. v. Rodriguez,
431 U. S. 395, 403. In this case, named parties with diverse medical
conditions sought to act on behalf of a single giant class rather than on
behalf of discrete subclasses. In significant respects, the interests of
those within the single class are not aligned. Most saliently, for the
currently injured, the critical goal is generous immediate payments.
That goal tugs against the interest of exposure-only plaintiffs in ensuring an ample, inflation-protected fund for the future. Cf. General Telephone Co. of Northwest v. EEOC, 446 U. S. 318, 331. The disparity between the currently injured and exposure-only categories of plaintiffs,
and the diversity within each category, are not made insignificant by
the District Court's finding that petitioners' assets suffice to pay settled
claims. Although this is not a Rule 23(b)(1)(B) "limited fund" case, the
settlement's terms--e. g., no inflation adjustments, only a few claimants
per year permitted to opt out at the back end, and loss-of-consortium
claims extinguished--reflect essential allocation decisions designed to
confine compensation and to limit defendants' liability. Thus, the settling parties achieved a global compromise with no structural assurance
of fair and adequate representation for the diverse groups and individuals affected. The Third Circuit found no assurance here that the named
parties operated under a proper understanding of their representational
responsibilities. That assessment is on the mark. Pp. 625-628.

(e) In light of the conclusions that the class does not satisfy the
requirements of common issue predominance and adequacy of representation, this Court need not rule, definitively, on the adequacy of the
notice given here. The Court recognizes, however, the gravity of the
question whether class-action notice sufficient under the Constitution
and Rule 23 could ever be given to legions so unselfconscious and amorphous as the class certified by the District Court. P. 628.

(f) The argument is sensibly made that a nationwide administrative
claims processing regime would provide the most secure, fair, and
efficient means of compensating victims of asbestos exposure. Congress, however, has not adopted such a solution. Rule 23, which must
be interpreted with fidelity to the Rules Enabling Act and applied with
the interests of absent class members in close view, cannot carry the
large load the settling parties and the District Court heaped upon it.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case concerns the legitimacy under Rule 23 of theFederal Rules of Civil Procedure of a class-action certification sought to achieve global settlement of current andfuture asbestos-related claims. The class proposed for certification potentially encompasses hundreds of thousands,perhaps millions, of individuals tied together by this commonality: Each was, or some day may be, adversely affectedby past exposure to asbestos products manufactured by one
or more of 20 companies. Those companies, defendants inthe lower courts, are petitioners here.

The United States District Court for the Eastern Districtof Pennsylvania certified the class for settlement only, finding
that the proposed settlement was fair and that representa-tion and notice had been adequate. That court enjoined
class members from separately pursuing asbestos-relatedpersonal-injury suits in any court, federal or state, pending
the issuance of a final order. The Court of Appeals for theThird Circuit vacated the District Court's orders, holding
that the class certification failed to satisfy Rule 23's require-ments in several critical respects. We affirm the Court of
Appeals' judgment. I

598 AMCHEM PRODUCTS, INC. v. WINDSOR

Opinion of the Court
ference Ad Hoc Committee on Asbestos Litigation, appointed
by The Chief Justice in September 1990, described facets
of the problem in a 1991 report:

"[This] is a tale of danger known in the 1930s, exposure inflicted upon millions of Americans in the 1940s
and 1950s, injuries that began to take their toll in the
1960s, and a flood of lawsuits beginning in the 1970s.
On the basis of past and current filing data, and because
of a latency period that may last as long as 40 years for
some asbestos related diseases, a continuing stream of
claims can be expected. The final toll of asbestos related injuries is unknown. Predictions have been made
of 200,000 asbestos disease deaths before the year 2000
and as many as 265,000 by the year 2015.

"The most objectionable aspects of asbestos litigation
can be briefly summarized: dockets in both federal and
state courts continue to grow; long delays are routine;
trials are too long; the same issues are litigated over and
over; transaction costs exceed the victims' recovery by
nearly two to one; exhaustion of assets threatens and
distorts the process; and future claimants may lose altogether." Report of The Judicial Conference Ad Hoc
Committee on Asbestos Litigation 2-3 (Mar. 1991).

Real reform, the report concluded, required federal legislation creating a national asbestos dispute-resolution scheme.
See id., at 3, 27-35; see also id., at 42 (dissenting statement
of Hogan, J.) (agreeing that "a national solution is the only
answer" and suggesting "passage by Congress of an administrative claims procedure similar to the Black Lung legislation"). As recommended by the Ad Hoc Committee, the Judicial Conference of the United States urged Congress to act.
See Report of the Proceedings of the Judicial Conference
of the United States 33 (Mar. 12, 1991). To this date, no
congressional response has emerged.

Opinion of the Court
In the face of legislative inaction, the federal courts--lack-ing authority to replace state tort systems with a national

toxic tort compensation regime--endeavored to work withthe procedural tools available to improve management of federal asbestos litigation. Eight federal judges, experiencedin the superintendence of asbestos cases, urged the Judicial
Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (MDL Panel), to consolidate
in a single district all asbestos complaints then pending infederal courts. Accepting the recommendation, the MDL

Panel transferred all asbestos cases then filed, but not yeton trial in federal courts to a single district, the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsyl-vania; pursuant to the transfer order, the collected cases
were consolidated for pretrial proceedings before Judge
Weiner. See In re Asbestos Products Liability Litigation
(No. VI), 771 F. Supp. 415, 422-424 (JPML 1991).1 Theorder aggregated pending cases only; no authority resides in

the MDL Panel to license for consolidated proceedings claims
not yet filed. B

After the consolidation, attorneys for plaintiffs and defendants formed separate steering committees and began
settlement negotiations. Ronald L. Motley and GeneLocks--later appointed, along with Motley's law partner Joseph F. Rice, to represent the plaintiff class in this action--cochaired the Plaintiffs' Steering Committee. Counsel for

In November 1991, the Defendants' Steering Committeemade an offer designed to settle all pending and future asbestos cases by providing a fund for distribution by plaintiffs'counsel among asbestos-exposed individuals. The Plaintiffs'
Steering Committee rejected this offer, and negotiations fellapart. CCR, however, continued to pursue "a workable administrative system for the handling of future claims." Id.,at 270.

To that end, CCR counsel approached the lawyers who hadheaded the Plaintiffs' Steering Committee in the unsuccessful negotiations, and a new round of negotiations began; thatround yielded the mass settlement agreement now in controversy. At the time, the former heads of the Plaintiffs' Steer-ing Committee represented thousands of plaintiffs with
then-pending asbestos-related claims--claimants the parties

to this suit call "inventory" plaintiffs. CCR indicated inthese discussions that it would resist settlement of inventory

cases absent "some kind of protection for the future." Id.,at 294; see also

id., at 295 (CCR communicated to the inventory plaintiffs' attorneys that once the CCR defendants saw
a rational way to deal with claims expected to be filed in thefuture, those defendants would be prepared to address the

settlement of pending cases).Settlement talks thus concentrated on devising an administrative scheme for disposition of asbestos claims not yetin litigation. In these negotiations, counsel for masses of
inventory plaintiffs endeavored to represent the interests of
the anticipated future claimants, although those lawyers then
had no attorney-client relationship with such claimants.

Once negotiations seemed likely to produce an agreement
purporting to bind potential plaintiffs, CCR agreed to settle,
through separate agreements, the claims of plaintiffs who
had already filed asbestos-related lawsuits. In one such
agreement, CCR defendants promised to pay more than $200
million to gain release of the claims of numerous inventory
plaintiffs. After settling the inventory claims, CCR, together with the plaintiffs' lawyers CCR had approached,
launched this case, exclusively involving persons outside the
MDL Panel's province--plaintiffs without already pending
lawsuits.3

C

The class action thus instituted was not intended to be
litigated. Rather, within the space of a single day, January 15, 1993, the settling parties--CCR defendants and the
representatives of the plaintiff class described below--presented to the District Court a complaint, an answer, a pro3 It is basic to comprehension of this proceeding to notice that no transferred case is included in the settlement at issue, and no case covered by

The complaint identified nine lead plaintiffs, designatingthem and members of their families as representatives of a

class comprising all persons who had not filed an asbestosrelated lawsuit against a CCR defendant as of the date theclass action commenced, but who (1) had been exposed--

occupationally or through the occupational exposure of aspouse or household member--to asbestos or products containing asbestos attributable to a CCR defendant, or (2)whose spouse or family member had been so exposed.

5 Untold numbers of individuals may fall within this description.All named plaintiffs alleged that they or a member of their

family had been exposed to asbestos-containing products of

4 Also on the same day, the CCR defendants filed a third-party action
against their insurers, seeking a declaratory judgment holding the insurers liable for the costs of the settlement. The insurance litigation, upon
which implementation of the settlement is conditioned, is still pending in
the District Court. See, e. g., Georgine v. Amchem Prods., Inc., No. 93-
0215, 1994 WL 502475 (ED Pa., Sept. 2, 1994) (denying motion of insurers
to compel discovery).

5 The complaint defines the class as follows:

"(a) All persons (or their legal representatives) who have been exposed
in the United States or its territories (or while working aboard U. S. military, merchant, or passenger ships), either occupationally or through the
occupational exposure of a spouse or household member, to asbestos or to
asbestos-containing products for which one or more of the Defendants may
bear legal liability and who, as of January 15, 1993, reside in the United
States or its territories, and who have not, as of January 15, 1993, filed a
lawsuit for asbestos-related personal injury, or damage, or death in any
state or federal court against the Defendant(s) (or against entities for
whose actions or omissions the Defendant(s) bear legal liability).

"(b) All spouses, parents, children, and other relatives (or their legal
representatives) of the class members described in paragraph (a) above
who have not, as of January 15, 1993, filed a lawsuit for the asbestosrelated personal injury, or damage, or death of a class member described
in paragraph (a) above in any state or federal court against the Defendant(s) (or against entities for whose actions or omissions the Defendant(s)
bear legal liability)." 1 App. 13-14.

Opinion of the Court
CCR defendants. More than half of the named plaintiffs al-leged that they or their family members had already suffered

various physical injuries as a result of the exposure. Theothers alleged that they had not yet manifested any
asbestos-related condition. The complaint delineated no
subclasses; all named plaintiffs were designated as repre-sentatives of the class as a whole.

The complaint invoked the District Court's diversity juris-diction and asserted various state-law claims for relief, including (1) negligent failure to warn, (2) strict liability, (3)breach of express and implied warranty, (4) negligent infliction of emotional distress, (5) enhanced risk of disease, (6)
medical monitoring, and (7) civil conspiracy. Each plaintiff
requested unspecified damages in excess of $100,000. CCR
defendants' answer denied the principal allegations of the
complaint and asserted 11 affirmative defenses.

A stipulation of settlement accompanied the pleadings; it
proposed to settle, and to preclude nearly all class members
from litigating against CCR companies, all claims not filed
before January 15, 1993, involving compensation for present
and future asbestos-related personal injury or death. An
exhaustive document exceeding 100 pages, the stipulation
presents in detail an administrative mechanism and a schedule of payments to compensate class members who meet
defined asbestos-exposure and medical requirements. The
stipulation describes four categories of compensable disease:
mesothelioma; lung cancer; certain "other cancers" (colonrectal, laryngeal, esophageal, and stomach cancer); and
"non-malignant conditions" (asbestosis and bilateral pleural
thickening). Persons with "exceptional" medical claims--
claims that do not fall within the four described diagnostic
categories--may in some instances qualify for compensation,
but the settlement caps the number of "exceptional" claims
CCR must cover.

For each qualifying disease category, the stipulation specifies the range of damages CCR will pay to qualifying claim521US2 Unit: $U88 [11-23-99 18:43:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
ants. Payments under the settlement are not adjustablefor inflation. Mesothelioma claimants--the most highly

compensated category--are scheduled to receive between$20,000 and $200,000. The stipulation provides that CCR is
to propose the level of compensation within the prescribedranges; it also establishes procedures to resolve disputes
over medical diagnoses and levels of compensation.Compensation above the fixed ranges may be obtained for
"extraordinary" claims. But the settlement places both nu-merical caps and dollar limits on such claims.

6 The settlement also imposes "case flow maximums," which cap the
number of claims payable for each disease in a given year.Class members are to receive no compensation for certain

kinds of claims, even if otherwise applicable state law recog-nizes such claims. Claims that garner no compensation
under the settlement include claims by family members of
asbestos-exposed individuals for loss of consortium, andclaims by so-called "exposure-only" plaintiffs for increased

risk of cancer, fear of future asbestos-related injury, andmedical monitoring. "Pleural" claims, which might be asserted by persons with asbestos-related plaques on theirlungs but no accompanying physical impairment, are also
excluded. Although not entitled to present compensation,exposure-only claimants and pleural claimants may qualify
for benefits when and if they develop a compensable disease
and meet the relevant exposure and medical criteria. De-fendants forgo defenses to liability, including statute of limitations pleas.Class members, in the main, are bound by the settlement
in perpetuity, while CCR defendants may choose to with6 Only three percent of the qualified mesothelioma, lung cancer, and
"other cancer" claims, and only one percent of the total number of qualified
"non-malignant condition" claims can be designated "extraordinary." Average expenditures are specified for claims found "extraordinary"; mesothelioma victims with compensable extraordinary claims, for example, receive, on average, $300,000.

draw from the settlement after ten years. A small numberof class members--only a few per year--may reject the settlement and pursue their claims in court. Those permittedto exercise this option, however, may not assert any punitive
damages claim or any claim for increased risk of cancer. As-pects of the administration of the settlement are to be monitored by the AFL-CIO and class counsel. Class counsel areto receive attorneys' fees in an amount to be approved by
the District Court. D

On January 29, 1993, as requested by the settling parties,the District Court conditionally certified, under Federal
Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3), an encompassing opt-outclass. The certified class included persons occupationally
exposed to defendants' asbestos products, and members oftheir families, who had not filed suit as of January 15. Judge
Weiner appointed Locks, Motley, and Rice as class counsel,noting that "[t]he Court may in the future appoint additional
counsel if it is deemed necessary and advisable." Record,Doc. 11, p. 3 (Class Certification Order). At no stage of the
proceedings, however, were additional counsel in fact ap-pointed. Nor was the class ever divided into subclasses. In
a separate order, Judge Weiner assigned to Judge Reed, alsoof the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, "the task of conducting fairness proceedings and of determining whether theproposed settlement is fair to the class." See 157 F. R. D.,
at 258. Various class members raised objections to the set-tlement stipulation, and Judge Weiner granted the objectors
full rights to participate in the subsequent proceedings.

groups of individuals with overlapping interests, designated as the "Windsor Group," the New Jersey "White Lung Group," and the "Cargile

before this Court. Balonis states that her husband, Casimir, was exposed
to asbestos in the late 1940's and was diagnosed with mesothelioma in May

Opinion of the Court
In preliminary rulings, Judge Reed held that the DistrictCourt had subject-matter jurisdiction, see

Carlough v. Amchem Products, Inc., 834 F. Supp. 1437, 1467-1468 (ED Pa.1993), and he approved the settling parties' elaborate plan

for giving notice to the class, see Carlough v. Amchem Products, Inc., 158 F. R. D. 314, 336 (ED Pa. 1993). The courtapproved notice informed recipients that they could exclude
themselves from the class, if they so chose, within a threemonth opt-out period.

Objectors raised numerous challenges to the settlement.
They urged that the settlement unfairly disadvantaged those
without currently compensable conditions in that it failed to
adjust for inflation or to account for changes, over time, in
medical understanding. They maintained that compensation levels were intolerably low in comparison to awards
available in tort litigation or payments received by the inventory plaintiffs. And they objected to the absence of any
compensation for certain claims, for example, medical monitoring, compensable under the tort law of several States.
Rejecting these and all other objections, Judge Reed concluded that the settlement terms were fair and had been negotiated without collusion. See 157 F. R. D., at 325, 331-332.
He also found that adequate notice had been given to class
members, see id., at 332-334, and that final class certification
under Rule 23(b)(3) was appropriate, see id., at 315.

As to the specific prerequisites to certification, the District
Court observed that the class satisfied Rule 23(a)(1)'s numerosity requirement,8 see ibid., a matter no one debates. The

1994, after expiration of the opt-out period, see infra this page and 608.
The Balonises sued CCR members in Maryland state court, but were
charged with civil contempt for violating the Federal District Court's antisuit injunction. Casimir Balonis died in October 1996. See Brief for Balonis Respondents 9-11.

8 Rule 23(a)(1) requires that the class be "so numerous that joinder of

all members is impracticable."

Opinion of the Court
Rule 23(a)(2) and (b)(3) requirements of commonality 9 andpreponderance

10 were also satisfied, the District Court held,

in that

"[t]he members of the class have all been exposed toasbestos products supplied by the defendants and all

share an interest in receiving prompt and fair compensa-tion for their claims, while minimizing the risks and
transaction costs inherent in the asbestos litigation proc-ess as it occurs presently in the tort system. Whether
the proposed settlement satisfies this interest and is oth-erwise a fair, reasonable and adequate compromise of
the claims of the class is a predominant issue for pur-poses of Rule 23(b)(3)." Id., at 316.

The District Court held next that the claims of the class rep-resentatives were "typical" of the class as a whole, a requirement of Rule 23(a)(3),11 and that, as Rule 23(b)(3) demands,12the class settlement was "superior" to other methods of adjudication. See ibid.Strenuous objections had been asserted regarding the adequacy of representation, a Rule 23(a)(4) requirement.13 Ob-jectors maintained that class counsel and class representatives had disqualifying conflicts of interests. In particular,objectors urged, claimants whose injuries had become manifest and claimants without manifest injuries should not havecommon counsel and should not be aggregated in a single

9 Rule 23(a)(2) requires that there be "questions of law or fact common
to the class."

10 Rule 23(b)(3) requires that "the [common] questions of law or fact . . .

11 Rule 23(a)(3) states that "the claims . . . of the representative parties

[must be] typical of the claims . . . of the class."

12 Rule 23(b)(3) requires that "a class action [be] superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy."

13 Rule 23(a)(4) requires that "the representative parties will fairly and

adequately protect the interests of the class."

Opinion of the Court
class. Furthermore, objectors argued, lawyers represent-ing inventory plaintiffs should not represent the newly

formed class.Satisfied that class counsel had ably negotiated the settlement in the best interests of all concerned, and that thenamed parties served as adequate representatives, the District Court rejected these objections. See id., at 317-319,326-332. Subclasses were unnecessary, the District Court
held, bearing in mind the added cost and confusion theywould entail and the ability of class members to exclude
themselves from the class during the three-month opt-outperiod. See

id., at 318-319. Reasoning that the repre-sentative plaintiffs "have a strong interest that recovery for

all of the medical categories be maximized because they mayhave claims in

any, or several categories," the District Courtfound "no antagonism of interest between class members

with various medical conditions, or between persons withand without currently manifest asbestos impairment." Id.,
at 318. Declaring class certification appropriate and the set-tlement fair, the District Court preliminarily enjoined all
class members from commencing any asbestos-related suitagainst the CCR defendants in any state or federal court.
See Georgine v. Amchem Products, Inc., 878 F. Supp. 716,726-727 (ED Pa. 1994).

The objectors appealed. The United States Court of Ap-peals for the Third Circuit vacated the certification, holding
that the requirements of Rule 23 had not been satisfied. See83 F. 3d 610 (1996).

E
The Court of Appeals, in a long, heavily detailed opinionby Judge Becker, first noted several challenges by objectors

to justiciability, subject-matter jurisdiction, and adequacy ofnotice. These challenges, the court said, raised "serious
concerns." Id., at 623. However, the court observed, "thejurisdictional issues in this case would not exist but for the
[class-action] certification." Ibid. Turning to the class521US2 Unit: $U88 [11-23-99 18:43:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
certification issues and finding them dispositive, the ThirdCircuit declined to decide other questions.

On class-action prerequisites, the Court of Appeals re-ferred to an earlier Third Circuit decision,

In re General
Motors Corp. Pick-Up Truck Fuel Tank Products Liability
Litigation, 55 F. 3d 768, cert. denied, 516 U. S. 824 (1995)(hereinafter

GM Trucks), which held that although a class
action may be certified for settlement purposes only, Rule23(a)'s requirements must be satisfied as if the case were

going to be litigated. 55 F. 3d, at 799-800. The same ruleshould apply, the Third Circuit said, to class certification
under Rule 23(b)(3). See 83 F. 3d, at 625. But cf. In re
Asbestos Litigation, 90 F. 3d 963, 975-976, and n. 8 (CA5
1996), cert. pending, Nos. 96-1379, 96-1394. While stating
that the requirements of Rule 23(a) and (b)(3) must be met
"without taking into account the settlement," 83 F. 3d, at
626, the Court of Appeals in fact closely considered the terms
of the settlement as it examined aspects of the case under
Rule 23 criteria. See id., at 630-634.

The Third Circuit recognized that Rule 23(a)(2)'s "commonality" requirement is subsumed under, or superseded by,
the more stringent Rule 23(b)(3) requirement that questions
common to the class "predominate over" other questions.
The court therefore trained its attention on the "predominance" inquiry. See id., at 627. The harmfulness of asbestos exposure was indeed a prime factor common to the class,
the Third Circuit observed. See id., at 626, 630. But uncommon questions abounded.

In contrast to mass torts involving a single accident, class
members in this case were exposed to different asbestoscontaining products, in different ways, over different periods, and for different amounts of time; some suffered no
physical injury, others suffered disabling or deadly diseases.
See id., at 626, 628. "These factual differences," the Third
Circuit explained, "translate[d] into significant legal differences." Id., at 627. State law governed and varied widely

521US2 Unit: $U88 [11-23-99 18:43:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN
610 AMCHEM PRODUCTS, INC. v. WINDSOR

Opinion of the Court
on such critical issues as "viability of [exposure-only] claims[and] availability of causes of action for medical monitoring,

increased risk of cancer, and fear of future injury." Ibid.14"[T]he number of uncommon issues in this humongous class
action," the Third Circuit concluded, ibid., barred a determi-nation, under existing tort law, that common questions predominated, see id., at 630.The Court of Appeals next found that "serious intra-class
conflicts preclude[d] th[e] class from meeting the adequacy ofrepresentation requirement" of Rule 23(a)(4).

Ibid. Ad-verting to, but not resolving charges of attorney conflict of

interests, the Third Circuit addressed the question whetherthe named plaintiffs could adequately advance the interests
of all class members. The Court of Appeals acknowledged
that the District Court was certainly correct to this extent:" `[T]he members of the class are united in seeking the maximum possible recovery for their asbestos-related claims.' "
Ibid. (quoting 157 F. R. D., at 317). "But the settlement does
more than simply provide a general recovery fund," theCourt of Appeals immediately added; "[r]ather, it makes important judgments on how recovery is to be allocated amongdifferent kinds of plaintiffs, decisions that necessarily favor
some claimants over others." 83 F. 3d, at 630.

In the Third Circuit's view, the "most salient" divergenceof interests separated plaintiffs already afflicted with an

asbestos-related disease from plaintiffs without manifest in-jury (exposure-only plaintiffs). The latter would rationally
want protection against inflation for distant recoveries. See
ibid. They would also seek sturdy back-end opt-out rights
and "causation provisions that can keep pace with changing

14 Recoveries under the laws of different States spanned a wide range.
Objectors assert, for example, that 15 percent of current mesothelioma
claims arise in California, where the statewide average recovery is
$419,674--or more than 209 percent above the $200,000 maximum specified
in the settlement for mesothelioma claims not typed "extraordinary." See
Brief for Respondents George Windsor et al. 5-6, n. 5 (citing 2 App. 461).

Opinion of the Court
science and medicine, rather than freezing in place the sci-ence of 1993."

Id., at 630-631. Already injured parties, in
contrast, would care little about such provisions and wouldrationally trade them for higher current payouts. See

id.,
at 631. These and other adverse interests, the Court of Appeals carefully explained, strongly suggested that an undi-vided set of representatives could not adequately protect the

discrete interests of both currently afflicted and exposure-only claimants.

The Third Circuit next rejected the District Court's deter-mination that the named plaintiffs were "typical" of the
class, noting that this Rule 23(a)(3) inquiry overlaps the adequacy of representation question: "both look to the potential
for conflicts in the class." Id., at 632. Evident conflict
problems, the court said, led it to hold that "no set of representatives can be `typical' of this class." Ibid.

The Court of Appeals similarly rejected the District
Court's assessment of the superiority of the class action.
The Third Circuit initially noted that a class action so large
and complex "could not be tried." Ibid. The court elaborated most particularly, however, on the unfairness of binding exposure-only plaintiffs who might be unaware of the
class action or lack sufficient information about their exposure to make a reasoned decision whether to stay in or
opt out. See id., at 633. "A series of statewide or more
narrowly defined adjudications, either through consolidation under Rule 42(a) or as class actions under Rule 23,
would seem preferable," the Court of Appeals said. Id., at
634.

The Third Circuit, after intensive review, ultimately ordered decertification of the class and vacation of the District
Court's antisuit injunction. Id., at 635. Judge Wellford
concurred, "fully subscrib[ing] to the decision of Judge
Becker that the plaintiffs in this case ha[d] not met the requirements of Rule 23." Ibid. He added that in his view,
named exposure-only plaintiffs had no standing to pursue the

suit in federal court, for their depositions showed that "[t]heyclaimed no damages and no present injury." Id., at 638.

We granted certiorari, 519 U. S. 957 (1996), and now affirm.

II
Objectors assert in this Court, as they did in the DistrictCourt and Court of Appeals, an array of jurisdictional barriers. Most fundamentally, they maintain that the settlementproceeding instituted by class counsel and CCR is not a justiciable case or controversy within the confines of Article IIIof the Federal Constitution. In the main, they say, the proceeding is a nonadversarial endeavor to impose on countlessindividuals without currently ripe claims an administrative
compensation regime binding on those individuals if andwhen they manifest injuries.

Furthermore, objectors urge that exposure-only claimantslack standing to sue: Either they have not yet sustained any
cognizable injury or, to the extent the complaint statesclaims and demands relief for emotional distress, enhanced
risk of disease, and medical monitoring, the settlementprovides no redress. Objectors also argue that exposureonly claimants did not meet the then-current amount-in-controversy requirement (in excess of $50,000) specified for
federal-court jurisdiction based upon diversity of citizenship.See 28 U. S. C. $ 1332(a).

As earlier recounted, see supra, at 608, the Third Circuitdeclined to reach these issues because they "would not exist
but for the [class-action] certification." 83 F. 3d, at 623. Weagree that "[t]he class certification issues are dispositive,"
ibid.; because their resolution here is logically antecedent tothe existence of any Article III issues, it is appropriate to
reach them first, cf. Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520 U. S. 43, 66-67 (1997) (declining to resolve defini-tively question whether petitioners had standing because

mootness issue was dispositive of the case). We thereforefollow the path taken by the Court of Appeals, mindful that

613Cite as: 521 U. S. 591 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
Rule 23's requirements must be interpreted in keeping with
Article III constraints, and with the Rules Enabling Act,
which instructs that rules of procedure "shall not abridge,
enlarge or modify any substantive right," 28 U. S. C.

$ 2072(b). See also Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 82 ("rules shall not
be construed to extend . . . the [subject-matter] jurisdiction
of the United States district courts").15

III
To place this controversy in context, we briefly describe
the characteristics of class actions for which the Federal
Rules provide. Rule 23, governing federal-court class actions, stems from equity practice and gained its current
shape in an innovative 1966 revision. See generally Kaplan,
Continuing Work of the Civil Committee: 1966 Amendments
of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (I), 81 Harv. L. Rev.
356, 375-400 (1967) (hereinafter Kaplan, Continuing Work).
Rule 23(a) states four threshold requirements applicable to
all class actions: (1) numerosity (a "class [so large] that joinder of all members is impracticable"); (2) commonality
("questions of law or fact common to the class"); (3) typicality
(named parties' claims or defenses "are typical . . . of the
class"); and (4) adequacy of representation (representatives
"will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the
class").

15 The opinion dissenting in part does not find the class-certification issues dispositive--at least not yet, and would return the case to the Third
Circuit for a second look. See post, at 630-631, 641. If certification issues were genuinely in doubt, however, the jurisdictional issues would
loom larger. Concerning objectors' assertions that exposure-only claimants do not satisfy the $50,000 amount-in-controversy and may have no
currently ripe claim, see Metro-North Commuter R. Co. v. Buckley, ante,
p. 424 (Federal Employers' Liability Act, 35 Stat. 65, as amended, 45
U. S. C. $ 51 et seq., interpreted in light of common-law principles, does not
permit "exposure-only" railworker to recover for negligent infliction of
emotional distress or lump-sum damages for costs of medical monitoring).

Opinion of the Court
In addition to satisfying Rule 23(a)'s prerequisites, partiesseeking class certification must show that the action is maintainable under Rule 23(b)(1), (2), or (3). Rule 23(b)(1) coverscases in which separate actions by or against individual class
members would risk establishing "incompatible standards of
conduct for the party opposing the class," Fed. Rule Civ.Proc. 23(b)(1)(A), or would "as a practical matter be dispositive of the interests" of nonparty class members "or substan-tially impair or impede their ability to protect their interests," Rule 23(b)(1)(B). Rule 23(b)(1)(A) "takes in caseswhere the party is obliged by law to treat the members of
the class alike (a utility acting toward customers; a government imposing a tax), or where the party must treat all alike
as a matter of practical necessity (a riparian owner using
water as against downriver owners)." Kaplan, Continuing
Work 388 (footnotes omitted). Rule 23(b)(1)(B) includes, for
example, "limited fund" cases, instances in which numerous

claims. See Advisory Committee's Notes on Fed. Rule Civ.
Proc. 23, 28 U. S. C. App., pp. 696-697 (hereinafter Adv.
Comm. Notes).

Rule 23(b)(2) permits class actions for declaratory or injunctive relief where "the party opposing the class has acted
or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the
class." Civil rights cases against parties charged with unlawful, class-based discrimination are prime examples. Adv.
Comm. Notes, 28 U. S. C. App., p. 697; see Kaplan, Continuing Work 389 (subdivision (b)(2) "build[s] on experience
mainly, but not exclusively, in the civil rights field").

In the 1966 class-action amendments, Rule 23(b)(3), the
category at issue here, was "the most adventuresome" innovation. See Kaplan, A Prefatory Note, 10 B. C. Ind. & Com.
L. Rev. 497, 497 (1969) (hereinafter Kaplan, Prefatory Note).

excluded. See 7A C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane, Federal
Practice and Procedure $ 1777, p. 517 (2d ed. 1986) (hereinafter Wright, Miller, & Kane); see generally Kaplan, Continuing Work 379-400. Rule 23(b)(3) "opt-out" class actions superseded the former "spurious" class action, so characterized
because it generally functioned as a permissive joinder
("opt-in") device. See 7A Wright, Miller, & Kane $ 1753, at
28-31, 42-44; see also Adv. Comm. Notes, 28 U. S. C. App.,
p. 695.

Framed for situations in which "class-action treatment is
not as clearly called for" as it is in Rule 23(b)(1) and (b)(2)
situations, Rule 23(b)(3) permits certification where class
suit "may nevertheless be convenient and desirable." Adv.
Comm. Notes, 28 U. S. C. App., p. 697. To qualify for certification under Rule 23(b)(3), a class must meet two requirements beyond the Rule 23(a) prerequisites: Common questions must "predominate over any questions affecting only
individual members"; and class resolution must be "superior
to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy." In adding "predominance" and
"superiority" to the qualification-for-certification list, the Advisory Committee sought to cover cases "in which a class
action would achieve economies of time, effort, and expense,
and promote . . . uniformity of decision as to persons similarly situated, without sacrificing procedural fairness or
bringing about other undesirable results." Ibid. Sensitive
to the competing tugs of individual autonomy for those who
might prefer to go it alone or in a smaller unit, on the one
hand, and systemic efficiency on the other, the Reporter for
the 1966 amendments cautioned: "The new provision invites
a close look at the case before it is accepted as a class action
. . . ." Kaplan, Continuing Work 390.

Rule 23(b)(3) includes a nonexhaustive list of factors pertinent to a court's "close look" at the predominance and superiority criteria:

521US2 Unit: $U88 [11-23-99 18:43:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN
616 AMCHEM PRODUCTS, INC. v. WINDSOR

Opinion of the Court
"(A) the interest of members of the class in individually
controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions; (B) the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already commenced by or
against members of the class; (C) the desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims
in the particular forum; (D) the difficulties likely to be
encountered in the management of a class action."

In setting out these factors, the Advisory Committee for

the 1966 reform anticipated that in each case, courts would
"consider the interests of individual members of the class in
controlling their own litigations and carrying them on as
they see fit." Adv. Comm. Notes, 28 U. S. C. App., p. 698.
They elaborated:

"The interests of individuals in conducting separate lawsuits may be so strong as to call for denial of a class
action. On the other hand, these interests may be theoretic rather than practical; the class may have a high
degree of cohesion and prosecution of the action through
representatives would be quite unobjectionable, or the
amounts at stake for individuals may be so small that
separate suits would be impracticable." Ibid.

See also Kaplan, Continuing Work 391 ("Th[e] interest [in
individual control] can be high where the stake of each member bulks large and his will and ability to take care of himself
are strong; the interest may be no more than theoretic where
the individual stake is so small as to make a separate action
impracticable." (footnote omitted)). As the Third Circuit
observed in the instant case: "Each plaintiff [in an action
involving claims for personal injury and death] has a significant interest in individually controlling the prosecution of
[his case]"; each "ha[s] a substantial stake in making individual decisions on whether and when to settle." 83 F. 3d, at
633.

Opinion of the Court
While the text of Rule 23(b)(3) does not exclude from certi-fication cases in which individual damages run high, the Advisory Committee had dominantly in mind vindication of "therights of groups of people who individually would be without
effective strength to bring their opponents into court at all."
Kaplan, Prefatory Note 497. As concisely recalled in a re-cent Seventh Circuit opinion:

"The policy at the very core of the class action mechanism is to overcome the problem that small recoveriesdo not provide the incentive for any individual to bring a

solo action prosecuting his or her rights. A class action
solves this problem by aggregating the relatively paltrypotential recoveries into something worth someone's

(usually an attorney's) labor." Mace v. Van Ru Credit
Corp., 109 F. 3d 338, 344 (1997).

To alert class members to their right to "opt out" of a (b)(3)class, Rule 23 instructs the court to "direct to the members

of the class the best notice practicable under the circum-stances, including individual notice to all members who can
be identified through reasonable effort." Fed. Rule Civ.Proc. 23(c)(2); see

Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U. S.
156, 173-177 (1974) (individual notice to class members iden-tifiable through reasonable effort is mandatory in (b)(3) actions; requirement may not be relaxed based on high cost).

No class action may be "dismissed or compromised without[court] approval," preceded by notice to class members.

Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(e). The Advisory Committee's solecomment on this terse final provision of Rule 23 restates the
Rule's instruction without elaboration: "Subdivision (e) requires approval of the court, after notice, for the dismissal
or compromise of any class action." Adv. Comm. Notes, 28
U. S. C. App., p. 699.

In the decades since the 1966 revision of Rule 23, classaction practice has become ever more "adventuresome" as a
means of coping with claims too numerous to secure their

Opinion of the Court
"just, speedy, and inexpensive determination" one by one.See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 1. The development reflects concerns about the efficient use of court resources and the con-servation of funds to compensate claimants who do not line
up early in a litigation queue. See generally J. Weinstein,
Individual Justice in Mass Tort Litigation: The Effect ofClass Actions, Consolidations, and Other Multiparty Devices

(1995); Schwarzer, Settlement of Mass Tort Class Actions:Order out of Chaos, 80 Cornell L. Rev. 837 (1995).

Among current applications of Rule 23(b)(3), the "settle-ment only" class has become a stock device. See,

e. g., T.
Willging, L. Hooper, & R. Niemic, Empirical Study of Class
Actions in Four Federal District Courts: Final Report to the
Advisory Committee on Civil Rules 61-62 (1996) (noting
large number of such cases in districts studied). Although
all Federal Circuits recognize the utility of Rule 23(b)(3) settlement classes, courts have divided on the extent to which
a proffered settlement affects court surveillance under Rule
23's certification criteria.

In GM Trucks, 55 F. 3d, at 799-800, and in the instant
case, 83 F. 3d, at 624-626, the Third Circuit held that a class
cannot be certified for settlement when certification for trial
would be unwarranted. Other courts have held that settlement obviates or reduces the need to measure a proposed
class against the enumerated Rule 23 requirements. See,
e. g., In re Asbestos Litigation, 90 F. 3d, at 975 (CA5) ("in
settlement class context, common issues arise from the settlement itself ") (citing H. Newberg & A. Conte, 2 Newberg
on Class Actions $ 11.28, p. 11-58 (3d ed. 1992)); White v.
National Football League, 41 F. 3d 402, 408 (CA8 1994) ("adequacy of class representation . . . is ultimately determined
by the settlement itself "), cert. denied, 515 U. S. 1137 (1995);
In re A. H. Robins Co., 880 F. 2d 709, 740 (CA4) ("[i]f not a
ground for certification per se, certainly settlement should
be a factor, and an important factor, to be considered when
determining certification"), cert. denied sub nom. Anderson

"even though the requirements of subdivision (b)(3) mightnot be met for purposes of trial." Proposed Amendment to
Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(b), 117 S. Ct. No. 1 CXIX, CLIV toCLV (Aug. 1996) (Request for Comment). In response to
the publication of this proposal, voluminous public com-ments--many of them opposed to, or skeptical of, the amendment--were received by the Judicial Conference StandingCommittee on Rules of Practice and Procedure. See, e. g.,
Letter from Steering Committee to Oppose Proposed Rule23, signed by 129 law professors (May 28, 1996); Letter from
Paul D. Carrington (May 21, 1996). The Committee has notyet acted on the matter. We consider the certification at
issue under the Rule as it is currently framed.

IV
We granted review to decide the role settlement may play,under existing Rule 23, in determining the propriety of class

certification. The Third Circuit's opinion stated that each ofthe requirements of Rule 23(a) and (b)(3) "must be satisfied
without taking into account the settlement." 83 F. 3d, at626 (quoting GM Trucks, 55 F. 3d, at 799). That statement,
petitioners urge, is incorrect.We agree with petitioners to this limited extent: Settlement is relevant to a class certification. The Third Circuit'sopinion bears modification in that respect. But, as we earlier observed, see supra, at 609, the Court of Appeals in factdid not ignore the settlement; instead, that court homed in on
settlement terms in explaining why it found the absentees'

Opinion of the Court
interests inadequately represented. See 83 F. 3d, at 630-631. The Third Circuit's close inspection of the settlement

in that regard was altogether proper.Confronted with a request for settlement-only class certification, a district court need not inquire whether the case,if tried, would present intractable management problems,
see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(b)(3)(D), for the proposal is thatthere be no trial. But other specifications of the Rule--
those designed to protect absentees by blocking unwar-ranted or overbroad class definitions--demand undiluted,
even heightened, attention in the settlement context. Suchattention is of vital importance, for a court asked to certify
a settlement class will lack the opportunity, present when acase is litigated, to adjust the class, informed by the proceedings as they unfold. See Rule 23(c), (d).16And, of overriding importance, courts must be mindful
that the Rule as now composed sets the requirements theyare bound to enforce. Federal Rules take effect after an
extensive deliberative process involving many reviewers: aRules Advisory Committee, public commenters, the Judicial
Conference, this Court, the Congress. See 28 U. S. C.$$ 2073, 2074. The text of a rule thus proposed and reviewed limits judicial inventiveness. Courts are not free toamend a rule outside the process Congress ordered, a process properly tuned to the instruction that rules of procedure"shall not abridge . . . any substantive right." $ 2072(b).

Rule 23(e), on settlement of class actions, reads in its en-tirety: "A class action shall not be dismissed or compromised

16 Portions of the opinion dissenting in part appear to assume that settlement counts only one way--in favor of certification. See post, at 629, 630,
641. But see post, at 635. To the extent that is the dissent's meaning,
we disagree. Settlement, though a relevant factor, does not inevitably
signal that class-action certification should be granted more readily than
it would be were the case to be litigated. For reasons the Third Circuit
aired, see 83 F. 3d 610, 626-635 (1996), proposed settlement classes sometimes warrant more, not less, caution on the question of certification.

Opinion of the Court
without the approval of the court, and notice of the proposed
dismissal or compromise shall be given to all members of the
class in such manner as the court directs." This prescription was designed to function as an additional requirement,
not a superseding direction, for the "class action" to which
Rule 23(e) refers is one qualified for certification under Rule
23(a) and (b). Cf. Eisen, 417 U. S., at 176-177 (adequate
representation does not eliminate additional requirement
to provide notice). Subdivisions (a) and (b) focus court
attention on whether a proposed class has sufficient unity
so that absent members can fairly be bound by decisions
of class representatives. That dominant concern persists
when settlement, rather than trial, is proposed.

The safeguards provided by the Rule 23(a) and (b) classqualifying criteria, we emphasize, are not impractical impediments--checks shorn of utility--in the settlement-class context. First, the standards set for the protection of absent
class members serve to inhibit appraisals of the chancellor's
foot kind--class certifications dependent upon the court's
gestalt judgment or overarching impression of the settlement's fairness.

Second, if a fairness inquiry under Rule 23(e) controlled
certification, eclipsing Rule 23(a) and (b), and permitting
class designation despite the impossibility of litigation, both
class counsel and court would be disarmed. Class counsel
confined to settlement negotiations could not use the threat
of litigation to press for a better offer, see Coffee, Class
Wars: The Dilemma of the Mass Tort Class Action, 95 Colum.
L. Rev. 1343, 1379-1380 (1995), and the court would face a
bargain proffered for its approval without benefit of adversarial investigation, see, e. g., Kamilewicz v. Bank of Boston
Corp., 100 F. 3d 1348, 1352 (CA7 1996) (Easterbrook, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc) (parties "may even

622 AMCHEM PRODUCTS, INC. v. WINDSOR

Opinion of the Court
Federal courts, in any case, lack authority to substitute forRule 23's certification criteria a standard never adopted--

that if a settlement is "fair," then certification is proper.Applying to this case criteria the rulemakers set, we conclude that the Third Circuit's appraisal is essentially correct.Although that court should have acknowledged that settlement is a factor in the calculus, a remand is not warrantedon that account. The Court of Appeals' opinion amply demonstrates why--with or without a settlement on the table--the sprawling class the District Court certified does not satisfy Rule 23's requirements.17

A
We address first the requirement of Rule 23(b)(3) that"[common] questions of law or fact . . . predominate over any

questions affecting only individual members." The DistrictCourt concluded that predominance was satisfied based on
two factors: class members' shared experience of asbestosexposure and their common "interest in receiving prompt
and fair compensation for their claims, while minimizing therisks and transaction costs inherent in the asbestos litigation
process as it occurs presently in the tort system." 157F. R. D., at 316. The settling parties also contend that the
settlement's fairness is a common question, predominatingover disparate legal issues that might be pivotal in litigation
but become irrelevant under the settlement.The predominance requirement stated in Rule 23(b)(3), we
hold, is not met by the factors on which the District Courtrelied. The benefits asbestos-exposed persons might gain
from the establishment of a grand-scale compensationscheme is a matter fit for legislative consideration, see supra,

17 We do not inspect and set aside for insufficient evidence District Court
findings of fact. Cf. post, at 633, 637-638. Rather, we focus on the requirements of Rule 23, and endeavor to explain why those requirements
cannot be met for a class so enormously diverse and problematic as the
one the District Court certified.

Opinion of the Court
at 598, but it is not pertinent to the predominance inquiry.
That inquiry trains on the legal or factual questions that
qualify each class member's case as a genuine controversy,
questions that preexist any settlement.18

The Rule 23(b)(3) predominance inquiry tests whether proposed classes are sufficiently cohesive to warrant adjudication by representation. See 7A Wright, Miller, & Kane 518-
519.19 The inquiry appropriate under Rule 23(e), on the
other hand, protects unnamed class members "from unjust
or unfair settlements affecting their rights when the representatives become fainthearted before the action is adjudicated or are able to secure satisfaction of their individual
claims by a compromise." See 7B Wright, Miller, & Kane

$ 1797, at 340-341. But it is not the mission of Rule 23(e) to
assure the class cohesion that legitimizes representative action in the first place. If a common interest in a fair compromise could satisfy the predominance requirement of Rule
23(b)(3), that vital prescription would be stripped of any
meaning in the settlement context.

The District Court also relied upon this commonality: "The
members of the class have all been exposed to asbestos products supplied by the defendants . . . ." 157 F. R. D., at 316.
Even if Rule 23(a)'s commonality requirement may be satis18 In this respect, the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3) is similar to the requirement of Rule 23(a)(3) that "claims or defenses" of the
named representatives must be "typical of the claims or defenses of the
class." The words "claims or defenses" in this context--just as in the
context of Rule 24(b)(2) governing permissive intervention--"manifestly
refer to the kinds of claims or defenses that can be raised in courts of law
as part of an actual or impending law suit." Diamond v. Charles, 476
U. S. 54, 76-77 (1986) (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring
in judgment).

19 This case, we note, involves no "limited fund" capable of supporting

class treatment under Rule 23(b)(1)(B), which does not have a predominance requirement. See Georgine v. Amchem Products, Inc., 157 F. R. D.
246, 318 (ED Pa. 1994); see also id., at 291, and n. 40. The settling parties
sought to proceed exclusively under Rule 23(b)(3).

624 AMCHEM PRODUCTS, INC. v. WINDSOR

Opinion of the Court
fied by that shared experience, the predominance criterion isfar more demanding. See 83 F. 3d, at 626-627. Given the

greater number of questions peculiar to the several catego-ries of class members, and to individuals within each category, and the significance of those uncommon questions, any
overarching dispute about the health consequences of asbes-tos exposure cannot satisfy the Rule 23(b)(3) predominance

standard.The Third Circuit highlighted the disparate questions undermining class cohesion in this case:

"Class members were exposed to different asbestoscontaining products, for different amounts of time, indifferent ways, and over different periods. Some class

members suffer no physical injury or have only asymp-tomatic pleural changes, while others suffer from lung
cancer, disabling asbestosis, or from mesothelioma . . . .Each has a different history of cigarette smoking, a factor that complicates the causation inquiry.

"The [exposure-only] plaintiffs especially share littlein common, either with each other or with the presently

injured class members. It is unclear whether they willcontract asbestos-related disease and, if so, what disease
each will suffer. They will also incur different medicalexpenses because their monitoring and treatment will
depend on singular circumstances and individual medicalhistories."

Id., at 626.

Differences in state law, the Court of Appeals observed, com-pound these disparities. See

id., at 627 (citing Phillips
Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, 472 U. S. 797, 823 (1985)).

No settlement class called to our attention is as sprawling
as this one. Cf. In re Asbestos Litigation, 90 F. 3d, at 976,
n. 8 ("We would likely agree with the Third Circuit that a
class action requesting individual damages for members of a
global class of asbestos claimants would not satisfy [Rule 23]
requirements due to the huge number of individuals and

521US2 Unit: $U88 [11-23-99 18:43:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
their varying medical expenses, smoking histories, and fam-ily situations."). Predominance is a test readily met in certain cases alleging consumer or securities fraud or violationsof the antitrust laws. See Adv. Comm. Notes, 28 U. S. C.
App., p. 697; see also supra, at 615, 616. Even mass tortcases arising from a common cause or disaster may, depending upon the circumstances, satisfy the predominance re-quirement. The Advisory Committee for the 1966 revision
of Rule 23, it is true, noted that "mass accident" cases arelikely to present "significant questions, not only of damages
but of liability and defenses of liability, . . . affecting theindividuals in different ways." Adv. Comm. Notes, 28
U. S. C. App., p. 697. And the Committee advised that suchcases are "ordinarily not appropriate" for class treatment.
Ibid. But the text of the Rule does not categorically ex-clude mass tort cases from class certification, and District
Courts, since the late 1970's, have been certifying such casesin increasing number. See Resnik, From "Cases" to "Litigation," 54 Law & Contemp. Prob. 5, 17-19 (Summer 1991) (de-scribing trend). The Committee's warning, however, continues to call for caution when individual stakes are high anddisparities among class members great. As the Third Circuit's opinion makes plain, the certification in this case doesnot follow the counsel of caution. That certification cannot
be upheld, for it rests on a conception of Rule 23(b)(3)'s pre-dominance requirement irreconcilable with the Rule's design.

B
Nor can the class approved by the District Court satisfyRule 23(a)(4)'s requirement that the named parties "will

fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class."The adequacy inquiry under Rule 23(a)(4) serves to uncover
conflicts of interest between named parties and the classthey seek to represent. See General Telephone Co. of
Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U. S. 147, 157-158, n. 13 (1982)."[A] class representative must be part of the class and `pos521US2 Unit: $U88 [11-23-99 18:43:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN

sess the same interest and suffer the same injury' as theclass members." East Tex. Motor Freight System, Inc. v.

Rodriguez, 431 U. S. 395, 403 (1977) (quoting Schlesinger v.Reservists Comm. to Stop the War, 418 U. S. 208, 216
(1974)).20As the Third Circuit pointed out, named parties with diverse medical conditions sought to act on behalf of a singlegiant class rather than on behalf of discrete subclasses. In
significant respects, the interests of those within the singleclass are not aligned. Most saliently, for the currently injured, the critical goal is generous immediate payments.That goal tugs against the interest of exposure-only plaintiffs
in ensuring an ample, inflation-protected fund for the future.Cf.

General Telephone Co. of Northwest v. EEOC, 446 U. S.318, 331 (1980) ("In employment discrimination litigation,

conflicts might arise, for example, between employees and
applicants who were denied employment and who will, ifgranted relief, compete with employees for fringe benefits

or seniority. Under Rule 23, the same plaintiff could notrepresent these classes.").

The disparity between the currently injured and
exposure-only categories of plaintiffs, and the diversitywithin each category are not made insignificant by the District Court's finding that petitioners' assets suffice to payclaims under the settlement. See 157 F. R. D., at 291. Al20 The adequacy-of-representation requirement "tend[s] to merge" with
the commonality and typicality criteria of Rule 23(a), which "serve as
guideposts for determining whether . . . maintenance of a class action is
economical and whether the named plaintiff's claim and the class claims
are so interrelated that the interests of the class members will be fairly
and adequately protected in their absence." General Telephone Co. of
Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U. S. 147, 157, n. 13 (1982). The adequacy heading
also factors in competency and conflicts of class counsel. See id., at 157-
158, n. 13. Like the Third Circuit, we decline to address adequacy-ofcounsel issues discretely in light of our conclusions that common questions
of law or fact do not predominate and that the named plaintiffs cannot
adequately represent the interests of this enormous class.

Opinion of the Court
though this is not a "limited fund" case certified under Rule23(b)(1)(B), the terms of the settlement reflect essential

allocation decisions designed to confine compensation andto limit defendants' liability. For example, as earlier described, see supra, at 604-605, the settlement includes no
adjustment for inflation; only a few claimants per year canopt out at the back end; and loss-of-consortium claims are

extinguished with no compensation.The settling parties, in sum, achieved a global compromise
with no structural assurance of fair and adequate representa-tion for the diverse groups and individuals affected. Although the named parties alleged a range of complaints, eachserved generally as representative for the whole, not for a
separate constituency. In another asbestos class action, the
Second Circuit spoke precisely to this point:

"[W]here differences among members of a class are suchthat subclasses must be established, we know of no authority that permits a court to approve a settlement
without creating subclasses on the basis of consents bymembers of a unitary class, some of whom happen to be

members of the distinct subgroups. The class repre-sentatives may well have thought that the Settlement
serves the aggregate interests of the entire class. Butthe adversity among subgroups requires that the members of each subgroup cannot be bound to a settlementexcept by consents given by those who understand that
their role is to represent solely the members of their
respective subgroups." In re Joint Eastern and Southern Dist. Asbestos Litigation, 982 F. 2d 721, 742-743
(1992), modified on reh'g sub nom. In re Findley, 993
F. 2d 7 (1993).

The Third Circuit found no assurance here--either in the
terms of the settlement or in the structure of the negotiations--that the named plaintiffs operated under a proper understanding of their representational responsibilities. See

83 F. 3d, at 630-631. That assessment, we conclude, is onthe mark.

C
Impediments to the provision of adequate notice, the Third
Circuit emphasized, rendered highly problematic any endeavor to tie to a settlement class persons with no perceptible asbestos-related disease at the time of the settlement.
Id., at 633; cf. In re Asbestos Litigation, 90 F. 3d, at 999-1000
(Smith, J., dissenting). Many persons in the exposure-only
category, the Court of Appeals stressed, may not even know
of their exposure, or realize the extent of the harm they may
incur. Even if they fully appreciate the significance of class
notice, those without current afflictions may not have the
information or foresight needed to decide, intelligently,
whether to stay in or opt out.

Family members of asbestos-exposed individuals may
themselves fall prey to disease or may ultimately have ripe
claims for loss of consortium. Yet large numbers of people
in this category--future spouses and children of asbestos victims--could not be alerted to their class membership. And
current spouses and children of the occupationally exposed
may know nothing of that exposure.

Because we have concluded that the class in this case cannot satisfy the requirements of common issue predominance
and adequacy of representation, we need not rule, definitively, on the notice given here. In accord with the Third
Circuit, however, see 83 F. 3d, at 633-634, we recognize the
gravity of the question whether class action notice sufficient
under the Constitution and Rule 23 could ever be given to
legions so unselfconscious and amorphous.

The argument is sensibly made that a nationwide administrative claims processing regime would provide the most secure, fair, and efficient means of compensating victims of as521US2 Unit: $U88 [11-23-99 18:43:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN

bestos exposure.21 Congress, however, has not adopted sucha solution. And Rule 23, which must be interpreted with

fidelity to the Rules Enabling Act and applied with the inter-ests of absent class members in close view, cannot carry the
large load CCR, class counsel, and the District Court heapedupon it. As this case exemplifies, the rulemakers' prescriptions for class actions may be endangered by "those who em-brace [Rule 23] too enthusiastically just as [they are by]
those who approach [the Rule] with distaste." C. Wright,Law of Federal Courts 508 (5th ed. 1994); cf. 83 F. 3d, at
634 (suggesting resort to less bold aggregation techniques,including more narrowly defined class certifications).

For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court ofAppeals for the Third Circuit is

Affirmed.
Justice O'Connor took no part in the consideration ordecision of this case.

Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Stevens joins,concurring in part and dissenting in part.
Although I agree with the Court's basic holding that "[s]et-tlement is relevant to a class certification," ante, at 619, I find
several problems in its approach that lead me to a differentconclusion. First, I believe that the need for settlement in
this mass tort case, with hundreds of thousands of lawsuits,is greater than the Court's opinion suggests. Second, I
would give more weight than would the majority tosettlement-related issues for purposes of determining
whether common issues predominate. Third, I am uncertainabout the Court's determination of adequacy of representa21 The opinion dissenting in part is a forceful statement of that
argument.

tion, and do not believe it appropriate for this Court tosecond-guess the District Court on the matter without first

having the Court of Appeals consider it. Fourth, I am un-certain about the tenor of an opinion that seems to suggest
the settlement is unfair. And fifth, in the absence of further
review by the Court of Appeals, I cannot accept the majori-ty's suggestions that "notice" is inadequate.

These difficulties flow from the majority's review of whatare highly fact-based, complex, and difficult matters, matters
that are inappropriate for initial review before this Court.The law gives broad leeway to district courts in making class
certification decisions, and their judgments are to be reviewed by the court of appeals only for abuse of discretion.
See Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U. S. 682, 703 (1979). Indeed, the District Court's certification decision rests upon
more than 300 findings of fact reached after five weeks of
comprehensive hearings. Accordingly, I do not believe that
we should in effect set aside the findings of the District
Court. That court is far more familiar with the issues and
litigants than is a court of appeals or are we, and therefore
has "broad power and discretion . . . with respect to matters
involving the certification" of class actions. Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U. S. 330, 345 (1979); cf. Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U. S. 384, 402 (1990) (district court better
situated to make fact-dependent legal determinations in
Rule 11 context).

I do not believe that we can rely upon the Court of Appeals' review of the District Court record, for that review,
and its ultimate conclusions, are infected by a legal error.
E. g., Georgine v. Amchem Products, Inc., 83 F. 3d 610, 626
(CA3 1996) (holding that "considered as a litigation class,"
the class cannot meet Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23's
requirements (emphasis added)). There is no evidence that
the Court of Appeals at any point considered the settlement
as something that would help the class meet Rule 23. I find,
moreover, the fact-related issues presented here sufficiently

close to warrant further detailed appellate court review
under the correct legal standard. Cf. Reno v. Bossier Parish School Bd., 520 U. S. 471, 486 (1997). And I shall briefly
explain why this is so.

I

First, I believe the majority understates the importance
of settlement in this case. Between 13 and 21 million workers have been exposed to asbestos in the workplace--over
the past 40 or 50 years--but the most severe instances of
such exposure probably occurred three or four decades ago.
See Report of The Judicial Conference Ad Hoc Committee on
Asbestos Litigation, pp. 6-7 (Mar. 1991) (Judicial Conference
Report); App. 781-782, 801; B. Castleman, Asbestos: Medical
and Legal Aspects 787-788 (4th ed. 1996). This exposure
has led to several hundred thousand lawsuits, about 15% of
which involved claims for cancer and about 30% for asbestosis. See In re Joint Eastern and Southern Dist. Asbestos
Litigation, 129 B. R. 710, 936-937 (E and SD N. Y. 1991).
About half of the suits have involved claims for pleural thickening and plaques--the harmfulness of which is apparently
controversial. (One expert below testified that they "don't
transform into cancer" and are not "predictor[s] of future disease," App. 781.) Some of those who suffer from the most
serious injuries, however, have received little or no compensation. In re School Asbestos Litigation, 789 F. 2d 996, 1000
(CA3 1986); see also Edley & Weiler, Asbestos: A MultiBillion-Dollar Crisis, 30 Harv. J. Legis. 383, 384, 393 (1993)
("[U]p to one-half of asbestos claims are now being filed by
people who have little or no physical impairment. Many of
these claims produce substantial payments (and substantial
costs) even though the individual litigants will never become
impaired"). These lawsuits have taken up more than 6% of
all federal civil filings in one recent year, and are subject
to a delay that is twice that of other civil suits. Judicial
Conference Report 7, 10-11.

632 AMCHEM PRODUCTS, INC. v. WINDSOR

Opinion of Breyer, J.
Delays, high costs, and a random pattern of noncompensa-tion led the Judicial Conference Ad Hoc Committee on Asbestos Litigation to transfer all federal asbestos personal-injury cases to the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in an
effort to bring about a fair and comprehensive settlement.
It is worth considering a few of the Committee's comments.See Judicial Conference Report 2 (" `Decisions concerning

thousands of deaths, millions of injuries, and billions of dol-lars are entangled in a litigation system whose strengths
have increasingly been overshadowed by its weaknesses.'The ensuing five years have seen the picture worsen:
increased filings, larger backlogs, higher costs, more bankruptcies and poorer prospects that judgments--if ever obtained--can be collected" (quoting Rand Corporation Institute for Civil Justice)); id., at 13 ("The transaction costs
associated with asbestos litigation are an unconscionable
burden on the victims of asbestos disease." "[O]f each asbestos litigation dollar, 61 cents is consumed in transaction
costs . . . . Only 39 cents were paid to the asbestos victims"
(citing Rand finding)); id., at 12 ("Delays also can increase
transaction costs, especially the attorneys' fees paid by defendants at hourly rates. These costs reduce either the insurance fund or the company's assets, thereby reducing the funds
available to pay pending and future claimants. By the end
of the trial phase in [one case], at least seven defendants had
declared bankruptcy (as a result of asbestos claims generally")); see also J. Weinstein, Individual Justice in Mass Tort
Litigation 155 (1995); Edley & Weiler, supra, at 389-395.

Although the transfer of the federal asbestos cases did not
produce a general settlement, it was intertwined with and
led to a lengthy year-long negotiation between the cochairs
of the Plaintiff 's Multi-District Litigation Steering Committee (elected by the Plaintiff 's Committee Members and approved by the District Court) and the 20 asbestos defendants
who are before us here. Georgine v. Amchem Products,
Inc., 157 F. R. D. 246, 266-267 (ED Pa. 1994); App. 660-662.

633Cite as: 521 U. S. 591 (1997)
Opinion of Breyer, J.
These "protracted and vigorous" negotiations led to the pres-ent partial settlement, which will pay an estimated $1.3 billion and compensate perhaps 100,000 class members in thefirst 10 years. 157 F. R. D., at 268, 287. "The negotiations
included a substantial exchange of information" between
class counsel and the 20 defendant companies, including "con-fidential data" showing the defendants' historical settlement

averages, numbers of claims filed and settled, and insuranceresources.

Id., at 267. "Virtually no provision" of the settlement "was not the subject of significant negotiation," andthe settlement terms "changed substantially" during the negotiations. Ibid. In the end, the negotiations produced a
settlement that, the District Court determined based on its
detailed review of the process, was "the result of armslength adversarial negotiations by extraordinarily competent
and experienced attorneys." Id., at 335.

The District Court, when approving the settlement, concluded that it improved the plaintiffs' chances of compensation and reduced total legal fees and other transaction costs
by a significant amount. Under the previous system, according to the court, "[t]he sickest of victims often go uncompensated for years while valuable funds go to others who
remain unimpaired by their mild asbestos disease." Ibid.
The court believed the settlement would create a compensation system that would make more money available for plaintiffs who later develop serious illnesses.

I mention this matter because it suggests that the settlement before us is unusual in terms of its importance, both to
many potential plaintiffs and to defendants, and with respect
to the time, effort, and expenditure that it reflects. All of
which leads me to be reluctant to set aside the District
Court's findings without more assurance than I have that
they are wrong. I cannot obtain that assurance through
comprehensive review of the record because that is properly
the job of the Court of Appeals and that court, understandably, but as we now hold, mistakenly, believed that settle521US2 Unit: $U88 [11-23-99 18:43:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of Breyer, J.
ment was not a relevant (and, as I would say, important)consideration.

Second, the majority, in reviewing the District Court's de-termination that common "issues of fact and law predominate," says that the predominance "inquiry trains on the
legal or factual questions that qualify each class member'scase as a genuine controversy, questions that preexist any

settlement." Ante, at 623 (footnote omitted). I find it dif-ficult to interpret this sentence in a way that could lead me
to the majority's conclusion. If the majority means thatthese presettlement questions are what matters, then how
does it reconcile its statement with its basic conclusion that
"settlement is relevant" to class certification, or with the numerous lower court authority that says that settlement is
not only relevant, but important? See, e. g., In re A. H. Robins Co., 880 F. 2d 709, 740 (CA4), cert. denied sub nom. Anderson v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 493 U. S. 959 (1989);
In re Beef Industry Antitrust Litigation, 607 F. 2d 167, 177-
178 (CA5 1979), cert. denied sub nom. Iowa Beef Processors,
Inc. v. Meat Price Investigators Assn., 452 U. S. 905 (1981);
2 H. Newberg & A. Conte, Newberg on Class Actions $ 11.27,
pp. 11-54 to 11-55 (3d ed. 1992).

Nor do I understand how one could decide whether common questions "predominate" in the abstract--without looking at what is likely to be at issue in the proceedings that
will ensue, namely, the settlement. Every group of human
beings, after all, has some features in common, and some that
differ. How can a court make a contextual judgment of the
sort that Rule 23 requires without looking to what proceedings will follow? Such guideposts help it decide whether, in
light of common concerns and differences, certification will
achieve Rule 23's basic objective--"economies of time, effort,
and expense." Advisory Committee's Notes on Fed. Rule
Civ. Proc. 23(b)(3), 28 U. S. C. App., p. 697. As this Court
has previously observed, "sometimes it may be necessary for
the court to probe behind the pleadings before coming to

rest on the certification question." General Telephone Co.
of Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U. S. 147, 160 (1982); see also
7B C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane, Federal Practice andProcedure $ 1785, p. 107, and n. 34 (1986). I am not saying

that the "settlement counts only one way." Ante, at 620,
n. 16. Rather, the settlement may simply "add a great dealof information to the court's inquiry and will often expose

diverging interests or common issues that were not evidentor clear from the complaint" and courts "can and should" look
to it to enhance the "ability . . . to make informed certifica-tion decisions."

In re Asbestos Litigation, 90 F. 3d 963, 975
(CA5 1996).The majority may mean that the District Court gave too

much weight to the settlement. But I am not certain how
it can reach that conclusion. It cannot rely upon the Courtof Appeals, for that court gave no positive weight at all to

the settlement. Nor can it say that the District Court reliedsolely on "a common interest in a fair compromise,"

ante, at
623, for the District Court did not do so. Rather, it foundthe settlement relevant because it explained the importance

of the class plaintiffs' common features and common inter-ests. The court found predominance in part because:

"The members of the class have all been exposed to as-bestos products supplied by the defendants and all share
an interest in receiving prompt and fair compensationfor their claims, while minimizing the risks and transaction costs inherent in the asbestos litigation process as
it occurs presently in the tort system." 157 F. R. D.,at 316.

The settlement is relevant because it means that these common features and interests are likely to be important in the
proceeding that would ensue--a proceeding that would focus
primarily upon whether or not the proposed settlement fairly
and properly satisfied the interests class members had in
common. That is to say, the settlement underscored the im521US2 Unit: $U88 [11-23-99 18:43:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN
636 AMCHEM PRODUCTS, INC. v. WINDSOR

Opinion of Breyer, J.
portance of (a) the common fact of exposure, (b) the common
interest in receiving some compensation for certain rather
than running a strong risk of no compensation, and (c) the
common interest in avoiding large legal fees, other transaction costs, and delays. Ibid.

Of course, as the majority points out, there are also important differences among class members. Different plaintiffs
were exposed to different products for different times; each
has a distinct medical history and a different history of smoking; and many cases arise under the laws of different States.
The relevant question, however, is how much these differences matter in respect to the legal proceedings that lie
ahead. Many, if not all, toxic tort class actions involve plaintiffs with such differences. And the differences in state law
are of diminished importance in respect to a proposed settlement in which the defendants have waived all defenses and
agreed to compensate all those who were injured. Id., at
292.

These differences might warrant subclasses, though subclasses can have problems of their own. "There can be a
cost in creating more distinct subgroups, each with its own
representation. . . . [T]he more subclasses created, the more
severe conflicts bubble to the surface and inhibit settlement.
. . . The resources of defendants and, ultimately, the community must not be exhausted by protracted litigation."
Weinstein, Individual Justice in Mass Tort Litigation, at 66.
Or these differences may be too serious to permit an effort
at group settlement. This kind of determination, as I have
said, is one that the law commits to the discretion of the
district court--reviewable for abuse of discretion by a court
of appeals. I believe that we are far too distant from the
litigation itself to reweigh the fact-specific Rule 23 determinations and to find them erroneous without the benefit of
the Court of Appeals first having restudied the matter with
today's legal standard in mind.

637Cite as: 521 U. S. 591 (1997)
Opinion of Breyer, J.
Third, the majority concludes that the "representativeparties" will not "fairly and adequately protect the interests

of the class." Rule 23(a)(4). It finds a serious conflict be-tween plaintiffs who are now injured and those who may be
injured in the future because "for the currently injured, the
critical goal is generous immediate payments," a goal that"tugs against the interest of exposure-only plaintiffs in ensuring an ample, inflation-protected fund for the future."
Ante, at 626.

I agree that there is a serious problem, but it is a problemthat often exists in toxic tort cases. See Weinstein,

supra,
at 64 (noting that conflict "between present and future claimants" "is almost always present in some form in mass tort
cases because long latency periods are needed to discover
injuries"); see also Judicial Conference Report 34-35 ("Because many of the defendants in these cases have limited
assets that may be called upon to satisfy the judgments obtained under current common tort rules and remedies, there
is a `real and present danger that the available assets will be
exhausted before those later victims can seek compensation
to which they are entitled' " (citation omitted)). And it is a
problem that potentially exists whenever a single defendant
injures several plaintiffs, for a settling plaintiff leaves fewer
assets available for the others. With class actions, at least,
plaintiffs have the consolation that a district court, thoroughly familiar with the facts, is charged with the responsibility of ensuring that the interests of no class members
are sacrificed.

But this Court cannot easily safeguard such interests
through review of a cold record. "What constitutes adequate representation is a question of fact that depends on the
circumstances of each case." 7A Wright, Miller, & Kane,
Federal Practice and Procedure $ 1765, at 271. That is particularly so when, as here, there is an unusual baseline,
namely, the " `real and present danger' " described by the
Judicial Conference Report above. The majority's use of the

521US2 Unit: $U88 [11-23-99 18:43:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN
638 AMCHEM PRODUCTS, INC. v. WINDSOR

Opinion of Breyer, J.
lack of an inflation adjustment as evidence of inadequacy ofrepresentation for future plaintiffs

, ante, at 626-627, is one
example of this difficulty. An inflation adjustment might notbe as valuable as the majority assumes if most plaintiffs are

old and not worried about receiving compensation decades
from now. There are, of course, strong arguments as toits value. But that disagreement is one that this Court is

poorly situated to resolve.Further, certain details of the settlement that are not discussed in the majority opinion suggest that the settlementmay be of greater benefit to future plaintiffs than the majority suggests. The District Court concluded that future
plaintiffs receive a "significant value" from the settlement
due to a variety of its items that benefit future plaintiffs,
such as: (1) tolling the statute of limitations so that class
members "will no longer be forced to file premature lawsuits
or risk their claims being time-barred"; (2) waiver of defenses to liability; (3) payment of claims, if and when members become sick, pursuant to the settlement's compensation
standards, which avoids "the uncertainties, long delays and
high transaction costs [including attorney's fees] of the tort
system"; (4) "some assurance that there will be funds available if and when they get sick," based on the finding that
each defendant "has shown an ability to fund the payment of
all qualifying claims" under the settlement; and (5) the right
to additional compensation if cancer develops (many settlements for plaintiffs with noncancerous conditions bar such
additional claims). 157 F. R. D., at 292. For these reasons,
and others, the District Court found that the distinction between present and future plaintiffs was "illusory." Id., at
317-318.

I do not know whether or not the benefits are more or less
valuable than an inflation adjustment. But I can certainly
recognize an argument that they are. (To choose one more
brief illustration, the majority chastises the settlement for
extinguishing loss-of-consortium claims, ante, at 627, 628, but

521US2 Unit: $U88 [11-23-99 18:43:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN

639Cite as: 521 U. S. 591 (1997)
Opinion of Breyer, J.
does not note that, as the District Court found, the "defend-ants' historical [settlement] averages, upon which the compensation values are based, include payments for loss of con-sortium claims, and, accordingly, the Compensation Schedule
is not unfair for this ascribed reason," 157 F. R. D., at 278.)
The difficulties inherent in both knowing and understandingthe vast number of relevant individual fact-based determinations here counsel heavily in favor of deference to districtcourt decisionmaking in Rule 23 decisions. Or, at the least,
making certain that appellate court review has taken placewith the correct standard in mind.

Fourth, I am more agnostic than is the majority about the
basic fairness of the settlement. Ante, at 625-628. The
District Court's conclusions rested upon complicated factual
findings that are not easily cast aside. It is helpful to consider some of them, such as its determination that the settlement provided "fair compensation . . . while reducing the
delays and transaction costs endemic to the asbestos litigation process" and that "the proposed class action settlement
is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient resolution of the asbestos-related personal injury
claims of class members." 157 F. R. D., at 316 (citation omitted); see also id., at 335 ("The inadequate tort system has
demonstrated that the lawyers are well paid for their services but the victims are not receiving speedy and reasonably
inexpensive resolution of their claims. Rather, the victims'
recoveries are delayed, excessively reduced by transaction
costs and relegated to the impersonal group trials and mass
consolidations. The sickest of victims often go uncompensated for years while valuable funds go to others who remain
unimpaired by their mild asbestos disease. Indeed, these
unimpaired victims have, in many states, been forced to assert their claims prematurely or risk giving up all rights to
future compensation for any future lung cancer or mesothelioma. The plan which this Court approves today will correct
that unfair result for the class members and the . . . defend521US2 Unit: $U88 [11-23-99 18:43:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ants"); id., at 279, 280 (settlement "will result in less delayfor asbestos claimants than that experienced in the present

tort system" and will "result in the CCR defendants payingmore claims at a faster rate, than they have ever paid before"); id., at 292; Edley & Weiler, 30 Harv. J. Legis., at 405,
407 (finding that "[t]here are several reasons to believe thatthis settlement secures important gains for both sides" and

that they "firmly endorse the fairness and adequacy of thissettlement"). Indeed, the settlement has been endorsed as
fair and reasonable by the AFL-CIO (and its Building andConstruction Trades Department), which represents a " `substantial percentage' " of class members, 157 F. R. D., at 325,
and which has a role in monitoring implementation of the
settlement, id., at 285. I do not intend to pass judgment
upon the settlement's fairness, but I do believe that these
matters would have to be explored in far greater depth before I could reach a conclusion about fairness. And that
task, as I have said, is one for the Court of Appeals.

Finally, I believe it is up to the District Court, rather than
this Court, to review the legal sufficiency of notice to members of the class. The District Court found that the plan to
provide notice was implemented at a cost of millions of dollars and included hundreds of thousands of individual notices,
a wide-ranging television and print campaign, and significant
additional efforts by 35 international and national unions to
notify their members. Id., at 312-313, 336. Every notice
emphasized that an individual did not currently have to be
sick to be a class member. And in the end, the District
Court was "confident" that Rule 23 and due process requirements were satisfied because, as a result of this "extensive
and expensive notice procedure," "over six million" individuals "received actual notice materials," and "millions more"
were reached by the media campaign. Id., at 312, 333, 336.
Although the majority, in principle, is reviewing a Court of
Appeals' conclusion, it seems to me that its opinion might call
into question the fact-related determinations of the District

521US2 Unit: $U88 [11-23-99 18:43:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Court. Ante, at 628. To the extent that it does so, I dis-agree, for such findings cannot be so quickly disregarded.

And I do not think that our precedents permit this Court todo so. See Reiter, 442 U. S., at 345; Yamasaki, 442 U. S.,
at 703. II

The issues in this case are complicated and difficult. TheDistrict Court might have been correct. Or not. Subclasses might be appropriate. Or not. I cannot tell. AndI do not believe that this Court should be in the business of
trying to make these fact-based determinations. That is ajob suited to the district courts in the first instance, and the
courts of appeals on review. But there is no reason in thiscase to believe that the Court of Appeals conducted its prior
review with an understanding that the settlement could haveconstituted a reasonably strong factor in favor of class certification. For this reason, I would provide the courts belowwith an opportunity to analyze the factual questions involved
in certification by vacating the judgment, and remanding thecase for further proceedings.

Syllabus

UNITED STATES v. O'HAGAN
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eighth circuit

No. 96-842. Argued April 16, 1997--Decided June 25, 1997
After Grand Metropolitan PLC (Grand Met) retained the law firm of Dorsey & Whitney to represent it regarding a potential tender offer for the
Pillsbury Company's common stock, respondent O'Hagan, a Dorsey &
Whitney partner who did no work on the representation, began purchasing call options for Pillsbury stock, as well as shares of the stock. Following Dorsey & Whitney's withdrawal from the representation, Grand
Met publicly announced its tender offer, the price of Pillsbury stock rose
dramatically, and O'Hagan sold his call options and stock at a profit of
more than $4.3 million. A Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
investigation culminated in a 57-count indictment alleging, inter alia,
that O'Hagan defrauded his law firm and its client, Grand Met, by misappropriating for his own trading purposes material, nonpublic information regarding the tender offer. The indictment charged O'Hagan with
securities fraud in violation of $ 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 and SEC Rule 10b-5, with fraudulent trading in connection with a
tender offer in violation of $ 14(e) of the Exchange Act and SEC Rule
14e-3(a), and with violations of the federal mail fraud and money laundering statutes. A jury convicted O'Hagan on all counts, and he was
sentenced to prison. The Eighth Circuit reversed all of the convictions,
holding that $ 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 liability may not be grounded on the
"misappropriation theory" of securities fraud on which the prosecution
relied; that Rule 14e-3(a) exceeds the SEC's $ 14(e) rulemaking authority because the Rule contains no breach of fiduciary duty requirement;
and that the mail fraud and money laundering convictions rested on
violations of the securities laws, so could not stand once the securities

Held:

1. A person who trades in securities for personal profit, using confidential information misappropriated in breach of a fiduciary duty to
the source of the information, may be held liable for violating $ 10(b)

(a) Section 10(b) proscribes (1) using any "deceptive device" (2) "in
connection with the purchase or sale of any security," in contravention
of SEC rules. The Commission adopted Rule 10b-5 pursuant to its

tend beyond conduct encompassed by $ 10(b)'s prohibition. See, e. g.,
Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U. S. 185, 214. Under the "traditional" or "classical theory" of insider trading liability, a violation of

$ 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 occurs when a corporate insider trades in his
corporation's securities on the basis of material, confidential information
he has obtained by reason of his position. Such trading qualifies as a
"deceptive device" because there is a relationship of trust and confidence
between the corporation's shareholders and the insider that gives rise
to a duty to disclose or abstain from trading. Chiarella v. United
States, 445 U. S. 222, 228-229. Under the complementary "misappropriation theory" urged by the Government here, a corporate "outsider"
violates $ 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 when he misappropriates confidential
information for securities trading purposes, in breach of a fiduciary duty
owed to the source of the information, rather than to the persons with
whom he trades. Pp. 650-653.

(b) Misappropriation, as just defined, is the proper subject of a

$ 10(b) charge because it meets the statutory requirement that there
be "deceptive" conduct "in connection with" a securities transaction.
First, misappropriators deal in deception: A fiduciary who pretends
loyalty to the principal while secretly converting the principal's information for personal gain dupes or defrauds the principal. A company's confidential information qualifies as property to which the company has a right of exclusive use; the undisclosed misappropriation of
such information constitutes fraud akin to embezzlement. Cf. Carpenter v. United States, 484 U. S. 19, 25-27. Deception through nondisclosure is central to liability under the misappropriation theory. The theory is thus consistent with Santa Fe Industries, Inc. v. Green, 430 U. S.
462, 473-476, a decision underscoring that $ 10(b) is not an all-purpose
breach of fiduciary duty ban, but trains on conduct that is manipulative
or deceptive. Conversely, full disclosure forecloses liability: Because
the deception essential to the theory involves feigning fidelity to the
information's source, if the fiduciary discloses to the source that he plans
to trade on the information, there is no "deceptive device" and thus no

$ 10(b) violation. Second, $ 10(b)'s requirement that the misappropriator's deceptive use of information be "in connection with the purchase
or sale of [a] security" is satisfied by the misappropriation theory because the fiduciary's fraud is consummated not when he obtains the confidential information, but when, without disclosure to his principal, he
uses the information in purchasing or selling securities. The transaction and the breach of duty coincide, even though the person or entity
defrauded is not the other party to the trade, but is, instead, the source
of the nonpublic information. Because undisclosed trading on the basis
of misappropriated, nonpublic information both deceives the source of

Syllabus
the information and harms members of the investing public, the misappropriation theory is tuned to an animating purpose of the Exchange
Act: to ensure honest markets, thereby promoting investor confidence.
It would make scant sense to hold a lawyer-turned-trader like O'Hagan
a $ 10(b) violator if he works for a law firm representing the target of a
tender offer, but not if he works for a firm representing the bidder.
The statute's text requires no such result. Pp. 653-659.

(c) The Eighth Circuit erred in holding that the misappropriation
theory is inconsistent with $ 10(b). First, that court understood the
theory to require neither misrepresentation nor nondisclosure; as this
Court explains, however, deceptive nondisclosure is essential to $ 10(b)
liability under the theory. Concretely, it was O'Hagan's failure to disclose his personal trading to Grand Met and Dorsey, in breach of his
duty to do so, that made his conduct "deceptive" under $ 10(b). Second,
the Eighth Circuit misread this Court's precedents when it ruled that,
under Chiarella v. United States, 445 U. S. 222, 230, 232, 233; Dirks v.
SEC, 463 U. S. 646, 655; and Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First
Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A., 511 U. S. 164, 191, only a breach of a
duty to parties to a securities transaction, or, at the most, to other market participants such as investors, is sufficient to give rise to $ 10(b)
liability. Chiarella, 445 U. S., at 238, 239, 240-243, 245, expressly left
open the question of the misappropriation theory's validity, and Dirks,
463 U. S., at 665, 666-667, also left room for application of the misappropriation theory in cases such as this one. Central Bank's discussion
concerned only private civil litigation under $ 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, not
criminal liability. Pp. 660-665.

(d) Vital to this Court's decision that criminal liability may be sustained under the misappropriation theory is the Exchange Act's requirement that the Government prove that a person "willfully" violated Rule
10b-5 in order to establish a criminal violation, and the Act's provision
that a defendant may not be imprisoned for such a violation if he proves
that he had no knowledge of the Rule. The requirement of culpable
intent weakens O'Hagan's charge that the misappropriation theory is
too indefinite to permit the imposition of criminal liability. See Boyce
Motor Lines, Inc. v. United States, 342 U. S. 337, 342. The Eighth Circuit may address on remand O'Hagan's other challenges to his $ 10(b)
and Rule 10b-5 convictions. Pp. 665-666.

2. As relevant to this case, the SEC did not exceed its rulemaking
authority under $ 14(e) by adopting Rule 14e-3(a) without requiring a
showing that the trading at issue entailed a breach of fiduciary duty.
Section 14(e) prohibits "fraudulent . . . acts . . . in connection with any
tender offer," and authorizes the SEC to "define, and prescribe means
reasonably designed to prevent, such acts." Adopted under that statu521US2 Unit: $U89 [11-20-99 15:31:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Syllabus
tory authorization, Rule 14e-3(a) forbids any person to trade on the
basis of material, nonpublic information that concerns a tender offer and
that the person knows or should know has been acquired from an insider
of the offeror or issuer, or someone working on their behalf, unless
within a reasonable time before any purchase or sale such information
and its source are publicly disclosed. Rule 14e-3(a) imposes a duty to
disclose or abstain from trading whether or not the trader owes a fiduciary duty to respect the confidentiality of the information. In invalidating Rule 14e-3(a), the Eighth Circuit reasoned, inter alia, that

$ 14(e) empowers the SEC to identify and regulate "fraudulent" acts,
but not to create its own definition of "fraud"; that, under Schreiber v.
Burlington Northern, Inc., 472 U. S. 1, 7-8, $ 10(b) interpretations guide
construction of $ 14(e); and that, under Chiarella, supra, at 228, a failure
to disclose information can be "fraudulent" for $ 10(b) purposes only
when there is a duty to speak arising out of a fiduciary or similar relationship of trust and confidence. This Court need not resolve whether
the SEC's $ 14(e) fraud-defining authority is broader than its like authority under $ 10(b), for Rule 14e-3(a), as applied to cases of this genre,
qualifies under $ 14(e) as a "means reasonably designed to prevent"
fraudulent trading on material, nonpublic information in the tender offer
context. A prophylactic measure properly encompasses more than the
core activity prohibited. Under $ 14(e), the SEC may prohibit acts not
themselves fraudulent under the common law or $ 10(b), if the prohibition is reasonably designed to prevent acts and practices that are fraudulent. See Schreiber, supra, at 11, n. 11. This Court must accord the
SEC's assessment in that regard controlling weight unless it is arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute. Chevron
U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837,
844. In this case, the SEC's assessment is none of these. It is a fair
assumption that trading on the basis of material, nonpublic information
will often involve a breach of a duty of confidentiality to the bidder or
target company or their representatives. The SEC, cognizant of proof
problems that could enable sophisticated traders to escape responsibility
for such trading, placed in Rule 14e-3(a) a "disclose or abstain from
trading" command that does not require specific proof of a breach of
fiduciary duty. Insofar as it serves to prevent the type of misappropriation charged against O'Hagan, the Rule is therefore a proper exercise
of the SEC's prophylactic power under $ 14(e). This Court declines to
consider in the first instance O'Hagan's alternate arguments that Rule
14e-3(a)'s prohibition of pre-offer trading conflicts with $ 14(e) and violates due process. The Eighth Circuit may address on remand any such
argument that O'Hagan has preserved. Pp. 666-677.

Opinion of the Court
Two prime questions are presented. The first relates to themisappropriation of material, nonpublic information for securities trading; the second concerns fraudulent practices inthe tender offer setting. In particular, we address and resolve these issues: (1) Is a person who trades in securitiesfor personal profit, using confidential information misappropriated in breach of a fiduciary duty to the source ofthe information, guilty of violating $ 10(b) and Rule 10b-5?
(2) Did the Commission exceed its rulemaking authority byadopting Rule 14e-3(a), which proscribes trading on undisclosed information in the tender offer setting, even in theabsence of a duty to disclose? Our answer to the first question is yes, and to the second question, viewed in the contextof this case, no.

I
Respondent James Herman O'Hagan was a partner in thelaw firm of Dorsey & Whitney in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

In July 1988, Grand Metropolitan PLC (Grand Met), a com-pany based in London, England, retained Dorsey & Whitney
as local counsel to represent Grand Met regarding a potentialtender offer for the common stock of the Pillsbury Company,
headquartered in Minneapolis. Both Grand Met and Dor-sey & Whitney took precautions to protect the confidentiality of Grand Met's tender offer plans. O'Hagan did no workon the Grand Met representation. Dorsey & Whitney withdrew from representing Grand Met on September 9, 1988.Less than a month later, on October 4, 1988, Grand Met publicly announced its tender offer for Pillsbury stock.On August 18, 1988, while Dorsey & Whitney was still
representing Grand Met, O'Hagan began purchasing calloptions for Pillsbury stock. Each option gave him the right
to purchase 100 shares of Pillsbury stock by a specified datein September 1988. Later in August and in September,
O'Hagan made additional purchases of Pillsbury call options.By the end of September, he owned 2,500 unexpired Pillsbury options, apparently more than any other individual in521US2 Unit: $U89 [11-20-99 15:31:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN

vestor. See App. 85, 148. O'Hagan also purchased, in Sep-tember 1988, some 5,000 shares of Pillsbury common stock,

at a price just under $39 per share. When Grand Met an-nounced its tender offer in October, the price of Pillsbury
stock rose to nearly $60 per share. O'Hagan then sold hisPillsbury call options and common stock, making a profit of
more than $4.3 million.The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC or Commission) initiated an investigation into O'Hagan's transac-tions, culminating in a 57-count indictment. The indictment
alleged that O'Hagan defrauded his law firm and its client,Grand Met, by using for his own trading purposes material,
nonpublic information regarding Grand Met's planned tenderoffer. Id., at 8.

1 According to the indictment, O'Hagan

used the profits he gained through this trading to concealhis previous embezzlement and conversion of unrelated client

trust funds. Id., at 10.2 O'Hagan was charged with 20counts of mail fraud, in violation of 18 U. S. C. $ 1341; 17
counts of securities fraud, in violation of $ 10(b) of the Securi-ties Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), 48 Stat. 891, 15
U. S. C. $ 78j(b), and SEC Rule 10b-5, 17 CFR $ 240.10b-5

1 As evidence that O'Hagan traded on the basis of nonpublic information
misappropriated from his law firm, the Government relied on a conversation between O'Hagan and the Dorsey & Whitney partner heading the
firm's Grand Met representation. That conversation allegedly took place
shortly before August 26, 1988. See Brief for United States 4. O'Hagan
urges that the Government's evidence does not show he traded on the
basis of nonpublic information. O'Hagan points to news reports on August 18 and 22, 1988, that Grand Met was interested in acquiring Pillsbury,
and to an earlier, August 12, 1988, news report that Grand Met had put
up its hotel chain for auction to raise funds for an acquisition. See Brief
for Respondent 4 (citing App. 73-74, 78-80). O'Hagan's challenge to the
sufficiency of the evidence remains open for consideration on remand.

2 O'Hagan was convicted of theft in state court, sentenced to 30 months'

imprisonment, and fined. See State v. O'Hagan, 474 N. W. 2d 613, 615,
623 (Minn. App. 1991). The Supreme Court of Minnesota disbarred
O'Hagan from the practice of law. See In re O'Hagan, 450 N. W. 2d 571
(1990).

Circuit reversed all of O'Hagan's convictions. 92 F. 3d 612(1996). Liability under $ 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, the Eighth
Circuit held, may not be grounded on the "misappropriationtheory" of securities fraud on which the prosecution relied.
Id., at 622. The Court of Appeals also held that Rule 14e-3(a)--which prohibits trading while in possession of material,
nonpublic information relating to a tender offer--exceeds theSEC's $ 14(e) rulemaking authority because the Rule contains no breach of fiduciary duty requirement. Id., at 627.The Eighth Circuit further concluded that O'Hagan's mail
fraud and money laundering convictions rested on violationsof the securities laws, and therefore could not stand once the
securities fraud convictions were reversed. Id., at 627-628.Judge Fagg, dissenting, stated that he would recognize and
enforce the misappropriation theory, and would hold that theSEC did not exceed its rulemaking authority when it
adopted Rule 14e-3(a) without requiring proof of a breach offiduciary duty.

Id., at 628.Decisions of the Courts of Appeals are in conflict on the

propriety of the misappropriation theory under $ 10(b) andRule 10b-5, see

infra this page and 650, and n. 3, and on thelegitimacy of Rule 14e-3(a) under $ 14(e), see infra, at 669-

the Fourth Circuit's lead, see United States v. Bryan, 58F. 3d 933, 943-959 (1995), the Eighth Circuit rejected the

misappropriation theory as a basis for $ 10(b) liability. Wehold, in accord with several other Courts of Appeals,

3 that

criminal liability under $ 10(b) may be predicated on the mis-appropriation theory.

4

A
In pertinent part, $ 10(b) of the Exchange Act provides:

"It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indi-rectly, by the use of any means or instrumentality of

interstate commerce or of the mails, or of any facility ofany national securities exchange--

. . . . .
"(b) To use or employ, in connection with the purchaseor sale of any security registered on a national securities

exchange or any security not so registered, any manipu-lative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the [Securities andExchange] Commission may prescribe as necessary or
appropriate in the public interest or for the protectionof investors." 15 U. S. C. $ 78j(b).

439, 453 (CA9 1990).

4 Twice before we have been presented with the question whether criminal liability for violation of $ 10(b) may be based on a misappropriation
theory. In Chiarella v. United States, 445 U. S. 222, 235-237 (1980), the
jury had received no misappropriation theory instructions, so we declined
to address the question. See infra, at 661. In Carpenter v. United
States, 484 U. S. 19, 24 (1987), the Court divided evenly on whether, under
the circumstances of that case, convictions resting on the misappropriation
theory should be affirmed. See Aldave, The Misappropriation Theory:
Carpenter and Its Aftermath, 49 Ohio St. L. J. 373, 375 (1988) (observing
that "Carpenter was, by any reckoning, an unusual case," for the information there misappropriated belonged not to a company preparing to engage
in securities transactions, e. g., a bidder in a corporate acquisition, but to
the Wall Street Journal).

Opinion of the Court
The statute thus proscribes (1) using any deceptive device(2) in connection with the purchase or sale of securities, in

contravention of rules prescribed by the Commission. Theprovision, as written, does not confine its coverage to deception of a purchaser or seller of securities, see United Statesv.

Newman, 664 F. 2d 12, 17 (CA2 1981); rather, the statutereaches any deceptive device used "in connection with the

purchase or sale of any security."Pursuant to its $ 10(b) rulemaking authority, the Commission has adopted Rule 10b-5, which, as relevant here,provides:

"It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indi-rectly, by the use of any means or instrumentality of
interstate commerce, or of the mails or of any facility ofany national securities exchange,

"(a) To employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud, [or]. . . . .

"(c) To engage in any act, practice, or course of busi-ness which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person,
"in connection with the purchase or sale of any security." 17 CFR $ 240.10b-5 (1996).

Liability under Rule 10b-5, our precedent indicates, does not
extend beyond conduct encompassed by $ 10(b)'s prohibition.See

Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U. S. 185, 214 (1976)
(scope of Rule 10b-5 cannot exceed power Congress grantedCommission under $ 10(b)); see also

Central Bank of Denver,

challenges to conduct not prohibited by the text of the
statute.").Under the "traditional" or "classical theory" of insider

trading liability, $ 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 are violated when acorporate insider trades in the securities of his corporation

652 UNITED STATES v. O'HAGAN

Opinion of the Court
on the basis of material, nonpublic information. Trading onsuch information qualifies as a "deceptive device" under

$ 10(b), we have affirmed, because "a relationship of trustand confidence [exists] between the shareholders of a corporation and those insiders who have obtained confidential information by reason of their position with that corporation."
Chiarella v. United States, 445 U. S. 222, 228 (1980). That
relationship, we recognized, "gives rise to a duty to disclose[or to abstain from trading] because of the `necessity of preventing a corporate insider from . . . tak[ing] unfair advan-tage of . . . uninformed . . . stockholders.' "

Id., at 228-229
(citation omitted). The classical theory applies not only to
officers, directors, and other permanent insiders of a corporation, but also to attorneys, accountants, consultants, and others who temporarily become fiduciaries of a corporation.
See Dirks v. SEC, 463 U. S. 646, 655, n. 14 (1983).

The "misappropriation theory" holds that a person commits fraud "in connection with" a securities transaction, and
thereby violates $ 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, when he misappropriates confidential information for securities trading purposes, in breach of a duty owed to the source of the information. See Brief for United States 14. Under this theory, a
fiduciary's undisclosed, self-serving use of a principal's information to purchase or sell securities, in breach of a duty of
loyalty and confidentiality, defrauds the principal of the exclusive use of that information. In lieu of premising liability
on a fiduciary relationship between company insider and purchaser or seller of the company's stock, the misappropriation
theory premises liability on a fiduciary-turned-trader's deception of those who entrusted him with access to confidential information.

The two theories are complementary, each addressing efforts to capitalize on nonpublic information through the purchase or sale of securities. The classical theory targets a
corporate insider's breach of duty to shareholders with whom
the insider transacts; the misappropriation theory outlaws

Opinion of the Court
trading on the basis of nonpublic information by a corporate"outsider" in breach of a duty owed not to a trading party,

but to the source of the information. The misappropriationtheory is thus designed to "protec[t] the integrity of the securities markets against abuses by `outsiders' to a corporation
who have access to confidential information that will affectth[e] corporation's security price when revealed, but who

owe no fiduciary or other duty to that corporation's share-holders."

Ibid.
In this case, the indictment alleged that O'Hagan, inbreach of a duty of trust and confidence he owed to his law

firm, Dorsey & Whitney, and to its client, Grand Met, traded
on the basis of nonpublic information regarding Grand Met's
planned tender offer for Pillsbury common stock. App. 16.
This conduct, the Government charged, constituted a fraudulent device in connection with the purchase and sale of
securities.5

B

We agree with the Government that misappropriation, as
just defined, satisfies $ 10(b)'s requirement that chargeable
conduct involve a "deceptive device or contrivance" used "in
connection with" the purchase or sale of securities. We observe, first, that misappropriators, as the Government describes them, deal in deception. A fiduciary who "[pretends]
loyalty to the principal while secretly converting the principal's information for personal gain," Brief for United States

5 The Government could not have prosecuted O'Hagan under the classical theory, for O'Hagan was not an "insider" of Pillsbury, the corporation
in whose stock he traded. Although an "outsider" with respect to Pillsbury, O'Hagan had an intimate association with, and was found to have
traded on confidential information from, Dorsey & Whitney, counsel to
tender offeror Grand Met. Under the misappropriation theory, O'Hagan's
securities trading does not escape Exchange Act sanction, as it would
under Justice Thomas' dissenting view, simply because he was associated
with, and gained nonpublic information from, the bidder, rather than the
target.

fraud statute's proscription of "any scheme or artifice to defraud," 18 U. S. C. $ 1341. Affirming convictions under that
statute, we said in Carpenter that an employee's undertaking
not to reveal his employer's confidential information "became
a sham" when the employee provided the information to his
co-conspirators in a scheme to obtain trading profits. 484
U. S., at 27. A company's confidential information, we recognized in Carpenter, qualifies as property to which the company has a right of exclusive use. Id., at 25-27. The undisclosed misappropriation of such information, in violation of a
fiduciary duty, the Court said in Carpenter, constitutes fraud
akin to embezzlement--" `the fraudulent appropriation to
one's own use of the money or goods entrusted to one's care
by another.' " Id., at 27 (quoting Grin v. Shine, 187 U. S.
181, 189 (1902)); see Aldave, 13 Hofstra L. Rev., at 119. Carpenter's discussion of the fraudulent misuse of confidential
information, the Government notes, "is a particularly apt
source of guidance here, because [the mail fraud statute] (like
Section 10(b)) has long been held to require deception, not
merely the breach of a fiduciary duty." Brief for United
States 18, n. 9 (citation omitted).

Deception through nondisclosure is central to the theory
of liability for which the Government seeks recognition. As
counsel for the Government stated in explanation of the theory at oral argument: "To satisfy the common law rule that
a trustee may not use the property that [has] been entrusted
[to] him, there would have to be consent. To satisfy the requirement of the Securities Act that there be no deception,
there would only have to be disclosure." Tr. of Oral Arg.

(1958) (agent's disclosure obligation regarding use of con-fidential information).

The misappropriation theory advanced by the Governmentis consistent with

Santa Fe Industries, Inc. v. Green, 430
U. S. 462 (1977), a decision underscoring that $ 10(b) is not an
all-purpose breach of fiduciary duty ban; rather, it trains on
conduct involving manipulation or deception. See id., at
473-476. In contrast to the Government's allegations in this
case, in Santa Fe Industries, all pertinent facts were disclosed by the persons charged with violating $ 10(b) and Rule
10b-5, see id., at 474; therefore, there was no deception
through nondisclosure to which liability under those provisions could attach, see id., at 476. Similarly, full disclosure
forecloses liability under the misappropriation theory: Because the deception essential to the misappropriation theory
involves feigning fidelity to the source of information, if the
fiduciary discloses to the source that he plans to trade on the
nonpublic information, there is no "deceptive device" and
thus no $ 10(b) violation--although the fiduciary-turnedtrader may remain liable under state law for breach of a duty
of loyalty.7

We turn next to the $ 10(b) requirement that the misappropriator's deceptive use of information be "in connection with

6 Under the misappropriation theory urged in this case, the disclosure
obligation runs to the source of the information, here, Dorsey & Whitney
and Grand Met. Chief Justice Burger, dissenting in Chiarella, advanced
a broader reading of $ 10(b) and Rule 10b-5; the disclosure obligation, as
he envisioned it, ran to those with whom the misappropriator trades. 445
U. S., at 240 ("a person who has misappropriated nonpublic information
has an absolute duty to disclose that information or to refrain from trading"); see also id., at 243, n. 4. The Government does not propose that
we adopt a misappropriation theory of that breadth.

7 Where, however, a person trading on the basis of material, nonpublic

information owes a duty of loyalty and confidentiality to two entities or
persons--for example, a law firm and its client--but makes disclosure to
only one, the trader may still be liable under the misappropriation theory.

656 UNITED STATES v. O'HAGAN

Opinion of the Court
the purchase or sale of [a] security." This element is satis-fied because the fiduciary's fraud is consummated, not when

the fiduciary gains the confidential information, but when,without disclosure to his principal, he uses the information
to purchase or sell securities. The securities transaction
and the breach of duty thus coincide. This is so even thoughthe person or entity defrauded is not the other party to the

trade, but is, instead, the source of the nonpublic informa-tion. See Aldave, 13 Hofstra L. Rev., at 120 ("a fraud or
deceit can be practiced on one person, with resultant harmto another person or group of persons"). A misappropriator
who trades on the basis of material, nonpublic information,
in short, gains his advantageous market position through deception; he deceives the source of the information and simultaneously harms members of the investing public. See id.,
at 120-121, and n. 107.

The misappropriation theory targets information of a sort
that misappropriators ordinarily capitalize upon to gain norisk profits through the purchase or sale of securities.
Should a misappropriator put such information to other use,
the statute's prohibition would not be implicated. The theory does not catch all conceivable forms of fraud involving
confidential information; rather, it catches fraudulent means
of capitalizing on such information through securities
transactions.

The Government notes another limitation on the forms of
fraud $ 10(b) reaches: "The misappropriation theory would
not . . . apply to a case in which a person defrauded a bank
into giving him a loan or embezzled cash from another, and
then used the proceeds of the misdeed to purchase securities." Brief for United States 24, n. 13. In such a case, the
Government states, "the proceeds would have value to the
malefactor apart from their use in a securities transaction,
and the fraud would be complete as soon as the money was
obtained." Ibid. In other words, money can buy, if not
anything, then at least many things; its misappropriation

Opinion of the Court
may thus be viewed as sufficiently detached from a subsequent securities transaction that $ 10(b)'s "in connection
with" requirement would not be met. Ibid.

Justice Thomas' charge that the misappropriation theory
is incoherent because information, like funds, can be put to
multiple uses, see post, at 681-686 (opinion concurring in
judgment in part and dissenting in part), misses the point.
The Exchange Act was enacted in part "to insure the maintenance of fair and honest markets," 15 U. S. C. $ 78b, and there
is no question that fraudulent uses of confidential information fall within $ 10(b)'s prohibition if the fraud is "in connection with" a securities transaction. It is hardly remarkable
that a rule suitably applied to the fraudulent uses of certain
kinds of information would be stretched beyond reason were
it applied to the fraudulent use of money.

Justice Thomas does catch the Government in overstatement. Observing that money can be used for all manner of
purposes and purchases, the Government urges that confidential information of the kind at issue derives its value
only from its utility in securities trading. See Brief for
United States 10, 21; post, at 683-684 (several times emphasizing the word "only"). Substitute "ordinarily" for "only,"
and the Government is on the mark.8

8 Justice Thomas' evident struggle to invent other uses to which O'Hagan plausibly might have put the nonpublic information, see post, at 685,
is telling. It is imaginative to suggest that a trade journal would have
paid O'Hagan dollars in the millions to publish his information. See Tr.
of Oral Arg. 36-37. Counsel for O'Hagan hypothesized, as a nontrading
use, that O'Hagan could have "misappropriat[ed] this information of [his]
law firm and its client, deliver[ed] it to [Pillsbury], and suggest[ed] that
[Pillsbury] in the future . . . might find it very desirable to use [O'Hagan]
for legal work." Id., at 37. But Pillsbury might well have had large
doubts about engaging for its legal work a lawyer who so stunningly displayed his readiness to betray a client's confidence. Nor is the Commission's theory "incoherent" or "inconsistent," post, at 680, 692, for failing to
inhibit use of confidential information for "personal amusement . . . in a
fantasy stock trading game," post, at 685.

658 UNITED STATES v. O'HAGAN

Opinion of the Court
Our recognition that the Government's "only" is an overstatement has provoked the dissent to cry "new theory."
See post, at 687-689. But the very case on which Justice
Thomas relies, Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States,
Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463 U. S. 29
(1983), shows the extremity of that charge. In State Farm,
we reviewed an agency's rescission of a rule under the same
"arbitrary and capricious" standard by which the promulgation of a rule under the relevant statute was to be judged,
see id., at 41-42; in our decision concluding that the agency
had not adequately explained its regulatory action, see id.,
at 57, we cautioned that a "reviewing court should not attempt itself to make up for such deficiencies," id., at 43.
Here, by contrast, Rule 10b-5's promulgation has not been
challenged; we consider only the Government's charge that
O'Hagan's alleged fraudulent conduct falls within the prohibitions of the Rule and $ 10(b). In this context, we acknowledge simply that, in defending the Government's interpretation of the Rule and statute in this Court, the Government's
lawyers have pressed a solid point too far, something lawyers, occasionally even judges, are wont to do.

The misappropriation theory comports with $ 10(b)'s language, which requires deception "in connection with the purchase or sale of any security," not deception of an identifiable
purchaser or seller. The theory is also well tuned to an animating purpose of the Exchange Act: to insure honest securities markets and thereby promote investor confidence. See
45 Fed. Reg. 60412 (1980) (trading on misappropriated information "undermines the integrity of, and investor confidence
in, the securities markets"). Although informational disparity is inevitable in the securities markets, investors likely
would hesitate to venture their capital in a market where
trading based on misappropriated nonpublic information is
unchecked by law. An investor's informational disadvantage vis-a` -vis a misappropriator with material, nonpublic in521US2 Unit: $U89 [11-20-99 15:31:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN

659Cite as: 521 U. S. 642 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
formation stems from contrivance, not luck; it is a disadvantage that cannot be overcome with research or skill. See
Brudney, Insiders, Outsiders, and Informational Advantages
Under the Federal Securities Laws, 93 Harv. L. Rev. 322,
356 (1979) ("If the market is thought to be systematically
populated with . . . transactors [trading on the basis of misappropriated information] some investors will refrain from
dealing altogether, and others will incur costs to avoid dealing with such transactors or corruptly to overcome their
unerodable informational advantages."); Aldave, 13 Hofstra
L. Rev., at 122-123.

In sum, considering the inhibiting impact on market participation of trading on misappropriated information, and the
congressional purposes underlying $ 10(b), it makes scant
sense to hold a lawyer like O'Hagan a $ 10(b) violator if he
works for a law firm representing the target of a tender
offer, but not if he works for a law firm representing the
bidder. The text of the statute requires no such result.9
The misappropriation at issue here was properly made the
subject of a $ 10(b) charge because it meets the statutory
requirement that there be "deceptive" conduct "in connection with" securities transactions.

9 As noted earlier, however, see supra, at 654-655, the textual requirement of deception precludes $ 10(b) liability when a person trading on the
basis of nonpublic information has disclosed his trading plans to, or obtained authorization from, the principal--even though such conduct may
affect the securities markets in the same manner as the conduct reached
by the misappropriation theory. Contrary to Justice Thomas' suggestion, see post, at 689-691, the fact that $ 10(b) is only a partial antidote to
the problems it was designed to alleviate does not call into question its
prohibition of conduct that falls within its textual proscription. Moreover, once a disloyal agent discloses his imminent breach of duty, his principal may seek appropriate equitable relief under state law. Furthermore, in the context of a tender offer, the principal who authorizes an
agent's trading on confidential information may, in the Commission's view,
incur liability for an Exchange Act violation under Rule 14e-3(a).

660 UNITED STATES v. O'HAGAN

Opinion of the Court

C
The Court of Appeals rejected the misappropriation the-ory primarily on two grounds. First, as the Eighth Circuit

comprehended the theory, it requires neither misrepresenta-tion nor nondisclosure. See 92 F. 3d, at 618. As we just
explained, however, see supra, at 654-655, deceptive nondis-closure is essential to the $ 10(b) liability at issue. Concretely, in this case, "it [was O'Hagan's] failure to disclose hispersonal trading to Grand Met and Dorsey, in breach of his
duty to do so, that ma[de] his conduct `deceptive' within themeaning of [$ ]10(b)." Reply Brief 7.

Second and "more obvious," the Court of Appeals said, themisappropriation theory is not moored to $ 10(b)'s requirement that "the fraud be `in connection with the purchase orsale of any security.' " 92 F. 3d, at 618 (quoting 15 U. S. C.

$ 78j(b)). According to the Eighth Circuit, three of our deci-sions reveal that $ 10(b) liability cannot be predicated on a
duty owed to the source of nonpublic information: Chiarellav.

United States, 445 U. S. 222 (1980); Dirks v. SEC, 463 U. S.646 (1983); and Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A., 511 U. S. 164 (1994). "[O]nly abreach of a duty to parties to the securities transaction," the
Court of Appeals concluded, "or, at the most, to other marketparticipants such as investors, will be sufficient to give rise
to $ 10(b) liability." 92 F. 3d, at 618. We read the statuteand our precedent differently, and note again that $ 10(b) refers to "the purchase or sale of any security," not to identifi-able purchasers or sellers of securities.

Chiarella involved securities trades by a printer employedat a shop that printed documents announcing corporate takeover bids. See 445 U. S., at 224. Deducing the names oftarget companies from documents he handled, the printer
bought shares of the targets before takeover bids were an-nounced, expecting (correctly) that the share prices would
rise upon announcement. In these transactions, the printerdid not disclose to the sellers of the securities (the target

Opinion of the Court
companies' shareholders) the nonpublic information on whichhe traded. See

ibid. For that trading, the printer was convicted of violating $ 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. We reversed theCourt of Appeals judgment that had affirmed the conviction.

See id., at 225.

The jury in Chiarella had been instructed that it couldconvict the defendant if he willfully failed to inform sellers

of target company securities that he knew of a takeover bidthat would increase the value of their shares. See

id., at
226. Emphasizing that the printer had no agency or otherfiduciary relationship with the sellers, we held that liability

could not be imposed on so broad a theory. See id., at 235.
There is under $ 10(b), we explained, no "general duty between all participants in market transactions to forgo actions
based on material, nonpublic information." Id., at 233.
Under established doctrine, we said, a duty to disclose or
abstain from trading "arises from a specific relationship between two parties." Ibid.

The Court did not hold in Chiarella that the only relationship prompting liability for trading on undisclosed information is the relationship between a corporation's insiders and
shareholders. That is evident from our response to the Government's argument before this Court that the printer's misappropriation of information from his employer for purposes
of securities trading--in violation of a duty of confidentiality
owed to the acquiring companies--constituted fraud in connection with the purchase or sale of a security, and thereby
satisfied the terms of $ 10(b). Id., at 235-236. The Court
declined to reach that potential basis for the printer's liability, because the theory had not been submitted to the jury.
See id., at 236-237. But four Justices found merit in it.
See id., at 239 (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment); id., at
240-243 (Burger, C. J., dissenting); id., at 245 (Blackmun, J.,
joined by Marshall, J., dissenting). And a fifth Justice
stated that the Court "wisely le[ft] the resolution of this
issue for another day." Id., at 238 (Stevens, J., concurring).

521US2 Unit: $U89 [11-20-99 15:31:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN
662 UNITED STATES v. O'HAGAN

Opinion of the Court
Chiarella thus expressly left open the misappropriation
theory before us today. Certain statements in Chiarella,
however, led the Eighth Circuit in the instant case to conclude that $ 10(b) liability hinges exclusively on a breach of
duty owed to a purchaser or seller of securities. See 92
F. 3d, at 618. The Court said in Chiarella that $ 10(b) liability "is premised upon a duty to disclose arising from a relationship of trust and confidence between parties to a transaction," 445 U. S., at 230 (emphasis added), and observed that
the printshop employee defendant in that case "was not a
person in whom the sellers had placed their trust and confidence," see id., at 232. These statements rejected the notion that $ 10(b) stretches so far as to impose "a general duty
between all participants in market transactions to forgo actions based on material, nonpublic information," id., at 233,
and we confine them to that context. The statements highlighted by the Eighth Circuit, in short, appear in an opinion
carefully leaving for future resolution the validity of the misappropriation theory, and therefore cannot be read to foreclose that theory.

Dirks, too, left room for application of the misappropriation theory in cases like the one we confront.10 Dirks involved an investment analyst who had received information
from a former insider of a corporation with which the analyst
had no connection. See 463 U. S., at 648-649. The information indicated that the corporation had engaged in a massive
fraud. The analyst investigated the fraud, obtaining corroborating information from employees of the corporation.
During his investigation, the analyst discussed his findings
with clients and investors, some of whom sold their holdings
in the company the analyst suspected of gross wrongdoing.
See id., at 649.

10 The Eighth Circuit's conclusion to the contrary was based in large
part on Dirks's reiteration of the Chiarella language quoted and discussed
above. See 92 F. 3d 612, 618-619 (1996).

521US2 Unit: $U89 [11-20-99 15:31:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN

663Cite as: 521 U. S. 642 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
The SEC censured the analyst for, inter alia, aiding andabetting $ 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 violations by clients and investors who sold their holdings based on the nonpublic infor-mation the analyst passed on. See

id., at 650-652. In the
SEC's view, the analyst, as a "tippee" of corporation insiders,
had a duty under $ 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 to refrain from com-municating the nonpublic information to persons likely to

trade on the basis of it. See id., at 651, 655-656. ThisCourt found no such obligation, see

id., at 665-667, and repeated the key point made in Chiarella: There is no " `gen-eral duty between all participants in market transactions to

forgo actions based on material, nonpublic information.' "
463 U. S., at 655 (quoting Chiarella, 445 U. S., at 233); see
Aldave, 13 Hofstra L. Rev., at 122 (misappropriation theory
bars only "trading on the basis of information that the
wrongdoer converted to his own use in violation of some fiduciary, contractual, or similar obligation to the owner or
rightful possessor of the information").

No showing had been made in Dirks that the "tippers"
had violated any duty by disclosing to the analyst nonpublic
information about their former employer. The insiders had
acted not for personal profit, but to expose a massive fraud
within the corporation. See 463 U. S., at 666-667. Absent
any violation by the tippers, there could be no derivative
liability for the tippee. See id., at 667. Most important for
purposes of the instant case, the Court observed in Dirks:
"There was no expectation by [the analyst's] sources that he
would keep their information in confidence. Nor did [the
analyst] misappropriate or illegally obtain the information . . . ." Id., at 665. Dirks thus presents no suggestion
that a person who gains nonpublic information through misappropriation in breach of a fiduciary duty escapes $ 10(b)
liability when, without alerting the source, he trades on the
information.

Last of the three cases the Eighth Circuit regarded as
warranting disapproval of the misappropriation theory, Cen521US2 Unit: $U89 [11-20-99 15:31:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN
664 UNITED STATES v. O'HAGAN

Opinion of the Court
tral Bank held that "a private plaintiff may not maintain an
aiding and abetting suit under $ 10(b)." 511 U. S., at 191.
We immediately cautioned in Central Bank that secondary
actors in the securities markets may sometimes be chargeable under the securities Acts: "Any person or entity, including a lawyer, accountant, or bank, who employs a manipulative device or makes a material misstatement (or omission)
on which a purchaser or seller of securities relies may be
liable as a primary violator under 10b-5, assuming . . . the
requirements for primary liability under Rule 10b-5 are
met." Ibid. (emphasis added). The Eighth Circuit isolated
the statement just quoted and drew from it the conclusion
that $ 10(b) covers only deceptive statements or omissions
on which purchasers and sellers, and perhaps other market
participants, rely. See 92 F. 3d, at 619. It is evident from
the question presented in Central Bank, however, that this
Court, in the quoted passage, sought only to clarify that secondary actors, although not subject to aiding and abetting
liability, remain subject to primary liability under $ 10(b) and
Rule 10b-5 for certain conduct.

Furthermore, Central Bank's discussion concerned only
private civil litigation under $ 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, not
criminal liability. Central Bank's reference to purchasers
or sellers of securities must be read in light of a longstanding
limitation on private $ 10(b) suits. In Blue Chip Stamps v.
Manor Drug Stores, 421 U. S. 723 (1975), we held that only
actual purchasers or sellers of securities may maintain a
private civil action under $ 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. We so
confined the $ 10(b) private right of action because of "policy considerations." Id., at 737. In particular, Blue Chip
Stamps recognized the abuse potential and proof problems
inherent in suits by investors who neither bought nor sold,
but asserted they would have traded absent fraudulent conduct by others. See id., at 739-747; see also Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corporation, 503 U. S. 258, 285

Opinion of the Court
(1992) (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring injudgment); id., at 289-290 (

Scalia, J., concurring in judg-ment). Criminal prosecutions do not present the dangers

the Court addressed in Blue Chip Stamps, so that decisionis "inapplicable" to indictments for violations of $ 10(b) and
Rule 10b-5. United States v. Naftalin, 441 U. S. 768, 774,n. 6 (1979); see also Holmes, 503 U. S., at 281 (

O'Connor,J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) ("[T]he

purchaser/seller standing requirement for private civil actions under $ 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 is of no import in criminalprosecutions for willful violations of those provisions.").

In sum, the misappropriation theory, as we have examined
and explained it in this opinion, is both consistent with thestatute and with our precedent.

11 Vital to our decision that

criminal liability may be sustained under the misappropriation theory, we emphasize, are two sturdy safeguards Con-gress has provided regarding scienter. To establish a criminal violation of Rule 10b-5, the Government must prove that
a person "willfully" violated the provision. See 15 U. S. C.

11 The United States additionally argues that Congress confirmed the
validity of the misappropriation theory in the Insider Trading and Securities Fraud Enforcement Act of 1988 (ITSFEA), $ 2(1), 102 Stat. 4677,
note following 15 U. S. C. $ 78u-1. See Brief for United States 32-35.
ITSFEA declares that "the rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 . . .
governing trading while in possession of material, nonpublic information
are, as required by such Act, necessary and appropriate in the public interest and for the protection of investors." Note following 15 U. S. C.

$ 78u-1. ITSFEA also includes a new $ 20A(a) of the Exchange Act expressly providing a private cause of action against persons who violate
the Exchange Act "by purchasing or selling a security while in possession
of material, nonpublic information"; such an action may be brought by
"any person who, contemporaneously with the purchase or sale of securities that is the subject of such violation, has purchased . . . or sold . . .
securities of the same class." 15 U. S. C. $ 78t-1(a). Because we uphold
the misappropriation theory on the basis of $ 10(b) itself, we do not address
ITSFEA's significance for cases of this genre.

Opinion of the Court

$ 78ff(a).12 Furthermore, a defendant may not be impris-oned for violating Rule 10b-5 if he proves that he had no

knowledge of the Rule. See ibid.13 O'Hagan's charge thatthe misappropriation theory is too indefinite to permit the
imposition of criminal liability, see Brief for Respondent 30-33, thus fails not only because the theory is limited to those
who breach a recognized duty. In addition, the statute's "re-quirement of the presence of culpable intent as a necessary
element of the offense does much to destroy any force in theargument that application of the [statute]" in circumstances
such as O'Hagan's is unjust. Boyce Motor Lines, Inc. v.
United States, 342 U. S. 337, 342 (1952).The Eighth Circuit erred in holding that the misappropriation theory is inconsistent with $ 10(b). The Court of Ap-peals may address on remand O'Hagan's other challenges to
his convictions under $ 10(b) and Rule 10b-5.

III
We consider next the ground on which the Court of Ap-peals reversed O'Hagan's convictions for fraudulent trading

in connection with a tender offer, in violation of $ 14(e) of theExchange Act and SEC Rule 14e-3(a). A sole question is
before us as to these convictions: Did the Commission, as theCourt of Appeals held, exceed its rulemaking authority
under $ 14(e) when it adopted Rule 14e-3(a) without requir-ing a showing that the trading at issue entailed a breach of

12 In relevant part, $ 32 of the Exchange Act, as set forth in 15 U. S. C.

$ 78ff(a), provides:

"Any person who willfully violates any provision of this chapter . . . or
any rule or regulation thereunder the violation of which is made unlawful
or the observance of which is required under the terms of this chapter . . .
shall upon conviction be fined not more than $1,000,000, or imprisoned not
more than 10 years, or both . . . ; but no person shall be subject to imprisonment under this section for the violation of any rule or regulation if he
proves that he had no knowledge of such rule or regulation."

fiduciary duty? We hold that the Commission, in this regardand to the extent relevant to this case, did not exceed its

authority.The governing statutory provision, $ 14(e) of the Exchange
Act, reads in relevant part:

"It shall be unlawful for any person . . . to engage inany fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative acts or practices, in connection with any tender offer . . . . The [SEC]shall, for the purposes of this subsection, by rules and
regulations define, and prescribe means reasonably de-signed to prevent, such acts and practices as are fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative." 15 U. S. C. $ 78n(e).
Section 14(e)'s first sentence prohibits fraudulent acts in con-nection with a tender offer. This self-operating proscription

was one of several provisions added to the Exchange Act in1968 by the Williams Act, 82 Stat. 454. The section's second
sentence delegates definitional and prophylactic rulemakingauthority to the Commission. Congress added this rulemaking delegation to $ 14(e) in 1970 amendments to the Wil-liams Act. See $ 5, 84 Stat. 1497.

Through $ 14(e) and other provisions on disclosure in theWilliams Act,

14 Congress sought to ensure that shareholders

"confronted by a cash tender offer for their stock [would]not be required to respond without adequate information."

14 In addition to $ 14(e), the Williams Act and the 1970 amendments
added to the Exchange Act the following provisions concerning disclosure:

$ 13(d), 15 U. S. C. $ 78m(d) (disclosure requirements for persons acquiring
more than five percent of certain classes of securities); $ 13(e), 15 U. S. C.

five percent of a class of securities); $ 14(f), 15 U. S. C. $ 78n(f) (disclosure
requirements when tender offer results in new corporate directors constituting a majority).

668 UNITED STATES v. O'HAGAN

Opinion of the Court
("very purpose" of Williams Act was "informed decisionmaking by shareholders"). As we recognized in Schreiber
v. Burlington Northern, Inc., 472 U. S. 1 (1985), Congress
designed the Williams Act to make "disclosure, rather than
court-imposed principles of `fairness' or `artificiality,' . . . the
preferred method of market regulation." Id., at 9, n. 8.
Section 14(e), we explained, "supplements the more precise
disclosure provisions found elsewhere in the Williams Act,
while requiring disclosure more explicitly addressed to the
tender offer context than that required by $ 10(b)." Id., at
10-11.

Relying on $ 14(e)'s rulemaking authorization, the Commission, in 1980, promulgated Rule 14e-3(a). That measure
provides:

"(a) If any person has taken a substantial step or
steps to commence, or has commenced, a tender offer
(the `offering person'), it shall constitute a fraudulent,
deceptive or manipulative act or practice within the
meaning of section 14(e) of the [Exchange] Act for any
other person who is in possession of material information relating to such tender offer which information he
knows or has reason to know is nonpublic and which he
knows or has reason to know has been acquired directly
or indirectly from:

"(1) The offering person,
"(2) The issuer of the securities sought or to be sought
by such tender offer, or

"(3) Any officer, director, partner or employee or any
other person acting on behalf of the offering person or
such issuer, to purchase or sell or cause to be purchased
or sold any of such securities or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for any such securities or any
option or right to obtain or to dispose of any of the foregoing securities, unless within a reasonable time prior
to any purchase or sale such information and its source

are publicly disclosed by press release or otherwise."17 CFR $ 240.14e-3(a) (1996).

As characterized by the Commission, Rule 14e-3(a) is a "dis-close or abstain from trading" requirement. 45 Fed. Reg.
60410 (1980).15 The Second Circuit concisely described theRule's thrust:

"One violates Rule 14e-3(a) if he trades on the basisof material nonpublic information concerning a pending
tender offer that he knows or has reason to know hasbeen acquired `directly or indirectly' from an insider of
the offeror or issuer, or someone working on their be-half. Rule 14e-3(a) is a disclosure provision. It creates a duty in those traders who fall within its ambit toabstain or disclose,

without regard to whether the traderowes a pre-existing fiduciary duty to respect the confidentiality of the information." United States v. Chest-man, 947 F. 2d 551, 557 (1991) (en banc) (emphasis
added), cert. denied, 503 U. S. 1004 (1992).
See also SEC v. Maio, 51 F. 3d 623, 635 (CA7 1995) ("Rule14e-3 creates a duty to disclose material non-public information, or abstain from trading in stocks implicated by an im-pending tender offer,

regardless of whether such informa-tion was obtained through a breach of fiduciary duty."

(emphasis added)); SEC v. Peters, 978 F. 2d 1162, 1165 (CA101992) (as written, Rule 14e-3(a) has no fiduciary duty
requirement).In the Eighth Circuit's view, because Rule 14e-3(a) applies
whether or not the trading in question breaches a fiduciaryduty, the regulation exceeds the SEC's $ 14(e) rulemaking
authority. See 92 F. 3d, at 624, 627. Contra, Maio, 51 F. 3d,at 634-635 (CA7);

Peters, 978 F. 2d, at 1165-1167 (CA10);

15 The Rule thus adopts for the tender offer context a requirement resembling the one Chief Justice Burger would have adopted in Chiarella
for misappropriators under $ 10(b). See supra, at 655, n. 6.

Opinion of the Court
Chestman, 947 F. 2d, at 556-563 (CA2) (all holding Rule 14e-
3(a) a proper exercise of SEC's statutory authority). In support of its holding, the Eighth Circuit relied on the text of

$ 14(e) and our decisions in Schreiber and Chiarella. See 92
F. 3d, at 624-627.

The Eighth Circuit homed in on the essence of $ 14(e)'s
rulemaking authorization: "[T]he statute empowers the SEC
to `define' and `prescribe means reasonably designed to prevent' `acts and practices' which are `fraudulent.' " Id., at
624. All that means, the Eighth Circuit found plain, is that
the SEC may "identify and regulate," in the tender offer
context, "acts and practices" the law already defines as
"fraudulent"; but, the Eighth Circuit maintained, the SEC
may not "create its own definition of fraud." Ibid. (internal
quotation marks omitted).

This Court, the Eighth Circuit pointed out, held in Schreiber that the word "manipulative" in the $ 14(e) phrase "fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative acts or practices" means
just what the word means in $ 10(b): Absent misrepresentation or nondisclosure, an act cannot be indicted as manipulative. See 92 F. 3d, at 625 (citing Schreiber, 472 U. S., at 7-8,
and n. 6). Section 10(b) interpretations guide construction
of $ 14(e), the Eighth Circuit added, see 92 F. 3d, at 625, citing
this Court's acknowledgment in Schreiber that $ 14(e)'s
" `broad antifraud prohibition' . . . [is] modeled on the antifraud provisions of $ 10(b) . . . and Rule 10b-5," 472 U. S., at
10 (citation omitted); see id., at 10-11, n. 10.

For the meaning of "fraudulent" under $ 10(b), the Eighth
Circuit looked to Chiarella. See 92 F. 3d, at 625. In that
case, the Eighth Circuit recounted, this Court held that a
failure to disclose information could be "fraudulent" under

$ 10(b) only when there was a duty to speak arising out of " `a
fiduciary or other similar relation of trust and confidence.' "
Chiarella, 445 U. S., at 228 (quoting Restatement (Second) of
Torts $ 551(2)(a) (1976)). Just as $ 10(b) demands a showing

Opinion of the Court
of a breach of fiduciary duty, so such a breach is necessaryto make out a $ 14(e) violation, the Eighth Circuit concluded.

As to the Commission's $ 14(e) authority to "prescribemeans reasonably designed to prevent" fraudulent acts, the
Eighth Circuit stated: "Properly read, this provision means
simply that the SEC has broad regulatory powers in the fieldof tender offers, but the statutory terms have a fixed meaning which the SEC cannot alter by way of an administrativerule." 92 F. 3d, at 627.

The United States urges that the Eighth Circuit's readingof $ 14(e) misapprehends both the Commission's authority to
define fraudulent acts and the Commission's power to prevent them. "The `defining' power," the United States submits, "would be a virtual nullity were the SEC not permitted
to go beyond common law fraud (which is separately prohibited in the first [self-operative] sentence of Section 14(e))."
Brief for United States 11; see id., at 37.

In maintaining that the Commission's power to define
fraudulent acts under $ 14(e) is broader than its rulemaking
power under $ 10(b), the United States questions the Court
of Appeals' reading of Schreiber. See Brief for United
States 38-40. Parenthetically, the United States notes that
the word before the Schreiber Court was "manipulative"; unlike "fraudulent," the United States observes, " `manipulative' . . . is `virtually a term of art when used in connection
with the securities markets.' " Brief for United States 38,
n. 20 (quoting Schreiber, 472 U. S., at 6). Most tellingly, the
United States submits, Schreiber involved acts alleged to violate the self-operative provision in $ 14(e)'s first sentence, a
sentence containing language similar to $ 10(b). But $ 14(e)'s
second sentence, containing the rulemaking authorization,
the United States points out, does not track $ 10(b), which
simply authorizes the SEC to proscribe "manipulative or
deceptive device[s] or contrivance[s]." Brief for United
States 38. Instead, $ 14(e)'s rulemaking prescription tracks

$ 15(c)(2)(D) of the Exchange Act, 15 U. S. C. $ 78o(c)(2)(D),

which concerns the conduct of broker-dealers in over-the-counter markets. See Brief for United States 38-39. Since

1938, see 52 Stat. 1075, $ 15(c)(2) has given the Commissionauthority to "define, and prescribe means reasonably designed to prevent, such [broker-dealer] acts and practices asare fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative." 15 U. S. C.

$ 78o(c)(2)(D). When Congress added this same rulemakinglanguage to $ 14(e) in 1970, the Government states, the Commission had already used its $ 15(c)(2) authority to reach beyond common-law fraud. See Brief for United States 39,n. 22.

16

We need not resolve in this case whether the Commission'sauthority under $ 14(e) to "define . . . such acts and practices

as are fraudulent" is broader than the Commission's fraud-defining authority under $ 10(b), for we agree with the
United States that Rule 14e-3(a), as applied to cases of this
genre, qualifies under $ 14(e) as a "means reasonably de-signed to prevent" fraudulent trading on material, nonpublic

information in the tender offer context.17 A prophylactic

16 The Government draws our attention to the following measures: 17
CFR $ 240.15c2-1 (1970) (prohibiting a broker-dealer's hypothecation of a
customer's securities if hypothecated securities would be commingled with
the securities of another customer, absent written consent); $ 240.15c2-3
(prohibiting transactions by broker-dealers in unvalidated German securities); $ 240.15c2-4 (prohibiting broker-dealers from accepting any part of
the sale price of a security being distributed unless the money received is
promptly transmitted to the persons entitled to it); $ 240.15c2-5 (requiring
broker-dealers to provide written disclosure of credit terms and commissions in connection with securities sales in which broker-dealers extend
credit, or participate in arranging for loans, to the purchasers). See Brief
for United States 39, n. 22.

17 We leave for another day, when the issue requires decision, the legitimacy of Rule 14e-3(a) as applied to "warehousing," which the Government
describes as "the practice by which bidders leak advance information of a
tender offer to allies and encourage them to purchase the target company's
stock before the bid is announced." Reply Brief 17. As we observed in
Chiarella, one of the Commission's purposes in proposing Rule 14e-3(a)

measure, because its mission is to prevent, typically encom-passes more than the core activity prohibited. As we noted

in Schreiber, $ 14(e)'s rulemaking authorization gives theCommission "latitude," even in the context of a term of art
like "manipulative," "to regulate nondeceptive activities as a`reasonably designed' means of preventing manipulative acts,
without suggesting any change in the meaning of the term`manipulative' itself." 472 U. S., at 11, n. 11. We hold, accordingly, that under $ 14(e), the Commission may prohibitacts not themselves fraudulent under the common law or

$ 10(b), if the prohibition is "reasonably designed to prevent. . . acts and practices [that] are fraudulent." 15 U. S. C.

$ 78n(e).18Because Congress has authorized the Commission, in

$ 14(e), to prescribe legislative rules, we owe the Commis-sion's judgment "more than mere deference or weight."
Batterton v. Francis, 432 U. S. 416, 424-426 (1977). There-fore, in determining whether Rule 14e-3(a)'s "disclose or abstain from trading" requirement is reasonably designed toprevent fraudulent acts, we must accord the Commission's
assessment "controlling weight unless [it is] arbitrary, capri-cious, or manifestly contrary to the statute." Chevron
U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467U. S. 837, 844 (1984). In this case, we conclude, the Commission's assessment is none of these.19
was "to bar warehousing under its authority to regulate tender offers."
445 U. S., at 234. The Government acknowledges that trading authorized
by a principal breaches no fiduciary duty. See Reply Brief 17. The instant case, however, does not involve trading authorized by a principal;
therefore, we need not here decide whether the Commission's proscription
of warehousing falls within its $ 14(e) authority to define or prevent fraud.

18 The Commission's power under $ 10(b) is more limited. See supra, at

651 (Rule 10b-5 may proscribe only conduct that $ 10(b) prohibits).

19 Justice Thomas' dissent urges that the Commission must be precise

about the authority it is exercising--that it must say whether it is acting
to "define" or to "prevent" fraud--and that in this instance it has pur521US2 Unit: $U89 [11-20-99 15:31:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN
674 UNITED STATES v. O'HAGAN

Opinion of the Court
In adopting the "disclose or abstain" rule, the SECexplained:

"The Commission has previously expressed and con-tinues to have serious concerns about trading by persons
in possession of material, nonpublic information relatingto a tender offer. This practice results in unfair disparities in market information and market disruption. Se-curity holders who purchase from or sell to such persons
are effectively denied the benefits of disclosure and thesubstantive protections of the Williams Act. If furnished with the information, these security holderswould be able to make an informed investment decision,
which could involve deferring the purchase or sale ofthe securities until the material information had been
disseminated or until the tender offer had been com-menced or terminated." 45 Fed. Reg. 60412 (1980)
(footnotes omitted).
The Commission thus justified Rule 14e-3(a) as a means nec-essary and proper to assure the efficacy of Williams Act

protections.The United States emphasizes that Rule 14e-3(a) reaches
trading in which "a breach of duty is likely but difficult toprove." Reply Brief 16. "Particularly in the context of a
tender offer," as the Tenth Circuit recognized, "there is afairly wide circle of people with confidential information,"
Peters, 978 F. 2d, at 1167, notably, the attorneys, investment
ported only to define, not to prevent. See post, at 696. Justice Thomas
sees this precision in Rule 14e-3(a)'s words: "it shall constitute a fraudulent . . . act . . . within the meaning of section 14(e) . . . ." We do not
find the Commission's Rule vulnerable for failure to recite as a regulatory
preamble: We hereby exercise our authority to "define, and prescribe
means reasonably designed to prevent, . . . [fraudulent] acts." Sensibly
read, the Rule is an exercise of the Commission's full authority. Logically
and practically, such a rule may be conceived and defended, alternatively,
as definitional or preventive.

bankers, and accountants involved in structuring the trans-action. The availability of that information may lead to

abuse, for "even a hint of an upcoming tender offer may sendthe price of the target company's stock soaring." SEC v.
Materia, 745 F. 2d 197, 199 (CA2 1984). Individuals en-trusted with nonpublic information, particularly if they have
no long-term loyalty to the issuer, may find the temptationto trade on that information hard to resist in view of "the
very large short-term profits potentially available [to them]."
Peters, 978 F. 2d, at 1167."[I]t may be possible to prove circumstantially that a person [traded on the basis of material, nonpublic information],but almost impossible to prove that the trader obtained such
information in breach of a fiduciary duty owed either by thetrader or by the ultimate insider source of the information."
Ibid. The example of a "tippee" who trades on informationreceived from an insider illustrates the problem. Under
Rule 10b-5, "a tippee assumes a fiduciary duty to the share-holders of a corporation not to trade on material nonpublic
information only when the insider has breached his fiduciaryduty to the shareholders by disclosing the information to the
tippee and the tippee knows or should know that there hasbeen a breach."

Dirks, 463 U. S., at 660. To show that a
tippee who traded on nonpublic information about a tenderoffer had breached a fiduciary duty would require proof not

only that the insider source breached a fiduciary duty, butthat the tippee knew or should have known of that breach.
"Yet, in most cases, the only parties to the [information
transfer] will be the insider and the alleged tippee." Peters,978 F. 2d, at 1167.

20 Justice Thomas opines that there is no reason to anticipate difficulties in proving breach of duty in "misappropriation" cases. "Once the
source of the [purloined] information has been identified," he asserts, "it
should be a simple task to obtain proof of any breach of duty." Post, at

676 UNITED STATES v. O'HAGAN

Opinion of the Court
In sum, it is a fair assumption that trading on the basis ofmaterial, nonpublic information will often involve a breach

of a duty of confidentiality to the bidder or target companyor their representatives. The SEC, cognizant of the proof
problem that could enable sophisticated traders to escape re-sponsibility, placed in Rule 14e-3(a) a "disclose or abstain
from trading" command that does not require specific proofof a breach of fiduciary duty. That prescription, we are satisfied, applied to this case, is a "means reasonably designedto prevent" fraudulent trading on material, nonpublic information in the tender offer context. See Chestman, 947F. 2d, at 560 ("While dispensing with the subtle problems of
proof associated with demonstrating fiduciary breach in theproblematic area of tender offer insider trading, [Rule 14e-
3(a)] retains a close nexus between the prohibited conductand the statutory aims."); accord, Maio, 51 F. 3d, at 635, and
n. 14; Peters, 978 F. 2d, at 1167.21 Therefore, insofar as itserves to prevent the type of misappropriation charged
against O'Hagan, Rule 14e-3(a) is a proper exercise of theCommission's prophylactic power under $ 14(e).

22

As an alternate ground for affirming the Eighth Circuit'sjudgment, O'Hagan urges that Rule 14e-3(a) is invalid besey & Whitney told his daughter or son and a wealthy friend that a tender
for Pillsbury was in the offing, and each tippee promptly purchased Pillsbury stock, the child borrowing the purchase price from the wealthy
friend. Justice Thomas' confidence, post, at 698, n. 12, that "there is no
reason to suspect that the tipper would gratuitously protect the tippee,"
seems misplaced.

21 Justice Thomas insists that even if the misappropriation of information from the bidder about a tender offer is fraud, the Commission has not
explained why such fraud is "in connection with" a tender offer. Post,
at 697, 698. What else, one can only wonder, might such fraud be "in
connection with"?

22 Repeating the argument it made concerning the misappropriation theory, see supra, at 665, n. 11, the United States urges that Congress confirmed Rule 14e-3(a)'s validity in ITSFEA, 15 U. S. C. $ 78u-1. See Brief
for United States 44-45. We uphold Rule 14e-3(a) on the basis of $ 14(e)
itself and need not address ITSFEA's relevance to this case.

Opinion of the Court
cause it prohibits trading in advance of a tender offer--when
"a substantial step . . . to commence" such an offer has been
taken--while $ 14(e) prohibits fraudulent acts "in connection
with any tender offer." See Brief for Respondent 41-42.
O'Hagan further contends that, by covering pre-offer conduct, Rule 14e-3(a) "fails to comport with due process on
two levels": The Rule does not "give fair notice as to when,
in advance of a tender offer, a violation of $ 14(e) occurs," id.,
at 42; and it "disposes of any scienter requirement," id., at
43. The Court of Appeals did not address these arguments,
and O'Hagan did not raise the due process points in his briefs
before that court. We decline to consider these contentions
in the first instance.23 The Court of Appeals may address
on remand any arguments O'Hagan has preserved.

IV
Based on its dispositions of the securities fraud convictions, the Court of Appeals also reversed O'Hagan's convictions, under 18 U. S. C. $ 1341, for mail fraud. See 92 F. 3d,
at 627-628. Reversal of the securities convictions, the
Court of Appeals recognized, "d[id] not as a matter of law
require that the mail fraud convictions likewise be reversed."
Id., at 627 (citing Carpenter, 484 U. S., at 24, in which this
Court unanimously affirmed mail and wire fraud convictions
based on the same conduct that evenly divided the Court on
the defendants' securities fraud convictions). But in this
case, the Court of Appeals said, the indictment was so structured that the mail fraud charges could not be disassociated
from the securities fraud charges, and absent any securities

23 As to O'Hagan's scienter argument, we reiterate that 15 U. S. C.

$ 78ff(a) requires the Government to prove "willful[l] violat[ion]" of

the securities laws, and that lack of knowledge of the relevant rule is
an affirmative defense to a sentence of imprisonment. See supra, at
665-666.

fraud, "there was no fraud upon which to base the mail fraud
charges." 92 F. 3d, at 627-628.24

The United States urges that the Court of Appeals' position is irreconcilable with Carpenter: Just as in Carpenter,
so here, the "mail fraud charges are independent of [the]
securities fraud charges, even [though] both rest on the same
set of facts." Brief for United States 46-47. We need not
linger over this matter, for our rulings on the securities
fraud issues require that we reverse the Court of Appeals
judgment on the mail fraud counts as well.25

O'Hagan, we note, attacked the mail fraud convictions in
the Court of Appeals on alternate grounds; his other arguments, not yet addressed by the Eighth Circuit, remain open
for consideration on remand.

* * *
The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

24 The Court of Appeals reversed respondent's money laundering convictions on similar reasoning. See 92 F. 3d, at 628. Because the United
States did not seek review of that ruling, we leave undisturbed that portion of the Court of Appeals' judgment.

25 Justice Thomas finds O'Hagan's convictions on the mail fraud counts,

but not on the securities fraud counts, sustainable. Post, at 700-701.
Under his view, securities traders like O'Hagan would escape SEC civil
actions and federal prosecutions under legislation targeting securities
fraud, only to be caught for their trading activities in the broad mail fraud
net. If misappropriation theory cases could proceed only under the federal mail and wire fraud statutes, practical consequences for individual
defendants might not be large, see Aldave, 49 Ohio St. L. J., at 381, and
n. 60; however, "proportionally more persons accused of insider trading
[might] be pursued by a U. S. Attorney, and proportionally fewer by the
SEC," id., at 382. Our decision, of course, does not rest on such enforcement policy considerations.

10b-5, or they did not--regardless of the reasons the Government gave. And it is for us to decide.While the Court's explanation of the scope of $ 10(b) and

Rule 10b-5 would be entirely reasonable in some other con-text, it does not seem to accord with the principle of lenity
we apply to criminal statutes (which cannot be mitigatedhere by the Rule, which is no less ambiguous than the statute). See Reno v. Koray, 515 U. S. 50, 64-65 (1995) (explain-ing circumstances in which rule of lenity applies);

United
States v. Bass, 404 U. S. 336, 347-348 (1971) (discussing policies underlying rule of lenity). In light of that principle, itseems to me that the unelaborated statutory language: "[t]o

use or employ, in connection with the purchase or sale ofany security . . . any manipulative or deceptive device or
contrivance," $ 10(b), must be construed to require the ma-nipulation or deception of a party to a securities transaction.

680 UNITED STATES v. O'HAGAN

Opinion of Thomas, J.
Justice Thomas, with whom The Chief Justice joins,concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.

Today the majority upholds respondent's convictions forviolating $ 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and
Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, based upon the Securi-ties and Exchange Commission's "misappropriation theory."
Central to the majority's holding is the need to interpret$ 10(b)'s requirement that a deceptive device be "use[d] or
employ[ed], in connection with the purchase or sale of anysecurity." 15 U. S. C. $ 78j(b). Because the Commission's
misappropriation theory fails to provide a coherent and con-sistent interpretation of this essential requirement for liability under $ 10(b), I dissent.The majority also sustains respondent's convictions under

$ 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act, and Rule 14e-3(a)promulgated thereunder, regardless of whether respondent
violated a fiduciary duty to anybody. I dissent too from thatholding because, while $ 14(e) does allow regulations prohibiting nonfraudulent acts as a prophylactic against certainfraudulent acts, neither the majority nor the Commission
identifies any relevant underlying fraud against which Rule14e-3(a) reasonably provides prophylaxis. With regard to
respondent's mail fraud convictions, however, I concur in thejudgment of the Court.

I
I do not take issue with the majority's determination thatthe undisclosed misappropriation of confidential information

by a fiduciary can constitute a "deceptive device" within themeaning of $ 10(b). Nondisclosure where there is a preexisting duty to disclose satisfies our definitions of fraud anddeceit for purposes of the securities laws. See

Chiarella v.United States, 445 U. S. 222, 230 (1980).

Unlike the majority, however, I cannot accept the Commis-sion's interpretation of when a deceptive device is "use[d] . . .
in connection with" a securities transaction. Although theCommission and the majority at points seem to suggest that

Opinion of Thomas, J.
any relation to a securities transaction satisfies the "in connection with" requirement of $ 10(b), both ultimately reject
such an overly expansive construction and require a more
integral connection between the fraud and the securities
transaction. The majority states, for example, that the misappropriation theory applies to undisclosed misappropriation
of confidential information "for securities trading purposes,"
ante, at 652, thus seeming to require a particular intent by
the misappropriator in order to satisfy the "in connection
with" language. See also ante, at 656 (the "misappropriation theory targets information of a sort that misappropriators ordinarily capitalize upon to gain no-risk profits through the purchase or sale of securities" (emphasis
added)); ante, at 656-657 (distinguishing embezzlement of
money used to buy securities as lacking the requisite connection). The Commission goes further, and argues that the
misappropriation theory satisfies the "in connection with" requirement because it "depends on an inherent connection between the deceptive conduct and the purchase or sale of a
security." Brief for United States 21 (emphasis added); see
also ibid. (the "misappropriated information had personal
value to respondent only because of its utility in securities
trading" (emphasis added)).

The Commission's construction of the relevant language
in $ 10(b), and the incoherence of that construction, become
evident as the majority attempts to describe why the fraudulent theft of information falls under the Commission's misappropriation theory, but the fraudulent theft of money does
not. The majority correctly notes that confidential information "qualifies as property to which the company has a right
of exclusive use." Ante, at 654. It then observes that the
"undisclosed misappropriation of such information, in violation of a fiduciary duty, . . . constitutes fraud akin to embezzlement--the fraudulent appropriation to one's own use of
the money or goods entrusted to one's care by another."

Opinion of Thomas, J.
Ibid. (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).1 Sofar the majority's analogy to embezzlement is well taken, and

adequately demonstrates that undisclosed misappropriationcan be a fraud on the source of the information.

What the embezzlement analogy does not do, however, isexplain how the relevant fraud is "use[d] or employ[ed], in
connection with" a securities transaction. And when themajority seeks to distinguish the embezzlement of funds
from the embezzlement of information, it becomes clear thatneither the Commission nor the majority has a coherent
theory regarding $ 10(b)'s "in connection with" requirement.Turning first to why embezzlement of information supposedly meets the "in connection with" requirement, the major-ity asserts that the requirement

"is satisfied because the fiduciary's fraud is consum-mated, not when the fiduciary gains the confidential information, but when, without disclosure to his principal,he uses the information to purchase or sell securities.
The securities transaction and the breach of duty thuscoincide." Ante, at 656.

The majority later notes, with apparent approval, the Gov-ernment's contention that the embezzlement of funds used to
purchase securities would not fall within the misappropria-tion theory. Ante, at 656-657 (citing Brief for United States
24, n. 13). The misappropriation of funds used for a securi-ties transaction is not covered by its theory, the Government
explains, because "the proceeds would have value to themalefactor apart from their use in a securities transaction,
and the fraud would be complete as soon as the money was

1 Of course, the "use" to which one puts misappropriated property need
not be one designed to bring profit to the misappropriator: Any "fraudulent appropriation to one's own use" constitutes embezzlement, regardless
of what the embezzler chooses to do with the money. See, e. g., Logan v.
State, 493 P. 2d 842, 846 (Okla. Crim. App. 1972) ("Any diversion of funds
held in trust constitutes embezzlement whether there is direct personal
benefit or not as long as the owner is deprived of his money").

obtained." Brief for United States 24, n. 13; see ante, at 656(quoting Government's explanation).

Accepting the Government's description of the scope of itsown theory, it becomes plain that the majority's explanation
of how the misappropriation theory supposedly satisfies the"in connection with" requirement is incomplete. The touchstone required for an embezzlement to be "use[d] or em-ploy[ed], in connection with" a securities transaction is not
merely that it "coincide" with, or be consummated by, thetransaction, but that it is

necessarily and only consummatedby the transaction. Where the property being embezzled

has value "apart from [its] use in a securities transaction"--even though it is in fact being used in a securities transaction--the Government contends that there is no violationunder the misappropriation theory.

My understanding of the Government's proffered theoryof liability, and its construction of the "in connection with"
requirement, is confirmed by the Government's explanationduring oral argument:

"[Court]: What if I appropriate some of my client'smoney in order to buy stock?

. . . . .
"[Court]: Have I violated the securities laws?"[Counsel]: I do not think that you have.

"[Court]: Why not? Isn't that in connection with thepurchase of securit[ies] just as much as this one is?
"[Counsel]: It's not just as much as this one is, becausein this case it is the use of the information that enables
the profits, pure and simple. There would be no oppor-tunity to engage in profit--

"[Court]: Same here. I didn't have the money. Theonly way I could buy this stock was to get the money.

. . . . .
"[Counsel]: The difference . . . is that once you havethe money you can do anything you want with it. In a

sense, the fraud is complete at that point, and then you

go on and you can use the money to finance any numberof other activities, but the connection is far less close

than in this case, where the only value of this informa-tion for personal profit for respondent was to take it
and profit in the securities markets by trading on it.. . . . .

"[Court]: So what you're saying is, is in this case themisappropriation can only be of relevance, or is of substantial relevance, is with reference to the purchase ofsecurities.

"[Counsel]: Exactly."[Court]: When you take the money out of the accounts you can go to the racetrack, or whatever."[Counsel]: That's exactly right, and because of that
difference, [there] can be no doubt that this kind of mis-appropriation of property is in connection with the purchase or sale of securities."Other kinds of misappropriation of property may or
may not, but this is a unique form of fraud, unique tothe securities markets, in fact, because

the only way inwhich respondent could have profited through this information is by either trading on it or by tipping some-body else to enable their trades." Tr. of Oral Arg. 16-19
(emphases added).
As the above exchange demonstrates, the relevant distinc-tion is not that the misappropriated information

was usedfor a securities transaction (the money example met that

test), but rather that it could only be used for such a transac-tion. See also id., at 6-7 (Government contention that the
misappropriation theory satisfies "the requisite connectionbetween the fraud and the securities trading, because it is
only in the trading that the fraud is consummated" (emphasisadded));

id., at 8 (same).The Government's construction of the "in connection with"

requirement--and its claim that such requirement precludescoverage of financial embezzlement--also demonstrates how

521US2 Unit: $U89 [11-20-99 15:31:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN

685Cite as: 521 U. S. 642 (1997)
Opinion of Thomas, J.
the majority's described distinction of financial embezzle-ment is incomplete. Although the majority claims that the

fraud in a financial embezzlement case is complete as soon asthe money is obtained, and before the securities transaction
is consummated, that is not uniformly true, and thus cannot
be the Government's basis for claiming that such embezzle-ment does not violate the securities laws. It is not difficult

to imagine an embezzlement of money that takes place viathe mechanism of a securities transaction--for example
where a broker is directed to purchase stock for a client andinstead purchases such stock--using client funds--for his
own account. The unauthorized (and presumably undisclosed) transaction is the very act that constitutes the embezzlement and the "securities transaction and the breach of
duty thus coincide." What presumably distinguishes monetary embezzlement for the Government is thus that it is not
necessarily coincident with a securities transaction, not that
it never lacks such a "connection."

Once the Government's construction of the misappropriation theory is accurately described and accepted--along with
its implied construction of $ 10(b)'s "in connection with" language--that theory should no longer cover cases, such as this
one, involving fraud on the source of information where the
source has no connection with the other participant in a securities transaction. It seems obvious that the undisclosed
misappropriation of confidential information is not necessarily consummated by a securities transaction. In this case,
for example, upon learning of Grand Met's confidential takeover plans, O'Hagan could have done any number of things
with the information: He could have sold it to a newspaper
for publication, see id., at 36; he could have given or sold the
information to Pillsbury itself, see id., at 37; or he could even
have kept the information and used it solely for his personal
amusement, perhaps in a fantasy stock trading game.

Any of these activities would have deprived Grand Met of
its right to "exclusive use," ante, at 654, of the information

521US2 Unit: $U89 [11-20-99 15:31:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN
686 UNITED STATES v. O'HAGAN

Opinion of Thomas, J.
and, if undisclosed, would constitute "embezzlement" ofGrand Met's informational property. Under any theory of

liability, however, these activities would not violate $ 10(b)and, according to the Commission's monetary embezzlement
analogy, these possibilities are sufficient to preclude a viola-tion under the misappropriation theory even where the informational property was used for securities trading. ThatO'Hagan actually did use the information to purchase securities is thus no more significant here than it is in the caseof embezzling money used to purchase securities. In both
cases the embezzler could have done something else with theproperty, and hence the Commission's necessary "connection" under the securities laws would not be met.2 If therelevant test under the "in connection with" language is
whether the fraudulent act is necessarily tied to a securitiestransaction, then the misappropriation of confidential information used to trade no more violates $ 10(b) than does themisappropriation of funds used to trade. As the Commission concedes that the latter is not covered under its theory,I am at a loss to see how the same theory can coherently be
applied to the former.3

2 Indeed, even if O'Hagan or someone else thereafter used the information to trade, the misappropriation would have been complete before the
trade and there should be no $ 10(b) liability. The most obvious realworld example of this scenario would be if O'Hagan had simply tipped
someone else to the information. The mere act of passing the information
along would have violated O'Hagan's fiduciary duty and, if undisclosed,
would be an "embezzlement" of the confidential information, regardless of
whether the tippee later traded on the information.

3 The majority is apparently unimpressed by the example of a misappropriator using embezzled information for personal amusement in a fantasy
stock trading game, finding no need for the Commission to "inhibit" such
recreational uses. Ante, at 657, n. 8. This argument, of course, misses
the point of the example. It is not that such a use does or should violate
the securities laws yet is not covered by the Commission's theory; rather,
the example shows that the misappropriation of information is not "only"
or "inherently" tied to securities trading, and hence the misappropriation

687Cite as: 521 U. S. 642 (1997)
Opinion of Thomas, J.
The majority makes no attempt to defend the misappropriation theory as set forth by the Commission. Indeed, the
majority implicitly concedes the indefensibility of the Commission's theory by acknowledging that alternative uses of
misappropriated information exist that do not violate the
securities laws and then dismissing the Government's repeated explanations of its misappropriation theory as mere
"overstatement." Ante, at 657. Having rejected the Government's description of its theory, the majority then engages in the "imaginative" exercise of constructing its own
misappropriation theory from whole cloth. Thus, we are
told, if we merely "[s]ubstitute `ordinarily' for `only' " when
describing the degree of connectedness between a misappropriation and a securities transaction, the Government would
have a winner. Ibid. Presumably, the majority would similarly edit the Government's brief to this Court to argue for
only an "ordinary," rather than an "inherent connection between the deceptive conduct and the purchase or sale of a
security." Brief for United States 21 (emphasis added).

I need not address the coherence, or lack thereof, of the
majority's new theory, for it suffers from a far greater, and
dispositive, flaw: It is not the theory offered by the Commission. Indeed, as far as we know from the majority's opinion,
this new theory has never been proposed by the Commission,
much less adopted by rule or otherwise. It is a fundamental
proposition of law that this Court "may not supply a reasoned basis for the agency's action that the agency itself has
not given." Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States,
Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463 U. S. 29,
43 (1983). We do not even credit a "post hoc rationalizatio[n]" of counsel for the agency, id., at 50, so one is left to
wonder how we could possibly rely on a post hoc rationalizaof information, whatever its ultimate use, fails the Commission's own test
under the "in connection with" requirement of $ 10(b) and Rule 10b-5.

tion invented by this Court and never even presented by the
Commission for our consideration.

Whether the majority's new theory has merit, we cannot
possibly tell on the record before us. There are no findings
regarding the "ordinary" use of misappropriated information, much less regarding the "ordinary" use of other forms
of embezzled property. The Commission has not opined on
the scope of the new requirement that property must "ordinarily" be used for securities trading in order for its misappropriation to be "in connection with" a securities transaction. We simply do not know what would or would not be
covered by such a requirement, and hence cannot evaluate
whether the requirement embodies a consistent and coherent
interpretation of the statute.4 Moreover, persons subject to

4 Similarly, the majority's assertion that the alternative uses of misappropriated information are not as profitable as use in securities trading,
ante, at 657, n. 8, is speculative at best. We have no idea what is the best
or most profitable use of misappropriated information, either in this case
or generally. We likewise have no idea what is the best use of other forms
of misappropriated property, and it is at least conceivable that the best
use of embezzled money, or securities themselves, is for securities trading.
If the use of embezzled money to purchase securities is "sufficiently detached," ante, at 657, from a securities transaction, then I see no reason
why the non-"inherent" use of information for securities trading is not also
"sufficiently detached" under the Government's theory. In any event, I
am at a loss to find in the statutory language any hint of a "best-use"
requirement for setting the requisite connection between deception and
the purchase or sale of securities.

The majority's further claim that it is unremarkable that "a rule suitably
applied to the fraudulent uses of certain kinds of information would be
stretched beyond reason were it applied to the fraudulent use of money,"
ibid., is itself remarkable given that the only existing "rule" is Rule 10b-5,
which nowhere confines itself to information and, indeed, does not even
contain the word. And given that the only "reason" offered by the Government in support of its misappropriation theory applies (or fails to
apply) equally to money or to information, the application of the Government's theory in this case is no less "beyond reason" than it would be as
applied to financial embezzlement.

Opinion of Thomas, J.
this new theory, such as respondent here, surely could notand cannot regulate their behavior to comply with the new

theory because, until today, the theory has never existed.In short, the majority's new theory is simply not presented
by this case, and cannot form the basis for upholding re-spondent's convictions.

In upholding respondent's convictions under the new andimproved misappropriation theory, the majority also points
to various policy considerations underlying the securitieslaws, such as maintaining fair and honest markets, promoting
investor confidence, and protecting the integrity of the secu-rities markets.

Ante, at 657, 658-659. But the repeatedreliance on such broad-sweeping legislative purposes reaches

too far and is misleading in the context of the misappropria-tion theory. It reaches too far in that, regardless of the
overarching purpose of the securities laws, it is not illegal torun afoul of the "purpose" of a statute, only its letter. The
majority's approach is misleading in this case because itglosses over the fact that the supposed threat to fair and
honest markets, investor confidence, and market integritycomes not from the supposed fraud in this case, but from
the mere fact that the information used by O'Hagan wasnonpublic.

As the majority concedes, because "the deception essentialto the misappropriation theory involves feigning fidelity to
the source of information, if the fiduciary discloses to the
source that he plans to trade on the nonpublic information,there is no `deceptive device' and thus no $ 10(b) violation."

Ante, at 655 (emphasis added). Indeed, were the source ex-pressly to authorize its agents to trade on the confidential
information--as a perk or bonus, perhaps--there would like-wise be no $ 10(b) violation.

5 Yet in either case--disclosed

misuse or authorized use--the hypothesized "inhibiting im-pact on market participation," ante, at 659, would be identical to that from behavior violating the misappropriation the-ory: "Outsiders" would still be trading based on nonpublic
information that the average investor has no hope of obtain-ing through his own diligence.

6

The majority's statement that a "misappropriator whotrades on the basis of material, nonpublic information, in

short, gains his advantageous market position through
deception; he deceives the source of the information andsimultaneously harms members of the investing public,"

ante, at 656 (emphasis added), thus focuses on the wrongpoint. Even if it is true that trading on nonpublic information hurts the public, it is true whether or not there is anydeception of the source of the information.

7 Moreover, as

that are going to appear in my Heard on the Street column, and the Wall
Street Journal said, that's fine, there would have been no deception of the
Wall Street Journal").

6 That the dishonesty aspect of misappropriation might be eliminated via

disclosure or authorization is wholly besides the point. The dishonesty in
misappropriation is in the relationship between the fiduciary and the principal, not in any relationship between the misappropriator and the market.
No market transaction is made more or less honest by disclosure to a
third-party principal, rather than to the market as a whole. As far as the
market is concerned, a trade based on confidential information is no more
"honest" because some third party may know of it so long as those on the
other side of the trade remain in the dark.

7 The majority's statement, by arguing that market advantage is gained

"through" deception, unfortunately seems to embrace an error in logic:
Conflating causation and correlation. That the misappropriator may both
deceive the source and "simultaneously" hurt the public no more shows a
causal "connection" between the two than the fact that the sun both gives
some people a tan and "simultaneously" nourishes plants demonstrates
that melanin production in humans causes plants to grow. In this case,
the only element common to the deception and the harm is that both are
the result of the same antecedent cause--namely, using nonpublic information. But such use, even for securities trading, is not illegal, and the consequential deception of the source follows an entirely divergent branch of
causation than does the harm to the public. The trader thus "gains his

Opinion of Thomas, J.
we have repeatedly held, use of nonpublic information to
trade is not itself a violation of $ 10(b). E. g., Chiarella, 445
U. S., at 232-233. Rather, it is the use of fraud "in connection with" a securities transaction that is forbidden. Where
the relevant element of fraud has no impact on the integrity
of the subsequent transactions as distinct from the nonfraudulent element of using nonpublic information, one can reasonably question whether the fraud was used in connection with
a securities transaction. And one can likewise question
whether removing that aspect of fraud, though perhaps laudable, has anything to do with the confidence or integrity of
the market.

The absence of a coherent and consistent misappropriation
theory and, by necessary implication, a coherent and consistent application of the statutory "use or employ, in connection
with" language, is particularly problematic in the context of
this case. The Government claims a remarkable breadth to
the delegation of authority in $ 10(b), arguing that "the very
aim of this section was to pick up unforeseen, cunning, deceptive devices that people might cleverly use in the securities
markets." Tr. of Oral Arg. 7. As the Court aptly queried,
"[t]hat's rather unusual, for a criminal statute to be that
open-ended, isn't it?" Ibid. Unusual indeed. Putting
aside the dubious validity of an open-ended delegation to an
independent agency to go forth and create regulations criminalizing "fraud," in this case we do not even have a formal
regulation embodying the agency's misappropriation theory.
Certainly Rule 10b-5 cannot be said to embody the theory--
although it deviates from the statutory language by the addition of the words "any person," it merely repeats, unchanged,

$ 10(b)'s "in connection with" language. Given that the validity of the misappropriation theory turns on the construcadvantageous market position through" the use of nonpublic information,
whether or not deception is involved; the deception has no effect on the
existence or extent of his advantage.

tion of that language in $ 10(b), the regulatory language issingularly uninformative.

8

Because we have no regulation squarely setting forthsome version of the misappropriation theory as the Commission's interpretation of the statutory language, we are leftwith little more than the Commission's litigating position or
the majority's completely novel theory that is not even ac-knowledged, much less adopted, by the Commission. As we
have noted before, such positions are not entitled to defer-ence and, at most, get such weight as their persuasiveness
warrants. Metropolitan Stevedore Co. v. Rambo, ante, at138, n. 9, 140, n. 10. Yet I find wholly unpersuasive a litigating position by the Commission that, at best, embodies aninconsistent and incoherent interpretation of the relevant
statutory language and that does not provide any predictableguidance as to what behavior contravenes the statute. That
position is no better than an ad hoc interpretation of statu-tory language and in my view can provide no basis for
liability. II

I am also of the view that O'Hagan's conviction for violat-ing Rule 14e-3(a) cannot stand. Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act provides, in relevant part:

"It shall be unlawful for any person . . . to engage inany fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative acts or practices, in connection with any tender offer . . . . TheCommission shall, for the purposes of this subsection,
by rules and regulations define, and prescribe means
8 That the Commission may purport to be interpreting its own Rule,
rather than the statute, cannot provide it any greater leeway where the
Rule merely repeats verbatim the statutory language on which the entire
question hinges. Furthermore, as even the majority recognizes, Rule
10b-5 may not reach beyond the scope of $ 10(b), ante, at 651, and thus
the Commission is obligated to explain how its theory fits within its interpretation of $ 10(b) even if it purports to be interpreting its own derivative rule.

As the majority acknowledges, Rule 14e-3(a) prohibits a
broad range of behavior regardless of whether such behavior
is fraudulent under our precedents. See ante, at 669 (Rule
applies " `without regard to whether the trader owes a preexisting fiduciary duty to respect the confidentiality of the
information' " (emphasis deleted)) (quoting United States v.
Chestman, 947 F. 2d 551, 557 (CA2 1991) (en banc), cert.

694 UNITED STATES v. O'HAGAN

Opinion of Thomas, J.
The Commission offers two grounds in defense of Rule14e-3(a). First, it argues that $ 14(e) delegates to the Commission the authority to "define" fraud differently than thatconcept has been defined by this Court, and that Rule 14e-
3(a) is a valid exercise of that "defining" power. Second, itargues that $ 14(e) authorizes the Commission to "prescribe
means reasonably designed to prevent" fraudulent acts, andthat Rule 14e-3(a) is a prophylactic rule that may prohibit
nonfraudulent acts as a means of preventing fraudulent actsthat are difficult to detect or prove.

The majority declines to reach the Commission's first justi-fication, instead sustaining Rule 14e-3(a) on the ground that

"under $ 14(e), the Commission may prohibit acts notthemselves fraudulent under the common law or $ 10(b),
if the prohibition is `reasonably designed to prevent . . .acts and practices [that] are fraudulent.' " Ante, at 673
(quoting 15 U. S. C. $ 78n(e)).
According to the majority, prohibiting trading on nonpublicinformation is necessary to prevent such supposedly hardto-prove fraudulent acts and practices as trading on informa-tion obtained from the buyer in breach of a fiduciary duty,
ante, at 675, and possibly "warehousing," whereby the buyertips allies prior to announcing the tender offer and encourages them to purchase the target company's stock, ante, at672-673, n. 17.

I find neither of the Commission's justifications for Rule14e-3(a) acceptable in misappropriation cases. With regard

to the Commission's claim of authority to redefine the con-cept of fraud, I agree with the Eighth Circuit that the Commission misreads the relevant provision of $ 14(e).

9 Although the majority leaves open the possibility that Rule 14e-3(a)
may be justified as a means of preventing "warehousing," it does not rely
on that justification to support its conclusion in this case. Suffice it to say
that the Commission itself concedes that warehousing does not involve
fraud as defined by our cases, see Reply Brief for United States 17, and
thus preventing warehousing cannot serve to justify Rule 14e-3(a).

Opinion of Thomas, J.
"Simply put, the enabling provision of $ 14(e) permits
the SEC to identify and regulate those `acts and practices' which fall within the $ 14(e) legal definition of
`fraudulent,' but it does not grant the SEC a license to
redefine the term." 92 F. 3d 612, 624 (1996).

This conclusion follows easily from our similar statement in
Schreiber v. Burlington Northern, Inc., 472 U. S. 1, 11, n. 11
(1985), that $ 14(e) gives the "Commission latitude to regulate nondeceptive activities as a `reasonably designed' means
of preventing manipulative acts, without suggesting any
change in the meaning of the term `manipulative' itself."

Insofar as the Rule 14e-3(a) purports to "define" acts and
practices that "are fraudulent," it must be measured against
our precedents interpreting the scope of fraud. The majority concedes, however, that Rule 14e-3(a) does not prohibit
merely trading in connection with fraudulent nondisclosure,
but rather it prohibits trading in connection with any nondisclosure, regardless of the presence of a pre-existing duty to
disclose. Ante, at 669. The Rule thus exceeds the scope of
the Commission's authority to define such acts and practices
as "are fraudulent." 10

10 Even were $ 14(e)'s defining authority subject to the construction
given it by the Commission, there are strong constitutional reasons for
not so construing it. A law that simply stated "it shall be unlawful to do
`X', however `X' shall be defined by an independent agency," would seem
to offer no "intelligible principle" to guide the agency's discretion and
would thus raise very serious delegation concerns, even under our current
jurisprudence, J. W. Hampton, Jr., & Co. v. United States, 276 U. S. 394,
409 (1928). See also Field v. Clark, 143 U. S. 649, 693-694 (1892) (distinguishing between making the law by determining what it shall be, and
executing the law by determining facts on which the law's operation depends). The Commission's interpretation of $ 14(e) would convert it into
precisely the type of law just described. Thus, even if that were a plausible interpretation, our usual practice is to avoid unnecessary interpretations of statutory language that call the constitutionality of the statute
into further serious doubt.

696 UNITED STATES v. O'HAGAN

Opinion of Thomas, J.
Turning to the Commission's second justification for Rule14e-3(a), although I can agree with the majority that $ 14(e)

authorizes the Commission to prohibit nonfraudulent acts asa means reasonably designed to prevent fraudulent ones, I
cannot agree that Rule 14e-3(a) satisfies this standard. As
an initial matter, the Rule, on its face, does not purport tobe an exercise of the Commission's prophylactic power, but

rather a redefinition of what "constitute[s] a fraudulent, de-ceptive, or manipulative act or practice within the meaning
of $ 14(e)." That Rule 14e-3(a) could have been "conceivedand defended, alternatively, as definitional or preventive,"
ante, at 674, n. 19, misses the point. We evaluate regulations
not based on the myriad of explanations that could have been
given by the relevant agency, but on those explanations and
justifications that were, in fact, given. See State Farm, 463
U. S., at 43, 50. Rule 14e-3(a) may not be "[s]ensibly read"
as an exercise of "preventive" authority, ante, at 674, n. 19; it
can only be differently so read, contrary to its own terms.

Having already concluded that the Commission lacks the
power to redefine fraud, the regulation cannot be sustained
on its own reasoning. This would seem a complete answer
to whether the Rule is valid because, while we might give
deference to the Commission's regulatory constructions of

$ 14(e), the reasoning used by the regulation itself is in this
instance contrary to law and we need give no deference to
the Commission's post hoc litigating justifications not reflected in the regulation.

Even on its own merits, the Commission's prophylactic justification fails. In order to be a valid prophylactic regulation, Rule 14e-3(a) must be reasonably designed not merely
to prevent any fraud, but to prevent persons from engaging
in "fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative acts or practices,
in connection with any tender offer." 15 U. S. C. $ 78n(e)
(emphasis added). Insofar as Rule 14e-3(a) is designed to
prevent the type of misappropriation at issue in this case,
such acts are not legitimate objects of prevention because

Opinion of Thomas, J.
the Commission's misappropriation theory does not repre-sent a coherent interpretation of the statutory "in connection

with" requirement, as explained in Part I, supra. Evenassuming that a person misappropriating information from
the bidder commits fraud on the bidder, the Commission has
provided no coherent or consistent explanation as to whysuch fraud is "in connection with" a tender offer, and thus

the Commission may not seek to prevent indirectly con-duct which it could not, under its current theory, prohibit
directly.11Finally, even further assuming that the Commission's misappropriation theory is a valid basis for direct liability, I failto see how Rule 14e-3(a)'s elimination of the requirement of
a breach of fiduciary duty is "reasonably designed" to pre-vent the underlying "fraudulent" acts. The majority's primary argument on this score is that in many cases " `a breachof duty is likely but difficult to prove.' "

Ante, at 674 (quoting Reply Brief for United States 16). Although the majority's hypothetical difficulties involved in a tipper-tippee situation might have some merit in the context of "classical"
insider trading, there is no reason to suspect similar difficulties in "misappropriation" cases. In such cases, Rule 14e-
3(a) requires the Commission to prove that the defendant
"knows or has reason to know" that the nonpublic information upon which trading occurred came from the bidder or
an agent of the bidder. Once the source of the information
has been identified, it should be a simple task to obtain proof
of any breach of duty. After all, it is the bidder itself that
was defrauded in misappropriation cases, and there is no rea11 I note that Rule 14e-3(a) also applies to persons trading upon information obtained from an insider of the target company. Insofar as the Rule
seeks to prevent behavior that would be fraudulent under the "classical
theory" of insider trading, this aspect of my analysis would not apply. As
the majority notes, however, the Government "could not have prosecuted
O'Hagan under the classical theory," ante, at 653, n. 5, hence this proviso
has no application to the present case.

Opinion of Thomas, J.
son to suspect that the victim of the fraud would be reluctantto provide evidence against the perpetrator of the fraud.

12

There being no particular difficulties in proving a breach ofduty in such circumstances, a rule removing the requirement

of such a breach cannot be said to be "reasonably designed"to prevent underlying violations of the misappropriation
theory.What Rule 14e-3(a) was in fact "designed" to do can be
seen from the remainder of the majority's discussion of theRule. Quoting at length from the Commission's explanation
of the Rule in the Federal Register, the majority notes theCommission's concern with " `unfair disparities in market information and market disruption.' " Ante, at 674 (quoting45 Fed. Reg. 60412 (1980)). In the Commission's further explanation of Rule 14e-3(a)'s purpose--continuing the para-graph partially quoted by the majority--an example of the
problem to be addressed is the so-called "stampede effect"

12 Even where the information is obtained from an agent of the bidder,
and the tippee claims not to have known that the tipper violated a duty,
there is still no justification for Rule 14e-3(a). First, in such circumstances the tipper himself would have violated his fiduciary duty and
would be liable under the misappropriation theory, assuming that theory
were valid. Facing such liability, there is no reason to suspect that the
tipper would gratuitously protect the tippee. And if the tipper accurately
testifies that the tippee was (falsely) told that the information was passed
on without violating the tipper's own duties, one can question whether
the tippee has in fact done anything illegal, even under the Commission's
misappropriation theory. Given that the fraudulent breach of fiduciary
duty would have been complete at the moment of the tip, the subsequent
trading on that information by the tippee might well fail even the Commission's own construction of the "in connection with" requirement. See
supra, at 683-687. Thus, even if the tipper might, in some circumstances,
be inclined to protect the tippee, see ante, at 675-676, n. 20, it is doubtful
that the tippee would have violated the misappropriation theory in any
event, and thus preventing such nonviolations cannot justify Rule 14e-
3(a). Second, even were this scenario a legitimate concern, it would at
most justify eliminating the requirement that the tippee "know" about the
breach of duty. It would not explain Rule 14e-3(a)'s elimination of the
requirement that there be such a breach.

based on leaks and rumors that may result from trading onmaterial, nonpublic information.

Id., at 60413. The majority also notes (but does not rely on) the Government's con-tention that it would not be able to prohibit the supposedly

problematic practice of "warehousing"--a bidder intentionally tipping allies to buy stock in advance of a bid announce-ment--if a breach of fiduciary duty were required.

Ante, at
672-673, n. 17 (citing Reply Brief for United States 17).Given these policy concerns, the majority notes with seeming

approval the Commission's justification of Rule 14e-3(a) "asa means necessary and proper to assure the efficacy of Williams Act protections." Ante, at 674.

Although this reasoning no doubt accurately reflects the
Commission's purposes in adopting Rule 14e-3(a), it does little to support the validity of that Rule as a means designed
to prevent such behavior: None of the above-described acts
involve breaches of fiduciary duties, hence a Rule designed
to prevent them does not satisfy $ 14(e)'s requirement that
the Commission's Rules promulgated under that section be
"reasonably designed to prevent" acts and practices that "are
fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative." As the majority itself recognizes, there is no " `general duty between all participants in market transactions to forgo actions based on material, nonpublic information,' " and such duty only " `arises
from a specific relationship between two parties.' " Ante, at
661 (quoting Chiarella, 445 U. S., at 233). Unfair disparities
in market information, and the potential "stampede effect"
of leaks, do not necessarily involve a breach of any duty to
anyone, and thus are not proper objects for regulation in the
name of "fraud" under $ 14(e). Likewise (as the Government
concedes, Reply Brief for United States 17), "warehousing"
is not fraudulent given that the tippees are using the information with the express knowledge and approval of the
source of the information. There simply would be no deception in violation of a duty to disclose under such circumstances. Cf. ante, at 654-655 (noting Government's conces521US2 Unit: $U89 [11-20-99 15:31:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of Thomas, J.
sion that use of bidder's information with bidder's knowledgeis not fraudulent under misappropriation theory).

While enhancing the overall efficacy of the Williams Actmay be a reasonable goal, it is not one that may be pursued
through $ 14(e), which limits its grant of rulemaking author-ity to the prevention of fraud, deceit, and manipulation. As
we have held in the context of $ 10(b), "not every instanceof financial unfairness constitutes fraudulent activity."
Chiarella, supra, at 232. Because, in the context of misap-propriation cases, Rule 14e-3(a) is not a means "reasonably
designed" to prevent persons from engaging in fraud "in con-nection with" a tender offer, it exceeds the Commission's
authority under $ 14(e), and respondent's conviction for vio-lation of that Rule cannot be sustained.

III
With regard to respondent's convictions on the mail fraudcounts, my view is that they may be sustained regardless of

whether respondent may be convicted of the securities fraudcounts. Although the issue is highly fact bound, and not independently worthy of plenary consideration by this Court,we have nonetheless accepted the issue for review and therefore I will endeavor to resolve it.As I read the indictment, it does not materially differ from
the indictment in Carpenter v. United States, 484 U. S. 19(1987). There, the Court was unanimous in upholding the
mail fraud conviction, id., at 28, despite being evenly dividedon the securities fraud counts,

id., at 24. I do not think thewording of the indictment in the current case requires a

finding of securities fraud in order to find mail fraud. Cer-tainly the jury instructions do not make the mail fraud count
dependent on the securities fraud counts. Rather, the
counts were simply predicated on the same factual basis,and just because those facts are legally insufficient to constitute securities fraud does not make them legally insufficient

Opinion of Thomas, J.
to constitute mail fraud.13 I therefore concur in the judg-ment of the Court as it relates to respondent's mail fraud

convictions.

13 While the majority may find it strange that the "mail fraud net" is
broader reaching than the securities fraud net, ante, at 678, n. 25, any
such supposed strangeness--and the resulting allocation of prosecutorial
responsibility between the Commission and the various United States Attorneys--is no business of this Court, and can be adequately addressed by
Congress if it too perceives a problem regarding jurisdictional boundaries
among the Nation's prosecutors. That the majority believes that, upon
shifting from securities fraud to mail fraud prosecutions, the "practical
consequences for individual defendants might not be large," ibid., both
undermines the supposed policy justifications for today's decision and
makes more baffling the majority's willingness to go to such great lengths
to save the Commission from itself.

WASHINGTON et al. v. GLUCKSBERG et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 96-110. Argued January 8, 1997--Decided June 26, 1997
It has always been a crime to assist a suicide in the State of Washington.

The State's present law makes "[p]romoting a suicide attempt" a felony,
and provides: "A person is guilty of [that crime] when he knowingly
causes or aids another person to attempt suicide." Respondents, four
Washington physicians who occasionally treat terminally ill, suffering
patients, declare that they would assist these patients in ending their
lives if not for the State's assisted-suicide ban. They, along with three
gravely ill plaintiffs who have since died and a nonprofit organization
that counsels people considering physician-assisted suicide, filed this suit
against petitioners, the State and its Attorney General, seeking a declaration that the ban is, on its face, unconstitutional. They assert a liberty interest protected by the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process
Clause which extends to a personal choice by a mentally competent,
terminally ill adult to commit physician-assisted suicide. Relying primarily on Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S.
833, and Cruzan v. Director, Mo. Dept. of Health, 497 U. S. 261, the
Federal District Court agreed, concluding that Washington's assistedsuicide ban is unconstitutional because it places an undue burden on the
exercise of that constitutionally protected liberty interest. The en banc
Ninth Circuit affirmed.

Held: Washington's prohibition against "caus[ing]" or "aid[ing]" a suicide

does not violate the Due Process Clause. Pp. 710-736.

(a) An examination of our Nation's history, legal traditions, and practices demonstrates that Anglo-American common law has punished or
otherwise disapproved of assisting suicide for over 700 years; that rendering such assistance is still a crime in almost every State; that such
prohibitions have never contained exceptions for those who were near
death; that the prohibitions have in recent years been reexamined and,
for the most part, reaffirmed in a number of States; and that the President recently signed the Federal Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction
Act of 1997, which prohibits the use of federal funds in support of
physician-assisted suicide. Pp. 710-719.

(b) In light of that history, this Court's decisions lead to the conclusion
that respondents' asserted "right" to assistance in committing suicide is
not a fundamental liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause.

Syllabus
The Court's established method of substantive-due-process analysis has
two primary features: First, the Court has regularly observed that the
Clause specially protects those fundamental rights and liberties which
are, objectively, deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition.
E. g., Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U. S. 494, 503 (plurality opinion).
Second, the Court has required a "careful description" of the asserted
fundamental liberty interest. E. g., Reno v. Flores, 507 U. S. 292, 302.
The Ninth Circuit's and respondents' various descriptions of the interest
here at stake--e. g., a right to "determin[e] the time and manner of one's
death," the "right to die," a "liberty to choose how to die," a right to
"control of one's final days," "the right to choose a humane, dignified
death," and "the liberty to shape death"--run counter to that second
requirement. Since the Washington statute prohibits "aid[ing] another
person to attempt suicide," the question before the Court is more properly characterized as whether the "liberty" specially protected by the
Clause includes a right to commit suicide which itself includes a right to
assistance in doing so. This asserted right has no place in our Nation's
traditions, given the country's consistent, almost universal, and continuing rejection of the right, even for terminally ill, mentally competent
adults. To hold for respondents, the Court would have to reverse centuries of legal doctrine and practice, and strike down the considered
policy choice of almost every State. Respondents' contention that the
asserted interest is consistent with this Court's substantive-due-process
cases, if not with this Nation's history and practice, is unpersuasive.
The constitutionally protected right to refuse lifesaving hydration and
nutrition that was discussed in Cruzan, supra, at 279, was not simply
deduced from abstract concepts of personal autonomy, but was instead
grounded in the Nation's history and traditions, given the common-law
rule that forced medication was a battery, and the long legal tradition
protecting the decision to refuse unwanted medical treatment. And although Casey recognized that many of the rights and liberties protected
by the Due Process Clause sound in personal autonomy, 505 U. S., at
852, it does not follow that any and all important, intimate, and personal
decisions are so protected, see San Antonio Independent School Dist.
v. Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 1, 33-34. Casey did not suggest otherwise.
Pp. 719-728.

(c) The constitutional requirement that Washington's assisted-suicide
ban be rationally related to legitimate government interests, see, e. g.,
Heller v. Doe, 509 U. S. 312, 319-320, is unquestionably met here.
These interests include prohibiting intentional killing and preserving
human life; preventing the serious public-health problem of suicide, especially among the young, the elderly, and those suffering from untreated pain or from depression or other mental disorders; protecting

the medical profession's integrity and ethics and maintaining physicians'
role as their patients' healers; protecting the poor, the elderly, disabled
persons, the terminally ill, and persons in other vulnerable groups from
indifference, prejudice, and psychological and financial pressure to end
their lives; and avoiding a possible slide toward voluntary and perhaps
even involuntary euthanasia. The relative strengths of these various
interests need not be weighed exactingly, since they are unquestionably
important and legitimate, and the law at issue is at least reasonably
related to their promotion and protection. Pp. 728-735.

1 Today, Washington law provides: "A person

is guilty of promoting a suicide attempt when he knowinglycauses or aids another person to attempt suicide." Wash.

Rev. Code $ 9A.36.060(1) (1994). "Promoting a suicide at-tempt" is a felony, punishable by up to five years' imprisonment and up to a $10,000 fine. $$ 9A.36.060(2) and9A.20.021(1)(c). At the same time, Washington's Natural
Death Act, enacted in 1979, states that the "withholding orwithdrawal of life-sustaining treatment" at a patient's direction "shall not, for any purpose, constitute a suicide." Wash.Rev. Code $ 70.122.070(1).

Petitioners in this case are the State of Washington and itsAttorney General. Respondents Harold Glucksberg, M. D.,

Abigail Halperin, M. D., Thomas A. Preston, M. D., and PeterShalit, M. D., are physicians who practice in Washington.
These doctors occasionally treat terminally ill, suffering pa-tients, and declare that they would assist these patients in

708 WASHINGTON v. GLUCKSBERG

Opinion of the Court
Compassion in Dying, a nonprofit organization that counselspeople considering physician-assisted suicide, sued in the

United States District Court, seeking a declaration thatWash. Rev. Code $ 9A.36.060(1) (1994) is, on its face, unconstitutional. Compassion in Dying v. Washington, 850 F. Supp.1454, 1459 (WD Wash. 1994).

4

The plaintiffs asserted "the existence of a liberty interestprotected by the Fourteenth Amendment which extends to

a personal choice by a mentally competent, terminally illadult to commit physician-assisted suicide."

Ibid. Relyingprimarily on Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v.

Casey, 505 U. S. 833 (1992), and Cruzan v. Director, Mo.Dept. of Health, 497 U. S. 261 (1990), the District Court
agreed, 850 F. Supp., at 1459-1462, and concluded that Wash-ington's assisted-suicide ban is unconstitutional because it
"places an undue burden on the exercise of [that] constitutionally protected liberty interest." Id., at 1465.5 The Dis-trict Court also decided that the Washington statute violated

the Equal Protection Clause's requirement that " `all personssimilarly situated . . . be treated alike.' "

Id., at 1466 (quoting Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc., 473 U. S. 432,439 (1985)).

A panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit re-versed, emphasizing that "[i]n the two hundred and five
years of our existence no constitutional right to aid in killing

were then in the terminal phases of serious and painful illnesses. They
declared that they were mentally competent and desired assistance in ending their lives. Declaration of Jane Roe, id., at 23-25; Declaration of John
Doe, id., at 27-28; Declaration of James Poe, id., at 30-31; Compassion in
Dying, 850 F. Supp., at 1456-1457.

5 The District Court determined that Casey's "undue burden" standard,

505 U. S., at 874 (joint opinion), not the standard from United States v.
Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 745 (1987) (requiring a showing that "no set of
circumstances exists under which the [law] would be valid"), governed
the plaintiffs' facial challenge to the assisted-suicide ban. 850 F. Supp.,
at 1462-1464.

oneself has ever been asserted and upheld by a court of finaljurisdiction." Compassion in Dying v. Washington, 49 F.

3d 586, 591 (1995). The Ninth Circuit reheard the case enbanc, reversed the panel's decision, and affirmed the District
Court. Compassion in Dying v. Washington, 79 F. 3d 790,798 (1996). Like the District Court, the en banc Court of
Appeals emphasized our Casey and Cruzan decisions. 79F. 3d, at 813-816. The court also discussed what it described as "historical" and "current societal attitudes" to-ward suicide and assisted suicide,

id., at 806-812, and con-cluded that "the Constitution encompasses a due process

liberty interest in controlling the time and manner of one'sdeath--that there is, in short, a constitutionally-recognized
`right to die.' " Id., at 816. After "[w]eighing and then bal-ancing" this interest against Washington's various interests,
the court held that the State's assisted-suicide ban was un-constitutional "as applied to terminally ill competent adults
who wish to hasten their deaths with medication prescribedby their physicians."

Id., at 836, 837.6 The court did notreach the District Court's equal protection holding. Id., at

838.7 We granted certiorari, 518 U. S. 1057 (1996), and nowreverse.

6 Although, as Justice Stevens observes, post, at 739 (opinion concurring in judgments), "[the court's] analysis and eventual holding that the
statute was unconstitutional was not limited to a particular set of plaintiffs
before it," the court did note that "[d]eclaring a statute unconstitutional
as applied to members of a group is atypical but not uncommon." 79
F. 3d, at 798, n. 9, and emphasized that it was "not deciding the facial
validity of [the Washington statute]," id., at 797-798, and nn. 8-9. It is
therefore the court's holding that Washington's physician-assisted suicide
statute is unconstitutional as applied to the "class of terminally ill, mentally competent patients," post, at 750 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgments), that is before us today.

7 The Court of Appeals did note, however, that "the equal protection

argument relied on by [the District Court] is not insubstantial," 79 F. 3d,
at 838, n. 139, and sharply criticized the opinion in a separate case then
pending before the Ninth Circuit, Lee v. Oregon, 891 F. Supp. 1429 (Ore.

Opinion of the Court

I
We begin, as we do in all due process cases, by examining
our Nation's history, legal traditions, and practices. See,
e. g., Casey, supra, at 849-850; Cruzan, supra, at 269-279;
Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U. S. 494, 503 (1977) (plurality
opinion) (noting importance of "careful `respect for the teachings of history' "). In almost every State--indeed, in almost
every western democracy--it is a crime to assist a suicide.8
The States' assisted-suicide bans are not innovati ons.
Rather, they are longstanding expressions of the States'
commitment to the protection and preservation of all human
life. Cruzan, supra, at 280 ("[T]he States--indeed, all civilized nations--demonstrate their commitment to life by
treating homicide as a serious crime. Moreover, the majorsuicide, violates the Equal Protection Clause because it does not provide
adequate safeguards against abuse), vacated, Lee v. Oregon, 107 F. 3d 1382
(CA9 1997) (concluding that plaintiffs lacked Article III standing). Lee,
of course, is not before us, any more than it was before the Court of Appeals below, and we offer no opinion as to the validity of the Lee courts'
reasoning. In Vacco v. Quill, post, p. 793, however, decided today, we
hold that New York's assisted-suicide ban does not violate the Equal Protection Clause.

8 See Compassion in Dying v. Washington, 79 F. 3d 790, 847, and

nn. 10-13 (CA9 1996) (Beezer, J., dissenting) ("In total, forty-four states,

suicide") (citing statutes and cases); Rodriguez v. British Columbia (Attorney General), 107 D. L. R. (4th) 342, 404 (Can. 1993) ("[A] blanket prohibition on assisted suicide . . . is the norm among western democracies")
(discussing assisted-suicide provisions in Austria, Spain, Italy, the United
Kingdom, the Netherlands, Denmark, Switzerland, and France). Since

enacted statutory assisted-suicide bans. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 14:32.12

Stanford v. Kentucky, 492 U. S. 361, 373 (1989) ("[T]he pri-mary and most reliable indication of [a national] consensus is
. . . the pattern of enacted laws"). Indeed, opposition to and
condemnation of suicide--and, therefore, of assisting suicide--are consistent and enduring themes of our philosophical, legal, and cultural heritages. See generally Marzen
17-56; New York State Task Force on Life and the Law,
When Death is Sought: Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia in
the Medical Context 77-82 (May 1994) (hereinafter New
York Task Force).

More specifically, for over 700 years, the Anglo-American
common-law tradition has punished or otherwise disapproved of both suicide and assisting suicide.9 Cruzan, 497
U. S., at 294-295 (Scalia, J., concurring). In the 13th century, Henry de Bracton, one of the first legal-treatise writers,
observed that "[ j]ust as a man may commit felony by slaying
another so may he do so by slaying himself." 2 Bracton on
Laws and Customs of England 423 (f. 150) (G. Woodbine ed.,
S. Thorne transl., 1968). The real and personal property of
one who killed himself to avoid conviction and punishment
for a crime were forfeit to the King; however, thought Bracton, "if a man slays himself in weariness of life or because
he is unwilling to endure further bodily pain . . . [only] his
movable goods [were] confiscated." Id., at 423-424 (f. 150).
Thus, "[t]he principle that suicide of a sane person, for whatever reason, was a punishable felony was . . . introduced into

9 The common law is thought to have emerged through the expansion
of pre-Norman institutions sometime in the 12th century. J. Baker, An
Introduction to English Legal History 11 (2d ed. 1979). England adopted
the ecclesiastical prohibition on suicide five centuries earlier, in the year
673 at the Council of Hereford, and this prohibition was reaffirmed by
King Edgar in 967. See G. Williams, The Sanctity of Life and the Criminal Law 257 (1957).

English common law." 10 Centuries later, Sir William Black-stone, whose Commentaries on the Laws of England not only

provided a definitive summary of the common law but wasalso a primary legal authority for 18th- and 19th-century
American lawyers, referred to suicide as "self-murder" and
"the pretended heroism, but real cowardice, of the Stoicphilosophers, who destroyed themselves to avoid those

ills which they had not the fortitude to endure . . . ." 4W. Blackstone, Commentaries *189. Blackstone emphasized
that "the law has . . . ranked [suicide] among the highestcrimes,"

ibid., although, anticipating later developments, he
conceded that the harsh and shameful punishments imposedfor suicide "borde[r] a little upon severity."

Id., at *190.
For the most part, the early American Colonies adopted
the common-law approach. For example, the legislators ofthe Providence Plantations, which would later become Rhode

Island, declared, in 1647, that "[s]elf-murder is by all agreed
to be the most unnatural, and it is by this present Assembly
declared, to be that, wherein he that doth it, kills himself out

10 Marzen 59. Other late-medieval treatise writers followed and restated Bracton; one observed that "man-slaughter" may be "[o]f [one]self;
as in case, when people hang themselves or hurt themselves, or otherwise
kill themselves of their own felony" or "[o]f others; as by beating, famine,
or other punishment; in like cases, all are man-slayers." A. Horne, The
Mirrour of Justices, ch. 1, $ 9, pp. 41-42 (W. Robinson ed. 1903). By the
mid-16th century, the Court at Common Bench could observe that "[suicide] is an Offence against Nature, against God, and against the King. . . .
[T]o destroy one's self is contrary to Nature, and a Thing most horrible."
Hales v. Petit, 1 Plowd. Com. 253, 261, 75 Eng. Rep. 387, 400 (1561-1562).

In 1644, Sir Edward Coke published his Third Institute, a lodestar for
later common lawyers. See T. Plucknett, A Concise History of the Common Law 281-284 (5th ed. 1956). Coke regarded suicide as a category of
murder, and agreed with Bracton that the goods and chattels--but not,
for Coke, the lands--of a sane suicide were forfeit. 3 E. Coke, Institutes
*54. William Hawkins, in his 1716 Treatise of the Pleas of the Crown,
followed Coke, observing that "our laws have always had . . . an abhorrence of this crime." 1 W. Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown, ch. 27, $ 4, p. 164
(T. Leach ed. 1795).

of a premeditated hatred against his own life or other humor:. . . his goods and chattels are the king's custom, but not his

debts nor lands; but in case he be an infant, a lunatic, mador distracted man, he forfeits nothing." The Earliest Acts
and Laws of the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence
Plantations 1647-1719, p. 19 (J. Cushing ed. 1977). Virginiaalso required ignominious burial for suicides, and their estates were forfeit to the Crown. A. Scott, Criminal Law inColonial Virginia 108, and n. 93, 198, and n. 15 (1930).

Over time, however, the American Colonies abolishedthese harsh common-law penalties. William Penn abandoned the criminal-forfeiture sanction in Pennsylvania in1701, and the other Colonies (and later, the other States)
eventually followed this example. Cruzan, supra, at 294
(Scalia, J., concurring). Zephaniah Swift, who would laterbecome Chief Justice of Connecticut, wrote in 1796:

"There can be no act more contemptible, than to attempt
to punish an offender for a crime, by exercising a mean
act of revenge upon lifeless clay, that is insensible of thepunishment. There can be no greater cruelty, than the

inflicting [of] a punishment, as the forfeiture of goods,which must fall solely on the innocent offspring of the
offender. . . . [Suicide] is so abhorrent to the feelings ofmankind, and that strong love of life which is implanted
in the human heart, that it cannot be so frequently com-mitted, as to become dangerous to society. There can
of course be no necessity of any punishment." 2 Z.
Swift, A System of the Laws of the State of Connecticut304 (1796).

This statement makes it clear, however, that the movement
away from the common law's harsh sanctions did not represent an acceptance of suicide; rather, as Chief Justice Swift
observed, this change reflected the growing consensus that it
was unfair to punish the suicide's family for his wrongdoing.

Opinion of the Court
less, although States moved away from Blackstone's treat-ment of suicide, courts continued to condemn it as a grave

public wrong. See, e. g., Bigelow v. Berkshire Life Ins. Co.,93 U. S. 284, 286 (1876) (suicide is "an act of criminal selfdestruction"); Von Holden v. Chapman, 87 App. Div. 2d 66,
70-71, 450 N. Y. S. 2d 623, 626-627 (1982); Blackwood v.
Jones, 111 Fla. 528, 532, 149 So. 600, 601 (1933) ("No sophistry is tolerated . . . which seek[s] to justify self-destructionas commendable or even a matter of personal right").

That suicide remained a grievous, though nonfelonious,wrong is confirmed by the fact that colonial and early state
legislatures and courts did not retreat from prohibiting assisting suicide. Swift, in his early 19th-century treatise on
the laws of Connecticut, stated that "[i]f one counsels another
to commit suicide, and the other by reason of the advice kills
himself, the advisor is guilty of murder as principal." 2 Z.
Swift, A Digest of the Laws of the State of Connecticut 270
(1823). This was the well-established common-law view, see
In re Joseph G., 34 Cal. 3d 429, 434-435, 667 P. 2d 1176, 1179
(1983); Commonwealth v. Mink, 123 Mass. 422, 428 (1877)
(" `Now if the murder of one's self is felony, the accessory is
equally guilty as if he had aided and abetted in the murder' ")
(quoting Chief Justice Parker's charge to the jury in Commonwealth v. Bowen, 13 Mass. 356 (1816)), as was the similar
principle that the consent of a homicide victim is "wholly
immaterial to the guilt of the person who cause[d] [his
death]," 3 J. Stephen, A History of the Criminal Law of England 16 (1883); see 1 F. Wharton, Criminal Law $$ 451-452
(9th ed. 1885); Martin v. Commonwealth, 184 Va. 1009, 1018-
1019, 37 S. E. 2d 43, 47 (1946) (" `The right to life and to
personal security is not only sacred in the estimation of the
common law, but it is inalienable' "). And the prohibitions
against assisting suicide never contained exceptions for those
who were near death. Rather, "[t]he life of those to whom
life ha[d] become a burden--of those who [were] hopelessly
diseased or fatally wounded--nay, even the lives of criminals

condemned to death, [were] under the protection of the law,
equally as the lives of those who [were] in the full tide of life's
enjoyment, and anxious to continue to live." Blackburn v.
State, 23 Ohio St. 146, 163 (1872); see Bowen, supra, at 360
(prisoner who persuaded another to commit suicide could be
tried for murder, even though victim was scheduled shortly
to be executed).

The earliest American statute explicitly to outlaw assisting suicide was enacted in New York in 1828, Act of Dec. 10,
1828, ch. 20, $ 4, 1828 N. Y. Laws 19 (codified at 2 N. Y. Rev.
Stat. pt. 4, ch. 1, Tit. 2, Art. 1, $ 7, p. 661 (1829)), and many
of the new States and Territories followed New York's example. Marzen 73-74. Between 1857 and 1865, a New York
commission led by Dudley Field drafted a criminal code that
prohibited "aiding" a suicide and, specifically, "furnish[ing]
another person with any deadly weapon or poisonous drug,
knowing that such person intends to use such weapon or
drug in taking his own life." Id., at 76-77. By the time the
Fourteenth Amendment was ratified, it was a crime in most
States to assist a suicide. See Cruzan, 497 U. S., at 294-295
(Scalia, J., concurring). The Field Penal Code was adopted
in the Dakota Territory in 1877 and in New York in 1881,
and its language served as a model for several other western
States' statutes in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
Marzen 76-77, 205-206, 212-213. California, for example,
codified its assisted-suicide prohibition in 1874, using language similar to the Field Code's.11 In this century, the
Model Penal Code also prohibited "aiding" suicide, prompting many States to enact or revise their assisted-suicide

11 In 1850, the California Legislature adopted the English common law,
under which assisting suicide was, of course, a crime. Act of Apr. 13,
1850, ch. 95, 1850 Cal. Stats. 219. The provision adopted in 1874 provided
that "[e]very person who deliberately aids or advises, or encourages
another to commit suicide, is guilty of a felony." Act of Mar. 30, 1874,
ch. 614, $ 13,400 (codified at Cal. Penal Code $ 400 (T. Hittel ed. 1876)).

bans.12 The code's drafters observed that "the interests inthe sanctity of life that are represented by the criminal homicide laws are threatened by one who expresses a willingnessto participate in taking the life of another, even though the
act may be accomplished with the consent, or at the request,of the suicide victim." American Law Institute, Model
Penal Code $ 210.5, Comment 5, p. 100 (Official Draft andRevised Comments 1980).

Though deeply rooted, the States' assisted-suicide banshave in recent years been reexamined and, generally, reaffirmed. Because of advances in medicine and technology,Americans today are increasingly likely to die in institutions,
from chronic illnesses. President's Comm'n for the Study ofEthical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral
Research, Deciding to Forego Life-Sustaining Treatment16-18 (1983). Public concern and democratic action are
therefore sharply focused on how best to protect dignity andindependence at the end of life, with the result that there
have been many significant changes in state laws and in theattitudes these laws reflect. Many States, for example, now
permit "living wills," surrogate health-care decisionmaking,and the withdrawal or refusal of life-sustaining medical
treatment. See Vacco v. Quill, post, at 804-806; 79 F. 3d, at818-820;

People v. Kevorkian, 447 Mich. 436, 478-480, andnn. 53-56, 527 N. W. 2d 714, 731-732, and nn. 53-56 (1994).

At the same time, however, voters and legislators continuefor the most part to reaffirm their States' prohibitions on
assisting suicide.The Washington statute at issue in this case, Wash. Rev.
Code $ 9A.36.060 (1994), was enacted in 1975 as part of arevision of that State's criminal code. Four years later,

12 "A person who purposely aids or solicits another to commit suicide is
guilty of a felony in the second degree if his conduct causes such suicide or
an attempted suicide, and otherwise of a misdemeanor." American Law
Institute, Model Penal Code $ 210.5(2) (Official Draft and Revised Comments 1980).

Opinion of the Court
Washington passed its Natural Death Act, which specificallystated that the "withholding or withdrawal of life-sustaining

treatment . . . shall not, for any purpose, constitute a suicide"and that "[n]othing in this chapter shall be construed to condone, authorize, or approve mercy killing . . . ." NaturalDeath Act, 1979 Wash. Laws, ch. 112, $ 8(1), p. 11 (codified

had it passed, would have permitted a form of physician-assisted suicide.

similar to Washington's in 1993. On the other hand, in 1994,voters in Oregon enacted, also through ballot initiative,
that State's "Death With Dignity Act," which legalizedphysician-assisted suicide for competent, terminally ill
adults.14 Since the Oregon vote, many proposals to legalizeassisted-suicide have been and continue to be introduced in
the States' legislatures, but none has been enacted.15 And

Opinion of the Court
just last year, Iowa and Rhode Island joined the overwhelm-ing majority of States explicitly prohibiting assisted suicide.

See Iowa Code Ann. $$ 707A.2, 707A.3 (Supp. 1997); R. I.Gen. Laws $$ 11-60-1, 11-60-3 (Supp. 1996). Also, on April

16 Other countries are embroiled in similar debates: The Supreme Court

of Canada recently rejected a claim that the Canadian Charter of Rights
and Freedoms establishes a fundamental right to assisted suicide, Rodriguez v. British Columbia (Attorney General), 107 D. L. R. (4th) 342 (1993);
the British House of Lords Select Committee on Medical Ethics refused
to recommend any change in Great Britain's assisted-suicide prohibition,
House of Lords, Session 1993-94 Report of the Select Committee on Medical Ethics, 12 Issues in Law & Med. 193, 202 (1996) ("We identify no circumstances in which assisted suicide should be permitted"); New Zealand's
Parliament rejected a proposed "Death With Dignity Bill" that would have
legalized physician-assisted suicide in August 1995, Graeme, MPs Throw
out Euthanasia Bill, The Dominion (Wellington), Aug. 17, 1995, p. 1; and
the Northern Territory of Australia legalized assisted suicide and voluntary euthanasia in 1995, see Shenon, Australian Doctors Get Right to Assist Suicide, N. Y. Times, July 28, 1995, p. A8. As of February 1997, three

Territory. Mydans, Assisted Suicide: Australia Faces a Grim Reality,

Opinion of the Court
Thus, the States are currently engaged in serious,thoughtful examinations of physician-assisted suicide and

other similar issues. For example, New York State's TaskForce on Life and the Law--an ongoing, blue-ribbon commission composed of doctors, ethicists, lawyers, religious lead-ers, and interested laymen--was convened in 1984 and commissioned with "a broad mandate to recommend public policyon issues raised by medical advances." New York Task
Force vii. Over the past decade, the Task Force has recom-mended laws relating to end-of-life decisions, surrogate pregnancy, and organ donation. Id., at 118-119. After studyingphysician-assisted suicide, however, the Task Force unanimously concluded that "[l]egalizing assisted suicide and eu-thanasia would pose profound risks to many individuals who
are ill and vulnerable. . . . [T]he potential dangers of thisdramatic change in public policy would outweigh any benefit
that might be achieved." Id., at 120.Attitudes toward suicide itself have changed since Bracton, but our laws have consistently condemned, and continueto prohibit, assisting suicide. Despite changes in medical
technology and notwithstanding an increased emphasis on
the importance of end-of-life decisionmaking, we have notretreated from this prohibition. Against this backdrop of

history, tradition, and practice, we now turn to respondents'constitutional claim.

The Due Process Clause guarantees more than fair process, and the "liberty" it protects includes more than the ab-sence of physical restraint.

ing Daniels v. Williams, 474 U. S. 327, 331 (1986)). TheClause also provides heightened protection against government interference with certain fundamental rights and lib-erty interests.

Reno v. Flores, 507 U. S. 292, 301-302 (1993);
Casey, 505 U. S., at 851. In a long line of cases, we have
held that, in addition to the specific freedoms protected bythe Bill of Rights, the "liberty" specially protected by the

Due Process Clause includes the rights to marry, Loving v.
Virginia, 388 U. S. 1 (1967); to have children, Skinner v.
Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson, 316 U. S. 535 (1942); to directthe education and upbringing of one's children,

Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U. S. 390 (1923); Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268
U. S. 510 (1925); to marital privacy, Griswold v. Connecticut,
381 U. S. 479 (1965); to use contraception, ibid.; Eisenstadt
v. Baird, 405 U. S. 438 (1972); to bodily integrity, Rochin v.
California, 342 U. S. 165 (1952), and to abortion, Casey,
supra. We have also assumed, and strongly suggested, that
the Due Process Clause protects the traditional right to refuse unwanted lifesaving medical treatment. Cruzan, 497
U. S., at 278-279.

But we "ha[ve] always been reluctant to expand the concept of substantive due process because guideposts for responsible decisionmaking in this unchartered area are scarce
and open-ended." Collins, 503 U. S., at 125. By extending
constitutional protection to an asserted right or liberty interest, we, to a great extent, place the matter outside the arena
of public debate and legislative action. We must therefore
"exercise the utmost care whenever we are asked to break
new ground in this field," ibid., lest the liberty protected by
the Due Process Clause be subtly transformed into the policy
preferences of the Members of this Court, Moore, 431 U. S.,
at 502 (plurality opinion).

Our established method of substantive-due-process analysis has two primary features: First, we have regularly observed that the Due Process Clause specially protects those
fundamental rights and liberties which are, objectively,

Opinion of the Court
"deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition," id., at503 (plurality opinion); Snyder v. Massachusetts, 291 U. S.

97, 105 (1934) ("so rooted in the traditions and conscience ofour people as to be ranked as fundamental"), and "implicit in
the concept of ordered liberty," such that "neither libertynor justice would exist if they were sacrificed,"

Palko v. Con-necticut, 302 U. S. 319, 325, 326 (1937). Second, we have required in substantive-due-process cases a "careful descrip-tion" of the asserted fundamental liberty interest. Flores,
supra, at 302; Collins, supra, at 125; Cruzan, supra, at 277-278. Our Nation's history, legal traditions, and practices
thus provide the crucial "guideposts for responsible decision-making,"

Collins, supra, at 125, that direct and restrain ourexposition of the Due Process Clause. As we stated recently in Flores, the Fourteenth Amendment "forbids thegovernment to infringe . . . `fundamental' liberty interests at
all, no matter what process is provided, unless the infringe-ment is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest." 507 U. S., at 302.

Justice Souter, relying on Justice Harlan's dissentingopinion in Poe v. Ullman, 367 U. S. 497 (1961), would largely

abandon this restrained methodology, and instead ask"whether [Washington's] statute sets up one of those `arbitrary impositions' or `purposeless restraints' at odds with theDue Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment," post,
at 752 (quoting Poe, supra, at 543 (Harlan, J., dissenting)).17

17 In Justice Souter's opinion, Justice Harlan's Poe dissent supplies the
"modern justification" for substantive-due-process review. Post, at 756,
and n. 4 (opinion concurring in judgment). But although Justice Harlan's
opinion has often been cited in due process cases, we have never abandoned our fundamental-rights-based analytical method. Just four Terms
ago, six of the Justices now sitting joined the Court's opinion in Reno v.
Flores, 507 U. S. 292, 301-305 (1993); Poe was not even cited. And in
Cruzan v. Director, Mo. Dept. of Health, 497 U. S. 261 (1990), neither the
Court's nor the concurring opinions relied on Poe; rather, we concluded
that the right to refuse unwanted medical treatment was so rooted in our
history, tradition, and practice as to require special protection under the

722 WASHINGTON v. GLUCKSBERG

Opinion of the Court
In our view, however, the development of this Court'ssubstantive-due-process jurisprudence, described briefly

supra, at 719-720, has been a process whereby the outlinesof the "liberty" specially protected by the Fourteenth
Amendment--never fully clarified, to be sure, and perhapsnot capable of being fully clarified--have at least been carefully refined by concrete examples involving fundamentalrights found to be deeply rooted in our legal tradition. This
approach tends to rein in the subjective elements that arenecessarily present in due process judicial review. In addition, by establishing a threshold requirement--that a challenged state action implicate a fundamental right--before requiring more than a reasonable relation to a legitimate stateinterest to justify the action, it avoids the need for complex

balancing of competing interests in every case.Turning to the claim at issue here, the Court of Appeals
stated that "[p]roperly analyzed, the first issue to be resolvedis whether there is a liberty interest in determining the time
and manner of one's death," 79 F. 3d, at 801, or, in otherwords, "[i]s there a right to die?,"

id., at 799. Similarly, respondents assert a "liberty to choose how to die" and a right
to "control of one's final days," Brief for Respondents 7, anddescribe the asserted liberty as "the right to choose a humane, dignified death," id., at 15, and "the liberty to shapedeath,"

id., at 18. As noted above, we have a tradition of
carefully formulating the interest at stake in substantive-due-process cases. For example, although

Cruzan is often
described as a "right to die" case, see 79 F. 3d, at 799; post,at 745 (

Stevens, J., concurring in judgments) (Cruzan recognized "the more specific interest in making decisions about

Fourteenth Amendment. Cruzan, 497 U. S., at 278-279; id., at 287-288
(O'Connor, J., concurring). True, the Court relied on Justice Harlan's
dissent in Casey, 505 U. S., at 848-850, but, as Flores demonstrates, we
did not in so doing jettison our established approach. Indeed, to read
such a radical move into the Court's opinion in Casey would seem to fly in
the face of that opinion's emphasis on stare decisis. 505 U. S., at 854-869.

Opinion of the Court
how to confront an imminent death"), we were, in fact, more
precise: We assumed that the Constitution granted competent persons a "constitutionally protected right to refuse lifesaving hydration and nutrition." Cruzan, 497 U. S., at 279;
id., at 287 (O'Connor, J., concurring) ("[A] liberty interest
in refusing unwanted medical treatment may be inferred from
our prior decisions"). The Washington statute at issue in
this case prohibits "aid[ing] another person to attempt suicide," Wash. Rev. Code $ 9A.36.060(1) (1994), and, thus, the
question before us is whether the "liberty" specially protected
by the Due Process Clause includes a right to commit suicide which itself includes a right to assistance in doing so.18

We now inquire whether this asserted right has any place
in our Nation's traditions. Here, as discussed supra, at 710-
719, we are confronted with a consistent and almost universal tradition that has long rejected the asserted right, and
continues explicitly to reject it today, even for terminally
ill, mentally competent adults. To hold for respondents, we
would have to reverse centuries of legal doctrine and practice, and strike down the considered policy choice of almost
every State. See Jackman v. Rosenbaum Co., 260 U. S. 22,
31 (1922) ("If a thing has been practised for two hundred
years by common consent, it will need a strong case for the
Fourteenth Amendment to affect it"); Flores, 507 U. S., at
303 ("The mere novelty of such a claim is reason enough to
doubt that `substantive due process' sustains it").

Respondents contend, however, that the liberty interest
they assert is consistent with this Court's substantive-due18 See, e. g., Quill v. Vacco, 80 F. 3d 716, 724 (CA2 1996) ("right to assisted suicide finds no cognizable basis in the Constitution's language or
design"); Compassion in Dying v. Washington, 49 F. 3d 586, 591 (CA9
1995) (referring to alleged "right to suicide," "right to assistance in suicide," and "right to aid in killing oneself"); People v. Kevorkian, 447 Mich.
436, 476, n. 47, 527 N. W. 2d 714, 730, n. 47 (1994) ("[T]he question that we
must decide is whether the [C]onstitution encompasses a right to commit
suicide and, if so, whether it includes a right to assistance").

Opinion of the Court
process line of cases, if not with this Nation's history andpractice. Pointing to

Casey and Cruzan, respondents read
our jurisprudence in this area as reflecting a general tradi-tion of "self-sovereignty," Brief for Respondents 12, and as

teaching that the "liberty" protected by the Due Process
Clause includes "basic and intimate exercises of personal au-tonomy,"

id., at 10; see Casey, 505 U. S., at 847 ("It is a promise of the Constitution that there is a realm of personal lib-erty which the government may not enter"). According to

respondents, our liberty jurisprudence, and the broad, indi-vidualistic principles it reflects, protects the "liberty of competent, terminally ill adults to make end-of-life decisions free
of undue government interference." Brief for Respondents
10. The question presented in this case, however, is
whether the protections of the Due Process Clause include a
right to commit suicide with another's assistance. With this
"careful description" of respondents' claim in mind, we turn
to Casey and Cruzan.

In Cruzan, we considered whether Nancy Beth Cruzan,
who had been severely injured in an automobile accident and
was in a persistive vegetative state, "ha[d] a right under the
United States Constitution which would require the hospital
to withdraw life-sustaining treatment" at her parents' request. 497 U. S., at 269. We began with the observation
that "[a]t common law, even the touching of one person by
another without consent and without legal justification was
a battery." Ibid. We then discussed the related rule that
"informed consent is generally required for medical treatment." Ibid. After reviewing a long line of relevant state
cases, we concluded that "the common-law doctrine of informed consent is viewed as generally encompassing the
right of a competent individual to refuse medical treatment."
Id., at 277. Next, we reviewed our own cases on the subject,
and stated that "[t]he principle that a competent person has
a constitutionally protected liberty interest in refusing unwanted medical treatment may be inferred from our prior

521US2 Unit: $U90 [11-23-99 18:50:39] PAGES PGT: OPFX

Opinion of the Court
decisions." Id., at 278. Therefore, "for purposes of [that]case, we assume[d] that the United States Constitution

would grant a competent person a constitutionally protectedright to refuse lifesaving hydration and nutrition."

Id., at
279; see id., at 287 (O'Connor, J., concurring). We concluded that, notwithstanding this right, the Constitution per-mitted Missouri to require clear and convincing evidence of

an incompetent patient's wishes concerning the withdrawalof life-sustaining treatment.

Id., at 280-281.
Respondents contend that in Cruzan we "acknowledgedthat competent, dying persons have the right to direct the

removal of life-sustaining medical treatment and thus hasten
death," Brief for Respondents 23, and that "the constitutional principle behind recognizing the patient's liberty to
direct the withdrawal of artificial life support applies at least
as strongly to the choice to hasten impending death by consuming lethal medication," id., at 26. Similarly, the Court
of Appeals concluded that "Cruzan, by recognizing a liberty
interest that includes the refusal of artificial provision of
life-sustaining food and water, necessarily recognize[d] a liberty interest in hastening one's own death." 79 F. 3d, at 816.

The right assumed in Cruzan, however, was not simply
deduced from abstract concepts of personal autonomy.
Given the common-law rule that forced medication was a battery, and the long legal tradition protecting the decision to
refuse unwanted medical treatment, our assumption was entirely consistent with this Nation's history and constitutional
traditions. The decision to commit suicide with the assistance of another may be just as personal and profound as the
decision to refuse unwanted medical treatment, but it has
never enjoyed similar legal protection. Indeed, the two acts
are widely and reasonably regarded as quite distinct. See
Quill v. Vacco, post, at 800-808. In Cruzan itself, we recognized that most States outlawed assisted suicide--and even
more do today--and we certainly gave no intimation that the
right to refuse unwanted medical treatment could be some521US2 Unit: $U90 [11-23-99 18:50:39] PAGES PGT: OPFX

Opinion of the Court
how transmuted into a right to assistance in committing sui-cide. 497 U. S., at 280.

Respondents also rely on Casey. There, the Court's opin-ion concluded that "the essential holding of Roe v. Wade[,
410 U. S. 113 (1973),] should be retained and once again reaf-firmed." 505 U. S., at 846. We held, first, that a woman has
a right, before her fetus is viable, to an abortion "withoutundue interference from the State"; second, that States may
restrict postviability abortions, so long as exceptions aremade to protect a woman's life and health; and third, that
the State has legitimate interests throughout a pregnancy inprotecting the health of the woman and the life of the unborn
child. Ibid. In reaching this conclusion, the opinion dis-cussed in some detail this Court's substantive-due-process
tradition of interpreting the Due Process Clause to protectcertain fundamental rights and "personal decisions relating
to marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships,child rearing, and education," and noted that many of those
rights and liberties "involv[e] the most intimate and personalchoices a person may make in a lifetime."

Id., at 851.The Court of Appeals, like the District Court, found Casey

" `highly instructive' " and " `almost prescriptive' " for deter-mining " `what liberty interest may inhere in a terminally ill
person's choice to commit suicide' ":

"Like the decision of whether or not to have an abortion,the decision how and when to die is one of `the most

intimate and personal choices a person may make in alifetime,' a choice `central to personal dignity and autonomy.' " 79 F. 3d, at 813-814.
Similarly, respondents emphasize the statement in Caseythat:

"At the heart of liberty is the right to define one's ownconcept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of
the mystery of human life. Beliefs about these matterscould not define the attributes of personhood were they

formed under compulsion of the State." 505 U. S., at
851.

Brief for Respondents 12. By choosing this language, the
Court's opinion in Casey described, in a general way and in
light of our prior cases, those personal activities and decisions that this Court has identified as so deeply rooted in our
history and traditions, or so fundamental to our concept of
constitutionally ordered liberty, that they are protected by
the Fourteenth Amendment.19 The opinion moved from the
recognition that liberty necessarily includes freedom of conscience and belief about ultimate considerations to the observation that "though the abortion decision may originate
within the zone of conscience and belief, it is more than a
philosophic exercise." Casey, 505 U. S., at 852 (emphasis
added). That many of the rights and liberties protected by
the Due Process Clause sound in personal autonomy does not
warrant the sweeping conclusion that any and all important,
intimate, and personal decisions are so protected, San An19 See Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U. S. 494, 503 (1977) ("[T]he Constitution protects the sanctity of the family precisely because the institution

Opinion of the Court
tonio Independent School Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 1,
33-35 (1973), and Casey did not suggest otherwise.

The history of the law's treatment of assisted suicide in
this country has been and continues to be one of the rejection
of nearly all efforts to permit it. That being the case, our
decisions lead us to conclude that the asserted "right" to assistance in committing suicide is not a fundamental liberty
interest protected by the Due Process Clause. The Constitution also requires, however, that Washington's assistedsuicide ban be rationally related to legitimate government
interests. See Heller v. Doe, 509 U. S. 312, 319-320 (1993);
Flores, 507 U. S., at 305. This requirement is unquestionably met here. As the court below recognized, 79 F. 3d, at
816-817,20 Washington's assisted-suicide ban implicates a
number of state interests.21 See 49 F. 3d, at 592-593; Brief
for State of California et al. as Amici Curiae 26-29; Brief
for United States as Amicus Curiae 16-27.

First, Washington has an "unqualified interest in the preservation of human life." Cruzan, 497 U. S., at 282. The
State's prohibition on assisted suicide, like all homicide laws,
both reflects and advances its commitment to this interest.
See id., at 280; Model Penal Code $ 210.5, Comment 5, at 100
("[T]he interests in the sanctity of life that are represented
by the criminal homicide laws are threatened by one who
expresses a willingness to participate in taking the life of

20 The court identified and discussed six state interests: (1) preserving
life; (2) preventing suicide; (3) avoiding the involvement of third parties
and use of arbitrary, unfair, or undue influence; (4) protecting family members and loved ones; (5) protecting the integrity of the medical profession;
and (6) avoiding future movement toward euthanasia and other abuses.

21 Respondents also admit the existence of these interests, Brief for Respondents 28-39, but contend that Washington could better promote and
protect them through regulation, rather than prohibition, of physicianassisted suicide. Our inquiry, however, is limited to the question whether
the State's prohibition is rationally related to legitimate state interests.

another").22 This interest is symbolic and aspirational aswell as practical:

"While suicide is no longer prohibited or penalized, theban against assisted suicide and euthanasia shores up
the notion of limits in human relationships. It reflectsthe gravity with which we view the decision to take
one's own life or the life of another, and our reluctanceto encourage or promote these decisions." New York
Task Force 131-132.
Respondents admit that "[t]he State has a real interest in
preserving the lives of those who can still contribute to soci-ety and have the potential to enjoy life." Brief for Respondents 35, n. 23. The Court of Appeals also recognized Wash-ington's interest in protecting life, but held that the "weight"
of this interest depends on the "medical condition and the
wishes of the person whose life is at stake." 79 F. 3d, at817. Washington, however, has rejected this sliding-scale

approach and, through its assisted-suicide ban, insists thatall persons' lives, from beginning to end, regardless of physical or mental condition, are under the full protection of thelaw. See

United States v. Rutherford, 442 U. S. 544, 558
(1979) (". . . Congress could reasonably have determined toprotect the terminally ill, no less than other patients, from

the vast range of self-styled panaceas that inventive minds
can devise"). As we have previously affirmed, the States"may properly decline to make judgments about the `quality'

of life that a particular individual may enjoy," Cruzan,

22 The States express this commitment by other means as well:
"[N]early all states expressly disapprove of suicide and assisted suicide
either in statutes dealing with durable powers of attorney in health-care
situations, or in `living will' statutes. In addition, all states provide for
the involuntary commitment of persons who may harm themselves as the
result of mental illness, and a number of states allow the use of nondeadly
force to thwart suicide attempts." People v. Kevorkian, 447 Mich., at
478-479, and nn. 53-56, 527 N. W. 2d, at 731-732, and nn. 53-56.

Opinion of the Court
supra, at 282. This remains true, as Cruzan makes clear,even for those who are near death.

Relatedly, all admit that suicide is a serious public-healthproblem, especially among persons in otherwise vulnerable
groups. See Washington State Dept. of Health, Annual
Summary of Vital Statistics 1991, pp. 29-30 (Oct. 1992) (sui-cide is a leading cause of death in Washington of those between the ages of 14 and 54); New York Task Force 10, 23-33(suicide rate in the general population is about one percent,
and suicide is especially prevalent among the young and theelderly). The State has an interest in preventing suicide,
and in studying, identifying, and treating its causes. See 79
F. 3d, at 820; id., at 854 (Beezer, J., dissenting) ("The state
recognizes suicide as a manifestation of medical and psychological anguish"); Marzen 107-146.

Those who attempt suicide--terminally ill or not--often
suffer from depression or other mental disorders. See New
York Task Force 13-22, 126-128 (more than 95% of those who
commit suicide had a major psychiatric illness at the time of
death; among the terminally ill, uncontrolled pain is a "risk
factor" because it contributes to depression); PhysicianAssisted Suicide and Euthanasia in the Netherlands: A Report of Chairman Charles T. Canady to the Subcommittee on
the Constitution of the House Committee on the Judiciary,

Euthanasia in Washington State, 275 JAMA 919, 924 (1996)
("[I]ntolerable physical symptoms are not the reason most
patients request physician-assisted suicide or euthanasia").
Research indicates, however, that many people who request
physician-assisted suicide withdraw that request if their depression and pain are treated. H. Hendin, Seduced by
Death: Doctors, Patients and the Dutch Cure 24-25 (1997)
(suicidal, terminally ill patients "usually respond well to
treatment for depressive illness and pain medication and are
then grateful to be alive"); New York Task Force 177-178.

Opinion of the Court
The New York Task Force, however, expressed its concernthat, because depression is difficult to diagnose, physicians

and medical professionals often fail to respond adequatelyto seriously ill patients' needs.

Id., at 175. Thus, legal
physician-assisted suicide could make it more difficult for the
State to protect depressed or mentally ill persons, or thosewho are suffering from untreated pain, from suicidal

impulses.The State also has an interest in protecting the integrity
and ethics of the medical profession. In contrast to theCourt of Appeals' conclusion that "the integrity of the medical profession would [not] be threatened in any way by
[physician-assisted suicide]," 79 F. 3d, at 827, the American
Medical Association, like many other medical and physicians'
groups, has concluded that "[p]hysician-assisted suicide is
fundamentally incompatible with the physician's role as
healer." American Medical Association, Code of Ethics

$ 2.211 (1994); see Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs,
Decisions Near the End of Life, 267 JAMA 2229, 2233 (1992)
("[T]he societal risks of involving physicians in medical interventions to cause patients' deaths is too great"); New York
Task Force 103-109 (discussing physicians' views). And
physician-assisted suicide could, it is argued, undermine the
trust that is essential to the doctor-patient relationship by
blurring the time-honored line between healing and harming.
Assisted Suicide in the United States, Hearing before the
Subcommittee on the Constitution of the House Committee
on the Judiciary, 104th Cong., 2d Sess., 355-356 (1996) (testimony of Dr. Leon R. Kass) ("The patient's trust in the doctor's whole-hearted devotion to his best interests will be
hard to sustain").

Next, the State has an interest in protecting vulnerable
groups--including the poor, the elderly, and disabled persons--from abuse, neglect, and mistakes. The Court of Appeals dismissed the State's concern that disadvantaged persons might be pressured into physician-assisted suicide as

732 WASHINGTON v. GLUCKSBERG

Opinion of the Court
"ludicrous on its face." 79 F. 3d, at 825. We have recognized, however, the real risk of subtle coercion and undue
influence in end-of-life situations. Cruzan, 497 U. S., at 281.
Similarly, the New York Task Force warned that "[l]egalizing physician-assisted suicide would pose profound risks to
many individuals who are ill and vulnerable. . . . The risk of
harm is greatest for the many individuals in our society
whose autonomy and well-being are already compromised by
poverty, lack of access to good medical care, advanced age,
or membership in a stigmatized social group." New York
Task Force 120; see Compassion in Dying, 49 F. 3d, at 593
("An insidious bias against the handicapped--again coupled
with a cost-saving mentality--makes them especially in
need of Washington's statutory protection"). If physicianassisted suicide were permitted, many might resort to it to
spare their families the substantial financial burden of endof-life health-care costs.

The State's interest here goes beyond protecting the vulnerable from coercion; it extends to protecting disabled and
terminally ill people from prejudice, negative and inaccurate
stereotypes, and "societal indifference." 49 F. 3d, at 592.
The State's assisted-suicide ban reflects and reinforces its
policy that the lives of terminally ill, disabled, and elderly
people must be no less valued than the lives of the young
and healthy, and that a seriously disabled person's suicidal
impulses should be interpreted and treated the same way
as anyone else's. See New York Task Force 101-102;
Physician-Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia in the Netherlands: A Report of Chairman Charles T. Canady, supra, at 9,
20 (discussing prejudice toward the disabled and the negative messages euthanasia and assisted suicide send to handicapped patients).

Finally, the State may fear that permitting assisted suicide
will start it down the path to voluntary and perhaps even
involuntary euthanasia. The Court of Appeals struck down

Opinion of the Court
Washington's assisted-suicide ban only "as applied to compe-tent, terminally ill adults who wish to hasten their deaths by

obtaining medication prescribed by their doctors." 79 F. 3d,at 838. Washington insists, however, that the impact of the
court's decision will not and cannot be so limited. Brief forPetitioners 44-47. If suicide is protected as a matter of constitutional right, it is argued, "every man and woman in theUnited States must enjoy it."

Compassion in Dying, 49F. 3d, at 591; see Kevorkian, 447 Mich., at 470, n. 41, 527

N. W. 2d, at 727-728, n. 41. The Court of Appeals' decision,and its expansive reasoning, provide ample support for the
State's concerns. The court noted, for example, that the"decision of a duly appointed surrogate decision maker is for
all legal purposes the decision of the patient himself," 79F. 3d, at 832, n. 120; that "in some instances, the patient may
be unable to self-administer the drugs and . . . administrationby the physician . . . may be the only way the patient may
be able to receive them," id., at 831; and that not only physi-cians, but also family members and loved ones, will inevitably participate in assisting suicide, id., at 838, n. 140. Thus,it turns out that what is couched as a limited right to
"physician-assisted suicide" is likely, in effect, a muchbroader license, which could prove extremely difficult to police and contain.23 Washington's ban on assisting suicideprevents such erosion.

23 Justice Souter concludes that "[t]he case for the slippery slope is
fairly made out here, not because recognizing one due process right would
leave a court with no principled basis to avoid recognizing another, but
because there is a plausible case that the right claimed would not be
readily containable by reference to facts about the mind that are matters
of difficult judgment, or by gatekeepers who are subject to temptation,
noble or not." Post, at 785 (opinion concurring in judgment). We agree
that the case for a slippery slope has been made out, but--bearing in mind
Justice Cardozo's observation of "[t]he tendency of a principle to expand
itself to the limit of its logic," The Nature of the Judicial Process 51
(1932)--we also recognize the reasonableness of the widely expressed

734 WASHINGTON v. GLUCKSBERG

Opinion of the Court
This concern is further supported by evidence about thepractice of euthanasia in the Netherlands. The Dutch government's own study revealed that in 1990, there were 2,300cases of voluntary euthanasia (defined as "the deliberate termination of another's life at his request"), 400 cases of as-sisted suicide, and more than 1,000 cases of euthanasia without an explicit request. In addition to these latter 1,000cases, the study found an additional 4,941 cases where physicians administered lethal morphine overdoses without thepatients' explicit consent. Physician-Assisted Suicide and
Euthanasia in the Netherlands: A Report of ChairmanCharles T. Canady,

supra, 12-13 (citing Dutch study). Thisstudy suggests that, despite the existence of various reporting procedures, euthanasia in the Netherlands has not beenlimited to competent, terminally ill adults who are enduring
physical suffering, and that regulation of the practice maynot have prevented abuses in cases involving vulnerable persons, including severely disabled neonates and elderly per-sons suffering from dementia.

Id., at 16-21; see generallyC. Gomez, Regulating Death: Euthanasia and the Case of the

Netherlands (1991); H. Hendin, Seduced By Death: Doctors,Patients, and the Dutch Cure (1997). The New York Task
Force, citing the Dutch experience, observed that "assistedsuicide and euthanasia are closely linked," New York Task

other States, reasonably ensures against this risk by ban-ning, rather than regulating, assisted suicide. See United

States v. 12 200-ft. Reels of Super 8MM. Film, 413 U. S. 123,127 (1973) ("Each step, when taken, appear[s] a reasonable
step in relation to that which preceded it, although theaggregate or end result is one that would never have been
seriously considered in the first instance").We need not weigh exactingly the relative strengths of
these various interests. They are unquestionably importantand legitimate, and Washington's ban on assisted suicide is
at least reasonably related to their promotion and protection.We therefore hold that Wash. Rev. Code $ 9A.36.060(1) (1994)
does not violate the Fourteenth Amendment, either on itsface or "as applied to competent, terminally ill adults who
wish to hasten their deaths by obtaining medication pre-scribed by their doctors." 79 F. 3d, at 838.

Throughout the Nation, Americans are engaged in an ear-nest and profound debate about the morality, legality, and

practicality of physician-assisted suicide. Our holding per-mits this debate to continue, as it should in a democratic
society. The decision of the en banc Court of Appeals is

24 Justice Stevens states that "the Court does conceive of respondents' claim as a facial challenge--addressing not the application of the
statute to a particular set of plaintiffs before it, but the constitutionality
of the statute's categorical prohibition . . . ." Post, at 740 (opinion concurring in judgments). We emphasize that we today reject the Court of
Appeals' specific holding that the statute is unconstitutional "as applied"
to a particular class. See n. 6, supra. Justice Stevens agrees with
this holding, see post, at 750, but would not "foreclose the possibility that
an individual plaintiff seeking to hasten her death, or a doctor whose assistance was sought, could prevail in a more particularized challenge,"
ibid. Our opinion does not absolutely foreclose such a claim. However,
given our holding that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not provide heightened protection to the asserted liberty interest in ending one's life with a physician's assistance, such a claim would
have to be quite different from the ones advanced by respondents here.

Death will be different for each of us. For many, the lastdays will be spent in physical pain and perhaps the despair

that accompanies physical deterioration and a loss of controlof basic bodily and mental functions. Some will seek medication to alleviate that pain and other symptoms.The Court frames the issue in Washington v. Glucksberg
as whether the Due Process Clause of the Constitution pro-tects a "right to commit suicide which itself includes a right
to assistance in doing so," ante, at 723, and concludes thatour Nation's history, legal traditions, and practices do not
support the existence of such a right. I join the Court'sopinions because I agree that there is no generalized right
to "commit suicide." But respondents urge us to addressthe narrower question whether a mentally competent person
who is experiencing great suffering has a constitutionallycognizable interest in controlling the circumstances of his
or her imminent death. I see no need to reach that ques-tion in the context of the facial challenges to the New York
and Washington laws at issue here. See ibid. ("The Wash-ington statute at issue in this case prohibits `aid[ing] another person to attempt suicide,'. . . and, thus, the questionbefore us is whether the `liberty' specially protected by the
Due Process Clause includes a right to commit suicide which
itself includes a right to assistance in doing so"). The par-ties and

suffering from a terminal illness and who is experiencing
great pain has no legal barriers to obtaining medication, from
qualified physicians, to alleviate that suffering, even to the
point of causing unconsciousness and hastening death. See
Wash. Rev. Code $ 70.122.010 (1994); Brief for Petitioners in
No. 95-1858, p. 15, n. 9; Brief for Respondents in No. 95-1858,
p. 15. In this light, even assuming that we would recognize
such an interest, I agree that the State's interests in protecting those who are not truly competent or facing imminent
death, or those whose decisions to hasten death would not
truly be voluntary, are sufficiently weighty to justify a prohibition against physician-assisted suicide. Ante, at 731-733;
post, at 747 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgments); post, at
782-787 (Souter, J., concurring in judgment).

Every one of us at some point may be affected by our own
or a family member's terminal illness. There is no reason
to think the democratic process will not strike the proper
balance between the interests of terminally ill, mentally
competent individuals who would seek to end their suffering
and the State's interests in protecting those who might seek
to end life mistakenly or under pressure. As the Court recognizes, States are presently undertaking extensive and
serious evaluation of physician-assisted suicide and other
related issues. Ante, at 716-718; see post, at 785-788
(Souter, J., concurring in judgment). In such circumstances, "the . . . challenging task of crafting appropriate
procedures for safeguarding . . . liberty interests is entrusted
to the `laboratory' of the States . . . in the first instance."

In sum, there is no need to address the question whether
suffering patients have a constitutionally cognizable interest
in obtaining relief from the suffering that they may experience in the last days of their lives. There is no dispute that

dying patients in Washington and New York can obtain pal-liative care, even when doing so would hasten their deaths.

The difficulty in defining terminal illness and the risk that adying patient's request for assistance in ending his or her
life might not be truly voluntary justifies the prohibitions on
assisted suicide we uphold here.

Justice Stevens, concurring in the judgments.*
The Court ends its opinion with the important observation
that our holding today is fully consistent with a continuationof the vigorous debate about the "morality, legality, and practicality of physician-assisted suicide" in a democratic society.

is also room for further debate about the limits that the Con-stitution places on the power of the States to punish the

The morality, legality, and practicality of capital punish-ment have been the subject of debate for many years. In

1976, this Court upheld the constitutionality of the practice
in cases coming to us from Georgia,1 Florida,2 and Texas.3In those cases we concluded that a State does have the power

to place a lesser value on some lives than on others; there is
no absolute requirement that a State treat all human life ashaving an equal right to preservation. Because the state

legislatures had sufficiently narrowed the category of lives
that the State could terminate, and had enacted special pro-cedures to ensure that the defendant belonged in that limited

category, we concluded that the statutes were not unconsti-tutional on their face. In later cases coming to us from each

of those States, however, we found that some applications ofthe statutes were unconstitutional.

Today, the Court decides that Washington's statute prohib-iting assisted suicide is not invalid "on its face," that is to

say, in all or most cases in which it might be applied.5 Thatholding, however, does not foreclose the possibility that some
applications of the statute might well be invalid.As originally filed,

Washington v. Glucksberg presented achallenge to the Washington statute on its face and as it applied to three terminally ill, mentally competent patients andto four physicians who treat terminally ill patients. After
the District Court issued its opinion holding that the statuteplaced an undue burden on the right to commit physicianassisted suicide, see Compassion in Dying v. Washington,850 F. Supp. 1454, 1462, 1465 (WD Wash. 1994), the three
patients died. Although the Court of Appeals consideredthe constitutionality of the statute "as applied to the prescription of life-ending medication for use by terminally ill,competent adult patients who wish to hasten their deaths,"
Compassion in Dying v. Washington, 79 F. 3d 790, 798 (CA91996), the court did not have before it any individual plaintiff
seeking to hasten her death or any doctor who was threat-ened with prosecution for assisting in the suicide of a particular patient; its analysis and eventual holding that the stat-ute was unconstitutional was not limited to a particular set
of plaintiffs before it.The appropriate standard to be applied in cases making
facial challenges to state statutes has been the subject ofdebate within this Court. See

Janklow v. Planned Parent-hood, Sioux Falls Clinic, 517 U. S. 1174 (1996). Upholding

the validity of the federal Bail Reform Act of 1984, the Courtstated in United States v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739 (1987), that
a "facial challenge to a legislative Act is, of course, the most

difficult challenge to mount successfully, since the challengermust establish that no set of circumstances exists under

which the Act would be valid." Id., at 745.6 I do not be-lieve the Court has ever actually applied such a strict standard,7 even in Salerno itself, and the Court does not appearto apply

Salerno here. Nevertheless, the Court does conceive of respondents' claim as a facial challenge--addressing
not the application of the statute to a particular set ofplaintiffs before it, but the constitutionality of the statute's

categorical prohibition against "aid[ing] another person toattempt suicide."

Ante, at 723 (internal quotation marks
omitted) (citing Wash. Rev. Code $ 9A.36.060(1) (1994)). Ac-cordingly, the Court requires the plaintiffs to show that the

interest in liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment"includes a right to commit suicide which itself includes a
right to assistance in doing so." Ante, at 723.

History and tradition provide ample support for refusing
to recognize an open-ended constitutional right to commit
suicide. Much more than the State's paternalistic interest

6 If the Court had actually applied the Salerno standard in this action,
it would have taken only a few paragraphs to identify situations in which
the Washington statute could be validly enforced. In Salerno itself, the
Court would have needed only to look at whether the statute could be
constitutionally applied to the arrestees before it; any further analysis
would have been superfluous. See Dorf, Facial Challenges to State and
Federal Statutes, 46 Stan. L. Rev. 235, 239-240 (1994) (arguing that if the
Salerno standard were taken literally, a litigant could not succeed in her
facial challenge unless she also succeeded in her as applied challenge).

7 In other cases and in other contexts, we have imposed a significantly

lesser burden on the challenger. The most lenient standard that we have
applied requires the challenger to establish that the invalid applications of
a statute "must not only be real, but substantial as well, judged in relation
to the statute's plainly legitimate sweep." Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413
U. S. 601, 615 (1973). As the Court's opinion demonstrates, Washington's
statute prohibiting assisted suicide has a "plainly legitimate sweep."
While that demonstration provides a sufficient justification for rejecting
respondents' facial challenge, it does not mean that every application of
the statute should or will be upheld.

in protecting the individual from the irrevocable conse-quences of an ill-advised decision motivated by temporary

concerns is at stake. There is truth in John Donne's obser-vation that "No man is an island."

8 The State has an interest in preserving and fostering the benefits that everyhuman being may provide to the community--a community

that thrives on the exchange of ideas, expressions of af-fection, shared memories, and humorous incidents, as well as
on the material contributions that its members create andsupport. The value to others of a person's life is far too
precious to allow the individual to claim a constitutional enti-tlement to complete autonomy in making a decision to end
that life. Thus, I fully agree with the Court that the "lib-erty" protected by the Due Process Clause does not include
a categorical "right to commit suicide which itself includes aright to assistance in doing so." Ibid.

But just as our conclusion that capital punishment is notalways unconstitutional did not preclude later decisions holding that it is sometimes impermissibly cruel, so is it equallyclear that a decision upholding a general statutory prohibition of assisted suicide does not mean that every possibleapplication of the statute would be valid. A State, like
Washington, that has authorized the death penalty, andthereby has concluded that the sanctity of human life does
not require that it always be preserved, must acknowledgethat there are situations in which an interest in hastening

Stevens, J., concurring in judgments
death is legitimate. Indeed, not only is that interest some-times legitimate, I am also convinced that there are times

when it is entitled to constitutional protection.

II
In Cruzan v. Director, Mo. Dept. of Health, 497 U. S. 261(1990), the Court assumed that the interest in liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment encompassed the rightof a terminally ill patient to direct the withdrawal of lifesustaining treatment. As the Court correctly observestoday, that assumption "was not simply deduced from
abstract concepts of personal autonomy." Ante, at 725. In-stead, it was supported by the common-law tradition protecting the individual's general right to refuse unwanted medicaltreatment. Ibid. We have recognized, however, that this
common-law right to refuse treatment is neither absolute noralways sufficiently weighty to overcome valid countervailing
state interests. As Justice Brennan pointed out in his Cruzan dissent, we have upheld legislation imposing punishmenton persons refusing to be vaccinated, 497 U. S., at 312, n. 12,

citing Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U. S. 11, 26-27 (1905),and as

Justice Scalia pointed out in his concurrence, theState ordinarily has the right to interfere with an attempt

to commit suicide by, for example, forcibly placing a bandageon a self-inflicted wound to stop the flow of blood. 497 U. S.,
at 298. In most cases, the individual's constitutionally pro-tected interest in his or her own physical autonomy, including the right to refuse unwanted medical treatment, will giveway to the State's interest in preserving human life.

Cruzan, however, was not the normal case. Given the ir-reversible nature of her illness and the progressive character
of her suffering,9 Nancy Cruzan's interest in refusing medicalcare was incidental to her more basic interest in controlling
the manner and timing of her death. In finding that her

Stevens, J., concurring in judgments
best interests would be served by cutting off the nourish-ment that kept her alive, the trial court did more than simply

vindicate Cruzan's interest in refusing medical treatment;the court, in essence, authorized affirmative conduct that
would hasten her death. When this Court reviewed thecase and upheld Missouri's requirement that there be clear
and convincing evidence establishing Nancy Cruzan's intentto have life-sustaining nourishment withdrawn, it made two
important assumptions: (1) that there was a "liberty inter-est" in refusing unwanted treatment protected by the Due
Process Clause; and (2) that this liberty interest did not "endthe inquiry" because it might be outweighed by relevant
state interests. Id., at 279. I agree with both of those as-sumptions, but I insist that the source of Nancy Cruzan's
right to refuse treatment was not just a common-law rule.Rather, this right is an aspect of a far broader and more
basic concept of freedom that is even older than the commonlaw.

10 This freedom embraces not merely a person's right

to refuse a particular kind of unwanted treatment, but alsoher interest in dignity, and in determining the character of

the memories that will survive long after her death.11 In

10 "[N]either the Bill of Rights nor the laws of sovereign States create
the liberty which the Due Process Clause protects. The relevant constitutional provisions are limitations on the power of the sovereign to infringe on the liberty of the citizen. The relevant state laws either create
property rights, or they curtail the freedom of the citizen who must live
in an ordered society. Of course, law is essential to the exercise and enjoyment of individual liberty in a complex society. But it is not the source
of liberty, and surely not the exclusive source.

"I had thought it self-evident that all men were endowed by their Creator with liberty as one of the cardinal unalienable rights. It is that basic
freedom which the Due Process Clause protects, rather than the particular
rights or privileges conferred by specific laws or regulations." Meachum
v. Fano, 427 U. S. 215, 230 (1976) (Stevens, J., dissenting).

11 "Nancy Cruzan's interest in life, no less than that of any other person,

includes an interest in how she will be thought of after her death by those
whose opinions mattered to her. There can be no doubt that her life made
her dear to her family and to others. How she dies will affect how that

Stevens, J., concurring in judgments
recognizing that the State's interests did not outweighNancy Cruzan's liberty interest in refusing medical treatment, Cruzan rested not simply on the common-law right torefuse medical treatment, but--at least implicitly--on the
even more fundamental right to make this "deeply personal
decision," id., at 289 (O'Connor, J., concurring).Thus, the common-law right to protection from battery,

which included the right to refuse medical treatment in mostcircumstances, did not mark "the outer limits of the substantive sphere of liberty" that supported the Cruzan family'sdecision to hasten Nancy's death.

Planned Parenthood of
Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833, 848 (1992). Those
limits have never been precisely defined. They are generally identified by the importance and character of the decision confronted by the individual, Whalen v. Roe, 429 U. S.
589, 599-600, n. 26 (1977). Whatever the outer limits of the
concept may be, it definitely includes protection for matters
"central to personal dignity and autonomy." Casey, 505
U. S., at 851. It includes

"the individual's right to make certain unusually important decisions that will affect his own, or his family's,
destiny. The Court has referred to such decisions as
implicating `basic values,' as being `fundamental,' and as
being dignified by history and tradition. The character
of the Court's language in these cases brings to mind
the origins of the American heritage of freedom--the

life is remembered." Cruzan v. Director, Mo. Dept. of Health, 497 U. S.
261, 344 (1990) (Stevens, J., dissenting).

"Each of us has an interest in the kind of memories that will survive
after death. To that end, individual decisions are often motivated by
their impact on others. A member of the kind of family identified in the
trial court's findings in this case would likely have not only a normal interest in minimizing the burden that her own illness imposes on others, but
also an interest in having their memories of her filled predominantly with
thoughts about her past vitality rather than her current condition." Id.,
at 356.

abiding interest in individual liberty that makes certainstate intrusions on the citizen's right to decide how he

will live his own life intolerable." Fitzgerald v. Porter
Memorial Hospital, 523 F. 2d 716, 719-720 (CA7 1975)
(footnotes omitted), cert. denied, 425 U. S. 916 (1976).

The Cruzan case demonstrated that some state intrusions
on the right to decide how death will be encountered are alsointolerable. The now-deceased plaintiffs in this action may

in fact have had a liberty interest even stronger than NancyCruzan's because, not only were they terminally ill, they
were suffering constant and severe pain. Avoiding intolerable pain and the indignity of living one's final days incapaci-tated and in agony is certainly "[a]t the heart of [the] liberty

. . . to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, ofthe universe, and of the mystery of human life."

Casey, 505
U. S., at 851.While I agree with the Court that

Cruzan does not decide
the issue presented by these cases, Cruzan did give recogni-tion, not just to vague, unbridled notions of autonomy, but to

the more specific interest in making decisions about how to
confront an imminent death. Although there is no absoluteright to physician-assisted suicide,

Cruzan makes it clear
that some individuals who no longer have the option of decid-ing whether to live or to die because they are already on the

threshold of death have a constitutionally protected interestthat may outweigh the State's interest in preserving life at
all costs. The liberty interest at stake in a case like thisdiffers from, and is stronger than, both the common-law right
to refuse medical treatment and the unbridled interest in
deciding whether to live or die. It is an interest in deciding
how, rather than whether, a critical threshold shall be
crossed.

III

The state interests supporting a general rule banning the
practice of physician-assisted suicide do not have the same

force in all cases. First and foremost of these interests isthe " `unqualified interest in the preservation of human life,' "

ante, at 728 (quoting Cruzan, 497 U. S., at 282), which isequated with " `the sanctity of life,' "

ante, at 728 (quoting
American Law Institute, Model Penal Code $ 210.5, Comment 5, p. 100 (Official Draft and Revised Comments 1980)).That interest not only justifies--it commands--maximum

protection of every individual's interest in remaining alive,which in turn commands the same protection for decisions
about whether to commence or to terminate life-support sys-tems or to administer pain medication that may hasten death.
Properly viewed, however, this interest is not a collective
interest that should always outweigh the interests of a person who because of pain, incapacity, or sedation finds her life
intolerable, but rather, an aspect of individual freedom.

Many terminally ill people find their lives meaningful even
if filled with pain or dependence on others. Some find value
in living through suffering; some have an abiding desire to
witness particular events in their families' lives; many believe it a sin to hasten death. Individuals of different religious faiths make different judgments and choices about
whether to live on under such circumstances. There are
those who will want to continue aggressive treatment; those
who would prefer terminal sedation; and those who will seek
withdrawal from life-support systems and death by gradual
starvation and dehydration. Although as a general matter
the State's interest in the contributions each person may
make to society outweighs the person's interest in ending her
life, this interest does not have the same force for a terminally ill patient faced not with the choice of whether to live,
only of how to die. Allowing the individual, rather than the
State, to make judgments " `about the "quality" of life that a
particular individual may enjoy,' " ante, at 729 (quoting Cruzan, 497 U. S., at 282), does not mean that the lives of terminally ill, disabled people have less value than the lives of
those who are healthy, see ante, at 732. Rather, it gives

747Cite as: 521 U. S. 702 (1997)
Stevens, J., concurring in judgments
proper recognition to the individual's interest in choosing afinal chapter that accords with her life story, rather than one

that demeans her values and poisons memories of her. SeeBrief for Bioethicists as

Amici Curiae 11; see also R. Dworkin, Life's Dominion 213 (1993) ("Whether it is in someone's
best interests that his life end in one way rather than an-other depends on so much else that is special about him--

about the shape and character of his life and his own senseof his integrity and critical interests--that no uniform collective decision can possibly hope to serve everyone evendecently").

Similarly, the State's legitimate interests in preventing
suicide, protecting the vulnerable from coercion and abuse,
and preventing euthanasia are less significant in this context.
I agree that the State has a compelling interest in preventing
persons from committing suicide because of depression or coercion by third parties. But the State's legitimate interest
in preventing abuse does not apply to an individual who is
not victimized by abuse, who is not suffering from depression, and who makes a rational and voluntary decision to
seek assistance in dying. Although, as the New York Task
Force report discusses, diagnosing depression and other
mental illness is not always easy, mental health workers and
other professionals expert in working with dying patients
can help patients cope with depression and pain, and help
patients assess their options. See Brief for Washington
State Psychological Association et al. as Amici Curiae 8-10.

Relatedly, the State and amici express the concern that
patients whose physical pain is inadequately treated will be
more likely to request assisted suicide. Encouraging the development and ensuring the availability of adequate pain
treatment is of utmost importance; palliative care, however,
cannot alleviate all pain and suffering. See Orentlicher,
Legalization of Physician Assisted Suicide: A Very Modest
Revolution, 38 Boston College L. Rev. (Galley, p. 8) (1997)
("Greater use of palliative care would reduce the demand for

assisted suicide, but it will not eliminate [it]"); see also Brief
for Coalition of Hospice Professionals as Amici Curiae 8 (citing studies showing that "[a]s death becomes more imminent,
pain and suffering become progressively more difficult to
treat"). An individual adequately informed of the care alternatives thus might make a rational choice for assisted suicide. For such an individual, the State's interest in preventing potential abuse and mistake is only minimally implicated.

The final major interest asserted by the State is its interest in preserving the traditional integrity of the medical profession. The fear is that a rule permitting physicians to assist in suicide is inconsistent with the perception that they
serve their patients solely as healers. But for some patients, it would be a physician's refusal to dispense medication to ease their suffering and make their death tolerable
and dignified that would be inconsistent with the healing
role. See Block & Billings, Patient Request to Hasten
Death, 154 Archives Internal Med. 2039, 2045 (1994) (A doctor's refusal to hasten death "may be experienced by the
[dying] patient as an abandonment, a rejection, or an expression of inappropriate paternalistic authority"). For doctors
who have longstanding relationships with their patients, who
have given their patients advice on alternative treatments,
who are attentive to their patient's individualized needs, and
who are knowledgeable about pain symptom management
and palliative care options, see Quill, Death and Dignity, A
Case of Individualized Decision Making, 324 New England J.
Med. 691-694 (1991), heeding a patient's desire to assist in
her suicide would not serve to harm the physician-patient
relationship. Furthermore, because physicians are already
involved in making decisions that hasten the death of terminally ill patients--through termination of life support, withholding of medical treatment, and terminal sedation--there
is in fact significant tension between the traditional view of

the physician's role and the actual practice in a growing num-ber of cases.

12

As the New York State Task Force on Life and the Lawrecognized, a State's prohibition of assisted suicide is justified by the fact that the " `ideal' " case in which "patientswould be screened for depression and offered treatment, effective pain medication would be available, and all patientswould have a supportive committed family and doctor" is not
the usual case. New York State Task Force on Life and theLaw, When Death Is Sought: Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia in the Medical Context 120 (May 1994). Although, as theCourt concludes today, these

potential harms are sufficientto support the State's general public policy against assisted

suicide, they will not always outweigh the individual liberty

12 I note that there is evidence that a significant number of physicians
support the practice of hastening death in particular situations. A survey
published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that 56% of responding doctors in Michigan preferred legalizing assisted suicide to an
explicit ban. Bachman et al., Attitudes of Michigan Physicians and the
Public Toward Legalizing Physician-Assisted Suicide and Voluntary Euthanasia, 334 New England J. Med. 303-309 (1996). In a survey of Oregon
doctors, 60% of the responding doctors supported legalizing assisted suicide for terminally ill patients. See Lee et al., Legalizing Assisted Suicide--Views of Physicians in Oregon, 335 New England J. Med. 310-315
(1996). Another study showed that 12% of physicians polled in Washington State reported that they had been asked by their terminally ill patients for prescriptions to hasten death, and that, in the year prior to the
study, 24% of those physicians had complied with such requests. See
Back, Wallace, Starks, & Perlman, Physician-Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia in Washington State, 275 JAMA 919-925 (1996); see also Doukas,
Waterhouse, Gorenflo, & Seld, Attitudes and Behaviors on PhysicianAssisted Death: A Study of Michigan Oncologists, 13 J. Clinical Oncology
1055 (1995) (reporting that 18% of responding Michigan oncologists reported active participation in assisted suicide); Slome, Moulton, Huffine,
Gorter, & Abrams, Physicians' Attitudes Toward Assisted Suicide in
AIDS, 5 J. Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes 712 (1992) (reporting
that 24% of responding physicians who treat AIDS patients would likely
grant a patient's request for assistance in hastening death).

interest of a particular patient. Unlike the Court of Ap-peals, I would not say as a categorical matter that these

state interests are invalid as to the entire class of terminallyill, mentally competent patients. I do not, however, foreclose the possibility that an individual plaintiff seeking tohasten her death, or a doctor whose assistance was sought,
could prevail in a more particularized challenge. Futurecases will determine whether such a challenge may succeed.

IV
In New York, a doctor must respect a competent person'sdecision to refuse or to discontinue medical treatment even

though death will thereby ensue, but the same doctor wouldbe guilty of a felony if she provided her patient assistance in
committing suicide.13 Today we hold that the Equal Protec-tion Clause is not violated by the resulting disparate treatment of two classes of terminally ill people who may havethe same interest in hastening death. I agree that the distinction between permitting death to ensue from an under-lying fatal disease and causing it to occur by the administration of medication or other means provides a constitutionallysufficient basis for the State's classification.

14 Unlike the

Court, however, see Vacco, post, at 801-802, I am not per-suaded that in all cases there will in fact be a significant

difference between the intent of the physicians, the patients,or the families in the two situations.

There may be little distinction between the intent of a ter-minally ill patient who decides to remove her life support
and one who seeks the assistance of a doctor in ending herlife; in both situations, the patient is seeking to hasten a certain, impending death. The doctor's intent might also bethe same in prescribing lethal medication as it is in terminat13 See Vacco v. Quill, post, at 797, nn. 1 and 2.
14 The American Medical Association recognized this distinction when it

supported Nancy Cruzan and continues to recognize this distinction in its
support of the States in these cases.

521US2 Unit: $U90 [11-23-99 18:50:39] PAGES PGT: OPFX

751Cite as: 521 U. S. 702 (1997)
Stevens, J., concurring in judgments
ing life support. A doctor who fails to administer medicaltreatment to one who is dying from a disease could be doing

so with an intent to harm or kill that patient. Conversely, adoctor who prescribes lethal medication does not necessarily
intend the patient's death--rather that doctor may seek sim-ply to ease the patient's suffering and to comply with her
wishes. The illusory character of any differences in intentor causation is confirmed by the fact that the American Medical Association unequivocally endorses the practice of ter-minal sedation--the administration of sufficient dosages of
pain-killing medication to terminally ill patients to protectthem from excruciating pain even when it is clear that the
time of death will be advanced. The purpose of terminalsedation is to ease the suffering of the patient and comply
with her wishes, and the actual cause of death is the adminis-tration of heavy doses of lethal sedatives. This same intent
and causation may exist when a doctor complies with a pa-tient's request for lethal medication to hasten her death.

15

Thus, although the differences the majority notes in causa-tion and intent between terminating life support and assisting in suicide support the Court's rejection of the respond-ents' facial challenge, these distinctions may be inapplicable
to particular terminally ill patients and their doctors. Ourholding today in Vacco v. Quill, post, p. 793, that the Equal
Protection Clause is not violated by New York's classifica-tion, just like our holding in

Washington v. Glucksberg thatthe Washington statute is not invalid on its face, does not

foreclose the possibility that some applications of the New

15 If a doctor prescribes lethal drugs to be self-administered by the patient, it is not at all clear that the physician's intent is that the patient
"be made dead," post, at 802 (internal quotation marks omitted). Many
patients prescribed lethal medications never actually take them; they
merely acquire some sense of control in the process of dying that the
availability of those medications provides. See Back, supra n. 12, at 922;
see also Quill, 324 New England J. Med., at 693 (describing how some
patients fear death less when they feel they have the option of physicianassisted suicide).

York statute may impose an intolerable intrusion on the patient's freedom.

There remains room for vigorous debate about the outcome of particular cases that are not necessarily resolved
by the opinions announced today. How such cases may be
decided will depend on their specific facts. In my judgment,
however, it is clear that the so-called "unqualified interest in
the preservation of human life," Cruzan, 497 U. S., at 282;
ante, at 728, is not itself sufficient to outweigh the interest
in liberty that may justify the only possible means of preserving a dying patient's dignity and alleviating her intolerable suffering.

Justice Souter, concurring in the judgment.
Three terminally ill individuals and four physicians who
sometimes treat terminally ill patients brought this challenge to the Washington statute making it a crime "knowingly . . . [to] ai[d] another person to attempt suicide," Wash.
Rev. Code $ 9A.36.060 (1994), claiming on behalf of both patients and physicians that it would violate substantive due
process to enforce the statute against a doctor who acceded
to a dying patient's request for a drug to be taken by the
patient to commit suicide. The question is whether the statute sets up one of those "arbitrary impositions" or "purposeless restraints" at odds with the Due Process Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment. Poe v. Ullman, 367 U. S. 497, 543
(1961) (Harlan, J., dissenting). I conclude that the statute's
application to the doctors has not been shown to be unconstitutional, but I write separately to give my reasons for analyzing the substantive due process claims as I do, and for
rejecting this one.

I

Although the terminally ill original parties have died during the pendency of this case, the four physicians who remain

Souter, J., concurring in judgment
as respondents here 1 continue to request declaratory and in-junctive relief for their own benefit in discharging their obligations to other dying patients who request their help.2See, e. g., Southern Pacific Terminal Co. v. ICC, 219 U. S.
498, 515 (1911) (question was capable of repetition yet evad-ing review). The case reaches us on an order granting summary judgment, and we must take as true the undisputedallegations that each of the patients was mentally competent
and terminally ill, and that each made a knowing and volun-tary choice to ask a doctor to prescribe "medications . . . to
be self-administered for the purpose of hastening . . . death."Complaint || 2.3. The State does not dispute that each faced
a passage to death more agonizing both mentally and physi-cally, and more protracted over time, than death by suicide
with a physician's help, or that each would have chosen sucha suicide for the sake of personal dignity, apart even from
relief from pain. Each doctor in this case claims to encoun-ter patients like the original plaintiffs who have died, that
is, mentally competent, terminally ill, and seeking medicalhelp in "the voluntary self-termination of life."

Id., |||| 2.5-2.8. While there may be no unanimity on the physician's

professional obligation in such circumstances, I accept hererespondents' representation that providing such patients
with prescriptions for drugs that go beyond pain relief tohasten death would, in these circumstances, be consistent
with standards of medical practice. Hence, I take it to betrue, as respondents say, that the Washington statute prevents the exercise of a physician's "best professional judg-ment to prescribe medications to [such] patients in dosages
that would enable them to act to hasten their own deaths."
Id., || 2.6; see also App. 35-37, 49-51, 55-57, 73-75.

1 A nonprofit corporation known as Compassion in Dying was also a
plaintiff and appellee below but is not a party in this Court.

2 As I will indicate in some detail below, I see the challenge to the statute not as facial but as-applied, and I understand it to be in narrower
terms than those accepted by the Court.

754 WASHINGTON v. GLUCKSBERG

Souter, J., concurring in judgment
In their brief to this Court, the doctors claim not that theyought to have a right generally to hasten patients' imminent

deaths, but only to help patients who have made "personaldecisions regarding their own bodies, medical care, and, fundamentally, the future course of their lives," Brief for Respondents 12, and who have concluded responsibly and withsubstantial justification that the brief and anguished remainders of their lives have lost virtually all value to them. Re-spondents fully embrace the notion that the State must be
free to impose reasonable regulations on such physician as-sistance to ensure that the patients they assist are indeed
among the competent and terminally ill and that each has
made a free and informed choice in seeking to obtain and use
a fatal drug. Complaint || 3.2; App. 28-41.

In response, the State argues that the interest asserted
by the doctors is beyond constitutional recognition because
it has no deep roots in our history and traditions. Brief for
Petitioners 21-25. But even aside from that, without disputing that the patients here were competent and terminally
ill, the State insists that recognizing the legitimacy of doctors' assistance of their patients as contemplated here would
entail a number of adverse consequences that the Washington Legislature was entitled to forestall. The nub of this
part of the State's argument is not that such patients are
constitutionally undeserving of relief on their own account,
but that any attempt to confine a right of physician assistance to the circumstances presented by these doctors is
likely to fail. Id., at 34-35, 44-47.

First, the State argues that the right could not be confined
to the terminally ill. Even assuming a fixed definition of
that term, the State observes that it is not always possible
to say with certainty how long a person may live. Id., at 34.
It asserts that "[t]here is no principled basis on which [the
right] can be limited to the prescription of medication for
terminally ill patients to administer to themselves" when the
right's justifying principle is as broad as " `merciful termina521US2 Unit: $U90 [11-23-99 18:50:39] PAGES PGT: OPFX

tion of suffering.' " Id., at 45 (citing Y. Kamisar, Are LawsAgainst Assisted Suicide Unconstitutional?, Hastings Center

Report 32, 36-37 (May- June 1993)). Second, the State ar-gues that the right could not be confined to the mentally
competent, observing that a person's competence cannot al-ways be assessed with certainty, Brief for Petitioners 34, and
suggesting further that no principled distinction is possiblebetween a competent patient acting independently and a patient acting through a duly appointed and competent surro-gate,

id., at 46. Next, according to the State, such a rightmight entail a right to or at least merge in practice into

"other forms of life-ending assistance," such as euthanasia.
Id., at 46-47. Finally, the State believes that a right to phy-sician assistance could not easily be distinguished from a

right to assistance from others, such as friends, family, andother health-care workers. Id., at 47. The State thus argues that recognition of the substantive due process right atissue here would jeopardize the lives of others outside the
class defined by the doctors' claim, creating risks of irrespon-sible suicides and euthanasia, whose dangers are concededly
within the State's authority to address.

II
When the physicians claim that the Washington law de-prives them of a right falling within the scope of liberty that

the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees against denial with-out due process of law,

3 they are not claiming some sort of

procedural defect in the process through which the statutehas been enacted or is administered. Their claim, rather, is

that the State has no substantively adequate justification forbarring the assistance sought by the patient and sought to
be offered by the physician. Thus, we are dealing with aclaim to one of those rights sometimes described as rights

3 The doctors also rely on the Equal Protection Clause, but that source
of law does essentially nothing in a case like this that the Due Process
Clause cannot do on its own.

of substantive due process and sometimes as unenumerated
rights, in view of the breadth and indeterminacy of the "due
process" serving as the claim's textual basis. The doctors
accordingly arouse the skepticism of those who find the Due
Process Clause an unduly vague or oxymoronic warrant for
judicial review of substantive state law, just as they also invoke two centuries of American constitutional practice in
recognizing unenumerated, substantive limits on governmental action. Although this practice has neither rested on
any single textual basis nor expressed a consistent theory
(or, before Poe v. Ullman, a much articulated one), a brief
overview of its history is instructive on two counts. The
persistence of substantive due process in our cases points to
the legitimacy of the modern justification for such judicial
review found in Justice Harlan's dissent in Poe,4 on which I
will dwell further on, while the acknowledged failures of
some of these cases point with caution to the difficulty raised
by the present claim.

Before the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, substantive constitutional review resting on a theory of unenumerated rights occurred largely in the state courts applying
state constitutions that commonly contained either due process clauses like that of the Fifth Amendment (and later the
Fourteenth) or the textual antecedents of such clauses, re4 The status of the Harlan dissent in Poe v. Ullman, 367 U. S. 497 (1961),
is shown by the Court's adoption of its result in Griswold v. Connecticut,
381 U. S. 479 (1965), and by the Court's acknowledgment of its status and
adoption of its reasoning in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v.
Casey, 505 U. S. 833, 848-849 (1992). See also Youngberg v. Romeo, 457
U. S. 307, 320 (1982) (citing Justice Harlan's Poe dissent as authority for
the requirement that this Court balance "the liberty of the individual" and
"the demands of an organized society"); Roberts v. United States Jaycees,
468 U. S. 609, 619 (1984); Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U. S. 494, 500-506,
and n. 12 (1977) (plurality opinion) (opinion for four Justices treating Justice Harlan's Poe dissent as a central explication of the methodology of
judicial review under the Due Process Clause).

peating Magna Carta's guarantee of "the law of the land." 5On the basis of such clauses, or of general principles untethered to specific constitutional language, state courts evalu-ated the constitutionality of a wide range of statutes.

Thus, a Connecticut court approved a statute legitimatinga class of previous illegitimate marriages, as falling within
the terms of the "social compact," while making clear itspower to review constitutionality in those terms.

Goshen v.Stonington, 4 Conn. 209, 225-226 (1822). In the same period, a specialized court of equity, created under a Tennesseestatute solely to hear cases brought by the state bank against
its debtors, found its own authorization unconstitutional as"partial" legislation violating the State Constitution's "law
of the land" clause. Bank of the State v. Cooper, 2 Yerg. 599,602-608 (Tenn. 1831) (opinion of Green, J.);

And the middle of the 19th century brought the famousWynehamer case, invalidating a statute purporting to render
possession of liquor immediately illegal except when kept fornarrow, specified purposes, the state court finding the statute inconsistent with the State's due process clause. Wynehamer v. People, 13 N. Y. 378, 486-487 (1856). The statutewas deemed an excessive threat to the "fundamental rights

of the citizen" to property. Id., at 398 (opinion of Comstock,J.). See generally E. Corwin, Liberty Against Government

the developments that would presage both the Civil War andthe ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, by making it

judiciary's power to strike down legislation that conflictedwith important but unenumerated principles of American

government. In most such instances, after declaring itspower to invalidate what it might find inconsistent with
rights of liberty and property, the Court nevertheless went
on to uphold the legislative Acts under review. See, e. g.,
Wilkinson v. Leland, 2 Pet. 627, 656-661 (1829); Calder v.
Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 386-395 (1798) (opinion of Chase, J.); seealso

Corfield v. Coryell, 6 F. Cas. 546, 550-552 (No. 3,230)
(CC ED Pa. 1823). But in Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 87(1810), the Court went further. It struck down an Act of

the Georgia Legislature that purported to rescind a sale of
public land ab initio and reclaim title for the State, and so
deprive subsequent, good-faith purchasers of property conveyed by the original grantees. The Court rested the invalidation on alternative sources of authority: the specific prohibitions against bills of attainder, ex post facto laws, laws
impairing contracts in Article I, $ 10, of the Constitution; and
"general principles which are common to our free institutions," by which Chief Justice Marshall meant that a simple
deprivation of property by the State could not be an authentically "legislative" Act. Fletcher, supra, at 135-139.

Fletcher was not, though, the most telling early example
of such review. For its most salient instance in this Court
before the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment was, of
course, the case that the Amendment would in due course
overturn, Dred Scott v. Sandford, 19 How. 393 (1857). Unlike Fletcher, Dred Scott was textually based on a Due Process Clause (in the Fifth Amendment, applicable to the National Government), and it was in reliance on that Clause's
protection of property that the Court invalidated the Missouri Compromise. 19 How., at 449-452. This substantive
protection of an owner's property in a slave taken to the
territories was traced to the absence of any enumerated
power to affect that property granted to the Congress by
Article I of the Constitution, id., at 451-452, the implication

being that the Government had no legitimate interest thatcould support the earlier congressional compromise. The

ensuing judgment of history needs no recounting here.After the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, with
its guarantee of due process protection against the States,interpretation of the words "liberty" and "property" as used
in Due Process Clauses became a sustained enterprise, withthe Court generally describing the due process criterion in
converse terms of reasonableness or arbitrariness. Thatstandard is fairly traceable to Justice Bradley's dissent in the
Slaughter-House Cases, 16 Wall. 36 (1873), in which he saidthat a person's right to choose a calling was an element of
liberty (as the calling, once chosen, was an aspect of prop-erty) and declared that the liberty and property protected
by due process are not truly recognized if such rights maybe "arbitrarily assailed," id., at 116.

6 After that, opinions

comparable to those that preceded Dred Scott expressedwillingness to review legislative action for consistency with

the Due Process Clause even as they upheld the laws in ques-tion. See, e. g., Bartemeyer v. Iowa, 18 Wall. 129, 133-135
(1874); Munn v. Illinois, 94 U. S. 113, 123-135 (1877); Rail-road Comm'n Cases, 116 U. S. 307, 331 (1886); Mugler v.

6 The Slaughter-House Cases are important, of course, for their holding
that the Privileges and Immunities Clause was no source of any but a
specific handful of substantive rights. 16 Wall., at 74-80. To a degree,
then, that decision may have led the Court to look to the Due Process
Clause as a source of substantive rights. In Twining v. New Jersey, 211
U. S. 78, 95-97 (1908), for example, the Court of the Lochner Era acknowledged the strength of the case against Slaughter-House's interpretation
of the Privileges or Immunities Clause but reaffirmed that interpretation
without questioning its own frequent reliance on the Due Process Clause
as authorization for substantive judicial review. See also J. Ely, Democracy and Distrust 14-30 (1980) (arguing that the Privileges and Immunities Clause and not the Due Process Clause is the proper warrant for
courts' substantive oversight of state legislation). But the courts' use of
Due Process Clauses for that purpose antedated the 1873 decision, as we
have seen, and would in time be supported in the Poe dissent, as we
shall see.

Kansas, 123 U. S. 623, 659-670 (1887). See generally Cor-win,

supra, at 121-136 (surveying the Court's early Fourteenth Amendment cases and finding little dissent from thegeneral principle that the Due Process Clause authorized judicial review of substantive statutes).

The theory became serious, however, beginning with Allgeyer v. Louisiana, 165 U. S. 578 (1897), where the Court
invalidated a Louisiana statute for excessive interferencewith Fourteenth Amendment liberty to contract,

id., at 588-
593, and offered a substantive interpretation of "liberty,"that in the aftermath of the so-called

Lochner Era has been
scaled back in some respects, but expanded in others, and
never repudiated in principle. The Court said that Fourteenth Amendment liberty includes "the right of the citizen
to be free in the enjoyment of all his faculties; to be free to
use them in all lawful ways; to live and work where he will;
to earn his livelihood by any lawful calling; to pursue any
livelihood or avocation; and for that purpose to enter into all
contracts which may be proper, necessary and essential to
his carrying out to a successful conclusion the purposes
above mentioned." Id., at 589. "[W]e do not intend to hold
that in no such case can the State exercise its police power,"
the Court added, but "[w]hen and how far such power may
be legitimately exercised with regard to these subjects must
be left for determination to each case as it arises." Id., at
590.

Although this principle was unobjectionable, what followed for a season was, in the realm of economic legislation,
the echo of Dred Scott. Allgeyer was succeeded within a
decade by Lochner v. New York, 198 U. S. 45 (1905), and the
era to which that case gave its name, famous now for striking
down as arbitrary various sorts of economic regulations that
post-New Deal courts have uniformly thought constitutionally sound. Compare, e. g., id., at 62 (finding New York's
maximum-hours law for bakers "unreasonable and entirely
arbitrary"), and Adkins v. Children's Hospital of D. C., 261

521US2 Unit: $U90 [11-23-99 18:50:39] PAGES PGT: OPFX

U. S. 525, 559 (1923) (holding a minimum-wage law "soclearly the product of a naked, arbitrary exercise of power

that it cannot be allowed to stand under the Constitution ofthe United States"), with

West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish,
300 U. S. 379, 391 (1937) (overruling Adkins and approving a
minimum-wage law on the principle that "regulation whichis reasonable in relation to its subject and is adopted in the

interests of the community is due process"). As the paren-theticals here suggest, while the cases in the

Lochner line
routinely invoked a correct standard of constitutional ar-bitrariness review, they harbored the spirit of

Dred Scott
in their absolutist implementation of the standard they
espoused.

Even before the deviant economic due process cases had
been repudiated, however, the more durable precursors of
modern substantive due process were reaffirming this
Court's obligation to conduct arbitrariness review, beginning
with Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U. S. 390 (1923). Without referring to any specific guarantee of the Bill of Rights, the
Court invoked precedents from the Slaughter-House Cases
through Adkins to declare that the Fourteenth Amendment
protected "the right of the individual to contract, to engage
in any of the common occupations of life, to acquire useful
knowledge, to marry, establish a home and bring up children,
to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience, and generally to enjoy those privileges long recognized at common law as essential to the orderly pursuit of
happiness by free men." 262 U. S., at 399. The Court then
held that the same Fourteenth Amendment liberty included
a teacher's right to teach and the rights of parents to direct
their children's education without unreasonable interference
by the States, id., at 400, with the result that Nebraska's
prohibition on the teaching of foreign languages in the lower
grades was "arbitrary and without reasonable relation to any
end within the competency of the State," id., at 403. See
also Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U. S. 510, 534-536 (1925)

521US2 Unit: $U90 [11-23-99 18:50:39] PAGES PGT: OPFX
762 WASHINGTON v. GLUCKSBERG

Souter, J., concurring in judgment
(finding that a statute that all but outlawed private schoolslacked any "reasonable relation to some purpose within the

competency of the State"); Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U. S.319, 327-328 (1937) ("[E]ven in the field of substantive rights
and duties the legislative judgment, if oppressive and arbitrary, may be overridden by the courts." "Is that [injury]to which the statute has subjected [the appellant] a hardship

so acute and shocking that our polity will not endure it?Does it violate those fundamental principles of liberty and
justice which lie at the base of all our civil and political insti-tutions?" (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).

After Meyer and Pierce, two further opinions took the
major steps that lead to the modern law. The first was not
even in a due process case but one about equal protection,
Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson, 316 U. S. 535
(1942), where the Court emphasized the "fundamental" nature of individual choice about procreation and so foreshadowed not only the later prominence of procreation as a subject of liberty protection, but the corresponding standard of
"strict scrutiny," in this Court's Fourteenth Amendment law.
See id., at 541. Skinner, that is, added decisions regarding
procreation to the list of liberties recognized in Meyer and
Pierce and loosely suggested, as a gloss on their standard of
arbitrariness, a judicial obligation to scrutinize any impingement on such an important interest with heightened care.
In so doing, it suggested a point that Justice Harlan would
develop, that the kind and degree of justification that a sensitive judge would demand of a State would depend on the
importance of the interest being asserted by the individual.
Poe, 367 U. S., at 543.

The second major opinion leading to the modern doctrine
was Justice Harlan's Poe dissent just cited, the conclusion of
which was adopted in Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479
(1965), and the authority of which was acknowledged in
Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S.
833 (1992). See also n. 4, supra. The dissent is important

Souter, J., concurring in judgment
for three things that point to our responsibilities today. Thefirst is Justice Harlan's respect for the tradition of substantive due process review itself, and his acknowledgment ofthe Judiciary's obligation to carry it on. For two centuries
American courts, and for much of that time this Court, have
thought it necessary to provide some degree of review overthe substantive content of legislation under constitutional

standards of textual breadth. The obligation was under-stood before

Dred Scott and has continued after the repudiation of Lochner's progeny, most notably on the subjects ofsegregation in public education,

U. S. 1, 12 (1967), marital privacy and contraception, Carey
v. Population Services Int'l, 431 U. S. 678, 684-691 (1977);
Griswold v. Connecticut, supra, at 481-486, abortion,
Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, supra,
at 849, 869-879 ( joint opinion of O'Connor, Kennedy, and
Souter, JJ.); Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113, 152-166 (1973), personal control of medical treatment, Cruzan v. Director, Mo.
Dept. of Health, 497 U. S. 261, 287-289 (1990) (O'Connor, J.,
concurring); id., at 302 (Brennan, J., dissenting); id., at 331
(Stevens, J., dissenting); see also id., at 278 (majority opinion), and physical confinement, Foucha v. Louisiana, 504
U. S. 71, 80-83 (1992). This enduring tradition of American
constitutional practice is, in Justice Harlan's view, nothing
more than what is required by the judicial authority and obligation to construe constitutional text and review legislation
for conformity to that text. See Marbury v. Madison, 1
Cranch 137 (1803). Like many judges who preceded him
and many who followed, he found it impossible to construe
the text of due process without recognizing substantive, and
not merely procedural, limitations. "Were due process
merely a procedural safeguard it would fail to reach those
situations where the deprivation of life, liberty or property
was accomplished by legislation which by operating in the
future could, given even the fairest possible procedure in ap521US2 Unit: $U90 [11-23-99 18:50:39] PAGES PGT: OPFX

plication to individuals, nevertheless destroy the enjoymentof all three."

Poe, supra, at 541.7 The text of the Due
Process Clause thus imposes nothing less than an obligationto give substantive content to the words "liberty" and "due

process of law."

Following the first point of the Poe dissent, on the neces-sity to engage in the sort of examination we conduct today,

the dissent's second and third implicitly address those cases,already noted, that are now condemned with virtual unanimity as disastrous mistakes of substantive due process review.The second of the dissent's lessons is a reminder that the
business of such review is not the identification of extratex-tual absolutes but scrutiny of a legislative resolution (perhaps unconscious) of clashing principles, each quite possibly
worthy in and of itself, but each to be weighed within thehistory of our values as a people. It is a comparison of the

relative strengths of opposing claims that informs the judicial task, not a deduction from some first premise. Thus informed, judicial review still has no warrant to substitute one
reasonable resolution of the contending positions for another,
but authority to supplant the balance already struck between
the contenders only when it falls outside the realm of the
reasonable. Part III, below, deals with this second point,
and also with the dissent's third, which takes the form of an

7 Judge Johnson of the New York Court of Appeals had made the point
more obliquely a century earlier when he wrote that "the form of this
declaration of right, `no person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property, without due process of law,' necessarily imports that the legislature
cannot make the mere existence of the rights secured the occasion of depriving a person of any of them, even by the forms which belong to `due
process of law.' For if it does not necessarily import this, then the legislative power is absolute." And, "[t]o provide for a trial to ascertain
whether a man is in the enjoyment of [any] of these rights, and then, as a
consequence of finding that he is in the enjoyment of it, to deprive him of
it, is doing indirectly just what is forbidden to be done directly, and reduces the constitutional provision to a nullity." Wynehamer v. People, 13
N. Y. 378, 420 (1856).

object lesson in the explicit attention to detail that is no lessessential to the intellectual discipline of substantive due

process review than an understanding of the basic need toaccount for the two sides in the controversy and to respect
legislation within the zone of reasonableness.

III
My understanding of unenumerated rights in the wake ofthe Poe dissent and subsequent cases avoids the absolutist

failing of many older cases without embracing the oppositepole of equating reasonableness with past practice described
at a very specific level. See Planned Parenthood of South-eastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S., at 847-849. That understanding begins with a concept of "ordered liberty," Poe, 367U. S., at 549 (Harlan, J.); see also

Griswold, 381 U. S., at 500,comprising a continuum of rights to be free from "arbitrary

impositions and purposeless restraints," Poe, 367 U. S., at 543(Harlan, J., dissenting).

"Due Process has not been reduced to any formula; itscontent cannot be determined by reference to any code.
The best that can be said is that through the course ofthis Court's decisions it has represented the balance
which our Nation, built upon postulates of respect forthe liberty of the individual, has struck between that
liberty and the demands of organized society. If thesupplying of content to this Constitutional concept has
of necessity been a rational process, it certainly has notbeen one where judges have felt free to roam where unguided speculation might take them. The balance ofwhich I speak is the balance struck by this country, having regard to what history teaches are the traditionsfrom which it developed as well as the traditions from
which it broke. That tradition is a living thing. A de-cision of this Court which radically departs from it could
not long survive, while a decision which builds on whathas survived is likely to be sound. No formula could

serve as a substitute, in this area, for judgment and re-straint." Id., at 542.

See also Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U. S. 494, 503 (1977)(plurality opinion of Powell, J.) ("Appropriate limits on substantive due process come not from drawing arbitrary linesbut rather from careful `respect for the teachings of history
[and] solid recognition of the basic values that underlie oursociety' ") (quoting Griswold, supra, at 501 (Harlan, J.,
concurring)).After the

Poe dissent, as before it, this enforceable conceptof liberty would bar statutory impositions even at relatively

trivial levels when governmental restraints are undeniablyirrational as unsupported by any imaginable rationale. See,
e. g., United States v. Carolene Products Co., 304 U. S. 144,152 (1938) (economic legislation "not . . . unconstitutional
unless . . . facts . . . preclude the assumption that it restsupon some rational basis"); see also

Poe, supra, at 545, 548(Harlan, J., dissenting) (referring to usual "presumption of

constitutionality" and ordinary test "going merely to theplausibility of [a statute's] underlying rationale"). Such instances are suitably rare. The claims of arbitrariness thatmark almost all instances of unenumerated substantive
rights are those resting on "certain interests requir[ing] par-ticularly careful scrutiny of the state needs asserted to justify their abridgment[,] [c]f. Skinner v. Oklahoma [ex rel.
Williamson, 316 U. S. 535 (1942)]; Bolling v. Sharpe, [347U. S. 497 (1954)]," id., at 543; that is, interests in liberty sufficiently important to be judged "fundamental," id., at 548;see also id., at 541 (citing Corfield v. Coryell, 4 Wash. C. C.
371, 380 (CC ED Pa. 1825)). In the face of an interest thispowerful a State may not rest on threshold rationality or a
presumption of constitutionality, but may prevail only on theground of an interest sufficiently compelling to place within
the realm of the reasonable a refusal to recognize the individ-ual right asserted.

Poe, supra, at 548 (Harlan, J., dissent-ing) (an "enactment involv[ing] . . . a most fundamental as521US2 Unit: $U90 [11-23-99 18:50:39] PAGES PGT: OPFX

pect of `liberty' . . . [is] subjec[t] to `strict scrutiny' ") (quoting
Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson, 316 U. S., at 541); 8

9

This approach calls for a court to assess the relative
"weights" or dignities of the contending interests, and to thisextent the judicial method is familiar to the common law.

Common-law method is subject, however, to two importantconstraints in the hands of a court engaged in substantive
due process review. First, such a court is bound to confinethe values that it recognizes to those truly deserving constitutional stature, either to those expressed in constitutionaltext, or those exemplified by "the traditions from which [the
Nation] developed," or revealed by contrast with "the traditions from which it broke." Poe, 367 U. S., at 542 (Harlan,
J., dissenting). " `We may not draw on our merely personal
and private notions and disregard the limits . . . derived from

8 We have made it plain, of course, that not every law that incidentally
makes it somewhat harder to exercise a fundamental liberty must be justified by a compelling counterinterest. See Casey, 505 U. S., at 872-876
(joint opinion of O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ.); Carey v. Population Services Int'l, 431 U. S. 678, 685-686 (1977) ("[A]n individual's [constitutionally protected] liberty to make choices regarding contraception does
not . . . automatically invalidate every state regulation in this area. The
business of manufacturing and selling contraceptives may be regulated in
ways that do not [even] infringe protected individual choices"). But a
state law that creates a "substantial obstacle," Casey, supra, at 877, for
the exercise of a fundamental liberty interest requires a commensurably
substantial justification in order to place the legislation within the realm
of the reasonable.

9 Justice Harlan thus recognized just what the Court today assumes,

that by insisting on a threshold requirement that the interest (or, as the
Court puts it, the right) be fundamental before anything more than rational basis justification is required, the Court ensures that not every case
will require the "complex balancing" that heightened scrutiny entails.
See ante, at 722.

considerations that are fused in the whole nature of our judi-cial process . . . [,] considerations deeply rooted in reason and

in the compelling traditions of the legal profession.' " Id.,at 544-545 (quoting Rochin v. California, 342 U. S. 165, 170-
171 (1952)); see also Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U. S., at 325(looking to " `principle[s] of justice so rooted in the traditions
and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamen-tal' ") (quoting

Snyder v. Massachusetts, 291 U. S. 97, 105(1934)).

The second constraint, again, simply reflects the fact thatconstitutional review, not judicial lawmaking, is a court's
business here. The weighing or valuing of contending inter-ests in this sphere is only the first step, forming the basis
for determining whether the statute in question falls insideor outside the zone of what is reasonable in the way it resolves the conflict between the interests of state and individ-ual. See,

e. g., Poe, supra, at 553 (Harlan, J., dissenting);Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U. S. 307, 320-321 (1982). It is

no justification for judicial intervention merely to identify areasonable resolution of contending values that differs from
the terms of the legislation under review. It is only whenthe legislation's justifying principle, critically valued, is so
far from being commensurate with the individual interest asto be arbitrarily or pointlessly applied that the statute must
give way. Only if this standard points against the statutecan the individual claimant be said to have a constitutional
right. See Cruzan v. Director, Mo. Dept. of Health, 497U. S., at 279 ("[D]etermining that a person has a `liberty interest' under the Due Process Clause does not end the in-quiry; `whether [the individual's] constitutional rights have

The Poe dissent thus reminds us of the nature of review
for reasonableness or arbitrariness and the limitations entailed by it. But the opinion cautions against the repetition
of past error in another way as well, more by its example
than by any particular statement of constitutional method: it
reminds us that the process of substantive review by reasoned judgment, Poe, 367 U. S., at 542-544, is one of close
criticism going to the details of the opposing interests and to
their relationships with the historically recognized principles
that lend them weight or value.

Although the Poe dissent disclaims the possibility of any
general formula for due process analysis (beyond the basic
analytic structure just described), see id., at 542, 544, Justice
Harlan of course assumed that adjudication under the Due
Process Clauses is like any other instance of judgment dependent on common-law method, being more or less persuasive according to the usual canons of critical discourse. See
also Casey, 505 U. S., at 849 ("The inescapable fact is that
adjudication of substantive due process claims may call upon
the Court in interpreting the Constitution to exercise that
same capacity which by tradition courts always have exercised: reasoned judgment"). When identifying and assessing the competing interests of liberty and authority, for ex541 (1942)); Poe, supra, at 543 (Harlan, J., dissenting) ("certain interests"
must bring "particularly careful scrutiny"); Casey, 505 U. S., at 851 ("protected liberty"); Cruzan v. Director, Mo. Dept. of Health, 497 U. S. 261,
278 (1990) ("constitutionally protected liberty interest"); Youngberg v.
Romeo, 457 U. S., at 315 ("liberty interests"), and at times we have also
called such an interest a "right" even before balancing it against the government's interest, see, e. g., Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113, 153-154 (1973);
Carey v. Population Services Int'l, supra, at 686, 688, and n. 5; Poe, supra,
at 541 ("rights `which are . . . fundamental' ") (quoting Corfield v. Coryell,
4 Wash. C. C. 371, 380 (CC ED Pa. 1825)). Precision in terminology, however, favors reserving the label "right" for instances in which the individual's liberty interest actually trumps the government's countervailing interests; only then does the individual have anything legally enforceable as
against the State's attempt at regulation.

ample, the breadth of expression that a litigant or a judgeselects in stating the competing principles will have much to

do with the outcome and may be dispositive. As in anyprocess of rational argumentation, we recognize that when a
generally accepted principle is challenged, the broader the
attack the less likely it is to succeed. The principle's defend-ers will, indeed, often try to characterize any challenge as

just such a broadside, perhaps by couching the defense as ifa broadside attack had occurred. So the Court in

Dred Scott
treated prohibition of slavery in the Territories as nothingless than a general assault on the concept of property. See

19 How., at 449-452.

Just as results in substantive due process cases are tied
to the selections of statements of the competing interests,
the acceptability of the results is a function of the good reasons for the selections made. It is here that the value of
common-law method becomes apparent, for the usual thinking of the common law is suspicious of the all-or-nothing
analysis that tends to produce legal petrification instead of
an evolving boundary between the domains of old principles.
Common-law method tends to pay respect instead to detail,
seeking to understand old principles afresh by new examples
and new counterexamples. The "tradition is a living thing,"
Poe, 367 U. S., at 542 (Harlan, J., dissenting), albeit one that
moves by moderate steps carefully taken. "The decision of
an apparently novel claim must depend on grounds which
follow closely on well-accepted principles and criteria. The
new decision must take its place in relation to what went
before and further [cut] a channel for what is to come." Id.,
at 544 (Harlan, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks omitted). Exact analysis and characterization of any due process claim are critical to the method and to the result.

So, in Poe, Justice Harlan viewed it as essential to the
plaintiffs' claimed right to use contraceptives that they
sought to do so within the privacy of the marital bedroom.
This detail in fact served two crucial and complementary

Souter, J., concurring in judgment
functions, and provides a lesson for today. It rescued theindividuals' claim from a breadth that would have threatened

all state regulation of contraception or intimate relations; ex-tramarital intimacy, no matter how privately practiced, was
outside the scope of the right Justice Harlan would have rec-ognized in that case. See

id., at 552-553. It was, more-over, this same restriction that allowed the interest to be

valued as an aspect of a broader liberty to be free from allunreasonable intrusions into the privacy of the home and the
family life within it, a liberty exemplified in constitutionalprovisions such as the Third and Fourth Amendments, in
prior decisions of the Court involving unreasonable intru-sions into the home and family life, and in the then-prevailing
status of marriage as the sole lawful locus of intimate rela-tions.

Id., at 548, 551.11 The individuals' interest wastherefore at its peak in Poe, because it was supported by a

principle that distinguished of its own force between areasin which government traditionally had regulated (sexual relations outside of marriage) and those in which it had not(private marital intimacies), and thus was broad enough to
cover the claim at hand without being so broad as to be shot-through by exceptions.

11 Thus, as the Poe dissent illustrates, the task of determining whether
the concrete right claimed by an individual in a particular case falls within
the ambit of a more generalized protected liberty requires explicit analysis
when what the individual wants to do could arguably be characterized as
belonging to different strands of our legal tradition requiring different
degrees of constitutional scrutiny. See also Tribe & Dorf, Levels of Generality in the Definition of Rights, 57 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1057, 1091 (1990)
(abortion might conceivably be assimilated either to the tradition regarding women's reproductive freedom in general, which places a substantial
burden of justification on the State, or to the tradition regarding protection of fetuses, as embodied in laws criminalizing feticide by someone
other than the mother, which generally requires only rationality on the
part of the State). Selecting among such competing characterizations demands reasoned judgment about which broader principle, as exemplified
in the concrete privileges and prohibitions embodied in our legal tradition,
best fits the particular claim asserted in a particular case.

772 WASHINGTON v. GLUCKSBERG

Souter, J., concurring in judgment
On the other side of the balance, the State's interest inPoe was not fairly characterized simply as preserving sexual

morality, or doing so by regulating contraceptive devices.Just as some of the earlier cases went astray by speaking
without nuance of individual interests in property or auton-omy to contract for labor, so the State's asserted interest in
Poe was not immune to distinctions turning (at least poten-tially) on the precise purpose being pursued and the collateral consequences of the means chosen, see id., at 547-548.It was assumed that the State might legitimately enforce
limits on the use of contraceptives through laws regulatingdivorce and annulment, or even through its tax policy,

ibid.,but not necessarily be justified in criminalizing the same

practice in the marital bedroom, which would entail theconsequence of authorizing state enquiry into the intimate
relations of a married couple who chose to close their door,
id., at 548-549. See also Casey, 505 U. S., at 869 (strengthof State's interest in potential life varies depending on

precise context and character of regulation pursuing thatinterest).

The same insistence on exactitude lies behind questions,in current terminology, about the proper level of generality
at which to analyze claims and counterclaims, and the de-mand for fitness and proper tailoring of a restrictive statute
is just another way of testing the legitimacy of the generalityat which the government sets up its justification.

12 We may

12 The dual dimensions of the strength and the fitness of the government's interest are succinctly captured in the so-called "compelling interest test," under which regulations that substantially burden a constitutionally protected (or "fundamental") liberty may be sustained only if

"narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest," Reno v. Flores,
507 U. S. 292, 302 (1993); see also, e. g., Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S., at 155;
Carey v. Population Services Int'l, 431 U. S., at 686. How compelling the
interest and how narrow the tailoring must be will depend, of course, not
only on the substantiality of the individual's own liberty interest, but also
on the extent of the burden placed upon it, see Casey, 505 U. S., at 871-874
(opinion of O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ.); Carey, supra, at 686.

therefore classify Justice Harlan's example of proper analysisin any of these ways: as applying concepts of normal critical

reasoning, as pointing to the need to attend to the levels ofgenerality at which countervailing interests are stated, or as
examining the concrete application of principles for fitnesswith their own ostensible justifications. But whatever the
categories in which we place the dissent's example, it standsin marked contrast to earlier cases whose reasoning was
marked by comparatively less discrimination, and it pointsto the importance of evaluating the claims of the parties now
before us with comparable detail. For here we are facedwith an individual claim not to a right on the part of just
anyone to help anyone else commit suicide under any circum-stances, but to the right of a narrow class to help others also
in a narrow class under a set of limited circumstances. Andthe claimants are met with the State's assertion, among others, that rights of such narrow scope cannot be recognizedwithout jeopardy to individuals whom the State may concededly protect through its regulations.

the fact that to a substantial extent the State has repudiatedthat history. The result of this, respondents say, is to open

the door to claims of such a patient to be accorded one of theoptions open to those with different, traditionally cognizable

claims to autonomy in deciding how their bodies and mindsshould be treated. They seek the option to obtain the services of a physician to give them the benefit of advice andmedical help, which is said to enjoy a tradition so strong
and so devoid of specifically countervailing state concern thatdenial of a physician's help in these circumstances is arbitrary when physicians are generally free to advise and aidthose who exercise other rights to bodily autonomy.

The dominant western legal codes long condemned suicideand treated either its attempt or successful accomplishment

as a crime, the one subjecting the individual to penalties, theother penalizing his survivors by designating the suicide's
property as forfeited to the government. See 4 W. Black-stone, Commentaries *188-*189 (commenting that English
law considered suicide to be "ranked . . . among the highestcrimes" and deemed persuading another to commit suicide to
be murder); see generally Marzen, O'Dowd, Crone, & Balch,Suicide: A Constitutional Right?, 24 Duquesne L. Rev. 1,
56-63 (1985). While suicide itself has generally not beenconsidered a punishable crime in the United States, largely
because the common-law punishment of forfeiture was re-jected as improperly penalizing an innocent family, see id.,
at 98-99, most States have consistently punished the act ofassisting a suicide as either a common-law or statutory crime
and some continue to view suicide as an unpunishable crime.See generally id., at 67-100, 148-242.

criminalized attempted suicide, though neither State still does so. See

legislature recognized common-law crimes by statute in 1788. See Act of

tions on such assistance remain widespread, as exemplifiedin the Washington statute in question here.

The principal significance of this history in the State ofWashington, according to respondents, lies in its repudiation

Feb. 21, 1788, ch. 37, $ 2, 1788 N. Y. Laws 664 (codified at 2 N. Y. Laws 73
(Greenleaf 1792)). In 1828, New York changed the common-law offense of
assisting suicide from murder to manslaughter in the first degree. See 2
N. Y. Rev. Stat. pt. 4, ch. 1, tit. 2, art. 1, $ 7, p. 661 (1829). In 1881, New
York adopted a new penal code making attempted suicide a crime punishable by two years in prison, a fine, or both, and retaining the criminal
prohibition against assisting suicide as manslaughter in the first degree.
Act of July 26, 1881, ch. 676, $$ 172-178, 1881 N. Y. Laws (3 Penal Code),
pp. 42-43 (codified at 4 N. Y. Consolidated Laws, Penal Law $$ 2300-

2306, pp. 2809-2810 (1909)). In 1919, New York repealed the statutory
provision making attempted suicide a crime. See Act of May 5, 1919, ch.
414, $ 1, 1919 N. Y. Laws 1193. The 1937 New York Report of the Law
Revision Commission found that the history of the ban on assisting suicide
was "traceable into the ancient common law when a suicide or felo de se
was guilty of crime punishable by forfeiture of his goods and chattels."
State of New York, Report of the Law Revision Commission for 1937,
p. 830. The report stated that since New York had removed "all stigma
[of suicide] as a crime" and that "[s]ince liability as an accessory could no
longer hinge upon the crime of a principal, it was necessary to define it as
a substantive offense." Id., at 831. In 1965, New York revised its penal
law, providing that a "person is guilty of manslaughter in the second degree when . . . he intentionally causes or aids another person to commit
suicide." Penal Law, ch. 1030, 1965 N. Y. Laws 2387 (codified at N. Y.
Penal Law $ 125.15(3) (McKinney 1975)).

Washington's first territorial legislature designated assisting another
"in the commission of self-murder" to be manslaughter, see Act of Apr. 28,
1854, $ 17, 1854 Wash. Laws 78, and reenacted the provision in 1869 and
1873, see Act of Dec. 2, 1869, $ 17, 1869 Wash. Laws 201; Act of Nov. 10,
1873, $ 19, 1873 Wash. Laws 184 (codified at Wash. Code $ 794 (1881)). In
1909, the state legislature enacted a law based on the 1881 New York law
and a similar one enacted in Minnesota, see Marzen, O'Dowd, Crone,
& Balch, 24 Duquesne L. Rev., at 206, making attempted suicide a
crime punishable by two years in prison or a fine, and retaining the criminal prohibition against assisting suicide, designating it manslaughter.

of the old tradition to the extent of eliminating the criminal
suicide prohibitions. Respondents do not argue that the
State's decision goes further, to imply that the State has
repudiated any legitimate claim to discourage suicide or to
limit its encouragement. The reasons for the decriminalization, after all, may have had more to do with difficulties of
law enforcement than with a shift in the value ascribed to

(1910)). In 1975, the Washington Legislature repealed these provisions,
see Wash. Crim. Code, 1975, ch. 260, $ 9A.92.010 (213-217), 1975 Wash.
Laws 817, 858, 866, and enacted the ban on assisting suicide at issue in
this case, see Wash. Crim. Code, 1975, ch. 260, $ 9A.36.060, 1975 Wash.
Laws 817, 836, codified at Rev. Wash. Code $ 9A.36.060 (1977). The decriminalization of attempted suicide reflected the view that a person compelled to attempt it should not be punished if the attempt proved unsuccessful. See Compassion in Dying v. Washington, 850 F. Supp. 1454,
1464, n. 9 (WD Wash. 1994) (citing Legislative Council Judiciary Committee, Report on the Revised Washington Criminal Code 153 (Dec. 3, 1970).

life in various circumstances or in the perceived legitimacyof taking one's own. See,

e. g., Kamisar, Physician-Assisted
Suicide: The Last Bridge to Active Voluntary Euthanasia, inEuthanasia Examined 225, 229 (J. Keown ed. 1995); CeloCruz,

Aid-in-Dying: Should We Decriminalize Physician-Assisted
Suicide and Physician-Committed Euthanasia?, 18 Am.J. L. & Med. 369, 375 (1992); Marzen, O'Dowd, Crone, &

Balch, 24 Duquesne L. Rev., at 98-99. Thus it may indeedmake sense for the State to take its hands off suicide as such,
while continuing to prohibit the sort of assistance that wouldmake its commission easier. See,

e. g., American Law Institute, Model Penal Code $ 210.5, Comment 5 (1980). Decriminalization does not, then, imply the existence of a constitutional liberty interest in suicide as such; it simply opens the
door to the assertion of a cognizable liberty interest in bodily
integrity and associated medical care that would otherwise
have been inapposite so long as suicide, as well as assisting
a suicide, was a criminal offense.

This liberty interest in bodily integrity was phrased in a
general way by then-Judge Cardozo when he said, "[e]very
human being of adult years and sound mind has a right to
determine what shall be done with his own body" in relation
to his medical needs. Schloendorff v. Society of New York
Hospital, 211 N. Y. 125, 129, 105 N. E. 92, 93 (1914). The
familiar examples of this right derive from the common law
of battery and include the right to be free from medical invasions into the body, Cruzan v. Director, Mo. Dept. of Health,
497 U. S., at 269-279, as well as a right generally to resist
enforced medication, see Washington v. Harper, 494 U. S.
210, 221-222, 229 (1990). Thus "[i]t is settled now . . . that
the Constitution places limits on a State's right to interfere
with a person's most basic decisions about . . . bodily integrity." Casey, 505 U. S., at 849 (citations omitted); see also

U. S., at 172. Constitutional recognition of the right tobodily integrity underlies the assumed right, good against

the State, to require physicians to terminate artificial lifesupport,

Cruzan, supra, at 279 ("[W]e assume that the
United States Constitution would grant a competent person
a constitutionally protected right to refuse lifesaving hydra-tion and nutrition"), and the affirmative right to obtain medical intervention to cause abortion, see Casey, supra, at 857,896; cf.

Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S., at 153.
It is, indeed, in the abortion cases that the most tellingrecognitions of the importance of bodily integrity and the

concomitant tradition of medical assistance have occurred.
In Roe v. Wade, the plaintiff contended that the Texas statute making it criminal for any person to "procure an abortion," id., at 117, for a pregnant woman was unconstitutional
insofar as it prevented her from "terminat[ing] her pregnancy by an abortion `performed by a competent, licensed
physician, under safe, clinical conditions,' " id., at 120, and in
striking down the statute we stressed the importance of the
relationship between patient and physician, see id., at 153,
156.

The analogies between the abortion cases and this one are
several. Even though the State has a legitimate interest in
discouraging abortion, see Casey, supra, at 871 ( joint opinion
of O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ.); Roe, 410 U. S., at
162, the Court recognized a woman's right to a physician's
counsel and care. Like the decision to commit suicide, the
decision to abort potential life can be made irresponsibly and
under the influence of others, and yet the Court has held in
the abortion cases that physicians are fit assistants. Without physician assistance in abortion, the woman's right would
have too often amounted to nothing more than a right to
self-mutilation, and without a physician to assist in the suicide of the dying, the patient's right will often be confined to
crude methods of causing death, most shocking and painful
to the decedent's survivors.

Souter, J., concurring in judgment
There is, finally, one more reason for claiming that a physician's assistance here would fall within the accepted tradition
of medical care in our society, and the abortion cases are only
the most obvious illustration of the further point. While the
Court has held that the performance of abortion procedures
can be restricted to physicians, the Court's opinion in Roe
recognized the doctors' role in yet another way. For, in the
course of holding that the decision to perform an abortion
called for a physician's assistance, the Court recognized that
the good physician is not just a mechanic of the human body
whose services have no bearing on a person's moral choices,
but one who does more than treat symptoms, one who ministers to the patient. See id., at 153; see also Griswold v.
Connecticut, 381 U. S., at 482 ("This law . . . operates directly
on an intimate relation of husband and wife and their physician's role in one aspect of that relation"); see generally R.
Cabot, Ether Day Address, Boston Medical and Surgical J.
287, 288 (1920). This idea of the physician as serving the
whole person is a source of the high value traditionally
placed on the medical relationship. Its value is surely as
apparent here as in the abortion cases, for just as the decision about abortion is not directed to correcting some pathology, so the decision in which a dying patient seeks help is
not so limited. The patients here sought not only an end to
pain (which they might have had, although perhaps at the
price of stupor) but an end to their short remaining lives
with a dignity that they believed would be denied them by
powerful pain medication, as well as by their consciousness
of dependency and helplessness as they approached death.
In that period when the end is imminent, they said, the decision to end life is closest to decisions that are generally accepted as proper instances of exercising autonomy over one's
own body, instances recognized under the Constitution and
the State's own law, instances in which the help of physicians
is accepted as falling within the traditional norm.

780 WASHINGTON v. GLUCKSBERG

Souter, J., concurring in judgment
Respondents argue that the State has in fact already recognized enough evolving examples of this tradition of patient
care to demonstrate the strength of their claim. Washington, like other States, authorizes physicians to withdraw
life-sustaining medical treatment and artificially delivered
food and water from patients who request it, even though
such actions will hasten death. See Wash. Rev. Code

$$ 70.122.110, 70.122.051 (1994); see generally Notes to Uniform Rights of the Terminally Ill Act, 9B U. L. A. 168-169
(Supp. 1997) (listing state statutes). The State permits physicians to alleviate anxiety and discomfort when withdrawing
artificial life-supporting devices by administering medication
that will hasten death even further. And it generally permits physicians to administer medication to patients in terminal conditions when the primary intent is to alleviate pain,
even when the medication is so powerful as to hasten death
and the patient chooses to receive it with that understanding.

death, unless provider intends to cause death); Iowa Code Ann. $ 707A.3.1

The argument supporting respondents' position thus pro-gresses through three steps of increasing forcefulness.

First, it emphasizes the decriminalization of suicide. Reli-ance on this fact is sanctioned under the standard that looks
not only to the tradition retained, but to society's occasionalchoices to reject traditions of the legal past. See

Poe v. Ull-man, 367 U. S., at 542 (Harlan, J., dissenting). While the

common law prohibited both suicide and aiding a suicide,with the prohibition on aiding largely justified by the primary prohibition on self-inflicted death itself, see, e. g.,American Law Institute, Model Penal Code $ 210.5, Comment 1, at 92-93, and n. 7, the State's rejection of the tradi-tional treatment of the one leaves the criminality of the other
open to questioning that previously would not have been ap-propriate. The second step in the argument is to emphasize
that the State's own act of decriminalization gives a freedomof choice much like the individual's option in recognized instances of bodily autonomy. One of these, abortion, is alegal right to choose in spite of the interest a State may
legitimately invoke in discouraging the practice, just as sui-cide is now subject to choice, despite a state interest in discouraging it. The third step is to emphasize that respond-ents claim a right to assistance not on the basis of some
broad principle that would be subject to exceptions if thatcontinuing interest of the State's in discouraging suicide
were to be recognized at all. Respondents base their claimon the traditional right to medical care and counsel, subject
to the limiting conditions of informed, responsible choicewhen death is imminent, conditions that support a strong
analogy to rights of care in other situations in which medicalcounsel and assistance have been available as a matter of
course. There can be no stronger claim to a physician's as-sistance than at the time when death is imminent, a moral
judgment implied by the State's own recognition of the legit-imacy of medical procedures necessarily hastening the moment of impending death.

782 WASHINGTON v. GLUCKSBERG

Souter, J., concurring in judgment
In my judgment, the importance of the individual interesthere, as within that class of "certain interests" demanding

careful scrutiny of the State's contrary claim, see Poe, supra,at 543, cannot be gainsaid. Whether that interest might in
some circumstances, or at some time, be seen as "fundamen-tal" to the degree entitled to prevail is not, however, a conclusion that I need draw here, for I am satisfied that theState's interests described in the following section are sufficiently serious to defeat the present claim that its law isarbitrary or purposeless.

B
The State has put forward several interests to justify theWashington law as applied to physicians treating terminally

ill patients, even those competent to make responsiblechoices: protecting life generally, Brief for Petitioners 33,
discouraging suicide even if knowing and voluntary, id., at37-38, and protecting terminally ill patients from involuntary
suicide and euthanasia, both voluntary and nonvoluntary, id.,at 34-35.

It is not necessary to discuss the exact strengths of thefirst two claims of justification in the present circumstances,
for the third is dispositive for me. That third justificationis different from the first two, for it addresses specific features of respondents' claim, and it opposes that claim notwith a moral judgment contrary to respondents', but with a
recognized state interest in the protection of nonresponsibleindividuals and those who do not stand in relation either to
death or to their physicians as do the patients whom respond-ents describe. The State claims interests in protecting patients from mistakenly and involuntarily deciding to endtheir lives, and in guarding against both voluntary and involuntary euthanasia. Leaving aside any difficulties in comingto a clear concept of imminent death, mistaken decisions may
result from inadequate palliative care or a terminal progno-sis that turns out to be error; coercion and abuse may stem
from the large medical bills that family members cannot bear

Souter, J., concurring in judgment
or unreimbursed hospitals decline to shoulder. Voluntaryand involuntary euthanasia may result once doctors are authorized to prescribe lethal medication in the first instance,for they might find it pointless to distinguish between patients who administer their own fatal drugs and those who
wish not to, and their compassion for those who suffer mayobscure the distinction between those who ask for death and

those who may be unable to request it. The argument isthat a progression would occur, obscuring the line between
the ill and the dying, and between the responsible and theunduly influenced, until ultimately doctors and perhaps others would abuse a limited freedom to aid suicides by yielding
to the impulse to end another's suffering under conditions
going beyond the narrow limits the respondents propose.
The State thus argues, essentially, that respondents' claim is
not as narrow as it sounds, simply because no recognition of
the interest they assert could be limited to vindicating those
interests and affecting no others. The State says that the
claim, in practical effect, would entail consequences that the
State could, without doubt, legitimately act to prevent.

The mere assertion that the terminally sick might be pressured into suicide decisions by close friends and family members would not alone be very telling. Of course that is possible, not only because the costs of care might be more than
family members could bear but simply because they might
naturally wish to see an end of suffering for someone they
love. But one of the points of restricting any right of assistance to physicians would be to condition the right on an exercise of judgment by someone qualified to assess the patient's
responsible capacity and detect the influence of those outside
the medical relationship.

The State, however, goes further, to argue that dependence on the vigilance of physicians will not be enough.
First, the lines proposed here (particularly the requirement
of a knowing and voluntary decision by the patient) would
be more difficult to draw than the lines that have limited

784 WASHINGTON v. GLUCKSBERG

Souter, J., concurring in judgment
other recently recognized due process rights. Limiting a
State from prosecuting use of artificial contraceptives by
married couples posed no practical threat to the State's capacity to regulate contraceptives in other ways that were
assumed at the time of Poe to be legitimate; the trimester
measurements of Roe and the viability determination of
Casey were easy to make with a real degree of certainty.
But the knowing and responsible mind is harder to assess.16
Second, this difficulty could become the greater by combining with another fact within the realm of plausibility, that
physicians simply would not be assiduous to preserve the
line. They have compassion, and those who would be willing to assist in suicide at all might be the most susceptible
to the wishes of a patient, whether the patient was technically quite responsible or not. Physicians, and their hospitals, have their own financial incentives, too, in this new age
of managed care. Whether acting from compassion or under

16 While it is also more difficult to assess in cases involving limitations
on life incidental to pain medication and the disconnection of artificial life
support, there are reasons to justify a lesser concern with the punctilio of
responsibility in these instances. The purpose of requesting and giving
the medication is presumably not to cause death but to relieve the pain so
that the State's interest in preserving life is not unequivocally implicated
by the practice; and the importance of pain relief is so clear that there is
less likelihood that relieving pain would run counter to what a responsible
patient would choose, even with the consequences for life expectancy. As
for ending artificial life support, the State again may see its interest in
preserving life as weaker here than in the general case just because artificial life support preserves life when nature would not; and, because such
life support is a frequently offensive bodily intrusion, there is a lesser
reason to fear that a decision to remove it would not be the choice of one
fully responsible. Where, however, a physician writes a prescription to
equip a patient to end life, the prescription is written to serve an affirmative intent to die (even though the physician need not and probably does
not characteristically have an intent that the patient die but only that the
patient be equipped to make the decision). The patient's responsibility
and competence are therefore crucial when the physician is presented with
the request.

Souter, J., concurring in judgment
some other influence, a physician who would provide a drugfor a patient to administer might well go the further step

of administering the drug himself; so, the barrier betweenassisted suicide and euthanasia could become porous, and the
line between voluntary and involuntary euthanasia as well.17The case for the slippery slope is fairly made out here, not
because recognizing one due process right would leave acourt with no principled basis to avoid recognizing another,
but because there is a plausible case that the right claimedwould not be readily containable by reference to facts about
the mind that are matters of difficult judgment, or by gate-keepers who are subject to temptation, noble or not.

Respondents propose an answer to all this, the answer ofstate regulation with teeth. Legislation proposed in several
States, for example, would authorize physician-assisted sui-cide but require two qualified physicians to confirm the patient's diagnosis, prognosis, and competence; and would man-date that the patient make repeated requests witnessed by
at least two others over a specified timespan; and would im-pose reporting requirements and criminal penalties for various acts of coercion. See App. to Brief for State Legislatorsas

Amici Curiae 1a-2a.But at least at this moment there are reasons for caution

in predicting the effectiveness of the teeth proposed. Re-spondents' proposals, as it turns out, sound much like the
guidelines now in place in the Netherlands, the only placewhere experience with physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia has yielded empirical evidence about how such regula-tions might affect actual practice. Dutch physicians must
engage in consultation before proceeding, and must decidewhether the patient's decision is voluntary, well considered,
and stable, whether the request to die is enduring and mademore than once, and whether the patient's future will involve

17 Again, the same can be said about life support and shortening life to
kill pain, but the calculus may be viewed as different in these instances,
as noted just above.

unacceptable suffering. See C. Gomez, Regulating Death40-43 (1991). There is, however, a substantial dispute today

about what the Dutch experience shows. Some commenta-tors marshall evidence that the Dutch guidelines have in
practice failed to protect patients from involuntary euthanasia and have been violated with impunity. See, e. g., H. Hen-din, Seduced By Death 75-84 (1997) (noting many cases in

which decisions intended to end the life of a fully competentpatient were made without a request from the patient and
without consulting the patient); Keown, Euthanasia in theNetherlands: Sliding Down the Slippery Slope?, in Euthanasia Examined 261, 289 (J. Keown ed. 1995) (guidelines have
"proved signally ineffectual; non-voluntary euthanasia is now
widely practised and increasingly condoned in the Netherlands"); Gomez, supra, at 104-113. This evidence is contested. See, e. g., R. Epstein, Mortal Peril 322 (1997)
("Dutch physicians are not euthanasia enthusiasts and they
are slow to practice it in individual cases"); R. Posner, Aging
and Old Age 242, and n. 23 (1995) (noting fear of "doctors'
rushing patients to their death" in the Netherlands "has not
been substantiated and does not appear realistic"); Van der
Wal, Van Eijk, Leenen, & Spreeuwenberg, Euthanasia and
Assisted Suicide, 2, Do Dutch Family Doctors Act Prudently?, 9 Family Practice 135 (1992) (finding no serious
abuse in Dutch practice). The day may come when we can
say with some assurance which side is right, but for now
it is the substantiality of the factual disagreement, and the
alternatives for resolving it, that matter. They are, for me,
dispositive of the due process claim at this time.

I take it that the basic concept of judicial review with its
possible displacement of legislative judgment bars any finding that a legislature has acted arbitrarily when the following conditions are met: there is a serious factual controversy
over the feasibility of recognizing the claimed right without
at the same time making it impossible for the State to engage in an undoubtedly legitimate exercise of power; facts

787Cite as: 521 U. S. 702 (1997)
Souter, J., concurring in judgment
necessary to resolve the controversy are not readily ascertainable through the judicial process; but they are more
readily subject to discovery through legislative factfinding
and experimentation. It is assumed in this case, and must
be, that a State's interest in protecting those unable to make
responsible decisions and those who make no decisions at all
entitles the State to bar aid to any but a knowing and responsible person intending suicide, and to prohibit euthanasia.
How, and how far, a State should act in that interest are
judgments for the State, but the legitimacy of its action to
deny a physician the option to aid any but the knowing and
responsible is beyond question.

The capacity of the State to protect the others if respondents were to prevail is, however, subject to some genuine
question, underscored by the responsible disagreement over
the basic facts of the Dutch experience. This factual controversy is not open to a judicial resolution with any substantial
degree of assurance at this time. It is not, of course, that
any controversy about the factual predicate of a due process
claim disqualifies a court from resolving it. Courts can recognize captiousness, and most factual issues can be settled
in a trial court. At this point, however, the factual issue at
the heart of this case does not appear to be one of those.
The principal enquiry at the moment is into the Dutch experience, and I question whether an independent front-line
investigation into the facts of a foreign country's legal administration can be soundly undertaken through American
courtroom litigation. While an extensive literature on any
subject can raise the hopes for judicial understanding, the
literature on this subject is only nascent. Since there is little experience directly bearing on the issue, the most that
can be said is that whichever way the Court might rule
today, events could overtake its assumptions, as experimentation in some jurisdictions confirmed or discredited the concerns about progression from assisted suicide to euthanasia.

788 WASHINGTON v. GLUCKSBERG

Souter, J., concurring in judgment
Legislatures, on the other hand, have superior opportuni-ties to obtain the facts necessary for a judgment about the

present controversy. Not only do they have more flexiblemechanisms for factfinding than the Judiciary, but their
mechanisms include the power to experiment, moving forward and pulling back as facts emerge within their own ju-risdictions. There is, indeed, good reason to suppose that in

the absence of a judgment for respondents here, just suchexperimentation will be attempted in some of the States.
See, e. g., Ore. Rev. Stat. $ 127.800 et seq. (Supp. 1996); App.to Brief for State Legislators as

Amici Curiae 1a (listing
proposed statutes).

I do not decide here what the significance might be of legislative foot dragging in ascertaining the facts going to the
State's argument that the right in question could not be confined as claimed. Sometimes a court may be bound to act
regardless of the institutional preferability of the political
branches as forums for addressing constitutional claims.
See, e. g., Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U. S. 497 (1954). Now, it is
enough to say that our examination of legislative reasonableness should consider the fact that the Legislature of the
State of Washington is no more obviously at fault than this
Court is in being uncertain about what would happen if respondents prevailed today. We therefore have a clear question about which institution, a legislature or a court, is relatively more competent to deal with an emerging issue as to
which facts currently unknown could be dispositive. The
answer has to be, for the reasons already stated, that the
legislative process is to be preferred. There is a closely related further reason as well.

One must bear in mind that the nature of the right
claimed, if recognized as one constitutionally required, would
differ in no essential way from other constitutional rights
guaranteed by enumeration or derived from some more
definite textual source than "due process." An unenumerated right should not therefore be recognized, with the effect

of displacing the legislative ordering of things, without theassurance that its recognition would prove as durable as the

recognition of those other rights differently derived. Torecognize a right of lesser promise would simply create a
constitutional regime too uncertain to bring with it theexpectation of finality that is one of this Court's central obligations in making constitutional decisions. See Casey, 505U. S., at 864-869.

Legislatures, however, are not so constrained. The ex-perimentation that should be out of the question in constitutional adjudication displacing legislative judgments is en-tirely proper, as well as highly desirable, when the legislative
power addresses an emerging issue like assisted suicide.The Court should accordingly stay its hand to allow reasonable legislative consideration. While I do not decide for alltime that respondents' claim should not be recognized, I acknowledge the legislative institutional competence as thebetter one to deal with that claim at this time.

drawn between physician assisted suicide and withdrawal of
life support. I also agree with the Court that the critical
question in both of the cases before us is whether "the `liberty' specially protected by the Due Process Clause includes
a right" of the sort that the respondents assert. Washington v. Glucksberg, ante, at 723. I do not agree, however,
with the Court's formulation of that claimed "liberty" interest. The Court describes it as a "right to commit suicide
with another's assistance." Ante, at 724. But I would
not reject the respondents' claim without considering a different formulation, for which our legal tradition may provide greater support. That formulation would use words
roughly like a "right to die with dignity." But irrespective
of the exact words used, at its core would lie personal control
over the manner of death, professional medical assistance,
and the avoidance of unnecessary and severe physical suffering--combined.

As Justice Souter points out, ante, at 762-765 (opinion
concurring in judgment), Justice Harlan's dissenting opinion
in Poe v. Ullman, 367 U. S. 497 (1961), offers some support
for such a claim. In that opinion, Justice Harlan referred to
the "liberty" that the Fourteenth Amendment protects as
including "a freedom from all substantial arbitrary impositions and purposeless restraints" and also as recognizing that
"certain interests require particularly careful scrutiny of the
state needs asserted to justify their abridgment." Id., at
543. The "certain interests" to which Justice Harlan referred may well be similar (perhaps identical) to the rights,
liberties, or interests that the Court today, as in the past,
regards as "fundamental." Ante, at 720; see also Planned
Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833
(1992); Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U. S. 438 (1972); Griswold v.

Breyer, J., concurring in judgments
Justice Harlan concluded that marital privacy was such a
"special interest." He found in the Constitution a right of
"privacy of the home"--with the home, the bedroom, and "intimate details of the marital relation" at its heart--by examining the protection that the law had earlier provided for
related, but not identical, interests described by such words
as "privacy," "home," and "family." 367 U. S., at 548, 552;
cf. Casey, supra, at 851. The respondents here essentially
ask us to do the same. They argue that one can find a "right
to die with dignity" by examining the protection the law has
provided for related, but not identical, interests relating to
personal dignity, medical treatment, and freedom from
state-inflicted pain. See Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U. S. 651
(1977); Cruzan v. Director, Mo. Dept. of Health, 497 U. S. 261
(1990); Casey, supra.

I do not believe, however, that this Court need or now
should decide whether or a not such a right is "fundamental."
That is because, in my view, the avoidance of severe physical
pain (connected with death) would have to constitute an essential part of any successful claim and because, as Justice
O'Connor points out, the laws before us do not force a dying
person to undergo that kind of pain. Ante, at 736-737 (concurring opinion). Rather, the laws of New York and of
Washington do not prohibit doctors from providing patients
with drugs sufficient to control pain despite the risk that
those drugs themselves will kill. Cf. New York State Task
Force on Life and the Law, When Death Is Sought: Assisted
Suicide and Euthanasia in the Medical Context 163, n. 29
(May 1994). And under these circumstances the laws of
New York and Washington would overcome any remaining
significant interests and would be justified, regardless.

Medical technology, we are repeatedly told, makes the administration of pain-relieving drugs sufficient, except for a
very few individuals for whom the ineffectiveness of pain
control medicines can mean not pain, but the need for seda521US2 Unit: $U90 [11-23-99 18:50:39] PAGES PGT: OPFX

Report of Select Committee on Medical Ethics 113 (1994)(indicating that the number of palliative care centers in the
United Kingdom, where physician assisted suicide is illegal,significantly exceeds that in the Netherlands, where such
practices are legal).This legal circumstance means that the state laws before
us do not infringe directly upon the (assumed) central inter-est (what I have called the core of the interest in dying with
dignity) as, by way of contrast, the state anticontraceptivelaws at issue in

Poe did interfere with the central interestthere at stake--by bringing the State's police powers to bear

upon the marital bedroom.Were the legal circumstances different--for example, were
state law to prevent the provision of palliative care, includ-ing the administration of drugs as needed to avoid pain at
the end of life--then the law's impact upon serious and other-wise unavoidable physical pain (accompanying death) would
be more directly at issue. And as Justice O'Connor sug-gests, the Court might have to revisit its conclusions in
these cases.

VACCO, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF NEW YORK,

et al. v. QUILL et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe second circuit

No. 95-1858. Argued January 8, 1997--Decided June 26, 1997
In New York, as in most States, it is a crime to aid another to commit or

attempt suicide, but patients may refuse even lifesaving medical treatment. Respondent New York physicians assert that, although it would
be consistent with the standards of their medical practices to prescribe
lethal medication for mentally competent, terminally ill patients who
are suffering great pain and desire a doctor's help in taking their own
lives, they are deterred from doing so by New York's assisted-suicide
ban. They, and three gravely ill patients who have since died, sued the
State's Attorney General, claiming that the ban violates the Fourteenth
Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. The Federal District Court
disagreed, but the Second Circuit reversed, holding (1) that New York
accords different treatment to those competent, terminally ill persons
who wish to hasten their deaths by self-administering prescribed drugs
than it does to those who wish to do so by directing the removal of
life-support systems, and (2) that this supposed unequal treatment is
not rationally related to any legitimate state interests.

Held: New York's prohibition on assisting suicide does not violate the

Equal Protection Clause. Pp. 799-809.

(a) The Equal Protection Clause embodies a general rule that States
must treat like cases alike but may treat unlike cases accordingly. E. g.,
Plyler v. Doe, 457 U. S. 202, 216. The New York statutes outlawing
assisted suicide neither infringe fundamental rights nor involve suspect
classifications, e. g., Washington v. Glucksberg, ante, at 719-728, and are
therefore entitled to a strong presumption of validity, Heller v. Doe, 509
U. S. 312, 319. On their faces, neither the assisted-suicide ban nor the
law permitting patients to refuse medical treatment treats anyone differently from anyone else or draws any distinctions between persons.
Everyone, regardless of physical condition, is entitled, if competent, to
refuse unwanted lifesaving medical treatment; no one is permitted to
assist a suicide. Generally, laws that apply evenhandedly to all unquestionably comply with equal protection. E. g., New York City Transit
Authority v. Beazer, 440 U. S. 568, 587. This Court disagrees with the
Second Circuit's submission that ending or refusing lifesaving medical
treatment "is nothing more nor less than assisted suicide." The distinc521US2 Unit: $U91 [11-23-99 18:56:47] PAGES PGT: OPFX

tion between letting a patient die and making that patient die is important, logical, rational, and well established: It comports with fundamental legal principles of causation, see, e. g., People v. Kevorkian, 447 Mich.

Dept. of Health, 497 U. S. 261, 278-280; id., at 287-288 (O'Connor, J.,
concurring); and has been widely recognized and endorsed in the medical profession, the state courts, and the overwhelming majority of state
legislatures, which, like New York's, have permitted the former while
prohibiting the latter. The Court therefore disagrees with respondents' claim that the distinction is "arbitrary" and "irrational." The line
between the two acts may not always be clear, but certainty is not
required, even were it possible. Logic and contemporary practice support New York's judgment that the two acts are different, and New
York may therefore, consistent with the Constitution, treat them differently. Pp. 799-808.

(b) New York's reasons for recognizing and acting on the distinction
between refusing treatment and assisting a suicide--including prohibiting intentional killing and preserving life; preventing suicide; maintaining physicians' role as their patients' healers; protecting vulnerable people from indifference, prejudice, and psychological and financial pressure
to end their lives; and avoiding a possible slide toward euthanasia--are
valid and important public interests that easily satisfy the constitutional
requirement that a legislative classification bear a rational relation to
some legitimate end. See Glucksberg, ante. Pp. 808-809.

Opinion of the Court
lifesaving medical treatment.2 The question presented bythis case is whether New York's prohibition on assisting suicide therefore violates the Equal Protection Clause of theFourteenth Amendment. We hold that it does not.

Petitioners are various New York public officials. Re-spondents Timothy E. Quill, Samuel C. Klagsbrun, and Howard A. Grossman are physicians who practice in New York.They assert that although it would be "consistent with the
standards of [their] medical practice[s]" to prescribe lethalmedication for "mentally competent, terminally ill patients"
who are suffering great pain and desire a doctor's help intaking their own lives, they are deterred from doing so by
New York's ban on assisting suicide. App. 25-26.3 Re-spondents, and three gravely ill patients who have since
died,4 sued the State's Attorney General in the United States

1 New York Penal Law $ 125.15 (McKinney 1987) ("Manslaughter in the

second degree") provides: "A person is guilty of manslaughter in the second degree when . . . (3) He intentionally causes or aids another person to
commit suicide. Manslaughter in the second degree is a class C felony."
Section 120.30 ("Promoting a suicide attempt") states: "A person is guilty
of promoting a suicide attempt when he intentionally causes or aids another person to attempt suicide. Promoting a suicide attempt is a class
E felony." See generally Washington v. Glucksberg, ante, at 710-719.

Opinion of the Court
District Court. They urged that because New York permitsa competent person to refuse life-sustaining medical treatment, and because the refusal of such treatment is "essen-tially the same thing" as physician-assisted suicide, New
York's assisted-suicide ban violates the Equal ProtectionClause.

Quill v. Koppell, 870 F. Supp. 78, 84-85 (SDNY1994).

The District Court disagreed: "[I]t is hardly unreasonableor irrational for the State to recognize a difference between
allowing nature to take its course, even in the most severesituations, and intentionally using an artificial deathproducing device." Id., at 84. The court noted New York's"obvious legitimate interests in preserving life, and in protecting vulnerable persons," and concluded that "[u]nder theUnited States Constitution and the federal system it establishes, the resolution of this issue is left to the normal demo-cratic processes within the State."

Id., at 84-85.The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed. 80

F. 3d 716 (1996). The court determined that, despite theassisted-suicide ban's apparent general applicability, "New
York law does not treat equally all competent persons whoare in the final stages of fatal illness and wish to hasten their
deaths," because "those in the final stages of terminal illnesswho are on life-support systems are allowed to hasten their
deaths by directing the removal of such systems; but thosewho are similarly situated, except for the previous attachment of life-sustaining equipment, are not allowed to hastendeath by self-administering prescribed drugs." Id., at 727,
729. In the court's view, "[t]he ending of life by [the with-drawal of life-support systems] is nothing more nor less than
assisted suicide." Id., at 729 (emphasis added). The Courtof Appeals then examined whether this supposed unequal
treatment was rationally related to any legitimate state
their lives. App. 25-26; Declaration of William A. Barth, id., at 96-98;

interests,5 and concluded that "to the extent that [NewYork's statutes] prohibit a physician from prescribing medications to be self-administered by a mentally competent,terminally-ill person in the final stages of his terminal illness, they are not rationally related to any legitimate stateinterest."

Id., at 731. We granted certiorari, 518 U. S. 1055(1996), and now reverse.

The Equal Protection Clause commands that no State shall"deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." This provision creates no substantiverights. San Antonio Independent School Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 1, 33 (1973); id., at 59 (Stewart, J., concurring).Instead, it embodies a general rule that States must treat
like cases alike but may treat unlike cases accordingly.
Plyler v. Doe, 457 U. S. 202, 216 (1982) (" `[T]he Constitutiondoes not require things which are different in fact or opinion

to be treated in law as though they were the same' ") (quot-ing Tigner v. Texas, 310 U. S. 141, 147 (1940)). If a legislative classification or distinction "neither burdens a funda-mental right nor targets a suspect class, we will uphold [it]
so long as it bears a rational relation to some legitimate end."
Romer v. Evans, 517 U. S. 620, 631 (1996).New York's statutes outlawing assisting suicide affect and

address matters of profound significance to all New Yorkersalike. They neither infringe fundamental rights nor involve
suspect classifications. Washington v. Glucksberg, ante, at719-728; see 80 F. 3d, at 726;

are therefore entitled to a "strong presumption of validity."Heller v. Doe, 509 U. S. 312, 319 (1993).

On their faces, neither New York's ban on assisting suicidenor its statutes permitting patients to refuse medical treatment treat anyone differently from anyone else or drawany distinctions between persons.

Everyone, regardless ofphysical condition, is entitled, if competent, to refuse unwanted lifesaving medical treatment; no one is permitted toassist a suicide. Generally speaking, laws that apply evenhandedly to all "unquestionably comply" with the Equal Pro-tection Clause. New York City Transit Authority v.
Beazer, 440 U. S. 568, 587 (1979); see Personnel Administrator of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U. S. 256, 271-273 (1979) ("[M]any[laws] affect certain groups unevenly, even though the law

itself treats them no differently from all other members ofthe class described by the law").

The Court of Appeals, however, concluded that some ter-minally ill people--those who are on life-support systems--
are treated differently from those who are not, in that theformer may "hasten death" by ending treatment, but the latter may not "hasten death" through physician-assisted sui-cide. 80 F. 3d, at 729. This conclusion depends on the submission that ending or refusing lifesaving medical treatment"is nothing more nor less than assisted suicide."

Ibid. Un-like the Court of Appeals, we think the distinction between

assisting suicide and withdrawing life-sustaining treatment,a distinction widely recognized and endorsed in the medical
profession 6 and in our legal traditions, is both important and

6 The American Medical Association emphasizes the "fundamental difference between refusing life-sustaining treatment and demanding a lifeending treatment." American Medical Association, Council on Ethical
and Judicial Affairs, Physician-Assisted Suicide, 10 Issues in Law & Medicine 91, 93 (1994); see also American Medical Association, Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs, Decisions Near the End of Life, 267 JAMA 2229,

treatment is not inherently contrary to the principles of beneficence and

logical; it is certainly rational. See Feeney, supra, at 272("When the basic classification is rationally based, uneven

effects upon particular groups within a class are ordinarilyof no constitutional concern").

The distinction comports with fundamental legal principlesof causation and intent. First, when a patient refuses lifesustaining medical treatment, he dies from an underlyingfatal disease or pathology; but if a patient ingests lethal medication prescribed by a physician, he is killed by that medica-tion. See,

e. g., People v. Kevorkian, 447 Mich. 436, 470-472,527 N. W. 2d 714, 728 (1994), cert. denied, 514 U. S. 1083

dies primarily because of an underlying disease").Furthermore, a physician who withdraws, or honors a patient's refusal to begin, life-sustaining medical treatmentpurposefully intends, or may so intend, only to respect his
patient's wishes and "to cease doing useless and futile or de-grading things to the patient when [the patient] no longer

802 VACCO v. QUILL

Opinion of the Court
United States, Hearing before the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 104th
Cong., 2d Sess., 368 (1996) (testimony of Dr. Leon R. Kass).
The same is true when a doctor provides aggressive palliative care; in some cases, painkilling drugs may hasten a patient's death, but the physician's purpose and intent is, or
may be, only to ease his patient's pain. A doctor who assists
a suicide, however, "must, necessarily and indubitably, intend
primarily that the patient be made dead." Id., at 367. Similarly, a patient who commits suicide with a doctor's aid necessarily has the specific intent to end his or her own life,
while a patient who refuses or discontinues treatment might
not. See, e. g., Matter of Conroy, supra, at 351, 486 A. 2d,
at 1224 (patients who refuse life-sustaining treatment "may
not harbor a specific intent to die" and may instead "fervently wish to live, but to do so free of unwanted medical
technology, surgery, or drugs"); Superintendent of Belchertown State School v. Saikewicz, 373 Mass. 728, 743, n. 11, 370
N. E. 2d 417, 426, n. 11 (1977) ("[I]n refusing treatment the
patient may not have the specific intent to die").

The law has long used actors' intent or purpose to distinguish between two acts that may have the same result. See,
e. g., United States v. Bailey, 444 U. S. 394, 403-406 (1980)
("[T]he . . . common law of homicide often distinguishes . . .
between a person who knows that another person will be
killed as the result of his conduct and a person who acts with
the specific purpose of taking another's life"); Morissette v.
United States, 342 U. S. 246, 250 (1952) (distinctions based on
intent are "universal and persistent in mature systems of
law"); M. Hale, 1 Pleas of the Crown 412 (1847) ("If A. with
an intent to prevent a gangrene beginning in his hand doth
without any advice cut off his hand, by which he dies, he is
not thereby felo de se for tho it was a voluntary act, yet it
was not with an intent to kill himself "). Put differently, the
law distinguishes actions taken "because of " a given end

803Cite as: 521 U. S. 793 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
from actions taken "in spite of " their unintended but fore-seen consequences. Feeney, 442 U. S., at 279; Compassion

in Dying v. Washington, 79 F. 3d 790, 858 (CA9 1996) (Klein-feld, J., dissenting) ("When General Eisenhower ordered
American soldiers onto the beaches of Normandy, he knew
that he was sending many American soldiers to certain death. . . . His purpose, though, was to . . . liberate Europe from

the Nazis").Given these general principles, it is not surprising that
many courts, including New York courts, have carefully dis-tinguished refusing life-sustaining treatment from suicide.
See, e. g., Fosmire v. Nicoleau, 75 N. Y. 2d 218, 227, and n. 2,551 N. E. 2d 77, 82, and n. 2 (1990) ("[M]erely declining medical care . . . is not considered a suicidal act").7 In fact, thefirst state-court decision explicitly to authorize withdrawing lifesaving treatment noted the "real distinction betweenthe self-infliction of deadly harm and a self-determination
against artificial life support." In re Quinlan, 70 N. J. 10,
43, 52, and n. 9, 355 A. 2d 647, 665, 670, and n. 9, cert. denied
sub nom. Garger v. New Jersey, 429 U. S. 922 (1976). And
recently, the Michigan Supreme Court also rejected the ar-gument that the distinction "between acts that artificially

sustain life and acts that artificially curtail life" is merely a"distinction without constitutional significance--a meaning7 Thus, the Second Circuit erred in reading New York law as creating a
"right to hasten death"; instead, the authorities cited by the court recognize a right to refuse treatment, and nowhere equate the exercise of this
right with suicide. Schloendorff v. Society of New York Hospital, 211
N. Y. 125, 129-130, 105 N. E. 92, 93 (1914), which contains Justice Cardozo's
famous statement that "[e]very human being of adult years and sound
mind has a right to determine what shall be done with his own body," was
simply an informed-consent case. See also Rivers v. Katz, 67 N. Y. 2d 485,
495, 495 N. E. 2d 337, 343 (1986) (right to refuse antipsychotic medication is
not absolute, and may be limited when "the patient presents a danger to
himself"); Matter of Storar, 52 N. Y. 2d 363, 377, n. 6, 420 N. E. 2d 64, 71,

806 VACCO v. QUILL

Opinion of the Court
States move to protect and promote patients' dignity at theend of life, they remain opposed to physician-assisted suicide.

New York is a case in point. The State enacted its cur-rent assisted-suicide statutes in 1965.

10 Since then, New

York has acted several times to protect patients' common-law right to refuse treatment. Act of Aug. 7, 1987, ch. 818,

$ 1, 1987 N. Y. Laws 3140 ("Do Not Resuscitate Orders")
(codified as amended at N. Y. Pub. Health Law $$ 2960-2979(McKinney 1993 and Supp. 1997)); Act of July 22, 1990, ch.

752, $ 2, 1990 N. Y. Laws 3547 ("Health Care Agents andProxies") (codified as amended at N. Y. Pub. Health Law

$$ 2980-2994 (McKinney 1993 and Supp. 1997)). In so doing,however, the State has neither endorsed a general right to
"hasten death" nor approved physician-assisted suicide.Quite the opposite: The State has reaffirmed the line between "killing" and "letting die." See N. Y. Pub. Health
Law $ 2989(3) (McKinney 1993) ("This article is not intended
to permit or promote suicide, assisted suicide, or euthanasia"); New York State Task Force on Life and the Law, LifeSustaining Treatment: Making Decisions and Appointing a

law, to assist a suicide in New York. See Marzen, O'Dowd, Crone, &
Balch, Suicide: A Constitutional Right?, 24 Duquesne L. Rev. 1, 205-210

Opinion of the Court
the Law studied assisted suicide and euthanasia and, in 1994,unanimously recommended against legalization. When

Death is Sought: Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia in theMedical Context vii (1994). In the Task Force's view,
"allowing decisions to forgo life-sustaining treatment andallowing assisted suicide or euthanasia have radically different consequences and meanings for public policy." Id., at146.

This Court has also recognized, at least implicitly, the dis-tinction between letting a patient die and making that patient die. In Cruzan v. Director, Mo. Dept. of Health, 497U. S. 261, 278 (1990), we concluded that "[t]he principle that
a competent person has a constitutionally protected libertyinterest in refusing unwanted medical treatment may be inferred from our prior decisions," and we assumed the exist-ence of such a right for purposes of that case, id., at 279.
But our assumption of a right to refuse treatment wasgrounded not, as the Court of Appeals supposed, on the proposition that patients have a general and abstract "right tohasten death," 80 F. 3d, at 727-728, but on well-established,
traditional rights to bodily integrity and freedom from un-wanted touching,

Cruzan, 497 U. S., at 278-279; id., at 287-288 (
O'Connor, J., concurring). In fact, we observed that"the majority of States in this country have laws imposing

criminal penalties on one who assists another to commit sui-cide."

Id., at 280. Cruzan therefore provides no supportfor the notion that refusing life-sustaining medical treatment

is "nothing more nor less than suicide."For all these reasons, we disagree with respondents' claim
that the distinction between refusing lifesaving medicaltreatment and assisted suicide is "arbitrary" and "irrational." Brief for Respondents 44.11 Granted, in some cases,

11 Respondents also argue that the State irrationally distinguishes between physician-assisted suicide and "terminal sedation," a process respondents characterize as "induc[ing] barbiturate coma and then starv[ing] the person to death." Brief for Respondents 48-50; see 80 F. 3d,

521US2 Unit: $U91 [11-23-99 18:56:47] PAGES PGT: OPFX
808 VACCO v. QUILL

Opinion of the Court
the line between the two may not be clear, but certainty is
not required, even were it possible.12 Logic and contemporary practice support New York's judgment that the two acts
are different, and New York may therefore, consistent with
the Constitution, treat them differently. By permitting everyone to refuse unwanted medical treatment while prohibiting anyone from assisting a suicide, New York law follows a
longstanding and rational distinction.

New York's reasons for recognizing and acting on this distinction--including prohibiting intentional killing and preserving life; preventing suicide; maintaining physicians' role
as their patients' healers; protecting vulnerable people from

at 729. Petitioners insist, however, that " `[a]lthough proponents of
physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia contend that terminal sedation
is covert physician-assisted suicide or euthanasia, the concept of sedating
pharmacotherapy is based on informed consent and the principle of double
effect.' " Reply Brief for Petitioners 12 (quoting P. Rousseau, Terminal
Sedation in the Care of Dying Patients, 156 Archives Internal Med. 1785,
1785-1786 (1996)). Just as a State may prohibit assisting suicide while
permitting patients to refuse unwanted lifesaving treatment, it may permit palliative care related to that refusal, which may have the foreseen
but unintended "double effect" of hastening the patient's death. See New
York Task Force, When Death is Sought, supra n. 6, at 163 ("It is widely
recognized that the provision of pain medication is ethically and professionally acceptable even when the treatment may hasten the patient's
death, if the medication is intended to alleviate pain and severe discomfort,
not to cause death").

12 We do not insist, as Justice Stevens suggests, ante, at 750 (opinion

concurring in judgments), that "in all cases there will in fact be a significant
difference between the intent of the physicians, the patients, or the families [in withdrawal-of-treatment and physician-assisted-suicide cases]."
See supra, at 801-802 ("[A] physician who withdraws, or honors a patient's
refusal to begin, life-sustaining medical treatment purposefully intends,
or may so intend, only to respect his patient's wishes . . . . The same is
true when a doctor provides aggressive palliative care; . . . the physician's
purpose and intent is, or may be, only to ease his patient's pain" (emphasis
added)). In the absence of omniscience, however, the State is entitled to
act on the reasonableness of the distinction.

Souter, J., concurring in judgment
indifference, prejudice, and psychological and financial pres-sure to end their lives; and avoiding a possible slide towards

euthanasia--are discussed in greater detail in our opinion inGlucksberg, ante. These valid and important public interests easily satisfy the constitutional requirement that a legis-lative classification bear a rational relation to some legitimate end.13The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.

It is so ordered.
[For concurring opinion of Justice O'Connor, see ante,p. 736; for opinions concurring in the judgments of

Justice
Stevens, see ante, p. 738, Justice Ginsburg, see ante,p. 789, and

Justice Breyer, see ante, p. 789.]

Justice Souter, concurring in the judgment.
Even though I do not conclude that assisted suicide isa fundamental right entitled to recognition at this time, I

accord the claims raised by the patients and physicians inthis case and

Washington v. Glucksberg a high degree ofimportance, requiring a commensurate justification. See

Washington v. Glucksberg, ante, at 782 (Souter, J., concur-ring in judgment). The reasons that lead me to conclude in
Glucksberg that the prohibition on assisted suicide is not ar-bitrary under the due process standard also support the distinction between assistance to suicide, which is banned, and

13 Justice Stevens observes that our holding today "does not foreclose
the possibility that some applications of the New York statute may impose
an intolerable intrusion on the patient's freedom." Ante, at 751-752 (opinion concurring in judgments). This is true, but, as we observe in Glucksberg, ante, at 735, n. 24, a particular plaintiff hoping to show that New
York's assisted-suicide ban was unconstitutional in his particular case
would need to present different and considerably stronger arguments than
those advanced by respondents here.

RAINES, DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF MANAGEMENTAND BUDGET,

et al. v. BYRD et al.

appeal from the united states district court for thedistrict of columbia

No. 96-1671. Argued May 27, 1997--Decided June 26, 1997
Appellees, Members of the 104th Congress, voted "nay" when Congress

passed the Line Item Veto Act (Act), which gives the President the
authority to cancel certain spending and tax benefit measures after he
has signed them into law. The day after the Act went into effect, they
filed suit against appellants, Executive Branch officials, challenging the
Act's constitutionality. The District Court denied appellants' motion to
dismiss, finding that appellees' claim that the Act diluted their Article I
voting power was sufficient to confer Article III standing; and that their
claim was ripe, even though the President had not yet used the Act's
cancellation authority, because they found themselves in a position of
unanticipated and unwelcome subservience to the President before and
after their votes on appropriations bills. The court then granted appellees summary judgment, holding that the Act violated the Presentment
Clause, Art. I, $ 7, cl. 2, and constituted an unconstitutional delegation
of legislative power to the President.

Held: Appellees lack standing to bring this suit. Pp. 818-830.

(a) The federal courts have jurisdiction over this dispute only if it is
a case or controversy. Art. III, $ 2. In order to meet the standing
element of the case-or-controversy requirement, appellees must allege a
personal injury that is particularized, concrete, and otherwise judicially
cognizable. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 561; Allen
v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737, 751. This Court insists on strict compliance

with the jurisdictional standing requirement, see, e. g., id., at 752,
and its standing inquiry is especially rigorous when reaching the merits
of a dispute would force it to decide the constitutionality of an action
taken by one of the other two branches of the Federal Government.
Pp. 818-820.

(b) This Court has never had occasion to rule on the legislative standing question presented here. Appellees are not helped by Powell v.
McCormack, 395 U. S. 486, 496, 512-514, in which the Court held that a
Congressman's challenge to the constitutionality of his exclusion from
the House of Representatives presented an Article III case or controversy. Appellees have not been singled out for specially unfavorable
treatment as opposed to other Members of their respective bodies, but

521US2 Unit: $U92 [11-23-99 19:02:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Syllabus
claim that the Act causes a type of institutional injury which damages
all Members of Congress equally. And their claim is based on a loss of
political power, not loss of something to which they are personally entitled, such as their seats as Members of Congress after their constituents
elected them. Pp. 820-821.

(c) Appellees' claim also does not fall within the Court's holding in
Coleman v. Miller, 307 U. S. 433, the one case in which standing has
been upheld for legislators claiming an institutional injury. There, the
Court held that state legislators who had been locked in a tie vote that
would have defeated the State's ratification of a proposed federal constitutional amendment, and who alleged that their votes were nullified
when the Lieutenant Governor broke the tie by casting his vote for
ratification, had "a plain, direct and adequate interest in maintaining
the effectiveness of their votes." Id., at 438. In contrast, appellees
have not alleged that they voted for a specific bill, that there were sufficient votes to pass the bill, and that the bill was nonetheless deemed
defeated. In the vote on the Act, their votes were given full effect;
they simply lost that vote. To uphold standing here would require a
drastic extension of Coleman, even accepting appellees' argument that
the Act has changed the "meaning" and "effectiveness" of their vote on
appropriations bills, for there is a vast difference between the level of
vote nullification at issue in Coleman and the abstract dilution of institutional power appellees allege. Pp. 821-826.

(d) Historical practice cuts against appellees' position as well. Several episodes in our history show that in analogous confrontations between one or both Houses of Congress and the Executive Branch, no
suit was brought on the basis of claimed injury to official authority or
power. If appellees' claim were sustained, presumably several Presidents would have had standing to challenge the Tenure of Office Act,
which prevented the removal of a Presidential appointee without Congress' consent; the Attorney General could have challenged the oneHouse veto provision because it rendered his authority provisional
rather than final; President Ford could have challenged the Federal
Election Campaign Act's appointment provisions which were struck
down in Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1; and a Member of Congress could
have challenged the validity of President Coolidge's pocket veto that
was sustained in The Pocket Veto Case, 279 U. S. 655. While a system
granting such standing would not be irrational, our Constitution's regime contemplates a more restrictive role for Article III courts. See
United States v. Richardson, 418 U. S. 166, 192 (Powell, J., concurring).
Pp. 826-829.

(e) Some importance must be attached to the fact that appellees have
not been authorized to represent their respective Houses in this action,

Opinion of the Court
and indeed both Houses actively oppose their suit. In addition, the conclusion reached here neither deprives Members of Congress of an adequate remedy--since they may repeal the Act or exempt appropriations
bills from its reach--nor forecloses the Act from constitutional challenge
by someone who suffers judicially cognizable injury resulting from it.

The appellees are six Members of Congress, four of whomserved as Senators and two of whom served as Congressmen

vote of 69 to 31. All four appellee Senators voted "nay."142 Cong. Rec. S2995. The next day, the House of Representatives passed the identical bill by a vote of 232 to 177.Both appellee Congressmen voted "nay."

Id., at H2986.On April 4, 1996, the President signed the Line Item Veto

Act (Act) into law. Pub. L. 104-130, 110 Stat. 1200, codifiedat 2 U. S. C. $ 691

et seq. (1994 ed., Supp. II). The Act wentinto effect on January 1, 1997. See Pub. L. 104-130, $ 5.

The next day, appellees filed a complaint in the DistrictCourt for the District of Columbia against the two appellants, the Secretary of the Treasury and the Director of theOffice of Management and Budget, alleging that the Act
was unconstitutional.The provisions of the Act do not use the term "veto." Instead, the President is given the authority to "cancel" certainspending and tax benefit measures after he has signed them
into law. Specifically, the Act provides:

"[T]he President may, with respect to any bill or jointresolution that has been signed into law pursuant to

Article I, section 7, of the Constitution of the UnitedStates, cancel in whole--(1) any dollar amount of discretionary budget authority; (2) any item of new di-rect spending; or (3) any limited tax benefit; if the
President--
1 Three of the Senators--Robert Byrd, Carl Levin, and Daniel Patrick
Moynihan--are still Senators. The fourth--Mark Hatfield--retired at the
end of the 104th Congress. The two Congressmen--David Skaggs and
Henry Waxman--remain Congressmen.

The President's "cancellation" under the Act takes effectwhen the "special message" notifying Congress of the cancellation is received in the House and Senate. With respect todollar amounts of "discretionary budget authority," a cancellation means "to rescind." $ 691e(4)(A). With respect to"new direct spending" items or "limited tax benefit[s]," a
cancellation means that the relevant legal provision, legal ob-ligation, or budget authority is "prevent[ed] . . . from having

for the consideration of "disapproval bills," $ 691d, bills orjoint resolutions which, if enacted into law by the familiar

the ground that any provision of this part violates the Con-stitution." $ 692(a)(1). Appellees brought suit under this

provision, claiming that "[t]he Act violates Article I" of theConstitution. Complaint || 17. Specifically, they alleged
that the Act "unconstitutionally expands the President's
power," and "violates the requirements of bicameral passageand presentment by granting to the President, acting alone,

the authority to `cancel' and thus repeal provisions of federallaw."

Ibid. They alleged that the Act injured them "directly and concretely . . . in their official capacities" in threeways:

"The Act . . . (a) alter[s] the legal and practical effect ofall votes they may cast on bills containing such separately vetoable items, (b) divest[s] the [appellees] of theirconstitutional role in the repeal of legislation, and (c)
alter[s] the constitutional balance of powers between theLegislative and Executive Branches, both with respect
to measures containing separately vetoable items and
with respect to other matters coming before Congress."
Id., || 14.

Appellants moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, claiming (among other things) that appellees lacked standing tosue and that their claim was not ripe. Both sides also filed

motions for summary judgment on the merits. On April 10,
1997, the District Court (i) denied appellants' motion to dis-miss, holding that appellees had standing to bring this suit

and that their claim was ripe, and (ii) granted appellees' sum-mary judgment motion, holding that the Act is unconstitutional. 956 F. Supp. 25. As to standing, the court noted
that the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia "has
repeatedly recognized Members' standing to challenge measures that affect their constitutionally prescribed lawmaking
powers." Id., at 30 (citing, e. g., Michel v. Anderson, 14 F. 3d

Opinion of the Court
F. Supp., at 31 ("[T]he Supreme Court has never endorsedthe [Court of Appeals'] analysis of standing in such cases").

The court held that appellees' claim that the Act "dilute[d]their Article I voting power" was sufficient to confer Article
III standing: "[Appellees'] votes mean something different
from what they meant before, for good or ill, and [appellees]who perceive it as the latter are thus `injured' in a constitutional sense whenever an appropriations bill comes up for avote, whatever the President ultimately does with it. . . .
Under the Act the dynamic of lawmaking is fundamentallyaltered. Compromises and trade-offs by individual lawmakers must take into account the President's item-by-item cancellation power looming over the end product." Ibid.

The court held that appellees' claim was ripe even though
the President had not yet used the "cancellation" authority
granted him under the Act: "Because [appellees] now find
themselves in a position of unanticipated and unwelcome subservience to the President before and after they vote on appropriations bills, Article III is satisfied, and this Court may
accede to Congress' directive to address the constitutional
cloud over the Act as swiftly as possible." Id., at 32 (referring to $ 692(a)(1), the section of the Act granting Members
of Congress the right to challenge the Act's constitutionality
in court). On the merits, the court held that the Act violated the Presentment Clause, Art. I, $ 7, cl. 2, and constituted an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to
the President. 956 F. Supp., at 33, 35, 37-38.

The Act provides for a direct, expedited appeal to this
Court. $ 692(b) (direct appeal to Supreme Court); $ 692(c)
("It shall be the duty of . . . the Supreme Court of the United
States to advance on the docket and to expedite to the greatest possible extent the disposition of any [suit challenging
the Act's constitutionality] brought under [$ 3(a) of the Act]").
On April 18, eight days after the District Court issued its
order, appellants filed a jurisdictional statement asking us to
note probable jurisdiction, and on April 21, appellees filed a

memorandum in response agreeing that we should note prob-able jurisdiction. On April 23, we did so. 520 U. S. 1194

(1997). We established an expedited briefing schedule andheard oral argument on May 27.

2 We now hold that appellees have no standing to bring this suit, and therefore directthat the judgment of the District Court be vacated and the

complaint dismissed. II

Under Article III, $ 2, of the Constitution, the federalcourts have jurisdiction over this dispute between appellants
and appellees only if it is a "case" or "controversy." This isa "bedrock requirement."

Valley Forge Christian Collegev. Americans United for Separation of Church and State,

Inc., 454 U. S. 464, 471 (1982). As we said in Simon v. East-ern Ky. Welfare Rights Organization, 426 U. S. 26, 37 (1976):
"No principle is more fundamental to the judiciary's properrole in our system of government than the constitutional

limitation of federal-court jurisdiction to actual cases orcontroversies."

One element of the case-or-controversy requirement isthat appellees, based on their complaint, must establish that
they have standing to sue. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,504 U. S. 555, 561 (1992) (plaintiff bears burden of establishing standing). The standing inquiry focuses on whether theplaintiff is the proper party to bring this suit, Simon, supra,
at 38, although that inquiry "often turns on the nature andsource of the claim asserted," Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490,
500 (1975). To meet the standing requirements of ArticleIII, "[a] plaintiff must allege personal injury fairly traceable
to the defendant's allegedly unlawful conduct and likely tobe redressed by the requested relief."

Allen v. Wright, 468

2 The House Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group (made up of the Speaker,
the Majority Leader, the Minority Leader, and the two Whips) and the
Senate filed a joint brief as amici curiae urging that the District Court
be reversed on the merits. Their brief states that they express no position as to appellees' standing.

Opinion of the Court
U. S. 737, 751 (1984) (emphasis added). For our purposes,the italicized words in this quotation from

Allen are the key
ones. We have consistently stressed that a plaintiff 's com-plaint must establish that he has a "personal stake" in the

alleged dispute, and that the alleged injury suffered is particularized as to him. See, e. g., Lujan, supra, at 560-561, andn. 1 (to have standing, the plaintiff must have suffered a

"particularized" injury, which means that "the injury mustaffect the plaintiff in a personal and individual way");

Bender
v. Williamsport Area School Dist., 475 U. S. 534, 543-544(1986) (school board member who "has no personal stake in

the outcome of the litigation" has no standing); Simon,
supra, at 39 ("The necessity that the plaintiff who seeks to
invoke judicial power stand to profit in some personal interest remains an Art. III requirement").

We have also stressed that the alleged injury must be legally and judicially cognizable. This requires, among other
things, that the plaintiff have suffered "an invasion of a legally protected interest which is . . . concrete and particularized," Lujan, supra, at 560, and that the dispute is "traditionally thought to be capable of resolution through the
judicial process," Flast v. Cohen, 392 U. S. 83, 97 (1968). See
also Allen, 468 U. S., at 752 ("Is the injury too abstract,
or otherwise not appropriate, to be considered judicially
cognizable?").

We have always insisted on strict compliance with this jurisdictional standing requirement. See, e. g., ibid. (under
Article III, "federal courts may exercise power only `in the
last resort, and as a necessity' ") (quoting Chicago & Grand
Trunk R. Co. v. Wellman, 143 U. S. 339, 345 (1892)); Muskrat
v. United States, 219 U. S. 346, 356 (1911) ("[F]rom its earliest history this [C]ourt has consistently declined to exercise
any powers other than those which are strictly judicial in
their nature"). And our standing inquiry has been especially rigorous when reaching the merits of the dispute
would force us to decide whether an action taken by one

820 RAINES v. BYRD

Opinion of the Court
of the other two branches of the Federal Government wasunconstitutional. See, e. g., Bender, supra, at 542; Valley

Forge, supra, at 473-474. As we said in Allen, supra, at752, "the law of Art. III standing is built on a single basic
idea--the idea of separation of powers." In the light of thisoverriding and time-honored concern about keeping the Judiciary's power within its proper constitutional sphere,3 wemust put aside the natural urge to proceed directly to the
merits of this important dispute and to "settle" it for thesake of convenience and efficiency. Instead, we must carefully inquire as to whether appellees have met their burdenof establishing that their claimed injury is personal, particularized, concrete, and otherwise judicially cognizable.

III
We have never had occasion to rule on the question of leg-islative standing presented here.

4 In Powell v. McCormack,

395 U. S. 486, 496, 512-514 (1969), we held that a Member of

3 It is settled that Congress cannot erase Article III's standing requirements by statutorily granting the right to sue to a plaintiff who would not
otherwise have standing. Gladstone, Realtors v. Village of Bellwood, 441
U. S. 91, 100 (1979). We acknowledge, though, that Congress' decision to
grant a particular plaintiff the right to challenge an Act's constitutionality
(as here, see $ 692(a)(1), supra, at 815-816) eliminates any prudential
standing limitations and significantly lessens the risk of unwanted conflict
with the Legislative Branch when that plaintiff brings suit. See, e. g.,
Bennett v. Spear, 520 U. S. 154, 164-166 (1997).

4 Over strong dissent, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia

Circuit has held that Members of Congress may have standing when (as
here) they assert injury to their institutional power as legislators. See,
e. g., Kennedy v. Sampson, 511 F. 2d 430, 435-436 (CADC 1974); Moore v.
United States House of Representatives, 733 F. 2d 946, 951 (CADC 1984);
id., at 956 (Scalia, J., concurring in result); Barnes v. Kline, 759 F. 2d 21,
28-29 (CADC 1985); id., at 41 (Bork, J., dissenting). But see Holtzman v.
Schlesinger, 484 F. 2d 1307, 1315 (CA2 1973) (Member of Congress has no
standing to challenge constitutionality of American military operations in
Vietnam war); Harrington v. Schlesinger, 528 F. 2d 455, 459 (CA4 1975)
(same).

Opinion of the Court
Congress' constitutional challenge to his exclusion from theHouse of Representatives (and his consequent loss of salary)

presented an Article III case or controversy. But Powelldoes not help appellees. First, appellees have not been singled out for specially unfavorable treatment as opposed to
other Members of their respective bodies. Their claim isthat the Act causes a type of institutional injury (the diminution of legislative power), which necessarily damages allMembers of Congress and both Houses of Congress equally.
See n. 7, infra. Second, appellees do not claim that theyhave been deprived of something to which they

personally
are entitled--such as their seats as Members of Congress
after their constituents had elected them. Rather, appellees' claim of standing is based on a loss of political power,
not loss of any private right, which would make the injury
more concrete. Unlike the injury claimed by Congressman
Adam Clayton Powell, the injury claimed by the Members of
Congress here is not claimed in any private capacity but
solely because they are Members of Congress. See Complaint || 14 (purporting to sue "in their official capacities").
If one of the Members were to retire tomorrow, he would no
longer have a claim; the claim would be possessed by his
successor instead. The claimed injury thus runs (in a sense)
with the Member's seat, a seat which the Member holds (it
may quite arguably be said) as trustee for his constituents,
not as a prerogative of personal power. See The Federalist
No. 62, p. 378 (J. Madison) (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) ("It is a
misfortune incident to republican government, though in a
less degree than to other governments, that those who administer it may forget their obligations to their constituents
and prove unfaithful to their important trust").

The one case in which we have upheld standing for legislators (albeit state legislators) claiming an institutional injury
is Coleman v. Miller, 307 U. S. 433 (1939). Appellees, relying heavily on this case, claim that they, like the state legislators in Coleman, "have a plain, direct and adequate interest

822 RAINES v. BYRD

Opinion of the Court
in maintaining the effectiveness of their votes," id., at 438,sufficient to establish standing. In Coleman, 20 of Kansas'

40 State Senators voted not to ratify the proposed "ChildLabor Amendment" to the Federal Constitution. With the
vote deadlocked 20 to 20, the amendment ordinarily wouldnot have been ratified. However, the State's Lieutenant
Governor, the presiding officer of the State Senate, cast adeciding vote in favor of the amendment, and it was deemed
ratified (after the State House of Representatives voted toratify it). The 20 State Senators who had voted against the
amendment, joined by a 21st State Senator and three StateHouse Members, filed an action in the Kansas Supreme
Court seeking a writ of mandamus that would compel theappropriate state officials to recognize that the legislature
had not in fact ratified the amendment. That court held thatthe members of the legislature had standing to bring their
mandamus action, but ruled against them on the merits.See id., at 436-437.

This Court affirmed. By a vote of 5-4, we held that themembers of the legislature had standing.

5 In explaining our

holding, we repeatedly emphasized that if these legislators(who were suing as a bloc) were correct on the merits, then

their votes not to ratify the amendment were deprived ofall validity:

"Here, the plaintiffs include twenty senators, whosevotes against ratification have been overridden and vir5 Chief Justice Hughes wrote an opinion styled "the opinion of the
Court." Coleman, 307 U. S., at 435. Four Justices concurred in the judgment, partially on the ground that the legislators lacked standing. See
id., at 456-457 (opinion of Black, J., joined by Roberts, Frankfurter, and
Douglas, JJ.); id., at 460 (opinion of Frankfurter, J., joined by Roberts,
Black, and Douglas, JJ.). Two Justices dissented on the merits. See id.,
at 470 (opinion of Butler, J., joined by McReynolds, J.). Thus, even though
there were only two Justices who joined Chief Justice Hughes' opinion on
the merits, it is apparent that the two dissenting Justices joined his opinion as to the standing discussion. Otherwise, Justice Frankfurter's opinion denying standing would have been the controlling opinion.

Opinion of the Court
tually held for naught although if they are right in their
contentions their votes would have been sufficient to defeat ratification. We think that these senators have
a plain, direct and adequate interest in maintaining

the effectiveness of their votes." Id., at 438 (emphasis
added).

"[T]he twenty senators were not only qualified to vote
on the question of ratification but their votes, if the Lieutenant Governor were excluded as not being a part of
the legislature for that purpose, would have been decisive in defeating the ratifying resolution." Id., at 441
(emphasis added).

"[W]e find no departure from principle in recognizing in
the instant case that at least the twenty senators whose
votes, if their contention were sustained, would have
been sufficient to defeat the resolution ratifying the proposed constitutional amendment, have an interest in the
controversy which, treated by the state court as a basis
for entertaining and deciding the federal questions, is
sufficient to give the Court jurisdiction to review that
decision." Id., at 446 (emphasis added).

It is obvious, then, that our holding in Coleman stands (at
most, see n. 8, infra) for the proposition that legislators
whose votes would have been sufficient to defeat (or enact) a
specific legislative Act have standing to sue if that legislative
action goes into effect (or does not go into effect), on the
ground that their votes have been completely nullified.6

6 See also Bender v. Williamsport Area School Dist., 475 U. S. 534, 544-
545, n. 7 (1986) (in dicta, suggesting hypothetically that if state law authorized a school board to take action only by unanimous consent, if a school
board member voted against a particular action, and if the board nonetheless took the action, the board member "might claim that he was legally
entitled to protect `the effectiveness of [his] vot[e],' Coleman[, 307 U. S.,
at 438,] . . . [b]ut in that event [he] would have to allege that his vote was
diluted or rendered nugatory under state law").

824 RAINES v. BYRD

Opinion of the Court
It should be equally obvious that appellees' claim does notfall within our holding in Coleman, as thus understood.

They have not alleged that they voted for a specific bill, thatthere were sufficient votes to pass the bill, and that the bill
was nonetheless deemed defeated. In the vote on the Act,their votes were given full effect. They simply lost that
vote.7 Nor can they allege that the Act will nullify theirvotes in the future in the same way that the votes of the
Coleman legislators had been nullified. In the future, amajority of Senators and Congressmen can pass or reject

appropriations bills; the Act has no effect on this process.In addition, a majority of Senators and Congressmen can
vote to repeal the Act, or to exempt a given appropriationsbill (or a given provision in an appropriations bill) from the
Act; again, the Act has no effect on this process. Colemanthus provides little meaningful precedent for appellees'
argument.8

7 Just as appellees cannot show that their vote was denied or nullified
as in Coleman (in the sense that a bill they voted for would have become
law if their vote had not been stripped of its validity), so are they unable
to show that their vote was denied or nullified in a discriminatory manner
(in the sense that their vote was denied its full validity in relation to
the votes of their colleagues). Thus, the various hypotheticals offered
by appellees in their briefs and discussed during oral argument have no
applicability to this case. See Reply Brief for Appellees 6 (positing hypothetical law in which "first-term Members were not allowed to vote on
appropriations bills," or in which "every Member was disqualified on
grounds of partiality from voting on major federal projects in his or her
own district"); Tr. of Oral Arg. 17 ("QUESTION: But [Congress] might
have passed a statute that said the Senators from Iowa on hog-farming
matters should have only a half-a-vote. Would they have standing to
challenge that?").

8 Since we hold that Coleman may be distinguished from the instant

case on this ground, we need not decide whether Coleman may also be
distinguished in other ways. For instance, appellants have argued that
Coleman has no applicability to a similar suit brought in federal court,
since that decision depended on the fact that the Kansas Supreme Court
"treated" the senators' interest in their votes "as a basis for entertaining
and deciding the federal questions." 307 U. S., at 446. They have also

521US2 Unit: $U92 [11-23-99 19:02:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN

825Cite as: 521 U. S. 811 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
Nevertheless, appellees rely heavily on our statement inColeman that the Kansas senators had "a plain, direct and

adequate interest in maintaining the effectiveness of theirvotes." Appellees claim that this statement applies to them
because their votes on future appropriations bills (assuminga majority of Congress does not decide to exempt those bills
from the Act) will be less "effective" than before, and thatthe "meaning" and "integrity" of their vote has changed.
Brief for Appellees 24, 28. The argument goes as follows.Before the Act, Members of Congress could be sure that
when they voted for, and Congress passed, an appropriationsbill that included funds for Project X, one of two things
would happen: (i) the bill would become law and all of theprojects listed in the bill would go into effect, or (ii) the bill
would not become law and none of the projects listed in thebill would go into effect. Either way, a vote for the appropriations bill meant a vote for a package of projects thatwere inextricably linked. After the Act, however, a vote for
an appropriations bill that includes Project X means some-thing different. Now, in addition to the two possibilities
listed above, there is a third option: The bill will become lawand then the President will "cancel" Project X.

9

Even taking appellees at their word about the change inthe "meaning" and "effectiveness" of their vote for appropriations bills which are subject to the Act, we think their argu-ment pulls Coleman too far from its moorings. Appellees'

argued that Coleman has no applicability to a similar suit brought by
federal legislators, since the separation-of-powers concerns present in such
a suit were not present in Coleman, and since any federalism concerns
were eliminated by the Kansas Supreme Court's decision to take jurisdiction over the case.

9 Although Congress could reinstate Project X through a "disapproval

bill," it would assumedly take two-thirds of both Houses to do so, since
the President could be expected to veto the Project X "disapproval bill."
But see Robinson, Public Choice Speculations on the Item Veto, 74 Va. L.
Rev. 403, 411-412 (1988) (political costs that President would suffer in
important congressional districts might limit use of line-item veto).

826 RAINES v. BYRD

Opinion of the Court
use of the word "effectiveness" to link their argument to
Coleman stretches the word far beyond the sense in which
the Coleman opinion used it. There is a vast difference be-tween the level of vote nullification at issue in

Coleman and
the abstract dilution of institutional legislative power that is
alleged here. To uphold standing here would require a dras-tic extension of

Coleman. We are unwilling to take that
step.Not only do appellees lack support from precedent, but

historical practice appears to cut against them as well. Itis evident from several episodes in our history that in analogous confrontations between one or both Houses of Congress
and the Executive Branch, no suit was brought on the basis
of claimed injury to official authority or power. The Tenure
of Office Act, passed by Congress over the veto of President
Andrew Johnson in 1867, was a thorn in the side of succeeding Presidents until it was finally repealed at the behest of
President Grover Cleveland in 1887. See generally W.
Rehnquist, Grand Inquests: The Historic Impeachments of
Justice Samuel Chase and President Andrew Johnson 210-
235, 260-268 (1992). It provided that an official whose appointment to an Executive Branch office required confirmation by the Senate could not be removed without the consent
of the Senate. 14 Stat. 430, ch. 154. In 1868, Johnson removed his Secretary of War, Edwin M. Stanton. Within a
week, the House of Representatives impeached Johnson. 1
Trial of Andrew Johnson, President of the United States,
Before the Senate of the United States on Impeachment by
the House of Representatives for High Crimes and Misdemeanors 4 (1868). One of the principal charges against him
was that his removal of Stanton violated the Tenure of Office
Act. Id., at 6-8. At the conclusion of his trial before the
Senate, Johnson was acquitted by one vote. 2 id., at 487,
496-498. Surely Johnson had a stronger claim of diminution
of his official power as a result of the Tenure of Office Act
than do the appellees in the present case. Indeed, if their

Opinion of the Court
claim were sustained, it would appear that President John-son would have had standing to challenge the Tenure of Office Act before he ever thought about firing a cabinet mem-ber, simply on the grounds that it altered the calculus by
which he would nominate someone to his cabinet. Yet if the
federal courts had entertained an action to adjudicate theconstitutionality of the Tenure of Office Act immediately

after its passage in 1867, they would have been improperlyand unnecessarily plunged into the bitter political battle
being waged between the President and Congress.Succeeding Presidents--Ulysses S. Grant and Grover
Cleveland--urged Congress to repeal the Tenure of Office
Act, and Cleveland's plea was finally heeded in 1887. 24
Stat. 500, ch. 353. It occurred to neither of these Presidents
that they might challenge the Act in an Article III court.
Eventually, in a suit brought by a plaintiff with traditional
Article III standing, this Court did have the opportunity to
pass on the constitutionality of the provision contained in the
Tenure of Office Act. A sort of mini-Tenure of Office Act
covering only the Post Office Department had been enacted
in 1872, 17 Stat. 284, ch. 335, $ 2, and it remained on the
books after the Tenure of Office Act's repeal in 1887. In
the last days of the Woodrow Wilson administration, Albert
Burleson, Wilson's Postmaster General, came to believe that
Frank Myers, the Postmaster in Portland, Oregon, had committed fraud in the course of his official duties. When
Myers refused to resign, Burleson, acting at the direction of
the President, removed him. Myers sued in the Court of
Claims to recover lost salary. In Myers v. United States,
272 U. S. 52 (1926), more than half a century after Johnson's
impeachment, this Court held that Congress could not require senatorial consent to the removal of a Postmaster who
had been appointed by the President with the consent of the
Senate. Id., at 106-107, 173, 176. In the course of its opinion, the Court expressed the view that the original Tenure
of Office Act was unconstitutional. Id., at 176. See also id.,

Opinion of the Court
at 173 ("This Court has, since the Tenure of Office Act, manifested an earnest desire to avoid a final settlement of the
question until it should be inevitably presented, as it is
here").

If the appellees in the present case have standing, presumably President Wilson, or Presidents Grant and Cleveland
before him, would likewise have had standing, and could
have challenged the law preventing the removal of a Presidential appointee without the consent of Congress. Similarly, in INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919 (1983), the Attorney
General would have had standing to challenge the one-House
veto provision because it rendered his authority provisional
rather than final. By parity of reasoning, President Gerald
Ford could have sued to challenge the appointment provisions of the Federal Election Campaign Act which were
struck down in Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1 (1976) (per curiam), and a Member of Congress could have challenged the
validity of President Coolidge's pocket veto that was sustained in The Pocket Veto Case, 279 U. S. 655 (1929).

There would be nothing irrational about a system that
granted standing in these cases; some European constitutional courts operate under one or another variant of such a
regime. See, e. g., Favoreu, Constitutional Review in Europe, in Constitutionalism and Rights 38, 41 (L. Henkin & A.
Rosenthal eds. 1990); Wright Sheive, Central and Eastern
European Constitutional Courts and the Antimajoritarian
Objection to Judicial Review, 26 Law & Pol'y Int'l Bus. 1201,
1209 (1995); A. Stone, The Birth of Judicial Politics in France
232 (1992); D. Kommers, Judicial Politics in West Germany: A
Study of the Federal Constitutional Court 106 (1976). But
it is obviously not the regime that has obtained under our
Constitution to date. Our regime contemplates a more restricted role for Article III courts, well expressed by Justice
Powell in his concurring opinion in United States v. Richardson, 418 U. S. 166 (1974):

Opinion of the Court
"The irreplaceable value of the power articulated by Mr.Chief Justice Marshall [in Marbury v. Madison, 1

Cranch 137 (1803),] lies in the protection it has affordedthe constitutional rights and liberties of individual citizens and minority groups against oppressive or discrimi-natory government action. It is this role, not some
amorphous general supervision of the operations of gov-ernment, that has maintained public esteem for the federal courts and has permitted the peaceful coexistenceof the countermajoritarian implications of judicial review and the democratic principles upon which our Fed-eral Government in the final analysis rests."

Id., at192.

IV
In sum, appellees have alleged no injury to themselves asindividuals (contra,

Powell), the institutional injury they al-lege is wholly abstract and widely dispersed (contra,

Cole-man), and their attempt to litigate this dispute at this time

and in this form is contrary to historical experience. Weattach some importance to the fact that appellees have not
been authorized to represent their respective Houses of Con-gress in this action, and indeed both Houses actively oppose
their suit.10 See n. 2, supra. We also note that our conclu-sion neither deprives Members of Congress of an adequate
remedy (since they may repeal the Act or exempt appropria-tions bills from its reach), nor forecloses the Act from constitutional challenge (by someone who suffers judicially cogni-zable injury as a result of the Act). Whether the case would

10 Cf. Bender, 475 U. S., at 544 ("Generally speaking, members of collegial bodies do not have standing to perfect an appeal the body itself has
declined to take"); United States v. Ballin, 144 U. S. 1, 7 (1892) ("The two
houses of Congress are legislative bodies representing larger constituencies. Power is not vested in any one individual, but in the aggregate of
the members who compose the body, and its action is not the action of any
separate member or number of members, but the action of the body as
a whole").

be different if any of these circumstances were different weneed not now decide.

We therefore hold that these individual members of Con-gress do not have a sufficient "personal stake" in this dispute
and have not alleged a sufficiently concrete injury to haveestablished Article III standing.

11 The judgment of the District Court is vacated, and the case is remanded with instruc-tions to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction.

It is so ordered.
Justice Souter, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins,concurring in the judgment.

Appellees claim that the Line Item Veto Act, Pub. L. 104-130, 110 Stat. 1200, codified at 2 U. S. C. $ 691

et seq. (1994 ed.,Supp. II), is unconstitutional because it grants the President

power, which Article I vests in Congress, to repeal a provi-sion of federal law. As

Justice Stevens points out, appel-lees essentially claim that, by granting the President power

to repeal statutes, the Act injures them by depriving themof their official role in voting on the provisions that become
law. See post, at 836-837. Under our precedents, it isfairly debatable whether this injury is sufficiently "personal"
and "concrete" to satisfy the requirements of Article III.1There is, first, difficulty in applying the rule that an injury
on which standing is predicated be personal, not official. If

11 In addition, it is far from clear that this injury is "fairly traceable" to
appellants, as our precedents require, since the alleged cause of appellees'
injury is not appellants' exercise of legislative power but the actions of
their own colleagues in Congress in passing the Act. Cf. Holtzman v.
Schlesinger, 484 F. 2d 1307, 1315 (CA2 1973) ("Representative Holtzman
. . . has not been denied any right to vote on [the war in Cambodia] by any
action of the defendants [Executive Branch officials]. . . . The fact that her
vote was ineffective was due to the contrary votes of her colleagues and
not the defendants herein").

1 While Congress may, by authorizing suit for particular parties, remove

any prudential standing barriers, as it has in this case, see ante, at 820,
n. 3, it may not reduce the Article III minimums.

Souter, J., concurring in judgment
our standing doctrine recognized this as a distinction witha dispositive effect, the injury claimed would not qualify:

the Court is certainly right in concluding that appellees suenot in personal capacities, but as holders of seats in the Congress. See ante, at 821. And yet the significance of this
distinction is not so straightforward. In Braxton County
Court v. West Virginia ex rel. State Tax Comm'rs, 208 U. S.
192 (1908), it is true, we dismissed a challenge by a countycourt to a state tax law for lack of jurisdiction, broadly stating that " `the interest of a [party seeking relief] in this courtshould be a personal and not an official interest,' "

id., at 198
(quoting Smith v. Indiana, 191 U. S. 138, 149 (1903)); accord,
Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Comm. v. McGrath, 341 U. S.
123, 151 (1951) (Frankfurter, J., concurring). But the Court
found Braxton County "inapplicable" to a challenge by agroup of state legislators in

Coleman v. Miller, 307 U. S. 433,
438, and n. 3 (1939), and found the legislators had standing
even though they claimed no injury but a deprivation of
official voting power, id., at 437-446.2 Thus, it is at least

arguable that the official nature of the harm here does not
preclude standing.

Nor is appellees' injury so general that, under our case
law, they clearly cannot satisfy the requirement of concreteness. On the one hand, appellees are not simply claiming

2 As appellants note, it is also possible that the impairment of certain
official powers may support standing for Congress, or one House thereof,
to seek the aid of the Federal Judiciary. See Brief for Appellants 26, n. 14
(citing McGrain v. Daugherty, 273 U. S. 135, 174 (1927)). And, as appellants concede, see Brief for Appellants 20-21, 25-28, an injury to official
authority may support standing for a government itself or its duly authorized agents, see, e. g., Diamond v. Charles, 476 U. S. 54, 62 (1986) (noting
that "a State has standing to defend the constitutionality of its statute"
in federal court); ICC v. Oregon-Washington R. & Nav. Co., 288 U. S. 14,
25-27 (1933) (explaining that a federal agency had standing to appeal, because an official or an agency could be designated to defend the interests
of the Federal Government in federal court); Coleman v. Miller, 307 U. S.
433, 441-445 (1939) (discussing cases).

harm to their interest in having government abide by theConstitution, which would be shared to the same extent by

the public at large and thus provide no basis for suit, see,e. g., Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United
for Separation of Church and State, Inc., 454 U. S. 464, 482-483 (1982);

Schlesinger v. Reservists Comm. to Stop the War,418 U. S. 208, 217, 220 (1974); Fairchild v. Hughes, 258 U. S.

126, 129-130 (1922). Instead, appellees allege that the Actdeprives them of an element of their legislative power; as a
factual matter they have a more direct and tangible interestin the preservation of that power than the general citizenry
has. Cf. Coleman, supra, at 438 (concluding that state legis-lators had a "plain" and "direct" interest in the effectiveness
of their votes); see also Hendrick v. Walters, 865 P. 2d 1232,1236-1238 (Okla. 1993) (concluding that a legislator had a personal interest in a suit to determine whether the Governorhad lawfully assumed office due to substantial interaction between the Governor and legislature); Colorado General Assembly v. Lamm, 704 P. 2d 1371, 1376-1378 (Colo. 1985) (con-cluding that the legislature had suffered an injury in fact as

a result of the Governor's exercise of his line item veto
power). On the other hand, the alleged, continuing depriva-tion of federal legislative power is not as specific or limited

as the nullification of the decisive votes of a group of legisla-tors in connection with a specific item of legislative consideration in Coleman, being instead shared by all the membersof the official class who could suffer that injury, the Members
of Congress.3Because it is fairly debatable whether appellees' injury is
sufficiently personal and concrete to give them standing, itbehooves us to resolve the question under more general

3 As the Court explains, Coleman may well be distinguishable on the
further ground that it involved a suit by state legislators that did not
implicate either the separation-of-powers concerns raised in this case or
corresponding federalism concerns (since the Kansas Supreme Court had
exercised jurisdiction to decide a federal issue). See ante, at 824-825,
n. 8.

separation-of-powers principles underlying our standing requirements. See Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737, 752 (1984);
United States v. Richardson, 418 U. S. 166, 188-197 (1974)
(Powell, J., concurring). While "our constitutional structure
[does not] requir[e] . . . that the Judicial Branch shrink from
a confrontation with the other two coequal branches," Valley
Forge Christian College, 454 U. S., at 474, we have cautioned
that respect for the separation of powers requires the Judicial Branch to exercise restraint in deciding constitutional
issues by resolving those implicating the powers of the three
branches of Government as a "last resort," see ibid. The
counsel of restraint in this case begins with the fact that a
dispute involving only officials, and the official interests of
those, who serve in the branches of the National Government
lies far from the model of the traditional common-law cause
of action at the conceptual core of the case-or-controversy
requirement, see Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Comm., supra,
at 150, 152 (Frankfurter, J., concurring). Although the contest here is not formally between the political branches
(since Congress passed the bill augmenting Presidential
power and the President signed it), it is in substance an interbranch controversy about calibrating the legislative and
executive powers, as well as an intrabranch dispute between
segments of Congress itself. Intervention in such a controversy would risk damaging the public confidence that is vital
to the functioning of the Judicial Branch, cf. Valley Forge
Christian College, supra, at 474 (quoting Richardson, supra,
at 188 (Powell, J., concurring)), by embroiling the federal
courts in a power contest nearly at the height of its political tension.

While it is true that a suit challenging the constitutionality
of this Act brought by a party from outside the Federal Government would also involve the Court in resolving the dispute over the allocation of power between the political
branches, it would expose the Judicial Branch to a lesser
risk. Deciding a suit to vindicate an interest outside the

Souter, J., concurring in judgment
Government raises no specter of judicial readiness to enliston one side of a political tug-of-war, since "the propriety of

such action by a federal court has been recognized since
Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137 (1803)." Valley Forge
Christian College, supra, at 473-474. And just as the presence of a party beyond the Government places the Judiciaryat some remove from the political forces, the need to await

injury to such a plaintiff allows the courts some greater sepa-ration in the time between the political resolution and the
judicial review.

"[B]y connecting the censureship of the laws with the
private interests of members of the community, . . . thelegislation is protected from wanton assailants, and from

the daily aggressions of party-spirit." 1 A. de Tocque-ville, Democracy in America 105 (Schoken ed. 1961).

The virtue of waiting for a private suit is only confirmedby the certainty that another suit can come to us. The parties agree, and I see no reason to question, that if the Presi-dent "cancels" a conventional spending or tax provision pursuant to the Act, the putative beneficiaries of that provisionwill likely suffer a cognizable injury and thereby have standing under Article III. See Brief for Appellants 19-20, andn. 10; Brief for Appellees 32-33. By depriving beneficiaries
of the money to which they would otherwise be entitled, a
cancellation would produce an injury that is "actual," "per-sonal and individual," and involve harm to a "legally protected interest," Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S.555, 560, and n. 1 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted);
assuming the canceled provision would not apply equally to
the entire public, the injury would be "concrete," id., at 560,
573-574; and it would be "fairly trace[able] to the challenged
action of the" executive officials involved in the cancellation,
id., at 560 (internal quotation marks omitted), as well as
probably "redress[able] by a favorable decision," id., at 561
(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). See, e. g.,

Stevens, J., dissenting
Train v. City of New York, 420 U. S. 35, 40 (1975) (suit byCity of New York seeking proper allotment of federal funds).

While the Court has declined to lower standing requirementssimply because no one would otherwise be able to litigate
a claim, see Valley Forge Christian College, supra, at 489;
Schlesinger, 418 U. S., at 227; United States v. Richardson,
supra, at 179, the certainty of a plaintiff who obviously
would have standing to bring a suit to court after the politicshad at least subsided from a full boil is a good reason to

resolve doubts about standing against the plaintiff invokingan official interest, cf.

Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Comm.,
341 U. S., at 153-154 (Frankfurter, J., concurring) (explainingthat the availability of another person to bring suit may affect the standing calculus).

I therefore conclude that appellees' alleged injuries are insufficiently personal and concrete to satisfy Article III standing requirements of personal and concrete harm. Since this
would be so in any suit under the conditions here, I accordingly find no cognizable injury to appellees.

Justice Stevens, dissenting.
The Line Item Veto Act purports to establish a procedure
for the creation of laws that are truncated versions of bills
that have been passed by the Congress and presented to the
President for signature. If the procedure is valid, it will
deny every Senator and every Representative any opportunity to vote for or against the truncated measure that survives the exercise of the President's cancellation authority.
Because the opportunity to cast such votes is a right guaranteed by the text of the Constitution, I think it clear that the
persons who are deprived of that right by the Act have
standing to challenge its constitutionality. Moreover, because the impairment of that constitutional right has an immediate impact on their official powers, in my judgment they
need not wait until after the President has exercised his cancellation authority to bring suit. Finally, the same reason

Stevens, J., dissenting
that the appellees have standing provides a sufficient basisfor concluding that the statute is unconstitutional.

Article I, $ 7, of the Constitution provides that every Sena-tor and every Representative has the power to vote on
"Every Bill . . . before it become a law" either as a result ofits having been signed by the President or as a result of its
"Reconsideration" in the light of the President's "Objec-tions."

1 In contrast, the Line Item Veto Act establishes a

mechanism by which bills passed by both Houses of Congresswill eventually produce laws that have not passed either

House of Congress and that have not been voted on by anySenator or Representative.

Assuming for the moment that this procedure is constitu-tionally permissible, and that the President will from time
to time exercise the power to cancel portions of a just-enacted law, it follows that the statute deprives every Senator and every Representative of the right to vote for oragainst measures that may become law. The appellees cast
their challenge to the constitutionality of the Act in a slightlydifferent way. Their complaint asserted that the Act "alter[s] the legal and practical effect of all votes they may cast

1 The full text of the relevant paragraph of $ 7 provides:
"Every Bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and
the Senate, shall, before it become a law, be presented to the President of
the United States: If he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return
it, with his Objections to that House in which it shall have originated, who
shall enter the Objections at large on their Journal, and proceed to reconsider it. If after such Reconsideration two thirds of that House shall
agree to pass the Bill, it shall be sent, together with the Objections, to the
other House, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved
by two thirds of that House, it shall become a Law. But in all such Cases
the Votes of both Houses shall be determined by Yeas and Nays, and the
Names of the Persons voting for and against the Bill shall be entered on
the Journal of each House respectively. If any Bill shall not be returned
by the President within ten Days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have
been presented to him, the Same shall be a Law, in like Manner as if he
had signed it, unless the Congress by their Adjournment prevent its Return, in which Case it shall not be a Law." U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 7.

on bills containing such separately vetoable items" and "di-vest[s] the[m] of their constitutional role in the repeal of legislation." Complaint || 14. These two claimed injuries areat base the same as the injury on which I rest my analysis.
The reason the complaint frames the issues in the way thatit does is related to the Act's technical operation. Under the
Act, the President would receive and sign a bill exactly as itpassed both Houses, and would exercise his partial veto
power only after the law had been enacted. See 2 U. S. C.$ 691(a) (1994 ed., Supp. II). The appellees thus articulated
their claim as a combination of the diminished effect of their
initial vote and the circumvention of their right to participate
in the subsequent repeal. Whether one looks at the claimfrom this perspective, or as a simple denial of their right to

vote on the precise text that will ultimately become law, thebasic nature of the injury caused by the Act is the same.

In my judgment, the deprivation of this right--essentialto the legislator's office--constitutes a sufficient injury to
provide every Member of Congress with standing to chal-lenge the constitutionality of the statute. If the dilution of
an individual voter's power to elect representatives provides
that voter with standing--as it surely does, see, e. g., Bakerv.

Carr, 369 U. S. 186, 204-208 (1962)--the deprivation of the
right possessed by each Senator and Representative to votefor or against the precise text of any bill before it becomes

law must also be a sufficient injury to create Article IIIstanding for them.

2 Although, as Justice Breyer demonstrates, see post, at 840-843 (dissenting opinion), the majority's attempt to distinguish Coleman v. Miller, 307 U. S. 433,
438 (1939), is not persuasive, I need not rely on that case to

2 The appellees' assertion of their right to vote on legislation is not simply a generalized interest in the proper administration of government, cf.
Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737, 754 (1984), and the legislators' personal
interest in the ability to exercise their constitutionally ensured power to
vote on laws is certainly distinct from the interest that an individual citizen challenging the Act might assert.

Breyer, J., dissenting
support my view that the Members of Congress have stand-ing to sue in this instance. In Coleman, the legislators complained that their votes were denied full effectiveness. Seeibid.; see also Dyer v. Blair, 390 F. Supp. 1291, 1297, n. 12
(ND Ill. 1975). But the law at issue here does not simplyalter the effect of the legislators' votes; it denies them any
opportunity at all to cast votes for or against the truncatedversions of the bills presented to the President.

3

Moreover, the appellees convincingly explain how the im-mediate, constant threat of the partial veto power has a palpable effect on their current legislative choices. See Brieffor Appellees 23-25, 29-31. Because the Act has this immediate and important impact on the powers of Members ofCongress, and on the manner in which they undertake their
legislative responsibilities, they need not await an exerciseof the President's cancellation authority to institute the litigation that the statute itself authorizes. See 2 U. S. C.$ 692(a)(1) (1994 ed., Supp. II).

Given the fact that the authority at stake is granted bythe plain and unambiguous text of Article I, it is equally
clear to me that the statutory attempt to eliminate it isinvalid.

Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the DistrictCourt.

Justice Breyer, dissenting.
As the majority points out, Congress has enacted a specificstatute (signed by the President) granting the plaintiffs authority to bring this case. Ante, at 815-816, citing 2 U. S. C.

3 The majority's reference to the absence of any similar suit in earlier
disputes between Congress and the President, see ante, at 826-828, does
not strike me as particularly relevant. First, the fact that others did not
choose to bring suit does not necessarily mean the Constitution would
have precluded them from doing so. Second, because Congress did not
authorize declaratory judgment actions until the federal Declaratory Judgment Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 955, the fact that President Johnson did not
bring such an action in 1868 is not entirely surprising.

$ 692(a)(1) (1994 ed., Supp. II). That statutory authorization"eliminates any prudential standing limitations and significantly lessens the risk of unwanted conflict with the Legis-lative Branch."

Ante, at 820, n. 3. Congress, however,
cannot grant the federal courts more power than the
Constitution itself authorizes us to exercise. Cf. Hayburn's
Case, 2 Dall. 409 (1792). Thus, we can proceed to the merits
only if the "judicial Power" of the United States--"extend-[ing] to . . . Cases, in Law and Equity" and to "Controversies"--covers the dispute before us. U. S. Const., Art. III,$ 2.

I concede that there would be no case or controversy here
were the dispute before us not truly adversary, or were it
not concrete and focused. But the interests that the parties
assert are genuine and opposing, and the parties are therefore truly adverse. Cf. Chicago & Grand Trunk R. Co. v.
Wellman, 143 U. S. 339 (1892). Moreover, as Justice Stevens points out, the harm that the plaintiffs suffer (on their
view of the law) consists in part of the systematic abandonment of laws for which a majority voted, in part of the creation of other laws in violation of procedural rights which
(they say) the Constitution provides them, and in part of the
consequent and immediate impediment to their ability to do
the job that the Constitution requires them to do. See ante,
at 835-837, 838 (dissenting opinion); Complaint || 14; App. 34-
36, 39-40, 42-46, 54-55, 57-59, 62-64. Since federal courts
might well adjudicate cases involving comparable harms in
other contexts (such as purely private contexts), the harm at
issue is sufficiently concrete. Cf., e. g., Bennett v. Spear, 520
U. S. 154, 167-174 (1997); Northeastern Fla. Chapter, Associated Gen. Contractors of America v. Jacksonville, 508 U. S.
656 (1993). See also ante, at 831-832 (Souter, J., concurring in judgment). The harm is focused and the accompanying legal issues are both focused and of the sort that this
Court is used to deciding. See, e. g., United States v.
Munoz-Flores, 495 U. S. 385, 392-396 (1990). The plaintiffs

therefore do not ask the Court "to pass upon" an "abstract,intellectual proble[m]," but to determine "a concrete, living contest between" genuine "adversaries." Coleman v.
Miller, 307 U. S. 433, 460 (1939) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting).

Nonetheless, there remains a serious constitutional difficulty due to the fact that this dispute about lawmaking pro-cedures arises between Government officials and is brought

by legislators. The critical question is whether or not thisdispute, for that reason, is so different in form from those
"matters that were the traditional concern of the courts atWestminster" that it falls outside the scope of Article III's
judicial power. Ibid. Justice Frankfurter explained thisargument in his dissent in

Coleman, saying that courts
traditionally

"leave intra-parliamentary controversies to parliaments
and outside the scrutiny of law courts. The proceduresfor voting in legislative assemblies--who are members,

how and when they should vote, what is the requisite
number of votes for different phases of legislative activ-ity, what votes were cast and how they were counted--

surely are matters that not merely concern political ac-tion, but are of the very essence of political action, if
`political' has any connotation at all. . . . In no senseare they matters of `private damage.' They pertain to
legislators not as individuals but as political representa-tives executing the legislative process. To open the law
courts to such controversies is to have courts sit in judgment on the manifold disputes engendered by proce-dures for voting in legislative assemblies."

Id., at
469-470.

Justice Frankfurter dissented because, in his view, the "political" nature of the case, which involved legislators, placed
the dispute outside the scope of Article III's "case" or "controversy" requirement. Nonetheless, the Coleman court
rejected his argument.

Breyer, J., dissenting
Although the majority today attempts to distinguish Coleman, ante, at 821-826, I do not believe that Justice Frankfurter's argument or variations on its theme can carry theday here. First, as previously mentioned, the jurisdictional

statute before us eliminates all but constitutional considerations, and the circumstances mentioned above remove all butthe "political" or "intragovernmental" aspect of the constitutional issue. Supra, at 838-839.Second, the Constitution does not draw an absolute line
between disputes involving a "personal" harm and those in-volving an "official" harm." Cf.

ante, at 818, 821. See ante,
at 831, n. 2 (Souter, J., concurring in judgment). Justice
Frankfurter himself said that this Court had heard cases involving injuries suffered by state officials in their official capacities. Coleman, supra, at 466 (citing Blodgett v. Silberman, 277 U. S. 1 (1928), and Boynton v. Hutchinson, 291
U. S. 656, cert. dism'd on other grounds, 292 U. S. 601 (1934)).
See also, e. g., Will v. Calvert Fire Ins. Co., 437 U. S. 655, 661
(1978) (Federal District Judge appealing mandamus issued
against him in respect to a docketkeeping matter); Board of
Ed. of Central School Dist. No. 1 v. Allen, 392 U. S. 236, 241,
n. 5 (1968) (indicating that school board has standing where
members must either violate oath or risk loss of school funds
and expulsion from office). Coleman itself involved injuries
in the plaintiff legislators' official capacity. And the majority in this case, suggesting that legislators might have standing to complain of rules that "denied" them "their vote . . .
in a discriminatory manner," concedes at least the possibility
that any constitutional rule distinguishing "official" from
"personal" injury is not absolute. Ante, at 824, n. 7. See
also ante, at 821.

Third, Justice Frankfurter's views were dissenting views,
and the dispute before us, when compared to Coleman, presents a much stronger claim, not a weaker claim, for constitutional justiciability. The lawmakers in Coleman complained
of a lawmaking procedure that, at worst, improperly counted

Breyer, J., dissenting
Kansas as having ratified one proposed constitutional amend-ment, which had been ratified by only 5 other States, and

rejected by 26, making it unlikely that it would ever becomelaw.

Coleman, supra, at 436. The lawmakers in this case
complain of a lawmaking procedure that threatens the validity of many laws (for example, all appropriations laws) thatCongress regularly and frequently enacts. The systematic

nature of the harm immediately affects the legislators' abil-ity to do their jobs. The harms here are more serious, more
pervasive, and more immediate than the harm at issue in
Coleman. Cf. Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans
United for Separation of Church and State, Inc., 454 U. S.464, 471 (1982), quoting

Chicago & Grand Trunk R. Co. v.
Wellman, 143 U. S., at 345 ( judicial power " `is legitimate
only in the last resort, and as a necessity in the determina-tion of real, earnest and vital controversy' ").

The majority finds a difference in the fact that the validityof the legislators' votes was directly at issue in

Coleman.

"[O]ur holding in Coleman stands . . . for the propositionthat legislators whose votes would have been sufficient

to defeat (or enact) a specific legislative Act have stand-ing to sue if that legislative action goes into effect (or
does not go into effect), on the ground that their voteshave been completely nullified."

Ante, at 823.

But since many of the present plaintiffs will likely vote inthe majority for at least some appropriations bills that are

then subject to Presidential cancellation, I think that--ontheir view of the law--their votes are threatened with nullification too. Cf. ante, at 823, n. 6, 825.

The majority also suggests various distinctions arising out
of the fact that Coleman involved a state legislature, rather
than the federal Congress. Ante, at 824-825, n. 8. See also
ante, at 832, n. 3 (Souter, J., concurring in judgment). But
Justice Frankfurter treated comparable arguments as irrelevant, and the Coleman majority did not disagree. Coleman,

Breyer, J., dissenting
307 U. S., at 462, 465-466, and n. 6 (Frankfurter, J., dissent-ing); id., at 446. While I recognize the existence of potential

differences between state and federal legislators, I do notbelieve that those differences would be determinative here,
where constitutional, not prudential, considerations are atissue, particularly given the Constitution's somewhat comparable concerns for state authority and the presence here ofa federal statute (signed by the President) specifically authorizing this lawsuit. Cf. ante, at 833 (Souter, J., concur-ring in judgment). And in light of the immediacy of the
harm, I do not think that the possibility of a later challengeby a private plaintiff, see

ante, at 834-835 (Souter, J., con-curring in judgment), could be constitutionally determinative. Finally, I do not believe that the majority's historicalexamples primarily involving the Executive Branch and involving lawsuits that were not brought, ante, at 826-828, arelegally determinative. See

ante, at 838, n. 3 (Stevens, J.,dissenting).

In sum, I do not believe that the Court can find this casenonjusticiable without overruling

Coleman. Since it doesnot do so, I need not decide whether the systematic nature,

seriousness, and immediacy of the harm would make this dis-pute constitutionally justiciable even in Coleman's absence.
Rather, I can and would find this case justiciable on Cole-man's authority. I add that because the majority has decided that this dispute is not now justiciable and has ex-pressed no view on the merits of the appeal, I shall not
discuss the merits either, but reserve them for futureargument.

appeal from the united states district court for theeastern district of pennsylvania

No. 96-511. Argued March 19, 1997--Decided June 26, 1997
Two provisions of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 (CDA or Act)

seek to protect minors from harmful material on the Internet, an international network of interconnected computers that enables millions of
people to communicate with one another in "cyberspace" and to access
vast amounts of information from around the world. Title 47 U. S. C.

$ 223(a)(1)(B)(ii) (1994 ed., Supp. II) criminalizes the "knowing" transmission of "obscene or indecent" messages to any recipient under 18
years of age. Section 223(d) prohibits the "knowin[g]" sending or displaying to a person under 18 of any message "that, in context, depicts
or describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary
community standards, sexual or excretory activities or organs." Affirmative defenses are provided for those who take "good faith, . . .
effective . . . actions" to restrict access by minors to the prohibited
communications, $ 223(e)(5)(A), and those who restrict such access by
requiring certain designated forms of age proof, such as a verified credit
card or an adult identification number, $ 223(e)(5)(B). A number of
plaintiffs filed suit challenging the constitutionality of $$ 223(a)(1) and
223(d). After making extensive findings of fact, a three-judge District
Court convened pursuant to the Act entered a preliminary injunction
against enforcement of both challenged provisions. The court's judgment enjoins the Government from enforcing $ 223(a)(1)(B)'s prohibitions insofar as they relate to "indecent" communications, but expressly
preserves the Government's right to investigate and prosecute the obscenity or child pornography activities prohibited therein. The injunction against enforcement of $ 223(d) is unqualified because that section
contains no separate reference to obscenity or child pornography. The
Government appealed to this Court under the Act's special review provisions, arguing that the District Court erred in holding that the CDA
violated both the First Amendment because it is overbroad and the
Fifth Amendment because it is vague.

Held: The CDA's "indecent transmission" and "patently offensive display"

provisions abridge "the freedom of speech" protected by the First
Amendment. Pp. 864-885.

Syllabus
(a) Although the CDA's vagueness is relevant to the First Amendment overbreadth inquiry, the judgment should be affirmed without
reaching the Fifth Amendment issue. P. 864.

(b) A close look at the precedents relied on by the Government--
Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U. S. 629; FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438
U. S. 726; and Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U. S. 41--raises,
rather than relieves, doubts about the CDA's constitutionality. The
CDA differs from the various laws and orders upheld in those cases in
many ways, including that it does not allow parents to consent to their
children's use of restricted materials; is not limited to commercial transactions; fails to provide any definition of "indecent" and omits any requirement that "patently offensive" material lack socially redeeming
value; neither limits its broad categorical prohibitions to particular
times nor bases them on an evaluation by an agency familiar with the
medium's unique characteristics; is punitive; applies to a medium that,
unlike radio, receives full First Amendment protection; and cannot be
properly analyzed as a form of time, place, and manner regulation because it is a content-based blanket restriction on speech. These precedents, then, do not require the Court to uphold the CDA and are fully
consistent with the application of the most stringent review of its provisions. Pp. 864-868.

(c) The special factors recognized in some of the Court's cases as justifying regulation of the broadcast media--the history of extensive Government regulation of broadcasting, see, e. g., Red Lion Broadcasting
Co. v. FCC, 395 U. S. 367, 399-400; the scarcity of available frequencies
at its inception, see, e. g., Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512
U. S. 622, 637-638; and its "invasive" nature, see Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U. S. 115, 128--are not present in cyberspace. Thus, these cases provide no basis for qualifying the level
of First Amendment scrutiny that should be applied to the Internet.
Pp. 868-870.

(d) Regardless of whether the CDA is so vague that it violates the
Fifth Amendment, the many ambiguities concerning the scope of its
coverage render it problematic for First Amendment purposes. For
instance, its use of the undefined terms "indecent" and "patently offensive" will provoke uncertainty among speakers about how the two
standards relate to each other and just what they mean. The vagueness of such a content-based regulation, see, e. g., Gentile v. State Bar
of Nev., 501 U. S. 1030, coupled with its increased deterrent effect as a
criminal statute, see, e. g., Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 U. S. 479, raise
special First Amendment concerns because of its obvious chilling effect
on free speech. Contrary to the Government's argument, the CDA is
not saved from vagueness by the fact that its "patently offensive" stand521US2 Unit: $U93 [11-20-99 16:42:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN
846 RENO v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION

Syllabus
ard repeats the second part of the three-prong obscenity test set forth
in Miller v. California, 413 U. S. 15, 24. The second Miller prong reduces the inherent vagueness of its own "patently offensive" term by
requiring that the proscribed material be "specifically defined by the
applicable state law." In addition, the Miller definition applies only to
"sexual conduct," whereas the CDA prohibition extends also to "excretory activities" and "organs" of both a sexual and excretory nature.
Each of Miller's other two prongs also critically limits the uncertain sweep of the obscenity definition. Just because a definition including three limitations is not vague, it does not follow that one of those
limitations, standing alone, is not vague. The CDA's vagueness undermines the likelihood that it has been carefully tailored to the congressional goal of protecting minors from potentially harmful materials.
Pp. 870-874.

(e) The CDA lacks the precision that the First Amendment requires
when a statute regulates the content of speech. Although the Government has an interest in protecting children from potentially harmful
materials, see, e. g., Ginsberg, 390 U. S., at 639, the CDA pursues that
interest by suppressing a large amount of speech that adults have a
constitutional right to send and receive, see, e. g., Sable, 492 U. S., at
126. Its breadth is wholly unprecedented. The CDA's burden on adult
speech is unacceptable if less restrictive alternatives would be at least
as effective in achieving the Act's legitimate purposes. See, e. g., id.,
at 126. The Government has not proved otherwise. On the other
hand, the District Court found that currently available user-based software suggests that a reasonably effective method by which parents can
prevent their children from accessing material which the parents believe is inappropriate will soon be widely available. Moreover, the arguments in this Court referred to possible alternatives such as requiring
that indecent material be "tagged" to facilitate parental control, making
exceptions for messages with artistic or educational value, providing
some tolerance for parental choice, and regulating some portions of the
Internet differently from others. Particularly in the light of the absence of any detailed congressional findings, or even hearings addressing the CDA's special problems, the Court is persuaded that the CDA
is not narrowly tailored. Pp. 874-879.

(f) The Government's three additional arguments for sustaining the
CDA's affirmative prohibitions are rejected. First, the contention that
the Act is constitutional because it leaves open ample "alternative channels" of communication is unpersuasive because the CDA regulates
speech on the basis of its content, so that a "time, place, and manner"
analysis is inapplicable. See, e. g., Consolidated Edison Co. of N. Y. v.

521US2 Unit: $U93 [11-20-99 16:42:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Syllabus
Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 530, 536. Second, the assertion
that the CDA's "knowledge" and "specific person" requirements significantly restrict its permissible application to communications to persons
the sender knows to be under 18 is untenable, given that most Internet
forums are open to all comers and that even the strongest reading of
the "specific person" requirement would confer broad powers of censorship, in the form of a "heckler's veto," upon any opponent of indecent
speech. Finally, there is no textual support for the submission that
material having scientific, educational, or other redeeming social value
will necessarily fall outside the CDA's prohibitions. Pp. 879-881.

(g) The $ 223(e)(5) defenses do not constitute the sort of "narrow tailoring" that would save the CDA. The Government's argument that
transmitters may take protective "good faith actio[n]" by "tagging"
their indecent communications in a way that would indicate their contents, thus permitting recipients to block their reception with appropriate software, is illusory, given the requirement that such action be
"effective": The proposed screening software does not currently exist,
but, even if it did, there would be no way of knowing whether a potential
recipient would actually block the encoded material. The Government
also failed to prove that $ 223(b)(5)'s verification defense would significantly reduce the CDA's heavy burden on adult speech. Although
such verification is actually being used by some commercial providers of sexually explicit material, the District Court's findings indicate
that it is not economically feasible for most noncommercial speakers.
Pp. 881-882.

(h) The Government's argument that this Court should preserve the
CDA's constitutionality by honoring its severability clause, $ 608, and by
construing nonseverable terms narrowly, is acceptable in only one respect. Because obscene speech may be banned totally, see Miller, 413
U. S., at 18, and $ 223(a)'s restriction of "obscene" material enjoys a textual manifestation separate from that for "indecent" material, the Court
can sever the term "or indecent" from the statute, leaving the rest of

$ 223(a) standing. Pp. 882-885.

(i) The Government's argument that its "significant" interest in
fostering the Internet's growth provides an independent basis for upholding the CDA's constitutionality is singularly unpersuasive. The
dramatic expansion of this new forum contradicts the factual basis
underlying this contention: that the unregulated availability of "indecent" and "patently offensive" material is driving people away from the
Internet. P. 885.

929 F. Supp. 824, affirmed.

Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court.
At issue is the constitutionality of two statutory provisionsenacted to protect minors from "indecent" and "patently offensive" communications on the Internet. Notwithstandingthe legitimacy and importance of the congressional goal of

freedom of speech" protected by the First Amendment.1

military program called "ARPANET," 3 which was designedto enable computers operated by the military, defense contractors, and universities conducting defense-related re-search to communicate with one another by redundant channels even if some portions of the network were damaged ina war. While the ARPANET no longer exists, it provided
an example for the development of a number of civilian net-works that, eventually linking with each other, now enable
tens of millions of people to communicate with one anotherand to access vast amounts of information from around the
world. The Internet is "a unique and wholly new mediumof worldwide human communication."

The Internet has experienced "extraordinary growth." 5The number of "host" computers--those that store information and relay communications--increased from about 300 in1981 to approximately 9,400,000 by the time of the trial in
1996. Roughly 60% of these hosts are located in the UnitedStates. About 40 million people used the Internet at the
time of trial, a number that is expected to mushroom to 200million by 1999.

Individuals can obtain access to the Internet from manydifferent sources, generally hosts themselves or entities with
a host affiliation. Most colleges and universities provide ac-cess for their students and faculty; many corporations provide their employees with access through an office network;many communities and local libraries provide free access;
and an increasing number of storefront "computer coffeeshops" provide access for a small hourly fee. Several major
national "online services" such as America Online, Compu-Serve, the Microsoft Network, and Prodigy offer access to
their own extensive proprietary networks as well as a linkto the much larger resources of the Internet. These com3 An acronym for the network developed by the Advanced Research

Opinion of the Court
mercial online services had almost 12 million individual sub-scribers at the time of trial.

Anyone with access to the Internet may take advantageof a wide variety of communication and information retrieval
methods. These methods are constantly evolving and difficult to categorize precisely. But, as presently constituted,those most relevant to this case are electronic mail (e-mail),

automatic mailing list services ("mail exploders," sometimesreferred to as "listservs"), "newsgroups," "chat rooms," and
the "World Wide Web." All of these methods can be usedto transmit text; most can transmit sound, pictures, and moving video images. Taken together, these tools constitute a
unique medium--known to its users as "cyberspace"--located in no particular geographical location but available to
anyone, anywhere in the world, with access to the Internet.

E-mail enables an individual to send an electronic message--generally akin to a note or letter--to another individual or to a group of addressees. The message is generally
stored electronically, sometimes waiting for the recipient to
check her "mailbox" and sometimes making its receipt
known through some type of prompt. A mail exploder is
a sort of e-mail group. Subscribers can send messages to
a common e-mail address, which then forwards the message
to the group's other subscribers. Newsgroups also serve
groups of regular participants, but these postings may be
read by others as well. There are thousands of such groups,
each serving to foster an exchange of information or opinion on a particular topic running the gamut from, say, the
music of Wagner to Balkan politics to AIDS prevention to
the Chicago Bulls. About 100,000 new messages are posted
every day. In most newsgroups, postings are automatically
purged at regular intervals. In addition to posting a message that can be read later, two or more individuals wishing
to communicate more immediately can enter a chat room to
engage in real-time dialogue--in other words, by typing
messages to one another that appear almost immediately on

Opinion of the Court
the others' computer screens. The District Court foundthat at any given time "tens of thousands of users are engaging in conversations on a huge range of subjects." 6 It is "noexaggeration to conclude that the content on the Internet is
as diverse as human thought." 7The best known category of communication over the Internet is the World Wide Web, which allows users to searchfor and retrieve information stored in remote computers, as
well as, in some cases, to communicate back to designatedsites. In concrete terms, the Web consists of a vast number
of documents stored in different computers all over theworld. Some of these documents are simply files containing
information. However, more elaborate documents, com-monly known as Web "pages," are also prevalent. Each has
its own address--"rather like a telephone number." 8 Webpages frequently contain information and sometimes allow
the viewer to communicate with the page's (or "site's") au-thor. They generally also contain "links" to other documents created by that site's author or to other (generally)related sites. Typically, the links are either blue or underlined text--sometimes images.Navigating the Web is relatively straightforward. A user
may either type the address of a known page or enter one ormore keywords into a commercial "search engine" in an effort to locate sites on a subject of interest. A particularWeb page may contain the information sought by the
"surfer," or, through its links, it may be an avenue to otherdocuments located anywhere on the Internet. Users generally explore a given Web page, or move to another, by click-ing a computer "mouse" on one of the page's icons or links.
Access to most Web pages is freely available, but some allowaccess only to those who have purchased the right from a

Opinion of the Court
commercial provider. The Web is thus comparable, from thereaders' viewpoint, to both a vast library including millions

of readily available and indexed publications and a sprawlingmall offering goods and services.

From the publishers' point of view, it constitutes a vastplatform from which to address and hear from a worldwide
audience of millions of readers, viewers, researchers, andbuyers. Any person or organization with a computer connected to the Internet can "publish" information. Publish-ers include government agencies, educational institutions,
commercial entities, advocacy groups, and individuals.9Publishers may either make their material available to the
entire pool of Internet users, or confine access to a selectedgroup, such as those willing to pay for the privilege. "No
single organization controls any membership in the Web, noris there any single centralized point from which individual
Web sites or services can be blocked from the Web." 10
Sexually Explicit Material

Sexually explicit material on the Internet includes text,pictures, and chat and "extends from the modestly titillating

to the hardest-core." 11 These files are created, named, andposted in the same manner as material that is not sexually
explicit, and may be accessed either deliberately or uninten-tionally during the course of an imprecise search. "Once a
provider posts its content on the Internet, it cannot preventthat content from entering any community."

12 Thus, for

example,

Opinion of the Court
"when the UCR/California Museum of Photographyposts to its Web site nudes by Edward Weston and Robert Mapplethorpe to announce that its new exhibit willtravel to Baltimore and New York City, those images
are available not only in Los Angeles, Baltimore, andNew York City, but also in Cincinnati, Mobile, or
Beijing--wherever Internet users live. Similarly, thesafer sex instructions that Critical Path posts to its Web
site, written in street language so that the teenage re-ceiver can understand them, are available not just in
Philadelphia, but also in Provo and Prague." 13
Some of the communications over the Internet that originatein foreign countries are also sexually explicit.

14

Though such material is widely available, users seldom en-counter such content accidentally. "A document's title or a

description of the document will usually appear before thedocument itself . . . and in many cases the user will receive
detailed information about a site's content before he or sheneed take the step to access the document. Almost all sexually explicit images are preceded by warnings as to the con-tent."

15 For that reason, the "odds are slim" that a user

would enter a sexually explicit site by accident.16 Unlikecommunications received by radio or television, "the receipt

of information on the Internet requires a series of affirmativesteps more deliberate and directed than merely turning a
dial. A child requires some sophistication and some abilityto read to retrieve material and thereby to use the Internet unattended." 17Systems have been developed to help parents control the
material that may be available on a home computer with In13 Ibid. (finding 85).

ternet access. A system may either limit a computer's access to an approved list of sources that have been identified
as containing no adult material, it may block designated
inappropriate sites, or it may attempt to block messages
containing identifiable objectionable features. "Although
parental control software currently can screen for certain
suggestive words or for known sexually explicit sites, it
cannot now screen for sexually explicit images." 18 Nevertheless, the evidence indicates that "a reasonably effective
method by which parents can prevent their children from
accessing sexually explicit and other material which parents
may believe is inappropriate for their children will soon be
widely available." 19

Age Verification

The problem of age verification differs for different uses
of the Internet. The District Court categorically determined that there "is no effective way to determine the identity or the age of a user who is accessing material through
e-mail, mail exploders, newsgroups or chat rooms." 20 The
Government offered no evidence that there was a reliable
way to screen recipients and participants in such forums for

18 Id., at 842 (finding 72).
19 Ibid. (finding 73).
20 Id., at 845 (finding 90): "An e-mail address provides no authoritative

information about the addressee, who may use an e-mail `alias' or an anonymous remailer. There is also no universal or reliable listing of e-mail
addresses and corresponding names or telephone numbers, and any such
listing would be or rapidly become incomplete. For these reasons, there
is no reliable way in many instances for a sender to know if the e-mail
recipient is an adult or a minor. The difficulty of e-mail age verification
is compounded for mail exploders such as listservs, which automatically
send information to all e-mail addresses on a sender's list. Government
expert Dr. Olsen agreed that no current technology could give a speaker
assurance that only adults were listed in a particular mail exploder's mailing list."

Opinion of the Court
age. Moreover, even if it were technologically feasible to
block minors' access to newsgroups and chat rooms containing discussions of art, politics, or other subjects that potentially elicit "indecent" or "patently offensive" contributions,
it would not be possible to block their access to that material
and "still allow them access to the remaining content, even
if the overwhelming majority of that content was not
indecent." 21

Technology exists by which an operator of a Web site may
condition access on the verification of requested information
such as a credit card number or an adult password. Credit
card verification is only feasible, however, either in connection with a commercial transaction in which the card is used,
or by payment to a verification agency. Using credit card
possession as a surrogate for proof of age would impose costs
on noncommercial Web sites that would require many of
them to shut down. For that reason, at the time of the trial,
credit card verification was "effectively unavailable to a substantial number of Internet content providers." 929 F.
Supp., at 846 (finding 102). Moreover, the imposition of such
a requirement "would completely bar adults who do not have
a credit card and lack the resources to obtain one from accessing any blocked material." 22

Commercial pornographic sites that charge their users for
access have assigned them passwords as a method of age
verification. The record does not contain any evidence concerning the reliability of these technologies. Even if passwords are effective for commercial purveyors of indecent material, the District Court found that an adult password
requirement would impose significant burdens on noncommercial sites, both because they would discourage users from
accessing their sites and because the cost of creating and

Opinion of the Court
maintaining such screening systems would be "beyond theirreach."

23

In sum, the District Court found:

"Even if credit card verification or adult passwordverification were implemented, the Government presented no testimony as to how such systems could en-sure that the user of the password or credit card is in
fact over 18. The burdens imposed by credit card veri-fication and adult password verification systems make
them effectively unavailable to a substantial number ofInternet content providers." Ibid. (finding 107).

II
The Telecommunications Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104-104, 110Stat. 56, was an unusually important legislative enactment.

As stated on the first of its 103 pages, its primary purposewas to reduce regulation and encourage "the rapid deployment of new telecommunications technologies." The majorcomponents of the statute have nothing to do with the Internet; they were designed to promote competition in thelocal telephone service market, the multichannel video mar23 Id., at 847 (findings 104-106):
"At least some, if not almost all, non-commercial organizations, such as
the ACLU, Stop Prisoner Rape or Critical Path AIDS Project, regard
charging listeners to access their speech as contrary to their goals of making their materials available to a wide audience free of charge.. . . . .

"There is evidence suggesting that adult users, particularly casual Web
browsers, would be discouraged from retrieving information that required
use of a credit card or password. Andrew Anker testified that HotWired
has received many complaints from its members about HotWired's registration system, which requires only that a member supply a name, e-mail
address and self-created password. There is concern by commercial content providers that age verification requirements would decrease advertising and revenue because advertisers depend on a demonstration that the
sites are widely available and frequently visited."

ket, and the market for over-the-air broadcasting. The Act
includes seven Titles, six of which are the product of extensive committee hearings and the subject of discussion in Reports prepared by Committees of the Senate and the House
of Representatives. By contrast, Title V--known as the
"Communications Decency Act of 1996" (CDA)--contains
provisions that were either added in executive committee
after the hearings were concluded or as amendments offered
during floor debate on the legislation. An amendment offered in the Senate was the source of the two statutory provisions challenged in this case.24 They are informally de24 See Exon Amendment No. 1268, 141 Cong. Rec. 15536 (1995). See
also id., at 15505. This amendment, as revised, became $ 502 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, 110 Stat. 133, 47 U. S. C. $$ 223(a)-(e) (1994
ed., Supp. II). Some Members of the House of Representatives opposed
the Exon Amendment because they thought it "possible for our parents
now to child-proof the family computer with these products available in
the private sector." They also thought the Senate's approach would "involve the Federal Government spending vast sums of money trying to
define elusive terms that are going to lead to a flood of legal challenges
while our kids are unprotected." These Members offered an amendment
intended as a substitute for the Exon Amendment, but instead enacted as
an additional section of the Act entitled "Online Family Empowerment."
See 110 Stat. 137, 47 U. S. C. $ 230 (1994 ed., Supp. II); 141 Cong. Rec.
27881 (1995). No hearings were held on the provisions that became law.
See S. Rep. No. 104-23, p. 9 (1995). After the Senate adopted the Exon
Amendment, however, its Judiciary Committee did conduct a one-day
hearing on "Cyberporn and Children." In his opening statement at that
hearing, Senator Leahy observed:

"It really struck me in your opening statement when you mentioned,
Mr. Chairman, that it is the first ever hearing, and you are absolutely
right. And yet we had a major debate on the floor, passed legislation
overwhelmingly on a subject involving the Internet, legislation that could
dramatically change--some would say even wreak havoc--on the Internet.
The Senate went in willy-nilly, passed legislation, and never once had a
hearing, never once had a discussion other than an hour or so on the floor."

scribed as the "indecent transmission" provision and the"patently offensive display" provision.

25

The first, 47 U. S. C. $ 223(a) (1994 ed., Supp. II), prohibitsthe knowing transmission of obscene or indecent messages

to any recipient under 18 years of age. It provides in perti-nent part:

"(a) Whoever--"(1) in interstate or foreign communications--

. . . . .
"(B) by means of a telecommunicati ons deviceknowingly--

"(i) makes, creates, or solicits, and
"(ii) initiates the transmission of,
"any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image, orother communication which is obscene or indecent,

knowing that the recipient of the communication isunder 18 years of age, regardless of whether the maker
of such communication placed the call or initiated thecommunication;

. . . . .
"(2) knowingly permits any telecommunications facil-ity under his control to be used for any activity prohibited by paragraph (1) with the intent that it be used forsuch activity,
"shall be fined under Title 18, or imprisoned not morethan two years, or both."

The second provision, $ 223(d), prohibits the knowing send-ing or displaying of patently offensive messages in a manner
that is available to a person under 18 years of age. Itprovides:

25 Although the Government and the dissent break $ 223(d)(1) into two
separate "patently offensive" and "display" provisions, we follow the convention of both parties below, as well as the District Court's order and
opinion, in describing $ 223(d)(1) as one provision.

Opinion of the Court
"(d) Whoever--"(1) in interstate or foreig n communications

knowingly--"(A) uses an interactive computer service to send to
a specific person or persons under 18 years of age, or"(B) uses any interactive computer service to display
in a manner available to a person under 18 years of age,
"any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image, orother communication that, in context, depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by con-temporary community standards, sexual or excretory activities or organs, regardless of whether the user of suchservice placed the call or initiated the communication; or

The breadth of these prohibitions is qualified by two af-firmative defenses. See $ 223(e)(5).

were consolidated, and a three-judge District Court was con-vened pursuant to $ 561 of the CDA.

29 After an evidentiary

hearing, that court entered a preliminary injunction againstenforcement of both of the challenged provisions. Each of

the three judges wrote a separate opinion, but their judgment was unanimous.Chief Judge Sloviter doubted the strength of the Government's interest in regulating "the vast range of online mate-rial covered or potentially covered by the CDA," but acknowledged that the interest was "compelling" with respectto some of that material. 929 F. Supp., at 853. She concluded, nonetheless, that the statute "sweeps more broadlythan necessary and thereby chills the expression of adults"
and that the terms "patently offensive" and "indecent" were
"inherently vague." Id., at 854. She also determined thatthe affirmative defenses were not "technologically or economically feasible for most providers," specifically considering and rejecting an argument that providers could avoid
liability by "tagging" their material in a manner that
would allow potential readers to screen out unwanted transmissions. Id., at 856. Chief Judge Sloviter also rejectedthe Government's suggestion that the scope of the statute

could be narrowed by construing it to apply only to commercial pornographers. Id., at 854-855.Judge Buckwalter concluded that the word "indecent" in

$ 223(a)(1)(B) and the terms "patently offensive" and "in con-text" in $ 223(d)(1) were so vague that criminal enforcement
of either section would violate the "fundamental constitu-tional principle" of "simple fairness,"

id., at 861, and the specific protections of the First and Fifth Amendments, id., at
858. He found no statutory basis for the Government's argument that the challenged provisions would be applied only
to "pornographic" materials, noting that, unlike obscenity,
"indecency has not been defined to exclude works of serious
literary, artistic, political or scientific value." Id., at 863.

Opinion of the Court
Moreover, the Government's claim that the work must beconsidered patently offensive "in context" was itself vague

because the relevant context might "refer to, among otherthings, the nature of the communication as a whole, the time
of day it was conveyed, the medium used, the identity of thespeaker, or whether or not it is accompanied by appropriate
warnings." Id., at 864. He believed that the unique natureof the Internet aggravated the vagueness of the statute.
Id., at 865, n. 9.Judge Dalzell's review of "the special attributes of Internet communication" disclosed by the evidence convincedhim that the First Amendment denies Congress the power
to regulate the content of protected speech on the Internet.Id., at 867. His opinion explained at length why he believed
the CDA would abridge significant protected speech, par-ticularly by noncommercial speakers, while "[p]erversely,
commercial pornographers would remain relatively unaf-fected." Id., at 879. He construed our cases as requiring a
"medium-specific" approach to the analysis of the regulationof mass communication,

id., at 873, and concluded that theInternet--as "the most participatory form of mass speech

yet developed," id., at 883--is entitled to "the highest pro-tection from governmental intrusion," ibid.

30 See also 929 F. Supp., at 877: "Four related characteristics of Internet
communication have a transcendent importance to our shared holding that
the CDA is unconstitutional on its face. We explain these characteristics
in our Findings of fact above, and I only rehearse them briefly here.
First, the Internet presents very low barriers to entry. Second, these
barriers to entry are identical for both speakers and listeners. Third, as
a result of these low barriers, astoundingly diverse content is available on
the Internet. Fourth, the Internet provides significant access to all who
wish to speak in the medium, and even creates a relative parity among
speakers." According to Judge Dalzell, these characteristics and the rest
of the District Court's findings "lead to the conclusion that Congress may
not regulate indecency on the Internet at all." Ibid. Because appellees
do not press this argument before this Court, we do not consider it. Appellees also do not dispute that the Government generally has a compelling
interest in protecting minors from "indecent" and "patently offensive"
speech.

864 RENO v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION

Opinion of the Court
The judgment of the District Court enjoins the Govern-ment from enforcing the prohibitions in $ 223(a)(1)(B) insofar

as they relate to "indecent" communications, but expresslypreserves the Government's right to investigate and prosecute the obscenity or child pornography activities prohibitedtherein. The injunction against enforcement of $$ 223(d)(1)
and (2) is unqualified because those provisions contain noseparate reference to obscenity or child pornography.

The Government appealed under the CDA's special reviewprovisions, $ 561, 110 Stat. 142-143, and we noted probable
jurisdiction, see 519 U. S. 1025 (1996). In its appeal, theGovernment argues that the District Court erred in holding
that the CDA violated both the First Amendment because itis overbroad and the Fifth Amendment because it is vague.
While we discuss the vagueness of the CDA because of itsrelevance to the First Amendment overbreadth inquiry, we
conclude that the judgment should be affirmed withoutreaching the Fifth Amendment issue. We begin our analysis by reviewing the principal authorities on which the Gov-ernment relies. Then, after describing the overbreadth of
the CDA, we consider the Government's specific contentions,including its submission that we save portions of the statute
either by severance or by fashioning judicial limitations onthe scope of its coverage.

IV
In arguing for reversal, the Government contends that theCDA is plainly constitutional under three of our prior decisions: (1) Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U. S. 629 (1968); (2) FCCv. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U. S. 726 (1978); and (3) Renton
v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U. S. 41 (1986). A close lookat these cases, however, raises--rather than relieves--
doubts concerning the constitutionality of the CDA.In

Ginsberg, we upheld the constitutionality of a New Yorkstatute that prohibited selling to minors under 17 years of

age material that was considered obscene as to them even ifnot obscene as to adults. We rejected the defendant's broad

521US2 Unit: $U93 [11-20-99 16:42:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN

865Cite as: 521 U. S. 844 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
submission that "the scope of the constitutional freedom ofexpression secured to a citizen to read or see material concerned with sex cannot be made to depend on whether thecitizen is an adult or a minor." 390 U. S., at 636. In rejecting that contention, we relied not only on the State's inde-pendent interest in the well-being of its youth, but also on
our consistent recognition of the principle that "the parents'claim to authority in their own household to direct the rearing of their children is basic in the structure of our society." 31In four important respects, the statute upheld in

Ginsbergwas narrower than the CDA. First, we noted in Ginsberg

that "the prohibition against sales to minors does not barparents who so desire from purchasing the magazines for
their children." Id., at 639. Under the CDA, by contrast,neither the parents' consent--nor even their participation--
in the communication would avoid the application of the stat-ute.

32 Second, the New York statute applied only to commercial transactions, id., at 647, whereas the CDA containsno such limitation. Third, the New York statute cabined its

definition of material that is harmful to minors with the re-quirement that it be "utterly without redeeming social importance for minors." Id., at 646. The CDA fails to pro-vide us with any definition of the term "indecent" as used in

$ 223(a)(1) and, importantly, omits any requirement that the"patently offensive" material covered by $ 223(d) lack serious
literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. Fourth, theNew York statute defined a minor as a person under the age

31 390 U. S., at 639. We quoted from Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U. S.
158, 166 (1944): "It is cardinal with us that the custody, care and nurture
of the child reside first in the parents, whose primary function and freedom include preparation for obligations the state can neither supply nor
hinder."

32 Given the likelihood that many e-mail transmissions from an adult to

a minor are conversations between family members, it is therefore incorrect for the partial dissent to suggest that the provisions of the CDA, even
in this narrow area, "are no different from the law we sustained in Ginsberg." Post, at 892.

Opinion of the Court
of 17, whereas the CDA, in applying to all those under 18
years, includes an additional year of those nearest majority.

In Pacifica, we upheld a declaratory order of the Federal
Communications Commission, holding that the broadcast of
a recording of a 12-minute monologue entitled "Filthy
Words" that had previously been delivered to a live audience
"could have been the subject of administrative sanctions."
438 U. S., at 730 (internal quotation marks omitted). The
Commission had found that the repetitive use of certain
words referring to excretory or sexual activities or organs
"in an afternoon broadcast when children are in the audience
was patently offensive" and concluded that the monologue
was indecent "as broadcast." Id., at 735. The respondent
did not quarrel with the finding that the afternoon broadcast
was patently offensive, but contended that it was not "indecent" within the meaning of the relevant statutes because it
contained no prurient appeal. After rejecting respondent's
statutory arguments, we confronted its two constitutional
arguments: (1) that the Commission's construction of its
authority to ban indecent speech was so broad that its order
had to be set aside even if the broadcast at issue was unprotected; and (2) that since the recording was not obscene, the
First Amendment forbade any abridgment of the right to
broadcast it on the radio.

In the portion of the lead opinion not joined by Justices
Powell and Blackmun, the plurality stated that the First
Amendment does not prohibit all governmental regulation
that depends on the content of speech. Id., at 742-743. Accordingly, the availability of constitutional protection for a
vulgar and offensive monologue that was not obscene depended on the context of the broadcast. Id., at 744-748.
Relying on the premise that "of all forms of communication"
broadcasting had received the most limited First Amendment protection, id., at 748-749, the Court concluded that the
ease with which children may obtain access to broadcasts,

Opinion of the Court
"coupled with the concerns recognized in Ginsberg," justifiedspecial treatment of indecent broadcasting.

Id., at 749-750.
As with the New York statute at issue in Ginsberg, thereare significant differences between the order upheld in

Pacifica and the CDA. First, the order in Pacifica, issued by
an agency that had been regulating radio stations for dec-ades, targeted a specific broadcast that represented a rather

dramatic departure from traditional program content inorder to designate when--rather than whether--it would be
permissible to air such a program in that particular medium.The CDA's broad categorical prohibitions are not limited to
particular times and are not dependent on any evaluation
by an agency familiar with the unique characteristics of the
Internet. Second, unlike the CDA, the Commission's declaratory order was not punitive; we expressly refused to decide
whether the indecent broadcast "would justify a criminal
prosecution." 438 U. S., at 750. Finally, the Commission's
order applied to a medium which as a matter of history had
"received the most limited First Amendment protection,"
id., at 748, in large part because warnings could not adequately protect the listener from unexpected program content. The Internet, however, has no comparable history.
Moreover, the District Court found that the risk of encountering indecent material by accident is remote because a
series of affirmative steps is required to access specific
material.

In Renton, we upheld a zoning ordinance that kept adult
movie theaters out of residential neighborhoods. The ordinance was aimed, not at the content of the films shown in the
theaters, but rather at the "secondary effects"--such as
crime and deteriorating property values--that these theaters fostered: " `It is th[e] secondary effect which these
zoning ordinances attempt to avoid, not the dissemination
of "offensive" speech.' " 475 U. S., at 49 (quoting Young v.
American Mini Theatres, Inc., 427 U. S. 50, 71, n. 34 (1976)).
According to the Government, the CDA is constitutional be521US2 Unit: $U93 [11-20-99 16:42:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
cause it constitutes a sort of "cyberzoning" on the Internet.But the CDA applies broadly to the entire universe of cyberspace. And the purpose of the CDA is to protect childrenfrom the primary effects of "indecent" and "patently offensive" speech, rather than any "secondary" effect of suchspeech. Thus, the CDA is a content-based blanket restriction on speech, and, as such, cannot be "properly analyzed asa form of time, place, and manner regulation." 475 U. S., at
46. See also Boos v. Barry, 485 U. S. 312, 321 (1988) ("Regu-lations that focus on the direct impact of speech on its audience" are not properly analyzed under Renton); Forsyth
County v. Nationalist Movement, 505 U. S. 123, 134 (1992)("Listeners' reaction to speech is not a content-neutral basis

for regulation").These precedents, then, surely do not require us to uphold
the CDA and are fully consistent with the application of themost stringent review of its provisions.

In Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad, 420 U. S. 546,557 (1975), we observed that "[e]ach medium of expression

. . . may present its own problems." Thus, some of our caseshave recognized special justifications for regulation of the
broadcast media that are not applicable to other speakers,see Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U. S. 367 (1969);
FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U. S. 726 (1978). In thesecases, the Court relied on the history of extensive Government regulation of the broadcast medium, see, e. g., RedLion, 395 U. S., at 399-400; the scarcity of available frequencies at its inception, see, e. g., Turner Broadcasting System,
Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. 622, 637-638 (1994); and its "invasive"nature, see Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492

U. S. 115, 128 (1989).Those factors are not present in cyberspace. Neither
before nor after the enactment of the CDA have the vastdemocratic forums of the Internet been subject to the type

of government supervision and regulation that has attendedthe broadcast industry.

33 Moreover, the Internet is not as

"invasive" as radio or television. The District Court spe-cifically found that "[c]ommunications over the Internet do

not `invade' an individual's home or appear on one's computerscreen unbidden. Users seldom encounter content `by accident.' " 929 F. Supp., at 844 (finding 88). It also found that"[a]lmost all sexually explicit images are preceded by warnings as to the content," and cited testimony that " `odds areslim' that a user would come across a sexually explicit sight
by accident." Ibid.We distinguished

Pacifica in Sable, 492 U. S., at 128, onjust this basis. In
Sable, a company engaged in the businessof offering sexually oriented prerecorded telephone messages (popularly known as "dial-a-porn") challenged the con-stitutionality of an amendment to the Communications Act
of 1934 that imposed a blanket prohibition on indecent aswell as obscene interstate commercial telephone messages.
We held that the statute was constitutional insofar as it ap-plied to obscene messages but invalid as applied to indecent
messages. In attempting to justify the complete ban andcriminalization of indecent commercial telephone messages,
the Government relied on Pacifica, arguing that the ban wasnecessary to prevent children from gaining access to such
messages. We agreed that "there is a compelling interestin protecting the physical and psychological well-being of minors" which extended to shielding them from indecent mes-sages that are not obscene by adult standards, 492 U. S., at

33 Cf. Pacifica Foundation v. FCC, 556 F. 2d 9, 36 (CADC 1977) (Levanthal, J., dissenting), rev'd, FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U. S. 726
(1978). When Pacifica was decided, given that radio stations were allowed to operate only pursuant to federal license, and that Congress had
enacted legislation prohibiting licensees from broadcasting indecent
speech, there was a risk that members of the radio audience might infer
some sort of official or societal approval of whatever was heard over the
radio, see 556 F. 2d, at 37, n. 18. No such risk attends messages received
through the Internet, which is not supervised by any federal agency.

126, but distinguished our "emphatically narrow holding" inPacifica because it did not involve a complete ban and because it involved a different medium of communication, id.,at 127. We explained that "the dial-it medium requires the
listener to take affirmative steps to receive the communica-tion."

Id., at 127-128. "Placing a telephone call," we con-tinued, "is not the same as turning on a radio and being

taken by surprise by an indecent message." Id., at 128.Finally, unlike the conditions that prevailed when Congress first authorized regulation of the broadcast spectrum,the Internet can hardly be considered a "scarce" expressive
commodity. It provides relatively unlimited, low-cost capac-ity for communication of all kinds. The Government estimates that "[a]s many as 40 million people use the Internettoday, and that figure is expected to grow to 200 million by
1999." 34 This dynamic, multifaceted category of communi-cation includes not only traditional print and news services,
but also audio, video, and still images, as well as interactive,real-time dialogue. Through the use of chat rooms, any person with a phone line can become a town crier with a voicethat resonates farther than it could from any soapbox.
Through the use of Web pages, mail exploders, and news-groups, the same individual can become a pamphleteer. As
the District Court found, "the content on the Internet is asdiverse as human thought." 929 F. Supp., at 842 (finding
74). We agree with its conclusion that our cases provide nobasis for qualifying the level of First Amendment scrutiny
that should be applied to this medium.

of the CDA uses a different linguistic form. The first usesthe word "indecent," 47 U. S. C. $ 223(a) (1994 ed., Supp. II),

while the second speaks of material that "in context, depictsor describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards, sexual or excretory activities or organs," $ 223(d). Given the absence of a definitionof either term,

35 this difference in language will provoke

uncertainty among speakers about how the two standardsrelate to each other

36 and just what they mean.37 Could a

speaker confidently assume that a serious discussion aboutbirth control practices, homosexuality, the First Amendment

issues raised by the Appendix to our Pacifica opinion, orthe consequences of prison rape would not violate the CDA?
This uncertainty undermines the likelihood that the CDAhas been carefully tailored to the congressional goal of protecting minors from potentially harmful materials.

The vagueness of the CDA is a matter of special concern
for two reasons. First, the CDA is a content-based regulation of speech. The vagueness of such a regulation raises

35 "Indecent" does not benefit from any textual embellishment at all.
"Patently offensive" is qualified only to the extent that it involves "sexual
or excretory activities or organs" taken "in context" and "measured by
contemporary community standards."

36 See Gozlon-Peretz v. United States, 498 U. S. 395, 404 (1991) ("[W]here

Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits
it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion and exclusion" (internal quotation marks omitted)).

37 The statute does not indicate whether the "patently offensive" and

"indecent" determinations should be made with respect to minors or the
population as a whole. The Government asserts that the appropriate
standard is "what is suitable material for minors." Reply Brief for Appellants 18, n. 13 (citing Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U. S. 629, 633 (1968)).
But the Conferees expressly rejected amendments that would have imposed such a "harmful to minors" standard. See S. Conf. Rep. No. 104-230,
p. 189 (1996) (S. Conf. Rep.), 142 Cong. Rec. H1145, H1165-H1166 (Feb.
1, 1996). The Conferees also rejected amendments that would have limited the proscribed materials to those lacking redeeming value. See ibid.

special First Amendment concerns because of its obvious
chilling effect on free speech. See, e. g., Gentile v. State Bar
of Nev., 501 U. S. 1030, 1048-1051 (1991). Second, the CDA
is a criminal statute. In addition to the opprobrium and
stigma of a criminal conviction, the CDA threatens violators
with penalties including up to two years in prison for each
act of violation. The severity of criminal sanctions may well
cause speakers to remain silent rather than communicate
even arguably unlawful words, ideas, and images. See, e. g.,
Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 U. S. 479, 494 (1965). As a practical matter, this increased deterrent effect, coupled with the
"risk of discriminatory enforcement" of vague regulations,
poses greater First Amendment concerns than those implicated by the civil regulation reviewed in Denver Area Ed.
Telecommunications Consortium, Inc. v. FCC, 518 U. S.
727 (1996).

The Government argues that the statute is no more vague
than the obscenity standard this Court established in Miller
v. California, 413 U. S. 15 (1973). But that is not so. In
Miller, this Court reviewed a criminal conviction against a
commercial vendor who mailed brochures containing pictures
of sexually explicit activities to individuals who had not requested such materials. Id., at 18. Having struggled for
some time to establish a definition of obscenity, we set forth
in Miller the test for obscenity that controls to this day:

"(a) whether the average person, applying contemporary
community standards would find that the work, taken as
a whole, appeals to the prurient interest; (b) whether
the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive
way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable
state law; and (c) whether the work, taken as a whole,
lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific
value." Id., at 24 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).

Opinion of the Court
Because the CDA's "patently offensive" standard (and, weassume, arguendo, its synonymous "indecent" standard) is

one part of the three-prong Miller test, the Government rea-sons, it cannot be unconstitutionally vague.

The Government's assertion is incorrect as a matter offact. The second prong of the

Miller test--the purportedlyanalogous standard--contains a critical requirement that is

omitted from the CDA: that the proscribed material be "spe-cifically defined by the applicable state law." This requirement reduces the vagueness inherent in the open-ended term"patently offensive" as used in the CDA. Moreover, the
Miller definition is limited to "sexual conduct," whereas theCDA extends also to include (1) "excretory activities" as well
as (2) "organs" of both a sexual and excretory nature.The Government's reasoning is also flawed. Just because
a definition including three limitations is not vague, it doesnot follow that one of those limitations, standing by itself, is
not vague.38 Each of Miller's additional two prongs--(1)that, taken as a whole, the material appeal to the "prurient"
interest, and (2) that it "lac[k] serious literary, artistic, politi-cal, or scientific value"--critically limits the uncertain sweep
of the obscenity definition. The second requirement is par-ticularly important because, unlike the "patently offensive"
and "prurient interest" criteria, it is not judged by contem-porary community standards. See

Pope v. Illinois, 481 U. S.497, 500 (1987). This "societal value" requirement, absent

in the CDA, allows appellate courts to impose some limita-tions and regularity on the definition by setting, as a matter
of law, a national floor for socially redeeming value. TheGovernment's contention that courts will be able to give such
legal limitations to the CDA's standards is belied by Miller'sown rationale for having juries determine whether material

38 Even though the word "trunk," standing alone, might refer to luggage,
a swimming suit, the base of a tree, or the long nose of an animal, its
meaning is clear when it is one prong of a three-part description of a
species of gray animals.

is "patently offensive" according to community standards:that such questions are essentially ones of fact.

39

In contrast to Miller and our other previous cases, theCDA thus presents a greater threat of censoring speech that,

in fact, falls outside the statute's scope. Given the vaguecontours of the coverage of the statute, it unquestionably
silences some speakers whose messages would be entitledto constitutional protection. That danger provides further
reason for insisting that the statute not be overly broad.The CDA's burden on protected speech cannot be justified if
it could be avoided by a more carefully drafted statute.

VII
We are persuaded that the CDA lacks the precision thatthe First Amendment requires when a statute regulates the

content of speech. In order to deny minors access to poten-tially harmful speech, the CDA effectively suppresses a large
amount of speech that adults have a constitutional right toreceive and to address to one another. That burden on adult
speech is unacceptable if less restrictive alternatives wouldbe at least as effective in achieving the legitimate purpose
that the statute was enacted to serve.In evaluating the free speech rights of adults, we have
made it perfectly clear that "[s]exual expression which is in-decent but not obscene is protected by the First Amendment." Sable, 492 U. S., at 126. See also Carey v. Population Services Int'l, 431 U. S. 678, 701 (1977) ("[W]hereobscenity is not involved, we have consistently held that the

39 413 U. S., at 30 (Determinations of "what appeals to the `prurient interest' or is `patently offensive' . . . are essentially questions of fact, and
our Nation is simply too big and too diverse for this Court to reasonably
expect that such standards could be articulated for all 50 States in a single
formulation, even assuming the prerequisite consensus exists"). The
CDA, which implements the "contemporary community standards" language of Miller, thus conflicts with the Conferees' own assertion that the
CDA was intended "to establish a uniform national standard of content
regulation." S. Conf. Rep., at 191.

fact that protected speech may be offensive to some does notjustify its suppression"). Indeed, Pacifica itself admonished

that "the fact that society may find speech offensive is not asufficient reason for suppressing it." 438 U. S., at 745.

It is true that we have repeatedly recognized the govern-mental interest in protecting children from harmful materials. See Ginsberg, 390 U. S., at 639; Pacifica, 438 U. S., at749. But that interest does not justify an unnecessarily
broad suppression of speech addressed to adults. As wehave explained, the Government may not "reduc[e] the adult
population . . . to . . . only what is fit for children." Denver,518 U. S., at 759 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting
Sable, 492 U. S., at 128).40 "[R]egardless of the strength ofthe government's interest" in protecting children, "[t]he level
of discourse reaching a mailbox simply cannot be limited tothat which would be suitable for a sandbox."

Bolger v.
Youngs Drug Products Corp., 463 U. S. 60, 74-75 (1983).The District Court was correct to conclude that the CDA

effectively resembles the ban on "dial-a-porn" invalidated inSable. 929 F. Supp., at 854. In Sable, 492 U. S., at 129, this
Court rejected the argument that we should defer to thecongressional judgment that nothing less than a total ban
would be effective in preventing enterprising youngstersfrom gaining access to indecent communications.

Sable thusmade clear that the mere fact that a statutory regulation of

speech was enacted for the important purpose of protectingchildren from exposure to sexually explicit material does not
foreclose inquiry into its validity.41 As we pointed out last

40 Accord, Butler v. Michigan, 352 U. S. 380, 383 (1957) (ban on sale to
adults of books deemed harmful to children unconstitutional); Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U. S. 115, 128 (1989) (ban on "dial-aporn" messages unconstitutional); Bolger v. Youngs Drug Products Corp.,
463 U. S. 60, 73 (1983) (ban on mailing of unsolicited advertisement for
contraceptives unconstitutional).

41 The lack of legislative attention to the statute at issue in Sable suggests another parallel with this case. Compare 492 U. S., at 129-130

Opinion of the Court
Term, that inquiry embodies an "overarching commitment"to make sure that Congress has designed its statute to accomplish its purpose "without imposing an unnecessarilygreat restriction on speech." Denver, 518 U. S., at 741.

In arguing that the CDA does not so diminish adult com-munication, the Government relies on the incorrect factual
premise that prohibiting a transmission whenever it isknown that one of its recipients is a minor would not interfere with adult-to-adult communication. The findings of theDistrict Court make clear that this premise is untenable.
Given the size of the potential audience for most messages,in the absence of a viable age verification process, the sender
must be charged with knowing that one or more minors willlikely view it. Knowledge that, for instance, one or more
members of a 100-person chat group will be a minor--andtherefore that it would be a crime to send the group an indecent message--would surely burden communication amongadults.

42

The District Court found that at the time of trial existingtechnology did not include any effective method for a sender

to prevent minors from obtaining access to its communica-tions on the Internet without also denying access to adults.
The Court found no effective way to determine the age ofa user who is accessing material through e-mail, mail exploders, newsgroups, or chat rooms. 929 F. Supp., at 845(findings 90-94). As a practical matter, the Court also found

the bill, as well as similar assertions in hearings on a substantially identical bill the year before, . . . the congressional record presented to us contains no evidence as to how effective or ineffective the FCC's most recent
regulations were or might prove to be. . . . No Congressman or Senator
purported to present a considered judgment with respect to how often or
to what extent minors could or would circumvent the rules and have access to dial-a-porn messages" (footnote omitted)), with n. 24, supra.

42 The Government agrees that these provisions are applicable whenever

"a sender transmits a message to more than one recipient, knowing that
at least one of the specific persons receiving the message is a minor."

that it would be prohibitively expensive for noncommercial--
as well as some commercial--speakers who have Web sites to
verify that their users are adults. Id., at 845-848 (findings
95-116).43 These limitations must inevitably curtail a significant amount of adult communication on the Internet. By
contrast, the District Court found that "[d]espite its limitations, currently available user-based software suggests that
a reasonably effective method by which parents can prevent
their children from accessing sexually explicit and other material which parents may believe is inappropriate for their
children will soon be widely available." Id., at 842 (finding
73) (emphases added).

The breadth of the CDA's coverage is wholly unprecedented. Unlike the regulations upheld in Ginsberg and Pacifica, the scope of the CDA is not limited to commercial
speech or commercial entities. Its open-ended prohibitions
embrace all nonprofit entities and individuals posting indecent messages or displaying them on their own computers in
the presence of minors. The general, undefined terms "indecent" and "patently offensive" cover large amounts of nonpornographic material with serious educational or other
value.44 Moreover, the "community standards" criterion as
applied to the Internet means that any communication avail43 The Government asserts that "[t]here is nothing constitutionally suspect about requiring commercial Web site operators . . . to shoulder the
modest burdens associated with their use." Brief for Appellants 35. As
a matter of fact, however, there is no evidence that a "modest burden"
would be effective.

44 Transmitting obscenity and child pornography, whether via the Internet or other means, is already illegal under federal law for both adults
and juveniles. See 18 U. S. C. $$ 1464-1465 (criminalizing obscenity);

$ 2251 (criminalizing child pornography). In fact, when Congress was
considering the CDA, the Government expressed its view that the law
was unnecessary because existing laws already authorized its ongoing efforts to prosecute obscenity, child pornography, and child solicitation.
See 141 Cong. Rec. 16026 (1995) (letter from Kent Markus, Acting Assistant Attorney General, U. S. Department of Justice, to Sen. Leahy).

able to a nationwide audience will be judged by the standards of the community most likely to be offended by the message.45 The regulated subject matter includes any of the
seven "dirty words" used in the Pacifica monologue, the use
of which the Government's expert acknowledged could constitute a felony. See Olsen Testimony, Tr. Vol. V, 53:16-

54:10. It may also extend to discussions about prison rape
or safe sexual practices, artistic images that include nude
subjects, and arguably the card catalog of the Carnegie
Library.

For the purposes of our decision, we need neither accept
nor reject the Government's submission that the First
Amendment does not forbid a blanket prohibition on all "indecent" and "patently offensive" messages communicated to
a 17-year-old--no matter how much value the message may
contain and regardless of parental approval. It is at least
clear that the strength of the Government's interest in protecting minors is not equally strong throughout the coverage
of this broad statute. Under the CDA, a parent allowing
her 17-year-old to use the family computer to obtain information on the Internet that she, in her parental judgment,
deems appropriate could face a lengthy prison term. See 47
U. S. C. $ 223(a)(2) (1994 ed., Supp. II). Similarly, a parent
who sent his 17-year-old college freshman information on
birth control via e-mail could be incarcerated even though
neither he, his child, nor anyone in their home community
found the material "indecent" or "patently offensive," if the
college town's community thought otherwise.

45 Citing Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U. S. 520
(1993), among other cases, appellees offer an additional reason why, in
their view, the CDA fails strict scrutiny. Because so much sexually explicit content originates overseas, they argue, the CDA cannot be "effective." Brief for Appellees American Library Association et al. 33-34.
This argument raises difficult issues regarding the intended, as well as the
permissible scope of, extraterritorial application of the CDA. We find it
unnecessary to address those issues to dispose of this case.

Opinion of the Court
The breadth of this content-based restriction of speech im-poses an especially heavy burden on the Government to explain why a less restrictive provision would not be as effec-tive as the CDA. It has not done so. The arguments in
this Court have referred to possible alternatives such as re-quiring that indecent material be "tagged" in a way that
facilitates parental control of material coming into theirhomes, making exceptions for messages with artistic or educational value, providing some tolerance for parental choice,and regulating some portions of the Internet--such as commercial Web sites--differently from others, such as chatrooms. Particularly in the light of the absence of any detailed findings by the Congress, or even hearings addressingthe special problems of the CDA, we are persuaded that the
CDA is not narrowly tailored if that requirement has anymeaning at all.

VIII
In an attempt to curtail the CDA's facial overbreadth, theGovernment advances three additional arguments for sustaining the Act's affirmative prohibitions: (1) that the CDAis constitutional because it leaves open ample "alternative
channels" of communication; (2) that the plain meaning of theCDA's "knowledge" and "specific person" requirement significantly restricts its permissible applications; and (3) thatthe CDA's prohibitions are "almost always" limited to material lacking redeeming social value.The Government first contends that, even though the CDA
effectively censors discourse on many of the Internet's mo-dalities--such as chat groups, newsgroups, and mail exploders--it is nonetheless constitutional because it providesa "reasonable opportunity" for speakers to engage in the restricted speech on the World Wide Web. Brief for Appel-lants 39. This argument is unpersuasive because the CDA
regulates speech on the basis of its content. A "time, place,and manner" analysis is therefore inapplicable. See

Consol-idated Edison Co. of N. Y. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y.,

Opinion of the Court
447 U. S. 530, 536 (1980). It is thus immaterial whether suchspeech would be feasible on the Web (which, as the Government's own expert acknowledged, would cost up to $10,000 ifthe speaker's interests were not accommodated by an existing Web site, not including costs for data base management
and age verification). The Government's position is equiva-lent to arguing that a statute could ban leaflets on certain

subjects as long as individuals are free to publish books. Ininvalidating a number of laws that banned leafletting on the
streets regardless of their content, we explained that "one isnot to have the exercise of his liberty of expression in appropriate places abridged on the plea that it may be exercised
in some other place." Schneider v. State (Town of Irvington), 308 U. S. 147, 163 (1939).

The Government also asserts that the "knowledge" requirement of both $$ 223(a) and (d), especially when coupled
with the "specific child" element found in $ 223(d), saves the
CDA from overbreadth. Because both sections prohibit the
dissemination of indecent messages only to persons known
to be under 18, the Government argues, it does not require
transmitters to "refrain from communicating indecent material to adults; they need only refrain from disseminating such
materials to persons they know to be under 18." Brief for
Appellants 24. This argument ignores the fact that most
Internet forums--including chat rooms, newsgroups, mail
exploders, and the Web--are open to all comers. The Government's assertion that the knowledge requirement somehow protects the communications of adults is therefore untenable. Even the strongest reading of the "specific person"
requirement of $ 223(d) cannot save the statute. It would
confer broad powers of censorship, in the form of a "heckler's
veto," upon any opponent of indecent speech who might
simply log on and inform the would-be discoursers that his
17-year-old child--a "specific person . . . under 18 years of
age," 47 U. S. C. $ 223(d)(1)(A) (1994 ed., Supp. II)--would
be present.

Opinion of the Court
Finally, we find no textual support for the Government'ssubmission that material having scientific, educational, or

other redeeming social value will necessarily fall outside theCDA's "patently offensive" and "indecent" prohibitions. See
also n. 37, supra. IX

The Government's three remaining arguments focus on thedefenses provided in $ 223(e)(5).

46 First, relying on the

"good faith, reasonable, effective, and appropriate actions"provision, the Government suggests that "tagging" provides

a defense that saves the constitutionality of the CDA. Thesuggestion assumes that transmitters may encode their indecent communications in a way that would indicate their con-tents, thus permitting recipients to block their reception
with appropriate software. It is the requirement that thegood-faith action must be "effective" that makes this defense
illusory. The Government recognizes that its proposedscreening software does not currently exist. Even if it did,
there is no way to know whether a potential recipient willactually block the encoded material. Without the impossible knowledge that every guardian in America is screeningfor the "tag," the transmitter could not reasonably rely on
its action to be "effective."For its second and third arguments concerning defenses--
which we can consider together--the Government relies onthe latter half of $ 223(e)(5), which applies when the transmitter has restricted access by requiring use of a verified creditcard or adult identification. Such verification is not only
technologically available but actually is used by commercialproviders of sexually explicit material. These providers,
therefore, would be protected by the defense. Under thefindings of the District Court, however, it is not economically
feasible for most noncommercial speakers to employ suchverification. Accordingly, this defense would not signifi46 For the full text of $ 223(e)(5), see n. 26, supra.

Opinion of the Court
cantly narrow the statute's burden on noncommercial speech.Even with respect to the commercial pornographers that

would be protected by the defense, the Government failed toadduce any evidence that these verification techniques actually preclude minors from posing as adults.47 Given that therisk of criminal sanctions "hovers over each content provider, like the proverbial sword of Damocles," 48 the DistrictCourt correctly refused to rely on unproven future technology to save the statute. The Government thus failed toprove that the proffered defense would significantly reduce
the heavy burden on adult speech produced by the prohibi-tion on offensive displays.

We agree with the District Court's conclusion that theCDA places an unacceptably heavy burden on protected
speech, and that the defenses do not constitute the sort of"narrow tailoring" that will save an otherwise patently invalid unconstitutional provision. In Sable, 492 U. S., at 127,we remarked that the speech restriction at issue there
amounted to " `burn[ing] the house to roast the pig.' " TheCDA, casting a far darker shadow over free speech, threatens to torch a large segment of the Internet community.

X
At oral argument, the Government relied heavily on itsultimate fall-back position: If this Court should conclude that

the CDA is insufficiently tailored, it urged, we should savethe statute's constitutionality by honoring the severability clause, see 47 U. S. C. $ 608, and construing nonsever-able terms narrowly. In only one respect is this argument
acceptable.A severability clause requires textual provisions that can
be severed. We will follow $ 608's guidance by leaving con47 Thus, ironically, this defense may significantly protect commercial purveyors of obscene postings while providing little (or no) benefit for transmitters of indecent messages that have significant social or artistic value.

Opinion of the Court
stitutional textual elements of the statute intact in the oneplace where they are, in fact, severable. The "indecency"

provision, 47 U. S. C. $ 223(a) (1994 ed., Supp. II), applies to"any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image, or other
communication which is obscene or indecent." (Emphasis
added.) Appellees do not challenge the application of thestatute to obscene speech, which, they acknowledge, can be

banned totally because it enjoys no First Amendment pro-tection. See

Miller, 413 U. S., at 18. As set forth by the
statute, the restriction of "obscene" material enjoys a textualmanifestation separate from that for "indecent" material,

which we have held unconstitutional. Therefore, we will
sever the term "or indecent" from the statute, leaving the
rest of $ 223(a) standing. In no other respect, however, can

$ 223(a) or $ 223(d) be saved by such a textual surgery.

The Government also draws on an additional, less traditional aspect of the CDA's severability clause, 47 U. S. C.

$ 608, which asks any reviewing court that holds the statute
facially unconstitutional not to invalidate the CDA in application to "other persons or circumstances" that might be
constitutionally permissible. It further invokes this Court's
admonition that, absent "countervailing considerations," a
statute should "be declared invalid to the extent it reaches
too far, but otherwise left intact." Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472 U. S. 491, 503-504 (1985). There are two
flaws in this argument.

First, the statute that grants our jurisdiction for this expedited review, $ 561 of the Telecommunications Act of 1961,
note following 47 U. S. C. $ 223 (1994 ed., Supp. II), limits
that jurisdictional grant to actions challenging the CDA "on
its face." Consistent with $ 561, the plaintiffs who brought
this suit and the three-judge panel that decided it treated it
as a facial challenge. We have no authority, in this particular posture, to convert this litigation into an "as-applied"
challenge. Nor, given the vast array of plaintiffs, the range
of their expressive activities, and the vagueness of the stat521US2 Unit: $U93 [11-20-99 16:42:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN
884 RENO v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION

Opinion of the Court
ute, would it be practicable to limit our holding to a judiciallydefined set of specific applications.

Second, one of the "countervailing considerations" men-tioned in Brockett is present here. In considering a facial
challenge, this Court may impose a limiting construction ona statute only if it is "readily susceptible" to such a construction. Virginia v. American Booksellers Assn., Inc., 484U. S. 383, 397 (1988). See also

Erznoznik v. Jacksonville,422 U. S. 205, 216 (1975) ("readily subject" to narrowing construction). The open-ended character of the CDA providesno guidance whatever for limiting its coverage.

This case is therefore unlike those in which we have construed a statute narrowly because the text or other sourceof congressional intent identified a clear line that this Court

could draw. Cf., e. g., Brockett, 472 U. S., at 504-505 (invali-dating obscenity statute only to the extent that word "lust"
was actually or effectively excised from statute); United
States v. Grace, 461 U. S. 171, 180-183 (1983) (invalidating
federal statute banning expressive displays only insofar as itextended to public sidewalks when clear line could be drawn

between sidewalks and other grounds that comported with
congressional purpose of protecting the building, grounds,and people therein). Rather, our decision in

United States
v. Treasury Employees, 513 U. S. 454, 479, n. 26 (1995), isapplicable. In that case, we declined to "dra[w] one or more

lines between categories of speech covered by an overlybroad statute, when Congress has sent inconsistent signals
as to where the new line or lines should be drawn" becausedoing so "involves a far more serious invasion of the legislative domain." 49 This Court "will not rewrite a . . . law

49 As this Court long ago explained: "It would certainly be dangerous if
the legislature could set a net large enough to catch all possible offenders,
and leave it to the courts to step inside and say who could be rightfully
detained, and who should be set at large. This would, to some extent,
substitute the judicial for the legislative department of the government."

XI
In this Court, though not in the District Court, the Government asserts that--in addition to its interest in protecting children--its "[e]qually significant" interest in fostering
the growth of the Internet provides an independent basis
for upholding the constitutionality of the CDA. Brief for
Appellants 19. The Government apparently assumes that
the unregulated availability of "indecent" and "patently offensive" material on the Internet is driving countless citizens
away from the medium because of the risk of exposing themselves or their children to harmful material.

We find this argument singularly unpersuasive. The dramatic expansion of this new marketplace of ideas contradicts
the factual basis of this contention. The record demonstrates that the growth of the Internet has been and continues to be phenomenal. As a matter of constitutional tradition, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, we presume
that governmental regulation of the content of speech is
more likely to interfere with the free exchange of ideas than
to encourage it. The interest in encouraging freedom of expression in a democratic society outweighs any theoretical
but unproven benefit of censorship.

For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District
Court is affirmed.

It is so ordered.

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
Justice O'Connor, with whom The Chief Justicejoins, concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in

part.

I write separately to explain why I view the Communica-tions Decency Act of 1996 (CDA) as little more than an attempt by Congress to create "adult zones" on the Internet.Our precedent indicates that the creation of such zones can
be constitutionally sound. Despite the soundness of its pur-pose, however, portions of the CDA are unconstitutional
because they stray from the blueprint our prior cases havedeveloped for constructing a "zoning law" that passes constitutional muster.Appellees bring a facial challenge to three provisions of
the CDA. The first, which the Court describes as the "inde-cency transmission" provision, makes it a crime to knowingly
transmit an obscene or indecent message or image to a per-son the sender knows is under 18 years old. 47 U. S. C.

$ 223(a)(1)(B) (1994 ed., Supp. II). What the Court classifiesas a single " `patently offensive display' " provision, see

ante,at 859, is in reality two separate provisions. The first of

these makes it a crime to knowingly send a patently offensive message or image to a specific person under the age of18 ("specific person" provision). $ 223(d)(1)(A). The second

criminalizes the display of patently offensive messages or im-ages "in a[ny] manner available" to minors ("display" provision). $ 223(d)(1)(B). None of these provisions purports tokeep indecent (or patently offensive) material away from
adults, who have a First Amendment right to obtain thisspeech.

Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492
U. S. 115, 126 (1989) ("Sexual expression which is indecent
but not obscene is protected by the First Amendment").Thus, the undeniable purpose of the CDA is to segregate

indecent material on the Internet into certain areas that mi-nors cannot access. See S. Conf. Rep. No. 104-230, p. 189
(1996) (CDA imposes "access restrictions . . . to protect mi-nors from exposure to indecent material").

888 RENO v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
The Court has previously sustained such zoning laws, butonly if they respect the First Amendment rights of adults

and minors. That is to say, a zoning law is valid if (i) itdoes not unduly restrict adult access to the material; and (ii)
minors have no First Amendment right to read or view thebanned material. As applied to the Internet as it exists in
1997, the "display" provision and some applications of the"indecency transmission" and "specific person" provisions
fail to adhere to the first of these limiting principles by re-stricting adults' access to protected materials in certain circumstances. Unlike the Court, however, I would invalidatethe provisions only in those circumstances.

I
Our cases make clear that a "zoning" law is valid only ifadults are still able to obtain the regulated speech. If they

cannot, the law does more than simply keep children awayfrom speech they have no right to obtain--it interferes with
the rights of adults to obtain constitutionally protectedspeech and effectively "reduce[s] the adult population . . . to
reading only what is fit for children." Butler v. Michigan,352 U. S. 380, 383 (1957). The First Amendment does not
tolerate such interference. See ibid. (striking down a MichiMd. Ann. Code, Art. 27, $ 416B (1996); Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 272, $ 28

supra (invalidating federal law that made it a crime to transmit indecent, but nonobscene, commercial telephone messages to minors and adults); Bolger v. Youngs Drug Products
Corp., 463 U. S. 60, 74 (1983) (striking down a federal law
prohibiting the mailing of unsolicited advertisements for con-traceptives). If the law does not unduly restrict adults' access to constitutionally protected speech, however, it may bevalid. In

Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U. S. 629, 634 (1968),
for example, the Court sustained a New York law that barred
store owners from selling pornographic magazines to minors
in part because adults could still buy those magazines.

The Court in Ginsberg concluded that the New York law
created a constitutionally adequate adult zone simply because, on its face, it denied access only to minors. The Court
did not question--and therefore necessarily assumed--that
an adult zone, once created, would succeed in preserving
adults' access while denying minors' access to the regulated
speech. Before today, there was no reason to question this
assumption, for the Court has previously only considered
laws that operated in the physical world, a world that with
two characteristics that make it possible to create "adult
zones": geography and identity. See Lessig, Reading the
Constitution in Cyberspace, 45 Emory L. J. 869, 886 (1996).
A minor can see an adult dance show only if he enters
an establishment that provides such entertainment. And
should he attempt to do so, the minor will not be able to
conceal completely his identity (or, consequently, his age).
Thus, the twin characteristics of geography and identity enable the establishment's proprietor to prevent children from
entering the establishment, but to let adults inside.

The electronic world is fundamentally different. Because
it is no more than the interconnection of electronic pathways,
cyberspace allows speakers and listeners to mask their iden521US2 Unit: $U93 [11-20-99 16:42:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
tities. Cyberspace undeniably reflects some form of geography; chat rooms and Web sites, for example, exist at fixed
"locations" on the Internet. Since users can transmit and
receive messages on the Internet without revealing anything
about their identities or ages, see id., at 901, however, it is
not currently possible to exclude persons from accessing certain messages on the basis of their identity.

Cyberspace differs from the physical world in another
basic way: Cyberspace is malleable. Thus, it is possible to
construct barriers in cyberspace and use them to screen for
identity, making cyberspace more like the physical world
and, consequently, more amenable to zoning laws. This
transformation of cyberspace is already underway. Id., at
888-889; id., at 887 (cyberspace "is moving . . . from a relatively unzoned place to a universe that is extraordinarily well
zoned"). Internet speakers (users who post material on the
Internet) have begun to zone cyberspace itself through the
use of "gateway" technology. Such technology requires Internet users to enter information about themselves--perhaps an adult identification number or a credit card number--before they can access certain areas of cyberspace, 929
F. Supp. 824, 845 (ED Pa. 1996), much like a bouncer checks a
person's driver's license before admitting him to a nightclub.
Internet users who access information have not attempted
to zone cyberspace itself, but have tried to limit their own
power to access information in cyberspace, much as a parent
controls what her children watch on television by installing
a lock box. This user-based zoning is accomplished through
the use of screening software (such as Cyber Patrol or SurfWatch) or browsers with screening capabilities, both of
which search addresses and text for keywords that are associated with "adult" sites and, if the user wishes, blocks access
to such sites. Id., at 839-842. The Platform for Internet
Content Selection project is designed to facilitate user-based
zoning by encouraging Internet speakers to rate the content

of their speech using codes recognized by all screening pro-grams.

Id., at 838-839.
Despite this progress, the transformation of cyberspace isnot complete. Although gateway technology has been available on the World Wide Web for some time now, id., at 845;
Shea v. Reno, 930 F. Supp. 916, 933-934 (SDNY 1996), it isnot available to

all Web speakers, 929 F. Supp., at 845-846,
and is just now becoming technologically feasible for chatrooms and USENET newsgroups, Brief for Appellants 37-

38. Gateway technology is not ubiquitous in cyberspace,and because without it "there is no means of age verification," cyberspace still remains largely unzoned--and unzoneable. 929 F. Supp., at 846; Shea, supra, at 934. Userbased zoning is also in its infancy. For it to be effective,
(i) an agreed-upon code (or "tag") would have to exist; (ii)
screening software or browsers with screening capabilities
would have to be able to recognize the "tag"; and (iii) those
programs would have to be widely available--and widely
used--by Internet users. At present, none of these conditions is true. Screening software "is not in wide use today"
and "only a handful of browsers have screening capabilities."
Shea, supra, at 945-946. There is, moreover, no agreedupon "tag" for those programs to recognize. 929 F. Supp.,
at 848; Shea, supra, at 945.

Although the prospects for the eventual zoning of the Internet appear promising, I agree with the Court that we
must evaluate the constitutionality of the CDA as it applies
to the Internet as it exists today. Ante, at 881. Given the
present state of cyberspace, I agree with the Court that the
"display" provision cannot pass muster. Until gateway
technology is available throughout cyberspace, and it is not
in 1997, a speaker cannot be reasonably assured that the
speech he displays will reach only adults because it is impossible to confine speech to an "adult zone." Thus, the only
way for a speaker to avoid liability under the CDA is to
refrain completely from using indecent speech. But this

purposes, "reduce[s] the adult population [on the Internet] toreading only what is fit for children."

383. As a result, the "display" provision cannot withstand
scrutiny. Accord, Sable Communications, 492 U. S., at 126-131;

Bolger v. Youngs Drug Products Corp., 463 U. S., at
73-75.The "indecency transmission" and "specific person" provisions present a closer issue, for they are not unconstitutionalin all of their applications. As discussed above, the "indecency transmission" provision makes it a crime to transmit
knowingly an indecent message to a person the sender
knows is under 18 years of age. 47 U. S. C. $ 223(a)(1)(B)
(1994 ed., Supp. II). The "specific person" provision proscribes the same conduct, although it does not as explicitly
require the sender to know that the intended recipient of his
indecent message is a minor. $ 223(d)(1)(A). The Government urges the Court to construe the provision to impose
such a knowledge requirement, see Brief for Appellants 25-
27, and I would do so. See Edward J. DeBartolo Corp.
v. Florida Gulf Coast Building & Constr. Trades Council,
485 U. S. 568, 575 (1988) ("[W]here an otherwise acceptable
construction of a statute would raise serious constitutional
problems, the Court will construe the statute to avoid such
problems unless such construction is plainly contrary to the
intent of Congress").

So construed, both provisions are constitutional as applied
to a conversation involving only an adult and one or more
minors--e. g., when an adult speaker sends an e-mail knowing the addressee is a minor, or when an adult and minor
converse by themselves or with other minors in a chat room.
In this context, these provisions are no different from the
law we sustained in Ginsberg. Restricting what the adult
may say to the minors in no way restricts the adult's ability
to communicate with other adults. He is not prevented from

speaking indecently to other adults in a chat room (becausethere are no other adults participating in the conversation)

and he remains free to send indecent e-mails to other adults.The relevant universe contains only one adult, and the adult
in that universe has the power to refrain from using indecent
speech and consequently to keep all such speech within theroom in an "adult" zone.

The analogy to Ginsberg breaks down, however, whenmore than one adult is a party to the conversation. If a
minor enters a chat room otherwise occupied by adults, theCDA effectively requires the adults in the room to stop using
indecent speech. If they did not, they could be prosecuted
under the "indecency transmission" and "specific person"
provisions for any indecent statements they make to the
group, since they would be transmitting an indecent message
to specific persons, one of whom is a minor. Accord, ante,
at 876. The CDA is therefore akin to a law that makes it a
crime for a bookstore owner to sell pornographic magazines
to anyone once a minor enters his store. Even assuming
such a law might be constitutional in the physical world as a
reasonable alternative to excluding minors completely from
the store, the absence of any means of excluding minors from
chat rooms in cyberspace restricts the rights of adults to
engage in indecent speech in those rooms. The "indecency
transmission" and "specific person" provisions share this
defect.

But these two provisions do not infringe on adults' speech
in all situations. And as discussed below, I do not find that
the provisions are overbroad in the sense that they restrict
minors' access to a substantial amount of speech that minors
have the right to read and view. Accordingly, the CDA can
be applied constitutionally in some situations. Normally,
this fact would require the Court to reject a direct facial
challenge. United States v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 745
(1987) ("A facial challenge to a legislative Act [succeeds only
if] the challenger . . . establish[es] that no set of circum521US2 Unit: $U93 [11-20-99 16:42:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
stances exists under which the Act would be valid"). Appel-lees' claim arises under the First Amendment, however, and

they argue that the CDA is facially invalid because it is "sub-stantially overbroad"--that is, it "sweeps too broadly . . .
[and] penaliz[es] a substantial amount of speech that is constitutionally protected," Forsyth County v. Nationalist Movement, 505 U. S. 123, 130 (1992). See Brief for Appellees
American Library Association et al. 48; Brief for AppelleesAmerican Civil Liberties Union et al. 39-41. I agree with

the Court that the provisions are overbroad in that theycover any and all communications between adults and minors, regardless of how many adults might be part of the
audience to the communication.

This conclusion does not end the matter, however.
Where, as here, "the parties challenging the statute are
those who desire to engage in protected speech that the
overbroad statute purports to punish, . . . [t]he statute may
forthwith be declared invalid to the extent that it reaches
too far, but otherwise left intact." Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472 U. S. 491, 504 (1985). There is no question
that Congress intended to prohibit certain communications
between one adult and one or more minors. See 47 U. S. C.

$ 223(a)(1)(B) (1994 ed., Supp. II) (punishing "[w]hoever . . .
initiates the transmission of [any indecent communication]
knowing that the recipient of the communication is under 18
years of age"); $ 223(d)(1)(A) (punishing "[w]hoever . . .
send[s] to a specific person or persons under 18 years of age
[a patently offensive message]"). There is also no question
that Congress would have enacted a narrower version of
these provisions had it known a broader version would be
declared unconstitutional. 47 U. S. C. $ 608 ("If . . . the application [of any provision of the CDA] to any person or circumstance is held invalid, . . . the application of such provision
to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected
thereby"). I would therefore sustain the "indecency transmission" and "specific person" provisions to the extent they

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
apply to the transmission of Internet communications wherethe party initiating the communication knows that all of the

recipients are minors. II

Whether the CDA substantially interferes with the FirstAmendment rights of minors, and thereby runs afoul of the
second characteristic of valid zoning laws, presents a closerquestion. In Ginsberg, the New York law we sustained prohibited the sale to minors of magazines that were "harmfulto minors." Under that law, a magazine was "harmful to
minors" only if it was obscene as to minors. 390 U. S., at632-633. Noting that obscene speech is not protected by
the First Amendment, Roth v. United States, 354 U. S. 476,485 (1957), and that New York was constitutionally free to
adjust the definition of obscenity for minors, 390 U. S., at 638,the Court concluded that the law did not "invad[e] the area
of freedom of expression constitutionally secured to minors,"id., at 637. New York therefore did not infringe upon the
First Amendment rights of minors. Cf. Erznoznik v. Jack-sonville, 422 U. S. 205, 213 (1975) (striking down city ordinance that banned nudity that was not "obscene even as tominors").

The Court neither "accept[s] nor reject[s]" the argumentthat the CDA is facially overbroad because it substantially
interferes with the First Amendment rights of minors.
Ante, at 878. I would reject it. Ginsberg established thatminors may constitutionally be denied access to material that

is obscene as to minors. As Ginsberg explained, material isobscene as to minors if it (i) is "patently offensive to prevailing standards in the adult community as a whole with re-spect to what is suitable . . . for minors"; (ii) appeals to the
prurient interest of minors; and (iii) is "utterly without re-deeming social importance for minors." 390 U. S., at 633.
Because the CDA denies minors the right to obtain materialthat is "patently offensive"--even if it has some redeeming
value for minors and even if it does not appeal to their pruri521US2 Unit: $U93 [11-20-99 16:42:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN
896 RENO v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
ent interests--Congress' rejection of the Ginsberg "harmfulto minors" standard means that the CDA could ban some

speech that is "indecent" (i. e., "patently offensive") but thatis not obscene as to minors.

I do not deny this possibility, but to prevail in a facial challenge, it is not enough for a plaintiff to show "some" over-breadth. Our cases require a proof of "real" and "substantial" overbreadth, Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U. S. 601, 615(1973), and appellees have not carried their burden in this
case. In my view, the universe of speech constitutionallyprotected as to minors but banned by the CDA--

i. e., the
universe of material that is "patently offensive," but which
nonetheless has some redeeming value for minors or does
not appeal to their prurient interest--is a very small one.
Appellees cite no examples of speech falling within this universe and do not attempt to explain why that universe is
substantial "in relation to the statute's plainly legitimate
sweep." Ibid. That the CDA might deny minors the right
to obtain material that has some "value," see ante, at 878, is
largely beside the point. While discussions about prison
rape or nude art, see ibid., may have some redeeming educational value for adults, they do not necessarily have any such
value for minors, and under Ginsberg, minors only have a
First Amendment right to obtain patently offensive material
that has "redeeming social importance for minors," 390 U. S.,
at 633 (emphasis added). There is also no evidence in the
record to support the contention that "many e-mail transmissions from an adult to a minor are conversations between
family members," ante, at 865, n. 32, and no support for the
legal proposition that such speech is absolutely immune from
regulation. Accordingly, in my view, the CDA does not burden a substantial amount of minors' constitutionally protected speech.

Thus, the constitutionality of the CDA as a zoning law
hinges on the extent to which it substantially interferes with
the First Amendment rights of adults. Because the rights

of adults are infringed only by the "display" provision andby the "indecency transmission" and "specific person" provisions as applied to communications involving more than oneadult, I would invalidate the CDA only to that extent. Insofar as the "indecency transmission" and "specific person"provisions prohibit the use of indecent speech in communications between an adult and one or more minors, however,they can and should be sustained. The Court reaches a contrary conclusion, and from that holding I respectfully dissent.

v. UNITED STATES

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 95-1478. Argued December 3, 1996--Decided June 27, 1997*
Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act provisions require the Attorney

General to establish a national system for instantly checking prospective
handgun purchasers' backgrounds, note following 18 U. S. C. $ 922, and
command the "chief law enforcement officer" (CLEO) of each local jurisdiction to conduct such checks and perform related tasks on an interim
basis until the national system becomes operative, $ 922(s). Petitioners,
the CLEOs for counties in Montana and Arizona, filed separate actions
challenging the interim provisions' constitutionality. In each case, the
District Court held that the background-check provision was unconstitutional, but concluded that it was severable from the remainder of the
Act, effectively leaving a voluntary background-check system in place.
The Ninth Circuit reversed, finding none of the interim provisions
unconstitutional.

Held:

1. The Brady Act's interim provision commanding CLEOs to conduct
background checks, $ 922(s)(2), is unconstitutional. Extinguished with
it is the duty implicit in the background-check requirement that the
CLEO accept completed handgun-applicant statements (Brady Forms)
from firearms dealers, $$ 922(s)(1)(A)(i)(III) and (IV). Pp. 904-933.

(a) Because there is no constitutional text speaking to the precise question whether congressional action compelling state officers to
execute federal laws is unconstitutional, the answer to the CLEOs'
challenge must be sought in historical understanding and practice,

in the Constitution's structure, and in this Court's jurisprudence.
Pp. 904-905.

(b) Relevant constitutional practice tends to negate the existence
of the congressional power asserted here, but is not conclusive. Enactments of the early Congresses seem to contain no evidence of an
assumption that the Federal Government may command the States' executive power in the absence of a particularized constitutional authorization. The early enactments establish, at most, that the Constitution

*Together with No. 95-1503, Mack v. United States, also on certiorari
to the same court.

Syllabus
was originally understood to permit imposition of an obligation on state
judges to enforce federal prescriptions related to matters appropriate
for the judicial power. The Government misplaces its reliance on portions of The Federalist suggesting that federal responsibilities could be
imposed on state officers. None of these statements necessarily implies--what is the critical point here--that Congress could impose these
responsibilities without the States' consent. They appear to rest on
the natural assumption that the States would consent, see FERC v.
Mississippi, 456 U. S. 742, 796, n. 35 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment and dissenting in part). Finally, there is an absence of executivecommandeering federal statutes in the country's later history, at least
until very recent years. Even assuming that newer laws represent an
assertion of the congressional power challenged here, they are of such
recent vintage that they are not probative of a constitutional tradition.
Pp. 905-918.

(c) The Constitution's structure reveals a principle that controls
these cases: the system of "dual sovereignty." See, e. g., Gregory v.
Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 457. Although the States surrendered many of
their powers to the new Federal Government, they retained a residuary
and inviolable sovereignty that is reflected throughout the Constitution's text. See, e. g., Lane County v. Oregon, 7 Wall. 71, 76. The
Framers rejected the concept of a central government that would act
upon and through the States, and instead designed a system in which
the State and Federal Governments would exercise concurrent authority over the people. The Federal Government's power would be augmented immeasurably and impermissibly if it were able to impress
into its service--and at no cost to itself--the police officers of the 50
States. Pp. 918-922.

(d) Federal control of state officers would also have an effect upon
the separation and equilibration of powers between the three branches
of the Federal Government itself. The Brady Act effectively transfers
the President's responsibility to administer the laws enacted by Congress, Art. II, $$ 2 and 3, to thousands of CLEOs in the 50 States, who
are left to implement the program without meaningful Presidential control. The Federal Executive's unity would be shattered, and the power
of the President would be subject to reduction, if Congress could simply
require state officers to execute its laws. Pp. 922-923.

(e) Contrary to the contention of Justice Stevens' dissent, the
Brady Act's direction of the actions of state executive officials is not
constitutionally valid under Art. I, $ 8, as a law "necessary and proper"
to the execution of Congress's Commerce Clause power to regulate
handgun sales. Where, as here, a law violates the state sovereignty
principle, it is not a law "proper for carrying into Execution" delegated

Syllabus
powers within the Necessary and Proper Clause's meaning. Cf. New
York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144, 166. The Supremacy Clause does
not help the dissent, since it makes "Law of the Land" only "Laws of the
United States which shall be made in Pursuance [of the Constitution]."
Art. VI, cl. 2. Pp. 923-925.

(f) Finally, and most conclusively in these cases, the Court's jurisprudence makes clear that the Federal Government may not compel the
States to enact or administer a federal regulatory program. See, e. g.,
New York, supra, at 188. The attempts of the Government and Justice Stevens' dissent to distinguish New York--on grounds that the
Brady Act's background-check provision does not require state legislative or executive officials to make policy; that requiring state officers to
perform discrete, ministerial federal tasks does not diminish the state
or federal officials' accountability; and that the Brady Act is addressed
to individual CLEOs while the provisions invalidated in New York were
directed to the State itself--are not persuasive. A "balancing" analysis
is inappropriate here, since the whole object of the law is to direct the
functioning of the state executive, and hence to compromise the structural framework of dual sovereignty; it is the very principle of separate
state sovereignty that such a law offends. See, e. g., New York, supra,
at 187. Pp. 925-933.

2. With the Act's background-check and implicit receipt-of-forms requirements invalidated, the Brady Act requirements that CLEOs destroy all Brady Forms and related records, $ 922(s)(6)(B)(i), and give
would-be purchasers written statements of the reasons for determining
their ineligibility to receive handguns, $ 922(s)(6)(C), require no action
whatsoever on the part of CLEOs such as petitioners, who are not voluntary participants in administration of the federal scheme. As to
them, these provisions are not unconstitutional, but simply inoperative.
Pp. 933-934.

3. The Court declines to address the severability question briefed and
argued by the parties: whether firearms dealers remain obliged to forward Brady Forms to CLEOs, $$ 922(s)(1)(A)(i)(III) and (IV), and to
wait five business days thereafter before consummating a firearms sale,

$ 922(s)(1)(A)(ii). These provisions burden only dealers and firearms
purchasers, and no plaintiff in either of those categories is before the
Court. P. 935.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.
The question presented in these cases is whether certaininterim provisions of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, Pub. L. 103-159, 107 Stat. 1536, commanding stateand local law enforcement officers to conduct background
checks on prospective handgun purchasers and to performcertain related tasks, violate the Constitution.

I
The Gun Control Act of 1968 (GCA), 18 U. S. C. $ 921 etseq., establishes a detailed federal scheme governing the distribution of firearms. It prohibits firearms dealers fromtransferring handguns to any person under 21, not resident
in the dealer's State, or prohibited by state or local law frompurchasing or possessing firearms, $ 922(b). It also forbids
possession of a firearm by, and transfer of a firearm to, con-victed felons, fugitives from justice, unlawful users of controlled substances, persons adjudicated as mentally defectiveor committed to mental institutions, aliens unlawfully present in the United States, persons dishonorably dischargedfrom the Armed Forces, persons who have renounced their
citizenship, and persons who have been subjected to certainrestraining orders or been convicted of a misdemeanor offense involving domestic violence. $$ 922(d) and (g).In 1993, Congress amended the GCA by enacting the
Brady Act. The Act requires the Attorney General to es-tablish a national instant background-check system by November 30, 1998, Pub. L. 103-159, as amended, Pub. L. 103-322, 103 Stat. 2074, note following 18 U. S. C. $ 922, and

must first: (1) receive from the transferee a statement (theBrady Form), $ 922(s)(1)(A)(i)(I), containing the name, address, and date of birth of the proposed transferee along witha sworn statement that the transferee is not among any of
the classes of prohibited purchasers, $ 922(s)(3); (2) verify the
identity of the transferee by examining an identification doc-ument, $ 922(s)(1)(A)(i)(II); and (3) provide the "chief law enforcement officer" (CLEO) of the transferee's residence withnotice of the contents (and a copy) of the Brady Form,

$$ 922(s)(1)(A)(i)(III) and (IV). With some exceptions, thedealer must then wait five business days before consummating the sale, unless the CLEO earlier notifies the dealer that
he has no reason to believe the transfer would be illegal.

$ 922(s)(1)(A)(ii).

The Brady Act creates two significant alternatives to the
foregoing scheme. A dealer may sell a handgun immediately if the purchaser possesses a state handgun permit issued after a background check, $ 922(s)(1)(C), or if state law
provides for an instant background check, $ 922(s)(1)(D). In
States that have not rendered one of these alternatives applicable to all gun purchasers, CLEOs are required to perform certain duties. When a CLEO receives the required
notice of a proposed transfer from the firearms dealer, the
CLEO must "make a reasonable effort to ascertain within
5 business days whether receipt or possession would be in
violation of the law, including research in whatever State and
local recordkeeping systems are available and in a national
system designated by the Attorney General." $ 922(s)(2).
The Act does not require the CLEO to take any particular
action if he determines that a pending transaction would be
unlawful; he may notify the firearms dealer to that effect,
but is not required to do so. If, however, the CLEO notifies
a gun dealer that a prospective purchaser is ineligible to
receive a handgun, he must, upon request, provide the
would-be purchaser with a written statement of the reasons
for that determination. $ 922(s)(6)(C). Moreover, if the

Opinion of the Court
CLEO does not discover any basis for objecting to the sale,he must destroy any records in his possession relating

to the transfer, including his copy of the Brady Form.$ 922(s)(6)(B)(i). Under a separate provision of the GCA,
any person who "knowingly violates [the section of the GCAamended by the Brady Act] shall be fined under this title,
imprisoned for not more than 1 year, or both." $ 924(a)(5).Petitioners Jay Printz and Richard Mack, the CLEOs for
Ravalli County, Montana, and Graham County, Arizona,respectively, filed separate actions challenging the constitutionality of the Brady Act's interim provisions. In eachcase, the District Court held that the provision requiring
CLEOs to perform background checks was unconstitutional,but concluded that that provision was severable from the
remainder of the Act, effectively leaving a voluntarybackground-check system in place. 856 F. Supp. 1372 (Ariz.
1994); 854 F. Supp. 1503 (Mont. 1994). A divided panel ofthe Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, finding
none of the Brady Act's interim provisions to be unconstitu-tional. 66 F. 3d 1025 (1995). We granted certiorari. 518
U. S. 1003 (1996). II

From the description set forth above, it is apparent thatthe Brady Act purports to direct state law enforcement officers to participate, albeit only temporarily, in the administra-tion of a federally enacted regulatory scheme. Regulated
firearms dealers are required to forward Brady Forms notto a federal officer or employee, but to the CLEOs, whose
obligation to accept those forms is implicit in the duty im-posed upon them to make "reasonable efforts" within five
days to determine whether the sales reflected in the formsare lawful. While the CLEOs are subjected to no federal
requirement that they prevent the sales determined to beunlawful (it is perhaps assumed that their state-law duties
will require prevention or apprehension), they are empow-ered to grant, in effect, waivers of the federally prescribed

Opinion of the Court
5-day waiting period for handgun purchases by notifying thegun dealers that they have no reason to believe the transactions would be illegal.Petitioners here object to being pressed into federal service, and contend that congressional action compelling state
officers to execute federal laws is unconstitutional. Becausethere is no constitutional text speaking to this precise question, the answer to the CLEOs' challenge must be soughtin historical understanding and practice, in the structure
of the Constitution, and in the jurisprudence of this Court.We treat those three sources, in that order, in this and the
next two sections of this opinion.

Petitioners contend that compelled enlistment of state executive officers for the administration of federal programs is,
until very recent years at least, unprecedented. The Government contends, to the contrary, that "the earliest Congresses enacted statutes that required the participation of
state officials in the implementation of federal laws," Brief
for United States 28. The Government's contention demands our careful consideration, since early congressional
enactments "provid[e] `contemporaneous and weighty evidence' of the Constitution's meaning," Bowsher v. Synar, 478
U. S. 714, 723-724 (1986) (quoting Marsh v. Chambers, 463
U. S. 783, 790 (1983)). Indeed, such "contemporaneous legislative exposition of the Constitution . . . , acquiesced in for
a long term of years, fixes the construction to be given its
provisions." Myers v. United States, 272 U. S. 52, 175 (1926)
(citing numerous cases). Conversely if, as petitioners contend, earlier Congresses avoided use of this highly attractive
power, we would have reason to believe that the power was
thought not to exist.

The Government observes that statutes enacted by the
first Congresses required state courts to record applications
for citizenship, Act of Mar. 26, 1790, ch. 3, $ 1, 1 Stat. 103, to
transmit abstracts of citizenship applications and other naturalization records to the Secretary of State, Act of June 18,

1798, ch. 54, $ 2, 1 Stat. 567, and to register aliens seekingnaturalization and issue certificates of registry, Act of Apr.

14, 1802, ch. 28, $ 2, 2 Stat. 154-155. It may well be, how-ever, that these requirements applied only in States that authorized their courts to conduct naturalization proceedings.See Act of Mar. 26, 1790, ch. 3, $ 1, 1 Stat. 103;

Holmgren v.United States, 217 U. S. 509, 516-517 (1910) (explaining that

the Act of March 26, 1790, "conferred authority upon statecourts to admit aliens to citizenship" and refraining from addressing the question "whether the States can be requiredto enforce such naturalization laws against their consent");
United States v. Jones, 109 U. S. 513, 519-520 (1883) (statingthat these obligations were imposed "with the consent of the
States" and "could not be enforced against the consent of theStates").

Employers' Liability Cases, 223 U. S. 1 (1912), eliminate the possibility
that the duties imposed on state courts and their clerks in connection
with naturalization proceedings were contingent on the State's voluntary
assumption of the task of adjudicating citizenship applications. The
Second Employers' Liability Cases stand for the proposition that a state
court must entertain a claim arising under federal law "when its ordinary
jurisdiction as prescribed by local laws is appropriate to the occasion and
is invoked in conformity with those laws." Id., at 56-57. This does not
necessarily conflict with Holmgren and Jones, as the States obviously regulate the "ordinary jurisdiction" of their courts. (Our references throughout this opinion to "the dissent" are to the dissenting opinion of Justice
Stevens, joined by Justice Souter, Justice Ginsburg, and Justice
Breyer. The separate dissenting opinions of Justice Souter and Justice Breyer will be referred to as such.)

These early laws establish, at most, that the Constitutionwas originally understood to permit imposition of an obligation on state judges to enforce federal prescriptions, insofaras those prescriptions related to matters appropriate for the
judicial power. That assumption was perhaps implicit in oneof the provisions of the Constitution, and was explicit in another. In accord with the so-called Madisonian Compromise,
Article III, $ 1, established only a Supreme Court, and made
the creation of lower federal courts optional with the Congress--even though it was obvious that the Supreme Court
alone could not hear all federal cases throughout the United
States. See C. Warren, The Making of the Constitution
325-327 (1928). And the Supremacy Clause, Art. VI, cl. 2,
announced that "the Laws of the United States . . . shall be
the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State
shall be bound thereby." It is understandable why courts
should have been viewed distinctively in this regard; unlike
legislatures and executives, they applied the law of other
sovereigns all the time. The principle underlying so-called
"transitory" causes of action was that laws which operated
elsewhere created obligations in justice that courts of the
forum State would enforce. See, e. g., McKenna v. Fisk, 1
How. 241, 247-249 (1843). The Constitution itself, in the
Full Faith and Credit Clause, Art. IV, $ 1, generally required
such enforcement with respect to obligations arising in other
States. See Hughes v. Fetter, 341 U. S. 609 (1951).

For these reasons, we do not think the early statutes imposing obligations on state courts imply a power of Congress
to impress the state executive into its service. Indeed, it
can be argued that the numerousness of these statutes, contrasted with the utter lack of statutes imposing obligations

Opinion of the Court
on the States' executive (notwithstanding the attractivenessof that course to Congress), suggests an assumed absence of

such power.2 The only early federal law the Governmenthas brought to our attention that imposed duties on state
executive officers is the Extradition Act of 1793, which re2 Bereft of even a single early, or indeed even pre-20th-century, statute
compelling state executive officers to administer federal laws, the dissent
is driven to claim that early federal statutes compelled state judges to
perform executive functions, which implies a power to compel state executive officers to do so as well. Assuming that this implication would follow
(which is doubtful), the premise of the argument is in any case wrong.
None of the early statutes directed to state judges or court clerks required
the performance of functions more appropriately characterized as executive than judicial (bearing in mind that the line between the two for present purposes is not necessarily identical with the line established by the
Constitution for federal separation-of-powers purposes, see Sweezy v. New
Hampshire, 354 U. S. 234, 255 (1957)). Given that state courts were
entrusted with the quintessentially adjudicative task of determining
whether applicants for citizenship met the requisite qualifications, see Act
of Mar. 26, 1790, ch. 3, $ 1, 1 Stat. 103, it is unreasonable to maintain that
the ancillary functions of recording, registering, and certifying the citizenship applications were unalterably executive rather than judicial in nature.

The dissent's assertion that the Act of July 20, 1790, ch. 29, $ 3, 1 Stat.
132-133, which required state courts to resolve controversies between captain and crew regarding seaworthiness of a vessel, caused state courts to
act "like contemporary regulatory agencies," post, at 950-951, is cleverly
true--because contemporary regulatory agencies have been allowed to
perform adjudicative ("quasi-judicial") functions. See 5 U. S. C. $ 554;
Humphrey's Executor v. United States, 295 U. S. 602 (1935). It is foolish,
however, to mistake the copy for the original, and to believe that 18thcentury courts were imitating agencies, rather than 20th-century agencies
imitating courts. The Act's requirement that the court appoint "three
persons in the neighbourhood . . . most skilful in maritime affairs" to examine the ship and report on its condition certainly does not change the
proceeding into one "supervised by a judge but otherwise more characteristic of executive activity," post, at 951; that requirement is not significantly different from the contemporary judicial practice of appointing expert witnesses, see, e. g., Fed. Rule Evid. 706. The ultimate function of
the judge under the Act was purely adjudicative; he was, after receiving
the report, to "adjudge and determine . . . whether the said ship or vessel
is fit to proceed on the intended voyage . . . ." 1 Stat. 132.

quired the "executive authority" of a State to cause the ar-rest and delivery of a fugitive from justice upon the request

of the executive authority of the State from which the fugi-tive had fled. See Act of Feb. 12, 1793, ch. 7, $ 1, 1 Stat. 302.
That was in direct implementation, however, of the Extradi-tion Clause of the Constitution itself, see Art. IV, $ 2.

Not only do the enactments of the early Congresses, as faras we are aware, contain no evidence of an assumption that

the Federal Government may command the States' executivepower in the absence of a particularized constitutional authorization, they contain some indication of precisely the op-posite assumption. On September 23, 1789--the day before
its proposal of the Bill of Rights, see 1 Annals of Congress912-913--the First Congress enacted a law aimed at obtaining state assistance of the most rudimentary and necessarysort for the enforcement of the new Government's laws: the
holding of federal prisoners in state jails at federal expense.Significantly, the law issued not a command to the States'
executive, but a recommendation to their legislatures. Con-gress "recommended to the legislatures of the several States
to pass laws, making it expressly the duty of the keepers oftheir gaols, to receive and safe keep therein all prisoners
committed under the authority of the United States," andoffered to pay 50 cents per month for each prisoner. Act of
Sept. 23, 1789, 1 Stat. 96. Moreover, when Georgia refused

3 Article IV, $ 2, cl. 2, provides:
"A Person charged in any State with Treason, Felony, or other Crime,
who shall flee from Justice, and be found in another State, shall on Demand
of the executive Authority of the State from which he fled, be delivered
up, to be removed to the State having Jurisdiction of the Crime."

To the extent the legislation went beyond the substantive requirement of
this provision and specified procedures to be followed in complying with
the constitutional obligation, we have found that that was an exercise
of the congressional power to "prescribe the Manner in which such Acts,
Records and Proceedings, shall be proved, and the Effect thereof," Art.
IV, $ 1. See California v. Superior Court of Cal., San Bernardino Cty.,
482 U. S. 400, 407 (1987).

Opinion of the Court
to comply with the request, see L. White, The Federalists402 (1948), Congress's only reaction was a law authorizing

the marshal in any State that failed to comply with the Rec-ommendation of September 23, 1789, to rent a temporary jail
until provision for a permanent one could be made, see Resolution of Mar. 3, 1791, 1 Stat. 225.In addition to early legislation, the Government also appeals to other sources we have usually regarded as indicativeof the original understanding of the Constitution. It points
to portions of The Federalist which reply to criticisms thatCongress's power to tax will produce two sets of revenue
officers--for example, "Brutus's" assertion in his letter to the
New York Journal of December 13, 1787, that the Constitution "opens a door to the appointment of a swarm of revenue
and excise officers to prey upon the honest and industrious
part of the community, eat up their substance, and riot on
the spoils of the country," reprinted in 1 Debate on the Constitution 502 (B. Bailyn ed. 1993). "Publius" responded that
Congress will probably "make use of the State officers and
State regulations, for collecting" federal taxes, The Federalist No. 36, p. 221 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton) (hereinafter The Federalist), and predicted that "the eventual collection [of internal revenue] under the immediate authority
of the Union, will generally be made by the officers, and according to the rules, appointed by the several States," id.,
No. 45, at 292 (J. Madison). The Government also invokes
The Federalist's more general observations that the Constitution would "enable the [national] government to employ
the ordinary magistracy of each [State] in the execution
of its laws," id., No. 27, at 176 (A. Hamilton), and that it
was "extremely probable that in other instances, particularly in the organization of the judicial power, the officers
of the States will be clothed with the correspondent authority of the Union," id., No. 45, at 292 (J. Madison). But none
of these statements necessarily implies--what is the critical
point here--that Congress could impose these responsibil521US2 Unit: $U94 [11-20-99 17:18:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
ities without the consent of the States. They appear to reston the natural assumption that the States would consent to

allowing their officials to assist the Federal Government,see

FERC v. Mississippi, 456 U. S. 742, 796, n. 35 (1982)
(O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part), an assumption proved correct by the exten-sive mutual assistance the States and Federal Government

voluntarily provided one another in the early days of theRepublic, see generally White,

supra, at 401-404, including
voluntary federal implementation of state law, see, e. g., Actof Apr. 2, 1790, ch. 5, $ 1, 1 Stat. 106 (directing federal tax

collectors and customs officers to assist in enforcing stateinspection laws).

Another passage of The Federalist reads as follows:

"It merits particular attention . . . that the laws of the
Confederacy as to the enumerated and legitimate ob-jects of its jurisdiction will become the

supreme law
of the land; to the observance of which all officers, legislative, executive, and judicial in each State will be boundby the sanctity of an oath. Thus, the legislatures,

courts, and magistrates, of the respective members willbe incorporated into the operations of the national government as far as its just and constitutional authority
extends; and will be rendered auxiliary to the enforcement of its laws." The Federalist No. 27, at 177(A. Hamilton) (emphasis in original).

The Government does not rely upon this passage, but Justice Souter (with whose conclusions on this point the dissent is in agreement, see post, at 947-948) makes it the very
foundation of his position; so we pause to examine it in some
detail. Justice Souter finds "[t]he natural reading" of the
phrases " `will be incorporated into the operations of the
national government' " and " `will be rendered auxiliary to
the enforcement of its laws' " to be that the National Government will have "authority . . . , when exercising an other521US2 Unit: $U94 [11-20-99 17:18:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN
912 PRINTZ v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
wise legitimate power (the commerce power, say), to requirestate `auxiliaries' to take appropriate action." Post, at 971,

975. There are several obstacles to such an interpretation.First, the consequences in question ("incorporated into the
operations of the national government" and "rendered auxil-iary to the enforcement of its laws") are said in the quoted
passage to flow automatically from the officers' oath to ob-serve "the laws of the Confederacy as to the

enumerated andlegitimate objects of its jurisdiction."
4 Thus, if the passage

means that state officers must take an active role in the im-plementation of federal law, it means that they must do so

without the necessity for a congressional directive that theyimplement it. But no one has ever thought, and no one asserts in the present litigation, that that is the law. The sec-ond problem with

Justice Souter's reading is that it makesstate legislatures subject to federal direction. (The passage

in question, after all, does not include legislatures merelyincidentally, as by referring to "all state officers"; it refers
to legislatures specifically and first of all.) We have held,however, that state legislatures are not subject to federal
direction. New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144 (1992).5

4 Both the dissent and Justice Souter dispute that the consequences
are said to flow automatically. They are wrong. The passage says that
(1) federal laws will be supreme, and (2) all state officers will be oathbound to observe those laws, and thus (3) state officers will be "incorporated" and "rendered auxiliary." The reason the progression is automatic
is that there is not included between (2) and (3): "(2a) those laws will
include laws compelling action by state officers." It is the mere existence
of all federal laws that is said to make state officers "incorporated" and
"auxiliary."

5 Justice Souter seeks to avoid incompatibility with New York (a decision which he joined and purports to adhere to), by saying, post, at 975,
that the passage does not mean "any conceivable requirement may be imposed on any state official," and that "the essence of legislative power . . .
is a discretion not subject to command," so that legislatures, at least, cannot be commanded. But then why were legislatures mentioned in the
passage? It seems to us assuredly not a "natural reading" that being
"rendered auxiliary to the enforcement of [the National Government's]

521US2 Unit: $U94 [11-20-99 17:18:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
These problems are avoided, of course, if the calculatedly
vague consequences the passage recites--"incorporated into
the operations of the national government" and "rendered
auxiliary to the enforcement of its laws"--are taken to refer
to nothing more (or less) than the duty owed to the National
Government, on the part of all state officials, to enact, enforce, and interpret state law in such fashion as not to obstruct the operation of federal law, and the attendant reality
that all state actions constituting such obstruction, even legislative Acts, are ipso facto invalid.6 See Silkwood v. KerrMcGee Corp., 464 U. S. 238, 248 (1984) (federal pre-emption
of conflicting state law). This meaning accords well with
the context of the passage, which seeks to explain why the
new system of federal law directed to individual citizens, unlike the old one of federal law directed to the States, will "bid
much fairer to avoid the necessity of using force" against the
States, The Federalist No. 27, at 176. It also reconciles the

laws" means impressibility into federal service for "courts and magistrates" but something quite different for "legislatures." Moreover, the
novel principle of political science that Justice Souter invokes in order
to bring forth disparity of outcome from parity of language--namely, that
"the essence of legislative power . . . is a discretion not subject to command," ibid.--seems to us untrue. Perhaps legislatures are inherently
uncommandable as to the outcome of their legislation, but they are commanded all the time as to what subjects they shall legislate upon--commanded, that is, by the people, in constitutional provisions that require,
for example, the enactment of annual budgets or forbid the enactment of
laws permitting gambling. We do not think that state legislatures would
be betraying their very "essence" as legislatures (as opposed to their nature as sovereigns, a nature they share with the other two branches of
Government) if they obeyed a federal command to enact laws, for example,
criminalizing the sale of marijuana.

6 If Justice Souter finds these obligations too insignificant, see post,

at 972-973, n. 1, then perhaps he should subscribe to the interpretations
of "essential agency" given by Madison, see infra, at 914-915, and n. 8, or
by Story, see n. 8, infra. The point is that there is no necessity to give
the phrase the problematic meaning which alone enables him to use it as
a basis for deciding this case.

Opinion of the Court
passage with Hamilton's statement in The Federalist No. 36,
at 222, that the Federal Government would in some circumstances do well "to employ the State officers as much as possible, and to attach them to the Union by an accumulation
of their emoluments"--which surely suggests inducing state
officers to come aboard by paying them, rather than merely
commandeering their official services.7

Justice Souter contends that his interpretation of The
Federalist No. 27 is "supported by No. 44," written by Madison, wherefore he claims that "Madison and Hamilton" together stand opposed to our view. Post, at 971, 975. In
fact, The Federalist No. 44 quite clearly contradicts Justice
Souter's reading. In that Number, Madison justifies the
requirement that state officials take an oath to support the
Federal Constitution on the ground that they "will have an
essential agency in giving effect to the federal Constitution."
If the dissent's reading of The Federalist No. 27 were correct
(and if Madison agreed with it), one would surely have expected that "essential agency" of state executive officers (if
described further) to be described as their responsibility to
execute the laws enacted under the Constitution. Instead,
however, The Federalist No. 44 continues with the following description:

"The election of the President and Senate will depend,
in all cases, on the legislatures of the several States.
And the election of the House of Representatives will
equally depend on the same authority in the first instance; and will, probably, forever be conducted by the
officers and according to the laws of the States." Id., at
287 (emphasis added).

7 Justice Souter deduces from this passage in No. 36 that although the
Federal Government may commandeer state officers, it must compensate
them for their services. This is a mighty leap, which would create a constitutional jurisprudence (for determining when the compensation was adequate) that would make takings cases appear clear and simple.

Opinion of the Court
It is most implausible that the person who labored for that
example of state executive officers' assisting the Federal
Government believed, but neglected to mention, that they
had a responsibility to execute federal laws.8 If it was indeed Hamilton's view that the Federal Government could direct the officers of the States, that view has no clear support
in Madison's writings, or as far as we are aware, in text,
history, or early commentary elsewhere.9

8 Justice Souter's discussion of this passage omits to mention that it
contains an example of state executives' "essential agency"--and indeed
implies the opposite by observing that "other numbers of The Federalist
give examples" of the "essential agency" of state executive officers. Post,
at 973 (emphasis added). In seeking to explain the curiousness of Madison's not mentioning the state executives' obligation to administer federal
law, Justice Souter says that in speaking of "an essential agency in
giving effect to the federal Constitution," The Federalist No. 44, Madison
"was not talking about executing congressional statutes; he was talking
about putting the National Constitution into effect," post, at 973, n. 2.
Quite so, which is our very point.

It is interesting to observe that Story's Commentaries on the Constitution, commenting upon the same issue of why state officials are required
by oath to support the Constitution, uses the same "essential agency" language as Madison did in The Federalist No. 44, and goes on to give more
numerous examples of state executive agency than Madison did; all of
them, however, involve not state administration of federal law, but merely
the implementation of duties imposed on state officers by the Constitution
itself: "The executive authority of the several states may be often called
upon to exert Powers or allow Rights given by the Constitution, as in
filling vacancies in the senate during the recess of the legislature; in issuing writs of election to fill vacancies in the house of representatives; in
officering the militia, and giving effect to laws for calling them; and in
the surrender of fugitives from justice." 2 Story, Commentaries on the
Constitution of the United States 577 (1851).

9 Even if we agreed with Justice Souter's reading of The Federalist

No. 27, it would still seem to us most peculiar to give the view expressed
in that one piece, not clearly confirmed by any other writer, the determinative weight he does. That would be crediting the most expansive view of
federal authority ever expressed, and from the pen of the most expansive
expositor of federal power. Hamilton was "from first to last the most
nationalistic of all nationalists in his interpretation of the clauses of our

916 PRINTZ v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
To complete the historical record, we must note that there
is not only an absence of executive-commandeering statutes
in the early Congresses, but there is an absence of them in
our later history as well, at least until very recent years.
The Government points to the Act of August 3, 1882, ch. 376,

$$ 2, 4, 22 Stat. 214, which enlisted state officials "to take
charge of the local affairs of immigration in the ports within
such State, and to provide for the support and relief of such
immigrants therein landing as may fall into distress or need
of public aid"; to inspect arriving immigrants and exclude
any person found to be a "convict, lunatic, idiot," or indigent;
and to send convicts back to their country of origin "without
compensation." The statute did not, however, mandate
those duties, but merely empowered the Secretary of the
Treasury "to enter into contracts with such State . . . officers
as may be designated for that purpose by the governor of
any State." (Emphasis added.)

The Government cites the World War I selective draft law
that authorized the President "to utilize the service of any
or all departments and any or all officers or agents of the
United States and of the several States, Territories, and the
District of Columbia, and subdivisions thereof, in the execution of this Act," and made any person who refused to comply

federal Constitution." C. Rossiter, Alexander Hamilton and the Constitution 199 (1964). More specifically, it is widely recognized that "The Federalist reads with a split personality" on matters of federalism. See D.
Braveman, W. Banks, & R. Smolla, Constitutional Law: Structure and
Rights in Our Federal System 198-199 (3d ed. 1996). While overall The
Federalist reflects a "large area of agreement between Hamilton and Madison," Rossiter, supra, at 58, that is not the case with respect to the subject at hand, see Braveman, supra, at 198-199. To choose Hamilton's
view, as Justice Souter would, is to turn a blind eye to the fact that it
was Madison's--not Hamilton's--that prevailed, not only at the Constitutional Convention and in popular sentiment, see Rossiter, supra, at 44-47,
194, 196; 1 Records of the Federal Convention 366 (M. Farrand ed. 1911),
but in the subsequent struggle to fix the meaning of the Constitution by
early congressional practice, see supra, at 905-910.

with the President's directions guilty of a misdemeanor.Act of May 18, 1917, ch. 15, $ 6, 40 Stat. 80-81 (emphasis

added). However, it is far from clear that the authorization"to utilize the service" of state officers was an authorization
to compel the service of state officers; and the misdemeanor
provision surely applied only to refusal to comply with thePresident's

authorized directions, which might not have included directions to officers of States whose Governors hadnot volunteered their services. It is interesting that in implementing the Act President Wilson did not commandeerthe services of state officers, but instead requested the assistance of the States' Governors, see Proclamation of May
18, 1917, 40 Stat. 1665 ("call[ing] upon the Governor of each
of the several States . . . and all officers and agents of the
several States . . . to perform certain duties"); Registration
Regulations Prescribed by the President Under the Act of
Congress Approved May 18, 1917, pt. 1, $ 7 ("[T]he governor [of each State] is requested to act under the regulations
and rules prescribed by the President or under his direction"
(emphasis added)), obtained the consent of each of the Governors, see Note, The President, the Senate, the Constitution, and the Executive Order of May 8, 1926, 21 Ill. L. Rev.
142, 144 (1926), and left it to the Governors to issue orders
to their subordinate state officers, see Selective Service
Regulations Prescribed by the President Under the Act of
May 18, 1917, $ 27 (1918); J. Clark, The Rise of a New Federalism 91 (1965). See generally Note, 21 Ill. L. Rev., at 144.
It is impressive that even with respect to a wartime measure the President should have been so solicitous of state
independence.

The Government points to a number of federal statutes
enacted within the past few decades that require the participation of state or local officials in implementing federal regulatory schemes. Some of these are connected to federal
funding measures, and can perhaps be more accurately described as conditions upon the grant of federal funding than

Opinion of the Court
as mandates to the States; others, which require only the
provision of information to the Federal Government, do not
involve the precise issue before us here, which is the forced
participation of the States' executive in the actual administration of a federal program. We of course do not address
these or other currently operative enactments that are not
before us; it will be time enough to do so if and when their
validity is challenged in a proper case. For deciding the
issue before us here, they are of little relevance. Even assuming they represent assertion of the very same congressional power challenged here, they are of such recent vintage
that they are no more probative than the statute before us
of a constitutional tradition that lends meaning to the text.
Their persuasive force is far outweighed by almost two centuries of apparent congressional avoidance of the practice.
Compare INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919 (1983), in which the
legislative veto, though enshrined in perhaps hundreds of
federal statutes, most of which were enacted in the 1970's
and the earliest of which was enacted in 1932, see id.,
at 967-975 (White, J., dissenting), was nonetheless held
unconstitutional.

III

The constitutional practice we have examined above tends
to negate the existence of the congressional power asserted
here, but is not conclusive. We turn next to consideration
of the structure of the Constitution, to see if we can discern
among its "essential postulate[s]," Principality of Monaco v.
Mississippi, 292 U. S. 313, 322 (1934), a principle that controls the present cases.

A

It is incontestible that the Constitution established a system of "dual sovereignty." Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S.

and inviolable sovereignty," The Federalist No. 39, at 245
(J. Madison). This is reflected throughout the Constitution's

Federal Governments would exercise concurrent authorityover the people--who were, in Hamilton's words, "the only

proper objects of government," The Federalist No. 15, at 109.We have set forth the historical record in more detail elsewhere, see New York v. United States, 505 U. S., at 161-166,and need not repeat it here. It suffices to repeat the conclusion: "the Framers explicitly chose a Constitution that con-fers upon Congress the power to regulate individuals, not
States." Id., at 166.10 The great innovation of this designwas that "our citizens would have two political capacities,
one state and one federal, each protected from incursion bythe other"--"a legal system unprecedented in form and design, establishing two orders of government, each with itsown direct relationship, its own privity, its own set of mutual
rights and obligations to the people who sustain it and aregoverned by it." U. S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, 514
U. S. 779, 838 (1995) (Kennedy, J., concurring). The Consti-tution thus contemplates that a State's government will represent and remain accountable to its own citizens. See NewYork, supra, at 168-169; United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S.

pre-existing power under the Articles to issue commands to the States
with the additional power to make demands directly on individuals. See
post, at 945. That argument, however, was squarely rejected by the
Court in New York, supra, at 161-166, and with good reason. Many of
Congress's powers under Art. I, $ 8, were copied almost verbatim from
the Articles of Confederation, indicating quite clearly that "[w]here the

This separation of the two spheres is one of the Consti-tution's structural protections of liberty. "Just as the separation and independence of the coordinate branches of theFederal Government serve to prevent the accumulation
of excessive power in any one branch, a healthy balance ofpower between the States and the Federal Government will
reduce the risk of tyranny and abuse from either front."
Gregory, 501 U. S., at 458. To quote Madison once again:

11 Justice Breyer's dissent would have us consider the benefits that
other countries, and the European Union, believe they have derived from
federal systems that are different from ours. We think such comparative
analysis inappropriate to the task of interpreting a constitution, though it
was of course quite relevant to the task of writing one. The Framers
were familiar with many federal systems, from classical antiquity down to
their own time; they are discussed in Nos. 18-20 of The Federalist. Some
were (for the purpose here under discussion) quite similar to the modern
"federal" systems that Justice Breyer favors. Madison's and Hamilton's opinion of such systems could not be clearer. The Federalist No. 20,
after an extended critique of the system of government established by the
Union of Utrecht for the United Netherlands, concludes:

"I make no apology for having dwelt so long on the contemplation of
these federal precedents. Experience is the oracle of truth; and where its
responses are unequivocal, they ought to be conclusive and sacred. The
important truth, which it unequivocally pronounces in the present case, is
that a sovereignty over sovereigns, a government over governments, a
legislation for communities, as contradistinguished from individuals, as it
is a solecism in theory, so in practice it is subversive of the order and ends
of civil polity . . . ." Id., at 138.

Antifederalists, on the other hand, pointed specifically to Switzerland--
and its then-400 years of success as a "confederate republic"--as proof
that the proposed Constitution and its federal structure was unnecessary.
See Patrick Henry, Speeches given before the Virginia Ratifying Convention, 4 and 5 June, 1788, reprinted in The Essential Antifederalist 123,
135-136 (W. Allen & G. Lloyd ed. 1985). The fact is that our federalism
is not Europe's. It is "the unique contribution of the Framers to political
science and political theory." United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 575

Opinion of the Court
"In the compound republic of America, the power sur-rendered by the people is first divided between two distinct governments, and then the portion allotted to eachsubdivided among distinct and separate departments.
Hence a double security arises to the rights of the peo-ple. The different governments will control each other,
at the same time that each will be controlled by itself."The Federalist No. 51, at 323.

See also The Federalist No. 28, at 180-181 (A. Hamilton).The power of the Federal Government would be augmented
immeasurably if it were able to impress into its service--andat no cost to itself--the police officers of the 50 States.

B
We have thus far discussed the effect that federal controlof state officers would have upon the first element of the

"double security" alluded to by Madison: the division ofpower between State and Federal Governments. It would
also have an effect upon the second element: the separationand equilibration of powers between the three branches of
the Federal Government itself. The Constitution does notleave to speculation who is to administer the laws enacted
by Congress; the President, it says, "shall take Care thatthe Laws be faithfully executed," Art. II, $ 3, personally and
through officers whom he appoints (save for such inferiorofficers as Congress may authorize to be appointed by the
"Courts of Law" or by "the Heads of Departments" who arethemselves Presidential appointees), Art. II, $ 2. The Brady
Act effectively transfers this responsibility to thousands ofCLEOs in the 50 States, who are left to implement the program without meaningful Presidential control (if indeedmeaningful Presidential control is possible without the
power to appoint and remove). The insistence of the Fram-ers upon unity in the Federal Executive--to ensure both
vigor and accountability--is well known. See The Federal-ist No. 70 (A. Hamilton); 2 Documentary History of the Rati521US2 Unit: $U94 [11-20-99 17:18:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN

fication of the Constitution 495 (M. Jensen ed. 1976) (state-ment of James Wilson); see also Calabresi & Prakash, The

President's Power to Execute the Laws, 104 Yale L. J. 541(1994). That unity would be shattered, and the power of the
President would be subject to reduction, if Congress couldact as effectively without the President as with him, by simply requiring state officers to execute its laws.12

C
The dissent of course resorts to the last, best hope of thosewho defend ultra vires congressional action, the Necessary

and Proper Clause. It reasons, post, at 941, that the powerto regulate the sale of handguns under the Commerce
Clause, coupled with the power to "make all Laws whichshall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution
the foregoing Powers," Art. I, $ 8, conclusively establishesthe Brady Act's constitutional validity, because the Tenth
Amendment imposes no limitations on the exercise of delegated powers but merely prohibits the exercise of powers"not delegated to the United States." What destroys the

dissent's Necessary and Proper Clause argument, however,is not the Tenth Amendment but the Necessary and Proper
Clause itself.13 When a "La[w] . . . for carrying into Execu12 There is not, as the dissent believes, post, at 960, "tension" between
the proposition that impressing state police officers into federal service
will massively augment federal power, and the proposition that it will also
sap the power of the Federal Presidency. It is quite possible to have a
more powerful Federal Government that is, by reason of the destruction
of its Executive unity, a less efficient one. The dissent is correct, post, at
959-960, that control by the unitary Federal Executive is also sacrificed
when States voluntarily administer federal programs, but the condition of
voluntary state participation significantly reduces the ability of Congress
to use this device as a means of reducing the power of the Presidency.

13 This argument also falsely presumes that the Tenth Amendment is

the exclusive textual source of protection for principles of federalism.
Our system of dual sovereignty is reflected in numerous constitutional
provisions, see supra, at 919, and not only those, like the Tenth Amendment, that speak to the point explicitly. It is not at all unusual for our

and is thus, in the words of The Federalist, "merely [an] ac[t]of usurpation" which "deserve[s] to be treated as such."
The Federalist No. 33, at 204 (A. Hamilton). See Lawson &Granger, The "Proper" Scope of Federal Power: A Jurisdictional Interpretation of the Sweeping Clause, 43 Duke L. J.267, 297-326, 330-333 (1993). We in fact answered the dissent's Necessary and Proper Clause argument in New York:
"[E]ven where Congress has the authority under the Constitution to pass laws requiring or prohibiting certain acts, itlacks the power directly to compel the States to require or

prohibit those acts. . . . [T]he Commerce Clause, for example,authorizes Congress to regulate interstate commerce directly; it does not authorize Congress to regulate state gov-ernments' regulation of interstate commerce." 505 U. S.,
at 166.The dissent perceives a simple answer in that portion of
Article VI which requires that "all executive and judicial Officers, both of the United States and of the several States,shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution," arguing that by virtue of the Supremacy Clausethis makes "not only the Constitution, but every law enacted
by Congress as well," binding on state officers, includinglaws requiring state-officer enforcement.

Supremacy Clause, however, makes "Law of the Land" only"Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance [of the Constitution]," Art. VI, cl. 2, so the Supremacy

implications. See, e. g., Myers v. United States, 272 U. S. 52 (1926) (finding
by implication from Art. II, $$ 1, 2, that the President has the exclusive
power to remove executive officers); Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514
U. S. 211 (1995) (finding that Article III implies a lack of congressional
power to set aside final judgments).

Clause merely brings us back to the question discussed ear-lier, whether laws conscripting state officers violate state

sovereignty and are thus not in accord with the Constitution.

IV
Finally, and most conclusively in the present litigation, weturn to the prior jurisprudence of this Court. Federal commandeering of state governments is such a novel phenome-non that this Court's first experience with it did not occur
until the 1970's, when the Environmental Protection Agencypromulgated regulations requiring States to prescribe auto
emissions testing, monitoring and retrofit programs, and todesignate preferential bus and carpool lanes. The Courts of
Appeals for the Fourth and Ninth Circuits invalidated theregulations on statutory grounds in order to avoid what they
perceived to be grave constitutional issues, see Maryland v.
EPA, 530 F. 2d 215, 226 (CA4 1975); Brown v. EPA, 521 F. 2d827, 838-842 (CA9 1975); and the District of Columbia Circuit

invalidated the regulations on both constitutional and statu-tory grounds, see District of Columbia v. Train, 521 F. 2d
971, 994 (1975). After we granted certiorari to review thestatutory and constitutional validity of the regulations, the
Government declined even to defend them, and instead re-scinded some and conceded the invalidity of those that remained, leading us to vacate the opinions below and remandfor consideration of mootness.

EPA v. Brown, 431 U. S. 99(1977) (per curiam).

Although we had no occasion to pass upon the subject inBrown, later opinions of ours have made clear that the Federal Government may not compel the States to implement,by legislation or executive action, federal regulatory programs. In Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn., Inc., 452 U. S. 264 (1981), and FERC v. Missis-sippi, 456 U. S. 742 (1982), we sustained statutes against

constitutional challenge only after assuring ourselves thatthey did not require the States to enforce federal law. In

521US2 Unit: $U94 [11-20-99 17:18:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN
926 PRINTZ v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
Hodel we cited the lower court cases in EPA v. Brown,
supra, but concluded that the Surface Mining Control and
Reclamation Act of 1977 did not present the problem theyraised because it merely made compliance with federal

standards a precondition to continued state regulation in an
otherwise pre-empted field, Hodel, supra, at 288. In FERC,we construed the most troubling provisions of the Public

Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 to contain only the"command" that state agencies "consider" federal standards,
and again only as a precondition to continued state regula-tion of an otherwise pre-empted field. 456 U. S., at 764-765.
We warned that "this Court never has sanctioned explicitly
a federal command to the States to promulgate and enforce
laws and regulations," id., at 761-762.

When we were at last confronted squarely with a federal
statute that unambiguously required the States to enact or
administer a federal regulatory program, our decision should
have come as no surprise. At issue in New York v. United
States, 505 U. S. 144 (1992), were the so-called "take title"
provisions of the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy
Amendments Act of 1985, which required States either to
enact legislation providing for the disposal of radioactive
waste generated within their borders, or to take title to, and
possession of, the waste--effectively requiring the States
either to legislate pursuant to Congress's directions, or to
implement an administrative solution. Id., at 175-176. We
concluded that Congress could constitutionally require the
States to do neither. Id., at 176. "The Federal Government," we held, "may not compel the States to enact or administer a federal regulatory program." Id., at 188.

The Government contends that New York is distinguishable on the following ground: Unlike the "take title" provisions invalidated there, the background-check provision of
the Brady Act does not require state legislative or executive
officials to make policy, but instead issues a final directive to
state CLEOs. It is permissible, the Government asserts,

521US2 Unit: $U94 [11-20-99 17:18:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN

927Cite as: 521 U. S. 898 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
for Congress to command state or local officials to assist inthe implementation of federal law so long as "Congress itself

devises a clear legislative solution that regulates private con-duct" and requires state or local officers to provide only "limited, non-policymaking help in enforcing that law." "[T]he
constitutional line is crossed only when Congress compelsthe States to make law in their sovereign capacities." Brief

for United States 16.The Government's distinction between "making" law and
merely "enforcing" it, between "policymaking" and mere"implementation," is an interesting one. It is perhaps not
meant to be the same as, but it is surely reminiscent of, the
line that separates proper congressional conferral of Executive power from unconstitutional delegation of legislative
authority for federal separation-of-powers purposes. See
A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U. S.
495, 530 (1935); Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan, 293 U. S. 388,
428-429 (1935). This Court has not been notably successful
in describing the latter line; indeed, some think we have
abandoned the effort to do so. See FPC v. New England
Power Co., 415 U. S. 345, 352-353 (1974) (Marshall, J., concurring in result); Schoenbrod, The Delegation Doctrine: Could
the Court Give it Substance?, 83 Mich. L. Rev. 1223, 1233
(1985). We are doubtful that the new line the Government
proposes would be any more distinct. Executive action that
has utterly no policymaking component is rare, particularly
at an executive level as high as a jurisdiction's chief law
enforcement officer. Is it really true that there is no policymaking involved in deciding, for example, what "reasonable
efforts" shall be expended to conduct a background check?
It may well satisfy the Act for a CLEO to direct that (a) no
background checks will be conducted that divert personnel
time from pending felony investigations, and (b) no background check will be permitted to consume more than onehalf hour of an officer's time. But nothing in the Act requires a CLEO to be so parsimonious; diverting at least

521US2 Unit: $U94 [11-20-99 17:18:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN
928 PRINTZ v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
some felony-investigation time, and permitting at least somebackground checks beyond one-half hour would certainly not

be unreasonable. Is this decision whether to devote maxi-mum "reasonable efforts" or minimum "reasonable efforts"
not preeminently a matter of policy? It is quite impossible,
in short, to draw the Government's proposed line at "no poli-cymaking," and we would have to fall back upon a line of

"not too much policymaking." How much is too much is notlikely to be answered precisely; and an imprecise barrier
against federal intrusion upon state authority is not likely tobe an effective one.

Even assuming, moreover, that the Brady Act leaves no
"policymaking" discretion with the States, we fail to see how
that improves rather than worsens the intrusion upon state
sovereignty. Preservation of the States as independent and
autonomous political entities is arguably less undermined by
requiring them to make policy in certain fields than (as Judge
Sneed aptly described it over two decades ago) by "reduc[ing] [them] to puppets of a ventriloquist Congress," Brown
v. EPA, 521 F. 2d, at 839. It is an essential attribute of the
States' retained sovereignty that they remain independent
and autonomous within their proper sphere of authority.
See Texas v. White, 7 Wall., at 725. It is no more compatible
with this independence and autonomy that their officers be
"dragooned" (as Judge Fernandez put it in his dissent below,
66 F. 3d, at 1035) into administering federal law, than it
would be compatible with the independence and autonomy of
the United States that its officers be impressed into service
for the execution of state laws.

The Government purports to find support for its proffered
distinction of New York in our decisions in Testa v. Katt, 330
U. S. 386 (1947), and FERC v. Mississippi, 456 U. S. 742
(1982). We find neither case relevant. Testa stands for the
proposition that state courts cannot refuse to apply federal
law--a conclusion mandated by the terms of the Supremacy
Clause ("the Judges in every State shall be bound [by federal

521US2 Unit: $U94 [11-20-99 17:18:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
law]"). As we have suggested earlier, supra, at 907, thatsays nothing about whether state executive officers must administer federal law. Accord, New York, 505 U. S., at 178-179. As for FERC, it stated (as we have described earlier)
that "this Court never has sanctioned explicitly a federalcommand to the States to promulgate and enforce laws and
regulations," 456 U. S., at 761-762, and upheld the statutoryprovisions at issue precisely because they did

not comman-deer state government, but merely imposed preconditions to

continued state regulation of an otherwise pre-empted field,in accord with Hodel, 452 U. S., at 288, and required state
administrative agencies to apply federal law while acting ina judicial capacity, in accord with

Testa, see FERC, supra, at759-771, and n. 24.
14

The Government also maintains that requiring state offi-cers to perform discrete, ministerial tasks specified by Congress does not violate the principle of New York because it

14 The dissent points out that FERC cannot be construed as merely following the principle recognized in Testa that state courts must apply relevant federal law because "[a]lthough the commission was serving an adjudicative function, the commissioners were unquestionably not `judges'
within the meaning of [the Supremacy Clause]." Post, at 969. That is
true enough. But the answer to the question of which state officers must
apply federal law (only " `judges' within the meaning of [the Supremacy
Clause]") is different from the answer to the question of which state officers may be required by statute to apply federal law (officers who conduct

adjudications similar to those traditionally performed by judges). It is
within the power of the States, as it is within the power of the Federal
Government, see Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S. 22 (1932), to transfer some
adjudicatory functions to administrative agencies, with opportunity for
subsequent judicial review. But it is also within the power of Congress
to prescribe, explicitly or by implication (as in the legislation at issue in
FERC), that those adjudications must take account of federal law. The
existence of this latter power should not be unacceptable to a dissent that
believes distinguishing among officers on the basis of their title rather
than the function they perform is "empty formalistic reasoning of the highest order," post, at 952. We have no doubt that FERC would not have
been decided the way it was if nonadjudicative responsibilities of the state
agency were at issue.

930 PRINTZ v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
does not diminish the accountability of state or federal offi-cials. This argument fails even on its own terms. By forcing state governments to absorb the financial burden ofimplementing a federal regulatory program, Members of
Congress can take credit for "solving" problems without having to ask their constituents to pay for the solutions withhigher federal taxes. And even when the States are not

forced to absorb the costs of implementing a federal pro-gram, they are still put in the position of taking the blame for
its burdensomeness and for its defects. See Merritt, ThreeFaces of Federalism: Finding a Formula for the Future, 47
Vand. L. Rev. 1563, 1580, n. 65 (1994). Under the present
law, for example, it will be the CLEO and not some federal
official who stands between the gun purchaser and immediate possession of his gun. And it will likely be the CLEO,
not some federal official, who will be blamed for any error
(even one in the designated federal database) that causes a
purchaser to be mistakenly rejected.

The dissent makes no attempt to defend the Government's
basis for distinguishing New York, but instead advances
what seems to us an even more implausible theory. The
Brady Act, the dissent asserts, is different from the "take
title" provisions invalidated in New York because the former
is addressed to individuals--namely, CLEOs--while the latter were directed to the State itself. That is certainly a difference, but it cannot be a constitutionally significant one.
While the Brady Act is directed to "individuals," it is directed to them in their official capacities as state officers; it
controls their actions, not as private citizens, but as the
agents of the State. The distinction between judicial writs
and other government action directed against individuals in
their personal capacity, on the one hand, and in their official
capacity, on the other hand, is an ancient one, principally because it is dictated by common sense. We have observed
that "a suit against a state official in his or her official capacity is not a suit against the official but rather is a suit against

521US2 Unit: $U94 [11-20-99 17:18:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
the official's office. . . . As such, it is no different from a suit
against the State itself." Will v. Michigan Dept. of State
Police, 491 U. S. 58, 71 (1989). And the same must be said
of a directive to an official in his or her official capacity. To
say that the Federal Government cannot control the State,
but can control all of its officers, is to say nothing of significance.15 Indeed, it merits the description "empty formalistic reasoning of the highest order," post, at 952. By resorting to this, the dissent not so much distinguishes New York
as disembowels it.16

Finally, the Government puts forward a cluster of arguments that can be grouped under the heading: "The Brady
Act serves very important purposes, is most efficiently ad15 Contrary to the dissent's suggestion, post, at 955-956, n. 16, and 965,
the distinction in our Eleventh Amendment jurisprudence between States
and municipalities is of no relevance here. We long ago made clear that
the distinction is peculiar to the question of whether a governmental entity is entitled to Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity, see Monell
v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs., 436 U. S. 658, 690, n. 55 (1978);
we have refused to apply it to the question of whether a governmental
entity is protected by the Constitution's guarantees of federalism, including the Tenth Amendment, see National League of Cities v. Usery, 426
U. S. 833, 855-856, n. 20 (1976) (overruled on other grounds by Garcia v.
San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528 (1985)); see
also Garcia, supra (resolving Tenth Amendment issues in suit brought by
local transit authority).

16 The dissent's suggestion, post, at 964, n. 27, that New York v. United

States, 505 U. S. 144 (1992), itself embraced the distinction between congressional control of States (impermissible) and congressional control of
state officers (permissible) is based upon the most egregious wrenching of
statements out of context. It would take too much to reconstruct the
context here, but by examining the entire passage cited, id., at 178-179,
the reader will readily perceive the distortion. The passage includes, for
example, the following:

"Additional cases cited by the United States discuss the power of federal
courts to order state officials to comply with federal law. . . . Again, however, the text of the Constitution plainly confers this authority on the
federal courts . . . . The Constitution contains no analogous grant of authority to Congress." Id., at 179.

There is considerable disagreement over the extent of the
burden, but we need not pause over that detail. Assuming
all the mentioned factors were true, they might be relevant
if we were evaluating whether the incidental application to
the States of a federal law of general applicability excessively interfered with the functioning of state governments.
See, e. g., Fry v. United States, 421 U. S. 542, 548 (1975); National League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U. S. 833, 853 (1976)
(overruled by Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit
Authority, 469 U. S. 528 (1985)); South Carolina v. Baker,
485 U. S. 505, 529 (1988) (Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in
judgment). But where, as here, it is the whole object of the
law to direct the functioning of the state executive, and
hence to compromise the structural framework of dual sovereignty, such a "balancing" analysis is inappropriate.17 It is
the very principle of separate state sovereignty that such
a law offends, and no comparative assessment of the various interests can overcome that fundamental defect. Cf.
Bowsher, 478 U. S., at 736 (declining to subject principle of
separation of powers to a balancing test); Chadha, 462 U. S.,
at 944-946 (same); Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U. S.

17 The dissent observes that "Congress could require private persons,
such as hospital executives or school administrators, to provide arms merchants with relevant information about a prospective purchaser's fitness
to own a weapon," and that "the burden on police officers [imposed by the
Brady Act] would be permissible if a similar burden were also imposed
on private parties with access to relevant data." Post, at 961. That is
undoubtedly true, but it does not advance the dissent's case. The Brady
Act does not merely require CLEOs to report information in their private
possession. It requires them to provide information that belongs to the
State and is available to them only in their official capacity; and to conduct
investigation in their official capacity, by examining databases and records
that only state officials have access to. In other words, the suggestion
that extension of this statute to private citizens would eliminate the constitutional problem posits the impossible.

Opinion of the Court
211, 239-240 (1995) (holding legislated invalidation of finaljudgments to be categorically unconstitutional). We expressly rejected such an approach in New York, and what wesaid bears repeating:

"Much of the Constitution is concerned with settingforth the form of our government, and the courts have
traditionally invalidated measures deviating from thatform. The result may appear `formalistic' in a given
case to partisans of the measure at issue, because suchmeasures are typically the product of the era's perceived
necessity. But the Constitution protects us from ourown best intentions: It divides power among sovereigns
and among branches of government precisely so that wemay resist the temptation to concentrate power in one
location as an expedient solution to the crisis of the day."505 U. S., at 187.

We adhere to that principle today, and conclude categorically,as we concluded categorically in

New York: "The FederalGovernment may not compel the States to enact or administer a federal regulatory program." Id., at 188. The manda-tory obligation imposed on CLEOs to perform background
checks on prospective handgun purchasers plainly runs afoulof that rule.

V
What we have said makes it clear enough that the centralobligation imposed upon CLEOs by the interim provisions

of the Brady Act--the obligation to "make a reasonable ef-fort to ascertain within 5 business days whether receipt or
possession [of a handgun] would be in violation of the law,including research in whatever State and local recordkeeping
systems are available and in a national system designated bythe Attorney General," 18 U. S. C. $ 922(s)(2)--is unconstitutional. Extinguished with it, of course, is the duty implicitin the background-check requirement that the CLEO accept
notice of the contents of, and a copy of, the completed Brady

Opinion of the Court
Form, which the firearms dealer is required to provide to
him, $$ 922(s)(1)(A)(i)(III) and (IV).

Petitioners also challenge, however, two other provisions
of the Act: (1) the requirement that any CLEO "to whom a
[Brady Form] is transmitted" destroy the form and any record containing information derived from it, $ 922(s)(6)(B)(i),
and (2) the requirement that any CLEO who "determines
that an individual is ineligible to receive a handgun" provide
the would-be purchaser, upon request, a written statement
of the reasons for that determination, $ 922(s)(6)(C). With
the background-check and implicit receipt-of-forms requirements invalidated, however, these provisions require no action whatsoever on the part of the CLEO. Quite obviously,
the obligation to destroy all Brady Forms that he has received when he has received none, and the obligation to give
reasons for a determination of ineligibility when he never
makes a determination of ineligibility, are no obligations at
all. These two provisions have conceivable application to a
CLEO, in other words, only if he has chosen, voluntarily,
to participate in administration of the federal scheme. The
present petitioners are not in that position.18 As to them,
these last two challenged provisions are not unconstitutional,
but simply inoperative.

18 We note, in this regard, that both CLEOs before us here assert that
they are prohibited from taking on these federal responsibilities under
state law. That assertion is clearly correct with regard to Montana law,
which expressly enjoins any "county . . . or other local government unit"
from "prohibit[ing] . . . or regulat[ing] the purchase, sale or other transfer
(including delay in purchase, sale, or other transfer), ownership, [or] possession . . . of any . . . handgun," Mont. Code Ann. $ 45-8-351(1) (1995).
It is arguably correct with regard to Arizona law as well, which states
that "[a] political subdivision of this state shall not . . . prohibit the ownership, purchase, sale or transfer of firearms," Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 13-
3108(B) (1989). We need not resolve that question today; it is at least
clear that Montana and Arizona do not require their CLEOs to implement
the Brady Act, and CLEOs Printz and Mack have chosen not to do so.

O'Connor, J., concurring
There is involved in this Brady Act conundrum a severabil-ity question, which the parties have briefed and argued:

whether firearms dealers in the jurisdictions at issue here,and in other jurisdictions, remain obliged to forward to
the CLEO (even if he will not accept it) the requisite
notice of the contents (and a copy) of the Brady Form,$$ 922(s)(1)(A)(i)(III) and (IV); and to wait five business days

before consummating the sale, $ 922(s)(1)(A)(ii). These areimportant questions, but we have no business answering
them in these cases. These provisions burden only firearmsdealers and purchasers, and no plaintiff in either of those
categories is before us here. We decline to speculate re-garding the rights and obligations of parties not before the
Court. Cf., e. g., New York, supra, at 186-187 (addressing
severability where remaining provisions at issue affectedthe plaintiffs).

* * *
We held in New York that Congress cannot compel the
States to enact or enforce a federal regulatory program.Today we hold that Congress cannot circumvent that prohibition by conscripting the States' officers directly. The Fed-eral Government may neither issue directives requiring the
States to address particular problems, nor command the
States' officers, or those of their political subdivisions, to ad-minister or enforce a federal regulatory program. It matters not whether policymaking is involved, and no case-by-case weighing of the burdens or benefits is necessary; such
commands are fundamentally incompatible with our constitu-tional system of dual sovereignty. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit isreversed.

It is so ordered.
Justice O'Connor, concurring.
Our precedent and our Nation's historical practices support the Court's holding today. The Brady Act violates the

936 PRINTZ v. UNITED STATES

Thomas, J., concurring
Tenth Amendment to the extent it forces States and locallaw enforcement officers to perform background checks on

prospective handgun owners and to accept Brady Formsfrom firearms dealers. See

ante, at 922. Our holding, of
course, does not spell the end of the objectives of the Brady
Act. States and chief law enforcement officers may volun-tarily continue to participate in the federal program. Moreover, the directives to the States are merely interim provi-sions scheduled to terminate November 30, 1998. Note
following 18 U. S. C. $ 922. Congress is also free to amendthe interim program to provide for its continuance on a
contractual basis with the States if it wishes, as it doeswith a number of other federal programs. See,

e. g., 23
U. S. C. $ 402 (conditioning States' receipt of federal funds
for highway safety program on compliance with federal
requirements).

In addition, the Court appropriately refrains from deciding
whether other purely ministerial reporting requirements imposed by Congress on state and local authorities pursuant to
its Commerce Clause powers are similarly invalid. See,
e. g., 42 U. S. C. $ 5779(a) (requiring state and local law enforcement agencies to report cases of missing children to the
Department of Justice). The provisions invalidated here,
however, which directly compel state officials to administer
a federal regulatory program, utterly fail to adhere to the
design and structure of our constitutional scheme.

Justice Thomas, concurring.
The Court today properly holds that the Brady Act violates the Tenth Amendment in that it compels state law enforcement officers to "administer or enforce a federal regulatory program." See ante, at 935. Although I join the
Court's opinion in full, I write separately to emphasize that
the Tenth Amendment affirms the undeniable notion that
under our Constitution, the Federal Government is one of
enumerated, hence limited, powers. See, e. g., McCulloch v.

521US2 Unit: $U94 [11-20-99 17:18:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 405 (1819) ("This government isacknowledged by all to be one of enumerated powers").

"[T]hat those limits may not be mistaken, or forgotten, theconstitution is written."

Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch
137, 176 (1803). Accordingly, the Federal Government may
act only where the Constitution authorizes it to do so. Cf.
New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144 (1992).

In my "revisionist" view, see post, at 941 (Stevens, J.,dissenting), the Federal Government's authority under the

Commerce Clause, which merely allocates to Congress thepower "to regulate Commerce . . . among the several States,"
does not extend to the regulation of wholly intrastate,
point-of-sale transactions. See United States v. Lopez, 514
U. S. 549, 584 (1995) (concurring opinion). Absent the underlying authority to regulate the intrastate transfer of
firearms, Congress surely lacks the corollary power to impress state law enforcement officers into administering and
enforcing such regulations. Although this Court has long
interpreted the Constitution as ceding Congress extensive
authority to regulate commerce (interstate or otherwise), I
continue to believe that we must "temper our Commerce
Clause jurisprudence" and return to an interpretation better
rooted in the Clause's original understanding. Id., at 601
(concurring opinion); see also Camps Newfound/Owatonna,
Inc. v. Town of Harrison, 520 U. S. 564, 620 (1997) (Thomas,
J., dissenting).

Even if we construe Congress' authority to regulate interstate commerce to encompass those intrastate transactions
that "substantially affect" interstate commerce, I question
whether Congress can regulate the particular transactions
at issue here. The Constitution, in addition to delegating
certain enumerated powers to Congress, places whole areas
outside the reach of Congress' regulatory authority. The
First Amendment, for example, is fittingly celebrated for
preventing Congress from "prohibiting the free exercise" of
religion or "abridging the freedom of speech." The Second

Amendment similarly appears to contain an express limita-tion on the Government's authority. That Amendment provides: "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the secu-rity of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear
arms, shall not be infringed." This Court has not had recentoccasion to consider the nature of the substantive right safeguarded by the Second Amendment.1 If, however, the Sec-ond Amendment is read to confer a

personal right to "keepand bear arms," a colorable argument exists that the Federal

Government's regulatory scheme, at least as it pertains tothe purely intrastate sale or possession of firearms, runs
afoul of that Amendment's protections.2 As the parties did

1 Our most recent treatment of the Second Amendment occurred in
United States v. Miller, 307 U. S. 174 (1939), in which we reversed the
District Court's invalidation of the National Firearms Act, enacted in 1934.
In Miller, we determined that the Second Amendment did not guarantee
a citizen's right to possess a sawed-off shotgun because that weapon had
not been shown to be "ordinary military equipment" that could "contribute
to the common defense." Id., at 178. The Court did not, however, attempt to define, or otherwise construe, the substantive right protected by
the Second Amendment.

2 Marshaling an impressive array of historical evidence, a growing body

of scholarly commentary indicates that the "right to keep and bear arms"
is, as the Amendment's text suggests, a personal right. See, e. g., J. Malcolm, To Keep and Bear Arms: The Origins of an Anglo-American Right
162 (1994); S. Halbrook, That Every Man Be Armed, The Evolution of a
Constitutional Right (1984); Van Alstyne, The Second Amendment and the
Personal Right to Arms, 43 Duke L. J. 1236 (1994); Amar, The Bill of
Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment, 101 Yale L. J. 1193 (1992); Cottrol & Diamond, The Second Amendment: Toward an Afro-Americanist
Reconsideration, 80 Geo. L. J. 309 (1991); Levinson, The Embarrassing
Second Amendment, 99 Yale L. J. 637 (1989); Kates, Handgun Prohibition
and the Original Meaning of the Second Amendment, 82 Mich. L. Rev. 204
(1983). Other scholars, however, argue that the Second Amendment does
not secure a personal right to keep or to bear arms. See, e. g., Bogus,
Race, Riots, and Guns, 66 S. Cal. L. Rev. 1365 (1993); Williams, Civic Republicanism and the Citizen Militia: The Terrifying Second Amendment,

not raise this argument, however, we need not consider ithere. Perhaps, at some future date, this Court will have the

opportunity to determine whether Justice Story was correctwhen he wrote that the right to bear arms "has justly been
considered, as the palladium of the liberties of a republic."3 J. Story, Commentaries $ 1890, p. 746 (1833). In the meantime, I join the Court's opinion striking down the challengedprovisions of the Brady Act as inconsistent with the Tenth
Amendment.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Souter, Justice
Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.

When Congress exercises the powers delegated to it bythe Constitution, it may impose affirmative obligations on

executive and judicial officers of state and local governmentsas well as ordinary citizens. This conclusion is firmly supported by the text of the Constitution, the early history ofthe Nation, decisions of this Court, and a correct understanding of the basic structure of the Federal Government.These cases do not implicate the more difficult questions
associated with congressional coercion of state legislaturesaddressed in

New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144 (1992).Nor need we consider the wisdom of relying on local officials

rather than federal agents to carry out aspects of a federalprogram, or even the question whether such officials may be
required to perform a federal function on a permanent basis.The question is whether Congress, acting on behalf of the
people of the entire Nation, may require local law enforce-ment officers to perform certain duties during the interim
needed for the development of a federal gun control program.It is remarkably similar to the question, heavily debated by
the Framers of the Constitution, whether Congress could re-quire state agents to collect federal taxes. Or the question

Origins and Meaning of the Right to Bear Arms, 71 J. Am. Hist. 22 (1984).
Although somewhat overlooked in our jurisprudence, the Amendment has
certainly engendered considerable academic, as well as public, debate.

Stevens, J., dissenting
whether Congress could impress state judges into federal
service to entertain and decide cases that they would prefer
to ignore.

Indeed, since the ultimate issue is one of power, we must
consider its implications in times of national emergency.
Matters such as the enlistment of air raid wardens, the administration of a military draft, the mass inoculation of children to forestall an epidemic, or perhaps the threat of an
international terrorist, may require a national response before federal personnel can be made available to respond. If
the Constitution empowers Congress and the President to
make an appropriate response, is there anything in the Tenth
Amendment, "in historical understanding and practice, in the
structure of the Constitution, [or] in the jurisprudence of this
Court," ante, at 905, that forbids the enlistment of state officers to make that response effective? More narrowly, what
basis is there in any of those sources for concluding that it is
the Members of this Court, rather than the elected representatives of the people, who should determine whether the
Constitution contains the unwritten rule that the Court announces today?

Perhaps today's majority would suggest that no such
emergency is presented by the facts of these cases. But
such a suggestion is itself an expression of a policy judgment.
And Congress' view of the matter is quite different from that
implied by the Court today.

The Brady Act was passed in response to what Congress
described as an "epidemic of gun violence." H. R. Rep. No.
103-344, p. 8 (1993). The Act's legislative history notes that
15,377 Americans were murdered with firearms in 1992, and
that 12,489 of these deaths were caused by handguns. Ibid.
Congress expressed special concern that "[t]he level of firearm violence in this country is, by far, the highest among
developed nations." Ibid. The partial solution contained
in the Brady Act, a mandatory background check before a

handgun may be purchased, has met with remarkable success. Between 1994 and 1996, approximately 6,600 firearm
sales each month to potentially dangerous persons were prevented by Brady Act checks; over 70% of the rejected purchasers were convicted or indicted felons. See U. S. Dept.
of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics Bulletin, A National
Estimate: Presale Firearm Checks 1 (Feb. 1997). Whether
or not the evaluation reflected in the enactment of the Brady
Act is correct as to the extent of the danger and the efficacy
of the legislation, the congressional decision surely warrants
more respect than it is accorded in today's unprecedented
decision.

I

The text of the Constitution provides a sufficient basis for
a correct disposition of these cases.

Article I, $ 8, grants Congress the power to regulate commerce among the States. Putting to one side the revisionist
views expressed by Justice Thomas in his concurring opinion in United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 584 (1995), there
can be no question that that provision adequately supports
the regulation of commerce in handguns effected by the
Brady Act. Moreover, the additional grant of authority in
that section of the Constitution "[t]o make all Laws which
shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution
the foregoing Powers" is surely adequate to support the
temporary enlistment of local police officers in the process
of identifying persons who should not be entrusted with
the possession of handguns. In short, the affirmative delegation of power in Article I provides ample authority for the
congressional enactment.

Unlike the First Amendment, which prohibits the enactment of a category of laws that would otherwise be authorized by Article I, the Tenth Amendment imposes no restriction on the exercise of delegated powers. Using language

Stevens, J., dissenting
that plainly refers only to powers that are "not" delegatedto Congress, it provides:

"The powers not delegated to the United States bythe Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are
reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."U. S. Const., Amdt. 10.

The Amendment confirms the principle that the powers ofthe Federal Government are limited to those affirmatively
granted by the Constitution, but it does not purport to limitthe scope or the effectiveness of the exercise of powers that
are delegated to Congress.1 See New York v. United States,505 U. S., at 156 ("In a case . . . involving the division of
authority between federal and state governments, the twoinquiries are mirror images of each other"). Thus, the
Amendment provides no support for a rule that immunizeslocal officials from obligations that might be imposed on ordinary citizens.2 Indeed, it would be more reasonable to infer

1 Indeed, the Framers repeatedly rejected proposed changes to the
Tenth Amendment that would have altered the text to refer to "powers
not expressly delegated to the United States." 3 W. Crosskey &
W. Jeffrey, Politics and the Constitution in the History of the United
States 36 (1980). This was done, as Madison explained, because "it was
impossible to confine a Government to the exercise of express powers;
there must necessarily be admitted powers by implication, unless the constitution descended to recount every minutia." 1 Annals of Cong. 790
(Aug. 18, 1789); see McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 406-407 (1819).

2 Recognizing the force of the argument, the Court suggests that this

reasoning is in error because--even if it is responsive to the submission
that the Tenth Amendment roots the principle set forth by the majority
today--it does not answer the possibility that the Court's holding can be
rooted in a "principle of state sovereignty" mentioned nowhere in the
constitutional text. See ante, at 923-924. As a ground for invalidating

important federal legislation, this argument is remarkably weak. The
majority's further claim that, while the Brady Act may be legislation
"necessary" to Congress' execution of its undisputed Commerce Clause
authority to regulate firearms sales, it is nevertheless not "proper" because it violates state sovereignty, see ibid., is wholly circular, and provides no traction for its argument. Moreover, this reading of the term

Stevens, J., dissenting
that federal law may impose greater duties on state officialsthan on private citizens because another provision of the

Constitution requires that "all executive and judicial Offi-cers, both of the United States and of the several States,
shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Con-stitution." Art. VI, cl. 3.

It is appropriate for state officials to make an oath or af-firmation to support the Federal Constitution because, as explained in The Federalist, they "have an essential agency ingiving effect to the federal Constitution." The Federalist
No. 44, p. 312 (E. Bourne ed. 1947) (J. Madison).3 There canbe no conflict between their duties to the State and those
owed to the Federal Government because Article VI unam-biguously provides that federal law "shall be the supreme
Law of the Land," binding in every State. U. S. Const., Art.
"proper" gives it a meaning directly contradicted by Chief Justice Marshall in McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316 (1819). As the Chief Justice explained, the Necessary and Proper Clause by "[i]ts terms purport[s]
to enlarge, not to diminish the powers vested in the government. It
purports to be an additional power, not a restriction on those already
granted." Id., at 420; see also id., at 418-419 (explaining that "the only
possible effect" of the use of the term "proper" was "to present to the
mind the idea of some choice of means of legislation not straitened and
compressed within . . . narrow limits").

Our ruling in New York that the Commerce Clause does not provide
Congress the authority to require States to enact legislation--a power
that affects States far closer to the core of their sovereign authority--
does nothing to support the majority's unwarranted extension of that reasoning today.

3 "It has been asked why it was thought necessary, that the State magistracy should be bound to support the federal Constitution, and unnecessary that a like oath should be imposed on the officers of the united states,
in favor of the State constitutions.

"Several reasons might be assigned for the distinction. I content myself with one, which is obvious and conclusive. The members of the federal government will have no agency in carrying the State constitutions
into effect. The members and officers of the State governments, on the
contrary, will have an essential agency in giving effect to the federal Constitution." The Federalist No. 44, at 312 (J. Madison).

VI, cl. 2. Thus, not only the Constitution, but every lawenacted by Congress as well, establishes policy for the States

just as firmly as do laws enacted by state legislatures.The reasoning in our unanimous opinion explaining why
state tribunals with ordinary jurisdiction over tort litigationcan be required to hear cases arising under the Federal Employers' Liability Act applies equally to local law enforce-ment officers whose ordinary duties parallel the modest obligations imposed by the Brady Act:

"The suggestion that the act of Congress is not in har-mony with the policy of the State, and therefore that the

courts of the State are free to decline jurisdiction, isquite inadmissible, because it presupposes what in legal
contemplation does not exist. When Congress, in theexertion of the power confided to it by the Constitution,
adopted that act, it spoke for all the people and all the
States, and thereby established a policy for all. Thatpolicy is as much the policy of Connecticut as if the act

had emanated from its own legislature, and should berespected accordingly in the courts of the State. As
was said by this court in Claflin v. Houseman, 93 U. S.130, 136, 137:

" `The laws of the United States are laws in the sev-eral States, and just as much binding on the citizens and
courts thereof as the State laws are. The United States
is not a foreign sovereignty as regards the severalStates, but is a concurrent, and, within its jurisdiction,

paramount sovereignty.' " Second Employers' Liability Cases, 223 U. S. 1, 57 (1912).

See also Testa v. Katt, 330 U. S. 386, 392 (1947).

There is not a clause, sentence, or paragraph in the entire
text of the Constitution of the United States that supportsthe proposition that a local police officer can ignore a command contained in a statute enacted by Congress pursuantto an express delegation of power enumerated in Article I.

II
Under the Articles of Confederation the National Govern-ment had the power to issue commands to the several sovereign States, but it had no authority to govern individualsdirectly. Thus, it raised an army and financed its operations
by issuing requisitions to the constituent members of theConfederacy, rather than by creating federal agencies to
draft soldiers or to impose taxes.That method of governing proved to be unacceptable, not
because it demeaned the sovereign character of the severalStates, but rather because it was cumbersome and inefficient.
Indeed, a confederation that allows each of its members todetermine the ways and means of complying with an overriding requisition is obviously more deferential to state sover-eignty concerns than a national government that uses its
own agents to impose its will directly on the citizenry. Thebasic change in the character of the government that the
Framers conceived was designed to enhance the power ofthe National Government, not to provide some new, unmentioned immunity for state officers. Because indirect controlover individual citizens ("the only proper objects of government") was ineffective under the Articles of Confederation,Alexander Hamilton explained that "we must

extend the au-thority of the Union to the persons of the citizens." The

Federalist No. 15, at 101 (emphasis added).Indeed, the historical materials strongly suggest that the
founders intended to enhance the capacity of the FederalGovernment by empowering it--as a part of the new authority to make demands directly on individual citizens--to actthrough local officials. Hamilton made clear that the new
Constitution, "by extending the authority of the federal headto the individual citizens of the several States, will enable
the government to employ the ordinary magistracy of eachin the execution of its laws." The Federalist No. 27, at 180.
Hamilton's meaning was unambiguous; the Federal Govern-ment was to have the power to demand that local officials

implement national policy programs. As he went on to
explain: "It is easy to perceive that this will tend to destroy,
in the common apprehension, all distinction between the
sources from which [the State and Federal Governments]
might proceed; and will give the federal government the
same advantage for securing a due obedience to its authority
which is enjoyed by the government of each State." Ibid.4

More specifically, during the debates concerning the ratification of the Constitution, it was assumed that state agents
would act as tax collectors for the Federal Government.
Opponents of the Constitution had repeatedly expressed
fears that the new Federal Government's ability to impose
taxes directly on the citizenry would result in an overbearing
presence of federal tax collectors in the States.5 Federalists
rejoined that this problem would not arise because, as Hamilton explained, "the United States . . . will make use of the
State officers and State regulations for collecting" certain

4 The notion that central government would rule by directing the actions
of local magistrates was scarcely a novel conception at the time of the
founding. Indeed, as an eminent scholar recently observed: "At the time
the Constitution was being framed . . . Massachusetts had virtually no
administrative apparatus of its own but used the towns for such purposes
as tax gathering. In the 1830s Tocqueville observed this feature of government in New England and praised it for its ideal combination of centralized legislation and decentralized administration." S. Beer, To Make
a Nation: The Rediscovery of American Federalism 252 (1993). This may
have provided a model for the expectation of "Madison himself . . . [that]
the new federal government [would] govern through the state governments, rather in the manner of the New England states in relation to their
local governments." Ibid.

5 See, e. g., 1 Debate on the Constitution 502 (B. Bailyn ed. 1993) (statement of "Brutus" that the new Constitution would "ope[n] a door to the
appointment of a swarm of revenue and excise officers to prey upon the
honest and industrious part of the community"); 2 id., at 633 (statement
of Patrick Henry at the Virginia Convention that "the salaries and fees of
the swarm of officers and dependants on the Government will cost this
Continent immense sums" and noting that "[d]ouble sets of [tax] collectors
will double the expence").

taxes. Id., No. 36, at 235. Similarly, Madison made clear
that the new central Government's power to raise taxes directly from the citizenry would "not be resorted to, except
for supplemental purposes of revenue . . . and that the eventual collection, under the immediate authority of the Union,
will generally be made by the officers . . . appointed by the
several States." Id., No. 45, at 318.6

The Court's response to this powerful historical evidence
is weak. The majority suggests that "none of these statements necessarily implies . . . Congress could impose these
responsibilities without the consent of the States." Ante, at
910-911 (emphasis deleted). No fair reading of these materials can justify such an interpretation. As Hamilton explained, the power of the Government to act on "individual
citizens"--including "employ[ing] the ordinary magistracy"
of the States--was an answer to the problems faced by a
central Government that could act only directly "upon the
States in their political or collective capacities." The Federalist, No. 27, at 179-180. The new Constitution would avoid
this problem, resulting in "a regular and peaceable execution
of the laws of the Union." Ibid.

This point is made especially clear in Hamilton's statement
that "the legislatures, courts, and magistrates, of the respective members, will be incorporated into the operations of the
national government as far as its just and constitutional
authority extends; and will be rendered auxiliary to the enforcement of its laws." Ibid. (second emphasis added). It
is hard to imagine a more unequivocal statement that state

6 Antifederalists acknowledged this response, and recognized the likelihood that the Federal Government would rely on state officials to collect
its taxes. See, e. g., 3 J. Elliot, Debates on the Federal Constitution 167-
168 (2d ed. 1891) (statement of Patrick Henry). The wide acceptance of
this point by all participants in the framing casts serious doubt on the
majority's efforts, see ante, at 915-916, n. 9, to suggest that the view that
state officials could be called upon to implement federal programs was
somehow an unusual or peculiar position.

judicial and executive branch officials may be required to im-plement federal law where the National Government acts

within the scope of its affirmative powers.7The Court makes two unpersuasive attempts to discount
the force of this statement. First, according to the majority,because Hamilton mentioned the Supremacy Clause without
specifically referring to any "congressional directive," thestatement does not mean what it plainly says.

Ante, at 912.But the mere fact that the Supremacy Clause is the source

of the obligation of state officials to implement congressionaldirectives does not remotely suggest that they might be " `incorporat[ed] into the operations of the national govern-ment,' " The Federalist No. 27, at 177 (A. Hamilton), before
their obligations have been defined by Congress. Federallaw establishes policy for the States just as firmly as laws
enacted by state legislatures, but that does not mean thatstate or federal officials must implement directives that have
not been specified in any law.8 Second, the majority sug-gests that interpreting this passage to mean what it says
would conflict with our decision in New York v. United
States. Ante, at 912. But since the New York opinion didnot mention The Federalist No. 27, it does not affect either

the relevance or the weight of the historical evidence pro-vided by No. 27 insofar as it relates to state courts and
magistrates.Bereft of support in the history of the founding, the Court
rests its conclusion on the claim that there is little evidencethe National Government actually exercised such a power in

8 Indeed, the majority's suggestion that this consequence flows "automatically" from the officers' oath, ante, at 912 (emphasis deleted), is entirely without foundation in the quoted text. Although the fact that the
Court has italicized the word "automatically" may give the reader the
impression that it is a word Hamilton used, that is not so.

the early years of the Republic. See ante, at 907-908. Thisreasoning is misguided in principle and in fact. While we

have indicated that the express consideration and resolutionof difficult constitutional issues by the First Congress in particular "provides `contemporaneous and weighty evidence' of
the Constitution's meaning since many of [its] Members . . .`had taken part in framing that instrument,' "

Bowsher v.
Synar, 478 U. S. 714, 723-724 (1986) (quoting Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U. S. 783, 790 (1983)), we have never suggested that
the failure of the early Congresses to address the scope offederal power in a particular area or to exercise a particular

authority was an argument against its existence. That position, if correct, would undermine most of our post-New Deal
Commerce Clause jurisprudence. As Justice O'Connor
quite properly noted in New York, "[t]he Federal Government undertakes activities today that would have been unimaginable to the Framers." 505 U. S., at 157.

More importantly, the fact that Congress did elect to rely
on state judges and the clerks of state courts to perform a
variety of executive functions, see ante, at 905-909, is surely
evidence of a contemporary understanding that their status
as state officials did not immunize them from federal service.
The majority's description of these early statutes is both incomplete and at times misleading.

For example, statutes of the early Congresses required in
mandatory terms that state judges and their clerks perform
various executive duties with respect to applications for citizenship. The First Congress enacted a statute requiring
that the state courts consider such applications, specifying
that the state courts "shall administer" an oath of loyalty to
the United States, and that "the clerk of such court shall
record such application." Act of Mar. 26, 1790, ch. 3, $ 1, 1
Stat. 103 (emphasis added). Early legislation passed by the
Fifth Congress also imposed reporting requirements relating
to naturalization on court clerks, specifying that failure to
perform those duties would result in a fine. Act of June 18,

950 PRINTZ v. UNITED STATES

Stevens, J., dissenting
1798, ch. 54, $ 2, 1 Stat. 567 (specifying that these obligations"shall be the duty of the clerk" (emphasis added)). Not long

thereafter, the Seventh Congress mandated that state courtsmaintain a registry of aliens seeking naturalization. Court
clerks were required to receive certain information fromaliens, record those data, and provide certificates to the aliens;
the statute specified fees to be received by local officials incompensation. Act of Apr. 14, 1802, ch. 28, $ 2, 2 Stat. 154-
155 (specifying that these burdens "shall be the duty of suchclerk" including clerks "of a . . . state" (emphasis added)).

9

Similarly, the First Congress enacted legislation requiringstate courts to serve, functionally, like contemporary regula9 The majority asserts that these statutes relating to the administration
of the federal naturalization scheme are not proper evidence of the original
understanding because over a century later, in Holmgren v. United States,
217 U. S. 509 (1910), this Court observed that that case did not present
the question whether the States can be required to enforce federal laws
"against their consent," id., at 517. The majority points to similar comments in United States v. Jones, 109 U. S. 513, 519-520 (1883). See ante,
at 906.

Those cases are unpersuasive authority. First, whatever their statements in dicta, the naturalization statutes at issue there, as made clear in
the text, were framed in quite mandatory terms. Even the majority only
goes so far as to say that "[i]t may well be" that these facially mandatory statutes in fact rested on voluntary state participation. Ibid. Any
suggestion to the contrary is belied by the language of the statutes
themselves.

Second, both of the cases relied upon by the majority rest on nowrejected doctrine. In Jones, the Court indicated that various duties, including the requirement that state courts of appropriate jurisdiction hear
federal questions, "could not be enforced against the consent of the
States." 109 U. S., at 520. That view was unanimously resolved to the
contrary thereafter in the Second Employers' Liability Cases, 223 U. S.
1, 57 (1912), and in Testa v. Katt, 330 U. S. 386 (1947).

Finally, the Court suggests that the obligation set forth in the latter
two cases that state courts hear federal claims is "voluntary" in that
States need not create courts of ordinary jurisdiction. That is true, but
unhelpful to the majority. If a State chooses to have no local law enforcement officials it may avoid the Brady Act's requirements, and if it chooses
to have no courts it may avoid Testa. But neither seems likely.

tory agencies in certifying the seaworthiness of vessels.Act of July 20, 1790, ch. 29, $ 3, 1 Stat. 132-133. The majority casts this as an adjudicative duty, ante, at 907, but thatcharacterization is misleading. The law provided that upon
a complaint raised by a ship's crew members, the state courtswere (if no federal court was proximately located) to appoint
an investigative committee of three persons "most skilful inmaritime affairs" to report back. On this basis, the judge
was to determine whether the ship was fit for its intendedvoyage. The statute sets forth, in essence, procedures for
an expert inquisitorial proceeding, supervised by a judge butotherwise more characteristic of executive activity.

10

The Court assumes that the imposition of such essentiallyexecutive duties on state judges and their clerks sheds no

light on the question whether executive officials might havean immunity from federal obligations.

Ibid. Even assum-ing that the enlistment of state judges in their judicial role

for federal purposes is irrelevant to the question whetherexecutive officials may be asked to perform the same function--a claim disputed below, see infra, at 968-970--the ma-jority's analysis is badly mistaken.

We are far truer to the historical record by applying afunctional approach in assessing the role played by these
early state officials. The use of state judges and their clerksto perform executive functions was, in historical context,
hardly unusual. As one scholar has noted, "two centuriesago, state and local judges and associated judicial personnel

10 Other statutes mentioned by the majority are also wrongly miscategorized as involving essentially judicial matters. For example, the Fifth
Congress enacted legislation requiring state courts to serve as repositories for reporting what amounted to administrative claims against the
United States Government, under a statute providing compensation in
land to Canadian refugees who had supported the United States during
the Revolutionary War. Contrary to the majority's suggestion, that statute did not amount to a requirement that state courts adjudicate claims,
see ante, at 908, n. 2; final decisions as to appropriate compensation were
made by federal authorities, see Act of Apr. 7, 1798, ch. 26, $ 3, 1 Stat. 548.

Colum. L. Rev. 1001, 1045, n. 176 (1995). And, of course,
judges today continue to perform a variety of functions that
may more properly be described as executive. See, e. g.,
Forrester v. White, 484 U. S. 219, 227 (1988) (noting "intelligible distinction between judicial acts and the administrative,
legislative, or executive functions that judges may on occasion be assigned by law to perform"). The majority's insistence that this evidence of federal enlistment of state officials
to serve executive functions is irrelevant simply because the
assistance of "judges" was at issue rests on empty formalistic
reasoning of the highest order.11

The Court's evaluation of the historical evidence, furthermore, fails to acknowledge the important difference between

11 Able to muster little response other than the bald claim that this argument strikes the majority as "doubtful," ante, at 908, n. 2, the Court proceeds to attack the basic point that the statutes discussed above called
state judges to serve what were substantially executive functions. The
argument has little force. The majority's view that none of the statutes
referred to in the text required judges to perform anything other than
"quintessentially adjudicative tasks[s]," ibid., is quite wrong. The evaluation of applications for citizenship and the acceptance of Revolutionary
War claims, for example, both discussed above, are hard to characterize
as the sort of adversarial proceedings to which common-law courts are
accustomed. As for the majority's suggestion that the substantial administrative requirements imposed on state-court clerks under the naturalization statutes are merely "ancillary" and therefore irrelevant, this conclusion is in considerable tension with the Court's holding that the minor
burden imposed by the Brady Act violates the Constitution. Finally, the
majority's suggestion that the early statute requiring state courts to assess the seaworthiness of vessels is essentially adjudicative in nature is
not compelling. Activities of this sort, although they may bear some resemblance to traditional common-law adjudication, are far afield from the
classical model of adversarial litigation.

policy decisions that may have been influenced by respect forstate sovereignty concerns, and decisions that are compelled

by the Constitution.12 Thus, for example, the decision byCongress to give President Wilson the authority to utilize
the services of state officers in implementing the World WarI draft, see Act of May 18, 1917, ch. 15, $ 6, 40 Stat. 80-81,
surely indicates that the National Legislature saw no constitutional impediment to the enlistment of state assistanceduring a federal emergency. The fact that the President

was able to implement the program by respectfully "request-[ing]" state action, rather than bluntly commanding it, is evidence that he was an effective statesman, but surely doesnot indicate that he doubted either his or Congress' power
to use mandatory language if necessary.13 If there weremerit to the Court's appraisal of this incident, one would
assume that there would have been some contemporarycomment on the supposed constitutional concern that hypothetically might have motivated the President's choice of
language.14

12 Indeed, an entirely appropriate concern for the prerogatives of state
government readily explains Congress' sparing use of this otherwise
"highly attractive," ante, at 905, 908, power. Congress' discretion, contrary to the majority's suggestion, indicates not that the power does not
exist, but rather that the interests of the States are more than sufficiently
protected by their participation in the National Government. See infra,
at 956-957.

13 Indeed, the very commentator upon whom the majority relies noted

that the "President might, under the act, have issued orders directly to
every state officer, and this would have been, for war purposes, a justifiable Congressional grant of all state powers into the President's hands."
Note, The President, The Senate, The Constitution, and the Executive
Order of May 8, 1926, 21 U. Ill. L. Rev. 142, 144 (1926).

14 Even less probative is the Court's reliance on the decision by Congress

to authorize federal marshals to rent temporary jail facilities instead of
insisting that state jailkeepers house federal prisoners at federal expense.
See ante, at 909-910. The majority finds constitutional significance in the
fact that the First Congress (apparently following practice appropriate
under the Articles of Confederation) had issued a request to state legisla521US2 Unit: $U94 [11-20-99 17:18:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN

The Court concludes its review of the historical materials
with a reference to the fact that our decision in INS v.
Chadha, 462 U. S. 919 (1983), invalidated a large number of
statutes enacted in the 1970's, implying that recent enactments by Congress that are similar to the Brady Act are
not entitled to any presumption of validity. But in Chadha,
unlike these cases, our decision rested on the Constitution's
express bicameralism and presentment requirements, id., at
946, not on judicial inferences drawn from a silent text and
a historical record that surely favors the congressional understanding. Indeed, the majority's opinion consists almost
entirely of arguments against the substantial evidence
weighing in opposition to its view; the Court's ruling is strikingly lacking in affirmative support. Absent even a modicum of textual foundation for its judicially crafted constitutional rule, there should be a presumption that if the
Framers had actually intended such a rule, at least one of
them would have mentioned it.15

tures rather than a command to state jailkeepers, see Resolution of Sept.
29, 1789, 1 Stat. 96, and the further fact that it chose not to change that
request to a command 18 months later, see Resolution of Mar. 3, 1791, 1
Stat. 225. The Court does not point us to a single comment by any Member of Congress suggesting that either decision was motivated in the
slightest by constitutional doubts. If this sort of unexplained congressional action provides sufficient historical evidence to support the fashioning of judge-made rules of constitutional law, the doctrine of judicial restraint has a brief, though probably colorful, life expectancy.

15 Indeed, despite the exhaustive character of the Court's response to

this dissent, it has failed to find even an iota of evidence that any of the
Framers of the Constitution or any Member of Congress who supported
or opposed the statutes discussed in the text ever expressed doubt as to
the power of Congress to impose federal responsibilities on local judges or
police officers. Even plausible rebuttals of evidence consistently pointing
in the other direction are no substitute for affirmative evidence. In short,
a neutral historian would have to conclude that the Court's discussion of
history does not even begin to establish a prima facie case.

The Court's "structural" arguments are not sufficient to
rebut that presumption. The fact that the Framers intended to preserve the sovereignty of the several States simply does not speak to the question whether individual state
employees may be required to perform federal obligations,
such as registering young adults for the draft, 40 Stat. 80-81,
creating state emergency response commissions designed to
manage the release of hazardous substances, 42 U. S. C.

$$ 11001, 11003, collecting and reporting data on underground storage tanks that may pose an environmental
hazard, $ 6991a, and reporting traffic fatalities, 23 U. S. C.

$ 402(a), and missing children, 42 U. S. C. $ 5779(a), to a federal agency.16

16 The majority's argument is particularly peculiar because these cases
do not involve the enlistment of state officials at all, but only an effort to
have federal policy implemented by officials of local government. Both
Sheriffs Printz and Mack are county officials. Given that the Brady Act
places its interim obligations on chief law enforcement officers (CLEO's),
who are defined as "the chief of police, the sheriff, or an equivalent officer,"
18 U. S. C. $ 922(s)(8), it seems likely that most cases would similarly involve local government officials.

This Court has not had cause in its recent federalism jurisprudence to
address the constitutional implications of enlisting nonstate officials for
federal purposes. (We did pass briefly on the issue in a footnote in National League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U. S. 833, 855, n. 20 (1976), but that
case was overruled in its entirety by Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan
Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528 (1985). The question was not called to
our attention in Garcia itself.) It is therefore worth noting that the majority's decision is in considerable tension with our Eleventh Amendment
sovereign immunity cases. Those decisions were designed to "accor[d]
the States the respect owed them as members of the federation." Puerto
Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., 506 U. S.

solely at the whim and behest of their State," Port Authority TransHudson Corp. v. Feeney, 495 U. S. 299, 313 (1990) (Brennan, J., concurring

Stevens, J., dissenting
As we explained in Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan
Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528 (1985): "[T]he principal
means chosen by the Framers to ensure the role of the Statesin the federal system lies in the structure of the Federal

Government itself. It is no novelty to observe that the composition of the Federal Government was designed in largepart to protect the States from overreaching by Congress."

Id., at 550-551. Given the fact that the Members of Con-gress are elected by the people of the several States, with
each State receiving an equivalent number of Senators inorder to ensure that even the smallest States have a powerful voice in the Legislature, it is quite unrealistic to assumethat they will ignore the sovereignty concerns of their constituents. It is far more reasonable to presume that their
decisions to impose modest burdens on state officials fromtime to time reflect a considered judgment that the people

in each of the States will benefit therefrom.

Indeed, the presumption of validity that supports all congressional enactments 17 has added force with respect to polconstrue the Amendment to afford protection to political subdivisions such
as counties and municipalities." Lake Country Estates, Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, 440 U. S. 391, 401 (1979); see also Hess v. Port
Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation, 513 U. S. 30, 47 (1994). Even if
the protections that the majority describes as rooted in the Tenth Amendment ought to benefit state officials, it is difficult to reconcile the decision
to extend these principles to local officials with our refusal to do so in
the Eleventh Amendment context. If the federal judicial power may be
exercised over local government officials, it is hard to see why they are
not subject to the legislative power as well.

17 "Whenever called upon to judge the constitutionality of an Act of Congress--`the gravest and most delicate duty that this Court is called upon
to perform,' Blodgett v. Holden, 275 U. S. 142, 148 (1927) (Holmes, J.)--
the Court accords `great weight to the decisions of Congress.' Columbia

icy judgments concerning the impact of a federal statuteupon the respective States. The majority points to nothing

suggesting that the political safeguards of federalism identi-fied in

Garcia need be supplemented by a rule, grounded in
neither constitutional history nor text, flatly prohibiting the
National Government from enlisting state and local officialsin the implementation of federal law.

Recent developments demonstrate that the political safe-guards protecting Our Federalism are effective. The majority expresses special concern that were its rule not adoptedthe Federal Government would be able to avail itself of the
services of state government officials "at no cost to itself."
Ante, at 922; see also ante, at 930 (arguing that "Members of
Congress can take credit for `solving' problems without having to ask their constituents to pay for the solutions withhigher federal taxes"). But this specific problem of federal

actions that have the effect of imposing so-called "unfunded
mandates" on the States has been identified and meaningfully addressed by Congress in recent legislation.18 See Unwe must have `due regard to the fact that this Court is not exercising a
primary judgment but is sitting in judgment upon those who also have
taken the oath to observe the Constitution and who have the responsibility
for carrying on government.' " Rostker v. Goldberg, 453 U. S. 57, 64
(1981).

18 The majority also makes the more general claim that requiring state

officials to carry out federal policy causes States to "tak[e] the blame" for
failed programs. Ante, at 930. The Court cites no empirical authority
to support the proposition, relying entirely on the speculations of a law
review article. This concern is vastly overstated.

Unlike state legislators, local government executive officials routinely
take action in response to a variety of sources of authority: local ordinance,
state law, and federal law. It doubtless may therefore require some sophistication to discern under which authority an executive official is acting,
just as it may not always be immediately obvious what legal source of
authority underlies a judicial decision. In both cases, affected citizens
must look past the official before them to find the true cause of their grievance. See FERC v. Mississippi, 456 U. S. 742, 785 (1982) (O'Connor, J.,

funded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, Pub. L. 104-4, 109Stat. 48.

The statute was designed "to end the imposition, in theabsence of full consideration by Congress, of Federal mandates on State . . . governments without adequate Federalfunding, in a manner that may displace other essential State
. . . governmental priorities." 2 U. S. C. $ 1501(2) (1994 ed.,Supp. II). It functions,

inter alia, by permitting Membersof Congress to raise an objection by point of order to a pending bill that contains an "unfunded mandate," as defined bythe statute, of over $50 million.

19 The mandate may not

then be enacted unless the Members make an explicit deci-sion to proceed anyway. See Recent Legislation, Unfunded

Mandates Reform Act of 1995, 109 Harv. L. Rev. 1469 (1996)(describing functioning of statute). Whatever the ultimate
impact of the new legislation, its passage demonstrates that
because legislators have "the power to choose subjects for legislation").
But the majority's rule neither creates nor alters this basic truth.

The problem is of little real consequence in any event, because to the
extent that a particular action proves politically unpopular, we may be
confident that elected officials charged with implementing it will be quite
clear to their constituents where the source of the misfortune lies. These
cases demonstrate the point. Sheriffs Printz and Mack have made public
statements, including their decisions to serve as plaintiffs in these actions,
denouncing the Brady Act. See, e. g., Shaffer, Gun Suit Shoots Sheriff
into Spotlight, Arizona Republic, July 5, 1994, p. B1; Downs, Most Gun
Dealers Shrug off Proposal to Raise License Fee, Missoulian, Jan. 5, 1994.
Indeed, Sheriff Mack has written a book discussing his views on the issue.
See R. Mack & T. Walters, From My Cold Dead Fingers: Why America
Needs Guns (1994). Moreover, we can be sure that CLEO's will inform
disgruntled constituents who have been denied permission to purchase a
handgun about the origins of the Brady Act requirements. The Court's
suggestion that voters will be confused over who is to "blame" for the
statute reflects a gross lack of confidence in the electorate that is at war
with the basic assumptions underlying any democratic government.

19 Unlike the majority's judicially crafted rule, the statute excludes from

its coverage bills in certain subject areas, such as emergency matters,

unelected judges are better off leaving the protection of fed-eralism to the political process in all but the most extraordinary circumstances.20Perversely, the majority's rule seems more likely to damage than to preserve the safeguards against tyranny pro-vided by the existence of vital state governments. By limiting the ability of the Federal Government to enlist stateofficials in the implementation of its programs, the Court creates incentives for the National Government to aggrandizeitself. In the name of State's rights, the majority would
have the Federal Government create vast national bureauc-racies to implement its policies. This is exactly the sort of
thing that the early Federalists promised would not occur,in part as a result of the National Government's ability to
rely on the magistracy of the States. See, e. g., The Federal-ist No. 36, at 234-235 (A. Hamilton); id., No. 45, at 318
(J. Madison).21With colorful hyperbole, the Court suggests that the unity
in the Executive Branch of the Federal Government "wouldbe shattered, and the power of the President would be sub20 The initial signs are that the Act will play an important role in curbing
the behavior about which the majority expresses concern. In the law's
first year, the Congressional Budget Office identified only five bills containing unfunded mandates over the statutory threshold. Of these, one
was not enacted into law, and three were modified to limit their effect on
the States. The fifth, which was enacted, was scarcely a program of the
sort described by the majority at all; it was a generally applicable increase
in the minimum wage. See Congressional Budget Office, The Experience
of the Congressional Budget Office During the First Year of the Unfunded
Mandates Reform Act 13-15 (Jan. 1997).

21 The Court raises the specter that the National Government seeks the

authority "to impress into its service . . . the police officers of the 50
States." Ante, at 922. But it is difficult to see how state sovereignty
and individual liberty are more seriously threatened by federal reliance
on state police officers to fulfill this minimal request than by the aggrandizement of a national police force. The Court's alarmist hypothetical is
no more persuasive than the likelihood that Congress would actually enact
any such program.

ject to reduction, if Congress could . . . requir[e] state officersto execute its laws." Ante, at 923. Putting to one side the

obvious tension between the majority's claim that impress-ing state police officers will unduly tip the balance of power
in favor of the federal sovereign and this suggestion that itwill emasculate the Presidency, the Court's reasoning contradicts New York v. United States.22That decision squarely approved of cooperative federalism
programs, designed at the national level but implementedprincipally by state governments.

New York disapproved ofa particular method of putting such programs into place, not

the existence of federal programs implemented locally. See505 U. S., at 166 ("Our cases have identified a variety of
methods . . . by which Congress may urge a State to adopt alegislative program consistent with federal interests"). Indeed, nothing in the majority's holding calls into question thethree mechanisms for constructing such programs that

NewYork expressly approved. Congress may require the States

to implement its programs as a condition of federal spend-ing,

23 in order to avoid the threat of unilateral federal action

in the area,24 or as a part of a program that affects Statesand private parties alike.

25 The majority's suggestion in response to this dissent that Congress' ability to create suchprograms is limited, ante, at 923, n. 12, is belied by the importance and sweep of the federal statutes that meet thisdescription, some of which we described in New York. See

22 Moreover, with respect to programs that directly enlist the local government officials, the majority's position rests on nothing more than a
fanciful hypothetical. The enactment of statutes that merely involve the
gathering of information, or the use of state officials on an interim basis,
do not raise even arguable separation-of-powers concerns.

23 See New York, 505 U. S., at 167; see, e. g., South Dakota v. Dole, 483

505 U. S., at 167-168 (mentioning, inter alia, the Clean WaterAct, the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, and the

Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976).Nor is there force to the assumption undergirding the
Court's entire opinion that if this trivial burden on state sovereignty is permissible, the entire structure of federalismwill soon collapse. These cases do not involve any mandate

to state legislatures to enact new rules. When legislativeaction, or even administrative rulemaking, is at issue, it may
be appropriate for Congress either to pre-empt the State'slawmaking power and fashion the federal rule itself, or to
respect the State's power to fashion its own rules. But
these cases, unlike any precedent in which the Court has
held that Congress exceeded its powers, merely involve the
imposition of modest duties on individual officers. The
Court seems to accept the fact that Congress could require
private persons, such as hospital executives or school administrators, to provide arms merchants with relevant information about a prospective purchaser's fitness to own a weapon;
indeed, the Court does not disturb the conclusion that flows
directly from our prior holdings that the burden on police
officers would be permissible if a similar burden were also
imposed on private parties with access to relevant data.
See New York, 505 U. S., at 160; Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528 (1985). A structural problem that vanishes when the statute affects private
individuals as well as public officials is not much of a structural problem.

Far more important than the concerns that the Court musters in support of its new rule is the fact that the Framers
entrusted Congress with the task of creating a working
structure of intergovernmental relationships around the
framework that the Constitution authorized. Neither explicitly nor implicitly did the Framers issue any command
that forbids Congress from imposing federal duties on private citizens or on local officials. As a general matter, Con521US2 Unit: $U94 [11-20-99 17:18:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN

gress has followed the sound policy of authorizing federal
agencies and federal agents to administer federal programs.
That general practice, however, does not negate the existence of power to rely on state officials in occasional situations
in which such reliance is in the national interest. Rather,
the occasional exceptions confirm the wisdom of Justice
Holmes' reminder that "the machinery of government would
not work if it were not allowed a little play in its joints."

Finally, the Court advises us that the "prior jurisprudence
of this Court" is the most conclusive support for its position.
Ante, at 925. That "prior jurisprudence" is New York v.
United States.26 The case involved the validity of a federal
statute that provided the States with three types of incentives to encourage them to dispose of radioactive wastes generated within their borders. The Court held that the first
two sets of incentives were authorized by affirmative grants
of power to Congress, and therefore "not inconsistent with
the Tenth Amendment." 505 U. S., at 173, 174. That holding, of course, sheds no doubt on the validity of the Brady
Act.

The third so-called "incentive" gave the States the option
either of adopting regulations dictated by Congress or of
taking title to and possession of the low level radioactive
waste. The Court concluded that, because Congress had no
power to compel the state governments to take title to the

presented here. Hodel simply reserved the question. See 452 U. S., at
288. The Court's subsequent opinion in FERC did the same, see 456
U. S., at 764-765; and, both its holding and reasoning cut against the majority's view in these cases.

Stevens, J., dissenting
waste, the "option" really amounted to a simple command tothe States to enact and enforce a federal regulatory program.

Id., at 176. The Court explained:

"A choice between two unconstitutionally coercive regu-latory techniques is no choice at all. Either way, `the

Act commandeers the legislative processes of the Statesby directly compelling them to enact and enforce a
federal regulatory program,' Hodel v. Virginia SurfaceMining & Reclamation Assn., Inc., supra, at 288, an
outcome that has never been understood to lie withinthe authority conferred upon Congress by the Constitution." Ibid.
After noting that the "take title provision appears to beunique" because no other federal statute had offered "a state

government no option other than that of implementing legis-lation enacted by Congress," the Court concluded that the
provision was "inconsistent with the federal structure of ourGovernment established by the Constitution." Id., at 177.

Our statements, taken in context, clearly did not decidethe question presented here, whether state executive officials--as opposed to state legislators--may in appropriatecircumstances be enlisted to implement federal policy. The
"take title" provision at issue in New York was beyond Con-gress' authority to enact because it was "in principle . . . no
different than a congressionally compelled subsidy fromstate governments to radioactive waste producers,"

id., at175, almost certainly a legislative Act.

The majority relies upon dictum in New York to the effectthat "[t]he Federal Government may not compel the States
to enact or administer a federal regulatory program." Id.,at 188 (emphasis added); see

ante, at 933. But that languagewas wholly unnecessary to the decision of the case. It is, of

course, beyond dispute that we are not bound by the dicta ofour prior opinions. See, e. g., U. S. Bancorp Mortgage Co. v.
Bonner Mall Partnership, 513 U. S. 18, 24 (1994) (Scalia, J.)("invoking our customary refusal to be bound by dicta"). To

the extent that it has any substance at all, New York's admin-istration language may have referred to the possibility that

the State might have been able to take title to and devise anelaborate scheme for the management of the radioactive
waste through purely executive policymaking. But despitethe majority's effort to suggest that similar activities are required by the Brady Act, see ante, at 927-928, it is hard tocharacterize the minimal requirement that CLEO's perform
background checks as one involving the exercise of substan-tial policymaking discretion on that essentially legislative
scale.27Indeed,

Justice Kennedy's recent comment about an-other case that was distinguishable from New York applies

to these cases as well:

"This is not a case where the etiquette of federalismhas been violated by a formal command from the Na27 Indeed, this distinction is made in the New York opinion itself. In
that case, the Court rejected the Government's argument that earlier decisions supported the proposition that "the Constitution does, in some circumstances, permit federal directives to state governments." New York,
505 U. S., at 178. But in doing so, it distinguished those cases on a ground
that applies to the federal directive in the Brady Act:

"[A]ll involve congressional regulation of individuals, not congressional
requirements that States regulate. . . .. . . . .

"[T]he cases relied upon by the United States hold only that federal
law is enforceable in state courts and that federal courts may in proper
circumstances order state officials to comply with federal law, propositions
that by no means imply any authority on the part of Congress to mandate
state regulation." Id., at 178-179.

The Brady Act contains no command directed to a sovereign State or to a
state legislature. It does not require any state entity to promulgate any
federal rule. In these cases, the federal statute is not even being applied
to any state official. See n. 16, supra. It is a "congressional regulation
of individuals," New York, 505 U. S., at 178, including gun retailers and
local police officials. Those officials, like the judges referred to in the New
York opinion, are bound by the Supremacy Clause to comply with federal
law. Thus if we accept the distinction identified in the New York opinion
itself, that decision does not control the disposition of these cases.

Lopez, 514 U. S., at 583 (concurringopinion).

In response to this dissent, the majority asserts that the
difference between a federal command addressed to individu-als and one addressed to the State itself "cannot be a constitutionally significant one." Ante, at 930. But as I have already noted, n. 16, supra, there is abundant authority in ourEleventh Amendment jurisprudence recognizing a constitutional distinction between local government officials, such asthe CLEO's who brought this action, and state entities that

are entitled to sovereign immunity. To my knowledge, noone has previously thought that the distinction "disembowels," ante, at 931, the Eleventh Amendment.28Importantly, the majority either misconstrues or ignores
three cases that are more directly on point. In FERC v.
Mississippi, 456 U. S. 742 (1982), we upheld a federal statute
requiring state utilities commissions, inter alia, to take theaffirmative step of considering federal energy standards in a

manner complying with federally specified notice and comment procedures, and to report back to Congress periodi-cally. The state commissions could avoid this obligation

28 Ironically, the distinction that the Court now finds so preposterous
can be traced to the majority opinion in National League of Cities. See
426 U. S., at 854 ("[T]he States as States stand on a quite different footing
from an individual or a corporation when challenging the exercise of Congress' power to regulate commerce"). The fact that the distinction did
not provide an adequate basis for curtailing the power of Congress to
extend the coverage of the Fair Labor Standards Act to state employees
does not speak to the question whether it may identify a legitimate difference between a directive to local officers to provide information or assistance to the Federal Government and a directive to a State to enact
legislation.

only by ceasing regulation in the field, a "choice" that werecognized was realistically foreclosed, since Congress had

put forward no alternative regulatory scheme to govern thisvery important area. Id., at 764, 766, 770. The burden on
state officials that we approved in FERC was far more ex-tensive than the minimal, temporary imposition posed by the
Brady Act.29Similarly, in

Puerto Rico v. Branstad, 483 U. S. 219 (1987),we overruled our earlier decision in Kentucky v. Dennison,

24 How. 66 (1861), and held that the Extradition Act of 1793permitted the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico to seek extradition of a fugitive from its laws without constitutional bar-rier. The Extradition Act, as the majority properly concedes, plainly imposes duties on state executive officers.See

ante, at 908-909. The majority suggests that this stat-ute is nevertheless of little importance because it simply constitutes an implementation of the authority granted the Na-tional Government by the Constitution's Extradition Clause,
Art. IV, $ 2. But in Branstad we noted ambiguity as towhether Puerto Rico benefits from that Clause, which applies on its face only to "States." Avoiding the question ofthe Clause's applicability, we held simply that under the Extradition Act Puerto Rico had the power to request that theState of Iowa deliver up the fugitive the Commonwealth
sought. 483 U. S., at 229-230. Although Branstad reliedon the authority of the Act alone, without the benefit of the

never has sanctioned explicitly a federal command to the States to promulgate and enforce laws and regulations . . . ." FERC, 456 U. S., at 761-762.
But the Court truncates this quotation in a grossly misleading fashion.
We continued by noting in that very sentence that "there are instances
where the Court has upheld federal statutory structures that in effect
directed state decisionmakers to take or to refrain from taking certain
actions." Ibid. Indeed, the Court expressly rejected as "rigid and isolated," id., at 761, our suggestion long ago in Kentucky v. Dennison, 24
How. 66, 107 (1861), that Congress "has no power to impose on a State
officer, as such, any duty whatever."

Extradition Clause, we noted no barrier to our decision inthe principles of federalism--despite the fact that one Member of the Court brought the issue to our attention, see id.,at 231 (

Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in
judgment).30Finally, the majority provides an incomplete explanation

of our decision in Testa v. Katt, 330 U. S. 386 (1947), and
demeans its importance. In that case the Court unani-mously held that state courts of appropriate jurisdiction

must occupy themselves adjudicating claims brought by pri-vate litigants under the federal Emergency Price Control
Act of 1942, regardless of how otherwise crowded their dock-ets might be with state-law matters. That is a much greater
imposition on state sovereignty than the Court's character-ization of the case as merely holding that "state courts cannot refuse to apply federal law," ante, at 928. That characterization describes only the narrower duty to apply federal law
in cases that the state courts have consented to entertain.

30 Moreover, Branstad unequivocally rejected an important premise that
resonates throughout the majority opinion: namely, that because the
States retain their sovereignty in areas that are unregulated by federal
law, notions of comity rather than constitutional power govern any direction by the National Government to state executive or judicial officers.
That construct was the product of the ill-starred opinion of Chief Justice
Taney in Kentucky v. Dennison, 24 How. 66 (1861), announced at a time
when "the practical power of the Federal Government [was] at its lowest
ebb," Branstad, 483 U. S., at 225. As we explained:

"If it seemed clear to the Court in 1861, facing the looming shadow of a
Civil War, that `the Federal Government, under the Constitution, has no
power to impose on a State officer, as such, any duty whatever, and compel
him to perform it,' 24 How., at 107, basic constitutional principles now
point as clearly the other way." Id., at 227.

"Kentucky v. Dennison is the product of another time. The conception
of the relation between the States and the Federal Government there announced is fundamentally incompatible with more than a century of constitutional development. Yet this decision has stood while the world of
which it was a part has passed away. We conclude that it may stand no
longer." Id., at 230.

Stevens, J., dissenting
The language drawn from the Supremacy Clause uponwhich the majority relies ("the Judges in every State shall

be bound [by federal law], any Thing in the Constitution orLaws of any state to the Contrary notwithstanding"), expressly embraces that narrower conflict of laws principle.Art. VI, cl. 2. But the Supremacy Clause means far more.
As Testa held, because the "Laws of the United States . . .[are] the supreme Law of the Land," state courts of appropriate jurisdiction must hear federal claims whenever a fed-eral statute, such as the Emergency Price Control Act, requires them to do so. Art. VI, cl. 2.Hence, the Court's textual argument is quite misguided.
The majority focuses on the Clause's specific attention to thepoint that "Judges in every State shall be bound." Ibid.
That language commands state judges to "apply federal law"in cases that they entertain, but it is not the source of their
duty to accept jurisdiction of federal claims that they wouldprefer to ignore. Our opinions in Testa, and earlier the Second Employers' Liability Cases, rested generally on the lan-guage of the Supremacy Clause, without any specific focus
on the reference to judges.31

31 As the discussion above suggests, the Clause's mention of judges was
almost certainly meant as nothing more than a choice-of-law rule, informing the state courts that they were to apply federal law in the event of a
conflict with state authority. The majority's quotation of this language,
ante, at 928-929, is quite misleading because it omits a crucial phrase that
follows the mention of state judges. In its entirety, the Supremacy
Clause reads: "This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which
shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall
be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme
Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby,
any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any state to the Contrary notwithstanding." Art. VI, cl. 2 (emphasis added). The omitted language,
in my view, makes clear that the specific reference to judges was designed
to do nothing more than state a choice-of-law principle. The fact that our
earliest opinions in this area, see Testa; Second Employers' Liability
Cases, written at a time when the question was far more hotly contested

Stevens, J., dissenting
The majority's reinterpretation of Testa also contradictsour decision in FERC. In addition to the holding mentioned

earlier, see supra, at 965-966, we also approved in that caseprovisions of federal law requiring a state utilities commission to "adjudicate disputes arising under [a federal] statute." FERC, 456 U. S., at 760. Because the state commis-sion had "jurisdiction to entertain claims analogous to those"

put before it under the federal statute, ibid., we held that
Testa required it to adjudicate the federal claims. Although
the commission was serving an adjudicative function, thecommissioners were unquestionably not "judges" within the

meaning of Art. VI, cl. 2. It is impossible to reconcile theCourt's present view that

Testa rested entirely on the specific reference to state judges in the Supremacy Clause with
our extension of that early case in FERC.32Even if the Court were correct in its suggestion that it

was the reference to judges in the Supremacy Clause, rather
than the central message of the entire Clause, that dictated
the result in Testa, the Court's implied expressio unius ar-gument that the Framers therefore did

not intend to permit the enlistment of other state officials is implausible.Throughout our history judges, state as well as federal, have

merited as much respect as executive agents. The notionthat the Framers would have had no reluctance to "press

than it is today, did not rely upon that language lends considerable support
to this reading.

32 The Court's suggestion that these officials ought to be treated as

"judges" for constitutional purposes because that is, functionally, what
they are, is divorced from the constitutional text upon which the majority relies, which refers quite explicitly to "Judges" and not administrative officials. In addition, it directly contradicts the majority's position
that early statutes requiring state courts to perform executive functions
are irrelevant to our assessment of the original understanding because
"Judges" were at issue. In short, the majority's adoption of a proper functional analysis gives away important ground elsewhere without shoring
up its argument here.

I join Justice Stevens's dissenting opinion, but subjectto the following qualifications. While I do not find anything

the independence of judges, and so thought it particularly important to
emphasize that state judges were bound to apply federal law. The Framers would hardly have felt any equivalent need to state the then wellaccepted point, see supra, at 945-948, that the enlistment of state executive officials was entirely proper.

tion laws, for example, or such later instances as state sup-port for federal emergency action, see

ante, at 949-950; ante,
at 905-910, 916-917 (majority opinion). These illustrationsof state action implementing congressional statutes are consistent with the Government's positions, but they do not
speak to me with much force.In deciding these cases, which I have found closer than I

had anticipated, it is The Federalist that finally determinesmy position. I believe that the most straightforward reading of No. 27 is authority for the Government's position here,and that this reading is both supported by No. 44 and consistent with Nos. 36 and 45.

Hamilton in No. 27 first notes that because the new Constitution would authorize the National Government to bind individuals directly through national law, it could "employ the
ordinary magistracy of each [State] in the execution of its
laws." The Federalist No. 27, p. 174 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (A.
Hamilton). Were he to stop here, he would not necessarily
be speaking of anything beyond the possibility of cooperative
arrangements by agreement. But he then addresses the
combined effect of the proposed Supremacy Clause, U. S.
Const., Art. VI, cl. 2, and state officers' oath requirement,
U. S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 3, and he states that "the Legislatures, Courts and Magistrates of the respective members
will be incorporated into the operations of the national government, as far as its just and constitutional authority
extends; and will be rendered auxiliary to the enforcement
of its laws." The Federalist No. 27, at 174-175 (emphasis
in original). The natural reading of this language is not
merely that the officers of the various branches of state governments may be employed in the performance of national
functions; Hamilton says that the state governmental machinery "will be incorporated" into the Nation's operation,
and because the "auxiliary" status of the state officials will
occur because they are "bound by the sanctity of an oath,"
id., at 175, I take him to mean that their auxiliary functions

will be the products of their obligations thus undertaken to
support federal law, not of their own, or the States', unfettered choices.1 Madison in No. 44 supports this reading in

1 The Court offers two criticisms of this analysis. First, as the Court
puts it, the consequences set forth in this passage (that is, rendering state
officials "auxiliary" and "incorporat[ing]" them into the operations of the
Federal Government) "are said . . . to flow automatically from the officers'
oath," ante, at 912; from this, the Court infers that on my reading, state
officers' obligations to execute federal law must follow "without the necessity for a congressional directive that they implement it," ibid. But neither Hamilton nor I use the word "automatically"; consequently, there is
no reason on Hamilton's view to infer a state officer's affirmative obligation
without a textual indication to that effect. This is just what Justice
Stevens says, ante, at 948, and n. 8.

Second, the Court reads The Federalist No. 27 as incompatible with our
decision in New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144 (1992), and credits me
with the imagination to devise a "novel principle of political science," ante,
at 913, n. 5, "in order to bring forth disparity of outcome from parity of
language," ibid.; in order, that is, to salvage New York, by concluding that
Congress can tell state executive officers what to execute without at the
same time having the power to tell state legislators what to legislate.
But the Court is too generous. I simply realize that "parity of language"
(i. e., all state officials who take the oath are "incorporated" or are "auxiliar[ies]") operates on officers of the three branches in accordance with the
quite different powers of their respective branches. The core power of
an executive officer is to enforce a law in accordance with its terms; that
is why a state executive "auxiliary" may be told what result to bring
about. The core power of a legislator acting within the legislature's
subject-matter jurisdiction is to make a discretionary decision on what the
law should be; that is why a legislator may not be legally ordered to exercise discretion a particular way without damaging the legislative power
as such. The discretionary nature of the authorized legislative Act is
probably why Madison's two examples of legislative "auxiliary" obligation
address the elections of the President and Senators, see infra, at 973 (discussing The Federalist No. 44, p. 307 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (J. Madison)), not
the passage of legislation to please Congress.

The Court reads Hamilton's description of state officers' role in carrying
out federal law as nothing more than a way of describing the duty of state
officials "not to obstruct the operation of federal law," with the consequence that any obstruction is invalid. Ante, at 913. But I doubt that
Hamilton's English was quite as bad as all that. Someone whose virtue

his commentary on the oath requirement. He asks whystate magistrates should have to swear to support the National Constitution, when national officials will not be re-quired to oblige themselves to support the state counterparts. His answer is that national officials "will have noagency in carrying the State Constitutions into effect. The
members and officers of the State Governments, on the con-trary, will have an essential agency in giving effect to the
Federal Constitution." Id., No. 44, at 307 (J. Madison). Hethen describes the state legislative "agency" as action necessary for selecting the President, see U. S. Const., Art. II, $ 1,and the choice of Senators, see U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 3 (repealed by Amdt. 17). The Federalist No. 44, at 307. TheSupremacy Clause itself, of course, expressly refers to the
state judges' obligations under federal law, and other num-bers of The Federalist give examples of state executive
"agency" in the enforcement of national revenue laws.2
consists of not obstructing administration of the law is not described as
"incorporated into the operations" of a government or as an "auxiliary" to
its law enforcement. One simply cannot escape from Hamilton by reducing his prose to inapposite figures of speech.

2 The Court reads Madison's No. 44 as supporting its view that Hamilton

meant "auxiliaries" to mean merely "nonobstructors." It defends its position in what seems like a very sensible argument, so long as one does not
go beyond the terms set by the Court: if Madison really thought state
executive officials could be required to enforce federal law, one would have
expected him to say so, instead of giving examples of how state officials
(legislative and executive, the Court points out) have roles in the election
of national officials. See ante, at 914-915, and n. 8. One might indeed
have expected that, save for one remark of Madison's, and a detail of his
language, that the Court ignores. When he asked why state officers
should have to take an oath to support the National Constitution, he said
that "several reasons might be assigned," but that he would "content [himself] with one which is obvious & conclusive." The Federalist No. 44, at
307. The one example he gives describes how state officials will have "an
essential agency in giving effect to the federal Constitution." He was not
talking about executing congressional statutes; he was talking about putting the National Constitution into effect by selecting the executive and
legislative members who would exercise its powers. The answer to the

Souter, J., dissenting
Two such examples of anticipated state collection of fed-eral revenue are instructive, each of which is put forward to

counter fears of a proliferation of tax collectors. In No. 45,Hamilton says that if a State is not given (or declines to
exercise) an option to supply its citizens' share of a federaltax, the "eventual collection [of the federal tax] under the
immediate authority of the Union, will generally be made bythe officers, and according to the rules, appointed by the several States." Id., No. 45, at 313. And in No. 36, he explainsthat the National Government would more readily "employ
the State officers as much as possible, and to attach them to
Court's question (and objection), then, is that Madison was expressly
choosing one example of state officer agency, not purporting to exhaust
the examples possible.

There is, therefore, support in Madison's No. 44 for the straightforward
reading of Hamilton's No. 27 and, so, no occasion to discount the authority
of Hamilton's views as expressed in The Federalist as somehow reflecting
the weaker side of a split constitutional personality. Ante, at 915-916,
n. 9. This, indeed, should not surprise us, for one of the Court's own
authorities rejects the "split personality" notion of Hamilton and Madison
as being at odds in The Federalist, in favor of a view of all three Federalist
writers as constituting a single personality notable for its integration:

"In recent years it has been popular to describe Publius [the nominal
author of The Federalist] as a `split personality' who spoke through Madison as a federalist and an exponent of limited government, [but] through
Hamilton as a nationalist and an admirer of energetic government. . . .
Neither the diagnosis of tension between Hamilton and Madison nor the
indictment of each man for self-contradiction strikes me as a useful or
perhaps even fair-minded exercise. Publius was, on any large view--the
only correct view to take of an effort so sprawling in size and concentrated
in time--a remarkably `whole personality,' and I am far more impressed
by the large area of agreement between Hamilton and Madison than by
the differences in emphasis that have been read into rather than in their

papers. . . . The intellectual tensions of The Federalist and its creators are
in fact an honest reflection of those built into the Constitution it expounds
and the polity it celebrates." C. Rossiter, Alexander Hamilton and the
Constitution 58 (1964).

While Hamilton and Madison went their separate ways in later years,
see id., at 78, and may have had differing personal views, the passages
from The Federalist discussed here show no sign of strain.

the Union by an accumulation of their emoluments," id., No.36, at 228, than by appointing separate federal revenue

collectors.In the light of all these passages, I cannot persuade myself
that the statements from No. 27 speak of anything less than
the authority of the National Government, when exercisingan otherwise legitimate power (the commerce power, say),

to require state "auxiliaries" to take appropriate action. Tobe sure, it does not follow that any conceivable requirement
may be imposed on any state official. I continue to agree,for example, that Congress may not require a state legislature to enact a regulatory scheme and that New York v.
United States, 505 U. S. 144 (1992), was rightly decided (even
though I now believe its dicta went too far toward immunizing state administration as well as state enactment of such a
scheme from congressional mandate); after all, the essence
of legislative power, within the limits of legislative jurisdiction, is a discretion not subject to command. But insofar
as national law would require nothing from a state officer
inconsistent with the power proper to his branch of tripartite
state government (say, by obligating a state judge to exercise law enforcement powers), I suppose that the reach of
federal law as Hamilton described it would not be exceeded,
cf. Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority,
469 U. S. 528, 554, 556-567 (1985) (without precisely delineating the outer limits of Congress's Commerce Clause power,
finding that the statute at issue was not "destructive of
state sovereignty").

I should mention two other points. First, I recognize that
my reading of The Federalist runs counter to the view of
Justice Field, who stated explicitly in United States v. Jones,
109 U. S. 513, 519-520 (1883), that the early examples of state
execution of federal law could not have been required against
a State's will. But that statement, too, was dictum, and as
against dictum even from Justice Field, Madison and Hamilton prevail. Second, I do not read any of The Federalist

material as requiring the conclusion that Congress could re-quire administrative support without an obligation to pay

fair value for it. The quotation from No. 36, for example,describes the United States as paying. If, therefore, my
views were prevailing in these cases, I would remand for
development and consideration of petitioners' points, thatthey have no budget provision for work required under the

Act and are liable for unauthorized expenditures. Brieffor Petitioner in No. 95-1478, pp. 4-5; Brief for Petitioner in
No. 95-1503, pp. 6-7.

Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Stevens joins,
dissenting.

I would add to the reasons Justice Stevens sets forththe fact that the United States is not the only nation that

seeks to reconcile the practical need for a central authority
with the democratic virtues of more local control. At least
some other countries, facing the same basic problem, have
found that local control is better maintained through application of a principle that is the direct opposite of the principle
the majority derives from the silence of our Constitution.
The federal systems of Switzerland, Germany, and the European Union, for example, all provide that constituent states,
not federal bureaucracies, will themselves implement many
of the laws, rules, regulations, or decrees enacted by the central "federal" body. Lenaerts, Constitutionalism and the
Many Faces of Federalism, 38 Am. J. Comp. L. 205, 237

Union, 54 Md. L. Rev. 1658, 1675-1677 (1995). They do so
in part because they believe that such a system interferes
less, not more, with the independent authority of the "state,"
member nation, or other subsidiary government, and helps

Of course, we are interpreting our own Constitution, notthose of other nations, and there may be relevant political

and structural differences between their systems and our
own. Cf. The Federalist No. 20, pp. 134-138 (C. Rossiter ed.
1961) (J. Madison and A. Hamilton) (rejecting certain aspects
of European federalism). But their experience may nonetheless cast an empirical light on the consequences of different solutions to a common legal problem--in this case the
problem of reconciling central authority with the need to
preserve the liberty-enhancing autonomy of a smaller constituent governmental entity. Cf. id., No. 42, at 268 (J. Madison) (looking to experiences of European countries); id., No.
43, at 275, 276 (J. Madison) (same). And that experience
here offers empirical confirmation of the implied answer to a
question Justice Stevens asks: Why, or how, would what
the majority sees as a constitutional alternative--the creation of a new federal gun-law bureaucracy, or the expansion
of an existing federal bureaucracy--better promote either
state sovereignty or individual liberty? See ante, at 945,
959 (Stevens, J., dissenting).

As comparative experience suggests, there is no need to
interpret the Constitution as containing an absolute principle--forbidding the assignment of virtually any federal duty
to any state official. Nor is there a need to read the Brady
Act as permitting the Federal Government to overwhelm a
state civil service. The statute uses the words "reasonable
effort," 18 U. S. C. $ 922(s)(2)--words that easily can encom521US2 Unit: $U94 [11-20-99 17:18:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN

pass the considerations of, say, time or cost necessary toavoid any such result.

Regardless, as Justice Stevens points out, the Consti-tution itself is silent on the matter. Ante, at 944, 954, 961
(dissenting opinion). Precedent supports the Government'sposition here.

Ante, at 956, 960-961, 962-970 (Stevens, J.,dissenting). And the fact that there is not more precedent--that direct federal assignment of duties to state offi-cers is not common--likely reflects, not a widely shared belief that any such assignment is incompatible with basicprinciples of federalism, but rather a widely shared practice
of assigning such duties in other ways. See, e. g., South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U. S. 203 (1987) (spending power); Garciav. United States, 469 U. S. 70 (1984); New York v. United

States, 505 U. S. 144, 160 (1992) (general statutory duty);FERC v. Mississippi, 456 U. S. 742 (1982) (pre-emption).
See also ante, at 973-974 (Souter, J., dissenting). Thus,there is neither need nor reason to find in the Constitution
an absolute principle, the inflexibility of which poses a sur-prising and technical obstacle to the enactment of a law that
Congress believed necessary to solve an important nationalproblem.

For these reasons and those set forth in Justice Stevens'opinion, I join his dissent.

FOREMAN et al. v. DALLAS COUNTY, TEXAS,

et al.

on appeal from the united states district court forthe northern district of texas

No. 96-987. Decided June 27, 1997*
A Texas statute authorizes counties to appoint election judges to supervise

voting on election days. Since 1983, Dallas County has changed its appointment procedures several times, always using party-affiliation formulas. Appellants sued the county and others in the Federal District
Court, claiming that $ 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 required that
the most recent change be precleared. A three-judge court held that
preclearance was not required because the county was simply exercising
its discretion to adjust the procedure according to party power; concluded that the Justice Department's preclearance of a 1985 submission
of Texas' recodified election code operated to preclear the county's use
of partisan considerations; denied injunctive relief; and later dismissed
appellants' complaint.

Held: The District Court's decision is inconsistent with this Court's precedents. First, an administrative effort to comply with a precleared statute may require separate preclearance because $ 5 reaches informal,
as well as formal, changes. NAACP v. Hampton County Election
Comm'n, 470 U. S. 166, 178. Second, the State's 1985 submission--
which indicated that the only change being made to the statute was to
the beginning date and duration of the election judges' appointment--
was clearly insufficient to put the Justice Department on notice that the
State was seeking to preclear using partisan affiliations to select election judges. See, e. g., Young v. Fordice, 520 U. S. 273, 286-287. Because the record is silent as to the county's procedure for appointing
election judges on the date on which Texas became a covered jurisdiction under the Voting Rights Act, this Court cannot make a final determination whether preclearance is in fact required.

No. 96-987, dismissed and remanded; No. 96-1389, vacated and remanded.

Texas by statute authorizes counties to appoint electionjudges, one for each precinct, who supervise voting at the

polls on election days. In 1983 and several times thereafter,Dallas County changed its procedures for selecting these officials. Each of the new methods used party-affiliation for-mulas of one sort or another. After the most recent change
in 1996, appellants sued the county and others in the UnitedStates District Court, claiming that $ 5 of the Voting Rights
Act of 1965, 79 Stat. 439, as amended, 42 U. S. C. $ 1973c,required that the changes be precleared.

A three-judge court held that preclearance was not re-quired because the county was simply exercising, under the
state statute, its "discretion to adjust [the procedure for ap-pointing election judges] according to party power." App.
to Juris. Statement 4a. The court apparently concluded thatthis "discretionary" use of political power meant that the
various methods for selecting election judges were not cov-ered changes under $ 5. The court also concluded that the
Justice Department's preclearance of a 1985 submission fromthe State--the recodification of its entire election code--operated to preclear the county's use of partisan considerationsin selecting election judges. The court denied injunctive relief, and later dismissed appellants' complaint pursuant toFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Appellants have
brought both of these rulings here.We believe that the decision of the District Court is inconsistent with our precedents. First, in NAACP v. Hampton
County Election Comm'n, 470 U. S. 166, 178 (1985), we held
that even "an administrative effort to comply with a statute
that had already received clearance" may require separatepreclearance, because $ 5 "reaches informal as well as formal

changes." Thus, the fact that the county here was exercis-ing its "discretion" pursuant to a state statute does not shield
its actions from $ 5. The question is simply whether thecounty, by its actions, whether taken pursuant to a statute

521US2 Unit: $U95 [11-20-99 17:24:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Per Curiam
or not, "enact[ed] or [sought] to administer any . . . standard,practice, or procedure with respect to voting different from"

the one in place on November 1, 1972. $ 5. The fact thatthe county's new procedures used political party affiliation
as the selection criterion does not mean that the methodswere exempt from preclearance.

Second, the State's 1985 submission (the recodification anda 30-page summary of changes to the old law) indicated that
the only change being made to the statute concerning elec-tion judges was a change to "the beginning date and duration
of [their] appointment." Thus, neither the recodified statutenor the State's explanations said anything about the use of
specific, partisan-affiliation methods for selecting electionjudges. This submission was clearly insufficient under our
precedents to put the Justice Department on notice that theState was seeking preclearance of the use of partisan affiliations in selecting election judges. See, e. g., Young v.Fordice, 520 U. S. 273, 286-287 (1997); Lopez v. Monterey
County, 519 U. S. 9, 15 (1996); Clark v. Roemer, 500 U. S. 646,658-659 (1991).

Because the parties agree that the record is silent as tothe procedure used by Dallas County for appointing election
judges as of November 1, 1972, the date on which Texas be-came a covered jurisdiction under the Voting Rights Act, we
cannot make a final determination here as to whether pre-clearance is in fact required. We therefore vacate the judgment of the District Court in No. 96-1389, dismiss the appealfrom the District Court's interlocutory judgment in No. 96-

POUNDERS, JUDGE, SUPERIOR COURT OF CALI-FORNIA, LOS ANGELES COUNTY

v.PENELOPE WATSON

on petition for writ of certiorari to the unitedstates court of appeals for the ninth circuit

No. 96-1383. Decided June 27, 1997
Respondent represented William Mora during a multidefendant murder

trial in a California court. During the trial, the presiding judge, petitioner here, admonished counsel that the issue of the punishment defendants might receive if they were convicted was not open for discussion and should not be explored. When respondent brought up possible
punishment while questioning Mora, the judge found her in contempt,
concluding that the sole purpose of her questions was to improperly
advise the jury of the potential penalty in violation of the court's order,
that she was aware of the order, and that her conduct permanently prejudiced the jury. After her state habeas petitions were denied, the Federal District Court denied federal habeas relief, holding that multiple
statements made in open court gave respondent adequate warning as to
the prohibited conduct, thus satisfying due process notice requirements.
In reversing, the Ninth Circuit did not dispute the trial court's findings,
but held that respondent's conduct was not so disruptive as to justify
the use of summary contempt procedures.

Held: The Ninth Circuit erred in ruling that the contempt order went

beyond those necessities pertaining to the ordered administration of justice. Longstanding precedent confirms the courts' power to find summary contempt and impose punishment. See, e. g., Ex parte Terry, 128
U. S. 289. Since that power may be abused, summary contempt orders
are confined to misconduct occurring in court, In re Oliver, 333 U. S.
257, 275, where the affront to the court's dignity is more widely observed, justifying summary vindication, see In re Green, 369 U. S. 689,
692. However, nothing in this Court's cases supports the Ninth Circuit's requirements that a contemnor engage in a pattern of repeated
violations pervading the courtroom before she can be held in contempt

and that a court determine that a contemnor would have repeated the
misconduct but for summary punishment. To the contrary, this Court
upheld summary contempt convictions after a single refusal to give immunized testimony, United States v. Wilson, 421 U. S. 309, 314, and found
that the principle that the least possible power adequate to the end
proposed should be used in contempt cases was satisfied because a court

is justified in acting swiftly to prevent a breakdown of the proceedings
during an ongoing trial, id., at 319. Seriously prejudicing the jury, as
the trial court found here, is comparable in terms of damage to the
administration of justice to the refusals to testify in Wilson. There is
no need to explore here what limitations and standards due process
imposes on the authority to issue a summary contempt order, since respondent's conduct was well within the range of contumacious conduct
disruptive of judicial proceedings and damaging to the trial court's
authority.

In this case the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuitgranted respondent's habeas corpus petition and held invalid

on due process grounds her conviction for summary con-tempt before a state-court judge for conduct in open court.
The Court of Appeals misinterpreted the constitutional re-quirements for imposition of a summary contempt order.
We grant the petition for a writ of certiorari and reverse.Respondent Penelope Watson is an attorney who represented William Mora in a multidefendant murder trial in theSuperior Court of the State of California in and for the
County of Los Angeles. The Honorable William Pounderspresided over the case, and he is the petitioner here. On
April 7, 1994, counsel for one of Mora's codefendants repeat-edly raised in open court the issue of the punishment defendants might receive if they were convicted. Judge Poundersstated that possible punishment " `is not a subject that's open
to discussion. It should not be explored.' " App. to Pet. forCert. 20. Though it is not clear whether this was said at a
bench conference only or reiterated in open court, it seemsrespondent remained at the defense table during the bench
conference. Her co-counsel, Joseph Gutierrez, was at thebench on behalf of their client Mora. In later proceedings,
Judge Pounders noted that "Miss Watson is no more than sixfeet away from us when we're at the side bar conference.
She's at the end of the center table closest to the bench andonly a matter of feet away." Id., at 36.

On April 20, counsel for a different codefendant againraised the issue of punishment. Judge Pounders stated in

open court: " `[T]he subject of sentencing of Mr. Fernandezis not part of the conversation. But more than that, it is
prejudicial under [Cal. Evid. Code Ann. $ ]352 [(West 1966)].
It's not a subject the jury is entitled to discuss. This is nota death penalty case, so penalties are not something to discuss . . . .' " Id., at 21.The next day, respondent's co-counsel Gutierrez asked a
series of questions in which he stated that defendants were"looking at life in prison." At a bench conference, while
respondent remained at the defense table, Judge Pounderstold Gutierrez:

" `You had an ulterior motive in bringing out the amountof time [the witness] spent [in prison], and I think it's to
show the contrast between what he got and what yourclients may be facing. . . . I'm saying that's the last time
I want to hear anything about a sentence. . . . You've
covered it. Do not cover it again.' " Watson v. Block,102 F. 3d 433, 435 (CA9 1996).

After the side bar, Gutierrez apologized in open court:

" `Judge, I would just like the record to reflect that Iapologize to this court for asking the question as to or

informing this witness through my question that heserved six months in jail and three years probation. . . .
I obviously defied the Court Order, and I misunderstoodthe Court and I apologize.' "

Ibid.

In response, Judge Pounders said in open court: " `It's simplythat punishment is not an issue for this jury to decide, and

the more that counsel want to harp on this issue of punish-ment, the more inappropriate it becomes.' "

Ibid.
On June 21, while respondent was questioning Mora, thefollowing examination and colloquy occurred:

At that point, Judge Pounders called counsel to the bench.The judge asked respondent why he should not hold her in
contempt for discussing punishment after he had "at leasttwice ordered counsel not to cover" the issue. Respondent
replied, "I think it goes to [Mora's] state of mind as to whyhe would take this risk at this point in revealing that he
was the person who called 911." When the judge asked whyrespondent did not raise the point at sidebar, particularly
when her co-counsel Gutierrez had been admonished for rais-ing the issue, Watson responded: "I wasn't at side bar with
any of that involving Mr. Gutierrez . . . ." The judge said,"You're in violation of a court order. You do not think that's
relevant to anything?" Watson responded, "I didn't think itwas." Id., at 31, 32.

Judge Pounders then found respondent in contempt forviolating Cal. Civ. Proc. Code Ann. $ 1209(a)(5) (West 1997),

on April 7, 1994, when the initial warning was given, and

The court imposed a 2-day jail sentence to be served aftertrial.

On July 8, two days after the murder case was submitted
to the jury, Judge Pounders gave respondent another opportunity to justify her actions. She again explained and argued through her counsel that she thought her questions
were relevant and " `not covered by the court's previous rulings or admonitions.' " 102 F. 3d, at 436. Judge Pounders
was not convinced. Respondent, he noted, did not ask for a
side bar for clarification. He found:

" `I think she has permanently prejudiced this jury in
favor of her client. . . . They know the penalty he's facing
. . . and they know that the person that was killed [a
gang member] isn't worth that penalty, and so they are
not going to find him guilty of the major charge.. . . . .

" `And when the penalty is as extreme as this one is presented to the jury, I think that's a prejudice that cannot
be overcome. . . .

Ibid.

Respondent's habeas petitions to the California Court ofAppeal and the California Supreme Court were denied summarily. She filed this federal habeas corpus action in theUnited States District Court for the Central District of California. The District Court denied the petition on Septem-ber 8, 1994, finding "[t]he record makes it quite clear that
multiple statements made in open court gave Petitioner ade-quate warning to put a person of reasonable intelligence on
notice as to what conduct Judge Pounders had prohibited,satisfying due process notice requirements." App. to Pet.
for Cert. 15.Respondent appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, arguing that her due processrights were violated because she did not have notice of the
prohibited conduct and because the trial judge could nothave known without a hearing whether her conduct was willful. The Court of Appeals did not dispute the state trialcourt's findings on these points. Instead, it held that "her
conduct was not so disruptive as to justify use of summarycontempt procedure," 102 F. 3d, at 437.

Longstanding precedent confirms the power of courts tofind summary contempt and impose punishment. See, e. g.,
Ex parte Terry, 128 U. S. 289 (1888). In Cooke v. UnitedStates, 267 U. S. 517 (1925), the Court said:

"To preserve order in the court room for the proper con-duct of business, the court must act instantly to suppress disturbance or violence or physical obstruction ordisrespect to the court when occurring in open court.
There is no need of evidence or assistance of counselbefore punishment, because the court has seen the of521US2 Unit: $U96 [11-23-99 19:05:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN

fense. Such summary vindication of the court's dignityand authority is necessary. It has always been so in the

courts of the common law and the punishment imposedis due process of law." Id., at 534-535.

As we have recognized, however, the contempt power maybe abused. We have held the summary contempt exception
to the normal due process requirements, such as a hearing,counsel, and the opportunity to call witnesses, "includes only
charges of misconduct, in open court, in the presence of thejudge, which disturbs the court's business, where all of the
essential elements of the misconduct are under the eye of thecourt, are actually observed by the court, and where immediate punishment is essential to prevent `demoralization ofthe court's authority' before the public."

In re Oliver, 333U. S. 257, 275 (1948) (quoting Cooke, supra, at 536).

We have stressed the importance of confining summarycontempt orders to misconduct occurring in court. Where
misconduct occurs in open court, the affront to the court'sdignity is more widely observed, justifying summary vindication. See In re Green, 369 U. S. 689, 692 (1962) (relyingon due process cases);

Harris v. United States, 382 U. S. 162,164 (1965) (defining boundary between summary and ordinary contempt under Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 42).

United States v. Wilson, 421 U. S. 309 (1975), sheds lighton the case before us. In Wilson, the prosecution called two

witnesses who, in open court, refused to testify. The UnitedStates District Court granted immunity and ordered them
to answer. The witnesses still refused, and the court sum-marily held them in contempt. We noted that although the
witnesses' refusals to testify were "not delivered disrespect-fully,"

id., at 314, their conduct nevertheless justified sum-mary contempt under Rule 42(a). It was not intimated that

the contempt convictions there violated due process. "Theface-to-face refusal to comply with the court's order itself
constituted an affront to the court, and when that kind ofrefusal disrupts and frustrates an ongoing proceeding, as it

did here, summary contempt must be available to vindicatethe authority of the court . . . ."

Id., at 316. Even the dissent suggested contempt convictions would have been war-ranted if the witnesses had engaged in " `insolent tactics.' "

Id., at 326 (Brennan, J., dissenting) (quoting Harris, supra,
at 165).In this case the state trial court made an express finding

that respondent willfully refused to comply with the court'sorder. Again and again the trial court admonished counsel,
both in open court and at bench conferences when respond-ent was sitting a few feet away, not to discuss punishment.
After respondent asked her client whether he had been facing the death penalty, the court sustained an objection and
said: " `We've already talked about this at side bar. Follow
the Court's admonitions.' " App. to Pet. for Cert. 24. Undaunted, respondent's next question was, " `You're facing life
without possibility of parole?' " Id., at 25.

The Court of Appeals did not question the willfulness
finding in its opinion. 102 F. 3d, at 438 ("[W]e do not decide
the issue whether Ms. Watson willfully disobeyed a court
order"). Instead, the Court of Appeals held her conduct
was not sufficiently disruptive because she herself "did not
engage in a pattern of repeated violations that pervaded the
courtroom and threatened the dignity of the court" and because the record did not indicate she would have repeated
the references to punishment unless she were held in summary contempt. Ibid.

All that is before us is the ruling that respondent's conduct
was not disruptive enough to justify contempt, and on this
issue we are in disagreement with the Court of Appeals.
Nothing in our cases supports a requirement that a contemnor "engage in a pattern of repeated violations that pervaded
the courtroom," ibid., before she may be held in summary
contempt. To the contrary, in Wilson, the summary contempt convictions were upheld after a single refusal to give
immunized testimony, "not delivered disrespectfully." 421

U. S., at 314. We nevertheless held that the conduct there"disrupt[ed] and frustrat[ed] an ongoing proceeding."

Id.,
at 316. And we have not required that a court determine acontemnor would have repeated the misconduct but for summary punishment. While we have approved, in the context
of reviewing a federal contempt order, the equitable princi-ple that only " `the least possible power adequate to the end

proposed' should be used in contempt cases," id., at 319(quoting

Anderson v. Dunn, 6 Wheat. 204, 231 (1821)), we
found that principle satisfied in the circumstances in Wilsonbecause, during an ongoing trial, the court is justified in acting swiftly "to prevent a breakdown of the proceedings."421 U. S., at 319. Likewise, in

Sacher v. United States, 343
U. S. 1, 5 (1952), the Court upheld summary contempt convictions of counsel where the misconduct had the followingcharacteristics: "It took place in the immediate presence of

the trial judge; it consisted of breaches of decorum and dis-obedience in the presence of the jury of his orders and rulings upon the trial; the misconduct was professional in thatit was that of lawyers" and conviction was based "upon a
course of conduct long-continued in the face of warnings thatit was regarded by the court as contemptuous." See also
Groppi v. Leslie, 404 U. S. 496, 506 (1972). Cf. Illinois v.
Allen, 397 U. S. 337, 343 (1970) ("We believe trial judges confronted with disruptive, contumacious, stubbornly defiant
defendants must be given sufficient discretion to meet the
circumstances of each case").

Here the trial court expressly found that respondent's
questions had "permanently prejudiced the jury in favor of
her client" and that the prejudice "cannot be overcome."
The Court of Appeals glossed over the state-court finding,
saying "we can understand Judge Pounders' concern that her
two questions might prejudice jurors in favor of her client,"
102 F. 3d, at 438 (emphasis added). Seriously prejudicing
the jury is comparable in terms of damage to the administration of justice to the refusals to testify in Wilson. The trial

Stevens, J., dissenting
the jury--together with its assessment of the flagrance ofrespondent's defiance--support the finding of the need for

summary contempt to vindicate the court's authority.While the Due Process Clause no doubt imposes limits on
the authority to issue a summary contempt order, the States
must have latitude in determining what conduct so infectsorderly judicial proceedings that contempt is permitted. As

we have noted, we have used various phrases to describethe type of conduct required. We need not explore these
limitations and standards, however, for the conduct of coun-sel here was well within the range of contumacious conduct
disruptive of judicial proceedings and damaging to thecourt's authority. Advocacy that is "fearless, vigorous, and
effective," Sacher, supra, at 13, does not extend to disruptive
conduct in the course of trial and in knowing violation of aclear and specific direction from the trial judge.

On the record before us, the Court of Appeals was in error.It was error for the Court of Appeals to rule, as a matter of
law, that the contempt order went beyond those necessitiespertaining to the ordered administration of justice. The ruling of the Court of Appeals, not reviewed en banc, intro-duced uncertainty into routine proceedings of the many state
courts within the Court of Appeals' large geographical jurisdiction. The judgment is reversed.

It is so ordered.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Breyer joins,
dissenting.

As the Court correctly explains, the record supports the
conclusion that respondent defied a court order when she
asked two questions about her client's potential punishment.
I assume, therefore, that she acted in contempt of court.
The record also demonstrates, however, that no further misconduct or disruption of the trial occurred. The question
the Court of Appeals addressed was whether these circumstances justified a summary contempt proceeding conducted
by the judge before whom the contempt occurred. I do not

992 POUNDERS v. WATSON

Stevens, J., dissenting
agree with the Court that the answer to this question is soclear as to justify summary reversal.

In the majority of the cases relied on by the Court, thesummary contempt power was invoked to punish conduct
that threatened to disrupt the court's ongoing proceedings.
See, e. g., United States v. Wilson, 421 U. S. 309 (1975). Amore substantial question arises when the summary contempt proceeding is not invoked to prevent disruption of thetrial, but to punish action that has already occurred. As
Justice Frankfurter recognized in his dissenting opinion in
Sacher v. United States, 343 U. S. 1 (1952), concerns about
the adequacy of procedural safeguards are heightened incases involving summary contempt procedures:

"Summary punishment of contempt is concededly anexception to the requirements of Due Process. Necessity dictates the departure. Necessity must bound itslimits. In this case, the course of events to the very
end of the trial shows that summary measures were not
necessary to enable the trial to go on. Departure fromestablished judicial practice, which makes it unfitting for

a judge who is personally involved to sit in his own case,was therefore unwarranted. . . .

"This, then, was not a situation in which, even thougha judge was personally involved as the target of the contemptuous conduct, peremptory action against contem-nors was necessary to maintain order and to salvage the
proceedings. Where such action is necessary for the
decorous continuance of a pending trial, disposition byanother judge of a charge of contempt is impracticable.

Interruption for a hearing before a separate judge
would disrupt the trial and thus achieve the illicit purpose of a contemnor." Id., at 36-37, 39.

We recognized these limits to a court's summary contempt
power in In re McConnell, 370 U. S. 230 (1962), where we
granted plenary review and set aside a $100 contempt sanc521US2 Unit: $U96 [11-23-99 19:05:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN

993Cite as: 521 U. S. 982 (1997)
Stevens, J., dissenting
tion for conduct that was more disruptive (although argu-ably more justified) than what occurred in this case.* We

emphasized:

"To preserve the kind of trials that our system en-visages, Congress has limited the summary contempt

power vested in courts to the least possible power ade-quate to prevent actual obstruction of justice, and we
think that that power did not extend to this case." Id.,at 236.

Given that the respondent in this case asked two inappro-priate questions over the course of a three and a half month
long trial and that the trial continued without incident fortwo weeks after her contemptuous conduct, a substantial
question exists as to whether fair procedure required a hear-ing before another judge. Neither the Court nor the petitioner contends that this summary contempt power was ex-ercised to prevent the "actual obstruction of justice," such
that a hearing before an entirely disinterested judge wouldhave been impractical. Because I believe that these questions are important and not clearly answered by our prece-dents--indeed, the Court does not cite a single case that is
at all comparable to this one on its facts--it is unwise toanswer it without full briefing and argument.

Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.

*In McConnell, the judge had erroneously ruled that plaintiff's counsel
could not try a charge of conspiracy, holding that he must do so in a separate trial. To preserve his client's rights on appeal, counsel persisted in
asking questions in the presence of the jury regarding the conspiracy
charge. Counsel then refused to obey the judge's order to stop asking
the questions, and stated that he would continue to do so unless stopped
by the bailiff. After a recess, plaintiff's counsel returned to trial and
asked no more forbidden questions. Following trial, and after holding a
hearing, the trial judge summarily found counsel guilty of contempt and
imposed a jail sentence. On appeal, the Court of Appeals sustained the
convictions, but reduced the sentence to a fine of $100.

Clause. Washington v. Glucksberg, p. 702.

3. Redistricting plan for state legislature.--A new plan to redistrict
Florida Legislature did not unconstitutionally subordinate traditional districting principles to race. Lawyer v. Department of Justice, p. 567.

school teachers to parochial schools.--Because New York City's program
sending public school teachers into parochial schools to provide remedial
instruction to disadvantaged children under Title I of Elementary and

Aguilar v. Felton, 473 U. S. 402, and a portion of School Dist. of Grand
Rapids v. Ball, 473 U. S. 373, are overruled, and relief from District
Court's order enjoining use of Title I funds for such program is granted
under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(5). Agostini v. Felton, p. 203.

VII. Ex Post Facto Laws.

State Sexually Violent Predator Act.--Kansas Act does not constitute

Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 557. Glickman v. Wileman Brothers &
Elliott, Inc., p. 457.

2. Communications Decency Act of 1996--Internet transmission of

Dispute between Indian Tribe and State--Ownership of submerged
lands.--Doctrine of Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123, does not apply to eliminate Idaho's Eleventh Amendment immunity from a Tribe's suit for declaratory and injunctive relief to preclude state officials from interfering with
