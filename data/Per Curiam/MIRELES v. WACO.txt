A long line of this Court's precedents acknowledges that,generally, a judge is immune from a suit for money damages.See, e. g., Forrester v. White, 484 U. S. 219 (1988); Cleavingerv. Saxner, 474 U. S. 193 (1985); Dennis v. Sparks, 449 U. S. 24(1980); Supreme Court of Va. v. Consumers Union of UnitedStates, Inc., 446 U. S. 719 (1980); Butz v. Economou, 438 U. S.478 (1978); Stump v.

S. 547 (1967).1 Although unfairness and injustice to a litigant may result on occasion, "it is a general principle of the highest importance to the proper administrationof justice that a judicial officer, in exercising the authorityvested in him, shall be free to act upon his own convictions,without apprehension of personal consequences to himself."Bradley v. Fisher, 13 Wall. 335, 347 (1872).In this case, respondent Howard Waco, a Los AngelesCounty public defender, filed suit in the United States District Court for the Central District of California under Rev.Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, against petitioner, RaymondMireles, a judge of the California Superior Court, and twopolice officers, for damages arising from an incident in November 1989 at the Superior Court building in Van Nuys,Cal. Waco alleged that after he failed to appear for theinitial call of Judge Mireles' morning calendar, the judge,"angered by the absence of attorneys from his courtroom,"ordered the police officer defendants "to forcibly and withexcessive force seize and bring plaintiff into his courtroom."App. to Pet. for Cert. B-3, || 7(a). The officers allegedly"by means of unreasonable force and violence seize[d] plaintiff and remove[d] him backwards" from another courtroom where he was waiting to appear, cursed him, and calledhim "vulgar and offensive names," then "without necessity slammed" him through the doors and swinging gatesinto Judge Mireles' courtroom. Id., at B-4, || 7(c). JudgeMireles, it was alleged, "knowingly and deliberately approved and ratified each of the aforedescribed acts" of thepolice officers. Ibid. Waco demanded general and punitivedamages. Id., at B-5 and B-6.1 The Court, however, has recognized that a judge is not absolutely immune from criminal liability, Ex parte Virginia, 100 U. S. 339, 348-349(1880), or from a suit for prospective injunctive relief, Pulliam v. Allen,466 U. S. 522, 536-543 (1984), or from a suit for attorney's fees authorizedby statute, id., at 543-544.502us1$$2Z 08-21-96 15:21:53 PAGES OPINPGT11Cite as: 502 U. S. 9 (1991)Per CuriamJudge Mireles moved to dismiss the complaint as to him,pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and(6), for failure to state a claim upon which relief could begranted. The District Court dismissed the claim against thejudge and entered final judgment as to him, pursuant to Rule54(b), on grounds of "complete judicial immunity." App. toPet. for Cert. D-2. On Waco's appeal, the United StatesCourt of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed that judg-ment.Waco v. Baltad, 934 F. 2d 214 (1991). The court determined that Judge Mireles was not immune from suit be-cause his alleged actions were not taken in his judicialcapacity. It opined that Judge Mireles would have been acting in his judicial capacity if he had "merely directed theofficers to bring Waco to his courtroom without directingthem to use excessive force." Id., at 216. But "[i]f JudgeMireles requested and authorized the use of excessive force,then he would not be acting in his judicial capacity." Ibid.Taking the allegations of the complaint as true, as we doupon a motion to dismiss, we grant the petition for certiorariand summarily reverse.Like other forms of official immunity, judicial immunity isan immunity from suit, not just from ultimate assessmentof damages. Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U. S. 511, 526 (1985).Accordingly, judicial immunity is not overcome by allegations of bad faith or malice, the existence of which ordinarilycannot be resolved without engaging in discovery and eventual trial. Pierson v. Ray, 386 U. S., at 554 ("[I]mmunityapplies even when the judge is accused of acting maliciouslyand corruptly"). See also Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S.800, 815-819 (1982) (allegations of malice are insufficient toovercome qualified immunity).Rather, our cases make clear that the immunity is overcome in only two sets of circumstances. First, a judge is notimmune from liability for nonjudicial actions, i. e., actions nottaken in the judge's judicial capacity. Forrester v. White,484 U. S., at 227-229; Stump v. Sparkman, 435 U. S., at 360.502us1$$2Z 08-21-96 15:21:53 PAGES OPINPGT12 MIRELES v. WACOPer CuriamSecond, a judge is not immune for actions, though judicial innature, taken in the complete absence of all jurisdiction.Id., at 356-357; Bradley v. Fisher, 13 Wall., at 351.We conclude that the Court of Appeals erred in ruling thatJudge Mireles' alleged actions were not taken in his judicialcapacity. This Court inStump made clear that "whether anact by a judge is a `judicial' one relate[s] to the nature of theact itself, i. e., whether it is a function normally performedby a judge, and to the expectations of the parties, i. e.,whether they dealt with the judge in his judicial capacity."435 U. S., at 362. See also Forrester v. White, 484 U. S., at227-229. A judge's direction to court officers to bring a per-son who is in the courthouse before him is a function normally performed by a judge. See generally Cal. Civ. Proc.Code Ann. $$ 128, 177, 187 (West 1982 and Supp. 1991) (setting forth broad powers of state judges in the conduct ofproceedings).2 Waco, who was called into the courtroom forpurposes of a pending case, was dealing with Judge Mirelesin the judge's judicial capacity.Of course, a judge's direction to police officers to carry outa judicial order with excessive force is not a "function normally performed by a judge." Stump v. Sparkman, 435U. S., at 362. But if only the particular act in question wereto be scrutinized, then any mistake of a judge in excess ofhis authority would become a "nonjudicial" act, because animproper or erroneous act cannot be said to be normally per-formed by a judge. If judicial immunity means anything, it2 California Civ. Proc. Code Ann. $ 128 (West Supp. 1991) provides inpertinent part: "Every court shall have the power to do all of the following: . . . (5) To control in furtherance of justice, the conduct of its ministerial officers, and of all other persons in any manner connected with a judicial proceeding before it, in every matter pertaining thereto." See Ligdav. Superior Court of Solano County, 5 Cal. App. 3d 811, 826, 85 Cal. Rptr.744, 753 (1970) (public defender is " `ministerial officer' " and one of " `allother persons in any manner connected with a judicial proceeding' " withinthe meaning of $ 128, and may be ordered to appear to assist criminaldefendant).502us1$$2F 02-08-99 07:24:06 PAGES OPINPGT13Cite as: 502 U. S. 9 (1991)Stevens, J., dissentingmeans that a judge "will not be deprived of immunity be-cause the action he took was in error . . . or was in excess ofhis authority." Id., at 356. See also Forrester v. White, 484U. S., at 227 (a judicial act "does not become less judicial byvirtue of an allegation of malice or corruption of motive").Accordingly, as the language in Stump indicates, the relevantinquiry is the "nature" and "function" of the act, not the "actitself." 435 U. S., at 362. In other words, we look to theparticular act's relation to a general function normally performed by a judge, in this case the function of directing po-lice officers to bring counsel in a pending case before thecourt.Nor does the fact that Judge Mireles' order was carriedout by police officers somehow transform his action from "judicial" to "executive" in character. As Forrester instructs,it is "the nature of the function performed, not the identityof the actor who performed it, that inform[s] our immunityanalysis." 484 U. S., at 229. A judge's direction to an executive officer to bring counsel before the court is no moreexecutive in character than a judge's issuance of a warrantfor an executive officer to search a home. See Burns v.Reed, 500 U. S. 478, 492 (1991) ("[T]he issuance of a searchwarrant is unquestionably a judicial act").Because the Court of Appeals concluded that Judge Mireles did not act in his judicial capacity, the court did notreach the second part of the immunity inquiry: whetherJudge Mireles' actions were taken in the complete absenceof all jurisdiction. We have little trouble concluding thatthey were not. If Judge Mireles authorized and ratified thepolice officers' use of excessive force, he acted in excess ofhis authority. But such an action--taken in the very aid ofthe judge's jurisdiction over a matter before him--cannot besaid to have been taken in the absence of jurisdiction.The petition for certiorari is granted, and the judgment ofthe Court of Appeals is reversed.
