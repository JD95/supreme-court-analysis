Argued November 6, 1995--Decided January 17, 1996Respondent Lundy and his wife withheld from their 1987 wages substantially more in federal income taxes than they actually owed for thatyear, but they did not file their 1987 tax return when it was due, nordid they file a return or claim a refund of the overpaid taxes in thesucceeding 21/2 years. On September 26, 1990, the Commissioner ofInternal Revenue mailed Lundy a notice of deficiency for 1987. Somethree months later, the Lundys filed their joint 1987 tax return, whichclaimed a refund of their overpaid taxes, and Lundy filed a timely petition in the Tax Court seeking a redetermination of the claimed deficiency and a refund. The Tax Court held that where, as here, a taxpayer has not filed a tax return by the time a notice of deficiency ismailed, and the notice is mailed more than two years after the date onwhich the taxes are paid, a 2-year "look-back" period applies under 26U. S. C. $ 6512(b)(3)(B), and the court lacks jurisdiction to award a refund. The Fourth Circuit reversed, finding that the applicable lookback period in these circumstances is three years and that the Tax Courthad jurisdiction to award a refund.Held: The Tax Court lacks jurisdiction to award a refund of taxes paidmore than two years prior to the date on which the Commissionermailed the taxpayer a notice of deficiency, if, on the date that the noticewas mailed, the taxpayer had not yet filed a return. In these circumstances, the applicable look-back period under $ 6512(b)(3)(B) is twoyears. Pp. 239-253.(a) Section 6512(b)(3)(B) forbids the Tax Court to award a refund unless it first determines that the taxes were paid "within the [look-back]period which would be applicable under section 6511(b)(2) . . . if on thedate of the mailing of the notice of deficiency a claim [for refund] hadbeen filed." Section 6511(b)(2)(A) in turn instructs the court to apply a3-year look-back period if a refund claim is filed, as required by $ 6511(a),"within 3 years from the time the return was filed," while $ 6511(b)(2)(B)specifies a 2-year look-back period if the refund claim is not filed withinthat 3-year period. The Tax Court properly applied the 2-year lookback period to Lundy's case because, as of September 26, 1990 (the datethe notice of deficiency was mailed), Lundy had not filed a tax return,516us2$18Z 10-22-98 12:19:08 PAGES OPINPGT236 COMMISSIONER v. LUNDYSyllabusand, consequently, a claim filed on that date would not be filed withinthe 3-year period described in $ 6511(a). Lundy's taxes were withheldfrom his wages, so they are deemed paid on the date his 1987 tax returnwas due (April 15, 1988), which is more than two years prior to the datethe notice of deficiency was mailed. Lundy is therefore seeking a refund of taxes paid outside the applicable look-back period, and the TaxCourt lacks jurisdiction to award a refund. Pp. 239-245.(b) Lundy suggests two alternative interpretations of $ 6512(b)(3)(B),neither of which is persuasive. Lundy first adopts the Fourth Circuit'sview, which is that the applicable look-back period is determined byreference to the date that the taxpayer actually filed a claim for refund,and argues that he is entitled to a 3-year look-back period because hislate-filed 1987 tax return contained a refund claim that was filed withinthree years from the filing of the return itself. This interpretation iscontrary to the requirements of the statute and leads to a result thatCongress could not have intended, as it in some circumstances subjectsa timely filer of a return to a shorter limitations period in Tax Courtthan a delinquent filer. Lundy's second argument, that the "claim" contemplated by $ 6512(b)(3)(B) can only be a claim filed on a tax return,such that a uniform 3-year look-back period applies under that section,is similarly contrary to the language of the statute. Pp. 245-250.(c) This Court is bound by $ 6512(b)(3)(B)'s language as it is written,and even if the Court were persuaded by Lundy's policy-based arguments for applying a 3-year look-back period, the Court is not free torewrite the statute simply because its effects might be susceptible ofimprovement.

S. 235 (1996)Opinion of the CourtJustice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.In this case, we consider the "look-back" period for obtain-ing a refund of overpaid taxes in the United States TaxCourt under 26 U. S. C. $ 6512(b)(3)(B), and decide whetherthe Tax Court can award a refund of taxes paid more thantwo years prior to the date on which the Commissioner ofInternal Revenue mailed the taxpayer a notice of deficiency,when, on the date the notice of deficiency was mailed, thetaxpayer had not yet filed a return. We hold that in thesecircumstances the 2-year look-back period set forth in$ 6512(b)(3)(B) applies, and the Tax Court lacks jurisdictionto award a refund. IDuring 1987, respondent Robert F. Lundy and his wife had$10,131 in federal income taxes withheld from their wages.This amount was substantially more than the $6,594 theLundys actually owed in taxes for that year, but the Lundysdid not file their 1987 tax return when it was due, nor didthey file a return or claim a refund of the overpaid taxesin the succeeding 21/2 years. On September 26, 1990, theCommissioner of Internal Revenue mailed Lundy a notice ofdeficiency, informing him that he owed $7,672 in additionaltaxes and interest for 1987 and that he was liable for substantial penalties for delinquent filing and negligent under-payment of taxes. See 26 U. S. C. $$ 6651(a)(1) and 6653(1).Lundy and his wife mailed their joint tax return for 1987to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on December 22, 1990.This return indicated that the Lundys had overpaid theirincome taxes for 1987 by $3,537 and claimed a refund in thatamount. Six days after the return was mailed, Lundy fileda timely petition in the Tax Court seeking a redeterminationof the claimed deficiency and a refund of the couple's over-paid taxes. The Commissioner filed an answer generallydenying the allegations in Lundy's petition. Thereafter, theparties negotiated towards a settlement of the claimed deficiency and refund claim. On March 17, 1992, the Commis516us2$18J 10-22-98 12:19:08 PAGES OPINPGT238 COMMISSIONER v. LUNDYOpinion of the Courtsioner filed an amended answer acknowledging that Lundyhad filed a tax return and that Lundy claimed to have overpaid his 1987 taxes by $3,537.The Commissioner contended in this amended pleadingthat the Tax Court lacked jurisdiction to award Lundy arefund. The Commissioner argued that if a taxpayer doesnot file a tax return before the IRS mails the taxpayer anotice of deficiency, the Tax Court can only award the tax-payer a refund of taxes paid within two years prior to thedate the notice of deficiency was mailed. See 26 U. S. C.$ 6512(b)(3)(B). Under the Commissioner's interpretation of$ 6512(b)(3)(B), the Tax Court lacked jurisdiction to awardLundy a refund because Lundy's withheld taxes weredeemed paid on the date that his 1987 tax return was due(April 15, 1988), see $ 6513(b)(1), which is more than twoyears before the date the notice was mailed (September 26,1990).The Tax Court agreed with the position taken by theCommissioner and denied Lundy's refund claim. Citing anunbroken line of Tax Court cases adopting a similar interpretation of $ 6512(b)(3)(B), e. g., Allen v. Commissioner, 99 T. C.475, 479-480 (1992); Galuska v. Commissioner, 98 T.

C. 635, 642-643 (1974) (renumbered statute), the TaxCourt held that if a taxpayer has not filed a tax return bythe time the notice of deficiency is mailed, and the notice ismailed more than two years after the date on which thetaxes are paid, the look-back period under $ 6512(b)(3)(B) istwo years and the Tax Court lacks jurisdiction to awarda refund. 65 TCM 3011, 3014-3015 (1993), || 93,278 RIAMemo TC.The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed,finding that the applicable look-back period in these circumstances is three years and that the Tax Court had juris516us2$18J 10-22-98 12:19:08 PAGES OPINPGT239Cite as: 516 U.

LUNDYOpinion of the Courtsions for determining the timeliness of a refund claim. Itfirst establishes a filing deadline: The taxpayer must file aclaim for a refund "within 3 years from the time the re-turn was filed or 2 years from the time the tax was paid,whichever of such periods expires the later, or if no returnwas filed by the taxpayer, within 2 years from the time thetax was paid." $ 6511(b)(1) (incorporating by reference$ 6511(a)). It also defines two"look-back" periods: If theclaim is filed "within 3 years from the time the return wasfiled," ibid., then the taxpayer is entitled to a refund of "theportion of the tax paid within the 3 years immediately preceding the filing of the claim." $ 6511(b)(2)(A) (incorporat-ing by reference $ 6511(a)).

S. C. $ 7422(a);Martin v. United States, 833 F. 2d 655, 658-659 (CA7 1987),the restrictions governing the Tax Court's authority toaward a refund of overpaid taxes incorporate only the look-back period and not the filing deadline from $ 6511.

LUNDYOpinion of the Courtnotice of deficiency a claim had been filed (whether ornot filed) stating the grounds upon which the Tax Courtfinds that there is an overpayment."The analysis dictated by $ 6512(b)(3)(B) is not elegant, butit is straightforward. Though some courts have advertedto the filing of a "deemed claim," see Galuska, 5 F. 3d, at196;Richards, 37 F. 3d, at 589, all that matters for the properapplication of $ 6512(b)(3)(B) is that the "claim" contemplatedin that section be treated as the only mechanism for deter-mining whether a taxpayer can recover a refund. Section6512(b)(3)(B) defines the look-back period that applies inTax Court by incorporating the look-back provisions from$ 6511(b)(2), and directs the Tax Court to determine the ap-plicable period by inquiring into the timeliness of a hypothetical claim for refund filed "on the date of the mailing of thenotice of deficiency."To this end, $ 6512(b)(3)(B) directs the Tax Court's at-tention to $ 6511(b)(2), which in turn instructs the courtto apply either a 3-year or a 2-year look-back period.See $$ 6511(b)(2)(A) and (B) (incorporating by reference$ 6511(a)); see supra, at 240. To decide which of these look-back periods to apply, the Tax Court must consult the filingprovisions of $ 6511(a) and ask whether the claim describedby $ 6512(b)(3)(B)--a claim filed "on the date of the mailingof the notice of deficiency"--would be filed "within 3 yearsfrom the time the return was filed." See $ 6511(b)(2)(A) (incorporating by reference $ 6511(a)). If a claim filed on thedate of the mailing of the notice of deficiency would be filedwithin that 3-year period, then the look-back period is alsothree years and the Tax Court has jurisdiction to award arefund of any taxes paid within three years prior to the dateof the mailing of the notice of deficiency. $$ 6511(b)(2)(A)and 6512(b)(3)(B). If the claim would not be filed within that3-year period, then the period for awarding a refund is onlytwo years. $$ 6511(b)(2)(B) and 6512(b)(3)(B).516us2$18J 10-22-98 12:19:08 PAGES OPINPGT243Cite as: 516 U. S. 235 (1996)Opinion of the CourtIn this case, we must determine which of these two lookback periods to apply when the taxpayer fails to file a taxreturn when it is due, and the Commissioner mails the taxpayer a notice of deficiency before the taxpayer gets aroundto filing a late return. The Fourth Circuit held that a taxpayer in this situation is entitled to a 3-year look-back periodif the taxpayer actually files a timely claim at some pointin the litigation, see infra, at 246, and respondent offers additional reasons for applying a 3-year look-back period,see infra, at 249-252. We think the proper application of$ 6512(b)(3)(B) instead requires that a 2-year look-backperiod be applied.We reach this conclusion by following the instructions setout in $ 6512(b)(3)(B). The operative question is whethera claim filed "on the date of the mailing of the notice ofdeficiency" would be filed "within 3 years from the timethe return was filed." See $ 6512(b)(3)(B) (incorporating$$ 6511(b)(2) and 6511(a)). In the case of a taxpayer whodoes not file a return before the notice of deficiency is mailed,the claim described in $ 6512(b)(3)(B) could not be filed"within 3 years from the time the return was filed." Noreturn having been filed, there is no date from which tomeasure the 3-year filing period described in $ 6511(a).Consequently, the claim contemplated in $ 6512(b)(3)(B)would not be filed within the 3-year window described in$ 6511(a), and the 3-year look-back period set out in$ 6511(b)(2)(A) would not apply. The applicable look-backperiod is instead the default 2-year period described in$ 6511(b)(2)(B), which is measured from the date of themailing of the notice of deficiency, see $ 6512(b)(3)(B). Thetaxpayer is entitled to a refund of any taxes paid withintwo years prior to the date of the mailing of the noticeof deficiency.Special rules might apply in some cases, see, e. g., $ 6511(c)(extension of time by agreement); $ 6511(d) (special limita516us2$18J 10-22-98 12:19:08 PAGES OPINPGT244 COMMISSIONER v. LUNDYOpinion of the Courttions periods for designated items), but in the case wherethe taxpayer has filed a timely tax return and the IRS isclaiming a deficiency in taxes from that return, the interplayof $$ 6512(b)(3)(B) and 6511(b)(2) generally ensures that thetaxpayer can obtain a refund of any taxes against which theIRS is asserting a deficiency. In most cases, the notice ofdeficiency must be mailed within three years from the datethe tax return is filed. See 26 U. S. C. $$ 6501(a) and6503(a)(1);Badaracco v. Commissioner, 464 U. S. 386, 389,392 (1984). Therefore, if the taxpayer has already filed areturn (albeit perhaps a faulty one), any claim filed "on thedate of the mailing of the notice of deficiency" would necessarily be filed within three years from the date the return isfiled. In these circumstances, the applicable look-back period under $ 6512(b)(3)(B) would be the 3-year period definedin $ 6511(b)(2)(A), and the Tax Court would have jurisdictionto award a refund.Therefore, in the case of a taxpayer who files a timely taxreturn, $ 6512(b)(3)(B) usually operates to toll the filing period that might otherwise deprive the taxpayer of the opportunity to seek a refund. If a taxpayer contesting the accuracy of a previously filed tax return in Tax Court discoversfor the first time during the course of litigation that he isentitled to a refund, the taxpayer can obtain a refund fromthe Tax Court without first filing a timely claim for refundwith the IRS. It does not matter, as it would in districtcourt, see $ 7422 (incorporating $ 6511), that the taxpayer hasdiscovered the entitlement to a refund well after the periodfor filing a timely refund claim with the IRS has passed, because $ 6512(b)(3)(B) applies "whether or not [a claim is]filed," and the look-back period is measured from the date ofthe mailing of the notice of deficiency. Ibid. Nor does itmatter, as it might in a refund suit, see 26 CFR $ 301.6402-2(b)(1) (1995), whether the taxpayer has previously apprisedthe IRS of the precise basis for the refund claim, because 26U. S. C. $ 6512(b)(3)(B) posits the filing of a hypothetical claim516us2$18J 10-22-98 12:19:08 PAGES OPINPGT245Cite as: 516 U. S. 235 (1996)Opinion of the Court"stating the grounds upon which the Tax Court finds thatthere is an overpayment."Section 6512(b)(3)(B) treats delinquent filers of income taxreturns less charitably. Whereas timely filers are virtuallyassured the opportunity to seek a refund in the event theyare drawn into Tax Court litigation, a delinquent filer's entitlement to a refund in Tax Court depends on the date of themailing of the notice of deficiency. Section 6512(b)(3)(B)tolls the limitations period, in that it directs the Tax Courtto measure the look-back period from the date on which thenotice of deficiency is mailed and not the date on which thetaxpayer actually files a claim for refund. But in the caseof delinquent filers, $ 6512(b)(3)(B) establishes only a 2-yearlook-back period, so the delinquent filer is not assured theopportunity to seek a refund in Tax Court: If the notice ofdeficiency is mailed more than two years after the taxeswere paid, the Tax Court lacks jurisdiction to award the tax-payer a refund.The Tax Court properly applied this 2-year look-back pe-riod to Lundy's case. As of September 26, 1990 (the datethe notice was mailed), Lundy had not filed a tax return.Consequently, a claim filed on that date would not be filedwithin the 3-year period described in $ 6511(a), and the 2-year period from $ 6511(b)(2)(B) applies. Lundy's taxeswere withheld from his wages, so they are deemed paid onthe date his 1987 tax return was due (April 15, 1988), see$ 6513(b)(1), which is more than two years prior to the datethe notice of deficiency was mailed (September 26, 1990).Lundy is therefore seeking a refund of taxes paid outside theapplicable look-back period, and the Tax Court lacks jurisdiction to award such a refund.IIIIn deciding Lundy's case, the Fourth Circuit adopted a dif-ferent approach to interpreting $ 6512(b)(3)(B) and applied a3-year look-back period. Respondent supports the Fourth516us2$18J 10-22-98 12:19:08 PAGES OPINPGT246 COMMISSIONER v. LUNDYOpinion of the CourtCircuit's rationale, but also offers an argument for applyinga uniform 3-year look-back period under $ 6512(b)(3)(B). Wefind neither position persuasive.The Fourth Circuit held:"[T]he Tax Court, when applying the limitation provi-sion of $ 6511(b)(2) in light of $ 6512(b)(3)(B), should substitute the date of the mailing of the notice of deficiencyfor the date on which the taxpayer filed the claim forrefund, but only for the purpose of determining thebenchmark date for measuring the limitation period andnot for the purpose of determining whether the twoyear or three-year limitation period applies." 45 F. 3d,at 861.In other words, the Fourth Circuit held that the look-backperiod is measured from the date of the mailing of the noticeof deficiency (i. e., the taxpayer is entitled to a refund of anytaxes paid within either two or three years prior to thatdate), but that that date is irrelevant in calculating thelength of the look-back period itself. The look-back period,the Fourth Circuit held, must be defined in terms of the datethat the taxpayeractually filed a claim for refund. Ibid.("[T]he three-year limitation period applies because Lundyfiled his claim for refund . . . within three years of filing histax return"). Thus, under the Fourth Circuit's view, Lundywas entitled to a 3-year look-back period because Lundy'slate-filed 1987 tax return contained a claim for refund, andthat claim was filed within three years from the filing of thereturn.Ibid. (taxpayer entitled to same look-back periodthat would apply in district court).Contrary to the Fourth Circuit's interpretation, the factthat Lundy actually filed a claim for a refund after the dateon which the Commissioner mailed the notice of deficiencyhas no bearing in determining whether the Tax Court hasjurisdiction to award Lundy a refund.

C.$ 6512(a), and the Tax Court's jurisdiction to award a refundis limited to those circumstances delineated in $ 6512(b)(3).Section 6512(b)(3)(C) is the only provision that measures thelook-back period based on a refund claim that is actually filedby the taxpayer, and that provision is inapplicable here because it only applies to refund claims filed "before the dateof the mailing of the notice of deficiency." $ 6512(b)(3)(C).Under $ 6512(b)(3)(B), which is the provision that does apply,the Tax Court is instructed to consider only the timelinessof a claim filed "on the date of the mailing of the notice ofdeficiency," not the timeliness of any claim that the taxpayermight actually file.The Fourth Circuit's rule also leads to a result that Congress could not have intended, in that it subjects the timely,not the delinquent, filer to a shorter limitations period in TaxCourt. Under the Fourth Circuit's rule, the availability ofa refund turns entirely on whether the taxpayer has in factfiled a claim for refund with the IRS, because it is the date ofactual filing that determines the applicable look-back periodunder $ 6511(b)(2) (and, by incorporation, $ 6512(b)(3)(B)).See 45 F. 3d, at 861; supra, at 246. This rule might "eliminat[e] the inequities resulting" from adhering to the 2-yearlook-back period, 45 F. 3d, at 863, but it creates an evengreater inequity in the case of a taxpayer who dutifully filesa tax return when it is due, but does not initially claim arefund. We think our interpretation of the statute achievesan appropriate and reasonable result in this case: The taxpayer who files a timely income tax return could obtain arefund in the Tax Court under $ 6512(b)(3)(B), without regard to whether the taxpayer has actually filed a timelyclaim for refund. See supra, at 244-245.If it is the actual filing of a refund claim that determinesthe length of the look-back period, as the Fourth Circuitheld, the filer of a timely income tax return might be out of516us2$18J 10-22-98 12:19:08 PAGES OPINPGT248 COMMISSIONER v. LUNDYOpinion of the Courtluck. If the taxpayer does not file a claim for refund withhis tax return, and the notice of deficiency arrives shortlybefore the 3-year period for filing a timely claim expires,see $$ 6511(a) and (b)(1), the taxpayer might not discoverhis entitlement to a refund until well after the commencement of litigation in the Tax Court. But having filed atimely return, the taxpayer would be precluded by thepassage of time from filing an actual claim for refund "within3 years from the time the return was filed," as $ 6511(b)(2)(A) requires. $ 6511(b)(2)(A) (incorporating by reference$ 6511(a)). The taxpayer would therefore be entitled only toa refund of taxes paid within two years prior to the mailingof the notice of deficiency. See $ 6511(b)(2)(B); 45 F. 3d, at861-862 (taxpayer entitled to same look-back period aswould apply in district court, and look-back period is determined based on date of actual filing). It is unlikely thatCongress intended for a taxpayer in Tax Court to be worseoff for having filed a timely return, but that result would becompelled under the Fourth Circuit's approach.Lundy offers an alternative reading of the statute thatavoids this unreasonable result, but Lundy's approach is similarly defective. The main thrust of Lundy's argument isthat the "claim" contemplated in $ 6512(b)(3)(B) could be filed"within 3 years from the time the return was filed," suchthat the applicable look-back period under $ 6512(b)(3)(B)would be three years, if the claim were itself filed on a taxreturn. Lundy in fact argues that Congress must have intended the claim described in $ 6512(b)(3)(B) to be a claimfiled on a return, because there is no other way to file a claimfor refund with the IRS. Brief for Respondent 28, 30 (citing26 CFR $ 301.6402-3(a)(1) (1995)). Lundy therefore arguesthat $ 6512(b)(3)(B) incorporates a uniform 3-year look-backperiod for Tax Court cases: If the taxpayer files a timelyreturn, the notice of deficiency (and the "claim" under$ 6512(b)(3)(B)) will necessarily be filed within three years ofthe return and the look-back period is three years; if the516us2$18J 10-22-98 12:19:08 PAGES OPINPGT249Cite as: 516 U. S. 235 (1996)Opinion of the Courttaxpayer does not file a return, then the claim contemplatedin $ 6512(b)(3)(B) is deemed to be a claim filed with, and thuswithin three years of, a return and the look-back period isagain three years.Like the Fourth Circuit's approach, Lundy's reading of thestatute has the convenient effect of ensuring that taxpayersin Lundy's position can almost always obtain a refund if theyfile in Tax Court, but we are bound by the terms Congresschose to use when it drafted the statute, and we do not thinkthat the term "claim" as it is used in $ 6512(b)(3)(B) is suscep-tible of the interpretation Lundy has given it. The InternalRevenue Code does not define the term "claim for refund" asit is used in $ 6512(b)(3)(B), cf. 26 U. S. C. $ 6696(e)(2) ("Forpurposes of sections 6694 and 6695 . . . [t]he term `claim forrefund' means a claim for refund of, or credit against, anytax imposed by subtitle A"), but it is apparent from the language of $ 6512(b)(3)(B) and the statute as a whole that aclaim for refund can be filed separately from a return. Section 6512(b)(3)(B) provides that the Tax Court has jurisdiction to award a refund to the extent the taxpayer would beentitled to a refund "if on the date of the mailing of the noticeof deficiency a claim had been filed." (Emphasis added.)It does not state, as Lundy would have it, that a taxpayer isentitled to a refund if on that date "a claim and a return hadbeen filed."Perhaps the most compelling evidence that Congress didnot intend the term "claim" in $ 6512 to mean a "claim filed ona return" is the parallel use of the term "claim" in $ 6511(a).Section 6511(a) indicates that a claim for refund is timelyif it is "filed by the taxpayer within 3 years from the timethe return was filed," and it plainly contemplates that aclaim can be filed even "if no return was filed." If a claimcould only be filed with a return, as Lundy contends, theseprovisions of the statute would be senseless, cf. 26 U. S. C.$ 6696 (separately defining "claim for refund" and "return"),and we have been given no reason to believe that Congress516us2$18J 10-22-98 12:19:08 PAGES OPINPGT250 COMMISSIONER v. LUNDYOpinion of the Courtmeant the term "claim" to mean one thing in $ 6511 but tomean something else altogether in the very next section ofthe statute. The interrelationship and close proximity ofthese provisions of the statute "presents a classic case forapplication of the `normal rule of statutory construction thatidentical words used in different parts of the same act areintended to have the same meaning.' " Sullivan v. Stroop,496 U. S. 478, 484 (1990) (quotingSorenson v. Secretaryof Treasury, 475 U. S. 851, 860 (1986) (internal quotationmarks omitted)).The regulation Lundy cites in support of his interpretation, 26 CFR $ 301.6402-3(a)(1) (1995), is consistent with ourinterpretation of the statute. That regulation states onlythat a claim must "[i]n general" be filed on a return, ibid.,inviting the obvious conclusion that there are some circumstances in which a claim and a return can be filed separately.We have previously recognized that even a claim that doesnot comply with federal regulations might suffice to toll thelimitations periods under the Tax Code, see,e. g., UnitedStates v. Kales, 314 U. S. 186, 194 (1941) ("notice fairly advis-ing the Commissioner of the nature of the taxpayer's claim"tolls the limitations period, even if "it does not comply withformal requirements of the statute and regulations"), and wemust assume that if Congress had intended to require thatthe "claim" described in $ 6512(b)(3)(B) be a "claim filed on areturn," it would have said so explicitly.IVLundy offers two policy-based arguments for applying a3-year look-back period under $ 6512(b)(3)(B). He arguesthat the application of a 2-year period is contrary to Con-gress' broad intent in drafting $ 6512(b)(3)(B), which was topreserve, not defeat, a taxpayer's claim to a refund in TaxCourt, and he claims that our interpretation creates an incongruity between the limitations period that applies in TaxCourt litigation and the period that would apply in a refund516us2$18J 10-22-98 12:19:08 PAGES OPINPGT251Cite as: 516 U. S. 235 (1996)Opinion of the Courtsuit filed in district court or the Court of Federal Claims.Even if we were inclined to depart from the plain languageof the statute, we would find neither of these argumentspersuasive.Lundy correctly argues that Congress intended $ 6512(b)(3)(B) to permit taxpayers to seek a refund in Tax Court incircumstances in which they might otherwise be barred fromfiling an administrative claim for refund with the IRS. Thisis in fact the way $ 6512(b)(3)(B) operates in a large numberof cases. See supra, at 244-245. But that does not meanthat Congress intended that $ 6512(b)(3)(B) would alwayspreserve taxpayers' ability to seek a refund. Indeed, it isapparent from the face of the statute that Congress also intended $ 6512(b)(3)(B) to act sometimes as a bar to recovery.To this end, the section incorporates both the 2-year andthe 3-year look-back periods from $ 6511(b)(2), and we mustassume (contrary to Lundy's reading, which provides a uniform 3-year period, see supra, at 248-249) that Congress intended for both those look-back periods to have some effect.Cf. Badaracco, 464 U. S., at 405 (Stevens, J., dissenting)("Whatever the correct standard for construing a statute oflimitations . . . surely the presumption ought to be that somelimitations period is applicable"). (Emphasis deleted.)Lundy also suggests that our interpretation of the statutecreates a disparity between the limitations period that applies in Tax Court and the periods that apply in refund suitsfiled in district court or the Court of Federal Claims. Inthis regard, Lundy argues that the claim for refund he filedwith his tax return on December 28 would have been timelyfor purposes of district court litigation because it was filed"within 3 years from the time the return was filed,"$ 6511(b)(1) (incorporating by reference $ 6511(a)); see alsoRev. Rul. 76-511, 1976-2 Cum. Bull. 428, and within the 3-year look-back period that would apply under $ 6511(b)(2)(A).Petitioner disagrees that there is any disparity, arguing thatLundy's interpretation of the statute is wrong and that516us2$18J 10-22-98 12:19:08 PAGES OPINPGT252 COMMISSIONER v. LUNDYOpinion of the CourtLundy's claim for refund would not have been consideredtimely in district court. See Brief for Petitioner 12, 29-30,and n. 11 (citing Miller v. United States, 38 F. 3d 473, 475(CA9 1994)).We assume without deciding that Lundy is correct, andthat a different limitations period would apply in districtcourt, but nonetheless find in this disparity no excuse tochange the limitations scheme that Congress has crafted.The rules governing litigation in Tax Court differ in manyways from the rules governing litigation in the district courtand the Court of Federal Claims. Some of these differencesmight make the Tax Court a more favorable forum, whileothers may not. Compare 26 U. S. C. $ 6213(a) (taxpayer canseek relief in Tax Court without first paying an assessmentof taxes) with Flora v. United States, 362 U. S. 145, 177(1960) (28 U. S. C. $ 1346(a)(1) requires full payment of thetax assessment before taxpayer can file a refund suit in district court); and compare 26 U. S. C. $ 6512(b)(3)(B) (TaxCourt must assume that the taxpayer has filed a claim "stating the grounds upon which the Tax Court" intends to awarda refund) with 26 CFR $ 301.6402-2(b)(1) (1995) (claim forrefund in district court must state grounds for refund withspecificity). To the extent our interpretation of $ 6512(b)(3)(B) reveals a further distinction between the rules thatapply in these forums, it is a distinction compelled by thestatutory language, and it is a distinction Congress could rationally make. As our discussion of $ 6512(b)(3)(B) demonstrates, see supra, at 244-245, all a taxpayer need do to preserve the ability to seek a refund in the Tax Court is complywith the law and file a timely return.We are bound by the language of the statute as it iswritten, and even if the rule Lundy advocates might"accor[d] with good policy," we are not at liberty "torewrite [the] statute because [we] might deem its effectssusceptible of improvement." Badaracco, supra, at 398.Applying $ 6512(b)(3)(B) as Congress drafted it, we find that516us2$18J 10-22-98 12:19:08 PAGES OPINPGT253Cite as: 516 U. S. 235 (1996)Thomas, J., dissentingthe applicable look-back period in this case is two years,measured from the date of the mailing of the notice of deficiency. Accordingly, we find that the Tax Court lackedjurisdiction to award Lundy a refund of his overwithheldtaxes. The judgment is reversed.
