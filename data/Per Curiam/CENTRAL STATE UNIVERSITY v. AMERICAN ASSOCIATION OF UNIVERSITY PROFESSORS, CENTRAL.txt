Petitioner Central State University challenges a ruling ofthe Ohio Supreme Court striking down on equal protectiongrounds a state law requiring public universities to developstandards for professors' instructional workloads and exempting those standards from collective bargaining. Wegrant the petition and reverse the judgment of the OhioSupreme Court.In an effort to address the decline in the amount of timethat public university professors devoted to teaching as op-posed to researching, the State of Ohio enacted Ohio Rev.Code Ann. $ 3345.45 (1997). This provision provides in rele-vant part:"On or before January 1, 1994, the Ohio board of re-gents jointly with all state universities . . . shall developstandards for instructional workloads for full-time andpart-time faculty in keeping with the universities' missions and with special emphasis on the undergraduatelearning experience. . . ."On or before June 30, 1994, the board of trustees ofeach state university shall take formal action to adopta faculty workload policy consistent with the standardsdeveloped under this section. Notwithstanding [otherprovisions making faculty workload at public universi-ties a proper subject for collective bargaining], the policies adopted under this section are not appropriate sub-jects for collective bargaining. Notwithstanding [thesecollective-bargaining provisions], any policy adoptedunder this section by a board of trustees prevails overany conflicting provisions of any collective bargainingagreement between an employees organization and thatboard of trustees."**As part of the same bill codified at $ 3345, the Ohio General Assemblyalso enacted uncodified legislation providing that the Board of Regents526US1 Unit: $U35 [12-11-00 12:23:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN126 CENTRAL STATE UNIV. v. AMERICAN ASSN. OF UNIV.PROFESSORS, CENTRAL STATE UNIV. CHAPTERPer CuriamIn 1994, petitioner Central State University adopted a work-load policy pursuant to $ 3345.45 and notified respondent, thecertified collective-bargaining agent for Central State's pro-fessors, that it would not bargain over the issue of facultyworkload. Respondent subsequently filed a complaint inOhio state court for declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that $ 3345.45 created a class of public employees notentitled to bargain regarding their workload and that thisclassification violated the Equal Protection Clauses of theOhio and United States Constitutions.By a divided vote, the Ohio Supreme Court agreed withrespondent that $ 3345.45 deprived public university professors the equal protection of the laws. See 83 Ohio St. 3d229, 699 N. E. 2d 463 (1998). The court acknowledged thatOhio's purpose in enacting the statute was legitimate andthat all legislative enactments enjoy a strong presumptionof constitutionality. Id., at 234-235, 699 N. E. 2d, at 468-469. Nonetheless, the court held that $ 3345's collectivebargaining exemption bore no rational relationship to theState's interest in correcting the imbalance between research and teaching at its public universities. See id., at236-239, 699 N. E. 2d, at 469-470. The State had arguedthat achieving uniformity, consistency, and equity in facultyworkload was necessary to recapture the decline in teaching,and that collective bargaining produced variation in workloads across universities in departments having the same academic mission. Id., at 236, 699 N. E. 2d, at 469. Reviewing evidence that the State had submitted in support of thisshall work with state universities "to ensure that no later than [the] fallterm 1994, a minimum ten percent increase in statewide undergraduateteaching activity be achieved to restore the reductions experienced overthe past decade. Notwithstanding section 3345.45 of the Revised Code,any collective bargaining agreement in effect on the effective date of thisact shall continue in effect until its expiration date." Amended SubstituteHouse Bill No. 152, $ 84.14, 145 Ohio Laws 4539 (effective July 1, 1993).526US1 Unit: $U35 [12-11-00 12:23:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN127Cite as: 526 U. S. 124 (1999)Per Curiamcontention, the Ohio Supreme Court held that "there is nota shred of evidence in the entire record which links collectivebargaining with the decline in teaching over the last decade,or in any way purports to establish that collective bargainingcontributed in the slightest to the lost faculty time devotedto undergraduate teaching." Ibid. Based on this determination, the court concluded that the State had failed toshow "any rational basis for singling out university facultymembers as the only public employees . . . precluded frombargaining over their workload." Id., at 237, 699 N. E. 2d,at 470.The dissenting justices pointed out that the majority'smethodology and conclusion conflicted with this Court'sstandards for rational-basis review of equal protection challenges. See id., at 238-241, 699 N. E. 2d, at 471-472. Intheir view, "that collective bargaining has not caused thedecline in teaching proves nothing in assessing whether thefaculty workload standards imposed pursuant to R. C.3345.45 legitimately relate to that statute's purpose ofrestoring losses in undergraduate teaching activity." Id.,at 238, 699 N. E. 2d, at 471 (emphasis in original). The majority's review of the State's evidence was therefore "inconsequential" to the only question in the case: whether thechallenged legislative action was arbitrary or irrational.See id., at 239-242, 699 N. E. 2d, at 472-473. Answeringthis question, the dissent concluded that imposing uniformworkload standards via the exemption "is not an irrationalmeans of effecting an increasing in teaching activity. Infact, it was probably the most direct means of accomplishingthat objective available to the General Assembly." Id., at241, 699 N. E. 2d, at 473.We agree that the Ohio Supreme Court's holding cannotbe reconciled with the requirements of the Equal ProtectionClause. We have repeatedly held that "a classification neither involving fundamental rights nor proceeding along sus526US1 Unit: $U35 [12-11-00 12:23:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN128 CENTRAL STATE UNIV. v. AMERICAN ASSN. OF UNIV.PROFESSORS, CENTRAL STATE UNIV. CHAPTERPer Curiampect lines . . . cannot run afoul of the Equal Protection Clauseif there is a rational relationship between disparity of treatment and some legitimate governmental purpose." Hellerv. Doe, 509 U. S. 312, 319-321 (1993) (citations omitted); FCCv. Beach Communications, Inc., 508 U. S. 307, 313-314(1993); Nordlinger v. Hahn, 505 U. S. 1, 11 (1992). The legislative classification created by $ 3345.45 passes this test.One of the statute's objectives was to increase the time spentby faculty in the classroom; the imposition of a faculty workload policy not subject to collective bargaining was an entirely rational step to accomplish this objective. The legislature could quite reasonably have concluded that the policyanimating the law would have been undercut and likely varied if it were subject to collective bargaining. The State,in effect, decided that the attainment of this goal was moreimportant than the system of collective bargaining that hadpreviously included university professors. See Vance v.Bradley, 440 U. S. 93 (1979) (upholding a similar enactmentof Congress providing that federal employees covered by theForeign Service retirement system, but not those covered bythe Civil Service retirement system, would be required toretire at age 60).The fact that the record before the Ohio courts did notshow that collective bargaining in the past had lead to thedecline in classroom time for faculty does not detract fromthe rationality of the legislative decision. See Heller, supra,at 320 ("A State . . . has no obligation to produce evidence tosustain the rationality of a statutory classification"). Thelegislature wanted a uniform workload policy to be in placeby a certain date. It could properly conclude that collectivebargaining about that policy in the future would interferewith the attainment of this end. Under our precedent, thisis sufficient to sustain the exclusion of university professorsfrom the otherwise general collective-bargaining scheme forpublic employees.526US1 Unit: $U35 [12-11-00 12:23:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN129Cite as: 526 U.
