This case concerns the rules for determining whether aperson being questioned by law enforcement officers is heldin custody, and thus entitled to the warnings required byMiranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966). We hold, not forthe first time, that an officer's subjective and undisclosedview concerning whether the person being interrogated is asuspect is irrelevant to the assessment whether the personis in custody. ITen-year-old Robyn Jackson disappeared from a play-ground in Baldwin Park, California, at around 6:30 p.m. onSeptember 28, 1982. Early the next morning, about 10miles away in Pasadena, Andrew Zimmerman observed alarge man emerge from a turquoise American sedan andthrow something into a nearby flood control channel. Zimmerman called the police, who arrived at the scene and dis-covered the girl's body in the channel. There was evidencethat she had been raped, and the cause of death was deter-mined to be asphyxia complicated by blunt force trauma tothe head.Lieutenant Thomas Johnston, a detective with the LosAngeles County Sheriff 's Department, investigated the hom*Briefs of amici curiae urging affirmance were filed for the OrangeCounty District Attorney, State of California, by Michael R.

From witnesses interviewed on the day the body wasdiscovered, he learned that Robyn had talked to two icecream truck drivers, one being petitioner Robert EdwardStansbury, in the hours before her disappearance. Giventhese contacts, Johnston thought Stansbury and the otherdriver might have some connection with the homicide orknowledge thereof, but for reasons unimportant here Johnston considered only the other driver to be a leading suspect.After the suspect driver was brought in for interrogation,Johnston asked Officer Lee of the Baldwin Park Police De-partment to contact Stansbury to see if he would come in forquestioning as a potential witness.Lee and three other plainclothes officers arrived at Stansbury's trailer home at about 11:00 that evening. The officerssurrounded the door and Lee knocked. When Stansbury answered, Lee told him the officers were investigating a homicide to which Stansbury was a possible witness and asked ifhe would accompany them to the police station to answersome questions. Stansbury agreed to the interview and accepted a ride to the station in the front seat of Lee's policecar.At the station, Lieutenant Johnston, in the presence ofanother officer, questioned Stansbury about his whereaboutsand activities during the afternoon and evening of September 28. Neither Johnston nor the other officer issued Miranda warnings. Stansbury told the officers (among otherthings) that on the evening of the 28th he spoke with thevictim at about 6:00, returned to his trailer home after workat 9:00, and left the trailer at about midnight in his housemate's turquoise, American-made car. This last detailaroused Johnston's suspicions, as the turquoise car matchedthe description of the one Andrew Zimmerman had observedin Pasadena. When Stansbury, in response to a furtherquestion, admitted to prior convictions for rape, kidnaping,and child molestation, Johnston terminated the interviewand another officer advised Stansbury of his Miranda rights.511us1$42Z 06-11-96 22:57:01 PAGES OPINPGT321Cite as: 511 U. S. 318 (1994)Per CuriamStansbury declined to make further statements, requestedan attorney, and was arrested. Respondent State of California charged Stansbury with first-degree murder and othercrimes.Stansbury filed a pretrial motion to suppress all statements made at the station, and the evidence discovered as aresult of those statements. The trial court denied the motion in relevant part, ruling that Stansbury was not "in custody"--and thus not entitled to Miranda warnings--until hementioned that he had taken his housemate's turquoise carfor a midnight drive. Before that stage of the interview,the trial court reasoned, "the focus in [Lieutenant Johnston's]mind certainly was on the other ice cream [truck] driver,"Tr. 2368; only "after Mr. Stansbury made the comment . . .describing the . . . turquoise-colored automobile" did Johnston's suspicions "shif[t] to Mr. Stansbury," ibid. Basedupon its conclusion that Stansbury was not in custody untilJohnston's suspicions had focused on him, the trial courtpermitted the prosecution to introduce in its case in chiefthe statements Stansbury made before that time. At trial,the jury convicted Stansbury of first-degree murder, rape,kidnaping, and lewd act on a child under the age of 14, andfixed the penalty for the first-degree murder at death.The California Supreme Court affirmed. Before determining whether Stansbury was in custody during the interview at the station, the court set out what it viewed as theapplicable legal standard:"In deciding the custody issue, the totality of the circumstances is relevant, and no one factor is dispositive. However, the most important considerations include (1) thesite of the interrogation, (2) whether the investigationhas focused on the subject, (3) whether the objective indicia of arrest are present, and (4) the length and formof questioning." 4 Cal. 4th 1017, 1050, 846 P. 2d 756,775 (1993) (internal quotation marks omitted).511us1$42Z 06-11-96 22:57:01 PAGES OPINPGT322 STANSBURY v. CALIFORNIAPer CuriamThe court proceeded to analyze the second factor in detail,in the end accepting the trial court's factual determination"that suspicion focused on [Stansbury] only when he mentioned that he had driven a turquoise car on the night of thecrime." Id., at 1052, 846 P. 2d, at 776. The court "conclude[d] that [Stansbury] was not subject to custodial interrogation before he mentioned the turquoise car," and thusapproved the trial court's ruling that Miranda v. Arizonadid not bar the admission of statements Stansbury made before that point. 4 Cal. 4th, at 1054, 846 P. 2d, at 777-778.We granted certiorari. 510 U. S. 943 (1993).IIWe held in Miranda that a person questioned by law enforcement officers after being "taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way"must first "be warned that he has a right to remain silent,that any statement he does make may be used as evidenceagainst him, and that he has a right to the presence of anattorney, either retained or appointed." 384 U. S., at 444.Statements elicited in noncompliance with this rule may notbe admitted for certain purposes in a criminal trial. Compare id., at 492, 494, with Harris v. New York, 401 U. S. 222(1971). An officer's obligation to administer Miranda warnings attaches, however, "only where there has been sucha restriction on a person's freedom as to render him `incustody.' " Oregon v. Mathiason, 429 U. S. 492, 495 (1977)(per curiam); see also Illinois v. Perkins, 496 U. S. 292,296 (1990). In determining whether an individual was incustody, a court must examine all of the circumstancessurrounding the interrogation, but "the ultimate inquiry issimply whether there [was] a `formal arrest or restraint onfreedom of movement' of the degree associated with a formalarrest." California v. Beheler, 463 U. S. 1121, 1125 (1983)(per curiam) (quoting Mathiason, supra, at 495).511us1$42Z 06-11-96 22:57:02 PAGES OPINPGT323Cite as: 511 U. S. 318 (1994)Per CuriamOur decisions make clear that the initial determination ofcustody depends on the objective circumstances of the interrogation, not on the subjective views harbored by either theinterrogating officers or the person being questioned. InBeckwith v. United States, 425 U. S. 341 (1976), for example,the defendant, without being advised of his Miranda rights,made incriminating statements to Government agents during an interview in a private home. He later asked thatMiranda "be extended to cover interrogation in noncustodial circumstances after a police investigation has fo-cused on the suspect." 425 U. S., at 345 (internal quotationmarks omitted). We found his argument unpersuasive, explaining that it "was the compulsive aspect of custodial interrogation, and not the strength or content of the government'ssuspicions at the time the questioning was conducted, whichled the Court to impose the Miranda requirements withregard to custodial questioning." Id., at 346-347 (internalquotation marks omitted). As a result, we concluded thatthe defendant was not entitled to Miranda warnings: "Although the `focus' of an investigation may indeed have beenon Beckwith at the time of the interview . . . , he hardlyfound himself in the custodial situation described by the Miranda Court as the basis for its holding." 425 U. S., at 347.Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U. S. 420 (1984), reaffirmed theconclusions reached in Beckwith. Berkemer concerned theroadside questioning of a motorist detained in a traffic stop.We decided that the motorist was not in custody for purposesof Miranda even though the traffic officer "apparently decided as soon as [the motorist] stepped out of his car that[the motorist] would be taken into custody and charged witha traffic offense." 468 U. S., at 442. The reason, we explained, was that the officer "never communicated his intention to" the motorist during the relevant questioning. Ibid.The lack of communication was crucial, for under Miranda"[a] policeman's unarticulated plan has no bearing on thequestion whether a suspect was `in custody' at a particular511us1$42Z 06-11-96 22:57:02 PAGES OPINPGT324 STANSBURY v. CALIFORNIAPer Curiamtime"; rather, "the only relevant inquiry is how a reasonableman in the suspect's position would have understood his situation." 468 U. S., at 442. Other cases of ours have beenconsistent in adhering to this understanding of the custodyelement of Miranda. See, e. g., Mathiason, supra, at 495("Nor is the requirement of warnings to be imposed simplybecause . . . the questioned person is one whom the policesuspect. Miranda warnings are required only where therehas been such a restriction on a person's freedom as to render him `in custody' "); Beheler, supra, at 1124, n. 2 ("Ourholding in Mathiason reflected our earlier decision in [Beckwith], in which we rejected the notion that the `in custody'requirement was satisfied merely because the police interviewed a person who was the `focus' of a criminal investigation"); Minnesota v. Murphy, 465 U. S. 420, 431 (1984) ("Themere fact that an investigation has focused on a suspect doesnot trigger the need for Miranda warnings in noncustodialsettings, and the probation officer's knowledge and intenthave no bearing on the outcome of this case") (citation omitted); cf. Pennsylvania v. Bruder, 488 U. S. 9, 11, n. 2 (1988).It is well settled, then, that a police officer's subjectiveview that the individual under questioning is a suspect, ifundisclosed, does not bear upon the question whether theindividual is in custody for purposes of Miranda. See F.Inbau, J. Reid, & J. Buckley, Criminal Interrogation and Confessions 232, 236, 297-298 (3d ed. 1986). The same principleobtains if an officer's undisclosed assessment is that the person being questioned is not a suspect. In either instance,one cannot expect the person under interrogation to probethe officer's innermost thoughts. Save as they are communicated or otherwise manifested to the person being questioned, an officer's evolving but unarticulated suspicions donot affect the objective circumstances of an interrogation orinterview, and thus cannot affect the Miranda custody inquiry. "The threat to a citizen's Fifth Amendment rights511us1$42Z 06-11-96 22:57:02 PAGES OPINPGT325Cite as: 511 U. S. 318 (1994)Per Curiamthat Miranda was designed to neutralize has little to do withthe strength of an interrogating officer's suspicions." Berkemer, supra, at 435, n. 22.An officer's knowledge or beliefs may bear upon the custody issue if they are conveyed, by word or deed, to the individual being questioned. Cf. Michigan v. Chesternut, 486U. S. 567, 575, n. 7 (1988) (citing United States v. Mendenhall,446 U. S. 544, 554, n. 6 (1980) (opinion of Stewart, J.)). Thosebeliefs are relevant only to the extent they would affect howa reasonable person in the position of the individual beingquestioned would gauge the breadth of his or her " `freedomof action.' " Berkemer, supra, at 440. Even a clear statement from an officer that the person under interrogation isa prime suspect is not, in itself, dispositive of the custodyissue, for some suspects are free to come and go until thepolice decide to make an arrest. The weight and pertinenceof any communications regarding the officer's degree of suspicion will depend upon the facts and circumstances of theparticular case. In sum, an officer's views concerning thenature of an interrogation, or beliefs concerning the potentialculpability of the individual being questioned, may be oneamong many factors that bear upon the assessment whetherthat individual was in custody, but only if the officer's viewsor beliefs were somehow manifested to the individual underinterrogation and would have affected how a reasonable person in that position would perceive his or her freedom toleave. (Of course, instances may arise in which the officer'sundisclosed views are relevant in testing the credibility ofhis or her account of what happened during an interrogation;but it is the objective surroundings, and not any undisclosedviews, that control the Miranda custody inquiry.)We decide on this state of the record that the CaliforniaSupreme Court's analysis of whether Stansbury was in custody is not consistent in all respects with the foregoing principles. Numerous statements in the court's opinion are open511us1$42Z 06-11-96 22:57:02 PAGES OPINPGT326 STANSBURY v. CALIFORNIAPer Curiamto the interpretation that the court regarded the officers'subjective beliefs regarding Stansbury's status as a suspect(or nonsuspect) as significant in and of themselves, ratherthan as relevant only to the extent they influenced the objective conditions surrounding his interrogation. See 4 Cal.4th, at 1050, 846 P. 2d, at 775 ("whether the investigationha[d] focused on the" person being questioned is among the"most important considerations" in assessing whether theperson was in custody). So understood, the court's analysisconflicts with our precedents. The court's apparent conclusion that Stansbury's Miranda rights were triggered by virtue of the fact that he had become the focus of the officers'suspicions, see 4 Cal. 4th, at 1052, 1054, 846 P. 2d, at 776,777-778; cf., e. g., State v. Blanding, 69 Haw. 583, 586-587,752 P. 2d 99, 101 (1988); State v. Hartman, 703 S. W. 2d 106,120 (Tenn. 1985), cert. denied, 478 U. S. 1010 (1986); Peoplev. Herdon, 42 Cal. App. 3d 300, 307, n. 10, 116 Cal. Rptr. 641,645, n. 10 (1974), is incorrect as well. Our cases make clear,in no uncertain terms, that any inquiry into whether the interrogating officers have focused their suspicions upon theindividual being questioned (assuming those suspicions remain undisclosed) is not relevant for purposes of Miranda.See generally 1 W. LaFave & J. Israel, Criminal Procedure$6.6(a), pp. 489-490 (1984).The State acknowledges that Lieutenant Johnston's andthe other officers' subjective and undisclosed suspicions (orlack thereof) do not bear upon the question whether Stansbury was in custody, for purposes of Miranda, during thestation house interview. It main. tains, however, that the objective facts in the record support a finding that Stansburywas not in custody until his arrest. Stansbury, by contrast,asserts that the objective circumstances show that he was incustody during the entire interrogation. We think it appropriate for the California Supreme Court to consider thisquestion in the first instance. We therefore reverse its511us1$42Z 06-11-96 22:57:02 PAGES OPINPGT327Cite as: 511 U.
