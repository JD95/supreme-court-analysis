In this case, the Maryland Court of Special Appeals heldthat the Fourth Amendment requires police to obtain asearch warrant before searching a vehicle which they haveprobable cause to believe contains illegal drugs. Becausethis holding rests upon an incorrect interpretation of theautomobile exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrantrequirement, we grant the petition for certiorari and reverse.At 11 a.m. on the morning of July 2, 1996, a St. Mary'sCounty (Maryland) Sheriff 's Deputy received a tip from areliable confidential informant that respondent had gone toNew York to buy drugs, and would be returning to Marylandin a rented red Toyota, license number DDY 787, later thatday with a large quantity of cocaine. The deputy investi527US1 Unit: $U82 [05-02-01 19:10:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN466 MARYLAND v. DYSONPer Curiamgated the tip and found that the license number given to himby the informant belonged to a red Toyota Corolla that hadbeen rented to respondent, who was a known drug dealer inSt. Mary's County. When respondent returned to St. Mary'sCounty in the rented car at 1 a.m. on July 3, the deputiesstopped and searched the vehicle, finding 23 grams of crackcocaine in a duffel bag in the trunk. Respondent was arrested, tried, and convicted of conspiracy to possess cocainewith intent to distribute. He appealed, arguing that thetrial court had erroneously denied his motion to suppressthe cocaine on the alternative grounds that the police lackedprobable cause, or that even if there was probable cause, thewarrantless search violated the Fourth Amendment becausethere was sufficient time after the informant's tip to obtaina warrant.The Maryland Court of Special Appeals reversed, 122 Md.App. 413, 712 A. 2d 573 (1998), holding that in order for theautomobile exception to the warrant requirement to apply,there must not only be probable cause to believe that evi-dence of a crime is contained in the automobile, but also aseparate finding of exigency precluding the police fromobtaining a warrant.Id., at 424, 712 A. 2d, at 578. Applying this rule to the facts of the case, the Court of SpecialAppeals concluded that although there was "abundant probable cause," the search violated the Fourth Amendment because there was no exigency that prevented or even made itsignificantly difficult for the police to obtain a search warrant. Id., at 426, 712 A. 2d, at 579. The Maryland Courtof Appeals denied certiorari. 351 Md. 287, 718 A. 2d 235(1998). We grant certiorari and now reverse.The Fourth Amendment generally requires police to secure a warrant before conducting a search. California v.Carney, 471 U. S. 386, 390-391 (1985). As we recognizednearly 75 years ago in Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S.132, 153 (1925), there is an exception to this requirement forsearches of vehicles. And under our established precedent,the "automobile exception" has no separate exigency re527US1 Unit: $U82 [05-02-01 19:10:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN467Cite as: 527 U. S. 465 (1999)Per Curiamquirement. We made this clear in United States v. Ross, 456U. S. 798, 809 (1982), when we said that in cases where therewas probable cause to search a vehicle "a search is not unrea-sonable if based on facts that would justify the issuance of awarrant, even though a warrant has not been actually obtained." (Emphasis added.) In a case with virtually iden-tical facts to this one (even down to the bag of cocaine in thetrunk of the car), Pennsylvania v. Labron, 518 U. S. 938(1996) (per curiam), we repeated that the automobile exception does not have a separate exigency requirement: "If a caris readily mobile and probable cause exists to believe it contains contraband, the Fourth Amendment . . . permits policeto search the vehicle without more."Id., at 940.In this case, the Court of Special Appeals found that therewas "abundant probable cause" that the car contained con-traband. This finding alone satisfies the automobile exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement, aconclusion correctly reached by the trial court when it denied respondent's motion to suppress. The holding of theCourt of Special Appeals that the "automobile exception"requires a separate finding of exigency in addition to a find-ing of probable cause is squarely contrary to our holdings inRoss and Labron. We therefore grant the petition for writof certiorari and reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.*
