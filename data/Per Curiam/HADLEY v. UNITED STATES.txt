RALEYcertiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe sixth circuitNo. 91-719. Argued October 5, 1992--Decided December 1, 1992In 1986, respondent Raley was charged with robbery and with being apersistent felony offender under a Kentucky statute that enhances sentences for repeat felons. He moved to suppress the 1979 and 1981guilty pleas that formed the basis for the latter charge, claiming thatthey were invalid because the records contained no transcripts of theproceedings and hence did not affirmatively show, as required by Boykinv. Alabama, 395 U. S. 238, that the pleas were knowing and voluntary.Under the state procedures governing the hearing on his motion, theultimate burden of persuasion rested with the government, but a presumption of regularity attached to the judgments once the Commonwealth proved their existence, and the burden then shifted to Raley toproduce evidence of their invalidity. As to the 1981 plea, Raley testifiedthat, among other things, he signed a form specifying the charges towhich he agreed to plead guilty and the judge at least advised him ofhis right to a jury trial. His suppression motion was denied, he wasconvicted, and he appealed. The Kentucky Court of Appeals found thatRaley was fully informed of his rights in 1979 and inferred that he remained aware of them in 1981. Raley then filed a federal habeas petition. The District Court rejected his argument that the state courtshad erred in shifting the burden of production to him, but the Court ofAppeals reversed as to the 1981 plea, holding, inter alia, that where notranscript is available, the prosecution has the entire burden of establishing a plea's validity by clear and convincing evidence and no presumption of regularity attaches to the prior judgment.Held:1. Kentucky's burden-of-proof scheme is permissible under the DueProcess Clause.

In the absence of an allegation of government misconduct, itcannot be presumed from the mere unavailability of a transcript on collateral review that a defendant was not advised of his rights. Burgettv. Texas, 389 U. S. 109, distinguished. The presumption of regularitymakes it appropriate to assign a proof burden to the defendant evenwhen a collateral attack rests on constitutional grounds. And the difficulty of proving the invalidity of convictions entered many years agodoes not make it fundamentally unfair to place a burden of productionon the defendant, since the government may not have superior accessto evidence. Nor is Raley's position supported by the state courts' historical treatment of defendants in recidivism proceedings, the widerange of contemporary state practices regarding the allocation of theproof burden, or interpretations of analogous federal laws, see, e. g.,United States v. Gallman, 907 F. 2d 639, 643-645. Pp. 28-34.(c) Due process does not require the Commonwealth to prove thevalidity of a prior conviction by clear and convincing extrarecord evidence. Even if Boykin had addressed the question of measure of proof,it would not necessarily follow that the same standard should apply inrecidivism proceedings. Given the difficulties of proof for both sides, itis not fundamentally unfair to require something less than clear andconvincing evidence when the government is assigned the burden ofpersuasion. There is no historical tradition setting the standard atthis particular level, and contemporary practice is far from uniform.Pp. 34-35.2. The Kentucky courts properly concluded that Raley's 1981 guiltyplea was valid. Their factual determinations are entitled to the presumption of correctness accorded state court factual findings under 28U. S. C. $ 2254(d). Marshall v. Lonberger, 459 U. S. 422, 431-432. TheKentucky Court of Appeals fairly inferred from Raley's 1979 experiencethat he understood the consequences of his 1981 plea. See, e. g., id., at437. That, combined with his admission that he understood the chargesagainst him and his self-serving testimony that he could not rememberwhether the trial judge advised him of other rights, satisfied every courtthat has considered the issue that the government carried its burden ofpersuasion under the Kentucky scheme.

Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 532.080 (Michie 1990), providesmandatory minimum sentences for repeat felons. UnderKentucky law, a defendant charged as a persistent felony offender may challenge prior convictions that form the basisof the charge on the ground that they are invalid. Respondent, who was indicted under the statute, claimed that twoconvictions offered against him were invalid underBoykinv. Alabama, 395 U. S. 238 (1969). The trial court, after ahearing, rejected this claim, and respondent was convictedand sentenced as a persistent felony offender. After exhausting his state remedies, respondent petitioned for a writof habeas corpus in the United States District Court for theWestern District of Kentucky. The District Court deniedrelief, but the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit orderedthat the writ conditionally issue, concluding that the trialcourt proceedings were constitutionally infirm.

S. 20 (1992)Opinion of the CourtAmendment because it does not require the governmentto carry the entire burden of proof by clear and convincingevidence when a transcript of the prior plea proceedingis unavailable.IIn May 1986, the Commonwealth charged respondentRicky Harold Raley with robbery and with being a persistent felony offender in the first degree.* The latter chargewas based on two burglaries to which respondent hadpleaded guilty in November 1979 and October 1981. Re-spondent never appealed his convictions for those crimes.He nevertheless moved to suppress them in the persistentfelony offender proceeding, arguing that they were invalidunder Boykin because the records did not contain transcriptsof the plea proceedings and hence did not affirmatively showthat respondent's guilty pleas were knowing and voluntary.The trial court held a hearing according to procedures setforth in Commonwealth v. Gadd, 665 S. W. 2d 915 (Ky. 1984),andDunn v. Commonwealth, 703 S. W. 2d 874 (Ky. 1985),cert. denied, 479 U. S. 832 (1986). In Gadd, the SupremeCourt of Kentucky observed that the persistent felony of-fender statute requires that the prosecution prove only thefact of a previous conviction beyond a reasonable doubt; theCommonwealth need not also show that the conviction wasvalidly obtained. 665 S. W. 2d, at 917. But, citing Burgettv.Texas, 389 U. S. 109 (1967), the court also held that defend*"A persistent felony offender in the first degree is a person who is morethan twenty-one (21) years of age and who stands convicted of a felonyafter having been convicted of two (2) or more felonies." Ky. Rev. Stat.Ann. $ 532.080(3) (Michie 1990). The applicable penalty depends upon thenature of the offense for which the defendant presently stands convicted.A defendant convicted both of second-degree robbery (the crime to whichrespondent ultimately pleaded guilty) and of being a first-degree persistent felony offender faces a mandatory sentence of 10 to 20 years.$$ 515.030, 532.080(6)(b). A first-degree persistent felony offender is alsoineligible for probation or parole until he has served at least 10 years.$ 532.080(7).506us1$$5J 08-22-96 16:45:54 PAGES OPINPGT24 PARKE v. RALEYOpinion of the Courtants must be able to attack a prior conviction's invalidity.665 S. W. 2d, at 917. Dunn v. Commonwealth clarified theprocedures to be followed. When a defendant challenges aprevious conviction through a suppression motion, the Commonwealth must prove the existence of the judgment onwhich it intends to rely. Once this is done, a presumptionof regularity attaches, and the burden shifts to the defendantto produce evidence that his rights were infringed or someprocedural irregularity occurred in the earlier proceeding.If the defendant refutes the presumption of regularity, theburden shifts back to the government affirmatively to showthat the underlying judgment was entered in a manner thatdid, in fact, protect the defendant's rights. 703 S. W. 2d,at 876.After the prosecution filed certified copies of the priorjudgments of conviction for burglary, both sides presentedevidence about the earlier plea proceedings. Respondenttestified that he had an 11th grade education, that he readadequately, that he was not intoxicated or otherwise mentally impaired when he entered the challenged pleas, andthat he was represented by counsel on both occasions. Heremembered the trial judge in each case asking him whetherhis plea was voluntary, but he said he could not rememberwhether he was specifically told about the rights he waivedby pleading guilty. The government's evidence showed thatin the 1979 proceeding, respondent signed (though he laterclaimed not to have read) a "Plea of Guilty" form, whichstated that he understood the charges against him, the maximum punishment he faced, his constitutional rights, and thata guilty plea waived those rights. The attorney who represented respondent in the first case verified his own signatureon another part of the form indicating that he had fully explained respondent's rights to him. As to the 1981 plea, respondent acknowledged signing a form that specified thecharges to which he agreed to plead guilty. He also ad506us1$$5J 08-22-96 16:45:54 PAGES OPINPGT25Cite as: 506 U. S. 20 (1992)Opinion of the Courtmitted that the judge had at least advised him of his rightto a jury trial.Based on this evidence, the trial court denied respondent'ssuppression motion. Respondent then entered a conditionalguilty plea on the robbery and the persistent felony offendercounts, reserving the right to appeal the suppression deter-mination. The trial court sentenced him to 5 years for robbery, enhanced to 10 because of the persistent felony of-fender conviction.The Kentucky Court of Appeals affirmed. It found thetotality of circumstances surrounding the 1979 plea sufficientto support a finding that the plea was knowing and voluntary.It also upheld use of the 1981 conviction. The court explained that respondent's knowledge of his rights in November 1979 permitted an inference that he remained aware ofthem 23 months later. Respondent's testimony, moreover,indicated that his sophistication regarding his legal rightshad increased substantially after his first conviction. TheSupreme Court of Kentucky denied discretionary review.Respondent then filed a federal habeas petition, arguingthat the Kentucky courts had erred in requiring him toadduce evidence, rather than requiring the Commonwealthaffirmatively to prove the prior convictions' validity. TheDistrict Court denied the petition for essentially the samereasons given by the Kentucky Court of Appeals. Raley v.Parke, Civ. Action No. C89-0756-L(A) (WD Ky., Mar. 15,1990). The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, however,agreed with respondent, relying on its recent decision inDunn v. Simmons, 877 F. 2d 1275 (1989), cert. denied, 494U. S. 1061 (1990). 945 F. 2d 137 (1991). Simmons held thatwhen no transcript of the prior guilty plea proceeding exists,the prosecution has the entire burden of establishing theplea's validity, and no presumption of regularity attaches tothe final judgment. 877 F. 2d, at 1277. It also held thatwhen the prosecution seeks to demonstrate the regularity ofthe prior proceeding with extrarecord evidence, that evi506us1$$5J 08-22-96 16:45:54 PAGES OPINPGT26 PARKE v. RALEYOpinion of the Courtdence must be "clear and convincing." Ibid. AlthoughSimmons was decided after respondent's persistent felonyoffender conviction became final, the Commonwealth did notargue that Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989), barred itsapplication to this case. Cf. Collins v. Youngblood, 497 U. S.37, 40-41 (1990) (Teague not jurisdictional).The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's determination with respect to the 1979 plea but reversed withrespect to the 1981 plea. It declined to infer that respondent remembered his rights from 1979, reasoning that such aninference would give rise to line-drawing problems andwould discriminate improperly between accused recidivistsand first offenders on the basis of prior court experience.The Court of Appeals observed that because the trial courthearing took place beforeSimmons was decided, the Com-monwealth had not yet had an opportunity to try to meetthe higher standard of proof that decision imposed. Thus,rather than issue the writ of habeas corpus outright, theCourt of Appeals directed the District Court to grant thewrit if Kentucky did not hold a new hearing on the validityof the 1981 conviction in compliance with Simmons within90 days. We granted certiorari. 503 U. S. 905 (1992).IIAStatutes that punish recidivists more severely than firstoffenders have a long tradition in this country that datesback to colonial times. See, e. g., I The Acts and Resolves,Public and Private, of the Province of Massachusetts Bay 52(Boston 1869) (1692 statute providing progressive punish-ments for robbery and burglary); 3 Laws of Virginia 276-278(W. Henning ed. 1823) (1705 recidivism statute dealing withhog stealing); see alsoGraham v. West Virginia, 224 U. S.616, 623 (1912). Such laws currently are in effect in all 50States, see Department of Justice, Statutes Requiring theUse of Criminal History Record Information 17-41 (June506us1$$5J 08-22-96 16:45:54 PAGES OPINPGT27Cite as: 506 U. S. 20 (1992)Opinion of the Court1991) (NJC-129846), and several have been enacted by theFederal Government, as well, see,e. g., 18 U. S. C. $ 924(e)(Armed Career Criminal Act); 21 U. S. C. $$ 842(c)(2)(b),843(c), 844(a) (provisions of the Controlled Substances Act);see also United States Sentencing Commission, GuidelinesManual $ 4A1.1 (Nov. 1992) (prior criminal conduct enhancescriminal history for purpose of determining sentencingrange).States have a valid interest in deterring and segregatinghabitual criminals. See Rummel v. Estelle, 445 U. S. 263,284 (1980). We have said before that a charge under a recidivism statute does not state a separate offense, but goes topunishment only. See Oyler v. Boles, 368 U. S. 448, 452(1962); Graham, supra, at 623-624; McDonald v. Massachusetts, 180 U. S. 311, 313 (1901). And we have repeatedly upheld recidivism statutes "against contentions that they violate constitutional strictures dealing with double jeopardy,ex post facto laws, cruel and unusual punishment, due process, equal protection, and privileges and immunities." Spencer v. Texas, 385 U. S. 554, 560 (1967) (citing Oyler, supra;Gryger v. Burke, 334 U. S. 728 (1948); Graham, supra; McDonald, supra; Moore v. Missouri, 159 U. S. 673 (1895)).But see Solem v. Helm, 463 U. S. 277 (1983) (life sentencewithout parole imposed under recidivism statute violatedEighth Amendment when current conviction was for passinga bad check and prior offenses were similarly minor).The States' freedom to define the types of convictions thatmay be used for sentence enhancement is not unlimited. InBurgett v. Texas, 389 U. S. 109 (1967), we held that uncounseled convictions cannot be used "against a person either tosupport guilt or enhance punishment for another offense."Id., at 115. This Court has nevertheless also expressed awillingness to uphold, under the Due Process Clause, a variety of state procedures for implementing otherwise valid recidivism statutes. See Spencer, supra (due process allowsgovernment to introduce proof of past convictions before506us1$$5J 08-22-96 16:45:54 PAGES OPINPGT28 PARKE v. RALEYOpinion of the Courtjury has rendered guilt determination for current offense);Oyler, supra (due process does not require advance noticethat trial for substantive offense will be followed by habitual-criminal accusation). As Justice Harlan observed 25 yearsago in Spencer, the Court is not "a rule-making organ forthe promulgation of state rules of criminal procedure." 385U. S., at 564. "Tolerance for a spectrum of state proceduresdealing with [recidivism] is especially appropriate" given thehigh rate of recidivism and the diversity of approaches thatStates have developed for addressing it.Id., at 566. Wethink this reasoning remains persuasive today; studies suggest that as many as two-thirds of those arrested have priorcriminal records, often from other jurisdictions. See Department of Justice, supra, at 1; see also Spencer, supra, at566, n. 9. The narrow question we face is whether due process permits Kentucky to employ its particular burden-of-proof scheme when allowing recidivism defendants to attackprevious convictions as invalid under Boykin. In our view,Kentucky's burden-shifting rule easily passes constitutionalmuster. BAs an initial matter, we decline to reach the broad argu-ment advanced by petitioner and the Solicitor General thatKentucky's procedure is a fortiori constitutional because,with narrow exceptions not applicable here, due process doesnot require state courts to permit challenges to guilty pleasused for enhancement purposes at all. Petitioner did notmake this argument below or in his petition for certiorari.We ordinarily do not reach issues not raised in the petitionfor certiorari, see Yee v. Escondido, 503 U. S. 519, 535 (1992),and it is unnecessary for us to determine whether Statesmust allow recidivism defendants to challenge prior guiltypleas because Kentucky does allow such challenges. Weturn, then, to the question before us.It is beyond dispute that a guilty plea must be both knowing and voluntary. See, e. g., Boykin, 395 U. S., at 242; Mc506us1$$5J 08-22-96 16:45:54 PAGES OPINPGT29Cite as: 506 U. S. 20 (1992)Opinion of the CourtCarthy v. United States, 394 U. S. 459, 466 (1969). "Thestandard was and remains whether the plea represents a voluntary and intelligent choice among the alternative coursesof action open to the defendant."North Carolina v. Alford,400 U. S. 25, 31 (1970). That is so because a guilty plea constitutes a waiver of three constitutional rights: the right toa jury trial, the right to confront one's accusers, and the privilege against self-incrimination. Boykin, 395 U. S., at 243.InBoykin the Court found reversible error when a trialjudge accepted a defendant's guilty plea without creating arecord affirmatively showing that the plea was knowing andvoluntary. Id., at 242. The Sixth Circuit thought rejectionof Kentucky's burden-shifting scheme compelled by Boykin'sstatement that the waiver of rights resulting from a guiltyplea cannot be "presume[d] . . . from a silent record." Id.,at 243. Kentucky favors the prosecution with only an initialpresumption upon proof of the existence of a prior judgment;but because a defendant may be unable to offer rebuttal evidence, the Sixth Circuit reasoned that Kentucky's procedureimproperly permits the Commonwealth to carry its burdenof persuasion upon a "bare record of a conviction." Simmons, 877 F. 2d, at 1278.We see no tension between the Kentucky scheme and Boykin. Boykin involved direct review of a conviction allegedlybased upon an uninformed guilty plea. Respondent, however, never appealed his earlier convictions. They becamefinal years ago, and he now seeks to revisit the question oftheir validity in a separate recidivism proceeding. To import Boykin's presumption of invalidity into this very different context would, in our view, improperly ignore anotherpresumption deeply rooted in our jurisprudence: the "presumption of regularity" that attaches to final judgments,even when the question is waiver of constitutional rights.Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458, 464, 468 (1938). Althoughwe are perhaps most familiar with this principle in habeascorpus actions, see, e. g., Barefoot v. Estelle, 463 U. S. 880,506us1$$5J 08-22-96 16:45:54 PAGES OPINPGT30 PARKE v. RALEYOpinion of the Court887 (1983); Johnson, supra, it has long been applied equallyto other forms of collateral attack, see,e. g., Voorhees v. Jackson, 10 Pet. 449, 472 (1836) (observing, in a collateral chal-lenge to a court-ordered sale of property in an ejectmentaction, that "[t]here is no principle of law better settled, thanthat every act of a court of competent jurisdiction shall bepresumed to have been rightly done, till the contrary appears"). Respondent, by definition, collaterally attacked hisprevious convictions; he sought to deprive them of their normal force and effect in a proceeding that had an independentpurpose other than to overturn the prior judgments. SeeBlack's Law Dictionary 261 (6th ed. 1990); see also Lewis v.United States, 445 U. S. 55, 58, 65 (1980) (challenge to uncounseled prior conviction used as predicate for subsequentconviction characterized as "collateral").There is no good reason to suspend the presumption ofregularity here. This is not a case in which an extant transcript is suspiciously "silent" on the question whether thedefendant waived constitutional rights. Evidently, no transcripts or other records of the earlier plea colloquies exist atall. Transcripts of guilty plea proceedings are normallymade in Kentucky only if a direct appeal is taken or uponthe trial judge's specific direction, Tr. of Oral Arg. 13-14, andthe stenographer's notes and any tapes made of the proceedings normally are not preserved more than five years, id., at16-17. The circumstance of a missing or nonexistent recordis, we suspect, not atypical, particularly when the prior conviction is several years old. But Boykin colloquies havebeen required for nearly a quarter century. On collateralreview, we think it defies logic to presume from the mereunavailability of a transcript (assuming no allegation that theunavailability is due to governmental misconduct) that thedefendant was not advised of his rights. In this situation,Boykin does not prohibit a state court from presuming, atleast initially, that a final judgment of conviction offered forpurposes of sentence enhancement was validly obtained.506us1$$5J 08-22-96 16:45:54 PAGES OPINPGT31Cite as: 506 U. S. 20 (1992)Opinion of the CourtBurgett v. Texas, 389 U. S. 109 (1967), does not necessitatea different result. There the Court held that a prior conviction could not be used for sentence enhancement because therecord of the earlier proceeding did not show that the defendant had waived his right to counsel. Id., at 114-115.Respondent suggests that because Burgett involved a staterecidivism proceeding, it stands for the proposition thatevery previous conviction used to enhance punishment is"presumptively void" if waiver of a claimed constitutionalright does not appear from the face of the record. Brief forRespondent 14-15. We do not read the decision so broadly.At the time the prior conviction at issue in Burgett was entered, state criminal defendants' federal constitutional rightto counsel had not yet been recognized, and so it was reasonable to presume that the defendant had not waived a righthe did not possess. As we have already explained, the samecannot be said about a record that, by virtue of its unavailability on collateral review, fails to show compliance with thewell-established Boykin requirements.Respondent argues that imposing even a burden of production on him is fundamentally unfair because "a constitutionally protected right is in question." Brief for Respondent 15. By this he apparently refers to the Fifth andSixth Amendment rights that a defendant waives by pleading guilty. Our precedents make clear, however, that evenwhen a collateral attack on a final conviction rests on constitutional grounds, the presumption of regularity that attaches to final judgments makes it appropriate to assign aproof burden to the defendant. See, e. g., Johnson, supra,at 468-469.Respondent also contends that Kentucky's rule is unfairbecause it may be difficult to prove the invalidity of a conviction entered many years ago, perhaps in another jurisdiction,when records are unavailable and witnesses inaccessible.We have little doubt that serious practical difficulties willconfront any party assigned an evidentiary burden in such506us1$$5J 08-22-96 16:45:54 PAGES OPINPGT32 PARKE v. RALEYOpinion of the Courtcircumstances. See Loper v. Beto, 405 U. S. 473, 500-501(1972) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting). "The Due ProcessClause does not, however, require a State to adopt one proce-dure over another on the basis that it may produce resultsmore favorable to the accused." Medina v. California, 505U. S. 437, 451 (1992). When a defendant challenges the va-lidity of a previous guilty plea, the government will not invariably, or perhaps even usually, have superior access toevidence. Indeed, when the plea was entered in another jurisdiction, the defendant may be the only witness who wasactually present at the earlier proceeding. If raising aBoykin claim and pointing to a missing record suffices to placethe entire burden of proof on the government, the prosecution will not infrequently be forced to expend considerableeffort and expense attempting to reconstruct records fromfarflung States where procedures are unfamiliar and memories unreliable. To the extent that the government fails tocarry its burden due to the staleness or unavailability ofevidence, of course, its legitimate interest in differentiallypunishing repeat offenders is compromised. In light of therelative positions of the defendant and the prosecution inrecidivism proceedings, we cannot say that it is fundamentally unfair to place at least a burden of production on thedefendant.Respondent cites no historical tradition or contemporarypractice indicating that Kentucky's scheme violates due process. See Medina, supra, at 446, 447. For much of our history, it appears that state courts altogether prohibited defendants in recidivism proceedings from challenging priorconvictions as erroneous, as opposed to void for lack of jurisdiction. See, e. g., Kelly v. People, 115 Ill. 583, 588, 4 N. E.644, 645-646 (1886); accord, State v. Webb, 36 N. D. 235, 243,162 N. W. 358, 361 (1917). In recent years state courts havepermitted various challenges to prior convictions and haveallocated proof burdens differently. Some, like the SixthCircuit, evidently place the full burden on the prosecution.506us1$$5J 08-22-96 16:45:54 PAGES OPINPGT33Cite as: 506 U. S. 20 (1992)Opinion of the CourtSee, e. g., State v. Elling, 11 Ohio Misc. 2d 13, 15, 463 N. E. 2d668, 670 (Com. Pl. 1983) (challenge to allegedly uncounseledconviction); State v. Hennings, 100 Wash. 2d 379, 382, 670 P.2d 256, 257 (1983) (challenge to guilty plea). Others assignthe entire burden to the defendant once the government hasestablished the fact of conviction. See, e. g., People v. Harris, 61 N. Y. 2d 9, 15, 459 N. E. 2d 170, 172 (1983) (guiltyplea); see also D. C. Code Ann. $ 23-111(c)(2) (1989); N. C.Gen. Stat. $ 15A-980(c) (1988). Several, like Kentucky, takea middle position that requires the defendant to produce evi-dence of invalidity once the fact of conviction is proved butthat shifts the burden back to the prosecution once the defendant satisfies his burden of production. See, e. g., Watkins v. People, 655 P. 2d 834, 837 (Colo. 1982) (guilty plea);State v. O'Neil, 91 N. M. 727, 729, 580 P. 2d 495, 497 (Ct. App.1978) (uncounseled conviction); State v. Triptow, 770 P. 2d146, 149 (Utah 1989) (same). This range of contemporarystate practice certainly does not suggest that allocating someburden to the defendant is fundamentally unfair.Interpretations of analogous federal laws by the Courts ofAppeals point even more strongly away from respondent'sposition. Under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U. S. C.$ 924(e), Courts of Appeals have placed on the defendant theentire burden of proving the invalidity of a prior convictionbased on a guilty plea. See, e. g., United States v. Gallman,907 F. 2d 639, 643-645 (CA7 1990), cert. denied, 499 U. S. 908(1991); accord, United States v. Paleo, 967 F. 2d 7, 13 (CA11992); United States v.

Ruo, 943 F. 2d 1274, 1276 (CA11 1991).Courts of Appeals have also allocated the full burden of proofto defendants claiming that an invalid guilty plea renders aprior conviction unavailable for purposes of calculating criminal history under the Sentencing Guidelines. See, e. g.,United States v. Boyer, 931 F. 2d 1201, 1204-1205 (CA7),cert. denied, 502 U. S. 873 (1991). And the text of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970506us1$$5J 08-22-96 16:45:54 PAGES OPINPGT34 PARKE v. RALEYOpinion of the Courtitself clearly provides that a defendant raising a constitu-tional challenge to a prior conviction used for sentenceenhancement bears the burden of proof. See 21 U. S. C.$ 851(c)(2).In sum, neither our precedents nor historical or contempo-rary practice compel the conclusion that Kentucky's burdenshifting rule violates due process, and we cannot say thatthe rule is fundamentally unfair in its operation. Accordingly, we hold that the Due Process Clause permits a Stateto impose a burden of production on a recidivism defendant who challenges the validity of a prior conviction underBoykin. CPetitioner also challenges the Sixth Circuit's holding thatthe prosecution's extrarecord evidence must be clear andconvincing. In petitioner's view, the preponderance of theevidence standard applicable to constitutional claims raisedon federal habeas, see, e. g., Johnson, 304 U. S., at 468-469,is appropriate. The Sixth Circuit based its conclusion to thecontrary on Boykin, observing that an "extraordinary stand-ard of persuasion" is justified "in view of misgivings inherentin `collateral proceedings that seek to probe murky memo-ries.' "Simmons, 877 F. 2d, at 1277 (quoting Boykin, 395U. S., at 244); see alsoRoddy v. Black, 516 F. 2d 1380, 1384(CA6), cert. denied, 423 U. S. 917 (1975). Respondent, insupport of the Sixth Circuit's heightened standard, reiterateshis arguments regarding the importance of the constitutionalrights at stake and the government's position relative tothe defendant's.Our analysis of this question parallels our discussion of theproper allocation of proof burdens.Boykin did not addressthe question of measure of proof, and even if it had, it wouldnot necessarily follow that the same standard should applyin recidivism proceedings. We find respondent's argumentsno more persuasive here than they were in the allocationcontext. Given the difficulties of proof for both sides, it is506us1$$5J 08-22-96 16:45:55 PAGES OPINPGT35Cite as: 506 U. S. 20 (1992)Opinion of the Courtnot obvious to us that, once a State assigns the governmentthe burden of persuasion, requiring anything less than clearand convincing extrinsic evidence is fundamentally unfair.Again, we are pointed to no historical tradition setting thestandard of proof at this particular level. And contempo-rary practice is far from uniform; state courts that imposethe ultimate burden on the government appear to demandproof ranging from preponderance, seeTriptow, supra, at149; Watkins, supra, at 837, to beyond a reasonable doubt,see Hennings, supra, at 382, 670 P. 2d, at 257. We are there-fore unprepared to say that when the government carriesthe ultimate burden of persuasion and no transcript of theprior proceeding exists, the Due Process Clause requires theCommonwealth to prove the validity of the conviction byclear and convincing extrarecord evidence.IIIRespondent no longer challenges the validity of his 1979plea. Thus, the final issue before us is whether the Kentucky courts properly concluded that respondent's 1981guilty plea was valid. For the proper standard of review,petitioner cites Marshall v. Lonberger, 459 U. S. 422 (1983),a case quite similar to this one. InLonberger, the state de-fendant challenged a prior conviction used to obtain a deathsentence on the ground that the conviction was based on aguilty plea invalid underBoykin. We held that although"the governing standard as to whether a plea of guilty isvoluntary for purposes of the Federal Constitution is a ques-tion of federal law," 459 U. S., at 431, questions of historicalfact, including inferences properly drawn from such facts,are in this context entitled to the presumption of correctness accorded state court factual findings under 28 U. S. C.$ 2254(d),Lonberger, supra, at 431-432; cf. Miller v. Fenton,474 U. S. 104, 113, 115, 117 (1985) (holding that the questionwhether a confession is voluntary is subject to independentfederal determination, expressly distinguishing Lonberger).506us1$$5J 08-22-96 16:45:55 PAGES OPINPGT36 PARKE v. RALEYOpinion of the CourtWe said that the federal habeas courts in Lonberger werebound to respect the contents of the record of the prior pleaproceeding, the state trial court's findings that the defendantwas "an intelligent individual, well experienced in the criminal processes and well represented at all stages of the proceedings by competent and capable counsel," the similar con-clusions of the state appellate court, and "inferences fairlydeducible from these facts." Lonberger, supra, at 435 (in-ternal quotation marks omitted); see alsoSumner v. Mata,449 U. S. 539, 545-547 (1981) (deference owed to findings ofboth state trial and appellate courts).We note that petitioner's theory of the case, which we havedeclined to consider, suggests a different standard. If Kentucky's procedure is indeed not constitutionally mandated,the Kentucky courts' determination that respondent understood his rights when he entered his plea would seem tobe reviewable at most for sufficiency of the evidence underJackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307 (1979). There is no needto choose between the two standards of review in this case,however, because we are convinced that the Kentuckycourts' factual determinations are "fairly supported by therecord" within the meaning of 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d)(8).The Kentucky Court of Appeals, reviewing the trialcourt's decision not to suppress the 1981 conviction, observedthat respondent had an 11th grade education, could read adequately, was represented by counsel in the 1981 proceedings,and was in no way mentally impaired when he entered hisplea. The court noted that respondent had signed a formspecifying the charges to which he agreed to plead guilty.And it found that he had been fully advised of his rights in1979. Respondent does not now dispute those determinations. The Kentucky Court of Appeals inferred that respondent remained aware in 1981 of the rights of which hewas advised in 1979. Supporting that inference was thecourt's determination, based on respondent's testimony atthe trial court hearing, that his "knowledge and sophistica506us1$$5J 08-22-96 16:45:55 PAGES OPINPGT37Cite as: 506 U. S. 20 (1992)Blackmun, J., concurring in judgmenttion regarding his rights under our judicial system increasedsubstantially after his first conviction." App. to Pet. forCert. A32. Respondent knew, for example, the differencebetween first- and second-degree persistent felony offendercharges, and he knew the sentencing and parole requirements for both offenses. "[H]e indicated that the evidenceagainst him and his lack of a strong defense had persuadedhim to accept the Commonwealth's offered plea bargain inreturn for a recommendation that he be given a minimumsentence. In fact, he voluntarily and knowingly chose notto risk the uncertainties of a jury trial."Id., at 32-33.We have previously treated evidence of a defendant's priorexperience with the criminal justice system as relevant tothe question whether he knowingly waived constitutionalrights, see, e. g., Lonberger, supra, at 437; Gryger v. Burke,334 U. S., at 730, and we think the Kentucky Court of Appeals fairly inferred that respondent understood the full consequences of his 1981 plea. That, combined with respondent's admission that he understood the charges against himand his self-serving testimony that he simply could not remember whether the trial judge advised him of other rights,satisfied every court that has considered the issue that thegovernment carried its burden of persuasion under the Kentucky framework. We cannot say that this was error.The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuitis accordingly
