The application to vacate the stay of execution presentedto Justice Blackmun has been referred to the Court.Applying the prevailing legal standard, it is "particularlyegregious" to enter a stay on second or subsequent habeaspetitions unless "there are substantial grounds upon whichrelief might be granted." Herrera v. Collins, 506 U. S. 390,425, 426 (1993) (O'Connor, J., joined by Kennedy, J., concurring) (internal quotation marks omitted). No substantialgrounds were presented in the present case. The DistrictCourt stated that the "facts in Herrera mirror those in thepresent case." No. 93-0674-CV-1 (WD Mo., July 19, 1993).This assessment was not even questioned by the Court ofAppeals, and is obviously correct. There is therefore noconceivable need for the Court of Appeals to engage in "moredetailed study" over the next five weeks to resolve thisclaim. See 999 F. 2d 1219 (CA8 1993).It is an abuse of discretion for a federal court to interferewith the orderly process of a State's criminal justice systemin a case raising claims that are for all relevant purposesindistinguishable from those we recently rejected in Herrera. Accordingly, the Court of Appeals' stay must bevacated.509us3119z 03-27-96 13:54:02 PAGES OPINPGT824 DELO v. BLAIRBlackmun, J., dissentingJustice Souter would deny the application to vacatethe stay.Justice Blackmun, with whom Justice Stevens joins,dissenting.The Court errs twice in granting the State's application tovacate the Court of Appeals' stay of execution. First, iterrs by affording insufficient deference to the Court of Appeals' decision. Second, it errs by letting stand the DistrictCourt's decision, which was itself erroneous.I"The standard under which we consider motions to vacatestays of execution is deferential, and properly so. Onlywhen the lower courts have clearly abused their discretionin granting a stay should we take the extraordinary step ofoverturning such a decision." Dugger v. Johnson, 485 U. S.945, 947 (1988) (O'Connor, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J.,dissenting). Accord, Barefoot v. Estelle, 463 U. S. 880, 896(1983); Wainwright v. Spenkelink, 442 U. S. 901, 905 (1979)(Rehnquist, J., dissenting). In this case, the Court of Appeals granted a temporary stay of execution to allow it timeproperly to consider Blair's appeal. In my view, its decisionto do so does not constitute an abuse of discretion.The State likens this case to Delo v. Stokes, 495 U. S. 320(1990), in which this Court vacated a stay of execution because the prisoner's habeas petition "clearly constitute[d] anabuse of the writ." Id., at 321. Although the habeas petition currently before the Court of Appeals is Blair's third,the abuse of the writ doctrine cannot serve as the basis forvacating this stay. Blair's principal contention in his federalhabeas petition is that he is actually innocent, and this Courthas recognized an exception to the abuse of the writ doctrinewhere a habeas petitioner can show that he probably is innocent. See McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467, 495 (1991).509us3119z 03-27-96 13:54:02 PAGES OPINPGT825Cite as: 509 U. S. 823 (1993)Blackmun, J., dissentingIIThe Court's second error is that it lets stand the DistrictCourt's decision denying Blair's claim without an evidentiaryhearing. In Herrera v. Collins, 506 U. S. 390 (1993), thisCourt assumed that "in a capital case a truly persuasivedemonstration of `actual innocence' made after trial wouldrender the execution of a defendant unconstitutional, andwarrant federal habeas relief if there were no state avenueopen to process such a claim." Id., at 417. The Court provided little guidance about what sort of showing would be"truly persuasive." Yet despite the uncertain contours ofthis constitutional right, federal courts have an obligation totreat actual-innocence claims just as they would any otherconstitutional claim brought pursuant to 28 U. S. C. $ 2254.The rules governing federal habeas, not addressed by theHerrera majority, provide that "[a] district court may sum-marily dismiss a habeas petition only if `it plainly appearsfrom the face of the petition and any exhibits annexed to itthat the petitioner is not entitled to relief.' 28 U. S. C.$ 2254 Rule 4." 506 U. S., at 445 (dissenting opinion). "If. . . the petition raises factual questions and the State hasfailed to provide a full and fair hearing, the district court isrequired to hold an evidentiary hearing." Id., at 441 (emphasis added), citing Townsend v. Sain, 372 U. S. 293, 313(1963).In this case, Blair has submitted seven affidavits tendingto show that he is innocent of the crime for which he hasbeen sentenced to death. The State does not dispute thatno state court remains open to hear Blair's claim. BecauseBlair's affidavits raise factual questions that cannot be dis-missed summarily, the District Court erred in denying petitioner's claim without an evidentiary hearing.03-16-97 18:05:31 509BV$not1Reporter's NoteThe next page is purposely numbered 901.

Reported below: 172 Wis. 2d 86, 492 N. W. 2d 311.Justice White, with whom Justice Thomas joins, dissenting.In this case, the Wisconsin Supreme Court held that policeexecuting a search warrant for narcotics in a private residencewere justified in frisking all persons found on the premises forweapons. Because that holding places the Wisconsin SupremeCourt in conflict with other state courts, I would grant certiorari.While executing a search warrant for cocaine at a residence,Milwaukee police rounded up the five persons found on the prem-ises, handcuffed them, and frisked them for weapons. While patting down petitioner, an officer felt a soft bulge in petitioner'spocket that she believed to be cocaine or marijuana. The officerasked petitioner what it was and petitioner told the officer to"[f]ind out for [her]self." The officer then reached into the pocketand retrieved a baggie containing bindles of cocaine. In uphold-ing petitioner's conviction for possession of cocaine, the WisconsinSupreme Court held that the patdown search of petitioner waspermissible under Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1 (1968), and that theseizure of the cocaine was proper under a "plain-touch corollaryto the plain-view doctrine." 172 Wis. 2d 86, 101, 492 N. W. 2d311, 317 (1992).In holding that police had reasonable suspicion to frisk petitioner, the court below noted that "[a] magistrate had found prob-able cause to believe that cocaine trafficking was taking place inthe residence in which officers found [petitioner]" and that "weap-ons are often `tools of the trade' for drug dealers." Id., at 96,492 N. W. 2d, at 315. Other state courts have upheld patdownsearches of persons encountered during the execution of a narcotics search warrant in a private residence on the same rationale.See, e. g., State v. Alamont, 577 A. 2d 665, 667-668 (R. I. 1990);State v. Zearley, 444 N. W. 2d 353, 357 (N. D. 1989); People v.Thurman, 209 Cal. App. 3d 817, 824, 257 Cal. Rptr. 517, 520(1989). Others, however, have disallowed patdown searches onessentially identical facts, holding that a defendant's " `mere presence' at a private residence being searched pursuant to a searchwarrant cannot justify a frisk of [the defendant's] person." Statev. Broadnax, 98 Wash. 2d 289, 295, 654 P. 2d 96, 101 (1982); seealsoUnited States v. Harvey, 897 F. 2d 1300, 1304, n. 2 (CA51990). Specifically, the courts disagree over whether this Court's509ORD$$1Y 06-05-99 17:49:57 PGT*ORD1BV (Bound Volume)915ORDERSJune 21, 1993509 U. S.holding in Ybarra v. Illinois, 444 U. S. 85 (1979), that police couldnot frisk all persons present in a public tavern while executinga search warrant based merely on their presence there applieswhere a search warrant for drugs is executed in a private home.The court below distinguished Ybarra on the grounds that occu-pants found in a private residence, unlike those found in a publictavern, are "very likely" to be associated with any illegal narcoticsactivity on the premises and thus likely to be armed and dangerous. 172 Wis. 2d, at 98, 492 N. W. 2d, at 316; accord, Alamont,supra, at 668; Zearley, supra, at 357; Thurman, supra, at 824-825,257 Cal. Rptr., at 520-521. The Washington Supreme Court inBroadnax, however, rejected this reasoning and held Ybarra tobe controlling. Broadnax, supra, at 295, 654 P. 2d, at 101.In my view, the issue is of significant practical importance tolaw enforcement officers executing search warrants and to thecitizens they encounter while doing so. I would grant certiorarito resolve the constitutional question.No. 92-8725 (A-890). Zuckerman v. United States. C. A.3d Cir.

Now, the bio-logical father appears, marries the mother, and claims paternalstatus toward Jessica.The Supreme Court of Iowa has ruled that Jessica must bereturned to her biological parents regardless of whether suchaction would be in her best interests. See In re B. G. C., 496N. W. 2d 239 (1992). Jessica, through her next friend, filed anaction in Michigan state court, claiming that she has a constitutional right to a determination of her best interests in awardingcustody. The DeBoers also filed suit, arguing that federal lawauthorizes the Michigan state court to modify the custody decreeissued in Iowa since the Iowa courts did not at all consider Jessica's best interests, an argument supported by a unanimous deci-sion of the Supreme Court of New Jersey. SeeE. E. B. v. D. A.,89 N. J. 595, 446 A. 2d 871 (1982), cert. denied sub nom. Angle v.Bowen, 459 U. S. 1210 (1983). The Supreme Court of Michiganrejected the New Jersey decision and concluded that federal lawrequires deference to the custody decree issued in Iowa even ifJessica's best interests are left unconsidered. SeeIn re Clausen,442 Mich. 648, 502 N. W. 2d 649 (1993).Jessica, through her next friend, asks that we stay the decisionof the Supreme Court of Michigan until we have had an opportunity to review the issues presented. While I am not sure wherethe ultimate legalities or equities lie, I am sure that I am notwilling to wash my hands of this case at this stage, with thepersonal vulnerability of the child so much at risk, and with theSupreme Court of New Jersey and the Supreme Court of Michi-gan in fundamental disagreement over the duty and authority ofstate courts to consider the best interests of a child when render-ing a custody decree.I therefore would grant the application for a stay, pending ourcareful and thoughtful consideration of the petition for certiorariand its disposition in due course.

DEBOER et al.on application for stayNo. A-64. Decided July 26, 1993*Applications to stay enforcement of a Michigan Supreme Court order directing applicant DeBoers to deliver applicant child to her natural parents in Iowa are denied. There is neither a reasonable probability thatthe Court will grant certiorari nor a fair prospect that, if it did so, itwould conclude that the decision below is erroneous. Determinationsmade by the Iowa Supreme Court and Michigan Court of Appeals--thatthe DeBoers were not entitled to adopt the child because her biologicalfather's parental rights had not been terminated--control this proceeding's ultimate outcome. Iowa law, Michigan law, and federal law do notauthorize unrelated persons to retain custody of a child simply becausethey may be better able to provide for her future and education. Thereis no valid federal objection to the conduct or outcome of the Iowa courtproceedings. When the DeBoers sought to modify the Iowa SupremeCourt's decision in the Michigan courts, rather than seeking review ofthe decision, the Michigan Supreme Court correctly concluded thatMichigan courts are obligated to give effect to the Iowa proceedings.Justice Stevens, Circuit Justice.Applicants in No. A-65 are residents of WashtenawCounty, Michigan. On July 2, 1993, the Michigan SupremeCourt entered an order requiring them to comply with cus-tody orders that had previously been entered by the Michigan Court of Appeals and by the Iowa state courts whichhad directed them to deliver a child to its natural parents inIowa. They have filed an application with me in my capacity*Together with No. A-65, DeBoer v. Schmidt, also on application forstay.1301509US3IC4I 06-05-99 18:04:16 PAGES IC1301PGT1302 DEBOER v. DEBOEROpinion in Chambersas Circuit Justice for the Sixth Circuit for a stay of enforce-ment of that order. Applicant in No. A-64 is the child represented by her "next friend," who seeks the same relief.Because I am convinced that there is neither a reasonableprobability that the Court will grant certiorari nor a fairprospect that, if it did so, it would conclude that the decisionbelow is erroneous, I have decided to deny the applications.Respondents are the natural parents of Jessica Clausen,who was born in Iowa on February 8, 1991. When the childwas 17 days old, applicants filed a petition for adoption in theIowa courts. In the ensuing proceedings, the Iowa courtsdetermined that the parental rights of the child's biologicalfather had not been terminated in accordance with Iowa lawand that therefore applicants were not entitled to adopt thechild. For reasons that have been stated at length inopinions of the Iowa Supreme Court, the Michigan Court ofAppeals, and the Michigan Supreme Court, those determinations control the ultimate outcome of this proceeding.Applicants' claim that Jessica's best interests will be servedby allowing them to retain custody of her rests, in part, onthe relationship that they have been able to develop with thechild after it became clear that they were not entitled toadopt her. Neither Iowa law, nor Michigan law, nor federallaw authorizes unrelated persons to retain custody of a childwhose natural parents have not been found to be unfit simplybecause they may be better able to provide for her futureand her education. As the Iowa Supreme Court stated:"[C]ourts are not free to take children from parents simplyby deciding another home offers more advantages." In reB. G. C., 496 N. W. 2d 239, 241 (1992) (internal quotationmarks and citation omitted).My examination of the opinions in the litigation persuadesme that there is no valid federal objection to the conduct orthe outcome of the proceedings in the Iowa courts. Indeed,although applicants applied to Justice Blackmun in his capacity as Justice for the Eighth Circuit for a stay of enforce509US3IC4I 06-05-99 18:04:16 PAGES IC1301PGT1303Cite as: 509 U. S. 1301 (1993)Opinion in Chambersment of the judgment entered by the Iowa Supreme Courton September 23, 1992, they did not seek review of that judgment after he had denied the stay application. Rather thancomply with the Iowa judgment, applicants sought a modification of that judgment in the Michigan courts. In my opin-ion, the Michigan Supreme Court correctly concluded thatthe Michigan courts are obligated to give effect to the Iowaproceedings. The carefully crafted opinion of the MichiganSupreme Court contains a comprehensive and thoughtful ex-planation of the governing rules of law. Accordingly, thestay applications will be denied.
