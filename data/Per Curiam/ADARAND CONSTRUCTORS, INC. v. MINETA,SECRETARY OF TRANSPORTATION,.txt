We granted certiorari to review for a second time whetherthe Court of Appeals was correct when it concluded thatthe Department of Transportation's (DOT's) DisadvantagedBusiness Enterprise (DBE) program is consistent with theconstitutional guaranty of equal protection. But upon fullbriefing and oral argument we find that the current posture of this case prevents review of that important question.To address it would require a threshold inquiry into issuesdecided by the Court of Appeals but not presented in thepetition for certiorari. We therefore dismiss the writ of certiorari as improvidently granted.Six years ago in Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pen~ a, 515U. S. 200 (1995) (Adarand I), we held that strict scrutinygoverns whether race-based classifications violate the equalprotection component of the Fifth Amendment's Due ProcessClause. See id., at 235 ("Federal racial classifications, likethose of a State, must serve a compelling governmentalinterest, and must be narrowly tailored to further that in-terest"). We remanded for a determination whether therace-based components of the DOT's DBE program couldsurvive this standard of review.On remand, the District Court for the District of Coloradofound that no such race-based component then in operationcould so survive. Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pen~ a, 965F. Supp. 1556 (1997). The Court of Appeals vacated theDistrict Court's judgment, reasoning that petitioner's causeof action had been mooted because the Colorado Departmentof Transportation had recently certified petitioner as a DBE.Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Slater, 169 F. 3d 1292, 1296-1297 (CA10 1999). Finding it not at all clear that petition-er's certification was valid under DOT regulations, we againand Vincent A.

MINETAPer Curiamgranted certiorari, reversed the Court of Appeals, and re-manded for a determination on the merits consistent withAdarand I. Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Slater, 528 U. S.216 (2000)(per curiam).Following the submission of supplemental briefs address-ing statutory and regulatory changes that had occurred sincethe District Court's 1997 judgment favorable to petitioner,the Court of Appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part.228 F. 3d 1147 (CA10 2000). The Court of Appeals agreedwith the District Court that the DOT's DBE program wasunconstitutional as it was administered in 1997. It furtheragreed that the automatic use of financial incentives to encourage the award of subcontracts to DBEs, as originallycontemplated by the DOT's Subcontractor CompensationClause (SCC) program, was "unconstitutional under Adarand [I's] strict standard of scrutiny." Id., at 1187. TheSecretary of Transportation never challenged these rulingsand has since discontinued any and all use of the SCC program. Brief for Respondents 2, 10, 13, 20, n. 3, 23. See also228 F. 3d, at 1194 ("The government maintains, and Adaranddoes not dispute, that the SCC, which spawned this litigationin 1989, is no longer in use"); Tr. of Oral Arg. 25 ("[SCCs]ha[ve been] abandoned in all respects, [they] have not beenjustified, and the United States Government is not employing [them]").The Court of Appeals next turned its attention to newregulations issued by the Secretary of Transportation underthe Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), $ 1101(b)(1), 112 Stat. 113. See 49 CFR pt. 26 (1999).These regulations pertain almost exclusively to use of federal funds for highway projects let by States and localities,which the Court of Appeals found to be the only "relevant"aspect of the DBE program under review. 228 F. 3d, at1160. The Court of Appeals further noted that petitionereither lacked standing or had waived its right to challenge any other race-conscious program. Ibid. Finally, the534US1 Unit: $$U6 [04-10-03 15:09:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN107Cite as: 534 U. S. 103 (2001)Per CuriamCourt of Appeals held that, by virtue of the new regulatoryframework under which the DOT's state and local DBE program now operates, that program passed constitutional mus-ter under Adarand I. 228 F. 3d, at 1176-1187.We again granted certiorari to decide whether the Courtof Appeals misapplied the strict scrutiny standard announced in Adarand I. 532 U. S. 941 (2001). We antici-pated that we would be able to review the same "relevantprogram" that was addressed by the Court of Appeals.1But since certiorari was granted there has been a shift inthe posture of the case that precludes such review.Both parties agree that the Court of Appeals confined itsopinion to the constitutionality of the DOT's DBE pro-gram as it pertains to the use of federal funds for highwayprojects let by States and localities. See Brief for Peti-tioner 15-17; Brief for Respondents 19-23. It is clear fromits opinion that the Court of Appeals considered no otherprograms; its strict scrutiny analysis relies almost exclusively on regulations designed to channel benefits, throughStates and localities, to firms owned by individuals whohold themselves out to be socially and economically disad-vantaged. See 228 F. 3d, at 1176-1188. These regulationsclearly permit the award of contracts based on race-conscious measures in jurisdictions where petitioner operates, and, as the Government concedes, provide petitionerwith a potential basis for prospective relief, at least to theextent petitioner challenges them. Brief for Respondents 3.It appeared at the certiorari stage that petitioner was indeed challenging these statutes and regulations. Nothing1 We granted certiorari to review the following questions:"1. Whether the Court of Appeals misapplied the strict scrutiny standardin determining if Congress had a compelling interest to enact legislationdesigned to remedy the effects of racial discrimination?"2. Whether the United States Department of Transportation's currentDisadvantaged Business Enterprise program is narrowly tailored to servea compelling governmental interest?" 532 U. S. 968 (2001).534US1 Unit: $$U6 [04-10-03 15:09:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN108 ADARAND CONSTRUCTORS, INC. v. MINETAPer Curiamin the petition for certiorari contested the Court of Appeals'determination that petitioner lacked standing to challengethe statutes and regulations relating to any other race-conscious program. The petition for certiorari simply notedthe Court of Appeals' determination on this ground as amatter of fact, without further comment. Pet. for Cert. 4,nn. 2, 3.Petitioner now asserts, however, that it is not challeng-ing any part of DOT's state and local procurement program.Instead, it claims to be challenging only the statutes andregulations that pertain to DOT's direct procurement ofhighway construction on federal lands. Brief for Petitioner12-17. But the statutes and regulations relating to directprocurement are quite different from the statutes and regulations reviewed by the Court of Appeals. In particular,while procurement by States and localities is governed bythe regulations issued by the Secretary of Transportationunder TEA-21, direct federal procurement is governed bythe Small Business Act, including $$ 8(d)(4)-(6), as added by$ 211 of Pub. L. 95-507, 92 Stat. 1768, and as amended, 15U. S. C. $$ 637(d)(4)-(6) (1994 ed. and Supp. V), and the regulations promulgated thereunder, 48 CFR pt. 19 (1998).This shift in posture requires dismissal of the writ fortwo reasons. First, the Court of Appeals has not considered whether the various race-based programs applicableto direct federal contracting could satisfy strict scrutiny.See 228 F. 3d, at 1189, n. 35 ("There is no indication fromany of the parties in their briefs or elsewhere that the particular requirements of paragraphs (4)-(6) of $ 8(d) are at issuein the instant lawsuit") (citing 15 U. S. C. $$ 637(d)(4)-(6)(1994 ed. and Supp. IV)); see also 228 F. 3d, at 1188-1189,n. 32 ("The parties have not addressed paragraph (4) of $ 8(d)at all, and . . . we do not address it in great detail"). TheGovernment also has not addressed such programs in itsbrief on the merits. Brief for Respondents 38-50. Petitioner urges us to take on this task ourselves, and apply534US1 Unit: $$U6 [04-10-03 15:09:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN109Cite as: 534 U.

S., at 238-239, we saidthat application of our strict scrutiny standard "should beaddressed in the first instance by the lower courts." Weordinarily "do not decide in the first instance issues not decided below." National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v. Smith,525 U. S. 459, 470 (1999). See alsoGlover v. United States,531 U. S. 198, 205 (2001) ("In the ordinary course we do notdecide questions neither raised nor resolved below"); You-akim v. Miller, 425 U. S. 231 (1976) (per curiam) (same).Second, to reach the merits of any challenge to statutesand regulations relating to direct federal procurement wouldrequire a threshold examination of whether petitioner hasstanding to challenge such statutes and regulations. Petitioner has sought to show that it does have such standing,but this showing was not made (and no argument was everadvanced) until three weeks before oral argument. It wasmade then in a reply brief submitted with a lodging of voluminous evidence that has never been presented to any lowercourt. Reply Brief for Petitioner 1-9. The Governmenthas responded with a lodging of its own, contending that norace-conscious measures are used for direct procurement inany jurisdiction in which petitioner does business.2 What-ever the merits of these competing positions, the petition forcertiorari nowhere disputed the Court of Appeals' explicit2 The Government states that a "Benchmark Study" completed by theDepartment of Commerce, see 64 Fed. Reg. 52806 (1999); 63 Fed. Reg.35714 (1998), prohibits the use of race-conscious mechanisms for directfederal procurement of highway construction projects in any State otherthan Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, Kentucky, Tennessee,Texas, and Oklahoma, in none of which does petitioner conduct operations.Brief for Respondents 8-10, 22. At oral argument, the Governmentstated its view that the $$ 8(d)(4)-(6) programs in their current form wouldnot meet the constitutional requirement of "narrow tailoring" if used injurisdictions where the Benchmark Study has found no disparity suggesting discrimination or its continuing effects. Tr. of Oral Arg. 29-30.534US1 Unit: $$U6 [04-10-03 15:09:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN110 ADARAND CONSTRUCTORS, INC. v. MINETAPer Curiamholding that petitioner lacked standing to challenge the veryprovisions petitioner now asks us to review. 228 F. 3d, at1160 ("Nor are we presented with any indication that Adarand has standing to challenge paragraphs (4)-(6) of 15U. S. C. $ 637(d)").We are obliged to examine standing sua sponte wherestanding has erroneously been assumed below. See SteelCo. v. Citizens for Better Environment, 523 U.

Corrick, 298 U. S. 435, 440 (1936)). Butwe do not examine standing sua sponte simply to reach anissue for which standing has been denied below--exactlywhat petitioner asks that we do here. See, e. g., Izumi Seimitsu Kogyo Kabushiki Kaisha v. U. S. Philips Corp., 510U. S. 27, 31-32 (1993) (per curiam) (discussing this Court'sRule 14.1(a) and the "heavy presumption" against reachingthreshold questions not presented in the petition for certiorari (internal quotation marks and citations omitted))."Mindful that this is a court of final review and not firstview," Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co. v. Epstein, 516 U. S.367, 399 (1996) (Ginsburg, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), we thus decline to reach the merits of petitioner's present challenge. Petitioner points out that thiscase presents questions of fundamental national importancecalling for final resolution by this Court. But the importance of an issue should not distort the principles that control the exercise of our jurisdiction. To the contrary, "byadhering scrupulously to the customary limitations on ourdiscretion regardless of the significance of the underlyingissue, we promote respect . . . for the Court's adjudicatoryprocess."
