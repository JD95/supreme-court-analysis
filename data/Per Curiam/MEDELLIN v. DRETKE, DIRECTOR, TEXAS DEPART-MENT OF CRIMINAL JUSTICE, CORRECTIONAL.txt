DRETKEPer Curiamcourts must reconsider petitioner Jose' Medelli'n's claim forrelief under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations,Apr. 24, 1963, [1970] 21 U. S. T. 77, 100-101, T. I. A. S.No. 6820, without regard to procedural default doctrines; andsecond, whether a federal court should give effect, as amatter of judicial comity and uniform treaty interpretation,to the ICJ's judgment. 543 U. S. 1032 (2004). After wegranted certiorari, Medelli'n filed an application for a writ ofhabeas corpus in the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, relying in part upon a memorandum from President George W.Bush that was issued after we granted certiorari. Thisstate-court proceeding may provide Medelli'n with the veryreconsideration of his Vienna Convention claim that he nowseeks in the present proceeding. The merits briefing in thiscase also has revealed a number of hurdles Medelli'n mustsurmount before qualifying for federal habeas relief in thisproceeding, based on the resolution of the questions he haspresented here. For these reasons we dismiss the writ asimprovidently granted. See Ticor Title Ins. Co. v. Brown,511 U. S. 117, 121-122 (1994) (per curiam); The Monrosa v.Carbon Black Export, Inc., 359 U. S. 180, 183-184 (1959);Goins v. United States, 306 U. S. 622 (1939).Medelli'n, a Mexican national, confessed to participating inthe gang rape and murder of two girls in 1993. He was convicted and sentenced to death, and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed on direct appeal. Medelli'n then filed astate habeas corpus action, claiming for the first time thatTexas failed to notify him of his right to consular access asrequired by the Vienna Convention. The state trial courtrejected this claim, and the Texas Court of Criminal Appealssummarily affirmed.Medelli'n then filed this federal habeas corpus petition,again raising the Vienna Convention claim. The DistrictCourt denied the petition. Subsequently, while Medelli'n'sapplication to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit fora certificate of appealability was pending, see 28 U. S. C.544US2 Unit: $U50 [11-06-07 15:04:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN663Cite as: 544 U. S. 660 (2005)Per Curiam$ 2253(c), the ICJ issued its decision in Case ConcerningAvena and other Mexican Nationals (Mex. v. U. S.), 2004I. C. J. No. 128 (Judgment of Mar. 31), in which the Republicof Mexico had alleged violations of the Vienna Conventionwith respect to Medelli'n and other Mexican nationals facingthe death penalty in the United States. The ICJ determined that the Vienna Convention guaranteed individuallyenforceable rights, that the United States had violated thoserights, and that the United States must "provide, by meansof its own choosing, review and reconsideration of the convic-tions and sentences of the [affected] Mexican nationals" todetermine whether the violations "caused actual prejudice,"without allowing procedural default rules to bar such review.Id., |||| 121-122, 153(a).The Court of Appeals denied Medelli'n's application for acertificate of appealability. It did so based on Medelli'n'sprocedural default, see Breard v. Greene, 523 U. S. 371, 375(1998) (per curiam), and its prior holdings that the ViennaConvention did not create an individually enforceable right,see, e. g., United States v. Jimenez-Nava, 243 F. 3d 192, 195(CA5 2001). 371 F. 3d 270 (CA5 2004). While acknowledging the existence of the ICJ's Avena judgment, the courtgave no dispositive effect to that judgment.More than two months after we granted certiorari, and amonth before oral argument in this case, President Bush issued a memorandum that stated the United States woulddischarge its international obligations under the Avena judgment by "having State courts give effect to the [ICJ] decision in accordance with general principles of comity in casesfiled by the 51 Mexican nationals addressed in that decision."George W. Bush, Memorandum for the Attorney General(Feb. 28, 2005), App. 2 to Brief for United States as AmicusCuriae 9a. Relying on this memorandum and the Avenajudgment as separate bases for relief that were not availableat the time of his first state habeas corpus action, Medelli'nfiled a successive state application for a writ of habeas corpus544US2 Unit: $U50 [11-06-07 15:04:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN664 MEDELLIN v. DRETKEPer Curiamjust four days before oral argument here. That state pro-ceeding may provide Medelli'n with the review and reconsideration of his Vienna Convention claim that the ICJ re-quired, and that Medelli'n now seeks in this proceeding.This new development, as well as the factors discussedbelow, leads us to dismiss the writ of certiorari as improvidently granted.1There are several threshold issues that could independ-ently preclude federal habeas relief for Medelli'n, and thusrender advisory or academic our consideration of the ques-tions presented. These issues are not free from doubt.First, even accepting, arguendo, the ICJ's construction ofthe Vienna Convention's consular access provisions, a violation of those provisions may not be cognizable in a federalhabeas proceeding. InReed v. Farley, 512 U. S. 339 (1994),this Court recognized that a violation of federal statutoryrights ranked among the "nonconstitutional lapses we haveheld not cognizable in a postconviction proceeding" unlessthey meet the "fundamental defect" test announced in ourdecision in Hill v. United States, 368 U. S. 424, 428 (1962).512 U. S., at 349 (plurality opinion); see also id., at 355-356(Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).In order for Medelli'n to obtain federal habeas relief, Medelli'nmust therefore establish that Reed does not bar his treatyclaim.Second, with respect to any claim the state court "adjudicated on the merits," habeas relief in federal court is available only if such adjudication "was contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as1 Of course Medelli'n, or the State of Texas, can seek certiorari in thisCourt from the Texas courts' disposition of the state habeas corpus application. In that instance, this Court would in all likelihood have an opportunity to review the Texas courts' treatment of the President's memorandum and Case Concerning Avena and other Mexican Nationals (Mex. v.U. S.), 2004 I. C. J. No. 128 (Judgment of Mar. 31), unencumbered by theissues that arise from the procedural posture of this action.544US2 Unit: $U50 [11-06-07 15:04:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN665Cite as: 544 U. S. 660 (2005)Per Curiamdetermined by the Supreme Court." 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d)(1);seeWoodford v. Visciotti, 537 U. S. 19, 22-27 (2002) (per curiam). The state habeas court, which disposed of the casebefore the ICJ rendered its judgment inAvena, arguably"adjudicated on the merits" three claims. It found that theVienna Convention did not create individual, judicially enforceable rights and that state procedural default rulesbarred Medelli'n's consular access claim. Finally, and per-haps most importantly, the state trial court found that Medelli'n "fail[ed] to show that he was harmed by any lack ofnotification to the Mexican consulate concerning his arrestfor capital murder; [Medelli'n] was provided with effectivelegal representation upon [his] request; and [his] constitutional rights were safeguarded." App. to Pet. for Cert. 56a.2Medelli'n would have to overcome the deferential standardwith regard to all of these findings before obtaining federalhabeas relief on his Vienna Convention claim.3Third, a habeas corpus petitioner generally cannot enforcea "new rule" of law. Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989).2 The Federal District Court reviewing that finding observed:"Medelli'n's allegations of prejudice are speculative. The police officersinformed Medelli'n of his right to legal representation before he confessedto involvement in the murders. Medelli'n waived his right to advisementby an attorney. Medelli'n does not challenge the voluntary nature of hisconfession. There is no indication that, if informed of his consular rights,Medelli'n would not have waived those rights as he did his right to counsel.Medelli'n fails to establish a `causal connection between the [Vienna Convention] violation and [his] statements.' " App. to Pet. for Cert. 84a-85a(brackets in original).3 In Breard v. Greene, 523 U. S. 371 (1998) (per curiam), we addressedthe claim that Virginia failed to notify a Paraguayan national of his ViennaConvention right to consular access. In denying various writs, motions,and stay applications, we noted that the Vienna Convention "arguably confers on an individual the right to consular assistance following arrest";that Virginia's procedural default doctrine applied to the Vienna Convention claim; and that a successful Vienna Convention claimant likely mustdemonstrate prejudice. Id., at 375-377. At the time of our Breard decision, however, we confronted no final ICJ adjudication.544US2 Unit: $U50 [11-06-07 15:04:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN666 MEDELLIN v. DRETKEPer CuriamBefore relief could be granted, then, we would be obliged todecide whether or how the Avena judgment bears on ourordinary "new rule" jurisprudence.Fourth, Medelli'n requires a certificate of appealability inorder to pursue the merits of his claim on appeal. 28U. S. C. $ 2253(c)(1). A certificate of appealability may begranted only where there is "a substantial showing of thedenial of aconstitutional right." $ 2253(c)(2) (emphasisadded). To obtain the necessary certificate of appealabilityto proceed in the Court of Appeals, Medelli'n must demon-strate that his allegation of a treaty violation could satisfythis standard. See Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U. S. 473, 483(2000).Fifth, Medelli'n can seek federal habeas relief only onclaims that have been exhausted in state court. See 28U. S. C. $$ 2254(b)(1)(A), (b)(3). To gain relief based on thePresident's memorandum or ICJ judgments, Medelli'n wouldhave to show that he exhausted all available state-courtremedies.4In light of the possibility that the Texas courts will provide Medelli'n with the review he seeks pursuant to theAvena judgment and the President's memorandum, and thepotential for review in this Court once the Texas courts haveheard and decided Medelli'n's pending action, we think itwould be unwise to reach and resolve the multiple hin4 On March 8, 2005, Medelli'n filed a successive state habeas action basedon Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 11.071, $ 5(a)(1) (Vernon 2005), claiming that both the President's memorandum and the Avena judgment independently require the Texas court to grant review and reconsideration ofhis Vienna Convention claim. See Subsequent Application for PostConviction Writ of Habeas Corpus in Ex Parte Medelli'n, Trial Cause Nos.67,5429 and 67,5430 (Tex. Crim. App.), p. 6 (filed Mar. 24, 2005) ("First, thePresident's determination requires this Court to comply with the AvenaJudgment and remand Mr. Medelli'n's case for the mandated review andreconsideration of his Vienna Convention claim. Second, the Avena Judgment on its own terms provides the rule of decision in Mr. Medelli'n's caseand should be given direct effect by this Court").544US2 Unit: $U50 [11-06-07 15:04:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN667Cite as: 544 U.
