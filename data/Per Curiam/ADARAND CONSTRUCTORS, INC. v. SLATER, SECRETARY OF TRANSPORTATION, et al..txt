ICongress has adopted a policy that favors contracting withsmall businesses owned and controlled by the socially andeconomically disadvantaged. See $ 8(d)(1) of the Small Business Act, as added by $ 7 of Pub. L. 87-305, 75 Stat. 667, andas amended, 15 U. S. C. $ 637(d)(1) (1994 ed., Supp. IV). Toeffectuate that policy, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA), Pub. L. 102-240,$ 1003(b), 105 Stat. 1919, which is an appropriations measurefor the Department of Transportation (DOT), seeks to direct10 percent of the contracting funds expended on projectsfunded in whole or in part by the appropriated funds totransportation projects employing so-called disadvantagedbusiness enterprises.1 ISTEA $ 1003(b)(1).1 Congress recently enacted the Transportation Equity Act for the 21stCentury, Pub. L. 105-178, Tit. I, $ 1101(b), 112 Stat. 113, the successorappropriations measure to ISTEA. Although the new Act contains simi528US1 Unit: $U18 [06-15-01 20:47:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN218 ADARAND CONSTRUCTORS, INC. v. SLATERPer CuriamTo qualify for that status, the small business must be certified as owned and controlled by socially and economicallydisadvantaged individuals. DOT does not itself conduct certifications, but relies on certifications from two main sources:the Small Business Administration, which certifies businesses for all types of federal procurement programs, andstate highway agencies, which certify them for purposes offederally assisted highway projects. The federal regulations governing these certification programs, see 13 CFRpt. 124 (1999) (Small Business Administration); 64 Fed. Reg.5096-5148 (1999) (to be codified in 49 CFR pt. 26) (DOT forstate highway agencies), require that the certifying entitypresume to be socially disadvantaged persons who are black,Hispanic, Asian Pacific, Subcontinent Asian, Native Americans, or members of other groups designated from time totime by the Small Business Administration. See 13 CFR$ 124.103(b); 64 Fed. Reg. 5136 ($ 26.67). State highwayagencies must in addition presume that women are sociallydisadvantaged. Ibid. Small businesses owned and controlled by persons who are not members of the preferredgroups may also be certified, but only if they can demonstrate social disadvantage. See 13 CFR $ 124.103(c); 64 Fed.Reg. 5136-5137 ($ 26.67(d)); id., at 5147-5148 (pt. 26, subpt. D,App. E). Third parties, as well as DOT, may challenge findings of social disadvantage. See 13 CFR $ 124.1017(a); 64Fed. Reg. 5142 ($ 26.87).IIIn 1989, DOT awarded the prime contract for a federalhighway project in Colorado to Mountain Gravel & Construction Company. The contract included a Subcontractor Compensation Clause--which the Small Business Act requires alllar provisions, it is technically the provisions of ISTEA that apply to funding obligated in prior fiscal years but not yet expended.528US1 Unit: $U18 [06-15-01 20:47:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN219Cite as: 528 U. S. 216 (2000)Per Curiamfederal agencies to include in their prime contracts, see 15U. S. C. $ 637(d)--rewarding the prime contractor for subcontracting with disadvantaged business enterprises, see$ 637(d)(4)(E). Petitioner, whose principal is a white man,submitted the low bid on a portion of the project, but Mountain Gravel awarded the subcontract to a company thathad previously been certified by the Colorado Departmentof Transportation (CDOT) as a disadvantaged businessenterprise.Petitioner brought suit against various federal officials, alleging that the Subcontractor Compensation Clause, and inparticular the race-based presumption that forms its foundation, violated petitioner's Fifth Amendment right to equalprotection. The Tenth Circuit, applying the so-called intermediate scrutiny approved in some of our cases involvingclassifications on a basis other than race, see MississippiUniv. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U. S. 718 (1982); Craig v.Boren, 429 U. S. 190 (1976), upheld the use of the clause andthe presumption. Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pen~ a, 16F. 3d 1537 (1994). Because DOT's use of race-based measures should have been subjected to strict scrutiny, we reversed and remanded for the application of that standard.Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pen~ a, 515 U. S. 200, 237-239(1995) (Adarand I).On remand, the District Court for the District of Colorado held that the clause and the presumption failed strictscrutiny because they were not narrowly tailored. Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pen~ a, 965 F. Supp. 1556 (1997)(Adarand II). Specifically, the court held the presumptionthat members of the enumerated racial groups are sociallydisadvantaged to be both overinclusive and underinclusive,because it includes members of those groups who are notdisadvantaged and excludes members of other groups whoare. Id., at 1580. The District Court enjoined DOT from528US1 Unit: $U18 [06-15-01 20:47:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN220 ADARAND CONSTRUCTORS, INC. v. SLATERPer Curiamusing the clause and its presumption.2 Id., at 1584. Re-spondents appealed to the Tenth Circuit.Shortly thereafter, and while respondents' appeal was stillpending, petitioner filed a second suit in the District Court,this time naming as defendants certain Colorado officials,and challenging (on the same grounds) the State's use of thefederal guidelines in certifying disadvantaged business en-terprises for federally assisted projects.Adarand Con-structors, Inc. v. Romer, Civ. No. 97-K-1351 (June 26, 1997).Shortly after this suit was filed, however, Colorado alteredits certification program in response to the District Court'sdecision in Adarand II. Specifically, the State did awaywith the presumption of social disadvantage for certain minorities and women, App. to Pet. for Cert. 109-111, and inits place substituted a requirement that all applicants certifyon their own account that each of the firm's majority owners"has experienced social disadvantage based upon the effectsof racial, ethnic or gender discrimination," id., at 110. Colo-rado requires no further showing of social disadvantage byany applicant.A few days after Colorado amended its certification procedure, the District Court held a hearing on petitioner's motionfor a preliminary injunction inRomer. The District Courttook judicial notice of its holding in Adarand II that the Federal Government had discriminated against petitioner'sowner "by the application of unconstitutional rules and regulations." App. to Pet. for Cert. 136. As a result of thatrace-based discrimination, the District Court reasoned, petitioner likely was eligible for disadvantaged business statusunder Colorado's system for certifying businesses for federally assisted projects--the system at issue in Romer. App.to Pet. for Cert. 137. The District Court therefore denied2 Before the Tenth Circuit, the parties disagreed as to whether the scopeof the District Court's remedial order was appropriate. In characterizingthat order as we do here, we do not intend to take a position in thatdispute.528US1 Unit: $U18 [06-15-01 20:47:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN221Cite as: 528 U. S. 216 (2000)Per Curiampetitioner's request for a preliminary injunction. Id., at 138.Petitioner then requested and received disadvantaged business status from CDOT.Meanwhile, respondents' appeal from the District Court'sdecision in Adarand II was pending before the Tenth Cir-cuit. Upon learning that CDOT had given petitionerdisadvantaged business status, the Tenth Circuit held thatthe cause of action was moot, and vacated the DistrictCourt's judgment favorable to petitioner in Adarand II.169 F. 3d 1292, 1296-1297, 1299 (CA10 1999). Petitionerfiled a petition for certiorari.IIIIn dismissing the case as moot, the Tenth Circuit reliedon the language of the Subcontractor Compensation Clause,which provides that "[a] small business concern will be con-sidered a [disadvantaged business enterprise] after it hasbeen certified as such by . . . any State's Department ofHighways/Transportation." Id., at 1296. Because CDOThad certified petitioner as a disadvantaged business enter-prise, the court reasoned, the language of the clause indicated that the Federal Government also had accepted peti-tioner's certification for purposes of federal projects. As aresult, petitioner could no longer demonstrate " `an invasionof a legally protected interest' that is sufficiently `concreteand particularized' and `actual or imminent' " to establishstanding.Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520U. S. 43, 64 (1997) (quoting Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,504 U. S. 555, 560 (1992)). Because, the court continued,petitioner could not demonstrate such an invasion, its causeof action was moot. 169 F. 3d, at 1296-1297.In so holding, the Tenth Circuit "confused mootness withstanding," Friends of Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw EnvironmentalServices (TOC), Inc., ante, at 189, and as a result placed theburden of proof on the wrong party. If this case is moot,it is because the Federal Government has accepted CDOT's528US1 Unit: $U18 [06-15-01 20:47:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN222 ADARAND CONSTRUCTORS, INC. v. SLATERPer Curiamcertification of petitioner as a disadvantaged business enter-prise, and has thereby ceased its offending conduct. Voluntary cessation of challenged conduct moots a case, however,only if it is "absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur." UnitedStates v. Concentrated Phosphate Export Assn., Inc., 393U. S. 199, 203 (1968) (emphasis added). And the " `heavyburden of persua[ding]' the court that the challenged conductcannot reasonably be expected to start up againlies with theparty asserting mootness." Friends of Earth, ante, at 189(emphasis added) (quotingConcentrated Phosphate ExportAssn., supra, at 203).Because respondents cannot satisfy this burden, the TenthCircuit's error was a crucial one. As common sense wouldsuggest, and as the Tenth Circuit itself recognized, DOT accepts only "valid certification[s]" from state agencies. 169F. 3d, at 1298. As respondents concede, however, see Briefin Opposition 13-14, n. 6, DOT has yet to approve--as itmust--CDOT's procedure for certifying disadvantaged business enterprises, see 64 Fed. Reg. 5129 (1999) (49 CFR$ 26.21(b)(1)) ("[The State] must submit a [disadvantagedbusiness enterprise] program conforming to this part by August 31, 1999 to the concerned operating administration").DOT has promulgated regulations outlining the procedurestate highway agencies must follow in certifying firms as disadvantaged business enterprises. See 64 Fed. Reg. 5096-5148 (pt. 26). As described earlier, those regulationsrequire the agency to presume that "women, Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, Asian-PacificAmericans, Subcontinent Asian Americans, or other minorities found to be disadvantaged by the [Small Business Administration]" are socially disadvantaged. Id., at 5136($ 26.67(a)(1)). Before individuals not members of thosegroups may be certified, the state agency must make individual determinations as to disadvantage. See id., at 5136-5137 ($ 26.67(d)) ("In such a proceeding, the applicant firm528US1 Unit: $U18 [06-15-01 20:47:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN223Cite as: 528 U. S. 216 (2000)Per Curiamhas the burden of demonstrating to [the state highwayagency], by a preponderance of the evidence, that the individuals who own and control it are socially and economicallydisadvantaged");id., at 5147-5148 (pt. 26, subpt. D, App. E)(providing list of "elements" that highway agencies mustconsider in making individualized determinations of socialdisadvantage). CDOT's new procedure under which petitioner was certified applies no presumption in favor of minor-ity groups, and accepts without investigation a firm's selfcertification of entitlement to disadvantaged business status.See App. to Pet. for Cert. 109-111. Given the material differences (not to say incompatibility) between that procedureand the requirements of the DOT regulations, it is not at allclear that CDOT's certification is a "valid certification," andhence not at all clear that the Subcontractor CompensationClause requires its acceptance.Before the Tenth Circuit, respondents took pains to "expres[s] no opinion regarding the correctness of Colorado's determination that [petitioner] is entitled to [disadvantagedbusiness] status." Motion by the Federal Appellants toDismiss Appeal as Moot and to Vacate the District CourtJudgment in No. 97-1304, p. 3, n. 2. Instead, they statedflatly that "in the event there is a third-party challenge to[petitioner's] certification as a [disadvantaged business enterprise] and the decision on the challenge is appealed toDOT, DOT may review the decision to determine whetherthe certification was proper." Id., at 3-4, n. 2. In addition,DOT itself has the power to require States to initiate proceedings to withdraw a firm's disadvantaged status if thereis "reasonable cause to believe" that the firm "does not meetthe eligibility criteria" set forth in the federal regulations.64 Fed. Reg. 5142 ($ 26.87(c)(1)). Given the patent incompatibility of the certification with the federal regulations, it isfar from clear that these possibilities will not become reality.Indeed, challenges to petitioner's disadvantaged businessstatus seem quite probable now that the Tenth Circuit, by528US1 Unit: $U18 [06-15-01 20:47:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN224 ADARAND CONSTRUCTORS, INC. v. SLATERPer Curiamvacating Adarand II, has eliminated the sole basis for peti-tioner's certification in the first place.The Tenth Circuit dismissed these possibilities as insuffi-ciently particular and concrete to grant standing and therefore "too conjectural and speculative to avoid a finding ofmootness." 169 F. 3d, at 1298 (internal quotation marksomitted). As we recently noted in Friends of the Earth,however, "[t]he plain lesson of [our precedents] is that thereare circumstances in which the prospect that a defendantwill engage in (or resume) harmful conduct may be too speculative to support standing, but not too speculative to over-come mootness."Ante, at 190. Because, under the cir-cumstances of this case, it is impossible to conclude thatrespondents have borne their burden of establishing that itis "absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behaviorcould not reasonably be expected to recur," ante, at 189, peti-tioner's cause of action remains alive.* * *It is no small matter to deprive a litigant of the rewardsof its efforts, particularly in a case that has been litigated upto this Court and back down again. Such action on groundsof mootness would be justified only if it were absolutely clearthat the litigant no longer had any need of the judicial protec-tion that it sought. Because that is not the case here, thepetition for writ of certiorari is granted, the judgment ofthe United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit isreversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedingsconsistent with this opinion.
