Petitioner was convicted of murder, armed robbery, andaggravated assault by a jury in Taylor County, Georgia, andsentenced to death. At trial, over petitioner's objection, thecourt excused for cause five jurors who expressed reservations about the death penalty. The Supreme Court of Geor-gia affirmed, citing Wainwright v. Witt, 469 U. S. 412 (1985),as "controlling authority" for a rule that appellate courtsmust defer to trial courts' findings concerning juror bias.266 Ga. 439, 440-442, 469 S. E. 2d 129, 134-135 (1996).Wainwright v. Witt, supra, delineated the standard underthe Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments for determiningwhen a juror may be excused for cause because of his viewson the death penalty: whether these views would " `preventor substantially impair the performance of his duties as ajuror in accordance with his instructions and his oath.'

GEORGIAPer Curiamlenge to the juror disqualifications in this case, the SupremeCourt of Georgia correctly recognized that Witt is "the controlling authority as to the death-penalty qualification of pro-spective jurors . . . ." 266 Ga., at 440, 469 S. E. 2d, at 134.*Witt also held that, under 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d), federalcourts must accord a presumption of correctness to statecourts' findings of juror bias. 469 U. S., at 426-430. TheSupreme Court of Georgia said thatWitt was also "control-ling authority" on this point, and it therefore ruled that"[t]he conclusion that a prospective juror is disqualified forbias is one that is based upon findings of demeanor and credibility which are peculiarly within the trial court's provinceand such findings are to be given deference by appellatecourts. Wainwright v. Witt, [469 U. S.,] at 428." 266 Ga.,at 441, 469 S. E. 2d, at 134-135.Witt is not "controlling authority" as to the standard ofreview to be applied by state appellate courts reviewing trialcourts' rulings on jury selection. Witt was a case arisingon federal habeas, where deference to state-court findings ismandated by 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d). But this statute does notgovern the standard of review of trial court findings by theSupreme Court of Georgia. There is no indication in thatcourt's opinion that it viewed Witt as merely persuasiveauthority, or that the court intended to borrow or adoptthe Witt standard of review for its own purposes. It believed itself bound by Witt's standard of review of trialcourt findings on jury-selection questions, and in so doing itwas mistaken.In a similar case involving a state court's mistaken viewthat the First Amendment required it to reach a particularresult, we said: "We conclude that although the State of Ohiomay as a matter of its own law privilege the press in thecircumstances of this case, the First and Fourteenth Amendments do not require it to do so." Zacchini v. Scripps*We express no opinion as to the correctness of the Supreme Court ofGeorgia's application of the Witt standard in this case.519US1$11h 06-02-99 16:50:28 PAGES OPINPGT147Cite as: 519 U.

The motion forleave to proceed in forma pauperis and the petition for awrit of certiorari are therefore granted, the judgment of theSupreme Court of Georgia is reversed, and the case is re-manded for further proceedings not inconsistent with thisopinion.
