IRespondent Sally Marie McNeil killed her husband afteran argument over his infidelity and spending habits. TheState of California charged her with murder. Respondent'stheory at trial was that her husband had tried to strangleher during the argument, but that she had escaped, fetcheda shotgun from the bedroom, and killed him out of fear forher life. Fingernail marks were indeed found on her neckafter the shooting. She testified that her husband had beenabusive, and a defense expert opined that she suffered fromBattered Women's Syndrome. The State countered with forensic evidence showing that the fingernail marks were nother husband's and may have been self-inflicted, and with thetestimony of a 911 operator who overheard respondent tellher husband she had shot him because she would no longertolerate his behavior.Under California law, "[m]urder is the unlawful killing ofa human being . . . with malice aforethought." Cal. PenalCode Ann. $ 187(a) (West 1999). The element of malice isnegated if one kills out of fear of imminent peril. In reChristian S., 7 Cal. 4th 768, 773, 872 P. 2d 574, 576 (1994).Where that fear is unreasonable (but nevertheless genuine),it reduces the crime from murder to voluntary manslaughter--a doctrine known as "imperfect self-defense." Ibid.At respondent's trial, the judge instructed the jury on theseconcepts as follows:" `The specific intent for voluntary manslaughter, asopposed to murder, must arise upon one of [the] following circumstances:. . . . ." `[A]n honest but unreasonable belief in the necessityto defend oneself against imminent peril to life or greatbodily injury. That would be imperfect self-defense.. . . . .541US2 Unit: $U45 [05-08-06 20:38:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN435Cite as: 541 U. S. 433 (2004)Per Curiam" `To establish that a killing is murder [and] not manslaughter, the burden is on the People to prove beyonda reasonable doubt each of the elements of murder andthat the act which caused the death was not done . . .in the honest, even though unreasonable, belief in thenecessity to defend against imminent peril to life or togreat bodily injury.. . . . ." `A person, who kills another person in the actual butunreasonable belief in the necessity to defend againstimminent peril to life or great bodily injury, kills unlawfully, but is not guilty of murder. This would be so eventhough a reasonable person in the same situation, seeingand knowing the same facts, would not have had thesame belief. Such an actual but unreasonable belief isnot a defense to the crime of voluntary manslaughter." `An "imminent" peril is one that is apparent, present,immediate and must be instantly dealt with, or must soappear at the time to the slayer as a reasonable person.' " App. to Pet. for Cert. 31-33.The last four words of this instruction--" `as a reasonableperson' "--are not part of the relevant form instruction,1 California Jury Instructions, Criminal, No. 5.17 (6th ed.1996), and were apparently included in error. The prosecutor's closing argument, however, correctly stated the law.Respondent was convicted of second-degree murder andappealed on the basis of the erroneous jury instruction. TheCalifornia Court of Appeal acknowledged the error but upheld her conviction, reasoning:"[R]eversal is not required because `[e]rror cannot bepredicated upon an isolated phrase, sentence or excerptfrom the instructions since the correctness of an instruction is to be determined in its relation to the other instructions and in light of the instructions as a whole.'541US2 Unit: $U45 [05-08-06 20:38:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN436 MIDDLETON v. McNEILPer CuriamHere, when all of the jury instructions on voluntarymanslaughter and imperfect self-defense, are consideredin their entirety, it is not reasonably likely that the jurywould have misunderstood the requirements of the imperfect self-defense component of voluntary manslaugh-ter. On the contrary, these instructions repeatedly informed the jury that if the defendant had an honest (oractual) but unreasonable belief in the need to act inself-defense, then the offense would be manslaughterand the defendant could not be convicted of murder.Furthermore, in arguing to the jury, the prosecutor setforth the appropriate standard, stating `[i]f you believeit is an imperfect self-defense, that she actually believedbut that a reasonable person would not believe in thenecessity for self-defense, that lessens the crime to whatis called, "voluntary manslaughter."

S. 433 (2004)Per CuriamIn a criminal trial, the State must prove every element ofthe offense, and a jury instruction violates due process if itfails to give effect to that requirement. See Sandstrom v.Montana, 442 U. S. 510, 520-521 (1979). Nonetheless, notevery ambiguity, inconsistency, or deficiency in a jury instruction rises to the level of a due process violation. Thequestion is " `whether the ailing instruction . . . so infectedthe entire trial that the resulting conviction violates dueprocess.' " Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U. S. 62, 72 (1991) (quoting Cupp v. Naughten, 414 U. S. 141, 147 (1973)). " `[A] single instruction to a jury may not be judged in artificial isolation, but must be viewed in the context of the overallcharge.' " Boyde v. California, 494 U. S. 370, 378 (1990)(quoting Cupp, supra, at 146-147). If the charge as a wholeis ambiguous, the question is whether there is a " `reasonablelikelihood that the jury has applied the challenged instruction in a way' that violates the Constitution." Estelle,supra, at 72 (quoting Boyde, supra, at 380).The Ninth Circuit held that the erroneous imminent-perilinstruction "eliminated" respondent's imperfect self-defenseclaim, and that the state court unreasonably applied federallaw by "completely ignor[ing] unchallenged and uncorrectedinstructions to the jury." 344 F. 3d, at 999. It acknowledged that it was bound to consider the jury charge as awhole, but held that the other instructions were irrelevantbecause "[t]he only time that the trial judge actually definedimminent peril for the jury was in the erroneous instructionon imperfect self-defense." Id., at 997.This conclusion failed to give appropriate deference to thestate court's decision. Contrary to the Ninth Circuit's description, the state court did not "ignor[e]" the faulty instruction. It merely held that the instruction was not reasonably likely to have misled the jury given the multipleother instances (at least three, see supra, at 434-435) wherethe charge correctly stated that respondent's belief could be541US2 Unit: $U45 [05-08-06 20:38:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN438 MIDDLETON v. McNEILPer Curiamunreasonable. App. to Pet. for Cert. 34. Given three correct instructions and one contrary one, the state court didnot unreasonably apply federal law when it found that therewas no reasonable likelihood the jury was misled.The Ninth Circuit thought that the other references to unreasonableness were irrelevant because they were not partof the definition of "imminent peril." That alone does notmake them irrelevant; whether one defines imminent peril interms of an unreasonable belief or instead describes imperfect self-defense as allowing an unreasonable belief in imminent peril, the import of the instruction is the same. Perhaps the Ninth Circuit reasoned that the erroneous definitionof "imminent peril" caused the jury to believe that the earlier, correct instructions ("actual but unreasonable belief inthe necessity to defend against imminent peril") meant that,although the belief in the necessity to defend may be unreasonable, the belief in the existence of the "imminent peril"may not. This interpretation would require such a rarecombination of extremely refined lawyerly parsing of an instruction, and extremely gullible acceptance of a result thatmakes no conceivable sense, that the state court's implicitrejection of the possibility was surely not an unreasonableapplication of federal law.The Ninth Circuit also faulted the state court for relyingon the prosecutor's argument, noting that instructions froma judge are presumed to have more influence than argumentsof counsel. 344 F. 3d, at 999 (citing Boyde, supra, at 384).But this is not a case where the jury charge clearly says onething and the prosecutor says the opposite; the instructionswere at worst ambiguous because they were internally inconsistent. Nothing in Boyde precludes a state court fromassuming that counsel's arguments clarified an ambiguousjury charge. This assumption is particularly apt when it isthe prosecutor's argument that resolves an ambiguity infavor of the defendant.541US2 Unit: $U45 [05-08-06 20:38:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN439Cite as: 541 U.

HOODcertiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe sixth circuitNo. 02-1606. Argued March 1, 2004--Decided May 17, 2004Respondent Hood had an outstanding balance on student loans guaranteedby petitioner Tennessee Student Assistance Corporation (TSAC), astate entity, at the time she filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition.Hood's general discharge did not cover her student loans, as she did notlist them and they are only dischargeable if a bankruptcy court determines that excepting the debt from the order would be an "undue hardship" on the debtor, 11 U. S. C. $ 523(a)(8). Hood subsequently reopenedthe petition, seeking an "undue hardship" determination. As prescribed by Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure 7001(6), 7003, and7004, she filed a complaint and, later, an amended complaint, and servedthem with a summons on TSAC and others. The Bankruptcy Courtdenied TSAC's motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction,holding that 11 U. S. C. $ 106(a) abrogated the State's Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity. The Sixth Circuit Bankruptcy AppellatePanel affirmed, as did the Sixth Circuit, which held that the BankruptcyClause gave Congress the authority to abrogate state sovereign immunity in $ 106(a). This Court granted certiorari to determine whetherthe Bankruptcy Clause grants Congress such authority.Held: Because the Bankruptcy Court's discharge of a student loan debtdoes not implicate a State's Eleventh Amendment immunity, thisCourt does not reach the question on which certiorari was granted.Pp. 446-455.(a) States may be bound by some judicial actions without their consent. For example, the Eleventh Amendment does not bar federal jurisdiction over in rem admiralty actions when the State does not possessthe res. California v. Deep Sea Research, Inc., 523 U. S. 491, 507-508.A debt's discharge by a bankruptcy court is similarly an in rem proceeding. The court has exclusive jurisdiction over a debtor's property,wherever located, and over the estate. Once debts are discharged, acreditor who did not submit a proof of claim will be unable to collect onhis unsecured loans. A bankruptcy court is able to provide the debtora fresh start, even if all of his creditors do not participate, because thecourt's jurisdiction is premised on the debtor and his estate, not on thecreditors. Because the court's jurisdiction is premised on the res, however, a nonparticipating creditor cannot be personally liable. States,541US2 Unit: $U46 [05-20-06 18:28:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN441Cite as: 541 U. S. 440 (2004)Syllabuswhether or not they choose to participate in the proceeding, are boundby a bankruptcy court's discharge order no less than other creditors,see, e. g., New York v. Irving Trust Co., 288 U. S. 329, 333. And whenthe bankruptcy court's jurisdiction over the res is unquestioned, theexercise of its in rem jurisdiction to discharge the debt does not infringea State's sovereignty. TSAC argues, however, that the individualizedprocess by which student loan debts are discharged unconstitutionallyinfringes its sovereignty. If a debtor does not affirmatively secure$ 523(a)(8)'s "undue hardship" determination, States choosing not to submit themselves to the court's jurisdiction might receive some benefit:The debtor's personal liability on the loan may survive the discharge.TSAC misunderstands the proceeding's fundamental nature when itclaims that Congress, by making a student loan debt presumptively nondischargeable and singling it out for an individualized determination,has authorized a suit against a State. The bankruptcy court's jurisdiction is premised on the res, not the persona; that States were grantedthe presumptive benefit of nondischargeability does not alter the court'sunderlying authority. A debtor does not seek damages or affirmativerelief from a State or subject an unwilling State to a coercive judicialprocess by seeking to discharge his debts. Indeed, this Court has endorsed individual determinations of States' interests within the federalcourts' in rem jurisdiction, e. g., Deep Sea Research, supra. Althoughbankruptcy and admiralty are specialized areas of the law, there is noreason why the exercise of federal courts' in rem bankruptcy jurisdiction is more threatening to state sovereignty than the exercise of theirin rem admiralty jurisdiction. Pp. 446-451.(b) With regard to the procedure used in this case, the BankruptcyRules require a debtor to file an adversary proceeding against the Stateto discharge student loan debts. While this is part of the original bankruptcy case and within the bankruptcy court's in rem jurisdiction, itrequires the service of a summons and a complaint, see Rules 7001(6),7003, and 7004. The issuance of process is normally an indignity to aState's sovereignty, because its purpose is to establish personal jurisdiction; but the court's in rem jurisdiction allows it to adjudicate the debtors' discharge claim without in personam jurisdiction over the State.Section 523(a)(8) does not require a summons, and absent Rule 7001(6)a debtor could proceed by motion, which would raise no constitutionalconcern. There is no reason why service of a summons, which in thiscase is indistinguishable in practical effect from a motion, should begiven dispositive weight. Dismissal of the complaint is not appropriatehere where the court has in rem jurisdiction and has not attempted toadjudicate any claims outside of that jurisdiction. This case is unlikean adversary proceeding by a bankruptcy trustee seeking to recover541US2 Unit: $U46 [05-20-06 18:28:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN442 TENNESSEE STUDENT ASSISTANCE CORPORATIONv. HOODSyllabusproperty in the State's hands on the grounds that the transfer was avoidable preference. Even if this Court were to hold that Congresslacked the ability to abrogate state sovereign immunity under the Bankruptcy Clause, the Bankruptcy Court would still have authority to makethe undue hardship determination Hood seeks. Thus, this Court declines to decide whether a bankruptcy court's exercise of personal jurisdiction over a State would be valid under the Eleventh Amendment.If the Bankruptcy Court on remand exceeds its in rem jurisdiction,TSAC would be free to challenge the court's authority.

That court affirmed, holdingthat the States ceded their immunity from private suits inbankruptcy in the Constitutional Convention, and therefore,the Bankruptcy Clause, U. S. Const., Art.

Because we hold that abankruptcy court's discharge of a student loan debt does notimplicate a State's Eleventh Amendment immunity, we donot reach the broader question addressed by the Court ofAppeals.2 Hood does not dispute that TSAC is considered a "State" for purposesof the Eleventh Amendment.3 Hood does not argue in this Court that TSAC waived its sovereignimmunity, and we pass no judgment on the question.541US2 Unit: $U46 [05-20-06 18:28:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN446 TENNESSEE STUDENT ASSISTANCE CORPORATIONv. HOODOpinion of the CourtIIBy its terms, the Eleventh Amendment precludes suits "inlaw or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of theUnited States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens orSubjects of any Foreign State." For over a century, however, we have recognized that the States' sovereign immu-nity is not limited to the literal terms of the EleventhAmendment. See Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1 (1890).Although the text of the Amendment refers only to suitsagainst a State by citizens of another State, we have repeat-edly held that an unconsenting State also is immune fromsuits by its own citizens. See, e. g., id., at 15; Duhne v. NewJersey, 251 U. S. 311, 313 (1920); Great Northern Life Ins.Co. v. Read, 322 U. S. 47, 51 (1944); Employees of Dept. ofPublic Health and Welfare of Mo. v. Department of PublicHealth and Welfare of Mo., 411 U. S. 279, 280 (1973); Edel-man v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651, 662-663 (1974); Seminole Tribeof Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44, 55 (1996).States, nonetheless, may still be bound by some judicialactions without their consent. In California v. Deep SeaResearch, Inc., 523 U. S. 491 (1998), we held that the Eleventh Amendment does not bar federal jurisdiction over inrem admiralty actions when the State is not in possession ofthe property. In that case, a private corporation located ahistoric shipwreck, the S. S.Brother Jonathan, in Califor-nia's territorial waters. The corporation filed an in rem action in federal court seeking rights to the wreck and itscargo. The State of California intervened, arguing that itpossessed title to the wreck and that its sovereign immunityprecluded the court from adjudicating its rights. While acknowledging that the Eleventh Amendment might constrainfederal courts' admiralty jurisdiction in some instances, id.,at 503 (citing Ex parte New York, 256 U.

S., at 507-508 (citinge. g., The Davis, 10 Wall. 15 (1870); The Pesaro, 255 U. S.216 (1921)).The discharge of a debt by a bankruptcy court is similarlyanin rem proceeding. See Gardner v. New Jersey, 329 U. S.565, 574 (1947); Straton v. New, 283 U. S. 318, 320-321 (1931);Hanover Nat. Bank v. Moyses, 186 U. S. 181, 192 (1902); NewLamp Chimney Co. v. Ansonia Brass & Copper Co., 91 U. S.656, 662 (1876). Bankruptcy courts have exclusive jurisdic-tion over a debtor's property, wherever located, and overthe estate. See 28 U. S. C. $ 1334(e). In a typical voluntarybankruptcy proceeding under Chapter 7, the debtor files apetition for bankruptcy in which he lists his debts or hiscreditors, Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 1007(a)(1); the petitionconstitutes an order for relief, 11 U. S. C. $ 301. The courtclerk notifies the debtor's creditors of the order for relief,see Rule 2002(l), and if a creditor wishes to participate inthe debtor's assets, he files a proof of claim, Rule 3002(a); see11 U. S. C. $ 726. If a creditor chooses not to submit a proofof claim, once the debts are discharged, the creditor will beunable to collect on his unsecured loans. Rule 3002(a); see11 U. S. C. $ 726. The discharge order releases a debtorfrom personal liability with respect to any discharged debtby voiding any past or future judgments on the debt and byoperating as an injunction to prohibit creditors from attempting to collect or to recover the debt. $$ 524(a)(1), (2);3 W. Norton, Bankruptcy Law and Practice 2d $ 48:1, p. 48-3(1998) (hereinafter Norton).A bankruptcy court is able to provide the debtor a freshstart in this manner, despite the lack of participation of allof his creditors, because the court's jurisdiction is premisedon the debtor and his estate, and not on the creditors.

A bankruptcy court's in remjurisdiction permits it to "determin[e] all claims that any-one, whether named in the action or not, has to the property or thing in question. The proceeding is `one againstthe world.' " 16 J. Moore et al., Moore's Federal Practice$ 108.70[1], p. 108-106 (3d ed. 2004). Because the court's ju-risdiction is premised on the res, however, a nonparticipatingcreditor cannot be subjected to personal liability. See Freeman v. Alderson, 119 U. S. 185, 188-189 (1886) (citing Cooperv. Reynolds, 10 Wall. 308 (1870)).Under our longstanding precedent, States, whether or notthey choose to participate in the proceeding, are bound by abankruptcy court's discharge order no less than other credi-tors. In New York v. Irving Trust Co., 288 U. S. 329 (1933),we sustained an order of the Bankruptcy Court which barredthe State of New York's tax claim because it was not filedwithin the time fixed for the filing of claims. We held that"[i]f a state desires to participate in the assets of a bankrupt,she must submit to the appropriate requirements." Id., at333; see alsoGardner, supra, at 574 (holding that a Statewaives its sovereign immunity by filing a proof of claim).And in Van Huffel v. Harkelrode, 284 U. S. 225, 228-229(1931), we held that the Bankruptcy Court had the authorityto sell a debtor's property "free and clear" of a State's taxlien. At least when the bankruptcy court's jurisdiction overthe res is unquestioned, cf. United States v. Nordic Village,Inc., 503 U. S. 30 (1992), our cases indicate that the exerciseof its in rem jurisdiction to discharge a debt does not infringestate sovereignty.4 Cf. Hoffman v. Connecticut Dept. of In4 Missouri v. Fiske, 290 U. S. 18 (1933), is not to the contrary. In thatcase, private individuals sought to enjoin the State of Missouri from prosecuting probate proceedings in state court, contending that the FederalDistrict Court had made a final determination of the ownership of the541US2 Unit: $U46 [05-20-06 18:28:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN449Cite as: 541 U.

S. 96, 102 (1989) (plurality opinion) (applying Eleventh Amendment analysis where a Bankruptcy Court sought to issue a money judgment against anonconsenting State).TSAC concedes that States are generally bound by a bankruptcy court's discharge order, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 17, butargues that the particular process by which student loandebts are discharged unconstitutionally infringes its sovereignty. Student loans used to be presumptively dischargedin a general discharge. But in 1976, Congress provided asignificant benefit to the States by making it more difficultfor debtors to discharge student loan debts guaranteed byStates. Education Amendments of 1976, $ 439A(a), 90 Stat.2141 (codified at 20 U. S. C. $ 1087-3 (1976 ed.), repealed byPub. L. 95-598, $ 317, 92 Stat. 2678). That benefit is currently governed by 11 U. S. C. $ 523(a)(8), which providesthat student loan debts guaranteed by governmental unitsare not included in a general discharge order unless excepting the debt from the order would impose an "undue hardship" on the debtor. See also $ 727(b) (providing that adischarge under $ 727(a) discharges the debtor from all prepetition debts except as listed in $ 523(a)).contested stock. We held the Eleventh Amendment prevented federalcourts from entertaining such a suit because a "[federal] court has noauthority to issue process against the State to compel it to subject itselfto the court's judgment." Id., at 28. Although a discharge order underthe Bankruptcy Code "operates as an injunction" against creditors whocommence or continue an action against a debtor in personam to recoveror to collect a discharged debt, 11 U. S. C. $ 524(a)(2), the enforcement ofsuch an injunction against the State by a federal court is not before us.To the extent that Fiske is relevant in the present context, it supports ourconclusion that a discharge order is binding on the State. There, wenoted the State might still be bound by the federal court's adjudicationeven if an injunction could not issue. 290 U. S., at 29. It is unlikely thatthe Court sub silentio overruled the holdings in Irving Trust and VanHuffel in Fiske as Justice Thomas implies, see post, at 463 (dissentingopinion), as Fiske was decided the same year as Irving Trust.541US2 Unit: $U46 [05-20-06 18:28:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN450 TENNESSEE STUDENT ASSISTANCE CORPORATIONv. HOODOpinion of the CourtSection 523(a)(8) is "self-executing." Norton $ 47:52, at47-137 to 47-138; see also S. Rep. No. 95-989, p. 79 (1978).Unless the debtor affirmatively secures a hardship determi-nation, the discharge order will not include a student loandebt. Norton $ 47:52, at 47-137 to 47-138. Thus, the majordifference between the discharge of a student loan debt andthe discharge of most other debts is that governmental creditors, including States, that choose not to submit themselvesto the court's jurisdiction might still receive some benefit:The debtor's personal liability on the loan may survive thedischarge.It is this change that TSAC contends infringes state sovereignty. Tr. of Oral Arg. 15-16. By making a student loandebt presumptively nondischargeable and singling it out foran "individualized adjudication," id., at 17, TSAC argues thatCongress has authorized a suit against a State. But TSACmisunderstands the fundamental nature of the proceeding.No matter how difficult Congress has decided to make thedischarge of student loan debt, the bankruptcy court's jurisdiction is premised on the res, not on the persona; that Stateswere granted the presumptive benefit of nondischargeabilitydoes not alter the court's underlying authority. A debtordoes not seek monetary damages or any affirmative relieffrom a State by seeking to discharge a debt; nor does hesubject an unwilling State to a coercive judicial process. Heseeks only a discharge of his debts.Indeed, we have previously endorsed individualized determinations of States' interests within the federal courts' inrem jurisdiction. In Van Huffel, we affirmed the bankruptcy courts' power to sell property free from encumbrances, including States' liens, and approvingly noted thatsome courts had chosen specifically to discharge States' liensfor taxes. 284 U. S., at 228; cf. Gardner, 329 U. S., at 572-574 (noting "that the reorganization court had jurisdictionover the proof and allowance of the tax claims and that theexercise of that power was not a suit against the State").541US2 Unit: $U46 [05-20-06 18:28:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN451Cite as: 541 U. S. 440 (2004)Opinion of the CourtOur decision in California v. Deep Sea Research, Inc., 523U. S. 491 (1998), also involved an individualized in rem adjudication in which a State claimed an interest, as have otherin rem admiralty cases involving sovereigns, e. g., The Davis,10 Wall., at 19; The Siren, 7 Wall. 152, 159 (1869); The Pesaro,255 U. S., at 219. Although both bankruptcy and admiraltyare specialized areas of the law, we see no reason why theexercise of the federal courts'in rem bankruptcy jurisdictionis more threatening to state sovereignty than the exercise oftheir in rem admiralty jurisdiction.We find no authority, in fine, that suggests a bankruptcycourt's exercise of its in rem jurisdiction to discharge a stu-dent loan debt would infringe state sovereignty in the manner suggested by TSAC. We thus hold that the undue hard-ship determination sought by Hood in this case is not a suitagainst a State for purposes of the Eleventh Amendment.5IIILastly, we deal with the procedure that was used in thiscase. Creditors generally are not entitled to personal service before a bankruptcy court may discharge a debt. Hanover Nat. Bank, 186 U. S., at 192. Because student loandebts are not automatically dischargeable, however, the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure provide creditorsgreater procedural protection. See Fed. Rules Bkrtcy. Proc.7001(6), 7003, and 7004. The current Bankruptcy Rules re-quire the debtor to file an "adversary proceeding" againstthe State in order to discharge his student loan debt. The5 This is not to say, "a bankruptcy court's in rem jurisdiction overridessovereign immunity," United States v. Nordic Village, Inc., 503 U. S. 30,38 (1992), as Justice Thomas characterizes our opinion, post, at 462, butrather that the court's exercise of its in rem jurisdiction to discharge astudent loan debt is not an affront to the sovereignty of the State. Nordo we hold that every exercise of a bankruptcy court's in rem jurisdictionwill not offend the sovereignty of the State. No such concerns are present here, and we do not address them.541US2 Unit: $U46 [05-20-06 18:28:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN452 TENNESSEE STUDENT ASSISTANCE CORPORATIONv. HOODOpinion of the Courtproceeding is considered part of the original bankruptcycase, see 10 Collier on Bankruptcy || 7003.02 (rev. 15th ed.2003), and still within the bankruptcy court's in rem jurisdic-tion as discussed above. But, as prescribed by the Rules,an "adversary proceeding" requires the service of a sum-mons and a complaint. Rules 7001(6), 7003, and 7004.Because this "adversary proceeding" has some similaritiesto a traditional civil trial, Justice Thomas contends that theBankruptcy Court cannot make an undue hardship determination without infringing TSAC's sovereignty under FederalMaritime Comm'n v. South Carolina Ports Authority, 535U. S. 743 (2002). See post, at 457-460. In Federal Maritime Comm'n, we held that the Eleventh Amendment precluded a private party from haling an unconsenting Stateinto a proceeding before the Federal Maritime Commission(FMC). We noted that we have applied a presumption sinceHans v. Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1 (1890), "that the Constitutionwas not intended to `rais[e] up' any proceedings against theStates that were `anomalous and unheard of when the Constitution was adopted.' " 535 U. S., at 755. Because agencyadjudications were unheard of at the time of the founding,we had to determine whether the FMC proceeding was "thetype of proceedin[g] from which the Framers would havethought the States possessed immunity when they agreedto enter the Union." Id., at 756. Noting the substantialsimilarities between a proceeding before the FMC and onebefore an Article III court, we concluded that the Hans presumption applied, see 535 U. S., at 756-763, and that theEleventh Amendment therefore precluded private suits insuch a forum, id., at 769.In this case, however, there is no need to engage in a comparative analysis to determine whether the adjudicationwould be an affront to States' sovereignty. As noted above,we have long held that the bankruptcy courts' exercise of inrem jurisdiction is not such an offense. Supra, at 448-451.Nor is there any dispute that, if the Bankruptcy Court had541US2 Unit: $U46 [05-20-06 18:28:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN453Cite as: 541 U. S. 440 (2004)Opinion of the Courtto exercise personal jurisdiction over TSAC, such an adju-dication would implicate the Eleventh Amendment. Ourprecedent has drawn a distinction between in rem and inpersonam jurisdiction, even when the underlying proceedings are, for the most part, identical. Thus, whether an inrem adjudication in a bankruptcy court is similar to civil litigation in a district court is irrelevant. If Justice Thomas'interpretation of Federal Maritime Comm'n were adopted,Deep Sea Research, Van Huffle, and Irving Trust, all ofwhich involved proceedings resembling traditional civil adju-dications, would likely have to be overruled. We are notwilling to take such a step.The issuance of process, nonetheless, is normally an indignity to the sovereignty of a State because its purpose is toestablish personal jurisdiction over the State. We noted inSeminole Tribe: "The Eleventh Amendment does not existsolely in order to prevent federal-court judgments that mustbe paid out of a State's treasury; it also serves to avoid theindignity of subjecting a State to the coercive process of judicial tribunals at the instance of private parties." 517 U. S.,at 58 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).Here, however, the Bankruptcy Court's in rem jurisdictionallows it to adjudicate the debtor's discharge claim without in personam jurisdiction over the State. See 4A C.Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure $ 1070,pp. 280-281 (3d ed. 2002) (noting jurisdiction over the personis irrelevant if the court has jurisdiction over the property).Hood does not argue that the court should exercise personaljurisdiction; all she wants is a determination of the dischargeability of her debt. The text of $ 523(a)(8) does notrequire a summons, and absent Rule 7001(6) a debtor couldproceed by motion, see Rule 9014 ("[I]n a contested matter. . . not otherwise governed by these rules, relief shall berequested by motion"), which would raise no constitutionalconcern. Hood concedes that even if TSAC ignores the summons and chooses not to participate in the proceeding the541US2 Unit: $U46 [05-20-06 18:28:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN454 TENNESSEE STUDENT ASSISTANCE CORPORATIONv. HOODOpinion of the CourtBankruptcy Court cannot discharge her debt without makingan undue hardship determination. Tr. of Oral Arg. 33-34.We see no reason why the service of a summons, which inthis case is indistinguishable in practical effect from a motion, should be given dispositive weight. As we said inIdaho v. Coeur d'Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U. S. 261, 270(1997), "[t]he real interests served by the Eleventh Amendment are not to be sacrificed to elementary mechanics of cap-tions and pleading." SeeNew York I, 256 U. S., at 500 (asuit against a State "is to be determined not by the merenames of the titular parties but by the essential nature andeffect of the proceeding, as it appears from the entire record"). To conclude that the issuance of a summons, which isrequired only by the Rules, precludes Hood from exercisingher statutory right to an undue hardship determinationwould give the Rules an impermissible effect. 28 U. S. C.$ 2075 ("[The Bankruptcy Rules] shall not abridge, enlarge,or modify any substantive right"). And there is no reasonto take such a step. TSAC sought only to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction in the Bankruptcy Court. Motion to Dismiss Complaint for Lack of Jurisdiction inNo. 99-0847 (Bkrtcy. Ct. WD Tenn.), pp. 1-2. Clearly dismissal of the complaint is not appropriate as the court hasin rem jurisdiction over the matter, and the court here hasnot attempted to adjudicate any claims outside of that jurisdiction. The case before us is thus unlike an adversary proceeding by the bankruptcy trustee seeking to recover property in the hands of the State on the grounds that thetransfer was a voidable preference. Even if we were to holdthat Congress lacked the ability to abrogate state sovereignimmunity under the Bankruptcy Clause, as TSAC urges usto do, the Bankruptcy Court would still have the authorityto make the undue hardship determination sought by Hood.We therefore decline to decide whether a bankruptcycourt's exercise of personal jurisdiction over a State wouldbe valid under the Eleventh Amendment. See Liverpool,541US2 Unit: $U46 [05-20-06 18:28:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN455Cite as: 541 U. S. 440 (2004)Thomas, J., dissentingNew York & Philadelphia S. S. Co. v. Commissioners of Em-igration, 113 U. S. 33, 39 (1885) ("[We are bound] never toanticipate a question of constitutional law in advance of thenecessity of deciding it"). If the Bankruptcy Court on remand exceeds its in rem jurisdiction, TSAC, of course, willbe free to challenge the court's authority. At this point,however, any such constitutional concern is merely hypothet-ical. The judgment of the United States Court of Appealsfor the Sixth Circuit is affirmed, and the case is remandedfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
