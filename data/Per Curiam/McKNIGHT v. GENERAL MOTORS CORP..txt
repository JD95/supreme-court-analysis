After petitioner appealed the dismissal of his employmentdiscrimination claim, respondent moved for dismissal of theappeal and for sanctions. Respondent argued that the ap-peal was frivolous in light of controlling decisions of theCourt of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit holding that $ 101of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, 105 Stat. 1071, 42 U. S. C.$ 1981 (1988 ed., Supp. IV), does not apply to cases arisingbefore its enactment. SeeLuddington v. Indiana Bell Tel.Co., 966 F. 2d 225 (1992); Mozee v. American CommercialMarine Serv. Co., 963 F. 2d 929 (1992). In an order datedSeptember 30, 1992, the Court of Appeals granted respond-ent's motion, dismissed the appeal, and imposed a $500 sanction on petitioner's attorney.The Court of Appeals correctly rejected petitioner's argument that $ 101 applies retroactively. See Landgraf v. USI511us2$58z 07-15-96 19:21:54 PAGES OPINPGT660 McKNIGHT v. GENERAL MOTORS CORP.Per CuriamFilm Products, ante, p. 244; Rivers v. Roadway Express,Inc., ante, p. 298. However, if the only basis for the orderimposing sanctions on petitioner's attorney was that his ret-roactivity argument was foreclosed by Circuit precedent, theorder was not proper. As petitioner noted in his memoran-dum opposing dismissal and sanctions, this Court had not yetruled on the application of $ 101 to pending cases. Filing anappeal was the only way petitioner could preserve the issuepending a possible favorable decision by this Court. Al-though, as of September 30, 1992, there was no circuit conflicton the retroactivity question, that question had divided theDistrict Courts and its answer was not so clear as to makepetitioner's position frivolous. See Mozee, supra, at 940-941 (Cudahy, J., dissenting).Accordingly, the petition for a writ of certiorari is granted,the order imposing sanctions is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
