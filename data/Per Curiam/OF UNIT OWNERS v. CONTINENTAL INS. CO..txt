In this diversity case, the holding of the federal appellatecourt below has been called into question by a recent decision of the highest state court in Maryland. We must decidewhether it is appropriate, in these circumstances, for thisCourt to grant the petition for certiorari, vacate the judg-ment of the lower court, and remand the case (GVR) forfurther consideration.Petitioner, an association of condominium owners, suedrespondent in Maryland state court, seeking to compel re-spondent to pay a $1.1 million judgment it had obtainedagainst respondent's insured, the developer of its condomin-ium complex. In a previous action, a jury had held thedeveloper liable for numerous defects in the complex, find-ing that the developer had made misrepresentations andbreached various warranty obligations. Respondent hadissued a general liability insurance policy covering the developer. The policy provided that respondent would pay" `those sums that [the developer] becomes legally obligatedto pay as damages because of . . . "property damage" towhich this insurance applies.' " App. to Pet. for Cert. 2a.Under the policy, "property damage" was covered only if itwas caused by an "accident."Respondent removed the action to the United States Dis-trict Court for the District of Maryland, based on the parties'diversity of citizenship. The District Court granted sum-mary judgment in favor of respondent. On August 6, 1996,the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed. TheCourt of Appeals held that, as a matter of Maryland law, an"accident" does not include the "natural and ordinary consequences of a negligent act."

S. 893 (1997)Per Curiamof warranties and misrepresentations relating to poor work-manship, the Court of Appeals concluded that the damageswere not caused by an "accident" within the meaning of re-spondent's insurance policy. The Court of Appeals denied apetition for rehearing on September 3, 1996, and issued themandate on September 11, 1996.On September 17, 1996, petitioner's counsel learned ofSheets v. Brethren Mutual Ins. Co., 342 Md. 634, 679 A. 2d540, a recent decision of the Maryland Court of Appeals--the highest court in Maryland. (Although Sheets washanded down on July 26, 1996, 11 days before the Court ofAppeals' decision, the parties were not aware of the decisionuntil after the mandate was issued, and therefore had notbrought the case to the attention of the Court of Appeals.Pet. for Cert. 11.) Sheets cast doubt on the soundness of theCourt of Appeals' decision because it held that "an act ofnegligence constitutes an `accident' under a liability insurance policy when the resulting damage was `an event thattakes place without [the insured's] foresight or expectation.' "342 Md., at 652, 679 A. 2d, at 548 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The Maryland Court of Appeals alsoexpressly disapproved Ed. Winkler & Son, supra, at 1132,and IA Construction Corp., supra, at 1215, two decisions onwhich the Court of Appeals had primarily relied. 342 Md.,at 654-655, and n. 4, 679 A. 2d, at 549-550, and 550, n. 4.On September 20, 1996, petitioner filed a motion askingthe Court of Appeals to recall or stay its mandate based onthis development in Maryland law. In its response, respondent argued in part that the Court of Appeals lacked authority to recall an already issued mandate. In a brief order,the Court of Appeals denied petitioner's request, ruling onlythat "the said petition and motions are without merit."App. to Pet. for Cert. 11a. Petitioner now asks us to grantcertiorari, vacate the judgment below, and remand the caseto the Court of Appeals for further consideration in light ofSheets.

CO.Per CuriamThis case fits within the category of cases in which wehave held it is proper to issue a GVR order. "Where intervening developments, or recent developments that we havereason to believe the court below did not fully consider, reveal a reasonable probability that the decision below restsupon a premise that the lower court would reject if giventhe opportunity for further consideration, and where it appears that such a redetermination may determine the ulti-mate outcome of the litigation, a GVR order is . . . potentiallyappropriate." Lawrence v. Chater, 516 U. S. 163, 167 (1996)(per curiam). The situation here is virtually identical tothat in Thomas v. American Home Products, Inc., 519 U. S.913 (1996), a state-law case from earlier in this Term.There, after the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuitruled against petitioners, the Georgia Supreme Court overruled the holding that was the basis for the federal appealscourt's holding. Id., at 914 (Scalia, J., concurring). Theappellate court nevertheless denied a petition for rehearing,and we GVR'd. As Justice Scalia wrote in concurrence,our order was in keeping with our "longstanding practice"of vacating a court of appeals' decision based on a construction of state law that appears to contradict a recent decisionof the highest state court. Id., at 915. "[A] judgment of afederal court ruled by state law and correctly applying thatlaw as authoritatively declared by the state courts when thejudgment was rendered, must be reversed on appellate review if in the meantime the state courts have disapprovedof their former rulings and adopted different ones." Huddleston v. Dwyer, 322 U. S. 232, 236 (1944) (per curiam).Given Sheets' explicit disapproval of the cases on whichthe Court of Appeals based its decision, there is reason toquestion the correctness of the Court of Appeals' decision.It is true that petitioner brought Sheets to the attention ofthe Court of Appeals in a motion to stay or recall its mandateand that the Court of Appeals denied this motion. But theCourt of Appeals' ambiguous statement that petitioner's re520US3$66J 08-04-98 13:40:05 PAGES OPINPGT897Cite as: 520 U. S. 893 (1997)Rehnquist, C. J., dissentingquest was "without merit" does not establish that it actuallyconsidered and rejected petitioner'sSheets argument. Inopposing petitioner's motion, respondent argued that a courtof appeals lacks authority to recall its mandate, and theCourt of Appeals may have rested its denial of petitioner'smotion on this procedural ground. Respondent does notargue otherwise. Indeed, the procedural ground is by farthe most likely, given Sheets' explicit repudiation of the prec-edent on which the Court of Appeals' original judgmenthinged. Moreover, we have at least once before issued aGVR order where petitioners notified the Federal Court ofAppeals of an intervening State Supreme Court's opinion ina second petition for rehearing, which the Court of Appealsdenied. See Huddleston, supra, at 235.In these circumstances, we now grant certiorari, vacatethe judgment below, and remand the case to the Court ofAppeals for further consideration.Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice Breyerjoins, dissenting.In Thomas v. American Home Products, Inc., 519 U. S.913 (1996), the Court granted, vacated, and remanded a decision of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuitfor reconsideration in the light of a decision of the GeorgiaSupreme Court that was handed down after the Court ofAppeals had denied a petition for rehearing. The lowercourt there had had no opportunity to consider the impactof the new state-law decision.Here, by contrast, Sheets v. Brethren Mutual Ins. Co., 342Md. 634, 679 A. 2d 540 (1996), was expressly considered bythe court below. Although Sheets was not brought to theattention of the Fourth Circuit until after it had rendered itsdecision and denied rehearing, petitioner raised it nonetheless before that court in a motion to recall or stay the mandate. Petitioner's motion did not fall on deaf ears; indeed,the Fourth Circuit went to the unusual lengths of requesting520US3$66H 08-04-98 13:40:05 PAGES OPINPGT898 LORDS LANDING VILLAGE CONDOMINIUM COUNCILOF UNIT OWNERS v. CONTINENTAL INS. CO.Rehnquist, C. J., dissentinga response to the motion and then, after the response wasreceived, issuing a written order rejecting the claim. Theonly question discussed in that order is whether "Sheetsshould have required a different disposition of this case thanthe [original] disposition." App. to Pet. for Cert. 10a. Andthe court resolved that question, concluding "[w]e are of [the]opinion the said petition and motions are without merit." *Id., at 11a.If this Court has, without any briefs on the merits, concluded that the Court of Appeals' refusal to alter its opinionin the light of Sheets was wrong, it should either set thecase for argument or summarily reverse. True, this wouldrequire the investment of still more time and effort in a casethat is in the federal courts only by reason of diversity ofcitizenship, seeThomas, supra, at 917 (Rehnquist, C. J.,dissenting), but it would have the virtue of explicitly tellingthe Court of Appeals how to dispose of the case. TheCourt's decision to grant, vacate, and remand in the light ofSheets, on the contrary, is muddled and cryptic. Surely thejudges of the Court of Appeals are, in fairness, entitled tosome clearer guidance from this Court than what they arenow given.*Although it is possible to construe this statement as being based onthe procedural impropriety of raising such an issue on a motion to recallthe mandate, such a construction is nowhere suggested in the order, noris it the natural implication of the language ("without merit") used by thecourt below. I see no reason for us not to take the Fourth Circuit's orderat face value.520US3 Unit: $U67 [09-11-99 18:57:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN899OCTOBER TERM, 1996SyllabusBRACY v. GRAMLEY, WARDENcertiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe seventh circuitNo. 96-6133. Argued April 14, 1997--Decided June 9, 1997Petitioner was tried, convicted, and sentenced to death before then-JudgeThomas J. Maloney, an Illinois judge who was later convicted on federalcharges of taking bribes from criminal defendants. In this federal habeas petition, petitioner claims that Maloney had an interest in his conviction to deflect suspicion that the judge was taking bribes in othermurder cases during and around the time of petitioner's trial, and thatthis interest violated the fair-trial guarantee of the Due Process Clause.The District Court denied both the claim and a supplemental discoverymotion. In affirming, the Seventh Circuit held, inter alia, that petitioner had not shown "good cause" for discovery to prove his claim, asrequired by Rule 6(a) of the Rules Governing $ 2254 Cases.Held: Petitioner has made a sufficient factual showing, under Habeas Corpus Rule 6(a), to establish "good cause" for discovery on his claim ofactual judicial bias in his case. Pp. 904-910.(a) Before addressing whether petitioner is entitled to discovery, hisclaim's essential elements must be identified. See United States v.Armstrong, 517 U. S. 456, 468. Due process requires a fair trial beforea judge without actual bias against the defendant or an interest in theoutcome of his particular case. Petitioner claims that Maloney's acceptance of bribes from criminal defendants not only rendered him biasedagainst the State in those cases, but also induced a compensatory biasagainst defendants who did not bribe him, since he did not want toappear "soft" on criminal defendants. There is no question that, ifproved, such compensatory, camouflaging bias in petitioner's own casewould violate due process. Pp. 904-905.(b) Petitioner has shown good cause for appropriate discovery toprove his claim. The usual presumption that public officials have properly discharged their official duties has been soundly rebutted here.Maloney's public trial and conviction show that he was thoroughly corrupt. A Government proffer in that case details his corruption as botha trial attorney and a judge. Additional evidence supports the claimthat Maloney was biased in petitioner's own case. His trial attorneywas a former associate of Maloney's in a law practice that was familiarand comfortable with corruption, who announced that he was ready fortrial just a few weeks after his appointment and requested no additional520US3 Unit: $U67 [09-11-99 18:57:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN900 BRACY v. GRAMLEYOpinion of the Courttime before trial to prepare for the penalty phase of the case. Petitioner alleges that Maloney appointed the attorney with the understanding that he would not object to, or interfere with, a prompt trial, so thatpetitioner's case could camouflage bribe negotiations being conducted inanother murder case. The Government's proffer confirms that petitioner's murder trial was sandwiched tightly between other murder trialsthat Maloney fixed. Although petitioner may be unable to obtain evidence sufficient to support a finding of actual judicial bias in his trial,he has made a sufficient showing to establish "good cause" for discovery.Although, given the facts of this particular case, it would be an abuseof discretion not to permit any discovery, Habeas Corpus Rule 6(a) provides that the scope and extent of discovery is a matter confided to theDistrict Court's discretion.

We hold that petitioner has made a sufficient factual showing to establish "good cause," as required by Habeas Corpus Rule 6(a), for discovery on his claim of actualjudicial bias in his case.Maloney was one of many dishonest judges exposed andconvicted through "Operation Greylord," a labyrinthine federal investigation of judicial corruption in Chicago. SeeUnited States v. Maloney, 71 F. 3d 645 (CA7 1995), cert.denied, 519 U. S. 927 (1996); see generally J. Tuohy & R.Warden, Greylord: Justice, Chicago Style (1989). Maloneyserved as a judge from 1977 until he retired in 1990, and itappears he has the dubious distinction of being the only Illinois judge ever convicted of fixing a murder case.2 Beforehe was appointed to the bench, Maloney was a criminal defense attorney with close ties to organized crime who often1 People v.

E. 2d 1137 (1992) (Collins II) (affirmingdenial of petition for postconviction relief), cert. denied, 508 U. S. 915(1993). Bracy is also under a death sentence for two murders in Arizona.State v.

Arizona, 514 U. S. 1130 (1995) (same).2 Although apparently the first in Illinois, Maloney is not, unfortunately,the first American judge to be convicted of taking bribes in murder cases.See, e. g., Ohio v. McGettrick, 40 Ohio App. 3d 25, 531 N. E. 2d 755 (1988);In re Brennan, 65 N. Y. 2d 564, 483 N. E. 2d 484 (1985).520US3 Unit: $U67 [09-11-99 18:57:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN902 BRACY v.

App. 54-66; 81 F. 3d 684,696 (CA7 1996) (Rovner, J., dissenting) ("[B]y the time Maloney ascended to the bench in 1977, he was well groomed inthe art of judicial corruption"). Once a judge, Maloney exploited many of the relationships and connections he had de-veloped while bribing judges to solicit bribes for himself.For example, Lucius Robinson, a bailiff through whom Malo-ney had bribed judges while in practice, and Robert McGee,one of Maloney's former associates, both served as "bagmen," or intermediaries, between Maloney and lawyers looking for a fix. Two such lawyers, Robert J. Cooley and Wil-liam A. Swano, were key witnesses against Maloney at histrial. Maloney, supra, at 650-652.Maloney was convicted in Federal District Court of conspiracy, racketeering, extortion, and obstructing justice inApril 1993. Four months later, petitioner filed this habeaspetition in the United States District Court for the NorthernDistrict of Illinois, claiming, among other things, that he wasdenied a fair trial because "in order to cover up the fact that[Maloney] accepted bribes from defendants in some cases,[he] was prosecution oriented in other cases." UnitedStates ex rel. Collins v. Welborn, 868 F. Supp. 950, 990 (NDIll. 1994). Petitioner also sought discovery in support ofthis claim. Specifically, he requested (1) the sealed tran-script of Maloney's trial; (2) reasonable access to the prosecution's materials in Maloney's case; (3) the opportunity to de-pose persons associated with Maloney; and (4) a chance tosearch Maloney's rulings for a pattern of pro-prosecutionbias.3 The District Court rejected petitioner's fair-trialclaim and denied his supplemental motion for discovery, con-cluding that "[petitioner's] allegations contain insufficient3 The Government apparently conducted such research in the Maloneycase. See Proffer of the Government's Evidence in Aggravation, App. 67("[A] review of computer printouts listing all of [one attorney's] felonycases before Judge Maloney reveals that [the attorney] obtained not guiltyresults in all six of the cases he had before Judge Maloney").520US3 Unit: $U67 [09-11-99 18:57:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN903Cite as: 520 U. S. 899 (1997)Opinion of the Courtspecificity or good cause to justify further discovery." Id.,at 991.The Court of Appeals affirmed by a divided vote. Thecourt conceded the "appearance of impropriety" in petitioner's case but reasoned that this appearance did not require anew trial because it "provide[d] only a weak basis for supposing the original trial an unreliable test of the issues presented for decision in it." 81 F. 3d, at 688-689. Next, thecourt agreed that petitioner's theory--that Maloney's corruption "permeate[d] his judicial conduct"--was "plausible,"id., at 689, but found it not "sufficiently compelling [an] empirical proposition" to justify presuming actual judicial biasin petitioner's case, id., at 690. Finally, the court held thatpetitioner had not shown "good cause" for discovery to provehis claim, as required by 28 U. S. C. $ 2254 Rule 6(a). 81F. 3d, at 690. This was because, in the court's view, even ifpetitioner were to uncover evidence that Maloney sometimescame down hard on defendants who did not bribe him, "itwould not show that he followed the practice in this case."Id., at 691 (emphasis added). In any event, the court added,because petitioner had failed to uncover any evidence of actual bias without discovery, "the probability is slight that aprogram of depositions aimed at crooks and their accomplices. . . will yield such evidence." Ibid.4 We granted certiorarito address whether, on the basis of the showing made in thisparticular case, petitioner should have been granted discovery under Habeas Corpus Rule 6(a) to support his judicialbias claim. 519 U. S. 1074 (1997). We now reverse.4 The dissenting judge insisted that petitioner had shown "good cause"for discovery to support his judicial-bias claim, 81 F. 3d, at 696-699 (opinion of Rovner, J.), and went on to state that, in her view, petitioner wasentitled to relief whether or not he could prove that Maloney's corruptionhad any impact on his trial, id., at 699-703. The latter conclusion, ofcourse, would render irrelevant the discovery-related question presentedin this case.520US3 Unit: $U67 [09-11-99 18:57:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN904 BRACY v. GRAMLEYOpinion of the CourtA habeas petitioner, unlike the usual civil litigant in fed-eral court, is not entitled to discovery as a matter of ordinarycourse. Thus, in Harris v. Nelson, 394 U. S. 286, 295 (1969),we concluded that the "broad discovery provisions" of theFederal Rules of Civil Procedure did not apply in habeasproceedings. We held, however, that the All Writs Act, 28U. S. C. $ 1651, gave federal courts the power to "fashion appropriate modes of procedure," 394 U. S., at 299, includingdiscovery, to dispose of habeas petitions "as law and justicerequire," id., at 300. We then recommended that "the rule-making machinery . . . be invoked to formulate rules of practice with respect to federal habeas corpus . . . proceedings."Id., at 300, n. 7. Accordingly, in 1976, we promulgated andCongress adopted the Rules Governing $ 2254 Cases. Ofparticular relevance to this case is Rule 6(a), which provides:"A party shall be entitled to invoke the processes of dis-covery available under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure if, and to the extent that, the judge in the exerciseof his discretion and for good cause shown grants leaveto do so, but not otherwise."Before addressing whether petitioner is entitled to discovery under this Rule to support his judicial-bias claim, wemust first identify the "essential elements" of that claim.See United States v. Armstrong, 517 U. S. 456, 468 (1996).Of course, most questions concerning a judge's qualificationsto hear a case are not constitutional ones, because the DueProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment establishes aconstitutional floor, not a uniform standard.Aetna Life Ins.Co. v. Lavoie, 475 U. S. 813, 828 (1986). Instead, these questions are, in most cases, answered by common law, statute,or the professional standards of the bench and bar. See,e. g., id., at 820-821; Tumey v. Ohio, 273 U. S. 510, 523 (1927);28 U. S. C. $$ 144, 455; ABA Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon3C(1)(a) (1980). But the floor established by the Due Process Clause clearly requires a "fair trial in a fair tribunal,"520US3 Unit: $U67 [09-11-99 18:57:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN905Cite as: 520 U. S. 899 (1997)Opinion of the CourtWithrow v. Larkin, 421 U. S. 35, 46 (1975), before a judgewith no actual bias against the defendant or interest in theoutcome of his particular case. See, e. g., Aetna, supra, at821-822; Tumey, supra, at 523.The facts of this case are, happily, not the stuff of typicaljudicial-disqualification disputes. A judge who acceptsbribes from a criminal defendant to fix that defendant's caseis "biased" in the most basic sense of that word, but his biasis directed against the State, not the defendant. Petitionercontends, however, that Maloney's taking of bribes fromsome criminal defendants not only rendered him biasedagainst the State in those cases, but also induced a sort ofcompensatory bias against defendants who did not bribeMaloney. Maloney was biased in this latter, compensatorysense, petitioner argues, to avoid being seen as uniformlyand suspiciously "soft" on criminal defendants. The Courtof Appeals, in its opinion, pointed out that this theory is quitespeculative; after all, it might be equally likely that a judgewho was "on the take" in some criminal cases would be careful to at least appear to favor all criminal defendants, so asto avoid apparently wild and unexplainable swings in decisions and judicial philosophy. 81 F. 3d, at 689-690.5 In anyevent, difficulties of proof aside, there is no question that, ifit could be proved, such compensatory, camouflaging bias onMaloney's part in petitioner's own case would violate theDue Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Wenow turn to the question whether petitioner has shown "good5 At Maloney's trial, however, attorney William Swano provided testimony that lends some support to petitioner's compensatory-bias theory.See 81 F. 3d, at 697 (Rovner, J., dissenting). According to Swano, Maloneyretaliated against one of Swano's clients in one of the rare cases whenSwano failed to offer Maloney a bribe and, in bribe negotiations in a latercase, Maloney's bag man Robert McGee admitted as much. Swano testified that he learned that in order " `to practice in front of Judge Maloney. . . we had to pay.' " Ibid.520US3 Unit: $U67 [09-11-99 18:57:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN906 BRACY v.

App. 12, n. 1, 36-38.In a supplemental motion for discovery, petitioner's co-defendant Roger Collins alleged that "[a] Government witness in the Maloney case has advised . . . that co-defendantBracy's trial attorney was a former partner of Thomas Maloney." App. 51. Collins attached to that motion a copy ofthe United States' proffer of evidence in aggravation in Maloney's case, which describes in considerable detail Maloney'scorruption both before and after he became a judge. SeeApp. 54 ("Although [it is] difficult to imagine, Thomas Malo-ney's life of corruption was considerably more expansivethan proved at trial"). The United States' proffer asserts,for example, that Maloney fixed serious felony cases regularly while a practicing criminal defense attorney; 7 that, asa judge, he continued to corrupt justice through the same6 We express no opinion on the correctness of the various discretionaryrulings cited by petitioner as examples of Maloney's bias. See Brief forPetitioner 5-6. We note, however, that many of these rulings have beentwice upheld, and that petitioner's convictions and sentence have beentwice affirmed, by the Illinois Supreme Court. See n. 1, supra.7 The Government introduced evidence that Maloney regularly bribedJudge Maurice Pompey and Cook County Deputy Sheriff Lucius Robinson(who would later serve as Maloney's "bag man"); that on numerous occasions, using his organized-crime connections, Maloney fixed cases for hisclient Michael Bertucci; and that Maloney helped orchestrate the fix in themurder case of underworld hit man Harry Aleman.

William Swano testified at Maloney's trial that, in October 1980, he bribed Maloney in the murder case ofSwano's client, Wilfredo Rosario. Maloney excluded Rosario's confessionand, in May 1981, acquitted Rosario after a bench trial. Maloney, supra,at 650; App. 12, n. 1, 53, n. 1. Also in May 1981, Maloney took a bribe tothrow the murder case of Lenny Chow, a hit man for a Chinatown crimeorganization. At a bench trial that August, Maloney admitted a dyingdeclaration, but found it unreliable, and acquitted Chow. Maloney, supra,at 650; App. 20-22, 27. In 1982, Maloney and Swano fixed another murdercase in which one Owen Jones was charged with beating a man to deathwith a lead pipe. Maloney took $4,000-$5,000 from Jones' mother, usinghis former associate Robert McGee as a "bag man," to acquit Jones on thefelony-murder charge, and to convict him of voluntary manslaughter only.Maloney, supra, at 651; App. 20, 22, 28.520US3 Unit: $U67 [09-11-99 18:57:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN908 BRACY v. GRAMLEYOpinion of the Courtnounced at the outset that, if petitioner were convicted, itwould introduce petitioner's then-pending Arizona murdercharges as evidence in aggravation. Tr. of Oral Arg. 43.10At oral argument before this Court, counsel for petitionersuggested, given that at least one of Maloney's former lawassociates--Robert McGee--was corrupt and involved inbribery, see supra, at 907, that petitioner's trial lawyermight have been appointed with the understanding that hewould not object to, or interfere with, a prompt trial, so thatpetitioner's case could be tried before, and camouflage thebribe negotiations in, the Chow murder case. Tr. of OralArg. 17-18, 43-44.11 This is, of course, only a theory at thispoint; it is not supported by any solid evidence of petition-er's trial lawyer's participation in any such plan. It is true,however, that McGee was corrupt and that petitioner's trialcoincided with bribe negotiations in theChow case andclosely followed theRosario murder case, which was alsofixed. See n. 9, supra.We conclude that petitioner has shown "good cause" fordiscovery under Rule 6(a). In Harris, we stated that"where specific allegations before the court show reason to10 Petitioner's lawyer did request a continuance after petitioner was convicted, on July 29, 1981, and again on July 30. Maloney denied these requests, however, and the sentencing hearing was conducted the next day.See People v. Collins, 106 Ill., at 280-281, 478 N. E. 2d, at 286; 81 F. 3d,at 694-695 ("Defense lawyers know . . . [that] if they wish to gather evidence of mitigating circumstances they must do so before the trial ends,because they will have no time to do so after the trial ends. But in thiscase the defendants' lawyers dropped the ball"); United States ex rel. Collins v. Welborn, 868 F. Supp. 950, 986-987 (ND Ill. 1994) (noting that "nowitnesses were presented by [petitioner or his codefendant]").11 Petitioner's counsel admitted that he "ha[d] not made this exact sameargument on a previous occasion, but it is supported by the record." Tr.of Oral Arg. 43. Cf. Reply Brief for Petitioner 6 ("[I]t is impossible tosay with confidence that Judge Maloney did not deliberately select a lessexperienced lawyer to represent Petitioner due to a corrupt motive, suchas a desire to insure a guilty verdict and a death sentence in a high profile case").520US3 Unit: $U67 [09-11-99 18:57:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN909Cite as: 520 U.

S., at 300.Habeas Corpus Rule 6 is meant to be "consistent" withHarris. Advisory Committee's Note on Habeas CorpusRule 6, 28 U. S. C., p. 479. Ordinarily, we presume that public officials have " `properly discharged their official duties.' "Armstrong, 517 U. S., at 464 (quoting United States v. Chemical Foundation, Inc., 272 U. S. 1, 14-15 (1926)). Were itpossible to indulge this presumption here, we might wellagree with the Court of Appeals that petitioner's submissionand his compensatory-bias theory are too speculative to warrant discovery. But, unfortunately, the presumption hasbeen soundly rebutted: Maloney was shown to be thoroughlysteeped in corruption through his public trial and conviction.We emphasize, though, that petitioner supports his discoveryrequest by pointing not only to Maloney's conviction forbribe taking in other cases, but also to additional evidence,discussed above, that lends support to his claim that Maloneywas actually biased in petitioner's own case. That is, hepresents "specific allegations" that his trial attorney, a former associate of Maloney's in a law practice that was familiarand comfortable with corruption, may have agreed to takethis capital case to trial quickly so that petitioner's conviction would deflect any suspicion the rigged Rosario andChow cases might attract. It may well be, as the Court ofAppeals predicted, that petitioner will be unable to obtainevidence sufficient to support a finding of actual judicial biasin the trial of his case, but we hold that he has made a sufficient showing, as required by Habeas Corpus Rule 6(a), toestablish "good cause" for discovery. Although, given thefacts of this particular case, it would be an abuse of discretion not to permit any discovery, Rule 6(a) makes it clear thatthe scope and extent of such discovery is a matter confided tothe discretion of the District Court.520US3 Unit: $U67 [09-11-99 18:57:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN910 BRACY v.

Argued February 26, 1997--Decided June 9, 1997Respondent filed this 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 damages action in Idaho statecourt, alleging that the termination of her state employment by petitioner officials deprived her of property without due process in violationof the Fourteenth Amendment. The trial court denied petitioners' motion to dismiss, which asserted that they were entitled to qualified immunity. The Idaho Supreme Court dismissed their appeal from thatruling, explaining that the denial was neither an appealable final orderunder Idaho Appellate Rule 11(a)(1) nor appealable as a matter of federal right under $ 1983.Held: Defendants in a state-court $ 1983 action do not have a federal rightto an interlocutory appeal from a denial of qualified immunity.Pp. 914-923.(a) State officials performing discretionary functions have a "qualifiedimmunity" defense that, in appropriate circumstances, shields them bothfrom liability for damages under $ 1983 and from the burdens of trial.Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, 818. A federal district court orderrejecting such a defense on the ground that the defendant's actions--ifproved--would have violated clearly established law may be appealedimmediately as a "final decision" under the general federal appellatejurisdiction statute, 28 U. S. C. $ 1291. Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U. S.511, 524-530. Relying on respondent's federal statutory claim and theirown federal defense, petitioners submit that the Idaho courts must protect their right to avoid the burdens of trial by allowing the same interlocutory appeal that would be available in a federal court. Pp. 914-916.(b) This Court rejects petitioners' argument that when the Idahocourts construe their own Rule 11(a)(1), they must accept the federaldefinition of a "final decision" in cases brought under $ 1983. Even ifthe Idaho Rule and $ 1291 contained identical language--and they donot--the Idaho Supreme Court's interpretation of the Rule would bebinding on federal courts, which have no authority to place a differentconstruction upon it. See, e. g., New York v. Ferber, 458 U. S. 747, 767.Idaho could voluntarily place the same construction on the Rule as theMitchell Court placed on $ 1291, but this Court cannot command thatchoice. Pp. 916-918.(c) Also unpersuasive is petitioners' contention that Rule 11(a)(1) ispre-empted by $ 1983 to the extent that it does not allow an interlocu520us3$68Z 08-19-98 15:30:26 PAGES OPINPGT912 JOHNSON v. FANKELLSyllabustory appeal. Petitioners' arguments are not strong enough to overcometwo considerable hurdles. First, the normal presumption against preemption is buttressed here by the fact that the Idaho Supreme Court'sdismissal of the appeal rested squarely on a neutral state rule for administering state courts. Howlett v. Rose, 496 U. S. 356, 372. Second, because the qualified immunity defense's ultimate purpose is to protectthe State and its officials from overenforcement of federal rights, Rule11(a)(1)'s application in this context is less an interference with federalinterests, as petitioners claim, than a judgment about how best to balance competing state interests. In arguing that pre-emption is necessary to avoid different "outcomes" in $ 1983 litigation based solely onwhether the claim is asserted in state or federal court, petitioners misplace their reliance on Felder v. Casey, 487 U. S. 131, 138. "[O]utcom[e]," as used there, referred to the ultimate disposition of the case,whereas the postponement of the appeal until after final judgment willnot affect the ultimate outcome of this case if petitioners' qualified immunity claim is meritorious. Their argument that Rule 11(a)(1) doesnot adequately protect their right to prevail on the immunity questionin advance of trial also fails, given the precise source and scope of thefederal right at issue. In contrast to the right to have the trial courtrule on the immunity defense's merits, which presumably has its sourcein $ 1983 and is fully protected by Idaho, the right to immediate appellate review of such a ruling in a federal case has its source in $ 1291,not $ 1983, see Johnson v. Jones, 515 U. S. 304, 317, and is a federalprocedural right that simply does not apply in a nonfederal forum.Pp. 918-923.
