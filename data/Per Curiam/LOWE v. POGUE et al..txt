Pro se petitioner Lowe seeks leave to proceed in formapauperis under Rule 39 of this Court. We deny this requestpursuant to Rule 39.8. Lowe is allowed until April 19, 1999,within which to pay the docketing fee required by Rule 38and to submit his petitions in compliance with this Court'sRule 33.1. We also direct the Clerk not to accept any further petitions for certiorari nor petitions for extraordinarywrits from Lowe in noncriminal matters unless he pays thedocketing fee required by Rule 38 and submits his petitionin compliance with Rule 33.1.Lowe has abused this Court's certiorari and extraordinarywrit processes. In November of last year and earlier thismonth, we invoked Rule 39.8 to deny Lowe in forma pau-peris status. See Lowe v. Cantrell, 525 U. S. 1176 (1999);In re Lowe, 525 U. S. 960 (1998) (three cases). Before these4 denials, Lowe had filed 23 petitions, all of which wereboth patently frivolous and had been denied without re*Together with No. 98-7952, Lowe v.

The 4 instant petitions for certiorari thusbring Lowe's total number of frivolous filings to 31. He hasseveral additional filings--all of them patently frivolous--currently pending before this Court.We enter the order barring prospective filings for the rea-sons discussed inMartin v. District of Columbia Court ofAppeals, 506 U. S. 1 (1992) (per curiam). Lowe's abuse ofthe writ of certiorari and of the extraordinary writs has beenin noncriminal cases, and so we limit our sanction accordingly. The order therefore will not prevent Lowe from peti-tioning to challenge criminal sanctions which might be imposed on him. The order, however, will allow this Court todevote its limited resources to the claims of petitioners whohave not abused our process.
