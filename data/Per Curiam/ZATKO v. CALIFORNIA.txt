Last Term, we amended Rule 39 of the Rules of the Su-preme Court of the United States to add the following:"39.8. If satisfied that a petition for a writ of certiorari,jurisdictional statement, or petition for an extraordinarywrit, as the case may be, is frivolous or malicious, theCourt may deny a motion for leave to proceedinforma pauperis."Because in forma pauperis petitioners lack the financialdisincentives--filing fees and attorney's fees--that help to*Together with No. 91-5111, Zatko v.

In ordering the amend-ment, we sought to discourage frivolous and maliciousinforma pauperis filings, "particularly [from] those few persons whose filings are repetitive with the obvious effect ofburdening the office of the Clerk and other members ofthe Court staff." In re Amendment to Rule 39, 500 U. S. 13(1991).Today, we invoke Rule 39.8 for the first time, and deny informa pauperis status to petitioners Vladimir Zatko andJames L. Martin. We do not do so casually, however. Wedeny leave to proceed in forma pauperis only with respectto two petitioners who have repeatedly abused the integrityof our process through frequent frivolous filings. Over thelast 10 years, Zatko has filed 73 petitions in this Court; 34 ofthose filings have come within the last 2 years. Martin hasbeen only slightly less prolific over the same 10-year periodand has filed over 45 petitions, 15 of them within the last 2years. In each of their filings up to this point, we have permitted Zatko and Martin to proceed in forma pauperis, andwe have denied their petitions without recorded dissent.However, this Court's goal of fairly dispensing justice "iscompromised when the Court is forced to devote its limitedresources to the processing of repetitious and frivolous requests" such as these. In re Sindram, 498 U. S. 177, 179-180(1991). We conclude that the pattern of repetitious filing onthe part of Zatko and Martin has resulted in an extremeabuse of the system. In the hope that our action will deterfuture similar frivolous practices, we deny Zatko and Martinleave to proceed in forma pauperis in these cases.The dissent complains that, by invoking this Rule againstZatko and Martin, we appear to ignore our duty to provideequal access to justice for both the rich and the poor. Themessage we hope to send is quite the opposite, however. Inorder to advance the interests of justice, the Court's general502us1$$3Z 08-21-96 15:21:59 PAGES OPINPGT18 ZATKO v. CALIFORNIAStevens, J., dissentingpractice is to waive all filing fees and costs for indigent indi-viduals, whether or not the petitions those individuals fileare frivolous. As the dissent recognizes, for example, wellover half of the numerous in forma pauperis petitions filedsince the beginning of this Term are best characterized asfrivolous. It is important to observe that we have not applied Rule 39.8 to those frivolous petitions, although the Rulemight technically apply to them. Instead, we have deniedthose petitions in the usual manner, underscoring our com-mitment to hearing the claims, however meritless, of thepoor. But "[i]t is vital that the right to file in forma pauperis not be incumbered by those who would abuse the integ-rity of our process by frivolous filings."In re Amendmentto Rule 39, supra, at 13. For that reason we take the limited step of censuring two petitioners who are unique--notmerely among those who seek to file in forma pauperis, butalso among those who have paid the required filing fees--because they have repeatedly made totally frivolous demands on the Court's limited resources.To discourage abusive tactics that actually hinder us fromproviding equal access to justice for all, we therefore denyleave to proceedin forma pauperis in these cases, pursuantto Rule 39.8. Accordingly, petitioners are allowed until November 25, 1991, within which to pay the docketing fee re-quired by Rule 38 and to submit petitions in compliance withRule 33 of the Rules of this Court. Future similar filingsfrom these petitioners will merit additional measures.
