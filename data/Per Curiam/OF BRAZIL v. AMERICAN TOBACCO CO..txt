Section 455(a) of 28 U. S. C. (1994 ed.) provides that ajudge "shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in whichhis impartiality might reasonably be questioned." In thistobacco-products liability case, the Court of Appeals for theFifth Circuit held that $ 455(a) required disqualification of aDistrict Judge whose name appeared erroneously, prior tohis appointment to the bench, on a motion to file an amicusbrief in a similar suit against some of the same defendants.Republic of Panama v. American Tobacco Co., 250 F. 3d 315(2001)(per curiam) (Republic of Panama II). We grantthe writ of certiorari and reverse.Petitioner, Sao Paulo State, brought this suit against re-spondent tobacco companies in Louisiana state court. It alleged that respondents had conspired to conceal the healthrisks of smoking, thereby preventing it from adopting policies that would have reduced smoking by Sao Paulo citi-zens. It seeks compensation for the costs of treating theirsmoking-related health problems. The suit was removed tothe United States District Court for the Eastern District ofLouisiana and assigned to District Judge Carl J. Barbier, whohad presided over a companion case, Republic of Panama v.American Tobacco Co., No. 98-3279, 1999 WL 350030 (EDLa., May 28, 1999)(Republic of Panama I), vacated and remanded, 217 F. 3d 343 (CA5 2000). As in that case, respond-ents filed a motion seeking Judge Barbier's recusal under$ 455(a) because of his involvement, prior to appointment tothe bench, in a similar suit against some of the respondents.Almost nine years before the present suit was commenced,Judge Barbier's name appeared on a motion to file anamicuscuriae brief in Gilboy v. American Tobacco Co., 582 So. 2d1263 (La. 1991). The motion was submitted by the Louisiana Trial Lawyers Association (LTLA), and erroneouslylisted Judge Barbier as the association's president, a positionfrom which he had retired about six months earlier. Themotion also correctly listed as a member of the LTLA's535US1 Unit: $U37 [11-13-02 11:22:45] PAGES PGT: OPIN231Cite as: 535 U.

Brief for LTLA as Amicus Curiae in No. 90-C-2686(La. Sup. Ct.), App. to Brief in Opposition 9a; Gilboy, supra,at 1266.Respondents argued that Judge Barbier's association withthe Gilboy amicus brief created an "appearance of partiality" requiring disqualification under $ 455(a). Brief in Opposition 3. Judge Barbier disagreed. Adopting his reasonsfor denying recusal in Republic of Panama I, he refused todisqualify himself because his name appeared in error on themotion to file the amicus brief and because he took no partin preparation or approval of the brief.

Indeed, he was previously unaware of it, which he found unsurprising because the LTLA affixed the president's name to allmotions to file amicus briefs, despite the fact that the president had absolutely no role in preparation or approval of thebriefs.

Judge Barbier also noted in Republic of Panama Ithat he had never practiced law with Mr. St. Martin or anyother lawyer listed on the motion, had no personal knowledge of the disputed facts in Gilboy, had never taken a position with respect to any of the issues raised in petitioner'ssuit, and had never been involved in a tobacco-related case"one way or another in my whole legal career."

See also Tr. ofProceeding 39-40, App. to Pet. for Cert. 50a-51a.The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed, citingits prior decision reversing Judge Barbier's order denyingrecusal in Republic of Panama I. In that case, the FifthCircuit said:"The fact that Judge Barbier's name was listed on a mo-tion to file an amicus brief which asserted similar allegations against tobacco companies to the ones made inthis case may lead a reasonable person to doubt his impartiality. Also, Judge Barbier was listed on this filingwith the attorney who is currently representing the Republic of Panama. The trial judge's assertions that hedid not participate directly in the writing or researchingof the amicus brief do not dissipate the doubts that areasonable person would probably have about the court'simpartiality. We acknowledge that this is a close casefor recusal." 217 F. 3d, at 347.Judge Parker concurred, agreeing that the court was boundby its decision inRepublic of Panama I, but arguing thatthat decision was "erroneous because it requires recusal onthe basis of a judge's public statements on the law madeprior to becoming a judge . . . ."Republic of Panama II,supra, at 318. Rehearing en banc was denied over the dis-sent of six judges, who argued that the decision belowamounts to an "issue recusal" rule, requiring disqualificationwhenever a judge has pre-judicial association with a legalposition. 265 F. 3d 299, 306 (2001) ( joint dissent of Wienerand Parker, JJ.).We need not consider the argument advanced by the dissenting judges, since this case is easily disposed of on othergrounds. The Fifth Circuit's decision is inconsistent withLiljeberg v. Health Services Acquisition Corp., 486 U. S. 847(1988), which stated that $ 455(a) requires judicial recusal"if a reasonable person, knowing all the circumstances,535US1 Unit: $U37 [11-13-02 11:22:45] PAGES PGT: OPIN233Cite as: 535 U.

The Fifth Circuitreached the conclusion that recusal was required because itconsidered what a reasonable person would believe withoutknowing (or giving due weight to the fact) that the judge'sname was added mistakenly and without his knowledge toapro forma motion to file an amicus brief in a separatecontroversy. Although Judge Barbier was indeed a leaderof the LTLA at that time (he was a member of the associa-tion's executive committee), he took no part in the preparation or approval of the amicus brief; indeed, he was only"vaguely aware" of the case. Tr. of Status Conf. 8, App. toPet. for Cert. 54a. The decision whether his "impartialitymight reasonably be questioned" should not have been madein disregard of these facts; and when they are taken intoaccount we think it self-evident that a reasonable personwould not believe he had any interest or bias.Accordingly, we grant the petition for certiorari, reversethe judgment of the Court of Appeals, and remand the casefor proceedings consistent with this opinion.
