The motion of petitioner for leave to proceed in formapauperis and the petition for a writ of certiorari are granted.A Georgia jury found petitioner Wilburn Dobbs guilty ofmurder and sentenced him to death. In his first federal habeas petition, petitioner claimed, inter alia, that he received506us2$19Z 08-22-96 19:13:25 PAGES OPINPGT358 DOBBS v. ZANTPer Curiamineffective assistance from his court-appointed counsel atsentencing. The District Court rejected this claim afterholding an evidentiary hearing. Because a transcript of theclosing arguments made at sentencing was, by the State'srepresentation, unavailable, the District Court relied on thetestimony of petitioner's counsel regarding the content of hisclosing argument to find that counsel had rendered effectiveassistance. Civ. Action No. 80-247 (ND Ga., Jan. 13, 1984),p. 24. The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed, also relying on counsel's testimony about his closingargument in mitigation.Dobbs v. Kemp, 790 F. 2d 1499,1514, and n. 15 (1986).Subsequently, petitioner located a transcript of the penaltyphase closing arguments, which flatly contradicted the account given by counsel in key respects. Petitioner movedthe Court of Appeals, now reviewing related proceedingsfrom the District Court, to supplement the record on appealwith the sentencing transcript. The court denied this motion without explanation. No. 90-8352 (CA11, Nov. 1, 1990).Affirming the District Court's denial of relief on otherclaims, the Eleventh Circuit held that the law of the casedoctrine prevented it from revisiting its prior rejectionof petitioner's ineffective-assistance claim. The court acknowledged the manifest injustice exception to law of thecase, but refused to apply the exception, reasoning that itsdenial of leave to supplement the record left petitioner unable to show an injustice. 963 F. 2d 1403, 1409 (1991).We hold that the Court of Appeals erred when it refusedto consider the full sentencing transcript. We have emphasized before the importance of reviewing capital sentenceson a complete record. Gardner v. Florida, 430 U. S. 349,361 (1977) (plurality opinion). Cf. Gregg v. Georgia, 428U. S. 153, 167, 198 (1976) ( joint opinion of Stewart, Powell,and Stevens, JJ.) (Georgia capital sentencing provision requiring transmittal on appeal of complete transcript andrecord is important "safeguard against arbitrariness and ca506us2$19Z 08-22-96 19:13:25 PAGES OPINPGT359Cite as: 506 U. S. 357 (1993)Per Curiamprice"). In this case, the Court of Appeals offered no justification for its decision to exclude the transcript from consideration. There can be no doubt as to the transcript's relevance, for it calls into serious question the factual predicateon which the District Court and Court of Appeals reliedin deciding petitioner's ineffective-assistance claim. As theCourt of Appeals itself acknowledged, its refusal to reviewthe transcript left it unable to apply the manifest injustice exception to the law of the case doctrine, and henceunable to determine whether its prior decision should bereconsidered.*On the facts of this case, exclusion of the transcript cannotbe justified by the delay in its discovery. That delay resulted substantially from the State's own erroneous assertions that closing arguments had not been transcribed. Asthe District Court found: "[T]he entire transcript shouldhave been made available for Dobbs' direct appeal, and theState represented to this Court that the sentencing phaseclosing arguments could not be transcribed. Dobbs' positionthat he legitimately relied on the State's representation iswell taken." Civ. Action No. 80-247 (ND Ga., Mar. 6,1990), p. 4.We hold that, under the particular circumstances described above, the Court of Appeals erred by refusing toconsider the sentencing hearing transcript. The judgment*The concurrence suggests, post, at 360-363, that the error in this case,limited in scope to closing arguments at the penalty phase, is likely insignificant. In fact, an inadequate or harmful closing argument, when combined, as here, with a failure to present mitigating evidence, may be highlyrelevant to the ineffective-assistance determination under Eleventh Circuit law. See King v. Strickland, 714 F. 2d 1481, 1491 (CA11 1983), vacated on other grounds, 467 U. S. 1211, adhered to on remand, 748 F. 2d1462, 1463-1464 (CA11 1984), cert. denied, 471 U. S. 1016 (1985); Mathis v.Zant, 704 F. Supp. 1062, 1064 (ND Ga. 1989). In any event, we see noreason to depart here from our normal practice of allowing courts morefamiliar with a case to conduct their own harmless-error analyses.506us2$19Z 08-22-96 19:13:25 PAGES OPINPGT360 DOBBS v.
