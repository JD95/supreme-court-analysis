WILLIAMSStevens, J., dissentingreasons discussed below, we also direct the Clerk of theCourt not to accept any further petitions for certiorari innoncriminal matters from petitioner unless he first pays thedocketing fee required by Rule 38(a) and submits his petitionin compliance with Rule 33.1.Petitioner has a history of abusing this Court's certiorariprocess. In 1994, we invoked Rule 39.8 to deny petitionerin forma pauperis status. Brown v. Brown, 513 U. S. 1040(1994). Undeterred by this action, petitioner has continuedfiling frivolous petitions with this Court. To date, petitionerhas filed eight petitions over the last eight years, each ofwhich has been denied without recorded dissent. In the in-stant petition, Brown alleges that certain prison officials conspired to violate his constitutional rights by, inter alia, deny-ing him access to the courts and sabotaging his laundry, andthat the District Judge below was biased against him as an"African Jew." These claims are patently frivolous.We enter this order barring prospective in forma pauperis filings by petitioner for the reasons discussed in Martin v. District of Columbia Court of Appeals, 506 U. S. 1(1992) (per curiam). Because petitioner has limited hisabuse of the certiorari process to noncriminal cases, we limitour sanction accordingly.
