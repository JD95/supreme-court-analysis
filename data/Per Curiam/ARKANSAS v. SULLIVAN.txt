In November 1998, Officer Joe Taylor of the Conway,Arkansas, Police Department stopped respondent Sullivanfor speeding and for having an improperly tinted wind-shield. Taylor approached Sullivan's vehicle, explained thereason for the stop, and requested Sullivan's license, regis532US3 Unit: $U62 [09-06-02 19:14:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN770 ARKANSAS v. SULLIVANPer Curiamtration, and insurance documentation. Upon seeing Sulli-van's license, Taylor realized that he was aware of " `intelligence on [Sullivan] regarding narcotics.' " 340 Ark. 318-A,318-B, 16 S. W. 3d 551, 552 (2000). When Sullivan openedhis car door in an (unsuccessful) attempt to locate his regis-tration and insurance papers, Taylor noticed a rusted roofinghatchet on the car's floorboard. Taylor then arrested Sullivan for speeding, driving without his registration and insur-ance documentation, carrying a weapon (the roofing hatchet),and improper window tinting.After another officer arrived and placed Sullivan in hissquad car, Officer Taylor conducted an inventory search ofSullivan's vehicle pursuant to the Conway Police Department's Vehicle Inventory Policy. Under the vehicle's arm-rest, Taylor discovered a bag containing a substance thatappeared to him to be methamphetamine as well as nu-merous items of suspected drug paraphernalia. As a resultof the detention and search, Sullivan was charged with vari-ous state-law drug offenses, unlawful possession of a weapon,and speeding.Sullivan moved to suppress the evidence seized from hisvehicle on the basis that his arrest was merely a "pretextand sham to search" him and, therefore, violated the Fourthand Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Pet. for Cert. 3. The trial court granted the suppression motion and, on the State's interlocutory appeal,the Arkansas Supreme Court affirmed. 340 Ark. 315, 11S. W. 3d 526 (2000). The State petitioned for rehearing,contending that the court had erred by taking into account Officer Taylor's subjective motivation, in disregardof this Court's opinion in Whren v. United States, 517 U. S.806 (1996). Over the dissent of three justices, the court rejected the State's argument that Whren makes "the ulteriormotives of police officers . . . irrelevant so long as there isprobable cause for the traffic stop" and denied the State'srehearing petition. 340 Ark., at 318-B, 16 S.

S. 769 (2001)Per CuriamThe Arkansas Supreme Court declined to follow Whren onthe ground that "much of it isdicta." 340 Ark., at 318-B,16 S. W. 3d, at 552. The court reiterated the trial judge'sconclusion that "the arrest was pretextual and made for thepurpose of searching Sullivan's vehicle for evidence of acrime," and observed that "we do not believe thatWhrendisallows" suppression on such a basis. Id., at 318-C, 16S. W. 3d, at 552. Finally, the court asserted that, even if itwere to conclude thatWhren precludes inquiry into an arresting officer's subjective motivation, "there is nothing thatprevents this court from interpreting the U. S. Constitutionmore broadly than the United States Supreme Court, whichhas the effect of providing more rights." 340 Ark., at318-C, 16 S. W. 3d, at 552.Because the Arkansas Supreme Court's decision on rehearing is flatly contrary to this Court's controlling prece-dent, we grant the State's petition for a writ of certiorari andreverse.* As an initial matter, we note that the ArkansasSupreme Court never questioned Officer Taylor's authorityto arrest Sullivan for a fine-only traffic violation (speeding),and rightly so. See Atwater v. Lago Vista, ante, p. 318.Rather, the court affirmed the trial judge's suppression ofthe drug-related evidence on the theory that Officer Taylor'sarrest of Sullivan, although supported by probable cause,nonetheless violated the Fourth Amendment because Taylorhad an improper subjective motivation for making the stop.The Arkansas Supreme Court's holding to that effect cannotbe squared with our decision inWhren, in which we notedour "unwilling[ness] to entertain Fourth Amendment challenges based on the actual motivations of individual officers,"*Sullivan's motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis is granted.We have jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C. $ 1257 notwithstanding the absence of final judgment in the underlying prosecution. See New York v.Quarles, 467 U. S. 649, 651, n. 1 (1984) ("[S]hould the State convict respondent at trial, its claim that certain evidence was wrongfully suppressed will be moot. Should respondent be acquitted at trial, the Statewill be precluded from pressing its federal claim again on appeal").532US3 Unit: $U62 [09-06-02 19:14:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN772 ARKANSAS v. SULLIVANGinsburg, J., concurringand held unanimously that "[s]ubjective intentions play norole in ordinary, probable-cause Fourth Amendment analysis." 517 U. S., at 813. That Whren involved a traffic stop,rather than a custodial arrest, is of no particular moment;indeed, Whren itself relied on United States v. Robinson, 414U. S. 218 (1973), for the proposition that "a traffic-violationarrest . . . [will] not be rendered invalid by the fact thatit was `a mere pretext for a narcotics search.' " 517 U. S.,at 812-813.The Arkansas Supreme Court's alternative holding, thatit may interpret the United States Constitution to providegreater protection than this Court's own federal constitutional precedents provide, is foreclosed by Oregon v. Hass,420 U. S. 714 (1975). There, we observed that the OregonSupreme Court's statement that it could " `interpret theFourth Amendment more restrictively than interpreted bythe United States Supreme Court' " was "not the law andsurely must be an inadvertent error."Id., at 719, n. 4. Wereiterated inHass that while "a State is free as a matterof its own law to impose greater restrictions on police activity than those this Court holds to be necessary uponfederal constitutional standards," it "may not impose suchgreater restrictions as a matter of federal constitutional lawwhen this Court specifically refrains from imposing them."Id., at 719.The judgment of the Arkansas Supreme Court is reversed,and the case is remanded for further proceedings not incon-sistent with this opinion.
