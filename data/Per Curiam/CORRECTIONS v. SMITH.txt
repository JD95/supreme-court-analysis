At issue in this case is whether, when an Arizona SuperiorCourt denied respondent's successive petition for state postconviction relief because respondent had failed to complywith Arizona Rule of Criminal Procedure 32.2(a)(3) (West2000), the state court's ruling was independent of federal law.The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit thought not. Wegranted certiorari and certified to the Arizona SupremeCourt a question concerning the proper interpretation ofRule 32.2(a)(3). We have received a response and now reverse the Ninth Circuit's decision.IRespondent, Robert Douglas Smith, was convicted in Arizona in 1982 of first-degree murder, kidnaping, and sexualassault. He was sentenced to death on the murder countand to consecutive 21-year prison terms on the other counts.After a series of unsuccessful petitions for state postconviction relief, respondent filed a federal petition for a writ ofhabeas corpus under 28 U. S. C. $$ 2241 and 2254 in theUnited States District Court for the District of Arizona.The petition alleged, among other things, that respondent'sSixth Amendment right to counsel had been violated becausehis trial counsel had provided ineffective assistance duringthe sentencing phase of his trial.Respondent had previ ously brought this ineffectiveassistance claim in a 1995 petition for state postconvictionrelief pursuant to Ariz. Rule Crim. Proc. 32. The PimaCounty Superior Court denied the claim, finding it waivedunder Rule 32.2(a)(3) because respondent had failed to raiseit in two previous Rule 32 petitions. The state court rejected respondent's contention that his procedural defaultwas excused because his appellate and Rule 32 attorneys suffered from a conflict of interest between their responsibility536US2 Unit: $U84 [12-17-03 19:33:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN858 STEWART v. SMITHPer Curiamtoward respondent and their allegiance to the Public Defender's office, of which respondent's trial counsel was also amember.The District Court relied on the Pima County SuperiorCourt's procedural ruling on respondent's ineffectiveassistance-of-trial-counsel claim to bar federal habeas relief.Like the state court, the District Court rejected respondent's argument that his appellate and Rule 32 counsel suffered from a conflict of interest which excused his proceduraldefault. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, finding that although the state court's procedural default ruling was regularly followed and therefore adequate,see 241 F. 3d 1191, 1195, n. 2 (2001) (citing Johnson v. Mississippi, 486 U. S. 578, 587 (1988)), the ruling required consideration of the merits of respondent's claim and was thereforenot independent of federal law, see 241 F. 3d, at 1196-1197.Rule 32.2(a)(3) applies different standards for waiver depending on whether the claim asserted in a Rule 32 petitionis of "sufficient constitutional magnitude." If it is, the rulerequires that the waiver be "knowin[g], voluntar[y] and intelligen[t]," not merely omitted from previous petitions.Ariz. Rule Crim. Proc. 32.2(a)(3), comment (West 2000).The Ninth Circuit opined that, at the time the state courtruled on respondent's ineffective-assistance claim, the determination of whether a claim is of sufficient magnitude required consideration of the merits of the claim. See 241F. 3d, at 1197 (citing State v. French, 198 Ariz. 119, 121, 7P. 3d 128, 130 (App. 2000); State v. Curtis, 185 Ariz. 112,115, 912 P. 2d 1341, 1344 (App. 1995)). The Ninth Circuitconcluded that, under Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U. S. 68, 75(1985), the state court's ruling did not bar federal review ofthe merits of respondent's claim. See 241 F. 3d, at 1196-1197. We granted certiorari to review the Ninth Circuit'sdecision. 534 U. S. 157 (2001) (per curiam).536US2 Unit: $U84 [12-17-03 19:33:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN859Cite as: 536 U. S. 856 (2002)Per CuriamIIBecause we were uncertain about the proper interpreta-tion of Rule 32.2(a)(3), we certified the following question tothe Arizona Supreme Court:"At the time of respondent's third Rule 32 petition in1995, did the question whether an asserted claim was of`sufficient constitutional magnitude' to require a know-ing, voluntary, and intelligent waiver for purposes ofRule 32.2(a)(3), see Ariz. Rule Crim. Proc. 32.2(a)(3),comment (West 2000), depend upon the merits of theparticular claim, see State v. French, 198 Ariz. 119, 121-122, 7 P. 3d 128, 130-131 (App. 2000); State v. Curtis, 185Ariz. App. 112, 115, 912 P. 2d 1341, 1344 (1995), or merelyupon the particular right alleged to have been violated,see State v. Espinosa, 200 Ariz. 503, 505, 29 P. 3d 278,280 (App. 2001)?" 534 U. S., at 159.We received the following reply:"We hold that at the time of respondent's third Rule 32petition in 1995, the question whether an asserted claimwas of `sufficient constitutional magnitude' to require aknowing, voluntary and intelligent waiver for purposesof Rule 32.2(a)(3), see Comment to 32.2(a)(3), dependednot upon the merits of the particular claim, but rathermerely upon the particular right alleged to have beenviolated."Stewart v. Smith, 202 Ariz. 446, 447, 46 P. 3d1067, 1068 (2002) (en banc).The Arizona Supreme Court's reply makes clear that Rule32.2(a)(3) does not require courts to evaluate the merits ofa particular claim, but only to categorize the claim. Accord-ing to the Arizona Supreme Court, courts must evaluatewhether "at its core, [a] claim implicates a significant rightthat requires a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent waiver."Id., at 450, 46 P. 3d, at 1071. Courts need not decide the536US2 Unit: $U84 [12-17-03 19:33:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN860 STEWART v. SMITHPer Curiammerits of the claim, i. e., whether the right was actually vio-lated. They need only identify what type of claim it is, andthere is no indication that this identification is based on aninterpretation of what federal law requires. SeeDelawarev. Prouse, 440 U. S. 648, 652-653 (1979).Our cases make clear that "when resolution of [a] stateprocedural law question depends on a federal constitutionalruling, the state-law prong of the court's holding is not inde-pendent of federal law, and our [direct review] jurisdiction isnot precluded." Ake, supra, at 75. Even assuming that thesame standard governs the scope of a district court's powerto grant federal habeas relief as governs this Court's jurisdiction to review a state-court judgment on direct review,see Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 729-732, 741 (1991),Rule 32.2(a)(3) determinations are independent of federal lawbecause they do not depend upon a federal constitutionalruling on the merits. The District Court properly refusedto review respondent's ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counselclaim. The Ninth Circuit erred in holding otherwise.Even though Rule 32.2(a)(3) does not require a federal constitutional ruling on the merits, if the state court's decisionrested primarily on a ruling on the merits nevertheless, itsdecision would not be independent of federal law. TheNinth Circuit interpreted the state court's order rejectingrespondent's ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim aspossibly resting on a ruling on the merits of the claim. Therecord, however, reveals no such ruling.The state court did not even reach the merits of respondent's ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim, finding itwaived because respondent had failed to raise it in prior petitions for postconviction relief. As an excuse, respondent asserted that his prior appellate and Rule 32 counsel, who weremembers of the Arizona Public Defender's office, had refusedto file the claim because his trial counsel was also a memberof the Public Defender's office. The state court did not findthis excuse sufficient to overcome respondent's procedural536US2 Unit: $U84 [12-17-03 19:33:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN861Cite as: 536 U. S. 856 (2002)Per Curiamdefault. See App. H to Pet. for Cert. The state court ex-plained that, because deputies in the Public Defender's officerepresent their clients and not their office, respondent's ap-pellate lawyers would never have allowed "a colorable claimfor ineffective assistance of counsel" to go unstated. Id.,at 2. The Ninth Circuit read the reference to a "colorableclaim" as a conclusion that respondent's claim that his trialcounsel had rendered ineffective assistance lacked merit,that is, as a comment on the merits of respondent's underly-ing claim. 241 F. 3d, at 1197. In context, however, it isclear that the reference to "colorable claim" was used onlyas a rhetorical device for emphasizing the lack of any conflictof interest that might excuse respondent's waiver.Because the state court's determination that respondentwaived his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim underAriz. Rule Crim. Proc. 32.2(a)(3) did not require an examination of the merits of that claim, it was independent of federallaw. We voice no opinion on whether respondent has provided valid cause to overcome his procedural default in statecourt. The Ninth Circuit's judgment is reversed, and thecase is remanded for further proceedings consistent withthis opinion.
