In these two cases, two panels of the Court of Appealsfor the Ninth Circuit held that sentencing courts could notconsider conduct of the defendants underlying charges ofwhich they had been acquitted.United States v. Watts, 67F. 3d 790 (CA9 1995)(Watts); United States v. Putra, 78F. 3d 1386 (CA9 1996) (Putra). Every other Court of Appeals has held that a sentencing court may do so, if the Gov-ernment establishes that conduct by a preponderance of theevidence.1 The Government filed a single petition for cer-tiorari seeking review of both cases, pursuant to this Court'sRule 12.4, to resolve this split. Because the panels' holdingsconflict with the clear implications of 18 U. S. C. $ 3661, theSentencing Guidelines, and this Court's decisions, particu-larly Witte v. United States, 515 U. S. 389 (1995), we grantthe petition and reverse in both cases.InWatts, police discovered cocaine base in a kitchen cabi-net and two loaded guns and ammunition hidden in a bedroom closet of Watts' house.

C. $ 841(a)(1), but acquitted him of using a firearm inrelation to a drug offense, in violation of 18 U. S. C. $ 924(c).Despite Watts' acquittal on the firearms count, the DistrictCourt found by a preponderance of the evidence that Wattshad possessed the guns in connection with the drug offense.In calculating Watts' sentence, the court therefore added twopoints to his base offense level under United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual $ 2D1.1(b)(1) (Nov. 1995)(USSG). The Court of Appeals vacated the sentence, holding that "a sentencing judge may not, `under any standardof proof,' rely on facts of which the defendant was acquitted."67 F. 3d, at 797 (quoting United States v. Brady, 928 F. 2d844, 851, and n. 12 (CA9 1991), abrogated on other grounds,Nichols v. United States, 511 U. S. 738 (1994)) (emphasisadded in Watts). The Government argued that the DistrictCourt could have enhanced Watts' sentence without considering facts "necessarily rejected" by the jury's acquittal onthe $ 924(c) charge because the sentencing enhancement didnot require a connection between the firearm and the predicate offense, whereas $ 924(c) did. The court rejected thisargument, stated that both the enhancement and $ 924(c) involved such a connection, and held that the District Courthad impermissibly "reconsider[ed] facts that the jury necessarily rejected by its acquittal of the defendant on anothercount." 67 F. 3d, at 796.In Putra, authorities had videotaped two transactionsin which Putra and a codefendant (a major drug dealer)sold cocaine to a Government informant. The indictmentcharged Putra with, among other things, one count of aidingand abetting possession with intent to distribute one ounceof cocaine on May 8, 1992; and a second count of aiding andabetting possession with intent to distribute five ounces ofcocaine on May 9, 1992, both in violation of 21 U. S. C.$ 841(a)(1) and 18 U. S. C. $ 2. The jury convicted Putra onthe first count but acquitted her on the second. At sentencing, however, the District Court found by a preponderance519US1$12J 06-05-99 15:57:28 PAGES OPINPGT151Cite as: 519 U. S. 148 (1997)Per Curiamof the evidence that Putra had indeed been involved in theMay 9 transaction. The District Court explained that thesecond sale was relevant conduct under USSG $ 1B1.3, andit therefore calculated Putra's base offense level under theGuidelines by aggregating the amounts of both sales. Asin Watts, the Court of Appeals vacated and remanded forresentencing. Reasoning that the jury's verdict of acquittalmanifested an "explicit rejection" of Putra's involvement inthe May 9 transaction, the Court of Appeals held that "allowing an increase in Putra's sentence would be effectively pun-ishing her for an offense for which she has been acquitted."78 F. 3d, at 1389. The panel explained that it was imposing"a judicial limitation on the facts the district court may consider at sentencing, beyond any limitation imposed by theGuidelines." Ibid. Then-Chief Judge Wallace dissented,arguing that the panel's "sweeping language contradicts theGuidelines, our practice prior to enactment of the Guidelines,decisions of other circuits, and recent Supreme Court authority." Id., at 1390.We begin our analysis with 18 U. S. C. $ 3661, which codifies the longstanding principle that sentencing courts havebroad discretion to consider various kinds of information.The statute states:"No limitation shall be placed on the information concerning the background, character, and conduct of a per-son convicted of an offense which a court of the UnitedStates may receive and consider for the purpose of imposing an appropriate sentence."We reiterated this principle in Williams v. New York, 337U. S. 241 (1949), in which a defendant convicted of murderand sentenced to death challenged the sentencing court's reliance on information that the defendant had been involvedin 30 burglaries of which he had not been convicted. Wecontrasted the different limitations on presentation of evidence at trial and at sentencing: "Highly relevant--if not es519US1$12J 06-05-99 15:57:28 PAGES OPINPGT152 UNITED STATES v. WATTSPer Curiamsential--to [the judge's] selection of an appropriate sentenceis the possession of the fullest information possible concerning the defendant's life and characteristics." Id., at 247(footnote omitted); seeNichols, supra, at 747 (noting thatsentencing courts have traditionally and constitutionally"considered a defendant's past criminal behavior, even if noconviction resulted from that behavior") (citingWilliams,supra); BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore, 517 U. S. 559,573, n. 19 (1996) ("A sentencing judge may even consider pastcriminal behavior which did not result in a conviction") (cit-ingWilliams, supra). Neither the broad language of $ 3661nor our holding in Williams suggests any basis for the courtsto invent a blanket prohibition against considering certaintypes of evidence at sentencing. Indeed, under the preGuidelines sentencing regime, it was "well established thata sentencing judge may take into account facts introduced attrial relating to other charges, even ones of which the de-fendant has been acquitted."United States v. Donelson,695 F. 2d 583, 590 (CADC 1982) (Scalia, J.).The Guidelines did not alter this aspect of the sentencingcourt's discretion. " `[V]ery roughly speaking, [relevant con-duct] corresponds to those actions and circumstances thatcourts typically took into account when sentencing prior tothe Guidelines' enactment.' " Witte, supra, at 402 (quotingUnited States v. Wright, 873 F. 2d 437, 441 (CA1 1989)(Breyer, J.)). Section 1B1.4 of the Guidelines reflects thepolicy set forth in 18 U. S. C. $ 3661:"In determining the sentence to impose within theguideline range, or whether a departure from the guidelines is warranted, the court may consider, without limitation, any information concerning the background,character and conduct of the defendant, unless otherwise prohibited by law. See 18 U. S. C. $ 3661."Section 1B1.3, in turn, describes in sweeping language theconduct that a sentencing court may consider in determining519US1$12J 06-05-99 15:57:28 PAGES OPINPGT153Cite as: 519 U. S. 148 (1997)Per Curiamthe applicable guideline range. The commentary to thatsection states: "Conduct that is not formally charged or isnot an element of the offense of conviction may enter into thedetermination of the applicable guideline sentencing range."USSG $ 1B1.3, comment., backg'd. With respect to certainoffenses, such as Putra's drug conviction, USSG $ 1B1.3(a)(2)requires the sentencing court to consider "all acts and omissions . . . that were part of the same course of conductor common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction."Application Note 3 explains that "[a]pplication of this provi-sion does not require the defendant, in fact, to have beenconvicted of multiple counts." The Note also gives the fol-lowing example:"[W]here the defendant engaged in three drug sales of10, 15, and 20 grams of cocaine, as part of the samecourse of conduct or common scheme or plan, subsection(a)(2) provides that the total quantity of cocaine involved(45 grams) is to be used to determine the offense leveleven if the defendant is convicted of a single countcharging only one of the sales."Accordingly, the Guidelines conclude that "[r]elying on theentire range of conduct, regardless of the number of countsthat are allegedor on which a conviction is obtained,appears to be the most reasonable approach to writing workable guidelines for these offenses." USSG $ 1B1.3, com-ment., backg'd (emphasis added).Although Justice Stevens' dissent concedes that a dis-trict court may properly consider "evidence adduced in atrial that resulted in an acquittal" when choosing a particularsentence within a guideline range, it argues that the courtmust close its eyes to acquitted conduct at earlier stages ofthe sentencing process because the "broadly inclusive language of $ 3661" is incorporated only into $ 1B1.4 of theGuidelines. Post, at 162. This argument ignores $ 1B1.3which, as we have noted, directs sentencing courts to con519US1$12J 06-05-99 15:57:28 PAGES OPINPGT154 UNITED STATES v. WATTSPer Curiamsider all other related conduct, whether or not it resulted ina conviction.Justice Stevens also contends that becauseCongress instructed the Sentencing Commission, in 28U. S. C. $ 994(l), to ensure that the Guidelines provide incremental punishment for a defendant who is convicted of multiple offenses, it could not have meant for the Guidelines toincrease a sentence based on offenses of which a defendanthas been acquitted. Post, at 168. The statute is not, how-ever, "cast in restrictive or exclusive terms."United Statesv. Ebbole, 917 F. 2d 1495, 1501 (CA7 1990). Far from limit-ing a sentencing court's power to consider uncharged or acquitted conduct, $ 994(l) simply ensures that, at a minimum,the Guidelines provide additional penalties when defendantsare convicted of multiple offenses. Ibid. If we acceptedJustice Stevens' logic, $ 994(l) would prohibit a districtcourt from considering acquitted conduct for any sentencingpurposes, whether for setting the guidelines range or forchoosing a sentence within that range--a novel proposition that Justice Stevens does not defend. Post, at 162.In short, we are convinced that a sentencing court may consider conduct of which a defendant has been acquitted.The Court of Appeals' position to the contrary not onlyconflicts with the implications of the Guidelines, but it alsoseems to be based on erroneous views of our double jeopardyjurisprudence. The Court of Appeals asserted that, when asentencing court considers facts underlying a charge onwhich the jury returned a verdict of not guilty, the defendant" `suffer[s] punishment for a criminal charge for which he orshe was acquitted.' " Watts, 67 F. 3d, at 797 (quoting Brady,928 F. 2d, at 851). As we explained in Witte, however, sentencing enhancements do not punish a defendant for crimesof which he was not convicted, but rather increase his sentence because of the manner in which he committed thecrime of conviction. 515 U. S., at 402-403. In Witte, weheld that a sentencing court could, consistent with the Double Jeopardy Clause, consider uncharged cocaine importation519US1$12J 06-05-99 15:57:28 PAGES OPINPGT155Cite as: 519 U. S. 148 (1997)Per Curiamin imposing a sentence on marijuana charges that was withinthe statutory range, without precluding the defendant's subsequent prosecution for the cocaine offense. We concludedthat "consideration of information about the defendant'scharacter and conduct at sentencing does not result in `punishment' for any offense other than the one of which the defendant was convicted." Id., at 401. Rather, the defendantis "punished only for the fact that the present offense wascarried out in a manner that warrants increased punishment. . . ." Id., at 403; see also Nichols, 511 U. S., at 747.The Court of Appeals likewise misunderstood the preclusive effect of an acquittal, when it asserted that a jury " `reject[s]' " some facts when it returns a general verdict of notguilty. Putra, 78 F. 3d, at 1389 (quoting Brady, supra, at851). The Court of Appeals failed to appreciate the significance of the different standards of proof that govern at trialand sentencing. We have explained that "acquittal on criminal charges does not prove that the defendant is innocent; itmerely proves the existence of a reasonable doubt as to hisguilt." United States v. One Assortment of 89 Firearms,465 U. S. 354, 361 (1984). As then-Chief Judge Wallacepointed out in his dissent in Putra, it is impossible to knowexactly why a jury found a defendant not guilty on a certain charge."[A]n acquittal is not a finding of any fact. An acquittalcan only be an acknowledgment that the governmentfailed to prove an essential element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. Without specific jury findings, no one can logically or realistically draw any factual finding inferences . . . ." 78 F. 3d, at 1394.Thus, contrary to the Court of Appeals' assertion in Brady,supra, at 851, the jury cannot be said to have "necessarilyrejected" any facts when it returns a general verdict of notguilty.519US1$12J 06-05-99 15:57:28 PAGES OPINPGT156 UNITED STATES v. WATTSPer CuriamFor these reasons, "an acquittal in a criminal case does notpreclude the Government from relitigating an issue when itis presented in a subsequent action governed by a lowerstandard of proof." Dowling v. United States, 493 U. S. 342,349 (1990). The Guidelines state that it is "appropriate"that facts relevant to sentencing be proved by a preponder-ance of the evidence, USSG $ 6A1.3, comment., and we haveheld that application of the preponderance standard at sen-tencing generally satisfies due process.McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S. 79, 91-92 (1986); Nichols, supra, at 747-748. We acknowledge a divergence of opinion among theCircuits as to whether, in extreme circumstances, relevantconduct that would dramatically increase the sentence mustbe based on clear and convincing evidence.2 The cases be2 See McMillan, 477 U. S., at 88 (upholding use of preponderance standard where there was no allegation that the sentencing enhancement was"a tail which wags the dog of the substantive offense"); Kinder v. UnitedStates, 504 U. S. 946, 948-949 (1992) (White, J., dissenting from denial ofcertiorari) (acknowledging split); United States v. Kikumura, 918 F. 2d1084, 1102 (CA3 1990) (holding that clear-and-convincing standard is implicit in 18 U. S. C. $ 3553(b), which requires a sentencing court to "find"certain facts in order to justify certain large upward departures; notreaching the due process issue); United States v. Gigante, 39 F. 3d 42, 48(CA2 1994), as amended, 94 F. 3d 53, 56 (1996) (not reaching due processissue; "In our view, the preponderance standard is no more than a threshold basis for adjustments and departures, and the weight of the evidence,at some point along a continuum of sentence severity, should be consideredwith regard to both upward adjustments and upward departures. . . .Where a higher standard, appropriate to a substantially enhanced sentence range, is not met, the court should depart downwardly"); UnitedStates v. Lombard, 72 F. 3d 170, 186-187 (CA1 1995) (authorizing downward departure in "an unusual and perhaps a singular case" that may have"exceeded" constitutional limits, where acquitted conduct calling for an"enormous" sentence enhancement "is itself very serious conduct," "wherethe ultimate sentence is itself enormous, and where the judge is seeminglymandated to impose that sentence"); see also United States v.

S. 148 (1997)Per Curiamfore us today do not present such exceptional circumstances,and we therefore do not address that issue. We thereforehold that a jury's verdict of acquittal does not prevent thesentencing court from considering conduct underlying theacquitted charge, so long as that conduct has been proved bya preponderance of the evidence.Accordingly, the Court of Appeals erred in both cases be-fore us today. InPutra, the jury simply found that theprosecution had not proved the defendant's complicity in theMay 9 sale beyond a reasonable doubt. The acquittal shedsno light on whether a preponderance of the evidence established Putra's participation in that transaction. Likewise, inWatts, the jury acquitted the defendant of using or carryinga firearm during or in relation to the drug offense. Thatverdict does not preclude a finding by a preponderance ofthe evidence that the defendant did, in fact, use or carry sucha weapon, much less that he simply possessed the weapon inconnection with a drug offense.The petition for certiorari is granted, the judgments ofthe Court of Appeals are reversed, and the cases are re-manded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.Respondent Putra's motion to proceed in forma pauperis isgranted. The motion of Morris L. Whitman for leave to filea brief as amicus curiae is granted.
