Pro se petitioner Roy A. Day requests leave to proceed informa pauperis under Rule 39 of this Court. We deny thisrequest pursuant to Rule 39.8.

We also direct the Clerk not to acceptany further petitions for certiorari from Day in noncriminalmatters unless he pays the docketing fee required by Rule38 and submits his petition in compliance with Rule 33.Day is an abuser of this Court's certiorari process. Wefirst invoked Rule 39.8 to deny Day in forma pauperis statuslast June. SeeIn re Day, 509 U. S. 902 (1993). At that timehe had filed 27 petitions in the past nine years. AlthoughDay was grantedin forma pauperis status to file these petitions, all were denied without recorded dissent. Since wefirst denied himin forma pauperis status last June, he hasfiled eight more petitions for certiorari with this Court--allof them demonstrably frivolous.As we have recognized, "[e]very paper filed with the Clerkof this Court, no matter how repetitious or frivolous, re-quires some portion of the institution's limited resources. Apart of the Court's responsibility is to see that these re-sources are allocated in a way that promotes the interestsof justice." In re McDonald, 489 U. S. 180, 184 (1989) (percuriam). Consideration of Day's repetitious and frivolouspetitions for certiorari does not promote this end.We have entered orders similar to the present one on previous occasions to prevent pro se petitioners from filing repetitious and frivolous requests for certiorari, see Martin v.District of Columbia Court of Appeals, 506 U. S. 1 (1992)(per curiam), and repetitious and frivolous requests for extraordinary relief. See In re Sindram, 498 U. S. 177 (1991)(per curiam); In re McDonald, supra.Day's refusal to heed our earlier warning requires us totake this step. His abuse of the writ of certiorari has beenin noncriminal cases, and so we limit our sanction accordingly. The order therefore will not prevent Day from petitioning to challenge criminal sanctions which might be imposed on him. But it will free this Court's limited resourcesto consider the claims of those petitioners who have notabused our certiorari process.
