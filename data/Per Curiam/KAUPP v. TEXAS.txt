This case turns on the Fourth Amendment rule that a confession "obtained by exploitation of an illegal arrest" maynot be used against a criminal defendant.Brown v. Illinois,422 U. S. 590, 603 (1975). After a 14-year-old girl disappeared in January 1999, the Harris County Sheriff 's Department learned she had had a sexual relationship with her 19-year-old half brother, who had been in the company ofpetitioner Robert Kaupp, then 17 years old, on the day ofthe girl's disappearance. On January 26th, deputy sheriffsquestioned the brother and Kaupp at headquarters; Kauppwas cooperative and was permitted to leave, but the brother538US2 Unit: $U50 [10-27-04 14:42:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN628 KAUPP v. TEXASPer Curiamfailed a polygraph examination (his third such failure).Eventually he confessed that he had fatally stabbed his halfsister and placed her body in a drainage ditch. He impli-cated Kaupp in the crime.Detectives immediately tried but failed to obtain a war-rant to question Kaupp.1 Detective Gregory Pinkins nevertheless decided (in his words) to "get [Kaupp] in and confronthim with what [the brother] had said." App. A to Pet. forCert. 2. In the company of two other plainclothes detec-tives and three uniformed officers, Pinkins went to Kaupp'shouse at approximately 3 a.m. on January 27th. AfterKaupp's father let them in, Pinkins, with at least twoother officers, went to Kaupp's bedroom, awakened himwith a flashlight, identified himself, and said, " `we need togo and talk.' " Ibid. Kaupp said " `Okay.' " Ibid. Thetwo officers then handcuffed Kaupp and led him, shoeless anddressed only in boxer shorts and a T-shirt, out of his houseand into a patrol car. The State points to nothing in therecord indicating Kaupp was told that he was free to declineto go with the officers.They stopped for 5 or 10 minutes where the victim's bodyhad just been found, in anticipation of confronting Kauppwith the brother's confession, and then went on to the sher-iff 's headquarters. There, they took Kaupp to an interviewroom, removed his handcuffs, and advised him of his rightsunder Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966). Kaupp firstdenied any involvement in the victim's disappearance, but 101 The detectives applied to the district attorney's office for a "pocketwarrant," which they described as authority to take Kaupp into custodyfor questioning. App. 3 to App. D to Pet. for Cert. 6 (trial transcript).The detectives did not seek a conventional arrest warrant, as they did notbelieve they had probable cause for Kaupp's arrest. See ibid. As thetrial court later explained, the detectives had no evidence or motive tocorroborate the brother's allegations of Kaupp's involvement, see App. Cto Pet. for Cert. 2; the brother had previously failed three polygraph examinations, while, only two days earlier, Kaupp had voluntarily taken andpassed one, in which he denied his involvement, see id., at 1-2.538US2 Unit: $U50 [10-27-04 14:42:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN629Cite as: 538 U. S. 626 (2003)Per Curiamor 15 minutes into the interrogation, told of the brother'sconfession, he admitted having some part in the crime. Hedid not, however, acknowledge causing the fatal wound orconfess to murder, for which he was later indicted.After moving unsuccessfully to suppress his confessionas the fruit of an illegal arrest, Kaupp was convicted andsentenced to 55 years' imprisonment. The State Court ofAppeals affirmed the conviction by unpublished opinion,concluding that no arrest had occurred until after the confession. The state court said that Kaupp consented to go withthe officers when he answered " `Okay' " to Pinkins's statement that " `we need to go and talk.' " App. A to Pet. forCert. 2, 6. The court saw no contrary significance in thesubsequent handcuffing and removal to the patrol car, giventhe practice of the sheriff 's department in "routinely" usinghandcuffs for safety purposes when transporting individuals,as officers had done with Kaupp only the day before. Id.,at 6. The court observed that "a reasonable person in[Kaupp's] position would not believe that being put in handcuffs was a significant restriction on his freedom of movement." Ibid. Finally, the state court noted that Kaupp"did not resist the use of handcuffs or act in a manner consistent with anything other than full cooperation." Id., at6-7. Kaupp appealed, but the Court of Criminal Appeals ofTexas denied discretionary review. App. B to Pet. for Cert.We grant the motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis,grant the petition for certiorari, and vacate the judgmentbelow.A seizure of the person within the meaning of the Fourthand Fourteenth Amendments occurs when, "taking into account all of the circumstances surrounding the encounter, thepolice conduct would `have communicated to a reasonableperson that he was not at liberty to ignore the police presence and go about his business.' " Florida v. Bostick, 501U. S. 429, 437 (1991) (quoting Michigan v. Chesternut, 486U. S. 567, 569 (1988)). This test is derived from Justice538US2 Unit: $U50 [10-27-04 14:42:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN630 KAUPP v. TEXASPer CuriamStewart's opinion in United States v. Mendenhall, 446 U. S.544 (1980), see California v. Hodari D., 499 U. S. 621, 627-628 (1991), which gave several "[e]xamples of circumstancesthat might indicate a seizure, even where the person did notattempt to leave," including "the threatening presence ofseveral officers, the display of a weapon by an officer, somephysical touching of the person of the citizen, or the use oflanguage or tone of voice indicating that compliance with theofficer's request might be compelled." Mendenhall, supra,at 554.Although certain seizures may be justified on somethingless than probable cause, see,e. g., Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1(1968), we have never "sustained against Fourth Amendmentchallenge the involuntary removal of a suspect from his hometo a police station and his detention there for investigativepurposes . . . absent probable cause or judicial authorization."Hayes v. Florida, 470 U. S. 811, 815 (1985);2 cf. Payton v.New York, 445 U. S. 573, 589-590 (1980); compare Floridav.Royer, 460 U. S. 491, 499 (1983) (plurality opinion) ("[Thepolice] may [not] seek to verify [mere] suspicions by meansthat approach the conditions of arrest"), with United Statesv. Sokolow, 490 U. S. 1, 7 (1989) ("[T]he police can stop andbriefly detain a person for investigative purposes if the offi-cer has a reasonable suspicion supported by articulable factsthat criminal activity `may be afoot,' even if the officer lacksprobable cause" (quoting Terry, supra, at 30)). Such involuntary transport to a police station for questioning is"sufficiently like arres[t] to invoke the traditional rule thatarrests may constitutionally be made only on probablecause."Hayes, supra, at 816.The State does not claim to have had probable cause here,and a straightforward application of the test just mentionedshows beyond cavil that Kaupp was arrested within the2 We have, however, left open the possibility that, "under circumscribedprocedures," a court might validly authorize a seizure on less than probable cause when the object is fingerprinting. Hayes, 470 U. S., at 817.538US2 Unit: $U50 [10-27-04 14:42:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN631Cite as: 538 U. S. 626 (2003)Per Curiammeaning of the Fourth Amendment, there being evidence ofevery one of the probative circumstances mentioned by Justice Stewart in Mendenhall.3 A 17-year-old boy was awak-ened in his bedroom at three in the morning by at least threepolice officers, one of whom stated " `we need to go andtalk.' " He was taken out in handcuffs, without shoes,dressed only in his underwear in January, placed in a patrolcar, driven to the scene of a crime and then to the sher-iff 's offices, where he was taken into an interrogation roomand questioned. This evidence points to arrest even morestarkly than the facts inDunaway v. New York, 442 U. S.200, 212 (1979), where the petitioner "was taken from aneighbor's home to a police car, transported to a police station, and placed in an interrogation room." There we heldit clear that the detention was "in important respects indistinguishable from a traditional arrest" and therefore re-quired probable cause or judicial authorization to be legal.Ibid. The same is, if anything, even clearer here.Contrary reasons mentioned by the state courts are noanswer to the facts. Kaupp's " `Okay' " in response to Pinkins's statement is no showing of consent under the circumstances. Pinkins offered Kaupp no choice, and a group ofpolice officers rousing an adolescent out of bed in the middleof the night with the words " `we need to go and talk' " presents no option but "to go." There is no reason to thinkKaupp's answer was anything more than "a mere submissionto a claim of lawful authority." Royer, supra, at 497 (plurality opinion); see also Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U. S.218, 226, 233-234 (1973). If reasonable doubt were possible3 On the record before us, it is possible to debate whether the law enforcement officers were armed. The State Court of Appeals not only described them as armed but said specifically that Pinkins's weapon wasvisible, though not drawn, when he confronted Kaupp in the bedroom.See App. A to Pet. for Cert. 6. But at least one officer testified beforethe trial court that they went to Kaupp's house unarmed. See App. 3 toApp. D to Pet. for Cert. 8 (trial transcript).538US2 Unit: $U50 [10-27-04 14:42:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN632 KAUPP v. TEXASPer Curiamon this point, the ensuing events would resolve it: removalfrom one's house in handcuffs on a January night with nothing on but underwear for a trip to a crime scene on the wayto an interview room at law enforcement headquarters.Even "an initially consensual encounter . . . can be trans-formed into a seizure or detention within the meaning of theFourth Amendment." INS v. Delgado, 466 U. S. 210, 215(1984); see Hayes, supra, at 815-816 ("[A]t some point in theinvestigative process, police procedures can qualitatively andquantitatively be so intrusive with respect to a suspect'sfreedom of movement and privacy interests as to trigger thefull protection of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments").It cannot seriously be suggested that when the detectivesbegan to question Kaupp, a reasonable person in his situationwould have thought he was sitting in the interview roomas a matter of choice, free to change his mind and go hometo bed.Nor is it significant, as the state court thought, that thesheriff 's department "routinely" transported individuals, including Kaupp on one prior occasion, while handcuffed forsafety of the officers, or that Kaupp "did not resist the useof handcuffs or act in a manner consistent with anythingother than full cooperation." App. A to Pet. for Cert. 6.The test is an objective one, see, e. g., Chesternut, 486U. S., at 574, and stressing the officers' motivation of selfprotection does not speak to how their actions would reasonably be understood. As for the lack of resistance, failureto struggle with a cohort of deputy sheriffs is not a waiverof Fourth Amendment protection, which does not require theperversity of resisting arrest or assaulting a police officer.Since Kaupp was arrested before he was questioned, andbecause the State does not even claim that the sheriff 's department had probable cause to detain him at that point,well-established precedent requires suppression of the confession unless that confession was "an act of free will [sufficient] to purge the primary taint of the unlawful invasion."538US2 Unit: $U50 [10-27-04 14:42:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN633Cite as: 538 U. S. 626 (2003)Per CuriamWong Sun v. United States, 371 U. S. 471, 486 (1963). Dem-onstrating such purgation is, of course, a function of circumstantial evidence, with the burden of persuasion on the State.SeeBrown, 422 U. S., at 604. Relevant considerations include observance of Miranda, "[t]he temporal proximity ofthe arrest and the confession, the presence of interveningcircumstances, and, particularly, the purpose and flagrancyof the official misconduct." 422 U. S., at 603-604 (footnotesand citation omitted).The record before us shows that only one of these consid-erations, the giving ofMiranda warnings, supports theState, and we held in Brown that "Miranda warnings, aloneand per se, cannot always . . . break, for Fourth Amendmentpurposes, the causal connection between the illegality andthe confession." 422 U. S., at 603 (emphasis in original); seealso Taylor v. Alabama, 457 U. S. 687, 699 (1982) (O'Connor,J., dissenting) (noting that, although Miranda warnings arean important factor, "they are, standing alone, insufficient").All other factors point the opposite way. There is no indication from the record that any substantial time passed between Kaupp's removal from his home in handcuffs and hisconfession after only 10 or 15 minutes of interrogation. Inthe interim, he remained in his partially clothed state in thephysical custody of a number of officers, some of whom, atleast, were conscious that they lacked probable cause to arrest. See Brown, supra, at 604-605. In fact, the State hasnot even alleged "any meaningful intervening event" between the illegal arrest and Kaupp's confession. Taylor,supra, at 691. Unless, on remand, the State can point totestimony undisclosed on the record before us, and weightyenough to carry the State's burden despite the clear force ofthe evidence shown here, the confession must be suppressed.The judgment of the State Court of Appeals is vacated,and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
