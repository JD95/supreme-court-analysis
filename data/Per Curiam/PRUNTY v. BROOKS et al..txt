Pro se petitioner Prunty seeks leave to proceed in formapauperis under Rule 39 of this Court. We deny this requestas frivolous pursuant to Rule 39.8. Prunty is allowed untilNovember 2, 1999, within which to pay the docketing feesrequired by Rule 38 and to submit his petition in compliancewith this Court's Rule 33.1. We also direct the Clerk not toaccept any further petitions for certiorari from Prunty innoncriminal matters unless he first pays the docketing feerequired by Rule 38 and submits his petitions in compliancewith Rule 33.1.Prunty has abused this Court's certiorari process. OnApril 19, 1999, we invoked Rule 39.8 to deny Pruntyinforma pauperis status with respect to a petition for certiorari. See Prunty v. Holschuh, 526 U. S. 1063. At thattime, Prunty had filed eight petitions for certiorari, all ofwhich were both frivolous and had been denied without re-corded dissent. The instant petition for certiorari thusbrings Prunty's total number of frivolous filings to 10.We enter the order barring prospective filings for the reasons discussed in Martin v. District of Columbia Court ofAppeals, 506 U. S. 1 (1992) (per curiam). Prunty's abuse ofthe writ of certiorari has been in noncriminal cases, and welimit our sanction accordingly. The order therefore will not528US1 Unit: $$U5 [08-17-00 07:59:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN10 PRUNTY v.
