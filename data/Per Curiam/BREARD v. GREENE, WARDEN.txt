S. 371 (1998)Per Curiamage of 20. In 1992, Breard was charged with the attemptedrape and capital murder of Ruth Dickie. At his trial in 1993,the State presented overwhelming evidence of guilt, including semen found on Dickie's body matching Breard's DNAprofile and hairs on Dickie's body identical in all microscopiccharacteristics to hair samples taken from Breard. Breardchose to take the witness stand in his defense. During histestimony, Breard confessed to killing Dickie, but explainedthat he had only done so because of a Satanic curse placedon him by his father-in-law. Following a jury trial in theCircuit Court of Arlington County, Virginia, Breard was convicted of both charges and sentenced to death. On appeal,the Virginia Supreme Court affirmed Breard's convictionsand sentences, Breard v. Commonwealth, 248 Va. 68, 445S. E. 2d 670 (1994), and we denied certiorari, 513 U. S. 971(1994). State collateral relief was subsequently denied aswell.Breard then filed a motion for habeas relief under 28U. S. C. $ 2254 in Federal District Court on August 20, 1996.In that motion, Breard argued for the first time that his convictions and sentences should be overturned because of alleged violations of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (Vienna Convention), April 24, 1963, [1970] 21 U. S. T.77, T. I. A. S. No. 6820, at the time of his arrest. Specifically,Breard alleged that the Vienna Convention was violatedwhen the arresting authorities failed to inform him that, as aforeign national, he had the right to contact the ParaguayanConsulate. The District Court rejected this claim, concluding that Breard procedurally defaulted the claim when hefailed to raise it in state court and that Breard could notdemonstrate cause and prejudice for this default. Breard v.Netherland, 949 F. Supp. 1255, 1266 (ED Va. 1996). TheFourth Circuit affirmed. Breard v. Pruett, 134 F. 3d 615,620 (1998). Breard has petitioned this Court for a writ ofcertiorari.523US2 Unit: $U49 [04-29-00 17:17:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN374 BREARD v. GREENEPer CuriamIn September 1996, the Republic of Paraguay, the Ambas-sador of Paraguay to the United States, and the Consul General of Paraguay to the United States (collectively Paraguay)brought suit in Federal District Court against certain Virginia officials, alleging that their separate rights under theVienna Convention had been violated by the Common-wealth's failure to inform Breard of his rights under thetreaty and to inform the Paraguayan Consulate of Breard'sarrest, convictions, and sentences. In addition, the ConsulGeneral asserted a parallel claim under Rev. Stat. $ 1979,42 U. S. C. $ 1983, alleging a denial of his rights under theVienna Convention. The District Court concluded that itlacked subject-matter jurisdiction over these suits becauseParaguay was not alleging a "continuing violation of federallaw" and therefore could not bring its claims within theexception to Eleventh Amendment immunity established inEx parte Young, 209 U. S. 123 (1908). Republic of Paraguayv. Allen, 949 F. Supp. 1269, 1272-1273 (ED Va. 1996). TheFourth Circuit affirmed on Eleventh Amendment grounds.Republic of Paraguay v. Allen, 134 F. 3d 622 (1998). Paraguay has also petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari.On April 3, 1998, nearly five years after Breard's convictions became final, the Republic of Paraguay institutedproceedings against the United States in the InternationalCourt of Justice (ICJ), alleging that the United States violated the Vienna Convention at the time of Breard's arrest.On April 9, the ICJ noted jurisdiction and issued an orderrequesting that the United States "take all measures at itsdisposal to ensure that Angel Francisco Breard is not executed pending the final decision in these proceedings . . . ."The ICJ set a briefing schedule for this matter, with oralargument likely to be held this November. Breard thenfiled a petition for an original writ of habeas corpus and astay application in this Court in order to "enforce" the ICJ'sorder. Paraguay filed a motion for leave to file a bill of complaint in this Court, citing this Court's original jurisdiction523US2 Unit: $U49 [04-29-00 17:17:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN375Cite as: 523 U. S. 371 (1998)Per Curiamover cases "affecting Ambassadors . . . and Consuls." U. S.Const., Art. III, $ 2.It is clear that Breard procedurally defaulted his claim, ifany, under the Vienna Convention by failing to raise thatclaim in the state courts. Nevertheless, in their petitionsfor certiorari, both Breard and Paraguay contend thatBreard's Vienna Convention claim may be heard in federal court because the Convention is the "supreme law ofthe land" and thus trumps the procedural default doctrine.Pet. for Cert. in No. 97-8214, pp. 15-18; Pet. for Cert. inNo. 97-1390, p. 14, n. 8. This argument is plainly incorrectfor two reasons.First, while we should give respectful consideration to theinterpretation of an international treaty rendered by an international court with jurisdiction to interpret such, it hasbeen recognized in international law that, absent a clear andexpress statement to the contrary, the procedural rules ofthe forum State govern the implementation of the treaty inthat State. See Sun Oil Co. v. Wortman, 486 U. S. 717, 723(1988); Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft v. Schlunk, 486U. S. 694, 700 (1988); Socie'te' Nationale Industrielle Ae'rospatiale v. United States Dist. Court for Southern Dist. ofIowa, 482 U. S. 522, 539 (1987). This proposition is embodied in the Vienna Convention itself, which provides that therights expressed in the Convention "shall be exercised inconformity with the laws and regulations of the receivingState," provided that "said laws and regulations must enablefull effect to be given to the purposes for which the rightsaccorded under this Article are intended." Article 36(2),[1970] 21 U. S. T., at 101. It is the rule in this country thatassertions of error in criminal proceedings must first beraised in state court in order to form the basis for relief inhabeas. Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72 (1977). Claimsnot so raised are considered defaulted. Ibid. By not asserting his Vienna Convention claim in state court, Breardfailed to exercise his rights under the Vienna Convention523US2 Unit: $U49 [04-29-00 17:17:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN376 BREARD v. GREENEPer Curiamin conformity with the laws of the United States and theCommonwealth of Virginia. Having failed to do so, he cannot raise a claim of violation of those rights now on federalhabeas review.Second, although treaties are recognized by our Constitution as the supreme law of the land, that status is no lesstrue of provisions of the Constitution itself, to which rulesof procedural default apply. We have held "that an Act ofCongress . . . is on a full parity with a treaty, and that whena statute which is subsequent in time is inconsistent with atreaty, the statute to the extent of conflict renders the treatynull." Reid v. Covert, 354 U. S. 1, 18 (1957) (plurality opinion); see also Whitney v. Robertson, 124 U. S. 190, 194 (1888)(holding that if a treaty and a federal statute conflict, "theone last in date will control the other"). The Vienna Convention--which arguably confers on an individual the rightto consular assistance following arrest--has continuouslybeen in effect since 1969. But in 1996, before Breard filedhis habeas petition raising claims under the Vienna Convention, Congress enacted the Antiterrorism and EffectiveDeath Penalty Act (AEDPA), which provides that a habeaspetitioner alleging that he is held in violation of "treatiesof the United States" will, as a general rule, not be affordedan evidentiary hearing if he "has failed to develop the factual basis of [the] claim in State court proceedings." 28U. S. C. $$ 2254(a), (e)(2) (1994 ed., Supp. IV). Breard's ability to obtain relief based on violations of the Vienna Convention is subject to this subsequently enacted rule, just as anyclaim arising under the United States Constitution would be.This rule prevents Breard from establishing that the violation of his Vienna Convention rights prejudiced him. Without a hearing, Breard cannot establish how the Consul wouldhave advised him, how the advice of his attorneys differedfrom the advice the Consul could have provided, and whatfactors he considered in electing to reject the plea bargainthat the State offered him. That limitation, Breard also ar523US2 Unit: $U49 [04-29-00 17:17:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN377Cite as: 523 U. S. 371 (1998)Per Curiamgues, is not justified because his Vienna Convention claimswere so novel that he could not have discovered them anyearlier. Assuming that were true, such novel claims wouldbe barred on habeas review underTeague v. Lane, 489 U. S.288 (1989).Even were Breard's Vienna Convention claim properlyraised and proved, it is extremely doubtful that the violationshould result in the overturning of a final judgment of con-viction without some showing that the violation had an effecton the trial. Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U. S. 279 (1991).In this action, no such showing could even arguably bemade. Breard decided not to plead guilty and to testify athis own trial contrary to the advice of his attorneys, whowere likely far better able to explain the United States legalsystem to him than any consular official would have been.Breard's asserted prejudice--that had the Vienna Convention been followed, he would have accepted the State's offerto forgo the death penalty in return for a plea of guilty--is far more speculative than the claims of prejudice courtsroutinely reject in those cases where an inmate alleges thathis plea of guilty was infected by attorney error. See, e. g.,Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U. S. 52, 59 (1985).As for Paraguay's suits (both the original action and thecase coming to us on petition for certiorari), neither the textnor the history of the Vienna Convention clearly provides aforeign nation a private right of action in United Statescourts to set aside a criminal conviction and sentence forviolation of consular notification provisions. The EleventhAmendment provides a separate reason why Paraguay's suitmight not succeed. That Amendment's "fundamental principle" that "the States, in the absence of consent, are immunefrom suits brought against them . . . by a foreign State" wasenunciated in Principality of Monaco v. Mississippi, 292U. S. 313, 329-330 (1934). Though Paraguay claims that itssuit is within an exemption dealing with continuing consequences of past violations of federal rights, see Milliken v.523US2 Unit: $U49 [04-29-00 17:17:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN378 BREARD v. GREENEPer CuriamBradley, 433 U. S. 267 (1977), we do not agree. The failureto notify the Paraguayan Consul occurred long ago and hasno continuing effect. The causal link present in Milliken isabsent in this suit.Insofar as the Consul General seeks to base his claims on$ 1983, his suit is not cognizable. Section 1983 provides acause of action to any "person within the jurisdiction" of theUnited States for the deprivation "of any rights, privileges,or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws." Asan initial matter, it is clear that Paraguay is not authorizedto bring suit under $ 1983. Paraguay is not a "person" asthat term is used in $ 1983. See Moor v. County of Alameda, 411 U. S. 693, 699 (1973); South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U. S. 301, 323-324 (1966); cf. Will v. Michigan Dept.of State Police, 491 U. S. 58 (1989). Nor is Paraguay "withinthe jurisdiction" of the United States. And since the ConsulGeneral is acting only in his official capacity, he has nogreater ability to proceed under $ 1983 than does the countryhe represents. Any rights that the Consul General mighthave by virtue of the Vienna Convention exist for the benefitof Paraguay, not for him as an individual.It is unfortunate that this matter comes before us whileproceedings are pending before the ICJ that might havebeen brought to that court earlier. Nonetheless, this Courtmust decide questions presented to it on the basis of law.The Executive Branch, on the other hand, in exercising itsauthority over foreign relations may, and in this case did,utilize diplomatic discussion with Paraguay. Last night theSecretary of State sent a letter to the Governor of Virginiarequesting that he stay Breard's execution. If the Governorwishes to wait for the decision of the ICJ, that is his prerogative. But nothing in our existing case law allows us to makethat choice for him.For the foregoing reasons, we deny the petition for anoriginal writ of habeas corpus, the motion for leave to file a523US2 Unit: $U49 [04-29-00 17:17:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN379Cite as: 523 U. S. 371 (1998)Stevens, J., dissentingbill of complaint, the petitions for certiorari, and the accom-panying stay applications filed by Breard and Paraguay.Statement of Justice Souter.I agree with the Court that the lack of any reasonablyarguable causal connection between the alleged treaty violations and Breard's convictions and sentences disentitle himto relief on any theory offered. Moreover, I have substan-tial doubts that either Paraguay or any official acting for itis a "person" within the meaning of 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 andthat the Vienna Convention is enforceable in any judicial proceeding now underway. For these reasons, I believe thestay requests should be denied, with the result that Paraguay's claims will be mooted. Accordingly, I have voted todeny Paraguay's and Breard's respective petitions for certiorari (Nos. 97-1390 and 97-8214), Paraguay's motion for leaveto file a bill of complaint (No. 125, Orig.), Breard's applicationfor an original writ of habeas corpus (No. 97-8660), and theassociated requests for a stay of execution.Justice Stevens, dissenting.The Court of Appeals' decision denying petitioner Breard'sfirst application for a federal writ of habeas corpus becamefinal on February 18, 1998. Under this Court's Rules, atimely petition for a writ of certiorari to review that decisioncould have been filed as late as May 19, 1998. See Rule 13.1("[A] petition for a writ of certiorari to review a judgmentin any case, civil or criminal, entered by . . . a United Statescourt of appeals . . . is timely when it is filed with the Clerkof this Court within 90 days after entry of the judgment").Ordinary review of that petition pursuant to our Rules wouldhave given us additional time thereafter to consider its merits in the light of the response filed by the Commonwealth ofVirginia. We have, however, been deprived of the normaltime for considered deliberation by the Commonwealth'sdecision to set the date of petitioner's execution for today.523US2 Unit: $U49 [04-29-00 17:17:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN380 BREARD v. GREENEBreyer, J., dissentingThere is no compelling reason for refusing to follow the pro-cedures that we have adopted for the orderly disposition ofnoncapital cases. Indeed, the international aspects of thiscase provide an additional reason for adhering to our established Rules and procedures. I would therefore grant theapplications for a stay, and I respectfully dissent from thedecision to act hastily rather than with the deliberation thatis appropriate in a case of this character.Justice Ginsburg, dissenting in No. 97-8214 (A-732).I would grant the application for a stay of execution inorder to consider in the ordinary course the instant petition,Breard's first federal petition for writ of habeas corpus.Justice Breyer, dissenting.In my view, several of the issues raised here are ofsufficient difficulty to warrant less speedy consideration.Breard argues, for example, that the novelty of his ViennaConvention claim is sufficient to create "cause" for his havingfailed to present that claim to the Virginia state courts.Pet. for Cert. in No. 97-8214, pp. 20-22. He might add thatthe nature of his claim, were we to accept it, is such as tocreate a "watershed rule of criminal procedure," whichmight overcome the bar to consideration otherwise posedby Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288, 311 (1989). He additionallysays that what the Solicitor General describes as Virginia'sviolation of the Convention "prejudiced" him by isolatinghim at a critical moment from Consular Officials who mighthave advised him to try to avoid the death penalty by pleading guilty. Pet. for Cert. in No. 97-8214, p. 22; see Brieffor United States as Amicus Curiae in Nos. 97-1390 and97-8214, p. 12 ("[T]he Executive Branch has conceded thatthe Vienna Convention was violated"). I cannot say, without examining the record more fully, that these argumentsare obviously without merit. Nor am I willing to acceptwithout fuller briefing and consideration the positions taken523US2 Unit: $U49 [04-29-00 17:17:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN381Cite as: 523 U.

More time would likelymean additional briefing and argument, perhaps, for example, on the potential relevance of proceedings in an interna-tional forum.Finally, as Justice Stevens points out, Virginia is nowpursuing an execution schedule that leaves less time for argument and for Court consideration than the Court's Rulesprovide for ordinary cases. LikeJustice Stevens, I canfind no special reason here to truncate the period of timethat the Court's Rules would otherwise make available.For these reasons, taken together, I would grant therequested stay of execution and consider the petitions forcertiorari in the ordinary course.523US2 Unit: $U50 [04-29-00 17:19:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN382 OCTOBER TERM, 1997SyllabusATLANTIC MUTUAL INSURANCE CO. v. COMMIS-SIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUEcertiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe third circuitNo. 97-147. Argued March 2, 1998--Decided April 21, 1998Before enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the Internal RevenueCode gave property and casualty (PC) insurers a full deduction for "lossreserves": estimated amounts of losses reported but not yet paid, lossesincurred but not yet reported, and administrative costs of resolvingclaims. In each taxable year, not only losses paid, but the full amountof the loss reserves, reduced by the amount of the loss reserves claimedfor the prior taxable year, were treated as a business expense. Section1023 of the 1986 Act required PC insurers, beginning with the 1987taxable year, to discount unpaid losses to present value when claimingthem as a deduction. Requiring insurers to subtract undiscountedyear-end 1986 reserves from discounted year-end 1987 reserves in computing 1987 losses would produce artificially low deductions, so the Actincluded a transitional rule requiring insurers to discount 1986 reservesas well. This rule changed the "method of accounting" for computingtaxable income. To avoid requiring PC insurers to recognize as incomethe difference between undiscounted and discounted year-end 1986 lossreserves, the Act afforded them a "fresh start," to wit, an exclusion fromtaxable income of the difference between undiscounted and discountedyear-end 1986 loss reserves. $ 1023(e)(3)(A). It foreclosed the possibility that they would inflate reserves to manipulate the "fresh start" byexcepting "reserve strengthening" from the exclusion. $ 1023(e)(3)(B).Treasury Regulation $ 1.846-3(c)(3)(ii) defines "reserve strengthening"to include any net additions to reserves. Respondent Commissionerdetermined that petitioner, Atlantic Mutual Insurance Co., and its subsidiary, a PC insurer, made net additions to loss reserves in 1986, reducing the "fresh start" entitlement and resulting in a tax deficiency. TheTax Court disagreed, holding that "reserve strengthening" refers toonly those increases that result from changes in computation methodsor assumptions. In reversing, the Third Circuit concluded that theTreasury Regulation's definition of "reserve strengthening" is based ona permissible statutory construction.Held: The Treasury Regulation represents a reasonable interpretationof the term "reserve strengthening." Neither prior legislation nor industry use establishes the plain meaning Atlantic ascribes to that term:523US2 Unit: $U50 [04-29-00 17:19:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN383Cite as: 523 U. S. 382 (1998)Opinion of the Courtreserve increases attributable to changes in methods or assumptions.Since the term is ambiguous, the question is not whether the Treasury Regulation represents the best interpretation of the statute, butwhether it represents a reasonable one. See Cottage Savings Assn. v.Commissioner, 499 U. S. 554, 560-561. As a purely linguistic matter,the phrase is broad enough to embrace all increases in the reserve'samount, for whatever reason and from whatever source. The provisionat issue is a limitation upon an extraordinary deduction accorded to PCinsurers. There was no need for the deduction to be microscopicallyfair, and the interpretation adopted in the Treasury Regulation seemsto be a reasonable accommodation of the competing interests of fairness, administrability, and avoidance of abuse. Given the hundreds(or more likely thousands) of claims involved, claims resolved for lessthan estimated reserves will tend to offset claims that settle for morethan estimated reserves. Any discrepancy would not approach the unrealistic proportions claimed by Atlantic. Pp. 387-391.111 F. 3d 1056, affirmed.Scalia, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.George R.

COMMISSIONEROpinion of the Courtserves, or only increases that result from changes in themethods or assumptions used to compute them.IAtlantic Mutual Insurance Co. is the common parent of anaffiliated group of corporations, including Centennial Insurance Co., a property and casualty (PC) insurer. From 1985to 1993, the two corporations (Atlantic) maintained what insurers call "loss reserves." Loss reserves are estimates ofamounts insurers will have to pay for losses that have beenreported but not yet paid, for losses that have been incurredbut not yet reported, and for administrative costs of resolving claims.Before enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, Pub. L.99-514, 100 Stat. 2085, the Internal Revenue Code gave PCinsurers a full deduction for loss reserves as "losses incurred." In each taxable year, not only losses paid, but thefull amount of the loss reserves, reduced by the amount ofthe loss reserves claimed for the prior taxable year, wouldbe treated as a business expense. 26 U. S. C. $$ 832(b)(5)and (c)(4) (1982 ed.). This designation enabled the PC in-surer to take, in effect, a current deduction for future losspayments without adjusting for the "time value of money"--the fact that " `[a] dollar today is worth more than a dollartomorrow,' " D. Herwitz & M. Barrett, Accounting for Law-yers 221 (2d ed. 1997). Section 1023 of the 1986 Actamended the Code to require PC insurers, for taxable yearsbeginning after December 31, 1986, to discount unpaid lossesto present value when claiming them as a deduction. 100Stat. 2399, 2404, 26 U. S. C. $$ 832(b)(5)(A), 846 (1982 ed.,Supp. V). Absent a transitional rule, PC insurers wouldhave been left to subtract undiscounted year-end 1986 reserves from discounted year-end 1987 reserves for purposesof computing losses incurred for taxable year 1987--producing artificially low deductions. The 1986 Act softened thisconsequence by requiring PC insurers, for purposes of that523US2 Unit: $U50 [04-29-00 17:19:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN385Cite as: 523 U.

C. $ 846.Because the requirement that PC insurers discount 1986reserves changed the "method of accounting" for computingtaxable income, PC insurers, absent another transitionalrule, would have been required to recognize as income thedifference between undiscounted and discounted year-end1986 loss reserves. See 26 U. S. C. $ 481(a) (1988 ed.). Toavoid this consequence, $ 1023(e)(3)(A) of the 1986 Act afforded PC insurers a "fresh start," to wit, an exclusion fromtaxable income of the difference between undiscounted anddiscounted year-end 1986 loss reserves. 100 Stat. 2404, notefollowing 26 U.

"Reserve strengthening," theTax Court held, refers only to increases in reserves that result from changes in the methods or assumptions used tocompute them. (Atlantic's reserve increases, there is nodispute, did not result from any such change.) The UnitedStates Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed theTax Court, concluding that the Treasury Regulation's defini523US2 Unit: $U50 [04-29-00 17:19:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN387Cite as: 523 U.

We granted certiorari.522 U. S. 931 (1997).IIThe 1986 Act does not define "reserve strengthening."Atlantic contends that the term has a plain meaning underthe statute: reserve increases attributable to changes inmethods or assumptions. If that is what the term plainlymeans, Atlantic must prevail, "for the court, as well as theagency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressedintent of Congress." Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842-843 (1984).Atlantic contends that the plain meaning of "reservestrengthening" can be discerned, first, from its use in the PCinsurance industry. It presented at trial two expert reportswhich, by "constructing a working definition of the term"that requires "a material change in methodology and/or assumptions," App. 68, 74, purport to demonstrate that Atlantic "did not strengthen reserves," id., at 99. Our task, ofcourse, is to determine not what the term ought to mean,but what it does mean. Atlantic's first expert, before "constructing" a definition, expressly acknowledged that "reserve strengthening" is "not a well-defined PC insurance oractuarial term of art to be found in PC actuarial, accounting,or insurance regulatory literature." Id., at 60. On thispoint she was in agreement with the Commissioner's experts: "In the property-casualty industry the term `reservestrengthening' has various meanings, rather than a singleuniversal meaning," id., at 124. If the expert reports establish anything, it is that "reserve strengthening" does nothave an established meaning in the PC insurance industry.523US2 Unit: $U50 [04-29-00 17:19:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN388 ATLANTIC MUT. INS. CO. v. COMMISSIONEROpinion of the CourtAtlantic next contends that a plain meaning can be discerned from prior use of the term in life insurance tax legislation. According to Atlantic, the term has its roots in theLife Insurance Company Income Tax Act of 1959, which provided tax consequences for changes in the "basis" for determining life insurance reserves. 73 Stat. 125, 26 U. S. C.$ 810(d) (1958 ed., Supp. I). But that provision does not define, or for that matter even use, the term "reserve strengthening." Though the regulation that implemented the provision uses the term "reserve strengthening" in a caption,Treas. Reg. $ 1.810-3(a), 26 CFR $ 1.810-3(a) (1997), its textdoes not mention the term, and one of its Examples speaksonly of "reserve strengthening attributable to the change inbasis which occurred in 1959," $ 1.810-3(b), Ex. 2. If, as Atlantic argues, "basis" and "assumptions or methodologies"are interchangeable terms, Brief for Petitioner 17, n. 8, anda change in basis is necessary for "reserve strengthening,"it is redundant to say "reserve strengthening attributable tothe change in basis which occurred in 1959," much as it wouldbe to say "a sunburn attributable to the sun in 1959." OnAtlantic's assumptions, the more natural formulation wouldhave been simply "reserve strengthening in 1959." Thus,the 1959 Act and implementing regulation suggest, if anything, that a change in basis is a sufficient, but not a necessary, condition for "reserve strengthening."Atlantic further contends that the term "reserve strengthening" draws a plain meaning from a provision of the TaxReform Act of 1984 that accorded a "fresh start" adjustmentto life insurance reserves. Div. A, 98 Stat. 758, note following 26 U. S. C. $ 801 (1984 Act). That provision, like the"fresh start" adjustment for PC insurers in the 1986 Act,said that the "fresh start" would not apply to reservestrengthening, specifically, "to any reserve strengthening reported for Federal income tax purposes after September 27,1983, for a taxable year ending before January 1, 1984." 98523US2 Unit: $U50 [04-29-00 17:19:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN389Cite as: 523 U. S. 382 (1998)Opinion of the CourtStat. 759. Unlike the 1986 Act, however, the 1984 Act ex-pressly provided that "reserve strengthening" would not beexcluded from the "fresh start" if the insurer "employs thereserve practice used for purposes of the most recent annualstatement filed before September 27, 1983 . . . ." Ibid. If,as Atlantic contends, reserve strengthening encompassesonly reserve increases that result from a change in reservepractices (viz., change in methods or assumptions), the saving clause is superfluous. Thus, to the extent the definitionof "reserve strengthening" in the life insurance context isrelevant to its meaning here (which is questionable, see 111F. 3d, at 1061-1062), the 1984 Act, like the regulations underthe 1959 Act, tends to contradict, rather than support, pe-titioner's interpretation. We conclude that neither priorlegislation nor industry use establishes the plain meaningAtlantic ascribes to "reserve strengthening."IIISince the term "reserve strengthening" is ambiguous, thetask that confronts us is to decide, not whether the TreasuryRegulation represents the best interpretation of the stat-ute, but whether it represents a reasonable one. See Cottage Savings Assn. v. Commissioner, 499 U. S. 554, 560-561(1991). We conclude that it does.As a purely linguistic matter, the phrase is certainly broadenough to embraceall increases in (all "strengthening of ")the amount of the reserve, for whatever reason and fromwhatever source. Atlantic contends that this interpretationis unreasonable because, in theory, it produces absurd results, as the following example supposedly illustrates: As-sume that in 1985 a PC insurer had four case reserves of$500 each (total reserves of $2,000). If two cases settled in1986 for $750 each ($1,500 total), the remaining loss reservewould be $1,000. Under the regulation, according to Atlantic, the Commissioner would find "reserve strengthening" of523US2 Unit: $U50 [04-29-00 17:19:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN390 ATLANTIC MUT. INS. CO. v. COMMISSIONEROpinion of the Court$500 (1986 loss reserves ($1,000) less (first year reserves($2,000) less second year payments ($1,500))), even thoughreserves did not increase. The Commissioner denies thisconsequence, contending that under the stipulation in thiscase the increase in the reserve would be "reduced to zero"by an offsetting adjustment when the payment is made, andthat adjustments in the IBNR reserve (reserve for claims"incurred but not reported") may result from payments inexcess of prior reserve amounts, offsetting changes in otherreserves. Brief for Respondent 36-39.We need not resolve that dispute, because we agree withthe Commissioner that Atlantic's horrific example is in anyevent unrealistic. The property and casualty insurer thathad only four cases would not be in business very long, withor without the benefit of the tax adjustment--or if he would,his talents could be put to better use in Las Vegas. Thewhole point of the insurance business is to spread the insuredrisk over a large number of cases, where experience and thelaw of probabilities can be relied upon. And where hundreds (or more likely thousands) of claims are involved,claims resolved for less than estimated reserves will tend tooffset claims that settle for more than estimated reserves.See Notice of Proposed Rulemaking Discounted UnpaidLosses, FI-139-86, 1991-2 Cum. Bull. 946, 947 ("For mostunpaid loss reserves . . . any potential inaccuracies are likelyto offset each other in the aggregate"). There may, to besure, be some discrepancy in one direction or the other, butit would not approach the relative proportions claimed byAtlantic.It should be borne in mind that the provision at issue hereis a limitation upon an extraordinary deduction accorded toPC insurers. There was certainly no need for that deduction to be microscopically fair, and the interpretationadopted by the Treasury Regulation seems to us a reasonable accommodation--and one that the statute very likely523US2 Unit: $U50 [04-29-00 17:19:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN391Cite as: 523 U. S. 382 (1998)Opinion of the Courtintended--of the competing interests of fairness, administra-bility, and avoidance of abuse.* * *Because the Treasury Regulation represents a reason-able interpretation of the term "reserve strengthening,"we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.
