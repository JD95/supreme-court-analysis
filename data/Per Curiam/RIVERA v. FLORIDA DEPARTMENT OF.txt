Pro se petitioner Rivera seeks leave to proceed in formapauperis under Rule 39 of this Court. We deny this requestpursuant to Rule 39.8. Rivera is allowed until April 12,1999, within which to pay the docketing fee required by Rule38 and to submit his petition in compliance with this Court'sRule 33.1. We also direct the Clerk not to accept any further petitions for certiorari nor petitions for extraordinarywrits from Rivera in noncriminal matters unless he pays thedocketing fee required by Rule 38 and submits his petitionin compliance with Rule 33.1.Rivera has abused this Court's certiorari and extraordinary writ processes. In January of this year, we twice invoked Rule 39.8 to deny Rivera in forma pauperis status.See Rivera v. Allin, 525 U. S. 1065; In re Rivera, 525 U. S.1066. At that time, Rivera had filed two petitions for extraordinary writs and eight petitions for certiorari, all ofwhich were both patently frivolous and had been deniedwithout recorded dissent. The instant petition for certiorari thus constitutes Rivera's 13th frivolous filing with this526US1 Unit: $U36 [09-19-99 17:55:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN136 RIVERA v. FLORIDA DEPT. OF CORRECTIONSStevens, J., dissentingCourt. He has four additional filings--all of them patentlyfrivolous--currently pending before this Court.We enter the order barring prospective filings for the rea-sons discussed in Martin v. District of Columbia Court ofAppeals, 506 U. S. 1 (1992) (per curiam). Rivera's abuse ofthe writ of certiorari and of the extraordinary writs has beenin noncriminal cases, and so we limit our sanction accord-ingly. The order therefore will not prevent Rivera from petitioning to challenge criminal sanctions which might be im-posed on him. The order, however, will allow this Court todevote its limited resources to the claims of petitioners whohave not abused our process.
