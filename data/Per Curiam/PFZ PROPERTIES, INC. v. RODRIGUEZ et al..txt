SECURITIES INVESTOR PROTECTIONCORPORATIONet al.certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuitNo. 90-727. Argued November 13, 1991--Decided March 24, 1992Pursuant to its authority under the Securities Investor Protection Act(SIPA), respondent Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC)sought, and received, judicial decrees to protect the customers of two ofits member broker-dealers. After trustees were appointed to liquidatethe broker-dealers' businesses, SIPC and the trustees filed this suit,alleging, among other things, that petitioner Holmes and others hadconspired in a fraudulent stock-manipulation scheme that disabled thebroker-dealers from meeting obligations to customers; that this conducttriggered SIPC's statutory duty to advance funds to reimburse the customers; that the conspirators had violated the Securities Exchange Actof 1934 and regulations promulgated thereunder; and that their actsamounted to a "pattern of racketeering activity" within the meaning ofthe Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18U. S. C. $$ 1962, 1961(1), and (5), so as to entitle the plaintiffs to recovertreble damages, $ 1964(c). The District Court entered summary judgment for Holmes on the RICO claims, ruling, inter alia, that SIPC didnot meet the "purchaser-seller" requirement for standing under RICO.The Court of Appeals held the finding of no standing to be error and,for this and other reasons, reversed and remanded.Held: SIPC has demonstrated no right to sue Holmes under $ 1964(c).Pp. 265-276.(a) A plaintiff's right to sue under $ 1964(c)--which specifies that"[a]ny person injured . . . by reason of a violation of [$ 1962] may suetherefor . . . and . . . recover threefold the damages he sustains . . ."--requires a showing that the defendant's violation was the proximatecause of the plaintiff's injury. Section 1964(c) was modeled on $ 4 ofthe Clayton Act, which was itself based on $ 7 of the Sherman Act, seeAssociated General Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. Carpenters, 459 U. S.519, 530, and both antitrust sections had been interpreted to incorporatecommon-law principles of proximate causation, see, e. g., id., at 533-534,and n. 29, 536, n. 33. It must be assumed that the Congress whichenacted $ 1964(c) intended its words to have the same meaning thatcourts had already given them. Cf. id., at 534. Although $ 1964(c)'slanguage can be read to require only factual, "but for," causation, this503us2$47J 11-16-95 13:15:57 PAGES OPINPGT259Cite as: 503 U. S. 258 (1992)Syllabusconstruction is hardly compelled, and the very unlikelihood that Congress meant to allow all factually injured plaintiffs to recover persuadesthis Court that RICO should not get such an expansive reading.Pp. 265-268.(b) As used herein, "proximate cause" requires some direct relationbetween the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged. For avariety of reasons, see id., at 540-544, such directness of relationship isone of the essential elements of Clayton Act causation. Pp. 268-270.(c) SIPC's claim that it is entitled to recover on the ground that it issubrogated to the rights of the broker-dealers' customers who did notpurchase manipulated securities fails because the conspirators' conductdid not proximately cause those customers' injury. Even assuming,arguendo, that SIPC may stand in the shoes of such customers, thelink is too remote between the stock manipulation alleged, which directly injured the broker-dealers by rendering them insolvent, and thenonpurchasing customers' losses, which are purely contingent on thebroker-dealers' inability to pay customers' claims. The facts of thiscase demonstrate that the reasons supporting adoption of the ClaytonAct direct-injury limitation, see ibid., apply with equal force to $ 1964(c)suits. First, if the nonpurchasing customers were allowed to sue, thedistrict court would first need to determine the extent to which theirinability to collect from the broker-dealers was the result of the allegedconspiracy, as opposed to, e. g., the broker-dealers' poor business practices or their failures to anticipate financial market developments. Second, assuming that an appropriate assessment of factual causation couldbe made out, the court would then have to find some way to apportionthe possible respective recoveries by the broker-dealers and the customers, who would otherwise each be entitled to recover the full trebledamages. Finally, the law would be shouldering these difficulties despite the fact that the directly injured broker-dealers could be countedon to bring suit for the law's vindication, as they have in fact done inthe persons of their SIPA trustees. Indeed, the insolvency of the victim directly injured adds a further concern to those already expressedin Associated General Contractors, since a suit by an indirectly injuredvictim could be an attempt to circumvent the relative priority its claimwould have in the directly injured victim's liquidation proceedings.This analysis is not deflected by the congressional admonition thatRICO be liberally construed to effectuate its remedial purposes, sinceallowing suits by those injured only indirectly would open the door tomassive and complex damages litigation, which would not only burdenthe courts, but also undermine the effectiveness of treble-damages suits.Id., at 545. Thus, SIPC must await the outcome of the trustees' suit503us2$47J 11-16-95 13:15:57 PAGES OPINPGT260 HOLMES v. SECURITIES INVESTORPROTECTION CORPORATIONSyllabusand may share according to the priority SIPA gives its claim if thetrustees recover from Holmes. Pp. 270-275.(d) SIPC's claim that it is entitled to recover under a SIPA provision,15 U. S. C. $ 78eee(d), fails because, on its face, that section simply qualifies SIPC as a proper party in interest in any "matter arising in a liquidation proceeding" as to which it "shall be deemed to have intervened,"and gives SIPC no independent right to sue Holmes for money damages. Pp. 275-276.(e) This Court declines to decide whether every RICO plaintiff whosues under $ 1964(c) and claims securities fraud as a predicate offensemust have purchased or sold a security. In light of the foregoing, discussion of that issue is unnecessary to resolve this case. Nor will leaving the question unanswered deprive the lower courts of much-neededguidance. A review of those courts' conflicting cases shows that allcould have been resolved on proximate-causation grounds, and that noneinvolved litigants like those in Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores,421 U. S. 723, who decided to forgo securities transactions in reliance onmisrepresentations.

S. 258 (1992)Opinion of the CourtJustice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.Respondent Securities Investor Protection Corporation(SIPC) alleges that petitioner Robert G. Holmes, Jr., conspired in a stock-manipulation scheme that disabled twobroker-dealers from meeting obligations to customers, thustriggering SIPC's statutory duty to advance funds to reimburse the customers. The issue is whether SIPC can recover from Holmes under the Racketeer Influenced andCorrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U. S. C. $$ 1961-1968(1988 ed. and Supp. II). We hold that it cannot.IAThe Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 (SIPA), 84Stat. 1636, as amended, 15 U. S. C. $$ 78aaa-78lll, authorizedthe formation of SIPC, a private nonprofit corporation,$ 78ccc(a)(1), of which most broker-dealers registered under$ 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, $ 78o(b),are required to be "members," $ 78ccc(a)(2)(A). WheneverSIPC determines that a member "has failed or is in dangerof failing to meet its obligations to customers," and findscertain other statutory conditions satisfied, it may ask fora "protective decree" in federal district court. $ 78eee(a)(3).Once a court finds grounds for granting such a petition,$ 78eee(b)(1), it must appoint a trustee charged with liquidating the member's business, $ 78eee(b)(3).After returning all securities registered in specific customers' names, $$ 78fff-2(c)(2); 78fff(a)(1)(A); 78lll(3), the trusteemust pool securities not so registered together with cashfound in customers' accounts and divide this pool ratablyto satisfy customers' claims, $$ 78fff-2(b); 78fff(a)(1)(B).1 To1 Such "customer property," see 15 U.

SECURITIES INVESTORPROTECTION CORPORATIONOpinion of the Courtthe extent the pool of customer property is inadequate, SIPCmust advance up to $500,000 per customer2 to the trusteefor use in satisfying those claims. $ 78fff-3(a).3BOn July 24, 1981, SIPC sought a decree from the UnitedStates District Court for the Southern District of Florida toprotect the customers of First State Securities Corporation(FSSC), a broker-dealer and SIPC member. Three dayslater, it petitioned the United States District Court for theCentral District of California, seeking to protect the customers of Joseph Sebag, Inc. (Sebag), also a broker-dealer andSIPC member. Each court issued the requested decree andappointed a trustee, who proceeded to liquidate the broker-dealer.Two years later, SIPC and the two trustees brought thissuit in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, accusing some 75 defendants of conspiracyin a fraudulent scheme leading to the demise of FSSC andSebag. Insofar as they are relevant here, the allegationswere that, from 1964 through July 1981, the defendants manipulated stock of six companies by making unduly optimisticstatements about their prospects and by continually sellingsmall numbers of shares to create the appearance of a liquidmarket; that the broker-dealers bought substantial amountsof the stock with their own funds; that the market's percep-tion of the fraud in July 1981 sent the stocks plummeting;creditor of the broker-dealer (say, its landlord) is subordinated to claimsof customers and SIPC.2 With respect to a customer's cash on deposit with the broker-dealer,SIPC is not obligated to advance more than $100,000 per customer.$ 78fff-3(a)(1).3 To cover these advances, SIPA provides for the establishment of aSIPC Fund. $ 78ddd(a)(1). SIPC may replenish the fund from time totime by levying assessments, $ 78ddd(c)(2), which members are legally obligated to pay, $ 78jjj(a).503us2$47J 11-16-95 13:15:57 PAGES OPINPGT263Cite as: 503 U. S. 258 (1992)Opinion of the Courtand that this decline caused the broker-dealers' financial dif-ficulties resulting in their eventual liquidation and SIPC'sadvance of nearly $13 million to cover their customers'claims. The complaint described Holmes' participation inthe scheme by alleging that he made false statements aboutthe prospects of one of the six companies, Aero Systems, Inc.,of which he was an officer, director, and major shareholder;and that over an extended period he sold small amounts ofstock in one of the other six companies, the BunningtonCorporation, to simulate a liquid market. The conspiratorswere said to have violated $ 10(b) of the Securities ExchangeAct of 1934, 15 U. S. C. $ 78j(b), Securities and ExchangeCommission (SEC) Rule 10b-5, 17 CFR $ 240.10b-5 (1991),and the mail and wire fraud statutes, 18 U. S. C. $$ 1341, 1343(1988 ed., Supp. II). Finally, the complaint concluded thattheir acts amounted to a "pattern of racketeering activity"within the meaning of the RICO statute, 18 U. S. C. $$ 1962,1961(1), and (5) (1988 ed. and Supp. II), so as to entitle theplaintiffs to recover treble damages, $ 1964(c).After some five years of litigation over other issues,4 theDistrict Court entered summary judgment for Holmes onthe RICO claims, ruling that SIPC "does not meet the`purchaser-seller' requirements for standing to assert RICOclaims which are predicated upon violation of Section 10(b)and Rule 10b-5," App. to Pet. for Cert. 45a,5 and that neither4 See generally Securities Investor Protection Corporation v. Vigman,803 F. 2d 1513 (CA9 1986) (Vigman II); Securities Investor ProtectionCorporation v. Vigman, 764 F. 2d 1309 (CA9 1985) (Vigman I).5 Two years earlier, the District Court had dismissed SIPC's non-RICOsecurities action on the ground that SIPC's claim to have been subrogatedto the rights only of those customers who did not purchase any of themanipulated securities rendered the action a failure under the so-calledBirnbaum test, which requires a plaintiff to be a purchaser or seller of asecurity. See Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421 U. S. 723(1975); Birnbaum v. Newport Steel Corp., 193 F. 2d 461 (CA2), cert. denied,343 U. S. 956 (1952). The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed503us2$47J 11-16-95 13:15:57 PAGES OPINPGT264 HOLMES v. SECURITIES INVESTORPROTECTION CORPORATIONOpinion of the CourtSIPC nor the trustees had satisfied the "proximate causerequirement under RICO," id., at 39a; see id., at 37a. Although SIPC's claims against many other defendants re-mained pending, the District Court under Federal Rule ofCivil Procedure 54(b) entered a partial judgment for Holmes,immediately appealable. SIPC and the trustees appealed.The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuitreversed and remanded after rejecting both of the DistrictCourt's grounds. Securities Investor Protection Corporation v. Vigman, 908 F. 2d 1461 (1990). The Court of Appealsheld first that, whereas a purchase or sale of a security isnecessary for entitlement to sue on the implied right of ac-tion recognized under $ 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, seeBlue ChipStamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421 U. S. 723 (1975), the causeof action expressly provided by $ 1964(c) of RICO imposesno such requirement limiting SIPC's standing, 908 F. 2d, at1465-1467. Second, the appeals court held the finding of noproximate cause to be error, the result of a mistaken focuson the causal relation between SIPC's injury and the acts ofHolmes alone; since Holmes could be held responsible for theacts of all his co-conspirators, the Court of Appeals ex-plained, the District Court should have looked to the causalrelation between SIPC's injury and the acts of all conspira-tors.Id., at 1467-1469.6Holmes' ensuing petition to this Court for certiorari presented two issues, whether SIPC had a right to sue underthat ruling, Vigman II, supra, holding that the District Court should havepermitted SIPC to proceed under the Birnbaum rule to the extent thatFSSC and Sebag had made unauthorized use of those customers' assets tobuy manipulated securities, as SIPC had alleged they had. Id., at 1519-1520. On remand, after discovery, the District Court ruled that no genuine issue of material fact existed on the question of unauthorized use andthat Holmes was entitled to summary judgment. App. to Pet. for Cert.27a. SIPC has not appealed that ruling.6 For purposes of this decision, we will assume without deciding that theCourt of Appeals correctly held that Holmes can be held responsible forthe acts of his co-conspirators.503us2$47J 11-16-95 13:15:57 PAGES OPINPGT265Cite as: 503 U. S. 258 (1992)Opinion of the CourtRICO,7 and whether Holmes could be held responsible forthe actions of his co-conspirators. We granted the petitionon the former issue alone, 499 U. S. 974 (1991), and nowreverse.8IIARICO's provision for civil actions reads that"[a]ny person injured in his business or property by rea-son of a violation of section 1962 of this chapter may suetherefor in any appropriate United States district courtand shall recover threefold the damages he sustains andthe cost of the suit, including a reasonable attorney'sfee." 18 U. S. C. $ 1964(c).This language can, of course, be read to mean that a plain-tiff is injured "by reason of " a RICO violation, and thereforemay recover, simply on showing that the defendant violated$ 1962,9 the plaintiff was injured, and the defendant's viola7 The petition phrased the question as follows: "Whether a party whichwas neither a purchaser nor a seller of securities, and for that reasonlacked standing to sue under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Actof 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, is free of that limitation on standingwhen presenting essentially the same claims under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (`RICO')." Pet. for Cert. i.8 Holmes does not contest the trustees' right to sue under $ 1964(c), andthey took no part in the proceedings before this Court after we grantedcertiorari on the first question alone.9 Section 1962 lists "Prohibited activities." Before this Court, SIPC invokes only subsections (c) and (d). See Brief for Respondent 15, and n. 58.Subsection (c) makes it "unlawful for any person . . . associated with anyenterprise . . . to . . . participate . . . in the conduct of such enterprise'saffairs through a pattern of racketeering activity . . . ." Insofar as it isrelevant here, subsection (d) makes it unlawful to conspire to violate subsection (c). The RICO statute defines "pattern of racketeering activity"as "requir[ing] at least two acts of racketeering activity[,] . . . the last ofwhich occurred within ten years . . . after the commission of a prior act ofracketeering activity." $ 1961(5). The predicate offenses here at issueare listed in 18 U. S. C. $$ 1961(1)(B) and (D) (1988 ed., Supp. II), which503us2$47J 11-16-95 13:15:57 PAGES OPINPGT266 HOLMES v. SECURITIES INVESTORPROTECTION CORPORATIONOpinion of the Courttion was a "but for" cause of plaintiff 's injury. Cf. Associ-ated General Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. Carpenters, 459U. S. 519, 529 (1983). This construction is hardly compelled,however, and the very unlikelihood that Congress meant toallow all factually injured plaintiffs to recover 10 persuadesus that RICO should not get such an expansive reading.11Not even SIPC seriously argues otherwise.12define "racketeering activity" to include "any act which is indictable under. . . section 1341 (relating to mail fraud), [or] section 1343 (relating towire fraud), . . . or . . . any offense involving . . . fraud in the sale ofsecurities . . . ."10 "In a philosophical sense, the consequences of an act go forward toeternity, and the causes of an event go back to the dawn of human events,and beyond. But any attempt to impose responsibility upon such a basiswould result in infinite liability for all wrongful acts, and would `set societyon edge and fill the courts with endless litigation.' " W. Keeton, D. Dobbs,R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts $ 41, p. 264(5th ed. 1984) (quoting North v. Johnson, 58 Minn. 242, 245, 59 N. W. 1012(1894)). As we put it in the antitrust context, "An antitrust violation maybe expected to cause ripples of harm to flow through the Nation's economy;but despite the broad wording of $ 4 [of the Clayton Act, 15 U. S. C. $ 15,]there is a point beyond which the wrongdoer should not be held liable."Blue Shield of Virginia v. McCready, 457 U. S. 465, 476-477 (1982) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).11 The Courts of Appeals have overwhelmingly held that not mere factual, but proximate, causation is required. See, e. g., Pelletier v. Zweifel,921 F. 2d 1465, 1499-1500 (CA11), cert. denied, 502 U. S. 855 (1991); OceanEnergy II, Inc. v. Alexander & Alexander, Inc., 868 F. 2d 740, 744 (CA51989); Brandenburg v. Seidel, 859 F. 2d 1179, 1189 (CA4 1988); Sperber v.Boesky, 849 F. 2d 60 (CA2 1988); Haroco, Inc. v. American NationalBank & Trust Co. of Chicago, 747 F. 2d 384, 398 (CA7 1984), aff'd, 473U. S. 606 (1985) (per curiam). Indeed, the court below recognized aproximate-cause requirement. See Securities Investor Protection Corporation v. Vigman, 908 F. 2d 1461, 1468 (CA9 1990).12 SIPC does say that the question whether its claim must, and as alleged may, satisfy the standard of proximate causation is not within thequestion on which we granted certiorari. See Brief for Respondent 3, 33,34, 38-39. However, the proximate-cause issue is "fairly included" withinthat question. See this Court's Rule 14.1(a). SIPC's own restatement ofthe question presented reads: "Was the Ninth Circuit correct when it heldthat SIPC need not be a `purchaser or seller' of securities to sue underSection 1964(c), which provides that `any person' may sue for `injury to503us2$47J 11-16-95 13:15:57 PAGES OPINPGT267Cite as: 503 U. S. 258 (1992)Opinion of the CourtThe key to the better interpretation lies in some statutoryhistory. We have repeatedly observed, seeAgency HoldingCorp. v. Malley-Duff & Associates, Inc., 483 U. S. 143, 150-151 (1987); Shearson/American Express Inc. v. McMahon,482 U. S. 220, 241 (1987); Sedima, S. P. R. L. v. Imrex Co., 473U. S. 479, 489 (1985), that Congress modeled $ 1964(c) on thecivil-action provision of the federal antitrust laws, $ 4 of theClayton Act, which reads in relevant part that"any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrustlaws may sue therefor . . . and shall recover threefoldthe damages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee." 15 U. S. C. $ 15.In Associated General Contractors, supra, we discussedhow Congress enacted $ 4 in 1914 with language borrowedfrom $ 7 of the Sherman Act, passed 24 years earlier.13 Before 1914, lower federal courts had read $ 7 to incorporatecommon-law principles of proximate causation, 459 U. S., at533-534, and n. 29 (citing Loeb v. Eastman Kodak Co., 183F. 704 (CA3 1910); Ames v. American Telephone & TelegraphCo., 166 F. 820 (CC Mass. 1909)), and we reasoned, as manylower federal courts had done before us, see Associated Genhis business or property' `by reason of' `any offense . . . involving fraud inthe sale of securities . . . punishable under any law of the United States,'wire fraud, or mail fraud in violation of Section 1962?" Brief for Respondent i (ellipses in original). By thus restating the question presented (aswas its right to do, see this Court's Rule 24.2), SIPC properly set theenquiry in the key of the language of $ 1964(c), which we hold today carriesa proximate-cause requirement within it. What is more, SIPC briefedthe proximate-cause issue, see Brief for Respondent 34-36, 38-39, andannounced at oral argument that it recognized the Court might reach it,see Tr. of Oral Arg. 31.13 When Congress enacted $ 4 of the Clayton Act, $ 7 of the Sherman Actread in relevant part:"Any person who shall be injured in his business or property by anyother person or corporation by reason of anything forbidden or declaredto be unlawful by this act, may sue . . . ." 26 Stat. 210.503us2$47J 11-16-95 13:15:57 PAGES OPINPGT268 HOLMES v. SECURITIES INVESTORPROTECTION CORPORATIONOpinion of the Courteral Contractors, supra, at 536, n. 33 (citing cases),14 thatcongressional use of the $ 7 language in $ 4 presumably carried the intention to adopt "the judicial gloss that avoided asimple literal interpretation," 459 U. S., at 534. Thus, weheld that a plaintiff 's right to sue under $ 4 required a show-ing that the defendant's violation not only was a "but for"cause of his injury, but was the proximate cause as well.The reasoning applies just as readily to $ 1964(c). We mayfairly credit the 91st Congress, which enacted RICO, withknowing the interpretation federal courts had given thewords earlier Congresses had used first in $ 7 of the ShermanAct, and later in the Clayton Act's $ 4. SeeCannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U. S. 677, 696-698 (1979). It usedthe same words, and we can only assume it intended them tohave the same meaning that courts had already given them.See, e. g., Oscar Mayer & Co. v. Evans, 441 U. S. 750, 756(1979); Northcross v. Memphis Bd. of Ed., 412 U. S. 427, 428(1973). Proximate cause is thus required.BHere we use "proximate cause" to label generically thejudicial tools used to limit a person's responsibility for theconsequences of that person's own acts. At bottom, the no-tion of proximate cause reflects "ideas of what justice demands, or of what is administratively possible and conven-ient." W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosserand Keeton on Law of Torts $ 41, p. 264 (5th ed. 1984). Ac-cordingly, among the many shapes this concept took at common law, see Associated General Contractors, supra, at532-533, was a demand for some direct relation between theinjury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged. Thus, aplaintiff who complained of harm flowing merely from themisfortunes visited upon a third person by the defendant'sacts was generally said to stand at too remote a distance to14 These lower courts had so held well before 1970, when Congresspassed RICO.503us2$47J 11-16-95 13:15:57 PAGES OPINPGT269Cite as: 503 U. S. 258 (1992)Opinion of the Courtrecover. See, e. g., 1 J. Sutherland, Law of Damages 55-56(1882).Although such directness of relationship is not the sole re-quirement of Clayton Act causation,15 it has been one of itscentral elements, Associated General Contractors, 459 U. S.,at 540, for a variety of reasons. First, the less direct aninjury is, the more difficult it becomes to ascertain theamount of a plaintiff 's damages attributable to the violation,as distinct from other, independent, factors. Id., at 542-543.Second, quite apart from problems of proving factual causation, recognizing claims of the indirectly injured would forcecourts to adopt complicated rules apportioning damagesamong plaintiffs removed at different levels of injury fromthe violative acts, to obviate the risk of multiple recoveries.Id., at 543-544; Blue Shield of Virginia v. McCready, 457U. S. 465, 473-475 (1982); Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co. of Cal.,405 U. S. 251, 264 (1972). And, finally, the need to grapplewith these problems is simply unjustified by the general interest in deterring injurious conduct, since directly injuredvictims can generally be counted on to vindicate the law as15 We have sometimes discussed the requirement that a $ 4 plaintiff havesuffered "antitrust injury" as a component of the proximate-cause enquiry.See Associated General Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. Carpenters, 459 U. S.519, 538 (1983); Blue Shield of Virginia v. McCready, 457 U. S., at 481-484.We need not discuss it here, however, since "antitrust injury" has no analogue in the RICO setting. See Sedima, S. P. R. L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U. S.479, 495-497 (1985).For the same reason, there is no merit in SIPC's reliance on legislativehistory to the effect that it would be inappropriate to have a "privatelitigant . . . contend with a body of precedent--appropriate in a purelyantitrust context--setting strict requirements on questions such as `standing to sue' and `proximate cause.' " 115 Cong. Rec. 6995 (1969) (AmericanBar Association comments on S. 2048). That statement is rightly understood to refer only to the applicability of the concept of "antitrust injury"to RICO, which we rejected in Sedima, supra, at 495-497. See Brandenburg v. Seidel, 859 F. 2d, at 1189, n. 11. Besides, even if we were to readthis statement to say what SIPC says it means, it would not amount tomore than background noise drowned out by the statutory language.503us2$47J 11-16-95 13:15:57 PAGES OPINPGT270 HOLMES v. SECURITIES INVESTORPROTECTION CORPORATIONOpinion of the Courtprivate attorneys general, without any of the problems attendant upon suits by plaintiffs injured more remotely. Associated General Contractors, supra, at 541-542.We will point out in Part III-A below that the facts ofthe instant case show how these reasons apply with equalforce to suits under $ 1964(c).IIIAs we understand SIPC's argument, it claims entitlementto recover, first, because it is subrogated to the rights ofthose customers of the broker-dealers who did not purchasemanipulated securities, and, second, because a SIPA provision gives it an independent right to sue. The first claimfails because the conspirators' conduct did not proximatelycause the nonpurchasing customers' injury, the second because the provision relied on gives SIPC no right to sue fordamages.AAs a threshold matter, SIPC's theory of subrogation isfraught with unanswered questions. In suing Holmes, SIPCdoes not rest its claimed subrogation to the rights of thebroker-dealers' customers on any provision of SIPA. SeeBrief for Respondent 38, and n. 181. SIPC assumes thatSIPA provides for subrogation to the customers' claimsagainst the failed broker-dealers, see 15 U. S. C. $$ 78fff-3(a),78fff-4(c); see also $ 78fff-2(c)(1)(C); see generally Mishkin v.Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co., 744 F. Supp. 531, 556-557(SDNY 1990), but not against third parties like Holmes. Asagainst him, SIPC relies rather on "common law rights ofsubrogation" for what it describes as "its money paid to customers for customer claims against third parties." Brief forRespondent 38 (footnote omitted). At oral argument in thisCourt, SIPC narrowed its subrogation argument to coveronly the rights of customers who never purchased manipu503us2$47J 11-16-95 13:15:57 PAGES OPINPGT271Cite as: 503 U. S. 258 (1992)Opinion of the Courtlated securities. Tr. of Oral Arg. 29.16 But SIPC stopsthere, leaving us to guess at the nature of the "common lawrights of subrogation" that it claims, and failing to tell uswhether they derive from federal or state common law, or, ifthe latter, from common law of which State.17 Nor doesSIPC explain why it declines to assert the rights of customers who bought manipulated securities.18It is not these questions, however, that stymie SIPC's subrogation claim, for even assuming, arguendo, that it maystand in the shoes of nonpurchasing customers, the link istoo remote between the stock manipulation alleged and thecustomers' harm, being purely contingent on the harm suffered by the broker-dealers. That is, the conspirators haveallegedly injured these customers only insofar as the stockmanipulation first injured the broker-dealers and left themwithout the wherewithal to pay customers' claims. Although the customers' claims are senior (in recourse to "customer property") to those of the broker-dealers' generalcreditors, see $ 78fff-2(c)(1), the causes of their respectiveinjuries are the same: The broker-dealers simply cannot paytheir bills, and only that intervening insolvency connects theconspirators' acts to the losses suffered by the nonpurchasingcustomers and general creditors.As we said, however, in Associated General Contractors,quoting Justice Holmes, " `The general tendency of the law,in regard to damages at least, is not to go beyond the firststep.' " 459 U. S., at 534 (quoting Southern Pacific Co. v.16 And, SIPC made no allegation that any of these customers failed todo so in reliance on acts or omissions of the conspirators.17 There is support for the proposition that SIPC can assert statelaw subrogation rights against third parties. See Redington v. ToucheRoss & Co., 592 F. 2d 617, 624 (CA2 1978), rev'd on other grounds, 442U. S. 560 (1979). We express no opinion on this issue.18 The record reveals that those customers have brought their own suitagainst the conspirators.503us2$47J 11-16-95 13:15:57 PAGES OPINPGT272 HOLMES v.

S. 531, 533 (1918)),19 andthe reasons that supported conforming Clayton Act causation to the general tendency apply just as readily to the pres-ent facts, underscoring the obvious congressional adoption ofthe Clayton Act direct-injury limitation among the require-ments of $ 1964(c).20 If the nonpurchasing customers were19 SIPC tries to avoid foundering on the rule that creditors generallymay not sue for injury affecting their debtors' solvency by arguing thatthose customers that owned manipulated securities themselves were victims of Holmes' fraud. See Brief for Respondent 39, n. 185 (citing Ashland Oil, Inc. v. Arnett, 875 F. 2d 1271, 1280 (CA7 1989); Ocean Energy,868 F. 2d, at 744-747; Bankers Trust Co. v. Rhoades, 859 F. 2d 1096, 1100-1101 (CA2 1988), cert. denied, 490 U. S. 1007 (1989)). While that may wellbe true, since SIPC does not claim subrogation to the rights of the customers that purchased manipulated securities, see supra, at 270-271, it gainsnothing by the point.We further note that SIPC alleged in the courts below that, in late May1981, Joseph Lugo, an officer of FSSC and one of the alleged conspirators,parked manipulated stock in the accounts of customers, among themHolmes, who actively participated in the parking transaction involving hisaccount. See Statement of Background and Facts, 1 App. 223-225. Lugo"sold" securities owned by FSSC to customers at market price and"bought" back the same securities some days later at the same price plusinterest. Under applicable regulations, a broker-dealer must discount thestock it holds in its own account, see 17 CFR $ 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(iv)(F)(1)(vi)(1991), and the sham transactions allowed FSSC to avoid the discount.But for the parking transactions, FSSC would allegedly have failed capitalrequirements sooner; would have been shut down by regulators; and wouldnot have dragged Sebag with it in its demise. 1 App. 231. Thus, theircustomers would have been injured to a lesser extent. Id., at 229, 231.We do not rule out that, if, by engaging in the parking transactions, theconspirators committed mail fraud, wire fraud, or "fraud in the sale ofsecurities," see 18 U. S. C. $$ 1961(1)(B) and (D) (1988 ed., Supp. I), thebroker-dealers' customers might be proximately injured by these offenses.See, e. g., Taffet v. Southern Co., 930 F. 2d 847, 856-857 (CA11 1991);County of Suffolk v. Long Island Lighting Co., 907 F. 2d 1295, 1311-1312(CA2 1990). However this may be, SIPC in its brief on the merits placesexclusive reliance on a manipulation theory and is completely silent aboutthe alleged parking scheme.20 As we said in Associated General Contractors, "the infinite variety ofclaims that may arise make it virtually impossible to announce a blackletter rule that will dictate the result in every case." 459 U. S., at 536503us2$47J 11-16-95 13:15:57 PAGES OPINPGT273Cite as: 503 U. S. 258 (1992)Opinion of the Courtallowed to sue, the district court would first need to deter-mine the extent to which their inability to collect from thebroker-dealers was the result of the alleged conspiracy tomanipulate, as opposed to, say, the broker-dealers' poor business practices or their failures to anticipate developments inthe financial markets. Assuming that an appropriate assessment of factual causation could be made out, the districtcourt would then have to find some way to apportion thepossible respective recoveries by the broker-dealers and thecustomers, who would otherwise each be entitled to recoverthe full treble damages. Finally, the law would be shoulder-ing these difficulties despite the fact that those directlyinjured, the broker-dealers, could be counted on to bring suitfor the law's vindication. As noted above, the brokerdealers have in fact sued in this case, in the persons of theirSIPA trustees appointed on account of their insolvency.21(footnote omitted). Thus, our use of the term "direct" should merely beunderstood as a reference to the proximate-cause enquiry that is informedby the concerns set out in the text. We do not necessarily use it in thesame sense as courts before us have and intimate no opinion on resultsthey reached. See, e. g., Sedima, 473 U. S., at 497, n. 15; id., at 522 (Marshall, J., dissenting); Pelletier, 921 F. 2d, at 1499-1500; Ocean Energy,supra.21 If the trustees had not brought suit, SIPC likely could have forcedtheir hands. To the extent consistent with SIPA, bankruptcy principlesapply to liquidations under that statute. See $ 78fff(b); see also $ 78fff-1(b) (to extent consistent with SIPA, SIPA trustee has same duties astrustee under Chapter 7 of Bankruptcy Code); $ 78eee(b)(2)(A)(iii) (to extent consistent with SIPA, court supervising SIPA liquidation has samepowers and duties as bankruptcy court). And, it is generally held that acreditor can, by petitioning the bankruptcy court for an order to thateffect, compel the trustee to institute suit against a third party. See Inre Automated Business Systems, Inc., 642 F. 2d 200, 201 (CA6 1981). Asa practical matter, it is very unlikely that SIPC will have to petition acourt for such an order, given its influence over SIPA trustees. See$ 78eee(b)(3) (court must appoint as trustee "such perso[n] as SIPC, in itssole discretion, specifies," which in certain circumstances may be SIPCitself); $ 78eee(b)(5)(C) (SIPC's recommendation to court on trustee's compensation is entitled to "considerable reliance" and is, under certain circumstances, binding).503us2$47J 11-16-95 13:15:57 PAGES OPINPGT274 HOLMES v. SECURITIES INVESTORPROTECTION CORPORATIONOpinion of the CourtIndeed, the insolvency of the victim directly injured adds afurther concern to those already expressed, since a suit byan indirectly injured victim could be an attempt to circumvent the relative priority its claim would have in the directlyinjured victim's liquidation proceedings. See Mid-StateFertilizer Co. v. Exchange National Bank of Chicago, 877F. 2d 1333, 1336 (CA7 1989).As against the force of these considerations of history andpolicy, SIPC's reliance on the congressional admonition thatRICO be "liberally construed to effectuate its remedial purposes," $ 904(a), 84 Stat. 947, does not deflect our analysis.There is, for that matter, nothing illiberal in our construction: We hold not that RICO cannot serve to right the conspirators' wrongs, but merely that the nonpurchasing customers, or SIPC in their stead, are not proper plaintiffs.Indeed, we fear that RICO's remedial purposes would moreprobably be hobbled than helped by SIPC's version of liberalconstruction: Allowing suits by those injured only indirectlywould open the door to "massive and complex damages litigation[, which would] not only burde[n] the courts, but [would]also undermin[e] the effectiveness of treble-damages suits."Associated General Contractors, 459 U. S., at 545.In sum, subrogation to the rights of the manipulation conspiracy's secondary victims does, and should, run afoul ofproximate-causation standards, and SIPC must wait on theoutcome of the trustees' suit. If they recover from Holmes,SIPC may share according to the priority SIPA gives itsclaim. See 15 U. S. C. $ 78fff-2(c).BSIPC also claims a statutory entitlement to pursue Holmesfor funds advanced to the trustees for administering the liquidation proceedings. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 30. Its theoryhere apparently is not one of subrogation, to which the statute makes no reference in connection with SIPC's obligation503us2$47J 11-16-95 13:15:57 PAGES OPINPGT275Cite as: 503 U. S. 258 (1992)Opinion of the Courtto make such advances. See 15 U. S. C. $ 78fff-3(b)(2).22SIPC relies instead, see Brief for Respondent 37, and n. 180,on this SIPA provision:"SIPC participation--SIPC shall be deemed to be aparty in interest as to all matters arising in a liquidationproceeding, with the right to be heard on all such mat-ters, and shall be deemed to have intervened with respect to all such matters with the same force and effectas if a petition for such purpose had been allowed by thecourt." 15 U. S. C. $ 78eee(d).The language is inapposite to the issue here, however. Onits face, it simply qualifies SIPC as a proper party in interestin any "matter arising in a liquidation proceeding" as towhich it "shall be deemed to have intervened." By extending a right to be heard in a "matter" pending between otherparties, however, the statute says nothing about the conditions necessary for SIPC's recovery as a plaintiff. How theprovision could be read, either alone or with $ 1964(c), to giveSIPC a right to sue Holmes for money damages simplyeludes us.IVPetitioner urges us to go further and decide whether everyRICO plaintiff who sues under $ 1964(c) and claims securitiesfraud as a predicate offense must have purchased or sold asecurity, an issue on which the Circuits appear divided.23We decline to do so. Given what we have said in Parts II22 To the extent that SIPC's unexplained remark at oral argument, seeTr. of Oral Arg. 29-30, could be understood to rest its claim for recoveryof these advances on a theory of subrogation, it came too late. One looksin vain for any such argument in its brief.23 Compare 908 F. 2d, at 1465-1467 (no purchaser-seller rule underRICO); Warner v. Alexander Grant & Co., 828 F. 2d 1528, 1530 (CA111987) (same), with International Data Bank, Ltd. v. Zepkin, 812 F. 2d 149,151-154 (CA4 1987) (RICO plaintiff relying on securities fraud as predicateoffense must have been purchaser or seller); Brannan v. Eisenstein, 804F. 2d 1041, 1046 (CA8 1986) (same).503us2$47J 11-16-95 13:15:57 PAGES OPINPGT276 HOLMES v. SECURITIES INVESTORPROTECTION CORPORATIONOpinion of O'Connor, J.and III, our discussion of the issue would be unnecessary tothe resolution of this case. Nor do we think that leavingthis question unanswered will deprive the lower courts ofmuch-needed guidance. A review of the conflicting casesshows that all could have been resolved on proximate-causation grounds, and that none involved litigants like thosein Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421 U. S. 723(1975), persons who had decided to forgo securities transactions in reliance on misrepresentations. Thus, we think itinopportune to resolve the issue today.VWe hold that, because the alleged conspiracy to manipulatedid not proximately cause the injury claimed, SIPC's allegations and the record before us fail to make out a right to suepetitioner under $ 1964(c). We reverse the judgment of theCourt of Appeals and remand the case for further proceed-ings consistent with this opinion.
