The question presented is whether the parties' debtrestructuring agreement is "a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce" within the meaning of the FederalArbitration Act (FAA). 9 U. S. C. $ 2. As we concluded inAllied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson, 513 U. S. 265 (1995),there is a sufficient nexus with interstate commerce to makeenforceable, pursuant to the FAA, an arbitration provisionincluded in that agreement.IPetitioner The Citizens Bank--an Alabama lending institution--seeks to compel arbitration of a financial disputewith respondents Alafabco, Inc.--an Alabama fabrication andconstruction company--and its officers. According to a complaint filed by respondents in Alabama state court, the dispute among the parties arose out of a series of commercialloan transactions made over a decade-long course of businessdealings. In 1986, the complaint alleges, the parties enteredinto a quasi-contractual relationship in which the bankagreed to provide operating capital necessary for Alafabcoto secure and complete construction contracts. That relationship began to sour in 1998, when the bank allegedly encouraged Alafabco to bid on a large construction contractin Courtland, Alabama, but refused to provide the capitalnecessary to complete the project. In order to compensatefor the bank's alleged breach of the parties' implied agreement, Alafabco completed the Courtland project with fundsthat would otherwise have been dedicated to repaying existing obligations to the bank. Alafabco in turn became delinquent in repaying those existing obligations.On two occasions, the parties attempted to resolve theoutstanding debts. On May 3, 1999, Alafabco and the bankexecuted " `renewal notes' " in which all previous loans were539US1 Unit: $U65 [07-05-05 16:58:06] PAGES PGT: OPIN54 CITIZENS BANK v. ALAFABCO, INC.Per Curiamrestructured and redocumented. 872 So. 2d 798 (Ala. 2002).The debt-restructuring arrangement included an arbitrationagreement covering " `all disputes, claims, or controversies.' "That agreement provided that the FAA " `shall apply to [its]construction, interpretation, and enforcement.' " Id., at 799.Alafabco defaulted on its obligations under the renewal notesand sought bankruptcy protection in federal court in September 1999.In return for the dismissal of Alafabco's bankruptcy petition, the bank agreed to renegotiate the outstanding loans ina second debt-restructuring agreement. On December 10,1999, the parties executed new loan documents encompassingAlafabco's entire outstanding debt, approximately $430,000,which was secured by a mortgage on commercial real estateowned by the individual respondents, by Alafabco's accountsreceivable, inventory, supplies, fixtures, machinery, andequipment, and by a mortgage on the house of one of theindividual respondents. Id., at 800. As part of the seconddebt-restructuring agreement, the parties executed an arbitration agreement functionally identical to that of May 3,1999.Within a year of the December 1999 debt restructuring,Alafabco brought suit in the Circuit Court of LawrenceCounty, Alabama, against the bank and its officers. Alafabco alleged, among other causes of action, breach of contract, fraud, breach of fiduciary duties, intentional inflictionof emotional distress, and interference with a contractual orbusiness relationship. Essentially, the suit alleged that Alafabco detrimentally " `incur[red] massive debt' " because thebank had unlawfully reneged on its agreement to providecapital sufficient to complete the Courtland project. Id., at799. Invoking the arbitration agreements, the bank movedto compel arbitration of the parties' dispute. The CircuitCourt ordered respondents to submit to arbitration in accordance with the arbitration agreements.539US1 Unit: $U65 [07-05-05 16:58:06] PAGES PGT: OPIN55Cite as: 539 U. S. 52 (2003)Per CuriamThe Supreme Court of Alabama reversed over JusticeSee's dissent. Applying a test it first adopted in Sisters ofthe Visitation v. Cochran Plastering Co., 775 So. 2d 759(2000), the court held that the debt-restructuring agreements were the relevant transactions and proceeded todetermine whether those transactions, by themselves, hada "substantial effect on interstate commerce." 872 So. 2d,at 801, 803. Because there was no showing "that any portion of the restructured debt was actually attributable tointerstate transactions; that the funds comprising that debtoriginated out-of-state; or that the restructured debt was in-separable from any out-of-state projects,"id., at 805, thecourt found an insufficient nexus with interstate commerceto establish FAA coverage of the parties' dispute.Justice See in dissent explained why, in his view, the courthad erred by using the test formulated in Sisters of the Visi-tation, in which the Supreme Court of Alabama read thisCourt's opinion in United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549(1995), to require that "a particular contract, in order to beenforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act must, by it-self, have a substantial effect on interstate commerce." 872So. 2d, at 808. Rejecting that stringent test and assessingthe evidence with a more generous view of the necessaryeffect on interstate commerce, Justice See would have foundthat the bank's loans to Alafabco satisfied the FAA's "involving commerce" requirement.IIThe FAA provides that a"written provision in any maritime transaction or a con-tractevidencing a transaction involving commerce tosettle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising outof such contract or transaction, or the refusal to performthe whole or any part thereof, or an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration an existing controversy aris-ing out of such a contract, transaction, or refusal, shall539US1 Unit: $U65 [07-05-05 16:58:06] PAGES PGT: OPIN56 CITIZENS BANK v. ALAFABCO, INC.Per Curiambe valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon suchgrounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocationof any contract." 9 U. S. C. $ 2 (emphasis added).The statute further defines "commerce" to include "com-merce among the several States." $ 1. Echoing JusticeSee's dissenting opinion, petitioner contends that the deci-sion below gives inadequate breadth to the "involving commerce" language of the statute. We agree.We have interpreted the term "involving commerce" in theFAA as the functional equivalent of the more familiar term"affecting commerce"--words of art that ordinarily signalthe broadest permissible exercise of Congress' CommerceClause power. Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos., 513 U. S., at273-274. Because the statute provides for "the enforcementof arbitration agreements within the full reach of the Commerce Clause," Perry v. Thomas, 482 U. S. 483, 490 (1987), itis perfectly clear that the FAA encompasses a wider rangeof transactions than those actually "in commerce"--that is,"within the flow of interstate commerce," Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos., supra, at 273 (internal quotation marks, citation,and emphasis omitted).The Supreme Court of Alabama was therefore misguidedin its search for evidence that a "portion of the restructureddebt was actually attributable to interstate transactions" orthat the loans "originated out-of-state" or that "the restructured debt was inseparable from any out-of-state projects."872 So. 2d, at 805. Such evidence might be required if theFAA were restricted to transactions actually " `in com-merce,' "Gulf Oil Corp. v. Copp Paving Co., 419 U. S. 186,195-196 (1974), but, as we have explained, that is not thelimit of the FAA's reach.Nor is application of the FAA defeated because the individual debt-restructuring transactions, taken alone, didnot have a "substantial effect on interstate commerce." 872So. 2d, at 803. Congress' Commerce Clause power "maybe exercised in individual cases without show ing any539US1 Unit: $U65 [07-05-05 16:58:06] PAGES PGT: OPIN57Cite as: 539 U. S. 52 (2003)Per Curiamspecific effect upon interstate commerce" if in the aggregatethe economic activity in question would represent "a generalpractice . . . subject to federal control." Mandeville IslandFarms, Inc. v. American Crystal Sugar Co., 334 U. S. 219,236 (1948). See also Perez v. United States, 402 U. S. 146,154 (1971);Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111, 127-128 (1942).Only that general practice need bear on interstate commercein a substantial way. Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U. S. 183, 196-197, n. 27 (1968);NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., 301U. S. 1, 37-38 (1937).This case is well within our previous pronouncements onthe extent of Congress' Commerce Clause power. Althoughthe debt-restructuring agreements were executed in Alabama by Alabama residents, they nonetheless satisfy theFAA's "involving commerce" test for at least three reasons.First, Alafabco engaged in business throughout the southeastern United States using substantial loans from the bankthat were renegotiated and redocumented in the debtrestructuring agreements. Indeed, the gravamen of Alafabco's state-court suit was that it had incurred " `massivedebt' " to the bank in order to keep its business afloat, andthe bank submitted affidavits of bank officers establishingthat its loans to Alafabco had been used in part to financelarge construction projects in North Carolina, Tennessee,and Alabama.Second, the restructured debt was secured by all of Alafabco's business assets, including its inventory of goods assembled from out-of-state parts and raw materials. If theCommerce Clause gives Congress the power to regulate localbusiness establishments purchasing substantial quantities ofgoods that have moved in interstate commerce, Katzenbachv. McClung, 379 U. S. 294, 304-305 (1964), it necessarilyreaches substantial commercial loan transactions secured bysuch goods.Third, were there any residual doubt about the magnitudeof the impact on interstate commerce caused by the particu539US1 Unit: $U65 [07-05-05 16:58:06] PAGES PGT: OPIN58 CITIZENS BANK v. ALAFABCO, INC.Per Curiamlar economic transactions in which the parties were engaged,that doubt would dissipate upon consideration of the "general practice" those transactions represent. Mandeville Island Farms, supra, at 236. No elaborate explanation isneeded to make evident the broad impact of commercial lend-ing on the national economy or Congress' power to regulatethat activity pursuant to the Commerce Clause. Lewis v.BT Investment Managers, Inc., 447 U. S. 27, 38-39 (1980)("[B]anking and related financial activities are of profoundlocal concern. . . . Nonetheless, it does not follow that thesesame activities lack important interstate attributes");Perez,supra, at 154-155 ("Extortionate credit transactions, thoughpurely intrastate, may in the judgment of Congress affectinterstate commerce").The decision below therefore adheres to an improperlycramped view of Congress' Commerce Clause power. Thatview, first announced by the Supreme Court of Alabama inSisters of the Visitation v. Cochran Plastering Co., 775So. 2d 759 (2000), appears to rest on a misreading of ourdecision in United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549 (1995).Lopez did not restrict the reach of the FAA or implicitlyoverrule Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos.--indeed, we did notdiscuss that case in Lopez. Nor did Lopez purport to announce a new rule governing Congress' Commerce Clausepower over concededly economic activity such as the debtrestructuring agreements before us now. 514 U. S., at 561.To be sure, "the power to regulate commerce, though broadindeed, has limits," Maryland v. Wirtz, supra, at 196, butnothing in our decision in Lopez suggests that those limitsare breached by applying the FAA to disputes arising out ofthe commercial loan transactions in this case.Accordingly, the petition for writ of certiorari is granted,the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alabama is reversed,and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
