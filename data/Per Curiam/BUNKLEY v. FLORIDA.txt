Clyde Timothy Bunkley petitions for a writ of certiorari,arguing that the Florida Supreme Court contradicted theprinciples of this Court's decision in Fiore v. White, 531U. S. 225 (2001) (per curiam), when it failed to determinewhether the "common pocketknife" exception to Florida'sdefinition of a " `[w]eapon' " encompassed Bunkley's pocketknife at the time that his conviction became final in 1989.Fla. Stat. $ 790.001(13) (2000). We agree, and thereforegrant Bunkley's motion to proceed in forma pauperis andhis petition for a writ of certiorari.IIn the early morning hours of April 16, 1986, Bunkley bur-glarized a closed, unoccupied Western Sizzlin' Restaurant.Report and Recommendation in No. 91-113-CIV-T-99(B)(MD Fla.), p. 1. The police arrested him after he left therestaurant. At the time of his arrest, the police discovereda "pocketknife, with a blade of 21/2 to 3 inches in length, . . .folded and in his pocket." 768 So. 2d 510 (Fla. App. 2000)(per curiam). "There is no evidence indicating Bunkleyever used the pocketknife during the burglary, nor that hethreatened anyone with the pocketknife at any time." Ibid.Bunkley was charged with burglary in the first degree because he was armed with a "dangerous weapon"--namely,the pocketknife. Fla. Stat. $ 810.02(2)(b) (2000). The punishment for burglary in the first degree is "imprisonment538US2 Unit: $U61 [10-27-04 17:24:21] PAGES PGT: OPIN837Cite as: 538 U. S. 835 (2003)Per Curiamfor a term of years not exceeding life imprisonment."$ 810.02(2). If the pocketknife had not been classified as a"dangerous weapon," Bunkley would have been charged withburglary in the third degree. See 833 So. 2d 739, 742 (Fla.2002). Burglary in the third degree is punishable "by aterm of imprisonment not exceeding 5 years." Fla. Stat.$ 775.082(3)(d) (2002); see also 833 So. 2d, at 742. Bunkleywas convicted of burglary in the first degree. He was sen-tenced to life imprisonment. In 1989, a Florida appellatecourt affirmed Bunkley's conviction and sentence. See 539So. 2d 477.Florida law defines a " `[w]eapon' " to "mea[n] any dirk,metallic knuckles, slingshot, billie, tear gas gun, chemicalweapon or device, or other deadly weapon except a firearmor a common pocketknife." $ 790.001(13). Florida has excepted the " `common pocketknife' " from its weapons statutesince 1901, and the relevant language has remained unchanged since that time. See 833 So. 2d, at 743.In 1997, the Florida Supreme Court interpreted the meaning of the "common pocketknife" exception for the first time.In L. B. v. State, 700 So. 2d 370, 373 (per curiam), the courtdetermined that a pocketknife with a blade of 33/4 inches"plainly falls within the statutory exception to the definitionof `weapon' found in section 790.001(13)." The completeanalysis of the Florida Supreme Court on this issue was asfollows: "In 1951, the Attorney General of Florida opinedthat a pocketknife with a blade of four inches in length orless was a `common pocketknife.' The knife appellant carried, which had a 33/4-inch blade, clearly fell within thisrange." Ibid. (citation omitted). The Florida SupremeCourt accordingly vacated the conviction in L. B. becausethe "knife in question was a `common pocketknife' under anyintended definition of that term." Ibid. Justice Grimes,joined by Justice Wells, wrote an opinion agreeing with themajority's resolution of the case "[i]n view of the AttorneyGeneral's opinion and the absence of a more definitive description of a common pocketknife." Ibid.538US2 Unit: $U61 [10-27-04 17:24:21] PAGES PGT: OPIN838 BUNKLEY v. FLORIDAPer CuriamAfter the Florida Supreme Court issued its decision inL. B., Bunkley filed a motion for postconviction relief underFlorida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.850 (1999). Bunkleyalleged that under the L. B. decision, his pocketknife couldnot have been considered a "weapon" under $ 790.001(13).He therefore argued that his conviction for armed burglary was invalid and should be vacated because a "commonpocketknife can not[sic] support a conviction involvingpossession of a weapon." App. to Pet. for Cert. C-2. TheCircuit Court rejected Bunkley's motion, and the DistrictCourt of Appeal of Florida, Second District, affirmed. 768So. 2d 510 (2000).The Florida Supreme Court also rejected Bunkley's claim.It held that the L. B. decision did not apply retroactively.Under Florida law, only "jurisprudential upheavals" will beapplied retroactively. 833 So. 2d, at 743 (internal quotationmarks omitted). The court stated that a "jurisprudentialupheaval is a major constitutional change of law." Id., at745 (internal quotation marks omitted). By contrast, any"evolutionary refinements" in the law "are not applied retro-actively."Id., at 744. The court then held that L. B. wasan evolutionary refinement in the law, and therefore Bunkleywas not entitled to relief. In a footnote, the Florida Su-preme Court cited our decision in Fiore v. White, supra, andheld without analysis that Fiore did not apply to this case.See 833 So. 2d, at 744, n. 12.**The dissent claims that the Florida Supreme Court did not need todecide anything other than whether L. B. was a change in the law. Seepost, at 845 (citing Fla. Rule Crim. Proc. 3.850(b)(2) (2000)). Yet as thedissent concedes, see post, at 843, the Florida Supreme Court passed uponthe Fiore due process inquiry as well as the retroactivity question. Thedissent also notes that Bunkley has raised the issue of the common pocketknife in prior appeals. These appeals, however, were filed prior to theFlorida Supreme Court's opinion in L. B. And we agree with the dissentthat absent the L. B. decision, Bunkley would not be able to pursue hisclaim now. The Florida Supreme Court committed an error of law hereby not addressing whether the L. B. decision means that at the time Bunk538US2 Unit: $U61 [10-27-04 17:24:21] PAGES PGT: OPIN839Cite as: 538 U. S. 835 (2003)Per CuriamJustice Pariente, joined by Chief Justice Anstead, dis-sented. She stated that the Florida Supreme Court's decision in L. B. "should be applied to grant Bunkley collateralrelief." 833 So. 2d, at 746. She criticized the majority opinion for relying solely on a retroactivity question. In herview, "application of the due process principles of Fiore renders a retroactivity analysis . . . unnecessary." Id., at 747.She noted that even ifL. B. was merely an evolutionary re-finement of the law, "the majority offers no precedent layingout the stages of this evolution." 833 So. 2d, at 747. Be-cause she thought the L. B. decision "correctly stated thelaw at the time Bunkley's conviction became final," shewould have vacated Bunkley's conviction. 833 So. 2d, at 747.IIFiore v. White involved a Pennsylvania criminal statutethat the Pennsylvania Supreme Court interpreted for thefirst time after the defendant Fiore's conviction became final.See 531 U. S., at 226. Under the Pennsylvania SupremeCourt's interpretation of the criminal statute, Fiore couldnot have been guilty of the crime for which he was convicted.See id., at 227-228. We originally granted certiorari inFiore to consider "when, or whether, the Federal Due Proc-ess Clause requires a State to apply a new interpretation ofa state criminal statute retroactively to cases on collateralreview." Id., at 226. "Because we were uncertain whetherthe Pennsylvania Supreme Court's decision . . . representeda change in the law," we certified a question to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. Id., at 228. This question askedwhether the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's interpretation ofthe statute " `state[d] the correct interpretation of the law ofPennsylvania at the date Fiore's conviction became final.' "Ibid.ley was convicted, he was convicted of a crime--armed burglary--forwhich he may not be guilty. Therefore, Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032(1983), has no applicability here.538US2 Unit: $U61 [10-27-04 17:24:21] PAGES PGT: OPIN840 BUNKLEY v. FLORIDAPer CuriamWhen the Pennsylvania Supreme Court replied that theruling " `merely clarified the plain language of the statute,' "ibid., the question on which we originally granted certioraridisappeared. Pennsylvania's answer revealed the "simple,inevitable conclusion" that Fiore's conviction violated dueprocess.Id., at 229. It has long been established by thisCourt that "the Due Process Clause . . . forbids a State toconvict a person of a crime without proving the elementsof that crime beyond a reasonable doubt."Id., at 228-229.Because Pennsylvania law--as interpreted by the later StateSupreme Court decision--made clear that Fiore's conductdid not violate an element of the statute, his conviction didnot satisfy the strictures of the Due Process Clause. Consequently, "retroactivity [was] not at issue." Id., at 226.Fiore controls the result here. As Justice Pariente statedin dissent, "application of the due process principles of Fiore"may render a retroactivity analysis "unnecessary." 833So. 2d, at 747. The question here is not just one of retroactivity. Rather, as Fiore holds, "retroactivity is not atissue" if the Florida Supreme Court's interpretation of the"common pocketknife" exception in L. B. is "a correct statement of the law when [Bunkley's] conviction became final."531 U. S., at 226. The proper question under Fiore is notwhether the law has changed. Rather, Fiore requires thatthe Florida Supreme Court answer whether, in light ofL. B., Bunkley's pocketknife of 21/2 to 3 inches fit within$ 790.001(13)'s "common pocketknife" exception at the timehis conviction became final.Although the Florida Supreme Court has determined thatthe L. B. decision was merely an "evolutionary refinement"in the meaning of the "common pocketknife" exception, it hasnot answered whether the law in 1989 defined Bunkley's 21/2-to 3-inch pocketknife as a "weapon" under $ 790.001(13). Although the L. B. decision might have "culminat[ed] . . . [the]century-long evolutionary process," the question remainsabout what $ 790.001(13) meant in 1989. 833 So. 2d, at 745.538US2 Unit: $U61 [10-27-04 17:24:21] PAGES PGT: OPIN841Cite as: 538 U. S. 835 (2003)Per CuriamIf Bunkley's pocketknife fit within the "common pocketknife"exception to $ 790.001(13) in 1989, then Bunkley was convicted of a crime for which he cannot be guilty--burglary inthe first degree. And if the "stages" of $ 790.001(13)'s "evolution" had not sufficiently progressed so that Bunkley'spocketknife was still a weapon in 1989, this case raises theissue left open in Fiore.It is true that the Florida Supreme Court held Fiore inap-plicable because theL. B. decision was a change in the lawwhich "culminat[ed] [the] century-long evolutionary process."833 So. 2d, at 745. As the dissent acknowledges, however,see post, at 843, n. 1, the Florida Supreme Court's decisionin L. B. cast doubt on the validity of Bunkley's conviction.For the first time, the Florida Supreme Court interpretedthe common pocketknife exception, and its interpretationcovered the weapon Bunkley possessed at the time of hisoffense. In the face of such doubt, Fiore entitles Bunkley toa determination as to whether L. B. correctly stated the common pocketknife exception at the time he was convicted.Ordinarily, the Florida Supreme Court's holding that L. B.constitutes a change in--rather than a clarification of--thelaw would be sufficient to dispose of the Fiore question. Byholding that a change in the law occurred, the Florida Supreme Court would thereby likewise have signaled that thecommon pocketknife exception was narrower at the timeBunkley was convicted.Here, however, the Florida Supreme Court said more. Itcharacterized L. B. as part of the "century-long evolutionaryprocess." 833 So. 2d, at 745. Because Florida law was in astate of evolution over the course of these many years, wedo not know what stage in the evolutionary process the lawhad reached at the time Bunkley was convicted. The Florida Supreme Court never asked whether the weapons statute had "evolved" by 1989 to such an extent that Bunkley's21/2- to 3-inch pocketknife fit within the "common pocketknife" exception. The proper question under Fiore is not538US2 Unit: $U61 [10-27-04 17:24:21] PAGES PGT: OPIN842 BUNKLEY v. FLORIDARehnquist, C. J., dissentingjust whether the law changed. Rather, it is when the lawchanged. The Florida Supreme Court has not answeredthis question; instead, it appeared to assume that merelylabelingL. B. as the "culmination" in the common pocketknife exception's "century-long evolutionary process" wassufficient to resolve theFiore question. 833 So. 2d, at 745.It is not. Without further clarification from the Florida Supreme Court as to the content of the common pocketknifeexception in 1989, we cannot know whetherL. B. correctlystated the common pocketknife exception at the time hewas convicted.On remand, the Florida Supreme Court should considerwhether, in light of theL. B. decision, Bunkley's pocketknifeof 21/2 to 3 inches fit within $ 790.001(13)'s "common pocketknife" exception at the time his conviction became final.The judgment of the Supreme Court of Florida, accordingly,is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedingsnot inconsistent with this opinion.
