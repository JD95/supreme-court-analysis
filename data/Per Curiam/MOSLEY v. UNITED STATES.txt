GARRISON et al.certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eleventh circuitNo. 97-1472. Argued November 10, 1998--Decided December 14, 1998Petitioner, an at-will employee, filed this action for damages against respondents alleging, inter alia, that they conspired to have him firedin retaliation for obeying a federal grand jury subpoena and to deterhim from testifying at their upcoming criminal trial for Medicarefraud, and that their acts had "injured [him] in his person or property" in violation of 42 U. S. C. $ 1985(2). In dismissing the suit forfailure to state a claim, the District Court relied on Circuit precedentholding that an at-will employee discharged pursuant to a conspiracyproscribed by $ 1985(2) has suffered no actual injury because he hasno constitutionally protected interest in continued employment. TheEleventh Circuit affirmed.Held: The sort of the harm alleged by petitioner--essentially third-partyinterference with at-will employment relationships--states a claim fordamages under $ 1985(2). In relevant part, the statute proscribes conspiracies to "deter, by force, intimidation, or threat, any . . . witness inany [federal] court . . . from attending such court, or from testifying toany matter pending therein, . . . or to injure [him] in his person orproperty on account of his having so attended or testified," $ 1985(2),and provides that if conspirators "do . . . any act in furtherance of . . .such conspiracy, whereby another is injured in his person or property, . . . the party so injured . . . may" recover damages, $ 1985(3).The Eleventh Circuit erred in concluding that petitioner must sufferan injury to a "constitutionally protected property interest" to state aclaim. Nothing in the language or purpose of the proscriptions in thefirst clause of $ 1985(2), nor in its attendant remedial provisions, establishes such a requirement. The gist of the wrong at which $ 1985(2) isdirected is not deprivation of property, but intimidation or retaliationagainst witnesses in federal-court proceedings. The terms "injured inhis person or property" define the harm that the victim may suffer as aresult of the conspiracy to intimidate or retaliate. Thus, the fact thatemployment at will is not "property" for purposes of the Due ProcessClause, see Bishop v. Wood, 426 U. S. 341, 345-347, does not mean thatloss of at-will employment may not "injur[e] [petitioner] in his personor property" for $ 1985(2)'s purposes. Such harm has long been, andremains, a compensable injury under tort law, and there is no reason to525US1 Unit: $$U8 [10-23-00 11:42:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN122 HADDLE v.

S. 121 (1998)Opinion of the CourtHealthmaster, Inc., and respondents Jeanette Garrison andDennis Kelly, officers of Healthmaster, with Medicare fraud.Petitioner cooperated with the federal agents in the investi-gation that preceded the indictment. He also appeared totestify before the grand jury pursuant to a subpoena, butdid not testify due to the press of time. Petitioner was alsoexpected to appear as a witness in the criminal trial resulting from the indictment.Although Garrison and Kelly were barred by the Bankruptcy Court from participating in the affairs of Health-master, they conspired with G. Peter Molloy, Jr., one of theremaining officers of Healthmaster, to bring about petitioner's termination. They did this both to intimidate petitioner and to retaliate against him for his attendance at thefederal-court proceedings.Petitioner sued for damages in the United States DistrictCourt for the Southern District of Georgia, asserting afederal claim under 42 U. S. C. $ 1985(2) and various statelaw claims. Petitioner stated two grounds for relief under$ 1985(2): one for conspiracy to deter him from testifyingin the upcoming criminal trial and one for conspiracy to retaliate against him for attending the grand jury proceedings.As $ 1985 demands, he also alleged that he had been "injured in his person or property" by the acts of respondentsin violation of $ 1985(2) and that he was entitled to recoverhis damages occasioned by such injury against respondentsjointly and severally.Respondents moved to dismiss for failure to state a claimupon which relief can be granted. Because petitioner conceded that he was an at-will employee, the District Courtgranted the motion on the authority of Morast v. Lance,807 F. 2d 926 (1987). In Morast, the Eleventh Circuit heldthat an at-will employee who is dismissed pursuant to aconspiracy proscribed by $ 1985(2) has no cause of action.The Morast court explained: "[T]o make out a cause of actionunder $ 1985(2) the plaintiff must have suffered an actual in525US1 Unit: $$U8 [10-23-00 11:42:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN124 HADDLE v. GARRISONOpinion of the Courtjury. Because Morast was an at will employee, . . . he had noconstitutionally protected interest in continued employment.Therefore, Morast's discharge did not constitute an actualinjury under this statute." Id., at 930. Relying on its decision in Morast, the Court of Appeals affirmed. Judgt. orderreported at 132 F. 3d 46 (1997).The Eleventh Circuit's rule in Morast conflicts with theholdings of the First and Ninth Circuits. SeeIrizarry v.Quiros, 722 F. 2d 869, 871 (CA1 1983), and Portman v.County of Santa Clara, 995 F. 2d 898, 909-910 (CA9 1993).We therefore granted certiorari, 523 U. S. 1136 (1998), todecide whether petitioner was "injured in his property orperson" when respondents induced his employer to terminate petitioner's at-will employment as part of a conspiracyprohibited by $ 1985(2).Section 1985(2), in relevant part, proscribes conspiraciesto "deter, by force, intimidation, or threat, any party or witness in any court of the United States from attending suchcourt, or from testifying to any matter pending therein,freely, fully, and truthfully, or to injure such party or wit-ness in his person or property on account of his having soattended or testified." 1 The statute provides that if one1 Section 1985(2) proscribes the following conspiracies: "If two or morepersons in any State or Territory conspire to deter, by force, intimidation,or threat, any party or witness in any court of the United States fromattending such court, or from testifying to any matter pending therein,freely, fully, and truthfully, or to injure such party or witness in his personor property on account of his having so attended or testified, or to influence the verdict, presentment, or indictment of any grand or petit jurorin any such court, or to injure such juror in his person or property onaccount of any verdict, presentment, or indictment lawfully assented toby him, or of his being or having been such juror; or if two or more persons conspire for the purpose of impeding, hindering, obstructing, or defeating, in any manner, the due course of justice in any State or Territory,with intent to deny to any citizen the equal protection of the laws, or toinjure him or his property for lawfully enforcing, or attempting to enforce,the right of any person, or class of persons, to the equal protection ofthe laws."525US1 Unit: $$U8 [10-23-00 11:42:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN125Cite as: 525 U. S. 121 (1998)Opinion of the Courtor more persons engaged in such a conspiracy "do, or causeto be done, any act in furtherance of the object of suchconspiracy, whereby another is injured in his person orproperty, . . . the party so injured . . . may have an actionfor the recovery of damages occasioned by such injury . . .against any one or more of the conspirators." $ 1985(3).2Petitioner's action was dismissed pursuant to Federal Ruleof Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) because, in the Eleventh Circuit'sview, he had not suffered an injury that could give rise toa claim for damages under $ 1985(2). We must, of course,assume that the facts as alleged in petitioner's complaint aretrue and that respondents engaged in a conspiracy prohibited by $ 1985(2). Our review in this case is accordingly con-fined to one question: Can petitioner state a claim for damages by alleging that a conspiracy proscribed by $ 1985(2)induced his employer to terminate his at-will employment?3We disagree with the Eleventh Circuit's conclusion thatpetitioner must suffer an injury to a "constitutionally protected property interest" to state a claim for damages under$ 1985(2). Nothing in the language or purpose of the proscriptions in the first clause of $ 1985(2), nor in its attendantremedial provisions, establishes such a requirement. Thegist of the wrong at which $ 1985(2) is directed is not depri-vation of property, but intimidation or retaliation againstwitnesses in federal-court proceedings. The terms "injuredin his person or property" define the harm that the victimmay suffer as a result of the conspiracy to intimidate or re-taliate. Thus, the fact that employment at will is not "prop2 Section 1985(3) contains the remedial provision granting a cause ofaction for damages to those harmed by any of the conspiracies prohibitedin $ 1985. See Kush v. Rutledge, 460 U. S. 719, 724-725 (1983) (listing thevarious conspiracies that $ 1985 prohibits).3 We express no opinion regarding respondents' argument that intimidation claims under $ 1985(2) are limited to conduct involving force orthreat of force, or their argument that only litigants, and not witnesses,may bring $ 1985(2) claims. We leave those issues for the courts below toresolve on remand.525US1 Unit: $$U8 [10-23-00 11:42:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN126 HADDLE v. GARRISONOpinion of the Courterty" for purposes of the Due Process Clause, see Bishop v.Wood, 426 U. S. 341, 345-347 (1976), does not mean that lossof at-will employment may not "injur[e] [petitioner] in hisperson or property" for purposes of $ 1985(2).We hold that the sort of harm alleged by petitionerhere--essentially third-party interference with at-will employment relationships--states a claim for relief under$ 1985(2). Such harm has long been a compensable injuryunder tort law, and we see no reason to ignore this traditionin this case. As Thomas Cooley recognized:"One who maliciously and without justifiable cause, in-duces an employer to discharge an employee, by meansof false statements, threats or putting in fear, or per-haps by means of malevolent advice and persuasion, isliable in an action of tort to the employee for the damages thereby sustained. And it makes no differencewhether the employment was for a fixed term not yetexpired or is terminable at the will of the employer."2 Law of Torts 589-591 (3d ed. 1906) (emphasis added).This Court also recognized in Truax v. Raich, 239 U. S. 33(1915):"The fact that the employment is at the will of the par-ties, respectively, does not make it one at the will ofothers. The employe' has manifest interest in the free-dom of the employer to exercise his judgment withoutillegal interference or compulsion and, by the weightof authority, the unjustified interference of third personsis actionable although the employment is at will."Id.,at 38 (citing cases).The kind of interference with at-will employment rela-tions alleged here is merely a species of the traditionaltorts of intentional interference with contractual relationsand intentional interference with prospective contractualrelations. See Restatement (Second) of Torts $ 766, Com525US1 Unit: $$U8 [10-23-00 11:42:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN127Cite as: 525 U. S. 121 (1998)Opinion of the Courtment g, pp. 10-11 (1977); see also id., $ 766B, Comment c,at 22. This protection against third-party interference withat-will employment relations is still afforded by state lawtoday. See W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen,Prosser and Keaton on Law of Torts $ 129, pp. 995-996, andn. 83 (5th ed. 1984) (citing cases). For example, the Stateof Georgia, where the acts underlying the complaint in thiscase took place, provides a cause of action against thirdparties for wrongful interference with employment relations.SeeGeorgia Power Co. v. Busbin, 242 Ga. 612, 613, 250 S. E.2d 442, 444 (1978) ("[E]ven though a person's employmentcontract is at will, he has a valuable contract right whichmay not be unlawfully interfered with by a third person");see also Troy v. Interfinancial, Inc., 171 Ga. App. 763, 766-769, 320 S. E. 2d 872, 877-879 (1984) (directed verdict inappropriate against defendant who procured plaintiff 's ter-mination for failure to lie at a deposition hearing).4 Thus,to the extent that the terms "injured in his person or prop-erty" in $ 1985 refer to principles of tort law, see 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 118 (1768)(describing the universe of common-law torts as "all privatewrongs, or civil injuries, which may be offered to the rightsof either a man's person or his property"), we find amplesupport for our holding that the harm occasioned by theconspiracy here may give rise to a claim for damages under$ 1985(2).The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, andthe case is remanded for further proceedings consistent withthis opinion.
