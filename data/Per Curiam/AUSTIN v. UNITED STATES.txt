Anthony Austin pleaded guilty to possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute and was sentenced to 151months' imprisonment. On appeal to the Fourth Circuit,Thomas Cochran, who had been appointed as Austin's counsel pursuant to the Criminal Justice Act of 1964, 18 U. S. C.$ 3006A, submitted a brief in accordance with Anders v. California, 386 U. S. 738 (1967). That brief raised the issue of513US1$$2z 11-22-96 14:32:27 PAGES OPINPGT6 AUSTIN v. UNITED STATESPer Curiamsentence computation, but concluded that no meritorious is-sues existed for appeal. The Fourth Circuit affirmed Austin's conviction and sentence. Cochran then informed Aus-tin of the right to petition for certiorari. Austin respondedwith a request to file a petition on his behalf. In advance ofthe deadline for filing the petition, Cochran applied to thisCourt for leave to withdraw as counsel. We grant hisapplication.The Criminal Justice Act directs each district court, withthe approval of the judicial council of the Circuit, to implement "a plan for furnishing representation for any personfinancially unable to obtain adequate representation." 18U. S. C. $ 3006A(a). The Fourth Circuit plan contains aprovision governing the duration of service by appointedcounsel. Specifically, it provides:"2. Appellate Counsel. Every attorney, including re-tained counsel, who represents a defendant in this courtshall continue to represent his client after terminationof the appeal unless relieved of further responsibilityby the Supreme Court. Where counsel has not beenrelieved:"If the judgment of this court is adverse to the defend-ant, counsel shall inform the defendant, in writing, of hisright to petition the Supreme Court for a writ of certio-rari. If the defendant, in writing, so requests, counselshall prepare and file a timely petition for such a writand transmit a copy to the defendant. Thereafter, unless otherwise instructed by the Supreme Court or itsclerk, or unless any applicable rule, order or plan of theSupreme Court shall otherwise provide, counsel shalltake whatever further steps are necessary to protect therights of the defendant, until the petition is granted ordenied." 4th Circuit Rules App. II, Rule V.2.Cochran argues that the Rule subjects him to conflicting ob-ligations. On the one hand, the Rule imposes a mandatoryduty to file a petition even if the legal arguments are frivo513US1$$2z 11-22-96 14:32:27 PAGES OPINPGT7Cite as: 513 U. S. 5 (1994)Per Curiamlous. On the other hand, this Court's Rule 42.2 allows anaward of damages or costs against him if he were to file afrivolous petition.As a matter of pure text, Cochran's interpretation is correct. The Fourth Circuit Rule does require the actions ofappointed counsel to comply with this Court's Rules, but onlyafter the filing of a petition for certiorari. The Rule imposes a very clear mandate to file petitions at the client'srequest, evidenced by the command "shall prepare and file."The Fourth Circuit keeps plenty of company in mandatingrepresentation through the certiorari process, even when itmay run counter to our Rules.1 Although the Fourth Circuit Rule provides a mechanism to seek relief from this obligation, Cochran is the first attorney to move for such relief,2indicating that counsel feel encouraged or perhaps bound bythese Rules to file petitions that rest on frivolous claims.These Circuit Rules may explain, in part, the dramaticallyincreased number of petitions for certiorari on direct appealfrom federal courts of appeals filed by persons in formapauperis.31 See D. C. Circuit Rules App. VIII, Rule IV ("The duties of representation by counsel on appeal, where the appeal has been unsuccessful, shallextend to advising the party of the right to file a petition for writ ofcertiorari . . . . If the party so requests, counsel shall prepare and filesuch a petition") (emphasis added); 3d Circuit Rules Addendum B, RuleIII.6 (same); 5th Circuit Rules App. C, Rule 4 (same); 7th Circuit RulesApp. II, Rule V.3 (same); 8th Circuit Rules App. Rule V (same); 9th CircuitRules App. A, $ 4(c) (same); 10th Circuit Rules Addendum I, Rule II.D(same); 11th Circuit Rules Addendum 4(f)(4) (same).2 Since this Court received Cochran's motion, another attorney has fileda petition for certiorari raising the same issue. Anderson v. UnitedStates, No. 94-5958.3 For the October 1983 Term, we received 523 petitions for certiorari ondirect review in criminal cases from in forma pauperis petitioners in federal courts. That number increased fourfold by the October 1993 Termwith 2,053 petitions. That increase stands in contrast with the increasein criminal petitions on direct review from state courts--an increase ofonly 50% in that same 10-year period.513US1$$2z 11-22-96 14:32:27 PAGES OPINPGT8 AUSTIN v. UNITED STATESPer CuriamConsistent with the Criminal Justice Act, we have pro-vided by Rule for the payment of counsel appointed by thisCourt to represent certain indigent defendants. See Rule39.7 ("In a case in which certiorari has been granted or jurisdiction has been noted or postponed, this Court may appointcounsel to represent a party financially unable to afford anattorney to the extent authorized by the Criminal JusticeAct of 1964, as amended, 18 U. S. C. $ 3006A"). But nothingin the Criminal Justice Act compels counsel to file papers incontravention of this Court's Rules against frivolous filings.And though indigent defendants pursuing appeals as of righthave a constitutional right to a brief filed on their behalf byan attorney, Anders v. California, supra, that right does notextend to forums for discretionary review. Ross v. Moffitt,417 U. S. 600, 616-617 (1974). Our Rules dealing with thegrounds for granting certiorari, and penalizing frivolous filings, apply equally to petitioners using appointed or retainedcounsel. We believe that the Circuit councils should, if necessary, revise their Criminal Justice Plans so that they donot create any conflict with our Rules. The plan shouldallow for relieving a lawyer of the duty to file a petition forcertiorari if the petition would present only frivolous claims.A few of the Circuits have adopted plans that accommodate this Court's Rules in some fashion. For instance, theFirst Circuit only requires appointed counsel to continuerepresentation at the Supreme Court level if "the personrequests it and there are reasonable grounds for counselproperly to do so." 1st Circuit Rule 46.5(c). If counsel determines a petition would be frivolous, he must inform theFirst Circuit and request leave to withdraw. See also 2dCircuit Rules App. A, Rule III.5. The Sixth Circuit takes adifferent tack, insulating counsel from violation of its Rules(though not, of course, from violation of our Rules) so longas he proceeds according to his best professional judgment,without resorting to the approval of the appellate court. Itsrecently amended Rule states: "Court appointed counsel is513US1$$2z 11-22-96 14:32:27 PAGES OPINPGT9Cite as: 513 U. S. 5 (1994)Per Curiamobligated to file a petition for a writ of certiorari in the Su-preme Court of the United States if the client requests thatsuch a review be sought and, in counsel's considered judg-ment, there are grounds for seeking Supreme Court review."6th Circuit Rule 12(f) (emphasis in original). We do not be-lieve that the Criminal Justice Act compels either approach.From an administrative point of view, however, we think aplan requiring approval of the court of appeals is preferable,because attorneys are more likely to avail themselves of thisavenue for relief if they have the endorsement of the courtto back up their own judgment.513us1$$3z 03-28-98 14:35:40 PAGES OPINPGT10 OCTOBER TERM, 1994SyllabusUNITED STATES v. SHABANIcertiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuitNo. 93-981. Argued October 3, 1994--Decided November 1, 1994Respondent Shabani was convicted of conspiracy to distribute cocaine inviolation of 21 U. S. C. $ 846 after the District Court refused to instructthe jury that proof of an overt act in furtherance of a narcotics conspiracy is required for conviction under $ 846. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that, under its precedent, the Government must proveat trial that a defendant has committed such an overt act.Held: In order to establish a violation of $ 846, the Government need notprove the commission of any overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy.The statute's plain language does not require an overt act, and such arequirement has not been inferred from congressional silence in otherconspiracy statutes, see, e. g., Nash v. United States, 229 U. S. 373.Thus, absent contrary indications, it is presumed that Congress intendedto adopt the common law definition of conspiracy, which "does not makethe doing of any act other than the act of conspiring a condition of liability," id., at 378. Moreover, since the general conspiracy statute and theconspiracy provision of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 bothrequire an overt act, it appears that Congress' choice in $ 846 was quitedeliberate. United States v. Felix, 503 U. S. 378, distinguished. WhileShabani correctly asserts that the law does not punish criminalthoughts, in a criminal conspiracy the criminal agreement itself is theactus reus. The rule of lenity cannot be invoked here, since the statuteis not ambiguous. Pp. 13-17.993 F. 2d 1419, reversed.O'Connor, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.Richard H.

S. 10 (1994)Opinion of the CourtJustice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.This case asks us to consider whether 21 U. S. C. $ 846, thedrug conspiracy statute, requires the Government to provethat a conspirator committed an overt act in furtherance ofthe conspiracy. We conclude that it does not.IAccording to the grand jury indictment, Reshat Shabaniparticipated in a narcotics distribution scheme in Anchorage,Alaska, with his girlfriend, her family, and other associates.Shabani was allegedly the supplier of drugs, which he arranged to be smuggled from California. In an undercoveroperation, federal agents purchased cocaine from distributors involved in the conspiracy.Shabani was charged with conspiracy to distribute cocainein violation of 21 U. S. C. $ 846. He moved to dismiss theindictment because it did not allege the commission of anovert act in furtherance of the conspiracy, which act, he ar-gued, was an essential element of the offense. The UnitedStates District Court for the District of Alaska, Hon. H. Rus-sel Holland, denied the motion, and the case proceeded totrial. At the close of evidence, Shabani again raised theissue and asked the court to instruct the jury that proof ofan overt act was required for conviction. The DistrictCourt noted that Circuit precedent did not require the allegation of an overt act in the indictment but did require proofof such an act at trial in order to state a violation of $ 846.Recognizing that such a result was "totally illogical," App.29, and contrary to the language of the statute, Judge Holland rejected Shabani's proposed jury instruction, id., at 36.The jury returned a guilty verdict, and the court sentencedShabani to 160 months' imprisonment.The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuitreversed. 993 F. 2d 1419 (1993). The court acknowledgedan inconsistency between its cases holding that an indictment under $ 846 need not allege an overt act and those re513us1$$3J 03-28-98 14:35:40 PAGES OPINPGT12 UNITED STATES v. SHABANIOpinion of the Courtquiring proof of such an act at trial, and it noted that thelatter cases "stand on weak ground." Id., at 1420. Nevertheless, the court felt bound by precedent and attempted toreconcile the two lines of cases. The Court of Appeals reasoned that, although the Government must prove at trialthat the defendant has committed an overt act in furtheranceof a narcotics conspiracy, the act need not be alleged in theindictment because " `[c]ourts do not require as detailed astatement of an offense's elements under a conspiracy countas under a substantive count.' "Id., at 1422, quoting UnitedStates v. Tavelman, 650 F. 2d 1133, 1137 (CA9 1981).Chief Judge Wallace wrote separately to point out that inno other circumstance could the Government refrain fromalleging in the indictment an element it had to prove at trial.He followed the Circuit precedent but invited the Court ofAppeals to consider the question en banc because the NinthCircuit, "contrary to every other circuit, clings to a problematic gloss on 21 U. S. C. $ 846, insisting, despite a completelack of textual support in the statute, that in order to convictunder this section the government must prove the commis-sion of an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy." 993F. 2d, at 1422 (concurring opinion). For reasons unknown,the Court of Appeals did not grant en banc review. Wegranted certiorari, 510 U. S. 1108 (1994), to resolve the con-flict between the Ninth Circuit and the 11 other Circuits thathave addressed the question, all of which have held that $ 846does not require proof of an overt act.**See United States v.

It provided: "Anyperson who attempts or conspires to commit any offensedefined in this title is punishable by imprisonment or fineor both which may not exceed the maximum punishmentprescribed for the offense, the commission of which wasthe object of the attempt or conspiracy."Id., at 1265. Asamended by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100-690, $ 6470(a), 102 Stat. 4377, the statute currently provides:"Any person who attempts or conspires to commit any offense defined in this subchapter shall be subject to the samepenalties as those prescribed for the offense, the commissionof which was the object of the attempt or conspiracy." 21U. S. C. $ 846. The language of neither version requires thatan overt act be committed to further the conspiracy, and wehave not inferred such a requirement from congressionalsilence in other conspiracy statutes. In Nash v. UnitedStates, 229 U. S. 373 (1913), Justice Holmes wrote, "[W]e cansee no reason for reading into the Sherman Act more thanwe find there,"id., at 378, and the Court held that an overtact is not required for antitrust conspiracy liability. Thesame reasoning prompted our conclusion inSinger v. UnitedStates, 323 U. S. 338 (1945), that the Selective Service Act"does not require an overt act for the offense of conspiracy."Id., at 340.Nash and Singer follow the settled principle of statutoryconstruction that, absent contrary indications, Congress intends to adopt the common law definition of statutory terms.SeeMolzof v.

SHABANIOpinion of the Courting of conspiracy "does not make the doing of any act otherthan the act of conspiring a condition of liability." Nash,supra, at 378; see also Collins v. Hardyman, 341 U. S. 651,659 (1951); Bannon v. United States, 156 U. S. 464, 468 (1895)("At common law it was neither necessary to aver nor provean overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy . . ."). Respondent contends that these decisions were rendered in a periodof unfettered expansion in the law of conspiracy, a periodwhich allegedly ended when the Court declared that "we willview with disfavor attempts to broaden the already pervasive and wide-sweeping nets of conspiracy prosecutions."Grunewald v. United States, 353 U. S. 391, 404 (1957) (citations omitted). Grunewald, however, was a statute of limitations case, and whatever exasperation with conspiracyprosecutions the opinion may have expressed in dictum sayslittle about the views of Congress when it enacted $ 846.As to those views, we find it instructive that the generalconspiracy statute, 18 U. S. C. $ 371, contains an explicit requirement that a conspirator "do any act to effect the objectof the conspiracy." In light of this additional element in thegeneral conspiracy statute, Congress' silence in $ 846 speaksvolumes. After all, the general conspiracy statute precededand presumably provided the framework for the more specific drug conspiracy statute. "Nash and Singer give Congress a formulary: by choosing a text modeled on $ 371, itgets an overt-act requirement; by choosing a text modeledon the Sherman Act, 15 U. S. C. $ 1, it dispenses with such arequirement." United States v. Sassi, 966 F. 2d 283, 284(CA7 1992). Congress appears to have made the choicequite deliberately with respect to $ 846; the same Congressthat passed this provision also enacted the Organized CrimeControl Act of 1970, Pub. L. 91-452, 84 Stat. 922, $ 802(a) ofwhich contains an explicit requirement that "one or more of[the conspirators] does any act to effect the object of such aconspiracy," id., at 936, codified at 18 U.

S. 10 (1994)Opinion of the CourtEarly opinions in the Ninth Circuit dealing with the drugconspiracy statute simply relied on our precedents interpreting the general conspiracy statute and ignored the textualvariations between the two provisions. SeeUnited Statesv. Monroe, 552 F. 2d 860, 862 (CA9), cert. denied, 431 U. S.972 (1977), citing United States v. Feola, 420 U. S. 671 (1975);United States v. Thompson, 493 F. 2d 305, 310 (CA9), cert.denied, 419 U. S. 834 (1974), citing United States v. Rabinowich, 238 U. S. 78, 86-88 (1915). Two other Courts of Appeals were led down the same path, see United States v.King, 521 F. 2d 61, 63 (CA10 1975); United States v. Hutchinson, 488 F. 2d 484, 490 (CA8 1973), but both subsequentlyrecognized the misstep and rejected their early interpretations, see United States v. Covos, 872 F. 2d 805, 810 (CA81989); United States v. Savaiano, 843 F. 2d 1280, 1294(CA10 1988).What the Ninth Circuit failed to recognize we now makeexplicit: In order to establish a violation of 21 U. S. C. $ 846,the Government need not prove the commission of any overtacts in furtherance of the conspiracy. United States v.Felix, 503 U. S. 378 (1992), is not to the contrary. In thatcase, an indictment under $ 846 alleged two overt acts whichhad formed the basis of the defendant's prior conviction forattempting to manufacture drugs. The defendant arguedthat the Government had violated the Double JeopardyClause and Grady v. Corbin, 495 U. S. 508 (1990), overruled,United States v. Dixon, 509 U. S. 688 (1993), by using evidence underlying the prior conviction "to prove an essentialelement of an offense" charged in the second prosecution.We held that the Double Jeopardy Clause did not bar theconspiracy charge. Justice Stevens, writing separately,thought that our double jeopardy discussion was unnecessarypartly because "there is no overt act requirement in the federal drug conspiracy statute," Felix, supra, at 392 (Stevens,J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). Shabaniargues that, by not responding to this point, the Court im513us1$$3J 03-28-98 14:35:40 PAGES OPINPGT16 UNITED STATES v. SHABANIOpinion of the Courtplicitly held that $ 846 requires proof of overt acts; otherwise,the double jeopardy discussion would have been merely advisory. The procedural history of Felix, however, belies thiscontention. The disputed evidence was offered not to proveovert acts qua overt acts, but to prove the existence of aconspiracy. The lower court in Felix noted that it was"mindful that 21 U. S. C. $ 846 does not require proof of anovert act . . . ." United States v. Felix, 926 F. 2d 1522, 1529,n. 7 (CA10 1991). Nevertheless, evidence of such acts raiseddouble jeopardy concerns because it "tended to show thecriminal agreement for the conspiracy," an indisputablyessential element of the offense. Ibid. Indeed, JusticeStevens also argued that "the overt acts did not establishan agreement between Felix and his co-conspirators."Felix, 503 U. S., at 392. In light of the lower court opinion,it is apparent that we rejected this point--rather than Justice Stevens' construction of $ 846--before reaching thedouble jeopardy issue. In any event, Shabani's strainedreading of Felix is of little consequence for precedential purposes, since "[q]uestions which `merely lurk in the record'are not resolved, and no resolution of them may be inferred."Illinois Bd. of Elections v. Socialist Workers Party, 440U. S. 173, 183 (1979), quoting Webster v. Fall, 266 U. S. 507,511 (1925).Shabani reminds us that the law does not punish criminalthoughts and contends that conspiracy without an overt actrequirement violates this principle because the offenseis predominantly mental in composition. The prohibitionagainst criminal conspiracy, however, does not punish merethought; the criminal agreement itself is the actus reus andhas been so viewed since Regina v. Bass, 11 Mod. 55, 88 Eng.Rep. 881, 882 (K. B. 1705) ("[T]he very assembling togetherwas an overt act"); see also Iannelli v. United States, 420U. S. 770, 777 (1975) ("Conspiracy is an inchoate offense, theessence of which is an agreement to commit an unlawful act")(citations omitted).513us1$$3J 03-28-98 14:35:40 PAGES OPINPGT17Cite as: 513 U. S. 10 (1994)Opinion of the CourtFinally, Shabani invokes the rule of lenity, arguing thatthe statute is unclear because it neither requires an overt actnor specifies that one is not necessary. The rule of lenity,however, applies only when, after consulting traditional canons of statutory construction, we are left with an ambiguousstatute. See,e. g., Beecham v. United States, 511 U. S. 368,374 (1994); Smith v. United States, 508 U. S. 223, 239-241(1993). That is not the case here. To require that Congressexplicitly state its intention not to adopt petitioner's readingwould make the rule applicable with the "mere possibility ofarticulating a narrower construction," id., at 239, a resultsupported by neither lenity nor logic.As the District Court correctly noted in this case, the plainlanguage of the statute and settled interpretive principlesreveal that proof of an overt act is not required to establisha violation of 21 U. S. C. $ 846. Accordingly, the judgmentof the Court of Appeals is
