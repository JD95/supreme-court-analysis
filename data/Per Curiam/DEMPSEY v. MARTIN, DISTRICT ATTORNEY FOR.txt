Pro se petitioner Dempsey seeks leave to proceed informa pauperis under Rule 39 of this Court. We deny thisrequest as frivolous pursuant to Rule 39.8. Dempsey is allowed until November 2, 1999, within which to pay the docketing fees required by Rule 38 and to submit his petition incompliance with this Court's Rule 33.1. We also direct theClerk not to accept any further petitions for certiorari orpetitions for extraordinary writs from Dempsey in noncriminal matters unless he first pays the docketing fee requiredby Rule 38 and submits his petitions in compliance withRule 33.1.Dempsey has abused this Court's certiorari and extraordinary writ processes. On October 5, 1992, we invoked Rule39.8 to deny Dempsey in forma pauperis status with respectto a petition for certiorari. See Dempsey v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 506 U. S. 810. At that time, Dempsey had filed11 petitions for certiorari and 1 petition for an extraordinarywrit, all of which were both frivolous and had been deniedwithout recorded dissent. Since that time, Dempsey hasfiled five petitions for certiorari, all of which were also frivolous and denied without recorded dissent. The instant peti528US1 Unit: $$U4 [08-17-00 07:59:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN8 DEMPSEY v. MARTINStevens, J., dissentingtion for certiorari thus brings Dempsey's total number offrivolous filings to 19.We enter the order barring prospective filings for the rea-sons discussed in Martin v. District of Columbia Court ofAppeals, 506 U. S. 1 (1992) (per curiam). Dempsey's abuseof the writ of certiorari and of the extraordinary writs hasbeen in noncriminal cases, and we limit our sanction accord-ingly. The order therefore will not prevent Dempsey frompetitioning to challenge criminal sanctions which might beimposed on him. The order will, however, allow this Courtto devote its limited resources to the claims of petitionerswho have not abused our processes.
