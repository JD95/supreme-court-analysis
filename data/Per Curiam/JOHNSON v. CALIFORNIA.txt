We granted certiorari in this case to review a decision ofthe Supreme Court of California interpretingBatson v.Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79 (1986). 540 U. S. 1045 (2003). Thecase was briefed and argued, but we now conclude that weare without jurisdiction in the matter.The California Supreme Court reversed the CaliforniaCourt of Appeal's decision reversing petitioner's conviction.30 Cal. 4th 1302, 71 P. 3d 270 (2003). The Court of Appealheld that petitioner was entitled to relief under People v.Wheeler, 22 Cal. 3d 258, 583 P. 2d 748 (1978), and Batson v.Kentucky, supra. 105 Cal. Rptr. 2d 727 (2001). It alsonoted petitioner's separate evidentiary and prosecutorialmisconduct claims, App. 87, but did not determine whetherthose claims would independently support reversal of pe-titioner's conviction. The California Supreme Court addressed only the Wheeler/Batson claim, and, after reversingon that ground, remanded "for further proceedings consistent with [its] opinion." 30 Cal. 4th, at 1328, 71 P. 3d, at 287.Under 28 U. S. C. $ 1257, our jurisdiction is limited to review of "[f]inal judgments or decrees rendered by the high-est court of a State in which a decision could be had." InCox Broadcasting Corp. v.

In a post-oralargument supplemental brief, petitioner argues that thefourth of these categories fits this case. That category involves situations"where the federal issue has been finally decided in thestate courts with further proceedings pending in whichthe party seeking review here might prevail on the merits on nonfederal grounds, thus rendering unnecessaryreview of the federal issue by this Court, and wherereversal of the state court on the federal issue would bepreclusive of any further litigation on the relevant causeof action rather than merely controlling the nature andcharacter of, or determining the admissibility of evi-dence in, the state proceedings still to come. In thesecircumstances, if a refusal immediately to review thestate-court decision might seriously erode federal policy,the Court has entertained and decided the federal issue,which itself has been finally determined by the statecourts for purposes of the state litigation." Id., at482-483.Here, petitioner can make no convincing claim of erosion offederal policy that is not common to all decisions rejecting adefendant's Batson claim. The fourth category thereforedoes not apply. SeeFlorida v. Thomas, 532 U. S. 774, 780(2001). "A contrary conclusion would permit the fourth ex-ception to swallow the rule."Flynt v. Ohio, 451 U. S. 619,622 (1981) (per curiam).The present case comes closest to fitting in the thirdCoxcategory, but ultimately falls outside of it. That categoryinvolves "those situations where the federal claim has beenfinally decided, with further proceedings on the merits in thestate courts to come, but in which later review of the federalissue cannot be had, whatever the ultimate outcome of thecase." Cox, supra, at 481. In the event that the California541US2 Unit: $U44 [05-08-06 20:36:17] PAGES PGT: OPIN431Cite as: 541 U. S. 428 (2004)Per CuriamCourt of Appeal on remand affirms the judgment of convic-tion, petitioner could once more seek review of hisBatsonclaim in the Supreme Court of California--albeit unsuccess-fully--and then seek certiorari on that claim from this Court.Compliance with the provisions of $ 1257 is an essentialprerequisite to our deciding the merits of a case brought hereunder that section. It is our obligation to raise any questionof such compliance on our own motion, even though counselhas not called our attention to it. See,e. g., Mansfield, C. &L. M. R. Co. v. Swan, 111 U. S. 379, 384 (1884). But as thepresent case illustrates, we are not always successful in policing this gatekeeping function without the aid of counsel.Part of the problem was that the California Court of Appeal's decision was certified by that court for partial publication. It addressed the Wheeler/Batson claim in the published portion. 105 Cal. Rptr. 2d 727 (2001). In theunpublished portion, the court briefly addressed petitioner'sevidentiary claims to provide guidance for the trial court onretrial, and noted that it would not address whether petitioner's objections were properly preserved or consider petitioner's prosecutorial misconduct claim. App. 58. Petitionerappended only the published portion of the California Courtof Appeal's decision to his petition for a writ of certiorari.This Court's Rule 14.1(i) instructs petitioners to include,inter alia, any "relevant opinions . . . entered in the case" inthe appendix to the petition for certiorari. The full opinionof the California Court of Appeal was not filed in this Courtuntil the joint appendix to the briefs on the merits was filed.App. 58-112. Had the full opinion been brought to thisCourt's attention, it might have been more evident to us thatthe Supreme Court of California's decision was not final forthe purposes of $ 1257.A petition for certiorari must demonstrate to this Courtthat it has jurisdiction to review the judgment. ThisCourt's Rule 14.1(g). And a respondent has a duty to "address any perceived misstatement of fact or law in the peti541US2 Unit: $U44 [05-08-06 20:36:17] PAGES PGT: OPIN432 JOHNSON v. CALIFORNIAPer Curiamtion that bears on what issues properly would be before theCourt if certiorari were granted." Rule 15.2. Our Rulesalso require that each party provide a statement for the basisof our jurisdiction in its brief on the merits. Rule 24.1(e).At all stages in this case, both parties represented that ourjurisdiction was proper pursuant to $ 1257(a). Pet. for Cert.1; Brief in Support 1; Brief for Petitioner 1; Brief forRespondent 1.It behooves counsel for both petitioner and respondent toassure themselves that the decision for which review issought is indeed a "[f]inal judgmen[t]" under $ 1257. Suchattention is mandated by our Rules and will avoid the expenditure of resources of both counsel and of this Court onan abortive proceeding such as the present one.We dismiss the case for want of jurisdiction.
