Under Florida law, after a defendant is found guilty of acapital felony, a separate sentencing proceeding is conductedto determine whether the sentence should be life imprison-ment or death. Fla. Stat. $ 921.141(1) (1991). At the closeof a hearing at which the prosecution and the defense maypresent evidence and argument in favor of and against thedeath penalty, ibid., the trial judge charges the jurors to con-sider "[w]hether sufficient aggravating circumstances exist,""[w]hether sufficient mitigating circumstances exist whichoutweigh the aggravating circumstances," and "[b]ased onthese considerations, whether the defendant should be sen-tenced to life imprisonment or death." $ 921.141(2). Theverdict does not include specific findings of aggravating andmitigating circumstances, but states only the jury's sentencing recommendation. "Notwithstanding the recommenda-tion of a majority of the jury," the trial court itself must then"weig[h] the aggravating and mitigating circumstances" todetermine finally whether the sentence will be life or death.$ 921.141(3). If the trial court fixes punishment at death, thecourt must issue a written statement of the circumstancesfound and weighed. Ibid.A Florida jury found petitioner Henry Jose Espinosaguilty of first-degree murder. At the close of the evidencein the penalty hearing, the trial court instructed the jury onaggravating factors. One of the instructions informed thejury that it was entitled to find as an aggravating factor thatthe murder of which it had found Espinosa guilty was "espe-cially wicked, evil, atrocious or cruel." See $ 921.141(h).The jury recommended that the trial court impose death, andthe court, finding four aggravating and two mitigating fac-tors, did so. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Florida,petitioner argued that the "wicked, evil, atrocious or cruel"instruction was vague and therefore left the jury with insufficient guidance when to find the existence of the aggravatingfactor. The court rejected this argument and affirmed, say505us3119Z 06-17-96 23:05:24 PAGES OPINPGT1081Cite as: 505 U. S. 1079 (1992)Per Curiaming: "We reject Espinosa's complaint with respect to the textof the jury instruction on the heinous, atrocious, or cruelaggravating factor upon the rationale of Smalley v. State,546 So. 2d 720 (Fla. 1989)." 589 So. 2d 887, 894 (1991).Our cases establish that, in a State where the sentencerweighs aggravating and mitigating circumstances, theweighing of an invalid aggravating circumstance violates theEighth Amendment. See Sochor v. Florida, 504 U. S. 527,532 (1992);Stringer v. Black, 503 U. S. 222, 232 (1992); Parker v. Dugger, 498 U. S. 308, 319-321 (1991); Clemons v. Mississippi, 494 U. S. 738, 752 (1990). Our cases further establish that an aggravating circumstance is invalid in this senseif its description is so vague as to leave the sentencer without sufficient guidance for determining the presence or absence of the factor. See Stringer, supra, at 235. We haveheld instructions more specific and elaborate than the onegiven in the instant case unconstitutionally vague. SeeShell v. Mississippi, 498 U. S. 1 (1990); Maynard v. Cartwright, 486 U. S. 356 (1988); Godfrey v. Georgia, 446 U. S.420 (1980).The State here does not argue that the "especially wicked,evil, atrocious or cruel" instruction given in this case wasany less vague than the instructions we found lacking inShell, Cartwright, or Godfrey. Instead, echoing the StateSupreme Court's reasoning in Smalley v. State, 546 So. 2d,at 722, the State argues that there was no need to instructthe jury with the specificity our cases have required wherethe jury was the final sentencing authority, because, in theFlorida scheme, the jury is not "the sentencer" for EighthAmendment purposes. This is true, the State argues, because the trial court is not bound by the jury's sentencingrecommendation; rather, the court must independently determine which aggravating and mitigating circumstancesexist, and, after weighing the circumstances, enter a sentence "[n]otwithstanding the recommendation of a majorityof the jury," Fla. Stat. $ 921.141(3).505us3119Z 06-17-96 23:05:24 PAGES OPINPGT1082 ESPINOSA v. FLORIDAPer CuriamOur examination of Florida case law indicates, however,that a Florida trial court is required to pay deference to ajury's sentencing recommendation, in that the trial courtmust give "great weight" to the jury's recommendation,whether that recommendation be life, see Tedder v. State,322 So. 2d 908, 910 (Fla. 1975), or death, see Smith v. State,515 So. 2d 182, 185 (Fla. 1987), cert. denied, 485 U. S. 971(1988); Grossman v. State, 525 So. 2d 833, 839, n. 1 (Fla. 1988),cert. denied, 489 U. S. 1071 (1989). Thus, Florida has essentially split the weighing process in two. Initially, the juryweighs aggravating and mitigating circumstances, and theresult of that weighing process is then in turn weighedwithin the trial court's process of weighing aggravating andmitigating circumstances.It is true that, in this case, the trial court did not directlyweigh any invalid aggravating circumstances. But, we mustpresume that the jury did so, see Mills v. Maryland, 486U. S. 367, 376-377 (1988), just as we must further presumethat the trial court followed Florida law, cf. Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639, 653 (1990), and gave "great weight" tothe resultant recommendation. By giving "great weight" tothe jury recommendation, the trial court indirectly weighedthe invalid aggravating factor that we must presume thejury found. This kind of indirect weighing of an invalid aggravating factor creates the same potential for arbitrarinessas the direct weighing of an invalid aggravating factor, cf.Baldwin v. Alabama, 472 U. S. 372, 382 (1985), and the result, therefore, was error.We have often recognized that there are many constitutionally permissible ways in which States may choose to allocate capital sentencing authority. See id., at 389; Spazianov. Florida, 468 U. S. 447, 464 (1984). Today's decision in noway signals a retreat from that position. We merely holdthat, if a weighing State decides to place capital sentencingauthority in two actors rather than one, neither actor mustbe permitted to weigh invalid aggravating circumstances.505us3119Z 06-17-96 23:05:25 PAGES OPINPGT1083Cite as: 505 U.
