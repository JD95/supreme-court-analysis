The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuitaffirmed the grant of habeas relief to respondent John Visciotti after concluding that he had been prejudiced by ineffec-tive assistance of counsel at trial. 288 F. 3d 1097 (2002).Because this decision exceeds the limits imposed on federalhabeas review by 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d), we reverse.IRespondent and a co-worker, Brian Hefner, devised a planto rob two fellow employees, Timothy Dykstra and MichaelWolbert, on November 8, 1982, their payday. They invitedthe pair to join them at a party. As the four were driving tothat supposed destination in Wolbert's car, respondent askedWolbert to stop in a remote area so that he could relievehimself. When all four men had left the car, respondentpulled a gun, demanded the victims' wallets (which turnedout to be almost empty), and got Wolbert to tell him wherein the car the cash was hidden. After Hefner had retrievedthe cash, respondent walked over to the seated Dykstra andkilled him with a shot in the chest from a distance of threeor four feet. Respondent then raised the gun in both handsand shot Wolbert three times, in the torso and left shoulder,and finally, from a distance of about two feet, in the left eye.Respondent and Hefner fled the scene in Wolbert's car.Wolbert miraculously survived to testify against them.Respondent was convicted by a California jury of firstdegree murder, attempted murder, and armed robbery, witha special-circumstance finding that the murder was committed during the commission of a robbery. The same jurydetermined that respondent should suffer death. The California Supreme Court affirmed the conviction and sentence.People v. Visciotti, 2 Cal. 4th 1, 825 P. 2d 388 (1992).537US1 Unit: $$U4 [04-14-04 18:59:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN21Cite as: 537 U. S. 19 (2002)Per CuriamRespondent filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus inthe California Supreme Court, alleging ineffective assistanceof counsel. That court appointed a referee to hold an evi-dentiary hearing and make findings of fact--after which, andafter briefing on the merits, it denied the petition in alengthy opinion.In re Visciotti, 14 Cal. 4th 325, 926 P. 2d987 (1996). The California Supreme Court assumed that respondent's trial counsel provided constitutionally inadequaterepresentation during the penalty phase, but concluded thatthis did not prejudice the jury's sentencing decision. Id., at353, 356-357, 926 P. 2d, at 1004, 1006.Respondent filed a federal habeas petition in the UnitedStates District Court for the Central District of California.That court determined that respondent had been denied ef-fective assistance of counsel during the penalty phase of histrial, and granted the habeas petition as to his sentence.The State appealed to the Court of Appeals for the NinthCircuit.The Court of Appeals correctly observed that a federalhabeas application can only be granted if it meets the requirements of 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d), which provides:"An application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf ofa person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a Statecourt shall not be granted with respect to any claim thatwas adjudicated on the merits in State court proceed-ings unless the adjudication of the claim--"(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or in-volved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Courtof the United States; or"(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding."The Court of Appeals found that the California SupremeCourt decision ran afoul of both the "contrary to" and the537US1 Unit: $$U4 [04-14-04 18:59:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN22 WOODFORD v. VISCIOTTIPer Curiam"unreasonable application" conditions of $ 2254(d)(1), and af-firmed the District Court's grant of relief. See 288 F. 3d, at1118-1119. The State of California petitioned for a writ ofcertiorari, which we now grant along with respondent's motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis.IIAWe consider first the Ninth Circuit's holding that the Cali-fornia Supreme Court's decision was "contrary to" our decision in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984).Strickland held that to prove prejudice the defendant mustestablish a "reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would havebeen different," id., at 694 (emphasis added); it specificallyrejected the proposition that the defendant had to prove itmore likely than not that the outcome would have been altered, id., at 693. The Court of Appeals read the State Su-preme Court opinion in this case as applying the latter test--as requiring respondent to prove, by a preponderance of theevidence, that the result of the sentencing proceedings wouldhave been different. See 288 F. 3d, at 1108-1109. That is,in our view, a mischaracterization of the state-court opinion,which expressed and applied the proper standard for evalu-ating prejudice.The California Supreme Court began its analysis of theprejudice inquiry by setting forth the "reasonable probability" criterion, with a citation of the relevant passage inStrickland; and it proceeded to state that "[t]he question wemust answer is whether there is a reasonable probabilitythat, but for counsel's errors and omissions, the sentencingauthority would have found that the balance of aggravatingand mitigating factors did not warrant imposition of thedeath penalty," again with a citation of Strickland. In reVisciotti, 14 Cal. 4th, at 352, 926 P. 2d, at 1003 (citing Strickland, supra, at 696). Twice, the court framed its inquiry as537US1 Unit: $$U4 [04-14-04 18:59:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN23Cite as: 537 U. S. 19 (2002)Per Curiamturning on whether there was a "reasonable probability" thatthe sentencing jury would have reached a more favorablepenalty-phase verdict. 14 Cal. 4th, at 352, 353, 926 P. 2d, at1003, 1004. The following passage, moreover, was central tothe California Supreme Court's analysis:"In In re Fields, . . . we addressed the process by whichthe court assesses prejudice at the penalty phase of acapital trial at which counsel was, allegedly, incompetentin failing to present mitigating evidence: `What kind ofevidentiary showing will undermine confidence in theoutcome of a penalty trial that has resulted in a deathverdict?Strickland . . . and the cases it cites offersome guidance. United States v. Agurs . . . , the firstcase cited by Strickland, spoke of evidence which raiseda reasonable doubt, although not necessarily of suchcharacter as to create a substantial likelihood ofacquittal. . . .United States v. Valenzuela-Bernal . . . ,the second case cited by Strickland, referred to evi-dence which is "material and favorable . . . in ways notmerely cumulative. . . ." ' " Id., at 353-354, 926 P. 2d,at 1004."Undermin[ing] confidence in the outcome" is exactly Strickland's description of what is meant by the "reasonable probability" standard. "A reasonable probability is a probabilitysufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome."Strickland, supra, at 694.Despite all these citations of, and quotations from,Strickland, the Ninth Circuit concluded that the California Su-preme Court had held respondent to a standard of proofhigher than what that case prescribes for one reason: inthree places (there was in fact a fourth) the opinion used theterm "probable" without the modifier "reasonably." 288 F.3d, at 1108-1109, and n. 11. This was error. The CaliforniaSupreme Court's opinion painstakingly describes the Strickland standard. Its occasional shorthand reference to that537US1 Unit: $$U4 [04-14-04 18:59:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN24 WOODFORD v. VISCIOTTIPer Curiamstandard by use of the term "probable" without the modifiermay perhaps be imprecise, but if so it can no more be considered a repudiation of the standard than can this Court's ownoccasional indulgence in the same imprecision. See Mickens v. Taylor, 535 U. S. 162, 166 (2002) ("probable effect uponthe outcome"); Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 393 (2000)("probably affected the outcome").The Court of Appeals made no effort to reconcile the statecourt's use of the term "probable" with its use, elsewhere,ofStrickland's term "reasonably probable," nor did it evenacknowledge, much less discuss, the California SupremeCourt's proper framing of the question as whether the evi-dence "undermines confidence" in the outcome of the sentencing proceeding. This readiness to attribute error is in-consistent with the presumption that state courts know andfollow the law. See, e. g., Parker v. Dugger, 498 U. S. 308,314-316 (1991); Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639, 653 (1990),overruled on other grounds, Ring v. Arizona, 536 U. S.584 (2002);LaVallee v. Delle Rose, 410 U. S. 690, 694-695(1973) (per curiam). It is also incompatible with $ 2254(d)'s"highly deferential standard for evaluating state-court rul-ings," Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U. S. 320, 333, n. 7 (1997), whichdemands that state-court decisions be given the benefit ofthe doubt.BThe Court of Appeals also held that, regardless of whetherthe California Supreme Court applied the proper standardfor determining prejudice under Strickland, its decision in-volved an unreasonable application of our clearly establishedprecedents. 288 F. 3d, at 1118. Specifically, the Ninth Cir-cuit concluded that the determination that Visciotti sufferedno prejudice as a result of his trial counsel's deficiencies was"objectively unreasonable."Ibid. Under $ 2254(d)'s "un-reasonable application" clause, a federal habeas court maynot issue the writ simply because that court concludes in itsindependent judgment that the state-court decision applied537US1 Unit: $$U4 [04-14-04 18:59:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN25Cite as: 537 U. S. 19 (2002)Per CuriamStrickland incorrectly. See Bell v. Cone, 535 U. S. 685, 698-699 (2002); Williams, supra, at 411. Rather, it is the habeasapplicant's burden to show that the state court appliedStrickland to the facts of his case in an objectively unreasonable manner. An "unreasonable application of federal lawis different from an incorrect application of federal law."Williams, supra, at 410; see Bell, supra, at 694. The NinthCircuit did not observe this distinction, but ultimately substituted its own judgment for that of the state court, in contravention of 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d).The Ninth Circuit based its conclusion of "objective unreasonableness" upon its perception (1) that the California Supreme Court failed to "take into account" the totality of theavailable mitigating evidence, and "to consider" the prejudicial impact of certain of counsel's actions, and (2) that the"aggravating factors were not overwhelming." 288 F. 3d, at1118. There is no support for the first of these contentions.All of the mitigating evidence, and all of counsel's prejudicialactions, that the Ninth Circuit specifically referred to as having been left out of account or consideration were in factdescribed in the California Supreme Court's lengthy andcareful opinion. The Court of Appeals asserted that theCalifornia Supreme Court "completely ignored the mitigating effect of Visciotti's brain damage," and failed to considerthe prejudicial effect of counsel's "multiple concessions during closing argument." Ibid. However, the California Supreme Court specifically considered the fact that an expert"had testified at the guilt phase that [Visciotti] had a minimalbrain injury of a type associated with impulse disorder andlearning disorder." In re Visciotti, 14 Cal. 4th, at 354, 926P. 2d, at 1004. And it noted that under the trial court's instructions, this and other evidence that had been introduced"might have been considered mitigating at the penaltyphase," despite trial counsel's concessions during closingargument. Ibid.537US1 Unit: $$U4 [04-14-04 18:59:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN26 WOODFORD v. VISCIOTTIPer CuriamThe California Supreme Court then focused on counsel'sfailure to introduce mitigating evidence about respondent'sbackground, including expert testimony that could have beenpresented about his "growing up in a dysfunctional family inwhich he suffered continual psychological abuse." Id., at355, 926 P. 2d, at 1005. This discussion referred back to alengthy, detailed discussion about the undiscovered mitigating evidence that trial counsel might have presented duringthe penalty phase. Seeid., at 341-345, 926 P. 2d, at 996-998.The California Supreme Court concluded that despite thefailure to present evidence of respondent's "troubled familybackground," id., at 355, 926 P. 2d, at 1005, which includedhis being "berated," being "markedly lacking in self-esteemand depressed," having been "born with club feet," having"feelings of inadequacy, incompetence, inferiority," and thelike, moving "20 times" while he was growing up, and possibly suffering a "seizure disorder," id., at 341-343, 926 P. 2d,at 996-998, the aggravating factors were overwhelming. Inthe state court's judgment, the circumstances of the crime (acold-blooded execution-style killing of one victim and attempted execution-style killing of another, both during thecourse of a preplanned armed robbery) coupled with the aggravating evidence of prior offenses (the knifing of one man,and the stabbing of a pregnant woman as she lay in bed trying to protect her unborn baby) was devastating. See id.,at 355, 926 P. 2d, at 1005; see also People v. Visciotti, 2 Cal.4th, at 33-34, 825 P. 2d, at 402. The California SupremeCourt found these aggravating factors to be so severe thatit concluded respondent suffered no prejudice from trialcounsel's (assumed) inadequacy. In re Visciotti, supra, at355, 926 P. 2d, at 1005.The Court of Appeals disagreed with this assessment, suggesting that the fact that the jury deliberated for a full dayand requested additional guidance on the meaning of "moraljustification" and "extreme duress" meant that the "aggravating factors were not overwhelming." 288 F. 3d, at 1118.537US1 Unit: $$U4 [04-14-04 18:59:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN27Cite as: 537 U. S. 19 (2002)Per CuriamPerhaps so. However, "under $ 2254(d)(1), it is not enoughto convince a federal habeas court that, in its independentjudgment, the state-court decision applied Strickland incor-rectly." Bell, 535 U. S., at 699. The federal habeas schemeleaves primary responsibility with the state courts for thesejudgments, and authorizes federal-court intervention onlywhen a state-court decision is objectively unreasonable. Itis not that here. Whether or not we would reach the sameconclusion as the California Supreme Court, "we think at thevery least that the state court's contrary assessment was not`unreasonable.' " Id., at 701. Habeas relief is therefore notpermissible under $ 2254(d).* * *The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir-cuit is
