IRespondent Jessie Jackson was tried in 1987 by the Stateof Tennessee for the murder of James Crawley. The Stateasserted that he had shot Crawley after an argument overdrugs. Its principal evidence at trial was the eyewitnesstestimony of Jonathan Hughes, who claimed to have been atthe scene with his girlfriend Melissa Gooch when the shooting occurred. Gooch did not testify. The jury convicted,and respondent was sentenced to life imprisonment.After unsuccessfully moving for a new trial, respondentsought state postconviction relief, alleging, inter alia, thathis trial counsel had been ineffective in failing to conduct anadequate investigation. See Strickland v. Washington, 466U. S. 668 (1984). The state court held an evidentiary hearing and then denied the petition, finding that counsel's performance was not deficient and that, in any event, respondentsuffered no prejudice. Respondent then filed a "Motion forHearing in Nature of Motion for New Trial," alleging newlydiscovered evidence. He claimed for the first time--sevenyears after his conviction--that Gooch would now testifythat, contrary to Hughes' trial testimony, she was not with542US2 Unit: $U78 [10-26-06 13:23:21] PAGES PGT: OPIN651Cite as: 542 U. S. 649 (2004)Per CuriamHughes on the night of the shooting. The state court deniedthis motion, and respondent appealed both rulings to theTennessee Court of Criminal Appeals.That court affirmed. It upheld the denial of new trial,observing that respondent had already filed an earlier suchmotion, that there was "no satisfactory reason given for thedefendant's failure to locate this witness" during the sevenyears that had elapsed, and that the proposed testimony"would serve merely to impeach Hughes' memory about having seen [Gooch] that night." App. to Pet. for Cert. 88. Italso affirmed the denial of postconviction relief, noting thatthere had never "been any showing on the record of favorable testimony that would have been elicited" from Goochhad counsel interviewed her, and that even crediting respondent's "unsubstantiated pleading," "it in no way risesto the level of contradicting what Hughes claims to haveseen" respecting the shooting itself. Id., at 96-97 (emphasis added).Respondent then sought federal habeas relief, and the District Court granted the State's motion for summary judgment. It found that there had been ineffective assistance ofcounsel, noting several shortcomings and opining that therewas a reasonable probability of prejudice. It observed,however, that it could grant relief only if the state court'sadjudication of respondent's claim was "contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly establishedFederal law." 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d)(1). It concluded that thestate court's application of Strickland, while erroneous, wasnot unreasonable.The Sixth Circuit reversed. 80 Fed. Appx. 392 (2003).Although it found a number of flaws in counsel's performance, its grant of relief under $ 2254(d)(1) was based on onlytwo specific grounds: first, that the state court had unreasonably applied Strickland, given that Gooch's statement undermined the credibility of Hughes' testimony; and second, thatthe state court's opinion was contrary to Strickland because542US2 Unit: $U78 [10-26-06 13:23:21] PAGES PGT: OPIN652 HOLLAND v. JACKSONPer Curiamit assessed prejudice under a preponderance-of-the-evidencestandard rather than a reasonable-probability standard.We now grant the State's petition for a writ of certiorariand respondent's motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis, and reverse.IIAThe Sixth Circuit erred in finding the state court's application of Strickland unreasonable on the basis of evidence notproperly before the state court. Although the state courthad ventured that it would deny relief on the merits eventaking Gooch's statement into account, its judgment alsorested on the holding that the statement was not properlybefore it. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 86-89, 95-98. Granting relief in disregard of this independent basis for decisionwas error.The "unreasonable application" clause of $ 2254(d)(1) applies when the "state court identifies the correct governinglegal principle from this Court's decisions but unreasonablyapplies that principle to the facts of the prisoner's case."Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 413 (2000). In this andrelated contexts we have made clear that whether a statecourt's decision was unreasonable must be assessed in lightof the record the court had before it. See Yarborough v.Gentry, 540 U. S. 1, 6 (2003) (per curiam) (denying reliefwhere state court's application of federal law was "supportedby the record"); Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U. S. 322, 348(2003) (reasonableness of state court's factual finding assessed "in light of the record before the court"); cf. Bell v.Cone, 535 U. S. 685, 697, n. 4 (2002) (declining to considerevidence not presented to state court in determiningwhether its decision was contrary to federal law).Under the habeas statute, Gooch's statement could havebeen the subject of an evidentiary hearing by the DistrictCourt, but only if respondent was not at fault in failing to542US2 Unit: $U78 [10-26-06 13:23:21] PAGES PGT: OPIN653Cite as: 542 U. S. 649 (2004)Per Curiamdevelop that evidence in state court, or (if he was at fault)if the conditions prescribed by $ 2254(e)(2) were met. SeeWilliams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 420, 431-437 (2000). Thosesame restrictions apply a fortiori when a prisoner seeks relief based on new evidence without an evidentiary hearing.See, e. g., Cargle v. Mullin, 317 F. 3d 1196, 1209 (CA10 2003),and cases cited. Where new evidence is admitted, someCourts of Appeals have conducted de novo review on thetheory that there is no relevant state-court determination towhich one could defer. See, e. g., Monroe v. Angelone, 323F. 3d 286, 297-299, and n. 19 (CA4 2003). Assuming, arguendo, that this analysis is correct and that it applies where,as here, the evidence does not support a new claim butmerely buttresses a previously rejected one, it cannot support the Sixth Circuit's action.The District Court made no finding that respondent hadbeen diligent in pursuing Gooch's testimony (and thus that$ 2254(e)(2) was inapplicable) or that the limitations set forthin $ 2254(e)(2) were met. Nor did the Sixth Circuit independently inquire into these matters; it simply ignored entirely the state court's independent ground for its decision,that Gooch's statement was not properly before it. It is difficult to see, moreover, how respondent could claim due diligence given the 7-year delay. He complains that his statepostconviction counsel did not heed his pleas for assistance.See App. to Pet. for Cert. 65. Attorney negligence, however, is chargeable to the client and precludes relief unlessthe conditions of $ 2254(e)(2) are satisfied. See Williams,supra, at 439-440; cf. Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722,753-754 (1991).The Sixth Circuit therefore erred in finding the statecourt's decision an unreasonable application of Strickland.**We reject respondent's contention that the State failed adequately topreserve this error. See, e. g., Final Brief for Appellee in No. 01-5720(CA6), p. 18, and n. 3.542US2 Unit: $U78 [10-26-06 13:23:21] PAGES PGT: OPIN654 HOLLAND v. JACKSONPer CuriamBThe Sixth Circuit also erred in holding that the state courtacted contrary to federal law by requiring proof of prejudiceby a preponderance of the evidence rather than by a reason-able probability. The state court began by reciting the correct Strickland standard:" `[T]he defendant must show that there is a reasonableprobability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.' " App. to Pet. forCert. 95 (quoting Strickland, 466 U. S., at 694).The Sixth Circuit nevertheless concluded that the state courthad actually applied a preponderance standard, based onthree subsequent passages from its opinion.First was the statement that "[i]n a post-conviction proceeding, the defendant has the burden of proving his allega-tions by a preponderance of the evidence." App. to Pet. forCert. 95. In context, however, this statement is reasonablyread as addressing the general burden of proof in postconviction proceedings with regard to factual contentions--for ex-ample, those relating to whether defense counsel's performance was deficient. Although it is possible to read it asreferring also to the question whether the deficiency wasprejudicial, thereby supplanting Strickland, such a readingwould needlessly create internal inconsistency in the opinion.Second was the statement that "it is asking too much thatwe draw the inference that the jury would not have believedHughes at all had Melissa Gooch testified." App. to Pet. forCert. 96. Although the Court of Appeals evidently thoughtthat this passage intimated a preponderance standard, it isdifficult to see why. The quoted language does not implyany particular standard of probability.Last was the statement that respondent had "failed tocarry his burden of proving that the outcome of the trial542US2 Unit: $U78 [10-26-06 13:23:21] PAGES PGT: OPIN655Cite as: 542 U. S. 649 (2004)Per Curiamwould probably have been different but for those errors."Id., at 98. We have held that such use of the unadornedword "probably" is permissible shorthand when the completeStrickland standard is elsewhere recited. See Woodford v.Visciotti, 537 U. S. 19, 23-24 (2002) (per curiam).As we explained in Visciot ti, $ 2254(d) requires that"state-court decisions be given the benefit of the doubt."Id., at 24. "[R]eadiness to attribute error is inconsistentwith the presumption that state courts know and follow thelaw." Ibid. The Sixth Circuit ignored those prescriptions.* * *The judgment of the Sixth Circuit is reversed, and the caseis remanded for further proceedings consistent with thisopinion.
