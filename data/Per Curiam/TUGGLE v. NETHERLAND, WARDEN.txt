In Zant v. Stephens, 462 U. S. 862 (1983), we held that adeath sentence supported by multiple aggravating circumstances need not always be set aside if one aggravator isfound to be invalid. Id., at 886-888. We noted that ourholding did not apply in States in which the jury is instructedto weigh aggravating circumstances against mitigating circumstances in determining whether to impose the death pen-alty. Id., at 874, n. 12, 890. In this case, the Virginia Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals for the Fourth CircuitconstruedZant as establishing a rule that in nonweighingStates a death sentence may be upheld on the basis of onevalid aggravating circumstance, regardless of the reasons forwhich another aggravating factor may have been found to beinvalid. Because this interpretation of our holding in Zantis incorrect, we now grant the motion for leave to proceedin forma pauperis and the petition for a writ of certiorariand vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals.IPetitioner Tuggle was convicted of murder in Virginiastate court. At his sentencing hearing, the Commonwealthpresented unrebutted psychiatric testimony that petitionerdemonstrated " `a high probability of future dangerousness.' "Tuggle v.

Oklahoma, 470 U. S. 68 (1985), that when the prosecutor presentspsychiatric evidence of an indigent defendant's future dangerousness in a capital sentencing proceeding, due processrequires that the State provide the defendant with the assistance of an independent psychiatrist. Id., at 83-84. Be-cause petitioner had been denied such assistance, we vacatedthe State Supreme Court's judgment and remanded forfurther consideration in light ofAke. Tuggle v. Virginia,471 U. S. 1096 (1985).On remand, the Virginia Supreme Court invalidated thefuture dangerousness aggravating circumstance because ofthe Ake error. See Tuggle v. Commonwealth, 230 Va., at108-111, 334 S. E. 2d, at 844-846. The court neverthelessreaffirmed petitioner's death sentence, reasoning that Zantpermitted the sentence to survive on the basis of the vilenessaggravator. 230 Va., at 110-111, 334 S. E. 2d, at 845-846.The Court of Appeals agreed with this analysis on federalhabeas review, Tuggle v. Thompson, 57 F. 3d 1356, 1362-1363(CA4 1995), as it had in the past.2 Quoting the VirginiaSupreme Court, the Court of Appeals stated:" `When a jury makes separate findings of specific statu-tory aggravating circumstances, any of which could support a sentence of death, and one of the circumstances1 Virginia's capital punishment statute involves a two-stage determination. The jury first decides whether the prosecutor has established oneor both of the statutory aggravating factors. Va. Code Ann. $$ 19.2-264.4(C)-(D) (1995). If the jury finds neither aggravator satisfied, it mustimpose a sentence of life imprisonment. Ibid. If the jury finds one orboth of the aggravators established, however, it has full discretion to impose either a death sentence or a sentence of life imprisonment. Ibid.2 See Smith v. Procunier, 769 F. 2d 170, 173 (CA4 1985).516us1$$2Z 09-08-97 16:49:21 PAGES OPINPGT13Cite as: 516 U.

E. 2d, at 845,and citing Zant, supra).IIOur opinion in Zant stressed that the evidence offered toprove the invalid aggravator was "properly adduced at thesentencing hearing and was fully subject to explanation bythe defendant." 462 U. S., at 887. As we explained:"[I]t is essential to keep in mind the sense in which [thestricken] aggravating circumstance is `invalid.' . . .[T]he invalid aggravating circumstance found by thejury in this case was struck down . . . because the Georgia Supreme Court concluded that it fails to provide anadequate basis for distinguishing a murder case in whichthe death penalty may be imposed from those cases inwhich such a penalty may not be imposed. The underlying evidence is nevertheless fully admissible at thesentencing phase." Id., at 885-886 (internal citationsomitted).Zant was thus predicated on the fact that even after elimina-tion of the invalid aggravator, the death sentence rested onfirm ground. Two unimpeachable aggravating factors re-mained and there was no claim that inadmissible evidencewas before the jury during its sentencing deliberations orthat the defendant had been precluded from adducing relevant mitigating evidence.In this case, the record does not provide comparable support for petitioner's death sentence. The Ake error pre-vented petitioner from developing his own psychiatric evidence to rebut the Commonwealth's evidence and to enhancehis defense in mitigation. As a result, the Commonwealth'spsychiatric evidence went unchallenged, which may have un-fairly increased its persuasiveness in the eyes of the jury.516us1$$2Z 09-08-97 16:49:21 PAGES OPINPGT14 TUGGLE v. NETHERLANDScalia, J., concurringWe may assume, as the Virginia Supreme Court and Courtof Appeals found, that petitioner's psychiatric evidencewould not have influenced the jury's determination concern-ing vileness. Nevertheless, the absence of such evidencemay well have affected the jury's ultimate decision, based onall of the evidence before it, to sentence petitioner to deathrather than life imprisonment.Although our holding inZant supports the conclusion thatthe invalidation of one aggravator does not necessarily require that a death sentence be set aside, that holding doesnot support the quite different proposition that the existenceof a valid aggravator always excuses a constitutional errorin the admission or exclusion of evidence. The latter circumstance is more akin to the situation in Johnson v. Mississippi, 486 U. S. 578 (1988), in which we held that Zantdoes not apply to support a death sentence imposed by a jurythat was allowed to consider materially inaccurate evidence,486 U. S., at 590, than to Zant itself. Because the Courtof Appeals misapplied Zant in this case, its judgment mustbe vacated.IIIHaving found no need to remedy the Ake error in petition-er's sentencing, the Virginia Supreme Court did not considerwhether, or by what procedures, the sentence might be sus-tained or reimposed; and neither the state court nor theCourt of Appeals addressed whether harmless-error analysisis applicable to this case. Because this Court customarilydoes not address such an issue in the first instance, we vacatethe judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the casefor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
