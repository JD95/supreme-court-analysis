Applicant asks that we vacate a stay of execution grantedTuggle by the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. Because we agree with applicant that the stay was improvi-dently entered, we grant his application to vacate, providedthat the stay shall remain in effect until September 20, 1995,to allow Tuggle's counsel opportunity to seek a further stayin this Court.On June 29, 1995, the Court of Appeals issued an opinionvacating the District Court's grant of habeas relief, findingall of Tuggle's constitutional claims to be without merit.Tuggle v. Thompson, 57 F. 3d 1356. The court stayed theissuance of its mandate on August 2, however, and grantedTuggle a 30-day stay of execution pending the filing of atimely petition for certiorari in this Court; then on August515us3$93z 07-18-97 21:14:30 PAGES OPINPGT952 NETHERLAND v. TUGGLEStevens, J., dissenting25 it extended the stay of execution for the full 90 daysallowed to file a certiorari petition in this Court.Both actions of the court were taken by summary orderwithout opinion or discussion. Nothing indicates that theCourt of Appeals even attempted to undertake the threepart inquiry required by our decision in Barefoot v. Estelle,463 U. S. 880, 895-896 (1983). See alsoMaggio v. Williams,464 U. S. 46, 48 (1983) (per curiam); Autry v. Estelle, 464U. S. 1, 2-3 (1983)(per curiam). There is no hint that thecourt found that "four Members of th[is] Court would con-sider the underlying issue sufficiently meritorious for thegrant of certiorari" or that "a significant possibility of rever-sal" existed.Barefoot, supra, at 895. We think the inescapable conclusion is that the Court of Appeals mistakenlybelieved that a capital defendant as a matter of right wasentitled to a stay of execution until he has filed a petition forcertiorari in due course. But this view was rejected inAutry, supra, at 2, and Maggio, supra, at 48.Accordingly, the application to vacate the stay of executionis granted.Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins,dissenting.Because there is no support in the record for the conclusion that the Court of Appeals abused its discretion when itgranted a stay of execution to enable respondent Tuggle tofile a petition for certiorari, I respectfully dissent. The factthat the respondent has substantial grounds for challengingthe constitutionality of his death sentence is demonstratedboth by the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus by the District Court and by the 19-page opinion filed by the Court ofAppeals. Tuggle v. Thompson, 57 F. 3d 1356 (CA4 1995).Promptly after that opinion was announced, respondent fileda motion for a stay of execution supported by an explanationof why "the three-part inquiry," ante this page, described inBarefoot v. Estelle, 463 U. S. 880, 895-896 (1983), warranted515us3$93z 07-18-97 21:14:30 PAGES OPINPGT953Cite as: 515 U. S. 951 (1995)Stevens, J., dissentingthat relief. It is disrespectful to the Court of Appeals toassume that its grant of that motion did not implicitly endorse the reasoning in respondent's moving papers.The stay of execution would merely have given respondentthe opportunity to seek the review in this Court that hasbeen authorized by Congress and our Rules. In my opinionit is both unwise and unfair to require a death row inmatewho has acted diligently at all stages of his litigation to prepare and file a petition raising substantial claims morepromptly than other litigants. I would deny the warden'sapplication.Justice Souter would deny the application to vacate stayof execution.Justice Breyer, for reasons stated in the first paragraphofJustice Stevens' dissent, votes to deny the application.08-10-98 16:27:49 515bv$not1Reporter's NoteThe next page is purposely numbered 1101.

J. 206, 649 A. 2d 1253.Justice Scalia, concurring.Last Term's decision in Madsen v. Women's Health Center, Inc.,512 U. S. 753 (1994), has damaged the First Amendment morequickly and more severely than I feared. In this case the NewJersey courts asserted the power to enjoin residential picketing515ord$$1x 08-18-98 10:07:57 PGT*ORD1BV (Bound Volume)1111ORDERSScalia, J., concurring1110by antiabortion demonstrators that was explicitly found to havebeen peaceful and in violation of no state statute or rule of common law. It is one thing for the courts to enforce by injunctiona general, content-neutral state law (civil or criminal) againstall residential picketing, or to enjoin particular individuals fromcontinuing residential picketing that they have conducted in anunlawful manner (e. g., with the accompaniment of violence). Itis quite another thing for the courts to enjoin particular individuals from conducting lawful residential picketing that they haveconducted in a lawful manner in the past. That is an unconstitutional prior restraint.Respondents are Elrick Murray, an obstetrician-gynecologistwho performs abortions, and his wife. The two petitionersplanned a demonstration at respondents' residence on Sunday,January 20, 1991. On the appointed day, they and 56 other pick-eters met two policemen near respondents' house; received instruction from the policemen in basic picketing protocol; and wereescorted to the sidewalk running in front of respondents' houseand 10 neighboring houses. The protesters, carrying signs,walked in a single-file loop on the sidewalk past respondents'house; the picketing lasted about an hour, and "[n]o instances oftrespass, violence or disorderly conduct were reported." App. toPet. for Cert. 90a (App.).In February 1991, respondents filed suit against petitioners andothers in state court, seeking damages and injunctive relief forvarious common-law torts: invasion of privacy (including interference with the use and enjoyment of respondents' residence), inten-tional infliction of emotional distress, interference with contractual relations, and others. The Chancery Division of the trialcourt entered a temporary restraining order. After a hearing onthe merits, the trial court denied respondents damages on theground that respondents had not made out any of their tortclaims. See id., at 92a-97a. The court then went on to makethe following rulings, which converted the proceeding from a tortsuit for damages and injunctive relief into a proceeding for imposi-tion of a judicial prior restraint:"In addition to these claims, this court must also considerequitable principles when determining the appropriateness ofinjunctive relief."Plaintiffs have a privacy interest irrespective of theirpotential tort claim. . . .515ord$$1x 08-18-98 10:07:57 PGT*ORD1BV (Bound Volume)1112 OCTOBER TERM, 1994Scalia, J., concurring 515 U. S."It can operate to limit First Amendment rights, evenwhere the intrusion is not tresspatory [sic] or otherwiseobstructed."The Court of equity has the inherent authority to balancethat interest against First Amendment rights."In other words, this court does not accept defendants'position that no injunction can issue unless a crime or anexpressed tort has been committed." Id., at 97a (emphasesadded; citations omitted).The court then "balanced" the equities and, on the strength ofFrisby v. Schultz, 487 U. S. 474 (1988), found that respondents'interests in residential privacy justified an injunction restraining"defendants and all persons in active concert or participation withthem . . . from picketing in any form . . . within 300 feet" ofrespondents' home. App. 106a.The Appellate Division and the New Jersey Supreme Courtaffirmed. When petitioners sought certiorari we granted theirpetition, vacated the judgment, and remanded for reconsiderationin light of our decision in Madsen. See Lawson v. Murray, 513U. S. 802 (1994). On remand, the New Jersey Supreme Courtaffirmed the trial court's injunction in part and modified it inpart. The court acknowledged (as it had stated even more clearlyin its first opinion) that the injunction was "not imposed to remedy unlawful conduct," 138 N. J. 206, 225, 649 A. 2d 1253, 1263(1994), but rejected petitioners' claim that the injunction thereforeconstituted an invalid prior restraint. In the alternative, thecourt relied on an asserted "captive audience" exception to theprior restraint doctrine. See id., at 226, 649 A. 2d, at 1263.Although I dissented in Madsen, I do not believe that the opinion for the Court in that case "approve[d] issuance of an injunctionagainst speech . . . even when there has been found no violation,or threatened violation, of a law." 512 U. S., at 804 (Scalia, J.,dissenting) (emphasis in original). To the contrary, the Court didobeisance to the venerable principle that "[i]njunctions . . . areremedies imposed for violations (or threatened violations) of alegislative or judicial decree," id., at 764 (citing United States v.W. T. Grant Co., 345 U. S. 629 (1953)), no matter how little thatprinciple was honored in application. See also 512 U. S., at 765("[I]njunctions . . . afford more precise relief than a statute wherea violation of the law has already occurred"); id., at 765, n. 3515ord$$1x 08-18-98 10:07:57 PGT*ORD1BV (Bound Volume)1113ORDERSScalia, J., concurring1110("Under general equity principles, an injunction issues only ifthere is a showing that the defendant has violated, or imminentlywill violate, some provision of statutory or common law, and thatthere is a cognizable danger of recurrent violation") (internal quotation marks omitted).The Federal Constitution does not, of course, directly requirethat an injunction issue only in such circumstances. But whereinjunctions that prohibit speech are concerned, the Free Speechand Free Press Clauses of the First Amendment impose thatrequirement indirectly. All speech-restricting injunctions areprior restraints in the literal sense of " `administrative and judicialorders forbidding certain communications when issued in advanceof the time that such communications are to occur.' " Alexanderv. United States, 509 U. S. 544, 550 (1993) (emphasis deleted).Precedent shows that a speech-restricting "injunction" that is notissued as a remedy for an adjudicated or impending violation oflaw is also a prior restraint in the condemnatory sense, that is, aprior restraint of the sort prohibited by the First Amendment.In Organization for a Better Austin v. Keefe, 402 U. S. 415(1971), the state courts enjoined the petitioner from distributingliterature or picketing anywhere within the city limits, on thesame ground that the New Jersey courts expressed here: "[T]hepublic policy of the [State] strongly favored protection of theprivacy of home and family" from the speech activities. Cf. 138N. J., at 224, 649 A. 2d, at 1263 ("[T]he injunction was enteredpursuant to the [trial] court's authority to grant equitable reliefto enforce a valid public policy of this State" protecting residentialprivacy). We held the injunction to be an unconstitutional priorrestraint, reasoning that "the injunction operates, not to redressalleged private wrongs, but to suppress [speech] on the basis ofprevious publications." 402 U. S., at 418-419 (emphasis added).Keefe relied on Near v. Minnesota ex rel. Olson, 283 U. S. 697(1931), the foundation case in this area, where we struck downa state-court order that enjoined a newspaper from publishingmalicious, scandalous, or defamatory material. We found theorder to be an unconstitutional prior restraint, observing that thestatute that authorized the order "is not aimed at the redress ofindividual or private wrongs," id., at 709, and that "the object ofthe statute is not punishment, . . . but suppression," id., at 711.See also id., at 715; Hirsh v. Atlanta, 495 U. S. 927 (1990)(Stevens, J., concurring in denial of stay) (distinguishing injunc515ord$$1x 08-18-98 10:07:57 PGT*ORD1BV (Bound Volume)1114 OCTOBER TERM, 1994Scalia, J., concurring 515 U. S.tive relief against "a class of persons who have persistently andrepeatedly engaged in unlawful conduct" from "a naked prior restraint against . . . a group that did not have a similar history ofillegal conduct").The very episode before us illustrates the reasons for this dis-tinction between remedial injunctions and unconstitutional priorrestraints. The danger that speech-restricting injunctions mayserve as a powerful means to suppress disfavored views is obviousenough even when they are based on a completed or impendingviolation of law. Once such a basis has been found, later speechmay be quashed, or not quashed, in the discretion of a singleofficial, who necessarily knows the content and viewpoint of thespeech subject to the injunction; the injunction is enforceablethrough civil contempt, a summary process without the constitutional protection of a jury trial; and the only defense available tothe enjoined party is factual compliance with the injunction, notunconstitutionality, see In re Felmeister, 95 N. J. 431, 445, 471A. 2d 775, 782 (1984); In re Carton, 48 N. J. 9, 16, 222 A. 2d92, 96 (1966). But the threat to the First Amendment becomespositively alarming when violation of the law is not even a necessary prelude to this expansive discretion--when the defendant'sprior speech (and proposed future speech) has been expresslyfound not to constitute a crime or common-law tort, and the onlybasis for the injunction is a nebulous "public policy" of the Stateenforced by an inherent equitable power. See 138 N. J., at 225,649 A. 2d, at 1263. This is by definition a policy of enjoining inadvance speech that the State does not punish after the fact--that is to say, a policy narrowly tailored to nothing but the suppression of lawful speech. And even that damning assessmentassumes, of course, that such a "public policy" even exists in statelaw, which is highly questionable here. The New Jersey courtshave given equitable relief against residential picketing not violative of state law only in this case and another recent case involv-ing abortion protesters. See Boffard v. Barnes, 136 N. J. 32, 642A. 2d 338 (1994).* The temptation in cases involving issues of*In K-T Marine, Inc. v. Dockbuilders Local Union 1456, 251 N. J. Super.107, 597 A. 2d 540 (1991), the Appellate Division affirmed an injunctionagainst residential picketing by a union. There, however, the injunction is-sued because the trial judge found that "tortious activity . . . had takenplace and would continue unless the court interceded." Id., at 110, 597A. 2d, at 542.515ord$$1x 08-18-98 10:07:57 PGT*ORD1BV (Bound Volume)1115ORDERSScalia, J., concurring1110social controversy--precisely the cases where the First Amend-ment's protections are most needed--will always be for judgesto discern a "policy" against whatever-speech-looks-bad-at-the-moment.Even our Madsen decision was, as I read it, unwilling to invitesuch consequences by cutting prior-restraint doctrine loose fromthe requirement that injunctions be remedial. The prior-restraint argument advanced by petitioners in that case was summarily rejected in a footnote with the observation that"[n]ot all injunctions that may incidentally affect expression. . . are `prior restraints' . . . . Here petitioners are notprevented from expressing their message in any one ofseveral different ways; they are simply prohibited from expressing it within the . . . zone [covered by the injunction].Moreover, the injunction was issued not because of the content of petitioners' expression, . . . but because of their priorunlawful conduct." Madsen, 512 U. S., at 764, n. 2 (emphasis added).The New Jersey Supreme Court read this footnote to mean thateven an injunction not imposed to remedy or prevent unlawfulconduct may nonetheless be valid, depending on an assessment of"factors" such as content neutrality and availability of alternativechannels of communication. See 138 N. J., at 221-226, 649 A. 2d,at 1261-1263. But such factors determine the validity of subsequent restraints, see, e. g., Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members ofN. Y. State Crime Victims Bd., 502 U. S. 105, 116 (1991); Ward v.Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781, 791 (1989), and to makethem conclusive of the validity of prior restraints as well woulddestroy the doctrine that prior restraints are specially disfavored,see Patterson v. Colorado ex rel. Attorney General of Colo., 205U. S. 454, 462 (1907) (Holmes, J.); Nebraska Press Assn. v. Stuart,427 U. S. 539, 598 (1976) (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment).The presence of such validating factors is a necessary and suffi-cient condition for the constitutionality of a subsequent punishment, but merely a necessary condition for the constitutionalityof a prior restraint, which requires in addition that it be remedial. It is improper to attribute a different meaning to the am-biguous Madsen footnote, which after all appeared in an opinionthat elsewhere purported to honor the requirement that speech-restricting injunctions be remedial.515ord$$1x 08-18-98 10:07:57 PGT*ORD1BV (Bound Volume)1116 OCTOBER TERM, 1994May 30, 1995 515 U. S.The principal ground for the decision below, then, does notapply Madsen but expands it, and contracts the First Amendmentpari passu. I think it of vital importance that Madsen quicklybe limited to what it said, rather than what it did. I nonethelessdo not vote to grant certiorari here, for two reasons: The alterna-tive ground for the court's decision (existence of a "captive audience" exception to the doctrine of prior restraint), while a highlyquestionable basis for a discretionary injunction power, presentsno clear conflict with the decisions of other courts and could pre-vent us from reaching the Madsen issue. And clarification ofMadsen is in any event unlikely to occur in another case involvingthe currently disfavored class of antiabortion protesters. Accordingly, I concur in the denial of certiorari.No. 94-1498. Illinois v. Salazar. Sup. Ct. Ill. Motion ofrespondent for leave to proceed in forma pauperis granted. Certiorari denied.

E. 2d 200.Justice Thomas, with whom Justice O'Connor joins,dissenting.Motivated by a desire to improve the attractiveness of its down-town region, the Atlanta City Council passed an ordinance requiring certain existing surface parking lots to include landscapedareas equal to at least 10% of the paved area and to have at leastone tree for every eight parking spaces. The ordinance coverssome 350 parking lots; petitioners estimate that compliance withthe landscaping requirements will cost approximately $12,500 perlot, for a total of $4,375,000. Additionally, parking lot owners willlose revenue due to lost parking spaces and lost advertising dol-lars: The trees allegedly will obscure existing advertising signsand cause petitioners to lose contracts worth about $1,636,000.Petitioners sought injunctive and declaratory relief on theground that the Atlanta ordinance was an uncompensated takingof property in violation of the Fifth Amendment. The state trial515ord$$1x 08-18-98 10:07:57 PGT*ORD1BV (Bound Volume)1117ORDERSThomas, J., dissenting1116court ruled in favor of the city. In a divided opinion, the Su-preme Court of Georgia affirmed. 264 Ga. 764, 450 S. E. 2d 200(1994). The court held that the ordinance was neither a physicalnor a regulatory taking. The court relied on Agins v. City ofTiburon, 447 U. S. 255 (1980), to conclude that the ordinance wasconstitutional because it "advances legitimate governmental interests and leaves the plaintiffs with an economically viable use intheir property." 264 Ga., at 766, n. 3, 450 S. E. 2d, at 203, n. 3.The court distinguished Dolan v. City of Tigard, 512 U. S. 374(1994), which requires a showing of rough proportionality betweenthe conditions imposed and the impact of the owner's develop-ment, on the ground that although the city of Tigard had not madean " `individualized determination that the required dedication isrelated both in nature and extent to the impact of the development,' " 264 Ga., at 766, n. 3, 450 S. E. 2d, at 203, n. 3 (quotingDolan, supra, at 391), the city of Atlanta had made a "legislativedetermination" with regard to many landowners, 264 Ga., at 766,n. 3, 450 S. E. 2d, at 203, n. 3, thus placing this case outside thereach of Dolan.The lower courts are in conflict over whether Dolan's test forproperty regulation should be applied in cases where the allegedtaking occurs through an Act of the legislature. In addition tothe court below, at least one other court has relied upon the"legislative" character of state action to conclude that Dolan wasinapposite and that the less stringent Agins standard should beapplied. See Harris v. Wichita, 862 F. Supp. 287, 294 (D. Kan.1994). Other courts, however, have applied Dolan to cases in-volving alleged legislative regulatory takings. In Trimen Development Co. v. King Cty., 124 Wash. 2d 261, 877 P. 2d 187 (1994),the Washington Supreme Court applied Dolan to an ordinancesimilar to the one at issue here. A King County Council ordi-nance required that developers seeking to build housing eitherdedicate land for public parks or pay a fee. Despite the fact thatthe ordinance was clearly a "legislative enactment," the courtapplied Dolan's rough proportionality test. 124 Wash. 2d, at 274,877 P. 2d, at 194. See also Manocherian v. Lennox Hill Hospital,84 N. Y. 2d 385, 393, 643 N. E. 2d 479, 483 (1994), cert. denied, 514U. S. 1109 (1995) (applying Dolan to alleged legislative taking).It is hardly surprising that some courts have applied Dolan'srough proportionality test even when considering a legislativeenactment. It is not clear why the existence of a taking should515ord$$1x 08-18-98 10:07:57 PGT*ORD1BV (Bound Volume)1118 OCTOBER TERM, 1994May 30, 1995 515 U. S.turn on the type of governmental entity responsible for the tak-ing. A city council can take property just as well as a planningcommission can. Moreover, the general applicability of the ordi-nance should not be relevant in a takings analysis. If Atlantahad seized several hundred homes in order to build a freeway,there would be no doubt that Atlanta had taken property. Thedistinction between sweeping legislative takings and particular-ized administrative takings appears to be a distinction without aconstitutional difference.Although Dolan purports to be an exception to Agins, the logicof these two cases appears to point in different directions. Thelower courts should not have to struggle to make sense of thistension in our case law. In the past, the confused nature of someof our takings case law and the fact-specific nature of takingsclaims has led us to grant certiorari in takings cases without theexistence of a conflict. See Dolan, supra, at 383 (observing thatcertiorari was granted because the Oregon Supreme Court alleg-edly had misapplied Nollan v. California Coastal Comm'n, 483U. S. 825 (1987)). Where, as here, there is a conflict, the reasonsfor granting certiorari are all the more compelling.Because the petition poses a substantial federal question con-cerning regulatory takings and because there is confusion in thelower courts, I would grant certiorari.No. 94-1629.

Considerations Governing Review onCertiorariReview on a writ of certiorari is not a matter of right, butof judicial discretion. A petition for a writ of certiorari willbe granted only for compelling reasons. The following, al-though neither controlling nor fully measuring the Court'sdiscretion, indicate the character of the reasons the Courtconsiders:515us3urul 07-10-97 16:49:00 PGT * USRULES1204 RULES OF THE SUPREME COURT(a) a United States court of appeals has entered adecision in conflict with the decision of another UnitedStates court of appeals on the same important matter;has decided an important federal question in a way thatconflicts with a decision by a state court of last resort;or has so far departed from the accepted and usualcourse of judicial proceedings, or sanctioned such a de-parture by a lower court, as to call for an exercise ofthis Court's supervisory power;(b) a state court of last resort has decided an important federal question in a way that conflicts with thedecision of another state court of last resort or of aUnited States court of appeals;(c) a state court or a United States court of appealshas decided an important question of federal law thathas not been, but should be, settled by this Court, orhas decided an important federal question in a way thatconflicts with relevant decisions of this Court.A petition for a writ of certiorari is rarely granted when theasserted error consists of erroneous factual findings or themisapplication of a properly stated rule of law.Rule 11. Certiorari to a United States Court of AppealsBefore JudgmentA petition for a writ of certiorari to review a case pendingin a United States court of appeals, before judgment is entered in that court, will be granted only upon a showing thatthe case is of such imperative public importance as to justifydeviation from normal appellate practice and to requireimmediate determination in this Court. See 28 U. S. C.$ 2101(e).Rule 12. Review on Certiorari: How Sought; Parties1. Except as provided in paragraph 2 of this Rule, the peti-tioner shall file 40 copies of a petition for a writ of certiorari,prepared as required by Rule 33.1, and shall pay the Rule38(a) docket fee.515us3urul 07-10-97 16:49:00 PGT * USRULES1205RULES OF THE SUPREME COURT2. A petitioner proceeding in forma pauperis under Rule39 shall file an original and 10 copies of a petition for a writof certiorari prepared as required by Rule 33.2, togetherwith an original and 10 copies of the motion for leave toproceed in forma pauperis. A copy of the motion shall pre-cede and be attached to each copy of the petition. An inmate confined in an institution, if proceeding in forma pauperis and not represented by counsel, need file only anoriginal petition and motion.3. Whether prepared under Rule 33.1 or Rule 33.2, thepetition shall comply in all respects with Rule 14 and shallbe submitted with proof of service as required by Rule 29.The case then will be placed on the docket. It is the petitioner's duty to notify all respondents promptly, on a formsupplied by the Clerk, of the date of filing, the date the casewas placed on the docket, and the docket number of the case.The notice shall be served as required by Rule 29.4. Parties interested jointly, severally, or otherwise in ajudgment may petition separately for a writ of certiorari; orany two or more may join in a petition. A party not shownon the petition as joined therein at the time the petition isfiled may not later join in that petition. When two or morejudgments are sought to be reviewed on a writ of certiorarito the same court and involve identical or closely relatedquestions, a single petition for a writ of certiorari coveringall the judgments suffices. A petition for a writ of certiorarimay not be joined with any other pleading, except that anymotion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis shall beattached.5. No more than 30 days after a case has been placed onthe docket, a respondent seeking to file a conditional crosspetition (i. e., a cross-petition that otherwise would be un-timely) shall file, with proof of service as required by Rule29, 40 copies of the cross-petition prepared as required byRule 33.1, except that a cross-petitioner proceeding in formapauperis under Rule 39 shall comply with Rule 12.2. Thecross-petition shall comply in all respects with this Rule andRule 14, except that material already reproduced in the ap515us3urul 07-10-97 16:49:00 PGT * USRULES1206 RULES OF THE SUPREME COURTpendix to the opening petition need not be reproduced again.A cross-petitioning respondent shall pay the Rule 38(a)docket fee or submit a motion for leave to proceed in formapauperis. The cover of the cross-petition shall indicateclearly that it is a conditional cross-petition. The cross-petition then will be placed on the docket, subject to theprovisions of Rule 13.4. It is the cross-petitioner's duty tonotify all cross-respondents promptly, on a form supplied bythe Clerk, of the date of filing, the date the cross-petitionwas placed on the docket, and the docket number of thecross-petition. The notice shall be served as required byRule 29. A cross-petition for a writ of certiorari may notbe joined with any other pleading, except that any motionfor leave to proceed in forma pauperis shall be attached.The time to file a cross-petition will not be extended.6. All parties to the proceeding in the court whose judg-ment is sought to be reviewed are deemed parties entitledto file documents in this Court, unless the petitioner notifiesthe Clerk of this Court in writing of the petitioner's beliefthat one or more of the parties below have no interest in theoutcome of the petition. A copy of such notice shall beserved as required by Rule 29 on all parties to the proceeding below. A party noted as no longer interested may re-main a party by notifying the Clerk promptly, with serviceon the other parties, of an intention to remain a party. Allparties other than the petitioner are considered respondents,but any respondent who supports the position of a petitionershall meet the petitioner's time schedule for filing docu-ments, except that a response supporting the petition shallbe filed within 20 days after the case is placed on the docket,and that time will not be extended. Parties who file no document will not qualify for any relief from this Court.7. The clerk of the court having possession of the recordshall keep it until notified by the Clerk of this Court to certify and transmit it. In any document filed with this Court,a party may cite or quote from the record, even if it hasnot been transmitted to this Court. When requested by theClerk of this Court to certify and transmit the record, or any515us3urul 07-10-97 16:49:00 PGT * USRULES1207RULES OF THE SUPREME COURTpart of it, the clerk of the court having possession of therecord shall number the documents to be certified and shalltransmit therewith a numbered list specifically identifyingeach document transmitted. If the record, or stipulated portions, have been printed for the use of the court below, thatprinted record, plus the proceedings in the court below, maybe certified as the record unless one of the parties or theClerk of this Court requests otherwise. The record mayconsist of certified copies, but if the lower court is of theview that original documents of any kind should be seen bythis Court, that court may provide by order for the trans-port, safekeeping, and return of such originals.Rule 13. Review on Certiorari: Time for Petitioning1. Unless otherwise provided by law, a petition for a writof certiorari to review a judgment in any case, civil or criminal, entered by a state court of last resort or a United Statescourt of appeals (including the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces) is timely when it is filed withthe Clerk of this Court within 90 days after entry of thejudgment. A petition for a writ of certiorari seeking reviewof a judgment of a lower state court that is subject to discretionary review by the state court of last resort is timelywhen it is filed with the Clerk within 90 days after entry ofthe order denying discretionary review.2. The Clerk will not file any petition for a writ of certiorari that is jurisdictionally out of time. See, e. g., 28U. S. C. $ 2101(c).3. The time to file a petition for a writ of certiorari runsfrom the date of entry of the judgment or order sought to bereviewed, and not from the issuance date of the mandate (orits equivalent under local practice). But if a petition for rehearing is timely filed in the lower court by any party, thetime to file the petition for a writ of certiorari for all parties(whether or not they requested rehearing or joined in thepetition for rehearing) runs from the date of the denial ofthe petition for rehearing or, if the petition for rehearing isgranted, the subsequent entry of judgment. A suggestion515us3urul 07-10-97 16:49:00 PGT * USRULES1208 RULES OF THE SUPREME COURTmade to a United States court of appeals for a rehearing enbanc is not a petition for rehearing within the meaning ofthis Rule unless so treated by the United States court ofappeals.4. A cross-petition for a writ of certiorari is timely whenit is filed with the Clerk as provided in paragraphs 1, 3, and5 of this Rule, or in Rule 12.5. However, a conditionalcross-petition (which except for Rule 12.5 would be untimely)will not be granted unless another party's timely petition fora writ of certiorari is granted.5. For good cause, a Justice may extend the time to file apetition for a writ of certiorari for a period not exceeding 60days. An application to extend the time to file shall set outthe basis for jurisdiction in this Court, identify the judgmentsought to be reviewed, include a copy of the opinion and anyorder respecting rehearing, and set out specific reasons whyan extension of time is justified. The application must bereceived by the Clerk at least 10 days before the date thepetition is due, except in extraordinary circumstances. Forthe time and manner of presenting the application, see Rules21, 22, 30, and 33.2. An application to extend the time tofile a petition for a writ of certiorari is not favored.Rule 14.

If the provisions involved arelengthy, their citation alone suffices at this point, and theirpertinent text shall be set out in the appendix referred to insubparagraph 1(i).515us3urul 07-10-97 16:49:00 PGT * USRULES1210 RULES OF THE SUPREME COURT(g) A concise statement of the case setting out the factsmaterial to consideration of the questions presented, and alsocontaining the following:(i) If review of a state-court judgment is sought, spec-ification of the stage in the proceedings, both in thecourt of first instance and in the appellate courts, whenthe federal questions sought to be reviewed were raised;the method or manner of raising them and the way inwhich they were passed on by those courts; and pertinent quotations of specific portions of the record or sum-mary thereof, with specific reference to the places in therecord where the matter appears (e. g., court opinion,ruling on exception, portion of court's charge and exception thereto, assignment of error), so as to show that thefederal question was timely and properly raised and thatthis Court has jurisdiction to review the judgment on awrit of certiorari. When the portions of the record relied on under this subparagraph are voluminous, theyshall be included in the appendix referred to in subparagraph 1(i).(ii) If review of a judgment of a United States courtof appeals is sought, the basis for federal jurisdiction inthe court of first instance.(h) A direct and concise argument amplifying the reasonsrelied on for allowance of the writ.

A petition for a writ of certiorari should be statedbriefly and in plain terms and may not exceed the page limi-tations specified in Rule 33.4. The failure of a petitioner to present with accuracy,brevity, and clarity whatever is essential to ready and adequate understanding of the points requiring consideration issufficient reason for the Court to deny a petition.5. If the Clerk determines that a petition submitted timelyand in good faith is in a form that does not comply with thisRule or with Rule 33 or Rule 34, the Clerk will return itwith a letter indicating the deficiency. A corrected petitionreceived no more than 60 days after the date of the Clerk'sletter will be deemed timely.Rule 15. Briefs in Opposition; Reply Briefs;Supplemental Briefs1.

Procedure on a Certified Question1. A United States court of appeals may certify to thisCourt a question or proposition of law on which it seeks instruction for the proper decision of a case. The certificateshall contain a statement of the nature of the case and thefacts on which the question or proposition of law arises.Only questions or propositions of law may be certified, andthey shall be stated separately and with precision. The certificate shall be prepared as required by Rule 33.2 and shallbe signed by the clerk of the court of appeals.2. When a question is certified by a United States courtof appeals, this Court, on its own motion or that of a party,may consider and decide the entire matter in controversy.See 28 U. S. C. $ 1254(2).3. When a question is certified, the Clerk will notify theparties and docket the case. Counsel shall then enter theirappearances. After docketing, the Clerk will submit thecertificate to the Court for a preliminary examination to determine whether the case should be briefed, set for argument, or dismissed. No brief may be filed until the preliminary examination of the certificate is completed.4. If the Court orders the case briefed or set for argument,the parties will be notified and permitted to file briefs. TheClerk of this Court then will request the clerk of the courtin possession of the record to certify and transmit it. Anyportion of the record to which the parties wish to direct theCourt's particular attention should be printed in a joint appendix, prepared in conformity with Rule 26 by the appellantor petitioner in the court of appeals, but the fact that anypart of the record has not been printed does not prevent theparties or the Court from relying on it.5. A brief on the merits in a case involving a certifiedquestion shall comply with Rules 24, 25, and 33.1, except thatthe brief for the party who is the appellant or petitionerbelow shall be filed within 45 days of the order requiringbriefs or setting the case for argument.515us3urul 07-10-97 16:49:00 PGT * USRULES1221RULES OF THE SUPREME COURTRule 20. Procedure on a Petition for an ExtraordinaryWrit1. Issuance by the Court of an extraordinary writ author-ized by 28 U. S. C. $ 1651(a) is not a matter of right, but ofdiscretion sparingly exercised. To justify the granting ofany such writ, the petition must show that the writ will bein aid of the Court's appellate jurisdiction, that exceptionalcircumstances warrant the exercise of the Court's discretionary powers, and that adequate relief cannot be obtained inany other form or from any other court.2. A petition seeking a writ authorized by 28 U. S. C.$ 1651(a), $ 2241, or $ 2254(a) shall be prepared in all respectsas required by Rules 33 and 34. The petition shall be cap-tioned "In re [name of petitioner]" and shall follow, insofaras applicable, the form of a petition for a writ of certiorariprescribed by Rule 14. All contentions in support of thepetition shall be included in the petition. The case will beplaced on the docket when 40 copies of the petition are filedwith the Clerk and the docket fee is paid, except that a petitioner proceeding in forma pauperis under Rule 39, includ-ing an inmate of an institution, shall file the number of copiesrequired for a petition by such a person under Rule 12.2,together with a motion for leave to proceedin forma pauperis, a copy of which shall precede and be attached to eachcopy of the petition. The petition shall be served as required by Rule 29 (subject to subparagraph 4(b) of this Rule).3. (a) A petition seeking a writ of prohibition, a writ ofmandamus, or both in the alternative shall state the nameand office or function of every person against whom relief issought and shall set out with particularity why the reliefsought is not available in any other court. A copy of thejudgment with respect to which the writ is sought, includingany related opinion, shall be appended to the petition together with any other document essential to understandingthe petition.(b) The petition shall be served on every party to the pro-ceeding with respect to which relief is sought. Within 30days after the petition is placed on the docket, a party shall515us3urul 07-10-97 16:49:00 PGT * USRULES1222 RULES OF THE SUPREME COURTfile 40 copies of any brief or briefs in opposition thereto,which shall comply fully with Rule 15. If a party named asa respondent does not wish to respond to the petition, thatparty may so advise the Clerk and all other parties by letter.All persons served are deemed respondents for all purposesin the proceedings in this Court.4. (a) A petition seeking a writ of habeas corpus shallcomply with the requirements of 28 U. S. C. $$ 2241 and 2242,and in particular with the provision in the last paragraph of$ 2242, which requires a statement of the "reasons for notmaking application to the district court of the district inwhich the applicant is held." If the relief sought is from thejudgment of a state court, the petition shall set out specifically how and where the petitioner has exhausted availableremedies in the state courts or otherwise comes within theprovisions of 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(b). To justify the grantingof a writ of habeas corpus, the petitioner must show thatexceptional circumstances warrant the exercise of theCourt's discretionary powers, and that adequate relief cannotbe obtained in any other form or from any other court. Thiswrit is rarely granted.(b) Habeas corpus proceedings areex parte, unless theCourt requires the respondent to show cause why the peti-tion for a writ of habeas corpus should not be granted. Aresponse, if ordered, shall comply fully with Rule 15. Neither the denial of the petition, without more, nor an order oftransfer to a district court under the authority of 28 U. S. C.$ 2241(b), is an adjudication on the merits, and therefore doesnot preclude further application to another court for the relief sought.5. The Clerk will distribute the documents to the Courtfor its consideration when a brief in opposition under subpar-agraph 3(b) of this Rule has been filed, when a responseunder subparagraph 4(b) has been ordered and filed, whenthe time to file has expired, or when the right to file has beenexpressly waived.6. If the Court orders the case set for argument, the Clerkwill notify the parties whether additional briefs are required,515us3urul 07-10-97 16:49:00 PGT * USRULES1223RULES OF THE SUPREME COURTwhen they shall be filed, and, if the case involves a petitionfor a common-law writ of certiorari, that the parties shallprepare a joint appendix in accordance with Rule 26.PART V.

When the Circuit Justice is unavailable for any reason, the applicationaddressed to that Justice will be distributed to the Justicethen available who is next junior to the Circuit Justice; theturn of the Chief Justice follows that of the most juniorJustice.4. A Justice denying an application will note the denialthereon. Thereafter, unless action thereon is restricted bylaw to the Circuit Justice or is untimely under Rule 30.2,the party making an application, except in the case of anapplication for an extension of time, may renew it to anyother Justice, subject to the provisions of this Rule. Exceptwhen the denial is without prejudice, a renewed applicationis not favored.

The Clerk will advise all parties concerned, by appropriately speedy means, of the disposition made of anapplication.Rule 23. Stays1. A stay may be granted by a Justice as permitted by law.2. A party to a judgment sought to be reviewed may present to a Justice an application to stay the enforcement ofthat judgment. See 28 U. S. C. $ 2101(f).3. An application for a stay shall set out with particularitywhy the relief sought is not available from any other courtor judge. Except in the most extraordinary circumstances,an application for a stay will not be entertained unless therelief requested was first sought in the appropriate court orcourts below or from a judge or judges thereof. An application for a stay shall identify the judgment sought to be reviewed and have appended thereto a copy of the order andopinion, if any, and a copy of the order, if any, of the courtor judge below denying the relief sought, and shall set outspecific reasons why a stay is justified. The form and content of an application for a stay are governed by Rules 22and 33.2.4.

GILLIAM et al.on application for stayNo. A-126. Decided August 17, 1995South Carolina's application for relief from an order of the Court of Appeals, which refused to stay the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus torespondent criminal defendants, is granted in part and denied in part.Respondents claimed double jeopardy by reason of a second trial, whichwas calendared after the first trial ended in a mistrial over respondents'objection. After the second trial started, the District Court enjoinedits continuation and released respondents from custody. Nothing canundo the interruption of the state trial, and therefore the DistrictCourt's order staying those proceedings will not be stayed. However,the State has met the traditional criteria for a stay of the enlargementof a prisoner in a habeas proceeding. Therefore respondents' enlargement will be stayed pending disposition of the State's appeal from theDistrict Court's order.Chief Justice Rehnquist, Circuit Justice.The State of South Carolina seeks relief from an order ofthe Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in which thatcourt refused to stay the issuance of a writ of habeas corpusto respondents, defendants in criminal proceedings in SouthCarolina. The State asks that I stay the District Court'sorder and allow the State to resume its prosecution of respondents, and stay the enlargement of respondents pendingappellate review of their habeas corpus petition.Respondents were prosecuted in South Carolina statecourt in 1994 on charges of murder and lynching. Duringthe trial, confusion and dispute arose over whether particular photographs that had been seen by the jury during aluncheon recess had actually been admitted into evidence or1301515us3IC3Z 06-05-97 16:35:34 PAGES IC13PGT1302 FOSTER v. GILLIAMOpinion in Chamberswere merely marked for identification. The prosecuting at-torney's motion for a mistrial was granted by the trial courtover respondents' objection, and the trial court calendaredthe case for a second trial starting July 17, 1995. Betweenthe first and the second trial, the trial court denied a motionby respondents to dismiss the charges on grounds of doublejeopardy, and the Supreme Court of South Carolina dismissed respondents' appeal without ruling on its merits.Respondents then sought habeas relief in federal courtunder 28 U. S. C. $ 2254, and sought to enjoin the imminentsecond trial pending final disposition of their habeas petition.On July 11, 1995, six days before the second trial was tostart, the District Court for the District of South Carolinarefused to issue an injunction, and a panel of the Court ofAppeals affirmed the District Court's determination fourdays later, with one judge in dissent. On July 20, three daysinto the trial, the Court of Appeals en banc granted respondents' request for a temporary restraining order, enjoined thestate proceedings until the District Court ruled on respondents' habeas petition, and ordered the District Court to ruleon the petition as expeditiously as possible. The State didnot apply for a stay of the Court of Appeals' order at thistime.The very next day, the District Court, having held an8-hour hearing to investigate respondents' double jeopardyclaim, granted respondents' petition for a writ of habeas corpus. (This order, though entered July 21, was not reducedto writing for another week.) The District Court denied theState's application to stay the issuance of the writ on July31, and the Court of Appeals denied a similar applicationon August 8. The State then made the application beforeme now.However debatable may have been the justification for theCourt of Appeals' July 20 order enjoining the continuationof a state criminal trial that had already begun, the trial wasinterrupted as of that date, and the State sought no relief in515us3IC3Z 06-05-97 16:35:34 PAGES IC13PGT1303Cite as: 515 U. S. 1301 (1995)Opinion in Chambersthis Court from the order of the Court of Appeals. NothingI do now, several weeks later, can undo the interruption ofthe state trial, and I therefore decline to stay the DistrictCourt's order granting habeas relief to the extent that itenjoins the resumption of the state trial proceedings.That portion of the District Court's order releasing respondents from custody, however, seems to me to stand on adifferent footing, and I believe that the State has met thetraditional criteria for a stay of the enlargement of a prisonerin a habeas corpus proceeding. The state trial court ruledagainst respondents' double jeopardy claims on the merits.InArizona v. Washington, 434 U. S. 497 (1978), we held thatone claiming double jeopardy by reason of a second trialmust show that there was no "manifest necessity" for thetrial court to grant the State's mistrial motion. And westated that the trial court's judgment about the necessity isentitled to great deference, never more so than when thejudgment is based on an evaluation of such factors as theadmissibility of evidence, any prejudice caused by the introduction of such evidence, and the trial court's familiaritywith the jurors. Id., at 513-514. Washington indicatesthat the State will be able to present at the least a substan-tial case on the merits on appeal, and the other traditionalfactors in a stay analysis counsel in favor of continued cus-tody. See Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 U. S. 770, 777-778(1987) (discussing the circumstances in which a stay of en-largement should be granted under Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure 23(c) and (d), which are virtually identical tothis Court's Rules 36.3(b) and 36.4). I will therefore staythe enlargement of respondents under the District Court'sJuly 21 order pending disposition of the State's appeal fromthat order (now set for argument before the en banc courton September 26) by the Court of Appeals.Accordingly, the application for stay of enlargement isgranted, and the application is otherwise denied.515us3IC4Z 07-09-98 11:57:36 PAGES IC13PGT1304 OCTOBER TERM, 1994Opinion in ChambersPENRY v. TEXASon application for extension of timeNo. A-180. Decided August 28, 1995An application for extension of time in which to file a petition for a writof certiorari to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals is denied. Thereasons for an extension offered by counsel--a voluminous record below,the breadth of errors committed below, and counsel of record's anticipated absence shortly before the filing date--fall short of what constitutes "good cause" to support such a disfavored application. All applicants would benefit from additional time to prepare a petition forcertiorari. It is inconceivable that counsel here could have filed their375-page Court of Criminal Appeals' brief, detailing 132 allegations oferror, without acquiring considerable familiarity with the record. Counsel asked for reconsideration and thus had six months to review theCourt of Criminal Appeals' opinion. Finally, counsel's planned absencesshould affect neither the degree of preparation afforded a client's casenor the orderly administration of this Court's deadlines.Justice Scalia, Circuit Justice.I have before me an application for extension of time inwhich to file a petition for a writ of certiorari to the Courtof Criminal Appeals of Texas. Counsel seek a 59-day extension of the filing deadline "because of the voluminous recordbelow and the breadth of errors that were committed belowwhich warrant review by this Court." Counsel explain:"The petitioner's brief to the Court of Criminal Appeal[s] ofTexas discussed 132 points of error and is 375 pages inlength. The State's brief is 248 pages in length. The judgment affirming petitioner's conviction and death sentence is76 pages with 6 additional pages of concurrences." The ap-plication offers one additional reason for the extension request: "[C]ounsel of record will be out of his office during theentire week before September 5, 1995--the day that the timeto file the petition will expire."Our Rules provide that "[a] petition for a writ of certiorarito review a judgment in any case, civil or criminal, entered515us3IC4K 07-09-98 11:57:36 PAGES IC13PGT1305Cite as: 515 U. S. 1304 (1995)Opinion in Chambersby a state court of last resort, . . . shall be deemed in timewhen it is filed with the Clerk of this Court within 90 daysafter the entry of the judgment," Rule 13.1, and that a Jus-tice may extend the time to file for up to 60 days "for goodcause shown," Rule 13.2. Our Rules specify, however, that"[a]n application to extend the time to file a petition for awrit of certiorari is not favored." Rule 13.6.I have made it clear that I take the rule of disfavor seri-ously. InMadden v. Texas, 498 U. S. 1301 (1991) (opinion inchambers), I considered four applications for extensions oftime in capital cases. Three of them sought an extensionbecause appellate counsel had withdrawn from the applicant's case (with no indication that the withdrawal could notreasonably have been foreseen). Id., at 1302-1304. In thefourth, the asserted reason was similar to that offered here:Counsel needed additional time " `to ensure that the important constitutional issues in [the] case are properly researched and presented to this Court.' " Id., at 1302. Atthat time, I expressed my view that "none of these applications, as an original matter, would meet the standard of `goodcause shown' for the granting of an extension." Id., at 1304.I nonetheless granted extensions in the three cases wherecounsel had withdrawn, primarily because I was a new Circuit Justice, and was reluctant to impose without notice astandard more stringent, perhaps, than what the Fifth Circuit bar was accustomed to. I gave notice, however, that "Ishall not grant extensions in similar circumstances again."Id., at 1305.By now, counsel litigating in the Fifth Circuit ought to befamiliar with my view of what constitutes "good cause" tosupport the disfavored application to extend the time to filea petition for certiorari. See R. Stern, E. Gressman, S. Shapiro, & K. Geller, Supreme Court Practice $ 6.7 (7th ed.1993). The reasons offered by counsel in this application fallshort. As I have previously observed, all applicants canhonestly claim that they would benefit from additional time515us3IC4K 07-09-98 11:57:36 PAGES IC13PGT1306 PENRY v. TEXASOpinion in Chambersto prepare a petition for certiorari. Kleem v. INS, 479 U. S.1308 (1986) (opinion in chambers); see also Madden, supra,at 1304. By their own account, counsel here filed a brief of375 pages, raising 132 assignments of error, in the Court ofCriminal Appeals; it is inconceivable that this could havebeen achieved without acquiring considerable familiaritywith the record, voluminous though it may be. Moreover,counsel sought rehearing below, and thus have had sixmonths to review the opinion of the Court of Criminal Ap-peals, which discussed in considerable detail the 132 allegations of error as it rejected each of them. Finally--andneedless to say--counsel's planned absences should affectneither the degree of preparation afforded a client's case northe orderly administration of our deadlines.This is indeed a capital case, but our Rules envision onlyone "good cause" standard. See 498 U. S., at 1304-1305.Because the applicant here has failed to meet that standard,I deny the application for extension of time.515us3IC5Z 06-05-97 16:46:53 PAGES IC13PGT1307OCTOBER TERM, 1994Opinion in ChambersRODRIGUEZ v. TEXASon application for stay of execution of sentenceof deathNo. 95-5650 (A-202). Decided August 31, 1995An application for a stay of execution pending disposition of a petition forwrit of certiorari seeking direct review of the Texas Court of CriminalAppeals' judgment is denied, without prejudice to its renewal at a laterdate. There being no reason to believe that the certiorari petition willnot be disposed of well before the scheduled execution date, that dateis not likely to interfere with the petition's orderly processing. SeeCole v. Texas, 499 U. S. 1301.Justice Scalia, Circuit Justice.I have before me an application for a stay of executionpending disposition of a petition for writ of certiorari to theCourt of Criminal Appeals of Texas. Petitioner seeks directreview of that court's judgment, entered May 17, 1995, affirming his conviction and death sentence. The petition wastimely filed on August 15, 1995, and petitioner's applicationstates that he is scheduled to be executed on November 8,1995.I have said that "I will . . . in every capital case on directreview, grant a stay of execution pending disposition by thisCourt of the petition for certiorari." Cole v. Texas, 499 U. S.1301 (1991). I have also made clear, however, that the purpose of such a stay is to prevent the execution date from"interfer[ing] with the orderly processing of a petition ondirect review by this Court." Ibid. In the present case,and at the present time, there is no reason to believe suchinterference will occur. A petition for certiorari filed in thisCourt on August 15 will ordinarily be disposed of well beforeNovember 8.515us3IC5Z 06-05-97 16:46:53 PAGES IC13PGT1308 RODRIGUEZ v.

PROCTER &GAMBLE CO. et al.on application for stayNo. A-276. Decided September 21, 1995An application to stay a District Court order restraining petitioner frompublishing a magazine article disclosing documents filed under seal withthat court is denied. Since it appears that the order was entered without notice to petitioner and was not supported by the findings requiredby Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(b), it can be assumed that thecourt would have dissolved the order had petitioner so moved. Had itrefused to do so, the Court of Appeals would have had jurisdiction toaddress the restraint's merits. Instead, petitioner filed an expeditedappeal, which the Court of Appeals dismissed on jurisdictional grounds.The stay application addresses the merits of the District Court's order,not the Court of Appeals' jurisdictional holding. Even if there is jurisdiction to pass on the order's merits, the wiser course is to give theDistrict Court an opportunity to find the relevant facts--since there isa dispute over how petitioner acquired the documents--and allow bothit and the Court of Appeals to consider the merits of the First Amendment issue before it is addressed here.Justice Stevens, Circuit Justice.On September 19, 1995, petitioner, the publisher of Business Week magazine, filed with me in my capacity as CircuitJustice for the Sixth Circuit a hastily prepared documententitled "Application to Stay Restraining Order PendingCertiorari." The caption of the document recites: "On Petition for a Writ of Certiorari to the Court of Appeals for theSixth Circuit." The conclusion of the document asks me tostay the "outstanding prior restraint" against petitionereffected by an order entered by the United States DistrictCourt for the Southern District of Ohio, Western Division,on September 13. That order restrains petitioner from publishing an article containing "any disclosure of documentsfiled under seal, or the contents thereof, without the priorconsent" of the District Court. Petitioner requests that a515us3IC6Z 06-05-97 16:51:23 PAGES IC13PGT1310 McGRAW-HILL COS. v. PROCTER & GAMBLE CO.Opinion in Chambersstay of the District Court order "be granted pending its filing of and this Court's ultimate determination of a petitionfor a writ of certiorari."It appears that the District Court order of September 13was entered without notice to petitioner and that it was notsupported by the findings of fact required by Rule 65(b) ofthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. I assume, therefore,that if petitioner had filed a prompt motion to dissolve theorder, the District Court would have granted that relief, orif it had refused to do so, the Court of Appeals would havehad jurisdiction to address the merits of the restraint. Petitioner, however, filed an expedited appeal in the Sixth Circuit, and, on September 19, that court dismissed the appealon the ground that it did not have jurisdiction to review themerits of the restraining order.The stay application that petitioner has filed with me indicates that it will seek review by writ of certiorari of theCourt of Appeals' jurisdictional holding, but the argumentsadvanced in the application address the merits of the DistrictCourt's order. The application does not explain why thereis a substantial basis for concluding that the Court of Appeals erred, or that four Justices of this Court would grantcertiorari to review the jurisdictional issue. Moreover, astay is not necessary to preserve this Court's jurisdiction toreview the Court of Appeals' decision; indeed, if the requested stay were granted, any possible review of that decision would probably become moot.In its discussion of the merits of the District Court's order,petitioner explains that the documents whose contents itwants to publish were attachments to a motion filed byProcter & Gamble in the District Court on September 1,1995. Referring to that motion, petitioner states:"The motion was not filed under seal with the districtcourt and there is no indication anywhere on the motionitself that any of the described attachments were being515us3IC6Z 06-05-97 16:51:24 PAGES IC13PGT1311Cite as: 515 U. S. 1309 (1995)Opinion in Chambersfiled under seal." Application to Stay RestrainingOrder Pending Certiorari 4.That statement appears to have been intended to give methe impression that petitioner's agents obtained knowledgeof the contents of the attachments either (1) without anynotice that they were filed under seal, or (2) under the legitimate belief that their filing in court without any effort topreserve their confidentiality had the effect of placing theircontents in the public domain. The memoranda filed in op-position to the stay application indicate that I may have beenmisled by the foregoing statement and that disputed issuesof fact should be resolved before expressing an opinion onthe important constitutional issue that petitioner argues inits stay application. The statement that I have quotedabove seems to acknowledge that the manner in which peti-tioner came into possession of the information it seeks topublish may have a bearing on its right to do so.Even if I have jurisdiction to pass on the merits of theDistrict Court's order of September 13--a matter which isdoubtful at best--I am satisfied that the wiser course is togive the District Court an opportunity to find the relevantfacts, and to allow both that court and the Court of Appealsto consider the merits of the First Amendment issue beforeit is addressed in this Court. The stay application is, accordingly, denied.515BV$131207-09-9811:53:16STATEMENTSHOWINGTHENUMBEROFCASESFILED,DISPOSEDOFANDREMAININGONDOCKETSATCONCLUSIONOFOCTOBERTERMS,1992,1993AND19941312ORIGINALPAIDINFORMAPAUPERISTOTALS199219931994199219931994199219931994199219931994Numberofcasesondockets-------------1212112,4412,4422,5154,7925,3325,5747,2457,7868,100Numberdisposedofduringterm------1122,0992,0652,1544,2564,6164,9766,3566,6827,132Numberremainingondockets----------111193423773615367165988891,104968TERMS199219931994Casesarguedduringterm-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------1169994Numberdisposedofbyfullopinions----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------1119391Numberdisposedofbypercuriamopinions------------------------------------------------------------------------------------1463Numbersetforreargument---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------000Casesgrantedreviewthisterm----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------10029996Casesreviewedanddecidedwithoutoralargument-------------------------------------------------------------------------------109370469Totalcasestobeavailableforargumentatoutsetoffollowingterm---------------------------------------------------------46240391DoesnotincludeNo.91-2086,dismissedperRule46,April12,1993.2Includes93-714,suggestionofmootness.3Includes92-6259,deniedJune14,1993.4IncludesS-1.June29,1995515ind$$BV 08-25-98 19:03:00 PGT*INDBV (Bound Volume)I N D E XABUSE OF DISCRETION STANDARD OF REVIEW.
