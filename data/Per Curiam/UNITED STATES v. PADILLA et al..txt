The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuithas adopted what it terms a "coconspirator exception" to therule regarding who may challenge the constitutionality ofa search or seizure. Under its reasoning, a co-conspiratorobtains a legitimate expectation of privacy for FourthAmendment purposes if he has either a supervisory role inthe conspiracy or joint control over the place or propertyinvolved in the search or seizure. This "exception," apparently developed in a series of earlier decisions of the Courtof Appeals, squarely contradicts the controlling case fromthis Court. We therefore reject it.While patrolling Interstate Highway 10 in Casa Grande,Arizona, Officer Russel Fifer spotted a Cadillac travelingwestbound at approximately 65 miles per hour. Fifer followed the Cadillac for several miles because he thought thedriver acted suspiciously as he passed the patrol car. Fiferultimately stopped the Cadillac because it was going tooslowly. Luis Arciniega, the driver and sole occupant of thecar, gave Fifer his driver's license and an insurance carddemonstrating that respondent Donald Simpson, a UnitedStates customs agent, owned the Cadillac. Fifer and RobertWilliamson, an officer who appeared on the scene to assistFifer, believed that Arciniega matched the drug courier pro-file. Acting on this belief, they requested and received Arci*John Wesley Hall, Jr., filed a brief for the National Association ofCriminal Defense Lawyers as amicus curiae urging affirmance.508us1$68z 01-18-96 11:50:30 PAGES OPINPGT79Cite as: 508 U.

The officers found560 pounds of cocaine in the trunk and immediately arrested Arciniega.After agreeing to make a controlled delivery of the cocaine, Arciniega made a telephone call to his contact froma motel in Tempe, Arizona. Respondents Jorge and MariaPadilla drove to the motel in response to the telephone call,but were arrested as they attempted to drive away in theCadillac. Like Arciniega, Maria Padilla agreed to cooperatewith law enforcement officials. She led them to the house inwhich her husband, respondent Xavier Padilla, was staying.The ensuing investigation linked Donald Simpson and hiswife, respondent Maria Sylvia Simpson, to Xavier Padilla.1Respondents were charged with conspiracy to distributeand possess with intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of21 U. S. C. $ 846, and possession of cocaine with intent to dis-tribute, in violation of $ 841(a)(1). Xavier Padilla was alsocharged with engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise,in violation of 21 U. S. C. $ 848 (1988 ed. and Supp. III). Respondents moved to suppress all evidence discovered in thecourse of the investigation, claiming that the evidence wasthe fruit of the unlawful investigatory stop of Arciniega's vehicle. The United States District Court for the District ofArizona ruled that all respondents were entitled to challengethe stop and search because they were involved in "a jointventure for transportation . . . that had control of the contraband."

The District Court reasoned that, as owners, the Simpsons retained a reasonableexpectation of privacy in their car, but that the Padillas could1 A related investigation led by the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA)revealed that Warren Strubbe was also involved in the conspiracy. Although Strubbe technically is a respondent in this case, see this Court'sRule 12.4, the Court of Appeals found that he could not challenge the stopand search of the Cadillac. Strubbe did not file a petition challengingthat decision, and we therefore do not address that aspect of the court'sopinion.508us1$68z 01-18-96 11:50:30 PAGES OPINPGT80 UNITED STATES v. PADILLAPer Curiamcontest the stop solely because of their supervisory roles andtheir "joint control over a very sophisticated operation . . . ."Id., at 23a. On the merits, the District Court ruled thatOfficer Fifer lacked reasonable suspicion to stop Arciniega,2and granted respondents' motion to suppress.The Court of Appeals affirmed in part, vacated in part,and remanded. The court began its analysis by stating thatin order "[t]o contest the legality of a search and seizure,the defendants must establish that they had a `legitimateexpectation of privacy' in the place searched or the propertyseized." 960 F. 2d 854, 858-859 (CA9 1992) (quoting Rakasv.Illinois, 439 U. S. 128, 143-144 (1978)). The court thenrecited its co-conspirator rule: "[A] coconspirator's participation in an operation or arrangement that indicates joint con-trol and supervision of the place searched establishes standing." 960 F. 2d, at 859 (citations omitted).Relying on a line of cases from the Ninth Circuit, the courtheld that "because Xavier Padilla and Donald and MariaSimpson have demonstrated joint control and supervisionover the drugs and vehicle and engaged in an active partici-pation in a formalized business arrangement, they havestanding to claim a legitimate expectation of privacy in theproperty searched and the items seized."

Thecourt expressly stated that it did not matter that Padilla wasnot present during the stop, or that he could not excludeothers from searching the Cadillac. Ibid.The Court of Appeals could not tell from the recordwhether Jorge and Maria Padilla "shared any responsibilityfor the enterprise," or whether they were "mere employeesin a family operation."Id., at 861. As a result, the courtremanded to the District Court for further findings on thatissue.The Ninth Circuit appears to stand alone in embracing the"coconspirator exception." 3 We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict, 506 U. S. 952 (1992), and now reverse. Ithas long been the rule that a defendant can urge the suppression of evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment only if that defendant demonstrates that his FourthAmendment rights were violated by the challenged search orseizure. Alderman v. United States, 394 U. S. 165, 171-172(1969); Rakas v. Illinois, supra, at 131, n. 1, 133-134; Rawlings v. Kentucky, 448 U. S. 98, 106 (1980). We applied thisprinciple to the case of co-conspirators in Alderman, inwhich we said:"The established principle is that suppression of theproduct of a Fourth Amendment violation can be successfully urged only by those whose rights were violated3 The First, Second, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, Eleventh, and District of Columbia Circuits have declined to adopt an exception for co-conspirators orcodefendants.

S., at 171-172.In Rakas, supra, a police search of a car yielded a box ofrifle shells found in the glove compartment and a sawed-offrifle found under the passenger seat. We held that petition-ers, who were passengers in the car and had no ownershipinterest in the rifle shells or sawed-off rifle, and no legitimateexpectation of privacy in the area searched, had suffered noinvasion of their Fourth Amendment rights. See also Rawlings, supra; Soldal v. Cook County, 506 U. S. 56, 62-64(1992) (decided since the Court of Appeals rendered its decision in the present case).The "coconspirator exception" developed by the Ninth Circuit is, therefore, not only contrary to the holding of Alderman, but at odds with the principle discussed above. Expec-tations of privacy and property interests govern the analysisof Fourth Amendment search and seizure claims. Partici-pants in a criminal conspiracy may have such expectationsor interests, but the conspiracy itself neither adds to nor de-tracts from them. Neither the fact, for example, that MariaSimpson was the "communication link" between her husbandand the others, nor the fact that Donald Simpson and XavierPadilla were in charge of transportation for the conspirators,has any bearing on their respective Fourth Amendmentrights.We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals. The case is remanded so that the court may considerwhether each respondent had either a property interest protected by the Fourth Amendment that was interfered withby the stop of the automobile driven by Arciniega, or a reasonable expectation of privacy that was invaded by thesearch thereof. Alderman, supra; Rakas, supra; Rawlings,supra; Soldal, supra. It is so ordered.508us1$69I 02-13-97 13:58:53 PAGES OPINPGT83OCTOBER TERM, 1992SyllabusCARDINAL CHEMICAL CO. et al. v. MORTONINTERNATIONAL, INC.certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe federal circuitNo. 92-114. Argued March 3, 1993--Decided May 17, 1993Since its 1987 decisions in Vieau v. Japax, Inc., 823 F. 2d 1510, and FonarCorp. v. Johnson & Johnson, 821 F. 2d 627, the Court of Appeals for theFederal Circuit, which has exclusive jurisdiction over appeals from allFederal District Courts in patent litigation, has followed the practiceof routinely vacating declaratory judgments regarding patent validityfollowing a determination of noninfringement of the patent. Adheringto that practice in this and a similar case brought by respondent, theFederal Circuit affirmed the District Courts' findings that the particulardefendants had not infringed respondent's two patents on chemical compounds used in polyvinyl chloride, and then vacated the entry of judgments, on the defendants' counterclaims, declaring the patents invalid.A third such case is still pending. Petitioners, the alleged infringers inthis case, sought certiorari on the ground that the Federal Circuit haserred in applying a per se rule to what should be a discretionary matter.Respondent did not oppose the grant of certiorari, but instead pointedout that it also has an interest in having the validity issue adjudicated,in that its patents have been effectively stripped of any power in themarketplace by the Federal Circuit's refusals of substantive review onthe two invalidity findings.Held: The Federal Circuit's affirmance of a finding that a patent has notbeen infringed is not per se a sufficient reason for vacating a declaratoryjudgment holding the patent invalid. Pp. 89-103.(a) The Vieau and Fonar opinions indicate that the practice of vacating such declaratory judgments is limited to cases in which the FederalCircuit is convinced that the finding of noninfringement has entirelyresolved the controversy between the litigants by resolving the initialcomplaint brought by the patentee. The Federal Circuit has concludedthat in such cases the declaratory judgment is "moot" in a jurisdictionalsense, a conclusion that it considers dictated by this Court's earlier opinions in Electrical Fittings Corp. v. Thomas & Betts Co., 307 U. S. 241,and Altvater v. Freeman, 319 U. S. 359. Pp. 89-92.(b) While both Electrical Fittings and Altvater are consistent withthe Federal Circuit practice at issue, neither case required it. Electrical Fittings did not involve a declaratory judgment, and Altvater does508us1$69I 02-13-97 13:58:53 PAGES OPINPGT84 CARDINAL CHEMICAL CO. v. MORTON INT'L, INC.Syllabusnot necessarily answer the question whether, in the absence of an ongoing infringement dispute between the parties, an invalidity adjudicationwould be moot. Pp. 93-95.(c) This case did not become moot when the Federal Circuit affirmedthe District Court's noninfringement finding. The practice at issue concerns the Federal Circuit's jurisdiction. Where, as here, the DistrictCourt has jurisdiction (established independently from its jurisdictionover the patentee's infringement charge) to consider an invalidity counterclaim, so does the Federal Circuit, which is not a court of last resortand is entitled to presume, absent further information, that federal jurisdiction continues. If, before the Federal Circuit had decided thiscase, either party had advised it of a material change in circumstancesthat entirely terminated their controversy, it would have been propereither to dismiss the appeal or to vacate the District Court's entire judgment. In fact, however, there was no such change. The Federal Circuit's decision to rely on one of two possible alternative grounds (noninfringement rather than invalidity) did not strip it of power to decide thesecond question, particularly when its decree was subject to review bythis Court. Even if it may be good practice to decide no more than isnecessary to determine an appeal, it is clear that the Federal Circuithas jurisdiction to review the declaratory judgment of invalidity. Accordingly, the practice at issue is not supported by Article III's "case orcontroversy" requirement. Pp. 95-98.(d) The Federal Circuit's practice cannot be supported on othergrounds. Although the court's interest in the efficient management ofits docket might support a rule requiring that the infringement issuealways be addressed before validity, there are even more importantcountervailing concerns, including the successful litigant's interest inpreserving the value of its hard-won declaratory judgment; the public'sstrong interests in the finality of judgments in patent litigation and inresolving validity questions; and the patentee's interests in having thevalidity issue correctly adjudicated and in avoiding the loss of its patent's practical value that may be a consequence of routine vacatur. Thepractice in question denies the patentee appellate review, prolongs thelife of invalid patents, encourages endless litigation (or at least uncertainty) over the validity of outstanding patents, and thereby vitiates therule announced in Blonder-Tongue Laboratories, Inc. v. University ofIll. Foundation, 402 U. S. 313. Pp. 99-102.(e) It would be an abuse of discretion not to decide the validity issuein this case. Although factors in an unusual case might justify the Federal Circuit's refusal to reach the merits of a validity determination, andthat determination might therefore be appropriately vacated, neitherthe finding of noninfringement alone, nor anything else in the record,508us1$69I 02-13-97 13:58:53 PAGES OPINPGT85Cite as: 508 U. S. 83 (1993)Opinion of the Courtjustifies such a result here. The patents at issue have been the subjectof three separate lawsuits, and both parties have asked the Federal Circuit to resolve their ongoing validity dispute.

While this case was pending in the District Court,Morton filed two other actions against other alleged in-fringers of the same patents. One was filed in the EasternDistrict of Louisiana, the other in the District of Delaware.The defendants in both cases, like Cardinal, filed counterclaims for declaratory judgments that the patents were in-valid. Of the three, the Louisiana case was tried first and,in 1988, resulted in a judgment for the defendant finding noinfringement and declaring the patents invalid.2 On appeal,the Federal Circuit affirmed the finding of no infringementbut vacated the judgment of invalidity.3 The Delaware caseis still pending.In 1990 this case proceeded to a 5-day bench trial. TheSouth Carolina District Court concluded, as had the Louisi-ana District Court, that the patentee had failed to prove infringement and that the defendant-counterclaimant hadproved by clear and convincing evidence that both patentswere invalid.4 Accordingly, the court mandated two sepa2 Morton Thiokol, Inc. v.

The court explained its disposition of the judgment of invalidity as follows: "We hold that the finding of no literal infringement isnot clearly erroneous and on that basis we affirm the portion of the judgment of the district court that determined that the patents are not infringed and dismissed the suit.

Cardinal filed a cross-appeal contendingthat it was entitled to an award of fees pursuant to 35 U. S. C.$ 285 and that Morton should be sanctioned for prosecutinga frivolous appeal. The defendant in the third, Delaware,case filed a briefamicus curiae urging the court to affirmthe judgment of invalidity.6 Again, however, after affirmingthe dismissal of the infringement claim, the Federal Circuitvacated the declaratory judgment. It explained:"Since we have affirmed the district court's holdingthat the patents at issue have not been infringed, weneed not address the question of validity.

Although both Morton and Cardinal do agree onthe correct answer to the question presented, they do so only so that theycan reach their true dispute: the validity of Morton's two patents, a subjecton which they are in absolute disagreement. Further, it is clear that nocollusion between the parties has brought them here; if anything hasdulled the adverseness between them, it is the Federal Circuit practicethat is the subject of this case.

Japax,Inc., 823 F. 2d 1510, is a matter of special importance to theentire Nation. We therefore granted certiorari. 506 U.

The Federal Circuit's improperfinding of mootness cannot itself moot this case.508us1$69I 02-13-97 13:58:53 PAGES OPINPGT90 CARDINAL CHEMICAL CO. v. MORTON INT'L, INC.Opinion of the Courtcases decided by different panels of that court on the sameday. In Vieau, the patentee had appealed adverse rulingson damages, infringement, and validity and the alleged in-fringer had filed a cross-appeal asserting that the DistrictCourt should have declared the patent invalid. After af-firming the District Court's finding of noninfringement, theFederal Circuit concluded:"Our disposition on the issue of infringement rendersmoot the appeal of the propriety of a directed verdict onthe issues of damages and willful infringement. Thereis no indication that Japax's cross-appeal on invalidityextends beyond the litigated claims or the accused de-vices found to be noninfringing. Accordingly, we alsodismiss the cross-appeal as moot. The judgment en-tered by the district court with respect to each of themooted issues is therefore vacated. It is affirmed withrespect to infringement." 823 F. 2d, at 1517.Judge Bennett filed a concurring opinion, fleshing out thisperfunctory holding and explaining that there was no needto review the declaratory judgment of invalidity in the ab-sence of any "continuing dispute (such as the presence orthreat of further litigation) regarding other claims or otheraccused devices that remains unresolved by the finding ofnoninfringement." 10In the second case, Fonar Corp. v. Johnson & Johnson,821 F. 2d 627 (CA Fed. 1987), the District Court had heldthat the patent was not infringed and that the defendant10 Vieau, 823 F. 2d, at 1520. He added: "It is the burden of the partyseeking the declaratory judgment to illustrate, either in its briefs or atoral argument, the continued existence of a case or controversy should adecision of noninfringement be made by this court in deciding the appeal.See International Medical Prosthetics, 787 F. 2d at 575, 229 USPQ at 281(burden is on declaratory plaintiff to establish that jurisdiction existed at,and has continued since, the time the complaint was filed). This requirement avoids having this court unnecessarily address what might turn outto be a hypothetical situation." Ibid.508us1$69I 02-13-97 13:58:53 PAGES OPINPGT91Cite as: 508 U.

Id., at 634.A footnote emphasized that there was no longer any dispute between the parties beyond the specific charge of infringement that had been resolved by the finding of noninfringement.11The three opinions in Vieau and Fonar indicate that theFederal Circuit's practice of vacating declaratory judgmentsof patent validity (or invalidity) is limited to cases in whichthe court is convinced that the finding of noninfringementhas entirely resolved the controversy between the litigants11 "The record contains no assertion that J & J infringes the '832 patentby any methods other than those found not to infringe, or that J & J'smachines infringe the nonasserted apparatus claims.

S. 83 (1993)Opinion of the CourtIIIn Electrical Fittings, the District Court held one claimof a patent valid but not infringed.14 The patentee was content with that judgment, but the successful defendant appealed, seeking a reversal of the finding of validity. TheCourt of Appeals dismissed the appeal based on the rule thata prevailing party may not appeal from a judgment in itsfavor. We reversed, and held that although the defendantcould not compel the appellate court to revisit the finding ofvalidity (which had become immaterial to the disposition ofthe case), it could demand that the finding of validity be vacated. That finding, we explained, "stands as an adjudication of one of the issues litigated. We think the petitionerswere entitled to have this portion of the decree eliminated,and that the Circuit Court of Appeals had jurisdiction, as wehave held this Court has, to entertain the appeal, not for thepurpose of passing on the merits, but to direct the reformation of the decree." Electrical Fittings, 307 U. S., at 242(footnotes omitted).Our command that the validity decision be eliminated wassimilar to the Federal Circuit's mandate in the Fonar case(both cases suggest that an appellate court should vacateunnecessary decisions regarding patent validity), but the twocases are critically different. The issue of invalidity in Electrical Fittings was raised only as an affirmative defense tothe charge that a presumptively valid patent had been infringed,15 not (as in Fonar, and as here) as a basis for a counterclaim seeking a declaratory judgment of patent invalidity.An unnecessary ruling on an affirmative defense is not the14 "Instead of dismissing the bill without more, it entered a decree adjudicating claim 1 valid but dismissing the bill for failure to prove infringement." 307 U. S., at 242.15 Under 35 U. S. C. $ 282, all patents are presumed valid. Althoughthat presumption is obviously resurrected after the Federal Circuit vacates a finding of invalidity, Morton's current situation makes clear thatthe revived presumption lacks some of its earlier strength.508us1$69I 02-13-97 13:58:53 PAGES OPINPGT94 CARDINAL CHEMICAL CO. v. MORTON INT'L, INC.Opinion of the Courtsame as the necessary resolution of a counterclaim for adeclaratory judgment.In Altvater, as here, the defendant did file a counterclaimseeking a declaratory judgment that the patent was invalid.The District Court found no infringement, but also grantedthe declaratory judgment requested by the defendant. TheCourt of Appeals affirmed the noninfringement holding but,reasoning that the validity issue was therefore moot, vacatedthe declaratory judgment. We reversed. Distinguishingour holding in Electrical Fittings, we wrote:"To hold a patent valid if it is not infringed is to decidea hypothetical case. But the situation in the presentcase is quite different. We have here not only bill andanswer but a counterclaim. Though the decision of noninfringement disposes of the bill and answer, it does notdispose of the counterclaim which raises the questionof validity. . . . [T]he issue of validity may be raised bya counterclaim in an infringement suit. The requirements of case or controversy are of course no less strictunder the Declaratory Judgments Act (48 Stat. 955, 28U. S. C. $ 400) than in case of other suits. But we are ofthe view that the issues raised by the present counterclaim were justiciable and that the controversy betweenthe parties did not come to an end on the dismissal ofthe bill for non-infringement, since their dispute wentbeyond the single claim and the particular accused devices involved in that suit." 319 U. S., at 363-364 (footnotes omitted; citations omitted).Presumably because we emphasized, in the last clausequoted, the ongoing nature of the Altvater parties' dispute,the Federal Circuit has assumed that a defendant's counterclaim under the Declaratory Judgment Act should always be508us1$69I 02-13-97 13:58:53 PAGES OPINPGT95Cite as: 508 U. S. 83 (1993)Opinion of the Courtvacated unless the parties' dispute extends beyond the termsof the patentee's charge of infringement.16While both of our earlier cases are consistent with theFederal Circuit practice established in Vieau and Fonar, neither one required it. Electrical Fittings did not involve adeclaratory judgment, andAltvater does not necessarily an-swer the question whether, in the absence of an ongoing dispute between the parties over infringement, an adjudicationof invalidity would be moot. We now turn to that question.IIIUnder its current practice, the Federal Circuit uniformlydeclares that the issue of patent validity is "moot" if it affirms the District Court's finding of noninfringement and if,as in the usual case, the dispute between the parties doesnot extend beyond the patentee's particular claim of infringe-ment. That practice, and the issue before us, therefore concern the jurisdiction of an intermediate appellate court--notthe jurisdiction of either a trial court or this Court. In thetrial court, of course, a party seeking a declaratory judgmenthas the burden of establishing the existence of an actual caseor controversy. Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth, 300 U. S.227, 240-241 (1937).17In patent litigation, a party may satisfy that burden, andseek a declaratory judgment, even if the patentee has notfiled an infringement action. Judge Markey has described"the sad and saddening scenario that led to enactmentof the Declaratory Judgment Act (Act), 28 U. S. C.$ 2201. In the patent version of that scenario, a patentowner engages in adanse macabre, brandishing a Dam16 See Vieau, 823 F. 2d, at 1518-1521 (Bennett, J., concurring); Fonar,821 F. 2d, at 634, and n. 2.17 As we have noted, the Declaratory Judgment Act affords the districtcourt some discretion in determining whether or not to exercise that jurisdiction, even when it has been established. See Brillhart v. Excess Ins.Co. of America, 316 U. S. 491, 494-496 (1942).508us1$69I 02-13-97 13:58:53 PAGES OPINPGT96 CARDINAL CHEMICAL CO. v. MORTON INT'L, INC.Opinion of the Courtoclean threat with a sheathed sword. . . . Before the Act,competitors victimized by that tactic were renderedhelpless and immobile so long as the patent owner re-fused to grasp the nettle and sue. After the Act, thosecompetitors were no longer restricted to an in terroremchoice between the incurrence of a growing potential liability for patent infringement and abandonment of theirenterprises; they could clear the air by suing for a judgment that would settle the conflict of interests. Thesole requirement for jurisdiction under the Act is thatthe conflict be real and immediate, i. e., that there be atrue, actual `controversy' required by the Act."Arrowhead Industrial Water, Inc. v. Ecolochem, Inc., 846 F. 2d731, 734-735 (CA Fed. 1988) (citations omitted).Merely the desire to avoid the threat of a "scarecrow" patent,in Learned Hand's phrase,18 may therefore be sufficient toestablish jurisdiction under the Declaratory Judgment Act.If, in addition to that desire, a party has actually beencharged with infringement of the patent, there is, necessarily, a case or controversy adequate to support jurisdiction ofa complaint, or a counterclaim, under the Act. In this case,therefore, it is perfectly clear that the District Court hadjurisdiction to entertain Cardinal's counterclaim for a declaratory judgment of invalidity.It is equally clear that the Federal Circuit, even after affirming the finding of noninfringement, had jurisdiction toconsider Morton's appeal from the declaratory judgment ofinvalidity. A party seeking a declaratory judgment of inva-lidity presents a claim independent of the patentee's chargeof infringement. If the District Court has jurisdiction (es-tablished independently from its jurisdiction over the patentee's charge of infringement) to consider that claim, sodoes (barring any intervening events) the Federal Circuit.18 Bresnick v. United States Vitamin Corp., 139 F. 2d 239, 242 (CA21943).508us1$69I 02-13-97 13:58:53 PAGES OPINPGT97Cite as: 508 U. S. 83 (1993)Opinion of the CourtThere are two independent bases for this conclusion.First, the Federal Circuit is not a court of last resort. Ifthat court had jurisdiction while the case was pending beforeit, the case remains alive (barring other changes) when itcomes to us. The Federal Circuit's determination that thepatents were not infringed is subject to review in this Court,and if we reverse that determination, we are not preventedfrom considering the question of validity merely because alower court thought it superfluous. As a matter of practice,the possibility that we would grant certiorari simply to review that court's resolution of an infringement issue is extremely remote, but as a matter of law we could do so, andif we did, we could also reach the declaratory judgment, aslong as the parties continued to dispute the issue of validity,as they do here.19 As this case demonstrates, nothing prevents us, as a jurisdictional matter, from reviewing the Federal Circuit's disposition (even its vacatur) of the DistrictCourt's resolution of the declaratory judgment counterclaim.19 Commenting on Electrical Fittings, in Deposit Guaranty Nat. Bankv. Roper, 445 U. S. 326, 335 (1980), we wrote: "Although the Court limitedthe appellate function to reformation of the decree, the holding relevantto the instant case was that the federal courts retained jurisdiction overthe controversy notwithstanding the District Court's entry of judgmentin favor of petitioners. This Court had the question of mootness beforeit, yet because policy considerations permitted an appeal from the DistrictCourt's final judgment and because petitioners alleged a stake in the outcome, the case was still live and dismissal was not required by Art. III.The Court perceived the distinction between the definitive mootness of acase or controversy, which ousts the jurisdiction of the federal courts andrequires dismissal of the case, and a judgment in favor of a party at anintermediate stage of litigation, which does not in all cases terminate theright to appeal." See also 959 F. 2d, at 953 (Lourie, J., concurring) ("[B]ecause this court is not a court of last resort, a holding of either invalidityor noninfringement by our court does not render the case moot becauseit is not over. Therefore, when both infringement and validity issuesare presented on appeal, we can base our affirmance on both grounds,thereby leaving a complete judgment available for review by the Supreme Court").508us1$69I 02-13-97 13:58:53 PAGES OPINPGT98 CARDINAL CHEMICAL CO. v. MORTON INT'L, INC.Opinion of the CourtSecond, while the initial burden of establishing the trialcourt's jurisdiction rests on the party invoking that jurisdiction, once that burden has been met courts are entitled topresume, absent further information, that jurisdiction continues. If a party to an appeal suggests that the contro-versy has, since the rendering of judgment below, becomemoot, that party bears the burden of coming forward withthe subsequent events that have produced that alleged result. See United States v. W. T. Grant Co., 345 U. S. 629, 633(1953).20 In this case Cardinal properly invoked the originaljurisdiction of the District Court, and Morton properly invoked the appellate jurisdiction of the Federal Circuit.That court unquestionably had the power to decide all theissues raised on Morton's appeal. If, before the court haddecided the case, either party had advised it of a materialchange in circumstances that entirely terminated the party'scontroversy, it would have been proper either to dismiss theappeal or to vacate the entire judgment of the DistrictCourt. Cf. United States v. Munsingwear, Inc., 340 U. S. 36,39 (1950). In fact, however, there was no such changein this case. The Federal Circuit's decision to rely onone of two possible alternative grounds (noninfringementrather than invalidity) did not strip it of power to decidethe second question, particularly when its decree was subject to review by this Court. Even if it may be good practice to decide no more than is necessary to determine anappeal, it is clear that the Federal Circuit had jurisdiction toreview the declaratory judgment of invalidity. The case didnot become moot when that court affirmed the finding ofnoninfringement.20 To the extent that the Federal Circuit, relying on Judge Bennett'sconcurrence in Vieau, see n. 10, infra, would have imposed the burden onCardinal to show that jurisdiction over its counterclaim, once establishedin the District Court, continued to attach before the Court of Appeals, itwould therefore have been in error. Bearing the initial burden of establishing jurisdiction is different from establishing that it has disappeared.508us1$69I 02-13-97 13:58:53 PAGES OPINPGT99Cite as: 508 U. S. 83 (1993)Opinion of the CourtIVThe Federal Circuit's practice is therefore neither compelled by our cases nor supported by the "case or contro-versy" requirement of Article III. Of course, its practicemight nevertheless be supported on other grounds. Thecourts of appeals have significant authority to fashionrules to govern their own procedures. See, e. g., OrtegaRodriguez v. United States, 507 U. S. 234, 244, 246, 249-250(1993); Thomas v. Arn, 474 U. S. 140, 146-148 (1985). Justas we have adhered to a practice of deciding cases on statutory rather than constitutional grounds when both alternatives are available, see, e. g., Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v.Florida Gulf Coast Building and Construction TradesCouncil, 485 U. S. 568, 575 (1988), there might be a sufficientreason always to address the infringement issue before passing on the patent's validity. If, for example, the validity issues were generally more difficult and time consuming toresolve, the interest in the efficient management of thecourt's docket might support such a rule.Although it is often more difficult to determine whether apatent is valid than whether it has been infringed, there areeven more important countervailing concerns. Perhaps themost important is the interest of the successful litigant inpreserving the value of a declaratory judgment that, as ChiefJudge Nies noted, "it obtained on a valid counterclaim atgreat effort and expense." 21 A company once charged with21 967 F. 2d 1521, 1577 (CA Fed. 1992) (Nies, C. J., dissenting from denialof rehearing en banc). As she added in a footnote: "Nor should we beunmindful of the expense and effort of the district court. Judge AvernCohn of the Eastern District of Michigan (the Vieau trial judge) stated,in a panel discussion at our most recent Judicial Conference: `I took sixmonths to write a JNOV, found the patent invalid and not infringed andwas very proud of my work product. And when I read that court ofappeals opinion and found that my finding of invalidity had been vacated,there was no case or controversy, I was in a state of shock for ten minutes.'Cohn, Remarks at the Patent Breakout Session of the Tenth Annual Judi508us1$69I 02-13-97 13:58:53 PAGES OPINPGT100 CARDINAL CHEMICAL CO. v. MORTON INT'L, INC.Opinion of the Courtinfringement must remain concerned about the risk of sim-ilar charges if it develops and markets similar products inthe future. Given that the burden of demonstrating thatchanged circumstances provide a basis for vacating the judgment of patent invalidity rests on the party that seeks suchaction, there is no reason why a successful litigant shouldhave any duty to disclose its future plans to justify retentionof the value of the judgment that it has obtained.22Moreover, our prior cases have identified a strong publicinterest in the finality of judgments in patent litigation. InSinclair & Carroll Co. v. Interchemical Corp., 325 U. S. 327(1945), we approved of the District Court's decision to consider the question of validity even though it had found thata patent had not been infringed. Criticizing the contraryapproach taken by other courts, we stated that "of the twoquestions, validity has the greater public importance, Coverv. Schwartz, 133 F. 2d 541 [(CA2 1943)], and the DistrictCourt in this case followed what will usually be the betterpractice by inquiring fully into the validity of this patent."Id., at 330.We also emphasized the importance to the public at largeof resolving questions of patent validity inBlonder-TongueLaboratories, Inc. v. University of Ill. Foundation, 402 U. S.313 (1971). In that case we overruled Triplett v. Lowell,297 U. S. 638 (1936), which had held that a determination ofpatent invalidity does not estop the patentee from relitigat-ing the issue in a later case brought against another allegedinfringer. We also commented at length on the wastefulcial Conference of the United States Court of Appeals for the FederalCircuit 65 (April 30, 1992)." Id., at 1577, n. 9.22 Altvater cannot be read to require such a disclosure. In that case,the counterclaimant was a licensee, and there was no question but that itsobligations to the patentee would continue unless the patent were foundinvalid. Our holding did not depend on that fact, however, and we nowhere stated that a counterclaimant could seek the affirmance of a declaratory judgment only if it ensured that its future actions would continue toviolate the patentee's alleged rights.508us1$69I 02-13-97 13:58:53 PAGES OPINPGT101Cite as: 508 U. S. 83 (1993)Opinion of the Courtconsequences of relitigating the validity of a patent after ithas once been held invalid in a fair trial,23 and we noted thedanger that the opportunity to relitigate might, as a practicalmatter, grant monopoly privileges to the holders of invalidpatents.24 As this case demonstrates, the Federal Circuit'spractice of routinely vacating judgments of validity afterfinding noninfringement creates a similar potential for reliti-gation and imposes ongoing burdens on competitors who areconvinced that a patent has been correctly found invalid.Indeed, as Morton's current predicament illustrates, seesupra, at 89, the Federal Circuit's practice injures not only23 "In any lawsuit where a defendant, because of the mutuality principle,is forced to present a complete defense on the merits to a claim which theplaintiff has fully litigated and lost in a prior action, there is an arguablemisallocation of resources. To the extent the defendant in the second suitmay not win by asserting, without contradiction, that the plaintiff hadfully and fairly, but unsuccessfully, litigated the same claim in the priorsuit, the defendant's time and money are diverted from alternative uses--productive or otherwise--to relitigation of a decided issue. And, still assuming that the issue was resolved correctly in the first suit, there isreason to be concerned about the plaintiff's allocation of resources. Permitting repeated litigation of the same issue as long as the supply of unrelateddefendants holds out reflects either the aura of the gaming table or `a lackof discipline and of disinterestedness on the part of the lower courts,hardly a worthy or wise basis for fashioning rules of procedure.' KerotestMfg. Co. v. C-O-Two Co., 342 U. S. 180, 185 (1952)." 402 U. S., at 329.24 "In each successive suit the patentee enjoys the statutory presumption of validity, and so may easily put the alleged infringer to his expensiveproof. As a consequence, prospective defendants will often decide thatpaying royalties under a license or other settlement is preferable to thecostly burden of challenging the patent." Id., at 338."The tendency of Triplett to multiply the opportunities for holders ofinvalid patents to exact licensing agreements or other settlements fromalleged infringers must be considered in the context of other decisions ofthis Court. Although recognizing the patent system's desirable stimulusto invention, we have also viewed the patent as a monopoly which, although sanctioned by law, has the economic consequences attending othermonopolies. A patent yielding returns for a device that fails to meet thecongressionally imposed criteria of patentability is anomalous."

MORTON INT'L, INC.Opinion of the Courtthe alleged infringer and the public; it also may unfairly de-prive the patentee itself of the appellate review that is acomponent of the one full and fair opportunity to have thevalidity issue adjudicated correctly. If, following a findingof noninfringement, a declaratory judgment on validity isroutinely vacated, whether it invalidated the patent (as inVieau) or upheld it (as in Fonar), the patentee may have lostthe practical value of a patent that should be enforceableagainst different infringing devices. The Federal Circuit'spractice denies the patentee such appellate review, prolongsthe life of invalid patents, encourages endless litigation (orat least uncertainty) over the validity of outstanding patents, and thereby vitiates the rule announced in Blonder-Tongue.25In rejecting the Federal Circuit's practice we acknowledgethat factors in an unusual case might justify that court's refusal to reach the merits of a validity determination--a de-termination which it might therefore be appropriate to vacate. A finding of noninfringment alone, however, does notjustify such a result. Nor does anything else in the recordof this case. The two patents at issue here have been thesubject of three separate lawsuits, and both parties have25 The Federal Circuit's practice has been the subject of a good deal ofscholarly comment, all of which has consistently criticized the practice.See R.
