Pro se petitioner Cross seeks leave to proceed in formapauperis under Rule 39 of this Court. We deny these re-quests as frivolous pursuant to Rule 39.8. Cross is alloweduntil June 14, 1999, within which to pay the docketing feesrequired by Rule 38 and to submit his petitions in compliancewith this Court's Rule 33.1. We also direct the Clerk notto accept any further petitions for certiorari from Cross innoncriminal matters unless he first pays the docketing feerequired by Rule 38 and submits his petitions in compliancewith Rule 33.1.Cross has repeatedly abused this Court's certiorari process. On March 8, 1999, we invoked Rule 39.8 to deny Crossin forma pauperis status with respect to four petitions forcertiorari. See Cross v. Pelican Bay State Prison, post,p. 1003 (three cases); Cross v. Cambra, post, p. 1003. Beforethat time, Cross had filed six petitions for certiorari, all ofwhich were both patently frivolous and had been denied*Together with No. 98-8487, Cross v. Wieking, Clerk, United StatesDistrict Court for the Northern District of California, also on motion forleave to proceed in forma pauperis.526US3 Unit: $U65 [11-24-99 07:06:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN812 CROSS v. PELICAN BAY STATE PRISONStevens, J., dissentingwithout recorded dissent. The 2 instant petitions bringCross' total number of frivolous filings to 12, and he has 4additional filings--all of them patently frivolous--pendingbefore this Court.We enter the order barring prospective filings for the rea-sons discussed inMartin v. District of Columbia Court ofAppeals, 506 U. S. 1 (1992) (per curiam). Cross' abuse ofthe writ of certiorari has been in noncriminal cases, and welimit our sanction accordingly. The order therefore will notprevent Cross from petitioning to challenge criminal sanc-tions which might be imposed on him. Similarly, becauseCross has not abused this Court's extraordinary writs proce-dures, the order will not prevent him from filing nonfrivolouspetitions for extraordinary writs. The order will, however,allow this Court to devote its limited resources to the claimsof petitioners who have not abused our certiorari process.
