DiPaola, 522 U. S. 965. Petitioner never-theless has filed another frivolous petition with this Court.In her petition, Glendora asserts that the state trial courtjudge who presided over her dispute with her landlord sanctioned "sewer service" by her landlord's lawyers, and thatthe District Court and Court of Appeals sanctioned this conduct. She does not address the District Court's reasons fordismissing her complaint.Accordingly, we enter this order barring prospective informa pauperis filings by petitioner in noncriminal cases forthe reasons discussed in Martin v. District of ColumbiaCourt of Appeals, 506 U. S. 1 (1992) (per curiam).
