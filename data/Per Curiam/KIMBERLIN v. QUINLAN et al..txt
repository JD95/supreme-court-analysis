Argued March 27, 1995--Decided June 14, 1995On his 1986 federal income tax return, Erich Schleier (hereinafter respondent) included as gross income the backpay portion, but not theliquidated damages portion, of an award that he received in settlementof a claim under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967(ADEA). After the Commissioner issued a deficiency notice, assertingthat the liquidated damages should have been included as income, respondent initiated Tax Court proceedings, contesting that ruling andseeking a refund for the tax he had paid on his backpay. The Tax Courtagreed with respondent that the entire settlement constituted "damagesreceived . . . on account of personal injuries or sickness" within themeaning of $ 104(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code and was thereforeexcludable from gross income. The Court of Appeals affirmed.Held: Recovery under the ADEA is not excludable from gross income. Ataxpayer must meet two independent requirements before a recoverymay be excluded under $ 104(a)(2): The underlying cause of action givingrise to the recovery must be "based upon tort or tort type rights," andthe damages must have been received "on account of personal injuriesor sickness." Respondent has failed to satisfy either requirement.Pp. 327-337.(a) No part of respondent's settlement is excludable under $ 104(a)(2)'splain language. Recovery for back wages does not satisfy the criticalrequirement of being "on account of" any personal injury, and no personal injury affected the amount of back wages recovered. In addition,this Court explicitly held in Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston, 469U. S. 111, 125, that Congress intended the ADEA's liquidated damagesto be punitive in nature; thus, they serve no compensatory functionand cannot be described as being "on account of personal injuries."Pp. 327-332.(b) There is also no basis for excluding respondent's recovery fromgross income under the Commissioner's regulation interpreting$ 104(a)(2). Even if respondent were correct that this action is basedon "tort or tort type rights" within 26 CFR $ 1.104-1(c)'s meaning, thisrequirement is not a substitute for the statutory requirement that theamount be received "on account of personal injuries or sickness"; it isan additional requirement.

SCHLEIEROpinion of the Court(c) Nor is respondent's recovery based upon "tort or tort type rights"as that term was construed in United States v. Burke, 504 U. S. 229,where this Court rejected the argument that a taxpayer's backpay settlement under the pre-1991 Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964should be excluded from gross income. Two elements that distinguishthe ADEA from the pre-1991 Title VII--namely, the ADEA rights to ajury trial and liquidated damages--are insufficient to bring the ADEAwithin Burke's conception of a "tort or tort type righ[t]," for the statutelacks the primary characteristic of such an action: the availability ofcompensatory damages. Moreover, satisfaction of Burke's "tort or torttype" inquiry does not eliminate the need to satisfy the other requirement for excludability discussed herein.

(United). Pursuant to established policy, United fired respondent when he reached the age of 60.Respondent then filed a complaint in Federal District Courtalleging that his termination violated the ADEA.The ADEA "broadly prohibits arbitrary discrimination inthe workplace based on age." Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U. S.575, 577 (1978); Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston, 469U. S. 111, 120 (1985); see also McKennon v. Nashville Banner Publishing Co., 513 U. S. 352, 357 (1995). Subject tocertain defenses, see 29 U. S.

S. C. $$ 623(a)(1), 631(a). The ADEA incorporates manyof the enforcement and remedial mechanisms of the FairLabor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA). Like the FLSA, theADEA provides for "such legal or equitable relief as may beappropriate to effectuate the purposes of this chapter." 29U. S. C. $ 626(b). That relief may include "without limitationjudgments compelling employment, reinstatement or promotion." Ibid. More importantly for respondent's purposes,the ADEA incorporates FLSA provisions that permit therecovery "of wages lost and an additional equal amount asliquidated damages." $ 216(b). See generally McKennon,513 U. S., at 357.1 Helen Schleier is also a respondent because she and her husband Erichfiled a joint return.515us1$75I 08-13-98 12:36:57 PAGES OPINPGT326 COMMISSIONER v. SCHLEIEROpinion of the CourtDespite these broad remedial mechanisms, there are twoimportant constraints on courts' remedial power under theADEA. First, unlike the FLSA, the ADEA specifically provides that "liquidated damages shall be payable only in casesof willful violations of this chapter." 29 U. S. C. $ 626(b); seeTrans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston, 469 U. S., at 125.Second, the Courts of Appeals have unanimously held, andrespondent does not contest, that the ADEA does not permita separate recovery of compensatory damages for pain andsuffering or emotional distress.2Respondent's ADEA complaint was consolidated with aclass action brought by other former United employees challenging United's policy. The ADEA claims were tried before a jury, which determined that United had committed awillful violation of the ADEA. The District Court enteredjudgment for the plaintiffs, but that judgment was reversedon appeal. See Monroe v. United Air Lines, Inc., 736 F. 2d394 (CA7 1984). The parties then entered into a settlement,pursuant to which respondent received $145,629. Half of respondent's award was attributed to "backpay" and half to"liquidated damages." United did not withhold any payrollor income taxes from the portion of the settlement attributedto liquidated damages.2 See, e. g., Vazquez v. Eastern Air Lines, Inc., 579 F. 2d 107 (CA1 1978);Johnson v. Al Tech Specialties Steel Corp., 731 F. 2d 143, 147 (CA2 1984);Rogers v.

S. 323 (1995)Opinion of the CourtWhen respondent filed his 1986 federal income tax return,he included as gross income the backpay portion of the settlement, but excluded the portion attributed to liquidateddamages. The Commissioner issued a deficiency notice, asserting that respondent should have included the liquidateddamages as gross income. Respondent then initiated proceedings in the Tax Court, claiming that he had properlyexcluded the liquidated damages. Respondent also soughta refund for the tax he had paid on the backpay portion ofthe settlement. The Tax Court agreed with respondent thatthe entire settlement constituted "damages received . . . onaccount of personal injuries or sickness" within the meaningof $ 104(a)(2) of the Tax Code and was therefore excludablefrom gross income. Relying on a prior Circuit decision thathad in turn relied on our decision in United States v. Burke,504 U. S. 229 (1992), the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed. Judgt. order reported at 26 F. 3d 1119 (1994).Because the Courts of Appeals have reached inconsistentconclusions as to the taxability of ADEA recoveries in gen-eral and of the United settlement in particular, compareDowney v. Commissioner, 33 F. 3d 836 (CA7 1994) (Unitedsettlement award is taxable), withSchmitz v. Commissioner,34 F. 3d 790 (CA9 1994) (United settlement award is excludable), we granted certiorari, 513 U. S. 998 (1994). Our con-sideration of the plain language of $ 104(a), the text of theregulation implementing $ 104(a)(2), and our reasoning inBurke convince us that a recovery under the ADEA is notexcludable from gross income.IISection 61(a) of the Internal Revenue Code provides abroad definition of "gross income": "Except as otherwise provided in this subtitle, gross income means all income fromwhatever source derived." 26 U. S. C. $ 61(a). We have repeatedly emphasized the "sweeping scope" of this sectionand its statutory predecessors. Commissioner v. Glenshaw515us1$75I 08-13-98 12:36:58 PAGES OPINPGT328 COMMISSIONER v. SCHLEIEROpinion of the CourtGlass Co., 348 U. S. 426, 429 (1955). See also United Statesv. Burke, 504 U. S., at 233; Helvering v. Clifford, 309 U. S.331, 334 (1940). We have also emphasized the corollary to$ 61(a)'s broad construction, namely, the "default rule of statutory interpretation that exclusions from income must benarrowly construed."United States v. Burke, 504 U. S., at248 (Souter, J., concurring in judgment); see United Statesv.Centennial Savings Bank FSB, 499 U. S. 573, 583-584(1991); Commissioner v. Jacobson, 336 U. S. 28, 49 (1949);United States v. Burke, 504 U. S., at 244 (Scalia, J., concur-ring in judgment).Respondent recognizes $ 61(a)'s "sweeping" definition andconcedes that his settlement constitutes gross income unlessit is expressly excepted by another provision in the TaxCode. Respondent claims, however, that his settlementproceeds are excluded from $ 61(a)'s reach by 26 U. S. C.$ 104(a).3 Section 104(a) provides an exclusion for five cate3 At the time of respondent's return, $ 104(a) provided in relevant part:"Compensation for injuries or sickness"(a) In general.--Except in the case of amounts attributable to (and notin excess of) deductions allowed under section 213 (relating to medical,etc., expenses) for any prior taxable year, gross income does not include--"(1) amounts received under workmen's compensation acts as compensation for personal injuries or sickness;"(2) the amount of any damages received (whether by suit or agreementand whether as lump sums or as periodic payments) on account of personalinjuries or sickness;"(3) amounts received through accident or health insurance for personalinjuries or sickness (other than amounts received by an employee, to theextent such amounts (A) are attributable to contributions by the employerwhich were not includible in the gross income of the employee, or (B) arepaid by the employer);"(4) amounts received as a pension, annuity, or similar allowance forpersonal injuries or sickness resulting from active service in the armedforces of any country or in the Coast and Geodetic Survey or the PublicHealth Service, or as a disability annuity payable under the provisions ofsection 808 of the Foreign Service Act of 1980; and"(5) amounts received by an individual as disability income attributableto injuries incurred as a direct result of a violent attack which the Secre515us1$75I 08-13-98 12:36:58 PAGES OPINPGT329Cite as: 515 U. S. 323 (1995)Opinion of the Courtgories of "compensation for personal injuries or sickness."Respondent argues that his settlement award falls withinthe second of those categories, which excludes from grossincome "the amount of any damages received . . . on accountof personal injuries or sickness." $ 104(a)(2).In our view, the plain language of the statute underminesrespondent's contention. Consideration of a typical recovery in a personal injury case illustrates the usual meaning of"on account of personal injuries." Assume that a taxpayeris in an automobile accident, is injured, and as a result ofthat injury suffers (a) medical expenses, (b) lost wages, and(c) pain, suffering, and emotional distress that cannot bemeasured with precision. If the taxpayer settles a resultinglawsuit for $30,000 (and if the taxpayer has not previouslydeducted her medical expenses, see $ 104(a)), the entire$30,000 would be excludable under $ 104(a)(2). The medicalexpenses for injuries arising out of the accident clearly constitute damages received "on account of personal injuries."Similarly, the portion of the settlement intended to compensate for pain and suffering constitutes damages "on accountof personal injury." 4 Finally, the recovery for lost wages isalso excludable as being "on account of personal injuries," aslong as the lost wages resulted from time in which the taxpayer was out of work as a result of her injuries. See, e. g.,tary of State determines to be a terrorist attack and which occurred whilesuch individual was an employee of the United States engaged in the performance of his official duties outside the United States." 26 U. S. C. $ 104(1988 ed. and Supp. V).In 1989, $ 104(a) was amended, adding, inter alia, the following provision: "Paragraph (2) shall not apply to any punitive damages in connectionwith a case not involving physical injury or physical sickness." Ibid.4 Though the text of $ 104(a)(2) might be considered ambiguous on thispoint, it is by now clear that $ 104(a)(2) encompasses recoveries based onintangible as well as tangible harms. See United States v. Burke, 504U. S. 229, 235, n. 6 (1992); id., at 244, and n. 3 (Scalia, J., concurring injudgment) (acknowledging that " `personal injuries or sickness' " includesnonphysical injuries).515us1$75I 08-13-98 12:36:58 PAGES OPINPGT330 COMMISSIONER v. SCHLEIEROpinion of the CourtThrelkeld v. Commissioner, 87 T. C. 1294, 1300 (1986) (hypothetical surgeon who loses finger through tortious conductmay exclude any recovery for lost wages because "[t]his injury . . . will also undoubtedly cause special damages including loss of future income"), aff 'd, 848 F. 2d 81 (CA6 1988).The critical point this hypothetical illustrates is that eachelement of the settlement is recoverable not simply becausethe taxpayer received a tort settlement, but rather becauseeach element of the settlement satisfies the requirement setforth in $ 104(a)(2) (and in all of the other subsections of$ 104(a)) that the damages were received "on account ofpersonal injuries or sickness."In contrast, no part of respondent's ADEA settlement isexcludable under the plain language of $ 104(a)(2). Respondent's recovery of back wages, though at first glancecomparable to our hypothetical accident victim's recovery oflost wages, does not fall within $ 104(a)(2)'s exclusion becauseit does not satisfy the critical requirement of being "on account of personal injury or sickness." Whether one treatsrespondent's attaining the age of 60 or his being laid off onaccount of his age as the proximate cause of respondent's lossof income, neither the birthday nor the discharge can fairlybe described as a "personal injury" or "sickness." Moreover, though respondent's unlawful termination may havecaused some psychological or "personal" injury comparableto the intangible pain and suffering caused by an automobileaccident, it is clear that no part of respondent's recovery ofback wages is attributable to that injury. Thus, in our automobile hypothetical, the accident causes a personal injurywhich in turn causes a loss of wages. In age discrimination,the discrimination causes both personal injury and loss ofwages, but neither is linked to the other. The amount ofback wages recovered is completely independent of the existence or extent of any personal injury. In short, $ 104(a)(2)does not permit the exclusion of respondent's back wages515us1$75I 08-13-98 12:36:58 PAGES OPINPGT331Cite as: 515 U. S. 323 (1995)Opinion of the Courtbecause the recovery of back wages was not "on account of "any personal injury and because no personal injury affectedthe amount of back wages recovered.Respondent suggests, nonetheless, that the liquidateddamages portion of his settlement fits comfortably within theplain language of $ 104(a)(2)'s exclusion. He cites our observation in Overnight Motor Transp. Co. v. Missel, 316 U. S.572 (1942), that liquidated damages under the FLSA "arecompensation, not a penalty or punishment," and that suchdamages might compensate for "damages too obscure anddifficult of proof for estimate." Id., at 584-585; see alsoBrooklyn Savings Bank v. O'Neil, 324 U. S. 697, 707 (1945).He argues that Congress must be presumed to have knownof our interpretation of liquidated damages when it incorporated FLSA's liquidated damages provision into the ADEA,and that Congress must therefore have intended that liquidated damages under the ADEA serve, at least in part, tocompensate plaintiffs for personal injuries that are difficultto quantify.We agree with respondent that if Congress had intendedthe ADEA's liquidated damages to compensate plaintiffs forpersonal injuries, those damages might well come within$ 104(a)(2)'s exclusion. There are, however, two weaknessesin respondent's argument. First, even if we assume thatCongress was aware of the Court's observation in OvernightMotor that the liquidated damages authorized by the FLSAmight provide compensation for some "obscure" injuries, itdoes not necessarily follow that Congress would have understood that observation as referring to injuries that were personal rather than economic. Second, and more importantly,we have previously rejected respondent's argument: Wehave already concluded that the liquidated damages provisions of the ADEA were a significant departure from thosein the FLSA, see Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U. S., at 581; TransWorld Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston, 469 U. S., at 126, and we515us1$75I 08-13-98 12:36:58 PAGES OPINPGT332 COMMISSIONER v. SCHLEIEROpinion of the Courtexplicitly held in Thurston: "Congress intended for liqui-dated damages to be punitive in nature." Id., at 125.5Our holding in Thurston disposes of respondent's argu-ment and requires the conclusion that liquidated damagesunder the ADEA, like back wages under the ADEA, are notreceived "on account of personal injury or sickness."65 We find it noteworthy that the Court in Thurston was presented withmany of the arguments offered by respondent today. For example, tocounter the argument that "the ADEA liquidated damages provision ispunitive," the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) argued that "the legislative history of the liquidated damages provision inthe ADEA--as in the FLSA--shows that such damages are designed toprovide full compensation to the employee, rather than primarily to punishthe employer." Brief for EEOC in Transworld Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston,O. T. 1984, Nos. 83-997 and 83-1325, p. 36. The EEOC continued: "Thus,Congress focused on the need to be fair to the employee, and to providehim full compensation for nonpecuniary damages not readily calculable,including emotional injuries such as humiliation and loss of self respect."Id., at 36-37. See also id., at 37 (relying on Overnight Motor Transp.Co. v. Missel, 316 U. S. 572 (1942)). Against this background, the Court'sstatement that "Congress intended for liquidated damages to be punitivein nature" can only be taken as a rejection of the argument that thosedamages are also (or are exclusively) compensatory.We recognize that the House Conference Report accompanying the 1978Amendments to the ADEA contains language that supports respondent.See H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 95-950 (1978). However, this evidence was before the Court in Thurston, see Brief for EEOC, at 37, and the Court didnot find it persuasive. We see no reason to reach a different result now.Moreover, there is much force to the Court's conclusion in Thurstonthat the ADEA's liquidated damages provisions are punitive. Under ourdecision in Thurston, liquidated damages are only available under theADEA if "the employer . . . knew or showed reckless disregard for thematter of whether its conduct was prohibited by the ADEA." 469 U. S.,at 126 (internal quotation marks omitted). If liquidated damages weredesigned to compensate ADEA victims, we see no reason why the employer's knowledge of the unlawfulness of his conduct should be the determinative factor in the award of liquidated damages.6 We find odd the dissent's suggestion, post, at 341-342, that our holdingtoday assumes that the intangible harms of discrimination do not constitutepersonal injuries. We of course have no doubt that the intangible harms ofdiscrimination can constitute personal injury, and that compensation for515us1$75I 08-13-98 12:36:58 PAGES OPINPGT333Cite as: 515 U. S. 323 (1995)Opinion of the CourtIIIRespondent seeks to circumvent the plain language of$ 104(a)(2) by relying on the Commissioner's regulation interpreting that section. Section 1.104-1(c) of the TreasuryRegulations, 26 CFR $ 1.104-1(c) (1994), provides:"Section 104(a)(2) [of the Internal Revenue Code] ex-cludes from gross income the amount of any damagesreceived (whether by suit or agreement) on account ofpersonal injuries or sickness. The term `damages received (whether by suit or agreement)' means an amountreceived (other than workmen's compensation) throughprosecution of a legal suit or action based upon tort ortort type rights, or through a settlement agreemententered into in lieu of such prosecution."Respondent contends that an action to recover damages fora violation of the ADEA is "based upon tort or tort typerights" as those terms are used in that regulation, and thathis settlement is thus excludable under the plain language ofthe regulation.Even if we accept respondent's characterization of theaction, but see infra, at 336, there is no basis for excluding theproceeds of his settlement from his gross income. The regulatory requirement that the amount be received in a tort typeaction is not a substitute for the statutory requirement thatthe amount be received "on account of personal injuries orsickness"; it is an additional requirement. Indeed, the statutory requirement is repeated in the regulation. As the Com-missioner argues in her reply brief, an exclusion from grossincome is authorized by the regulation "only when it both (i)was received through prosecution or settlement of an `actionbased upon tort or tort type rights'. . . and (ii) was receivedsuch harms may be excludable under $ 104(a)(2). However, to acknowledgethat discrimination may cause intangible harms is not to say that the ADEAcompensates for such harms, or that any of the damages received were onaccount of those harms.515us1$75I 08-13-98 12:36:58 PAGES OPINPGT334 COMMISSIONER v. SCHLEIEROpinion of the Court`on account of personal injuries or sickness.' " Reply Brieffor Petitioner 2.7 We need not decide whether the Commissioner would have authority to dispense entirely withthe statutory requirement, because she disclaims any intent to do so, and the text of the regulation does not belieher disclaimer. Thus, respondent's reliance on the text ofthe regulation is unpersuasive.IVRespondent also suggests that our decision in UnitedStates v. Burke, 504 U. S. 229 (1992), compels the conclusionthat his settlement award is excludable. In Burke, we re-jected the taxpayer's argument that the payment receivedin settlement of her backpay claim under the pre-1991 ver-sion of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was excludable from her gross income. Our decision rested on the con-clusion that such a claim was not based upon "tort or torttype rights" within the meaning of the regulation quotedabove. For two independent reasons, we think Burke pro-vides no foundation for respondent's argument.First, respondent's ADEA recovery is not based upon"tort or tort type rights" as that term was construed inBurke. In Burke, we examined the remedial scheme estab-lished by the pre-1991 version of Title VII. Noting that"Title VII does not allow awards for compensatory or puni-tive damages," and that "instead, it limits available remediesto backpay, injunctions, and other equitable relief," we con7 We recognize that the Commissioner has arguably in the past treatedthe regulation as though its second sentence superseded the first sentence.See, e. g., United States v. Burke, 504 U. S., at 242, n. 1 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment). In this case, however, the Commissioner unambiguously contends that the regulation is not intended to eliminate the "onaccount of" requirement from the statutory language. In view of theCommissioner's differing interpretations of her own regulation, we do notaccord her present litigating position any special deference. We do agree,however, that she reads the regulation correctly in this case.515us1$75I 08-13-98 12:36:58 PAGES OPINPGT335Cite as: 515 U. S. 323 (1995)Opinion of the Courtcluded that Title VII was not tortlike because it addressed" `legal injuries of an economic character.' " 504 U. S., at238, 239.Respondent points to two elements of the ADEA that heargues distinguish it from the remedial scheme at issue inBurke: First, the ADEA provides for jury trial, see 29U. S. C. $ 626(b);Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U. S., at 585; but cf.Lehman v. Nakshian, 453 U. S. 156 (1981); and second, theADEA allows for liquidated damages. We do not believethat these features of the ADEA are sufficient to bring itwithinBurke's conception of a "tort type righ[t]." It is true,as respondent notes, that we emphasized in Burke the lackof a right to a jury trial and the absence of any provision forpunitive damages as factors distinguishing the pre-1991 TitleVII action from traditional tort litigation, 504 U. S., at 238-240. We did not, however, indicate that the presence ofeither or both of those factors would be sufficient to bring astatutory claim within the coverage of the regulation.In our view, respondent's argument gives insufficient attention to what the Burke Court recognized as the primarycharacteristic of an "action based upon . . . tort type rights":the availability of compensatory remedies. Indeed, wenoted that "one of the hallmarks of traditional tort liabilityis the availability of a broad range of damages to compensatethe plaintiff `fairly for injuries caused by the violation of hislegal rights.' " Id., at 235. We continued: "Although thesedamages often are described in compensatory terms . . . , inmany cases they are larger than the amount necessary toreimburse actual monetary loss sustained or even anticipatedby the plaintiff, and thus redress intangible elements of injury that are deemed important, even though not pecuniaryin [their] immediate consequence[s]." Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). Against this background, we foundcritical that the pre-1991 version of Title VII provided nocompensation "for any of the other traditional harms associated with personal injury, such as pain and suffering, emo515us1$75I 08-13-98 12:36:58 PAGES OPINPGT336 COMMISSIONER v. SCHLEIEROpinion of the Courttional distress, harm to reputation, or other consequentialdamages."Id., at 239.Like the pre-1991 version of Title VII, the ADEA providesno compensation "for any of the other traditional harms associated with personal injury." Monetary remedies under theADEA are limited to back wages, which are clearly of an"economic character," and liquidated damages, which wehave already noted serve no compensatory function. Thus,though this is a closer case thanBurke, we conclude that arecovery under the ADEA is not one that is "based upontort or tort type rights."Second, and more importantly, the holding of Burke is nar-rower than respondent suggests. InBurke, following theframework established in the Internal Revenue Service regulations, we noted that $ 104(a)(2) requires a determinationwhether the underlying action is "based upon tort or torttype rights." Id., at 234. In so doing, however, we did nothold that the inquiry into "tort or tort type rights" constituted the beginning and end of the analysis. In particular,though Burke relied on Title VII's failure to qualify as anaction based upon tort type rights, we did not intend to eliminate the basic requirement found in both the statute andthe regulation that only amounts received "on account ofpersonal injuries or sickness" come within $ 104(a)(2)'s exclusion. Thus, though satisfaction of Burke's "tort or torttype" inquiry is a necessary condition for excludabilityunder $ 104(a)(2), it is not a sufficient condition.8In sum, the plain language of $ 104(a)(2), the text of theapplicable regulation, and our decision in Burke establish8 We recognize that a recent Revenue Ruling from the IRS seems torely on the same reading of Burke urged by respondent. See Rev. Rul.93-88, 1993-2 Cum. Bull. 61. Though this Revenue Ruling is not beforeus, we note that "the Service's interpretive rulings do not have the forceand effect of regulations," Davis v. United States, 495 U. S. 472, 484 (1990),and they may not be used to overturn the plain language of a statute.See, e. g., Bartels v. Birmingham, 332 U. S. 126, 132 (1947).515us1$75I 08-13-98 12:36:58 PAGES OPINPGT337Cite as: 515 U. S. 323 (1995)O'Connor, J., dissentingtwo independent requirements that a taxpayer must meetbefore a recovery may be excluded under $ 104(a)(2). First,the taxpayer must demonstrate that the underlying cause ofaction giving rise to the recovery is "based upon tort or torttype rights"; and second, the taxpayer must show that thedamages were received "on account of personal injuries orsickness." For the reasons discussed above, we believe thatrespondent has failed to satisfy either requirement, and thusno part of his settlement is excludable under $ 104(a)(2).The judgment is reversed.
