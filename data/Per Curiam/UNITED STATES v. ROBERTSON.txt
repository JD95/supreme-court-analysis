Respondent, Juan Paul Robertson, was charged withvarious narcotics offenses, and with violating $ 1962(a) ofthe Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act(RICO), 18 U. S. C. $ 1961et seq. (1988 ed. and Supp. V), byinvesting the proceeds of those unlawful activities in the "acquisition of any interest in, or the establishment or operationof, any enterprise which is engaged in, or the activities ofwhich affect, interstate or foreign commerce." $ 1962(a).He was convicted on some of the narcotics counts, and on theRICO count by reason of his investment in a certain goldmine. The United States Court of Appeals for the NinthCircuit reversed the RICO conviction on the ground that theGovernment had failed to introduce sufficient evidence proving that the gold mine was "engaged in or affect[ed] inter-state commerce." 15 F. 3d 862, 868 (1994). We granted theUnited States' petition for certiorari. 513 U. S. 945 (1994).The facts relevant to the "engaged in or affecting interstate commerce" issue were as follows: Some time in 1985,Robertson entered into a partnership agreement with another man, whereby he agreed to finance a gold mining oper-ation in Alaska. In fulfillment of this obligation, Robertson,who resided in Arizona, made a cash payment of $125,000 forplacer gold mining claims near Fairbanks. He paid approxi-mately $100,000 (in cash) for mining equipment and supplies,some of which were purchased in Los Angeles and trans-ported to Alaska for use in the mine. Robertson also hiredand paid the expenses for seven out-of-state employees totravel to Alaska to work in the mine. The partnership dissolved during the first mining season, but Robertson contin-ued to operate the mine through 1987 as a sole proprietorship. He again hired a number of employees from outsideAlaska to work in the mine. During its operating life, themine produced between $200,000 and $290,000 worth of gold,most of which was sold to refiners within Alaska, although514us3$54K 05-27-98 17:21:30 PAGES OPINPGT671Cite as: 514 U. S. 669 (1995)Per CuriamRobertson personally transported approximately $30,000worth of gold out of the State.Most of the parties' arguments, here and in the Ninth Circuit, were addressed to the question whether the activitiesof the gold mine "affected" interstate commerce. We haveconcluded we do not have to consider that point. The "affecting commerce" test was developed in our jurisprudenceto define the extent of Congress' power over purely intrastate commercial activities that nonetheless have substantialinterstate effects. See, e. g., Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S.111 (1942). The proof at Robertson's trial, however, focusedlargely on the interstate activities of Robertson's mine. Forexample, the Government proved that Robertson purchasedat least $100,000 worth of equipment and supplies for use inthe mine. Contrary to the Court of Appeals' suggestion, allof those items were not purchased locally ("drawn generallyfrom the stream of interstate commerce," 15 F. 3d, at 869(internal quotation marks omitted)); the Government provedthat some of them were purchased in California and transported to Alaska for use in the mine's operations. Cf.United States v. American Building Maintenance Industries, 422 U. S. 271, 285 (1975) (allegation that company hadmade local purchases of equipment and supplies that weremerely manufactured out of state was insufficient to showthat company was "engaged in commerce" within the meaning of $ 7 of the Clayton Act). The Government also provedthat, on more than one occasion, Robertson sought workersfrom out of state and brought them to Alaska to work in themine. Cf. id., at 274. Furthermore, Robertson, the mine'ssole proprietor, took $30,000 worth of gold, or 15% of themine's total output, with him out of the State.Whether or not these activities met (and whether or not,to bring the gold mine within the "affecting commerce" provision of RICO, they would have to meet) the requirement ofsubstantially affecting interstate commerce, they assuredly514us3$54K 05-27-98 17:21:31 PAGES OPINPGT672 UNITED STATES v. ROBERTSONPer Curiambrought the gold mine within $ 1962(a)'s alternative criterionof "any enterprise . . . engaged in . . . interstate or foreigncommerce." As we said in American Building Mainte-nance, a corporation is generally "engaged `in commerce' "when it is itself "directly engaged in the production, distri-bution, or acquisition of goods or services in interstatecommerce." Id., at 283. See also Gulf Oil Corp. v. CoppPaving Co., 419 U. S. 186, 195 (1974).The judgment of the Court of Appeals is
