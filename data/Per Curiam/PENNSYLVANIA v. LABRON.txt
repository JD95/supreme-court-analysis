In these two cases, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvaniaheld that the Fourth Amendment, as applied to the Statesthrough the Fourteenth, requires police to obtain a warrant*Together with No. 95-1738, Pennsylvania v. Kilgore, also on petitionfor writ of certiorari to the same court.518US3$91l 05-29-99 19:17:22 PAGES OPINPGT939Cite as: 518 U.

Because the holdings rest on an incorrect reading of the automobile exception to the Fourth Amendment'swarrant requirement, we grant the petitions for certiorariand reverse.In Labron, No. 95-1691, police observed respondent La-bron and others engaging in a series of drug transactions ona street in Philadelphia. The police arrested the suspects,searched the trunk of a car from which the drugs had beenproduced, and found bags containing cocaine. The Pennsyl-vania Supreme Court agreed with the trial court (but notwith the intermediate court of appeals, 428 Pa. Super. 616,626 A. 2d 646 (1993), whose judgment it reversed) that thisevidence should be suppressed. 543 Pa. 86, 669 A. 2d 917(1995). After surveying our precedents on the automobileexception as well as some of its own decisions, the court "conclude[d] that this Commonwealth's jurisprudence of the auto-mobile exception has long required both the existence ofprobable cause and the presence of exigent circumstances tojustify a warrantless search."Id., at 100, 669 A. 2d, at 924.Satisfied the police had time to secure a warrant, id., at 100-103, 699 A. 2d, at 924-925, the court held that "the warrantless search of this stationary vehicle violated constitutionalguarantees," id., at 101, 669 A. 2d, at 924.In Kilgore, No. 95-1738, an undercover informant agreedto buy drugs from respondent Randy Lee Kilgore's accomplice, Kelly Jo Kilgore. To obtain the drugs, Kelly Jo drovefrom the parking lot where the deal was made to a farmhouse where she met with Randy Kilgore and obtained thedrugs. After the drugs were delivered and the Kilgoreswere arrested, police searched the farmhouse with the consent of its owner and also searched Randy Kilgore's pickuptruck; they had seen the Kilgores walking to and from thetruck, which was parked in the driveway of the farmhouse.The search turned up cocaine on the truck's floor. The trialcourt denied Randy Kilgore's motion to suppress the cocaine,holding the officers had probable cause to make the search.518US3$91l 05-29-99 19:17:22 PAGES OPINPGT940 PENNSYLVANIA v. LABRONPer CuriamThe appellate court affirmed. 437 Pa. Super. 491, 650 A. 2d462 (1994). The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania reversed,citing Labron and holding that although there was probablecause to search the truck, 544 Pa. 439, 444, 677 A. 2d 311,313 (1995), the search violated the Fourth Amendment because no exigent circumstances justified the failure to obtaina warrant,id., at 445, 677 A. 2d, at 313-314.The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania held the rule permit-ting warrantless searches of automobiles is limited to caseswhere " `unforeseen circumstances involving the search of anautomobile [are] coupled with the presence of probablecause.' " 543 Pa., at 100, 669 A. 2d, at 924, quoting Commonwealth v. White, 543 Pa. 45, 53, 669 A. 2d 896, 901 (1995)(emphasis deleted). This was incorrect. Our first cases establishing the automobile exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement were based on the automobile's"ready mobility," an exigency sufficient to excuse failure toobtain a search warrant once probable cause to conduct thesearch is clear. California v. Carney, 471 U. S. 386, 390-391(1985) (tracing the history of the exception); Carroll v.United States, 267 U. S. 132 (1925). More recent casesprovide a further justification: the individual's reduced expectation of privacy in an automobile, owing to its pervasiveregulation. Carney, supra, at 391-392. If a car is readilymobile and probable cause exists to believe it contains contraband, the Fourth Amendment thus permits police tosearch the vehicle without more. Carney, supra, at 393.As the state courts found, there was probable cause in bothof these cases: Police had seen respondent Labron put drugsin the trunk of the car they searched and had seen respondent Kilgore act in ways that suggested he had drugs in histruck. We conclude the searches of the automobiles in thesecases did not violate the Fourth Amendment.Respondent Labron claims we have no jurisdiction to review the judgment in his case because the PennsylvaniaSupreme Court's opinion rests on an adequate and independ518US3$91l 05-29-99 19:17:22 PAGES OPINPGT941Cite as: 518 U.

The language we have quoted is nota "plain statement" sufficient to tell us "the federal cases[were] being used only for the purpose of guidance, and d[id]not themselves compel the result that the court ha[d]reached." Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032, 1041 (1983).The Pennsylvania Supreme Court did discuss several of itsown decisions; as it noted, however, some of those cases re-lied on an analysis of our cases on the automobile exception, see, e. g., 543 Pa., at 95, 669 A. 2d, at 921 (observ-ingCommonwealth v. Holzer, 480 Pa. 93, 103, 389 A. 2d101, 106 (1978), citedCoolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U. S.443 (1971)); 543 Pa., at 100, 669 A. 2d, at 924 (stating Commonwealth v. White, supra, rested in part upon the Pennsyl-vania Supreme Court's analysis of Chambers v. Maroney, 399U. S. 42 (1970)). The law of the Commonwealth thus ap-pears to us "interwoven with the federal law, and . . . theadequacy and independence of any possible state law groundis not clear from the face of the opinion."Michigan v. Long,463 U. S., at 1040-1041. Our jurisdiction in Labron's caseis secure. Ibid. The opinion in respondent Kilgore's case,meanwhile, rests on an explicit conclusion that the officers'conduct violated the Fourth Amendment; we have jurisdic-tion to review this judgment as well.Respondent Labron's motion to proceed in forma pauperisis granted. The petitions for writs of certiorari are granted,the judgments of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania arereversed, and the cases are remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
