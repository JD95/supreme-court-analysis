On August 13, 1998, an officer of the city of Los AngelesDepartment of Transportation ordered respondent EdwinDavid's automobile towed from a spot where parking wasforbidden. After paying $134.50, David recovered his car.David, believing that the trees obstructed his view of the"no parking" sign, requested a hearing to recover the money.On September 9, 1998--27 days after the vehicle wastowed--the city held the hearing and denied David's claim.David then brought this lawsuit in Federal District Courtunder Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, arguing that thecity, in failing to provide a sufficiently prompt hearing, hadviolated his federal right to "due process of law." Amdt. 14,$ 1. The District Court granted summary judgment for thecity. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, by a voteof 2 to 1, reversed, holding that the Constitution required thecity to provide an earlier payment-recovery hearing, perhapswithin 48 hours of the towing and at least within 5 days.307 F. 3d 1143, 1147 (2002). The city, seeking certiorarihere, argues that the Ninth Circuit's holding runs contraryto well-settled principles of constitutional law. We agree.We grant the writ and summarily reverse the Ninth Circuit's judgment.In Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319, 335 (1976), theCourt set forth three factors that normally determinewhether an individual has received the "process" that theConstitution finds "due":"First, the private interest that will be affected by theofficial action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, andthe probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government's interest, including the function involved and the fiscal andadministrative burdens that the additional or substituteprocedural requirement would entail."538US2 Unit: $U55 [10-27-04 16:30:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN717Cite as: 538 U. S. 715 (2003)Per CuriamBy weighing these concerns, courts can determine whethera State has met the "fundamental requirement of due process"--"the opportunity to be heard `at a meaningful time andin a meaningful manner.' "Id., at 333.In FDIC v. Mallen, 486 U. S. 230, 242 (1988), the Courtconsidered circumstances in which "impairment of an individual's property is not preceded by any opportunity for apre-deprivation hearing." A Government agency had sus-pended an indicted bank employee from his job. A statuterequired the agency to provide a postdeprivation hearingwithin 30 days and to issue a decision within 60 days of thathearing. The bank employee claimed that the 30- or 90-daydelay between (a) the suspension and (b) the postsuspensionhearing and decision violated the Due Process Clause. TheCourt recognized that there "is a point at which an unjustified delay in completing a post-deprivation proceeding`would become a constitutional violation.' " Ibid. It applied Eldridge-type factors to determine whether that pointhad been reached. 486 U. S., at 242 (assessing the importance of, and harm to, the private interest, the likelihood ofinterim error, and the governmental interest in a delay).And it concluded that a 30-day delay of the hearing, and apotential 90-day delay of a decision, did not violate the Constitution. Id., at 243.Eldridge, as applied in Mallen, requires reversal of theNinth Circuit's decision. The first Eldridge factor, the"private interest," is a monetary interest here. It consistsof the private individual's interest in maintaining the use ofmoney between (a) the time of paying the impoundment andtowing fees and (b) the time of the hearing. The temporarydeprivation of a job, the "private interest" at issue in Mallen,typically works a far more serious harm. Cf. Eldridge,supra, at 340 (distinguishing in this respect between benefits "not based upon financial need" and welfare assistance"given to persons on the very margin of subsistence"). Sodoes a temporary deprivation of the use of the automobile538US2 Unit: $U55 [10-27-04 16:30:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN718 LOS ANGELES v. DAVIDPer Curiamitself--the relevant deprivation at issue in the lower courtcases to which the Ninth Circuit looked for support. SeeStypmann v. San Francisco, 557 F. 2d 1338, 1342-1344 (CA91977). Cf.Goichman v. Rheuban Motors, Inc., 682 F. 2d1320, 1324 (CA9 1982). Indeed, the city indicates that anyloss in the time value of the money can be compensated byan interest payment. Pet. for Cert. 7.The second Eldridge factor--concern for accuracy--doesnot support the Ninth Circuit's conclusion. A 30-day delayin presenting evidence is unlikely to spawn significant factualerrors. Administrative and judicial proceedings normallytake place after considerably more time has elapsed. Andthe straightforward nature of the issue--whether the carwas illegally parked--indicates that initial towing errors,while they may occur, are unlikely. Cf. Mallen, supra, at244-245 (finding "little likelihood that the deprivation iswithout basis" in light of the grand jury indictment).The third Eldridge factor--the "Government's interest"--argues strongly in the city's favor. The nature of the city'sinterest in delay is one of administrative necessity. The citypoints out that it "conducts more than a thousand vehicleimpound hearings annually." Pet. for Cert. 8. It holdsabout five percent of these hearings--those involving individuals who are unable to afford the impoundment fees--within 48 hours. Ibid. It "takes time to organize hearings:there are only so many courtrooms and presiding officials;the city has to contact the towing officer and arrange for hisappearance; the city may have to find a substitute to coverthat officer's responsibilities while he attends the hearing."307 F. 3d, at 1149 (Kozinski, J., dissenting). And the NinthCircuit's holding, which presumably would require the cityto schedule annually 1,000 or more hearings, instead of 50hearings, within a 48-hour (or 5-day) time limit, will proveburdensome. The administrative resources available tomodern police departments are not limitless. The administrative necessity supporting the delay here is no less sub538US2 Unit: $U55 [10-27-04 16:30:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN719Cite as: 538 U. S. 715 (2003)Per Curiamstantial than the governmental interest in the 30-day hear-ing delay in Mallen, namely, the need to protect the integrityof the banking system and to prepare thoroughly for thehearing. Mallen, supra, at 244. We also add that the reason for denying a predeprivation hearing here--such a hear-ing is impossible if the city is to be able to enforce the parking rules--is not any less important than in Mallen.We conclude that the 27-day delay in holding a hearinghere reflects no more than a routine delay substantially re-quired by administrative needs. Our cases make clear thatthe Due Process Clause does not prohibit an agency fromimposing this kind of procedural delay when holding hearings to consider claims of the kind here at issue. The NinthCircuit's judgment to the contrary is reversed.
