A federal grand jury sitting in the Eastern District ofMichigan returned a second superseding indictment chargingrespondent with, inter alia, the intentional firearm killingsof two individuals. The United States filed a notice of intentto seek the death penalty. Respondent, who is black, al-leged that the Government had determined to seek the deathpenalty against him because of his race. He moved to dis536US2 Unit: $U85 [12-17-03 19:36:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN863Cite as: 536 U. S. 862 (2002)Per Curiammiss the death penalty notice and, in the alternative, for dis-covery of information relating to the Government's capitalcharging practices. The District Court granted the motionfor discovery, and after the Government informed the courtthat it would not comply with the discovery order, the courtdismissed the death penalty notice. A divided panel of theUnited States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit af-firmed the District Court's discovery order. 266 F. 3d 532(2001). We grant the petition for a writ of certiorari andnow summarily reverse.In United States v. Armstrong, 517 U. S. 456, 465 (1996),we held that a defendant who seeks discovery on a claimof selective prosecution must show some evidence of bothdiscriminatory effect and discriminatory intent. We needgo no further in the present case than consideration of theevidence supporting discriminatory effect. As to that,Armstrong says that the defendant must make a "credibleshowing" that "similarly situated individuals of a differentrace were not prosecuted." Id., at 465, 470. The Sixth Cir-cuit concluded that respondent had made such a showingbased on nationwide statistics demonstrating that "[t]heUnited States charges blacks with a death-eligible offensemore than twice as often as it charges whites" and that theUnited States enters into plea bargains more frequently withwhites than it does with blacks. 266 F. 3d, at 538-539 (citingU. S. Dept. of Justice, The Federal Death Penalty System: AStatistical Survey (1988-2000), p. 2 (Sept. 12, 2000)).* Evenassuming that the Armstrong requirement can be satisfied*In January 1995, the Department of Justice (DOJ) instituted a policy,known as the death penalty protocol, that required the Attorney Generalto make the decision whether to seek the death penalty once a defendanthad been charged with a capital-eligible offense. See Pet. for Cert. 3 (citing DOJ, United States Attorneys' Manual $ 9-10.010 et seq. (Sept. 1997)).The charging decision continued to be made by one of the 93 United StatesAttorneys throughout the country, but the protocol required that theUnited States Attorneys submit for review all cases in which they hadcharged a defendant with a capital-eligible offense.

BASSPer Curiamby a nationwide showing (as opposed to a showing regard-ing the record of the decisionmakers in respondent's case),raw statistics regarding overall charges say nothing aboutcharges brought against similarly si tuated defendants.And the statistics regarding plea bargains are even less rele-vant, since respondent was offered a plea bargain but declined it. See Pet. for Cert. 16. Under Armstrong, there-fore, because respondent failed to submit relevant evidencethat similarly situated persons were treated differently, hewas not entitled to discovery.The Sixth Circuit's decision is contrary to Armstrong andthreatens the "performance of a core executive constitutionalfunction."
