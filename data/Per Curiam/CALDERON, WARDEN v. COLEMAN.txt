After a jury trial in a state court in California, respondentRussell Coleman was convicted of the September 5, 1979,525US1 Unit: $U10 [10-23-00 11:52:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN142 CALDERON v. COLEMANPer Curiamrape, sodomy, and murder of Shirley Hill. The jury's twospecial circumstances findings of rape and sodomy madeColeman death-penalty eligible under California law. SeePeople v. Coleman, 46 Cal. 3d 749, 756-757, 759 P. 2d 1260,1264 (1988).At the penalty phase of Coleman's trial, the trial judgegave the jury a so-called Briggs instruction, then requiredby California law, which informed the jury of the Governor'spower to commute a sentence of life without possibility ofparole to some lesser sentence that might include the possi-bility of parole. After giving the standard Briggs instruction, the state trial court instructed the jury that it was notto consider the Governor's commutation power in reachingits verdict. Thus, the full jury instruction on commutationwas as follows:"You are instructed that under the State Constitution, aGovernor is empowered to grant a reprieve, pardon orcommutation of a sentence following conviction of thecrime."Under this power, a Governor may in the future commute or modify a sentence of life imprisonment withoutthe possibility of parole to a lesser sentence that wouldinclude the possibility of parole."So that you will have no misunderstandings relatingto a sentence of life without possibility of parole, youhave been informed generally as to the Governor's commutation modification power. You are now instructed,however, that the matter of a Governor's commutationpower is not to be considered by you in determining thepunishment for this defendant."You may not speculate as to if or when a Governorwould commute the sentence to a lesser one which includes the possibility of parole."I instruct you again that you are to consider only thoseaggravating and mitigating factors which I have already525US1 Unit: $U10 [10-23-00 11:52:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN143Cite as: 525 U.

Respondent's Oppositionto Motion to Amend Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpusin No. C89-1906 (ND Cal.), p. 7, Record, Doc. No. 267,quoting Tr. 1059-1060.In an unrelated case, we had upheld the Briggs instruc-tion against a federal constitutional challenge.Californiav. Ramos, 463 U. S. 992 (1983). On direct appeal, however,Coleman argued that giving the Briggs instruction in hiscase was reversible error under the California SupremeCourt's decision in California v. Ramos, 37 Cal. 3d 136, 689P. 2d 430 (1984). There the California Supreme Court held,on remand from this Court, that the Briggs instruction vio-lates the California Constitution because, in the CaliforniaSupreme Court's view, it is misleading, invites the jury toconsider irrelevant and speculative matters, and diverts thejury from its proper function.The California Supreme Court rejected Coleman's argument and upheld his death sentence. People v. Coleman,supra. While the court found that the giving of the Briggsinstruction was error under California law, it held the errorwas not prejudicial because the additional instruction toldthe jury it should not consider the possibility of commutationin determining Coleman's sentence.Id., at 780-781, 759P. 2d, at 1281-1282.Coleman then sought a federal writ of habeas corpus.Although the District Court acknowledged this Court's holding that giving the Briggs instruction does not violate theFederal Constitution and does not mislead or inappropriately divert the jury, the court nonetheless granted the writas to Coleman's death sentence. No. C89-1906 (ND Cal.,Mar. 28, 1997), App. to Pet. for Cert. A-146, A-151. Rely-ing on recent Ninth Circuit precedent, the District Courtfound the Briggs instruction was inaccurate as applied toColeman because it did not mention a limitation on the Governor's power to commute Coleman's sentence. Id., at A-525US1 Unit: $U10 [10-23-00 11:52:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN144 CALDERON v. COLEMANPer Curiam147. Under the California Constitution, the Governor maynot commute the sentence of a prisoner who, like Coleman,is a twice-convicted felon without the approval of four judgesof the California Supreme Court. Art. 5, $ 8.The District Court found that, because the Briggs instruction did not mention this limitation on the Governor'scommutation power, it violated the Eighth and FourteenthAmendments by "g[iving] the jury inaccurate informationand potentially divert[ing] its attention from the mitigationevidence presented." No. C89-1906, supra, at A-151. Thecourt also found that, in the context of the case--particularly,the prosecutor's arguments of future dangerousness, "thecommutation instruction would likely have prevented thejury from giving due effect to Coleman's mitigating evidence." Id., at A-149. The court did not in express termsconsider the effect of the additional instruction, which instructed the jury not to consider commutation, but it notedthat the Ninth Circuit had held in a similar case, Hamiltonv. Vasquez, 17 F. 3d 1149 (1994), "that the trial court didnot cure the error by instructing the jury not to considercommutation." No. C89-1906, supra, at A-148.The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed theDistrict Court's grant of the writ as to Coleman's sentence.150 F. 3d 1105 (1998). The Court of Appeals agreed withthe District Court's finding that the instruction, as applied to Coleman, gave the jury inaccurate information aboutthe Governor's commutation power. Id., at 1118. And, ina sweeping pronouncement, the court declared, "[a] commutation instruction is unconstitutional when it is inaccurate."Ibid. The instruction at issue was fatally flawed, the courtheld, because it "dramatically overstate[d] the possibility ofcommuting the life sentence of a person such as Coleman"(by creating "the false impression that the Governor, acting alone," could commute the sentence) and thus preventedthe jurors from "understand[ing] the choice they [we]reasked to make" and " `invited [them] to speculate' that Cole525US1 Unit: $U10 [10-23-00 11:52:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN145Cite as: 525 U. S. 141 (1998)Per Curiamman could be effectively isolated from the community onlythrough a sentence of death."Id., at 1119.Having concluded that the giving of the instruction wasconstitutional error, the Court of Appeals then took up theState's argument that, even if the instruction was unconstitutional, it "did not have a `substantial and injurious effector influence' on the jury's sentence of death,"ibid., as required by Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U. S. 619, 637 (1993).The court explained:"To decide this question, we look to Boyde v. California,494 U. S. 370 (1990). When the inaccuracy underminesthe jury's understanding of sentencing options, `there isa reasonable likelihood that the jury has applied thechallenged instruction in a way that prevents the consid-eration of constitutionally relevant evidence.'Boyde,494 U. S. at 380."We conclude the district court did not err in holdingthat Coleman was denied due process by the state trialcourt's inaccurate commutation instruction." 150 F. 3d,at 1119 (citations omitted).Though the Court of Appeals' constitutional analysis ofthe jury instruction, and the Circuit precedent on which itrelied, have not been approved by this Court, we do not consider the validity of that analysis here because the Statehas not asked us to do so. We will simply assume at thisstage that the instruction did not meet constitutional standards. The State does contend, however, that the Court ofAppeals erred by failing to apply the harmless-error analysisof Brecht. We agree.We held in Brecht that a federal court may grant habeasrelief based on trial error only when that error " `had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining thejury's verdict.' " 507 U. S., at 637 (quoting Kotteakos v.United States, 328 U. S. 750, 776 (1946)). This standard reflects the "presumption of finality and legality" that attaches525US1 Unit: $U10 [10-23-00 11:52:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN146 CALDERON v. COLEMANPer Curiamto a conviction at the conclusion of direct review. 507 U. S.,at 633. It protects the State's sovereign interest in punishing offenders and its "good-faith attempts to honor constitu-tional rights,"id., at 635, while ensuring that the extraordinary remedy of habeas corpus is available to those " `whomsociety has grievously wronged,' " id., at 634 (quoting Fay v.Noia, 372 U. S. 391, 440-441 (1963)).A federal court upsets this careful balance when it setsaside a state-court conviction or sentence without first determining that the error had a substantial and injurious effecton the jury's verdict. The social costs of retrial or resentencing are significant, and the attendant difficulties areacute in cases such as this one, where the original sentencinghearing took place in November 1981, some 17 years ago.No. C89-1906, App. to Pet. for Cert. A-101, n. 45. The Stateis not to be put to this arduous task based on mere speculation that the defendant was prejudiced by trial error; thecourt must find that the defendant was actually prejudicedby the error. Brecht, supra, at 637. As a consequence,once the Court of Appeals determined that the giving of theBriggs instruction was constitutional error, it was bound toapply the harmless-error analysis mandated by Brecht.The Boyde test that the Court of Appeals applied insteadis not a harmless-error test at all. It is, rather, the testfor determining, in the first instance, whether constitutional error occurred when the jury was given an ambiguousinstruction that it might have interpreted to prevent consideration of constitutionally relevant evidence. Boyde v. California, 494 U. S. 370, 377, 380 (1990). In such cases, constitutional error exists only if "there is a reasonable likelihood"that the jury so interpreted the instruction.Although the Boyde test for constitutional error, likethe Brecht harmless-error test, furthers the "strong policyagainst retrials years after the first trial where the claimederror amounts to no more than speculation," 494 U. S., at380, it is not a substitute for the Brecht harmless-error test.525US1 Unit: $U10 [10-23-00 11:52:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN147Cite as: 525 U. S. 141 (1998)Stevens, J., dissentingThe Boyde analysis does not inquire into the actual effectof the error on the jury's verdict; it merely asks whetherconstitutional error has occurred. If the Court of Appealshad viewed the jury instruction as ambiguous on the issuewhether the Governor had the power alone to commute defendant's sentence, it might have inquired--as in Boyde--whether there was a reasonable likelihood that the jury understood the instruction as stating the Governor had thatpower. If the court found that possibility to be a reasonable one, it would determine then whether the instruction,so understood, was unconstitutional as applied to the defendant. Even if the court found a constitutional violation,however, it could not grant the writ without further inquiry.As the Court has recognized on numerous occasions, someconstitutional errors do not entitle the defendant to relief,particularly habeas relief. See, e. g., Brecht, supra, at 637-638; O'Neal v. McAninch, 513 U. S. 432, 435-436 (1995)(applying harmless-error review to an instruction that "violated the Federal Constitution by misleading the jury").The court must find that the error, in the whole context ofthe particular case, had a substantial and injurious effect orinfluence on the jury's verdict.The motion of respondent for leave to proceed in formapauperis and the petition for a writ of certiorari are granted,the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuitis reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedingsconsistent with this opinion.
