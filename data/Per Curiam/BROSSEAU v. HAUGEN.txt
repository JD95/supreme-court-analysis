Officer Rochelle Brosseau, a member of the Puyallup,Washington, Police Department, shot Kenneth Haugen in theback as he attempted to flee from law enforcement authori-ties in his vehicle. Haugen subsequently filed this action inthe United States District Court for the Western District of543US1 Unit: $U12 [03-06-07 17:47:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN195Cite as: 543 U. S. 194 (2004)Per CuriamWashington pursuant to Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983.He alleged that the shot fired by Brosseau constituted excessive force and violated his federal constitutional rights.1The District Court granted summary judgment to Brosseauafter finding she was entitled to qualified immunity. TheCourt of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. 339 F. 3d857 (2003). Following the two-step process set out in Saucier v. Katz, 533 U. S. 194 (2001), the Court of Appeals found,first, that Brosseau had violated Haugen's Fourth Amendment right to be free from excessive force and, second, thatthe right violated was clearly established and thus Brosseauwas not entitled to qualified immunity. Brosseau then peti-tioned for writ of certiorari, requesting that we review bothof the Court of Appeals' determinations. We grant the peti-tion on the second, qualified immunity question and reverse.The material facts, construed in a light most favorable toHaugen, are as follows.2 On the day before the fracas, GlenTamburello went to the police station and reported to Brosseau that Haugen, a former crime partner of his, had stolentools from his shop. Brosseau later learned that there wasa felony no-bail warrant out for Haugen's arrest on drug andother offenses. The next morning, Haugen was spray painting his Jeep Cherokee in his mother's driveway. Tambur-ello learned of Haugen's whereabouts, and he and cohortMatt Atwood drove a pickup truck to Haugen's mother'shouse to pay Haugen a visit. A fight ensued, which waswitnessed by a neighbor who called 911.Brosseau heard a report that the men were fighting inHaugen's mother's yard and responded. When she arrived,Tamburello and Atwood were attempting to get Haugen into1 Haugen also asserted pendent state-law claims and claims against thecity and police department. These claims are not presently before us.2 Because this case arises in the posture of a motion for summary judgment, we are required to view all facts and draw all reasonable inferencesin favor of the nonmoving party, Haugen. See Saucier v. Katz, 533 U. S.194, 201 (2001).543US1 Unit: $U12 [03-06-07 17:47:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN196 BROSSEAU v. HAUGENPer CuriamTamburello's pickup. Brosseau's arrival created a distrac-tion, which provided Haugen the opportunity to get away.Haugen ran through his mother's yard and hid in the neigh-borhood. Brosseau requested assistance, and, shortly thereafter, two officers arrived with a K-9 to help track Haugendown. During the search, which lasted about 30 to 45 minutes, officers instructed Tamburello and Atwood to remainin Tamburello's pickup. They instructed Deanna Nocera,Haugen's girlfriend who was also present with her 3-year-olddaughter, to remain in her small car with her daughter.Tamburello's pickup was parked in the street in front of thedriveway; Nocera's small car was parked in the driveway infront of and facing the Jeep; and the Jeep was in the driveway facing Nocera's car and angled somewhat to the left.The Jeep was parked about 4 feet away from Nocera's carand 20 to 30 feet away from Tamburello's pickup.An officer radioed from down the street that a neighborhad seen a man in her backyard. Brosseau ran in that direction, and Haugen appeared. He ran past the front of hismother's house and then turned and ran into the driveway.With Brosseau still in pursuit, he jumped into the driver'sside of the Jeep and closed and locked the door. Brosseaubelieved that he was running to the Jeep to retrieve aweapon.Brosseau arrived at the Jeep, pointed her gun at Haugen,and ordered him to get out of the vehicle. Haugen ignoredher command and continued to look for the keys so he couldget the Jeep started. Brosseau repeated her commands andhit the driver's side window several times with her handgun,which failed to deter Haugen. On the third or fourth try,the window shattered. Brosseau unsuccessfully attemptedto grab the keys and struck Haugen on the head with thebarrel and butt of her gun. Haugen, still undeterred, succeeded in starting the Jeep. As the Jeep started or shortlyafter it began to move, Brosseau jumped back and to the left.She fired one shot through the rear driver's side window543US1 Unit: $U12 [03-06-07 17:47:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN197Cite as: 543 U. S. 194 (2004)Per Curiamat a forward angle, hitting Haugen in the back. She laterexplained that she shot Haugen because she was " `fearfulfor the other officers on foot who [she] believed were in theimmediate area, [and] for the occupied vehicles in [Haugen's]path and for any other citizens who might be in the area.' "339 F. 3d, at 865.Despite being hit, Haugen, in his words, " `st[ood] on thegas' "; navigated the " `small, tight space' " to avoid the othervehicles; swerved across the neighbor's lawn; and continueddown the street.Id., at 882. After about a half block,Haugen realized that he had been shot and brought the Jeepto a halt. He suffered a collapsed lung and was airliftedto a hospital. He survived the shooting and subsequentlypleaded guilty to the felony of "eluding." Wash. Rev. Code$ 46.61.024 (1994). By so pleading, he admitted that hedrove his Jeep in a manner indicating "a wanton or wilfuldisregard for the lives . . . of others." Ibid. He subsequently brought this $ 1983 action against Brosseau.* * *When confronted with a claim of qualified immunity, acourt must ask first the following question: "Taken in thelight most favorable to the party asserting the injury, do thefacts alleged show the officer's conduct violated a constitutional right?" Saucier v. Katz, 533 U. S., at 201. As theCourt of Appeals recognized, the constitutional question inthis case is governed by the principles enunciated in Tennes-see v. Garner, 471 U. S. 1 (1985), and Graham v. Connor,490 U. S. 386 (1989). These cases establish that claims ofexcessive force are to be judged under the Fourth Amendment's " `objective reasonableness' " standard. Id., at 388.Specifically with regard to deadly force, we explained in Garner that it is unreasonable for an officer to "seize an un-armed, nondangerous suspect by shooting him dead." 471U. S., at 11. But "[w]here the officer has probable cause tobelieve that the suspect poses a threat of serious physical543US1 Unit: $U12 [03-06-07 17:47:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN198 BROSSEAU v. HAUGENPer Curiamharm, either to the officer or to others, it is not constitution-ally unreasonable to prevent escape by using deadly force."Ibid.We express no view as to the correctness of the Court ofAppeals' decision on the constitutional question itself. Webelieve that, however that question is decided, the Court ofAppeals was wrong on the issue of qualified immunity.3Qualified immunity shields an officer from suit when shemakes a decision that, even if constitutionally deficient, rea-sonably misapprehends the law governing the circumstancesshe confronted. Saucier v. Katz, 533 U. S., at 206 (qualifiedimmunity operates "to protect officers from the sometimes`hazy border between excessive and acceptable force' ").Because the focus is on whether the officer had fair noticethat her conduct was unlawful, reasonableness is judgedagainst the backdrop of the law at the time of the conduct.If the law at that time did not clearly establish that the offi-cer's conduct would violate the Constitution, the officershould not be subject to liability or, indeed, even the burdensof litigation.It is important to emphasize that this inquiry "must beundertaken in light of the specific context of the case, not asa broad general proposition." Id., at 201. As we previ-ously said in this very context:"[T]here is no doubt that Graham v. Connor, supra,clearly establishes the general proposition that use offorce is contrary to the Fourth Amendment if it is exces-sive under objective standards of reasonableness. Yetthat is not enough. Rather, we emphasized in Ander-son [v. Creighton] `that the right the official is allegedto have violated must have been "clearly established" in3 We have no occasion in this case to reconsider our instruction in Saucier v. Katz, supra, that lower courts decide the constitutional questionprior to deciding the qualified immunity question. We exercise our summary reversal procedure here simply to correct a clear misapprehensionof the qualified immunity standard.543US1 Unit: $U12 [03-06-07 17:47:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN199Cite as: 543 U. S. 194 (2004)Per Curiama more particularized, and hence more relevant, sense:The contours of the right must be sufficiently clear thata reasonable official would understand that what he isdoing violates that right.' 483 U. S. [635,] 640 [(1987)].The relevant, dispositive inquiry in determiningwhether a right is clearly established is whether itwould be clear to a reasonable officer that his conductwas unlawful in the situation he confronted."Id., at201-202.The Court of Appeals acknowledged this statement of law,but then proceeded to find fair warning in the general testsset out in Graham and Garner. 339 F. 3d, at 873-874. Inso doing, it was mistaken. Graham and Garner, followingthe lead of the Fourth Amendment's text, are cast at a highlevel of generality. See Graham v. Connor, supra, at 396(" `[T]he test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amend-ment is not capable of precise definition or mechanical application' "). Of course, in an obvious case, these standards can"clearly establish" the answer, even without a body of relevant case law. See Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U. S. 730, 738 (2002)(noting in a case where the Eighth Amendment violation was"obvious" that there need not be a materially similar casefor the right to be clearly established). See also Pace v.Capobianco, 283 F. 3d 1275, 1283 (CA11 2002) (explaining ina Fourth Amendment case involving an officer shooting afleeing suspect in a vehicle that, "when we look at decisionssuch asGarner and Graham, we see some tests to guide usin determining the law in many different kinds of circumstances; but we do not see the kind of clear law (clear an-swers) that would apply" to the situation at hand). Thepresent case is far from the obvious one where Graham andGarner alone offer a basis for decision.We therefore turn to ask whether, at the time of Bros-seau's actions, it was " ` "clearly established" ' " in this more" `particularized' " sense that she was violating Haugen'sFourth Amendment right.Saucier v. Katz, 533 U. S., at543US1 Unit: $U12 [03-06-07 17:47:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN200 BROSSEAU v. HAUGENPer Curiam202. The parties point us to only a handful of cases relevantto the "situation [Brosseau] confronted": whether to shoot adisturbed felon, set on avoiding capture through vehicularflight, when persons in the immediate area are at risk fromthat flight.4 Ibid. Specifically, Brosseau points us to Colev. Bone, 993 F. 2d 1328 (CA8 1993), and Smith v. Freland,954 F. 2d 343 (CA6 1992).In these cases, the courts found no Fourth Amendmentviolation when an officer shot a fleeing suspect who presented a risk to others. Cole v. Bone, supra, at 1333 (holding the officer "had probable cause to believe that the truckposed an imminent threat of serious physical harm to innocent motorists as well as to the officers themselves"); Smithv. Freland, 954 F. 2d, at 347 (noting "a car can be a deadlyweapon" and holding the officer's decision to stop the carfrom possibly injuring others was reasonable). Smith iscloser to this case. There, the officer and suspect engagedin a car chase, which appeared to be at an end when theofficer cornered the suspect at the back of a dead-end residential street. The suspect, however, freed his car andbegan speeding down the street. At this point, the officerfired a shot, which killed the suspect. The court held theofficer's decision was reasonable and thus did not violate theFourth Amendment. It noted that the suspect, like Haugenhere, "had proven he would do almost anything to avoid capture" and that he posed a major threat to, among others, theofficers at the end of the street. Ibid.4 The parties point us to a number of other cases in this vein that postdate the conduct in question, i. e., Brosseau's February 21, 1999, shootingof Haugen. See Cowan ex rel. Estate of Cooper v. Breen, 352 F. 3d 756,763 (CA2 2003); Pace v. Capobianco, 283 F. 3d 1275, 1281-1282 (CA112002); Scott v. Clay County, 205 F. 3d 867, 877 (CA6 2000); McCaslin v.Wilkins, 183 F. 3d 775, 778-779 (CA8 1999); Abraham v. Raso, 183 F. 3d279, 288-296 (CA3 1999). These decisions, of course, could not have givenfair notice to Brosseau and are of no use in the clearly established inquiry.543US1 Unit: $U12 [03-06-07 17:47:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN201Cite as: 543 U. S. 194 (2004)Breyer, J., concurringHaugen points us to Estate of Starks v. Enyart, 5 F. 3d230 (CA7 1993), where the court found summary judgmentinappropriate on a Fourth Amendment claim involving afleeing suspect. There, the court concluded that the threatcreated by the fleeing suspect's failure to brake when an of-ficer suddenly stepped in front of his just-started car was nota sufficiently grave threat to justify the use of deadly force.Id., at 234.These three cases taken together undoubtedly show thatthis area is one in which the result depends very much onthe facts of each case. None of them squarely governs thecase here; they do suggest that Brosseau's actions fell in the" `hazy border between excessive and acceptable force.' "Saucier v. Katz, supra, at 206. The cases by no means"clearly establish" that Brosseau's conduct violated theFourth Amendment.The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals forthe Ninth Circuit is therefore reversed, and the case is re-manded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
