UNITED STATEScertiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eighth circuitNo. 96-8516. Argued March 3, 1998--Decided May 18, 1998Petitioner pleaded guilty to drug possession with intent to distribute, 21U. S. C. $ 841(a)(1), and to "using" a firearm "during and in relation to adrug trafficking crime," 18 U. S. C. $ 924(c)(1), but reserved the right tochallenge the quantity of drugs used in calculating his sentence. Heappealed his sentence, but did not challenge the plea's validity. TheEighth Circuit affirmed. Subsequently, he sought habeas relief, claiming his guilty plea lacked a factual basis because neither the "evidence"nor the "plea allocation" showed a connection between the firearms inthe bedroom of the house and the garage where the drug traffickingoccurred. The District Court dismissed the petition on the ground thata factual basis for the plea existed because the guns in the bedroomwere in close proximity to the drugs and were readily accessible.While petitioner's appeal was pending, this Court held that a convictionfor using a firearm under $ 924(c)(1) requires the Government to show"active employment of the firearm," Bailey v. United States, 516 U. S.137, 144, not its mere possession, id., at 143. In affirming the dismissalin this case, the Eighth Circuit rejected petitioner's argument that Bailey should be applied retroactively, that his guilty plea was not knowingand intelligent because he was misinformed about the elements of a$ 924(c)(1) offense, that this claim was not waived by his guilty plea, andthat his conviction should therefore be vacated.Held: Although petitioner's claim was procedurally defaulted, he may beentitled to a hearing on its merits if he makes the necessary showing torelieve the default. Pp. 618-624.(a) Only a voluntary and intelligent guilty plea is constitutionallyvalid. Brady v. United States, 397 U. S. 742, 748. A plea is not intelligent unless a defendant first receives real notice of the nature of thecharge against him. Smith v. O'Grady, 312 U. S. 329, 334. Petitioner'splea would be, contrary to the Eighth Circuit's view, constitutionallyinvalid if he proved that the District Court misinformed him as to theelements of a $ 924(c)(1) offense. Brady v. United States, supra, McMann v. Richardson, 397 U. S. 759, and Parker v. North Carolina, 397U. S. 790, distinguished. Pp. 618-619.(b) The rule of Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288--that new constitutionalrules of criminal procedure are generally not applicable to cases that523US2 Unit: $U60 [04-29-00 18:56:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN615Cite as: 523 U. S. 614 (1998)Syllabusbecame final before the new rules were announced--does not bar petitioner's claim. There is nothing new about the principle that a pleamust be knowing and intelligent; and because Teague by its terms applies only to procedural rules, it is inapplicable to situations where thisCourt decides the meaning of a criminal statute enacted by Congress.Pp. 619-621.(c) Nonetheless, there are significant procedural hurdles to consideration of the merits of petitioner's claim, which can be attacked on collateral review only if it was first challenged on direct review. Since petitioner appealed his sentence, but not his plea, he has procedurallydefaulted the claim he presses here. To pursue the defaulted claim inhabeas, he must first demonstrate either "cause and actual prejudice,"e. g., Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478, 489, or that he is "actually innocent," id., at 496. His arguments that the legal basis for his claim wasnot reasonably available to counsel at the time of his plea and that itwould have been futile to attack the plea before Bailey do not establishcause for the default. However, the District Court did not addresswhether petitioner was actually innocent of the charge, and the Government does not contend that he waived this claim by failing to raise itbelow. Thus, on remand, he may attempt to make an actual innocenceshowing. Actual innocence means factual innocence, not mere legal insufficiency. Accordingly, the Government is not limited to the existingrecord but may present any admissible evidence of petitioner's guilt.Petitioner's actual innocence showing must also extend to charges thatthe Government has forgone in the course of plea bargaining. However, the Government errs in maintaining that petitioner must proveactual innocence of both "using" and "carrying" a firearm in violationof $ 924(c)(1). The indictment charged him only with "using" firearms,and there is no record evidence that the Government elected not tocharge him with "carrying" a firearm in exchange for his guilty plea.Pp. 621-624.97 F. 3d 284, reversed and remanded.Rehnquist, C.

Walsh.*Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of theCourt.Petitioner pleaded guilty to "using" a firearm in violationof 18 U. S. C. $ 924(c)(1) in 1990. Five years later we heldin Bailey v. United States, 516 U. S. 137, 144 (1995), that$ 924(c)(1)'s "use" prong requires the Government to show"active employment of the firearm." Petitioner meanwhilehad sought collateral relief under 28 U. S. C. $ 2255, claimingthat his guilty plea was not knowing and intelligent becausehe was misinformed by the District Court as to the natureof the charged crime. We hold that, although this claim wasprocedurally defaulted, petitioner may be entitled to a hearing on the merits of it if he makes the necessary showing torelieve the default.Following his arrest in March 1990, petitioner was chargedwith possession of methamphetamine with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U. S. C. $ 841(a)(1). A supersedingindictment added the charge that he "knowingly and intentionally used . . . firearms during and in relation to a drugtrafficking crime," in violation of 18 U. S.

Following a sentencing hearing, theDistrict Court sentenced petitioner to 78 months' imprisonment on the drug count, a consecutive term of 60 months'imprisonment on the $ 924(c) count, and four years of supervised release. Id., at 83-84. Petitioner appealed his sentence, but did not challenge the validity of his plea. TheCourt of Appeals affirmed. 950 F. 2d 727 (CA8 1991).In June 1994, petitioner sought a writ of habeas corpusunder 28 U. S. C. $ 2241, challenging the factual basis for hisguilty plea on the ground that neither the "evidence" nor the"plea allocution" showed a "connection between the firearmsin the bedroom of the house, and the garage, where the drugtrafficking occurred." App. 109. A Magistrate Judge recommended that the petition be treated as a motion under 28U. S. C. $ 2255 and recommended dismissal, concluding thatthere was a factual basis for petitioner's guilty plea becausethe guns in petitioner's bedroom were in close proximity todrugs and were readily accessible. App. 148-153. The District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge's Report and Recommendation and ordered that the petition be dismissed.Id., at 154-155.Petitioner appealed. While his appeal was pending, weheld in Bailey that a conviction for use of a firearm under$ 924(c)(1) requires the Government to show "active employment of the firearm." 516 U. S., at 144. As we explained,active employment includes uses such as "brandishing, displaying, bartering, striking with, and, most obviously, firingor attempting to fire" the weapon, id., at 148, but does notinclude mere possession of a firearm, id., at 143. Thus, a"defendant cannot be charged under $ 924(c)(1) merely forstoring a weapon near drugs or drug proceeds," or for"placement of a firearm to provide a sense of security or toembolden." Id., at 149.Following our decision in Bailey, the Court of Appealsappointed counsel to represent petitioner. Counsel arguedthat Bailey should be applied "retroactively," that petition523US2 Unit: $U60 [04-29-00 18:56:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN618 BOUSLEY v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courter's guilty plea was involuntary because he was misinformedabout the elements of a $ 924(c)(1) offense, that this claimwas not waived by his guilty plea, and that his convictionshould therefore be vacated. Nevertheless, the Court ofAppeals affirmed the District Court's order of dismissal.Bousley v. Brooks, 97 F. 3d 284 (CA8 1996).We then granted certiorari, 521 U. S. 1152 (1997), to resolve a split among the Circuits over the permissibility ofpost-Bailey collateral attacks on $ 924(c)(1) convictions obtained pursuant to guilty pleas.1 Because the Governmentdisagreed with the Court of Appeals' analysis, we appointedamicus curiae to brief and argue the case in support of thejudgment below. 522 U. S. 990 (1997).A plea of guilty is constitutionally valid only to the extentit is "voluntary" and "intelligent." Brady v. United States,397 U. S. 742, 748 (1970). We have long held that a plea doesnot qualify as intelligent unless a criminal defendant firstreceives "real notice of the true nature of the charge againsthim, the first and most universally recognized requirementof due process." Smith v. O'Grady, 312 U. S. 329, 334 (1941).Amicus contends that petitioner's plea was intelligentlymade because, prior to pleading guilty, he was provided witha copy of his indictment, which charged him with "using" afirearm. Such circumstances, standing alone, give rise to apresumption that the defendant was informed of the natureof the charge against him.Henderson v. Morgan, 426 U. S.637, 647 (1976); id., at 650 (White, J., concurring). Petitionernonetheless maintains that his guilty plea was unintelligentbecause the District Court subsequently misinformed himas to the elements of a $ 924(c)(1) offense. In other words,petitioner contends that the record reveals that neither he,nor his counsel, nor the court correctly understood the essen-tial elements of the crime with which he was charged.

S. 614 (1998)Opinion of the Courtthis contention proved, petitioner's plea would be, contraryto the view expressed by the Court of Appeals, constitutionally invalid.Our decisions inBrady v. United States, supra, McMannv. Richardson, 397 U. S. 759 (1970), and Parker v. North Carolina, 397 U. S. 790 (1970), relied upon by amicus, are not tothe contrary. Each of those cases involved a criminal defendant who pleaded guilty after being correctly informedas to the essential nature of the charge against him. SeeBrady, supra, at 756; McMann, supra, at 767; Parker, supra,at 792. Those defendants later attempted to challenge theirguilty pleas when it became evident that they had misjudgedthe strength of the Government's case or the penalties towhich they were subject. For example, Brady, who pleadedguilty to kidnaping, maintained that his plea was neither voluntary nor intelligent because it was induced by a death penalty provision later held unconstitutional. 397 U. S., at 744.We rejected Brady's voluntariness argument, explaining thata "plea of guilty entered by one fully aware of the directconsequences" of the plea is voluntary in a constitutionalsense "unless induced by threats . . . , misrepresentation . . . ,or perhaps by promises that are by their nature improper ashaving no proper relationship to the prosecutor's business."Id., at 755 (internal quotation marks omitted). We furtherheld that Brady's plea was intelligent because, although laterjudicial decisions indicated that at the time of his plea he"did not correctly assess every relevant factor entering intohis decision," id., at 757, he was advised by competent counsel, was in control of his mental faculties, and "was madeaware of the nature of the charge against him," id., at 756.In this case, by contrast, petitioner asserts that he was misinformed as to the true nature of the charge against him.Amicus urges us to apply the rule of Teague v. Lane, 489U. S. 288 (1989), to petitioner's claim that his plea was notknowing and intelligent. In Teague, we held that "new constitutional rules of criminal procedure will not be applicable523US2 Unit: $U60 [04-29-00 18:56:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN620 BOUSLEY v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtto those cases which have become final before the new rulesare announced," id., at 310, unless the new rule "places `certain kinds of primary, private individual conduct beyond thepower of the criminal law-making authority to proscribe,' "id., at 311 (quoting Mackey v. United States, 401 U. S. 667,692 (1971) (Harlan, J., concurring in part and dissenting inpart)), or could be considered a "watershed rul[e] of criminalprocedure," 489 U. S., at 311. But we do not believe thatTeague governs this case. The only constitutional claimmade here is that petitioner's guilty plea was not knowingand intelligent. There is surely nothing new about thisprinciple, enumerated as long ago as Smith v. O'Grady,supra. And because Teague by its terms applies only toprocedural rules, we think it is inapplicable to the situationin which this Court decides the meaning of a criminal statuteenacted by Congress.This distinction between substance and procedure is animportant one in the habeas context. The Teague doctrineis founded on the notion that one of the "principal functionsof habeas corpus [is] `to assure that no man has been incarcerated under a procedure which creates an impermissiblylarge risk that the innocent will be convicted.' " 489 U. S.,at 312 (quoting Desist v. United States, 394 U. S. 244, 262(1969)). Consequently, unless a new rule of criminal procedure is of such a nature that "without [it] the likelihood of anaccurate conviction is seriously diminished," 489 U. S., at 313,there is no reason to apply the rule retroactively on habeasreview. By contrast, decisions of this Court holding that asubstantive federal criminal statute does not reach certainconduct, like decisions placing conduct " `beyond the powerof the criminal law-making authority to proscribe,' " id., at311 (quoting Mackey, supra, at 692), necessarily carry a significant risk that a defendant stands convicted of "an act thatthe law does not make criminal." Davis v. United States,417 U. S. 333, 346 (1974). For under our federal system it is523US2 Unit: $U60 [04-29-00 18:56:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN621Cite as: 523 U. S. 614 (1998)Opinion of the Courtonly Congress, and not the courts, which can make conductcriminal. United States v. Lanier, 520 U. S. 259, 267-268,n. 6 (1997); United States v. Hudson, 7 Cranch 32 (1812).Accordingly, it would be inconsistent with the doctrinal underpinnings of habeas review to preclude petitioner from relying on our decision in Bailey in support of his claim thathis guilty plea was constitutionally invalid.Though petitioner's claim is not Teague-barred, there arenonetheless significant procedural hurdles to its consideration on the merits. We have strictly limited the circumstances under which a guilty plea may be attacked oncollateral review. "It is well settled that a voluntary andintelligent plea of guilty made by an accused person, who hasbeen advised by competent counsel, may not be collaterallyattacked." Mabry v. Johnson, 467 U. S. 504, 508 (1984)(footnote omitted). And even the voluntariness and intelligence of a guilty plea can be attacked on collateral reviewonly if first challenged on direct review. Habeas review isan extraordinary remedy and " `will not be allowed to doservice for an appeal.' " Reed v. Farley, 512 U. S. 339, 354(1994) (quoting Sunal v. Large, 332 U. S. 174, 178 (1947)).Indeed, "the concern with finality served by the limitation oncollateral attack has special force with respect to convictionsbased on guilty pleas." United States v. Timmreck, 441U. S. 780, 784 (1979). In this case, petitioner contested hissentence on appeal, but did not challenge the validity of hisplea. In failing to do so, petitioner procedurally defaultedthe claim he now presses on us.In an effort to avoid this conclusion, petitioner contendsthat his claim falls within an exception to the proceduraldefault rule for claims that could not be presented withoutfurther factual development. Brief for Petitioner 28-34.In Waley v. Johnston, 316 U. S. 101 (1942) (per curiam), weheld that there was such an exception for a claim that a pleaof guilty had been coerced by threats made by a Government523US2 Unit: $U60 [04-29-00 18:56:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN622 BOUSLEY v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtagent, when the facts were "dehors the record and their effect on the judgment was not open to consideration and review on appeal." Id., at 104. Petitioner's claim, however,differs significantly from that advanced in Waley. He is notarguing that his guilty plea was involuntary because it wascoerced, but rather that it was not intelligent because theinformation provided him by the District Court at his pleacolloquy was erroneous. This type of claim can be fully andcompletely addressed on direct review based on the recordcreated at the plea colloquy.Where a defendant has procedurally defaulted a claim byfailing to raise it on direct review, the claim may be raisedin habeas only if the defendant can first demonstrate either"cause" and actual "prejudice," Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S.478, 485 (1986); Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, 87 (1977),or that he is "actually innocent," Murray, supra, at 496;Smith v. Murray, 477 U. S. 527, 537 (1986).Petitioner offers two explanations for his default in anattempt to demonstrate cause. First, he argues that "thelegal basis for his claim was not reasonably available to counsel" at the time his plea was entered. Brief for Petitioner35. This argument is without merit. While we have heldthat a claim that "is so novel that its legal basis is not reasonably available to counsel" may constitute cause for a procedural default, Reed v. Ross, 468 U. S. 1, 16 (1984), petitioner'sclaim does not qualify as such. The argument that it waserror for the District Court to misinform petitioner as to thestatutory elements of $ 924(c)(1) was most surely not a novelone. See Henderson, 426 U. S., at 645-646. Indeed, at thetime of petitioner's plea, the Federal Reporters were repletewith cases involving challenges to the notion that "use" issynonymous with mere "possession." See, e. g., UnitedStates v. Cooper, 942 F. 2d 1200, 1206 (CA7 1991) (appealfrom plea of guilty to "use" of a firearm in violation of523US2 Unit: $U60 [04-29-00 18:56:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN623Cite as: 523 U. S. 614 (1998)Opinion of the Court$ 924(c)(1)), cert. denied, 503 U. S. 923 (1992).2 Petitioneralso contends that his default should be excused because,"before Bailey, any attempt to attack [his] guilty plea wouldhave been futile." Brief for Petitioner 35. This argument,too, is unavailing. As we clearly stated in Engle v. Isaac,456 U. S. 107 (1982), "futility cannot constitute cause if itmeans simply that a claim was `unacceptable to that particular court at that particular time.' " Id., at 130, n. 35.Therefore, petitioner is unable to establish cause for hisdefault.Petitioner's claim may still be reviewed in this collateralproceeding if he can establish that the constitutional error inhis plea colloquy "has probably resulted in the conviction ofone who is actually innocent." Murray v. Carrier, supra,at 496. To establish actual innocence, petitioner must dem-onstrate that, " `in light of all the evidence,' " "it is morelikely than not that no reasonable juror would have convictedhim."Schlup v. Delo, 513 U. S. 298, 327-328 (1995) (quotingFriendly, Is Innocence Irrelevant? Collateral Attack onCriminal Judgments, 38 U. Chi. L. Rev. 142, 160 (1970)).The District Court failed to address petitioner's actual inno-cence, perhaps because petitioner failed to raise it initiallyin his $ 2255 motion. However, the Government does notcontend that petitioner waived this claim by failing to raiseit below. Accordingly, we believe it appropriate to remandthis case to permit petitioner to attempt to make a showingof actual innocence.It is important to note in this regard that "actual innocence" means factual innocence, not mere legal insufficiency.2 Even were we to conclude that petitioner's counsel was unaware at thetime that petitioner's plea colloquy was constitutionally deficient, "[w]herethe basis of a . . . claim is available, and other defense counsel have perceived and litigated that claim, the demands of comity and finality counselagainst labeling alleged unawareness of the objection as cause for a procedural default." Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 134 (1982).523US2 Unit: $U60 [04-29-00 18:56:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN624 BOUSLEY v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtSee Sawyer v. Whitley, 505 U. S. 333, 339 (1992). In otherwords, the Government is not limited to the existing recordto rebut any showing that petitioner might make. Rather,on remand, the Government should be permitted to presentany admissible evidence of petitioner's guilt even if that evidence was not presented during petitioner's plea colloquyand would not normally have been offered before our decision in Bailey.3 In cases where the Government has forgonemore serious charges in the course of plea bargaining, petitioner's showing of actual innocence must also extend tothose charges.In this case, the Government maintains that petitionermust demonstrate that he is actually innocent of both"using" and "carrying" a firearm in violation of $ 924(c)(1).But petitioner's indictment charged him only with "using"firearms in violation of $ 924(c)(1). App. 5-6. And there isno record evidence that the Government elected not tocharge petitioner with "carrying" a firearm in exchange forhis plea of guilty. Accordingly, petitioner need demonstrateno more than that he did not "use" a firearm as that term isdefined in Bailey.If, on remand, petitioner can make that showing, he willthen be entitled to have his defaulted claim of an unintelligent plea considered on its merits. The judgment of theCourt of Appeals is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
