Our per curiam opinion issued today in a civil case, Lawrence v. Chater, ante, p. 163; contains a general discussionof the considerations that properly influence this Court indeciding whether to grant a petition for certiorari, vacatethe judgment below, and remand the case (GVR) for furtherconsideration in light of potentially pertinent matters whichit appears that the lower court may not have considered.Here, we apply that analysis to a criminal case, again findingthat the particularities of the case before us merit a GVR.Stutson, the petitioner in this case, is currently serving afederal prison sentence of 292 months for cocaine possession.He has had no appellate review of his legal argumentsagainst conviction and sentence. The District Court heldthat his appeal was untimely and that the untimeliness wasnot the result of "excusable neglect" within the meaning ofRule 4(b) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, be-cause his lawyer's office mailed his notice of appeal so thatit arrived one working day late for the 10-day deadline, andat the Court of Appeals, when it should have been sent tothe District Court. The District Court's opinion did notadvert to our decision in Pioneer Investment Services Co. v.Brunswick Associates Ltd. Partnership, 507 U. S. 380 (1993),rendered one day before Stutson's brief was due in the Dis-trict Court and not cited in the briefs before that court. InPioneer, we held that a party could in some circumstancesrely on his attorney's inadvertent failure to file a proof ofclaim in a timely manner in bankruptcy proceedings as "ex-cusable neglect" under the bankruptcy rules.Stutson appealed the District Court's ruling. In theirbriefs to the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, theparties disputed the applicability ofPioneer's liberal understanding of "excusable neglect" to the Rule 4(b) criminalappeal context, the Government contending that it appliedonly in bankruptcy cases. The Court of Appeals affirmedthe District Court and dismissed Stutson's appeal without516us1$14J 10-22-98 11:16:14 PAGES OPINPGT195Cite as: 516 U. S. 193 (1996)Per Curiamhearing oral argument or writing an opinion. Now, in hisresponse to Stutson's petition for certiorari, the SolicitorGeneral has reversed the Government's position. Thischange of position follows the unanimous view of the sixCourts of Appeals that, unlike the Eleventh Circuit inthis case, have expressly addressed this new and importantissue, and have held that the Pioneer standard applies inRule 4 cases. SeeUnited States v. Clark, 51 F. 3d 42, 44(CA5 1995) (Rule 4(b)); United States v. Hooper, 9 F. 3d 257,259 (CA2 1993) (same); Chanute v.

Briggs & Stratton Corp., 53 F. 3d 451, 454,n. 3 (CA1 1995) (same).*In sum, this is a case where (1) the prevailing party below,the Government, has now repudiated the legal position thatit advanced below; (2) the only opinion below did not considerthe import of a recent Supreme Court precedent that bothparties now agree applies; (3) the Court of Appeals sum-marily affirmed that decision; (4) all six Courts of Appealsthat have addressed the applicability of the Supreme Courtdecision that the District Court did not apply in this casehave concluded that it applies to Rule 4 cases; and (5) thepetitioner is in jail having, through no fault of his own, hadno plenary consideration of his appeal. While "we `should[not] mechanically accept any suggestion from the SolicitorGeneral that a decision rendered in favor of the Governmentby a United States Court of Appeals was in error,' " Lawrence, ante, at 171 (quoting Mariscal v.

UNITED STATESPer Curiamtional combination of circumstances presents ample justification for a GVR order. It appears to us that there is atleast a reasonable probability that the Court of Appeals willreach a different conclusion on remand, and the equitiesclearly favor a GVR order.If the Court of Appeals here, in its summary affirmance,did not rely on the Government's primary argument and thelower court's basic premise--that Pioneer did not apply--itdoes not seem to us that we place an excessive burden on it,relative to Stutson's liberty and due process interests, byinviting it to clarify its ambiguous ruling. A contrary approach would risk effectively immunizing summary dispositions by courts of appeals from our review, since it is rarethat their basis for decision is entirely unambiguous. SeeLawrence, ante, at 170 (discussing Netherland v. Tuggle, 515U. S. 951 (1995)). If, on the other hand, the Court of Appeals did not fully consider the applicability of Pioneer, or ifit concluded that Pioneer does not apply under Rule 4, itmight well conclude that while "[t]he law is the law," ante,at 184 (Scalia, J., dissenting), the combination of the Government's change of position and the subsequent contrarydecisions of four other Courts of Appeals shed light on thelaw applicable to this case. If it continues to conclude thatPioneer does not apply, it will be useful for us to have thebenefit of its views so that we may resolve the resulting conflict between the Circuits.Finally, it is not insignificant that this is a criminal case.When a litigant is subject to the continuing coercive powerof the Government in the form of imprisonment, our legaltraditions reflect a certain solicitude for his rights, to whichthe important public interests in judicial efficiency and finality must occasionally be accommodated. We have previously refused to allow technicalities that caused no prejudice to the prosecution to preclude a remand under 28U. S. C. $ 2106 (1988 ed.) "in the interests of justice."

And proceduralaccommodations to prisoners are a familiar aspect of our jurisprudence. See, e. g., 28 U. S. C. $ 2255 (1988 ed.)

S. 58, 63-64 (1970) (unlike in civil cases, time limits forpetitions for certiorari in criminal cases are not jurisdictional). To the extent that the dissent suggests that it isinconsistent with our "traditional practice," ante, at 178(opinion of Scalia, J.), to call upon a Court of Appeals toreconsider its dismissal of a prisoner's appeal because hislawyer filed it one day late, in circumstances where the Courtof Appeals' decision may have been premised on the assumption, unanimously rejected by other Courts of Appeals, thatmore stringent rules as to filing deadlines apply to prisonersthan to creditors filing claims in a bankruptcy proceeding,we must respectfully disagree.Judicial efficiency and finality are important values, andour GVR power should not be exercised for "[m]ere convenience," cf. Adams v. United States ex rel. McCann, 317 U. S.269, 274 (1942). "But dry formalism should not sterilizeprocedural resources which Congress has made available tothe federal courts." Ibid. In this case, as in Lawrence v.Chater, a GVR order guarantees to the petitioner full andfair consideration of his rights in light of all pertinent considerations, and is also satisfactory to the Government. In thiscase, as in Lawrence, a GVR order both promotes fairnessand respects the dignity of the Court of Appeals by enablingit to consider potentially relevant decisions and argumentsthat were not previously before it.Accordingly, the motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis and the petition for a writ of certiorari are granted.The judgment is vacated and the case is remanded to theUnited States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit for516us1$14J 10-22-98 11:16:14 PAGES OPINPGT198 STUTSON v.

Argued October 31, 1995--Decided January 9, 1996Twelve-year-old Natalie Calhoun was killed in a collision in territorialwaters off Puerto Rico while riding a jet ski manufactured and distributed by petitioners Yamaha. Natalie's parents, respondents Calhoun,filed this federal diversity and admiralty action for damages againstYamaha, invoking Pennsylvania's wrongful-death and survival statutes.The District Court agreed with Yamaha that the federal maritimewrongful-death action recognized in Moragne v. States Marine Lines,Inc., 398 U. S. 375, controlled to the exclusion of state law. In its orderpresenting the matter for immediate interlocutory appeal pursuant to28 U. S. C. $ 1292(b), the District Court certified questions of lawconcerning the recoverability of particular items of damages underMoragne. The Third Circuit granted interlocutory review, but thepanel to which the appeal was assigned did not reach the questionspresented in the certified order. Instead, the panel addressed and resolved an anterior issue; it held that state remedies remain applicablein accident cases of this type and have not been displaced by the federalmaritime wrongful-death action recognized in Moragne.Held:1. Section 1292(b) provides that "[w]hen a district judge, in making. . . an order not otherwise appealable . . . , shall be of the opinion thatsuch order involves a controlling question of law as to which there issubstantial ground for difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination ofthe litigation, he shall so state in writing in such order," and specifiesthat "the Court of Appeals . . . may thereupon, in its discretion, permitan appeal to be taken from such order" (emphasis added). As that textindicates, the court of appeals can exercise interlocutory jurisdictionover any question fairly included within the order certified by the district court, and is not limited to the particular questions of law thereinformulated.

In maritime wrongful-death cases in which no federal statute specifies the appropriate relief and the decedent was not a seaman, longshore516us1$15Z 10-22-98 11:19:14 PAGES OPINPGT200 YAMAHA MOTOR CORP., U. S. A. v. CALHOUNSyllabusworker, or person otherwise engaged in a maritime trade, state remedies remain applicable and have not been displaced by the wrongfuldeath action recognized in Moragne. Pp. 206-216.(a) In The Harrisburg, 119 U. S. 199, this Court ruled that the general maritime law (a species of judge-made federal common law) did notafford a cause of action for wrongful death. Federal admiralty courts,prior to Moragne, tempered the harshness of The Harrisburg's ruleby allowing recovery under state wrongful-death and survival statutesin maritime accident cases. See, e. g., Western Fuel Co. v. Garcia, 257U. S. 233. Such state laws proved an adequate supplement to federalmaritime law, until a series of this Court's decisions transformed themaritime doctrine of unseaworthiness into a rule making shipownersstrictly liable to seamen injured by the owners' failure to supply safeships. See, e. g., Mahnich v. Southern S. S. Co., 321 U. S. 96. By thetime Moragne was decided, claims premised on unseaworthiness hadbecome "the principal vehicle for recovery" by seamen and other maritime workers injured or killed in the course of their employment. 398U. S., at 399. The disparity between the unseaworthiness doctrine'sstrict liability standard and negligence-based state wrongful-death statutes prompted the Moragne Court, id., at 409, to overrule The Harrisburg and hold that an action "lie[s] under general maritime law for deathcaused by violation of maritime duties." Pp. 206-209.(b) This Court rejects Yamaha's argument that Moragne'swrongful-death action covers the waters, creating a uniform federalmaritime remedy for all deaths occurring in state territorial waters, andousting all state remedies previously available to supplement generalmaritime law. The uniformity concerns that prompted the MoragneCourt to overrule The Harrisburg related to ships and the workers whoserve them, and to the frequent unavailability of unseaworthiness,a distinctively maritime substantive concept, as a basis of liabilityunder state law. See 398 U. S., at 395-396. The concerns underlying Moragne were of a different order than those invoked by Yamaha.Notably, Yamaha seeks the contraction of remedies, not the extensionof relief in light of the "humane and liberal" character of admiralty proceedings recognized in Moragne. See id., at 387. The Moragne Courttied its petitioner's unseaworthiness plea to a federal right-of-action anchor, but left in place the negligence claim she had stated under Florida's law, and thus showed no hostility to concurrent application of statewrongful-death statutes that might provide a more generous remedy.Cf. Sun Ship, Inc. v. Pennsylvania, 447 U. S. 715, 724. No congressionally prescribed, comprehensive tort recovery regime prevents such enlargement of damages here. See Miles v. Apex Marine Corp., 498 U. S.19, 30-36. The only relevant congressional disposition, the Death on516us1$15Z 10-22-98 11:19:14 PAGES OPINPGT201Cite as: 516 U.

The manufacturer contended that state remediescould not be applied because Natalie died on navigable waters; federal, judge-declared maritime law, the manufacturerurged, controlled to the exclusion of state law.Traditionally, state remedies have been applied in accidentcases of this order--maritime wrongful-death cases in whichno federal statute specifies the appropriate relief and the de-cedent was not a seaman, longshore worker, or person otherwise engaged in a maritime trade. We hold, in accord withthe United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit,that state remedies remain applicable in such cases and havenot been displaced by the federal maritime wrongful-deathaction recognized in Moragne v. States Marine Lines, Inc.,398 U. S. 375 (1970).INatalie Calhoun, the 12-year-old daughter of respondentsLucien and Robin Calhoun, died in a tragic accident on July6, 1989. On vacation with family friends at a resort hotelin Puerto Rico, Natalie had rented a "WaveJammer" jet skimanufactured by Yamaha Motor Company, Ltd., and distrib-uted by Yamaha Motor Corporation, U. S. A. (collectively,Yamaha), the petitioners in this case. While riding theWaveJammer, Natalie slammed into a vessel anchored in thewaters off the hotel frontage, and was killed.The Calhouns, individually and in their capacities as administrators of their daughter's estate, sued Yamaha in theUnited States District Court for the Eastern District ofPennsylvania. Invoking Pennsylvania's wrongful-death andsurvival statutes, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. $$ 8301-8302 (1982 andSupp. 1995), the Calhouns asserted several bases for recov-ery (including negligence, strict liability, and breach of implied warranties), and sought damages for lost future earn-ings, loss of society, loss of support and services, and funeralexpenses, as well as punitive damages. They grounded fed516us1$15P 10-22-98 11:19:14 PAGES OPINPGT203Cite as: 516 U. S. 199 (1996)Opinion of the Courteral jurisdiction on both diversity of citizenship, 28 U. S.

States Marine Lines, Inc., 398 U. S.375 (1970), provided the exclusive basis for recovery, displacing all remedies afforded by state law. Under Moragne,Yamaha contended, the Calhouns could recover as damagesonly Natalie's funeral expenses. The District Court agreedwith Yamaha thatMoragne's maritime death action dis-placed state remedies; the court held, however, that loss ofsociety and loss of support and services were compensableunderMoragne.Both sides asked the District Court to present questionsfor immediate interlocutory appeal pursuant to 28 U.

The counts ofthe complaint directed against the Yamaha defendantsallege that the accident was caused by a defect or defects in a Yamaha jet ski which Natalie Calhoun hadrented and was using at the time of the fatal accident.Those counts sound in negligence, in strict liability, andin implied warranties of merchantability and fitness.The district court has concluded that admiralty jurisdic-tion attaches to these several counts and that they1 The Calhouns are citizens of Pennsylvania.

Thequestions of law certified to the Court of Appeals arewhether, pursuant to such a maritime cause of action,plaintiffs may seek to recover (1) damages for the lossof the society of their deceased minor child, (2) damagesfor the loss of their child's future earnings, and (3) punitive damages." App. to Pet. for Cert. A-78.Although the Court of Appeals granted the interlocutoryreview petition, the panel to which the appeal was assigneddid not reach the questions presented in the certified order,for it determined that an anterior issue was pivotal. TheDistrict Court, as just recounted, had concluded that anydamages the Calhouns might recover from Yamaha would begoverned exclusively by federal maritime law. But theThird Circuit panel questioned that conclusion and inquiredwhether state wrongful-death and survival statutes suppliedthe remedial prescriptions for the Calhouns' complaint. Theappellate panel asked whether the state remedies enduredor were "displaced by a federal maritime rule of decision."40 F. 3d 622, 624 (1994). Ultimately, the Court of Appealsruled that state-law remedies apply in this case.Id., at 644.IIIn our order granting certiorari, we asked the parties tobrief a preliminary question: "Under 28 U. S. C. $ 1292(b), canthe courts of appeals exercise jurisdiction over any questionthat is included within the order that contains the controllingquestion of law identified by the district court?" 514 U. S.1126 (1995). The answer to that question, we are satisfied,is yes.Section 1292(b) provides, in pertinent part:"When a district judge, in making in a civil action anorder not otherwise appealable under this section, shallbe of the opinion that such order involves a controllingquestion of law as to which there is substantial ground516us1$15P 10-22-98 11:19:14 PAGES OPINPGT205Cite as: 516 U.

The Court of Appeals . . . may thereupon,in its discretion, permit an appeal to be taken from suchorder, if application is made to it within ten days afterthe entry of the order." (Emphasis added.)As the text of $ 1292(b) indicates, appellate jurisdiction ap-plies to theorder certified to the court of appeals, and is nottied to the particular question formulated by the districtcourt. The court of appeals may not reach beyond the certified order to address other orders made in the case. UnitedStates v. Stanley, 483 U. S. 669, 677 (1987). But the appellate court may address any issue fairly included within thecertified order because "it is theorder that is appealable, andnot the controlling question identified by the district court."9 J. Moore & B. Ward, Moore's Federal Practice || 110.25[1],p. 300 (2d ed. 1995). See also 16 C. Wright, A. Miller,E. Cooper, & E. Gressman, Federal Practice and Procedure$ 3929, pp. 144-145 (1977) ("[T]he court of appeals may review the entire order, either to consider a question differentthan the one certified as controlling or to decide the casedespite the lack of any identified controlling question.");Note, Interlocutory Appeals in the Federal Courts Under 28U.

CALHOUNOpinion of the CourtIIIBecause this case involves a watercraft collision on naviga-ble waters, it falls within admiralty's domain. SeeSissonv. Ruby, 497 U. S. 358, 361-367 (1990); Foremost Ins. Co. v.Richardson, 457 U. S. 668, 677 (1982). "With admiraltyjurisdiction," we have often said, "comes the application ofsubstantive admiralty law." East River S. S. Corp. v.Transamerica Delaval Inc., 476 U. S. 858, 864 (1986). Theexercise of admiralty jurisdiction, however, "does not resultin automatic displacement of state law."Jerome B. Gru-bart, Inc. v. Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co., 513 U. S. 527,545 (1995). Indeed, prior to Moragne, federal admiraltycourts routinely applied state wrongful-death and survivalstatutes in maritime accident cases.3 The question beforeus is whether Moragne should be read to stop that practice.Our review of maritime wrongful-death law begins withThe Harrisburg, 119 U. S. 199 (1886), where we held thatthe general maritime law (a species of judge-made federalcommon law) did not afford a cause of action for wrongfuldeath. The Harrisburg Court said that wrongful-death ac-tions are statutory and may not be created by judicial decree.The Court did not question the soundness of this view, orexamine the historical justifications that account for it. Instead, the Court merely noted that common law in theUnited States, like the common law of England, did not allowrecovery "for an injury which results in death,"id., at 204(internal quotation marks omitted), and that no country had"adopted a different rule on this subject for the sea from thatwhich it maintains on the land,"id., at 213. The Court didnot consider itself free to chart a different course by craftinga judge-made wrongful-death action under our maritime law.Federal admiralty courts tempered the harshness ofThe Harrisburg's rule by allowing recovery under state3 Throughout this opinion, for economy, we use the term wrongful-deathremedies or statutes to include survival statutes.516us1$15P 10-22-98 11:19:14 PAGES OPINPGT207Cite as: 516 U. S. 199 (1996)Opinion of the Courtwrongful-death statutes. See, e. g., The Hamilton, 207 U. S.398 (1907); The City of Norwalk, 55 F. 98 (SDNY 1893).4We reaffirmed this practice in Western Fuel Co. v. Garcia,257 U. S. 233 (1921), by holding that California's wrongfuldeath statute governed a suit brought by the widow of amaritime worker killed in that State's territorial waters.Though we had generally refused to give effect to state lawsregarded as inconsonant with the substance of federal maritime law, we concluded that extending state wrongful-deathstatutes to fatal accidents in territorial waters was compatible with substantive maritime policies: "The subject is mari-time and local in character and the specified modification ofor supplement to the rule applied in admiralty courts . . . willnot work material prejudice to the characteristic featuresof the general maritime law, nor interfere with the properharmony and uniformity of that law in its international andinterstate relations." Id., at 242.5 On similar reasoning,we also held that state survival statutes may be applied incases arising out of accidents in territorial waters. See Justv. Chambers, 312 U. S. 383, 391-392 (1941).State wrongful-death statutes proved an adequate supple-ment to federal maritime law, until a series of this Court's4 Congress also mitigated the impact of The Harrisburg by enacting twostatutes affording recovery for wrongful death. In 1920, Congress passedthe Death on the High Seas Act (DOHSA), 46 U. S. C. App. $ 761 et seq.(1988 ed.), which provides a federal claim for wrongful death occurringmore than three nautical miles from the shore of any State or Territory.In that same year, Congress also passed the Jones Act, 46 U. S. C. App.$ 688 (1988 ed.), which provides a wrongful-death claim to the survivors ofseamen killed in the course of their employment, whether on the high seasor in territorial waters.5 Indeed, years before The Harrisburg, this Court rendered a pathmarking decision, Steamboat Co. v. Chase, 16 Wall. 522 (1873). In Steamboat,the Court upheld, under the "saving-to-suitors" proviso of the JudiciaryAct of 1789 (surviving currently in 28 U. S. C. $ 1333(1)), a state court'sapplication of the State's wrongful-death statute to a fatality caused bya collision in territorial waters between defendants' steamboat and asailboat in which plaintiff's decedent was passing.516us1$15P 10-22-98 11:19:14 PAGES OPINPGT208 YAMAHA MOTOR CORP., U. S. A. v. CALHOUNOpinion of the Courtdecisions transformed the maritime doctrine of unseaworthiness into a strict-liability rule. Prior to 1944, unseaworthiness "was an obscure and relatively little used" liabilitystandard, largely because "a shipowner's duty at that timewas only to use due diligence to provide a seaworthy ship."Miles v. Apex Marine Corp., 498 U. S. 19, 25 (1990) (internalquotation marks omitted). See also Moragne, 398 U. S., at398-399. Mahnich v. Southern S. S. Co., 321 U. S. 96 (1944),however, notably expanded a shipowner's liability to injuredseamen by imposing a nondelegable duty "to furnish a vesseland appurtenances reasonably fit for their intended use."Mitchell v. Trawler Racer, Inc., 362 U. S. 539, 550 (1960).The duty imposed was absolute; failure to supply a safe shipresulted in liability "irrespective of fault and irrespective ofthe intervening negligence of crew members." Miles, 498U. S., at 25. The unseaworthiness doctrine thus becamea "species of liability without fault," Seas Shipping Co. v.Sieracki, 328 U. S. 85, 94 (1946), and soon eclipsed ordinarynegligence as the primary basis of recovery when a seafarerwas injured or killed. Miles, 498 U. S., at 25-26.6The disparity between the unseaworthiness doctrine'sstrict-l iability standard and negl igence-based statewrongful-death statutes figured prominently in our landmark Moragne decision. Petsonella Moragne, the widow ofa longshore worker killed in Florida's territorial waters,brought suit under Florida's wrongful-death and survivalstatutes, alleging both negligence and unseaworthiness.6 The Court extended the duty to provide a seaworthy ship, once owedonly to seamen, to longshore workers in Seas Shipping Co. v. Sieracki, 328U. S. 85 (1946). Congress effectively overruled this extension in its 1972amendments to the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act,33 U. S. C. $ 901 et seq. See $ 905(b). We have thus far declined to extendthe duty further. See Kermarec v. Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, 358 U. S. 625, 629 (1959) (unseaworthiness doctrine inapplicable toinvitee aboard vessel).516us1$15P 10-22-98 11:19:15 PAGES OPINPGT209Cite as: 516 U. S. 199 (1996)Opinion of the CourtThe District Court dismissed the claim for wrongful deathbased on unseaworthiness, citing this Court's decision in TheTungus v. Skovgaard, 358 U. S. 588 (1959). There, a sharplydivided Court held that "when admiralty adopts a State'sright of action for wrongful death, it must enforce the rightas an integrated whole, with whatever conditions and limitations the creating State has attached." Id., at 592. Thus,in wrongful-death actions involving fatalities in territorialwaters, state statutes provided the standard of liabilityas well as the remedial regime. Because the Florida Supreme Court had previously held that Florida's wrongful-death statute did not encompass unseaworthiness as a basisof liability, the Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal ofMoragne's unseaworthiness claim. See Moragne, 398 U. S.,at 377.The Court acknowledged in Moragne that The Tungus hadled to considerable uncertainty over the role state law shouldplay in remedying deaths in territorial waters, but concludedthat "the primary source of the confusion is not to be foundinThe Tungus, but in The Harrisburg." 398 U. S., at 378.Upon reexamining the soundness of The Harrisburg, we decided that its holding, "somewhat dubious even when ren-dered, is such an unjustifiable anomaly in the present maritime law that it should no longer be followed." 398 U. S., at378. Accordingly, the Court overruled The Harrisburg andheld that an action "lie[s] under general maritime law fordeath caused by violation of maritime duties." 398 U. S.,at 409.IVYamaha argues that Moragne--despite its focus on "maritime duties" owed to maritime workers--covers the waters,creating a uniform federal maritime remedy for all deathsoccurring in state territorial waters, and ousting all pre-viously available state remedies. In Yamaha's view, stateremedies can no longer supplement general maritime law516us1$15P 10-22-98 11:19:15 PAGES OPINPGT210 YAMAHA MOTOR CORP., U. S. A. v. CALHOUNOpinion of the Court(as they routinely did before Moragne), because Moragnelaunched a solitary federal scheme.7 Yamaha's reading ofMoragne is not without force; in several contexts, we haverecognized that vindication of maritime policies demandeduniform adherence to a federal rule of decision, with no leeway for variation or supplementation by state law. See,e. g., Kossick v. United Fruit Co., 365 U. S. 731, 742 (1961)(federal maritime rule validating oral contracts precludedapplication of state Statute of Frauds);Pope & Talbot, Inc.v. Hawn, 346 U. S. 406, 409 (1953) (admiralty's comparativenegligence rule barred application of state contributory negligence rule); Garrett v. Moore-McCormack Co., 317 U. S.239, 248-249 (1942) (federal maritime rule allocating burdenof proof displaced conflicting state rule).8 In addition, Ya7 If Moragne's wrongful-death action did not extend to nonseafarers likeNatalie, one could hardly argue that Moragne displaced the state-lawremedies the Calhouns seek. Lower courts have held that Moragne'swrongful-death action extends to nonseafarers. See, e. g., Sutton v.Earles, 26 F. 3d 903 (CA9 1994) (recreational boater); Wahlstrom v. Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd., 4 F. 3d 1084 (CA2 1993) (jet skier), cert.denied, 510 U. S. 1114 (1994). We assume, for purposes of this decision,the correctness of that position. Similarly, as in prior encounters, we assume without deciding that Moragne also provides a survival action. SeeMiles v. Apex Marine Corp., 498 U. S. 19, 34 (1990). The question weconfront is not what Moragne added to the remedial arsenal in maritimecases, but what, if anything, it removed from admiralty's stock.8 The federal cast of admiralty law, we have observed, means that "statelaw must yield to the needs of a uniform federal maritime law when thisCourt finds inroads on a harmonious system[,] [b]ut this limitation stillleaves the States a wide scope." Romero v. International Terminal Operating Co., 358 U. S. 354, 373 (1959). Our precedent does not preciselydelineate that scope. As we recently acknowledged, "[i]t would be idleto pretend that the line separating permissible from impermissible stateregulation is readily discernible in our admiralty jurisprudence." American Dredging Co. v. Miller, 510 U. S. 443, 452 (1994). We attempt nogrand synthesis or reconciliation of our precedent today, but confine ourinquiry to the modest question whether it was Moragne's design to terminate recourse to state remedies when nonseafarers meet death in territorial waters.516us1$15P 10-22-98 11:19:15 PAGES OPINPGT211Cite as: 516 U. S. 199 (1996)Opinion of the Courtmaha correctly points out that uniformity concerns informedour decision inMoragne.The uniformity concerns that prompted us to overrule TheHarrisburg, however, were of a different order than thoseinvoked by Yamaha. Moragne did not reexamine the soundness of The Harrisburg out of concern that state monetaryawards in maritime wrongful-death cases were excessive, orthat variations in the remedies afforded by the States threat-ened to interfere with the harmonious operation of maritimelaw. Variations of this sort had long been deemed compati-ble with federal maritime interests. SeeWestern Fuel, 257U. S., at 242. The uniformity concern that drove our decision in Moragne related, instead, to the availability of unseaworthiness as a basis of liability.By 1970, when Moragne was decided, claims premised onunseaworthiness had become "the principal vehicle for recovery" by seamen and other maritime workers injured orkilled in the course of their employment. Moragne, 398U. S., at 399. But with The Harrisburg in place, troublinganomalies had developed that many times precluded the survivors of maritime workers from recovering for deathscaused by an unseaworthy vessel. The Moragne Courtidentified three anomalies and concluded they could nolonger be tolerated.First, the Court noted that "within territorial waters,identical conduct violating federal law (here the furnishingof an unseaworthy vessel) produces liability if the victim ismerely injured, but frequently not if he is killed." 398 U. S.,at 395. This occurred because in nonfatal injury cases, statesubstantive liability standards were superseded by federalmaritime law, see Kermarec v. Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, 358 U. S. 625, 628 (1959); Pope & Talbot, 346U. S., at 409, which provided for maritime worker recoverybased on unseaworthiness. But if the same worker metdeath in the territorial waters of a State whose wrongfuldeath statute did not encompass unseaworthiness (as was the516us1$15P 10-22-98 11:19:15 PAGES OPINPGT212 YAMAHA MOTOR CORP., U. S. A. v. CALHOUNOpinion of the Courtcase in Moragne itself), the survivors could not proceedunder that generous standard of liability. See The Tungus,358 U. S., at 592-593.Second, we explained in Moragne that "identical breachesof the duty to provide a seaworthy ship, resulting in death,produce liability outside the three-mile limit . . . but notwithin the territorial waters of a State whose local statuteexcludes unseaworthiness claims." 398 U. S., at 395. Thisoccurred because survivors of a maritime worker killed onthe high seas could sue for wrongful death under the Deathon the High Seas Act (DOHSA), 46 U. S. C. App. $ 761 et seq.(1988 ed.), which encompasses unseaworthiness as a basis ofliability. Moragne, 398 U. S., at 395 (citing Kernan v. American Dredging Co., 355 U. S. 426, 430, n. 4 (1958)).Finally, we pointed out that "a true seaman [a member ofa ship's company] . . . is provided no remedy for death causedby unseaworthiness within territorial waters, while a longshoreman, to whom the duty of seaworthiness was extendedonly because he performs work traditionally done by seamen,does have such a remedy when allowed by a state statute."398 U. S., at 395-396. This anomaly stemmed from theCourt's rulings in Lindgren v. United States, 281 U. S. 38(1930), and Gillespie v. United States Steel Corp., 379 U. S.148 (1964), that the Jones Act, 46 U. S. C. App. $ 688 (1988ed.), which provides only a negligence-based claim for thewrongful death of seamen, precludes any state remedy, evenone accommodating unseaworthiness. As a result, at thetime Moragne was decided, the survivors of a longshoreworker killed in the territorial waters of a State whosewrongful-death statute incorporated unseaworthiness couldsue under that theory, but the survivors of a similarly situated seaman could not.99 As noted earlier, unseaworthiness recovery by longshore workers wasterminated by Congress in its 1972 amendments to the Longshore andHarbor Workers' Compensation Act, 33 U. S. C. $ 901 et seq. See $ 905(b).516us1$15P 10-22-98 11:19:15 PAGES OPINPGT213Cite as: 516 U. S. 199 (1996)Opinion of the CourtThe anomalies described in Moragne relate to ships andthe workers who serve them, and to a distinctly maritimesubstantive concept--the unseaworthiness doctrine. TheCourt surely meant to "assure uniform vindication of federalpolicies," 398 U. S., at 401, with respect to the matters itexamined. The law as it developed under The Harrisburghad forced on the States more than they could bear--thetask of "provid[ing] the sole remedy" in cases that did notinvolve "traditional common-law concepts," but "conceptspeculiar to maritime law." 398 U. S., at 401, n. 15 (internalquotation marks omitted). DiscardingThe Harrisburg anddeclaring a wrongful-death right of action under generalmaritime law, the Court concluded, would "remov[e] thetensions and discrepancies" occasioned by the need "to accommodate state remedial statutes to exclusively maritimesubstantive concepts." 398 U. S., at 401.10Moragne, in sum, centered on the extension of relief, noton the contraction of remedies. The decision recalled that" `it better becomes the humane and liberal character of proceedings in admiralty to give than to withhold the remedy,when not required to withhold it by established and inflexiblerules.' " Id., at 387 (quoting The Sea Gull, 21 F. Cas. 909,910 (No. 12,578) (CC Md. 1865) (Chase, C. J.)). The Courttied Petsonella Moragne's plea based on the unseaworthiness10 The Court might have simply overruled The Tungus, see supra, at209, thus permitting plaintiffs to rely on federal liability standards to obtain state wrongful-death remedies. The petitioner in Moragne, widowof a longshore worker, had urged that course when she sought certiorari.See Moragne v. States Marine Lines, Inc., 398 U. S. 375, 378, n. 1 (1970).But training Moragne solely on The Tungus would have left untouchedthe survivors of seamen, who remain blocked by the Jones Act from pursuing state wrongful-death claims--whether under a theory of negligence orunseaworthiness. See Gillespie v. United States Steel Corp., 379 U. S.148, 154-155 (1964). Thus, nothing short of a federal maritime right ofaction for wrongful death could have achieved uniform access by seafarersto the unseaworthiness doctrine, the Court's driving concern in Moragne.See 398 U. S., at 396, n. 12.516us1$15P 10-22-98 11:19:15 PAGES OPINPGT214 YAMAHA MOTOR CORP., U. S. A. v. CALHOUNOpinion of the Courtof the vessel to a federal right-of-action anchor,11 but not-ably left in place the negligence claim she had stated underFlorida's law. See 398 U. S., at 376-377.12Our understanding of Moragne accords with that of theThird Circuit, which Judge Becker set out as follows:"Moragne . . . showed no hostility to concurrent applica-tion of state wrongful-death statutes. Indeed, to readinto Moragne the idea that it was placing a ceiling onrecovery for wrongful death, rather than a floor, is somewhat ahistorical. The Moragne cause of action was inmany respects a gap-filling measure to ensure that seamen (and their survivors) would all be treated alike.The `humane and liberal' purpose underlying the generalmaritime remedy of Moragne was driven by the ideathat survivors of seamen killed in state territorial waters should not have been barred from recovery simplybecause the tort system of the particular state in whicha seaman died did not incorporate special maritime doc-trines. It is difficult to see how this purpose can betaken as an intent to preclude the operation of state lawsthat do supply a remedy." 40 F. 3d, at 641-642 (citation omitted).We have reasoned similarly in Sun Ship, Inc. v. Pennsyl-vania, 447 U. S. 715 (1980), where we held that a State mayapply its workers' compensation scheme to land-based inju-ries that fall within the compass of the Longshore and Har11 While unseaworthiness was the doctrine immediately at stake inMoragne, the right of action, as stated in the Court's opinion, is "for deathcaused by violation of maritime duties." Id., at 409. See East RiverS. S. Corp. v. Transamerica Delaval Inc., 476 U. S. 858, 865 (1986) (maritime law incorporates strict product liability); Kermarec, 358 U. S., at 630(negligence).

C. $ 1292(b) certification directed to the District Court's order dismissing the unseaworthiness claim. See 398 U. S., at 376.516US1 Unit: $U15 [05-25-00 06:59:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN215Cite as: 516 U.

S., at 724 (a State's remedial scheme mightbe "more generous than federal law" but nevertheless couldapply because Congress indicated no concern "about a disparity between adequate federal benefits and superior statebenefits") (emphasis in original).13When Congress has prescribed a comprehensive tort recovery regime to be uniformly applied, there is, we have generally recognized, no cause for enlargement of the damagesstatutorily provided. See Miles, 498 U. S., at 30-36 (JonesAct, rather than general maritime law, determines damagesrecoverable in action for wrongful death of seamen); Offshore Logistics, Inc. v. Tallentire, 477 U. S. 207, 232 (1986)(DOHSA, which limits damages to pecuniary losses, may notbe supplemented by nonpecuniary damages under a statewrongful-death statute); Mobil Oil Corp. v. Higginbotham,436 U. S. 618, 624-625 (1978) (DOHSA precludes damages forloss of society under general maritime law). But Congresshas not prescribed remedies for the wrongful deaths of nonseafarers in territorial waters. See Miles, 498 U. S., at 31.There is, however, a relevant congressional disposition. Section 7 of DOHSA states: "The provisions of any State statutegiving or regulating rights of action or remedies for death13 Federal maritime law has long accommodated the States' interest inregulating maritime affairs within their territorial waters. See, e. g., Justv. Chambers, 312 U. S. 383, 390 (1941) ("maritime law [is] not a completeand perfect system"; "a considerable body of municipal law . . . underlies. . . its administration"). States have thus traditionally contributed to theprovision of environmental and safety standards for maritime activities.See, e. g., Askew v. American Waterways Operators, Inc., 411 U. S. 325(1973) (oil pollution); Huron Portland Cement Co. v. Detroit, 362 U. S. 440(1960) (air pollution); Kelly v. Washington ex rel. Foss Co., 302 U. S. 1(1937) (safety inspection); Cooley v. Board of Wardens of Port of Philadelphia ex rel. Soc. for Relief of Distressed Pilots, 12 How. 299 (1852) (pilotage regulation). Permissible state regulation, we have recognized, mustbe consistent with federal maritime principles and policies. See Romero,358 U.
