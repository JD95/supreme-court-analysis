The State of Texas charged petitioner Joe Mario Trevinofor the murder and rape of Blanche Miller, a capital offense.On February 1, 1984, before jury selection, petitioner filed a"Motion to Prohibit the State from Using Peremptory Chal503us2$60z 11-14-95 20:17:08 PAGES OPINPGT563Cite as: 503 U. S. 562 (1992)Per Curiamlenges to Strike Members of a Cognizable Group." Themotion recited:"The Accused requests of the Court that the State ofTexas be prohibited from its use of peremptory challenges to strike prospective jurors merely based on thefact of race. The prosecution, the State of Texas, historically and habitually uses its peremptory challengesto strike black people and other minorities who are otherwise qualified. These peremptory challenges are ex-ercised by the State of Texas to strike prospective blackjurors in its effort to produce an ethnically pure, allwhite, jury. This common use of the State's peremp-tory challenge in a criminal trial deprives the Accusedof due process and a fair trial. This practice deprivesthe Accused of a jury representing a fair cross-sectionof the community in violation of the Sixth Amendmentto the United States Constitution."A hearing is requested on this Motion." 1A Record280.The trial court delayed ruling on the motion until the voirdire. During the course of voir dire, the prosecution exercised its peremptory challenges to excuse the only threeblack members of the venire. After each of these peremptory strikes, petitioner, who is Hispanic, renewed his motion,asking that the prosecution state its reasons for striking thejurors. The first time petitioner renewed the motion, thecourt stated: "I know of no requirement yet for either partyto announce his reasons for exercising a preemptory[sic]challenge. Can you cite me some law on that?" 11 Record356. In response, petitioner's counsel cited McCray v. Abrams, 576 F. Supp. 1244 (EDNY), aff 'd in part and rev'd inpart, 750 F. 2d 1113 (CA2 1984). He went on to note thatwhen we denied the petition for a writ of certiorari in McCray v. New York, 461 U. S. 961 (1983), five Justices expressed the view that Swain v. Alabama, 380 U. S. 202503us2$60z 11-14-95 20:17:08 PAGES OPINPGT564 TREVINO v. TEXASPer Curiam(1965), ought to be reexamined. 11 Record 356. The trialcourt denied petitioner's motion, and denied it again aftertwo more black venire members were excluded.The all-white jury returned a verdict of guilty and after asentencing hearing returned affirmative answers to the twospecial questions posed by the court. See Jurek v. Texas,428 U. S. 262, 267-269 (1976) ( joint opinion of Stewart,Powell, and Stevens, JJ.). As required under such circumstances, see ibid., the trial court sentenced petitioner todeath. Petitioner appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas, filing his brief on December 19, 1985. Thisis the cause now before us. He cited 24 errors in the guiltand punishment phases of the trial court proceedings. Theonly one of concern now is the prosecutor's use of peremptory challenges based on race.Petitioner contended in the Court of Criminal Appealsthat the prosecution's race based use of challenges violatedhis "rights to due process of law and to an impartial juryfairly drawn from a representative cross section of the community." Brief for Appellant in No. 69337, p. 11. He foundthese rights in "the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments tothe United States Constitution," as well as provisions of theTexas Constitution. Ibid. He asserted he was renewingthe objections pressed at trial. Ibid. He acknowledgedthat under Swain v. Alabama, the use of peremptory challenges to discriminate in a single case would not be an equalprotection violation but noted that in Batson v. Kentucky,cert. granted, 471 U. S. 1052 (1985), we would reconsider thequestion under the Sixth Amendment. When his brief wasfiled, we had heard oral argument in Batson but had notannounced our decision. Petitioner urged that even if Batson did not alter the requirement of alleging an overallscheme of discrimination, the Court of Criminal Appealsshould prohibit peremptory challenges based on race as amatter of state law.503us2$60z 11-14-95 20:17:08 PAGES OPINPGT565Cite as: 503 U. S. 562 (1992)Per CuriamOn April 30, 1986, not long after petitioner filed his briefin the Court of Criminal Appeals, our decision inBatsoncame down. Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79. The caseannounced the now familiar rule that when a defendantmakes a prima facie showing that the State has exercised itsperemptory challenges to exclude members of the defend-ant's racial group, the State bears the burden of coming forward with a race neutral justification. Just over a monthafterBatson was decided, the State filed its brief in theCourt of Criminal Appeals. The State argued Batson couldnot avail petitioner because he is not a member of the samerace as the excluded jurors. According to the State, petitioner's claim could not be considered an equal protectionclaim but was instead a claim that he was entitled to a jurycomposed of a "fair cross-section" of the community. Brieffor Appellee in No. 69337, pp. 15-17. In drawing this distinction, the State relied on the view that a criminal defendant does not state an equal protection claim unless he allegesthat the excluded jurors are members of the same protectedclass as he. We rejected this view last Term in Powers v.Ohio, 499 U. S. 400 (1991).The Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas, sitting en banc,affirmed petitioner's conviction and sentence on June 12,1991, and denied petitioner's application for rehearing onSeptember 18, 1991. The opinion of the Court of CriminalAppeals does not set forth the reason for the delay of overfive years between the submission of briefs and the resolution of the appeal. With respect to the peremptory challenge question, the court stated that the argument was foreclosed by Holland v. Illinois, 493 U. S. 474 (1990), in whichwe held that the Sixth Amendment does not prohibit theprosecution from exercising its peremptory challenges to exclude potential jurors based on race. 815 S. W. 2d 592, 598.In a footnote, the Court of Criminal Appeals stated that thearguments in petitioner's brief did not amount to reliance onthe Equal Protection Clause. Id., at 598, n. 3. The court's503us2$60z 11-14-95 20:17:08 PAGES OPINPGT566 TREVINO v. TEXASPer Curiamopinion cited neither Powers nor Ford v. Georgia, 498 U. S.411, which we decided on February 19, 1991. We nowgrant certiorari. IIIn Ford v. Georgia, we addressed what steps a defendantin a criminal case was required to take to preserve an equalprotection objection to the State's race based use of peremp-tory challenges during the preBatson era. Here we con-sider whether petitioner took those steps.In Ford, the petitioner filed a pretrial "Motion to RestrictRacial Use of Peremptory Challenges," 498 U. S., at 413,wording which is in all material respects parallel to the pres-ent petitioner's pretrial "Motion to Prohibit the State fromUsing Peremptory Challenges to Strike Members of a Cogni-zable Group." The ultimate issue inFord concerned the va-lidity of a state procedural rule, but before reaching it weruled on a preliminary issue, and that ruling is dispositivehere. We stated:"The threshold issues are whether and, if so, whenpetitioner presented the trial court with a cognizableBatson claim that the State's exercise of its peremptorychallenges rested on the impermissible ground of racein violation of the Equal Protection Clause of theFourteenth Amendment. We think petitioner must betreated as having raised such a claim, although he cer-tainly failed to do it with the clarity that appropriatecitations would have promoted. The pretrial motionmade no mention of the Equal Protection Clause, andthe later motion for a new trial cited the Sixth Amend-ment, not the Fourteenth."Id., at 418.Despite the inartfulness of the Ford petitioner's assertion ofhis rights, we held he had presented his claim to the trialcourt. We noted that his reference in his motion to exclu-sion of black jurors " `over a long period of time,' " and hisargument to the same effect "could reasonably have been503us2$60z 11-14-95 20:17:08 PAGES OPINPGT567Cite as: 503 U. S. 562 (1992)Per Curiamintended and interpreted to raise a claim under the EqualProtection Clause on the evidentiary theory articulated inBatson's antecedent, Swain v. Alabama." Id., at 419. Weplaced this interpretation on the reference to history becausethe standard of proof for an equal protection violation underSwain required a showing of racial exclusion in "case aftercase." 380 U. S., at 223.In the matter now before us petitioner also relied on aclaim of a historical pattern of discriminatory use of peremptory challenges. That alone would have been sufficientunderFord to place the equal protection claim before thetrial court. Of course, petitioner did more. He made an express reference to Swain in his argument to the trial court.11 Record 356. In fact, petitioner argued that we wouldmodify Swain's burden of proof and that the Texas courtsshould anticipate our decision. We decide that petitionerpresented his equal protection claim to the trial court.We determine further that petitioner preserved his equalprotection claim before the Court of Criminal Appeals. Hisargument caption made an express reference to the Fourteenth Amendment, and the issue presented for review wasthe very one that he had raised before the trial court.The State in its brief to the Court of Criminal Appealsrecognized that petitioner's argument contained an equalprotection claim, albeit one which the State believed to lackmerit. The State did not argue that petitioner was not making an equal protection claim but that petitioner's equal protection claim had no legal support. Given our later holdingin Powers v. Ohio, supra, the State's contention is incorrect.We cannot ignore the fact that were we to hold petitionerhad forfeited his equal protection claim by failing to stateit with sufficient precision, we would be applying a stricterstandard than applied in Batson itself. There petitioner hadconceded in the state courts that Swain foreclosed a directequal protection claim, and he based his argument on theSixth Amendment and a provision of the Kentucky Constitu503us2$60z 11-14-95 20:17:08 PAGES OPINPGT568 TREVINO v. TEXASPer Curiamtion. Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S., at 83. Yet we treatedhis allegation of a violation of the Fourteenth Amendmentas sufficient to present the question. Id., at 84-85, n. 4. Be-cause petitioner's case is here on direct review, he is entitledto the rule we announced in Batson. Compare Griffith v.Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314 (1987) (giving retroactive applicationto Batson for cases pending on direct review or not yet finalwhen Batson was decided), with Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S.288, 296 (1989) (denying similar application for cases on collateral review).The motion of petitioner for leave to proceed in formapauperis is granted. The petition for a writ of certiorari isgranted, the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeals ofTexas is reversed, and the case is remanded for further pro-ceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
