Antonelli is al-lowed until November 2, 1999, within which to pay the docketing fees required by Rule 38 and to submit his petitions incompliance with this Court's Rule 33.1. We also direct theClerk not to accept any further petitions for certiorari orpetitions for extraordinary writs from Antonelli in noncriminal matters unless he first pays the docketing fee requiredby Rule 38 and submits his petitions in compliance withRule 33.1.Antonelli has abused this Court's certiorari and extraordinary writ processes. On June 21, 1993, and November 29,1993, we invoked Rule 39.8 to deny Antonelliin forma pau-peris status with respect to two petitions for certiorari.See Antonelli v. Illinois, 509 U.

CARIDINEStevens, J., dissenting39.8 denials, Antonelli has filed 17 petitions for certiorari, allof which were also frivolous and denied without recordeddissent. The instant 2 petitions for certiorari thus bringAntonelli's total number of frivolous filings to 57.We enter the order barring prospective filings for the rea-sons discussed in Martin v. District of Columbia Court ofAppeals, 506 U. S. 1 (1992) (per curiam). Antonelli's abuseof the writ of certiorari and of the extraordinary writs hasbeen in noncriminal cases, and we limit our sanction accord-ingly. The order therefore will not prevent Antonelli frompetitioning to challenge criminal sanctions which might beimposed on him. The order will, however, allow this Courtto devote its limited resources to the claims of petitionerswho have not abused our processes.
