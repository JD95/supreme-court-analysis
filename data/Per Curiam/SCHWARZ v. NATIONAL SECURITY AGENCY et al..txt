Pro se petitioner Schwarz seeks leave to proceed in formapauperis under Rule 39 of this Court. We deny this requestas frivolous pursuant to Rule 39.8. Schwarz is allowed untilMarch 29, 1999, within which to pay the docketing fee required by Rule 38 and to submit her petitions in compliancewith this Court's Rule 33.1. We also direct the Clerk not toaccept any further petitions for certiorari from Schwarz innoncriminal matters unless she pays the docketing fee required by Rule 38 and submits her petition in compliancewith Rule 33.1.Schwarz has repeatedly abused this Court's certiorariprocess. On December 14, 1998, we invoked Rule 39.8 todeny Schwarz in forma pauperis status with respect to fourpetitions for certiorari. See Schwarz v. Federal Bureau ofInvestigation, 525 U. S. 1053; Schwarz v. National Instituteof Corrections, 525 U. S. 1053; Schwarz v. United States Parole Comm'n, 525 U. S. 1053; Schwarz v. National Archivesand Records Administration, 525 U. S. 1053. Before that*Together with No. 98-7782, Schwarz v. Executive Office of the President et al., also on motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis.526US1 Unit: $U34 [09-19-99 17:43:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN123Cite as: 526 U. S. 122 (1999)Stevens, J., dissentingtime, Schwarz had filed 29 petitions for certiorari, all ofwhich were both patently frivolous and had been deniedwithout recorded dissent. The instant petitions for certio-rari thus constitute Schwarz's 34th and 35th frivolous filingswith this Court.We enter the order barring prospective filings for the reasons discussed in Martin v. District of Columbia Court ofAppeals, 506 U. S. 1 (1992) (per curiam). Schwarz's abuseof the writ of certiorari has been in noncriminal cases, andwe limit our sanction accordingly. The order therefore willnot prevent Schwarz from petitioning to challenge criminalsanctions which might be imposed on her. Similarly, be-cause Schwarz has not abused this Court's extraordinarywrits procedures, the order will not prevent her from filingnonfrivolous petitions for extraordinary writs. The orderwill, however, allow this Court to devote its limited re-sources to the claims of petitioners who have not abused ourcertiorari process.
