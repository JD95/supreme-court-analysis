Pro se petitioner Judd seeks leave to proceed in formapauperis under Rule 39 of this Court. We deny this requestas frivolous pursuant to Rule 39.8. Judd is allowed untilNovember 2, 1999, within which to pay the docketing feesrequired by Rule 38 and to submit his petition in compliancewith this Court's Rule 33.1. We also direct the Clerk not toaccept any further petitions for certiorari or petitions forextraordinary writs from Judd in noncriminal matters unlesshe first pays the docketing fee required by Rule 38 and submits his petitions in compliance with Rule 33.1.Judd has abused this Court's certiorari and extraordinarywrit processes. On May 30, 1995, we invoked Rule 39.8 todeny Judd in forma pauperis status with respect to a petition for an extraordinary writ. See In re Judd, 515 U. S.1101. Prior to this Rule 39.8 denial, Judd had filed six petitions for certiorari, all of which were both frivolous and hadbeen denied without recorded dissent. Since the Rule 39.8denial, Judd has filed four petitions for certiorari, all of whichwere also frivolous and denied without recorded dissent.The instant petition for certiorari thus brings Judd's totalnumber of frivolous filings to 12.528US1 Unit: $$U3 [06-14-01 18:14:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN6 JUDD v. UNITED STATES DIST. COURT FORWESTERN DIST. OF TEX.Stevens, J., dissentingWe enter the order barring prospective filings for the rea-sons discussed in Martin v. District of Columbia Court ofAppeals, 506 U. S. 1 (1992) (per curiam). Judd's abuse ofthe writ of certiorari and of the extraordinary writs has beenin noncriminal cases, and we limit our sanction accordingly.The order therefore will not prevent Judd from petitioningto challenge criminal sanctions which might be imposed onhim. The order will, however, allow this Court to devoteits limited resources to the claims of petitioners who havenot abused our processes.
