DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA COURT OF APPEALSPer Curiamlowed until November 23, 1992, within which to pay thedocketing fees required by Rule 38 and to submit his petitions in compliance with this Court's Rule 33. We also direct the Clerk not to accept any further petitions for certiorari from Martin in noncriminal matters unless he pays thedocketing fee required by Rule 38 and submits his petitionin compliance with Rule 33.Martin is a notorious abuser of this Court's certiorari process. We first invoked Rule 39.8 to deny Martin in formapauperis status last November. See Zatko v. California,502 U. S. 16 (1991) (per curiam). At that time, we notedthat Martin had filed 45 petitions in the past 10 years, and15 in the preceding 2 years alone. Although Martin wasgranted in forma pauperis status to file these petitions, allof these petitions were denied without recorded dissent. Ininvoking Rule 39.8, we observed that Martin is "unique--notmerely among those who seek to file in forma pauperis, butalso among those who have paid the required filing fees--because [he has] repeatedly made totally frivolous demandson the Court's limited resources." Id., at 18. Unfortunately, Martin has continued in his accustomed ways.Since we first denied him in forma pauperis status lastyear, he has filed nine petitions for certiorari with this Court.We denied Martin leave to proceed in forma pauperis underRule 39.8 of this Court with respect to four of these petitions,1 and denied the remaining five petitions outright.2Two additional petitions for certiorari are before us today,bringing the total number of petitions Martin has filed in the1 Martin v.

With the arguable exception of one of thesepetitions, see Martin v. Knox, 502 U. S. 999 (1991) (Stevens,J., joined by Blackmun, J., respecting denial of certiorari),all of Martin's filings, including those before us today, havebeen demonstrably frivolous.In Zatko, we warned that "[f]uture similar filings from[Martin] will merit additional measures." 502 U. S., at 18.As we have recognized, "[e]very paper filed with the Clerkof this Court, no matter how repetitious or frivolous, requires some portion of the institution's limited resources. Apart of the Court's responsibility is to see that these resources are allocated in a way that promotes the interestsof justice." In re McDonald, 489 U. S. 180, 184 (1989) (percuriam). Consideration of Martin's repetitious and frivolous petitions for certiorari does not promote this end.We have entered orders similar to the present one on twoprevious occasions to prevent pro se petitioners from filingrepetitious and frivolous requests for extraordinary relief.See In re Sindram, 498 U. S. 177 (1991) (per curiam); In reMcDonald, supra. Although this case does not involveabuse of an extraordinary writ, but rather the writ of certiorari, Martin's pattern of abuse has had a similarly deleteriouseffect on this Court's "fair allocation of judicial resources."See In re Sindram, supra, at 180. As a result, the sameconcerns which led us to enter the orders barring prospective filings in Sindram and McDonald require such actionhere.We regret the necessity of taking this step, but Martin'srefusal to heed our earlier warning leaves us no choice. Hisabuse of the writ of certiorari has been in noncriminal cases,and so we limit our sanction accordingly. The order willtherefore not prevent Martin from petitioning to challengecriminal sanctions which might be imposed on him. But itwill free this Court's limited resources to consider the claims506us1$$1z 09-18-95 11:12:57 PAGES OPINPGT4 MARTIN v.
