Pro se petitioner Robert Attwood requests leave to proceed in forma pauperis under Rule 39 of this Court. Wedeny this request pursuant to Rule 39.8. Attwood is allowed until February 12, 1996, within which to pay the docketing fee required by Rule 38 and to submit his petition incompliance with this Court's Rule 33. We also direct theClerk not to accept any further petitions for certiorari fromAttwood in noncriminal matters unless he pays the docketingfee required by Rule 38 and submits his petition in compliance with Rule 33.Attwood has abused this Court's certiorari process. InNovember 1995, we twice invoked Rule 39.8 to deny Attwoodin forma pauperis status. See Attwood v. Smith and Attwood v. Palm Beach Post, post, p. 963. At that time, Attwood had filed seven petitions in this Court during the prior516us2$21H 10-22-98 12:33:06 PAGES OPINPGT298 ATTWOOD v. SINGLETARYStevens, J., dissentingyear, and he has filed two since. All were patently frivolousand were denied without recorded dissent.We enter the order barring prospective filings for the rea-sons discussed in Martin v. District of Columbia Court ofAppeals, 506 U. S. 1 (1992). Attwood's abuse of the writ ofcertiorari has been in noncriminal cases, and so we limit oursanction accordingly. The order will not prevent Attwoodfrom petitioning to challenge criminal sanctions which mightbe imposed against him. The order will, however, allow thisCourt to devote its limited resources to the claims of petitioners who have not abused our certiorari process.
