Pro se petitioner Whitfield seeks leave to proceed informa pauperis under Rule 39 of this Court. We deny thisrequest as frivolous pursuant to Rule 39.8. Whitfield isallowed until July 15, 1999, within which to pay the docketing fee required by Rule 38 and to submit his petition incompliance with this Court's Rule 33.1. We also direct theClerk not to accept any further petitions for certiorari orpetitions for extraordinary writs from Whitfield in noncrimi-nal matters unless he first pays the docketing fee requiredby Rule 38 and submits his petitions in compliance withRule 33.1.Whitfield has repeatedly abused this Court's certiorari andextraordinary writ processes. On March 30, 1998, we invoked Rule 39.8 to deny Whitfield in forma pauperis statuswith respect to a petition for certiorari. SeeWhitfield v.Johnson, 523 U. S. 1044. At that time, Whitfield had filedthree petitions for certiorari and three petitions for extraor*Together with Whitfield v. Texas (see this Court's Rule 12.4) and Whitfield v. Texas (see this Court's Rule 12.4), also on motions for leave toproceed in forma pauperis.527US2 Unit: $U93 [05-03-01 15:57:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN886 WHITFIELD v. TEXASStevens, J., dissentingdinary writs, all of which were both patently frivolous andhad been denied without recorded dissent. He thereafterfiled another patently frivolous petition for certiorari, whichwe denied. The instant petition for certiorari thus bringsWhitfield's total number of frivolous filings to nine.We enter the order barring prospective filings for thereasons discussed in Martin v. District of Columbia Courtof Appeals, 506 U. S. 1 (1992) (per curiam). Whitfield's abuseof the writ of certiorari and of the extraordinary writs hasbeen in noncriminal cases, and we limit our sanction accord-ingly. The order therefore will not prevent Whitfield frompetitioning to challenge criminal sanctions which might beimposed on him. The order will, however, allow this Courtto devote its limited resources to the claims of petitionerswho have not abused our processes.
