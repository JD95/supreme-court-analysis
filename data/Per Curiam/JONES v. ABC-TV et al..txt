Pro se petitioner Sylvester Jones requests leave to pro-ceedin forma pauperis under Rule 39 of this Court. Wedeny this request pursuant to Rule 39.8. Jones is alloweduntil March 18, 1996, within which to pay the docketing feerequired by Rule 38 and to submit his petition in compliancewith this Court's Rule 33.1. We also direct the Clerk notto accept any further petitions for certiorari from Jones innoncriminal matters unless he pays the docketing fee re-quired by Rule 38 and submits his petition in compliancewith Rule 33.1.Jones has abused this Court's certiorari process. In October 1992, we first invoked Rule 39.8 to deny Jones in formapauperis status in two petitions for certiorari. See Jones v.Wright, 506 U. S. 810; In re Jones, 506 U. S. 810. At thattime, Jones had filed over 25 petitions in this Court, all ofwhich were patently frivolous and had been denied without516us2$25h 10-22-98 13:00:19 PAGES OPINPGT364 JONES v. ABC-TVStevens, J., dissentingrecorded dissent. And since October 1992, we have invokedRule 39.8 five times to deny Jones in forma pauperis status.See Jones v. Schulze, 513 U. S. 805 (1994); In re Jones, 510U. S. 963 (1993); Jones v. Jackson, 510 U. S. 808 (1993); Jonesv. Suter, 508 U. S. 949 (1993); Jones v. Jackson, 506 U. S. 1047(1993). Currently, Jones has at least two more petitions forcertiorari pending.We enter the order barring prospective filings for the reasons discussed in Martin v. District of Columbia Court ofAppeals, 506 U. S. 1 (1992). Jones' abuse of the writ of cer-tiorari has been in noncriminal cases and so we limit oursanction accordingly. The order will not prevent Jones frompetitioning to challenge criminal sanctions which might beimposed against him. The order will, however, allow thisCourt to devote its limited resources to the claims of petitioners who have not abused our certiorari process.
