Effective January 1, 1988, Florida exempted newspapers,but not magazines, from its sales tax. See Fla. Stat.$$ 212.08(7)(w), 212.05(1)(i) (Supp. 1988). In 1990, the Florida Supreme Court found this classification invalid under theFirst Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.SeeDepartment of Revenue v. Magazine Publishers ofAmerica, Inc., 565 So. 2d 1304 (1990), vacated and remanded,522US2$24L 11-27-98 20:08:30 PAGES OPINPGT443Cite as: 522 U. S. 442 (1998)Per CuriamMiami Herald Publishing Co. v. Dept. of Revenue, 499 U. S.972 (1991), reaff 'd, 604 So. 2d 459 (1992). In the wake of thisruling, Newsweek, a magazine, filed a claim for a refund ofsales taxes it had paid between 1988 and 1990. See Fla.Stat. $ 215.26(1) (Supp. 1998) ("The Comptroller of the statemay refund . . . any moneys paid into the State Treasury").When the Department of Revenue denied the refund,Newsweek filed suit, alleging the State's failure to accord itretroactive relief violated its due process rights underMcKesson Corp. v. Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, Fla. Dept. of Business Regulation, 496 U. S. 18 (1990).The Florida trial court granted summary judgment againstNewsweek, and the District Court of Appeal affirmed. Although acknowledging McKesson's requirement of "meaningful backward-looking relief " when a taxpayer is forcedto pay a tax before having an opportunity to establish itsunconstitutionality, the District Court of Appeal held: "McKesson is distinguishable because that holding was expresslypredicated upon the fact that the taxpayer had no meaningful predeprivation remedy." 689 So. 2d 361, 363 (1997).The court interpreted Florida law to permit prepayment taxchallenges by filing an action and paying the contestedamount into the court registry, posting a bond, or obtaininga court order approving an alternative arrangement. Seeid., at 363-364 (citing Fla. Stat. $ 72.011 (1987)). The courtconcluded Newsweek was afforded due process because itcould have pursued this prepayment remedy without suffering onerous penalties. See 689 So. 2d, at 364.The District Court of Appeal's decision failed to considerour decision in Reich v. Collins, 513 U. S. 106 (1994). There,the Georgia Supreme Court had rejected a taxpayer's refundclaim filed pursuant to a general refund statute, dismissingany due process concerns because a predeprivation remedywas available. See id., at 110. While assuming the constitutional adequacy of Georgia's predeprivation procedures,we nonetheless reversed because "no reasonable taxpayer522US2$24L 11-27-98 20:08:30 PAGES OPINPGT444 NEWSWEEK, INC. v. FLORIDA DEPT. OF REVENUEPer Curiamwould have thought that [the predeprivation procedures]represented, in light of the apparent applicability of therefund statute, the exclusive remedy for unlawful taxes."Id., at 111 (emphasis deleted). Until the Georgia SupremeCourt's ruling, the taxpayer had no way of knowing fromeither the statutory language or case law that he could notpursue a postpayment refund and was relegated to a predeprivation remedy. See id., at 111-112. We emphasized aState "has the flexibility to maintain an exclusively predeprivation remedial scheme, so long as that scheme is `clear andcertain.' "Id., at 110-111. But a State may not "bait andswitch" by "hold[ing] out what plainly appears to be a `clearand certain' postdeprivation remedy and then declare, onlyafter the disputed taxes have been paid, that no such remedyexists." Id., at 111, 108.Under Florida law, there was a longstanding practice ofpermitting taxpayers to seek refunds under $ 215.26 fortaxes paid under an unconstitutional statute. See, e. g.,State ex rel. Hardaway Contracting Co. v. Lee, 155 Fla. 724,21 So. 2d 211 (1945). At Florida's urging, federal courtshave dismissed taxpayer challenges, including constitutionalchallenges, because $ 215.26 appeared to provide an adequatepostpayment remedy for refunds. See Tax Injunction Act,28 U. S. C. $ 1341 ("The district courts shall not enjoin . . .any tax under State law where a plain, speedy and efficientremedy may be had in the courts of such State"); see, e. g.,Osceola v. Florida Dept. of Revenue, 893 F. 2d 1231, 1233(CA11 1990); Rendon v. State of Fla., 930 F. Supp. 601 (SDFla. 1996). This Court, too, has interpreted Florida law toprovide a postpayment remedy. See McKesson, supra, at24, n. 4 ("It appears . . . Florida law does not require a taxpayer to pay under protest in order to preserve the right tochallenge a remittance in a postpayment refund action").The State does not dispute this settled understanding. Theeffect of the District Court of Appeal's decision below, however, was to cut off Newsweek's recourse to $ 215.26. While522US2$24L 11-27-98 20:08:30 PAGES OPINPGT445Cite as: 522 U. S. 442 (1998)Per CuriamFlorida may be free to require taxpayers to litigate first andpay later, due process prevents it from applying this requirement to taxpayers, like Newsweek, who reasonably relied onthe apparent availability of a postpayment refund when paying the tax.Newsweek is entitled to a clear and certain remedy andthus it can use the refund procedures to adjudicate the mer-its of its claim. We grant the petition for a writ of certiorari, vacate the judgment, and remand the case for proceed-ings not inconsistent with this opinion.
