Petitioner, William Fiore, was convicted of violating aPennsylvania statute prohibiting the operation of a hazardous waste facility without a permit. After Fiore's convic-tion became final, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court interpreted the statute for the first time, and made clear thatFiore's conduct was not within its scope. However, thePennsylvania courts refused to grant Fiore collateral relief.We granted certiorari in part to decide when, or whether,the Federal Due Process Clause requires a State to apply anew interpretation of a state criminal statute retroactivelyto cases on collateral review.In order to determine if that question was in fact presented, we asked the Pennsylvania Supreme Court whetherits decision interpreting the statute not to apply to conductlike Fiore's was a new interpretation, or whether it was, in-stead, a correct statement of the law when Fiore's convictionbecame final. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court, respond-ing to our certified question, has now made clear that retroactivity is not at issue. At the same time, that court's inter-pretation of its statute makes clear that Fiore did not violatethe statute. We consequently find that his conviction is notconsistent with the demands of the Federal Due ProcessClause. See Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307, 316 (1979).IThis case, previously described in greater detail in ouropinion certifying the state-law question to the PennsylvaniaSupreme Court, 528 U. S. 23 (1999), arises out of WilliamFiore's conviction under a Pennsylvania statute that prohibits "operat[ing] a hazardous waste" facility without a "per531US1 Unit: $U13 [04-13-02 15:20:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN227Cite as: 531 U. S. 225 (2001)Per Curiammit." Pa. Stat. Ann., Tit. 35, $ 6018.401(a) (Purdon 1993);seeCommonwealth v. Fiore, CC No. 8508740 (Ct. CommonPleas, Allegheny Cty., Pa., Jan. 19, 1988), App. 6. The Com-monwealth conceded that Fiore in fact had a permit, butargued that Fiore had deviated so dramatically from thepermit's terms that he nonetheless had violated the statute.And the Commonwealth's lower courts agreed. See id., at43-44; Commonwealth v. Fiore, 391 Pa. Super. 634, 563 A. 2d189 (1989) (affirming Fiore's conviction on the trial court'sreasoning).The Pennsylvania Supreme Court declined to reviewFiore's case, Commonwealth v. Fiore, 525 Pa. 577, 575 A. 2d109 (1990), and his conviction became final. Thereafter, thePennsylvania Supreme Court agreed to review the conviction of Fiore's co-defendant, David Scarpone, convicted of thesame crime at the same time. The Supreme Court reversedScarpone's conviction on the ground that the statute meantwhat it said: The statute made it unlawful to operate a facility without a permit; one who deviated from his permit'sterms was not a person without a permit; hence, a personwho deviated from his permit's terms did not violate thestatute. Commonwealth v. Scarpone, 535 Pa. 273, 279, 634A. 2d 1109, 1112 (1993) (describing the Commonwealth's interpretation as "a bald fiction we cannot endorse").Fiore, unsuccessful in his subsequent state-court attemptsto have his own conviction set aside, see Commonwealth v.Fiore, 445 Pa. Super. 401, 665 A. 2d 1185 (1995), appeal denied, Commonwealth v. Fiore, 544 Pa. 623, 675 A. 2d 1243(1996), brought a federal habeas corpus action. The DistrictCourt granted the writ, but the Court of Appeals for theThird Circuit reversed. 149 F. 3d 221 (1998). The Court ofAppeals believed that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, inScarpone's case, had announced a new rule of law, inapplicable to Fiore's already final conviction. Id., at 227. And, theCourt of Appeals said, "state courts are under no [federal]constitutional obligation to apply their decisions retroac531US1 Unit: $U13 [04-13-02 15:20:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN228 FIORE v. WHITEPer Curiamtively." Id., at 222. We granted certiorari to determinewhether Fiore's conviction was inconsistent with the DueProcess Clause. 526 U. S. 1038 (1999).IIBecause we were uncertain whether the PennsylvaniaSupreme Court's decision in Scarpone's case represented achange in the law of Pennsylvania, we certified the followingquestion to that court:"Does the interpretation of Pa. Stat. Ann., Tit. 35,$ 6018.401(a) (Purdon 1993), set forth inCommonwealthv. Scarpone, 535 Pa. 273, 279, 634 A. 2d 1109, 1112 (1993),state the correct interpretation of the law of Pennsylva-nia at the date Fiore's conviction became final?" 528U. S., at 29.We received the following reply:"Scarpone did not announce a new rule of law. Our rul-ing merely clarified the plain language of the statute. . . .Our interpretation of [$ 6018.401(a)] in Scarpone fur-nishes the proper statement of law at the date Fiore'sconviction became final." Fiore v. White, 562 Pa. 634,646, 757 A. 2d 842, 848-849 (2000) (citation omitted).The Pennsylvania Supreme Court's reply specifies that theinterpretation of $ 6018.401(a) set out in Scarpone "merelyclarified" the statute and was the law of Pennsylvania--asproperly interpreted--at the time of Fiore's conviction. Because Scarpone was not new law, this case presents no issueof retroactivity. Rather, the question is simply whetherPennsylvania can, consistently with the Federal Due ProcessClause, convict Fiore for conduct that its criminal statute, asproperly interpreted, does not prohibit.This Court's precedents make clear that Fiore's convictionand continued incarceration on this charge violate due proc-ess. We have held that the Due Process Clause of the Four531US1 Unit: $U13 [04-13-02 15:20:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN229Cite as: 531 U. S. 225 (2001)Per Curiamteenth Amendment forbids a State to convict a person ofa crime without proving the elements of that crime beyonda reasonable doubt. See Jackson, 443 U. S., at 316; In reWinship, 397 U. S. 358, 364 (1970). In this case, failure topossess a permit is a basic element of the crime of whichFiore was convicted. Scarpone, supra, at 279, 634 A. 2d, at1112. And the parties agree that the Commonwealth pre-sented no evidence whatsoever to prove that basic element.To the contrary, the Commonwealth, conceding that Fioredid possess a permit, see Brief for Respondents 1, necessarily concedes that it did not prove he failed to possess one.The simple, inevitable conclusion is that Fiore's convictionfails to satisfy the Federal Constitution's demands. Wetherefore reverse the contrary judgment of the Third Circuitand remand this case for proceedings consistent with thisopinion.
