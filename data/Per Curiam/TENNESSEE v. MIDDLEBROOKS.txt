New Mexico has been in violation of Article IV(b) of theCanadian River Compact from 1987 to date.2. Pursuant to Paragraph 8 of the Decree entered in thiscase, New Mexico shall release from Ute Reservoir in 1993sufficient water to result in an aggregate of not more than200,000 acre-feet of conservation storage below Conchas Damin New Mexico, including conservation storage in the otherreservoirs subject to the limitation under Article IV(b) ofthe Canadian River Compact. The release of water fromUte Reservoir will be coordinated with Oklahoma and Texasand will be at the call of Texas.3. New Mexico shall also release from Ute Reservoir anadditional 25,000 acre-feet of storage below the Article IV(b)limitation. New Mexico shall operate Ute Reservoirthrough the year 2002 at or below the elevations set forth inthe schedule below and in accordance with the provisions ofParagraph 8 of the Decree entered in this case. The sched-ule includes annual adjustments for sediment accumulationin Ute Reservoir and assumes the other reservoirs subjectto the Article IV(b) limitation maintain storage at their totalcapacity of 6,760 acre-feet. The schedule shall be adjustedby the parties to reflect additional amounts of water in conservation storage in any reservoir enlarged or constructed510us1$10Z 04-16-96 21:08:46 PAGES OPINPGT127Cite as: 510 U.

Under Article IV(a) of the Canadian River Compact(Compact), New Mexico is permitted free and unrestricteduse of the waters of the Canadian River and its tributariesin New Mexico above Conchas Dam, such use to be madeabove or at Conchas Dam, including diversions for use on theTucumcari Project and the Bell Ranch and the on-projectstorage of return flow or operational waste from those twoprojects so long as the recaptured water does not includethe mainstream or tributary flows of the Canadian River;provided that transfers of water rights from above ConchasDam to locations below Conchas Dam shall be subject to theconservation storage limitation of Compact Article IV(b).Nothing in this paragraph shall be deemed to determinewhether or not the place of use of water rights may be transferred to locations outside the Canadian River basin inNew Mexico.2. Under Compact Article IV(b), New Mexico is limited tostorage of no more than 200,000 acre-feet of the waters ofthe Canadian River and its tributaries, regardless of point oforigin, at any time in reservoirs in the Canadian River basinin New Mexico below Conchas Dam for any beneficial use,exclusive of water stored for the exempt purposes specifiedin Compact Article II(d) and on-project storage of irrigationreturn flows or operational waste on the Tucumcari Projectand Bell Ranch as provided for in Paragraph 1 of this Decree.3. Quantities of water stored primarily for flood protection, power generation, or sediment control are not chargeable as conservation storage under the Compact even thoughincidental use is made of such waters for recreation, fish andwildlife, or other beneficial uses not expressly mentioned inthe Compact. In situations where storage may be for multiple purposes, including both conservation storage andexempt storage, nothing in this Decree shall preclude theCanadian River Commission (Commission) from exempting510us1$10Z 04-16-96 21:08:46 PAGES OPINPGT129Cite as: 510 U. S. 126 (1993)Decreean appropriate portion of such storage from chargeabilityas conservation storage.4. Water stored at elevations below a dam's lowest perma-nent outlet works is not chargeable as conservation storageunder the Compact unless the primary use of that storage isfor a nonexempt purpose, or unless other means, such aspumps, are utilized to discharge such storage volumes fromthe reservoir. No change in the location of a dam's lowestpermanent outlet works to a higher elevation shall providethe basis for a claim of exempt status for all water storedbelow the relocated outlet works without prior approval ofthe Commission, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.Water stored for nonexempt purposes behind a dam withcapacity in excess of 100 acre-feet and with no outlet worksis chargeable as conservation storage.5. Future designation or redesignation of storage volumesfor flood control, power production, or sediment control purposes must receive prior Commission approval to be exemptfrom chargeability as conservation storage, which approvalshall not be unreasonably withheld.6. All water stored in Ute Reservoir above elevation 3,725feet is conservation storage; provided that at such time asthe authorization and funding of the Eastern New MexicoWater Supply Project or other project results in changedcircumstances at Ute Reservoir, New Mexico may seek exemption of a reasonable portion of such water from the Commission under Paragraph 5 of this Decree and, if an exemption is denied, may petition the Court for appropriate reliefunder Paragraph 11 of this Decree.7. In 1988 there were 63 small reservoirs in New Mexicowith capacities of 100 acre-feet or less with a total capacityof about 1,000 acre-feet, which the Commission has treatedas de minimis by waiving storage volume reporting obligations. Water stored in these reservoirs or in similarly sizedreservoirs in the future is not chargeable as conservationstorage, unless otherwise determined by the Commission.510us1$10Z 04-16-96 21:08:46 PAGES OPINPGT130 OKLAHOMA v. NEW MEXICODecree8. Based on the elevation-capacity relationship of Ute Reservoir effective January 1, 1993, and adjustments pursuantto Paragraph 9 of this Decree, New Mexico shall make andmaintain appropriate releases of water from Ute Reservoiror other conservation storage facilities in excess of 100 acrefeet of capacity at the maximum rate consistent with safeoperation of such reservoirs so that total conservation storage in the Canadian River basin below Conchas Dam in NewMexico is limited to no more than 200,000 acre-feet at anytime; provided that operation of Ute Reservoir for the period1993-2002 shall be pursuant to the schedule contained in theJudgment entered in this case; and provided that no violationof this paragraph will occur during any period in which theoutlet works of Ute Reservoir are discharging water at themaximum safe discharge capacity (currently 350 cubic feetper second) following the first knowledge that the 1993-2002schedule or the Article IV(b) limitation after 2002 probablywould be exceeded; and provided further that Texas shall benotified by New Mexico prior to a release and may allowNew Mexico to retain water in conservation storage in excess of the 1993-2002 schedule or the Article IV(b) limitationafter 2002, subject to the call of Texas and subject to theprovisions of Article V of the Compact. The outlet worksof Ute Reservoir shall be maintained in good working orderand shall not be modified to reduce the safe discharge capacity without prior approval of the Commission, which shallnot be unreasonably withheld.9. Sediment surveys of Ute Reservoir shall be conductedat least every 10 years by New Mexico, unless such requirement is waived by the Commission. Conservation storagein Ute Reservoir shall be determined from the most recentsediment survey and an annual estimate of the total additional sediment deposition in the reservoir using an annualaverage of sediment accumulation during the period between1963 and the most recently completed survey.510us1$10Z 04-16-96 21:08:46 PAGES OPINPGT131Cite as: 510 U.

ZANT, WARDENon petition for writ of certiorari to the unitedstates court of appeals for the eleventh circuitNo. 92-8836. Decided January 10, 1994The first time petitioner Burden's habeas petition was before this Court,his case was remanded so that his claim that his pretrial counsel's conflict of interest denied his right to effective assistance of counsel couldbe considered by the Court of Appeals "free from" that court's erroneousfailure to credit a state-court finding that the key prosecution witnesswas granted immunity while represented by Burden's counsel. 498U. S. 433. In rejecting his claim a second time, the Court of Appealsheld that it did not have to presume the immunity finding's correctnessbecause the state court had not adequately developed the finding. Itreasoned that the state court's conclusion amounted to mere personalimpression on an issue not subject to significant dispute at trial andstated that the District Court had found that the key witness had notbeen granted immunity.Held: The Court of Appeals' decision was based on a manifest error. TheDistrict Court did not make the immunity finding as claimed by theCourt of Appeals, and the Court of Appeals overlooked evidencestrongly supporting Burden's contention regarding an immunity deal.On remand, the Court of Appeals or, subject to its further order, theDistrict Court must determine whether counsel's representation createdan actual conflict of interest adversely affecting his performance.Certiorari granted; 975 F. 2d 771, reversed and remanded.Per Curiam.In Burden v. Zant, 498 U. S. 433 (1991) (per curiam), wereversed a judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, which had upheld denial of habeas relief on aclaim of ineffective assistance of counsel due to conflict ofinterest. The case is before us again on a petition seekingreview of the decision rendered on remand, 975 F. 2d 771(1992), in which the Court of Appeals once again rejectedBurden's claim that he had been deprived of the right to berepresented by counsel free of conflict of interest.510us1$11z 06-19-97 20:42:49 PAGES OPINPGT133Cite as: 510 U. S. 132 (1994)Per CuriamIn our earlier unanimous per curiam opinion, we held thatthe courts below had failed to accord the presumption of correctness apparently due a state-court determination bearingon the conflict claim (i. e., that Dixon, the key prosecutionwitness allegedly represented by Burden's pretrial counsel," `was granted immunity from prosecution,' " 498 U. S., at436). See 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d). We directed the Court ofAppeals on remand to evaluate Burden's conflict-of-interestclaim "free from" the "erroneous failure to credit the statetrial court's finding . . . ." 498 U. S., at 438.In the decision now before us, the Eleventh Circuit majority first held that there was no need for a federal habeascourt to presume the correctness of the immunity finding,because it had not been "adequately developed" in the statetrial court proceeding. See 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d)(3). Themajority reasoned that the trial court's conclusion, containedin an administrative report to the State Supreme Court, seeGa. Code Ann. $ 17-10-35(a) (1990), and not labeled a findingof fact or conclusion of law, amounted to the trial judge'smere personal "impression" on an issue not subject to significant dispute at trial. See 975 F. 2d, at 774-775. Declaring it "improper" to defer to the judge's "comment," id., at775, the Court of Appeals explained that it would uphold itsprior denial of relief on the basis of a District Court finding,said to be that "Dixon did not testify under a grant of transactional immunity or pursuant to a promise that the Statewould not prosecute him," ibid. In a dissenting opinion,Judge Anderson maintained that the District Court's ordercontained no such finding and that his colleagues had overlooked the record of evidence strongly supporting Burden'scontention that some sort of immunity deal had, in fact,been struck.Reviewing the record, we are convinced that Judge Anderson was correct, that the decision of the Court of Appealswas grounded on manifest mistake, and that reversal is warranted on that basis alone.

UNITED STATEScertiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuitNo. 92-1196. Argued November 1, 1993--Decided January 11, 1994As here relevant, federal law requires a domestic bank involved in a cashtransaction exceeding $10,000 to file a report with the Secretary of theTreasury, 31 U. S. C. $ 5313(a), 31 CFR $ 103.22(a); makes it illegal to"structure" a transaction--i. e., to break up a single transaction abovethe reporting threshold into two or more separate transactions--"forthe purpose of evading the reporting requiremen[t]," 31 U. S. C.$ 5324(3); and sets out criminal penalties for "[a] person willfully violating" the antistructuring provision, $ 5322(a). After the judge at petitioner Waldemar Ratzlaf 's trial on charges of violating $$ 5322(a) and5324(3) instructed the jury that the Government had to prove both thatthe defendant knew of the $ 5313(a) reporting obligation and that heattempted to evade that obligation, but did not have to prove that heknew the structuring in which he engaged was unlawful, Ratzlaf wasconvicted, fined, and sentenced to prison. In affirming, the Court ofAppeals upheld the trial court's construction of the legislation.Held: To give effect to $ 5322(a)'s "willfulness" requirement, the Government must prove that the defendant acted with knowledge that thestructuring he or she undertook was unlawful, not simply that the defendant's purpose was to circumvent a bank's reporting obligation. Section 5324 itself forbids structuring with a "purpose of evading the[$ 5313(a)] reporting requirements," and the lower courts erred in treating the "willfulness" requirement essentially as words of no consequence. Viewing $$ 5322(a) and 5324(3) in light of the complex of provisions in which they are embedded, it is significant that the omnibus"willfulness" requirement, when applied to other provisions in the samestatutory subchapter, consistently has been read by the Courts of Appeals to require both knowledge of the reporting requirement and aspecific intent to commit the crime or to disobey the law. The "willfulness" requirement must be construed the same way each time it is calledinto play. Because currency structuring is not inevitably nefarious, thisCourt is unpersuaded by the United States' argument that structuringis so obviously "evil" or inherently "bad" that the "willfulness" requirement is satisfied irrespective of the defendant's knowledge of the illegality of structuring. The interpretation adopted in this case does not dishonor the venerable principle that ignorance of the law generally is no510us1$12F 06-18-97 16:59:17 PAGES OPINPGT136 RATZLAF v.

S. 135 (1994)Opinion of the Courtrequirement mandates something more. To establish that adefendant "willfully violat[ed]" the antistructuring law, theGovernment must prove that the defendant acted withknowledge that his conduct was unlawful.IOn the evening of October 20, 1988, defendant-petitionerWaldemar Ratzlaf ran up a debt of $160,000 playing blackjackat the High Sierra Casino in Reno, Nevada. The casinogave him one week to pay. On the due date, Ratzlaf returned to the casino with cash of $100,000 in hand. A casinoofficial informed Ratzlaf that all transactions involving morethan $10,000 in cash had to be reported to state and federalauthorities. The official added that the casino could accepta cashier's check for the full amount due without triggeringany reporting requirement. The casino helpfully placed alimousine at Ratzlaf 's disposal, and assigned an employee toaccompany him to banks in the vicinity. Informed thatbanks, too, are required to report cash transactions in excessof $10,000, Ratzlaf purchased cashier's checks, each for lessthan $10,000 and each from a different bank. He deliveredthese checks to the High Sierra Casino.Based on this endeavor, Ratzlaf was charged with "structuring transactions" to evade the banks' obligation to reportcash transactions exceeding $10,000; this conduct, the indictment alleged, violated 31 U. S. C. $$ 5322(a) and 5324(3).The trial judge instructed the jury that the Government hadto prove defendant's knowledge of the banks' reporting obligation and his attempt to evade that obligation, but did notquired to satisfy $ 5322's willfulness requirement), with United States v.Aversa, 984 F. 2d 493, 502 (CA1 1993) (en banc) (a "willful action" withinthe meaning of $ 5322(a) "is one committed in violation of a known legalduty or in consequence of a defendant's reckless disregard of such a duty").510us1$12F 06-18-97 16:59:17 PAGES OPINPGT138 RATZLAF v.

To gain a conviction for"willful" conduct, he asserted, the Government must provehe was aware of the illegality of the "structuring" in whichhe engaged. The Ninth Circuit upheld the trial court's construction of the legislation and affirmed Ratzlaf 's conviction.976 F. 2d 1280 (1992). We granted certiorari, 507 U. S. 1050(1993), and now conclude that, to give effect to the statutory"willfulness" specification, the Government had to proveRatzlaf knew the structuring he undertook was unlawful.We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.IIACongress enacted the Currency and Foreign TransactionsReporting Act (Bank Secrecy Act) in 1970, Pub.

The Act imposes a variety ofreporting requirements on individuals and institutions regarding foreign and domestic financial transactions. See 31U. S. C. $$ 5311-5325. The reporting requirement relevanthere, $ 5313(a), applies to domestic financial transactions.Section 5313(a) reads:"When a domestic financial institution is involved ina transaction for the payment, receipt, or transfer of2 Ratzlaf's wife and the casino employee who escorted Ratzlaf to areabanks were codefendants.

The Government does not assert that Ratzlaf obtained the cash used in any of the transactions relevanthere in other than a lawful manner.5 Subsequent to Ratzlaf's conviction, Congress recodified $ 5324(1)-(3) as$ 5324(a)(1)-(3), without substantive change. In addition, Congress addedsubsection (b) to replicate the prohibitions of subsection (a) in the contextof international currency transactions. See Annunzio-Wylie Anti-MoneyLaundering Act, Pub.

For simplicity, we refer to the codification in effect at the time the Court of Appeals decided this case.510us1$12F 06-18-97 16:59:17 PAGES OPINPGT140 RATZLAF v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Court"(3) structure or assist in structuring, or attempt tostructure or assist in structuring, any transaction withone or more domestic financial institutions." 6The criminal enforcement provision at issue, 31 U. S. C.$ 5322(a), sets out penalties for "[a] person willfully violating," inter alia, the antistructuring provision. Section5322(a) reads:"A person willfully violating this subchapter [31U. S.

Ratzlaf admits that he structured cash transac-tions, and that he did so with knowledge of, and a purposeto avoid, the banks' duty to report currency transactions inexcess of $10,000. The statutory formulation ($ 5322) underwhich Ratzlaf was prosecuted, however, calls for proof of"willful[ness]" on the actor's part. The trial judge in Ratzlaf 's case, with the Ninth Circuit's approbation, treated$ 5322(a)'s "willfulness" requirement essentially as surplusage--as words of no consequence.7 Judges should hesitateso to treat statutory terms in any setting, and resistance6 Regarding enforcement of $ 5324, the Secretary considered, but did notpromulgate, a regulation requiring banks to inform currency transactioncustomers of the section's proscription. See 53 Fed. Reg. 7948 (1988) (proposing "procedures to notify [bank] customers of the provisions to Section5324" in order to "insure compliance" with those provisions); 54 Fed. Reg.20398 (1989) (withdrawing proposal).7 The United States confirmed at oral argument that, in its view, as inthe view of the courts below, "the 5324 offense is just what it would be ifyou never had 5322."

See Pennsylvania Dept. of PublicWelfare v. Davenport, 495 U.

United States, 155 U. S. 438,446 (1894) (word "wilful" used to describe certain offensesbut not others in same statute "cannot be regarded as meresurplusage; it means something")."Willful," this Court has recognized, is a "word of manymeanings," and "its construction [is] often . . . influencedby its context." Spies v. United States, 317 U. S. 492, 497(1943). Accordingly, we view $$ 5322(a) and 5324(3) mindfulof the complex of provisions in which they are embedded.In this light, we count it significant that $ 5322(a)'s omnibus"willfulness" requirement, when applied to other provisionsin the same subchapter, consistently has been read by theCourts of Appeals to require both "knowledge of the report-ing requirement"and a "specific intent to commit the crime,"i. e., "a purpose to disobey the law." See United States v.Bank of New England, N. A., 821 F. 2d 844, 854-859 (CA11987) ("willful violation" of $ 5313's reporting requirementfor cash transactions over $10,000 requires "voluntary, intentional, and bad purpose to disobey the law"); United Statesv.

Hoyland, 914F. 2d 1125, 1129 (CA9 1990)). It is therefore "reasonable,"the Government concludes, "to hold a structurer responsiblefor evading the reporting requirements without the need toprove specific knowledge that such evasion is unlawful."Brief for United States 29.Undoubtedly there are bad men who attempt to elude official reporting requirements in order to hide from Government inspectors such criminal activity as launderingdrug money or tax evasion.11 But currency structuring isnot inevitably nefarious. Consider, for example, the smallbusiness operator who knows that reports filed under 31U. S. C. $ 5313(a) are available to the Internal Revenue Service. To reduce the risk of an IRS audit, she brings $9,500in cash to the bank twice each week, in lieu of transportingover $10,000 once each week. That person, if the UnitedStates is right, has committed a criminal offense, becauseshe structured cash transactions "for the specific purpose ofdepriving the Government of the information that Section5313(a) is designed to obtain."

Had Congress wished to dispense with the requirement, it could have furnished the appropriate instruction.16CIn $ 5322, Congress subjected to criminal penalties onlythose "willfully violating" $ 5324, signaling its intent to require for conviction proof that the defendant knew not only15 The statute provides that "[i]n the case of gifts . . . made to any personby [a] donor during [a] calendar year, the first $10,000 of such gifts to suchperson shall not . . . be included in the total amount of gifts made duringsuch year." 26 U.

S. 135 (1994)Opinion of the Courtof the bank's duty to report cash transactions in excess of$10,000, but also of his duty not to avoid triggering such areport. There are, we recognize, contrary indications in thestatute's legislative history.17 But we do not resort to legis17 The United States points to one of the Senate Reports accompanyingthe Money Laundering Control Act of 1986, which stated that "a personwho converts $18,000 in currency to cashier's checks by purchasing two$9,000 cashier's checks at two different banks or on two different dayswith the specific intent that the participating bank or banks not be required to file Currency Transaction Reports for those transactions, wouldbe subject to potential civil and criminal liability." S. Rep. No. 99-433,p. 22 (1986), cited in Brief for United States 35. The same Report alsoindicated that $ 5324 "would codify [United States v.] Tobon-Builes[, 706F. 2d 1092 (CA11 1983),] and like cases [by] expressly subject[ing] to potential liability a person who causes or attempts to cause a financial institutionto fail to file a required report or who causes a financial institution to filea required report that contains material omissions or misstatements offact." S. Rep. No. 99-433, at 22, cited in Brief for United States 33.But the legislative history cited by the United States is hardly crystalline. The reference to United States v. Tobon-Builes, 706 F. 2d 1092(CA11 1983), is illustrative. In that case, the defendant was chargedunder 18 U. S. C. $ 1001, the False Statements Act, with "conceal[ing] . . .the existence, source, and transfer of approximately $185,200 in cash bypurchasing approximately twenty-one cashier's checks in amounts lessthan $10,000 [and] using a variety of names, including false names . . . ."706 F. 2d, at 1094. The defendant's "main contention," rejected by theEleventh Circuit, was that he "could not have violated the concealmentprohibition of $ 1001 because he was under no legal duty to report any ofhis cash transactions." Id., at 1096. No "ignorance of the law" defensewas asserted. Congress may indeed have "codified" that decision in$ 5324 by "expressly subject[ing] to potential liability a person who causesor attempts to cause a financial institution to fail to file a required reportor who causes a financial institution to file a required report that containsmaterial omissions or misstatements of fact," S. Rep. No. 99-433, at 22,but it appears that Congress did so in the first and second subsections of$ 5324, which track the Senate Report language almost verbatim. See 31U. S.

C. $ 5324(2) (no person shall "cause or attempt to cause a domesticfinancial institution to file a report required under section 5313(a) thatcontains a material omission or misstatement of fact").

Hughey v. United States, 495U. S. 411, 422 (1990) (lenity principles "demand resolution ofambiguities in criminal statutes in favor of the defendant");Crandon v. United States, 494 U.

S. Rep. No. 99-433, at 22. The relevance ofTobon-Builes to the proper construction of $ 5324(3), the subsection underwhich Ratzlaf was convicted, is not evident.18 See Barnhill v. Johnson, 503 U. S. 393, 401 (1992) (appeals to legislative history are well taken only to resolve statutory ambiguity). See alsoUnited States v.

As the First Circuit noted, no House, Senate, or ConferenceReport accompanied the final version of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986;instead, over 20 separate reports accompanied various proposed bills, portions of which were incorporated into that Act. See 1986 U. S. C. C. A.N. 5393 (listing reports).The dissent, see post, at 161, features a House Report issued in 1991 inconnection with an unenacted version of the Annunzio-Wylie Anti-MoneyLaundering Act. We do not find that Report, commenting on a bill thatdid not pass, a secure indicator of congressional intent at any time, and itsurely affords no reliable guide to Congress' intent in 1986.

In particular contexts, however, Congress may decree otherwise.That, we hold, is what Congress has done with respect to 31U. S. C. $ 5322(a) and the provisions it controls. To convictRatzlaf of the crime with which he was charged, violation of31 U. S.
