In these three petitions for certiorari, pro se petitionerLiang-Houh Shieh requests leave to proceed in forma pauperis under Rule 39 of this Court. We deny his requestspursuant to Rule 39.8. Shieh is allowed until April 22, 1996,within which to pay the docketing fees required by Rule 38and to submit his petitions in compliance with this Court'sRule 33.1. We also direct the Clerk not to accept any fur-ther petitions for certiorari from Shieh in noncriminal matters unless he pays the docketing fee required by Rule 38and submits his petition in compliance with Rule 33.1.Shieh has abused this Court's certiorari process. InMarch 1996, we invoked Rule 39.8 to deny Shiehin formapauperis status. See Shieh v. State Bar of California, 516*Together with No. 95-7588, Shieh v. United States Court of Appealsfor the Ninth Circuit, and No. 95-7589, Shieh v. Krieger et al., also onmotion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis to the same court.517us1$42h 11-06-97 20:40:28 PAGES OPINPGT344 SHIEH v. KAKITAStevens, J., dissentingU. S. 1170. To date, Shieh has filed 10 petitions in this Courtin less than three years. All have been both patently frivolous and denied without recorded dissent.We enter the order barring prospective filings for the reasons discussed in Martin v. District of Columbia Court ofAppeals, 506 U. S. 1 (1992). Shieh's abuse of the writ of cer-tiorari has been in noncriminal cases, and so we limit oursanction accordingly. The order will not prevent Shieh frompetitioning to challenge criminal sanctions which might beimposed against him. The order will, however, allow thisCourt to devote its limited resources to the claims of petitioners who have not abused our certiorari process.
