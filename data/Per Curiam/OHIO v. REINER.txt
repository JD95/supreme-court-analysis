The Supreme Court of Ohio here held that a witness whodenies all culpability does not have a valid Fifth Amendmentprivilege against self-incrimination. Because our prece-dents dictate that the privilege protects the innocent as wellas the guilty, and that the facts here are sufficient to sustaina claim of privilege, we grant the petition for certiorari andreverse.Respondent was charged with involuntary manslaughterin connection with the death of his 2-month-old son Alex.The coroner testified at trial that Alex died from "shakenbaby syndrome," the result of child abuse. He estimatedthat Alex's injury most likely occurred minutes before thechild stopped breathing. Alex died two days later when hewas removed from life support. Evidence produced at trialrevealed that Alex had a broken rib and a broken leg at thetime of his death. His twin brother Derek, who was alsoexamined, had several broken ribs. Respondent had beenalone with Alex for half an hour immediately before Alexstopped breathing. Respondent's experts testified thatAlex could have been injured several hours before his respiratory arrest. Alex was in the care of the family's babysitter, Susan Batt, at that time. Batt had cared for thechildren during the day for about two weeks prior to Alex'sdeath. The defense theory was that Batt, not respondent,was the culpable party.Batt informed the court in advance of testifying that sheintended to assert her Fifth Amendment privilege. At theState's request, the trial court granted her transactional im-munity from prosecution pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann.$ 2945.44 (1999). She then testified to the jury that she hadrefused to testify without a grant of immunity on the adviceof counsel, although she had done nothing wrong. Batt de-nied any involvement in Alex's death. She testified that shehad never shaken Alex or his brother at any time, specificallyon the day Alex suffered respiratory arrest. She said she532US1 Unit: $U30 [09-05-02 18:21:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN19Cite as: 532 U. S. 17 (2001)Per Curiamwas unaware of and had nothing to do with the other injuriesto both children. The jury found respondent guilty of involuntary manslaughter, and he appealed.The Court of Appeals of Ohio, Sixth District, reversed respondent's conviction on grounds not relevant to our decisionhere. The Supreme Court of Ohio affirmed the reversal, onthe alternative ground that Batt had no valid Fifth Amendment privilege and that the trial court's grant of immunityunder $ 2945.44 was therefore unlawful.* 89 Ohio St. 3d 342,358, 731 N. E. 2d 662, 677 (2000). The court found that thewrongful grant of immunity prejudiced respondent, becauseit effectively told the jury that Batt did not cause Alex'sinjuries.The court recognized that the privilege against selfincrimination applies where a witness' answers "could reasonably `furnish a link in the chain of evidence' " against him,id., at 352, 731 N. E. 2d, at 673 (quoting Hoffman v. UnitedStates, 341 U. S. 479, 486 (1951)). Hoffman, it noted, requires the trial court to determine whether the witness hascorrectly asserted the privilege, and to order the witness toanswer questions if the witness is mistaken about the dangerof incrimination. Ibid. The court faulted the trial judgefor failing to question sufficiently Batt's assertion of the privilege. It noted that the Court of Appeals, in finding a validprivilege, failed to consider the prosecutor's suggestion thatBatt's testimony would not incriminate her, and Batt's denialof involvement in Alex's abuse when questioned by the Children's Services Board. The court held that "Susan Batt's*Ohio Rev. Code Ann. $ 2945.44 (1999) states in pertinent part: "In anycriminal proceeding . . . if a witness refuses to answer or produce information on the basis of his privilege against self-incrimination, the court ofcommon pleas . . . unless it finds that to do so would not further the administration of justice, shall compel the witness to answer or produce theinformation, if . . . [the prosecuting attorney so requests and] . . . [t]hecourt . . . informs the witness that by answering, or producing the information he will receive [transactional] immunity . . . ." (Emphasis added.)532US1 Unit: $U30 [09-05-02 18:21:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN20 OHIO v. REINERPer Curiam[trial] testimony did not incriminate her, because she deniedany involvement in the abuse. Thus, she did not have avalid Fifth Amendment privilege." 89 Ohio St. 3d, at 355,731 N. E. 2d, at 675 (emphasis in original). The court emphasized that the defense's theory of Batt's guilt was notgrounds for a grant of immunity, "when the witness continues to deny any self-incriminating conduct." Ibid.The Supreme Court of Ohio's decision that Batt waswrongly granted immunity under $ 2945.44 (and consequently, that reversal of respondent's conviction was re-quired) rested on the court's determination that Batt did nothave a valid Fifth Amendment privilege. In discussing thecontours of that privilege, the court relied on our precedents.We have observed that "this Court retains a role when astate court's interpretation of state law has been influencedby an accompanying interpretation of federal law." ThreeAffiliated Tribes of Fort Berthold Reservation v. Wold Engineering, P. C., 467 U. S. 138, 152 (1984). The decision atissue "fairly appears . . . to be interwoven with the federallaw," and no adequate and independent state ground is clearfrom the face of the opinion. Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S.1032, 1040-1041 (1983). We have jurisdiction over a statecourt judgment that rests, as a threshold matter, on a determination of federal law. See Merrell Dow PharmaceuticalsInc. v. Thompson, 478 U. S. 804, 816 (1986) ("[T]his Courtretains power to review the decision of a federal issue in astate cause of action"); St. Louis, I. M. & S. R. Co. v. Taylor,210 U. S. 281, 293-294 (1908).The Fifth Amendment provides that "[n]o person . . . shallbe compelled in any criminal case to be a witness againsthimself." U. S. Const., Amdt. 5. As the Supreme Court ofOhio acknowledged, this privilege not only extends "to answers that would in themselves support a conviction . . . butlikewise embraces those which would furnish a link in thechain of evidence needed to prosecute the claimant." Hoffman, 341 U. S., at 486. "[I]t need only be evident from the532US1 Unit: $U30 [09-05-02 18:21:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN21Cite as: 532 U. S. 17 (2001)Per Curiamimplications of the question, in the setting in which it isasked, that a responsive answer to the question or an explanation of why it cannot be answered might be dangerous be-cause injurious disclosure could result."Id., at 486-487.We have held that the privilege's protection extends onlyto witnesses who have "reasonable cause to apprehend danger from a direct answer." Id., at 486. That inquiry is forthe court; the witness' assertion does not by itself establishthe risk of incrimination.Ibid. A danger of "imaginaryand unsubstantial character" will not suffice. Mason v.United States, 244 U. S. 362, 366 (1917). But we have neverheld, as the Supreme Court of Ohio did, that the privilege isunavailable to those who claim innocence. To the contrary,we have emphasized that one of the Fifth Amendment's"basic functions . . . is to protect innocent men . . . `whootherwise might be ensnared by ambiguous circumstances.' "Grunewald v. United States, 353 U. S. 391, 421 (1957) (quoting Slochower v. Board of Higher Ed. of New York City, 350U. S. 551, 557-558 (1956)) (emphasis in original). In Grunewald, we recognized that truthful responses of an innocentwitness, as well as those of a wrongdoer, may provide thegovernment with incriminating evidence from the speaker'sown mouth. 353 U. S., at 421-422.The Supreme Court of Ohio's determination that Battdid not have a valid Fifth Amendment privilege becauseshe denied any involvement in the abuse of the childrenclearly conflicts with Hoffman and Grunewald. Batt had"reasonable cause" to apprehend danger from her answersif questioned at respondent's trial. Hoffman, supra, at486. Batt spent extended periods of time alone with Alexand his brother in the weeks immediately preceding discovery of their injuries. She was with Alex within the potential timeframe of the fatal trauma. The defense's theory ofthe case was that Batt, not respondent, was responsible forAlex's death and his brother's uncharged injuries. In thissetting, it was reasonable for Batt to fear that answers to532US1 Unit: $U30 [09-05-02 18:21:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN22 OHIO v. REINERPer Curiampossible questions might tend to incriminate her. Batttherefore had a valid Fifth Amendment privilege againstself-incrimination.We do not, of course, address the question whether immunity from suit under $ 2945.44 was appropriate. Because theSupreme Court of Ohio mistakenly held that the witness'assertion of innocence deprived her of her Fifth Amendmentprivilege against self-incrimination, the petition for a writ ofcertiorari is granted, the court's judgment is reversed, andthis case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
