IMLAYWhite, J., dissentingquently resentenced respondent, again to a 5-year term ofimprisonment, and the Montana Supreme Court upheld thatsentence in a judgment not now before us for review.Thus, no matter which party might prevail in this Court,the respondent's term of imprisonment will be the same. Atoral argument, neither counsel identified any way in whichthe interests of his client would be advanced by a favorabledecision on the merits--except, of course, for the potentialbenefit that might flow from an advisory opinion.* Becauseit is not the business of this Court to render such opinions,it wisely decides to dismiss a petition that should not havebeen granted in the first place.Justice White, dissenting.We granted certiorari to consider whether the FifthAmendment bars a State from conditioning probation uponthe probationer's successful completion of a therapy programin which he would be required to admit responsibility for hiscriminal acts. In the decision below, the Montana SupremeCourt held that, "absent any grant of immunity" from prosecution for incriminating statements made during therapy,the Fifth Amendment "prohibit[s] augmenting a defendant'ssentence because he refuses to confess to a crime or invokeshis privilege against self-incrimination." 249 Mont. 82, 91,813 P. 2d 979, 985 (1991). The constitutional question is animportant one and the decision below places the MontanaSupreme Court in conflict with other courts. See State v.Gleason, 154 Vt. 205, 576 A. 2d 1246 (1990); Henderson v.*Indeed, counsel for the State went so far as to explain that a victoryfor Montana on the merits would actually work to the advantage of respondent, by subjecting him to treatment leading to parole eligibility:"Question: So you're really trying to advance his [respondent's]interests?"[Answer]: Yes, sir, we are."Question: He is better off if you win than if you lose."[Answer]: In our judgment that is certainly the case."

Supp. 558 (ED Mo. 1989), appeal dism'd, 902 F. 2d 1574(CA8 1990). I believe we should decide the question andresolve the conflict.As an initial matter, there can be no doubt that the decision below is a "final judgment" for purposes of 28 U. S. C.$ 1257. Although the Montana Supreme Court remandedthe case for resentencing, this is clearly a case in which "thefederal issue, finally decided by the highest court in theState, will survive and require decision regardless of the outcome of future state-court proceedings." Cox BroadcastingCorp. v. Cohn, 420 U. S. 469, 480 (1975); see also Brady v.Maryland, 373 U. S. 83, 85, n. 1 (1963).At oral argument, however, two further questions wereraised concerning whether any live controversy persists inthis case. First, counsel for respondent stated that his client had been assured by state corrections officials that hewould be paroled in the very near future. If this were true,the outcome of this case could have no practical effect uponrespondent's sentence. Second, counsel for petitioner statedhis belief that a probationer would enjoy immunity fromprosecution for incriminating statements made during courtordered therapy. This statement calls into doubt a criticalassumption underpinning the Montana Supreme Court'sjudgment and might suggest that there really is no disagreement about the Fifth Amendment's application to this case.In my view, however, neither party's representation issufficient to deprive this case of its status as a case orcontroversy. First, as counsel for both parties readily acknowledged, there is nothing in the record to supportthe expectation of respondent's counsel that respondent willbe paroled shortly without regard to his completion of theState's therapy program. As far as the record is concerned,a decision in this case would affect respondent's eligibilityfor parole and thus have real consequences for the litigants.506us1$$2z 09-11-95 13:35:52 PAGES OPINPGT8 MONTANA v. IMLAYWhite, J., dissentingNor does the State's "concession" that a defendant wouldhave immunity from prosecution based upon incriminatingstatements made to a therapist moot this case or otherwiserender it unsuitable for review. This "concession" appearedto rest solely on the State's assumption that this Court's de-cision inMinnesota v. Murphy, 465 U. S. 420 (1984), man-dated such a result. That reading of Murphy, however, isat least debatable. Because the State's concession appearsto reflect a possible misunderstanding of its obligationsunder the law rather than any unequivocal and unconditionaldeclaration of its own future prosecutorial policy, this statement does not moot this case or obviate the controversy. Ifits reading ofMurphy were shown to be erroneous, the Statemight well revert to the view that a defendant could be prosecuted on the basis of statements made during postconvic-tion therapy. Such a qualified concession is too uncertaina basis to find that no live controversy is presented. Cf.United States v. Generix Drug Corp., 460 U. S. 453, 456, n. 6(1983); United States v. Concentrated Phosphate ExportAssn., Inc., 393 U. S. 199, 203 (1968). In any event, the Mon-tana Supreme Court evidently was of the view that no grantof immunity protected respondent or others in his positionand the State continues to suffer the consequences of itsconstitutional holding.Because I believe that a genuine and important controversy is presented in this case, I respectfully dissent fromthe dismissal of the writ of certiorari.506us1$$3z 08-22-96 16:41:19 PAGES OPINPGT9OCTOBER TERM, 1992SyllabusCHURCH OF SCIENTOLOGY OF CALIFORNIA v.UNITED STATESet al.certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuitNo. 91-946. Argued October 6, 1992--Decided November 16, 1992Pursuant to its jurisdiction under 26 U. S. C. $$ 7402(b) and 7604(a), theDistrict Court ordered a state-court Clerk to comply with a summonsissued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the production of,inter alia, two tapes in the Clerk's custody recording conversations between officials of petitioner Church of Scientology (Church) and theirattorneys. Although the Church filed a timely notice of appeal, its request for a stay of the summons enforcement order was unsuccessful,and copies of the tapes were delivered to the IRS while the appeal waspending. The Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal as moot, rulingthat no controversy existed because the tapes had already been turnedover to the IRS.Held: Compliance with the summons enforcement order did not moot theChurch's appeal. Delivery of the tapes to the IRS did not mandatedismissal by making it impossible for the Court of Appeals to grant theChurch "any effectual relief." See Mills v. Green, 159 U. S. 651, 653.Although it is now too late to prevent, or to provide a fully satisfactoryremedy for, the invasion of privacy that occurred when the IRS obtainedthe information on the tapes, the Court of Appeals does have power toeffectuate a partial remedy by ordering the Government to return ordestroy any copies of the tapes that it may possess. Even if the Government is right that under $$ 7402(b) and 7604(a) the jurisdiction of thedistrict court is limited to those matters directly related to whether ornot the summons should be enforced, the question presented here iswhether there was jurisdiction in the appellate court to review the allegedly unlawful summons enforcement order. There is nothing in theInternal Revenue Code to suggest that Congress sought to precludesuch review, and, indeed, this Court has expressly held that IRSsummons enforcement orders are subject to appellate review. SeeReisman v. Caplin, 375 U. S. 440, 449. Although several Courts of Appeals have accepted the Government's argument in IRS enforcementproceedings, the force of that line of authority is matched by a similararray of decisions reaching a contrary conclusion in proceedings enforcing Federal Trade Commission discovery requests.

Pending resolutionof that action, the state court ordered its Clerk to take custody of the tapes and certain other documents.In 1984, in connection with an investigation of the tax returns of L. Ron Hubbard, founder of the Church of Scien-tology, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) sought access tothe Church documents in the state-court Clerk's possession.21 Church of Scientology of California v. Armstrong, No. C420 153.2 The Commissioner of Internal Revenue, as the delegate of the Secretary of the Treasury, has broad authority to examine the accuracy of federal tax returns. See generally Donaldson v. United States, 400 U. S.517, 523-525 (1971). Section 7602(a) of the Internal Revenue Code authorizes the Secretary to summon any person to provide documents relevant to such an examination:"For the purpose of ascertaining the correctness of any return, makinga return where none has been made, determining the liability of any per506us1$$3z 08-22-96 16:41:19 PAGES OPINPGT11Cite as: 506 U. S. 9 (1992)Opinion of the CourtAfter the Clerk was served with an IRS summons, he permitted IRS agents to examine and make copies of the tapes.Thereafter, in a federal action initiated by the Church in theCentral District of California, the District Court entered atemporary restraining order directing the IRS to file its copies of the tapes, and all related notes, with the federal court.3Those copies were subsequently returned to the Clerk of thestate court.On January 18, 1985, the IRS commenced this proceedingby filing a petition to enforce the summons that had previously been served on the state-court Clerk.4 The Churchintervened and opposed production of the tapes on theground that they were protected by the attorney-client privilege. After protracted proceedings, including review in thisCourt, see United States v. Zolin, 491 U. S. 554 (1989), onApril 15, 1991, the District Court entered an order enforcingcompliance with the summons. The Church filed a timelynotice of appeal and unsuccessfully sought a stay of thatorder. While the appeal was pending, copies of the tapeswere delivered to the IRS. Thereafter, the Court ofAppeals ordered the Church to show cause why its apson for any internal revenue tax or the liability at law or in equity of anytransferee or fiduciary of any person in respect of any internal revenuetax, or collecting any such liability, the Secretary is authorized--"(1) To examine any books, papers, records, or other data which may berelevant or material to such inquiry." 26 U.

UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtpeal should not be dismissed as moot. After briefingon the mootness issue, the court dismissed the appeal. Itexplained:"Because it is undisputed that the tapes have beenturned over to the IRS in compliance with the summonsenforcement order, no controversy exists presently andthis appeal is moot." United States v. Zolin, No. 91-55506 (CA9, Sept. 10, 1991).We granted the Church's petition for certiorari to considerthe narrow question whether the appeal was properly dismissed as moot. 503 U. S. 905 (1992).IIt has long been settled that a federal court has no authority "to give opinions upon moot questions or abstract propositions, or to declare principles or rules of law which cannotaffect the matter in issue in the case before it." Mills v.Green, 159 U. S. 651, 653 (1895). See also Preiser v. Newkirk, 422 U. S. 395, 401 (1975); North Carolina v. Rice, 404U. S. 244, 246 (1971). For that reason, if an event occurswhile a case is pending on appeal that makes it impossiblefor the court to grant "any effectual relief whatever" to aprevailing party, the appeal must be dismissed. Mills, 159U. S., at 653. In this case, after the Church took its appealfrom the April 15 order, in compliance with that order copiesof the tapes were delivered to the IRS. The Governmentcontends that it was thereafter impossible for the Courtof Appeals to grant the Church any effectual relief. Wedisagree.While a court may not be able to return the parties to thestatus quo ante--there is nothing a court can do to withdrawall knowledge or information that IRS agents may have acquired by examination of the tapes--a court can fashionsome form of meaningful relief in circumstances such as506us1$$3z 08-22-96 16:41:19 PAGES OPINPGT13Cite as: 506 U. S. 9 (1992)Opinion of the Courtthese. Taxpayers have an obvious possessory interest intheir records. When the Government has obtained such materials as a result of an unlawful summons, that interest isviolated and a court can effectuate relief by ordering theGovernment to return the records. Moreover, even if theGovernment retains only copies of the disputed materials, ataxpayer still suffers injury by the Government's continuedpossession of those materials, namely, the affront to the taxpayer's privacy. A person's interest in maintaining the pri-vacy of his "papers and effects" is of sufficient importanceto merit constitutional protection.5 Indeed, that the Churchconsiders the information contained on the disputed tapesimportant is demonstrated by the long, contentious historyof this litigation. Even though it is now too late to prevent,or to provide a fully satisfactory remedy for, the invasion ofprivacy that occurred when the IRS obtained the information on the tapes, a court does have power to effectuate apartial remedy by ordering the Government to destroy orreturn any and all copies it may have in its possession. Theavailability of this possible remedy is sufficient to preventthis case from being moot.65 The Fourth Amendment provides:"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers,and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported byOath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched,and the persons or things to be seized."6 Petitioner also argues that a court can effectuate further relief by ordering the IRS to refrain from any future use of the information that ithas derived from the tapes. Such an order would obviously go furthertowards returning the parties to the status quo ante than merely requiring the IRS to return the tapes and all copies thereof. However, as thereis no guarantee that the IRS will in fact use the information gleaned fromthe tapes, it could be argued that such an order would be an impermissibleadvisory opinion. Cf. G. M. Leasing Corp. v. United States, 429 U. S. 338,359 (1977) (suppression of fruits of illegal IRS search "premature" as issuecan be considered "if and when proceedings arise in which the Governmentseeks to use the documents or information obtained from them"). But506us1$$3z 08-22-96 16:41:19 PAGES OPINPGT14 CHURCH OF SCIENTOLOGY OF CAL. v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtThe Government argues, however, that these basic princi-ples are inapplicable in IRS summons enforcement proceedings because of the particular nature of the statute govern-ing such proceedings. Reasoning from the premise thatfederal courts are empowered to consider only those matterswithin their jurisdiction, the Government argues that inIRS summons enforcement proceedings the subject-matterjurisdiction of the district court is limited to determiningonly whether the court should "compel . . . production of "the information requested by the summons. 26 U. S. C.$$ 7402(b), 7604(a). See n. 4, supra. Once the court has an-swered that question and compliance has occurred, there isnothing more for the district court to decide and the juris-diction of the district court evaporates.We think the Government misconceives the inquiry in thiscase. The Government may or may not be right that under$$ 7402(b) and 7604(a) the jurisdiction of the district court islimited to those matters directly related to whether or notthe summons should be enforced. Indeed, the scope of thedistrict court's jurisdiction under those provisions was theissue over which this Court deadlocked in United States v.Zolin, 491 U. S. 554 (1989).7 The question presented in thesee FTC v. Gibson Products of San Antonio, Inc., 569 F. 2d 900, 903 (CA51978) (court can effectuate relief, despite compliance with FTC subpoena,by requiring FTC to return subpoenaed documents and forbidding FTCto use materials in adjudicatory hearing). Because we are concernedonly with the question whether any relief can be ordered, we leave the"future use" question for another day. For now, we need only hold thatthis case is not moot because a court has power to order the IRS to returnor destroy any copies of the tapes that it may have in its possession.7 In Zolin, the District Court enforced the IRS summons, but placedrestrictions on the IRS' ability to disclose the summoned materials to anyother government agency. The Ninth Circuit affirmed, United States v.Zolin, 809 F. 2d 1411, 1416-1417 (1987), and we granted certiorari in partto consider whether the District Court, in conditioning its enforcement ofthe IRS summons, exceeded its jurisdiction under $$ 7402(b) and 7604(a).Zolin, 491 U. S., at 556. We were evenly divided on that question andtherefore affirmed the Ninth Circuit. Id., at 561. The issue still divides506us1$$3z 08-22-96 16:41:19 PAGES OPINPGT15Cite as: 506 U. S. 9 (1992)Opinion of the Courtcurrent incarnation of this case is whether there was juris-diction in the appellate court to review the allegedly unlawful summons enforcement order. On that question, the Gov-ernment's elaborate statutory argument is largely irrelevant.There is nothing in the statute to suggest that Congresssought to preclude appellate review of district court enforcement orders. To the contrary, we have expressly held thatIRS summons enforcement ordersare subject to appellatereview. See Reisman v. Caplin, 375 U. S. 440, 449 (1964).Thus, whether or not there is jurisdiction in the appellatecourt to review the District Court's order turns not on thesubject matter of Congress' jurisdictional grant to the dis-trict courts, but on traditional principles of justiciability,namely, whether an intervening event has rendered the con-troversy moot. And, as we have already explained, thiscase is not moot because if the summons were improperlyissued or enforced a court could order that the IRS' copiesof the tapes be either returned or destroyed.IIWe recognize that several Courts of Appeals have ac-cepted the Government's argument in IRS enforcement proceedings,8 but the force of that line of authority is matchedthe lower courts.

While Gibson Products involved an adjudicative subpoena, Invention Submission, Casey, and Atlantic Richfield all involvedinvestigative subpoenas.10 In fact, the summons enforcement provisions of the Internal RevenueCode "closely paralle[l]" the corresponding provisions of the FederalTrade Commission Act.
