The killings were accomplished in abrutal and callous fashion: The elderly victims were "repeatedly beaten about the head until they died," State v. Cone,665 S. W. 2d 87, 90-91 (Tenn. 1984), and their bodies weresubsequently discovered "horribly mutilated and cruellybeaten," id., at 90. A Tennessee jury convicted respondentof, inter alia, two counts of murder in the first degree andtwo counts of murder in the first degree in the perpetrationof a burglary. At the conclusion of the penalty phase of respondent's trial, the jury unanimously found four aggravating circumstances 1 and concluded that they outweighed themitigating evidence. Respondent was sentenced to death.The Tennessee Supreme Court affirmed respondent's convictions and sentence. Id., at 96. As relevant here, thecourt held that three of the aggravating circumstances foundby the jury "were clearly shown by the evidence." Id., at1 The jury found the following aggravating circumstances: (1) respondent had been convicted of one or more felonies involving the use or threatof violence to a person, (2) the murders were "especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel in that they involved torture or depravity of mind," (3)respondent committed the murders for the purpose of preventing a lawfularrest or prosecution, and (4) respondent knowingly created a risk of deathto two or more persons, other than the victim murdered, during the murder. See State v. Cone, 665 S. W. 2d 87, 94-95 (Tenn. 1984).543US2 Unit: $U20 [03-06-07 15:37:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN449Cite as: 543 U.

Code Ann.] $ 39-2-203(i)(5). The evidence abundantly established that both of the elderly victims hadbeen brutally beaten to death by multiple crushingblows to the skulls. Blood was spattered throughoutthe house, and both victims apparently had attemptedto resist, because numerous defensive wounds werefound on their persons. The only excuse offered in theentire record for this unspeakably brutal conduct by theaccused was that these elderly victims had at some pointceased to `cooperate' with him in his ransacking of theirhome and in his effort to flee from arrest. As previously stated, it was stipulated by counsel for [respond-ent] that there was no issue of self-defense evenremotely suggested. The deaths of the victims werenot instantaneous, and obviously one had to be killedbefore the other. The terror, fright and horror thatthese elderly helpless citizens must have endured wascertainly something that the jury could have taken intoaccount in finding this aggravating circumstance." Id.,at 94-95.Respondent twice sought relief from his conviction andsentence in collateral proceedings in state court, to no avail.In his second amended petition for postconviction relief,respondent raised 52 independent claims of constitutional2 The state court rejected the jury's finding that respondent " `knowinglycreated a great risk of death to two (2) or more persons, other than thevictim murdered, during his act of murder,' " on the ground that the considerable threat respondent posed to others earlier in the day was notsufficiently close in time to the murders. Based on the strength of theother aggravating circumstances before the jury, the court held this errorto be "harmless beyond a reasonable doubt."

The statetrial court held each of respondent's claims barred by Tenn.Code Ann. $ 40-30-111 (1990), which limited the groundsthat may be raised on collateral review to those not waivedor previously determined in previous proceedings. Thetrial court explained that respondent's constitutional challenge to the "heinous, atrocious, or cruel" aggravating cir-cumstance, along with many other claims, was "clearly [a]re-statemen[t] of previous grounds heretofore determinedand denied by the Tennessee Supreme Court upon DirectAppeal or the Court of Criminal Appeals upon the First Peti-tion."Cone v. State, No. P-06874 (Tenn. Crim. Ct., Dec. 16,1993), p. 6. The Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the denial of relief on all grounds. Cone v. State, 927S. W. 2d 579, 582 (1995). The State Supreme Court deniedrespondent permission to appeal.IIIn 1997, respondent sought a writ of habeas corpus under28 U. S. C. $ 2254 in the United States District Court for theWestern District of Tennessee, again asserting a multitudeof claims. The District Court denied relief; it held respondent's vagueness challenge to the "especially heinous, atro-cious, or cruel" aggravating circumstance to be procedurallybarred by respondent's failure to raise it on direct appealin state court. The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuitsubsequently held that respondent was entitled to relief onanother ground and did not consider respondent's challengesto the aggravating circumstances found by the jury. Conev. Bell, 243 F. 3d 961, 975 (2001). We reversed that judgment. Bell v. Cone, 535 U. S. 685, 702 (2002).On remand, the same panel of the Sixth Circuit againgranted respondent a writ of habeas corpus, this time withone judge dissenting, on the ground that the "especially hei543US2 Unit: $U20 [03-06-07 15:37:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN451Cite as: 543 U. S. 447 (2005)Per Curiamnous, atrocious, or cruel" aggravator was unconstitutionallyvague under the Eighth Amendment. The court first rejected petitioner's argument that respondent procedurallydefaulted the claim in state court. Based on its understanding of state law, the court concluded that the State SupremeCourt's statutorily mandated review of each death sentence,see Tenn. Code Ann. $ 39-2-205(c)(1) (1982), necessarily included the consideration of constitutional deficiencies in theaggravating circumstances found by the jury and thereforethat the issue was "fairly presented" to the state court, evenif respondent did not raise it himself.3 359 F. 3d, at 791-793.Judge Norris dissented on this point. Id., at 806.Turning to the merits, the Sixth Circuit held that the statecourt's affirmance of respondent's sentence in light of the "especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel" aggravating circumstance was "contrary to" the clearly established principlesset forth in our decision in Godfrey v. Georgia, 446 U. S. 420(1980). The Court of Appeals allowed that "[n]o SupremeCourt case has addressed the precise language at issue," 359F. 3d, at 795, and that no "Supreme Court decisio[n] is `on all3 Petitioner argues that the Sixth Circuit's conclusion in this regard isin tension with the decisions of other Courts of Appeals, which have heldthat a petitioner must raise his constitutional claim in state court in orderto preserve it, notwithstanding the existence of a mandatory-review statute. See Mu'min v. Pruett, 125 F. 3d 192, 197 (CA4 1997) (Virginia);Martinez-Villareal v. Lewis, 80 F. 3d 1301, 1306 (CA9 1996) (Arizona);Kornahrens v. Evatt, 66 F. 3d 1350, 1362 (CA4 1995) (South Carolina);Nave v. Delo, 62 F. 3d 1024, 1039 (CA8 1995) (Missouri); Julius v. Johnson,840 F. 2d 1533, 1546 (CA11 1988) (Alabama). We find it unnecessary toexpress a view on this point. See 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(b)(2) (an applicationfor habeas corpus may be denied on the merits, notwithstanding a petitioner's failure to exhaust in state court). We do emphasize that, as a generalmatter, the burden is on the petitioner to raise his federal claim in thestate courts at a time when state procedural law permits its considerationon the merits, even if the state court could have identified and addressedthe federal question without its having been raised. See Baldwin v.Reese, 541 U. S. 27, 30-32 (2004).543US2 Unit: $U20 [03-06-07 15:37:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN452 BELL v.

S. 1 (1990) (per curiam), that federallaw dictated the conclusion that the State's "especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel" aggravator was unconstitutionallyvague.5 359 F. 3d, at 797. Lastly, the court rejected petitioner's argument that the Tennessee Supreme Court curedany deficiency in the aggravating circumstance on directappeal by reviewing the jury's finding under the narrowedconstruction of the aggravator that it adopted inState v.Dicks, 615 S. W. 2d 126 (1981). 359 F. 3d, at 797.IIIA federal court may grant a writ of habeas corpus basedon a claim adjudicated by a state court if the state-courtdecision "was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable ap-plication of, clearly established Federal law, as determinedby the Supreme Court of the United States." 28 U. S. C.$ 2254(d)(1). A state court's decision is "contrary to . . .clearly established Federal law" "if the state court applies a4 The jury was instructed with respect to this aggravated circumstanceas follows:" `Heinous' means extremely wicked or shockingly evil." `Atrocious' means outrageously wicked and vile." `Cruel' means designed to inflict a high degree of pain, utter indifferenceto, or enjoyment of, the suffering of others, pitiless." 359 F. 3d, at 794.5 The court recognized that these cases postdated the TennesseeSupreme Court's 1984 decision on direct appeal, but, relying on Stringerv. Black, 503 U. S. 222, 225 (1992) (which held that Cartwright did notannounce a "new rule" of constitutional law because its resolution wasdictated by Godfrey), concluded that these later cases were "not only material, but controlling" and required the conclusion that Tennessee's "heinous, atrocious, or cruel" aggravating circumstance was unconstitutionallyvague on its face. 359 F. 3d, at 795. We assume, without deciding, thatthe Court of Appeals was correct in this conclusion.543US2 Unit: $U20 [03-06-07 15:37:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN453Cite as: 543 U.

S. 362, 405 (2000).The law governing vagueness challenges to statutoryaggravating circumstances was summarized aptly in Walton,supra, overruled on other grounds, Ring v. Arizona, 536U. S. 584 (2002):"When a federal court is asked to review a statecourt's application of an individual statutory aggravat-ing or mitigating circumstance in a particular case, itmust first determine whether the statutory language defining the circumstance is itself too vague to provide anyguidance to the sentencer. If so, then the federal courtmust attempt to determine whether the state courtshave further defined the vague terms and, if they havedone so, whether those definitions are constitutionallysufficient,i. e., whether they provide some guidance tothe sentencer." Walton, supra, at 654.These principles were plain enough at the time the StateSupreme Court decided respondent's appeal. In Proffitt v.Florida, 428 U. S. 242 (1976), we upheld the aggravatingcircumstance that the murder was " `especially heinous, atro-cious, or cruel' " on the express ground that a narrowing construction had been adopted by that State's Supreme Court.Id., at 255 ( joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens,JJ.). And, in Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153 (1976), we re-fused to invalidate the aggravating circumstance that themurder was " `outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible orinhuman in that it involved torture, depravity of mind, or anaggravated battery to the victim,' " because "there [was] noreason to assume that the Supreme Court of Georgia willadopt . . . an open-ended construction" that is potentiallyapplicable to any murder. Id., at 201 ( joint opinion of543US2 Unit: $U20 [03-06-07 15:37:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN454 BELL v. CONEPer CuriamStewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.). See generally Lewis v.Jeffers, 497 U. S. 764, 774-777 (1990) (reviewing cases).Indeed, in Godfrey, 446 U. S. 420, the case on which theCourt of Appeals relied in declaring the aggravating circumstance to be unconstitutionally vague, the controlling plural-ity opinion followed precisely this procedure. Like thecourt below, the plurality looked first to the language of theaggravating circumstance found by the jury and concludedthat there was "nothing in these few words, standing alone,that implies any inherent restraint on the arbitrary and capricious infliction of the death sentence." Id., at 428. Butthe plurality did not stop there: It next evaluated whetherthe Georgia Supreme Court "applied a constitutional con-struction" of the aggravating circumstance on appeal.Id.,at 432. Because the facts of the case did not resemble thosein which the state court had previously applied a narrowerconstruction of the aggravating circumstance and becausethe state court gave no explanation for its decision otherthan to say that the verdict was " `factually substantiated,' "the plurality concluded that it did not. Id., at 432-433. Aswe have subsequently explained, this conclusion was thelinchpin of the Court's holding: "Had the Georgia SupremeCourt applied a narrowing construction of the aggravator,we would have rejected the Eighth Amendment challengeto Godfrey's death sentence, notwithstanding the failure toinstruct the jury on that narrowing construction." Lambrix v. Singletary, 520 U. S. 518, 531 (1997). See also Wal-ton, supra, at 653-654; Cartwright, supra, at 363-365 (refusing to countenance the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals'affirmance of a death sentence based on a facially vague aggravating circumstance where that court had not adopted anarrowing construction of its aggravator when it affirmedthe prisoner's sentence).66 In Ring v. Arizona, 536 U. S. 584 (2002), we held that the Sixth Amendment requires a jury, rather than a judge, to find the aggravating circumstance that renders a defendant death eligible. Id., at 609. Because543US2 Unit: $U20 [03-06-07 15:37:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN455Cite as: 543 U. S. 447 (2005)Per CuriamIn this case, however, the Sixth Circuit rejected the possi-bility that the Tennessee Supreme Court cured any error inthe jury instruction by applying a narrowing construction ofthe statutory "heinous, atrocious, or cruel" aggravator. Thecourt asserted that the State Supreme Court "did not apply,or even mention, any narrowing interpretation or cite to[sic] Dicks," the case in which the State Supreme Court hadadopted a narrowing construction of the aggravating circumstance. 359 F. 3d, at 797. "Instead," the court said, "the[state] court simply, but explicitly, satisfied itself that the labels `heinous, atrocious, or cruel,' without more, applied to[respondent's] crime."Ibid.We do not think that a federal court can presume so lightlythat a state court failed to apply its own law. As we havesaid before, $ 2254(d) dictates a " `highly deferential standardfor evaluating state-court rulings,' Lindh v. Murphy, 521U. S. 320, 333, n. 7 (1997), which demands that state-courtdecisions be given the benefit of the doubt." Woodford v.Visciotti, 537 U. S. 19, 24 (2002) (per curiam). To the ex-tent that the Court of Appeals rested its decision on thestate court's failure to cite Dicks, it was mistaken. Federalcourts are not free to presume that a state court did notcomply with constitutional dictates on the basis of nothingmore than a lack of citation. See Mitchell v. Esparza, 540U. S. 12, 16 (2003) (per curiam); Early v. Packer, 537 U. S.3, 8 (2002) (per curiam).More importantly, however, we find no basis for the Courtof Appeals' statement that the state court "simply, but explicitly, satisfied itself that the labels `heinous, atrocious, orcruel,' without more, applied" to the murder. 359 F. 3d, at797. The state court's opinion does not disclaim applicationof that court's established construction of the aggravatingRing does not apply retroactively, Schriro v. Summerlin, 542 U. S. 348,358 (2004), this case does not present the question whether an appellatecourt may, consistently with Ring, cure the finding of a vague aggravatingcircumstance by applying a narrower construction.543US2 Unit: $U20 [03-06-07 15:37:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN456 BELL v. CONEPer Curiamcircumstance; the only thing that it states "explicitly" is thatthe evidence in this case supported the jury's finding of thestatutory aggravator. See Cone, 665 S. W. 2d, at 95 (statingthat the aggravating circumstance was "indisputably established by the record"). As we explain below, the StateSupreme Court had construed the aggravating circumstancenarrowly and had followed that precedent numerous times;absent an affirmative indication to the contrary, we must pre-sume that it did the same thing here. SeeVisciotti, supra,at 24 (stating the presumption that state courts "know andfollow the law");Lambrix, supra, at 532, n. 4; Walton, 497U. S., at 653. That is especially true in a case such as thisone, where the state court has recognized that its narrowingconstruction is constitutionally compelled and has affirmatively assumed the responsibility to ensure that the aggravating circumstance is applied constitutionally in each case.See State v. Pritchett, 621 S. W. 2d 127, 139, 140 (Tenn. 1981).Even absent such a presumption in the state court's favor,however, we would still conclude in this case that the statecourt applied the narrower construction of the "heinous,atrocious, or cruel" aggravating circumstance. The StateSupreme Court's reasoning in this case closely tracked itsrationale for affirming the death sentences in other cases inwhich it expressly applied a narrowed construction of thesame "heinous, atrocious, or cruel" aggravator. Accord,Godfrey, supra, at 432 (holding that "[t]he circumstancesof this case . . . do not satisfy the criteria [for torture] laidout by the Georgia Supreme Court itself " in its cases construing the aggravating circumstance). The facts the courtrelied on to affirm the jury's verdict--that the elderly victims attempted to resist, that their deaths were not instantaneous, that respondent's actions toward them were "unspeakably brutal," and that they endured "terror, fright andhorror" before being killed, 665 S. W. 2d, at 95--match, almost exactly, the reasons the state court gave when it heldthe evidence in State v. Melson, 638 S. W. 2d 342, 367 (Tenn.543US2 Unit: $U20 [03-06-07 15:37:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN457Cite as: 543 U. S. 447 (2005)Per Curiam1982), to be sufficient to satisfy the torture prong of the nar-rowed "heinous, atrocious, or cruel" aggravating circumstance. See also Pritchett, supra, at 139 (finding the evi-dence to be insufficient to satisfy a narrowed construction ofthe aggravator where the victim's death was "instanta-neous"); State v. Campbell, 664 S. W. 2d 281, 284 (Tenn. 1984)(holding that evidence of the aggravator was "overwhelm-ing" where an elderly murder victim was beaten to deathwith a blunt object and his hands showed that he had at-tempted to defend himself). Similarly, the state court'sfindings that respondent's victims had been "brutally beatento death by multiple crushing blows to the skulls," that"[b]lood was spattered throughout the house," and that thevictims were helpless, 665 S. W. 2d, at 94-95, accord with thereasons that the state court had previously found sufficientto support findings of depravity of mind. See Melson,supra, at 367; State v. Groseclose, 615 S. W. 2d 142, 151 (Tenn.1981); Strouth v. State, 999 S. W. 2d 759, 766 (Tenn. 1999).In sum, a review of the state court's previous decisions interpreting and applying the narrowed construction of the "heinous, atrocious, or cruel" aggravator leaves little doubt thatthe State Supreme Court applied that same construction inrespondent's case.7The only remaining question is whether the narrowingconstruction that the Tennessee Supreme Court applied was7 We find additional support for this conclusion in the fact that respondent's argument to the State Supreme Court relied squarely on a casein which that court had expressly formulated its narrowing construction of the aggravating circumstance and had applied that constructionto the benefit of the defendant. See Brief for Appellant in No.02C019403CR00052 (Sup. Ct. Tenn. 1983), p. 20 (arguing, based on State v.Pritchett, 621 S. W. 2d 127 (Tenn. 1981), that "the State did not show . . .that the victims suffered"). Likewise, the two cases the State relied uponin response to respondent's argument also expressly applied a narrowingconstruction of the "heinous, atrocious, or cruel" aggravator. See Brieffor Appellee in No. 02C019403CR00052 (Sup. Ct. Tenn. 1983), p. 34 (citingPritchett, supra, and State v. Melson, 638 S.

It was not. In State v. Dicks,615 S. W. 2d 126 (Tenn. 1981), the state court adopted theexact construction of the aggravator that we approved inProffitt, 428 U. S., at 255: that the aggravator was "directedat `the conscienceless or pitiless crime which is unnecessarilytorturous to the victim,' " Dicks, supra, at 132. See alsoSochor v. Florida, 504 U. S. 527, 536 (1992). In light of Proffitt, we think this interpretation of the aggravator, standingalone, would be sufficient to overcome the claim that the ag-gravating circumstance applied by the state court was "contrary to" clearly established federal law under 28 U. S. C.$ 2254(d)(1).The State Supreme Court's subsequent application of thisaggravating circumstance, as construed inDicks, stands asfurther proof that it could be applied meaningfully to narrowthe class of death-eligible offenders. Later in the year thatDicks was decided, the court elaborated on the meaning ofthe aggravator:"Although the Tennessee aggravating circumstances[sic] [that the murder was heinous, atrocious, or cruel]does not contain the phrase, `an aggravated battery tothe victim[,]' it is clear that a constitutional constructionof this aggravating circumstance requires evidence thatthe defendant inflicted torture on the victim beforedeath or that [the] defendant committed acts evincing adepraved state of mind; that the depraved state of mindor the torture inflicted must meet the test of heinous,atrocious, or cruel." Pritchett, 621 S. W. 2d, at 139 (citation omitted).With respect to the meaning of "torture," the court held thatthe aggravator was not satisfied where the victim dies instantly, ibid., but that it was where "the uncontradictedproof shows that [the victim] had defensive injuries to herarms and hands, proving that there was time for her to real543US2 Unit: $U20 [03-06-07 15:37:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN459Cite as: 543 U.

S., at 364-365 (approving the limitation of the "hei-nous, atrocious, or cruel" aggravating circumstance to killings in which the victim suffered "some kind of torture orserious physical abuse" prior to the murder). As to "depravity of mind," the court held the fact that the defendantfired a second shotgun blast into a victim after he was deadto be insufficient as a matter of law, see Pritchett, supra, at139 (explaining that the depravity in such an action fallsshort of that exhibited by the defendant in Godfrey, supra),but concluded that, "a killing wherein the victim is struck upto thirty times, causing an entire room to be covered with aspray of flying blood, and causing the victim's brains to extrude through the gaping hole in her skull," sufficed, Melson,supra, at 367.8 In light of these holdings, we are satisfiedthat the State's aggravating circumstance, as construed bythe Tennessee Supreme Court, ensured that there was a"principled basis" for distinguishing between those cases inwhich the death penalty was assessed and those cases inwhich it was not.Arave v. Creech, 507 U. S. 463, 474 (1993).In sum, even assuming that the Court of Appeals was correct to conclude that the State's statutory aggravating cir-cumstance was facially vague, the court erred in presumingthat the State Supreme Court failed to cure this vaguenessby applying a narrowing construction on direct appeal. Thestate court did apply such a narrowing construction, and that8 See also State v. Groseclose, 615 S.
