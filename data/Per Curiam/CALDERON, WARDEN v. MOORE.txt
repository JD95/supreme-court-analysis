Respondent Charles Edward Moore, Jr., was convicted offirst-degree murder in a California state court, and sentenced to death. The District Court granted habeas relief,concluding that the state court had denied Moore his rightto self-representation under Faretta v. California, 422 U. S.806 (1975). The District Court thus vacated the judgmentof conviction and ordered the warden, petitioner here, to "re-lease Moore from custody after the expiration of 60 days unless, within 60 days hereof, the State of California grantsMoore the right to a new trial." App. A to Brief in Opposi-tion A65.The State filed a notice of appeal and sought a stay of theDistrict Court's order pending appeal, but its various stay518US1$74m 05-18-99 20:09:42 PAGES OPINPGT150 CALDERON v. MOOREPer Curiamapplications were respectively denied by the District Court,the Ninth Circuit, 56 F. 3d 39 (1995), and by Justice O'Connor, in her capacity as Circuit Justice for the Ninth Circuit.The State accordingly set Moore for retrial, and simultaneously pursued its appeal of the District Court's order on themerits to the Ninth Circuit. The Court of Appeals, observing that the "State of California has granted petitionerCharles Edward Moore, Jr., a new trial," dismissed theState's appeal as moot. App. A to Pet. for Cert.It is true, of course, that mootness can arise at any stageof litigation, Steffel v. Thompson, 415 U. S. 452, 459, n. 10(1974); that federal courts may not "give opinions upon mootquestions or abstract propositions," Mills v. Green, 159 U. S.651, 653 (1895); and that an appeal should therefore be dismissed as moot when, by virtue of an intervening event, acourt of appeals cannot grant "any effectual relief whatever"in favor of the appellant, ibid. The available remedy, however, does not need to be "fully satisfactory" to avoid mootness. Church of Scientology of Cal. v. United States, 506U. S. 9, 13 (1992). To the contrary, even the availability of a"partial remedy" is "sufficient to prevent [a] case from beingmoot." Ibid.In this case, to say the least, a "partial remedy" necessaryto avoid mootness will be available to the State of California(represented here by petitioner). While the administrativemachinery necessary for a new trial has been set in motion,that trial has not yet even begun, let alone reached a pointwhere the court could no longer award any relief in theState's favor. Because a decision in the State's favor wouldrelease it from the burden of the new trial itself, the Courtof Appeals is not prevented from granting "any effectual relief whatever" in the State's favor, Mills, supra, at 653, andthe case is clearly not moot. We therefore grant respondent's motion to proceed in forma pauperis, grant petitionfor a writ of certiorari, reverse the judgment of the Court518US1$74m 05-18-99 20:09:42 PAGES OPINPGT151Cite as: 518 U.
