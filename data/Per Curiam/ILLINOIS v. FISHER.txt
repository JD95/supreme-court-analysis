The Appellate Court of Illinois held here that the Four-teenth Amendment's Due Process Clause required the dismissal of criminal charges because the police, acting in goodfaith and according to normal police procedures, destroyedevidence that respondent had requested more than 10 yearsearlier in a discovery motion. Petitioner, the State of Illinois, contends that such a result is foreclosed by our decisioninArizona v. Youngblood, 488 U. S. 51 (1988). There weheld that "unless a criminal defendant can show bad faith onthe part of the police, failure to preserve potentially usefulevidence does not constitute a denial of due process of law."Id., at 58. We agree with petitioner, grant the petition forcertiorari and respondent's motion for leave to proceedinforma pauperis, and reverse the judgment of the AppellateCourt.In September 1988, Chicago police arrested respondent inthe course of a traffic stop during which police observed himfurtively attempting to conceal a plastic bag containing awhite powdery substance. Four tests conducted by the Chi-cago Police Crime Lab and the Illinois State Police CrimeLab confirmed that the bag seized from respondent con-tained cocaine.Respondent was charged with possession of cocaine in theCircuit Court of Cook County in October 1988. He filed amotion for discovery eight days later requesting all physicalevidence the State intended to use at trial. The State responded that all evidence would be made available at a rea-sonable time and date upon request. Respondent was released on bond pending trial. In July 1989, however, hefailed to appear in court, and the court issued an arrestwarrant to secure his presence. Respondent remained afugitive for over 10 years, apparently settling in Tennes-see. The outstanding arrest warrant was finally executedin November 1999, after respondent was detained on anunrelated matter. The State then reinstated the 1988cocaine-possession charge.540US2 Unit: $U18 [11-15-05 21:00:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN546 ILLINOIS v. FISHERPer CuriamBefore trial, the State informed respondent that in Sep-tember 1999, the police, acting in accord with establishedprocedures, had destroyed the substance seized from himduring his arrest. Respondent thereupon formally requested production of the substance and filed a motion todismiss the cocaine-possession charge based on the State'sdestruction of evidence. The trial court denied the motion,and the case proceeded to a jury trial. The State introducedevidence tending to prove the facts recounted above. Respondent's case in chief consisted solely of his own testimony,in which he denied that he ever possessed cocaine and insinuated that the police had "framed" him for the crime. Thejury returned a verdict of guilty, and respondent was sentenced to one year of imprisonment.The Appellate Court reversed the conviction, holding thatthe Due Process Clause required dismissal of the charge.Relying on the Illinois Supreme Court's decision inIllinoisv. Newberry, 166 Ill. 2d 310, 652 N. E. 2d 288 (1995), theAppellate Court reasoned:" `Where evidence is requested by the defense in a dis-covery motion, the State is on notice that the evidencemust be preserved, and the defense is not requiredto make an independent showing that the evidence hasexculpatory value in order to establish a due processviolation. If the State proceeds to destroy the evi-dence, appropriate sanctions may be imposed even if thedestruction is inadvertent. No showing of bad faith isnecessary.' " App. to Pet. for Cert. 12 (quotingNewberry, supra, at 317, 652 N. E. 2d, at 292) (citation omitted in original).The Appellate Court observed that Newberry distinguishedour decision in Youngblood on the ground that the police inYoungblood did not destroy evidence subsequent to a discovery motion by the defendant. App. to Pet. for Cert. 13.While acknowledging that "there is nothing in the record to540US2 Unit: $U18 [11-15-05 21:00:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN547Cite as: 540 U. S. 544 (2004)Per Curiamindicate that the alleged cocaine was destroyed in bad faith,"id., at 15, the court further determined that Newberry dictated dismissal because, unlike in Youngblood, the destroyedevidence provided respondent's "only hope for exoneration,"App. to Pet. for Cert. 15, and was " `essential to and determinative of the outcome of the case,' " App. to Pet. for Cert.16 (quoting Newberry, supra, at 315, 652 N. E. 2d, at 291).Consequently, the court concluded that respondent "was denied due process when he was tried subsequent to the destruction of the alleged cocaine." App. to Pet. for Cert. 16.The Illinois Supreme Court denied leave to appeal.*We have held that when the State suppresses or fails todisclose material exculpatory evidence, the good or bad faithof the prosecution is irrelevant: a due process violation occurs whenever such evidence is withheld. See Brady v.Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963); United States v. Agurs, 427U. S. 97 (1976). In Youngblood, by contrast, we recognizedthat the Due Process Clause "requires a different resultwhen we deal with the failure of the State to preserve evidentiary material of which no more can be said than that itcould have been subjected to tests, the results of whichmight have exonerated the defendant." 488 U. S., at 57.We concluded that the failure to preserve this "potentially*Respondent suggests that we lack jurisdiction because the AppellateCourt relied on Newberry, which in turn relied on an adequate and independent state ground. See, e. g., Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032, 1040-1042 (1983). Respondent is correct that Newberry relied on both the DueProcess Clause, and in the alternative, Illinois Supreme Court Rule415(g)(i) (1990). 166 Ill. 2d, at 314-317, 652 N. E. 2d, at 290-292. TheAppellate Court, however, relied only on the portion of Newberry thataddressed due process, and the Appellate Court based its decision solelyon the Due Process Clause. Accordingly, we have jurisdiction to reviewthat decision. See, e. g., Long, supra, at 1038, n. 4 ("We may review astate case decided on a federal ground even if it is clear that there was anavailable state ground for decision on which the state court could properlyhave relied" (citing Beecher v. Alabama, 389 U. S. 35, 37, n. 3 (1967) (percuriam))).540US2 Unit: $U18 [11-15-05 21:00:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN548 ILLINOIS v. FISHERPer Curiamuseful evidence" does not violate due process "unless a criminal defendant can show bad faith on the part of the police."Id., at 58 (emphasis added).The substance seized from respondent was plainly the sortof "potentially useful evidence" referred to in Youngblood,not the material exculpatory evidence addressed inBradyand Agurs. At most, respondent could hope that, had theevidence been preserved, a fifth test conducted on the sub-stance would have exonerated him. SeeYoungblood, 488U. S., at 57. But respondent did not allege, nor did the Ap-pellate Court find, that the Chicago police acted in bad faithwhen they destroyed the substance. Quite the contrary, police testing indicated that the chemical makeup of the substance inculpated, not exculpated, respondent, see id., at 57,n., and it is undisputed that police acted in "good faith andin accord with their normal practice," id., at 56 (internalquotation marks omitted) (quoting California v. Trombetta,467 U. S. 479, 488 (1984), in turn quoting Killian v. UnitedStates, 368 U. S. 231, 242 (1961)). Under Youngblood, then,respondent has failed to establish a due process violation.We have never held or suggested that the existence ofa pending discovery request eliminates the necessity ofshowing bad faith on the part of police. Indeed, the resultreached in this case demonstrates why such a per se rulewould negate the very reason we adopted the bad-faith requirement in the first place: to "limi[t] the extent of the police's obligation to preserve evidence to reasonable groundsand confin[e] it to that class of cases where the interests ofjustice most clearly require it." 488 U. S., at 58.We also disagree that Youngblood does not apply whenever the contested evidence provides a defendant's "onlyhope for exoneration" and is " `essential to and determinativeof the outcome of the case.' " App. to Pet. for Cert. 15-16(citing Newberry, supra, at 315, 652 N. E. 2d, at 291). InYoungblood, the Arizona Court of Appeals said that the destroyed evidence "could [have] eliminate[d] the defendant540US2 Unit: $U18 [11-15-05 21:00:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN549Cite as: 540 U. S. 544 (2004)Stevens, J., concurring in judgmentas the perpetrator." 488 U. S., at 54 (quotation marks andcitations omitted). Similarly here, an additional test mighthave provided the defendant with an opportunity to showthat the police tests were mistaken. It is thus difficult todistinguish the two cases on this basis. But in any event,the applicability of the bad-faith requirement in Youngblooddepended not on the centrality of the contested evidence tothe prosecution's case or the defendant's defense, but on thedistinction between "material exculpatory" evidence and"potentially useful" evidence. 488 U. S., at 57-58. As wehave held, supra, at 548, the substance destroyed here was,at best, "potentially useful" evidence, and thereforeYoung-blood's bad-faith requirement applies.The judgment of the Appellate Court of Illinois is re-versed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings notinconsistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.Justice Stevens, concurring in the judgment.While I did not join the three Justices who dissented inArizona v. Youngblood, 488 U. S. 51 (1988), I also declinedto join the majority opinion because I was convinced then,and remain convinced today, that "there may well be casesin which the defendant is unable to prove that the Stateacted in bad faith but in which the loss or destruction ofevidence is nonetheless so critical to the defense as to makea criminal trial fundamentally unfair." Id., at 61 (Stevens,J., concurring in judgment).* This, like Youngblood, is notsuch a case.*Youngblood's focus on the subjective motivation of the police represents a break with our usual understanding that the presence or absenceof constitutional error in suppression of evidence cases depends on thecharacter of the evidence, not the character of the person who withholdsit. United States v. Agurs, 427 U. S. 97, 110 (1976). Since Youngbloodwas decided, a number of state courts have held as a matter of state constitutional law that the loss or destruction of evidence critical to the defensedoes violate due process, even in the absence of bad faith.

RAMIREZ et al.certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuitNo. 02-811. Argued November 4, 2003--Decided February 24, 2004Petitioner, a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agent, preparedand signed an application for a warrant to search respondents' Montanaranch, which stated that the search was for specified weapons, explosives, and records. The application was supported by petitioner's detailed affidavit setting forth his basis for believing that such items wereon the ranch and was accompanied by a warrant form that he completed.The Magistrate Judge (Magistrate) signed the warrant form eventhough it did not identify any of the items that petitioner intended toseize. The portion calling for a description of the "person or property"described respondents' house, not the alleged weapons; the warrant didnot incorporate by reference the application's itemized list. Petitionerled federal and local law enforcement officers to the ranch the next daybut found no illegal weapons or explosives. Petitioner left a copy ofthe warrant, but not the application, with respondents. Respondentssued petitioner and others under Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. NarcoticsAgents, 403 U. S. 388, and 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, claiming, inter alia, aFourth Amendment violation. The District Court granted the defendants summary judgment, finding no Fourth Amendment violation, andfinding that even if such a violation occurred, the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity. The Ninth Circuit affirmed except as to theFourth Amendment claim against petitioner, holding that the warrantwas invalid because it did not describe with particularity the place tobe searched and the items to be seized. The court also concluded thatUnited States v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897, precluded qualified immunity forpetitioner because he was the leader of a search who did not read thewarrant and satisfy himself that he understood its scope and limitationsand that it was not obviously defective.Held:1. The search was clearly "unreasonable" under the Fourth Amendment. Pp. 557-563.(a) The warrant was plainly invalid. It did not meet the FourthAmendment's unambiguous requirement that a warrant "particularlydescrib[e] . . . the persons or things to be seized." The fact that theapplication adequately described those things does not save the warrant;Fourth Amendment interests are not necessarily vindicated when an540US2 Unit: $U19 [11-01-05 13:37:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN552 GROH v. RAMIREZSyllabusother document says something about the objects of the search, but thatdocument's contents are neither known to the person whose home isbeing searched nor available for her inspection. It is not necessary todecide whether the Amendment permits a warrant to cross-referenceother documents, because such incorporation did not occur here.Pp. 557-558.(b) Petitioner's argument that the search was nonetheless reasonable is rejected. Because the warrant did not describe the items atall, it was so obviously deficient that the search must be regarded aswarrantless, and thus presumptively unreasonable. This presumptiverule applies to searches whose only defect is a lack of particularity inthe warrant. Petitioner errs in arguing that such searches should beexempt from the presumption if they otherwise satisfy the particularityrequirement's goals. Unless items in the affidavit are set forth in thewarrant, there is no written assurance that the Magistrate actuallyfound probable cause for a search as broad as the affiant requested.The restraint petitioner showed in conducting the instant search wasimposed by the agent himself, not a judicial officer. Moreover, the particularity requirement's purpose is not limited to preventing generalsearches; it also assures the individual whose property is searched andseized of the executing officer's legal authority, his need to search, andthe limits of his power to do so. This case presents no occasion to reachpetitioner's argument that the particularity requirements' goals wereserved when he orally described the items to respondents, because respondents dispute his account. Pp. 558-563.2. Petitioner is not entitled to qualified immunity despite the constitutional violation because "it would be clear to a reasonable officer thathis conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted," Saucier v.Katz, 533 U. S. 194, 202. Given that the particularity requirement isstated in the Constitution's text, no reasonable officer could believe thata warrant that did not comply with that requirement was valid. Moreover, because petitioner prepared the warrant, he may not argue thathe reasonably relied on the Magistrate's assurance that it contained anadequate description and was valid. Nor could a reasonable officerclaim to be unaware of the basic rule that, absent consent or exigency,a warrantless search of a home is presumptively unconstitutional. "[A]warrant may be so facially deficient . . . that the executing officers cannot reasonably presume it to be valid." Leon, 468 U. S., at 923. Thisis such a case.

RAMIREZOpinion of the CourtIRespondents, Joseph Ramirez and members of his family,live on a large ranch in Butte-Silver Bow County, Montana.Petitioner, Jeff Groh, has been a Special Agent for the Bu-reau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) since 1989. InFebruary 1997, a concerned citizen informed petitioner thaton a number of visits to respondents' ranch the visitor hadseen a large stock of weaponry, including an automatic rifle,grenades, a grenade launcher, and a rocket launcher.1 Basedon that information, petitioner prepared and signed an appli-cation for a warrant to search the ranch. The applicationstated that the search was for "any automatic firearms orparts to automatic weapons, destructive devices to includebut not limited to grenades, grenade launchers, rocketlaunchers, and any and all receipts pertaining to the purchase or manufacture of automatic weapons or explosive de-vices or launchers." App. to Pet. for Cert. 28a. Petitionersupported the application with a detailed affidavit, which healso prepared and executed, that set forth the basis for hisbelief that the listed items were concealed on the ranch.Petitioner then presented these documents to a Magistrate,along with a warrant form that petitioner also had com-pleted. The Magistrate signed the warrant form.Although the application particularly described the placeto be searched and the contraband petitioner expected tofind, the warrant itself was less specific; it failed to identifyany of the items that petitioner intended to seize. In theportion of the form that called for a description of the "per-son or property" to be seized, petitioner typed a descriptionof respondents' two-story blue house rather than the allegedstockpile of firearms.2 The warrant did not incorporate by1 Possession of these items, if unregistered, would violate 18 U. S. C.$ 922(o)(1) and 26 U. S. C. $ 5861.2 The warrant stated: "[T]here is now concealed [on the specified premises] a certain person or property, namely [a] single dwelling residence twostory in height which is blue in color and has two additions attached to540US2 Unit: $U19 [11-01-05 13:37:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN555Cite as: 540 U. S. 551 (2004)Opinion of the Courtreference the itemized list contained in the application. Itdid, however, recite that the Magistrate was satisfied the affidavit established probable cause to believe that contrabandwas concealed on the premises, and that sufficient groundsexisted for the warrant's issuance.3The day after the Magistrate issued the warrant, petitioner led a team of law enforcement officers, including bothfederal agents and members of the local sheriff 's department, in the search of respondents' premises. Althoughrespondent Joseph Ramirez was not home, his wife andchildren were. Petitioner states that he orally describedthe objects of the search to Mrs. Ramirez in person andto Mr. Ramirez by telephone. According to Mrs. Ramirez,however, petitioner explained only that he was searching for" `an explosive device in a box.' " Ramirez v. Butte-SilverBow County, 298 F. 3d 1022, 1026 (CA9 2002). At any rate,the officers' search uncovered no illegal weapons or explosives. When the officers left, petitioner gave Mrs. Ramireza copy of the search warrant, but not a copy of the application, which had been sealed. The following day, in re-sponse to a request from respondents' attorney, petitionerfaxed the attorney a copy of the page of the application thatlisted the items to be seized. No charges were filed againstthe Ramirezes.Respondents sued petitioner and the other officers underBivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388(1971), and Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, raising eightclaims, including violation of the Fourth Amendment. App.17-27. The District Court entered summary judgment forall defendants. The court found no Fourth Amendment vio-lation, because it considered the case comparable to one inwhich the warrant contained an inaccurate address, and insuch a case, the court reasoned, the warrant is sufficientlythe east. The front entrance to the residence faces in a southerly direction." App. to Pet. for Cert. 26a.3 The affidavit was sealed. Its sufficiency is not disputed.540US2 Unit: $U19 [11-01-05 13:37:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN556 GROH v. RAMIREZOpinion of the Courtdetailed if the executing officers can locate the correct house.App. to Pet. for Cert. 20a-22a. The court added that evenif a constitutional violation occurred, the defendants wereentitled to qualified immunity because the failure of the warrant to describe the objects of the search amounted to a mere"typographical error."Id., at 22a-24a.The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment with respectto all defendants and all claims, with the exception of re-spondents' Fourth Amendment claim against petitioner.298 F. 3d, at 1029-1030. On that claim, the court held thatthe warrant was invalid because it did not "describe withparticularity the place to be searched and the items to beseized," and that oral statements by petitioner during orafter the search could not cure the omission. Id., at 1025-1026. The court observed that the warrant's facial defect"increased the likelihood and degree of confrontation between the Ramirezes and the police" and deprived respondents of the means "to challenge officers who might have exceeded the limits imposed by the magistrate." Id., at 1027.The court also expressed concern that "permitting officers toexpand the scope of the warrant by oral statements wouldbroaden the area of dispute between the parties in subsequent litigation." Ibid. The court nevertheless concludedthat all of the officers except petitioner were protected byqualified immunity. With respect to petitioner, the courtread our opinion in United States v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897(1984), as precluding qualified immunity for the leader of asearch who fails to "read the warrant and satisfy [himself]that [he] understand[s] its scope and limitations, and that itis not defective in some obvious way." 298 F. 3d, at 1027.The court added that "[t]he leaders of the search team mustalso make sure that a copy of the warrant is available togive to the person whose property is being searched at thecommencement of the search, and that such copy has no missing pages or other obvious defects." Ibid. (footnote omitted). We granted certiorari. 537 U. S. 1231 (2003).540US2 Unit: $U19 [11-01-05 13:37:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN557Cite as: 540 U. S. 551 (2004)Opinion of the CourtIIThe warrant was plainly invalid. The Fourth Amendmentstates unambiguously that "no Warrants shall issue, but uponprobable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the personsor things to be seized." (Emphasis added.) The warrant inthis case complied with the first three of these requirements:It was based on probable cause and supported by a swornaffidavit, and it described particularly the place of the search.On the fourth requirement, however, the warrant failed altogether. Indeed, petitioner concedes that "the warrant . . .was deficient in particularity because it provided no description of the type of evidence sought." Brief for Petitioner 10.The fact that theapplication adequately described the"things to be seized" does not save the warrant from itsfacial invalidity. The Fourth Amendment by its terms re-quires particularity in the warrant, not in the supportingdocuments. See Massachusetts v. Sheppard, 468 U. S. 981,988, n. 5 (1984) ("[A] warrant that fails to conform to theparticularity requirement of the Fourth Amendment is un-constitutional"); see also United States v. Stefonek, 179 F. 3d1030, 1033 (CA7 1999) ("The Fourth Amendment requiresthat the warrant particularly describe the things to beseized, not the papers presented to the judicial officer . . .asked to issue the warrant" (emphasis in original)). And forgood reason: "The presence of a search warrant serves a highfunction,"McDonald v. United States, 335 U. S. 451, 455(1948), and that high function is not necessarily vindicatedwhen some other document, somewhere, says somethingabout the objects of the search, but the contents of that document are neither known to the person whose home is beingsearched nor available for her inspection. We do not saythat the Fourth Amendment prohibits a warrant from cross-referencing other documents. Indeed, most Courts of Appeals have held that a court may construe a warrant withreference to a supporting application or affidavit if the war540US2 Unit: $U19 [11-01-05 13:37:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN558 GROH v. RAMIREZOpinion of the Courtrant uses appropriate words of incorporation, and if thesupporting document accompanies the warrant. See,e. g.,United States v. McGrew, 122 F. 3d 847, 849-850 (CA9 1997);United States v. Williamson, 1 F. 3d 1134, 1136, n. 1 (CA101993); United States v. Blakeney, 942 F. 2d 1001, 1025-1026(CA6 1991);United States v. Maxwell, 920 F. 2d 1028, 1031(CADC 1990); United States v. Curry, 911 F. 2d 72, 76-77(CA8 1990); United States v. Roche, 614 F. 2d 6, 8 (CA1 1980).But in this case the warrant did not incorporate other documents by reference, nor did either the affidavit or the appli-cation (which had been placed under seal) accompany thewarrant. Hence, we need not further explore the matterof incorporation.Petitioner argues that even though the warrant was invalid, the search nevertheless was "reasonable" within themeaning of the Fourth Amendment. He notes that a Magistrate authorized the search on the basis of adequate evidenceof probable cause, that petitioner orally described to respondents the items to be seized, and that the search did notexceed the limits intended by the Magistrate and describedby petitioner. Thus, petitioner maintains, his search of respondents' ranch was functionally equivalent to a search authorized by a valid warrant.We disagree. This warrant did not simply omit a fewitems from a list of many to be seized, or misdescribe a fewof several items. Nor did it make what fairly could be characterized as a mere technical mistake or typographical error.Rather, in the space set aside for a description of the itemsto be seized, the warrant stated that the items consisted ofa "single dwelling residence . . . blue in color." In otherwords, the warrant did not describe the items to be seizedat all. In this respect the warrant was so obviously deficient that we must regard the search as "warrantless" withinthe meaning of our case law. See Leon, 468 U. S., at 923; cf.Maryland v. Garrison, 480 U. S. 79, 85 (1987); Steele v.United States, 267 U. S. 498, 503-504 (1925). "We are not540US2 Unit: $U19 [11-01-05 13:37:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN559Cite as: 540 U.

United States, 533 U. S. 27, 31 (2001) (quotingSilverman v. United States, 365 U. S. 505, 511 (1961)), ourcases have firmly established the " `basic principle of FourthAmendment law' that searches and seizures inside a homewithout a warrant are presumptively unreasonable," Paytonv.New York, 445 U. S. 573, 586 (1980) (footnote omitted).Thus, "absent exigent circumstances, a warrantless entry tosearch for weapons or contraband is unconstitutional evenwhen a felony has been committed and there is probablecause to believe that incriminating evidence will be foundwithin." Id., at 587-588 (footnote omitted). See Kyllo, 533U. S., at 29; Illinois v. Rodriguez, 497 U. S. 177, 181 (1990);Chimel v. California, 395 U. S. 752, 761-763 (1969); McDonald, 335 U. S., at 454; Johnson v. United States, 333 U. S.10 (1948).We have clearly stated that the presumptive rule againstwarrantless searches applies with equal force to searcheswhose only defect is a lack of particularity in the warrant.InSheppard, for instance, the petitioner argued that eventhough the warrant was invalid for lack of particularity, "thesearch was constitutional because it was reasonable withinthe meaning of the Fourth Amendment." 468 U. S., at 988,n. 5. In squarely rejecting that position, we explained:"The uniformly applied rule is that a search conductedpursuant to a warrant that fails to conform to the particularity requirement of the Fourth Amendment is uncon-stitutional.Stanford v. Texas, 379 U. S. 476 (1965);United States v. Cardwell, 680 F. 2d 75, 77-78 (CA91982); United States v. Crozier, 674 F. 2d 1293, 1299(CA9 1982); United States v.

That rule is in keeping with the well-established principle that `except in certain carefullydefined classes of cases, a search of private propertywithout proper consent is "unreasonable" unless it hasbeen authorized by a valid search warrant.' Camarav. Municipal Court, 387 U. S. 523, 528-529 (1967). SeeSteagald v. United States, 451 U. S. 204, 211-212 (1981);Jones v. United States, 357 U. S. 493, 499 (1958)." Ibid.Petitioner asks us to hold that a search conducted pursuantto a warrant lacking particularity should be exempt from thepresumption of unreasonableness if the goals served by theparticularity requirement are otherwise satisfied. He maintains that the search in this case satisfied those goals--whichhe says are "to prevent general searches, to prevent the seizure of one thing under a warrant describing another, andto prevent warrants from being issued on vague or dubiousinformation," Brief for Petitioner 16--because the scope ofthe search did not exceed the limits set forth in the application. But unless the particular items described in the affi-davit are also set forth in the warrant itself (or at least incorporated by reference, and the affidavit present at the search),there can be no written assurance that the Magistrate actually found probable cause to search for, and to seize, everyitem mentioned in the affidavit. SeeMcDonald, 335 U. S.,at 455 ("Absent some grave emergency, the Fourth Amendment has interposed a magistrate between the citizen andthe police. This was done . . . so that an objective mindmight weigh the need to invade [the citizen's] privacy inorder to enforce the law"). In this case, for example, it is atleast theoretically possible that the Magistrate was satisfiedthat the search for weapons and explosives was justified bythe showing in the affidavit, but not convinced that any evi-dentiary basis existed for rummaging through respondents'files and papers for receipts pertaining to the purchase ormanufacture of such items. Cf.Stanford v. Texas, 379 U. S.476, 485-486 (1965). Or, conceivably, the Magistrate might540US2 Unit: $U19 [11-01-05 13:37:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN561Cite as: 540 U. S. 551 (2004)Opinion of the Courthave believed that some of the weapons mentioned in theaffidavit could have been lawfully possessed and thereforeshould not be seized. See 26 U. S. C. $ 5861 (requiring reg-istration, but not banning possession of, certain firearms).The mere fact that the Magistrate issued a warrant does notnecessarily establish that he agreed that the scope of thesearch should be as broad as the affiant's request. Eventhough petitioner acted with restraint in conducting thesearch, "the inescapable fact is that this restraint was im-posed by the agents themselves, not by a judicial officer."Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347, 356 (1967).4We have long held, moreover, that the purpose of the particularity requirement is not limited to the prevention ofgeneral searches. SeeGarrison, 480 U. S., at 84. A partic-ular warrant also "assures the individual whose property issearched or seized of the lawful authority of the executingofficer, his need to search, and the limits of his power tosearch." United States v. Chadwick, 433 U. S. 1, 9 (1977)(citingCamara v. Municipal Court of City and County ofSan Francisco, 387 U. S. 523, 532 (1967)), abrogated on othergrounds, California v. Acevedo, 500 U. S. 565 (1991). Seealso Illinois v. Gates, 462 U. S. 213, 236 (1983) ("[P]ossession4 For this reason petitioner's argument that any constitutional error wascommitted by the Magistrate, not petitioner, is misplaced. In Massachusetts v. Sheppard, 468 U. S. 981 (1984), we suggested that "the judge, notthe police officers," may have committed "[a]n error of constitutional dimension," id., at 990, because the judge had assured the officers requestingthe warrant that he would take the steps necessary to conform the warrant to constitutional requirements, id., at 986. Thus, "it was not unreasonable for the police in [that] case to rely on the judge's assurances thatthe warrant authorized the search they had requested." Id., at 989, n. 6.In this case, by contrast, petitioner did not alert the Magistrate to thedefect in the warrant that petitioner had drafted, and we therefore cannotknow whether the Magistrate was aware of the scope of the search hewas authorizing. Nor would it have been reasonable for petitioner to relyon a warrant that was so patently defective, even if the Magistrate wasaware of the deficiency. See United States v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897, 915,922, n. 23 (1984).540US2 Unit: $U19 [11-01-05 13:37:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN562 GROH v. RAMIREZOpinion of the Courtof a warrant by officers conducting an arrest or searchgreatly reduces the perception of unlawful or intrusive police conduct").5Petitioner argues that even if the goals of the particularityrequirement are broader than he acknowledges, those goalsnevertheless were served because he orally described to respondents the items for which he was searching. Thus, hesubmits, respondents had all of the notice that a proper warrant would have accorded. But this case presents no occa-sion even to reach this argument, since respondents, as notedabove, dispute petitioner 's account. According to Mrs.Ramirez, petitioner stated only that he was looking for an" `explosive device in a box.' " 298 F. 3d, at 1026. Becausethis dispute is before us on petitioner's motion for summaryjudgment, App. to Pet. for Cert. 13a, "[t]he evidence of thenonmovant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences areto be drawn in [her] favor," Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.,477 U. S. 242, 255 (1986) (citation omitted). The posture ofthe case therefore obliges us to credit Mrs. Ramirez's ac-count, and we find that petitioner's description of " `an explo5 It is true, as petitioner points out, that neither the Fourth Amendmentnor Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires the executing officer to serve the warrant on the owner before commencing thesearch. Rule 41(f)(3) provides that "[t]he officer executing the warrantmust: (A) give a copy of the warrant and a receipt for the property takento the person from whom, or from whose premises, the property wastaken; or (B) leave a copy of the warrant and receipt at the place wherethe officer took the property." Quite obviously, in some circumstances--a surreptitious search by means of a wiretap, for example, or the searchof empty or abandoned premises--it will be impracticable or imprudentfor the officers to show the warrant in advance. See Katz v. UnitedStates, 389 U. S. 347, 355, n. 16 (1967); Ker v. California, 374 U. S. 23,37-41 (1963). Whether it would be unreasonable to refuse a request tofurnish the warrant at the outset of the search when, as in this case, anoccupant of the premises is present and poses no threat to the officers'safe and effective performance of their mission, is a question that this casedoes not present.540US2 Unit: $U19 [11-01-05 13:37:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN563Cite as: 540 U. S. 551 (2004)Opinion of the Courtsive device in a box' " was little better than no guidance atall. See Stefonek, 179 F. 3d, at 1032-1033 (holding that asearch warrant for " `evidence of crime' " was "[s]o open-ended" in its description that it could "only be described asa general warrant").It is incumbent on the officer executing a search warrantto ensure the search is lawfully authorized and lawfully con-ducted.6 Because petitioner did not have in his possessiona warrant particularly describing the things he intended toseize, proceeding with the search was clearly "unreasonable"under the Fourth Amendment. The Court of Appeals cor-rectly held that the search was unconstitutional.IIIHaving concluded that a constitutional violation occurred,we turn to the question whether petitioner is entitled toqualified immunity despite that violation. See Wilson v.Layne, 526 U. S. 603, 609 (1999). The answer depends onwhether the right that was transgressed was " `clearly established' "--that is, "whether it would be clear to a reasonableofficer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted." Saucier v. Katz, 533 U. S. 194, 202 (2001).Given that the particularity requirement is set forth in thetext of the Constitution, no reasonable officer could believethat a warrant that plainly did not comply with that require-ment was valid. SeeHarlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800,818-819 (1982) ("If the law was clearly established, the im6 The Court of Appeals' decision is consistent with this principle. Petitioner mischaracterizes the court's decision when he contends that it imposed a novel proofreading requirement on officers executing warrants.The court held that officers leading a search team must "mak[e] sure thatthey have a proper warrant that in fact authorizes the search and seizurethey are about to conduct." 298 F. 3d 1022, 1027 (CA9 2002). That is nota duty to proofread; it is, rather, a duty to ensure that the warrant conforms to constitutional requirements.540US2 Unit: $U19 [11-01-05 13:37:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN564 GROH v. RAMIREZOpinion of the Courtmunity defense ordinarily should fail, since a reasonablycompetent public official should know the law governing hisconduct"). Moreover, because petitioner himself preparedthe invalid warrant, he may not argue that he reasonablyrelied on the Magistrate's assurance that the warrant contained an adequate description of the things to be seized andwas therefore valid. Cf. Sheppard, 468 U. S., at 989-990.In fact, the guidelines of petitioner's own department placedhim on notice that he might be liable for executing a manifestly invalid warrant. An ATF directive in force at thetime of this search warned: "Special agents are liable if theyexceed their authority while executing a search warrant andmust be sure that a search warrant is sufficient on its faceeven when issued by a magistrate." Searches and Examinations, ATF Order O 3220.1(7)(d) (Feb. 13, 1997). See also id.,at 3220.1(23)(b) ("If any error or deficiency is discovered andthere is a reasonable probability that it will invalidate thewarrant, such warrant shall not be executed. The searchshall be postponed until a satisfactory warrant has been obtained").7 And even a cursory reading of the warrant in thiscase--perhaps just a simple glance--would have revealed aglaring deficiency that any reasonable police officer wouldhave known was constitutionally fatal.No reasonable officer could claim to be unaware of thebasic rule, well established by our cases, that, absent consentor exigency, a warrantless search of the home is presumptively unconstitutional. See Payton, 445 U. S., at 586-588.Indeed, as we noted nearly 20 years ago in Sheppard: "Theuniformly applied rule is that a search conducted pursuantto a warrant that fails to conform to the particularity requirement of the Fourth Amendment is unconstitutional."7 We do not suggest that an official is deprived of qualified immunitywhenever he violates an internal guideline. We refer to the ATF Orderonly to underscore that petitioner should have known that he should notexecute a patently defective warrant.540US2 Unit: $U19 [11-01-05 13:37:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN565Cite as: 540 U. S. 551 (2004)Opinion of the Court468 U. S., at 988, n. 5.8 Because not a word in any of ourcases would suggest to a reasonable officer that this case fitswithin any exception to that fundamental tenet, petitioner isasking us, in effect, to craft a new exception. Absent anysupport for such an exception in our cases, he cannot reason-ably have relied on an expectation that we would do so.Petitioner contends that the search in this case was theproduct, at worst, of a lack of due care, and that our case lawrequires more than negligent behavior before depriving anofficial of qualified immunity. SeeMalley v. Briggs, 475U. S. 335, 341 (1986). But as we observed in the companioncase to Sheppard, "a warrant may be so facially deficient--i. e., in failing to particularize the place to be searched orthe things to be seized--that the executing officers cannotreasonably presume it to be valid." Leon, 468 U. S., at 923.This is such a case.98 Although both Sheppard and Leon involved the application of the "goodfaith" exception to the Fourth Amendment's general exclusionary rule, wehave explained that "the same standard of objective reasonableness thatwe applied in the context of a suppression hearing in Leon defines thequalified immunity accorded an officer." Malley v. Briggs, 475 U. S. 335,344 (1986) (citation omitted).9 Justice Kennedy argues in dissent that we have not allowed " `ampleroom for mistaken judgments,' " post, at 571 (quoting Malley, 475 U. S., at343), because "difficult and important tasks demand the officer's full attention in the heat of an ongoing and often dangerous criminal investigation,"post, at 568. In this case, however, petitioner does not contend that anysort of exigency existed when he drafted the affidavit, the warrant application, and the warrant, or when he conducted the search. This is not thesituation, therefore, in which we have recognized that "officers in the dangerous and difficult process of making arrests and executing search warrants" require "some latitude." Maryland v. Garrison, 480 U. S. 79, 87(1987).Nor are we according "the correctness of paper forms" a higher statusthan "substantive rights." Post, at 571. As we have explained, theFourth Amendment's particularity requirement assures the subject of thesearch that a magistrate has duly authorized the officer to conduct asearch of limited scope. This substantive right is not protected when theofficer fails to take the time to glance at the authorizing document and540US2 Unit: $U19 [11-01-05 13:37:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN566 GROH v.
