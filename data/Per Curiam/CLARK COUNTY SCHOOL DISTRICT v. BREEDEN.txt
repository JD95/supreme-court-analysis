Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat.255, as amended, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-3(a), it is unlawful"for an employer to discriminate against any of his employees . . . because [the employee] has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by [Title VII],or because [the employee] has made a charge, testified,assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation,proceeding, or hearing under [Title VII]." In 1997, respondent filed a $ 2000e-3(a) retaliation claim against petitionerClark County School District. The claim as eventuallyamended alleged that petitioner had taken two separate adverse employment actions against her in response to two different protected activities in which she had engaged. TheDistrict Court granted summary judgment to petitioner,No. CV-S-97-365-DWH(RJJ) (D. Nev., Feb. 9, 1999), but apanel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversedover the dissent of Judge Fernandez, No. 99-15522, 2000 WL991821 (July 19, 2000) (per curiam) (unpublished), judgt.order reported at 232 F. 3d 893. We grant the writ of certiorari and reverse.On October 21, 1994, respondent's male supervisor metwith respondent and another male employee to review thepsychological evaluation reports of four job applicants. Thereport for one of the applicants disclosed that the applicanthad once commented to a co-worker, "I hear making loveto you is like making love to the Grand Canyon." Brief inOpposition 3. At the meeting respondent's supervisor readthe comment aloud, looked at respondent and stated, "I don'tknow what that means." Ibid.

BREEDENPer Curiamsuperintendent of petitioner. Her first claim of retaliationasserts that she was punished for these complaints.The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has applied$ 2000e-3(a) to protect employee "oppos[ition]" not just topractices that are actually "made . . . unlawful" by Title VII,but also to practices that the employee could reasonably believe were unlawful. 2000 WL 991821, at *1 (stating thatrespondent's opposition was protected "if she had a reason-able, good faith belief that the incident involving the sexuallyexplicit remark constituted unlawful sexual harassment");Trent v. Valley Electric Assn. Inc., 41 F. 3d 524, 526 (CA91994). We have no occasion to rule on the propriety of thisinterpretation, because even assuming it is correct, no onecould reasonably believe that the incident recounted aboveviolated Title VII.Title VII forbids actions taken on the basis of sex that"discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment."42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-2(a)(1). Just three Terms ago, we reiterated, what was plain from our previous decisions, that sexualharassment is actionable under Title VII only if it is "so `severe or pervasive' as to `alter the conditions of [the victim's]employment and create an abusive working environment.' "Faragher v. Boca Raton, 524 U. S. 775, 786 (1998) (quotingMeritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U. S. 57, 67(1986) (some internal quotation marks omitted)). See alsoBurlington Industries, Inc. v.

Sundowner OffshoreServices, Inc., 523 U. S. 75, 81 (1998) (Title VII "forbids onlybehavior so objectively offensive as to alter the `conditions'of the victim's employment"). Workplace conduct is notmeasured in isolation; instead, "whether an environment issufficiently hostile or abusive" must be judged "by `lookingat all the circumstances,' including the `frequency of the dis532US1 Unit: $U42 [09-05-02 19:40:17] PAGES PGT: OPIN271Cite as: 532 U.

"Faragher v. Boca Raton, supra, at787-788 (quoting Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc., 510 U. S.17, 23 (1993)). Hence, "[a] recurring point in [our] opinions isthat simple teasing, offhand comments, and isolated incidents(unless extremely serious) will not amount to discrimina-tory changes in the `terms and conditions of employment.' "Faragher v. Boca Raton, supra, at 788 (citation and internalquotation marks omitted).No reasonable person could have believed that the singleincident recounted above violated Title VII's standard. Theordinary terms and conditions of respondent's job requiredher to review the sexually explicit statement in the courseof screening job applicants. Her co-workers who participated in the hiring process were subject to the same requirement, and indeed, in the District Court respondent "conceded that it did not bother or upset her" to read thestatement in the file. App. to Pet. for Cert. 15 (DistrictCourt opinion). Her supervisor's comment, made at a meeting to review the application, that he did not know what thestatement meant; her co-worker's responding comment; andthe chuckling of both are at worst an "isolated inciden[t]"that cannot remotely be considered "extremely serious," asour cases require, Faragher v. Boca Raton, supra, at 788.The holding of the Court of Appeals to the contrary mustbe reversed.Besides claiming that she was punished for complaining topetitioner's personnel about the alleged sexual harassment,respondent also claimed that she was punished for filingcharges against petitioner with the Nevada Equal RightsCommission and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and for filing the present suit. Respondentfiled her lawsuit on April 1, 1997; on April 10, 1997, respondent's supervisor, Assistant Superintendent Rice, "mentioned532US1 Unit: $U42 [09-05-02 19:40:17] PAGES PGT: OPIN272 CLARK COUNTY SCHOOL DIST. v. BREEDENPer Curiamto Allin Chandler, Executive Director of plaintiff 's union,that she was contemplating transferring plaintiff to theposition of Director of Professional Development Education,"App. to Pet. for Cert. 11-12 (District Court opinion); andthis transfer was "carried through" in May, Brief in Opposi-tion 8. In order to show, as her defense against summaryjudgment required, the existence of a causal connection between her protected activities and the transfer, respondent"relie[d] wholly on the temporal proximity of the filing of hercomplaint on April 1, 1997 and Rice's statement to plaintiff 'sunion representative on April 10, 1997 that she was considering transferring plaintiff to the [new] position." App. to Pet.for Cert. 21-22 (District Court opinion). The DistrictCourt, however, found that respondent did not serve petitioner with the summons and complaint until April 11, 1997,one day after Rice had made the statement, and Rice filedan affidavit stating that she did not become aware of thelawsuit until after April 11, a claim that respondent did notchallenge. Hence, the court concluded, respondent "ha[d]not shown that any causal connection exists between herprotected activities and the adverse employment decision."Id., at 21.The Court of Appeals reversed, relying on two facts: TheEEOC had issued a right-to-sue letter to respondent threemonths before Rice announced she was contemplating thetransfer, and the actual transfer occurred one month afterRice learned of respondent's suit. 2000 WL 991821, at *3.The latter fact is immaterial in light of the fact that petitioner concededly was contemplating the transfer before itlearned of the suit. Employers need not suspend previouslyplanned transfers upon discovering that a Title VII suit hasbeen filed, and their proceeding along lines previously contemplated, though not yet definitively determined, is no evidence whatever of causality.As for the right-to-sue letter: Respondent did not rely onthat letter in the District Court and did not mention it in532US1 Unit: $U42 [09-05-02 19:40:17] PAGES PGT: OPIN273Cite as: 532 U. S. 268 (2001)Per Curiamher opening brief on appeal. Her demonstration of causalityall along had rested upon the connection between the transfer and the filing of her lawsuit--to which connection theletter was irrelevant. When, however, petitioner's answering brief in the Court of Appeals demonstrated conclusivelythe lack of causation between the filing of respondent's lawsuit and Rice's decision, respondent mentioned the letter forthe first time in her reply brief, Reply Brief in No. 99-15522(CA9) pp. 9-10. The Ninth Circuit's opinion did not adoptrespondent's utterly implausible suggestion that the EEOC'sissuance of a right-to-sue letter--an action in which the employee takes no part--is a protected activity of the employee,see 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-3(a). Rather, the opinion suggeststhat the letter provided petitioner with its first notice ofrespondent's charge before the EEOC, and hence allowedthe inference that the transfer proposal made three monthslater was petitioner's reaction to the charge. See 2000 WL991821, at *3. This will not do.First, there is no indication that Rice even knew about theright-to-sue letter when she proposed transferring respondent. And second, if one presumes she knew about it, onemust also presume that she (or her predecessor) knew almosttwo years earlier about the protected action (filing of theEEOC complaint) that the letter supposedly disclosed. (Thecomplaint had been filed on August 23, 1995, and both TitleVII and its implementing regulations require that an employer be given notice within 10 days of filing, 42 U. S. C.$$ 2000e-5(b), (e)(1); 29 CFR $ 1601.14 (2000).) The casesthat accept mere temporal proximity between an employer'sknowledge of protected activity and an adverse employmentaction as sufficient evidence of causality to establish a primafacie case uniformly hold that the temporal proximity mustbe "very close," O'Neal v. Ferguson Constr. Co., 237 F. 3d1248, 1253 (CA10 2001). See, e. g., Richmond v. Oneok, Inc.,120 F. 3d 205, 209 (CA10 1997) (3-month period insufficient);Hughes v. Derwinski, 967 F. 2d 1168, 1174-1175 (CA7 1992)532US1 Unit: $U42 [09-05-02 19:40:17] PAGES PGT: OPIN274 CLARK COUNTY SCHOOL DIST. v. BREEDENPer Curiam(4-month period insufficient). Action taken (as here) 20months later suggests, by itself, no causality at all.In short, neither the grounds that respondent presentedto the District Court, nor the ground she added on appeal,nor even the ground the Court of Appeals developed on itsown, sufficed to establish a dispute substantial enough towithstand the motion for summary judgment. The DistrictCourt's granting of that motion was correct. The judgmentof the Court of Appeals is reversed.
