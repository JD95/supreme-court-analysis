A jury in the Eastern District of Virginia found for peti-tioner Hetzel on her claims against respondent County ofPrince William under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act523US1 Unit: $U41 [04-29-00 20:28:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN209Cite as: 523 U. S. 208 (1998)Per Curiamof 1964, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e et seq., and Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42U. S. C. $ 1983. The District Court reduced the damagesfrom $750,000 to $500,000, on the grounds that one of theclaims supporting the award was legally insufficient. On respondents' appeal to the Court of Appeals for the FourthCircuit, that court affirmed the finding of liability, but heldthat the damages award was grossly excessive because itwas unsupported by the limited evidence of harm presentedat trial.Hetzel v. County of Prince William, 89 F. 3d 169,cert. denied, 519 U. S. 1028 (1996). The court "set aside thedamage award and remand[ed] the case to the district courtfor the recalculation of the award of damages for emotionaldistress." 89 F. 3d, at 173.On remand, the District Court recalculated the damagesand awarded petitioner $50,000. Petitioner filed a motionfor a new trial in which she declined the award. She arguedthat in reducing her damages, the Court of Appeals in effecthad offered her a remittitur, and that she was therefore entitled to a new trial under the Seventh Amendment's guarantee of a right to trial by jury. Respondents agreed that theCourt of Appeals' decision functioned as a remittitur, butcontended that the decision did not allow petitioner the option of a new trial. In a memorandum opinion, the DistrictCourt determined that although the Court of Appeals' mandate clearly reversed the judgment and remanded for recalculation of damages, it did not address the Seventh Amendment issue, which had not arisen until petitioner rejected therecalculated damages award and sought a new trial. Concluding that Circuit precedent was clear that when a courtfinds a jury's verdict excessive and reduces it, the plaintiffhas a right either to accept the reduced award or to have anew trial, the court granted petitioner's motion for a newtrial on the issue of damages.Respondents petitioned the Court of Appeals for a writ ofmandamus, contending that the District Court did not haveauthority under its prior decision to order a new trial. In523US1 Unit: $U41 [04-29-00 20:28:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN210 HETZEL v. PRINCE WILLIAM COUNTYPer Curiaman unpublished order, the Court of Appeals granted the peti-tion and stayed the scheduled retrial. It stated that itsprior decision had ordered the District Court to recalculatethe damages "and to enter final judgment thereon." It alsoreiterated that pursuant to its earlier mandate, the DistrictCourt should closely examine two cases it had previouslynoted as comparable to what would be an appropriate awardin petitioner's case.1Petitioner contends that this action of the Court of Ap-peals violated her Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial.2We agree. The Seventh Amendment provides that "theright of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried bya jury, shall be otherwise reexamined in any Court of theUnited States, than according to the rules of the commonlaw." U. S. Const., Amdt. 7.1 After the Court of Appeals issued its mandamus order, the DistrictCourt again recalculated the damages and entered judgment for petitionerin the amount of $15,000, which was the greater of the amounts awardedin the two cases noted by the Court of Appeals. Petitioner's appeal fromthat judgment is pending in the Court of Appeals. We do not think itappropriate to stay our decision, however, since the Court of Appeals, atthe time it issued its writ of mandamus, was presented with petitioner'sSeventh Amendment claim in the District Court's memorandum opiniongranting a new trial.2 Respondents argue that we should not consider petitioner's SeventhAmendment claim because she failed to raise it in her prior petition forcertiorari. Hetzel v. County of Prince William, 89 F. 3d 169 (CA4), cert.denied, 519 U. S. 1028 (1996). We think it apparent, however, that petitioner did not raise this claim at that time because she reasonably construed the Court of Appeals' decision as not depriving her of the optionof a new trial if she were to reject the remitted damages award. TheCourt of Appeals' decision ordered only that the judgment be reversedand the case remanded to the District Court for recalculation of damages.83 F. 3d, at 173. To interpret that decision as precluding the option of anew trial would require petitioner to assume a deviation from normal practice and an action by the Court of Appeals that at minimum implicatedconstitutional concerns. We agree with the District Court that the original mandate was not so explicit as to compel that interpretation.523US1 Unit: $U41 [04-29-00 20:28:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN211Cite as: 523 U. S. 208 (1998)Per CuriamIn Kennon v. Gilmer, 131 U. S. 22, 27-28 (1889), the plaintiff won a general damages verdict for $20,000, and the trialcourt denied a motion for a new trial. On appeal, the Supreme Court of the Territory of Montana reduced the verdict to $10,000 on the grounds that the evidence was insufficient to sustain such a high damages award, and affirmedthe judgment for that amount. Ibid. This Court concludedthat the judgment reducing the amount of the verdict "without submitting the case to another jury, or putting the plaintiff to the election of remitting part of the verdict beforerendering judgment for the rest, was irregular, and, so faras we are informed, unprecedented." Ibid. It noted thatin accord with the Seventh Amendment's prohibition on thereexamination of facts determined by a jury, a court has noauthority, upon a motion for a new trial, "according to itsown estimate of the amount of damages which the plaintiffought to have recovered, to enter an absolute judgment forany other sum than that assessed by the jury." Id., at 29.In determining that the evidence did not support the jury'sgeneral damages award and in ordering the District Courtto recalculate the damages, the Court of Appeals in this caseimposed a remittitur. The District Court correctly affordedpetitioner the option of a new trial when it entered judgmentfor the reduced damages. The Court of Appeals' writ ofmandamus, requiring the District Court to enter judgmentfor a lesser amount than that determined by the jury withoutallowing petitioner the option of a new trial, cannot besquared with the Seventh Amendment. See id., at 29-30;see also Dimick v. Schiedt, 293 U. S. 474, 486 (1935) (reaffirming the practice of conditionally remitting damages, butnoting that where a verdict is set aside as grossly inadequateor excessive, both parties remain entitled to have a jury determine the issues of liability and the extent of injury); Gasperini v. Center for Humanities, Inc., 518 U. S. 415, 433(1996) (the trial judge's discretion includes "overturning523US1 Unit: $U41 [04-29-00 20:28:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN212 HETZEL v. PRINCE WILLIAM COUNTYPer Curiamverdicts for excessiveness and ordering a new trial with-out qualification, or conditioned on the verdict winner'srefusal to agree to a reduction (remittitur)"); id., at 462-463 (Scalia, J., dissenting).Respondents contend that the action of the Court of Appeals here is supported by Neely v. Martin K. Eby Constr.Co., 386 U. S. 317, 329-330 (1967). But that case dealt withthe application of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(d) in asituation where the Court of Appeals had held that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding of liability. Itdid not involve overturning an award of damages where theevidence was found sufficient to support a finding of liability.We therefore grant the petition for certiorari and reversethe judgment of the Court of Appeals issuing a writ of man-damus to the District Court.
