Respondent Jerry Nachtigal was charged with operating amotor vehicle in Yosemite National Park while under theinfluence of alcohol, in violation of 36 CFR $$ 4.23(a)(1) and(a)(2) (1992). Driving under the influence (DUI) is a class Bmisdemeanor and carries a maximum penalty of six months'imprisonment, $ 1.3(a); 18 U. S. C. $ 3581(b)(7), and a $5,000fine, $$ 3571(b)(6) and (e). As an alternative to a term ofimprisonment, the sentencing court may impose a term ofprobation not to exceed five years. $$ 3561(a)(3), (b)(2).The sentencing court has discretion to attach a host of discretionary conditions to the probationary term. $ 3563(b).Respondent moved for a jury trial. Applying our decisionin Blanton v. North Las Vegas, 489 U. S. 538 (1989), the Mag-istrate Judge denied the motion. He reasoned that becauseDUI carries a maximum term of imprisonment of six months,it is presumptively a "petty" offense which is not embracedby the jury trial guaranty of the Sixth Amendment. He re-jected respondent's contention that the additional penaltiestransformed DUI into a "serious" offense for Sixth Amend-ment purposes. Respondent was then tried by the Magistrate Judge and convicted of operating a motor vehicle underthe influence of alcohol in violation of 36 CFR $ 4.23(a)(1)(1992). He was fined $750 and placed on unsupervised pro-bation for one year.The District Court reversed the Magistrate Judge on theissue of entitlement to a jury trial, commenting that the language in our opinion in Blanton was "at variance with theNinth Circuit precedent ofUnited States v. Craner, [652F. 2d 23 (1981)]," and electing to follow Craner because ouropinion in Blanton did not "expressly overrule" Craner.App. to Pet. for Cert. 17a, 20a.The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed withthe District Court, holding thatBlanton is "[in]apposite,"that Craner controls, and that respondent is entitled to ajury trial.

The Court of Appeals rea-soned that since the Secretary of the Interior, and not Congress, set the maximum prison term at six months, "[t]hereis no controlling legislative determination" regarding the seriousness of the offense. App. to Pet. for Cert. 4a; see alsoUnited States v. Craner, 652 F. 2d 23, 25 (CA9 1981). Thecourt also found it significant that the Secretary of the Interior, in whom Congress vested general regulatory authorityto fix six months as the maximum sentence for any regulatory offense dealing with the use and management of thenational parks, monuments, or reservations, see 16 U. S. C.$ 3, chose the harshest penalty available for DUI offenses.App. to Pet. for Cert. 3a-4a; see also Craner, supra, at 25.Finally, the court noted that seven of the nine States withinthe Ninth Circuit guarantee a jury trial for a DUI offense.App. to Pet. for Cert. 3a-4a; see also Craner, supra, at 27.Unlike the Court of Appeals and the District Court, wethink that this case is quite obviously controlled by our decision in Blanton. We therefore grant the United States' petition for certiorari and reverse the judgment of the Courtof Appeals. The motion of respondent for leave to proceedin forma pauperis is granted.In Blanton, we held that in order to determine whetherthe Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial attaches to a particular offense, the court must examine "objective indicationsof the seriousness with which society regards the offense."Blanton, 489 U. S., at 541 (internal quotation marks omitted). The best indicator of society's views is the maximumpenalty set by the legislature. Ibid. While the word "penalty" refers both to the term of imprisonment and other statutory penalties, we stated that "[p]rimary emphasis . . . mustbe placed on the maximum authorized period of incarceration." Id., at 542. We therefore held that offenses forwhich the maximum period of incarceration is six months orless are presumptively " `petty.' " A defendant can overcome this presumption, and become entitled to a jury trial,507us1$27z 10-20-95 16:27:25 PAGES OPINBXPGT n4 UNITED STATES v. NACHTIGALPer Curiamonly by showing that the additional penalties, viewed together with the maximum prison term, are so severe thatthe legislature clearly determined that the offense is a " `serious' " one. Id., at 543. Finally, we expressly stated thatthe statutory penalties in other States are irrelevant to thequestion whether a particular legislature deemed a particular offense " `serious.' " Id., at 545, n. 11.Applying the above rule, we held that DUI was a pettyoffense under Nevada law. Since the maximum prison termwas six months, the presumption described above applied.We did not find it constitutionally significant that the defendant would automatically lose his license for up to 90 days,and would be required to attend, at his own expense, an alcohol abuse education course. Id., at 544, and n. 9. Nor didwe believe that a $1,000 fine or an alternative sentence of 48hours' community service while wearing clothing identifyinghim as a DUI offender was more onerous than six months injail. Id., at 544-545.The present case, we think, requires only a relatively routine application of the rule announced in Blanton. Becausethe maximum term of imprisonment is six months, DUIunder 36 CFR $ 4.23(a)(1) (1992) is presumptively a petty offense to which no jury trial right attaches. The Court ofAppeals refused to apply the Blanton presumption, reasoning that the Secretary of the Interior, and not Congress, ultimately determined the maximum prison term. But thereis a controlling legislative determination present within theregulatory scheme. In 16 U. S. C. $ 3, Congress set sixmonths as the maximum penalty the Secretary could imposefor a violation of any of his regulations. The Court of Appeals offered no persuasive reason why this congressionaldetermination is stripped of its "legislative" charactermerely because the Secretary has final authority to decide,within the limits given by Congress, what the maximumprison sentence will be for a violation of a given regulation.507us1$27z 10-20-95 16:27:25 PAGES OPINBXPGT n5Cite as: 507 U. S. 1 (1993)Per CuriamThe additional penalties imposed under the regulations arenot sufficiently severe to overcome this presumption. Aswe noted in Blanton, it is a rare case where "a legislaturepacks an offense it deems `serious' with onerous penaltiesthat nonetheless do not puncture the 6-month incarcerationline."Blanton, 489 U. S., at 543 (internal quotation marksomitted). Here, the federal DUI offense carries a maximumfine of $5,000, and respondent faced, as an alternative to in-carceration, a maximum 5-year term of probation. Whilethe maximum fine in this case is $4,000 greater than the onein Blanton, this monetary penalty "cannot approximate inseverity the loss of liberty that a prison term entails." Id.,at 542.Nor do we believe that the probation alternative rendersthe DUI offense "serious." * Like a monetary penalty, theliberty infringement caused by a term of probation is farless intrusive than incarceration.Ibid. The discretionaryprobation conditions do not alter this conclusion; while theyobviously entail a greater infringement on liberty than pro-bation without attendant conditions, they do not approximate the severe loss of liberty caused by imprisonment formore than six months.We hold that the Court of Appeals was wrong in refusingto recognize that this case was controlled by our opinion inBlanton rather than by its previous opinion in Craner. Anindividual convicted of driving under the influence in viola*There are 21 discretionary conditions which the sentencing court mayimpose upon a defendant. Under 18 U. S. C. $ 3563(b), a court may require, among other things, that the defendant (1) pay restitution; (2) takepart in a drug and alcohol dependency program offered by an institution,and if necessary, reside at the institution; (3) remain in the custody of theBureau of Prisons during nights and weekends for a period not exceedingthe term of imprisonment; (4) reside at or participate in a program of acommunity correctional facility for all or part of the probationary term; or(5) remain at his place of residence during nonworking hours, and, if necessary, this condition may be monitored by telephonic or electronic devices.$$ 3563(b)(3), (b)(10), (b)(11), (b)(12), (b)(20).507us1$27z 10-20-95 16:27:25 PAGES OPINBXPGT n6 UNITED STATES v.
