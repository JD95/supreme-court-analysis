The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed thegrant of habeas relief to respondent Gregory Esparza afterconcluding that, because the Eighth Amendment requiresthe State to narrow the class of death eligible defendants,the Ohio Court of Appeals had improperly subjected respondent's claims to harmless-error review. 310 F. 3d 414(2002). This decision ignores the limits imposed on federalhabeas review by 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d), and we thereforegrant the petition for certiorari and reverse.In February 1983, respondent Esparza entered a store inToledo, Ohio, and approached two employees, Melanie Gerschultz and James Barailloux. No one else was in the store.At gunpoint, he ordered Gerschultz to open the cash register.Barailloux meanwhile fled the store through a rear door, entering the attached home of the storeowner, Evelyn Krieger.As Barailloux was alerting Krieger to the robbery, he hearda gunshot. Barailloux and Krieger returned to the storeand found Gerschultz lying on the floor, fatally wounded bya single gunshot to her neck. The cash register was openand approximately $110 was missing.Respondent was charged with aggravated murder duringthe commission of an aggravated robbery, Ohio Rev. CodeAnn. $ 2903.01 (Anderson 2002), and aggravated robbery,$ 2911.01. He was convicted on both counts, and the trialjudge accepted the jury's recommendation that he be sentenced to death for the murder conviction. The trial judgeadditionally sentenced respondent to 7 to 25 years' imprisonment for aggravated robbery, plus 3 years for the firearmspecification. The Ohio Supreme Court affirmed the convic540US1 Unit: $$U2 [10-27-05 19:40:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN14 MITCHELL v. ESPARZAPer Curiamtions and the sentences. State v. Esparza, 39 Ohio St. 3d 8,529 N. E. 2d 192 (1988), cert. denied, 490 U. S. 1012 (1989).On state postconviction review, respondent argued, for thefirst time, that he had not been convicted of an offense forwhich a death sentence could be imposed under Ohio law.Although the indictment charged him with aggravated murder in the course of committing aggravated robbery, it didnot charge him as a "principal offender."1 The Ohio Courtof Appeals rejected his claim, holding that literal compliancewith the statute was not required: "[W]here only one defendant is named in an indictment alleging felony murder, itwould be redundant to state that the defendant is beingcharged as a principal offender. Only where more than onedefendant is named need the indictment specify the allegation `principal offender.' " State v. Esparza, No. L-90-235,1992 WL 113827, *9 (May 29, 1992), cause dism'd, 65 OhioSt. 3d 1453, 602 N. E. 2d 250 (1992).Respondent then filed a second petition for state postconviction relief alleging, inter alia, ineffective assistance of ap-pellate counsel because his attorney did not argue that theState's failure to comply with its sentencing procedures vio-lated the Eighth Amendment. The Ohio Court of Appealsin a conclusory opinion denied his claim, referring back to itsprevious decision.State v. Esparza, No. L-84-225, 1994WL 395114, *5 (July 27, 1994), cause dism'd, 70 Ohio St. 3d1 Ohio Rev. Code Ann. $ 2929.04(A) (Anderson 2002) provides, in relevant part:"Imposition of the death penalty for aggravated murder is precluded,unless one or more of the following is specified in the indictment or countin the indictment . . . and proved beyond a reasonable doubt:. . . . ."(7) The offense was committed while the offender was committing, attempting to commit, or fleeing immediately after committing or attempting to commit . . . aggravated robbery, . . . and either the offender was theprincipal offender in the commission of the aggravated murder or, if notthe principal offender, committed the aggravated murder with prior calculation and design."540US1 Unit: $$U2 [10-27-05 19:40:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN15Cite as: 540 U. S. 12 (2003)Per Curiam1473, 640 N. E. 2d 845 (1994). The import of the court's deci-sion was clear: Respondent failed to prove he was prejudicedbecause any error committed by counsel was harmless. Inrespondent's words, "The state court . . . determined thatsince [respondent] was the only individual charged, the jurymust have determined that [respondent] was the principaloffender." Brief in Opposition 2.Having exhausted his avenues for relief under state law,respondent filed a habeas petition in the District Court forthe Northern District of Ohio. The District Court con-cluded that the Ohio Court of Appeals' decision was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law because it was contrary to our opinions in Apprendi v. NewJersey, 530 U. S. 466 (2000), and Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508U. S. 275 (1993). In light of this error, as well as othersnot relevant to this opinion, the court granted respondent'spetition in part and issued a writ of habeas corpus asto the death sentence. Esparza v. Anderson, No. 3:96-CV-7434 (Oct. 13, 2000), App. to Pet. for Cert. 41a-240a.The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court, holdingthat the Eighth Amendment precluded respondent's deathsentence and that harmless-error review was inappropriate.The State of Ohio petitioned for a writ of certiorari, whichwe now grant, along with respondent's motion for leave toproceed in forma pauperis.A federal court may grant a state habeas petitioner relieffor a claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state courtonly if that adjudication "resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearlyestablished Federal law, as determined by the SupremeCourt of the United States." 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d)(1). TheCourt of Appeals, however, failed to cite, much less apply,this section.A state court's decision is "contrary to" our clearly established law if it "applies a rule that contradicts the governinglaw set forth in our cases" or if it "confronts a set of facts540US1 Unit: $$U2 [10-27-05 19:40:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN16 MITCHELL v. ESPARZAPer Curiamthat are materially indistinguishable from a decision of thisCourt and nevertheless arrives at a result different from ourprecedent." Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 405-406(2000); see alsoPrice v. Vincent, 538 U. S. 634, 640 (2003);Early v. Packer, 537 U. S. 3, 7-8 (2002) (per curiam). Astate court's decision is not "contrary to . . . clearly established Federal law" simply because the court did not cite ouropinions. Id., at 8. We have held that a state court neednot even be aware of our precedents, "so long as neither thereasoning nor the result of the state-court decision contra-dicts them."Ibid.According to the Sixth Circuit, Ohio's failure to charge inthe indictment that respondent was a "principal" was thefunctional equivalent of "dispensing with the reasonabledoubt requirement." 310 F. 3d, at 421 (citing Sullivan v.Louisiana, supra, at 280). Our precedents, however, do notsupport its conclusion. In noncapital cases, we have oftenheld that the trial court's failure to instruct a jury on all ofthe statutory elements of an offense is subject to harmlesserror analysis. E. g., Neder v. United States, 527 U. S. 1, 19(1999); California v. Roy, 519 U. S. 2 (1996) (per curiam);Carella v. California, 491 U. S. 263, 266 (1989) (per curiam);Pope v. Illinois, 481 U. S. 497 (1987). In Neder, for example,we held that such an error "differs markedly from the constitutional violations we have found to defy harmless-error review." 527 U. S., at 8. In so holding, we explicitly distinguished Sullivan because the error in Sullivan--the failureto instruct the jury that the State must prove the elementsof an offense beyond a reasonable doubt--" `vitiat[ed] all thejury's findings,' " 527 U. S., at 11, whereas the trial court'sfailure to instruct the jury on one element of an offense didnot, see id., at 13-15. Where the jury was precluded fromdetermining only one element of an offense, we held thatharmless-error review is feasible. Ibid.We cannot say that because the violation occurred in thecontext of a capital sentencing proceeding that our precedent540US1 Unit: $$U2 [10-27-05 19:40:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN17Cite as: 540 U. S. 12 (2003)Per Curiamrequires the opposite result. Indeed, a number of ourharmless-error cases have involved capital defendants,2 Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U. S. 279, 310 (1991) (unconstitu-tional admission of coerced confession at guilt stage); Clemons v. Mississippi, 494 U. S. 738 (1990) (unconstitutionallybroad jury instructions at sentencing stage); Satterwhite v.Texas, 486 U. S. 249 (1988) (unconstitutional admission of evi-dence at sentencing stage), and we left a question similar tothe one presented here open in another capital case, Ring v.Arizona, 536 U. S. 584, 609, n. 7 (2002) ("We do not reachthe State's assertion that any error was harmless becausea pecuniary gain finding was implicit in the jury's guiltyverdict").In relying on the absence of precedent to distinguish ournoncapital cases, and to hold that harmless-error review isnot available for this type of Eighth Amendment claim, theSixth Circuit exceeded its authority under $ 2254(d)(1). Afederal court may not overrule a state court for simply hold-ing a view different from its own, when the precedent fromthis Court is, at best, ambiguous. As the Ohio Court of Ap-peals' decision does not conflict with the reasoning or theholdings of our precedent, it is not "contrary to . . . clearlyestablished Federal law."The question then becomes whether the Ohio Court ofAppeals' determination is an "unreasonableapplicationof clearly established Federal law." $ 2254(d)(1) (emphasis added; punctuation omitted). A constitutional error isharmless when "it appears `beyond a reasonable doubt that2 The Sixth Circuit cited Presnell v. Georgia, 439 U. S. 14 (1978) (percuriam), a due process case, noting that rather than remand for aharmless-error analysis, we simply reversed. In Presnell, we held thatthe Georgia Supreme Court violated due process when it sustained a deathsentence because the sentence was supported by the evidence, eventhough the defendant was unaware of the charge and the issue was neversubmitted to a jury. Presnell, however, relied on the defendant's lack ofnotice and his inability to defend himself, not a faulty indictment or anincomplete jury instruction.540US1 Unit: $$U2 [10-27-05 19:40:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN18 MITCHELL v. ESPARZAPer Curiamthe error complained of did not contribute to the verdictobtained.' " Neder, supra, at 15 (quoting Chapman v. California, 386 U. S. 18, 24 (1967)); see also Delaware v. VanArsdall, 475 U. S. 673, 681 (1986). We may not grant respondent's habeas petition, however, if the state court simplyerred in concluding that the State's errors were harmless;rather, habeas relief is appropriate only if the Ohio Courtof Appeals applied harmless-error review in an "objectivelyunreasonable" manner. Lockyer v. Andrade, 538 U. S. 63,75-77 (2003); see alsoWoodford v. Visciotti, 537 U. S. 19, 25(2002) (per curiam); Williams, supra, at 410 (An "unreasonable application of federal law is different from an incorrectapplication of federal law").The Ohio Court of Appeals' conclusion was hardly objec-tively unreasonable. The Ohio Supreme Court has defineda " `principal offender' " as " `the actual killer,' " State v.Chinn, 85 Ohio St. 3d 548, 559, 709 N. E. 2d 1166, 1177 (1999),and in this case, the jury was instructed on the elements ofaggravated murder, " `defined as purposely causing the deathof another while committing Aggravated Robbery,' " 310F. 3d, at 432 (Suhrheinrich, J., dissenting). The trial judgefurther instructed the jury that it must determine " `whetherthe State has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that theoffense of Aggravated Murder was committed while the De-fendant was committing Aggravated Robbery.' "Ibid. Inlight of these instructions, the jury verdict would surelyhave been the same had it been instructed to find as wellthat the respondent was a "principal" in the offense. Afterall, he was the only defendant charged in the indictment.There was no evidence presented that anyone other than respondent was involved in the crime or present at the store.33 The Court of Appeals noted evidence brought to light for the first timein the habeas proceeding in the District Court that suggested there mighthave been another participant in the crime, Joe Jasso. The jury, however,was not presented with this evidence at trial, and thus it has no bearingon the correctness of the Ohio Court of Appeals' decision that the State540US1 Unit: $$U2 [10-27-05 19:40:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN19Cite as: 540 U. S. 12 (2003)Per CuriamCf. Neder, 527 U. S., at 19 ("[W]here a defendant did not, andapparently could not, bring forth facts contesting the omittedelement, answering the question whether the jury verdictwould have been the same absent the error does not fundamentally undermine the purposes of the jury trial guaran-tee"). Under these circumstances, we cannot say that thestate court's conclusion that respondent was convicted of acapital offense was objectively unreasonable. That beingthe case, we may not set aside its decision on habeas review.4The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals forthe Sixth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded forfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.
