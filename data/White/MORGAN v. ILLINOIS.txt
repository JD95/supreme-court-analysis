We decide here whether, during voir dire for a capital of-fense, a state trial court may, consistent with the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, refuse inquiryinto whether a potential juror would automatically imposethe death penalty upon conviction of the defendant.IThe trial of a capital offense in Illinois is conducted in twophases. The defendant must first be convicted of firstdegree murder, as defined in Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 38, || 9-1(a)(Supp. 1990). Illinois law uses the same jury that decidedguilt to determine whether the death penalty shall be im-posed,1 and upon conviction, a separate sentencing hearingcommences to determine the existence of aggravating andmitigating factors. || 9-1(d)(1). To be eligible for the deathpenalty, the jury must find unanimously, || 9-1(g), and beyonda reasonable doubt, || 9-1(f), that the defendant was at least18 years old at the time of the murder, and that at least 1 of10 enumerated aggravating factors exists, || 9-1(b). See,e. g., || 9-1(b)(5) (murder for hire or by contract); || 9-1(b)(10)(premeditated murder by preconceived plan). If the juryfinds none of the statutory aggravating factors to exist, thedefendant is sentenced to a term of imprisonment. || 9-1(g)."If there is a unanimous finding by the jury that one or more*Briefs of amici curiae urging reversal were filed for the AmericanCivil Liberties Union et al. by Robert L.

Lyon.1 The defendant may, however, elect to waive sentencing by the jury.Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 38, || 9-1(d)(3) (Supp. 1990).

Ibid. As part of this balance, the juryis instructed to consider mitigating factors existing in thecase, five of which are enumerated, but which are not exclusive. || 9-1(c). The State may also present evidence ofrelevant aggravating factors beyond those enumerated bystatute. Ibid. "If the jury determines unanimously thatthere are no mitigating factors sufficient to preclude the imposition of the death sentence, the court shall sentence thedefendant to death." || 9-1(g).Petitioner Derrick Morgan was convicted in Cook County,Illinois, of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. Theevidence at trial amply proved that petitioner was hired tokill a narcotics dealer apparently competing with the ElRukns, one of Chicago's violent inner-city gangs. For$4,000, petitioner lured the dealer, who was a friend, into anabandoned apartment and shot him in the head six times.Upon consideration of factors in aggravation and mitigation,the jury sentenced him to death.Three separate venires were required to be called beforethe jury was finally chosen. In accordance with Illinois law,the trial court, rather than the attorneys, conducted voirdire. People v. Gacy, 103 Ill. 2d 1, 36-37, 468 N. E. 2d 1171,1184-1185 (1984). The State, having elected to pursuecapital punishment, requested inquiry permitted by Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U. S. 510 (1968), to determine whetherany potential juror would in all instances refuse to imposethe death penalty upon conviction of the offense. Accordingly, the trial court, over opposition from the defense, questioned each venire whether any member had moral or religious principles so strong that he or she could not imposethe death penalty "regardless of the facts." App. 9, 78, 90.Seventeen potential jurors were excused when they ex504us2$91K 04-08-96 07:15:12 PAGES OPINPGT723Cite as: 504 U.

All of the jurors eventuallyempaneled were also questioned individually under Witherspoon, each receiving and responding in the negative to thisquestion or a slight variation: "Would you automatically voteagainst the death penalty no matter what the facts of thecase were?" App. 33; seeid., at 36, 41, 48, 55, 59, 64, 69, 76,88, 97, 103.After seven members of the first venire had been ques-tioned, including three who eventually became jurors, petitioner's counsel requested the trial court to ask all prospective jurors the following question: "If you found DerrickMorgan guilty, would you automatically vote to impose thedeath penalty no matter what the facts are?" Id., at 44.The trial court refused this request, stating that it had"asked the question in a different vein substantially in thatnature."Ibid.Prior to the voir dire of the three venires, the trial courthad explained in general terms the dictates of Illinois procedure in capital trials, as outlined above. See id., at 24, 77-78, 90. During voir dire, the trial court received from 9 ofthe 12 jurors empaneled an affirmative response to variations of this question: "Would you follow my instructions onthe law even though you may not agree?"Id., at 30; see id.,at 38, 43, 49, 56, 60, 64, 69, 107. However, the trial court didnot ask three of the jurors this question in any way. Seeid., at 73-77, 83-89, 94-100. Every juror eventually empan-eled was asked generally whether each could be fair and impartial.2 Each juror responded appropriately to at least one2 Such questioning led to the removal for cause of one prospective juror,following this exchange:"Q Would you follow my instructions on the law in the case even thoughyou might not agree?"A Yes.[Footnote 2 is continued on p. 724]504us2$91K 04-08-96 07:15:12 PAGES OPINPGT724 MORGAN v.

When empaneled, each member ofthe jury further swore an oath to "well and truly try theissues joined herein and true deliverance make between thePeople of the State of Illinois and the defendant at the barand a true verdict render according to the law and the evi-dence." 1 Tr. 601-602; seeid., at 264, 370, 429, 507, 544,575-576.On appeal, the Illinois Supreme Court affirmed petition-er's conviction and death sentence, rejecting petitioner'sclaim that, pursuant to Ross v. Oklahoma, 487 U. S. 81(1988),voir dire must include the "life qualifying" or"reverse-Witherspoon" question upon request. The IllinoisSupreme Court concluded that nothing requires a trial courtto question potential jurors so as to identify and exclude anywho would vote for the death penalty in every case afterconviction for a capital offense. 142 Ill. 2d 410, 470, 568N. E. 2d 755, 778 (1991).3 That court also found no violation"Q Do you know any reason why you cannot give this defendant a fairtrial?"A I would have no problem during the trial. If it came--I had afriend's parents murdered twelve years ago before capital punishment. Iwould give a fair trial. If he is found guilty, I would want him hung."Q You couldn't be fair and impartial throughout the proceedings?"A No."Q You are excused." App. 72-73.3 The Illinois Supreme Court has subsequently emphasized that decisionin this case was not meant "to imply that the `reverse-Witherspoon' question is inappropriate. Indeed, given the type of scrutiny capital casesreceive on review, one would think trial courts would go out of theirway to afford a defendant every possible safeguard. The `reverseWitherspoon' question may not be the only means of ensuring defendantan impartial jury, but it is certainly the most direct.

ILLINOISOpinion of the Courtscheme," Spaziano v. Florida, 468 U. S. 447, 464 (1984) (cita-tions omitted), and that no State is constitutionally requiredby the Sixth Amendment or otherwise to provide for jurydetermination of whether the death penalty shall be imposedon a capital defendant, ibid. Illinois has chosen, however,to delegate to the jury this task in the penalty phase ofcapital trials in addition to its duty to determine guilt orinnocence of the underlying crime. The issue, therefore, iswhether petitioner is entitled to relief under the Due ProcessClause of the Fourteenth Amendment. We conclude that heis, and in the course of doing so we deal with four issues:whether a jury provided to a capital defendant at the sentencing phase must be impartial; whether such defendant isentitled to challenge for cause and have removed on theground of bias a prospective juror who will automaticallyvote for the death penalty irrespective of the facts or thetrial court's instructions of law; whether on voir dire thecourt must, on defendant's request, inquire into the prospective jurors' views on capital punishment; and whether thevoir dire in this case was constitutionally sufficient.ADuncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145 (1968), held that theFourteenth Amendment guaranteed a right of jury trial inall state criminal cases which, were they tried in a federalcourt, would come within the Sixth Amendment's guaranteeof trial by jury. Prior to this decision applying the SixthAmendment's jury trial provision to the States, we recognized in Irvin v. Dowd, 366 U. S. 717 (1961), and in Turnerv. Louisiana, 379 U. S. 466 (1965), that the FourteenthAmendment's Due Process Clause itself independently re-quired the impartiality of any jury empaneled to try a cause:"Although this Court has said that the FourteenthAmendment does not demand the use of jury trials in aState's criminal procedure, Fay v. New York, 332 U. S.261 [(1947)]; Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U. S. 319 [(1937)],504us2$91K 04-08-96 07:15:12 PAGES OPINPGT727Cite as: 504 U. S. 719 (1992)Opinion of the Courtevery State has constitutionally provided trial by jury.See Columbia University Legislative Drafting ResearchFund, Index Digest of State Constitutions, 578-579(1959). In essence, the right to jury trial guarantees tothe criminally accused a fair trial by a panel of impartial,`indifferent' jurors. The failure to accord an accused afair hearing violates even the minimal standards of dueprocess. In re Oliver, 333 U. S. 257 [(1948)]; Tumey v.Ohio, 273 U. S. 510 [(1927)]. `A fair trial in a fair tribunal is a basic requirement of due process.' In re Murchison, 349 U. S. 133, 136 [(1955)]. In the ultimate analysis, only the jury can strip a man of his liberty or hislife. In the language of Lord Coke, a juror must beas `indifferent as he stands unsworne.' Co. Litt. 155b.His verdict must be based upon the evidence developedat the trial. Cf. Thompson v. City of Louisville, 362U. S. 199 [(1960)]. This is true, regardless of the heinousness of the crime charged, the apparent guilt of theoffender or the station in life which he occupies. It wasso written into our law as early as 1807 by Chief JusticeMarshall in 1 Burr's Trial 416 (1807). `The theory ofthe law is that a juror who has formed an opinion cannotbe impartial.' Reynolds v. United States, 98 U. S. 145,155 [(1879)]." Irvin v. Dowd, supra, at 721-722 (footnote omitted).In Turner v. Louisiana, we relied on this passage to delineate "the nature of the jury trial which the FourteenthAmendment commands when trial by jury is what the Statehas purported to accord." 379 U. S., at 471. In short, asreflected in the passage above, due process alone has longdemanded that, if a jury is to be provided the defendant,regardless of whether the Sixth Amendment requires it, thejury must stand impartial and indifferent to the extent commanded by the Sixth Amendment. Id., at 472, and n. 10; cf.Groppi v. Wisconsin, 400 U. S. 505, 508-511 (1971).504us2$91K 04-08-96 07:15:12 PAGES OPINPGT728 MORGAN v. ILLINOISOpinion of the CourtThus it is that our decisions dealing with capital sentenc-ing juries and presenting issues most analogous to thatwhich we decide here today, e. g., Witherspoon v. Illinois,391 U. S., at 518; Adams v. Texas, 448 U. S. 38, 40 (1980);Wainwright v. Witt, 469 U. S. 412, 423 (1985); Ross v. Oklahoma, 487 U. S., at 85, have relied on the strictures dictatedby the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to ensure the impartiality of any jury that will undertake capital sentencing.See also Turner v. Murray, 476 U. S. 28, 36, and n. 9 (1986)(plurality opinion). BWitt held that "the proper standard for determining whena prospective juror may be excluded for cause because of hisor her views on capital punishment . . . is whether the juror'sviews would `prevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his instruc-tions and his oath.' " 469 U. S., at 424 (quotingAdams v.Texas, supra, at 45). Under this standard, it is clear fromWitt and Adams, the progeny of Witherspoon, that a jurorwho in no case would vote for capital punishment, regardlessof his or her instructions, is not an impartial juror and mustbe removed for cause.Thereafter, in Ross v. Oklahoma, supra, a state trial courtrefused to remove for cause a juror who declared he wouldvote to impose death automatically if the jury found the de-fendant guilty. That juror, however, was removed by thedefendant's use of a peremptory challenge, and for that rea-son the death sentence could be affirmed. But in the courseof reaching this result, we announced our considered viewthat because the Constitution guarantees a defendant ontrial for his life the right to an impartial jury, 487 U. S., at85, the trial court's failure to remove the juror for cause wasconstitutional error under the standard enunciated in Witt.We emphasized that "[h]ad [this juror] sat on the jury thatultimately sentenced petitioner to death, and had petitionerproperly preserved his right to challenge the trial court's504us2$91K 04-08-96 07:15:12 PAGES OPINPGT729Cite as: 504 U. S. 719 (1992)Opinion of the Courtfailure to remove [the juror] for cause, the sentence wouldhave to be overturned." 487 U. S., at 85 (citing Adams,supra).We reiterate this view today. A juror who will automatically vote for the death penalty in every case will fail in goodfaith to consider the evidence of aggravating and mitigatingcircumstances as the instructions require him to do. In-deed, because such a juror has already formed an opinion onthe merits, the presence or absence of either aggravating ormitigating circumstances is entirely irrelevant to such ajuror. Therefore, based on the requirement of impartialityembodied in the Due Process Clause of the FourteenthAmendment, a capital defendant may challenge for cause anyprospective juror who maintains such views. If even onesuch juror is empaneled and the death sentence is imposed,the State is disentitled to execute the sentence.CIllinois, in fact, raises no challenge to the foregoing pre-cepts, but argues instead that the trial court, in its discretion, may refuse direct inquiry into this matter, so long asits other questioning purports to assure the defendant a fairand impartial jury able to follow the law. It is true that"[v]oir dire `is conducted under the supervision of the court,and a great deal must, of necessity, be left to its sound discretion.' " Ristaino v. Ross, 424 U. S. 589, 594 (1976) (quotingConnors v. United States, 158 U. S. 408, 413 (1895)). TheConstitution, after all, does not dictate a catechism for voirdire, but only that the defendant be afforded an impartialjury. Even so, part of the guarantee of a defendant's rightto an impartial jury is an adequatevoir dire to identifyunqualified jurors. Dennis v. United States, 339 U. S. 162,171-172 (1950); Morford v. United States, 339 U. S. 258, 259(1950). "Voir dire plays a critical function in assuring thecriminal defendant that his [constitutional] right to an impar-tial jury will be honored. Without an adequate voir dire the504us2$91K 04-08-96 07:15:12 PAGES OPINPGT730 MORGAN v. ILLINOISOpinion of the Courttrial judge's responsibility to remove prospective jurors whowill not be able impartially to follow the court's instructionsand evaluate the evidence cannot be fulfilled." RosalesLopez v. United States, 451 U. S. 182, 188 (1981) (pluralityopinion). Hence, "[t]he exercise of [the trial court's] discretion, and the restriction upon inquiries at the request ofcounsel, [are] subject to the essential demands of fairness."Aldridge v. United States, 283 U. S. 308, 310 (1931).5The adequacy ofvoir dire is not easily the subject of appellate review, Rosales-Lopez, supra, at 188, but we have nothesitated, particularly in capital cases, to find that certaininquiries must be made to effectuate constitutional protections, see, e. g., Turner v. Murray, supra, at 36-37; Ham v.South Carolina, 409 U. S. 524, 526-527 (1973). Our holdingin Ham, for instance, was as follows:"Since one of the purposes of the Due Process Clause ofthe Fourteenth Amendment is to insure these `essentialdemands of fairness,' e. g., Lisenba v. California, 314U. S. 219, 236 (1941), and since a principal purpose of theadoption of the Fourteenth Amendment was to prohibitthe States from invidiously discriminating on the basisof race, Slaughter-House Cases, 16 Wall. 36, 81 (1873),we think that the Fourteenth Amendment required thejudge in this case to interrogate the jurors upon thesubject of racial prejudice. South Carolina law permitschallenges for cause, and authorizes the trial judge toconduct voir dire examination of potential jurors. TheState having created this statutory framework for theselection of juries, the essential fairness required by theDue Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires that under the facts shown by this record the5 See Mu'Min v. Virginia, 500 U. S. 415, 425-426 (1991): "To be constitutionally compelled . . . it is not enough that such questions might be helpful.Rather, the trial court's failure to ask these questions must render thedefendant's trial fundamentally unfair."504us2$91K 04-08-96 07:15:12 PAGES OPINPGT731Cite as: 504 U. S. 719 (1992)Opinion of the Courtpetitioner be permitted to have the jurors interrogatedon the issue of racial bias." Id., at 526-527.We have also come to recognize that the principles firstpropounded in Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U. S. 510 (1968),the reverse of which are at issue here, demand inquiry intowhether the views of prospective jurors on the death penaltywould disqualify them from sitting.6 At its inception, With-erspoon conferred no "right" on a State, but was in reality alimitation of a State's making unlimited challenges for causeto exclude those jurors who "might hesitate" to return a verdict imposing death. Id., at 512-513; see Adams v. Texas,448 U. S., at 47-49. Upon consideration of the jury inWith-erspoon, drawn as it was from a venire from which the Statestruck any juror expressing qualms about the death penalty,6 Illinois argues that, because of the changed structure in death penaltyjurisprudence since Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238 (1972), Witherspoonprinciples should no longer guide this area. But analogous argumentshave been previously raised and rejected. Adams v. Texas, 448 U. S. 38,45-47 (1980). When considering the Texas death penalty scheme in lightof Witherspoon, we stated: "[J]urors in Texas must determine whetherthe evidence presented by the State convinces them beyond reasonabledoubt that each of the three questions put to them must be answered inthe affirmative. In doing so, they must consider both aggravating andmitigating circumstances, whether appearing in the evidence presented atthe trial on guilt or innocence or during the sentencing proceedings. Jurors will characteristically know that affirmative answers to the questionswill result in the automatic imposition of the death penalty, and each ofthe jurors whose exclusion is challenged by petitioner was so informed.In essence, Texas juries must be allowed to consider `on the basis of allrelevant evidence not only why a death sentence should be imposed, butalso why it should not be imposed.' Jurek v. Texas, 428 U. S. 262, 271(1976) (opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.). This process is notan exact science, and the jurors under the Texas bifurcated procedureunavoidably exercise a range of judgment and discretion while remainingtrue to their instructions and their oaths." Adams, supra, at 46 (citationomitted). The balancing approach chosen by Illinois vests considerablymore discretion in the jurors considering the death penalty, and, withstronger reason, Witherspoon's general principles apply. Cf. Turner v.Murray, 476 U. S. 28, 34-35 (1986) (plurality opinion).504us2$91K 04-08-96 07:15:12 PAGES OPINPGT732 MORGAN v. ILLINOISOpinion of the Courtwe found it "self-evident that, in its role as arbiter of thepunishment to be imposed, this jury fell woefully short ofthat impartiality to which the petitioner was entitled underthe Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments." 391 U. S., at 518.To preserve this impartiality, Witherspoon constrained theState's exercise of challenges for cause:"[A] State may not entrust the determination of whethera man should live or die to a tribunal organized to returna verdict of death. Specifically, we hold that a sentenceof death cannot be carried out if the jury that imposedor recommended it was chosen by excluding veniremenfor cause simply because they voiced general objectionsto the death penalty or expressed conscientious or religious scruples against its infliction. No defendant canconstitutionally be put to death at the hands of a tribunal so selected." Id., at 520-523 (footnotes omitted).See also Lockhart v. McCree, 476 U. S. 162, 179-180 (1986).Witherspoon limited a State's power broadly to exclude jurors hesitant in their ability to sentence a defendant to death,but nothing in that decision questioned "the power of a Stateto execute a defendant sentenced to death by a jury fromwhich the only veniremen who were in fact excluded forcause were those who made unmistakably clear . . . that theywould automatically vote against the imposition of capitalpunishment without regard to any evidence that might bedeveloped at the trial of the case before them . . . ." 391U. S., at 522, n. 21 (emphasis in original); see also id., at513-514.In Wainwright v. Witt, 469 U. S. 412 (1985), we revisitedfootnote 21 of Witherspoon, and held affirmatively that"the State may exclude from capital sentencing juries that`class' of veniremen whose views would prevent or substantially impair the performance of their duties in accord504us2$91K 04-08-96 07:15:12 PAGES OPINPGT733Cite as: 504 U. S. 719 (1992)Opinion of the Courtance with their instructions or their oaths." 469 U. S., at424, n. 5; see also Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586, 595-596(1978). Indeed, in Lockhart v. McCree we thereafter spokein terms of " `Witherspoon-excludables' " whose removal forcause "serves the State's entirely proper interest in obtaining a single jury that could impartially decide all of the issues in [a capital] case." 476 U. S., at 180. From Witt,moreover, it was but a very short step to observe as wellin Lockhart:"[T]he State may challenge for cause prospective jurorswhose opposition to the death penalty is so strong thatit would prevent them from impartially determining acapital defendant's guilt or innocence. Ipso facto, theState must be given the opportunity to identify suchprospective jurors by questioning them at voir direabout their views of the death penalty." 476 U. S., at170, n. 7.This passage in Lockhart expanded but briefly upon whatwe had already recognized in Witt: "As with any other trialsituation where an adversary wishes to exclude a juror because of bias, then, it is the adversary seeking exclusion whomust demonstrate, through questioning, that the potentialjuror lacks impartiality.

Were voir direnot available to lay bare the foundation of petitioner's challenge for cause against those prospective jurors who wouldalways impose death following conviction, his right not tobe tried by such jurors would be rendered as nugatory and504us2$91K 04-08-96 07:15:12 PAGES OPINPGT734 MORGAN v. ILLINOISOpinion of the Courtmeaningless as the State's right, in the absence of question-ing, to strike those who would never do so.7DThe only issue remaining is whether the questions pro-pounded by the trial court were sufficient to satisfy petitioner's right to make inquiry. As noted above, Illinois suggeststhat general fairness and "follow the law" questions, of thelike employed by the trial court here, are enough to detectthose in the venire who automatically would vote for thedeath penalty.8 The State's own request for questioningunderWitherspoon and Witt of course belies this argument.Witherspoon and its succeeding cases would be in largemeasure superfluous were this Court convinced that suchgeneral inquiries could detect those jurors with views pre7 As the Fifth Circuit has observed obiter dictum: "All veniremen arepotentially biased. The process of voir dire is designed to cull from thevenire persons who demonstrate that they cannot be fair to either side ofthe case. Clearly, the extremes must be eliminated--i. e., those who, inspite of the evidence, would automatically vote to convict or impose thedeath penalty or automatically vote to acquit or impose a life sentence."Smith v. Balkcom, 660 F. 2d 573, 578 (1981) (emphasis in original), modified, 671 F. 2d 858, cert. denied, 459 U. S. 882 (1982).8 Almost in passing the State also suggests that the "reverseWitherspoon" inquiry is inapposite because of a putative "quantitative difference." Illinois requires a unanimous verdict in favor of imposingdeath, see supra, at 721-722; thus any one juror can nullify the impositionof the death penalty. "Persons automatically for the death penalty wouldnot carry the same weight," Illinois argues, "because persons automatically for the death penalty would still need to persuade the remainingeleven jurors to vote for the death penalty." Brief for Respondent 27.The dissent chooses to champion this argument, post, at 750, although itis clearly foreclosed by Ross v. Oklahoma, 487 U. S. 81, 85 (1988), wherewe held that even one such juror on the panel would be one too many.See supra, at 728-729. In any event, the measure of a jury is taken byreference to the impartiality of each, individual juror. Illinois has chosento provide a capital defendant 12 jurors to decide his fate, and each ofthese jurors must stand equally impartial in his or her ability to followthe law.504us2$91K 04-08-96 07:15:12 PAGES OPINPGT735Cite as: 504 U.

But such jurors--whetherthey be unalterably in favor of, or opposed to, the death pen-alty in every case--by definition are ones who cannot perform their duties in accordance with law, their protestationsto the contrary notwithstanding.As to general questions of fairness and impartiality, suchjurors could in all truth and candor respond affirmatively,personally confident that such dogmatic views are fair andimpartial, while leaving the specific concern unprobed.More importantly, however, the belief that death should beimposedipso facto upon conviction of a capital offense re-flects directly on that individual's inability to follow the law.See supra, at 729. Any juror who would impose death re-gardless of the facts and circumstances of conviction cannotfollow the dictates of law. See Turner v. Murray, 476 U. S.,at 34-35 (plurality opinion). It may be that a juror could,in good conscience, swear to uphold the law and yet be un-aware that maintaining such dogmatic beliefs about thedeath penalty would prevent him or her from doing so.9 Adefendant on trial for his life must be permitted on voir dire9 That certain prospective jurors maintain such inconsistent beliefs--that they can follow the law, but that they will always vote to imposedeath for conviction of a capital offense--has been demonstrated, even inthis case. See n. 2, supra. Indeed, in Wainwright v. Witt, 469 U. S. 412(1985), we set forth the following exchange, highlighting this inconsistencyin beliefs in regards to Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U. S. 510 (1968):"THE COURT: Wait a minute, ma'am. I haven't made up my mindyet. Just have a seat. Let me ask you these things. Do you have anyprefixed ideas about this case at all?"[A]: Not at all."THE COURT: Will you follow the law that I give you?"[A]: I could do that."THE COURT: What I am concerned about is that you indicated thatyou have a state of mind that might make you be unable to follow the lawof this State."[A]: I could not bring back a death penalty."THE COURT: Step down." 469 U.

The risk that such jurors may havebeen empaneled in this case and "infected petitioner's capitalsentencing [is] unacceptable in light of the ease with whichthat risk could have been minimized." Id., at 36 (footnoteomitted). Petitioner was entitled, upon his request, to inquiry discerning those jurors who, even prior to the State'scase in chief, had predetermined the terminating issue of histrial, that being whether to impose the death penalty.IIIJustice Scalia, in dissent, insists that Illinois is entitledto try a death penalty case with 1 or even 12 jurors whoupon inquiry announce that they would automatically vote toimpose the death penalty if the defendant is found guiltyof a capital offense, no matter what the so-called mitigatingfactors, whether statutory or nonstatutory, might be.Post,at 742-746. But such jurors obviously deem mitigating evidence to be irrelevant to their decision to impose the deathpenalty: They not only refuse to give such evidence anyweight but are also plainly saying that mitigating evidenceis not worth their consideration and that they will not consider it. While Justice Scalia's jaundiced view of our de-cision today may best be explained by his rejection of theline of cases tracing from Woodson v. North Carolina, 428U. S. 280 (1976), andLockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586 (1978), anddeveloping the nature and role of mitigating evidence in thetrial of capital offenses, see Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639,669-673 (1990) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurringin judgment);Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 833 (1991)(Scalia, J., concurring); Sochor v. Florida, ante, at 554(Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), it is aview long rejected by this Court. More important to ourpurposes here, however, his view finds no support in eitherthe statutory or decisional law of Illinois because that law isconsistent with the requirements concerning mitigating evi504us2$91K 04-08-96 07:15:12 PAGES OPINPGT737Cite as: 504 U.

Mur-ray, supra, at 34-35 (plurality opinion).The Illinois death penalty statute provides that "[t]hecourt shall consider, or shall instruct the jury to consider anyaggravating and any mitigating factors which are relevant tothe imposition of the death penalty," Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 38,|| 9-1(c) (Supp. 1990), and lists certain mitigating factors thatthe legislature must have deemed relevant to such imposition, ibid.10 The statute explicitly directs the procedurecontrolling this jury deliberation:"If there is a unanimous finding by the jury that one ormore of the factors [enumerated in aggravation] exist,the jury shall consider aggravating and mitigating fac-tors as instructed by the court and shall determinewhether the sentence of death shall be imposed. If thejury determines unanimously that there are no mitigating factors sufficient to preclude the imposition of thedeath sentence, the court shall sentence the defendantto death." || 9-1(g).In accord with this statutory procedure, the trial judge inthis case instructed the jury:"In deciding whether the Defendant should be sen-tenced to death, you should consider all the aggravating10 Illinois Rev. Stat., ch. 38, || 9-1(c) (Supp. 1990), provides:"Mitigating factors may include but need not be limited to the following:"(1) the defendant has no significant history of prior criminal activity;"(2) the murder was committed while the defendant was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance, although not such as toconstitute a defense to prosecution;"(3) the murdered individual was a participant in the defendant's homicidal conduct or consented to the homicidal act;"(4) the defendant acted under the compulsion of threat or menace of theimminent infliction of death or great bodily harm;"(5) the defendant was not personally present during commission of theact or acts causing death."504us2$91K 04-08-96 07:15:12 PAGES OPINPGT738 MORGAN v. ILLINOISOpinion of the Courtfactors supported by the evidence and all the mitigatingfactors supported by the evidence.. . . . ."If you unanimously find, from your consideration ofall the evidence, that there are no mitigating factors sufficient to preclude imposition of the death sentence, thenyou should sign the verdict requiring the Court sentencethe Defendant to death." App. 122-123.Any juror who states that he or she will automatically votefor the death penalty without regard to the mitigating evidence is announcing an intention not to follow the instruc-tions to consider the mitigating evidence and to decide if it issufficient to preclude imposition of the death penalty. Anycontrary reading of this instruction, or more importantly, thecontrolling statute, renders the term "sufficient" meaning-less. The statute plainly indicates that a lesser sentence isavailable in every case where mitigating evidence exists;thus any juror who would invariably impose the death penalty upon conviction cannot be said to have reached thisdecision based on all the evidence. WhileJustice Scaliachooses to argue that such a "merciless juro[r]" is not a "lawless" one, post, at 751, he is in error, for such a juror will notgive mitigating evidence the consideration that the statutecontemplates. Indeed, the Illinois Supreme Court recog-nizes that jurors are not impartial if they would automatically vote for the death penalty, and that questioning inthe manner petitioner requests is a direct and helpful meansof protecting a defendant's right to an impartial jury. Seen. 3, supra. The State has not suggested otherwise in thisCourt.Surely if in a particular Illinois case the judge, who imposes sentence should the defendant waive his right to jurysentencing under the statute, see n. 1,supra, was to an-nounce that, to him or her, mitigating evidence is beside thepoint and that he or she intends to impose the death penaltywithout regard to the nature or extent of mitigating evidence504us2$91K 04-08-96 07:15:12 PAGES OPINPGT739Cite as: 504 U. S. 719 (1992)Scalia, J., dissentingif the defendant is found guilty of a capital offense, that judgeis refusing in advance to follow the statutory direction toconsider that evidence and should disqualify himself or herself. Any juror to whom mitigating factors are likewise irrelevant should be disqualified for cause, for that juror hasformed an opinion concerning the merits of the case withoutbasis in the evidence developed at trial. Accordingly, thedefendant in this case was entitled to have the inquiry madethat he proposed to the trial judge.IVBecause the "inadequacy of voir dire" leads us to doubtthat petitioner was sentenced to death by a jury empaneledin compliance with the Fourteenth Amendment, his sentencecannot stand.11 Turner v. Murray, 476 U. S., at 37. Accordingly, the judgment of the Illinois Supreme Court affirmingpetitioner's death sentence is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with thisopinion.
