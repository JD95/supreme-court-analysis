On June 30,1988, we granted Wyoming leave to file its bill of complaintover Oklahoma's objections that Wyoming lacked standing tobring this action and, in any event, should not be permittedto invoke this Court's original jurisdiction. 487 U. S. 1231.Oklahoma next filed a motion to dismiss on August 29, 1988,raising these same arguments. We denied the motion to dismiss on October 31, 1988, and ordered Oklahoma to answerWyoming's complaint within 30 days. 488 U. S. 921. Wethereafter appointed the Special Master, 489 U. S. 1063(1989), who ordered the parties to complete discovery and tofile a stipulation of uncontested facts, any affidavits believedto be necessary, and a short statement of any disputed issuesof material fact that may require a hearing. The partiescomplied, and each moved for summary judgment. Wyoming argued that the Act is a per se violation of the Commerce Clause. Oklahoma reasserted its arguments onstanding and the appropriateness of this Court's exercise oforiginal jurisdiction, submitting as well that the Act wasconstitutional.The Report of the Special Master was received and ordered filed on October 1, 1990. 498 U. S. 803. Based on therecord before him, the Special Master recommended findingsof fact, to which the parties do not object, and conclusionsof law generally supporting Wyoming's motion for summaryjudgment and rejecting Oklahoma's motion for summaryjudgment. More specifically, the Report recommends thatwe hold, first, that Wyoming has standing to sue and thatthis case is appropriate to our original jurisdiction; and second, that the Act discriminates against interstate commerceon its face and in practical effect, that this discrimination isnot justified by any purpose advanced by Oklahoma, and thatthe Act therefore violates the Commerce Clause. The Report also recommends that the Court either dismiss the action as it relates to an Oklahoma-owned utility without prejudice to Wyoming to assert its claim in an appropriate forum,502US2$28D 02-10-99 15:12:54 PAGES OPINPGT442 WYOMING v. OKLAHOMAOpinion of the Courtor, alternatively, find the Act severable to the extent it mayconstitutionally be applied to that utility.Subsequently, the parties requested the Court to enter astipulated decree adopting the Special Master's Report andcontaining conclusions of law.2 If the decree was to rule onthe constitutionality of the Act, however, we preferred tohave that issue briefed and argued, and the case was setdown for oral argument. 501 U. S. 1215 (1991). We nowadopt the Special Master's recommended findings of fact,and, with one exception, his recommended conclusions of law.IThe salient facts, gathered from those recommended bythe Special Master and from other materials in the record,are as follows.Wyoming is a major coal-producing State and in 1988shipped coal to 19 other States.3 While the State of Wyoming does not itself sell coal, it does impose a severance taxupon the privilege of severing or extracting coal from landwithin its boundaries. Wyo. Stat. $$ 39-6-301 to 39-6-308(1990 and Supp. 1991). The tax is assessed against the person or company extracting the coal and is payable when thecoal is extracted. The valuation of the coal for severancetax purposes is based on its fair market value. Wyominghas collected severance taxes on coal extracted by eight2 In the proposed decree, the parties agreed to the Special Master's findings of fact and his conclusions that the Act, as applied to the privatelyowned utilities, violated the Commerce Clause, but that, as applied to theOklahoma-owned utility, the Act was constitutional. Oklahoma agreedthat application of the Act to the private utilities would be enjoined, andWyoming agreed that the Act would not be enjoined as to the stateowned utility.3 In 1988, just over 163.8 million tons of Wyoming coal was mined. Only14.6% of Wyoming's coal production was sold in-state. Oklahoma purchased 8% of the coal mined, making it the third largest out-of-state consumer, behind Texas at 19.7% and Kansas at 8.3%.502US2$28D 02-10-99 15:12:54 PAGES OPINPGT443Cite as: 502 U.

OKLAHOMAOpinion of the CourtThe four Oklahoma electric utilities subject to the requirements of the Act are Oklahoma Gas and Electric Company,Public Service Company of Oklahoma, and Western FarmersElectric Cooperative, all privately owned, and the GrandRiver Dam Authority (GRDA), an agency of the State ofOklahoma. None of these four heeded this precatory resolution. At its second session, the 40th Legislature adoptedthe Act challenged in this case, thus mandating the 10% minimum purchases that the previous resolution had requested.Fifteen months after the effective date of the Act, facingsubstantially less than full compliance by any of the utilities,4the next Oklahoma Legislature adopted a concurrent resolution directing the GRDA, Oklahoma's state-owned publicutility, to comply with the Act.

However,violations of the Act can be prosecuted as a misdemeanor, and the utilitiescan be enjoined from further violations upon recommendation of Oklahoma's State Mining Commission. See Oklahoma's Response to Wyoming'sInterrogatory No. 6.5 The recitals and resolutions included the following:"WHEREAS, the passage of this law in 1986 has provided over 700 newjobs in Oklahoma's coal mining industry and related employment sectors;and"WHEREAS, another benefit of this law is an additional $31 million oftaxable income has been generated through the purchases of Oklahomamined coal; and. . . . ."WHEREAS, the Grand River Dam Authority has failed to comply withsaid law and has refused to recognize the intent of the Oklahoma StateLegislature to utilize Oklahoma mined coal."NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED . . . :"THAT the Oklahoma State Legislature hereby directs the Grand RiverDam Authority to immediately begin purchasing Oklahoma mined coal andto comply with the law as stated in [the Act]."502US2$28D 02-10-99 15:12:54 PAGES OPINPGT445Cite as: 502 U. S. 437 (1992)Opinion of the Courtthrough the first four months of 1989. See Report of SpecialMaster 7-8. Those charts reveal that during the years 1981through 1984, the four Oklahoma utilities purchased virtually100% of their coal requirements from Wyoming sources.These purchases decreased slightly, if at all, in 1985 and 1986following the adoption of the original concurrent resolution.After January 1, 1987, the effective date of the Act, theseutilities reduced their purchases of Wyoming coal in favor ofcoal mined in Oklahoma.Unrebutted evidence demonstrates that, since the effective date of the Act, Wyoming has lost severance taxes inthe amounts of $535,886 in 1987, $542,352 in 1988, and $87,130in the first four months of 1989.6 These estimates are basedon an equivalence of British Thermal Unit (BTU) ratings,thus accounting for the hotter burning propensities of Oklahoma coal.7 Other unrebutted submissions confirm thatWyoming has a significant excess mining capacity, such that6 See Affidavit of Richard J. Marble, Director, Minerals Tax Division,Wyoming Department of Revenue and Taxation 3 (Exh. B to Appendix toMotion of Wyoming for Summary Judgment). Oklahoma does not contradict these estimates. Instead, its expert, an economist familiar with energy and coal-related issues, emphasizes only that Wyoming experienceda more severe loss in severance tax revenues due to its reduction of theseverance tax rate and a decline in coal market prices. Affidavit of DavidM. Weinstein 2-3 (Exh. G to Appendix to Motion of Oklahoma for Summary Judgment). At best, Oklahoma's counteraffidavit suggests that theestimate of lost severance tax revenues is a bit too high, pointing to theslight percentages of Oklahoma coal purchased prior to the Act as indicative that Wyoming did not provide 100% of the coal purchased. Id., at 3.7 A coal's BTU rating reflects the heat-generating efficiency of the coalwhen burned. Coal extracted from Wyoming's Powder River Basin--thesource of coal shipped to Oklahoma since 1980--has a lower average BTUrating than the Oklahoma coal delivered to the utilities. Accordingly ittakes less Oklahoma coal by weight to generate the same amount of energy as the Wyoming coal. Because sulfur content factors into Oklahoma's later argument, we note here as well that Wyoming coal has a loweraverage sulfur content than Oklahoma coal, thus less sulfur escapes andpollutes the air when Wyoming coal is burned.502US2$28D 02-10-99 15:12:54 PAGES OPINPGT446 WYOMING v. OKLAHOMAOpinion of the Courtthe loss of any market cannot be made up by sales elsewhere,where Wyoming's supply has already risen to meet demand.8IIIn its motion for summary judgment before the SpecialMaster, Oklahoma again challenged Wyoming's standing, andnow excepts to the Special Master's recommendation thatwe reject Oklahoma's submission in this respect. Havinggranted Wyoming leave to file its complaint over Oklahoma'sobjection to standing, and having denied Oklahoma's motionto dismiss for want of standing, and the parties having sub-mitted the case on cross-motions for summary judgment, weare not at all inclined to dismiss the action at this juncture.Although we have been reluctant to import wholesale lawof-the-case principles into original actions, Arizona v. Cali-fornia, 460 U. S. 605, 618-619 (1983), prior rulings in suchcases "should be subject to the general principles of finalityand repose, absent changed circumstances or unforeseen issues not previously litigated." Id., at 619. Here, Oklahomain no way suggests any change of circumstance, whether offact or law. In each brief submitted on the issue, Oklahomahas recited the same facts, cited the same cases, and constructed the same arguments. Of course, we surely havethe power to accede to Oklahoma's request at this late date,and if convinced, which we are not, that we were clearlywrong in accepting jurisdiction of this case, we would nothesitate to depart from our prior rulings.8 One affidavit, from a principal of a consulting firm conducting economicanalysis of the coal industry, reflects that in 1987 the Wyoming PowderRiver Basin had an annual production capacity of 186.4 million tons, versusactual 1987 production of 127.1 million tons. Affidavit of Seth Schwartz(Appendix to Response to Motion to Dismiss A-2). Moreover, the Director of the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality, who overseesprograms for permitting coal mines, informs us that as of 1987, permittedcapacity in the Powder River Basin was 318 million tons, whereas totalproduction from all coal mines was 146.5 million tons. Affidavit of Randolph Wood (Appendix to Response to Motion to Dismiss A-5).502US2$28D 02-10-99 15:12:54 PAGES OPINPGT447Cite as: 502 U. S. 437 (1992)Opinion of the CourtArticle III, $ 2, cl. 2, of the United States Constitution provides this Court with original jurisdiction in all cases "inwhich a State shall be a Party." Congress has seen fit todesignate that this Court "shall have original and exclusivejurisdiction of all controversies between two or moreStates." 28 U. S. C. $ 1251(a). "In order to constitute aproper `controversy' under our original jurisdiction, `it mustappear that the complaining State has suffered a wrongthrough the action of the other State, furnishing ground forjudicial redress, or is asserting a right against the otherState which is susceptible of judicial enforcement accordingto the accepted principles of the common law or equity systems of jurisprudence.' " Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U. S.725, 735-736 (1981) (quoting Massachusetts v. Missouri, 308U. S. 1, 15 (1939)); see also New York v. Illinois, 274 U. S.488, 490 (1927).We are quite sure that Wyoming's submission satisfies thistest. We agree with the Master's conclusion, arrived atafter consideration of all the facts submitted to him, thatWyoming clearly had standing to bring this action. TheMaster observed:"The effect of the Oklahoma statute has been to deprive Wyoming of severance tax revenues. It is undisputed that since January 1, 1987, the effective date ofthe Act, purchases by Oklahoma electric utilities ofWyoming-mined coal, as a percentage of their total coalpurchases, have declined. . . . The decline came when, inresponse to the adoption of the Act, those utilities beganpurchasing Oklahoma-mined coal. The coal that, in theabsence of the Act, would have been sold to Oklahomautilities by a Wyoming producer would have been subject to the tax when extracted. Wyoming's loss of severance tax revenues `fairly can be traced' to the Act.See Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U. S. 725, 736 (1981)(quoting Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights502US2$28D 02-10-99 15:12:54 PAGES OPINPGT448 WYOMING v. OKLAHOMAOpinion of the CourtOrganization, 426 U. S. 26, 41-42 (1976))." Report ofSpecial Master 11.9The Master recognized that Courts of Appeals have deniedstanding to States where the claim was that actions takenby United States Government agencies had injured a State'seconomy and thereby caused a decline in general tax revenues. See, e. g., Pennsylvania v. Kleppe, 174 U. S. App.D. C. 441, 533 F. 2d 668, cert. denied, 429 U. S. 977 (1976);State of Iowa ex rel. Miller v. Block, 771 F. 2d 347 (CA81985), cert. denied, 478 U. S. 1012 (1986). He concluded,however, that none of these cases was analogous to this onebecause none of them involved a direct injury in the form ofa loss of specific tax revenues--an undisputed fact here.See n. 6,supra. In our view, the Master's conclusion aboutWyoming's standing is sound.Oklahoma argues that Wyoming is not itself engaged inthe commerce affected, is not affected as a consumer, andthus has not suffered the type of direct injury cognizablein a Commerce Clause action. The authorities relied on byOklahoma for this argument, Oklahoma v. Atchison, T. &S. F. R. Co., 220 U. S. 277, 287-289 (1911), and Louisiana v.Texas, 176 U. S. 1, 16-22 (1900), are not helpful, however, forthey involved claims of parens patriae standing rather than9 We note as well that the recitals in Oklahoma's initial concurrent resolution reflect that coal-fired electric plants within Oklahoma were exclusively using Wyoming coal, with the attendant recognition that "$9 millionof the ratepayers dollars was paid as severance tax to the State of Wyoming." Res. 21. The Wyoming coal that would have been sold--but nolonger will be sold due to the Act--to Oklahoma utilities by a Wyomingproducer is subject to the tax when extracted. Wyoming, which standsto regain these lost revenues should its suit to overturn the Act succeed,is thus "directly affected in a `substantial and real' way so as to justify[its] exercise of this Court's original jurisdiction." Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U. S. 725, 737 (1981); see also Texas v. Florida, 306 U. S. 398,407-408 (1939); Simon v. Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Organization, 426U. S. 26, 39 (1976) (plaintiff seeking to invoke Article III judicial powermust "stand to profit in some personal interest").502US2$28D 02-10-99 15:12:54 PAGES OPINPGT449Cite as: 502 U. S. 437 (1992)Opinion of the Courtallegations of direct injury to the State itself. Moreover, wehave rejected a similar argument in Hunt v. WashingtonState Apple Advertising Comm'n, 432 U. S. 333 (1977). InHunt, the Washington State Apple Advertising Commissionbrought suit to declare as violative of the Commerce Clausea North Carolina statute requiring that all apples sold orshipped into North Carolina in closed containers be identifiedby no grade other than the applicable federal grade or a designation that the apples were not graded. The commissionwas a statutory agency designed for the promotion and protection of the Washington State apple industry and com-posed of 13 state growers and dealers chosen from electoraldistricts by their fellow growers and dealers, all of whom bymandatory assessments financed the commission's operations. The North Carolina officials named in the suit vigor-ously contested the commission's standing, either in its ownright or on behalf of the apple industry it represented, ar-guing that it lacked a "personal stake" in the litigation because, as a state agency, it was "not itself engaged in theproduction and sale of Washington apples or their shipmentinto North Carolina." Id., at 341. After addressing thecommission's analogues to associational standing, we turnedto the commission's allegations of direct injury:"Finally, we note that the interests of the Commissionitself may be adversely affected by the outcome of thislitigation. The annual assessments paid to the Commis-sion are tied to the volume of apples grown and packaged as `Washington Apples.' In the event the NorthCarolina statute results in a contraction of the marketfor Washington apples or prevents any market expan-sion that might otherwise occur, it could reduce theamount of the assessments due the Commission andused to support its activities. This financial nexus between the interests of the Commission and its constit-uents coalesces with the other factors noted above to`assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the502US2$28D 02-10-99 15:12:54 PAGES OPINPGT450 WYOMING v.

S. 186, 204 (1962)]; seealso NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357 U. S.449, 459-460 (1958)." Id., at 345.That the commission was allowed to proceed in Hunt nec-essarily supports Wyoming's standing against Oklahoma,where its severance tax revenues are directly linked to theextraction and sale of coal and have been demonstrably affected by the Act.Over Oklahoma's objection, which is repeated here, theSpecial Master also concluded that this case was an appro-priate one for the exercise of our original jurisdiction. Weagree, and we obviously shared this thought when grantingWyoming leave to file its complaint in the first instance. Wehave generally observed that the Court's original jurisdic-tion should be exercised "sparingly,"Maryland v. Louisi-ana, 451 U. S., at 739; United States v. Nevada, 412 U. S. 534,538 (1973), and this Court applies discretion when acceptingoriginal cases, even as to actions between States where ourjurisdiction is exclusive. As stated not long ago:"In recent years, we have consistently interpreted 28U. S. C. $ 1251(a) as providing us with substantial discretion to make case-by-case judgments as to the practicalnecessity of an original forum in this Court for particular disputes within our constitutional original jurisdic-tion. See Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U. S. 725, 743(1981); Ohio v. Wyandotte Chemicals Corp., 401 U. S.493, 499 (1971). We exercise that discretion with an eyeto promoting the most effective functioning of this Courtwithin the overall federal system." Texas v. New Mexico, 462 U. S. 554, 570 (1983).Specifically, we have imposed prudential and equitable lim-itations upon the exercise of our original jurisdiction, and ofthese limitations we have said:502US2$28D 02-10-99 15:12:54 PAGES OPINPGT451Cite as: 502 U. S. 437 (1992)Opinion of the Court" `We construe 28 U. S. C. $ 1251(a)(1), as we do Art. III,$ 2, cl. 2, to honor our original jurisdiction but to makeit obligatory only in appropriate cases. And the question of what is appropriate concerns, of course, the seriousness and dignity of the claim; yet beyond that it necessarily involves the availability of another forum wherethere is jurisdiction over the named parties, where theissues tendered may be litigated, and where appropriaterelief may be had.' " Illinois v. City of Milwaukee, 406U. S. 91, 93 (1972), quoted in California v. Texas, 457U. S. 164, 168 (1982).It is beyond peradventure that Wyoming has raised aclaim of sufficient "seriousness and dignity." Oklahoma, acting in its sovereign capacity, passed the Act, which directlyaffects Wyoming's ability to collect severance tax revenues,an action undertaken in its sovereign capacity. As such,Wyoming's challenge under the Commerce Clause precisely"implicates serious and important concerns of federalismfully in accord with the purposes and reach of our originaljurisdiction." Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U. S., at 744.Indeed, we found it not to be a "waste" of this Court's timein Maryland v. Louisiana to consider the validity of oneState's "first-use tax" which served, in effect, as a severancetax on gas extracted from areas belonging to the people atlarge, to the detriment of other States on to whose consumers the tax passed. Ibid. Wyoming's claim here is no lesssubstantial, and touches on its direct injury rather than onany interest as parens patriae.Oklahoma makes much of the fact that the mining companies affected in Wyoming could bring suit raising theCommerce Clause challenge, as private parties aggrievedby state action often do. But cf. Hunt v. WashingtonState Apple Advertising Comm'n, supra. For reasonsunknown, however, they have chosen neither to intervene in this action nor to file their own, whether in state or502US2$28D 02-10-99 15:12:54 PAGES OPINPGT452 WYOMING v. OKLAHOMAOpinion of the Courtfederal court.10 As such, no pending action exists to whichwe could defer adjudication on this issue. See,e. g., Illinoisv. City of Milwaukee, supra, at 98, 108; Washington v. General Motors Corp., 406 U. S. 109, 114 (1972). Even if suchaction were proceeding, however, Wyoming's interests wouldnot be directly represented. See Maryland v. Louisiana,supra, at 743; cf. Arizona v. New Mexico, 425 U. S. 794(1976). Indeed, Wyoming brings suit as a sovereign seekingdeclaration from this Court that Oklahoma's Act is unconstitutional. The Constitution provides us original jurisdiction,and Congress has made this provision exclusive as betweenthese parties, two States. It was proper to entertain thiscase without assurances, notably absent here, that a State'sinterests under the Constitution will find a forum for appropriate hearing and full relief.Oklahoma points to the general requirement, reflected inthe controlling principles explained above, that "[b]efore thiscourt can be moved to exercise its extraordinary powerunder the Constitution to control the conduct of one State atthe suit of another, the threatened invasion of rights mustbe of serious magnitude and it must be established by clearand convincing evidence." New York v. New Jersey, 256U. S. 296, 309 (1921); see also Connecticut v. Massachusetts,282 U. S. 660, 669 (1931); Missouri v. Illinois, 200 U. S. 496,521 (1906). On this basis Oklahoma suggests that Wyoming's interest is de minimis solely for the reason that lossin severance tax revenues attributable to the Act has generally been less than 1% of total taxes collected. See Affidavitof Richard J. Marble (Exh. B to Appendix to Motion of Wyo10 A challenge in the Oklahoma courts brought by a group of Oklahomaconsumers was dismissed for lack of standing, upon a finding that theycould not suffer injury due to the Act's prohibition on cost increaseto consumers.

S. 437 (1992)Opinion of the Courtming for Summary Judgment). We decline any invitation tokey the exercise of this Court's original jurisdiction on theamount in controversy.11 Oklahoma's argument is, in fact,no different than the situation we faced in Pennsylvania v.West Virginia, 262 U. S. 553 (1923). When Pennsylvaniachallenged a West Virginia statute designed to keep natural gas within its borders, there was no question but thatthe issue presented rose to a level suitable to our originaljurisdiction:"The question is an important one; for what one Statemay do others may, and there are ten States from whichnatural gas is exported for consumption in other States.Besides, what may be done with one natural productmay be done with others, and there are several Statesin which the earth yields products of great value whichare carried into other States and there used." Id., at596.And so it is here. Wyoming coal is a natural resource ofgreat value primarily carried into other States for use, andWyoming derives significant revenue from this interstatemovement. "[T]he practical effect of [Oklahoma's] statutemust be evaluated not only by considering the consequencesof the statute itself, but also by considering how the challenged statute may interact with the legitimate regulatoryregimes of the other States and what effect would arise if not11 We would not, in any event, readily find the amount here to be deminimis. True, the taxes lost have amounted to less than 1% of revenues received by Wyoming, but even this fractional percentage exceeds$500,000 per year. Wyoming approaches this case viewing such a drainon its tax base year after year, and it aptly paraphrases a famous statement of Senator Everett Dirkson: "[A] half million dollars here and a halfmillion dollars there, and pretty soon real money is involved." ReplyBrief for Wyoming 5, n. 3. See Respectfully Quoted: A Dictionary of Quotations Requested from the Congressional Research Service 155 (S. Platted. 1989) ("A billion here, a billion there, and pretty soon you're talkingabout real money").502US2$28D 02-10-99 15:12:54 PAGES OPINPGT454 WYOMING v.

S. 324, 336 (1989).Because of the nature of Wyoming's claim, and the absenceof any other pending litigation involving the same parties orissues, we find the present case appropriate for the exerciseof this Court's original jurisdiction. Accordingly, we acceptthe recommendation of the Special Master that Wyomingshould be permitted to bring this action, and we reject Oklahoma's exceptions to the Special Master's Report.IIIWe also agree with the Special Master's ultimate conclu-sion that the Act is invalid under the Commerce Clause.The Commerce Clause of the United States Constitutionprovides that "[t]he Congress shall have Power . . . [t]o regulate Commerce . . . among the several States . . . ." Art. I,$ 8, cl. 3. It is long established that, while a literal readingevinces a grant of power to Congress, the Commerce Clausealso directly limits the power of the States to discriminateagainst interstate commerce. See New Energy Co. of Indiana v. Limbach, 486 U. S. 269, 273 (1988) (citing Hughes v.Oklahoma, 441 U. S. 322, 326 (1979); H. P. Hood & Sons, Inc.v. Du Mond, 336 U. S. 525, 534-535 (1949); Welton v.

New Energy Co., supra, at 273-274; see also Bacchus Imports, Ltd.v. Dias, 468 U. S. 263, 270-273 (1984); H. P. Hood & Sons,supra, at 532-533. When a state statute clearly discrimi-nates against interstate commerce, it will be struck down,see, e. g., New Energy Co., supra, unless the discriminationis demonstrably justified by a valid factor unrelated to economic protectionism, see, e. g., Maine v. Taylor, 477 U. S. 131(1986). Indeed, when the state statute amounts to simpleeconomic protectionism, a "virtually per se rule of invalidity"502US2$28D 02-10-99 15:12:54 PAGES OPINPGT455Cite as: 502 U. S. 437 (1992)Opinion of the Courthas applied. Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U. S. 617,624 (1978).12The Special Master correctly found that the Act, on itsface and in practical effect, discriminates against interstatecommerce. See Bacchus Imports, Ltd. v. Dias, supra, at270. Section 939 of the Act expressly reserves a segmentof the Oklahoma coal market for Oklahoma-mined coal, to theexclusion of coal mined in other States. Such a preferencefor coal from domestic sources cannot be characterized asanything other than protectionist and discriminatory, for theAct purports to exclude coal mined in other States basedsolely on its origin. SeeNew Energy Co., supra, at 274;Philadelphia v. New Jersey, supra, at 626-627. The stipu-lated facts confirm that from 1981 to 1986 Wyoming providedvirtually 100% of the coal purchased by Oklahoma utilities.In 1987 and 1988, following the effective date of the Act, theutilities purchased Oklahoma coal in amounts ranging from3.4% to 7.4% of their annual needs, with a necessarily corresponding reduction in purchases of Wyoming coal.As in its jurisdictional arguments, Oklahoma attempts todiscount this evidence by emphasizing that the Act sets asideonly a "small portion" of the Oklahoma coal market, withoutplacing an "overall burden" on out-of-state coal producersdoing business in Oklahoma. The volume of commerce affected measures only the extent of the discrimination; it isof no relevance to the determination whether a State hasdiscriminated against interstate commerce. Bacchus Im12 There are circumstances in which a less strict scrutiny is appropriateunder our Commerce Clause decisions. "When . . . a statute has onlyindirect effects on interstate commerce and regulates evenhandedly, wehave examined whether the State's interest is legitimate and whetherthe burden on interstate commerce clearly exceeds the local benefits."Brown-Forman Distillers Corp. v. New York State Liquor Authority, 476U. S. 573, 579 (1986); see also Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U. S. 137,142 (1970). While we have recognized that there is no "clear line" separating close cases on which scrutiny should apply, Brown-Forman Distillers, supra, at 579, this is not a close case.502US2$28D 02-10-99 15:12:54 PAGES OPINPGT456 WYOMING v. OKLAHOMAOpinion of the Courtports, Ltd. v. Dias, supra, at 268-269; Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U. S., at 760; Lewis v. BT Investment Managers,Inc., 447 U. S. 27, 39-42 (1980). As we have only recentlyreaffirmed:"Our cases . . . indicate that where discrimination ispatent, as it is here, neither a widespread advantageto in-state interests nor a widespread disadvantage toout-of-state competitors need be shown. . . . Varying thestrength of the bar against economic protectionism ac-cording to the size and number of in-state and out-ofstate firms affected would serve no purpose except thecreation of new uncertainties in an already complexfield."New Energy Co., supra, at 276-277.Because the Act discriminates both on its face and in practical effect, the burden falls on Oklahoma " `to justify it bothin terms of the local benefits flowing from the statute and theunavailability of nondiscriminatory alternatives adequate topreserve the local interests at stake.' " Hughes v. Oklahoma, supra, at 336 (quoting Hunt v. Washington StateApple Advertising Comm'n, 432 U. S., at 353). "At a mini-mum such facial discrimination invokes the strictest scrutinyof any purported legitimate local purpose and of the absenceof nondiscriminatory alternatives."Hughes v. Oklahoma,supra, at 337. We agree with the Special Master's recommended conclusions that Oklahoma has not met its burden inthis respect. In this Court, Oklahoma argues quite brieflythat the Act's discrimination against out-of-state coal is justi-fied because sustaining the Oklahoma coal-mining industrylessens the State's reliance on a single source of coal delivered over a single rail line. This justification, as the SpecialMaster noted, is foreclosed by the Court's reasoning in Baldwin v. G. A. F. Seelig, Inc., 294 U. S. 511 (1935), and H. P.Hood & Sons, Inc. v. Du Mond, supra, cases that theState's brief ignores. We have often examined a "presumably legitimate goal," only to find that the State at502US2$28D 02-10-99 15:12:54 PAGES OPINPGT457Cite as: 502 U. S. 437 (1992)Opinion of the Courttempted to achieve it by "the illegitimate means of isolatingthe State from the national economy."Philadelphia v. NewJersey, supra, at 627.The State embellishes this argument somewhat when suggesting that, by requiring the utilities to supply 10% of theirneeds for fuel from Oklahoma coal, which because of itshigher sulfur content cannot be the primary source of supply,the State thereby conserves Wyoming's cleaner coal forfuture use. We have no reason to doubt Wyoming's unrebutted factual response to this argument: Reserves of lowsulfur, clean-burning, sub-bituminous coal from the PowderRiver Basin are estimated to be in excess of 110 billion tons,thus providing Wyoming coal for several hundred years atcurrent rates of extraction. Reply Brief for Wyoming 9, n. 4(citing Geological Survey of Wyoming, Guidebook of the CoalGeology of the Powder River Basin, Public Information Circular No. 14, p. 126 (1980)). In any event, this contention,which is raised for the first time in Oklahoma's brief on themerits, finds no support in the records made in this case.See Hughes v. Oklahoma, 441 U. S., at 337-338, and n. 20;cf. Maine v. Taylor, 477 U. S., at 148-149.Oklahoma argues more seriously that the "saving clause"of the Federal Power Act, 16 U. S. C. $ 824(b)(1),13 whichreserves to the States the regulation of local retail electricrates, makes permissible the Act's discriminatory impact onthe movement of Wyoming coal in interstate commerce. Oklahoma argues that it "has determined that effective and helpful ways of ensuring lower local utility rates include 1) reducing over-dependence on a single source of supply, a single13 "The provisions of this subchapter shall apply to the transmission ofelectric energy in interstate commerce and to the sale of electric energyat wholesale in interstate commerce, but except as provided in paragraph(2) shall not apply to any other sale of electric energy or deprive a Stateor State commission of its lawful authority now exercised over the exportation of hydroelectric energy which is transmitted across a State line."16 U.

Brief for Oklahoma 65. Even if the Act isaccepted as part of the State's rate-regulating authority, wecannot accept the submission that it is exempt from scrutinyunder the Commerce Clause. Congress must manifest itsunambiguous intent before a federal statute will be read topermit or to approve such a violation of the CommerceClause as Oklahoma here seeks to justify. Maine v. Taylor,supra, at 139; South-Central Timber Development, Inc. v.Wunnicke, 467 U. S. 82, 91 (1984). We have already exam-ined $ 824(b)(1) inNew England Power Co. v. New Hampshire, 455 U. S. 331 (1982), and found nothing in the statuteor legislative history "evinc[ing] a congressional intent `toalter the limits of state power otherwise imposed by theCommerce Clause.' " Id., at 341 (quoting United States v.Public Utilities Comm'n of Cal., 345 U. S. 295, 304 (1953)).There is no hint in that opinion, as suggested by Oklahoma,that a partial--instead of total--ban would have been permissible, or that in-state purchasing quotas imposed on utilities in an effort to regulate utility rates are within the "lawful authority" of the States under $ 824(b)(1). Instead, ourdecision turned on the recognition that "Congress did nomore than leave standing whatever valid state laws then existed relating to the exportation of hydroelectric energy; byits plain terms, [$ 824(b)] simply saves from pre-emptionunder Part II of the Federal Power Act such state authority as was otherwise `lawful.' " New England Power Co.,supra, at 341. Our decisions have uniformly subjected Commerce Clause cases implicating the Federal Power Act toscrutiny on the merits. See, e. g., New England Power Co.,supra; Arkansas Electric Cooperative Corp. v. ArkansasPub. Serv. Comm'n, 461 U. S. 375, 393 (1983).We need say no more to conclude that Oklahoma has notmet its burden of demonstrating a clear and unambiguousintent on behalf of Congress to permit the discriminationagainst interstate commerce occurring here. In light of the502US2$28D 02-10-99 15:12:54 PAGES OPINPGT459Cite as: 502 U. S. 437 (1992)Opinion of the Courtforegoing, we adopt the Special Master's conclusion that theAct manifests fatal defects under the Commerce Clause.IVFinally, we address a question of severability raised in theexceptions filed by Wyoming to the Special Master's Report.The GRDA is an agency of the State of Oklahoma, and, assuch, Oklahoma acts as a market participant in directing itspurchases of coal. We have recognized that the CommerceClause does not restrict the State's action as a free marketparticipant. Reeves, Inc. v. Stake, 447 U. S. 429, 436-437(1980);Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp., 426 U. S. 794,806-810 (1976). The Special Master recommends that themarket-participant exception is available to Oklahoma, butonly if the application of the Act to the GRDA may be considered separately, or severed, from its application to the threeprivate utilities. As the determination of severability willin this situation be one of state law, Hooper v. BernalilloCounty Assessor, 472 U. S. 612, 624 (1985), the Special Mas-ter recommends that we enter judgment with respect to thethree private utilities but dismiss Wyoming's complaint as itrelates to the GRDA without prejudice to the right of Wyoming to reassert the claim in an "appropriate forum." Re-port of Special Master 32. We sustain Wyoming's exceptionto these recommendations of the Special Master. This ac-tion is one between two States presented under our originaljurisdiction; this Court is the appropriate forum to decideissues necessary to afford the complaining State completerelief. Cf. Dorchy v. Kansas, 264 U. S. 286, 291 (1924). Wedeem it proper and advisable to address the issue of severability ourselves.In the alternative, the Special Master looked to Oklahomalaw and found the Act severable as to the GRDA, a conclu-sion with which we disagree. It is true that Oklahomacourts have held that valid portions of a statute are sever-able " `unless it is evident that the Legislature would not502US2$28D 02-10-99 15:12:54 PAGES OPINPGT460 WYOMING v. OKLAHOMAOpinion of the Courthave enacted the valid provisions with the invalid provisionsremoved, if with the invalid provisions removed the rest ofthe act is fully operative as a law.' " Englebrecht v. Day,201 Okla. 585, 591, 208 P. 2d 538, 544 (1949) (quotingSterlingRefining Co. v. Walker, 165 Okla. 45, 25 P. 2d 312 (1933)). Itis also true that under Oklahoma law, a severability clausein a statute creates a presumption that the legislature wouldhave adopted the statute with the unconstitutional portionsomitted. 201 Okla., at 591, 208 P. 2d, at 544; seeChamplinRefining Co. v. Corporation Comm'n of Oklahoma, 286 U. S.210, 234-235 (1932) (inquiring into severability under Oklahoma law). The Act in this case contains a severabilityprovision:"The provisions of this act are severable and if anypart or provision shall be held void, the decision of thecourt so holding shall not affect or impair any of theremaining parts or provisions of this act." Act of Mar.26, 1986, Ch. 43, $ 3, 1986 Okla. Sess. Laws 74.But there are no parts or separate provisions in the invalid$ 939 of the Act. It applies to "[a]ll entities providing elec-tric power for sale to the consumer in Oklahoma" and commands them to purchase 10% Oklahoma-mined coal. Okla.Stat., Tit. 45, $ 939 (Supp. 1988). Nothing remains to besaved once that provision is stricken. Accordingly, the Actmust stand or fall as a whole.We decline Oklahoma's suggestion that the term "all entities" be read to uphold the Act only as to the GRDA, for itis clearly not this Court's province to rewrite a state statute.If "all entities" is to mean "the GRDA" or "state-owned utilities," the Oklahoma Legislature must be the one to decide.Indeed, this argument perceives the nature of the severability clause to be much different than that written by the Oklahoma Legislature. Severability clauses may easily be written to provide that if application of a statute to some classesis found unconstitutional, severance of those classes permits502US2$28D 02-10-99 15:12:54 PAGES OPINPGT461Cite as: 502 U. S. 437 (1992)Scalia, J., dissentingapplication to the acceptable classes.14 Moreover, the stat-ute could itself have been written to address explicitly theGRDA.15 The legislature here chose neither course.The State provides no additional insight into the intent ofits legislature on this question. The Act would become afundamentally different piece of legislation were it construedto apply only to the GRDA. We leave to the Oklahoma Leg-islature to decide whether it wishes to burden this stateowned utility when private utilities will otherwise be free ofthe Act's restrictions.VWe deny Oklahoma's motion for summary judgment andgrant that of Wyoming. In sum, we hold that the Act isunconstitutional under the Commerce Clause. No portion isseverable as to any entity touched by its mandate. A judgment and decree to that effect and enjoining enforcement ofthe Act will be entered. Jurisdiction over the case is retained in the event that further proceedings are required toimplement the judgment.
