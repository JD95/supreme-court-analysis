ALASKAOpinion of the Courtto gain control over the region's natural riches. See In reMcKenzie, 180 U. S. 536 (1901). The city of Nome sprang tolife almost overnight, with some 20,000 gold seekers arrivingby vessel in the summer of 1900 when the spring thawopened up seaward passage. Since that time, Nome hasnever been linked to interior Alaska by road--travelers andtraders must arrive by air, sea, or dog sled. This heavy reli-ance on seaward traffic, and the lack of a natural port in theregion, inspired Nome in the early 1980's to develop plans toconstruct port facilities, including a causeway with road, abreakwater, and an offshore terminal area, extending intoNorton Sound. The implications of this construction for thefederal-state offshore boundary lie at the heart of this law-suit, which comes to us on a bill of complaint filed by theUnited States. The question presented is whether the Sec-retary of the Army may decline to issue a permit to build anartificial addition to the coastline unless Alaska agrees thatthe construction will be deemed not to alter the location ofthe federal-state boundary. IOn August 25, 1982, the city of Nome applied for a federalpermit to build port facilities with the Alaska District Corpsof Engineers of the United States Department of the Armyunder $ 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act of1899 (RHA), 30 Stat. 1151, 33 U. S. C. $ 403, and $ 404 ofthe Clean Water Act, 86 Stat. 884, as amended, 33 U. S. C.$ 1344.1 The Corps issued a Public Notice of Application forPermit on October 20, 1982, and invited interested personsto comment on whether the permit should be granted. OnNovember 22, 1982, a division of the United States Department of the Interior filed an objection to the issuance of aDepartment of the Army permit on the ground that Nome'sconstruction of these port facilities would cause an "artificial1 This recitation of the facts is drawn from the Joint Stipulation of Factsfiled with the Court on September 6, 1991.503us2$61D 11-16-95 13:22:54 PAGES OPINPGT573Cite as: 503 U.

The Solicitor of the Interior Department issued an opinion to the same effect, statingthat the Nome project would " `move Alaska's coastline orbaseline seaward of its present location' " and that " `[f]ederalmineral leasing offshore Alaska would be affected becausethe state-federal boundary, as well as international bound-aries, are measured from the coastline or baseline.'

Accordingly, the Solicitor recom-mended that " `approval of the permit application be conditioned upon Alaska executing an agreement or a quit claimdeed preserving the coastline and the state-federal boundary.' " Id., at 3.On July 1, 1983, the Corps transmitted the Solicitor's letterto the Alaska Department of Natural Resources and advisedthe State that the federal permit would not be issued untila " `waiver or quit claim deed has been issued preservingthe coastline and the State-Federal boundary.' "Ibid. TheAlaska Department of Natural Resources responded on May9, 1984, by submitting a conditional disclaimer of rights toadditional submerged lands that could be claimed by theState as a result of the construction of the Nome port facility.This disclaimer provided that Alaska reserved its right tothe accreted submerged lands pending a decision by a courtof competent jurisdiction that the federal officials lackedthe authority to compel a disclaimer of sovereignty as a con-dition of permit issuance.2 After being advised by the De2 This disclaimer provides in pertinent part:"1.

Id., at 5. Alaska sub-mitted comments the following month, alleging that the proposed Norton Sound Lease Sale involved submerged landssubject to its Nome project disclaimer and announcing itsintention to file a suit challenging the Corps' authority toing disclaimer by the State of Alaska to the effect that the state does not,and will not, treat the Nome port development as extending its coast linefor purposes of the Submerged Lands Act, again subject to paragraph4 below."2. This disclaimer is executed solely for the purpose of complying withthe conditions recommended by the Solicitor of the Department of theInterior and the Attorney General and maintains the status quo of thebaseline and the state-federal boundary. It does not affect property orclaims to which Alaska is now entitled. It is not an admission by theState of Alaska or by the United States as to the present location of theshoreline, coast line, or the boundaries of the State of Alaska, and is without prejudice to any contention that any party may now or hereafter makeregarding such present location."3. This disclaimer is entered without prejudice to Alaska's right to filean appropriate action leading to a determination whether the Corps ofEngineers has the legal authority to require such a disclaimer before issuing a permit for a project which might affect the coast line."4.

Generally,when reviewing an agency's construction of a statute admin-istered by that agency, we first determine "whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue."Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council,Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842 (1984). Should the statute be silentor ambiguous on the direct question posed, we must thendecide whether the "agency's answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute." Id., at 843. In applyingthese principles, we examine in turn the language of $ 10 ofthe RHA, the decisions of this Court interpreting it, and thelongstanding construction of the Corps in fulfilling Congress' mandate.4 Although the bidding period closed without receipt of any bids, bothsides agree that a live controversy exists in light of their continuing disagreement as to the location of the federal-state boundary and the prospect of future lease sales in the area. We agree that the controversyis not moot, since it involves a continuing controversy about territorialsovereignty over these submerged lands. United States v. Alaska, 422U. S. 184, 186 (1975).503us2$61D 11-16-95 13:22:54 PAGES OPINPGT576 UNITED STATES v. ALASKAOpinion of the CourtASection 10 of the RHA provides in pertinent part:"The creation of any obstruction not affirmatively au-thorized by Congress, to the navigable capacity of anyof the waters of the United States is prohibited; and itshall not be lawful to build or commence the building ofany . . . structures in any . . . water of the United States. . . except on plans recommended by the Chief of Engineers and authorized by the Secretary of the Army; andit shall not be lawful to excavate or fill, or in any mannerto alter or modify the course, location, condition, or ca-pacity of, any port, roadstead, haven, harbor, canal, lake,harbor or refuge . . . unless the work has been recom-mended by the Chief of Engineers and authorized by theSecretary of the Army prior to beginning the same."33 U. S. C. $ 403.The language of this provision is quite broad. It flatlyprohibits the "creation ofany obstruction" to navigable ca-pacity that Congress itself has not authorized, and it bansconstruction of any structure in any water of the UnitedStates "except on plans recommended by the Chief of Engineers and authorized by the Secretary of the Army." Ibid.The statute itself contains no criteria by which the Secretaryis to make an authorization decision; on its face, the provisionappears to give the Secretary unlimited discretion to grantor deny a permit for construction of a structure such as theone at issue in this case. The Reports of the Senate andHouse Committees charged with making recommendationson the Act contain no hint of whether the drafters sought tovest in the Secretary the apparently unbridled authority theplain language of the statute seems to suggest. See H. R.Rep. No. 1826, 55th Cong., 3d Sess. (1899); S. Rep. No. 1686,55th Cong., 3d Sess. (1899).The statutory antecedents of this provision similarly offerlittle insight into Congress' intent.

Congress slightly amended the statute in 1892 to adda prohibition on any construction that would "in any manner. . . alter or modify the course, location, condition or capacityof any port, roadstead, haven, harbor, harbor of refuge, orinclosure . . . unless approved and authorized by the Secre-tary of War." 1892 Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act,Act of July 13, 1892, $ 3, 27 Stat. 110. This statute reflectedthe reality that Congress could not itself attend to each suchproject individually, as it had from the earliest days of theRepublic. As the House Report accompanying this law observed: "The most important feature of the bill now pre-sented is the extent it goes in authorizing the Secretary ofWar to make contracts for the completion of some of themore important works of river and harbor improvement."H. R. Rep. No. 967, 52d Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1892). "The de-parture from the old driblet system of appropriations," theHouse Report continued, "was found to work so well thatyour committee determined to apply it on a larger scale thanin the last act." Ibid. See also S. Rep. No. 666, 52d Cong.,1st Sess., 4-5 (1892). By the time Congress passed the 1899Act, therefore, the idea of delegating authority to the Secre-tary was well established even if the explanations for thebroad language employed by Congress to carry out such adirective were sparse.BThe substance of the RHA has been unchanged since itsenactment, and the Court has had only a few occasions todecide whether to construe it broadly or narrowly. In one503us2$61D 11-16-95 13:22:54 PAGES OPINPGT578 UNITED STATES v. ALASKAOpinion of the Courtsuch case, for example, the Court considered whether toissue a writ of mandamus to order the Secretary of War andthe Chief of Engineers to grant a permit to build a wharf innavigable waters. United States ex rel. Greathouse v. Dern,289 U. S. 352 (1933). Although it was stipulated that theproject would not interfere with navigability, the Secretarynevertheless denied the permit on the ground that the wharfwould impede plans developed by the United States to createa means of access to the proposed George Washington Memorial Parkway along the Potomac River in northern Virginia.Id., at 355. The permit applicant argued that the Secretary's refusal to grant it was contrary to law on the theorythat RHA $ 10 authorized consideration only of the proposedconstruction's effects on navigation. In refusing to issue thewrit of mandamus under equitable principles, the Courtnoted that petitioners' argument could be accepted "only ifseveral doubtful questions are resolved in [petitioners']favor," one of which was "whether a mandatory duty is imposed upon the Secretary of War by $ 10 of the Rivers andHarbors Appropriation Act to authorize the construction ofthe proposed wharf if he is satisfied that it will not interferewith navigation." Id., at 357.Nor has such a broad interpretation of the RHA been exceptional. In United States v. Republic Steel Corp., 362U. S. 482, 491 (1960), the Court observed: "We read the 1899Act charitably in light of the purpose to be served. Thephilosophy of the statement of Mr. Justice Holmes in NewJersey v. New York, 283 U. S. 336, 342 [1931], that `A river ismore than an amenity, it is a treasure,' forbids a narrow,cramped reading of either $ 13 or of $ 10." And as we statedin a later case: "Despite some difficulties with the wordingof the Act, we have consistently found its coverage to bebroad. And we have found that a principal beneficiary ofthe Act, if not the principal beneficiary, is the Government503us2$61D 11-16-95 13:22:54 PAGES OPINPGT579Cite as: 503 U. S. 569 (1992)Opinion of the Courtitself." Wyandotte Transportation Co. v. United States, 389U. S. 191, 201 (1967) (citations omitted).In United States v. Pennsylvania Industrial ChemicalCorp., 411 U. S. 655 (1973), we applied this broad approachto the RHA in a somewhat analogous situation under a provision enacted contemporaneously with $ 10. RHA $ 13 provides that the Secretary of the Army "may permit the deposit" of refuse matter "whenever in the judgment of theChief of Engineers anchorage and navigation will not be injured thereby." 33 U. S. C. $ 407. The case presented thequestion whether the statute required the Secretary to allowsuch discharges where they had no effect on navigation. Weheld that the statute should not be so construed. In reaching this conclusion, we observed that "even in a situationwhere the Chief of Engineers concedes that a certain depositwill not injure anchorage and navigation, the Secretary neednot necessarily permit the deposit, for the proviso makes theSecretary's authority discretionary--i. e., it provides that theSecretary `may permit' the deposit." 411 U. S., at 662. Wefurther noted that $ 13 "contains no criteria to be followedby the Secretary in issuing such permits," id., at 668, andrejected the argument that the agency's statutory authorityshould be construed narrowly.In our view, $ 10 should be construed with similar breadth.Without specifying the factors to be considered, $ 10 providesthat "it shall not be lawful to build or commence the building" of any structure in navigable waters of the UnitedStates "except on plans recommended by the Chief of Engineers and authorized by the Secretary of the Army." 33U. S. C. $ 403 (emphasis added). In light of our holding inPennsylvania Chemical Corp. that the Secretary's discretion under $ 13 was not limited to considering the effect ofa refuse deposit on navigation, it logically follows that theSecretary's authority is not confined solely to considerations503us2$61D 11-16-95 13:22:54 PAGES OPINPGT580 UNITED STATES v. ALASKAOpinion of the Courtof navigation in deciding whether to issue a permit under$ 10.5CWe now examine the administrative interpretation of $ 10down through the years with respect to the range of discretion extended to the Corps and the Secretary. An opinionby Attorney General George W. Wickersham in 1909, forexample, denied the Secretary of War and the Chief of En-gineers the authority to decide whether to issue a permitunder RHA $ 10 after "consider[ation of] questions relatingto other interests than those having to do with the navigation of the waters." 27 Op. Atty. Gen. 284, 288.This narrow view of the Secretary's authority persistedwithin the agency for many decades. "Until 1968," accord-ing to one document produced by the Corps of Engineers,"the Corps administered the 1899 Act regulatory programonly to protect navigation and the navigable capacity of thenation's waters." 42 Fed. Reg. 37122 (1977). In 1968, theregulations were amended so that the general policy guidance for permit issuance included consideration of "the ef-fects of permitted activities on the public interest including5 Alaska reads Pennsylvania Chemical Corp. differently, suggestingthat the case does not relate to the scope of the Corps' permitting authority under RHA $ 10, but instead is confined to the issue of how broadly theagency's prosecutorial discretion should be defined. We disagree. Ouranalysis of the RHA in that case was not at all contingent on the underlying issue relating to a prosecution rather than a permitting decision. Weplaced great weight on the reading by the federal courts, which "almostuniversally agreed, as did the courts below, that $ 13 is to be read in accordance with its plain language as imposing a flat ban on the unauthorizeddeposit of foreign substances into navigable waters, regardless of the effect on navigation." 411 U. S., at 671. Alaska also cites Wisconsin v.Illinois, 278 U. S. 367, 418 (1929), for the proposition that $ 10 only authorizes considerations of navigability in permit issuance decisions. We donot read the case in the same way. In our view, Wisconsin v. Illinois ismore properly read to limit the Secretary's authority to issue a permit fornonnavigability reasons when an effect of the project would be to obstructnavigation.

See H. R. Rep. No. 91-917, p. 6(1970). The Committee was of the view that the Corps' earlier "restricted view of the 1899 act . . . was not required bythe law."Id., at 2. The Report summarized our holdingsto the effect that the statutory language of RHA $ 10 shouldbe interpreted generously, id., at 2-4, and commended theCorps "for recognizing [in 1968] its broader responsibilities"pursuant to its permitting authority under the RHA, id., at5. The Committee emphasized that the Corps "should instruct its district engineers . . . to increase their emphasison how the work will affectall aspects of the public interest,including not only navigation but also conservation of naturalresources, fish and wildlife, air and water quality, esthetics,scenic view, historic sites, ecology, and other public interestaspects of the waterway." Id., at 6 (emphasis added). TheCorps did not react to this "advice" until after the Fifth Circuit's decision in Zabel v. Tabb, 430 F. 2d 199 (1970). Therethe court upheld the Corps' consideration of environmentalfactors in its permitting decision even though the projectwould not interfere with navigation, flood control, or powerproduction. After this decision, the Corps began the longprocess of changing its regulations governing permit application evaluations. See 42 Fed. Reg. 37122 (1977) (describinghistorical background of the agency's practice). In 1976, theCorps issued regulations interpreting its statutory authority6 The prior version of this regulation stated that "[t]he decision as towhether a permit will be issued must rest primarily upon the effect of theproposed work on navigation." 33 CFR $ 209.330(a) (1967).503us2$61D 11-16-95 13:22:54 PAGES OPINPGT582 UNITED STATES v. ALASKAOpinion of the Courtas empowering it to take into account a full range ofeconomic, social, and environmental factors. See 33 CFR$ 209.120(f )(1).The regulations at issue in this lawsuit, therefore, reflecta broad interpretation of agency power under $ 10 that wasconsistent with the language used by Congress and was wellsettled by this Court and the Army Corps of Engineers.With respect to the breadth of the Corps' public interest review, these regulations are substantially the same as thoseadopted in 1976 and provide:"(a) Publ ic Interest Rev i ew. (1) The decisionwhether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluationof the probable impacts, including cumulative impacts, ofthe proposed activity and its intended use on the publicinterest. Evaluation of the probable impact which theproposed activity may have on the public interestrequires a careful weighing of all those factors whichbecome relevant in each particular case. The benefitswhich reasonably may be expected to accrue from theproposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. The decision whether to authorizea proposal, and if so, the conditions under which it willbe allowed to occur, are therefore determined by theoutcome of this general balancing process. That decision should reflect the national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. All factorswhich may be relevant to the proposal must be considered including the cumulative effects thereof: amongthose are conservation, economics, aesthetics, generalenvironmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties,fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values,land use, navigation, shore erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality,energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in503us2$61D 11-16-95 13:22:54 PAGES OPINPGT583Cite as: 503 U. S. 569 (1992)Opinion of the Courtgeneral, the needs and welfare of the people." 33 CFR$ 320.4(a)(1) (1991).These regulations guide the Secretary's consideration of"public interest" factors to evaluate in determining whetherto issue a permit under $ 10 of the RHA. To the extentAlaska contends that these regulations are invalid becausethey authorize the Secretary to consider a wider range offactors than just the effects of a project on navigability, wereject this position. The State's reading of the Secretary'sregulatory authority in this respect is inconsistent with thestatute's language, our cases interpreting it, and the agency'spractice since the late 1960's.IIIAlaska appears to concede some ground by acknowledgingthat the Secretary may not be limited solely to issues of navigability in considering whether to issue a $ 10 permit.7 TheState in effect contends that, even if the statute authorizesconsideration of factors other than just navigability, theregulations authorizing consideration of a project's consequences on the federal-state boundary exceed the Secre-tary's statutory mandate. The regulation at issue providesin pertinent part as follows:7 Alaska acknowledges, for example, that the Secretary can take intoaccount the polluting consequences of a project, see Brief for Alaska 17,though the language of $ 10 includes no mention of such effects. And abrief filed by numerous States and the Coastal States Organization asamici curiae appears to go even further by suggesting that "the ArmyCorps may deny a permit for the construction of a harbor facility if it isdetermined that the construction or facility would result in an obstructionto navigation, endanger human health or welfare, the marine environment, or the economic potential." Brief for Alabama et al. as AmiciCuriae 17 (emphasis added). Plainly these factors are not mentioned inRHA $ 10. As our analysis will make clear, the United States is fundamentally correct that there is no legal basis for authorizing the Secretaryto consider these factors but not the effects of a project on the federalstate boundary.503us2$61D 11-16-95 13:22:54 PAGES OPINPGT584 UNITED STATES v.

Applications for structures orwork affecting coastal waters will therefore be reviewedspecifically to determine whether the coast line or baseline might be altered.

The decisionon the application will be made by the Secretary of theArmy after coordination with the Attorney General."33 CFR $ 320.4 (1991).Alaska advances several arguments why such concerns ex-ceed the scope of the Secretary's authority. We addresseach in turn.AAlaska's first argument proceeds from the premise that theSLA trumps the RHA for purposes of determining whetherthe Secretary may condition issuance of a permit on theState's disclaimer of sovereignty over the accreted sub-merged lands. The SLA establishes that a coastal State'sboundary extends seaward "to a line three geographicalmiles distant from its coast line." 43 U. S. C. $ 1312. Theseaward boundary of state-owned lands is measured from abase line that is subject to change from natural and artificialalterations. See United States v. California, 381 U. S. 139,176-177 (1965); United States v. Louisiana (LouisianaBoundary Case), 394 U. S. 11, 40, n. 48 (1969). In applyingthese rules, Alaska asserts that because the SLA extends aState's boundary seaward three miles from its coastline and503us2$61D 11-16-95 13:22:54 PAGES OPINPGT585Cite as: 503 U. S. 569 (1992)Opinion of the Courtbecause our decisions have authorized artificial additions toaffect determinations of the base line, the Army cannot byagency fiat override the will of Congress, as interpreted byour Court. Cf.Louisiana Pub. Serv. Comm'n v. FCC, 476U. S. 355, 376 (1986). According to Alaska, federalism interests should preclude our finding that the RHA confers poweron the Secretary to condition issuance of a $ 10 construction permit on the disclaimer of a change in the preprojectfederal-state boundary. SeeOrganized Village of Kake v.Egan, 369 U. S. 60 (1962).The United States responds that Congress has alreadygiven the requisite authority to the agency through enactment of the RHA, and that the Secretary appropriately complied with that statute. In the Federal Government's view,the RHA sets out an absolute prohibition on construction of"any obstruction" in navigable waters, 33 U. S. C. $ 403, andvests discretion in the Secretary of the Army to grant exceptions on a case-by-case basis when a structure is recommended by the Army Corps of Engineers. The UnitedStates maintains that the Secretary has the discretion toidentify relevant considerations for issuing or denying a permit. Cf. Jay v. Boyd, 351 U. S. 345, 353-354 (1956).We find the United States' argument to be the more persuasive one. Contrary to Alaska's position, the agency hereis not usurping authority. The Secretary is making no effort to alter the existing rights of a State to sovereignty oversubmerged lands within three miles of the coastline. TheSLA makes this guarantee and nothing in the Corps' practice, as exercised in this case, alters this right. What theCorps is doing, and what we find a reasonable exercise ofagency authority, is to determine whether an artificial addition to the coastline will increase the State's control oversubmerged lands to the detriment of the United States' legitimate interests. If the Secretary so finds, nothing in theSLA prohibits this fact from consideration as part of the"public interest" review process under RHA $ 10. Were we503us2$61D 11-16-95 13:22:54 PAGES OPINPGT586 UNITED STATES v. ALASKAOpinion of the Courtto accept Alaska's position, the Federal Government's interests in submerged lands outside the State's zone of controlwould conceivably become hostage to a State's plans to addartificial additions to its coastline. And if Alaska's readingof the applicable law were followed to its logical extreme,the United States would be powerless to protect its interestsin submerged lands if a State were to build an artificial addition to the coastline for the sole purpose of gaining sovereignty over submerged lands within the United States' zone,so long as the project did not affect navigability or causepollution. Alaska points us to nothing in the SLA or to itslegislative history that mandates such a result.8It is important to note that neither the SLA itself, norany of its legislative history, addresses the question of howartificial additions to the coastline affect the 3-mile limit, aswe observed in United States v. California, 381 U. S. 139,176, and n. 50 (1965). In that case, however, we did holdthat international law recognized the seaward expansion ofsovereignty through artificial additions to the coastline. Id.,at 177. But we also stated that "the Special Master recognized that the United States, through its control over navigable waters, had power to protect its interests from encroachment by unwarranted artificial structures, and that the effectof any future changes could thus be the subject of agreementbetween the parties." Id., at 176. Alaska suggests thatthis language should not be read to vest power in the Secretary to condition permits on sovereignty disclaimers becausethe Special Master's report cited by the Court was written8 Indeed, the SLA also excepts from its operation "any rights the UnitedStates has in lands presently and actually occupied by the United Statesunder claim of right." 43 U.

This contention fails to persuadeus, however, because we have already noted that the SLAdid not specifically address artificial changes to the coastline,and because our opinion in California sanctioned the mecha-nism exercised by the Secretary in this case: "Argumentsbased on the inequity to the United States of allowing Cali-fornia to effect changes in the boundary between federal andstate submerged lands by making future artificial changes inthe coastline are met, as the Special Master pointed out, bythe ability of the United States to protect itself through itspower over navigable waters." 381 U. S., at 177. Such"power over navigable waters" would be meaningless indeedif we were to accept Alaska's view that RHA $ 10 permittedthe United States to exercise it only when the State's projectaffected navigability or caused pollution.9BAlaska next contends that our decisions do not permit theSecretary to consider changes in federal-state boundaries aspart of the $ 10 "public interest" review process. First, theState suggests that such consideration would conflict withour decision in California, supra, at 176-177. In that casewe adopted the Convention on the Territorial Sea and the9 Alaska's argument is also weakened by the existence of the OCSLA,43 U. S.

The "public interest" reviewundertaken by the Secretary in determining whether to issue a $ 10 permitexplicitly considers "the effects of the proposed work on the outer continental rights of the United States." 33 CFR $ 320.4(f) (1991). Such aconsideration in some form has been part of the equation of factors subjectto the Secretary's review process since 1969. See 33 CFR $ 209.120(d)(4)(1969). It is perfectly consistent with the OCSLA for the Secretary toconsider a project's effects on United States' rights to submerged lands indeciding whether to issue a $ 10 permit.503us2$61D 11-16-95 13:22:54 PAGES OPINPGT588 UNITED STATES v. ALASKAOpinion of the CourtContiguous Zone, Apr. 29, 1958, 15 U. S. T. 1607, T. I. A. S.No. 5639, for purposes of the SLA, explaining that such aresult would establish "a single coastline for both the administration of the Submerged Lands Act and the conduct of ourfuture international relations (barring an unexpected changein the rules established by the Convention)." 381 U. S., at165. Because construction of an artificial port facility will,in certain circumstances, cause a change in the UnitedStates' international seaward boundary,10 Alaska contendsthat the goal of a "single" coastline will be frustrated if wepermit the Secretary to establish, in effect, one boundaryfor international purposes and a different one for domesticpurposes.As the United States maintains, however, our decision inCalifornia did not specify a "goal" of achieving a "single"coastline. Rather, our purpose was to give the SLA a"definiteness and stability." Such aims, of course, can beachieved without creating perfect symmetry between theConvention and the Act. Stability in a boundary line isachieved when the Secretary decides whether a State mustdisclaim its rights to accreted submerged lands caused byartificial additions just as surely as it is with ordinary coastline determinations occasioned by natural changes. TheState intimates that problems relating to fishing, salvage operations, and criminal jurisdiction will result from "[u]nstable and unpredictable administrative rules [that] will createconfusion in many areas."

S. 569 (1992)Opinion of the Courtboundary itself is indefinite.11 But uncertainty in cases suchas this one surely ends when the State disclaims its sovereignty over accreted submerged lands. The 3-mile bound-ary remains the same. And in those circumstances in whichthe Secretary does not require a disclaimer and the 3-milefederal-state boundary extends from the new base line, presumably should there arise any of the federal-state problemsAlaska identifies, changes in nautical maps could readily beamended to reflect such changes. Nothing in the parties'lodgings with the Court suggests why fishermen and othersailors who rely on such charts will suffer prejudice by therule we announce today.1211 We add that variations between international and federal-state boundaries are not uncommon. As we recognized in United States v. California, 381 U. S. 139, 165-166 (1965), changes in Convention rules might render the international and federal-state boundaries noncoincident. In theSLA itself, Congress recognized the possibility that variations betweeninternational and federal-state boundaries might occur by providing thata decree fixed by our Court "shall not be ambulatory" even though erosionor accretion may alter the international boundary. 43 U. S. C. $ 1301(b).We also note that the President's proclamation of a 12-mile territorial seafor international law purposes functionally established a distinction between the international and the federal-state boundaries. See ArgentineRepublic v. Amerada Hess Shipping Corp., 488 U. S. 428, 441, n. 8 (1989).Finally, as the United States accurately points out, some coastal Stateshave created or permitted variations between the international boundaryand the federal-state boundaries through compromise agreements reachedwith the United States. See Mississippi v. United States, 498 U. S. 16(1990).12 Alaska also suggests that the regulations at issue in this case conflictwith our decision in Nollan v. California Coastal Comm'n, 483 U. S. 825(1987), which held that a coastal commission could not condition the granting of a construction permit on the conferring of a public access easementacross a landowner's beach. Alaska quotes language in Nollan to the effect that "unless the permit condition serves the same governmental purpose as the development ban, the building restriction is not a valid regulation of land use but an `out-and-out plan of extortion.' " Id., at 837. Thisrule, however, has no applicability in a situation such as this one, in whichwe evaluate the statutory authority underlying an agency's action. Id.,at 836. Even were the Nollan situation analogous to that presented here,503us2$61D 11-16-95 13:22:54 PAGES OPINPGT590 UNITED STATES v. ALASKAOpinion of the CourtAccordingly, we find no merit in Alaska's argument that,in conducting the permit review process under RHA $ 10,the Secretary cannot consider a project's effects on thefederal-state boundary.IVFinally, Alaska maintains that even if the regulations areauthorized by the RHA, the Secretary's actions were notconsistent with those regulations. The State argues thatnothing in the applicable regulations authorizes the ArmyCorps of Engineers to force a coastal State to abdicate rightsto submerged lands as a condition to issuance of a permitfor construction of a shoreline project. Alaska suggests that"the regulation addresses activities on submerged lands, notthe property interests in the submerged lands." Brief forAlaska 28. Nor can the Secretary derive authority to condition disclaimers on interagency coordination responsibilities,according to the State, because 33 CFR $ 320.4(g)(6) (1991)states specifically that "dispute[s] over property ownershipwill not be a factor in the Corps' public interest decision."Alaska further posits that the regulations at $ 320.4(a)(1),which include numerous factors to be evaluated in balancingthe public interest, do not make reference to the UnitedStates' property interests.As our analysis in Parts III-A and III-B suggests, we donot find this argument persuasive. The regulations indicatethat the Corps may include in its evaluation the "effects ofthe proposed work on the outer continental rights of theUnited States." 33 CFR $ 320.4(f) (1991). It is untenableto maintain that the legitimate property interests of theUnited States fall outside the relevant criteria for a decisionthat requires the Secretary to determine whether issuanceof a permit would affect the "public interest." The regulawe note that Alaska would gain no benefit because the purpose behindimposing a condition for issuance of the permit--to protect federal rightsto submerged lands--is the same as that for denying the permit.503us2$61D 11-16-95 13:22:54 PAGES OPINPGT591Cite as: 503 U. S. 569 (1992)Opinion of the Courttions at $ 320.4(g)(6), upon which Alaska places some weight,clearly do not speak to property disputes of the type at issuehere. Moreover, we are unpersuaded by Alaska's contentionthat the authority to require disclaimers cannot be inferredfrom the regulatory scheme. It would make little sense, andbe inconsistent with Congress' intent, to hold that the Corpslegitimately may prohibit construction of a port facility, andyet to deny it the authority to seek the less drastic alternative of conditioning issuance of a permit on the State's disclaimer of rights to accreted submerged lands.Alaska also makes various challenges to the administrativeprocedures followed in this case, and especially to the allegedshortcoming of the Secretary in not formalizing the authority to condition disclaimers of sovereignty in the permitissuance process.13 The "policy" followed in this case,however, is not contrary to law simply because of its specific omission from the regulations. See United States v.Gaubert, 499 U. S. 315, 324 (1991) (observing that someagencies "establish policy on a case-by-case basis, whetherthrough adjudicatory proceedings or through administrationof agency programs"). Certainly the Corps communicatedits intention openly to the appropriate state officials, andtherefore did not force Alaska " `to litigate with agencies onthe basis of secret laws.'

The United Statesavers that such disclaimers have been requested on a case13 The State also contests the legality of the Secretary's actions in thiscase under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U. S. C. $ 706, especiallythe regulations at 33 CFR $ 320.4(f) (1991) that authorize the Secretaryto take into account changes in the base line in making $ 10 permit issuance decisions. Contrary to Alaska's contention, these regulations wereadopted through notice and comment proceedings, see 39 Fed. Reg. 12115(1974); 38 Fed. Reg. 12217 (1973), as were subsequent amendments, see 51Fed. Reg. 41220 (1986); 42 Fed. Reg. 37122 (1977).503us2$61D 11-16-95 13:22:54 PAGES OPINPGT592 UNITED STATES v.
