The issue in this case is whether Hawaii's prohibition onwrite-in voting unreasonably infringes upon its citizens'rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Peti-tioner contends that the Constitution requires Hawaii to provide for the casting, tabulation, and publication of write-invotes. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit disagreed, holding that the prohibition, taken as part of theState's comprehensive election scheme, does not impermissibly burden the right to vote. 937 F. 2d 415, 422 (1991).We affirm.IPetitioner is a registered voter in the city and county ofHonolulu. In 1986, only one candidate filed nominatingpapers to run for the seat representing petitioner's districtin the Hawaii House of Representatives.

The DistrictCourt denied a stay pending appeal. 1 App. 76-107.The Court of Appeals entered the stay, id., at 109, andvacated the judgment of the District Court, reasoning thatconsideration of the federal constitutional question raised bypetitioner was premature because "neither the plain language of Hawaii statutes nor any definitive judicial inter-pretation of those statutes establishes that the Hawaii legislature has enacted a ban on write-in voting," Burdick v.Takushi, 846 F. 2d 587, 588 (CA9 1988). Accordingly, theCourt of Appeals ordered the District Court to abstain, seeRailroad Comm'n of Texas v. Pullman Co., 312 U. S. 496(1941), until state courts had determined whether Hawaii'selection laws permitted write-in voting.1On remand, the District Court certified the following threequestions to the Supreme Court of Hawaii:"(1) Does the Constitution of the State of Hawaii re-quire Hawaii's election officials to permit the casting ofwrite-in votes and require Hawaii's election officials tocount and publish write-in votes?"(2) Do Hawaii's election laws require Hawaii's elec-tion officials to permit the casting of write-in votes andrequire Hawaii's election officials to count and publishwrite-in votes?"(3) Do Hawaii's election laws permit, but not require,Hawaii's election officials to allow voters to cast writein votes and to count and publish write-in votes?" App.to Pet. for Cert. 56a-57a.1 While petitioner's appeal was pending, he became concerned that theCourt of Appeals might not enter its decision before the September 1988primary election. Accordingly, petitioner filed a second suit challengingthe unavailability of write-in voting in the 1988 election. Burdick v. Cayetano, Civ. No. 99-0365. Coincidentally, petitioner's new suit was filed onthe very day that the Ninth Circuit decided the appeal stemming frompetitioner's original complaint. The two actions subsequently were consolidated by the District Court. 1 App. 142.504us2$81D 04-08-96 07:08:40 PAGES OPINPGT432 BURDICK v. TAKUSHIOpinion of the CourtHawaii's high court answered "No" to all three questions,holding that Hawaii's election laws barred write-in votingand that these measures were consistent with the State'sConstitution.Burdick v. Takushi, 70 Haw. 498, 776 P. 2d824 (1989). The United States District Court then grantedpetitioner's renewed motion for summary judgment and in-junctive relief, but entered a stay pending appeal. 737F. Supp. 582 (Haw. 1990).The Court of Appeals again reversed, holding that Hawaiiwas not required to provide for write-in votes:"Although the prohibition on write-in voting places somerestrictions on [petitioner's] rights of expression and association, that burden is justified in light of the ease ofaccess to Hawaii's ballots, the alternatives available to[petitioner] for expressing his political beliefs, theState's broad powers to regulate elections, and thespecific interests advanced by the State." 937 F. 2d,at 421.2In so ruling, the Ninth Circuit expressly declined to followan earlier decision regarding write-in voting by the Court ofAppeals for the Fourth Circuit. See ibid., citing Dixon v.Maryland State Administrative Bd. of Election Laws, 878F. 2d 776 (CA4 1989). We granted certiorari to resolve thedisagreement on this important question. 502 U.

Our cases do not so hold.2 The Ninth Circuit panel issued its opinion on March 1, 1991. See Burdick v. Takushi, 927 F. 2d 469. On June 28, 1991, the Court of Appealsdenied petitioner's petition for rehearing and suggestion for rehearing enbanc, and the panel withdrew its original opinion and issued the versionthat appears at 937 F. 2d 415.504us2$81D 04-08-96 07:08:40 PAGES OPINPGT433Cite as: 504 U.

Socialist Workers Party, 440 U. S. 173,184 (1979). It does not follow, however, that the right tovote in any manner and the right to associate for politicalpurposes through the ballot are absolute. Munro v. Socialist Workers Party, 479 U. S. 189, 193 (1986). The Constitution provides that States may prescribe "[t]he Times, Placesand Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives," Art. I, $ 4, cl. 1, and the Court therefore hasrecognized that States retain the power to regulate theirown elections. Sugarman v. Dougall, 413 U. S. 634, 647(1973); Tashjian v. Republican Party of Connecticut, 479U. S. 208, 217 (1986). Common sense, as well as constitutional law, compels the conclusion that government must playan active role in structuring elections; "as a practical matter,there must be a substantial regulation of elections if theyare to be fair and honest and if some sort of order, ratherthan chaos, is to accompany the democratic processes."Storer v. Brown, 415 U. S. 724, 730 (1974).Election laws will invariably impose some burden upon individual voters. Each provision of a code, "whether it governs the registration and qualifications of voters, the selection and eligibility of candidates, or the voting process itself,inevitably affects--at least to some degree--the individual'sright to vote and his right to associate with others for political ends." Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U. S. 780, 788 (1983).Consequently, to subject every voting regulation to strictscrutiny and to require that the regulation be narrowly tailored to advance a compelling state interest, as petitionersuggests, would tie the hands of States seeking to assurethat elections are operated equitably and efficiently. SeeBrief for Petitioner 32-37. Accordingly, the mere fact thata State's system "creates barriers . . . tending to limit thefield of candidates from which voters might choose . . . doesnot of itself compel close scrutiny." Bullock v. Carter, 405504us2$81D 04-08-96 07:08:40 PAGES OPINPGT434 BURDICK v. TAKUSHIOpinion of the CourtU. S. 134, 143 (1972); Anderson, supra, at 788; McDonald v.Board of Election Comm'rs of Chicago, 394 U. S. 802 (1969).Instead, as the full Court agreed in Anderson, 460 U. S., at788-789; id., at 808, 817 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting), a moreflexible standard applies. A court considering a challengeto a state election law must weigh "the character and magni-tude of the asserted injury to the rights protected by theFirst and Fourteenth Amendments that the plaintiff seeksto vindicate" against "the precise interests put forward bythe State as justifications for the burden imposed by itsrule," taking into consideration "the extent to which thoseinterests make it necessary to burden the plaintiff 's rights."Id., at 789; Tashjian, supra, at 213-214.Under this standard, the rigorousness of our inquiry intothe propriety of a state election law depends upon the extentto which a challenged regulation burdens First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. Thus, as we have recognizedwhen those rights are subjected to "severe" restrictions, theregulation must be "narrowly drawn to advance a state in-terest of compelling importance."Norman v. Reed, 502U. S. 279, 289 (1992). But when a state election law provision imposes only "reasonable, nondiscriminatory restric-tions" upon the First and Fourteenth Amendment rights ofvoters, "the State's important regulatory interests are gen-erally sufficient to justify" the restrictions. Anderson, 460U. S., at 788; see also id., at 788-789, n. 9. We apply thisstandard in considering petitioner's challenge to Hawaii'sban on write-in ballots. AThere is no doubt that the Hawaii election laws, like allelection regulations, have an impact on the right to vote,id.,at 788, but it can hardly be said that the laws at issue hereunconstitutionally limit access to the ballot by party or inde-pendent candidates or unreasonably interfere with the rightof voters to associate and have candidates of their choiceplaced on the ballot. Indeed, petitioner understandably does504us2$81D 04-08-96 07:08:40 PAGES OPINPGT435Cite as: 504 U. S. 428 (1992)Opinion of the Courtnot challenge the manner in which the State regulates candidate access to the ballot.To obtain a position on the November general election ballot, a candidate must participate in Hawaii's open primary,"in which all registered voters may choose in which partyprimary to vote." Tashjian, supra, at 223, n. 11. See Haw.Rev. Stat. $ 12-31 (1985). The State provides three mechanisms through which a voter's candidate-of-choice may appear on the primary ballot.First, a party petition may be filed 150 days before theprimary by any group of persons who obtain the signaturesof one percent of the State's registered voters.3 Haw. Rev.Stat. $ 11-62 (Supp. 1991). Then, 60 days before the primary, candidates must file nominating papers certifying,among other things, that they will qualify for the officesought and that they are members of the party that theyseek to represent in the general election. The nominatingpapers must contain the signatures of a specified number ofregistered voters: 25 for candidates for statewide or federaloffice; 15 for state legislative and county races. Haw. Rev.Stat. $$ 12-2.5 to 12-7 (1985 and Supp. 1991). The winnerin each party advances to the general election. Thus, if aparty forms around the candidacy of a single individual andno one else runs on that party ticket, the individual will beelected at the primary and win a place on the Novembergeneral election ballot.The second method through which candidates may appearon the Hawaii primary ballot is the established party route.43 We have previously upheld party and candidate petition signature requirements that were as burdensome or more burdensome than Hawaii'sone-percent requirement. See, e. g., Norman v. Reed, 502 U. S. 279, 295(1992); American Party of Texas v. White, 415 U. S. 767 (1974); Jenness v.Fortson, 403 U. S. 431 (1971).4 In Jenness, we rejected an equal protection challenge to a system thatprovided alternative means of ballot access for members of establishedpolitical parties and other candidates, concluding that the system was con504us2$81D 04-08-96 07:08:40 PAGES OPINPGT436 BURDICK v. TAKUSHIOpinion of the CourtEstablished parties that have qualified by petition for threeconsecutive elections and received a specified percentage ofthe vote in the preceding election may avoid filing party peti-tions for 10 years. Haw. Rev. Stat. $ 11-61 (1985). TheDemocratic, Republican, and Libertarian Parties currentlymeet Hawaii's criteria for established parties. Like newparty candidates, established party contenders are requiredto file nominating papers 60 days before the primary. Haw.Rev. Stat. $$ 12-2.5 to 12-7 (1985 and Supp. 1991).5The third mechanism by which a candidate may appearon the ballot is through the designated nonpartisan ballot.Nonpartisans may be placed on the nonpartisan primary ballot simply by filing nominating papers containing 15 to 25signatures, depending upon the office sought, 60 days beforethe primary. $$ 12-3 to 12-7. To advance to the generalelection, a nonpartisan must receive 10 percent of the primary vote or the number of votes that was sufficient to nomi-nate a partisan candidate, whichever number is lower. Hustace v. Doi, 60 Haw. 282, 289-290, 588 P. 2d 915, 920 (1978).During the 10 years preceding the filing of this action, 8 of26 nonpartisans who entered the primary obtained slots onthe November ballot. Brief for Respondents 8.Although Hawaii makes no provision for write-in voting inits primary or general elections, the system outlined aboveprovides for easy access to the ballot until the cutoff datefor the filing of nominating petitions, two months before theprimary. Consequently, any burden on voters' freedom ofchoice and association is borne only by those who fail to idenstitutional because it did not operate to freeze the political status quo.403 U. S., at 438.5 In Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U. S. 780 (1983), the Court concludedthat Ohio's early filing deadline for Presidential candidates imposed anunconstitutional burden on voters' freedom of choice and freedom of association. But Anderson is distinguishable because the Ohio election scheme,as explained by the Court, provided no means for a candidate to appearon the ballot after a March cutoff date. Id., at 786. Hawaii fills this voidthrough its nonpartisan primary ballot mechanism.504us2$81D 04-08-96 07:08:40 PAGES OPINPGT437Cite as: 504 U.

Brown, we gave little weight to "the interestthe candidate and his supporters may have in making a laterather than an early decision to seek independent ballot status." 415 U. S., at 736.6 Cf. Rosario v. Rockefeller, 410U. S. 752, 757 (1973). We think the same reasoning applieshere and therefore conclude that any burden imposed byHawaii's write-in vote prohibition is a very limited one. "Toconclude otherwise might sacrifice the political stability ofthe system of the State, with profound consequences for theentire citizenry, merely in the interest of particular candi-dates and their supporters having instantaneous access tothe ballot." Storer, supra, at 736.7Because he has characterized this as a voting rights ratherthan ballot access case, petitioner submits that the write-inprohibition deprives him of the opportunity to cast a meaningful ballot, conditions his electoral participation upon the6 In Storer, we upheld a California ballot access law that refused to recognize independent candidates until a year after they had disaffiliatedfrom a political party.7 The dissent complains that, because primary voters are required to optfor a specific partisan or nonpartisan ballot, they are foreclosed from voting in those races in which no candidate appears on their chosen ballotand in those races in which they are dissatisfied with the available choices.Post, at 444. But this is generally true of primaries; voters are requiredto select a ticket, rather than choose from the universe of candidates running on all party slates. Indeed, the Court has upheld the much moreonerous requirement that voters interested in participating in a primaryelection enroll as a member of a political party prior to the precedinggeneral election. Rosario v. Rockefeller, 410 U. S. 752 (1973). Cf. American Party of Texas, supra, at 786 ("[T]he State may determine that it isessential to the integrity of the nominating [petition] process to confinevoters to supporting one party and its candidates in the course of the samenominating process").If the dissent were correct in suggesting that requiring primary votersto select a specific ballot impermissibly burdened the right to vote, it isclear under our decisions that the availability of a write-in option wouldnot provide an adequate remedy.

Brief for Petitioner 19.At bottom, he claims that he is entitled to cast and Hawaiirequired to count a "protest vote" for Donald Duck, Tr. ofOral Arg. 5, and that any impediment to this asserted "right"is unconstitutional.Petitioner's argument is based on two flawed premises.First, inBullock v. Carter, we minimized the extent to whichvoting rights cases are distinguishable from ballot accesscases, stating that "the rights of voters and the rights ofcandidates do not lend themselves to neat separation." 405U. S., at 143.8 Second, the function of the election processis "to winnow out and finally reject all but the chosen candidates," Storer, 415 U. S., at 735, not to provide a means ofgiving vent to "short-range political goals, pique, or personalquarrel[s]." Ibid. Attributing to elections a more general-ized expressive function would undermine the ability ofStates to operate elections fairly and efficiently. Id., at 730.Accordingly, we have repeatedly upheld reasonable, politically neutral regulations that have the effect of channelingexpressive activity at the polls. SeeMunro, 479 U. S., at199. Petitioner offers no persuasive reason to depart fromthese precedents. Reasonable regulation of elections doesnot require voters to espouse positions that they do not sup-port; it does require them to act in a timely fashion if theywish to express their views in the voting booth. And thereis nothing content based about a flat ban on all forms ofwrite-in ballots.The appropriate standard for evaluating a claim that astate law burdens the right to vote is set forth in Anderson.Applying that standard, we conclude that, in light of the adequate ballot access afforded under Hawaii's election code, the8 Indeed, voters, as well as candidates, have participated in the so-calledballot access cases. E. g., Anderson, supra, at 783.504us2$81D 04-08-96 07:08:40 PAGES OPINPGT439Cite as: 504 U. S. 428 (1992)Opinion of the CourtState's ban on write-in voting imposes only a limited burdenon voters' rights to make free choices and to associate politically through the vote. BWe turn next to the interests asserted by Hawaii to justifythe burden imposed by its prohibition of write-in voting. Because we have already concluded that the burden is slight,the State need not establish a compelling interest to tip theconstitutional scales in its direction. Here, the State's inter-ests outweigh petitioner's limited interest in waiting untilthe eleventh hour to choose his preferred candidate.Hawaii's interest in "avoid[ing] the possibility of unrestrained factionalism at the general election," Munro, supra,at 196, provides adequate justification for its ban on write-invoting in November. The primary election is "an integralpart of the entire election process,"Storer, 415 U. S., at 735,and the State is within its rights to reserve "[t]he generalelection ballot . . . for major struggles . . . [and] not a forumfor continuing intraparty feuds."Ibid.; Munro, supra, at196, 199. The prohibition on write-in voting is a legitimatemeans of averting divisive sore-loser candidacies. Hawaiifurther promotes the two-stage, primary-general electionprocess of winnowing out candidates, see Storer, supra, at735, by permitting the unopposed victors in certain primaries to be designated officeholders. See Haw. Rev. Stat.$$ 12-41, 12-42 (1985). This focuses the attention of votersupon contested races in the general election. This wouldnot be possible, absent the write-in voting ban.Hawaii also asserts that its ban on write-in voting at theprimary stage is necessary to guard against "party raiding."Tashjian, 479 U. S., at 219. Party raiding is generally de-fined as "the organized switching of blocs of voters from oneparty to another in order to manipulate the outcome of theother party's primary election." Anderson, 460 U. S., at789, n. 9. Petitioner suggests that, because Hawaii conductsan open primary, this is not a cognizable interest. We dis504us2$81D 04-08-96 07:08:40 PAGES OPINPGT440 BURDICK v. TAKUSHIOpinion of the Courtagree. While voters may vote on any ticket in Hawaii'sprimary, the State requires that party candidates be "member[s] of the party," Haw. Rev. Stat. $ 12-3(a)(7) (1985), andprohibits candidates from filing "nomination papers both asa party candidate and as a nonpartisan candidate," $ 12-3(c).Hawaii's system could easily be circumvented in a party primary election by mounting a write-in campaign for a personwho had not filed in time or who had never intended to runfor election. It could also be frustrated at the general election by permitting write-in votes for a loser in a party primary or for an independent who had failed to get sufficientvotes to make the general election ballot. The State has alegitimate interest in preventing these sorts of maneuvers,and the write-in voting ban is a reasonable way of accomplishing this goal.9We think these legitimate interests asserted by the Stateare sufficient to outweigh the limited burden that the writein voting ban imposes upon Hawaii's voters.109 The State also supports its ban on write-in voting as a means of enforcing nominating requirements, combating fraud, and "fostering informedand educated expressions of the popular will." Anderson, 460 U. S., at 796.10 Although the dissent purports to agree with the standard we apply indetermining whether the right to vote has been restricted, post, at 445-446, and implies that it is analyzing the write-in ban under some minimallevel of scrutiny, post, at 448, the dissent actually employs strict scrutiny.This is evident from its invocation of quite rigid narrow tailoring requirements. For instance, the dissent argues that the State could adopt a lessdrastic means of preventing sore-loser candidacies, ibid., and that theState could screen out ineligible candidates through postelection disqualification rather than a write-in voting ban. Post, at 450.It seems to us that limiting the choice of candidates to those who havecomplied with state election law requirements is the prototypical exampleof a regulation that, while it affects the right to vote, is eminently reasonable. Anderson, supra, at 788. The dissent's suggestion that voters areentitled to cast their ballots for unqualified candidates appears to bedriven by the assumption that an election system that imposes any restraint on voter choice is unconstitutional. This is simply wrong. Seesupra, at 433-434.504us2$81D 04-08-96 07:08:40 PAGES OPINPGT441Cite as: 504 U. S. 428 (1992)Opinion of the CourtIIIIndeed, the foregoing leads us to conclude that when aState's ballot access laws pass constitutional muster asimposing only reasonable burdens on First and FourteenthAmendment rights--as do Hawaii's election laws--a prohibition on write-in voting will be presumptively valid, since anyburden on the right to vote for the candidate of one's choicewill be light and normally will be counterbalanced by thevery state interests supporting the ballot access scheme.In such situations, the objection to the specific ban onwrite-in voting amounts to nothing more than the insistencethat the State record, count, and publish individual protestsagainst the election system or the choices presented on theballot through the efforts of those who actively participatein the system. There are other means available, however,to voice such generalized dissension from the electoral process; and we discern no adequate basis for our requiring theState to provide and to finance a place on the ballot for recording protests against its constitutionally valid electionlaws.11"No right is more precious in a free country than that ofhaving a voice in the election of those who make the lawsunder which, as good citizens, we must live." Wesberry v.Sanders, 376 U. S. 1, 17 (1964). But the right to vote is theright to participate in an electoral process that is necessarilystructured to maintain the integrity of the democratic system. Anderson, supra, at 788; Storer, 415 U. S., at 730. Wethink that Hawaii's prohibition on write-in voting, consideredas part of an electoral scheme that provides constitutionallysufficient ballot access, does not impose an unconstitutionalburden upon the First and Fourteenth Amendment rights of11 We of course in no way suggest that a State is not free to provide forwrite-in voting, as many States do; nor should this opinion be read todiscourage such provisions.504us2$81D 04-08-96 07:08:40 PAGES OPINPGT442 BURDICK v.
