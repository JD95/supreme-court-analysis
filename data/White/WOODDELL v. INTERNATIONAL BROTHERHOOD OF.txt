We have before us two questions: whether a union memberwho sues his local union for money damages under Title I ofthe Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of1959 (LMRDA), 73 Stat. 519, as amended, 29 U. S. C. $ 401 etseq., is entitled to a jury trial, and whether under $ 301(a) ofthe Labor-Management Relations Act, 1947 (LMRA), 61Stat. 156, 29 U. S. C. $ 185(a),1 the District Court had jurisdic-tion over the breach-of-contract suit brought in this case bya union member against his local union.IPetitioner is a member of Local 71 of the InternationalBrotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW). In the wake ofa dispute arising out of petitioner's opposition to an an-nounced dues increase and to the appointment of a unionrepresentative, the respondent president of the local (peti-tioner's brother) filed internal disciplinary proceedingsagainst petitioner. No decision was finally rendered on thecharges. Later, petitioner alleges, the union discriminatedagainst him in job referrals in the operation of a hiring hallprovided for in Local 71's collective-bargaining contractswith electrical contractors. Petitioner brought suit against*Steven R. Shapiro, John A. Powell, and Helen Hershkoff filed a brieffor the Association for Union Democracy et al. as amici curiae urgingreversal.1 Section 301(a) states: "Suits for violation of contracts between an employer and a labor organization representing employees in an industryaffecting commerce as defined in the Act, or between any such labor organizations, may be brought in any district court of the United States havingjurisdiction of the parties, without respect to the amount in controversyor without regard to the citizenship of the parties." 29 U. S. C. $ 185(a).502us1$$9Z 08-21-96 15:22:40 PAGES OPINPGT96 WOODDELL v. ELECTRICAL WORKERSOpinion of the Courtthe local and its officers in the United States District Court.Petitioner's complaint alleged violation of his rights protected by the LMRDA in that he had been discriminatedagainst in job referrals because of his opposition to proposedunion policy; violation of his right to a fair hearing under theLMRDA; violations of the IBEW Constitution and the bylaws of Local 71, which were alleged to constitute breachesof contract redressable under $ 301 of the LMRA and statelaw; breach of the duty of fair representation redressableunder $ 301; and pendent state-law claims alleging interference with contractual relations and intentional infliction ofemotional distress. Petitioner sought injunctive relief, lostwages and benefits, additional compensatory damages, punitive damages, and attorney's fees. App. 14-15.In the course of acting on two summary judgment motionsfiled by defendants, the District Court dismissed all claimsagainst all defendants. The Court of Appeals reversed thedismissal of the LMRDA free speech-job discriminationclaim but otherwise affirmed the District Court, including itsholding that petitioner had no right to have his LMRDAclaim tried to a jury. Judgt. order reported at 907 F. 2d 151(CA6 1990). With respect to the $ 301 breach-of-contractclaim, the Court of Appeals relied on prior Circuit precedent 2 in holding that $ 301 did not authorize such an actionto be brought by an individual union member. We grantedcertiorari to address both the jury trial and the $ 301 issues.498 U. S. 1082 (1991).2 Trail v. Teamsters, 542 F. 2d 961 (CA6 1976). Other Courts of Appealsthat have addressed this issue since Plumbers and Pipefitters v. Plumbersand Pipefitters, Local 334, 452 U. S. 615 (1981), have reached a contraryconclusion. See, e. g., DeSantiago v. Laborers Int'l Union of NorthAmerica, Local No. 1140, 914 F. 2d 125 (CA8 1990); Pruitt v. CarpentersLocal Union No. 225, 893 F. 2d 1216 (CA11 1990); Lewis v. InternationalBrotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers ofAmerica, Local Union No. 771, 826 F. 2d 1310 (CA3 1987); Kinney v. International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, 669 F. 2d 1222 (CA9 1981).502us1$$9Z 08-21-96 15:22:40 PAGES OPINPGT97Cite as: 502 U. S. 93 (1991)Opinion of the CourtIIWe first address the jury trial issue. The case below wasbriefed and argued before our decision inTeamsters v. Terry,494 U. S. 558 (1990). Although Terry was handed down onMarch 20, 1990, well before the decision of the Court of Ap-peals for the Sixth Circuit, the decision below neither citesnor discusses Terry.To determine whether a particular action will resolve legalrights, and therefore give rise to a jury trial right, we exam-ine both the nature of the issues involved and the remedysought. Id., at 565. " `First, we compare the statutory ac-tion to 18th-century actions brought in the courts of Englandprior to the merger of the courts of law and equity. Second,we examine the remedy sought and determine whether it islegal or equitable in nature.' " Ibid., citing Tull v. UnitedStates, 481 U. S. 412, 417-418 (1987). The second inquiry isthe more important in our analysis.Terry, supra, at 565,citing Granfinanciera, S. A. v. Nordberg, 492 U. S. 33, 42(1989).In Terry, we applied settled principles of Seventh Amendment interpretation to a claim for an employer's breach of acollective-bargaining agreement under $ 301 and the union'sbreach of the duty of fair representation. Generally, anaward of money damages was the traditional form of reliefoffered in the courts of law. Terry, supra, at 570, citingCurtis v. Loether, 415 U. S. 189, 196 (1974). Because wefound that the damages sought were neither analogous toequitable restitutionary relief, Tull, 481 U. S., at 424, nor in-cidental to or intertwined with injunctive relief, ibid., weconcluded that the remedy had none of the attributes re-quired for an exception to the general rule, and thus foundthe remedy sought to be legal. Terry, supra, at 570, 571.Petitioner contends that, although he seeks injunctive relief as well as damages, the injunctive relief is incidental tothe damages, and not vice versa, and that his claim for lostwages cannot be treated as restitutionary incident to an502us1$$9Z 08-21-96 15:22:40 PAGES OPINPGT98 WOODDELL v. ELECTRICAL WORKERSOpinion of the Courtorder reinstating him to a job from which he has been termi-nated, as the damages sought are for pay for jobs to whichthe union failed to refer him. Also, this Court has recent-ly held that actions under the LMRDA are closely analogousto personal injury actions, Reed v. United TransportationUnion, 488 U. S. 319, 326-327 (1989). A personal injury ac-tion is of course a prototypical example of an action at law,to which the Seventh Amendment applies.We agree with petitioner and hold that petitioner was entitled to a jury trial on the LMRDA cause of action, and wenote that respondents now concede that Terry controls thiscase. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment below on thisissue.IIIWhether the subject-matter jurisdiction conferred on thedistrict courts by $ 301 extends to suits on union constitutions brought by individual union members is strongly dis-puted by respondents. We agree with petitioner on thisissue, however.In Smith v. Evening News Assn., 371 U. S. 195, 198 (1962),we held that the word "between" in $ 301 refers to "con-tracts," not "suits,"id., at 200-201. Hence, a suit properlybrought under $ 301 must be a suit either for violation of acontract between an employer and a labor organization rep-resenting employees in an industry affecting commerce orfor violation of a contract between such labor organizations.No employer-union contract is involved here; if the DistrictCourt had $ 301 subject-matter jurisdiction over petitioner'ssuit against his union, it is because his suit alleges a violationof a contract between two unions,3 and because $ 301 is not3 The $ 301 issue is stated as follows by both petitioner and respondents:"Does section 301 of the Labor-Management Relations Act create a federalcause of action under which a union member may sue his union for a violation of the union constitution?" Brief for Petitioner i; Brief for Respondents i. As the text makes clear, the answer to that question is in the502us1$$9Z 08-21-96 15:22:40 PAGES OPINPGT99Cite as: 502 U. S. 93 (1991)Opinion of the Courtlimited to suits brought by a party to that contract, i. e., because one in petitioner's position may properly bring sucha suit.4The first of the two requirements is governed in part byPlumbers and Pipefitters v. Plumbers and Pipefitters, Local334, 452 U. S. 615 (1981). In that case a local union sued theinternational union of which it was a part. The claim wasthat the international had violated a specific provision of itsown constitution by ordering the consolidation of nine localunions into two. The issue was whether that constitutionwas a contract between labor organizations within the meaning of $ 301.Since union constitutions were at the time of enactment ofTaft-Hartley (and remain) probably the most commonplaceform of contract between labor organizations, we concludedthat Congress would not likely have used the unqualifiedterm "contract" without intending to encompass union constitutions. Id., at 624. Certainly Congress could concludethat the enforcement of the terms of union constitutionswould contribute to labor stability, and that $ 301 should beenacted to provide"federal jurisdiction for enforcement of contracts madeby labor organizations to counteract jurisdictional defects in many state courts that made it difficult or impossible to bring suits against labor organizations by reasonof their status as unincorporated organizations." Ibid.(emphasis in original).affirmative, but only if it is charged that the breach alleged violates acontract between two labor organizations.4 Of course, for petitioner to bring suit, he must have personal standing.As the case comes to us, however, the sole issue is whether a suit by aunion member alleging a violation of a contract between two unions iswithin the subject-matter jurisdiction conferred by $ 301. Petitioner'sstanding to bring the suit is not disputed before this Court.502us1$$9Z 08-21-96 15:22:41 PAGES OPINPGT100 WOODDELL v. ELECTRICAL WORKERSOpinion of the CourtTherefore, we held, the suit by the local union was for aviolation of a contract between two unions within the meaning of $ 301.It is clear in this case that petitioner charged a violationof a contract between two unions within the meaning of$ 301.5 His amended complaint alleged that the constitutionof the IBEW requires "all Local Unions to live up to allcollective bargaining agreements" and that the IBEW Constitution and the bylaws of Local 71 "are contracts whichare binding upon Local 71."6 App. 12-13. In its amendedanswer, Local 71 admitted these allegations, i. e., concededthat it had promised to comply with the collective-bargainingcontracts. Petitioner also alleged generally that the de-fendants had breached the above-mentioned contracts; morespecifically, he alleged that he had been discriminatedagainst in hiring-hall job referrals, contrary to the applicablecollective-bargaining agreements and contrary to the IBEWConstitution.Nevertheless, respondents submit that $ 301 jurisdictionreaches only suits by the parties to the interunion contract;third-party suits seeking to enforce a violation of the con-tract are beyond the jurisdictional grant. Smith v. EveningNews, however, is to the contrary. There an individualemployee brought suit against his employer to enforce acollective-bargaining contract between the employer and theunion collective-bargaining agent. We held that $ 301 suits5 It is not disputed that the IBEW, as well as Local 71, is a labor organization representing employees in an industry affecting commerce.6 The Joint Appendix 21-41 sets out selected provisions of the IBEWConstitution. Included is a section entitled "Rules for Local Unions."Among the 23 rules prescribed, in addition to the rule requiring localunions to honor their contracts, is a rule requiring IBEW approval of allbylaws adopted and all agreements entered into by local unions. Thereis a reference in these rules to a "charter" of a local union, but if Local 71has a charter or a constitution, or both, neither is a part of the record inthis case. The complaint refers to bylaws of the local, but the record alsoomits setting out the relevant bylaws.502us1$$9Z 08-21-96 15:22:41 PAGES OPINPGT101Cite as: 502 U. S. 93 (1991)Opinion of the Courtwere not limited to suits brought by the contracting partiesand that an individual employee could sue under $ 301 forviolation of an employer-union contract. We noted:"The rights of individual employees concerning rates ofpay and conditions of employment are a major focus ofthe negotiation and administration of collective bargaining contracts. Individual claims lie at the heart of thegrievance and arbitration machinery, are to a large degree inevitably intertwined with union interests andmany times precipitate grave questions concerning theinterpretation and enforceability of the collective bargaining contract on which they are based." 371 U. S.,at 200.In concluding that the employee's suit was one provided forby $ 301, we observed that under a contrary holding therewould be " `[t]he possibility that individual contract termsmight have different meanings under state and federal law[which] would inevitably exert a disruptive influence uponboth the negotiation and administration of collective agreements.' " Id., at 200-201, quoting Teamsters v. Lucas FlourCo., 369 U. S. 95, 103 (1962).Similar considerations bear on this case. Congress expressly provided in $ 301(a) for federal jurisdiction over contracts between an employer and a labor organization orbetween labor organizations. Collective-bargaining agreements are the principal form of contract between an employer and a labor organization. Individual union members,who are often the beneficiaries of provisions of collectivebargaining agreements, may bring suit on these contractsunder $ 301. Likewise, union constitutions are an importantform of contract between labor organizations. Members of acollective-bargaining unit are often the beneficiaries of suchinterunion contracts, and when they are, they likewise maybring suit on these contracts under $ 301.502us1$$9Z 08-21-96 15:22:41 PAGES OPINPGT102 WOODDELL v. ELECTRICAL WORKERSOpinion of the CourtIf they could not, unacceptable consequences could ensue.There is no doubt that IBEW could sue under $ 301 to enforce Local 71's contract with IBEW and there is no doubtthat such a suit would be governed by federal law. If suitby an employee to enforce an interunion contract is not authorized by $ 301 and the employee is remitted to state courtand to state law, it is plain that the same contract termsmight be given different meanings based solely on the iden-tity of the party. This would exert the disruptive influenceour cases have spoken of.Respondents contend that construing $ 301 as we do signals an unwarranted intrusion on state contract law thatCongress could not have intended. It is argued that the federalization of the law of union-member relationships shouldbe limited to the specific provisions found in the LMRDA.But if $ 301, fairly construed and absent a later statute suchas the LMRDA, covers the suit we now have before us, weshould reach that result even with the appearance of a laterstatute such as the LMRDA unless there is some more persuasive reason derived from the later legislation itself thatCongress intended to narrow the reach of $ 301. We are unable to discern any satisfactory basis for implying such apartial repeal of that section.Neither are we impressed by respondents' submission thatour construction of $ 301 will result in the inundation of thefederal courts with trivial suits dealing with intraunion affairs. While we are not persuaded that this argumentshould affect our interpretation of the language of the statute in any event, we find it unconvincing. As respondentsmust be aware, the interpretation we adopt today has beenthe law in a number of Federal Circuits for some time andwas adopted 10 years ago by the Court of Appeals for theNinth Circuit in a case specifically involving the IBEW Constitution. See Kinney v. International Brotherhood ofElectrical Workers, 669 F. 2d 1222 (1981). See also, e. g.,DeSantiago v. Laborers Int'l Union of North America,502us1$$9Z 08-21-96 15:22:41 PAGES OPINPGT103Cite as: 502 U. S. 93 (1991)Opinion of the CourtLocal No. 1140, 914 F. 2d 125 (CA8 1990); Pruitt v.

International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs,Warehousemen and Helpers of America, Local Union No.771, 826 F. 2d 1310 (CA3 1987). Respondents have pointedto no evidence of the federal courts' being overwhelmed bytrivial litigation in this area of the law.We express no view on the merits of petitioner's claims forbreach of contract. We need only decide here that thecourts below erred in holding that federal jurisdiction under$ 301(a), based on the alleged violation of a contract betweenlabor organizations, is unavailable when an individual unionmember brings suit against his or her union.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and thecause is remanded for further proceedings consistent withthis opinion.
