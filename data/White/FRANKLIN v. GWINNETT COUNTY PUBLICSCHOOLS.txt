According to the complaint filed on Decem-ber 29, 1988, in the United States District Court for theNorthern District of Georgia, Franklin was subjected to con-tinual sexual harassment beginning in the autumn of hertenth grade year (1986) from Andrew Hill, a sports coach andteacher employed by the district.

The court noted that analysis of Title IX andTitle VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000det seq. (Title VI), has developed along similar lines. Citingas binding precedentDrayden v. Needville IndependentSchool Dist., 642 F. 2d 129 (CA5 1981), a decision renderedprior to the division of the Fifth Circuit, the court concludedthat Title VI did not support a claim for monetary damages.The court then analyzed this Court's decision in GuardiansAssn. v. Civil Service Comm'n of New York City, 463 U. S.582 (1983), to determine whether it implicitly overruledDrayden. The court stated that the absence of a majorityopinion left unresolved the question whether a court couldaward such relief upon a showing of intentional discrimina-tion. As a second basis for its holding that monetary damages were unavailable, the court reasoned that Title IX wasenacted under Congress' Spending Clause powers and that3 Prior to bringing this lawsuit, Franklin filed a complaint with the Officefor Civil Rights of the United States Department of Education (OCR) inAugust 1988. After investigating these charges for several months, OCRconcluded that the school district had violated Franklin's rights by subjecting her to physical and verbal sexual harassment and by interfering withher right to complain about conduct proscribed by Title IX. OCR determined, however, that because of the resignations of Hill and respondentWilliam Prescott and the implementation of a school grievance procedure,the district had come into compliance with Title IX. It then terminatedits investigation. First Amended Complaint, Exh. A, pp. 7-9.503us1$35D 11-13-95 21:15:41 PAGES OPINPGT65Cite as: 503 U.

Accordingly, it held that an action for monetarydamages could not be sustained for an alleged intentionalviolation of Title IX, and affirmed the District Court's rulingto that effect.

S. 677 (1979),the Court held that Title IX is enforceable through an implied right of action. We have no occasion here to recon-sider that decision. Rather, in this case we must decidewhat remedies are available in a suit brought pursuant tothis implied right. As we have often stated, the question ofwhat remedies are available under a statute that provides aprivate right of action is "analytically distinct" from the issue4 The court also rejected an argument by Franklin that the terms ofoutright prohibition of Title VII, 42 U. S. C. $$ 2000e to 2000e-17, apply byanalogy to Title IX's antidiscrimination provision, and that the remediesavailable under the two statutes should also be the same. 911 F. 2d, at622. Because Franklin does not pursue this contention here, we need notaddress whether it has merit.5 Judge Johnson concurred specially, writing that the result was controlled by Drayden v. Needville Independent School Dist., 642 F. 2d 129(CA5 1981), and that there was no need to address whether Titles VI andIX are grounded solely in the Spending Clause and whether Title VIIanalysis should apply to an action under Titles VI or IX.

Davis v.Passman, 442 U. S. 228, 239 (1979). Thus, although we examine the text and history of a statute to determine whetherCongress intended to create a right of action, Touche Ross &Co. v. Redington, 442 U. S. 560, 575-576 (1979), we presumethe availability of all appropriate remedies unless Congresshas expressly indicated otherwise. Davis, supra, at 246-247. This principle has deep roots in our jurisprudence.A"[W]here legal rights have been invaded, and a federalstatute provides for a general right to sue for such invasion,federal courts may use any available remedy to make goodthe wrong done." Bell v. Hood, 327 U. S. 678, 684 (1946).The Court explained this longstanding rule as jurisdictionaland upheld the exercise of the federal courts' power to awardappropriate relief so long as a cause of action existed underthe Constitution or laws of the United States. Ibid.The Bell Court's reliance on this rule was hardly revolutionary. From the earliest years of the Republic, the Courthas recognized the power of the Judiciary to award appropriate remedies to redress injuries actionable in federalcourt, although it did not always distinguish clearly betweena right to bring suit and a remedy available under such aright. In Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 163 (1803), forexample, Chief Justice Marshall observed that our Government "has been emphatically termed a government of laws,and not of men. It will certainly cease to deserve this highappellation, if the laws furnish no remedy for the violationof a vested legal right." This principle originated in theEnglish common law, and Blackstone described it as "a general and indisputable rule, that where there is a legal right,there is also a legal remedy, by suit or action at law, whenever that right is invaded." 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries23 (1783). See also Ashby v. White, 1 Salk. 19, 21, 87 Eng.503us1$35D 11-13-95 21:15:41 PAGES OPINPGT67Cite as: 503 U. S. 60 (1992)Opinion of the CourtRep. 808, 816 (Q. B. 1702) ("If a statute gives a right, thecommon law will give a remedy to maintain that right . . .").In Kendall v. United States ex rel. Stokes, 12 Pet. 524(1838), the Court applied these principles to an Act of Congress that accorded a right of action in mail carriers to suefor adjustment and settlement of certain claims for extraservices but which did not specify the precise remedy available to the carriers. After surveying possible remedies,which included an action against the Postmaster General formonetary damages, the Court held that the carriers wereentitled to a writ of mandamus compelling payment underthe terms of the statute. "It cannot be denied but that congress had the power to command that act to be done," theCourt stated; "and the power to enforce the performance ofthe act must rest somewhere, or it will present a case whichhas often been said to involve a monstrous absurdity in awell organized government, that there should be no remedy,although a clear and undeniable right should be shown toexist. And if the remedy cannot be applied by the circuitcourt of this district, it exists nowhere." Id., at 624.Dooley v. United States, 182 U. S. 222, 229 (1901), also restated "the principle that a liability created by statute without a remedy may be enforced by a common-law action."The Court relied upon this traditional presumption againafter passage of the Federal Safety Appliance Act of 1893,ch. 196, 27 Stat. 531. In Texas & Pacific R. Co. v. Rigsby,241 U. S. 33 (1916), the Court first had to determine whetherthe Act supported an implied right of action. After answering that question in the affirmative, the Court then upheld aclaim for monetary damages: "A disregard of the commandof the statute is a wrongful act, and where it results in damage to one of the class for whose especial benefit the statutewas enacted, the right to recover the damages from theparty in default is implied, according to a doctrine of thecommon law . . . ." Id., at 39. The foundation upon whichthe Bell v. Hood Court articulated this traditional presump503us1$35D 11-13-95 21:15:41 PAGES OPINPGT68 FRANKLIN v. GWINNETT COUNTY PUBLIC SCHOOLSOpinion of the Courttion, therefore, was well settled. See also Texas & New Or-leans R. Co. v. Railway Clerks, 281 U. S. 548, 569 (1930).BRespondents and the United States as amicus curiae,however, maintain that whatever the traditional presumption may have been when the Court decided Bell v. Hood, ithas disappeared in succeeding decades. We do not agree.In J. I. Case Co. v. Borak, 377 U. S. 426 (1964), the Courtadhered to the general rule that all appropriate relief isavailable in an action brought to vindicate a federal rightwhen Congress has given no indication of its purpose withrespect to remedies. Relying on Bell v. Hood, the BorakCourt specifically rejected an argument that a court's remedial power to redress violations of the Securities ExchangeAct of 1934 was limited to a declaratory judgment. 377U. S., at 433-434. The Court concluded that the federalcourts "have the power to grant all necessary remedialrelief " for violations of the Act. Id., at 435. As JusticeClark's opinion for the Court observed, this holding closelyfollowed the reasoning of a similar case brought under theSecurities Act of 1933, in which the Court had stated:" `The power to enforce implies the power to make effec-tive the right of recovery afforded by the Act. And thepower to make the right of recovery effective impliesthe power to utilize any of the procedures or actionsnormally available to the litigant according to the exi-gencies of the particular case.' "Id., at 433-434 (quot-ing Deckert v. Independence Shares Corp., 311 U. S. 282,288 (1940)).That a statute does not authorize the remedy at issue "in somany words is no more significant than the fact that it doesnot in terms authorize execution to issue on a judgment."Id., at 288. Subsequent cases have been true to this posi503us1$35D 11-13-95 21:15:42 PAGES OPINPGT69Cite as: 503 U. S. 60 (1992)Opinion of the Courttion. See, e. g., Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, Inc., 396U. S. 229, 239 (1969), stating that the "existence of a statutory right implies the existence of all necessary and appropriate remedies"; Carey v. Piphus, 435 U. S. 247, 255 (1978),upholding damages remedy under Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42U. S. C. $ 1983, even though the enacting Congress had notspecifically provided such relief.The United States contends that the traditional presumption in favor of all appropriate relief was abandoned by theCourt in Davis v. Passman, 442 U. S. 228 (1979), and thatthe Bell v. Hood rule was limited to actions claiming constitutional violations. The United States quotes language inDavis to the effect that "the question of who may enforce astatutory right is fundamentally different from the questionof who may enforce a right that is protected by the Constitution." Davis, 442 U. S., at 241. The Government's position,however, mirrors the very misunderstanding over the difference between a cause of action and the relief afforded underit that sparked the confusion we attempted to clarify inDavis. Whether Congress may limit the class of personswho have a right of action under Title IX is irrelevant to theissue in this lawsuit. To reiterate, "the question whether alitigant has a `cause of action' is analytically distinct andprior to the question of what relief, if any, a litigant maybe entitled to receive." Id., at 239. Davis, therefore, didnothing to interrupt the long line of cases in which the Courthas held that if a right of action exists to enforce a federalright and Congress is silent on the question of remedies, afederal court may order any appropriate relief. See id., at247, n. 26 (contrasting Brown v. GSA, 425 U. S. 820 (1976)).66 Cases cited by respondents and the United States since Davis are inapposite, either because they involved holdings that plaintiffs had no rightof action, see, e. g., Virginia Bankshares, Inc. v. Sandberg, 501 U. S. 1083(1991); Karahalios v. Federal Employees, 489 U. S. 527 (1989); Thompson503us1$35D 11-13-95 21:15:42 PAGES OPINPGT70 FRANKLIN v. GWINNETT COUNTY PUBLIC SCHOOLSOpinion of the CourtContrary to arguments by respondents and the UnitedStates that Guardians Assn. v. Civil Service Comm'n ofNew York City, 463 U. S. 582 (1983), and Consolidated RailCorporation v. Darrone, 465 U. S. 624 (1984), eroded this traditional presumption, those cases in fact support it. Thoughthe multiple opinions in Guardians suggest the difficulty ofinferring the common ground among the Justices in thatcase, a clear majority expressed the view that damages wereavailable under Title VI in an action seeking remedies for anintentional violation, and no Justice challenged the traditional presumption in favor of a federal court's power toaward appropriate relief in a cognizable cause of action.See Guardians, 463 U. S., at 595 (White, J., joined byRehnquist, J.); id., at 607-611 (Powell, J., concurring injudgment, joined by Burger, C. J.); id., at 612, and n. 1(O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment); id., at 624-628 (Marshall, J., dissenting); id., at 636 (Stevens, J., dissenting,joined by Brennan and Blackmun, JJ.). The correctness ofthis inference was made clear the following Term when theCourt unanimously held that the 1978 amendment to $ 504 ofthe Rehabilitation Act of 1973--which had expressly incorporated the "remedies, procedures, and rights set forth in titleVI" (29 U. S. C. $ 794a(a)(2))--authorizes an award of backpay. In Darrone, the Court observed that a majority inGuardians had "agreed that retroactive relief is available toprivate plaintiffs for all discrimination . . . that is actionableunder Title VI." 465 U. S., at 630, n. 9. The general rule,therefore, is that absent clear direction to the contrary byv. Thompson, 484 U. S. 174 (1988); Texas Industries, Inc. v. Radcliff Materials, Inc., 451 U. S. 630 (1981); California v. Sierra Club, 451 U. S. 287(1981); Northwest Airlines, Inc. v. Transport Workers, 451 U. S. 77 (1981);Touche Ross & Co. v. Redington, 442 U. S. 560 (1979); Securities InvestorProtection Corp. v. Barbour, 421 U. S. 412 (1975); or because the Courtrejected a claim for damages under a statute that expressly enumeratedthe remedies available to plaintiffs, Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. v.Russell, 473 U. S. 134 (1985).503us1$35D 11-13-95 21:15:42 PAGES OPINPGT71Cite as: 503 U. S. 60 (1992)Opinion of the CourtCongress, the federal courts have the power to award anyappropriate relief in a cognizable cause of action broughtpursuant to a federal statute.IIIWe now address whether Congress intended to limit appli-cation of this general principle in the enforcement of TitleIX. See Bush v. Lucas, 462 U. S. 367, 378 (1983); WyandotteTransportation Co. v. United States, 389 U. S. 191, 200(1967). Because the cause of action was inferred by theCourt in Cannon, the usual recourse to statutory text andlegislative history in the period prior to that decision necessarily will not enlighten our analysis. Respondents and theUnited States fundamentally misunderstand the nature ofthe inquiry, therefore, by needlessly dedicating large por-tions of their briefs to discussions of how the text and legislative intent behind Title IX are "silent" on the issue of avail-able remedies. Since the Court in Cannon concluded thatthis statute supported no express right of action, it is hardlysurprising that Congress also said nothing about the applicable remedies for an implied right of action.During the period prior to the decision in Cannon, theinquiry in any event is not " `basically a matter of statutoryconstruction,' " as the United States asserts. Brief forUnited States as Amicus Curiae 8 (quoting TransamericaMortgage Advisors, Inc. v. Lewis, 444 U. S. 11, 15 (1979)).Rather, in determining Congress' intent to limit applicationof the traditional presumption in favor of all appropriate re-lief, we evaluate the state of the law when the Legislaturepassed Title IX. Cf. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &Smith, Inc. v. Curran, 456 U. S. 353, 378 (1982). In theyears before and after Congress enacted this statute, theCourt "follow[ed] a common-law tradition [and] regarded thedenial of a remedy as the exception rather than the rule."Id., at 375 (footnote omitted). As we outlined in Part II,this has been the prevailing presumption in our federal503us1$35D 11-13-95 21:15:42 PAGES OPINPGT72 FRANKLIN v. GWINNETT COUNTY PUBLIC SCHOOLSOpinion of the Courtcourts since at least the early 19th century. In Cannon, themajority upheld an implied right of action in part because inthe decade immediately preceding enactment of Title IX in1972, this Court had found implied rights of action in sixcases.7 In three of those cases, the Court had approved adamages remedy. See, e. g., J. I. Case Co., 377 U. S., at 433;Wyandotte Transportation Co., supra, at 207; Sullivan v.Little Hunting Park, Inc., 396 U. S. 229 (1969). Whollyapart from the wisdom of the Cannon holding, therefore, thesame contextual approach used to justify an implied right ofaction more than amply demonstrates the lack of any legislative intent to abandon the traditional presumption in favorof all available remedies.In the years after the announcement of Cannon, on theother hand, a more traditional method of statutory analysisis possible, because Congress was legislating with full cognizance of that decision. Our reading of the two amendmentsto Title IX enacted afterCannon leads us to conclude thatCongress did not intend to limit the remedies available ina suit brought under Title IX. In the Rehabilitation ActAmendments of 1986, 100 Stat. 1845, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000d-7,Congress abrogated the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity under Title IX, Title VI, $ 504 of the Rehabilitation Actof 1973, and the Age Discrimination Act of 1975. This stat-ute cannot be read except as a validation ofCannon's holding. A subsection of the 1986 law provides that in a suitagainst a State, "remedies (including remedies both at lawand in equity) are available for such a violation to the sameextent as such remedies are available for such a violation inthe suit against any public or private entity other than a7 J. I. Case Co. v. Borak, 377 U. S. 426 (1964); Wyandotte TransportationCo. v. United States, 389 U. S. 191 (1967); Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co.,392 U. S. 409 (1968); Allen v.

S.6 (1971).503us1$35D 11-13-95 21:15:42 PAGES OPINPGT73Cite as: 503 U. S. 60 (1992)Opinion of the CourtState." 42 U. S. C. $ 2000d-7(a)(2). While it is true thatthis saving clause says nothing about the nature of thoseother available remedies, cf. Milwaukee v. Illinois, 451 U. S.304, 329, n. 22 (1981), absent any contrary indication in thetext or history of the statute, we presume Congress enactedthis statute with the prevailing traditional rule in mind.In addition to the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986,Congress also enacted the Civil Rights Restoration Act of1987, Pub. L. 100-259, 102 Stat. 28. Without in any wayaltering the existing rights of action and the correspondingremedies permissible under Title IX, Title VI, $ 504 of theRehabilitation Act, and the Age Discrimination Act, Congress broadened the coverage of these antidiscriminationprovisions in this legislation. In seeking to correct whatit considered to be an unacceptable decision on our part inGrove City College v. Bell, 465 U. S. 555 (1984), Congressmade no effort to restrict the right of action recognized inCannon and ratified in the 1986 Act or to alter the traditionalpresumption in favor of any appropriate relief for violationof a federal right. We cannot say, therefore, that Congresshas limited the remedies available to a complainant in a suitbrought under Title IX.IVRespondents and the United States nevertheless suggestthree reasons why we should not apply the traditional presumption in favor of appropriate relief in this case.AFirst, respondents argue that an award of damages vio-lates separation of powers principles because it unduly expands the federal courts' power into a sphere properlyreserved to the Executive and Legislative Branches. Brieffor Respondents 22-25. In making this argument, respond-ents misconceive the difference between a cause of actionand a remedy. Unlike the finding of a cause of action, whichauthorizes a court to hear a case or controversy, the discre503us1$35D 11-13-95 21:15:42 PAGES OPINPGT74 FRANKLIN v. GWINNETT COUNTY PUBLIC SCHOOLSOpinion of the Courttion to award appropriate relief involves no such increasein judicial power. See generally Note, Federal Jurisdictionin Suits for Damages Under Statutes Not Affording SuchRemedy, 48 Colum. L. Rev. 1090, 1094-1095 (1948). Federalcourts cannot reach out to award remedies when the Consti-tution or laws of the United States do not support a cause ofaction. Indeed, properly understood, respondents' positioninvites us toabdicate our historic judicial authority to awardappropriate relief in cases brought in our court system. Itis well to recall that such authority historically has beenthought necessary to provide an important safeguard againstabuses of legislative and executive power, see Kendall v.United States ex rel. Stokes, 12 Pet. 524 (1838), as well as toensure an independent Judiciary. See generally Katz, TheJurisprudence of Remedies: Constitutional Legality and theLaw of Torts in Bell v. Hood, 117 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1, 16-17(1968). Moreover, selective abdication of the sort advocatedhere would harm separation of powers principles in anotherway, by giving judges the power to render inutile causes ofaction authorized by Congress through a decision thatnoremedy is available.BNext, consistent with the Court of Appeals' reasoning, re-spondents and the United States contend that the normalpresumption in favor of all appropriate remedies should notapply because Title IX was enacted pursuant to Congress'Spending Clause power. In Pennhurst State School andHospital v. Halderman, 451 U. S. 1, 28-29 (1981), the Courtobserved that remedies were limited under such SpendingClause statutes when the alleged violation was unintentional. Respondents and the United States maintain thatthis presumption should apply equally to intentional violations. We disagree. The point of not permitting monetarydamages for an unintentional violation is that the receivingentity of federal funds lacks notice that it will be liable for amonetary award. See id., at 17. This notice problem does503us1$35D 11-13-95 21:15:42 PAGES OPINPGT75Cite as: 503 U. S. 60 (1992)Opinion of the Courtnot arise in a case such as this, in which intentional discrimi-nation is alleged. Unquestionably, Title IX placed on theGwinnett County Public Schools the duty not to discriminateon the basis of sex, and "when a supervisor sexually harassesa subordinate because of the subordinate's sex, that super-visor `discriminate[s]' on the basis of sex."Meritor Sav.Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U. S. 57, 64 (1986). We believethe same rule should apply when a teacher sexually harassesand abuses a student. Congress surely did not intend forfederal moneys to be expended to support the intentionalactions it sought by statute to proscribe. Moreover, thenotion that Spending Clause statutes do not authorize mone-tary awards for intentional violations is belied by our unanimous holding in Darrone. See 465 U. S., at 628. Respond-ents and the United States characterize the backpay remedyin Darrone as equitable relief, but this description is irrele-vant to their underlying objection: that application of thetraditional rule in this case will require state entities to paymonetary awards out of their treasuries for intentional violations of federal statutes.8 CFinally, the United States asserts that the remedies per-missible under Title IX should nevertheless be limited tobackpay and prospective relief. In addition to divergingfrom our traditional approach to deciding what remedies areavailable for violation of a federal right, this position con-flicts with sound logic. First, both remedies are equitablein nature, and it is axiomatic that a court should determine8 Franklin argues that, in any event, Title IX should not be viewed solelyas having been enacted under Congress' Spending Clause powers and thatit also rests on powers derived from $ 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.See Brief for Petitioner 19, n. 10. Because we conclude that a moneydamages remedy is available under Title IX for an intentional violationirrespective of the constitutional source of Congress' power to enact thestatute, we need not decide which power Congress utilized in enactingTitle IX.503us1$35D 11-13-95 21:15:42 PAGES OPINPGT76 FRANKLIN v. GWINNETT COUNTY PUBLIC SCHOOLSScalia, J., concurring in judgmentthe adequacy of a remedy in law before resorting to equita-ble relief. Under the ordinary convention, the proper inquiry would be whether monetary damages provided anadequate remedy, and if not, whether equitable relief wouldbe appropriate. Whitehead v. Shattuck, 138 U. S. 146, 150(1891). See generally C. McCormick, Damages 1 (1935).Moreover, in this case the equitable remedies suggested byrespondent and the Federal Government are clearly inadequate. Backpay does nothing for petitioner, because shewas a student when the alleged discrimination occurred.Similarly, because Hill--the person she claims subjected herto sexual harassment--no longer teaches at the school andshe herself no longer attends a school in the Gwinnett sys-tem, prospective relief accords her no remedy at all. TheGovernment's answer that administrative action helps othersimilarly situated students in effect acknowledges that itsapproach would leave petitioner remediless.VIn sum, we conclude that a damages remedy is availablefor an action brought to enforce Title IX. The judgment ofthe Court of Appeals, therefore, is reversed, and the caseis remanded for further proceedings consistent with thisopinion. So ordered.Justice Scalia, with whom The Chief Justice andJustice Thomas join, concurring in the judgment.The substantive right at issue here is one that Congressdid not expressly create, but that this Court found to be "implied." See Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U. S. 677(1979). Quite obviously, the search for what was Congress'remedial intent as to a right whose very existence Congressdid not expressly acknowledge is unlikely to succeed, seeante, at 71; it is "hardly surprising," as the Court says, ibid.,that the usual sources yield no explicit answer.503us1$35D 11-13-95 21:15:42 PAGES OPINPGT77Cite as: 503 U. S. 60 (1992)Scalia, J., concurring in judgmentThe Court finds an implicit answer, however, in the legisla-tors' presumptive awareness of our practice of using "anyavailable remedy" to redress violations of legal rights. Bellv.Hood, 327 U. S. 678, 684 (1946); see ante, at 72-73. Thisstrikes me as question begging. We can plausibly assumeacquiescence in our Bell v. Hood presumption when the Leg-islature says nothing about remedy in expressly creating aprivate right of action; perhaps even when it says nothingabout remedy in creating a private right of action by cleartextual implication; but not, I think, when it says nothingabout remedy in a statute in which the courts divine a private right of action on the basis of "contextual" evidencesuch as that in Cannon, which charged Congress with knowledge of a court of appeals' creation of a cause of action undera similarly worded statute. See Cannon, supra, at 696-698.Whatever one thinks of the validity of the last approach, itsurely rests on attributed rather than actual congressionalknowledge. It does not demonstrate an explicit legislativedecision to create a cause of action, and so could not be expected to be accompanied by a legislative decision to alterthe application of Bell v. Hood. Given the nature of Cannonand some of our earlier "implied right of action" cases, whatthe Court's analytical construct comes down to is this: UnlessCongress expressly legislates a more limited remedial policywith respect to rights of action it does not know it is creating, it intends the full gamut of remedies to be applied.In my view, when rights of action are judicially "implied,"categorical limitations upon their remedial scope may bejudicially implied as well. Cf. Cort v. Ash, 422 U. S. 66,84-85 (1975). Although we have abandoned the expansiverights-creating approach exemplified by Cannon, see ToucheRoss & Co. v. Redington, 442 U. S. 560, 575-576 (1979);Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc. v. Lewis, 444 U. S.11, 18, 23-24 (1979)--and perhaps ought to abandon the notion of implied causes of action entirely, see Thompson v.Thompson, 484 U. S. 174, 191 (1988) (Scalia, J., concurring503us1$35D 11-13-95 21:15:42 PAGES OPINPGT78 FRANKLIN v. GWINNETT COUNTY PUBLIC SCHOOLSScalia, J., concurring in judgmentin judgment)--causes of action that came into existenceunder the ancien regime should be limited by the same logicthat gave them birth. To require, with respect to a rightthat is not consciously and intentionally created, that anylimitation of remedies must be express, is to provide, in ef-fect, that the most questionable of private rights will alsobe the most expansively remediable. As the United Statesputs it, "[w]hatever the merits of `implying' rights of actionmay be, there is no justification for treating [congressional]silence as the equivalent of the broadest imaginable grantof remedial authority." Brief for United States as AmicusCuriae 12-13.I nonetheless agree with the Court's disposition of thiscase. Because of legislation enacted subsequent to Cannon,it is too late in the day to address whether a judicially implied exclusion of damages under Title IX would be appro-priate. The Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986, 42U. S. C. $ 2000d-7(a)(2), must be read, in my view, not only"as a validation ofCannon's holding," ante, at 72, but also asan implicit acknowledgment that damages are available.See 42 U. S. C. $ 2000d-7(a)(1) (withdrawing the States' Elev-enth Amendment immunity); $ 2000d-7(a)(2) (providing that,in suits against States, "remedies (including remedies bothat law and in equity) are available for [violations of Title IX]to the same extent as such remedies are available for such aviolation in the suit against any public or private entity otherthan a State"). I therefore concur in the judgment.503us1$36z 02-24-99 09:33:28 PAGES OPINPGT79OCTOBER TERM, 1991SyllabusINDOPCO, INC. v. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNALREVENUEcertiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe third circuitNo. 90-1278. Argued November 12, 1991--Decided February 26, 1992On its 1978 federal income tax return, petitioner corporation claimed adeduction for certain investment banking fees and expenses that it incurred during a friendly acquisition in which it was transformed from apublicly held, freestanding corporation into a wholly owned subsidiary.After respondent Commissioner disallowed the claim, petitioner soughtreconsideration in the Tax Court, adding to its claim deductions for legalfees and other acquisition-related expenses. The Tax Court ruled thatbecause long-term benefits accrued to petitioner from the acquisition,the expenditures were capital in nature and not deductible under$ 162(a) of the Internal Revenue Code as "ordinary and necessary" business expenses. The Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting petitioner'sargument that, because the expenses did not "create or enhance . . . aseparate and distinct additional asset," see Commissioner v. LincolnSavings & Loan Assn., 403 U. S. 345, 354, they could not be capitalizedunder $ 263 of the Code.Held: Petitioner's expenses do not qualify for deduction under $ 162(a).Deductions are exceptions to the norm of capitalization and are allowedonly if there is clear provision for them in the Code and the taxpayerhas met the burden of showing a right to the deduction. Commissionerv. Lincoln Savings & Loan Assn., supra, holds simply that the creationof a separate and distinct asset may be a sufficient condition for classification as a capital expenditure, not that it is a prerequisite to such classification. Nor does Lincoln Savings prohibit reliance on future benefitas means of distinguishing an ordinary business expense from a capitalexpenditure. Although the presence of an incidental future benefit maynot warrant capitalization, a taxpayer's realization of benefits beyondthe year in which the expenditure is incurred is important in determining whether the appropriate tax treatment is immediate deduction orcapitalization. The record in the instant case amply supports the lowercourts' findings that the transaction produced significant benefits topetitioner extending beyond the tax year in question.

See App. 12,149. Petitioner INDOPCO, Inc., formerly named NationalStarch and Chemical Corporation and hereinafter referredto as National Starch, is a Delaware corporation that manufactures and sells adhesives, starches, and specialty chemicalproducts. In October 1977, representatives of UnileverUnited States, Inc., also a Delaware corporation (Unilever),1expressed interest in acquiring National Starch, which wasone of its suppliers, through a friendly transaction. National Starch at the time had outstanding over 6,563,000 common shares held by approximately 3,700 shareholders. Thestock was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Frankand Anna Greenwall were the corporation's largest shareholders and owned approximately 14.5% of the common.The Greenwalls, getting along in years and concerned about*Timothy J.

S. 79 (1992)Opinion of the Courttheir estate plans, indicated that they would transfer theirshares to Unilever only if a transaction tax free for themcould be arranged.Lawyers representing both sides devised a "reverse subsidiary cash merger" that they felt would satisfy the Greenwalls' concerns. Two new entities would be created--National Starch and Chemical Holding Corp. (Holding), asubsidiary of Unilever, and NSC Merger, Inc., a subsidiaryof Holding that would have only a transitory existence. Inan exchange specifically designed to be tax free under $ 351of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U. S. C. $ 351, Holdingwould exchange one share of its nonvoting preferred stockfor each share of National Starch common that it receivedfrom National Starch shareholders. Any National Starchcommon that was not so exchanged would be converted intocash in a merger of NSC Merger, Inc., into National Starch.In November 1977, National Starch's directors were formally advised of Unilever's interest and the proposed transaction. At that time, Debevoise, Plimpton, Lyons & Gates,National Starch's counsel, told the directors that under Delaware law they had a fiduciary duty to ensure that the proposed transaction would be fair to the shareholders. National Starch thereupon engaged the investment bankingfirm of Morgan Stanley & Co., Inc., to evaluate its shares, torender a fairness opinion, and generally to assist in the eventof the emergence of a hostile tender offer.Although Unilever originally had suggested a price between $65 and $70 per share, negotiations resulted in a finaloffer of $73.50 per share, a figure Morgan Stanley found tobe fair. Following approval by National Starch's board andthe issuance of a favorable private ruling from the InternalRevenue Service that the transaction would be tax freeunder $ 351 for those National Starch shareholders who ex503us1$36F 02-24-99 09:33:28 PAGES OPINPGT82 INDOPCO, INC. v.

The Debevoise firm charged NationalStarch $490,000, along with $15,069 for out-of-pocket expenses. National Starch also incurred expenses aggregat-ing $150,962 for miscellaneous items--such as accounting,printing, proxy solicitation, and Securities and ExchangeCommission fees--in connection with the transaction. Noissue is raised as to the propriety or reasonableness ofthese charges.On its federal income tax return for its short taxable yearended August 15, 1978, National Starch claimed a deductionfor the $2,225,586 paid to Morgan Stanley, but did not deductthe $505,069 paid to Debevoise or the other expenses. Uponaudit, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue disallowed theclaimed deduction and issued a notice of deficiency. Petitioner sought redetermination in the United States TaxCourt, asserting, however, not only the right to deduct theinvestment banking fees and expenses but, as well, the legaland miscellaneous expenses incurred.The Tax Court, in an unreviewed decision, ruled that theexpenditures were capital in nature and therefore not deductible under $ 162(a) in the 1978 return as "ordinary andnecessary expenses."National Starch and Chemical Corp.v.Commissioner, 93 T.

C. $$ 167(a) and336(a); Treas. Reg. $ 1.167(a), 26 CFR $ 1.167(a) (1991).Through provisions such as these, the Code endeavors tomatch expenses with the revenues of the taxable period towhich they are properly attributable, thereby resulting in amore accurate calculation of net income for tax purposes.See, e. g., Commissioner v. Idaho Power Co., 418 U. S. 1, 16(1974);Ellis Banking Corp. v. Commissioner, 688 F. 2d 1376,1379 (CA11 1982), cert. denied, 463 U.

Interstate TransitLines v. Commissioner, 319 U. S. 590, 593 (1943); Deputy v.Du Pont, 308 U. S. 488, 493 (1940); New Colonial Ice Co. v.Helvering, 292 U. S. 435, 440 (1934). The notion that deduc-tions are exceptions to the norm of capitalization finds support in various aspects of the Code. Deductions are specifi-cally enumerated and thus are subject to disallowance infavor of capitalization. See $$ 161 and 261. Nondeductiblecapital expenditures, by contrast, are not exhaustively enumerated in the Code; rather than providing a "complete listof nondeductible expenditures,"Lincoln Savings, 403 U. S.,at 358, $ 263 serves as a general means of distinguishing capital expenditures from current expenses. See Commissionerv.Idaho Power Co., 418 U. S., at 16. For these reasons, de-ductions are strictly construed and allowed only "as there isa clear provision therefor." New Colonial Ice Co. v. Helve-ring, 292 U. S., at 440; Deputy v. Du Pont, 308 U.

For example, inLincoln Savings, we determined that, to qualify for deduc-tion under $ 162(a), "an item must (1) be `paid or incurredduring the taxable year,' (2) be for `carrying on any trade orbusiness,' (3) be an `expense,' (4) be a `necessary' expense,and (5) be an `ordinary' expense." 403 U.

The Court has recognized,however, that the "decisive distinctions" between current expenses and capital expenditures "are those of degree and notof kind,"Welch v. Helvering, 290 U. S., at 114, and that because each case "turns on its special facts," Deputy v. DuPont, 308 U. S., at 496, the cases sometimes appear difficultto harmonize. SeeWelch v. Helvering, 290 U. S., at 116.National Starch contends that the decision in Lincoln Savings changed these familiar backdrops and announced an exclusive test for identifying capital expenditures, a test inwhich "creation or enhancement of an asset" is a prerequisiteto capitalization, and deductibility under $ 162(a) is the rulerather than the exception. Brief for Petitioner 16. We donot agree, for we conclude that National Starch has overreadLincoln Savings.In Lincoln Savings, we were asked to decide whether certain premiums, required by federal statute to be paid by asavings and loan association to the Federal Savings and LoanInsurance Corporation (FSLIC), were ordinary and necessary expenses under $ 162(a), as Lincoln Savings argued andthe Court of Appeals had held, or capital expenditures under$ 263, as the Commissioner contended. We found that the"additional" premiums, the purpose of which was to provideFSLIC with a secondary reserve fund in which each insuredinstitution retained a pro rata interest recoverable in certainsituations, "serv[e] to create or enhance for Lincoln what isessentially a separate and distinct additional asset." 403U. S., at 354. "[A]s an inevitable consequence," we concluded, "the payment is capital in nature and not an expense,let alone an ordinary expense, deductible under $ 162(a)."Ibid.Lincoln Savings stands for the simple proposition that ataxpayer's expenditure that "serves to create or enhance . . .a separate and distinct" asset should be capitalized under$ 263. It by no means follows, however, that only expenditures that create or enhance separate and distinct assets are503us1$36F 02-24-99 09:33:28 PAGES OPINPGT87Cite as: 503 U. S. 79 (1992)Opinion of the Courtto be capitalized under $ 263. We had no occasion in LincolnSavings to consider the tax treatment of expenditures that,unlike the additional premiums at issue there, did not createor enhance a specific asset, and thus the case cannot be readto preclude capitalization in other circumstances. In short,Lincoln Savings holds that the creation of a separate anddistinct asset well may be a sufficient, but not a necessary,condition to classification as a capital expenditure. See General Bancshares Corp. v. Commissioner, 326 F. 2d 712, 716(CA8) (although expenditures may not "resul[t] in the acqui-sition or increase of a corporate asset, . . . these expendituresare not, because of that fact, deductible as ordinary and nec-essary business expenses"), cert. denied, 379 U. S. 832 (1964).Nor does our statement in Lincoln Savings, 403 U. S., at354, that "the presence of an ensuing benefit that may havesome future aspect is not controlling" prohibit reliance onfuture benefit as a means of distinguishing an ordinary business expense from a capital expenditure.6 Although themere presence of an incidental future benefit--"some futureaspect"--may not warrant capitalization, a taxpayer's realization of benefits beyond the year in which the expenditureis incurred is undeniably important in determining whetherthe appropriate tax treatment is immediate deduction orcapitalization. See United States v. Mississippi ChemicalCorp., 405 U. S. 298, 310 (1972) (expense that "is of valuein more than one taxable year" is a nondeductible capitalexpenditure); Central Texas Savings & Loan Assn. v. UnitedStates, 731 F. 2d 1181, 1183 (CA5 1984) ("While the period ofthe benefits may not be controlling in all cases, it nonetheless6 Petitioner contends that, absent a separate-and-distinct-asset requirement for capitalization, a taxpayer will have no "principled basis" uponwhich to differentiate business expenses from capital expenditures. Brieffor Petitioner 37-41. We note, however, that grounding tax status on theexistence of an asset would be unlikely to produce the bright-line rule thatpetitioner desires, given that the notion of an "asset" is itself flexible andamorphous. See Johnson, 53 Tax Notes, at 477-478.503us1$36F 02-24-99 09:33:28 PAGES OPINPGT88 INDOPCO, INC. v. COMMISSIONEROpinion of the Courtremains a prominent, if not predominant, characteristic of acapital item"). Indeed, the text of the Code's capitalizationprovision, $ 263(a)(1), which refers to "permanent improve-ments or betterments," itself envisions an inquiry into theduration and extent of the benefits realized by the taxpayer.IIIIn applying the foregoing principles to the specific expend-itures at issue in this case, we conclude that National Starchhas not demonstrated that the investment banking, legal, andother costs it incurred in connection with Unilever's acquisition of its shares are deductible as ordinary and necessarybusiness expenses under $ 162(a).Although petitioner attempts to dismiss the benefits thataccrued to National Starch from the Unilever acquisition as"entirely speculative" or "merely incidental," Brief for Peti-tioner 39-40, the Tax Court's and the Court of Appeals' findings that the transaction produced significant benefits to Na-tional Starch that extended beyond the tax year in questionare amply supported by the record. For example, in com-menting on the merger with Unilever, National Starch's 1978"Progress Report" observed that the company would "bene-fit greatly from the availability of Unilever's enormous resources, especially in the area of basic technology." App. 43.See also id., at 46 (Unilever "provides new opportunitiesand resources"). Morgan Stanley's report to the NationalStarch board concerning the fairness to shareholders of apossible business combination with Unilever noted that Na-tional Starch management "feels that some synergy mayexist with the Unilever organization given a) the nature ofthe Unilever chemical, paper, plastics and packaging operations . . . and b) the strong consumer products orientation ofUnilever United States, Inc."Id., at 77-78.In addition to these anticipated resource-related benefits,National Starch obtained benefits through its transformationfrom a publicly held, freestanding corporation into a wholly503us1$36F 02-24-99 09:33:28 PAGES OPINPGT89Cite as: 503 U.

See 93 T.

The factthat the expenditures do not create or enhance a separateand distinct additi onal asset is not controlling; theacquisition-related expenses bear the indicia of capital expenditures and are to be treated as such.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.
