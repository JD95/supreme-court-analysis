On his 1979 income tax return, petitioner, a shareholder ina Subchapter S corporation, claimed as "pass-through" itemsportions of a deduction and a tax credit reported on the cor-poration's return. The question presented is whether the3-year period in which the Internal Revenue Service is per-mitted to assess petitioner's tax liability runs from the filingdate of the individual return or the corporate return. Weconclude with the Tax Court and the Court of Appeals forthe Second Circuit that the relevant date is that on whichpetitioner's return was filed.ISubchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U. S.

C. $$ 1374, 1378.Petitioner was treasurer and a shareholder of Compo Financial Services, Inc., an S corporation. On February 1,1980, Compo filed a return for the tax year of December 26,1978, to November 30, 1979, as required by $ 6037(a) of theCode.2 On that return, Compo reported a loss deductionand an investment tax credit arising from its partnershipinterest in a venture known as Printers Associates. Petitioner and his wife filed a joint return for 1979 on April 15,1980.3 Their return claimed a pro rata share of the deduction and credit reported by Compo pursuant to the passthrough provisions of Subchapter S.Code $ 6501(a) establishes a generally applicable statute oflimitations providing that the Internal Revenue Service mayassess tax deficiencies within a 3-year period from the date1 Subchapter S was substantially amended and recodified by the Subchapter S Revision Act of 1982, 96 Stat. 1669. The pass-through provisions in effect in the period relevant to this case, see 26 U. S.

Return of S corporation"(a) In general"Every S corporation shall make a return for each taxable year, statingspecifically the items of its gross income and the deductions allowable bysubtitle A [and other information]. Any return filed pursuant to this section shall, for purposes of chapter 66 (relating to limitations), be treatedas a return filed by the corporation under section 6012."3 Phyllis Bufferd settled separately with the Commissioner and is not aparty to this action.506us2$24Z 08-22-96 21:26:16 PAGES OPINPGT526 BUFFERD v.

In March 1983, beforethree years had passed from the time the joint return wasfiled, petitioner agreed to extend the period in which deficiencies arising from certain claims on the return could beassessed against him. No extension was obtained fromCompo with respect to its return for the 1978-1979 tax year.In 1987, the Commissioner determined that the loss deduction and credit reported by Compo were erroneous and senta notice of deficiency to petitioner based on the loss deduction and credit that he had claimed on his return. In theTax Court, petitioner contended that the Commissioner'sclaim was time barred because the disallowance was basedon an error in Compo's return, for which the 3-year assessment period had lapsed. The Tax Court found for the Com-missioner, relying on its decision in Fehlhaber v. Commissioner, 94 T. C. 863 (1990), aff 'd, 954 F. 2d 653 (CA11 1992).See App. 61.

S. 523 (1993)Opinion of the Courtyears after the return was filed . . . ." The issue before usis whether "the" return is that of petitioner or that of thecorporation which was the source of the loss and creditclaimed on petitioner's return. Petitioner's position is thatthe Commissioner had three years from the date his returnwas filed to object to that return in any respect except theloss and credit items passed through to him by the corpora-tion. To disallow those items, petitioner argues, the Commissioner must have acted within three years of the filingof the corporate return. Under this approach, "the" returnreferred to in $ 6501(a) becomes two returns, and petitionerclaims that there is adequate statutory basis for his submission. We have no doubt that the courts below properly con-cluded, as the Commissioner argued, that it is the filing ofpetitioner's return that triggers the running of the statu-tory period.The Commissioner can only determine whether the tax-payer understated his tax obligation and should be assesseda deficiency after examining that taxpayer's return. Plainly,then, "the" return referred to in $ 6501(a) is the return of thetaxpayer against whom a deficiency is assessed. Here, theCommissioner sought to assess taxes which petitioner owedunder the Code because his return had erroneously reporteda loss and credit to which he was not entitled. The fact thatthe corporation's return erroneously asserted a loss andcredit to be passed through to its shareholders is of no consequence. In this case, the errors on the corporate return didnot and could not affect the tax liability of the corporation,and hence the Commissioner could only assess a deficiencyagainst the stockholder-taxpayer whose return claimed thebenefit of the errors. Under the plain language of $ 6501(a),the Commissioner's time to make the assessment ran fromthe filing date of petitioner's return.66 Even if it could credibly be argued that $ 6501(a) is ambiguous becauseit does not expressly indicate how it is to be applied to S corporationsand their stockholders, the Commissioner's construction of the section is506us2$24Z 08-22-96 21:26:16 PAGES OPINPGT528 BUFFERD v. COMMISSIONEROpinion of the CourtBy contrast, the S corporation's return, which petitionerasserts triggers the beginning of the limitations period, isdeficient precisely because it does not contain all of the in-formation necessary to compute a shareholder's taxes. Ifthe Internal Revenue Service were required to rely on thatreturn, it would be forced to conduct its assessment onthe basis of incomplete information:"While [the corporate return] may show petitioner's dis-tributive share of losses, it does not indicate his adjustedbasis in his corporate stock, which is information neces-sary to determine if the loss is deductible. Nor does itshow petitioner's income, losses, deductions, and creditsfrom other sources. Moreover, the information returnof the S corporation does not relate to the same taxableperiod as petitioner's return . . . ."Fehlhaber, supra,at 869 (citation omitted).As noted in analogous cases, tax returns that "lack the datanecessary for the computation and assessment of deficiencies" generally should not be regarded as triggering the pe-riod of assessment.Automobile Club of Mich. v. Commissioner, 353 U. S. 180, 188 (1957) (citing Commissioner v.Lane-Wells Co., 321 U. S. 219 (1944)).7Petitioner asserts that $ 6501(a) supports a contrary viewwhen read in light of two related Code provisions pertaininga reasonable one to say the least, and we should accept it absent convincing grounds for rejecting it. As noted in Badaracco v. Commissioner,464 U. S. 386 (1984), " `limitations statutes barring the collection of taxesotherwise due and unpaid are strictly construed in favor of the Government.' " Id., at 392 (quoting Lucia v. United States, 474 F. 2d 565, 570(CA5 1973)).7 In these circumstances, the incompleteness of the corporate return provides a reason for doubting petitioner's understanding of the Code. Wedo not thereby suggest that, for cases in which a corporate return doessupply all of the information necessary to process a shareholder's return,the mere fact of completeness is sufficient to establish the corporate returnas "the" return of $ 6501(a).506us2$24Z 08-22-96 21:26:16 PAGES OPINPGT529Cite as: 506 U. S. 523 (1993)Opinion of the Courtto S corporations. Section 6012(a)(2) requires both Sub-chapter C and Subchapter S corporations to file income taxreturns.8 Section 6037(a) specifies the information that eachS corporation's return must provide (including "each shareholder's pro rata share of each item of the corporation") andfurther states that "[a]ny return filed pursuant to this sectionshall, for purposes of [26 U. S. C. $$ 6501-6531], be treated asa return filed by the corporation under section 6012."We do not see that these provisions aid petitioner's cause.Read together, $$ 6012(a)(2), 6037(a), and 6501(a) establishonly that each S corporation must file a tax return containingcertain information and that a Commissioner desiring tomake an assessment must act within three years of filing.Nothing on the face of these provisions demonstrates that anindividual's income tax return is brought within the compassof $ 6037(a)'s reference to "any return" simply because a portion of that return reports income and losses that havepassed through from the return of an S corporation. If anything, the phrase "[a]ny return filed pursuant to this sec-tion," coupled with the fact that $ 6037(a) is concerned withdescribing the contents of the corporation's return, indicatesthat the provision isnot meant to determine when the as-sessment period for a shareholder's individual tax returnbegins.Petitioner argues that this reading of the relevant provisions runs afoul of the fact that, prior to 1966, S corporationswere not subject to taxation. According to petitioner, nopurpose would have been served by establishing an assess-ment period that applied to returns reporting corporate income on which no taxes could be assessed but not to the8 Section 6012(a)(2) reads:"$ 6012.

COMMISSIONEROpinion of the Courtreturns of corporate stockholders. This argument fails be-cause even in the period when the S corporation could notbe taxed, examination of a corporation's return was neces-sary to determine if it could lay valid claim to Subchapter Sstatus. Section 6037(a) thus originally functioned to set thestarting date of the 3-year period within which that determination had to be made. See United States v. Adams Building Co., 531 F. 2d 342, 343, n. 2 (CA6 1976); see also 952 F.2d, at 677 (citing Fehlhaber v. Commissioner, 94 T. C. 863(1990)).9 Petitioner maintains that such a function would besuperfluous because, if the election of S corporation statuswere found invalid, the corporation's return would "automat-ically be subject to the existing rules for C corporations."Brief for Petitioner 38. But this proposition is hardly self-evident, and petitioner cites no authority to support it. Inthe absence of $ 6037(a), the Internal Revenue Service couldclaim that a corporation which files a return containing anerroneous election of Subchapter S status has failed to fileany return, which would allow the Service to issue a noticeof deficiency with respect to the return "at any time." See$ 6501(c)(3); cf.Germantown Trust Co. v. Commissioner, 309U. S. 304, 307 (1940); Mason v. United States, 801 F. Supp.718, 721 (ND Ga. 1992).109 Since S corporations are now subject to limited taxation, $ 6037(a)serves the additional function of determining the assessment period forthose taxes. See 952 F. 2d, at 678.10 Petitioner's reading of $ 6037(a) is sufficiently lacking in textual support to obviate any need to examine legislative history. However, severalcourts have noted that the history of $ 6037 contains evidence in supportof the Commissioner's interpretation. See, e. g., Green v. Commissioner,963 F. 2d, at 788-790; Fehlhaber v. Commissioner, 954 F. 2d, at 656-657.Section 6037(a) was introduced in the Technical Amendments Act of 1958,72 Stat. 1606, 1656. The Senate Report explaining the provision states:"Notwithstanding the fact that an electing small-business corporation isnot subject to the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the 1954 Code, such corporation must make a return for each taxable year in accordance with newsection 6037 . . . .

S. 523 (1993)Opinion of the CourtThe Ninth Circuit's rejection in Kelley v. Commissioner,877 F. 2d 756 (1989), of the view adopted by the Commissioner was prompted in part by a concern to avoid unfairlytions. Thus, for example, the period of limitation on assessment and collection of any corporate tax found to be due upon a subsequent determination that the corporation was not entitled to the benefits of subchapter S,will run from the date of filing of the return required under the new section 6037." S. Rep. No. 1983, 85th Cong., 2d Sess., 226 (1958).Although the passage would seem to support the Commissioner's view,petitioner, following the reasoning of the Ninth Circuit in Kelley v. Commissioner, 877 F. 2d 756 (1989), maintains that the phrase "for example"necessarily implies that the Senate also had in mind the present case.This implication is hardly necessary: The phrase just as easily could havebeen meant to avoid foreclosing other applications of $ 6037(a) to corporatereturns. Indeed, had "for example" been omitted, the Commissionercould now rely on this passage to argue that the period for assessing capital gains taxes under 26 U. S. C. $ 1374 is not controlled by $ 6037(a), butis instead governed by the filing date of a shareholder's return or someother triggering event. Likewise, in the absence of the phrase, it couldbe argued that, because the legislative history refers exclusively to a casein which taxes are assessed against a corporation that erroneously claimsSubchapter S status, the period in which penalties may be assessedagainst the corporation should not be governed by $ 6037(a).The Commissioner claims additional support in the Senate Report accompanying the 1982 amendments to Subchapter S, which states in relevant part:"Under present law, a taxpayer's individual tax liability is determinedin proceedings between the Internal Revenue Service and the individualwhose tax liability is in dispute. Thus, any issues involving the incomeor deductions of a subchapter S corporation are determined separately in. . . proceedings involving the individual shareholder whose tax liability isaffected. Statutes of limitations apply at the individual level, based onthe returns filed by the individual. The filing by the corporation of itsreturn does not affect the statute of limitations applicable to the shareholders." S. Rep. No. 97-640, p. 25 (1982).This passage is of little value to either side. While the views of a Congress engaged in the amendment of existing law as to the intent behindthat law are "entitled to significant weight," Seatrain Shipbuilding Corp.v. Shell Oil Co., 444 U. S. 572, 596 (1980), in this instance, the Report'saccount of "present law" may have been colored, if not wholly determined,by the Tax Court, which had already adopted the view espoused by the506us2$24Z 08-22-96 21:26:16 PAGES OPINPGT532 BUFFERD v.

The Fifth Circuit's opinionby Judge Goldberg in Green v. Commissioner, 963 F. 2d 783(1992), neatly summarizes the appropriate response to thatconcern:"First, it is not unfamiliar in the world of tax to have `anindividual's income tax return . . . dependent on recordsmaintained by another entity.'

See [cases involving partnerships, trusts, andS corporations]." Lardas v. Commissioner, 99 T.

UNITED STATEScertiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe seventh circuitNo. 91-6824. Argued November 2, 1992--Decided January 25, 1993Petitioners were indicted on federal drug charges and brought to trialtogether pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 8(b), whichprovides that defendants may be charged together "if they are allegedto have participated . . . in the same series of acts or transactions constituting . . . offenses." At various points during the proceeding, theyeach argued that their defenses were mutually antagonistic and movedfor severance under Rule 14, which specifies that, "[i]f it appears that adefendant or the government is prejudiced by a joinder of . . . defendants . . . for trial . . . , the court may order an election or separate trialsof counts, grant a severance of defendants or provide whatever reliefjustice requires." The District Court denied the motions, and eachpetitioner was convicted of various offenses. Although acknowledgingother lower court cases saying that a severance is required when defendants present "mutually antagonistic defenses," the Court of Appealsfound that petitioners had not suffered prejudice and affirmed the denialof severance.Held: Rule 14 does not require severance as a matter of law when codefendants present "mutually exclusive defenses." While the Rule recognizes that joinder, even when proper under Rule 8(b), may prejudiceeither a defendant or the Government, it does not make mutually exclusive defenses prejudicial per se or require severance whenever prejudiceis shown. Rather, severance should be granted only if there is a seriousrisk that a joint trial would compromise a specific trial right of a properly joined defendant or prevent the jury from making a reliable judgment about guilt or innocence. The risk of prejudice will vary with thefacts in each case, and the Rule leaves determination of the risk, andthe tailoring of any necessary remedy, to the sound discretion of thedistrict courts. Although separate trials will more likely be necessarywhen the risk is high, less drastic measures, such as limiting instructions, often will suffice. Because petitioners, who rely on an insupportable bright-line rule, have not shown that their joint trial subjectedthem to any legally cognizable prejudice, the District Court did notabuse its discretion in denying their motions to sever. Moreover, evenif there were some risk of prejudice, here it is of the type that can506us2$25Z 08-22-96 21:27:25 PAGES OPINPGT535Cite as: 506 U.

Rule 14 of the Rules, in turn, permitsa district court to grant a severance of defendants if "itappears that a defendant or the government is prejudicedby a joinder." In this case, we consider whether Rule 14requires severance as a matter of law when codefendantspresent "mutually antagonistic defenses."IGloria Zafiro, Jose Martinez, Salvador Garcia, and AlfonsoSoto were accused of distributing illegal drugs in the Chicago area, operating primarily out of Soto's bungalow inChicago and Zafiro's apartment in Cicero, a nearby suburb.One day, Government agents observed Garcia and Soto placea large box in Soto's car and drive from Soto's bungalow toZafiro's apartment. The agents followed the two as theycarried the box up the stairs. When the agents identified506us2$25Z 08-22-96 21:27:25 PAGES OPINPGT536 ZAFIRO v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtthemselves, Garcia and Soto dropped the box and ran intothe apartment. The agents entered the apartment in pursuit and found the four petitioners in the living room. Thedropped box contained 55 pounds of cocaine. After obtaining a search warrant for the apartment, agents found approximately 16 pounds of cocaine, 25 grams of heroin, and 4pounds of marijuana inside a suitcase in a closet. Next tothe suitcase was a sack containing $22,960 in cash. Policeofficers also discovered 7 pounds of cocaine in a car parkedin Soto's garage.The four petitioners were indicted and brought to trial together. At various points during the proceeding, Garcia andSoto moved for severance, arguing that their defenses weremutually antagonistic. Soto testified that he knew nothingabout the drug conspiracy. He claimed that Garcia hadasked him for a box, which he gave Garcia, and that he (Soto)did not know its contents until they were arrested. Garciadid not testify, but his lawyer argued that Garcia was innocent: The box belonged to Soto and Garcia was ignorant ofits contents.Zafiro and Martinez also repeatedly moved for severanceon the ground that their defenses were mutually antagonistic. Zafiro testified that she was merely Martinez's girlfriend and knew nothing of the conspiracy. She claimed thatMartinez stayed in her apartment occasionally, kept someclothes there, and gave her small amounts of money. Although she allowed Martinez to store a suitcase in her closet,she testified, she had no idea that the suitcase contained illegal drugs. Like Garcia, Martinez did not testify. But hislawyer argued that Martinez was only visiting his girlfriendand had no idea that she was involved in distributing drugs.The District Court denied the motions for severance.

Garcia, Soto, andMartinez claimed that the District Court abused its discretion in denying their motions to sever. (Zafiro did not ap-peal the denial of her severance motion, and thus, her claimis not properly before this Court.) The Court of Appealsfor the Seventh Circuit acknowledged that "a vast numberof cases say that a defendant is entitled to a severance whenthe `defendants present mutually antagonistic defenses' inthe sense that `the acceptance of one party's defense pre-cludes the acquittal of the other defendant.' " 945 F. 2d 881,885 (1991) (quoting United States v. Keck, 773 F. 2d 759, 765(CA7 1985)). Noting that "mutual antagonism . . . and other. . . characterizations of the effort of one defendant to shiftthe blame from himself to a codefendant neither control norilluminate the question of severance," 945 F. 2d, at 886, theCourt of Appeals found that the defendants had not sufferedprejudice and affirmed the District Court's denial of sever-ance. We granted the petition for certiorari, 503 U. S. 935(1992), and now affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.IIRule 8(b) states that "[t]wo or more defendants may becharged in the same indictment or information if they arealleged to have participated in the same act or transactionor in the same series of acts or transactions constituting anoffense or offenses." There is a preference in the federalsystem for joint trials of defendants who are indicted together. Joint trials "play a vital role in the criminal justicesystem."Richardson v. Marsh, 481 U. S. 200, 209 (1987).They promote efficiency and "serve the interests of justiceby avoiding the scandal and inequity of inconsistent ver-dicts." Id., at 210. For these reasons, we repeatedly haveapproved of joint trials. See ibid.; Opper v. United States,348 U. S. 84, 95 (1954); United States v. Marchant, 12 Wheat.506us2$25Z 08-22-96 21:27:25 PAGES OPINPGT538 ZAFIRO v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Court480 (1827); cf. 1 C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure$ 223 (2d ed. 1982) (citing lower court opinions to the sameeffect). But Rule 14 recognizes that joinder, even whenproper under Rule 8(b), may prejudice either a defendant orthe Government. Thus, the Rule provides:"If it appears that a defendant or the government isprejudiced by a joinder of . . . defendants . . . for trialtogether, the court may order an election or separatetrials of counts, grant a severance of defendants or pro-vide whatever other relief justice requires."In interpreting Rule 14, the Courts of Appeals frequentlyhave expressed the view that "mutually antagonistic" or "irreconcilable" defenses may be so prejudicial in some circum-stances as to mandate severance. See,e. g., United States v.Benton, 852 F. 2d 1456, 1469 (CA6), cert. denied, 488 U. S.993 (1988); United States v. Smith, 788 F. 2d 663, 668 (CA101986);Keck, supra, at 765; United States v. Magdaniel-Mora,746 F. 2d 715, 718 (CA11 1984); United States v. Berkowitz,662 F. 2d 1127, 1133-1134 (CA5 1981);United States v. Haldeman, 181 U. S. App. D. C. 254, 294-295, 559 F. 2d 31, 71-72(1976), cert. denied, 431 U. S. 933 (1977). Notwithstanding such assertions, the courts have reversed relatively fewconvictions for failure to grant a severance on grounds ofmutually antagonistic or irreconcilable defenses. See, e. g.,United States v. Tootick, 952 F. 2d 1078 (CA9 1991); UnitedStates v. Rucker, 915 F. 2d 1511, 1512-1513 (CA11 1990);United States v. Romanello, 726 F. 2d 173 (CA5 1984). Thelow rate of reversal may reflect the inability of defendantsto prove a risk of prejudice in most cases involving conflicting defenses.Nevertheless, petitioners urge us to adopt a bright-linerule, mandating severance whenever codefendants have conflicting defenses. See Brief for Petitioners i. We decline todo so. Mutually antagonistic defenses are not prejudicialper se. Moreover, Rule 14 does not require severance even506us2$25Z 08-22-96 21:27:25 PAGES OPINPGT539Cite as: 506 U. S. 534 (1993)Opinion of the Courtif prejudice is shown; rather, it leaves the tailoring of therelief to be granted, if any, to the district court's sound discretion. See, e. g., United States v. Lane, 474 U. S. 438, 449,n. 12 (1986);Opper, supra, at 95.We believe that, when defendants properly have beenjoined under Rule 8(b), a district court should grant a sever-ance under Rule 14 only if there is a serious risk that a jointtrial would compromise a specific trial right of one of thedefendants, or prevent the jury from making a reliable judgment about guilt or innocence. Such a risk might occurwhen evidence that the jury should not consider against adefendant and that would not be admissible if a defendantwere tried alone is admitted against a codefendant. For example, evidence of a codefendant's wrongdoing in some circumstances erroneously could lead a jury to conclude thata defendant was guilty. When many defendants are triedtogether in a complex case and they have markedly differentdegrees of culpability, this risk of prejudice is heightened.See Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U. S. 750, 774-775 (1946).Evidence that is probative of a defendant's guilt but technically admissible only against a codefendant also might present a risk of prejudice. See Bruton v. United States, 391U. S. 123 (1968). Conversely, a defendant might suffer prejudice if essential exculpatory evidence that would be available to a defendant tried alone were unavailable in a jointtrial. See, e. g., Tifford v. Wainwright, 588 F. 2d 954 (CA51979) (per curiam). The risk of prejudice will vary withthe facts in each case, and district courts may find prejudicein situations not discussed here. When the risk of prejudiceis high, a district court is more likely to determine that separate trials are necessary, but, as we indicated in Richardsonv. Marsh, less drastic measures, such as limiting instructions,often will suffice to cure any risk of prejudice. See 481U. S., at 211.Turning to the facts of this case, we note that petitionersdo not articulate any specific instances of prejudice. In506us2$25Z 08-22-96 21:27:25 PAGES OPINPGT540 ZAFIRO v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtstead they contend that the very nature of their defenses,without more, prejudiced them. Their theory is that whentwo defendants both claim they are innocent and each ac-cuses the other of the crime, a jury will conclude (1) that bothdefendants are lying and convict them both on that basis, or(2) that at least one of the two must be guilty without regardto whether the Government has proved its case beyond areasonable doubt.As to the first contention, it is well settled that defendantsare not entitled to severance merely because they may havea better chance of acquittal in separate trials. See,e. g.,United States v. Martinez, 922 F. 2d 914, 922 (CA1 1991);United States v. Manner, 281 U. S. App. D. C. 89, 98, 887F. 2d 317, 324 (1989), cert. denied, 493 U. S. 1062 (1990).Rules 8(b) and 14 are designed "to promote economy andefficiency and to avoid a multiplicity of trials, [so long as]these objectives can be achieved without substantial prejudice to the right of the defendants to a fair trial." Bruton,391 U. S., at 131, n. 6 (internal quotation marks omitted).While "[a]n important element of a fair trial is that a juryconsider only relevant and competent evidence bearing onthe issue of guilt or innocence," ibid. (emphasis added), afair trial does not include the right to exclude relevant andcompetent evidence. A defendant normally would not beentitled to exclude the testimony of a former codefendant ifthe district court did sever their trials, and we see no reasonwhy relevant and competent testimony would be prejudicialmerely because the witness is also a codefendant.As to the second contention, the short answer is that petitioners' scenario simply did not occur here. The Government argued that all four petitioners were guilty and offeredsufficient evidence as to all four petitioners; the jury in turnfound all four petitioners guilty of various offenses. Moreover, even if there were some risk of prejudice, here it is ofthe type that can be cured with proper instructions, and "juries are presumed to follow their instructions."

The District Court properly instructedthe jury that the Government had "the burden of provingbeyond a reasonable doubt" that each defendant committedthe crimes with which he or she was charged. Tr. 864. Thecourt then instructed the jury that it must "give separateconsideration to each individual defendant and to each sepa-rate charge against him. Each defendant is entitled to havehis or her case determined from his or her own conduct andfrom the evidence [that] may be applicable to him or to her."Id., at 865. In addition, the District Court admonished thejury that opening and closing arguments are not evidenceand that it should draw no inferences from a defendant'sexercise of the right to silence.Id., at 862-864. Theseinstructions sufficed to cure any possibility of prejudice.See Schaffer v. United States, 362 U. S. 511, 516 (1960).Rule 14 leaves the determination of risk of prejudice andany remedy that may be necessary to the sound discretionof the district courts. Because petitioners have not shownthat their joint trial subjected them to any legally cognizableprejudice, we conclude that the District Court did not abuseits discretion in denying petitioners' motions to sever. Thejudgment of the Court of Appeals is
