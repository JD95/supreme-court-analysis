The issue in this case is whether the trade dress 1 of arestaurant may be protected under $ 43(a) of the TrademarkAct of 1946 (Lanham Act), 60 Stat. 441, 15 U. S. C. $ 1125(a)*Arthur M.

Taco Cabana's trade dress may include the shapeand general appearance of the exterior of the restaurant, the identifyingsign, the interior kitchen floor plan, the decor, the menu, the equipmentused to serve food, the servers' uniforms and other features reflecting onthe total image of the restaurant." 1 App. 83-84. The Court of Appealsaccepted this definition and quoted from Blue Bell Bio-Medical v.

S. 763 (1992)Opinion of the Court(1982 ed.), based on a finding of inherent distinctiveness,without proof that the trade dress has secondary meaning.IRespondent Taco Cabana, Inc., operates a chain of fast-food restaurants in Texas. The restaurants serve Mexicanfood. The first Taco Cabana restaurant was opened in SanAntonio in September 1978, and five more restaurants hadbeen opened in San Antonio by 1985. Taco Cabana de-scribes its Mexican trade dress as"a festive eating atmosphere having interior dining andpatio areas decorated with artifacts, bright colors, paintings and murals. The patio includes interior and exte-rior areas with the interior patio capable of being sealedoff from the outside patio by overhead garage doors.The stepped exterior of the building is a festive andvivid color scheme using top border paint and neonstripes. Bright awnings and umbrellas continue thetheme." 932 F. 2d 1113, 1117 (CA5 1991).In December 1985, a Two Pesos, Inc., restaurant wasopened in Houston. Two Pesos adopted a motif very similarto the foregoing description of Taco Cabana's trade dress.Two Pesos restaurants expanded rapidly in Houston andother markets, but did not enter San Antonio. In 1986, TacoCabana entered the Houston and Austin markets and expanded into other Texas cities, including Dallas and El Pasowhere Two Pesos was also doing business.In 1987, Taco Cabana sued Two Pesos in the United StatesDistrict Court for the Southern District of Texas for tradedress infringement under $ 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15U. S. C. $ 1125(a) (1982 ed.),2 and for theft of trade secrets2 Section 43(a) provides: "Any person who shall affix, apply, or annex, oruse in connection with any goods or services, or any container or containers for goods, a false designation of origin, or any false description orrepresentation, including words or other symbols tending falsely to de505US3114D 07-09-96 12:05:24 PAGES OPINPGT766 TWO PESOS, INC. v. TACO CABANA, INC.Opinion of the Courtunder Texas common law. The case was tried to a jury,which was instructed to return its verdict in the form ofanswers to five questions propounded by the trial judge.The jury's answers were: Taco Cabana has a trade dress;taken as a whole, the trade dress is nonfunctional; the tradedress is inherently distinctive;3 the trade dress has not acquired a secondary meaning 4 in the Texas market; and thealleged infringement creates a likelihood of confusion on thepart of ordinary customers as to the source or association ofthe restaurant's goods or services. Because, as the jury wastold, Taco Cabana's trade dress was protected if it either wasinherently distinctive or had acquired a secondary meaning,judgment was entered awarding damages to Taco Cabana.In the course of calculating damages, the trial court held thatTwo Pesos had intentionally and deliberately infringed TacoCabana's trade dress.5scribe or represent the same, and shall cause such goods or services toenter into commerce, and any person who shall with knowledge of thefalsity of such designation of origin or description or representation causeor procure the same to be transported or used in commerce or deliver thesame to any carrier to be transported or used, shall be liable to a civilaction by any person doing business in the locality falsely indicated as thatof origin or in the region in which said locality is situated, or by any personwho believes that he is or is likely to be damaged by the use of any suchfalse description or representation." 60 Stat. 441.This provision has been superseded by $ 132 of the Trademark Law Revision Act of 1988, 102 Stat. 3946, 15 U. S. C. $ 1121.3 The instructions were that, to be found inherently distinctive, the tradedress must not be descriptive.4 Secondary meaning is used generally to indicate that a mark or dress"has come through use to be uniquely associated with a specific source."Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition $ 13, Comment e (Tent.

S. 763 (1992)Opinion of the CourtThe Court of Appeals ruled that the instructions ade-quately stated the applicable law and that the evidencesupported the jury's findings. In particular, the Court ofAppeals rejected petitioner's argument that a finding ofno secondary meaning contradicted a finding of inherentdistinctiveness.In so holding, the court below followed precedent in theFifth Circuit. InChevron Chemical Co. v. Voluntary Pur-chasing Groups, Inc., 659 F. 2d 695, 702 (CA5 1981), the courtnoted that trademark law requires a demonstration of sec-ondary meaning only when the claimed trademark is not sufficiently distinctive of itself to identify the producer; thecourt held that the same principles should apply to protection of trade dresses. The Court of Appeals noted that thisapproach conflicts with decisions of other courts, particularlythe holding of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit inVibrant Sales, Inc. v. New Body Boutique, Inc., 652 F. 2d 299(1981), cert. denied, 455 U. S. 909 (1982), that $ 43(a) protectsunregistered trademarks or designs only where secondarymeaning is shown.Chevron, supra, at 702. We grantedcertiorari to resolve the conflict among the Courts of Appeals on the question whether trade dress that is inherentlydistinctive is protectible under $ 43(a) without a showing thatit has acquired secondary meaning.6 502 U. S. 1071 (1992).We find that it is, and we therefore affirm.IIThe Lanham Act 7 was intended to make "actionable thedeceptive and misleading use of marks" and "to protect perforeclosed several lucrative markets within Taco Cabana's natural zone ofexpansion." 932 F. 2d, at 1127, n. 20.6 We limited our grant of certiorari to the above question on which thereis a conflict. We did not grant certiorari on the second question presentedby the petition, which challenged the Court of Appeals' acceptance of thejury's finding that Taco Cabana's trade dress was not functional.7 The Lanham Act, including the provisions at issue here, has been substantially amended since the present suit was brought.

Section 43(a) "prohibits a broaderrange of practices than does $ 32," which applies to registered marks, Inwood Laboratories, Inc. v. Ives Laboratories,Inc., 456 U. S. 844, 858 (1982), but it is common ground that$ 43(a) protects qualifying unregistered trademarks and thatthe general principles qualifying a mark for registrationunder $ 2 of the Lanham Act are for the most part applicablein determining whether an unregistered mark is entitled toprotection under $ 43(a). See A. J. Canfield Co. v. Honickman, 808 F. 2d 291, 299, n. 9 (CA3 1986); Thompson MedicalCo. v. Pfizer Inc., 753 F. 2d 208, 215-216 (CA2 1985).A trademark is defined in 15 U. S. C. $ 1127 as including"any word, name, symbol, or device or any combinationthereof " used by any person "to identify and distinguish hisor her goods, including a unique product, from those manufactured or sold by others and to indicate the source of thegoods, even if that source is unknown." In order to be registered, a mark must be capable of distinguishing the applicant's goods from those of others. $ 1052. Marks are oftenclassified in categories of generally increasing distinctiveness; following the classic formulation set out by JudgeFriendly, they may be (1) generic; (2) descriptive; (3) suggestive; (4) arbitrary; or (5) fanciful. See Abercrombie & FitchCo. v. Hunting World, Inc., 537 F. 2d 4, 9 (CA2 1976). TheCourt of Appeals followed this classification and petitioneraccepts it. Brief for Petitioner 11-15. The latter three categories of marks, because their intrinsic nature serves toidentify a particular source of a product, are deemed inherently distinctive and are entitled to protection. In contrast,generic marks--those that "refe[r] to the genus of which theparticular product is a species," Park 'N Fly, Inc. v. DollarPark & Fly, Inc., 469 U. S. 189, 194 (1985), citing Abercrombie & Fitch, supra, at 9--are not registrable as trademarks.Park 'N Fly, supra, at 194.505US3114D 07-09-96 12:05:24 PAGES OPINPGT769Cite as: 505 U. S. 763 (1992)Opinion of the CourtMarks which are merely descriptive of a product are notinherently distinctive. When used to describe a product,they do not inherently identify a particular source, and hencecannot be protected. However, descriptive marks may acquire the distinctiveness which will allow them to be protected under the Act. Section 2 of the Lanham Act providesthat a descriptive mark that otherwise could not be registered under the Act may be registered if it "has become distinctive of the applicant's goods in commerce." $$ 2(e), (f ),15 U. S. C. $$ 1052(e), (f). See Park 'N Fly, supra, at 194,196. This acquired distinctiveness is generally called "secondary meaning." See ibid.; Inwood Laboratories, supra,at 851, n. 11; Kellogg Co. v. National Biscuit Co., 305 U. S.111, 118 (1938). The concept of secondary meaning has beenapplied to actions under $ 43(a). See, e. g., University ofGeorgia Athletic Assn. v. Laite, 756 F. 2d 1535 (CA11 1985);Thompson Medical Co. v.

Restatement(Third) of Unfair Competition $ 13, pp. 37-38, and Commenta (Tent. Draft No. 2, Mar. 23, 1990). Cf. Park 'N Fly, supra,at 194. It is also clear that eligibility for protection under$ 43(a) depends on nonfunctionality. See, e. g., Inwood Laboratories, supra, at 863 (White, J., concurring in result); seealso, e. g., Brunswick Corp. v. Spinit Reel Co., 832 F. 2d 513,517 (CA10 1987); First Brands Corp. v.

TACO CABANA, INC.Opinion of the Courtsupra, at 1535; First Brands, supra, at 1381; Stormy Clime,supra, at 974; American Greetings, supra, at 1141.The Court of Appeals determined that the District Court'sinstructions were consistent with the foregoing principlesand that the evidence supported the jury's verdict. Bothcourts thus ruled that Taco Cabana's trade dress was notdescriptive but rather inherently distinctive, and that it wasnot functional. None of these rulings is before us in thiscase, and for present purposes we assume, without deciding,that each of them is correct. In going on to affirm the judgment for respondent, the Court of Appeals, following itsprior decision inChevron, held that Taco Cabana's inherentlydistinctive trade dress was entitled to protection despite thelack of proof of secondary meaning. It is this issue that isbefore us for decision, and we agree with its resolution bythe Court of Appeals. There is no persuasive reason toapply to trade dress a general requirement of secondarymeaning which is at odds with the principles generally appli-cable to infringement suits under $ 43(a). Petitioner devotesmuch of its briefing to arguing issues that are not before us,and we address only its arguments relevant to whether proofof secondary meaning is essential to qualify an inherentlydistinctive trade dress for protection under $ 43(a).Petitioner argues that the jury's finding that the tradedress has not acquired a secondary meaning shows conclusively that the trade dress is not inherently distinctive.Brief for Petitioner 9. The Court of Appeals' disposition ofthis issue was sound:"Two Pesos' argument--that the jury finding of inherentdistinctiveness contradicts its finding of no secondarymeaning in the Texas market--ignores the law in thiscircuit. While the necessarily imperfect (and often prohibitively difficult) methods for assessing secondarymeaning address the empirical question of current consumer association, the legal recognition of an inherentlydistinctive trademark or trade dress acknowledges the505US3114D 07-09-96 12:05:24 PAGES OPINPGT771Cite as: 505 U. S. 763 (1992)Opinion of the Courtowner's legitimate proprietary interest in its unique andvaluable informational device, regardless of whethersubstantial consumer association yet bestows the additional empirical protection of secondary meaning." 932F. 2d, at 1120, n. 7.Although petitioner makes the above argument, it appearsto concede elsewhere in its brief that it is possible for a tradedress, even a restaurant trade dress, to be inherently distinctive and thus eligible for protection under $ 43(a). Brief forPetitioner 10-11, 17-18; Reply Brief for Petitioner 10-14.Recognizing that a general requirement of secondary meaning imposes "an unfair prospect of theft [or] financial loss" onthe developer of fanciful or arbitrary trade dress at the outset of its use, petitioner suggests that such trade dressshould receive limited protection without proof of secondarymeaning. Id., at 10. Petitioner argues that such protectionshould be only temporary and subject to defeasance whenover time the dress has failed to acquire a secondary meaning. This approach is also vulnerable for the reasons givenby the Court of Appeals. If temporary protection is available from the earliest use of the trade dress, it must bebecause it is neither functional nor descriptive, but an inherently distinctive dress that is capable of identifying a particular source of the product. Such a trade dress, or mark, isnot subject to copying by concerns that have an equal opportunity to choose their own inherently distinctive trade dress.To terminate protection for failure to gain secondary meaning over some unspecified time could not be based on thefailure of the dress to retain its fanciful, arbitrary, or suggestive nature, but on the failure of the user of the dress to besuccessful enough in the marketplace. This is not a validbasis to find a dress or mark ineligible for protection. Theuser of such a trade dress should be able to maintain whatcompetitive position it has and continue to seek wider identification among potential customers.505US3114D 07-09-96 12:05:24 PAGES OPINPGT772 TWO PESOS, INC. v. TACO CABANA, INC.Opinion of the CourtThis brings us to the line of decisions by the Court of Ap-peals for the Second Circuit that would find protection fortrade dress unavailable absent proof of secondary meaning,a position that petitioner concedes would have to be modifiedif the temporary protection that it suggests is to be recognized. Brief for Petitioner 10-14. In Vibrant Sales, Inc. v.New Body Boutique, Inc., 652 F. 2d 299 (1981), the plaintiffclaimed protection under $ 43(a) for a product whose featuresthe defendant had allegedly copied. The Court of Appealsheld that unregistered marks did not enjoy the "presumptivesource association" enjoyed by registered marks and hencecould not qualify for protection under $ 43(a) without proof ofsecondary meaning. Id., at 303, 304. The court's rationaleseemingly denied protection for unregistered, but inherentlydistinctive, marks of all kinds, whether the claimed markused distinctive words or symbols or distinctive product design. The court thus did not accept the arguments that anunregistered mark was capable of identifying a source andthat copying such a mark could be making any kind of a falsestatement or representation under $ 43(a).This holding is in considerable tension with the provisionsof the Lanham Act. If a verbal or symbolic mark or thefeatures of a product design may be registered under $ 2, itnecessarily is a mark "by which the goods of the applicantmay be distinguished from the goods of others," 60 Stat. 428,and must be registered unless otherwise disqualified. Since$ 2 requires secondary meaning only as a condition to registering descriptive marks, there are plainly marks that areregistrable without showing secondary meaning. Thesesame marks, even if not registered, remain inherently capable of distinguishing the goods of the users of these marks.Furthermore, the copier of such a mark may be seen asfalsely claiming that his products may for some reason bethought of as originating from the plaintiff.Some years after Vibrant, the Second Circuit announcedin Thompson Medical Co. v. Pfizer Inc., 753 F. 2d 208 (1985),505US3114D 07-09-96 12:05:24 PAGES OPINPGT773Cite as: 505 U. S. 763 (1992)Opinion of the Courtthat in deciding whether an unregistered mark is eligible forprotection under $ 43(a), it would follow the classification ofmarks set out by Judge Friendly in Abercrombie & Fitch,537 F. 2d, at 9. Hence, if an unregistered mark is deemedmerely descriptive, which the verbal mark before the courtproved to be, proof of secondary meaning is required; how-ever, "[s]uggestive marks are eligible for protection withoutany proof of secondary meaning, since the connection be-tween the mark and the source is presumed." 753 F. 2d, at216. The Second Circuit has nevertheless continued to denyprotection for trade dress under $ 43(a) absent proof of secondary meaning, despite the fact that $ 43(a) provides nobasis for distinguishing between trademark and trade dress.See, e. g., Stormy Clime Ltd. v. ProGroup, Inc., 809 F. 2d, at974; Union Mfg. Co. v. Han Baek Trading Co., 763 F. 2d 42,48 (1985); LeSportsac, Inc. v. K mart Corp., 754 F. 2d 71,75 (1985).The Fifth Circuit was quite right in Chevron, and in thiscase, to follow the Abercrombie classifications consistentlyand to inquire whether trade dress for which protection isclaimed under $ 43(a) is inherently distinctive. If it is, it iscapable of identifying products or services as coming from aspecific source and secondary meaning is not required. Thisis the rule generally applicable to trademarks, and the protection of trademarks and trade dress under $ 43(a) servesthe same statutory purpose of preventing deception and unfair competition. There is no persuasive reason to apply different analysis to the two. The "proposition that secondarymeaning must be shown even if the trade dress is a distinctive, identifying mark, [is] wrong, for the reasons explainedby Judge Rubin for the Fifth Circuit in Chevron." BlauPlumbing, Inc. v. S. O. S. Fix-It, Inc., 781 F. 2d 604, 608 (CA71986). The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit alsofollows Chevron, Ambrit, Inc. v. Kraft, Inc., 805 F. 2d 974,979 (1986), and the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuitappears to think that proof of secondary meaning is super505US3114D 07-09-96 12:05:24 PAGES OPINPGT774 TWO PESOS, INC. v. TACO CABANA, INC.Opinion of the Courtfluous if a trade dress is inherently distinctive, Fuddruckers,Inc. v. Doc's B. R. Others, Inc., 826 F. 2d 837, 843 (1987).It would be a different matter if there were textual basisin $ 43(a) for treating inherently distinctive verbal or symbolic trademarks differently from inherently distinctivetrade dress. But there is none. The section does not mention trademarks or trade dress, whether they be called generic, descriptive, suggestive, arbitrary, fanciful, or functional. Nor does the concept of secondary meaning appearin the text of $ 43(a). Where secondary meaning doesappear in the statute, 15 U. S. C. $ 1052 (1982 ed.), it is arequirement that applies only to merely descriptive marksand not to inherently distinctive ones. We see no basis forrequiring secondary meaning for inherently distinctive tradedress protection under $ 43(a) but not for other distinctivewords, symbols, or devices capable of identifying a producer's product.Engrafting onto $ 43(a) a requirement of secondary meaning for inherently distinctive trade dress also would undermine the purposes of the Lanham Act. Protection of tradedress, no less than of trademarks, serves the Act's purposeto "secure to the owner of the mark the goodwill of his business and to protect the ability of consumers to distinguishamong competing producers. National protection of trademarks is desirable, Congress concluded, because trademarksfoster competition and the maintenance of quality by securing to the producer the benefits of good reputation." Park'N Fly, 469 U. S., at 198, citing S. Rep. No. 1333, 79th Cong.,2d Sess., 3-5 (1946) (citations omitted). By making moredifficult the identification of a producer with its product, asecondary meaning requirement for a nondescriptive tradedress would hinder improving or maintaining the producer'scompetitive position.Suggestions that under the Fifth Circuit's law, the initialuser of any shape or design would cut off competition from505US3114D 07-09-96 12:05:25 PAGES OPINPGT775Cite as: 505 U. S. 763 (1992)Opinion of the Courtproducts of like design and shape are not persuasive. Onlynonfunctional, distinctive trade dress is protected under$ 43(a). The Fifth Circuit holds that a design is legally functional, and thus unprotectible, if it is one of a limited numberof equally efficient options available to competitors and freecompetition would be unduly hindered by according the design trademark protection. See Sicilia Di R. Biebow & Co.v. Cox, 732 F. 2d 417, 426 (1984). This serves to assure thatcompetition will not be stifled by the exhaustion of a limitednumber of trade dresses.On the other hand, adding a secondary meaning requirement could have anticompetitive effects, creating particularburdens on the startup of small companies. It would present special difficulties for a business, such as respondent,that seeks to start a new product in a limited area and thenexpand into new markets. Denying protection for inherently distinctive nonfunctional trade dress until after secondary meaning has been established would allow a competitor,which has not adopted a distinctive trade dress of its own,to appropriate the originator's dress in other markets and todeter the originator from expanding into and competing inthese areas.As noted above, petitioner concedes that protecting an inherently distinctive trade dress from its inception may becritical to new entrants to the market and that withholdingprotection until secondary meaning has been establishedwould be contrary to the goals of the Lanham Act. Petitioner specifically suggests, however, that the solution is todispense with the requirement of secondary meaning for areasonable, but brief, period at the outset of the use of atrade dress. Reply Brief for Petitioner 11-12. If $ 43(a)does not require secondary meaning at the outset of a business' adoption of trade dress, there is no basis in the statuteto support the suggestion that such a requirement comes intobeing after some unspecified time.505US3114D 07-09-96 12:05:25 PAGES OPINPGT776 TWO PESOS, INC. v.
