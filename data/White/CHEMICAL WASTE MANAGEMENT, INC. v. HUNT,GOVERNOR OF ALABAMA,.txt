We reverse.IPetitioner, Chemical Waste Management, Inc., a Delawarecorporation with its principal place of business in Oak Brook,Illinois, owns and operates one of the Nation's oldest com-mercial hazardous waste land disposal facilities, located inEmelle, Alabama. Opened in 1977 and acquired by peti-tioner in 1978, the Emelle facility is a hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facility operating pursuant topermits issued by the Environmental Protection Agency(EPA) under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Actof 1976 (RCRA), 90 Stat. 2795, as amended, 42 U. S. C. $ 6901et seq., and the Toxic Substances Control Act, 90 Stat. 2003,as amended, 15 U. S. C. $ 2601et seq. (1988 ed. and Supp. II),and by the State of Alabama under Ala. Code $ 22-30-12(i)(1990). Alabama is 1 of only 16 States that have commercialhazardous waste landfills, and the Emelle facility is thelargest of the 21 landfills of this kind located in these 16States. Brief for National Governors' Assn. et al. asAmiciCuriae 3, citing E. Smith, EI Digest 26-27 (Mar. 1992).The parties do not dispute that the wastes and substancesbeing landfilled at the Emelle facility "include substancesthat are inherently dangerous to human health and safetyand to the environment. Such waste consists of ignitable,corrosive, toxic and reactive wastes which contain poisonousand cancer causing chemicals and which can cause birth defects, genetic damage, blindness, crippling and death." 1 5841 As used in RCRA, 42 U.

HUNTOpinion of the CourtSo. 2d 1367, 1373 (Ala. 1991). Increasing amounts of out-of-state hazardous wastes are shipped to the Emelle facility forpermanent storage each year. From 1985 through 1989, thetonnage of hazardous waste received per year has more thandoubled, increasing from 341,000 tons in 1985 to 788,000 tonsby 1989. Of this, up to 90% of the tonnage permanently buried each year is shipped in from other States.Against this backdrop Alabama enacted Act No. 90-326(Act). Ala. Code $$ 22-30B-1 to 22-30B-18 (1990 and Supp.1991). Among other provisions, the Act includes a "cap"that generally limits the amount of hazardous wastes orsubstances2 that may be disposed of in any 1-year period,and the amount of hazardous waste disposed of during thefirst year under the Act's new fees becomes the permanentceiling in subsequent years. Ala. Code $ 22-30B-2.3 (1990).The cap applies to commercial facilities that dispose of over100,000 tons of hazardous wastes or substances per year, butonly the Emelle facility, as the only commercial facility operating within Alabama, meets this description. The Act alsoimposes a "base fee" of $25.60 per ton on all hazardouswastes and substances disposed of at commercial facilities,to be paid by the operator of the facility. Ala. Code $ 22-30B-2(a) (Supp. 1991). Finally, the Act imposes the "addi-tional fee" at issue here, which states in full:"For waste and substances which are generated out-side of Alabama and disposed of at a commercial site for"(B) pose a substantial present or potential hazard to human health orthe environment when improperly treated, stored, transported, or disposed of, or otherwise managed."RCRA directs the EPA to establish a comprehensive "cradle to grave"system regulating the generation, transport, storage, treatment, and disposal of hazardous wastes, $$ 6921-6939b, which includes identification andlisting of hazardous wastes, $ 6921. At present, there are more than 500such listed wastes. See 40 CFR pt. 261, subpt. D (1991).2 "Hazardous substance(s)" and "hazardous waste(s)" are defined termsin the Act, $$ 22-30B-1(3) and 22-30B-1(4), but these definitions largelyparallel the meanings given under federal law.504us1$78D 04-23-96 09:40:32 PAGES OPINPGT339Cite as: 504 U.

HUNTOpinion of the Courtof interstate trade.3 Today, in Fort Gratiot Sanitary Landfill, Inc. v. Michigan Dept. of Natural Resources, post,p. 353, we have also considered a Commerce Clause challengeto a Michigan law prohibiting private landfill operators fromaccepting solid waste originating outside the county in whichtheir facilities operate. In striking down that law, we ad-hered to our decision inPhiladelphia v. New Jersey, 437U. S. 617 (1978), where we found New Jersey's prohibition ofsolid waste from outside that State to amount to economicprotectionism barred by the Commerce Clause:" `[T]he evil of protectionism can reside in legislativemeans as well as legislative ends. Thus, it does notmatter whether the ultimate aim of ch. 363 is to reducethe waste disposal costs of New Jersey residents or tosave remaining open lands from pollution, for we assumeNew Jersey has every right to protect its residents'3 The Alabama Supreme Court assumed that the disposal of hazardouswaste constituted an article of commerce, and the State does not explicitlyargue here to the contrary. In Fort Gratiot Sanitary Landfill, Inc. v.Michigan Dept. of Natural Resources, post, at 359, we have reaffirmedthe idea that "[s]olid waste, even if it has no value, is an article of commerce." As stated in Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U. S. 617, 622-623(1978): "All objects of interstate trade merit Commerce Clause protection;none is excluded by definition at the outset. . . . Just as Congress haspower to regulate the interstate movement of these wastes, States are notfree from constitutional scrutiny when they restrict that movement."The definition of "hazardous waste" makes clear that it is simply a gradeof solid waste, albeit one of particularly noxious and dangerous propensities, see n. 1, supra, but whether the business arrangements between outof-state generators of hazardous waste and the Alabama operator of ahazardous waste landfill are viewed as "sales" of hazardous waste or "purchases" of transportation and disposal services, "the commercial transactions unquestionably have an interstate character. The Commerce Clausethus imposes some constraints on [Alabama's] ability to regulate thesetransactions." Fort Gratiot Sanitary Landfill, post, at 359. See National Solid Wastes Management Assn. v.

And it maybe assumed as well that New Jersey may pursue thoseends by slowing the flow of all waste into the State'sremaining landfills, even though interstate commercemay incidentally be affected. But whatever New Jersey's ultimate purpose, it may not be accompanied bydiscriminating against articles of commerce coming fromoutside the State unless there is some reason, apart fromtheir origin, to treat them differently. Both on its faceand in its plain effect, ch. 363 violates this principle ofnondiscrimination." `The Court has consistently found parochial legislation of this kind to be constitutionally invalid, whetherthe ultimate aim of the legislation was to assure a steadysupply of milk by erecting barriers to allegedly ruinousoutside competition, Baldwin v.

HUNTOpinion of the CourtState from the national economy." Philadelphia v. NewJersey, supra, at 627.The Act's additional fee facially discriminates against hazardous waste generated in States other than Alabama, andthe Act overall has plainly discouraged the full operation ofpetitioner's Emelle facility.4 Such burdensome taxes imposed on interstate commerce alone are generally forbidden:"[A] State may not tax a transaction or incident more heavilywhen it crosses state lines than when it occurs entirelywithin the State." Armco Inc. v. Hardesty, 467 U. S. 638,642 (1984); see also Walling v. Michigan, 116 U. S. 446, 455(1886); Guy v. Baltimore, 100 U. S. 434, 439 (1880). Once astate tax is found to discriminate against out-of-state commerce, it is typically struck down without further inquiry.See, e. g., Westinghouse Electric Corp. v. Tully, 466 U. S. 388,406-407 (1984); Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U. S. 725, 759-760 (1981); Boston Stock Exchange v. State Tax Comm'n, 429U. S. 318, 336-337 (1977).The State, however, argues that the additional fee imposedon out-of-state hazardous waste serves legitimate local purposes related to its citizens' health and safety. Because theadditional fee discriminates both on its face and in practicaleffect, the burden falls on the State "to justify it both interms of the local benefits flowing from the statute and theunavailability of nondiscriminatory alternatives adequate topreserve the local interests at stake." Hunt v. WashingtonState Apple Advertising Comm'n, 432 U. S. 333, 353 (1977);see also Fort Gratiot Sanitary Landfill, post, at 359; NewEnergy Co., supra, at 278-279.

S.322, 337 (1979).5The State's argument here does not significantly differfrom the Alabama Supreme Court's conclusions on the legitimate local purposes of the additional fee imposed, whichwere:"The Additional Fee serves these legitimate local pur-poses that cannot be adequately served by reasonablenondiscriminatory alternatives: (1) protection of thehealth and safety of the citizens of Alabama from toxicsubstances; (2) conservation of the environment and thestate's natural resources; (3) provision for compensatoryrevenue for the costs and burdens that out-of-statewaste generators impose by dumping their hazardouswaste in Alabama; (4) reduction of the overall flow ofwastes traveling on the state's highways, which flow creates a great risk to the health and safety of the state'scitizens." 584 So. 2d, at 1389.These may all be legitimate local interests, and petitionerhas not attacked them. But only rhetoric, and not explanation, emerges as to why Alabama targets only interstatehazardous waste to meet these goals. As found by the trialcourt, "[a]lthough the Legislature imposed an additional feeof $72.00 per ton on waste generated outside Alabama, there5 To some extent the State attempts to avail itself of the more flexibleapproach outlined in, e. g., Brown-Forman Distillers Corp. v. New YorkState Liquor Authority, 476 U. S. 573, 579 (1986), and Pike v. BruceChurch, Inc., 397 U. S. 137, 142 (1970), but this lesser scrutiny is onlyavailable "where other legislative objectives are credibly advanced andthere is no patent discrimination against interstate trade." Philadelphiav. New Jersey, 437 U. S., at 624 (emphasis added). We find no room hereto say that the Act presents "effects upon interstate commerce that areonly incidental," ibid., for the Act's additional fee on its face targets onlyout-of-state hazardous waste. While no "clear line" separates close caseson which scrutiny should apply, "this is not a close case." Wyoming v.Oklahoma, 502 U.

The Court finds under the facts of thiscase that the only basis for the additional fee is the origin ofthe waste." App. to Pet. for Cert. 83a-84a. In the face ofsuch findings, invalidity under the Commerce Clause neces-sarily follows, for "whatever [Alabama's] ultimate purpose, itmay not be accomplished by discriminating against articlesof commerce coming from outside the State unless there issome reason, apart from their origin, to treat them differ-ently."Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U. S., at 626-627;see New Energy Co., 486 U. S., at 279-280. The burden is onthe State to show that "thediscrimination is demonstrablyjustified by a valid factor unrelated to economic protectionism," 6 Wyoming v. Oklahoma, 502 U. S. 437, 454 (1992) (em-phasis added), and it has not carried this burden. Cf.FortGratiot Sanitary Landfill, post, at 361.Ultimately, the State's concern focuses on the volume ofthe waste entering the Emelle facility.7 Less discriminatory6 The Alabama Supreme Court found no "economic protectionism" here,and thus purported to distinguish Philadelphia v. New Jersey, based onits conclusions that the legislature was motivated by public health andenvironmental concerns. 584 So. 2d 1367, 1388-1389 (1991). This narrowfocus on the intended consequence of the additional fee does not conformto our precedents, for "[a] finding that state legislation constitutes `economic protectionism' may be made on the basis of either discriminatorypurpose, see Hunt v. Washington Apple Advertising Comm'n, 432 U. S.333, 352-353 (1977), or discriminatory effect, see Philadelphia v. NewJersey, supra." Bacchus Imports, Ltd. v. Dias, 468 U.

Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana, 453 U. S.609, 619 (1981), or a per-mile tax on all vehicles transportinghazardous waste across Alabama roads, cf. American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Scheiner, 483 U. S. 266, 286 (1987), or anevenhanded cap on the total tonnage landfilled at Emelle, seePhiladelphia v. New Jersey, supra, at 626, which would curtail volume from all sources.8 To the extent Alabama's con-cern touches environmental conservation and the health andsafety of its citizens, such concern does not vary with thepoint of origin of the waste, and it remains within the State'spower to monitor and regulate more closely the transporta8 The State asserts: "An equal fee, at any level, would necessarily failto serve the State's purpose. An equal fee high enough to provide anysignificant deterrent to the importation of hazardous waste for landfillingin the State would amount to an attempt by the State to avoid its responsibility to deal with its own problems, by tending to cause in-state waste tobe exported for disposal. An equal fee not so high as to amount to anattempt to force Alabama's own problems to be borne by citizens of otherstates would fail to provide any significant reduction in the enormous volumes of imported hazardous waste being dumped in the State. At thepoint where an equal fee would become effective to serve the State's purpose in protecting public health and the environment from uncontrolledvolumes of imported waste, that equal fee would also become an avoidanceof the State's responsibility to deal with its own waste problems." Id., at46. These assertions are without record support and in any event do notsuffice to validate plain discrimination against interstate commerce. SeeNew Energy Co. of Ind. v. Limbach, 486 U. S. 269, 280 (1988); Hale v.Bimco Trading, Inc., 306 U. S. 375, 380 (1939): "That no Florida cementneeds any inspection while all foreign cement requires inspection at a costof fifteen cents per hundredweight is too violent an assumption to justifythe discrimination here disclosed." The additional fee is certainly not a" `last ditch' attempt" to meet Alabama's expressed purposes "after nondiscriminatory alternatives have proved unfeasible. It is rather a choice ofthe most discriminatory [tax] even though nondiscriminatory alternativeswould seem likely to fulfill the State's purported legitimate local purposemore effectively." Hughes v.

But if the State, underthe guise of exerting its police powers, should make suchexclusion or prohibition applicable solely to articles, ofthat kind, that may be produced or manufactured inother States, the courts would find no difficulty in holding such legislation to be in conflict with the Constitution of the United States."See also Reid v.

HUNTOpinion of the CourtThe law struck down in Philadelphia v. New Jersey leftlocal waste untouched, although no basis existed by whichto distinguish interstate waste. But "[i]f one is inherentlyharmful, so is the other. Yet New Jersey has banned theformer while leaving its landfill sites open to the latter."437 U. S., at 629. Here, the additional fee applies only tointerstate hazardous waste, but at all points from its entrance into Alabama until it is landfilled at the Emelle facility, every concern related to quarantine applies perforce tolocal hazardous waste, which pays no additional fee. Forthis reason, the additional fee does not survive the appropriate scrutiny applicable to discriminations against interstate commerce.Maine v. Taylor, 477 U. S. 131 (1986), provides no additional justification. Maine there demonstrated that the outof-state baitfish were subject to parasites foreign to in-statebaitfish. This difference posed a threat to the State's natural resources, and absent a less discriminatory means of protecting the environment--and none was available--the importation of baitfish could properly be banned. Id., at 140.To the contrary, the record establishes that the hazardouswaste at issue in this case is the same regardless of its pointof origin. As noted in Fort Gratiot Sanitary Landfill, "ourconclusion would be different if the imported waste raisedhealth or other concerns not presented by [Alabama] waste."Post, at 367. Because no unique threat is posed, and because adequate means other than overt discrimination meetAlabama's concerns, Maine v.
