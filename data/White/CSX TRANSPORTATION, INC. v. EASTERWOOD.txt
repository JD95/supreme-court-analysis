Thomas Easterwood was killed on February 24, 1988when a train owned and operated by petitioner and crossrespondent CSX Transportation, Inc., collided with the truckhe was driving at the Cook Street crossing in Cartersville,Georgia. His widow, respondent and cross-petitioner LizzieEasterwood, brought this diversity wrongful-death action,which alleges, inter alia, that CSX was negligent underGeorgia law for failing to maintain adequate warning devicesat the crossing and for operating the train at an excessivespeed. The issue before the Court is the extent to whichthe Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 (FRSA), 84 Stat.971, as amended, 45 U. S. C. $$ 421-447 (1988 ed. and Supp.II), pre-empts these claims.The District Court for the Northern District of Georgiagranted summary judgment for CSX on the ground that bothclaims were pre-empted. 742 F. Supp. 676, 678 (1990). TheCourt of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed in partand reversed in part, holding that respondent's allegation ofnegligence based on the train's speed was pre-empted, butthat the claim based on the absence of proper warning devices was not. 933 F. 2d 1548, 1553-1556 (1991).

This Act makes federalfunds available to the States to improve grade crossings, inreturn for which the States must "conduct and systematically maintain a survey of all highways to identify those rail-road crossings which may require separation, relocation, orprotective devices, and establish and implement a scheduleof projects for this purpose." 23 U. S. C. $ 130(d). Furtherconditions on the States' use of federal aid to improve gradecrossings have been set out in regulations promulgated bythe Secretary through the Federal Highway Administration(FHWA) under FRSA and the Highway Safety Act. See 23CFR pts. 646, 655, 924, 1204 (1992). It is petitioner's conten-tion that the Secretary's speed and grade crossing regulations "cove[r] the subject matter" of, and therefore pre-empt,the state law on which respondent relies.4Where a state statute conflicts with, or frustrates, federallaw, the former must give way. U. S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2;Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U. S. 725, 746 (1981). In the3 See U. S. Dept. of Transportation, Railroad-Highway Safety, Part I: AComprehensive Statement of the Problem (1971); U. S. Dept. of Transportation, Railroad-Highway Safety, Part II: Recommendations for Resolvingthe Problem (1972).4 The Court of Appeals found that, because the grade crossing regulations were promulgated pursuant to the Highway Safety Act (rather thanFRSA), their pre-emptive effect is not governed by $ 434. 933 F. 2d 1548,1555 (CA11 1991). As petitioner notes, this distinction does not apply to23 CFR pts. 646 and 1204, which were promulgated under the authorityof both statutes. See Brief for Petitioner in No. 91-790, p. 36. In anyevent, the plain terms of $ 434 do not limit the application of its expresspre-emption clause to regulations adopted by the Secretary pursuant toFRSA. Instead, they state that any regulation "adopted" by the Secretary may have pre-emptive effect, regardless of the enabling legislation.At the very least, the Court of Appeals' conclusion is inappropriate withrespect to regulations issued under 23 U. S. C. $ 130, given that the latteris a direct outgrowth of FRSA.507us3$58D 11-20-96 18:59:04 PAGES OPINPGT664 CSX TRANSP., INC. v. EASTERWOODOpinion of the Courtinterest of avoiding unintended encroachment on the author-ity of the States, however, a court interpreting a federalstatute pertaining to a subject traditionally governed bystate law will be reluctant to find pre-emption. Thus, preemption will not lie unless it is "the clear and manifest purpose of Congress." Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331U. S. 218, 230 (1947). Evidence of pre-emptive purpose issought in the text and structure of the statute at issue.Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 463 U. S. 85, 95 (1983). If thestatute contains an express pre-emption clause, the task ofstatutory construction must in the first instance focus on theplain wording of the clause, which necessarily contains thebest evidence of Congress' pre-emptive intent.According to $ 434, applicable federal regulations may preempt any state "law, rule, regulation, order, or standard relating to railroad safety." Legal duties imposed on railroadsby the common law fall within the scope of these broadphrases. Cf. Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U. S. 504,522 (1992) (federal statute barring additional " `requirement[s]' . . . `imposed under State law' " pre-empts commonlaw claims); id., at 548-549 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (same). Thus, the issuebefore the Court is whether the Secretary of Transportationhas issued regulations covering the same subject matter asGeorgia negligence law pertaining to the maintenance of, andthe operation of trains at, grade crossings. To prevail on theclaim that the regulations have pre-emptive effect, petitionermust establish more than that they "touch upon" or "relateto" that subject matter, cf. Morales v. Trans World Airlines,Inc., 504 U. S. 374, 383-384 (1992) (statute's use of "relatingto" confers broad pre-emptive effect), for "covering" is amore restrictive term which indicates that pre-emption willlie only if the federal regulations substantially subsume thesubject matter of the relevant state law. See Webster'sThird New International Dictionary 524 (1961) (in the phrase"policy clauses covering the situation," cover means "to com507us3$58D 11-20-96 18:59:04 PAGES OPINPGT665Cite as: 507 U. S. 658 (1993)Opinion of the Courtprise, include, or embrace in an effective scope of treatmentor operation"). The term "covering" is in turn employedwithin a provision that displays considerable solicitude forstate law in that its express pre-emption clause is both prefaced and succeeded by express saving clauses. See supra,at 662.IIAfter filing an answer denying the allegations of negli-gence with respect to the warning devices at Cook Streetand with respect to the train's speed, petitioner moved forsummary judgment on the ground that these claims werepre-empted. As the litigation comes to us, petitioner doesnot assert that the complaint fails to state a claim underGeorgia law. The sole issue here is pre-emption, which de-pends on whether the regulations issued by the Secretarycover the subject matter of the two allegations, each of whichwe may assume states a valid cause of action.5As indicated above, the Secretary of Transportation hasaddressed grade crossing safety through a series of regulations. Each State receiving federal aid is required toestablish a "highway safety improvement program" that establishes priorities for addressing all manner of highwayhazards and guides the implementation and evaluation of5 Because the litigation comes to us in this posture, neither party provides a description of Georgia statute or case law dealing with trainspeeds or the duties of railroads with respect to grade crossings. However, we note that Georgia Code Ann. $ 32-6-190 (1991) provides thatrailroads are under a duty to maintain their grade crossings "in such condition as to permit the safe and convenient passage of public traffic."While final authority for the installation of particular safety devices atgrade crossings has long rested with state and local governments, see,e. g., $ 40-6-25, this allocation of authority apparently does not relieve therailroads of their duty to take all reasonable precautions to maintain gradecrossing safety, Southern R.

Thus, States must employ auto-matic gates with flashing light signals as part of any improvement project that concerns a crossing that features,inter alia, multiple tracks, high speed trains operatingin areas of limited visibility, heavy vehicle or train traffic,or if a diagnostic team made up of "representatives of theparties of interest in [the crossing]," $ 646.204(g), recom-mends them.8 For federally funded installations at cross6 Parallel provisions require state programs to systematically identifyhazardous crossings and to develop "a program for the elimination ofhazards." 23 CFR $ 1204.4 (1992), Highway Safety Program GuidelineNo. 12(G).7 U.

These provisionsestablish the general terms of the bargain between the Fed-eral and State Governments: The States may obtain federalfunds if they take certain steps to ensure that the funds areefficiently spent. On its face, this federal effort to encourage the States to rationalize their decisionmaking has littleto say about the subject matter of negligence law, because,with respect to grade crossing safety, the responsibilities ofrailroads and the State are, and traditionally have been,quite distinct. Before the enactment of FRSA, for example,Georgia's authority over grade crossing improvements didnot excuse a railroad's liability in negligence for failing tomaintain a safe crossing, see n. 5, supra, just as a jury findingto include automatic gates with flashing light signals when one or more ofthe following conditions exist:"(A) Multiple main line railroad tracks."(B) Multiple tracks at or in the vicinity of the crossing which may beoccupied by a train or locomotive so as to obscure the movement of anothertrain approaching the crossing."(C) High Speed train operation combined with limited sight distance ateither single or multiple track crossings."(D) A combination of high speeds and moderately high volumes of highway and railroad traffic."(E) Either a high volume of vehicular traffic, high number of trainmovements, substantial numbers of schoolbuses or trucks carrying hazardous materials, unusually restricted sight distance, continuing accidentoccurrences, or any combination of these conditions."(F) A diagnostic team recommends them."(ii) In individual cases where a diagnostic team justifies that gates arenot appropriate, FHWA may find that the above requirements are notapplicable."For the definition of "diagnostic team," see 23 CFR $ 646.204(g) (1992).507us3$58D 11-20-96 18:59:04 PAGES OPINPGT668 CSX TRANSP., INC. v. EASTERWOODOpinion of the Courtof railroad negligence bore no particular significance on theState's safety efforts beyond that which the State wishedto give it. Certainly there is no explicit indication in theregulations of 23 CFR pt. 924 that the terms of the FederalGovernment's bargain with the States require modificationof this regime of separate spheres of responsibility. And,contrary to the view of the Court of Appeals for the TenthCircuit, it does not necessarily follow that "[t]he hit-or-misscommon law method runs counter to a statutory scheme ofplanned prioritization."Hatfield v. Burlington NorthernR. Co., 958 F. 2d 320, 324 (1992). In fact, the scheme of negligence liability could just as easily complement these regula-tions by encouraging railroads--the entities arguably mostfamiliar with crossing conditions--to provide current andcomplete information to the state agency responsible for determining priorities for improvement projects in accordancewith $ 924.9. In light of the relatively stringent standardset by the language of $ 434 and the presumption against pre-emption, and given that the regulations provide no affirmative indication of their effect on negligence law, we are notprepared to find pre-emption solely on the strength of thegeneral mandates of 23 CFR pt. 924.Likewise, the requirement that the States comply with theMUTCD does not cover the subject matter of the tort law ofgrade crossings. Petitioner's contrary reading rests primarily on language that appears in Part VIII of the Manual,entitled "Traffic Control Systems for Railroad-HighwayGrade Crossings":"[T]he highway agency and the railroad company areentitled to jointly occupy the right-of-way in the conductof their assigned duties. This requires joint responsi-bility in the traffic control function between the publicagency and the railroad. The determination of needand selection of devices at a grade crossing is made bythe public agency with jurisdictional authority. Subjectto such determination and selection, the design, installa507us3$58D 11-20-96 18:59:04 PAGES OPINPGT669Cite as: 507 U. S. 658 (1993)Opinion of the Courttion and operation shall be in accordance with the national standards contained herein." Manual, at 8A-1.9According to petitioner, the third sentence of this paragraph,combined with the directive in 23 CFR $ 646.214(b)(1) thatthe States comply with the Manual, amounts to a determination by the Secretary that state governmental bodies shallbear exclusive responsibility for grade crossing safety.Petitioner's argument suffers from an initial implausibility:It asserts that established state negligence law has been implicitly displaced by means of an elliptical reference in a Government Manual otherwise devoted to describing for thebenefit of state employees the proper size, color, and shapeof traffic signs and signals. Not surprisingly, the Manualitself disavows any such pretensions: "It is the intent thatthe provisions of this Manual be standards for traffic controldevices installation, but not a legal requirement for installation." Manual, at 1A-4. The language on which petitionerrelies undermines rather than supports its claim by acknowledging that the States must approve the installation of anyprotective device even as the railroads maintain "joint responsibility" for traffic safety at crossings. As is made clearin the FHWA's guide to the Manual, the MUTCD provides adescription of, rather than a prescription for, the allocationof responsibility for grade crossing safety between theFederal and State Governments and between States andrailroads:9 Petitioner also notes similar language contained in the Manual, at8D-1:"The selection of traffic control devices at a grade crossing is determined by public agencies having jurisdictional responsibility at specificlocations.. . . . .". . . Before a new or modified grade crossing traffic control systemis installed, approval is required from the appropriate agency within agiven State."507us3$58D 11-20-96 18:59:04 PAGES OPINPGT670 CSX TRANSP., INC. v.

Within some States,responsibility is frequently divided among several publicagencies and the railroad." U. S. Dept. of Transporta-tion, Federal Highway Administration, Traffic ControlDevices Handbook (1983).Rather than establishing an alternative scheme of duties in-compatible with existing Georgia negligence law, the Manualdisavows any claim to cover the subject matter of that bodyof law.The remaining potential sources of pre-emption are theprovisions of 23 CFR $$ 646.214(b)(3) and (4), which, unlikethe foregoing provisions, do establish requirements as to theinstallation of particular warning devices. Examination ofthese regulations demonstrates that, when they are applica-ble, state tort law is pre-empted. However, petitioner hasfailed to establish that the regulations apply to these cases,and hence we find respondent's grade crossing claim is notpre-empted.As discussed supra, at 666-667, under $$ 646.214(b)(3)and (4), a project for the improvement of a grade crossingmust either include an automatic gate or receive FHWAapproval if federal funds "participate in the installa-tion of the [warning] devices."10 Thus, unlike the Manual,$$ 646.214(b)(3) and (4) displace state and private decision-making authority by establishing a federal-law requirement that certain protective devices be installed or fed-eral approval obtained. Indeed, $$ 646.214(b)(3) and (4)effectively set the terms under which railroads are to partici-pate in the improvement of crossings. The former section10 As petitioner has not suggested that the Cook Street crossing is located in, or near the terminus of, a federal-aid highway project, the issueof the proper application of 23 CFR $ 646.214(b)(2) (1992) is not before us.507us3$58D 11-20-96 18:59:04 PAGES OPINPGT671Cite as: 507 U. S. 658 (1993)Opinion of the Courtenvisions railroad involvement in the selection of warn-ing devices through their participation in diagnostic teamswhich may recommend the use or nonuse of crossing gates.$$ 646.214(b)(3)(i)(F) and (3)(ii). Likewise, $ 646.214(b)(4),which covers federally funded installations at crossings thatdo not feature multiple tracks, heavy traffic, or the like, ex-plicitly notes that railroad participation in the initial determination of "the type of warning device to be installed" atparticular crossings is subject to the Secretary's approval.In either case, the Secretary has determined that the rail-roads shall not be made to pay any portion of installationcosts. $ 646.210(b)(1). In short, for projects in which federal funds participate in the installation of warning devices,the Secretary has determined the devices to be installed andthe means by which railroads are to participate in their selection. The Secretary's regulations therefore cover the subject matter of state law which, like the tort law on whichrespondent relies, seeks to impose an independent duty on arailroad to identify and/or repair dangerous crossings.The remaining question with respect to respondent's gradecrossing claim is whether the preconditions for the application of either regulation have been met. A review of therecord reveals that they have not. Petitioner relies on anaffidavit from an engineer for the Georgia Department ofTransportation (DOT) which was submitted in support of itsmotion for summary judgment. The affidavit indicates that,in 1979-1980, the DOT decided to install a crossing gate atthe West Avenue crossing in Cartersville. That gate couldnot be installed, however, without placing motion-detectiondevices at four adjacent crossings, including Cook Street.App. 16. The DOT therefore installed new circuitry at eachcrossing, and subsequently installed gates at West Avenueand each of the adjacent crossings except Cook Street. Although a gate was also planned for Cook Street and fundsset aside for the project, no other devices were installed because the street's width required the construction of a traffic507us3$58D 11-20-96 18:59:04 PAGES OPINPGT672 CSX TRANSP., INC. v. EASTERWOODOpinion of the Courtisland, which in turn required city approval. When the citydeclined to approve the island out of concern for the flow ofvehicular traffic, the plan for the gate was shelved and thefunds allocated for use in another project.These facts do not establish that federal funds "partici-pate[d] in the installation of the [warning] devices" at CookStreet. The only equipment installed was the motion-detection circuitry. Such circuitry does not meet the definition of warning devices provided in 23 CFR $$ 646.204(i) and( j) (1992).11 Petitioner nevertheless contends that the CookStreet crossing was part of a single project to improve thefive Cartersville crossings, and that the regulations were applicable because federal funds participated in the installationof gates at the other four crossings. Reply Brief for Petitioner in No. 91-790, p. 20. Neither party identifies anystatutory or regulatory provisions defining the term "project," although some usages cast doubt on petitioner's view.See, e. g., 23 CFR $ 646.210(c)(3) (describing the eliminationof "a grade crossing" as "the . . . project"). Even if the termcould be construed to include either individual or multiplecrossing projects, it is clear that the Georgia DOT treatedthe installation of warning devices at West Avenue and CookStreet as distinct projects. Respondent's own affiant statesthat the cost of the motion detector installed at Cook Street"was included in the estimated costs proposal prepared . . .for the West Avenue crossing improvements . . . ." App. 17.11 The relevant definitions state:"(i) Passive warning devices means those types of traffic control devices, including signs, markings and other devices, located at or in advanceof grade crossings to indicate the presence of a crossing but which do notchange aspect upon the approach or presence of a train."(j) Active warning devices means those traffic control devices activatedby the approach or presence of a train, such as flashing light signals, automatic gates and similar devices, as well as manually operated devices andcrossing watchmen, all of which display to motorists positive warningof the approach or presence of a train." 23 CFR $$ 646.204(i) and (j)(emphases added).507us3$58D 11-20-96 18:59:04 PAGES OPINPGT673Cite as: 507 U.

The decision to install gate arms at the Cook Streetcrossing was placed on a list of projects to be considered ata later time." 742 F. Supp., at 678. In light of the inapplicability of $$ 646.214(b)(3) and (4) to these cases, we concludethat respondent's grade crossing claim is not pre-empted.12IIIFederal regulations issued by the Secretary pursuant toFRSA and codified at 49 CFR $ 213.9(a) (1992) set maximumallowable operating speeds for all freight and passengertrains for each class of track on which they travel. The different classes of track are in turn defined by, inter alia, theirgage, alinement, curvature, surface uniformity, and the number of crossties per length of track. See $$ 213.51-213.143.The track at the Cook Street crossing is class four, for whichthe maximum speed is 60 miles per hour. Although respondent concedes that petitioner's train was traveling atless than 60 miles per hour,13 she nevertheless contends thatpetitioner breached its common-law duty to operate its trainat a moderate and safe rate of speed. See, e. g., Central ofGeorgia R. Co. v. Markert, 200 Ga. App. 851, 852; 410 S. E. 2d437, 438, cert. denied, 200 Ga. App. 895 (1991). Petitionercontends that this claim is pre-empted because the federalspeed limits are regulations covering the subject matter ofthe common law of train speed.12 We reject petitioner's claim of implied "conflict" pre-emption, Brieffor Petitioner in No. 91-790, pp. 40-43, on the basis of the preceding analysis. Of course we express no opinion on how the state-law suit againstthe railroad should come out in light of the decisions taken by Cartersvilleand the Georgia DOT with respect to the Cook Street project.13 Affidavits submitted by the parties indicate that the train was movingat a rate of 32 to 50 miles per hour.507us3$58D 11-20-96 18:59:04 PAGES OPINPGT674 CSX TRANSP., INC. v. EASTERWOODOpinion of the CourtOn their face, the provisions of $ 213.9(a) address only themaximum speeds at which trains are permitted to travelgiven the nature of the track on which they operate. Never-theless, related safety regulations adopted by the Secretaryreveal that the limits were adopted only after the hazardsposed by track conditions were taken into account. Understood in the context of the overall structure of the regula-tions, the speed limits must be read as not only establishinga ceiling, but also precluding additional state regulation ofthe sort that respondent seeks to impose on petitioner.Because the conduct of the automobile driver is the majorvariable in grade crossing accidents, and because trains offerfar fewer opportunities for regulatory control, the safety reg-ulations established by the Secretary concentrate on providing clear and accurate warnings of the approach of oncomingtrains to drivers.14 Accordingly, the Secretary's regulationsfocus on providing appropriate warnings given variations intrain speed. The MUTCD, for example, requires the installation at grade crossings of signaling devices that provideuniform periods of advance notice regardless of train speed.Manual, at 8C-7. Likewise, as discussed supra, at 666, auto-matic gates are required for federally funded projects affecting crossings over which trains travel at high speeds. 23CFR $$ 646.214(b)(3)(C) and (D).

Respondent nevertheless maintains thatpre-emption is inappropriate because the Secretary's pri-mary purpose in enacting the speed limits was not to ensuresafety at grade crossings, but rather to prevent derailments.Section 434 does not, however, call for an inquiry into theSecretary's purposes, but instead directs the courts to deter-mine whether regulations have been adopted that in factcover the subject matter of train speed. Respondent alsoargues that common-law speed restrictions are preserved bythe second saving clause of $ 434, under which "a State may. . . continue in force an additional or more stringent law . . .relating to railroad safety when necessary to eliminate orreduce an essentially local safety hazard, and when not incompatible with any Federal law, rule, regulation, order, orstandard . . . ." The state law on which respondent relies isconcerned with local hazards only in the sense that its appli-cation turns on the facts of each case. The common law ofnegligence provides a general rule to address all hazardscaused by lack of due care, not just those owing to uniquelocal conditions. Respondent's contrary view would com-pletely deprive the Secretary of the power to pre-empt statecommon law, a power clearly conferred by $ 434. At theleast, this renders respondent's reliance on the common law"incompatible with" FRSA and the Secretary's regulations.We thus conclude that respondent's excessive speed claimcannot stand in light of the Secretary's adoption of the regu-lations in $ 213.9.1515 Petitioner is prepared to concede that the pre-emption of respondent'sexcessive speed claim does not bar suit for breach of related tort law duties, such as the duty to slow or stop a train to avoid a specific, individual507us3$58D 11-20-96 18:59:04 PAGES OPINPGT676 CSX TRANSP., INC. v.
