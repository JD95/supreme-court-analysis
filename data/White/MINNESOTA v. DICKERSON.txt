In this case, we consider whether the Fourth Amendmentpermits the seizure of contraband detected through a policeofficer's sense of touch during a protective patdown search.IOn the evening of November 9, 1989, two Minneapolis po-lice officers were patrolling an area on the city's north side ina marked squad car. At about 8:15 p.m., one of the officersobserved respondent leaving a 12-unit apartment building onMorgan Avenue North. The officer, having previously re-sponded to complaints of drug sales in the building's hallways and having executed several search warrants on thepremises, considered the building to be a notorious "crackhouse." According to testimony credited by the trial court,respondent began walking toward the police but, upon spot*Fred E. Inbau, Wayne W. Schmidt, James P. Manak, and Robert H.Macy filed a brief for Americans for Effective Law Enforcement, Inc.,et al. urging reversal.Briefs of amici curiae urging affirmance were filed for the AmericanCivil Liberties Union et al. by John F. Savarese, Steven R. Shapiro, andDeborah Gilman; and for the National Association of Criminal DefenseLawyers by David M. Eldridge.508us2$85D 02-13-97 18:09:52 PAGES OPINPGT369Cite as: 508 U. S. 366 (1993)Opinion of the Courtting the squad car and making eye contact with one of theofficers, abruptly halted and began walking in the oppositedirection. His suspicion aroused, this officer watched as re-spondent turned and entered an alley on the other side ofthe apartment building. Based upon respondent's seem-ingly evasive actions and the fact that he had just left abuilding known for cocaine traffic, the officers decided to stoprespondent and investigate further.The officers pulled their squad car into the alley and or-dered respondent to stop and submit to a patdown search.The search revealed no weapons, but the officer conductingthe search did take an interest in a small lump in respondent's nylon jacket. The officer later testified:"[A]s I pat-searched the front of his body, I felt a lump,a small lump, in the front pocket. I examined it withmy fingers and it slid and it felt to be a lump of crackcocaine in cellophane." Tr. 9 (Feb. 20, 1990).The officer then reached into respondent's pocket and re-trieved a small plastic bag containing one fifth of one gramof crack cocaine. Respondent was arrested and charged inHennepin County District Court with possession of a controlled substance.Before trial, respondent moved to suppress the cocaine.The trial court first concluded that the officers were justifiedunderTerry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1 (1968), in stopping respond-ent to investigate whether he might be engaged in criminalactivity. The court further found that the officers were jus-tified in frisking respondent to ensure that he was not carrying a weapon. Finally, analogizing to the "plain-view" doc-trine, under which officers may make a warrantless seizureof contraband found in plain view during a lawful search forother items, the trial court ruled that the officers' seizure ofthe cocaine did not violate the Fourth Amendment:"To this Court there is no distinction as to which sen-sory perception the officer uses to conclude that the ma508us2$85D 02-13-97 18:09:52 PAGES OPINPGT370 MINNESOTA v. DICKERSONOpinion of the Courtterial is contraband. An experienced officer may relyupon his sense of smell in DWI stops or in recognizingthe smell of burning marijuana in an automobile. Thesound of a shotgun being racked would clearly supportcertain reactions by an officer. The sense of touch,grounded in experience and training, is as reliable asperceptions drawn from other senses. `Plain feel,'therefore, is no different than plain view and will equallysupport the seizure here." App. to Pet. for Cert. C-5.His suppression motion having failed, respondent proceededto trial and was found guilty.On appeal, the Minnesota Court of Appeals reversed.The court agreed with the trial court that the investigativestop and protective patdown search of respondent were law-ful under Terry because the officers had a reasonable beliefbased on specific and articulable facts that respondent wasengaged in criminal behavior and that he might be armedand dangerous. The court concluded, however, that theofficers had overstepped the bounds allowed byTerry inseizing the cocaine. In doing so, the Court of Appeals "decline[d] to adopt the plain feel exception" to the warrant re-quirement. 469 N. W. 2d 462, 466 (1991).The Minnesota Supreme Court affirmed. Like the Courtof Appeals, the State Supreme Court held that both the stopand the frisk of respondent were valid under Terry, butfound the seizure of the cocaine to be unconstitutional. Thecourt expressly refused "to extend the plain view doctrineto the sense of touch" on the grounds that "the sense of touchis inherently less immediate and less reliable than the senseof sight" and that "the sense of touch is far more intrusiveinto the personal privacy that is at the core of the [F]ourth[A]mendment." 481 N. W. 2d 840, 845 (1992). The courtthus appeared to adopt a categorical rule barring the seizureof any contraband detected by an officer through the senseof touch during a patdown search for weapons. The courtfurther noted that "[e]ven if we recognized a `plain feel' ex508us2$85D 02-13-97 18:09:52 PAGES OPINPGT371Cite as: 508 U. S. 366 (1993)Opinion of the Courtception, the search in this case would not qualify" because"[t]he pat search of the defendant went far beyond what ispermissible under Terry." Id., at 843, 844, n. 1. As theState Supreme Court read the record, the officer conductingthe search ascertained that the lump in respondent's jacketwas contraband only after probing and investigating what hecertainly knew was not a weapon. See id., at 844.We granted certiorari, 506 U. S. 814 (1992), to resolve aconflict among the state and federal courts over whethercontraband detected through the sense of touch during apatdown search may be admitted into evidence.1 We nowaffirm.21 Most state and federal courts have recognized a so-called "plain-feel"or "plain-touch" corollary to the plain-view doctrine. See United Statesv. Coleman, 969 F. 2d 126, 132 (CA5 1992); United States v. Salazar, 945F. 2d 47, 51 (CA2 1991), cert. denied, 504 U. S. 923 (1992); United States v.Buchannon, 878 F. 2d 1065, 1067 (CA8 1989); United States v. Williams,262 U. S. App. D. C. 112, 119-124, 822 F. 2d 1174, 1181-1186 (1987); UnitedStates v. Norman, 701 F. 2d 295, 297 (CA4), cert. denied, 464 U. S. 820(1983); People v. Chavers, 33 Cal. 3d 462, 471-473, 658 P. 2d 96, 102-104(1983); Dickerson v. State, No. 228, 1993 Del. LEXIS 12, *3-*4 (Jan. 26,1993); State v. Guy, 172 Wis. 2d 86, 101-102, 492 N. W. 2d 311, 317-318(1992). Some state courts, however, like the Minnesota court in this case,have rejected such a corollary. See People v. Diaz, 81 N. Y. 2d 106, 612N. E. 2d 298 (1993); State v. Collins, 139 Ariz. 434, 435-438, 679 P. 2d 80,81-84 (Ct. App. 1983); People v. McCarty, 11 Ill. App. 3d 421, 422, 296N. E. 2d 862, 863 (1973); State v. Rhodes, 788 P. 2d 1380, 1381 (Okla. Crim.App. 1990); State v. Broadnax, 98 Wash. 2d 289, 296-301, 654 P. 2d 96,101-103 (1982); cf. Commonwealth v. Marconi, 408 Pa. Super. 601, 611-615,and n. 17, 597 A. 2d 616, 621-623, and n. 17 (1991), appeal denied, 531 Pa.638, 611 A. 2d 711 (1992).2 Before reaching the merits of the Fourth Amendment issue, we mustaddress respondent's contention that the case is moot. After respondentwas found guilty of the drug possession charge, the trial court sentencedrespondent under a diversionary sentencing statute to a 2-year period ofprobation. As allowed by the diversionary scheme, no judgment of conviction was entered and, upon respondent's successful completion of probation, the original charges were dismissed. See Minn. Stat. $ 152.18 (1992).Respondent argues that the case has been rendered moot by the dismissalof the original criminal charges. We often have observed, however, that508us2$85D 02-13-97 18:09:52 PAGES OPINPGT372 MINNESOTA v. DICKERSONOpinion of the CourtIIAThe Fourth Amendment, made applicable to the States byway of the Fourteenth Amendment, Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S.643 (1961), guarantees "[t]he right of the people to be securein their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures." Time and again, this Courthas observed that searches and seizures " `conducted outsidethe judicial process, without prior approval by judge or mag-istrate, areper se unreasonable under the Fourth Amend-ment--subject only to a few specifically established and welldelineated exceptions.' " Thompson v. Louisiana, 469 U. S.17, 19-20 (1984) (per curiam) (quoting Katz v. United States,389 U. S. 347, 357 (1967) (footnotes omitted)); Mincey v. Ari-zona, 437 U. S. 385, 390 (1978); see also United States v.Place, 462 U. S. 696, 701 (1983). One such exception was"the possibility of a criminal defendant's suffering `collateral legal consequences' from a sentence already served" precludes a finding of mootness.Pennsylvania v. Mimms, 434 U. S. 106, 108, n. 3 (1977) (per curiam); seealso Evitts v. Lucey, 469 U. S. 387, 391, n. 4 (1985); Sibron v. New York,392 U. S. 40, 53-58 (1968). In this case, Minnesota law provides that theproceeding which culminated in finding respondent guilty "shall not bedeemed a conviction for purposes of disqualifications or disabilities imposed by law upon conviction of a crime or for any other purpose." Minn.Stat. $ 152.18 (1992). The statute also provides, however, that a nonpublicrecord of the charges dismissed pursuant to the statute "shall be retainedby the department of public safety for the purpose of use by the courts indetermining the merits of subsequent proceedings" against the respondent. Ibid. Construing this provision, the Minnesota Supreme Court hasheld that "[t]he statute contemplates use of the record should [a] defendanthave `future difficulties with the law.' " State v. Goodrich, 256 N. W. 2d506, 512 (1977). Moreover, the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuithas held that a diversionary disposition under $ 152.18 may be included incalculating a defendant's criminal history category in the event of a subsequent federal conviction. United States v. Frank, 932 F. 2d 700, 701(1991). Thus, we must conclude that reinstatement of the record of thecharges against respondent would carry collateral legal consequences andthat, therefore, a live controversy remains.508us2$85D 02-13-97 18:09:52 PAGES OPINPGT373Cite as: 508 U. S. 366 (1993)Opinion of the Courtrecognized in Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1 (1968), which heldthat "where a police officer observes unusual conduct whichleads him reasonably to conclude in light of his experiencethat criminal activity may be afoot . . . ," the officer maybriefly stop the suspicious person and make "reasonable inquiries" aimed at confirming or dispelling his suspicions.Id., at 30; see also Adams v. Williams, 407 U. S. 143, 145-146 (1972).Terry further held that "[w]hen an officer is justified inbelieving that the individual whose suspicious behavior he isinvestigating at close range is armed and presently dangerous to the officer or to others," the officer may conduct apatdown search "to determine whether the person is in factcarrying a weapon." 392 U. S., at 24. "The purpose of thislimited search is not to discover evidence of crime, but toallow the officer to pursue his investigation without fear ofviolence . . . ." Adams, supra, at 146. Rather, a protective search--permitted without a warrant and on the basisof reasonable suspicion less than probable cause--mustbe strictly "limited to that which is necessary for the discovery of weapons which might be used to harm the officeror others nearby." Terry, supra, at 26; see also Michiganv. Long, 463 U. S. 1032, 1049, and 1052, n. 16 (1983); Ybarrav. Illinois, 444 U. S. 85, 93-94 (1979). If the protectivesearch goes beyond what is necessary to determine if thesuspect is armed, it is no longer valid under Terry and itsfruits will be suppressed. Sibron v. New York, 392 U. S. 40,65-66 (1968).These principles were settled 25 years ago when, on thesame day, the Court announced its decisions in Terry andSibron. The question presented today is whether policeofficers may seize nonthreatening contraband detected during a protective patdown search of the sort permitted byTerry. We think the answer is clearly that they may, solong as the officers' search stays within the bounds markedby Terry.508us2$85D 02-13-97 18:09:52 PAGES OPINPGT374 MINNESOTA v. DICKERSONOpinion of the CourtBWe have already held that police officers, at least undercertain circumstances, may seize contraband detected duringthe lawful execution of a Terry search. In Michigan v.Long, supra, for example, police approached a man who haddriven his car into a ditch and who appeared to be under theinfluence of some intoxicant. As the man moved to reenterthe car from the roadside, police spotted a knife on the floorboard. The officers stopped the man, subjected him to apatdown search, and then inspected the interior of the vehicle for other weapons. During the search of the passengercompartment, the police discovered an open pouch containingmarijuana and seized it. This Court upheld the validity ofthe search and seizure underTerry. The Court held firstthat, in the context of a roadside encounter, where policehave reasonable suspicion based on specific and articulablefacts to believe that a driver may be armed and dangerous,they may conduct a protective search for weapons not onlyof the driver's person but also of the passenger compartmentof the automobile. 463 U. S., at 1049. Of course, the protec-tive search of the vehicle, being justified solely by the dangerthat weapons stored there could be used against the officersor bystanders, must be "limited to those areas in which aweapon may be placed or hidden." Ibid. The Court thenheld: "If, while conducting a legitimate Terry search of theinterior of the automobile, the officer should, as here, dis-cover contraband other than weapons, he clearly cannot berequired to ignore the contraband, and the Fourth Amend-ment does not require its suppression in such circumstances." Id., at 1050; accord, Sibron, 392 U. S., at 69-70(White, J., concurring); id., at 79 (Harlan, J., concurring inresult).The Court in Long justified this latter holding by refer-ence to our cases under the "plain-view" doctrine. SeeLong, supra, at 1050; see also United States v. Hensley, 469U. S. 221, 235 (1985) (upholding plain-view seizure in context508us2$85D 02-13-97 18:09:52 PAGES OPINPGT375Cite as: 508 U. S. 366 (1993)Opinion of the Courtof Terry stop). Under that doctrine, if police are lawfully ina position from which they view an object, if its incriminating character is immediately apparent, and if the officershave a lawful right of access to the object, they may seize itwithout a warrant. See Horton v. California, 496 U. S. 128,136-137 (1990); Texas v. Brown, 460 U. S. 730, 739 (1983) (plu-rality opinion). If, however, the police lack probable causeto believe that an object in plain view is contraband withoutconducting some further search of the object--i. e., if "itsincriminating character [is not] `immediately apparent,' "Horton, supra, at 136--the plain-view doctrine cannot justify its seizure. Arizona v. Hicks, 480 U. S. 321 (1987).We think that this doctrine has an obvious application byanalogy to cases in which an officer discovers contrabandthrough the sense of touch during an otherwise lawfulsearch. The rationale of the plain-view doctrine is that ifcontraband is left in open view and is observed by a policeofficer from a lawful vantage point, there has been no invasion of a legitimate expectation of privacy and thus no"search" within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment--orat least no search independent of the initial intrusion thatgave the officers their vantage point. See Illinois v. Andreas, 463 U. S. 765, 771 (1983); Texas v. Brown, supra, at740. The warrantless seizure of contraband that presentsitself in this manner is deemed justified by the realizationthat resort to a neutral magistrate under such circumstanceswould often be impracticable and would do little to promotethe objectives of the Fourth Amendment. See Hicks, supra,at 326-327; Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U. S. 443, 467-468, 469-470 (1971) (opinion of Stewart, J.). The same canbe said of tactile discoveries of contraband. If a police officer lawfully pats down a suspect's outer clothing and feels anobject whose contour or mass makes its identity immediatelyapparent, there has been no invasion of the suspect's privacybeyond that already authorized by the officer's search forweapons; if the object is contraband, its warrantless seizure508us2$85D 02-13-97 18:09:52 PAGES OPINPGT376 MINNESOTA v. DICKERSONOpinion of the Courtwould be justified by the same practical considerations thatinhere in the plain-view context.3The Minnesota Supreme Court rejected an analogy to theplain-view doctrine on two grounds: first, its belief that "thesense of touch is inherently less immediate and less reliablethan the sense of sight," and second, that "the sense of touchis far more intrusive into the personal privacy that is at thecore of the [F]ourth [A]mendment." 481 N. W. 2d, at 845.We have a somewhat different view. First, Terry itselfdemonstrates that the sense of touch is capable of revealingthe nature of an object with sufficient reliability to supporta seizure. The very premise ofTerry, after all, is that offi-cers will be able to detect the presence of weapons throughthe sense of touch and Terry upheld precisely such a seizure.Even if it were true that the sense of touch is generally lessreliable than the sense of sight, that only suggests that of-ficers will less often be able to justify seizures of unseencontraband. Regardless of whether the officer detects thecontraband by sight or by touch, however, the FourthAmendment's requirement that the officer have probablecause to believe that the item is contraband before seizingit ensures against excessively speculative seizures.4 The3 "[T]he police officer in each [case would have] had a prior justificationfor an intrusion in the course of which he came inadvertently acrossa piece of evidence incriminating the accused. The doctrine serves tosupplement the prior justification . . . and permits the warrantless seizure." Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U. S. 443, 466 (1971) (opinion ofStewart, J.).4 We also note that this Court's opinion in Ybarra v. Illinois, 444 U. S.85 (1979), appeared to contemplate the possibility that police officers couldobtain probable cause justifying a seizure of contraband through the senseof touch. In that case, police officers had entered a tavern and subjectedits patrons to patdown searches. While patting down the petitionerYbarra, an "officer felt what he described as `a cigarette pack with objectsin it,' " seized it, and discovered heroin inside. Id., at 88-89. The Stateargued that the seizure was constitutional on the grounds that the officerobtained probable cause to believe that Ybarra was carrying contrabandduring the course of a lawful Terry frisk. Ybarra, supra, at 92. This508us2$85D 02-13-97 18:09:52 PAGES OPINPGT377Cite as: 508 U. S. 366 (1993)Opinion of the Courtcourt's second concern--that touch is more intrusive into pri-vacy than is sight--is inapposite in light of the fact that theintrusion the court fears has already been authorized by thelawful search for weapons. The seizure of an item whoseidentity is already known occasions no further invasion ofprivacy. SeeSoldal v. Cook County, 506 U. S. 56, 66(1992); Horton, supra, at 141; United States v. Jacobsen, 466U. S. 109, 120 (1984). Accordingly, the suspect's privacy in-terests are not advanced by a categorical rule barring theseizure of contraband plainly detected through the sense oftouch.IIIIt remains to apply these principles to the facts of thiscase. Respondent has not challenged the finding made bythe trial court and affirmed by both the Court of Appealsand the State Supreme Court that the police were justifiedunder Terry in stopping him and frisking him for weapons.Thus, the dispositive question before this Court is whetherthe officer who conducted the search was acting within thelawful bounds marked by Terry at the time he gained probable cause to believe that the lump in respondent's jacket wascontraband. The State District Court did not make precisefindings on this point, instead finding simply that the officer,after feeling "a small, hard object wrapped in plastic" in respondent's pocket, "formed the opinion that the object . . .was crack . . . cocaine." App. to Pet. for Cert. C-2. TheCourt rejected that argument on the grounds that "[t]he initial frisk ofYbarra was simply not supported by a reasonable belief that he was armedand presently dangerous," as required by Terry. 444 U. S., at 92-93.The Court added: "[s]ince we conclude that the initial patdown of Ybarrawas not justified under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, we neednot decide whether or not the presence on Ybarra's person of `a cigarettepack with objects in it' yielded probable cause to believe that Ybarra wascarrying any illegal substance." Id., at 93, n. 5. The Court's analysisdoes not suggest, and indeed seems inconsistent with, the existence of acategorical bar against seizures of contraband detected manually during aTerry patdown search.508us2$85D 02-13-97 18:09:52 PAGES OPINPGT378 MINNESOTA v. DICKERSONOpinion of the CourtDistrict Court also noted that the officer made "no claim thathe suspected this object to be a weapon,"id., at C-5, a finding affirmed on appeal, see 469 N. W. 2d, at 464 (the officer"never thought the lump was a weapon"). The MinnesotaSupreme Court, after "a close examination of the record,"held that the officer's own testimony "belies any notion thathe `immediately' " recognized the lump as crack cocaine.See 481 N. W. 2d, at 844. Rather, the court concluded, theofficer determined that the lump was contraband only after"squeezing, sliding and otherwise manipulating the contentsof the defendant's pocket"--a pocket which the officer already knew contained no weapon. Ibid.Under the State Supreme Court's interpretation of therecord before it, it is clear that the court was correct in holding that the police officer in this case overstepped the boundsof the "strictly circumscribed" search for weapons allowedunder Terry. See Terry, 392 U. S., at 26. Where, as here,"an officer who is executing a valid search for one item seizesa different item," this Court rightly "has been sensitive tothe danger . . . that officers will enlarge a specific authorization, furnished by a warrant or an exigency, into theequivalent of a general warrant to rummage and seize atwill." Texas v. Brown, 460 U. S., at 748 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment). Here, the officer's continued exploration of respondent's pocket after having concluded that itcontained no weapon was unrelated to "[t]he sole justificationof the search [under Terry:] . . . the protection of the policeofficer and others nearby." 392 U. S., at 29. It thereforeamounted to the sort of evidentiary search that Terry expressly refused to authorize, see id., at 26, and that we havecondemned in subsequent cases. See Michigan v. Long, 463U. S., at 1049, n. 14; Sibron, 392 U. S., at 65-66.Once again, the analogy to the plain-view doctrine is apt.In Arizona v. Hicks, 480 U. S. 321 (1987), this Court heldinvalid the seizure of stolen stereo equipment found by policewhile executing a valid search for other evidence. Although508us2$85D 02-13-97 18:09:52 PAGES OPINPGT379Cite as: 508 U. S. 366 (1993)Scalia, J., concurringthe police were lawfully on the premises, they obtained prob-able cause to believe that the stereo equipment was contraband only after moving the equipment to permit officers toread its serial numbers. The subsequent seizure of theequipment could not be justified by the plain-view doctrine,this Court explained, because the incriminating character ofthe stereo equipment was not immediately apparent; rather,probable cause to believe that the equipment was stolenarose only as a result of a further search--the moving of theequipment--that was not authorized by a search warrant orby any exception to the warrant requirement. The facts ofthis case are very similar. Although the officer was lawfullyin a position to feel the lump in respondent's pocket, becauseTerry entitled him to place his hands upon respondent'sjacket, the court below determined that the incriminatingcharacter of the object was not immediately apparent to him.Rather, the officer determined that the item was contrabandonly after conducting a further search, one not authorized byTerry or by any other exception to the warrant requirement.Because this further search of respondent's pocket was constitutionally invalid, the seizure of the cocaine that followedis likewise unconstitutional.Horton, 496 U. S., at 140.IVFor these reasons, the judgment of the Minnesota Su-preme Court is
